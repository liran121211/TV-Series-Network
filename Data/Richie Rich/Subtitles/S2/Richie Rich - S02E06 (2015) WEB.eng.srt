1
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:12,805
- How dare you!
- What?

2
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,140
I will never forgive you!

3
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,558
What did I do?

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:20,521
You missed my ice dancing performance!

5
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,941
You made me watch that alone.

6
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:25,985
Imagine the worst thing you've ever seen,

7
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:29,154
and then set that on fire.

8
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:32,324
I am so sorry.
I can't believe I forgot that.

9
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,492
Let me make it up to you.

10
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,035
You missed me lutzing

11
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:37,746
better than I've ever lutzed before.

12
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,626
There's really nothing
you can do to make up for it.

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,462
How about a few dozen roses?

14
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,422
Some sequins?

15
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,924
And face glitter?

16
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,133
Yes, yes, and yes!

17
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:51,134
I forgive you.

18
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,636
What about me?

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,389
Do you realize
how emotionally scarred I am

20
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,475
after watching Murray, in that outfit,

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,686
fluttering around
like a wounded butterfly?

22
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,062
How about a diamond ring?

23
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,230
I have one.

24
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,650
For your diamond ring.

25
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,361
A diamond ring for my diamond ring.

26
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,446
I forgive you.

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,823
Master Richie,

28
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:15,283
I finished cleaning your time machine.

29
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,535
Perfect!

30
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,703
Now we can travel back in time

31
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,371
to watch Murray's performance.

32
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,581
Oh, no.

33
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:21,790
Sit through that again?

34
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,001
No way.

35
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:26,545
So does this time machine actually work?

36
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,129
Why don't you ask the caveman?

37
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,341
[growls]

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,385
That's amazing!

39
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,012
But do you think it's safe

40
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:37,681
to let a caveman run wild in your house?

41
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,807
Oh, yeah.

42
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,602
He and my dad get along great.

43
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:43,186
Hey, guys. Have you seen ugg?

44
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,814
He was gonna teach me how to make fire.

45
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,190
[smoke detector beeping]

46
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:50,193
Aww, man, he started without me.

47
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,946
[cash register dings]
My name is Richie Rich,

48
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,154
and I'm just a normal kid--

49
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,281
except that I have

50
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,741
a trillion dollars.

51
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,910
You see, 
I used all the vegetables I never ate

52
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,870
to create a new energy source

53
00:01:59,954 --> 00:02:01,956
and sold it for a lot of money.
[cha-ching]

54
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:05,166
Now I live in a huge mansion
with my own amusement park,

55
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,795
race car, and personal robot maid.

56
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,922
And I have my family and
the best friends in the world

57
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,423
to share my fortune with:

58
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,507
My dad,

59
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,051
my jealous sister, Harper,

60
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,469
my money manager, Murray,

61
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,763
and my money spender, Darcy.

62
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,099
I guess you could say,
by not eating my vegetables,

63
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,558
I became the richest

64
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,727
and luckiest kid in the world.

65
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,606
So, guys, where in time do we want to go?

66
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,149
I think you mean

67
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,069
"when" do we want to go?

68
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:36,490
I vote for the day before we met Murray.

69
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,909
[beeping]

70
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,496
[electrical whirring]

71
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,292
Where are we?

72
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,129
Correction.<i> "</i>When<i> </i>are we?"

73
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,297
Okay, we're done with that.

74
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,508
This is six hours ago.

75
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,928
What an angel I am when I sleep.

76
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,638
[snores]

77
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:01,723
As exciting as this is,

78
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:04,101
can we go back into time a little further?

79
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:05,978
Okay, fine.

80
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,438
[whispers]
Sleep tight, little buddy.

81
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:11,942
You got a big day ahead of you.

82
00:03:12,026 --> 00:03:13,192
[beeping]

83
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,322
[electrical whirring]

84
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,120
Welcome to the ice age.

85
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:24,621
Why did you take us here?

86
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:25,622
Uh-oh.

87
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:26,665
[ripping]

88
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,959
I saved you guys a salchow.

89
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,752
Let's get out of here!

90
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,966
No!

91
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,967
[beeping]

92
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,552
[electrical whirring]

93
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,555
[grunts]

94
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,141
It's gonna be so cool to see a dinosaur.

95
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,436
I have always wanted a T. Rex purse.

96
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,148
I brought stale bread to feed it.

97
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,150
Why would you do that?

98
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,985
They're just large birds.

99
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,486
[dinosaur roar]

100
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,988
[all scream]

101
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,156
[dinosaur roar]

102
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,490
[beeping]

103
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,325
[electrical whirring]

104
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,995
[sighs]

105
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,581
[both scream]

106
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,791
It followed us!

107
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,918
Guys, calm down.

108
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,420
That's just my statue.

109
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,755
Oh.

110
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,048
Thank goodness.

111
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,674
Um...

112
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,177
Irona might need to
clean the time machine again.

113
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,807
Well, thank you for giving me
another chance.

114
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:29,603
Thank you for the marching band.

115
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,813
I've been to a lot of
college applicant's houses,

116
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,816
but never have I been treated
to a marching band.

117
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,818
Snacks, dinner, swedish massage, yes.

118
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,612
Marching band, no.

119
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,405
[laughs]
That is hysterical.

120
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,823
You are so funny.

121
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,200
Has anyone ever told you that?

122
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,620
No, never.

123
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,206
Well, Mr. Legan,
it would be a dream come true

124
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,540
to attend your university.

125
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,084
Yes, you made that very clear

126
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,835
when you sang the song
with that exact title

127
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,171
before the band got here.

128
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,840
Well, I look forward
to getting your application.

129
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,467
Uh, do you know your way out?

130
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,594
Yes, I'll just follow the red carpet.

131
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,641
Sup, boo?

132
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,309
Why are you pacing?

133
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,228
Aww, were you worried
I wasn't gonna come back?

134
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,229
I'm back.

135
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,939
No more worries.

136
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,774
Tahj, I don't have time for you right now.

137
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,151
I'm waiting to hear back from Harvard,

138
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,568
and they're taking forever.

139
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,569
When did you apply?

140
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,655
Two minutes ago.

141
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,448
I really hope they like my essay.

142
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,326
Ooh, did you say anything about me?

143
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,619
Yo, did you mention T-Nice

144
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,080
is dropping an album on the 19th?

145
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:31,248
Uh-oh, I see a problem.

146
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,791
What? What is it?

147
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,459
Well, for starters, I don't see anything

148
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,419
about my new album,

149
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,796
but worse, you wrote,

150
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,131
"Harvard is not the place for me."

151
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,841
No, I didn't.

152
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,092
I would never write that,
because Harvard is not the pla--

153
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,803
[gasps]
I did it again!

154
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,054
No, that's supposed to say,

155
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,764
"Harvard is<i> </i>the place for me!

156
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,765
Yeah, that's better.

157
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,017
You should have gone with that.

158
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,521
Darcy, that was so funny when you shouted,

159
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:59,276
"I see land," right before Columbus did.

160
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,652
And now, every year,

161
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,822
we get to take a "Darcy Day"
off from school.

162
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,450
Yeah, well, 
I got something named after me too.

163
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:08,743
Hey, Richie.

164
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:11,579
Do you have any more Murray paper?

165
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,748
Ugg and I want to M.P. The house.

166
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,125
Check the storage room.

167
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,129
[electrical whirring]

168
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:21,506
Hey, Richie!

169
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,716
Dad?

170
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,592
How did you change clothes so fast?

171
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:28,096
Richie, I'm you from the future.

172
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,598
I need you to come back with me.

173
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,309
I think it's time you put your dad

174
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,895
in that home we talked about.

175
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,522
Okay, I know it sounds crazy,

176
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,733
but I can prove that I'm not your father.

177
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,986
In three, two, one--

178
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,530
Hey, I just made popcorn in the microwave

179
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,575
and blew Ugg's mind!

180
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,743
To the ice machine!

181
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:50,785
Hohh!

182
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,663
And three, two, one--

183
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,166
Whoa! You are me!

184
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,584
I knew you'd get it!

185
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:06,467
I can't believe I'm looking
at me from the future.

186
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,011
I thought you would age a little better.

187
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,055
[both] Hey!

188
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,556
So I have to ask.

189
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,308
- Do I ever--
- Yes.

190
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,227
You didn't even know
what I was I going to ask.

191
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,686
Vacation on mars?

192
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,021
Yeah!

193
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,732
You are so me.

194
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,234
So last question--

195
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,278
Yes, <i>The Simpsons </i>are still running.

196
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,196
Ha!

197
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,697
Why are you here?

198
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:31,785
I think you mean<i> "</i>When<i> </i>is he here?"

199
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,913
Okay, I'll stop.

200
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,331
I came back because

201
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,041
I need Richie's help with our son.

202
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,710
He's your age now, so I figured
you could relate to him.

203
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,129
I have a son?

204
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,422
And a baby daughter.

205
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,673
Oh. Who's our wife?

206
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,925
We married Darcy.

207
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,551
[both] What?

208
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,387
[laughs]

209
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,721
What are you laughing for?

210
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,889
You become a mailman.

211
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,016
[both laugh]

212
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,601
I'm just messing with you.

213
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,312
Oh, thank goodness.

214
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,646
No, I was just messing with them.

215
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,732
You're definitely a mailman.

216
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,151
Wait, so I don't marry Richie?

217
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,152
Nope.

218
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:07,070
Phew!

219
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:10,490
Can you tone down
the celebration a little?

220
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,659
Check out the Darcy we do marry.

221
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,412
Whoa!

222
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,666
Could you tone down
the celebration a little?

223
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,376
So is she at home watching the kids?

224
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,420
She's an astronaut, so she's gone a lot.

225
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,046
Irona's watching the kids.

226
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,008
I still work for you
30 years into the future?

227
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,343
Yup!

228
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,262
[sighs]

229
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,805
Come on, Richie, we should head back.

230
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,598
I'm coming with you.

231
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,810
I need to see this mailman thing
with my own eyes.

232
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,687
I want to see my future self too.

233
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,397
Okay, we can stop by the cemetery.

234
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,648
What?

235
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,359
Oh, relax. You just work there.

236
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:46,734
I work?

237
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,575
[electrical whirring]

238
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,163
[all groaning]

239
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,123
Welcome back, Master Richie.

240
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,001
Good to see you again, 
young Master Richie.

241
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,379
Irona, you sound just like a human.

242
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:06,880
Uh, yeah. It's the future.

243
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,632
Welcome to it.

244
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,633
Can I offer you a beverage?

245
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,344
Yeah.

246
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,889
After 30 years of time travel,
I'm a bit parched.

247
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,808
Lemonade.

248
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:19,893
[gasps]
Whoa!

249
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,979
That's sick!

250
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,815
Wait. This is iced tea.

251
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,609
Yeah. Technology still has some bugs.

252
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,653
[electricity fizzles]

253
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,654
[baby wails distantly]

254
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:32,906
Oh, your baby is up.

255
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,282
I would help out,

256
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,867
but I'm gonna go meet up with my husband.

257
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,285
You got married?

258
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,495
Yeah, it's legal now...

259
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,373
in 57 states.

260
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,584
So, Murray and Darcy,

261
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,211
would you mind tending to the baby?

262
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,004
I need to talk to myself for a minute.

263
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,340
I don't know anything about raising kids.

264
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,674
What are you talking about?

265
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:52,800
You have 14.

266
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,011
On a mailman's salary?

267
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,263
Ugh!

268
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,600
So I was hoping you could help out.

269
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,977
Things haven't been great 
between our son and I.

270
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:03,978
For how long?

271
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,564
12 years.

272
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,816
But I was hoping that you could
nip that in the bud.

273
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,817
Ooh, here he comes.

274
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:10,818
Fix everything.

275
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,529
Good luck.

276
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,116
I gotta go, bro,
my dad's here with some loser.

277
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,825
I'll holotext you later.

278
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,626
Hey, Ronnie, 
this is me from when I was your age.

279
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,668
Great.

280
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,213
What do you want?

281
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,091
I just wanted to hang out.

282
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,842
Why aren't you wearing shoes?

283
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,136
Shoes?

284
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,054
No one wears shoes anymore.

285
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,307
This is why I hate
meeting people from the past.

286
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,682
Dad, can I leave?

287
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,143
- No.
- Whatever you want.

288
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,979
I'm hitting the jet tube.

289
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,230
[engine whooshes]

290
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,191
What happened there?

291
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,445
I don't know.
I've never been a dad before.

292
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,863
Have you asked dad how to deal with this?

293
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,117
President of the world, Cliff?

294
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,827
Good luck getting ahold of him.

295
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,832
[presidential music]

296
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,127
Once Mr. Legan reads that email,

297
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,337
I'm out of Harvard!

298
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,671
My one dream is dashed.

299
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,381
My life is over!

300
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,175
You sound desperate.

301
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,469
How desperate?

302
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,513
[cat meowing ringtone plays]

303
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,097
Nice ringtone.

304
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,765
I don't think that's mine.

305
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,478
I can't be sure. 
It's been a while since it rang.

306
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,648
Wait a minute.

307
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:30,940
Mr. Legan left his phone here!

308
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,651
How do you know it's his?

309
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,654
His screensaver's
a picture of him and his cats.

310
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:38,114
Now I can just delete
the email with my essay.

311
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,658
Aww, you're cute

312
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,536
when you're clinging to a shred of hope.

313
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,702
Ugh! It's locked!

314
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,246
Stupid passcode!

315
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,956
No worries. T-Nice to the rescue.

316

I can hack into anything,
phones, computers, hearts.

317
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,171
Hurry up. We don't have a lot of time.

318
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,631
Would you relax?

319
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:57,342
Let the genius work.

320

[baby wails]

325
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,356
You're making it worse.

326
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,484
This is how my parents shut me up!

327
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,152

I think she liked it

when we were shouting at each other.

333
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,745
You're an idiot!

You don't have to say mean things!

335
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,291
You just have to shout!

336
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,376
Sorry!

We all make mistakes!

Look, you may be my dad,

348
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,195
but you're not my dad.

Get it?

350
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,573
I get it.

351
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,368
I was pretty stubborn when I am your age.

352
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:06,703
Why don't you tell me what's wrong

353

with you and your dad?

354
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,706

I am so sorry.

I can't believe he missed your game.

Is there still water?

360
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,303
See? You guys are the exact same.

361
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,012
well, we are technically--

362
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,139
I can't believe my dad couldn't just

363
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,806
talk to me himself.

364

He had to go yank mini-him from the past

365
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,018
to deal with me.

366
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,353
It's pathetic.

00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,063
I don't want to be here anymore!

Did you patch things up yet?

00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,535
Not exactly.

372
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,246
He's kinda mad
you missed his spaceball game.

373
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,706
What? That's tomorrow.

374
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,707
Tuesday.

375
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,501
Today is Tuesday.

376
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,002
Ugh, it's been so hard

377
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,505
since they got rid of Monday.

378
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,632
Yeah, well, he sort of, kind of ran off

379
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,091
to go live with Harper.

380
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,259
Are you serious?

381
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,719
He'll never come back!

382
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:08,807
Harper is such a kind and generous person.

383
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,308
Okay, put a pin in the Harper thing.

384
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,185
We're totally coming back to that.

385
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:15,438
But first, I have an idea how to get

386
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:18,024
you and Ronnie back on good terms.

387
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,194
The good thing about
having a time machine is,

388
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,570
you never run out of time.

389
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,240
I'm gonna go back and try again.

390
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,451
[beeping]

391
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,453
[electrical whirring]

392
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,955
Want to take her for a walk in the park?

393
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,249
That would be nice!

394
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,380
Hey, Ronnie!

395
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,256
Look what I got you!

396
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,592
Four tickets to a Drake concert!

397
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,511
[scoffs]
That guy's 60!

398
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,305
Besides, 
music stopped being a thing years ago.

399
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,057
It's all numbers now.

400
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,308
Oh.

401
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,811
[beeping]

402
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,312
[electrical whirring]

403
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,606
Want to take her for a walk in the park?

404
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,775
That would be nice!

405
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,193
Hey, buddy.

406
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,320
I got you a skateboard.

407
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,446
One with wheels?

408
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,989
Why don't you roll that back

409
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,784
to the time when people rolled on things?

410
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,786
Okay.

411
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,204
[electrical whirring]

412
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,456
Driver-less car?

413
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,457
[electrical whirring]

414
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,792
Really big TV?

415
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:18,793
[electrical whirring]

416
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,546
Really small TV?

417
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,630
[electrical whirring]

418
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:23,882
Welcome mat?

419
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:25,466
[electrical whirring]
Legal pad?

420
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,427
[electrical whirring]
Butternut squash?

421
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,057
This password is impossible.

422
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,559
I tried one-two-three-four.

423
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,144
I tried four-three-two-one.

424
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,354
I'm out of ideas.

425
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,898
Just give me the phone.

426
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,024
Okay, one-one-one-one.

427
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,025
Ugh!

428
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,569
Not so easy, is it?

429
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:48,155
Harper?

430
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,908
My apologies for barging in,

431
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,826
but your father
and his rather hairy friend

432
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,160
told me you'd be here.

433
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,621
I may have left my phone here earlier.

434
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,163
Have you seen it?

435
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,874
I have not. But I'll keep my eyes open.

436
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,959
If you were to blurt out
four numbers just randomly,

437
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,085
what would they be?

438
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,378
And you are?

439
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,297
Oh, I'm T-Nice.

440
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,466
The rapper.

441
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,718
Bulldozah's son.

442
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,637
Would you mind
just calling my phone for me?

443
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,389
I would, but I don't have it on me, so--

444
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,725
Oh, you can just use mine.

445
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,184
Don't worry.

446
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,394
I hid the phone where he'll never find it

447
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,396
and turned off his ringer

448
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,399
[cat meowing ringtone playing]

449
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,617
There it is!

450
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,202
Yay!

451
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,581
[electrical whirring]

452
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,541
Want to take her for a walk in the park?

453
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,209
That would be nice!

454
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,591
Master Richie, you have got to stop this.

455
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,718
You've been doing this forever.

456
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,846
Yeah, you're right.

457
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,431
Ronnie's not gonna want
this wig and beard.

458
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,227
Still no luck?

459
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,062
I don't know how to make him happy.

460
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,607
He doesn't want any of my apology gifts.

461
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,609
Tell me about it.

462
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,027
I failed.

463
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,404
I guess I'm not ready to be a dad.

464
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,239
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

465
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:14,033
Let me make it up to you.

466
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,243
Here's a million dollars' worth of water.

467
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,286
Wait.

468
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,955
What?

469
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,581
I'm sorry. I can't spare any more water.

470
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,375
I have a family.

471
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,503
No, you always try to
make things right with a gift.

472
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,672
Oh, do I do that?

473
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,757
Yeah.

474
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,425
We both do.

475
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,845
I just want to do something
nice since I messed up.

476
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,389
But gifts and apologies
don't mean anything

477
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,058
if you keep making the same mistake.

478
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,477
Well, now that I've
helped you two figure that out,

479
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,898
I have 15,000
square feet of carpet to vacuum.

480
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,816
Please vacuum.

481
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,193
[loud whirring]

482
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,029
And I'm done for the day.

483
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,075
Would you two like to explain

484
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,493
what you were doing with my phone?

485
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,503
The truth is, Mr. Legan,
I was really embarrassed.

486
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,423
See, I accidentally submitted
my essay with a typo.

487
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,383
And I wanted to delete it
before you saw it.

488
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,593
A typo?

489
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:14,969
[scoffs]
Don't worry about it.

490
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,512
[sighs]
Really?

491
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,889
I'm so happy to hear that.

492
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,265
It's not like we can be that picky.

493
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,266
We ain't Harvard.

494
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,227
Say what now?

495
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,104
Don't you work for Harvard?

496
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,731
Not after I slashed the dean's tires...

497
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,524
[laughs]

498
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,943
Anyway, don't worry about the typo.

499
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:32,445
Wait, where do you work now?

500
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,239
The Topeka Kansas Maritime Institute.

501
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,657
See you there, sailor.

502
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:39,953
[electrical whirring]

503
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,328
Seriously, Richie?

504
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:43,456
We're doing this again?

505
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,332
Last time, I promise.

506
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,126
[sighs]

507
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,670
Want to take her for a walk in the park?

508
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,965
That would be nice!

509
00:18:52,048 --> 00:18:55,551
Get it right!

510
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:56,552
Hey, Ronnie.

511
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,096
I got you something.

512
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,221
Another gift?

513
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,223
No, thanks.

514
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:02,558
It's me.

515
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,143
I want to go to your spaceball game.

516
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,770
Yeah, right.

517
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,063
You won't show up, and then you'll try to

518
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,397
make it up to me with another present.

519
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,983
He's serious.

520
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,068
As your parents, we both realize

521
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,779
money and gifts
aren't substitutes for love.

522
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,072
I'm sorry, Ronnie.

523
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,281
I'm gonna do better.

524
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,491
You promise?

525
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,909
I promise.

526
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,410
He does.

527
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,788
He really does.

528
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,582
Thanks, Dad...s.

529
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,003
Come here.

530
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,378
Hey, Richie.

531
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,006
You'd be really proud of me and Darcy.

532
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,382
Yeah, we are great babysitters.

533
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:37,802
Ah, I'm glad you guys are
getting all that practice in.

534
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,138
You're gonna need it since
you have 14 kids together.

535
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,015
[both] What?

536
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,766
You get married after high school.

537
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,267
[both] What?

538
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,021
The future is awesome!

539
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,605
Maybe for you!

540
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,773
[doorbell rings]

541
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:51,774
Ooh. Mail's here.

542
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,026
Don't open that door!

543
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,823
Wow, Murray.

544
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,575
That was an amazing 
ice dancing performance.

545
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:02,952
I'm really glad I made it this time.

546
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,704
Thanks for coming.

547
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:09,167
Now you know I'm not bragging.
I have mad skills.

548
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,877
It was still awful.

549
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,295
It was just less awful having you there.

550
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,049
Guys, 
I'm really sorry I missed the first one.

551
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,342
Seeing myself in the future
made me realize

552
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:19,969
I need to make some changes.

553
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,429
I'm not letting myself turn into that guy.

554
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:23,848
There's a few things in the future

555
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,684
I would like to change too.

556
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,436
Well, 
I need to wash the glitter off my hands.

557
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,985
That whole time traveling thing

558
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,155
was pretty crazy, huh?

559
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,658
Yup.

560
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,452
So...

561
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,872
So...

562
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:48,998
Hi, guys!

563
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,249
[both] Irona!

564
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,876
Come hang out with us!

565
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,627
Yeah, for, like, ever!

566
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,963
You two are so cute together.

567
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,631
No, we are not!

568
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,634
You...take...that...back.
