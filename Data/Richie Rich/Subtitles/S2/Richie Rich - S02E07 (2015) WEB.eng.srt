1
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,113
I'm telling you, baby,

2
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,616
a game app based on your life
gives me goose bumps.

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,951
And the good ones,

4
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,704
not the kind that don't go away
for a few months.

5
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,789
I don't think those are goose bumps.

6
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,375
And I'm not sure I want to do this.

7
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,168
Uh, why not?

8
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,213
I mean, don't you know how much
good can come from this?

9
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,048
I mean, I could finally move out
of my parents' basement,

10
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:50,300
and you...

11
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,887
can know that you helped me
move out of my parents' basement.

12
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:57,558
I'm not the kind of guy who wants to
open his life up to the public.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,895
Master Richie,
should I cancel those meetings

14
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,104
with the publishers
regarding your autobiography?

15
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,773
Oh, no, that's different.

16
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,028
Dude, this isn't
some hard-hitting documentary.

17
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,821
It's, as my parents would say,

18
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:14,909
"It's just a stupid,
little animated game."

19
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,037
Richie, tell your friend
Murray to leave me alone.

20
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,454
He followed me all around the mall

21
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:20,915
waving this paper in my face.

22
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:24,209
He made it really hard 
to spend your money.

23
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,711
I mean, I still did it,

24
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,256
but he made it harder
than I like it to be.

25
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,592
It's not a piece of paper, it's a memo

26
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:36,179
declaring you cannot shop
between the hours of "all day."

27
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,766
No one reads your stupid memos.

28
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,477
Richie, Irona, tell Darcy she is mistaken.

29
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,146
[both] Um...

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,942
Oh, hey, are you the replacement Murray

31
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,193
I've been begging for?

32
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:53,655
No, I'm Bixby Knox,
app developer extraordinaire.

33
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,908
I'm the guy who brought
the world <i>Pastry Crunch.</i>

34
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,535
<i>Pastry Crunch </i>is quite addictive.

35
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,287
I have it on my internal processor

36
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,791
and play for hours a day...

37
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,669
during my 15-minute break.

38
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,880
Have you seen the new ultra level?

39
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,590
There's a new ultra level?

40
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,635
Excuse me. I have dusting to do.

41
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,721
Load <i>Pastry Crunch.</i>

42
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:21,224
Whoa, they added croissants!

43
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,477
So cool.

44
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,895
Memo to self,

45
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,480
write memo about employees

46
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:30,484
playing video games on company time.

47
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,819
So what are you doing here?

48
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,194
He was trying to convince me

49
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,196
to make an app based on my life,

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,615
but I told him no.

51
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,283
- [both] Why?
- We could be famous.

52
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,910
We could make money.

53
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,203
We could move out
of our parents' basement.

54
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,789
I don't know.

55
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,457
- Famous.
- Money.

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,376
Basement.

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,211
- [cash register dings]
- My name is Richie Rich,

58
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,588
and I'm just a normal kid--

59
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,840
except that I have

60
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,341
a trillion dollars.

61
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:56,093
You see, I used
all the vegetables I never ate

62
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,053
to create a new energy source

63
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,055
and sold it for a lot of money.
[cha-ching]

64
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,350
Now I live in a huge mansion
with my own amusement park,

65
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,978
race car, and personal robot maid.

66
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,105
And I have my family and
the best friends in the world

67
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:09,356
to share my fortune with:

68
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,691
My dad,

69
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,233
my jealous sister, Harper,

70
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,652
my money manager, Murray,

71
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,946
and my money spender, Darcy.

72
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,281
I guess you could say,
by not eating my vegetables,

73
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,741
I became the richest

74
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,369
and luckiest kid in the world.

75
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:29,043
Come on, scone booster. Come on!

76
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,180
Memo to self, write memo about--

77
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,642
All right, guys, I just want to ask you

78
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,936
a few questions to make
the Richie game more realistic.

79
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,312
Okay? First question.

80
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,606
My mom packed me some carrot sticks.

81
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,569
Who would like to trade for fruit gummies?

82
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,612
Are you sure you've done this before?

83
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,906
What? Traded lunches?

84
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,615
I do it every day.

85
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,327
Let me show you what makes Murray tick.

86
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:07,581
There's me buying my first long-term bond.

87
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,583
There's my dad holding the baby carrier

88
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,376
up to the banker's window.

89
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,003
Murray, what are you doing?

90
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,755
Simply equipping Bixby
with the knowledge

91
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,298
he needs to fully flesh out
the Murray character.

92
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:18,550
[gasps]

93
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,552
Here is a suspicious mole

94
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,556
my dermatologist removed from my back.

95
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,058
It was benign.

96
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,350
Murray!

97
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,229
Bixby does not need to see that!

98
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,147
No one does.

99
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:36,276
Okay, so let's talk about Darcy.

100
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,738
She's smart, beautiful, humble.

101
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,949
She's also the kindest person
you'll ever meet.

102
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,408
Have you met yourself?

103
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,078
Shut up, Murray!

104
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:48,038
Guys, I think Bixby has a good sense

105
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,581
of your personalities.

106
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,707
Are you sure?

107
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,378
Here's a picture of me with my hero,

108
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,257
renowned economist Alan Greenspan.

109
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,758
I wanted him to sign it,

110
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,509
but the police dragged me
out of his kitchen

111
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,386
before I got the chance.

112
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,722
Here's a pic of my hero.

113
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,474
Darcy, that's you.

114
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,892
Yeah, so?

115
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,811
Who says you can't be your own hero?

116
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,104
Guys, that's enough.

117
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,648
I think I need to talk to Bixby alone.

118
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,233
Yes, please.

119
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,193
We have some very important
business to discuss.

120
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:19,444
Yeah.

121
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,448
So...

122
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,867
let's talk trade.

Oh, I meant

130
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,888
Dad, focus.

131
00:05:46,972 --> 00:05:48,515
I found out that Harvard School

of Musical Theater has
a 6% higher acceptance rate,

133
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,188

about musical theater.

140

Dad, I appreciate the offer,

141
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,372
but when you try to help me,
it usually ends in disaster.

142
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,751
Always ends in disaster.

143
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,419
Suit yourself.

144
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,922
Boring history is not
a good subject for a musical,

145

but, hey, what do I know?

146
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,052
I was only the lead in over 30 plays

147
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,761
down at the community theater.

148
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,847
You were? When?

149
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,182
Back when I had spare time.

150
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,851
Now, if you'll excuse me,

151
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,062
I have to get to my game shows.

152
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,441
Just out of curiosity,

153
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,361
if I were to ask for your help,

154
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:45,322
what would you say about

155
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,074

the man of the night, Richie Rich.

158
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,085
How are you feeling?

159
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,379
Are you nervous walking into
the premiere of your game app?

160
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,631
No, I feel quite at home.

161
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,968
But that might be
because we're in my bedroom.

162
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,720
The best part of this is being able

163
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,099
to share this experience
with my two best friends.

164
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,935
Get in here, Darcy and Murray.

Before you ask,
I am wearing Dissue Alasson,

who I adore, and jewels
provided by Richie Rich.

167
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,778
Which he is unaware of.

168
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,154
And I am wearing a rental

169
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,615
from Rupert's Tuxedos on Magnolia

170
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,160
because they were kind enough
to honor my expired coupon.

171
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,082
Hello. Attention please.

This is a very important night
for me, Richie Rich,

174
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,048
and my parents, who are at home

175
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:48,676

since 1980.

177
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,679
Yeah. They're very happy.

So happy.

Welcome to the new and improved

that your app built.

364
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:11,614
How does it feel to finally be a success?

365
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,366
- Not good.
- Really?

366
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,243
Because I'm loving life.

[fan whirring]

368
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,707
Bet you never saw one of those before.

369
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,209
What you did to my friends was wrong.

370
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,211
Hey, I had to make the game entertaining.

371
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,672
And, as you can see,
I made the right call.

372
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,048
Check it out.

373
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,550

375
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:34,303
To you, this is just a game,

376
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,847
but it's my life.

377
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,683
Neither of my best friends
will talk to me anymore.

378
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,727
Bro, we can be friends.

379
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,938
Uh, I got a magazine,
and we can take turns reading it.

380
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:45,565
I'm done with this app.

381
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,149
Take it down.

382
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,109
Oh, I can't do that.

383
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,070
Yes, you can. You have to.

384
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,489
It's an app based on my life.

385
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,033
No, it's not.

386
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,035
It's based on virtual Richie's life,

387
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,914
and he stopped by earlier
and insisted that I keep it up.

388
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,331
You've lost it.

389
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,751
No, I've found it.

390
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,295
Now, please go before I release
my guard dog on you.

391
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,008
Woof! Bark!

392
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,301

Thanks, Dad, but you were right.

414
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,701
Grover Cleveland might not have been

415
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,829
the best subject for a musical.

416
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,540
Well, this doesn't have to be
the end of your theater career.

417
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,751
In fact, I made a few phone calls

418
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,253
and found a producer
willing to put up big bucks

419
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,089
to stage <i>Totally Sauce-ome.</i>

420

and there's nothing I can do about it.

426
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,272
That is tough.

427
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,984
Darcy. Murray. Bad stuff.

428
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,153
Irona, are you listening to me?

429
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,155
Yes, master pastry.

430
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,405
I mean Richie.

431
00:19:58,489 --> 00:19:59,991
Okay, I paused my game.

432
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,367
I am listening.

that stupid <i>Richie Rich </i>app,

435

and it's ruining my life.

Well, would you like me

437
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,417
to hack into the game's mainframe

438
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,836
and change the coding?

439
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,005
You can do that?

440
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,798
Why didn't you say anything?

441
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,800
Because I have been busy...

443
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,349
Okay, I have accessed the app.

00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,226
What would you like me to do?

445
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,722
I had Irona crash the app.

446
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,141
Our online nightmare is over.

447
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:10,061
Thanks, Richie. That means a lot.

448
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,021
I can't believe I'm saying this,

449
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,314
but I agree with Darcy.

450
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,525
I care about you guys.

451
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,527
I'm sorry I let someone come between us.

I'll do anything to make it up to you.

00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,948
You'll let me keep your car and jet?

454
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,158
- Anything.
- You'll read all of my memos?

455
00:21:24,242 --> 00:21:25,993
Almost anything.
