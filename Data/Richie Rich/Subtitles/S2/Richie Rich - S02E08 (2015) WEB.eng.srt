if you needed to pick your nose?

- A finger?
- Ew, disgusting.

194
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,384
Fingers are for ear digging, Richie.

Okay, how do we make this
a little less terrible?

Well, first of all,
you're gonna need to cut costs.

You can't use Bolivian rosewood.
That's too expensive.

are afraid to deal with.

Yes, it's a cause no one else is touching.

282

Yeah, because it's highly contagious.

and facts and charts.

Nobody's going to watch that.

288
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,325

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,218
[air pops]

359
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,306
Irona, I'm awake.

360
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,101
I just don't have any reason
to get out of bed.

361
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,561
I'm washed-up.

362
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,522
Master Richie,
you are not washed-up,

363
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,315
and I mean that literally.

364
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,192
You really need a shower.

365
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:47,864
How's he doing?

366
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,282
He just went to bed at 9:00 a.m.,

367
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,785
so not great.

368
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,287
Hey, buddy. So you failed.

369
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,873
I failed at lots and lots
and lots and lots

370
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,334
and lots of things, like--

371
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,961
oh, nothing comes to mind at the moment.

372
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,381
I consider this pep talk a failure.

373
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,718
Come on, Master Richie.
You have to get out of bed.

374
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:11,387
Mainly because I need
to change your sheets,

375
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,933
but also because, you know,

376
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,602
feelings.

377
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,605
- Leave me alone.
- That's it.

378
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,983
Richie, you have no reason
to feel sorry for yourself.

379
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,778
So some stupid magazine
called you pathetic.

380
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,237
People call me names all the time,

381
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,656
but do I hide in bed?

382
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,116
No, not unless the pollen count is high.

383
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,454
Then it's just common sense.

384
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,747
Thanks.

385
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,792
You guys make a lot of sense,

386
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,669
some more than others.

387
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,963
I guess just because
I humiliated myself

388
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,714
doesn't mean I should give up.

389
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,968
I mean, I'm sure I can come up
with something else.

390
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,137
Whoa. What did you just do?

391
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,307
I pulled up my pajamas. I was too hot.

392
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,143
- Where did you get those?
- I designed them.

393
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,145
Whenever I sleep, I'm too hot.

394
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,647
Then I'm too cold.

395
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,859
These pajamas keep me
comfortable all night.

396
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,027
You had these pajamas the whole time,

397
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,487
and you went with the nose pick?

398
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,864
What's wrong with you?

399
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:13,741
You guys really think we can sell these?

400
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,409
Of course.

401
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,662
I'll get the baboons to work right away.

402
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,664
Hold on, I want your help,

403
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,959
but this time, I want
a little bit less of your help.

404
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,629
[cash register dings]

405
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,632
Hey, guys, hate to spoil the pizza party,

406
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,635
but my foot fungus video
has gotten 13 views,

407
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,596
three likes,
and a few hurtful comments,

408
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,932
but those people have been blocked.

409
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,727
Wow, 13.

410
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,603
That's more than I thought you'd get.

411
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,981
Yes, well, people appreciate
straight information

412
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:48,234
delivered to them by someone
in a tasteful turtleneck.

413
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,904
Guess you guys shouldn't have
hopped off the Harper Express.

414
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,532
Next stop, Harvard.

415
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,743
Oh, yeah, we saw your little train

416
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,246
while we were blasting past you
on the Darcy-Tulip rocket ship.

417
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,748
[imitates explosion]

418
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,374
What are you talking about?

419
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,919
Our pizza balance challenge
is sweeping the nation.

420
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:09,088
Over 15 million people
have uploaded videos.

421
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,674
Is 15 million more than 13?

422
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,384
I really don't know.

423
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,513
- You can't be serious.
- Care to see for yourself?

424
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,516
Hi, I'm Becky Samuels,

425
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,518
and I accept the pizza balance challenge

426
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,103
to fight foot fungus.

427
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,605
Here I go.

428
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,903
That was harder than I thought.

429
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:35,155
Okay, I dedicate this to my cousin Joe,

430
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:39,035
who hasn't been able
to wear sandals since 1997.

431
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,286
Okay.

432
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:49,295
Yeah. Hang in there, Joe!

433
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,923
Hi, my name is Irona,

434
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:55,134
and even though my feet are made
of fungus-resistant titanium,

435
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,554
I did not want to miss out
on the pizza balance challenge.

436
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,849
Great, here goes nothing.

437
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,270
Hey, I'm doing it.

438
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,148
This must be what humans call fun.

439
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,865
Sorry. Couldn't resist.

440
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,455
Okay, so people are doing
your stupid pizza thing.

441
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,832
It doesn't mean we're any closer

442
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,959
to finding a cure for foot fungus.

443
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,837
Actually we've raised over $6 million.

444
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,132
They're building a statue of us
at the Foot Fungus Institute.

445
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:35,967
It's gonna look like this.

446
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,471
She'll stay like that for hours.

447
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,432
- It's amazing.
- That's amazing.

448
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,476
Thank you so much.

449
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,062
Harper, I've never heard you
say the words

450
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:50,439
"thank" and "you" in the same sentence.

451
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:53,192
Well, it's just because I feel for those

452
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,194
afflicted with foot fungus.

453
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,363
I mean, I can only imagine how hard it is

454
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:01,784
to go through the day
with painfully itchy feet.

455
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:06,789
- Wait, you have foot fungus.
- Ew, no, I don't.

456
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,126
Oh, sweet relief!

457
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:13,546
That's why you wanted to find a cure.

458
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,757
Okay, I admit it.

459
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,551
I've been living a lie,

460
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:22,096
a blistered, painful, itchy lie.

461
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,391
Darcy, help me.

462
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:29,645
I can't help you,
but you can help yourself.

463
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,315
Hi, I'm Harper Rich,

464
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,236
and I really hope they find
a cure for foot fungus,

465
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,905
like, today.

466
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,915
I forgot to breathe.

467
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:52,043
I'm really proud of you
for not giving up, Richie.

468
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,836
How'd you get everyone to show up again?

469
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,629
I just sent them invitations

470
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,926
printed out in $100 bills.

471
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,468
Hello, everyone,

472
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,512
and thank you for coming back.

473
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:08,559
I can assure you all the baboons
have been recaptured.

474
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,310
Sleep is a constant battle

475
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,064
between being too hot and too cold.

476
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,066
Well, now that battle is over

477
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:18,778
thanks to adjustable pajama
pant leg things.

478
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,781
[applause]

479
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:27,203
Humans will buy anything.

480
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,123
Yeah, I see there are
some T-nice fans in the house.

481
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,832
They're not clapping for you.

482
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:35,044
They're clapping for me.
I know how to work a runway.

483
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,555
I have to hand it to you, Richie.

484
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,975
No one has ever recovered
from being on the cover

485
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,643
of <i>Washed-up Rich Kids Monthly.</i>

486
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,104
I got to ask, man. How'd you do it?

487
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,731
I have friends
who never stop believing in me.

488
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,900
Friends, huh?

489
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,986
Is there any other way?

490
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:03,739
Perhaps something
involving a sock puppet?

491
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:05,116
I'm afraid not.
