1
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,179
Good afternoon, boys.

2
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:15,265
We're not boys anymore, Irona.
We're men now.

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:22,356
We met the three hottest girls ever.

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,108
They had the mall cop ask us
to stop following them around.

5
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,778
But then we met the three girls
that actually talked to us.

6
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,488
Not only did they talk to us,

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,407
they gave us their phone numbers.

8
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,993
Show her, Murray.

9
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:44,085
Hurry up, we shouldn't expose
the ink to this much light.

10
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,254
Congratulations.

11
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,007
So are you going to call these girls?

12
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,633
Absolutely.

13
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,886
I've been thinking about it
the entire way home,

14
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,804
and I know exactly what I'm gonna say

15
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:55,639
when they answer the phone--

16
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:57,892
"Hello."

17
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,435
Good luck, men.

18
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,604
All right, let's call these ladies.

19
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,691
Hold on, hold on.

20
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,901
[sprays]

21
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,070
Okay, now let's do it.

22
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:13,866
[line trilling]

23
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,242
It's ringing.

24
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,827
I've never gotten this far!

25
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:19,454
Chuckie's Pizza. How can I help you?

26
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,874
They work in a pizza place.

27
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,209
Score!

28
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,253
Yes, hi. I'd like to speak

29
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,464
to the three beautiful teenage
girls you have working there.

30
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,258
Oh, why does every girl
give out our number

31
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,636
to losers they don't want to talk to?

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,431
I-I cannot answer that.

33
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:41,852
But are Vanessa, Vanessa,
and Vanessa there?

34
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,645
Hello?

35
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,940
Man, I did not see that coming.

36
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,900
I did think it was weird that
they wrote their number down

37
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,736
on the pizza-place napkin...

38
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,280
and that all the numbers matched.

39
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,115
- This stinks.
- Our lives are over.

40
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,284
We're never gonna meet girls
like that ever again.

41
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,788
[doorbell rings]

42
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,163
Hello.

43
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,668
Is Richie here?

44
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,880
We're staying in his guest
mansion and wanted to say hi.

45
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,256
[all] I'm Richie.

46
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,719
[cash register dings]
My name is Richie Rich,

47
00:02:15,803 --> 00:02:16,971
and I'm just a normal kid--

48
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,138
except that I have

49
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,473
a trillion dollars.

50
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,683
You see, I used
all the vegetables I never ate

51
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,602
to create a new energy source

52
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,729
and sold it for a lot of money.
[cha-ching]

53
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:28,983
Now I live in a huge mansion
with my own amusement park,

54
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:31,526
race car, and personal robot maid.

55
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,695
And I have my family and
the best friends in the world

56
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,322
to share my fortune with:

57
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,156
my dad,

58
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,825
my jealous sister, Harper,

59
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,367
my money manager, Murray,

60
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,495
and my money spender, Darcy.

61
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,914
I guess you could say,
by not eating my vegetables,

62
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,206
I became the richest

63
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,002
and luckiest kid in the world.

64
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,590
I forgot to mention you now
sponsor the Miss Tween pageant.

65
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,760
I figured it'd be a good investment.

66
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,219
I was right.

67
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,139
Hey, I'm Taylor.

68
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,640
Nice to meet you.

69
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,725
Do you happen to have
an adding machine?

70
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,811
My special talent
is doing corporate taxes,

71
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,938
and I wanted to practice.

72
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:11,358
I know this may sound crazy,
and I know we just met, but...

73
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,610
will you make me
the happiest boy in the world

74
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,363
and accept my adding machine?

75
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,865
A T-96?

76
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,325
Yes, I'd love to!

77
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,996
Hey, there, beautiful.

78
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,246
- My name is--
- I know who you are.

79
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,206
Oh, let me guess.

80
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,249
Bulldozah's son?

81
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,250
No.

82
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,752
T-Nice, the rapper.

83
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,253
Don't toy with me, girl.

84
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,881
Did my dad put you up to this?

85
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,382
Who's your dad?

86
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,261
Wow.

87
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,848
Looks like our friends
are really hitting it off.

88
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,432
Give it time.

89
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,434
It'll fall apart.

90
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:47,477
You're funny.

91
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,645
I'm Eliza.

92
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,271
Nice to meet you.

93
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,273
Can I offer you a water...

94
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,694
a private jet, a private island?

95
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,197
Sorry. I'm--
I'm just trying to impress you.

96
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,074
You don't need to try.

97
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:03,284
Come on, girls, we have a lot
of sequins and sashes to unpack.

98
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,667
- That went pretty well.
- Yeah, they seemed nice.

99
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,711
Not bad.

100
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,046
- Amazing!
- Sick!

101
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,672
Incredible!

102
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,883
Over my dead body!

103
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,300
That could be arranged!

104
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,302
Whoa, ladies, please.

105
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,055
I can't take any more conflict.

106
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:24,431
I just spent the last 20 minutes

107
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,141
getting yelled at by the gardener

108
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,685
for eating the flowers.

109
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:31,438
Well, Richie got two tickets
to meet Harry Styles

110
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,234
that he isn't using, and I am going.

111
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:38,112
No, Master Richie would want me to go

112
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,114
to reward me for all my hard work.

113
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,324
Or work.

114
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,493
Well, I need to go.

115
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,746
The president of Harvard's
daughter's best friend's

116
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,289
coffee barista's therapist's

117
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,041
dog walker's sister will be there.

118
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,252
I have to be there to network.

119
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,670
Guys, there are four of us.

120
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,172
We have two tickets.

121
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,715
We can all go if we cut them in half.

122
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,175
all: No!

123
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:01,927
You shouldn't use those scissors

124
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,721
without adult supervision.

125
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,973
Well, I am going.

126
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,099
I'm going.

127
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:08,267
I'm going.

128
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,477
I'm Tulip.

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,939
You all make compelling cases,
but if only two of you can go,

130
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:18,193
I think there is only one fair,
mature way to handle this.

131
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,531
Tag-team wrestling!

132
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:29,496
Welcome to Cliffmania!

133
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,790
Are those your fire-truck jammies?

134
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,167
No.

135
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,710
Oh, because I have the same ones.

136
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,420
Yeah, they're mine.

137
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,965
Please, T-Nice, will you rap for me?

138
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,301
I think you're really talented.

139
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,095
I love how some of your lyrics make sense.

140
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,471
Oh, you must be talking

141
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,807
about the ones I got from my dad's trash.

142
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,184
Look, D-Nice...

143
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,810
It's Denise.

144
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,104
Either way, you're too good to be true.

145
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,396
Would you like to go out tonight?

146
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,397
I d love to.

147
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,774
Ha! That was a test.

148
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,401
Now I know you're messing with me.

149
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,778
At the grocery store,

150
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,530
I combine the manufacturer's rebate

151
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,406
with the automatic club card savings.

152
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,035
That's 40% off right there.

153
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,621
But I go on Wednesdays,
which are double-savings days.

154
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,458
Boom! 80% off generic dryer sheets.

155
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,418
I do the exact same thing,

156
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,504
except I return those dryer sheets

157
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,423
to a different store for full price.

158
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,218
You can do that?

159
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,969
Not legally.

160
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,222
I love bad boys.

161
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,557
Well, then you wouldn't like me,

162
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,060
'cause I'm a bad man.

163
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,604
So, hey, I was wondering

164
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,648
if you'd like to go out with me tonight.

165
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,025
Like, on a date?

166
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,401
Yeah, but with less awkward pauses.

167
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,862
I can't.

168
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,739
Oh, do you have other plans?

169
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:48,242
No, I have a boyfriend.

170
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,206
We did it,
real dates with real girls

171
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,415
who aren't gonna call the mall cops on us!

172
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,627
It's like a fairy tale,
but we're the princesses.

173
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,754
Okay, I get what you're saying,

174
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,630
but don't ever say it like that again.

175
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,175
- [crying]
- Oh, look at Richie.

176
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,468
He's so excited, he's crying.

177
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,013
Eliza has a boyfriend.

178
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,849
Dang, you scored
the boyfriend label already?

179
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,476
You're moving at warp speed, bro.

180
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,606
No, Eliza has a boyfriend who's not me.

181
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,609
What? That's horrible.

182
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,860
I mean, good for her.

183

00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,756
Well, I have just what the doctor ordered.

365
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:05,757
Clear!

366
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,803
[electricity buzzing]

367
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,012
Let's go.

368
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,065
One!

369
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,025
Two!

370
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,904
Oh, what comes after two?

371
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,448
Whoo!

372
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,449
Oh...

373
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:36,412
[groans softly]

374
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,169
Error. Error. Error.

375
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,754
Shoo!

376
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,547
[imitating guitar playing]

377
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:47,548
- Ha ha!
- So...

378
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,008
how was it?

379
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:53,220
Tell me all about Har...ry.

380
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,766
He is adorbs.

381
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,225
[sighs]

382
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,060
I'm sorry you guys couldn't make it.

383
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,981
I felt bad, 
so I asked himto autograph this poster.

384
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:07,861
Who wants it?

385
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:10,070
It's on!

386
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,781
Ooh. Uh-oh.

387
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,617
[wincing in pain]

388
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,577
Interesting outfit, Richie.

389
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,162
Thanks.

390
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,039
I mean...

391
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,165
whatever.

392
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,584
Disco pirate don't care.

393
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:26,004
Richie, maybe you need some fresh air.

394
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,588
I know I do.

395
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:32,092
Your friend's cologne
smells like garbage fire.

396
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,093
[sighs]

397
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,223
We're gonna go walk the plank.

398
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,892
Oh, spritz for the road?

399
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,267
Or if you're going outside,

400
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,228
it also makes for
a great insect repellent.

401
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,022
I'll take my chances.
[chuckles]

402
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,733
Dangerous, Richie-- I like it.

403
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,108
Oh...

404
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:51,278
bring a sweater.
There's a chill in the air.

405
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,701
Oh, sorry about that, ladies.

406
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,202
How about we go get some ice cream?

407
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:00,246
Great idea. You stay here.

408
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,416
We'll go get it.

409
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,167
Huh. You see that?

410
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,169
Girls only run that fast
when they're in love.

411
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,841
See, Eliza? I'm dangerous.

412
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,176
That's just how I live.

413
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,762
See that wet-floor sign?

414
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,263
Watch this.

415
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,104
I wouldn't try that if I were you.

416
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,356
My knees are soaked.

417
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,275
Why are you acting like this?

418
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,193
What are you talking about?

419
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,487
That's just how I live my life.
[chuckles]

420
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:36,074
That's the fourth wet-floor
sign you've walked me past.

421
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,492
We could eat,
and then go swimming right away.

422
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:41,079
- Richie...
- You're right.

423
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,664
There's dangerous,
and there's just stupid.

424
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,708
Richie, I liked you before,

425
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,168
when you were just being yourself.

426
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,253
Really?

427
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,089
Yeah.

428
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,340
Why'd you change?

429
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:56,761
I guess I'm just insecure.

430
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,304
[sighs]

431
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,766
My first girlfriend did leave me
for a vacuum cleaner.

432
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,350
What?

433
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,311
The point is,

434
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,731
I got nervous when I found out
you didn't have a boyfriend,

435
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,524
because...

436
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,026
I like you.

437
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,195
Well, you have nothing
to be nervous about,

438
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,198
because I like you too.

439
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,118
Eliza, we're leaving.

440
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,329
- Guys, Richie and I were just--
- You don't understand.

441
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,374
Those guys are total losers.

442
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,209
They are so into us.

443
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,544
Obviously, dog.

444
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,046
I just feel bad for Richie.

445
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,840
He doesn't have our swag.

446
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,218
Agreed.

447
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,056
Listen... I like Richie.

448
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,642
Can't you guys just hang in
there for a few more minutes?

449
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,435
No way.

450
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,646
Absolutely not.

451
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,981
I know they're losers,

452
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,817
but I want to spend time with Richie.

453
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,735
Whoa. Losers?

454
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,362
Well, yeah, what would you call them?

455
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,947
My friends.

456
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,782
Look, I'm sorry, Eliza,

457
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,368
but I can't be with someone
who doesn't respect them.

458
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,954
You're a beautiful, cool girl,

459
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,581
but I will not sacrifice my dignity.

460
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,624
[grunts]

461
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,043
Oh!

462
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,671
Ow! I skinned my knee!

463
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,132
Irona, come quick!

464
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,389
Tahj, wake up. I hear someone coming.

465
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,475
It might be our ladies.

466
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,477
Oh, no. I smell my own fear.

467
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,235
Oh, it's just you.

468
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,404
Have you seen Denise and Taylor?

469
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,781
Actually, they went home.

470
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,617
What? What happened?
They were so into us.

471
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,285
They realized they...

472
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,288
couldn't focus on the pageant
being around you guys...

473
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,666
something about being too manly.

474
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,251
Oh, yeah, I get it.

475
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,421
Sometimes I have trouble
focusing on pageants.

476
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,217
Some girls just can't handle
this much Murray.

477
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,259
Oh, so where's Eliza?

478
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,344
Did she realize she made a huge mistake

479
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:05,223
and get back together with her ex?

480
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,350
Pretty much.

481
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,810
So...

482
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,730
should we hit the mall,
go find some more ladies?

483
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,148
I don't know.

484
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,482
Yeah, that harsh mall lighting

485
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,902
will make this mustache look stupid.
