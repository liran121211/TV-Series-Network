I put together a showcase

374
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,661
to introduce the world to the new Swedish.

375
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,287
It's gonna go off without a hitch.

376
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,664
I thought of everything.

377
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,041
Hey, guys. I'm here to help.

378
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,293
Obviously not everything.

379
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,881
Ah... what's up, ladies?

380
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,091
Do you girls doa lot of industry showcases?

381
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,223
Wow. Who are these guys?

382
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,932
They're here to watch you perform.

383
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,769
It's time to introduceSwedish Country Sensation

00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,020
to the world!

385
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:57,438
The world?

386
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,857
Maybe we start small.

387
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,775
Perhaps Cincin-a-naughty?

388
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,402
You're gonna do great.

389
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,986
I don't want you to get nervous,

390
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,406
so just pretend the most
powerful record executives

391
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,324
in the business aren't even here.

392
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,368
What record executives?

393
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,579
Perfect!

394
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,918
Guys, I'd like to introduce to you

Do either of you know how to say,

415
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,771
"Come out from under the couch"
in Swedish?

416
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,397
Forget it.

417
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,151
We have to come up with a plan.

Oh, hey, Harper.

424
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,887
Ready for your first taste of defeat?

425
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,056
It might be hard to chew
with those baby teeth.

426
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,478
You seem pretty cheery
for someone whose best debater

427
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,689
didn't show up to today's debate.

428
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:04,858
What are you talking about?

429
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,484
I'm talking about

430
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,319
two words, five syllables, and--

431
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,571
I looked into it--no hyphen.

432
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,781
Poonam?

433
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,324
What happened to her?

434
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,575
Aw...

435
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:15,827
I will tell you what happened!

436
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,078
She locked me in her closet.

437
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,457
You locked her in your closetagainst her will?

438
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,669
I'm calling the authorities.

439
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,212
Commissioner!

440
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,214
What's going on?

441
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,757
I got a big decision here--

442
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:32,552
roast beef or turkey.

443
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,555
Harper went straight off the deep end

444
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,974
and locked Poonam in her closet

445
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,059
so she could win the league.

446
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,477
Harper!

447
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,897
Oh, you went way too far.

448
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,314
This is the kind of behavior

449
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,525
that got you kicked offyour debate team...

450
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,360
and the soccer team...

451
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,945
and the girl scouts.

452
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,488
But, dad, I--

453
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,865
No.

454
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:55,491
You need to learn how to lose gracefully.

455
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,326
I'm sorry, but due to your actions,

456
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,245
you are no longer my daughter.

457
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,997
What?

458
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,916
I meant you're no longer in the league.

459
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,334
But you're still my daughter.

460
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,127
Love you, sweetie.

461
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,547
Okay, I deserve it.

462
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,173
I shouldn't care so much about winning,

463
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,259
but I guess I'm just too competitive.

464
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,845
Don't you think
you owe someone an apology?

465
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,680
You're right.

466
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,057
Murray, I'm sorry.

467
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,474
I forgive you.

468
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,685
I was talking about me.

469
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,395
I'm the victim here.

470
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,023
Poonam, I'm sorry.

471
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,233
What I did to you was terrible.

472
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,735
And to make it up to you,

473
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,862
you can keep the shoes.

474
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,073
These are my shoes!

475
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,283
You people are crazy!

476
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,163
Well, you know what that means.

477
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,374
I'm still the champion!

I really need your help finding Swedish.

I really need your help building your gift.

482
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,054
It says here, "Attach board to itself."

483
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,181
what does that even mean?

484
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,894
I-I really appreciate all your hard work!

00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,775
You okay?

488
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:14,194
I'm sorry I could notgo through with it, Richie.

489
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,322
I am not a cowman.

490
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,575
It's--it's "boy," but you're right.

491
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,285
I shouldn't have forced youto do something

492
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,703
you didn't want to do.

493
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,122
The last thing I wanted

494
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,124
was to turn you into more of a disaster.

495
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,126
I appreciate that.

496
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,337
I mean, sure, the fire was mine,

497
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,590
but you poured gasoline on it.

498
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,216
I'm so sorry.

499
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,845
I was just trying to help you.

00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,682
I didn't want you weeping
into a plate of meatballs...

501
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,725
which happen to smell amazing.

502
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,435
Would you like one?

503
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,109
Mmm! These are delicious.

504
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,152
Where did you get them?

505
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,945
I did not get. I made.

506
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,072
I didn't know you cook.

507
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,281
I cook when I am stressed...

508
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,491
and when I'm hungry.

509
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,118
I really enjoy it.

510
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,369
Then why do you waste your time

511
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,871
in the music business?

512
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:07,165
Because there's no money in meatballs.

513
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,583
But what if there were?

514
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,586
But there isn't, so...

515
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:16,423
Oh, no. Now I'm getting stressed again!

516
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,052

All I know is that his dad's gonna pay me

521
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,150
so much moneyto keep this off the internet.

522
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:36,861
So what's your good news?

523
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,863

Get them while they're hot!

Everybody, I'd like to introduce you

527
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,620
to my new personal chef...

528
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:47,914
Uh, what's your real name?

529
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,456
Well,

530
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,875
it sounds a little bit like a girl's name.

531
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,959
Come on. What is it?

532
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,961
Rebecca.

533
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:55,213
Can I call you Becky?

534
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,422
That would be weird.

535
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:59,633
That is my papa's name.

536
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,095
Richie, I met someone today...

537
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,096
me!

538
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:10,019
Well, I promised you a memorable showcase.

539
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,396
I'm pretty sure I delivered.

540
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,153
Master Richie, I finishedbuilding your present.

541
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,863
That is a table.

542
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,907
I got you the cuckoo clock.

543
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,326
He is getting a table.

544
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,955
A table is good too.

545
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,165
So what are you whipping up for dinner?

546
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,627
Tonight I was thinking meatballs.

547
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,545
But we just had meatballs.

548
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:37,838
Ja.

549
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,006
That's all I know how to cook.

550
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,550
And boom goes the firecracker.
