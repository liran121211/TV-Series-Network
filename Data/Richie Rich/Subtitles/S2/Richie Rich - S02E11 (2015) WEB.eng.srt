1
00:00:12,095 --> 00:00:13,597
When do we leave for grandma's, again?

2
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,390
Three days.

3
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,644
- Think we packed too early?- Nope.

4
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,103
Hey, guys.

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,897
I got some bad news.

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,191
We're not gonna be ableto take our trip to grandma's.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,860
No!

8
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,069
Dad, we've been sitting here for two days.

9
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:30,823
You don't think you could have told us sooner?

10
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:34,284
We can't go because I got a job.

11
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,578
A j-to-the-o-to-the--

12
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:37,955
ob!

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,915
That's great, dad.

14
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:41,667
What did you get? A crossing guard?

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,793
Toll booth operator?

16
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,212
Uh, crossing guard?

17
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,839
Better.

18
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,924
The aquarium hired me
to play the Wendell the walrus.

19
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:53,178
Oh, dad, it's your dream job.
I am so proud of you.

20
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,346
Thanks.

21
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:56,056
I'm gonna miss you guys.

22
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,183
It's gonna be hard being
away from you all day long.

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,021
We know, dad, but this is a big step for you.

24
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,605
Oh, I was talking to the couch pillows.

25
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,070
[cash register dings]My name is Richie Rich,

26
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,196
and I'm just a normal kid--

27
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,322
except that I have

28
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,782
a trillion dollars.

29
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:15,951
You see, I used all the vegetables I never ate

30
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:17,912
to create a new energy source

31
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:19,997
and sold it for a lot of money.[cha-ching]

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,208
Now I live in a huge mansion
with my own amusement park,

33
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,836
race car, and personal robot maid.

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,963
And I have my family and
the best friends in the world

35
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:29,464
to share my fortune with:

36
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,549
my dad,

37
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,091
my jealous sister, Harper,

38
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,510
my money manager, Murray,

39
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,804
and my money spender, Darcy.

40
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,139
I guess you could say,
by not eating my vegetables,

41
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,600
I became the richest

42
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:42,227
and luckiest kid in the world.

43
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,481
Is that grandma?

44
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:49,276
Nope. That's the mailman.

45
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,819
Is that grandma?

46
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:53,321
No, that's the pool guy.

47
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,573
Is that grandma?

48
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,451
No. That's a hedge.

49
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,037
Oh, here she comes.

50
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,748
Hello, sweeties.

51
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,291
[both] Grandma!

52
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,376
I haven't missed you a bit.

53
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,419
You haven't?

54
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,379
Acting, my dear. Acting!

55
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:13,675
When you are an actor,the world is your stage.

56
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,594
Well, except for Denmark.

57
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:19,431
Those Danes just don't knowgood acting when they see it.

58
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,182
I'm so glad you could make it.

59
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,603
Well, how could I not make it
with this talent and this face?

60
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:28,565
Oh, come. Give me some kisses.

61
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,444
Oh, my flight in brought back
quite a few fond memories.

62
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,489
I was about to play the lead
in <i>Dames of the Sky,</i>

63
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,116
but alas, the director came to me

64
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:41,996
and said I was simply
too beautiful for the part.

65
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,831
Hello.

66
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:47,793
Ah, I want to introduce you
to my new boyfriend, Sigmund--

67
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:51,755
one of the kindest, sweetest,
most handsome men I've ever met.

68
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,548
She really liked me when she found out

69
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,676
I was directing the Boca Vista
retirement community's

70
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:59,013
stage production of<i>Guardians of the Galaxy.</i>

71
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:01,056
Honey, that had nothing to do with anything.

72
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,892
I simply thought casting me as Gamora

73
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:06,561
would allow us to spend more time together.

74
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,313
Nice to meet you, kiddos.

75
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,940
I've got to go figure out a way

76
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,151
to disguise motorized wheelchairs

77
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,194
as intergalactic star fighters.

78
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,279
Vrroom!

79
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,326
Oh, Richie, thank you for flying me in.

80
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,787
Well, we wanted you to be hereto celebrate the big news.

81
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,873
Dad got a job!

82
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:26,874
Hey!

83
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,291
I paid for the airline tickets!

84
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,628
I was supposed to deliver the good news.

85
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,212
Dad got a job.

86
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,592
My Cliffy got a job? I am shocked.

87
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,011
But, of course, I need not say that.

88
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,679
It all plays right here.

89
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,264
I know. I still can't believe it myself.

90
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:45,184
Is he a crossing guard?

91
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,643
Toll booth operator?

92
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,687
Uh, crossing guard?

93
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,564
He's a walrus!

94
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,067
Ah! His dream job.

95
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,610
I'm so happy I could cry.

96
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:56,695
Give me a moment.

97
00:03:58,822 --> 00:03:59,907
[crying]

98
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,579
Richie?

99
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,794
I think we need to talkabout your fashion choices.

100
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,130
They're not his, they're mine.

101
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,757
Although he did pay for them.

102
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,051
Why do you need all these clothes?

103
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,053
I've only got two outfits.

104
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,388
Business Murray and fun Murray.

105
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,432
Which one am I looking at now?

106
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,392
Fun Murray.

107
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,145
You don't understand.

108
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,689
That's because I'm fun Murray right now.

109
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,655
Let's get down to business.

110
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,866
I don't have time for this.

111
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,160
I'm in the middle of a fashion emergency.

112
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,163
All of these clothes are unoriginal.

113
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,750
A fashion icon like meneeds something unique.

114
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,836
Ooh, I have an idea for a unique belt.

115
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,548
How about you wear the anchor
chain from Richie's yacht?

116
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,635
Come on, let's go take a stroll off the pier.

117
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,095
Wait.

118
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,554
I just had a breakthrough.

119
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,848
I think I'm done shopping.

120
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,978
Darcy, if you're serious, I will kiss you.

121
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,562
Or not kiss you!

122
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,149
Whichever makes you more likelyto never shop again.

123
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,358
We're not kissing.

124
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,359
But I'm serious.

125
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,611
I'm done shopping.

126
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,946
Yes!

127
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,572
I'm hiring a personal fashion designer

128
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,950
to handcraft my outfit every day.

129
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,911
No!

130
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,288
Irona!

131
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,001
I am right here, Murray.

132
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,419
I think it's time I teach Darcy a lesson

133
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,547
about her reckless spending.

134
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:42,592
I need you to intercept Darcy's call.

135
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,928
I am sorry, but I can only accept commands

136
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:46,680
from master Richie.

137
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:51,143
Oh, well, Richie asked me to tell you.

138
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,478
How do I know you're telling the truth?

139
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,897
Because when I lie, I sneeze.

140
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,899
[sneezes]

141
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:00,735
That was just a coincidence.

142
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,196
What can I do for you, Murray?

143
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,405
Use your voice modulation software

144
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,616
to pose as a fashion designer.

145
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,244
I am sorry, but for security reasons, I cannot--

146
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:11,496
Richie asked me to tell you.

147
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:12,622
Right away.

148
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,834
Hello, dahling!

149
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,298
So you're a famous fashion designer?

150
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,841
How come I've never heard of you?

151
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:28,722
Because Dissue Alassondoes not answer the phone

152
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,640
for just anyone,

153
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,476
Bobby face.

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,232
Ish now time to do whatever it ish I do.

155
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,983
Aren't you a fashion designer?

156
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,528
You know me so well.

157
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,789
I can blow up those balloons, grandma.

158
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,499
I have strong lungs.

159
00:06:56,583 --> 00:07:01,462
I once played Moby Dick and wasunderwater for six hours.

160
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,798
Okay. I picked up the cake.

161
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,634
I may or may not have dipped my finger

162
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,596
in a frosting walrus.

163
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,932
Whew!

164
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,808
Tough day at the old office.

165
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,769
[all] Surprise!

166
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,063
Mom, what are you doing here?

167
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,274
I brought her in so we couldall spend some time together.

168
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,277
You don't look surprised.

169
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,320
Here, let me help you.

170
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,699
We'll rehearse that later.

171
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,120
Nice to see you, mom,
but I got to run back to work.

172
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,580
There's a real walrus who wants my job.

173
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,458
He's good. He's real good.

174
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,669
It's weird seeing dad out
of the house during the day.

175
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,130
Yeah.

176
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,590
I hope they're not just paying him in fish.

177
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,842
It's happened before.

178
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,928
I'm happy for my son.

179
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,888
He's off to the aquarium.

180
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,683
Those are just two of the films I did in '64.

181
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,437
Who wants tea?

182
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,188
What year did you make that film?

183
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,817
Oh, no, I was just asking if you wanted tea.

184
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,068
Don't be dense, dear.

185
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,283
Grandma... your wig fell off.

186
00:08:11,366 --> 00:08:13,410
What? I don't wear a wig.

187
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,828
Then your completely natural hair

188
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,204
is just hanging on the light.

189
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,790
- Barb?- Ah! Oh!

190
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,417
Sigmund can't see me like this.

191
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,877
He'll leave me for Ethel

192
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,421
from the yoga class.

193
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,547
He's always commenting how limber she is.

194
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,425
She can bend over and touch her knees.

195
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,429
both: Hey!

196
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,513
Sigmund.

197
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,640
Hey, Barb.

198
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,518
It's Harper, her granddaughter.

199
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,980
But her stress lines do make her look 70.

200
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,941
So you want to tour the grounds?

201
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,526
I have a tree house.

202
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:50,822
Ooh. A location scout.

203
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,783
Now, who wants to carry me?

204
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,455
Harper, just set Sigmund down by the door.

205
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,126
You are carrying him back down.

206
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:08,256
both: Dad?

207
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,300
What are you doing here?

208
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:12,344
Welcome to the aquarium!

209
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:18,183
Dad, why would you lie to usabout having a job?

210
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,560
Because I don't want to spenda week with my mom.

211
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,645
All she thinks about is herself.

212
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:25,899
Plus I spent $7,000on this walrus costume.

213
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,279
Dad, grandma Barb loves you.

214
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,864
No, she doesn't.

215
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,700
She proved that at
my third grade talent show.

216
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,453
It was 1983 when...

217
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:44,834
What are you waiting for?Tell the story already.

218
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,586
Sorry.

219
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:50,715
So I had spent months preparing
this cutting-edge dance routine,

220
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,675
but when I finally took the stage,

221
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,719
she was nowhere to be seen.

222
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,804
I burst into tears and I ran out of the building,

223
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,640
and I haven't set foot in a school since.

224
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,061
Well, did you tell grandma how upset you were?

225
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,563
No.

226
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,981
And promise me that you won't either.

227
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,567
I know how much you guys love her,

228
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,235
and how much she loves you,

229
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,487
and I don't want this
to hurt your relationship.

230
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,739
I'm just not ready to forgive her.

231
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,157
Cut!

232
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:19,244
I didn't believe a word you just said.

233
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:23,081
Let's try that again, but with feeling!

234
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,709
[in garbled foreign accent]
Zere!

235
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,963
You look fabulous!

236
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,132
It's definitely unique.

237
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,260
Ish "amashing."

238
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,846
I guess it is "amashing."

239
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,848
What is going on here?

240
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,601
Who is this person

241
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,562
who looks nothing like anyoneI've ever seen before?

242
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:50,400
This is Dissue Alasson,
my personal fashion designer.

243
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,569
That sounds really expensive.

244
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,946
How much is this costing Richie?

245
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:58,825
Is coshen "shoushin obloshin
bloshen" dollarsh a day.

246
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,452
Darcy!

247
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:03,455
How could you spend a shoushin
obloshin bloshen dollars

248
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:04,998
of Richie's a day?

249
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,334
Leave me and Dissue alone.

250
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,669
She has to put the finishing
touches on this outfit,

251
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,254
and then--

252
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:12,880
what did you say you had to do?

253
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,424
Dust.

254
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:18,719
I mean fa-shion!

255
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,805
Well, I can't wait to see you wear

256
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:25,768
that not-ridiculous outfit in public.

257
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,270
Keep up the good work.

258
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,771
I can only keep up the good work--

259
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,398
Richie says keep it up.

260
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,278
We have to tell grandma what's going on.

261
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,988
I can't stand to watch two family members

262
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,615
at odds with each other.

263
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,284
You threw a toasterin my bathtub the other day.

264
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,995
It wasn't plugged in.

265
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,956
Well, we may have promised dad
that we wouldn't tell grandma,

266
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,044
but maybe there's a wayto make him tell her.

267
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,753
Grandma!

268
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:57,467
Sigmund's recastingGamora in the tree house!

269
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,719
That's the role I was born
70 years ago to play!

270
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,932
Good thinking.

271
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,560
You know,

272
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,895
I'm glad that toaster wasn't plugged in.

273
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,105
Thanks, Harper.

274
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,651
Zere!

275
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:18,154
Simply fah-gious!

276
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,739
I don't know about this.

277
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,033
I do.

278
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,702
You look amazing.

279
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,329
You look so good I could kiss you.

280
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,830
Or not kiss you.

281
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,124
Whichever will make youwear that in public.

282
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,418
Not kiss me.

283
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,045
The answer is always not kiss me.

284
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:40,301
You look amashing, Bobby face.

285
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,596
I guess if you guys say so.

286
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,055
Now, if you'll excuse me,

287
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,433
I have to go laugh in the other room.

288
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,893
It's not about you. I promise.

289
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,186
[sneezes]

290
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,149
Kishes, darling.

291
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,818
I must go dust beforemaster Richie gets back.

292
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,738
"Master Richie"?

293
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,575
I mean Ri-chie!

294
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:06,494
I mean fa-shion!

295
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,748
I mean--

296
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,501
Irona?

297
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:16,087
Uh...

298
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,298
sleep mode.

299
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,885
If you'll excuse me,

300
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,803
I have to use the bathroom.

301
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,015
This tree house has a bathroom?

302
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,434
If you'll excuse me,

303
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,893
I have to use the window.

304
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,773
Sigmund!

305
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:38,568
How dare you recast me!

306
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:41,112
Cliffy?

307
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,155
Mom, how'd you get up here?

308
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,864
I pulled up the rope ladder.

309
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,160
She scaled the tree like a jungle cat.

310
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:51,581
No one recasts Barbara Rich.

311
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:54,375
Grandma, there's something Dad needs to tell you.

312
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:56,002
Tattle-tale!

313
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,253
You're grounded!

314
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,132
Out of the tree and into the ground!

315
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,843
Just tell grandma why you've
been sitting up here all day.

316
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,137
You're hiding from me?

317
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,682
What are you, a casting director?

318
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,434
I just wanted to be by myself.

319
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,061
And, uh...

320
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,063
not around you.

321
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,898
I see.

322
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,361
Well, if I'm not wanted here,
then I'm going home.

323
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,987
Exit stage left.

324
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,996
We were just trying to help.

325
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,332
I trusted you.

326
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,210
And you did the opposite of that.

327
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,586
I don't even know what that word is,

328
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,920
but it hurt.

329
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,715
I'm never gonna forget that.

330
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,883
A walrus never forgets.

331
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,844
I think that's an elephant.

332
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,970
What's the difference?

333
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,598
We need to talk aboutyour issue with grandma.

334
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,852
And then we should probably go
over those animal flash cards.

335
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,229
Do you even know what it
feels like to have a parent

336
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,189
who doesn't understand you as a person?

337
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,940
[both] Yes.

338
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,234
Well, you guys can handle that.

339
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,276
I can't.

340
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,070
She really hurt me.

341
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,989
[clapping]

342
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,827
Now that is emotion.

343
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,997
For the first time,
you had me actually believing

344
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,752
you were a damaged walrus.

345
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,628
Now, if you'll excuse me,

346
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:24,716
I need to go rethink everything.

347
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,095
Is he for real?

348
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,806
Guys, you don't understand.

349
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,768
I was so determined to make my mom proud

350
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,187
that I spent months perfecting
my talent show routine.

351
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,981
I stayed up late, I didn't do my homework,

352
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,444
I even skipped class, all for nothing.

353
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,571
I still know all the moves,

354
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,699
but no one's ever gonna see it.

355
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,284
That's not true.

356
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:54,078
If this dance routine
means that much to you,

357
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,247
why don't you perform it for Harper and I?

358
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,332
We'd love to see it.

359
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,543
We certainly would.

360
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,170
For many reasons.

361
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:04,798
Dance for us, dad.

362
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,468
I love you guys.

363
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,094
Now don't move.

364
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,930
I'm gonna go get my fog machineand my jazz shoes.

365
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,935
