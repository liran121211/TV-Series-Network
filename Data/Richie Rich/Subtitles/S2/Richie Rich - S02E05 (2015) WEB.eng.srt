00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,597
Okay, everyone, time to award
the employee of the month.

2
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,891
Sure hope it's not me again.

3
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:19,603
Six in a row would feel a bit gratuitous.

4
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:24,191
Plus, I don't even knowwhat I'd do with another watch.

5
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,526
I just want to thank you guys

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,987
for working so very hard this month.

7
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,447
Especially you, Fritz--my dad wouldn't be here

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,073
if you didn't give him mouth-to-mouth

9
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,619
after he nearly drowned
running through the sprinkler.

10
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,997
Well, he saved your dad,

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,667
but I saved you $4 on your cable bill,

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,502
so...

13
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,671
you know.

14
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,091
Okay, the employee of the month goes to...

15
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,846
Irona.

16
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,138
Irona?

17
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,057
What did she ever do?

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,894
Her dusting skills
have really improved this month.

19
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,480
- How?- She started doing it.

20
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,901
I cannot believe I won.

21
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,695
I accept this award, not for myself,

22
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,781
but for all the little robots out there.

23
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,701
Richie, what is the recount procedure?

24
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,662
Uh, do I write a letter, make a call?

25
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,748
Just tell me how to getthe ball rolling here.

26
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,626
-Murray, please, today's
all about honoring Irona.

28
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:27,796
Doorbell, Irona.

29
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,722
The world press has named meman of the year.

30
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,432
Wow, another award.

31
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,938
I accept this award, not for myself--

32
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,065
Let me see that.

33
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,525
Richie, it's you!

34
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,944
You're man of the year.

35
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,988
Me? Really?

36
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,783
Wow, this is such an amazing honor.

37
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,619
- We should celebrate.- Agreed.

38
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,121
I will plan a partystarting tomorrow morning

39
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:05,834
since we've already establishedtoday is my day.

40
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,586
[cash register dings]My name is Richie Rich,

41
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,796
and I'm just a normal kid--

42
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,922
except that I have

43
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,381
a trillion dollars.

44
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,550
You see, I used all the vegetables I never ate

45
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,510
to create a new energy source

46
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,596
and sold it for a lot of money.
[cha-ching]

47
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,808
Now I live in a huge mansion
with my own amusement park,

49
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:25,562
And I have my family andthe best friends in the world

50
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,064
to share my fortune with:

51
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,148
My dad,

52
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,691
my jealous sister, Harper,

53
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,110
my money manager, Murray,

54
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,403
and my money spender, Darcy.

55
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,448
I guess you could say,
by not eating my vegetables,

56
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,827
I became the richest
and luckiest kid in the world.

57
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,748
This man of the yeargift basket is amazing.

58
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:48,669
Look at all these muffins.

59
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,588
And car keys!

60
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:55,216
Richie, there's a new carout there filled with crumbs

61
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,261
and muffin wrappers.

62
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,015
That is because I'm man of the year.

63
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,933
That's awesome.

64
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:05,310
What does that mean for me?

65
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,105
It's means we all get to go
to the man of the year gala.

66
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,231
Not only is thatthe biggest party of the year,

67
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:13,819
but they have a photo boothwith mustache sticks.

68
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,529
I can't wait.

69
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,574
That sounds like a great excuse
for me to go shopping.

70
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,119
There's my son that I'm so proud of.

71
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,745
Thanks, dad, but, uh,

72
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,580
why'd you bring me flowers?

73
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:29,126
Oh, these are for Fritz.

74
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,211
But I did come in here
to tell you how proud I am

75
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:33,755
about your award.

76
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,757
[chuckles]
I would brag to my coworkers

77
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:40,387
about this, but, you know...

78
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,182
Guys, I hope you're not talking about

79
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:47,144
how I got ripped off forthe employee of the month award.

80
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:51,439
People, you have to get past it.

81
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,609
Guys, earning this award is great, but...

82
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,029
the most important part
is being able to spend time

83
00:03:57,112 --> 00:03:59,156
- with you at the gala.- Gala?

84
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,116
Oh, that's a big, fancy dinner.

85
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,704
Ooh, night lunches. I like night lunches.

87
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,584
What's good, bae?

88
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,128
Ugh, first Richie wins man of the year,

89
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,589
and then you show up?

90
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,799
I just want you to follow me on pictogram.

91
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,760
I'm almost at 10,000 followers.

92
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,220
That won't be happening

93
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:23,346
mainly because I don't like you

94
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,807
but also because I don't use pictogram.

95
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:27,768
You're not on pictogram?

96
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,186
Even my grandmother's on there.

97
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,604
I'm swinging by her place after this

98
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,647
to go beg her to follow me.

99
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,651
Social media is nothing buta mind-numbing waste of time.

100
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,113
Oh, sick, Bradley Steven Perry just posted

101

a picture of a chili dog he's about to eat.

102
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,366
My point exactly.

103
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,869
Posting online is how you stay
relevant in today's society.

104
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,579
Anyone who's anyone is on there.

105

Musicians, Harvard professors, me.

She tagged it for Caturday.

with their cats on Saturdays.

we're going to be sitting with?

00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,494
Any celebrities?

122
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,246
Did they confirmwhether they're going to be

validating parking?

00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,250
Oh, Richie, I have an important question.

125
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,918
Will there be breadsticks?

126
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,796
Yes, there will be breadsticks.

127
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,133
Good, then I won't need to bring these.

- Oh, no.- What is it?

140
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,629
Are they not validating?

141
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,299
Don't worry, my mom can drop us off.

142
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:26,345
It's the official invitation
to the man of the year gala.

143
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,931
I can only bring one guest.

144

Don't worry, you guys.

145
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,810
I'll take a lot of pictures.

146
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,650
Why isn't anyone following me?

00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,988
What is wrong with you people?

148
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,240
Tahj, it's Harper.

149
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,325
Could you come over?

150
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,618
No, this isn't your dad messing with you.

151
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,662
It's really Harper.

What's good, bae?

00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,629
I have been on pictogram for a day now,

154
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,757
and I still don't have a single follower.

155
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,300
Well, you have at least one.

156
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,760
I follow you.

157
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,222
I may have blocked you.

158
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,890
Look, I really need your help.

159
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,184
Nobody has noticed me.It's like I don't exist.

160
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,603
Well, you are asking the right guy.

00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,321
How is that possible?

165
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:27,948
You got to know what to post, baby.

166
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,158

I'm not that desperate.

169
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,372
We'll work up to it.

170
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,040
All right, let's start with a selfie.

171
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,918

really hard to choose whoto take with you to the gala,

00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,136

Hey, go get your own BMX racer, old man.

360
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:08,175
Hey, Irona. You look great.

361
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,428
I'm glad you could bethe one here with me.

362
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,221
Come back, Khloe.

363
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,181
Look, a wall.

364
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,601
Yes, it is.

365
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,519
This is America.

366
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,815
Nowhere in the constitution
does it say I cannot

367
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:26,527
fill a plastic bag upwith bacon-wrapped scallops.

368
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:28,028
Do you know what's
on the other side of that wall?

369
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,530
No? A restroom,

370
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,908
which just so happens to have

371
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:36,078
the fanciest automated
hand dryers on the market.

372
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,956
No.

373
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,041
My hands do feel a bit dirty.

374
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,211
Whew.

375
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,506
Don't worry. He's with me.

376
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,551
And just to be clear,he's the only one with me.

377
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,261
Thanks for that, Richie.

378
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,807
That guy was way out of line.

379
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,810
Murray, I think you're leaking spring rolls.

380
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,437
Thanks.

381
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,024
[cha-ching]

382
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,151
What is up with this pictogram thing?

383
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,486
I did everything you said,

384
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,488
and I still only have three followers.

385
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,990
You have three. That's a start.

386
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,741
I have a sneaking suspicion

387
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,661
that the Tahj, T-Nice,and Tahj-Barrage accounts

388
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,037
are all the same person.

389
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,039
Sometimes girls block one account

390
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,457
but don't realize I have more tha--

391
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,502
I mean, yeah, I suppose it's possible.

392
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,087
I just don't understand how you have--

393
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,216
20,000 followers? Who are these people?

394
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,301
People who love me. Fans, really.

395
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:36,055
I call them t-nicesters.

396
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,307
So this guy, "follow for cash,"

397
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,600
is a "t-nicester"?

398
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,229
Uh, yeah.

399
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:45,815
That's-- that's my homie from way back.

400
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,568
Yeah, it's actually pronounced folo cash.

401
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,194
The "for" is silent.

402
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,531
You pay for all your followers?

403
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,701
Yes, except for my grandma.

404
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,245
Okay, I paid her too.

405
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,163
I can't believe I've beenlistening to you this whole time

406
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,207
and all of your followers are fake.

407
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,001
That is it. I'm done.

408
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,419
[elevator dings]

409
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,295
This has been the biggest waste of my time.

410
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:11,090
Pictogram is a joke.

411
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,927
This obsession with
impressing strangers for likes

412
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,302
is the decay of our society.

413
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,388
Well, you know what I don't like?

414
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,390
I don't like seeing your catplay the piano.

415
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,684
I don't like seeing your food
that you're about to eat.

416
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:24,353
And what I don't like--
[grunting]

417
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:25,855
[screams]Tahj!

418
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,107
Put down the phone! My hair is stuck!

This is awesome.

425
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,957
Yeah, you have over 2 million followers.

426
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,250
And I didn't pay for a single one.

00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,923
Irona, it's okay.

00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,341
There are other hand dryers out there.

430
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,721
I am done with them.They are so full of hot air.

431
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,056
You know what?

432
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,641
If you are emotionally ready,

433
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:05,686
I did see an ATM out in the lobby, and he is loaded.

434
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,315
- Do I look--- Yep, go.

435
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,400
Hey, Darcy.

436
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,736
Did you get that picwith Khloe Kardashian?

437
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,406
Not a good one. Kourtney photobombed it.

438
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,492
Oh.

439
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:24,413
Did I just hearHarry Styles under the table?

440
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,206
Harry, it's you.

441
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,292
I'm your biggest fan.

442
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,003
Did I just hear Darcy?

443
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,004
No!

444
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,672
Why would she be here

445
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,843
when you're obviously
my one and only guest?

446
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,095
How was I supposed to know you
weren't done with your steak?

447
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,890
You put your fork down.

448
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:46,519
Um, Dad, where'd your helmet go?

449
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,605
One of these billionairesmust have stolen it.

450
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,942
Have you seen my helmet? Have you?

451
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:57,404
Murray, put the prime minister's food down.

452
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,242
Why is your backpack moving?

00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,744
Oh, don't worry about it.

454
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,205
But on a completely unrelated note,

455
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,332
tomorrow night you are welcome at my place

456
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,127
for lobster a la backpack.

your backpack for my helmet.

of seafood in there.

Hey, I'm trying to have a conversation

465
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:29,854
with Harry Styles under there.

466
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,732
- Mr. Rich?- Darcy?

467
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:35,902
- Murray?- That ATM is a jerk.

468
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:38,779
- Irona?- Mr. Rich?

469
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,406

00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,454
- Me, too.- Sounds familiar.

473
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:50,290
I think you said that, butI'm in a lot of pain right now.

474
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,001
I--

475
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:54,170
I guess we should probably do this now.

00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,672

00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,097
I'm really sorryfor ruining your guys' evening.

479
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,182
But I was only allowed one guest,

480
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,350
and I couldn't pick betweenthe most important people

481
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:10,103
in my life.

482
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:14,356
They're the only reason I'm up here today.

483
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,026
- Thanks, Richie.- That was really sweet.

484
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,862
if I had feelings, I would probably be feeling something

485
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,739
right now.

486
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,866
Richie, next time just be honest.

487
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,743
This night isn't about us.

488
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,079
We could have worked it outbetween ourselves.

489
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,580
- Right?- Yes.

490
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:34,127
- Absolutely.- Yeah, I guess if we had to.

491
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,962
Thanks for always looking out for me.

492
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:40,216
You guys are the best.[all] Aww.

493
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,926
Thanks again for the award.

494
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,469
I really appreciate it.

495
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,345
Oh, and by the way,

496
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,307
they wanted me to say
that we are out of lobster,

497
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,893
and I apologize to the tables

498
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,352
who no longer have salt shakers.

499
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,814
And there will be no dessert.

00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,399
Start the car, Mom!
