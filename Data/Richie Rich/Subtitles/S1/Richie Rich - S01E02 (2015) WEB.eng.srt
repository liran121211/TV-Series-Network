00:15:36.143 --> 00:15:37.478  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

That can't be true.

00:16:22.607 --> 00:16:23.817  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That is it.

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.701  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:16:33.785 --> 00:16:37.747  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Taylor Swift just outbid me

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:04.148  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Ask for anything,

00:17:04.231 --> 00:17:07.861  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

How about "let us go?"

00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:16.285  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or at least a few cans of shark repellent.

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:21.541  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Given the fact that we're
about to be fed to a shark,

00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:22.834  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:19:16.489 --> 00:19:17.490  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Brilliant.

No, I am Tulip.

You are Harvard material.

How would you like to spend the summer

00:19:28.417 --> 00:19:31.295  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Thank you so much. I totally
thought I blew this interview.

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:33.089  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You did. I was talking to your friend.

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, in that case,
excuse me for just a second.

Good last request--

00:19:48.354 --> 00:19:52.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you wouldn't want to be eaten

Not something
I need to worry about anymore.

00:19:57.404 --> 00:19:59.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Oh, no! Look, everyone,
your country is flooding!

435
00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.039  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

finally safe from rising seas!

00:20:09.876 --> 00:20:11.627  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But then again,

438
00:20:11.711 --> 00:20:14.130  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought we'd also have
blue sports drink by now too.

439
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.632  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Check it out!
I got more blue sports drink.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.762  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
'Cause if it is,
I had nothing to do with it.

00:20:21.846 --> 00:20:24.348  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
What if I told you
I know of a spacious place

443
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:26.600  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that will always remain above sea level?

444
00:20:26.684 --> 00:20:29.645  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Would you let us go
and move your country there?

00:20:29.729 --> 00:20:32.356  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's not Denmark, is it?
Because we've discussed it--

00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:34.483  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We'd rather take our chances in the water.

447
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.027  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm offering to buy a yacht

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:38.196  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
big enough for you and your people.

449
00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:40.740  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Can we take this cart full
of blue sports drink with us?

450
00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:42.742  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

I don't know.
I mean, I'd be missing my kids.

453
00:20:48.206 --> 00:20:50.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, you're not coming with us.

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:53.502  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But you can push the cart to the boat.

00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.171  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:57.339  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now can you get us out of this thing?

457
00:21:03.763 --> 00:21:05.765  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sweet, sweet Harper,

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:09.268  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just wanted you to know,
despite our occasional quip,

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:13.647  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:21:15.399 --> 00:21:17.693  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What do you want?

00:21:17.777 --> 00:21:19.695  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It occurs to me you might enjoy writing

462
00:21:19.779 --> 00:21:22.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:25.618  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Did I mention you smell terrific?

00:21:25.701 --> 00:21:28.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Go away. It's too late.

465
00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:31.540  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you're planning on wearing
that outfit to school, to prom,

466
00:21:31.624 --> 00:21:34.460  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:37.213  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So Tahiti, five to six pages?
