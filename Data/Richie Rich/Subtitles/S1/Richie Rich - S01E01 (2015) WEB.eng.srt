- Ahh!
- Ahh!

00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,184
- [crash] 
- Sorry, guys!

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,687
I'm still getting used
to driving inside a mansion.

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,730
And driving.

6
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,234
Are you guys okay?

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:28,779
I'm good. The airbag broke my fall.

8
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,824
Darcy, the wagon doesn't have an airbag.

9
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,075
I meant Murray.

10
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,789
After that collision,
I need to make an appointment

11
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:41,625
with my chiropractor...

12
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,628
and my attorney.

13
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,131
Could have sworn my bedroom
was around here somewhere.

14
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:52,093
Let's ask her for directions.

15
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,304
That's Irona, my maid.

16
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,224
Wow. You are really hot.

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,394
My electrostatic super
capacitor tends to overheat.

18
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,731
Guess I should have mentioned
she's also a robot.

19
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,274
I splurged on the supermodel model.

20
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:10,111
I've never uttered these words in my life,

21
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:13,448
but money well spent.

22
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:17,160
This is Murray, my best friend
and money manager.

23
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,621
And this is Darcy, my other best friend.

24
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,874
Don't let her see my bank password.

25
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,125
We'll talk later.

[cha-ching]

27
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:27,629
Welcome to Richie's bedroom.

28
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:32,051
Wow! This place is awesome!

29
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,427
I can't believe you live here now.

30
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,180
I can't believe you paid for all of this!

31
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,307
Check it out.

32
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,227
It's got a dollar comforter.

33
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,562
You mean down?

34
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,982
No, I mean it's filled with dollars.

35
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,984
Master Richie's entire room is automated

36
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,780
and can be controlled by a push
of a button on his room remote.

37
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,281
Or roomote.

38
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,490

Giggle.

40
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,494
Is that an aquarium?

41
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:01,997
Yep! Meet my new pet whales:

42
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:05,375
Dollar, Dollar, and Bill, y'all!

43
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,462
All you need is a bubbling treasure chest.

44
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,464
Over there.

45
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,340
Is that real gold?

46
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:17,262
And on a completely unrelated
note, do you have a snorkel?

[cash register dings]

48
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,516
My name is Richie Rich,

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,517
and I'm just a normal kid...

50
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:23,685
except that I have

51
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:24,895
a trillion dollars.

52
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,313
You see, I used all the vegetables

53
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,149
I never ate to create a new energy source

54
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,151
- and sold it for a lot of money.
- [cha-ching]

55
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,736
Now I live in a huge mansion

56
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,280
with my own amusement park, race car,

57
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,240
and personal robot maid.

58
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:38,826
And I have my family and the best friends

59
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,619
in the world to share my fortune with.

60
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,330
My dad, my jealous sister Harper,

61
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,748
my money manager Murray,

62
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,001
and my money spender Darcy.

63
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,586
I guess you could say
by not eating my vegetables,

64
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,838
I became the richest

65
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,256
and luckiest kid in the world!

00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,802
[clattering]

67
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,222
Gold bar?

68
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,308
I wanted a candy bar!

69
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,978
Stupid machine...

[mouthing words]

71
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:12,317
Richie, I feel like
you're throwing money away.

72
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:15,863
Did get this basketball for free.

73
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,280
That's great!

74
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:18,657
When I bought
a professional basketball team.

75
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,660
Ugh!

76
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,078
I'm glad we still hang out,

77
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,538
even though you're rich now.

78
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,790
Of course! We're best friends.

79
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,043
Now, check this out!

80
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:33,212
Air ball!

81
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,673
No more air balls for me!

82
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,052
My engineers invented this
never-miss basketball hoop...

83
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,304
after seeing my jump shot...

84
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,270
Sick!

85
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,107
If you think that's cool,
you should see the bathrooms.

86
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:56,111
They were able to use the same
technology on the toilets!

87
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,405
Master Richie, I just received
a message from your father.

88
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,324
[father's voice] "Richie, please
come into the living room."

89
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,328
Irona, I know you have
the voice modulation software,

90
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,873
but please don't speak in my dad's voice.

91
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,291
Totally ruins the magic.

92
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,877

00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,342
Uh, ha-ha... Dad?
This isn't our old house.

96
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,386
You don't have to sleep in the living room

97
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,805
or shower in the neighbor's sprinklers.

98
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,600
Richie, I'm a man
who doesn't require luxuries

99
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:29,436
like beds or indoor plumbing.

100
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,105
I can be happy on a couch.

101
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,647
I have to be, since I can't figure out

102
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,026
how to get in my bedroom with
that high-tech entry system.

103
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,736
It's just a doorknob.

104
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,489
And what's that crazy-looking
eye scanner device?

105
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,158
A peephole?

106
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:46,327
- Oh!
- [elevator bell dings]

107
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,371
Richie.

108
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,541
My room looks exactly
like the Harvard library.

109
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,544
And while I might appreciate
having a full-time librarian,

110
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,923
I wish she wouldn't shush me
every time I speak.

111
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,091
Shh!

112
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:01,760
I am not even in my room!

113
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,098
Harper, I knew how hard you've
been working to get in Harvard

114
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,642
so I thought
if I made your dream come true,

115
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,186
it'd make you happy!

116
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,272
You don't seem happy.

117
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,482
I want to get into the actual Harvard,

118
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,735
not a replica my slacker brother built.

119
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,487
It's not a replica!

120
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,448
I bought the actual library
building and had it moved here.

121
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,783
Well, most of it...

122
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,367
the crane dropped one of the walls,

123
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,912
so we had to replace it
with plywood and spackle.

124
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,371
[chortling]

125
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,291
Spackle.

126
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,002
That's a funny word.

127
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,505
Dad, I can't handle living
in this monument

128
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,591
to Richie's pathetically lucky success.

129
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,593
You should be happy for your brother.

130
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,971
Not only did he make a gajillion dollars,

131
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,765
but that doodad he invented
did something...

132
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,143
good for the planet.

133
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,687
Eliminated the need for carbon-based fuel.

134
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,522
Yeah, that.

135
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:59,567
All Richie did was catch
lightning in a bottle!

136
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:01,486
Literally! He just crammed
a bunch of uneaten vegetables

137
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,614
into a bottle that happened
to get struck by lightning.

138
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,408
Are you accusing me
of not knowing what I was doing

139
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,828
when I invented my
trap-electricity-in-vegetables

140
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,331
thingamajig?

141
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,498
Dad.

142
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,334
Why did you want to see us?

143
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,627
See you? I don't know.

144
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,378
Oh, wait, yeah, uh...

145
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,631
so I wanted to spend
some quality time together.

146
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,508
I feel really disconnected here.

147
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,426
What if we had a family dinner?

148
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,012
A family dinner?

149
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,472
Why am I being punished?

150
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:33,476
[cha-ching]

151
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,355
Guess what?

152
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,564
I hacked into your bank account

153
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:41,442
and had you buy you
a vertical wind tunnel.

154
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,862
BTW, your password was really weak,

155
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,073
so I went ahead and changed it for you.

156
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,200
Okay, what's the new one?

157
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,535
For security reasons, I can't tell you.

158
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,997
Richie, we have a problem.

159
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,582
It's your new jet.

160
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,667
Don't tell me
there are more engine issues.

161
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:02,256
Apparently, a solid gold jet
has trouble staying in the air.

162
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,259
#trillionaireproblems.

163
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:09,763
Jet or no jet,
we can still skydive with this.

164
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,805
Ahh!

165
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:11,890
[crash]

166
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,226
Aah!

167
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:17,312
Oh, no! Darcy crashed through the ceiling!

168
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,563
It's worse than you think.

169
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,482
Right above my room is a gorilla habitat.

170
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,444
[gorilla noises]

171
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,614
Of all the days to wear banana lip gloss.

172
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,243
You're in good hands, Darcy.

173
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,205
I downloaded an entire medical
library on Irona's hard drive.

174
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,541
Now, she's practically a doctor.

175
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,544
Before I do any more,
I will need proof of insurance.

176
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,717
Darcy, I feel bad that you
blasted through the ceiling

177
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,011
into my gorilla habitat...

178
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:53,307
and that my ceiling fan was on high.

179
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,558
I want to do something
to make this up to you.

180
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,727
I have just the thing!
A coupon for a free lemonade

181
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,439
at Corndog Larry's.

182
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,900
How about I score us three passes

183
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,361
to a concert of a lifetime?

184
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:11,741
Like the one and only U.S. show
of Swedish house sensation

185
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,368
Swedish House Sensation!

186
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,454
That's awesome!

187
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,664
He's the best deejay in the world!

188
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,957
Ow...

189
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,835
It hurts to get excited.

190
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,711
Maybe you didn't hear me.

191
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:24,671
Coupon.

192
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,131
Free lemonade.

193
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,715
Free.

194
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:29,926
[cha-ching]

195
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,972
Murray told me
you bought the concert tickets

196
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,557
and exactly how much they cost.

197
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,726
I can't wait for tomorrow night!

198
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,270
Me neither!

199
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:43,064
Now I just have to find
something to wear...

200
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,275
Irona, to the mall.

201
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,738
Richie.

202
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,700
I feel like you, Harp,
and I are drifting apart,

203
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,577
so I'm reinstituting
an old family tradition.

204
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:00,540
Dad, Harp and I are too old
to take baths together.

205
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:05,128
Starting tomorrow, I'm
bringing back family game night.

206
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,089
Tomorrow? I can't! I have plans!

207
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,884
Richie, when we moved here, we agreed.

208
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,678
Your house, my rules.

209
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,679
Cancel your plans.

210
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,181
Please!

211
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,683
I'd be willing to revisit the bath thing.

212
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,645
Of all the nights to have
a stupid family game night,

213
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,191
my dad picks the one night
I have concert tickets.

214
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,608
Spending quality time with family

215
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,945
is important for maintaining
meaningful relationships.

216
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,406
You may have a motherboard,

217
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,991
but you don't have to act like my mother.

218
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,451
Apologies, Master Richie.

219
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,662
Pops be straight trippin', yo.

220
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,166
Hey, Richie.

221
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,045
Guess who just beat Murray
in a game of HORSE--

222
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,258
the girl who can't use her extremities!

223
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,677
Well, I have some bad news
about Swedish House Sensation.

224
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:59,849
Oh, no. Don't tell me he's not going
to perform <i>'Bout Them Meatballs!</i>

225
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,268
I love that song.

226
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,854
The beat makes me move my feet
like a wild man.

227
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:11,445
The problem is, 
we can't go to the concert.

228
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,446
What?

229
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:17,242
Why? Do you have plans with
some new fancy rich friends?

230
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,868
By the way, if they need a money manager,

231
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,620
here's my card.

232
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,705
I knew once you became rich
you wouldn't want

233
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,624
to hang out with us anymore.

234
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,086
Those gorillas may have broken
84 of my bones,

235
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,505
but you broke my heart.

236
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:32,507
You didn't let me finish.

237
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:36,719
I was saying we can't go to the concert...

238
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:38,846
because it's gonna be here.

239
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,889
In my room.

240
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,266
It is?

241
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,768
That's the plan.

242
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,020
That I just came up with.

243
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,815
Master Richie, may I have a word?

244
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,735
I do not understand.

245
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,529
Are you canceling family game night?

246
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,697
Nope. I'm going to both.

247
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,493
I do not think that is a wise--

248
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,911
[ahem]
Get yours, son.

249
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,538
Word.

250
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,127
Hello! I am Swedish house sensation

251
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,213
Swedish House Sensation!

252
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,549
Whoa! Hello, you fine piece of

253
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,552
reinforced titanium alloy.

254
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:21,848
You are sure easy on the
multispectral optical sensors.

255
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,225
You are "bootiful" yourself,

256
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:30,773
but I must say,
there is a Mrs. House Sensation.

257
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,361
So what is having
Richie Rich bring me here?

258
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,447
He was hoping to convince you
to move tomorrow's show here.

259
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,697
Are you suggesting...

260
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,327
Oh, it... it's so hot in zis helmet.

261
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,911
You are human?

262
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:48,249
I am sorry, but moving
my concert here is not possible.

263
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,461
Maybe this will change your mind.

264
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,674
I will be here at 7:00.

265
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,925
But I cannot stay for after-party.

266
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,761
If I'm not home in time
for family game night,

267
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,764
my papa will give me
a swift kick in ze rumpa!

268
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:11,398
[background chatter]
[dance music playing]

269
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,608
Murray, where's Darcy?

270
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:14,942
I want to say hi before game night.

271
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,278
Game night? You mean the concert?

272
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,906
Guys! How do I look?

273
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,913
Oh... my... gauze.

274
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,832
I ordered a custom couture body cast

275
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,834
so I wouldn't look like an idiot.

276
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,505
Hope you kept the receipt.

277
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,964
Master Richie.

278
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,967
1 minute and 53 seconds
until family game night.

279
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:44,305
And about 5 minutes until I
put the moves on that amplifier.

280
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,351
Got to get out here...

281
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,810
You know, Murray. It occurs to me.

282
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,813
This concert's gonna add a lot
to my electricity bill.

283
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,233
You're right. How did I miss that?

284
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,402
Permission to dock my pay?

285
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,653
Don't worry about it.

286
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,905
I have an idea to recoup some cash!

287
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,408
Souvenir sales!

288
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,868
How about you start all the way
across the room,

289
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,995
then make your way
to the other side of the room,

290
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,750
avoiding this general vicinity?

291
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,919
Souvenirs! Get your bobbleheads here!

292
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,965
- [mic feedback]
- Hello, Richie Rich's bedroom!

293
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,841
[crowd whooping]

294
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,970
Thanks again, Richie.
Even though I can't see you,

295
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,389
because I can't turn my neck.

296
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,808
It means a lot
having you right by my side.

297
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,605
Yep. Right by your side.

298
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,899
That's where I'll be, all night.

299
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,278
Richie? Are you still there?

300
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,571
[Richie's voice]
Of course.

301
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,031
I'm right here, Darcy.

302
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,994
Do you think that amplifier
likes long walks on the beach?

303
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,294
Game night!
Time for some family bonding!

304
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,921
You're lucky I'm in a rush
to get this over with.

305
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,508
Otherwise I would take the time
to strangle you.

306
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,511
Okay, Harper's in the spirit.

307
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,053
This is all your fault.

308
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,847
I could be out doing something
fun with my Friday night,

309
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:12,893
like studying, if you hadn't
become Mr. Rich and Famous.

310
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,395
Okay, for the record,

311
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,815
I've been Mr. Rich since I was born.

312
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,860
Until last week, the name
was just tragically ironic.

313
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:25,699
Okay, time to play
Duck, Duck, Hippopotamus!

314
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,700
You mean "goose"?

315
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,284
I mean hippopotamus.

316
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,411
I couldn't find a goose costume.

317
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,997
- [both] Costume?
- Mm-hmm.

318
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,917
I thought the game would be more fun

319
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,919
if we all got into parts.

320
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,215
Maybe I will take the time
to strangle you.

321
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,759
- [muffled music]
- What's that booming noise?

322
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,969
Sounds like bass from a concert.

323
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,348
Concert? Ha... who has
a concert in their house?

324
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:55,478
That's... construction workers I
hired to hammer out the spackle.

325
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,773
[chuckles] Spackle.

326
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,692
So you guys ready to play?

327
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,443
Not really.

328
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,362
[cell phone "cha-ching" alert]

329
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,534
Uh-oh.

330
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,494
I'm not feeling too well.

331
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,037
I need a bathroom.

332
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,125
For everyone's sake, I'm gonna
use the one in the south wing.

333
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,088
[tires screeching]

334
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,965
Got your text. What's the emergency?

335
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,927
Your friend Darcy's very boring.

336
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,596
What?

337
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,389
You called me up here for that?

338
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,894
Well, that and Swedish House
Sensation keeps asking for you.

339
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,020
Is Richie Rich in ze house?

340
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,315
I would hope so, since it is his house.

341
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,484
Of course he's here!

342
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:45,695
He's right by my side.

343
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,030
Yep, been here all night.

344
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,618
Richie! Get up here and shake your rumpa!

345
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,621
This night's been a pain in my rumpa.

346
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,205
Incoming message from your sister:

347
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:58,165
[in Harper's voice]
"Richie, get back here!"

348
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:01,210
Okay, remember what I said
about my dad's voice

349
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,003
ruining the magic?

350
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,591
It's even more disturbing
when you use my sister's.

351
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,009
[all] Richie! Richie! Richie!

352
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,053
Murray! I need you to dance for me!

353
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,432
Put on my jacket and this mask
and make me look cool.

354
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,851
I can do two of those things.

355
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,854
[all] Richie! Richie!

356
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,731
Richie! Richie!

357
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,983
I'm back!
