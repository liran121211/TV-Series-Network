00:05:19.153 --> 00:05:22.197  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because I have two lips.
One above my chin,

106
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:24.741  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and one under
my breathing holes.

107
00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:27.161  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think I love you.

108
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.288  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is Harper here?
I need her help.

109
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.747  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Haven't seen her,

110
00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.374  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but I'm sure I could be
your knight in pleated khakis.

111
00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:35.794  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm about to fail math,
and if I do,

112
00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:38.421  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
the school's going
to kick me off the soccer team.

113
00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:40.507  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I can help,
because I happen to specialize

114
00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.970  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
in numerical concepts
and statistical application.

115
00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.764  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I need help in math.

116
00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.142  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, I have to ask:

117
00:05:50.225 --> 00:05:52.519  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Would you mind taking a selfie with me?

118
00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:54.395  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're exactly the kind of girl

119
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.941  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've always dreamt
of telling people I was dating.

120
00:05:59.193 --> 00:06:02.570  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Guys, I have something really
important to talk to you about.

121
00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.531  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I need to go away for the night.

122
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.533  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Big things are finally
starting to happen for me,

123
00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:08.035  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I think you guys are going to be

124
00:06:08.118 --> 00:06:09.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
really proud of your old man.

125
00:06:09.661 --> 00:06:11.579  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Did you get a job?
- A girlfriend?

126
00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:12.539  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Better!

127
00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.458  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I got first pick
in my fantasy football draft!

128
00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.252  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who's watching us?

129
00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:20.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You are not dropping us off
at the kennel again.

130
00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.008  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
How was I supposed to know
it was a place for dogs?

131
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.593  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The ad said it was a place
to leave loved family members

132
00:06:25.677 --> 00:06:29.556  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
to be fed, bathed, and dipped
for fleas and ticks.

133
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.227  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Tell me we can just stay here.
- That's the plan.

134
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.978  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I figured Harper could be in charge.

135
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:36.479  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yes!
- No!

136
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:37.814  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You can't do this to me.

137
00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.774  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't need Harper
to tell me what to do.

138
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.735  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have Irona.

139
00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:45.364  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, because that is how
our relationship works.

140
00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:47.406  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, you'll do what your sister says,

141
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.868  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
or I'll take Irona away for two months.

142
00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- No!
- Two months off?

143
00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.454  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I guess I could live with that punishment.

144
00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:55.623  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, you won't exactly be off.

145
00:06:55.707 --> 00:06:57.376  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You'll be helping me. For starters,

146
00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.627  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you can shave the bunions off my feet.

147
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.420  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No!

148
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:05.424  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You know, Dad, the kennel's
not sounding so bad after all.

149
00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.595  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I think we have a good plan.
Out you go, dad.

150
00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:12.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Whatever Harper says, goes,
because she's the boss.

151
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.059  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is that how that works?

152
00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:17.145  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't know, I've never had
a boss before.

153
00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:22.276  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Heel.

154
00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:28.448  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Irona, I refuse to wear a leash.

155
00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.242  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It was different at the kennel

156
00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:32.077  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
because they made it up to me
in belly rubs.

157
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.496  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm just making sure you
keep in line with your sister.

158
00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.459  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Do an image search for bunions,
you will understand.

159
00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.503  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Relax, Harper's only in charge
for two days.

160
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:45.006  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She may be jealous of my success,

161
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but she's not crazy.

162
00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:50.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Out of my room.
- Uh, this is my room.

163
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:52.472  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, this used to be your room.

164
00:07:52.555 --> 00:07:55.934  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But now I'm moving into it
because I'm in charge.

165
00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Out you go.

166
00:07:57.518 --> 00:08:00.272  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You heard the girl. Out we go.

167
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:01.815  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Do you really expect me
to give up my room

168
00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.485  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
to go sleep in yours?
It's pink and smells like evil.

169
00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.570  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who said anything about my room?

170
00:08:07.654 --> 00:08:09.364  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're bunking in the elevator.

171
00:08:09.448 --> 00:08:11.450  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Fine, whatever. Come on, Irona.

172
00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:12.492  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ah, ah, ah.

173
00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.494  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're not going anywhere, Irona.

174
00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
From now on, you don't listen to him.

175
00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:19.374  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You only do what Harper says.

176
00:08:19.458 --> 00:08:22.710  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This-- This is ridiculous!

177
00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.380  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wait!

178
00:08:25.464 --> 00:08:27.257  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I love you, Master Richie.

179
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:30.551  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Don't you do that.
Don't you say your good-byes.

180
00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:33.138  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I am so cold.

181
00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.515  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Never let go. Promise me.

182
00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:37.767  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And never let go of that promise.

183
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:39.144  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I promise.

184
00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:43.273  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My heart will go on and on and on...

185
00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:47.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Stop reciting lines from <i>Titanic.</i>

186
00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:50.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Irona, you don't even have a heart.

187
00:08:52.824 --> 00:08:54.368  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't know why I have to learn

188
00:08:54.451 --> 00:08:55.743  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
these complex formulas anyway.

189
00:08:55.827 --> 00:08:58.538  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm never going to use this stuff
in real life.

190
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:02.334  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tulip, you can do this. One plus one...

191
00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:08.173  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Here's a hint: The answer's in your name.

192
00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:11.551  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Steinhoff.

193
00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.887  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, let's just say you and I
ended up married,

194
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.973  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
assuming you agree to keeping
our finances separate,

195
00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:21.602  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and we had a boy and a girl.
How many children would we have?

196
00:09:24.814 --> 00:09:26.525  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yes!
- Yes!

197
00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:28.693  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You said, "Yes"!

198
00:09:28.776 --> 00:09:30.611  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now, before we start
the wedding planning,

199
00:09:30.695 --> 00:09:33.614  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
you're going to need
to meet my mother.

200
00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.616  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just tell her her brisket is moist.

201
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.412  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It won't be. Just tell her it is.

202
00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.415  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're a funny little man.

203
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:44.209  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I said "yes" because the pencil works.

204
00:09:44.292 --> 00:09:46.044  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's good, isn't it?

205
00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:49.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wouldn't say it's as good
as an acceptance

206
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.466  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
of my subtle marriage proposal,

207
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.343  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Hello, my little angel.

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:01.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:16:02.002 --> 00:16:04.547  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No! How is this possible?

00:16:09.302 --> 00:16:12.806  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Yes, and I still failed.
Not only did I get a 0%,

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:15.224  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but the teacher made it

00:16:15.308 --> 00:16:19.103  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This doesn't make any sense.

00:16:19.186 --> 00:16:21.606  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, but don't look at the frowny face.

339

"Identify the verb in the sentence"?

00:16:31.115 --> 00:16:33.993  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I put three, but he still marked it wrong.

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:36.871  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Three isn't a verb. It's a number.

00:16:36.955 --> 00:16:39.582  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And this isn't a math test. It's grammar.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:41.041  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:09.612  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Richie locked me in there.
He is out of control.

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:14.241  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You need to take away his robot
and make her shave your bunions.

355
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.243  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Actually, the one who was
out of control is Harper.

356
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:19.246  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
She took over Richie's bedroom,
banished him to the elevator,

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:22.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and made me wear this degrading pantsuit.

00:17:23.918 --> 00:17:25.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Harper, why are you talking like that?

360
00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:28.297  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Because I am in charge now.

361
00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:32.426  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And for dramatic effect.
Mostly dramatic effect.

362
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.220  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Harper, I trusted you.

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.597  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought you were mature enough
to look after your brother,

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:38.098  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and clearly you're not.

365
00:17:38.182 --> 00:17:40.059  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I hoped you would take that
responsibility more seriously

00:17:40.142 --> 00:17:43.646  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:49.819  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I did get a little carried away
with my first taste of power.

00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.237  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Just to clarify,

370
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.948  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
there will be no bunion shaving
for me, correct?

371
00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:58.828  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:17:58.912 --> 00:18:01.497  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I think your brother's
the one you should apologize to.

373
00:18:01.581 --> 00:18:04.417  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're right. I should do that right now.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:08.212 --> 00:18:11.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And hopefully meet Khalil Woods

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.176  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:18.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

everyone laughed at me

00:18:24.311 --> 00:18:26.064  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now, try to act cool.
