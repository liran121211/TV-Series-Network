00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:31.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.721  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
stuff like cars, trips to space,

214
00:08:33.805 --> 00:08:35.598  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:35.682 --> 00:08:39.478  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, because I am nothing
but a senseless purchase to you?

216
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, I didn't mean it like that.

217
00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.897  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Right, you meant "senseless purchase"

218
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.859  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
in a polite, respectful way.

00:08:47.194 --> 00:08:50.697  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Richie, you can't do this to me.

220
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:51.698  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's for your own good.

221
00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:53.200  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sorry to be so hard on you,

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.701  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but you're gonna have to suffer through

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:57.620  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
spending a million dollars a day.

00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:58.663  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But it could break me.

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.123  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:00.207 --> 00:09:02.000  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and told me to spend
Christmas with my family.

228
00:09:09.174 --> 00:09:12.093  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hey, Harper, you still upset about Camden?

229
00:09:12.177 --> 00:09:13.720  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You're being so unfair.

230
00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:15.305  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He's perfect.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:17.140  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's just that he uses all those big words

232
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:18.766  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
he probably doesn't know the meaning of.

233
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.685  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He's so hoity-toity.

234
00:09:20.768 --> 00:09:22.229  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is that the right word?

235
00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:25.023  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't even know what it means.

236
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:27.526  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Congrats, Dad, 
you finally used it correctly.

237
00:09:27.608 --> 00:09:29.528  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Now would you mind
celebrating in another room?

238
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.739  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
'Cause I'm still kinda mad
about the whole Camden thing.

239
00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.409  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe I judged Camden too quickly.

240
00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:38.786  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I mean, I didn't even find out
the important stuff about him

241
00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.038  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that makes him who he is.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.249  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Like, his favorite cartoon character.

243
00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.792  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Does he prefer pizzas or calzones?

244
00:09:44.876 --> 00:09:48.046  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And how would he go about
getting gum out of his hair?

245
00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:50.215  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What would that tell you about Camden?

246
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:51.799  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That last one was for me.

00:09:51.883 --> 00:09:54.052  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I dozed off while chewing
some watermelon blast.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.390  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So if Camden answers

249
00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:00.392  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
all of these extremely important questions

00:10:00.475 --> 00:10:01.642  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and gets the gum out of your hair,

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:02.769  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you'll let me date him?

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Eh, it depends on his answers.

00:10:04.687 --> 00:10:06.147  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I mean, no daughter of mine

254
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.066  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
is dating a calzone guy.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.193  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Dad, you love calzones.

256
00:10:10.277 --> 00:10:13.029  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, but I'm not proud of it.

257
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:17.576  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You seem to be handling
the spending freeze well.

00:10:17.658 --> 00:10:19.619  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You aren't curled up in a ball screaming,

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:21.580  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:24.791  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:32.715  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But I've been keeping busy,

00:10:32.799 --> 00:10:34.301  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:10:36.928 --> 00:10:40.807  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So you completely
disregarded what I said?

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.642  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, just as you told me,

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.520  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I didn't spend a single dime.

you are completely cut off.

00:10:59.409 --> 00:11:02.703  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33%

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:06.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It is possible to have fun

rich people tell poor people.

What are you doing to my chinos?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.901  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Are you suggesting that I portray myself

286

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:37.572  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Ahh!

00:11:37.656 --> 00:11:38.948  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not buffoonish.

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:41.660  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

Just talk about cartoons.
Oh, and you hate calzones.

00:11:44.412 --> 00:11:45.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

So you back to take out my daughter?

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, 
I just couldn't stop thinking about her

00:12:00.595 --> 00:12:02.721  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And mindlessly watching cartoons.

299
00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:05.058  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I did that today too!

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.476  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Only I didn't read the funnies.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I just looked at the pictures.

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:10.271  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So many words.

303
00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Wow, you guys
have so much in common.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.732  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Like, Camden was also just telling me

305
00:12:13.816 --> 00:12:16.110  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
how he hates books
because of all the words.

306
00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.696  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Right? Can't stand 'em.

307
00:12:17.778 --> 00:12:20.948  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
The only people who
read books are hoity-toity.

308
00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:22.867  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wait. Hoity-toity?

309
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:24.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Um, yeah.

310
00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:26.787  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Was that the wrong word to use?

311
00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:28.498  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Beats me.

00:12:28.582 --> 00:12:30.083  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have no idea what it means,

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.418  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but I just throw it in all the time

314
00:12:31.501 --> 00:12:34.337  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
'cause it just feels right.

315
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.172  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You know, Harper, maybe I did have

316
00:12:36.256 --> 00:12:38.299  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
the wrong first impression of Camden.
