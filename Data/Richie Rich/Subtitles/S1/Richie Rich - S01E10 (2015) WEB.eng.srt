00:04:40.948 --> 00:04:42.282  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I meant about school.

108
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.994  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, well, growing up, I never gave myself

109
00:04:46.078 --> 00:04:47.579  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
enough time for fun.

110
00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.873  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So one day, I walked out of school

111
00:04:49.957 --> 00:04:54.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and haven't picked up a book since.

112
00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.047  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my gosh.

113
00:04:57.131 --> 00:05:00.508  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can't believe you used to be like me.

114
00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:04.179  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That means I could end up like...

115
00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:06.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, my gosh!

116
00:05:06.932 --> 00:05:09.601  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Listen, you're a smart girl, Harp.

117
00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.187  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm sure you'll figure something out.

118
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:14.648  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just wanted to give you
a heads-up that sometimes

119
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.651  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
working too hard is
the worst thing you can do.

120
00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.279  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, is that why you do absolutely nothing?

121
00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:22.447  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's right.

122
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:28.662  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You think Richie is liking
his replacement robot?

123
00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.538  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wow.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:34.126  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm really liking my replacement robot.

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:36.461  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

126
00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:37.504  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

127
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:38.880  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Oh, please, call me Richie.

128
00:05:38.964 --> 00:05:40.090  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Or just call me.

129
00:05:40.174 --> 00:05:42.467  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Here's my phone number.

130
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.303  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What does Richie see in her?

131
00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:47.014  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Sure, she's pretty
and waits on his every need,

132
00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:50.725  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but she's incapable of feelings
or emotions.

133
00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:55.314  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't understand guys, do you?

134
00:05:55.396 --> 00:05:56.940  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I can't watch this.

135
00:05:57.024 --> 00:05:58.859  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Richie, would you like a snack?

136
00:05:58.942 --> 00:06:01.862  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Are you hungry?
Let me grab you something.

137
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:06.033  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I just realized, I have no idea
where the kitchen is.

138
00:06:06.116 --> 00:06:08.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I brought you this priceless vase.

139
00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.912  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thank you, but I do not need a vase.

140
00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:15.500  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Of course. How stupid of me.

141
00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:16.877  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Allow me to clean that up.

142
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.586  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, no, please. Leave it.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.088  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let's get to know each other.

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:21.756  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tell me something about yourself.

145
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.135  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I have 7,000 twin sisters,
I was born in a box,

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.636  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I rust if left outside.

147
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.555  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You too?

148
00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:30.307  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We have so much in common.

149
00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.309  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
So wanna go walk
through my corn maze?

150
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.311  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe we'll get lucky and find Tom.

151
00:06:34.393 --> 00:06:35.729  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Who's Tom?

152
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:38.357  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Oh, just some guy who got lost
in my corn maze.

153
00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.902  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
But if you don't like corn,
I also have a green bean maze.

154
00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.155  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, but I do not think
that would be appropriate.

155
00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:47.699  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I am a robot, and you are my boss.

156
00:06:47.782 --> 00:06:49.117  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
And I am here to work for you.

157
00:06:49.201 --> 00:06:50.869  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I do not want to be unprofessional.

158
00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:53.288  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I've never felt this way before.

159
00:06:53.372 --> 00:06:54.915  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I am sorry, but my programming

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.961  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
In that case, you're fired.

162
00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:09.679  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Why is she still here?
I thought Richie fired her.

163
00:07:09.763 --> 00:07:12.266  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I hope she's not waiting
for her last paycheck.

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.227  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
She didn't do anything.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.442  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Is it hot in here,

168
00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.612  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
or did your internal fan system
just crash?

169
00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:28.823  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
We've been over this.
I cannot go out with you.

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:31.201  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm not taking a no for an answer.

00:07:31.285 --> 00:07:33.036  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.037  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:36.206  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.131  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:03.817  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Darcy always tells me diamonds

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.403  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%

00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:17.164  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67%
