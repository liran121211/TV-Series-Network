00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:57.297  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
what do you call a dummy
who has wood for brains?

107
00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:58.465  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tulip!

108
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.969  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Way to step on my punch line, toots.

109
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.763  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
As impressive as your
ventriloquism skills are,

110
00:05:04.846 --> 00:05:08.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I need you to focus.
I can't get a "B" in gym,

111
00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:09.935  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
so I need you to train me and prepare me

112
00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.979  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and do whatever it takes to get me an "A".

113
00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:15.190  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm sorry, 
but as Coach McHale always says,

114
00:05:15.274 --> 00:05:16.733  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you have to do this on your own.

115
00:05:16.817 --> 00:05:19.486  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tulip, I'm your best friend.

116
00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.449  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'll help you, but shhh. He's right there.

117
00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.121  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was ridiculous, Tahj.

118
00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.581  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Thanks again for taking us
to your dad's concert.

119
00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:33.583  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You totally have his good looks,

120
00:05:33.667 --> 00:05:35.543  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and I'm hoping that one day

121
00:05:35.627 --> 00:05:38.964  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
you'll be getting his money, too.

122
00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:40.674  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That was so cool.

123
00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.884  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've never gotten to hang out
backstage before.

124
00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:47.388  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I have. At my third grade piano recital.

125
00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:51.350  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Madame Claudette had a spread
of dairy-free string cheese.

126
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:55.522  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Needless to say, it was pretty wild.

127
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:56.773  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sounds like a crazy night.

128
00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:59.609  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Evening. I was still in bed by 8:00.

129
00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.361  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Later, Richie. Bye, Tahj.

130
00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:07.408  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, you go to all your dad's concerts?

131
00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:08.702  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, my mom pays me to make sure

132
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.495  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
he doesn't flirt with any girls.

133
00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:12.580  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
My dad also pays me not
to say a word to my mom.

134
00:06:12.664 --> 00:06:14.749  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I make out like a bandit.

135
00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:17.044  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
It's so cool that your dad's a rap star.

136
00:06:17.127 --> 00:06:18.920  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Yeah, it's sick. Just the other day,

137
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:20.505  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Pharrell popped into my room

138
00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.050  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and was like, "Yo, where's
the bathroom in this place?"

139
00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.177  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Well, I would have loved
to have met your dad today,

140
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.429  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
but I'm sure he disappeared
off to some after-party.

141
00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:29.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He disappeared because he wasn't there.

142
00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:31.558  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What you saw was just a hologram.

143
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:34.019  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Seriously?
- He figures why perform

144
00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:36.604  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
when you can cash checks sitting
around in your pajamas

145
00:06:36.688 --> 00:06:38.148  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
watching home renovation shows?

146
00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:40.399  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
My dad does the same thing.

147
00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:43.070  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Except for the cashing checks part.

148
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.655  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Well, listen, I gotta write a book report.

149
00:06:45.739 --> 00:06:47.615  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey, you haven't seen
<i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, </i>have you?

150
00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.492  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, but I wouldn't turn in

151
00:06:49.576 --> 00:06:50.577  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
a plain old book report.

152
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.079  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Not if you want a really good grade.

153
00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.539  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Okay, what does a really good grade mean,

154
00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.833  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
'cause I'm totally cool with a "B".

155
00:06:56.917 --> 00:06:59.378  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
These days, teachers need to be dazzled

156
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.420  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
by flashy multimedia presentations,

157
00:07:01.504 --> 00:07:03.048  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
or autographed pictures of your dad,

158
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.842  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and I don't think the second
one's gonna work for you.

159
00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:07.468  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So, uh, what, exactly,

160
00:07:07.552 --> 00:07:11.639  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
does a flashy multimedia
presentation entail?

161
00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:15.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Tahj...

162
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:18.688  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
What happened to my room?

163
00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.816  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
This isn't your room anymore.
It's your movie set.

164
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.278  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Hey, if you need a nap,
hit your trailer out back.

165
00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:27.072  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It's the small one next
to my personal trainer's.

166
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.701  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I don't know anything
about making a movie.

167
00:07:31.785 --> 00:07:33.245  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Now, if you have any questions

168
00:07:33.328 --> 00:07:35.455  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
about the movie-making process,
I'm your man.

169
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.124  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I spend a lot of time on sets.

170
00:07:37.207 --> 00:07:39.584  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Mostly like in my dad's trailer
practicing the flute,

171
00:07:39.667 --> 00:07:43.338  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- but I was there.
- Um, excuse me, Mr. Director,

172
00:07:43.422 --> 00:07:46.341  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but I believe I've been miscast.

173
00:07:46.425 --> 00:07:48.802  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I would make a great Cowardly Lion.

174
00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:50.637  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Sorry, Scarecrow. I'm the Lion.

175
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.513  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
But I'm terrified of everything.

176
00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.350  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
It even took me 40 minutes
just to work up the nerve

177
00:07:55.434 --> 00:07:57.436  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
to have this conversation.

178
00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:02.899  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
This is humiliating. I don't do gingham.

179
00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:06.736  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Preach, sister. I do not do tin.

180
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.529  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Thanks for trying to help, Tahj,

181
00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.698  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
but maybe I should just write the paper.

182
00:08:10.782 --> 00:08:13.118  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I'm not ready to direct
a major motion picture.

183
00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:14.702  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'd keep that to yourself, Double R.

184
00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.579  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Confidence is everything.

185
00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.958  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Says the Cowardly Lion.

186
00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:23.086  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Okay, we are going to learn
a few sports today.

187
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:24.671  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
How about we start with fencing?

188
00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.548  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I thought you weren't allowed
to handle sharp objects.

189
00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:29.509  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Maybe we should start with a sport

190
00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:31.386  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
that doesn't involve swords.

191
00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:35.349  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You don't use swords. You use foils.

192
00:08:35.432 --> 00:08:38.393  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
We can use my leftovers from last night.

193
00:08:38.477 --> 00:08:41.396  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Which are wrapped in foil.

194
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.606  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yeah, I don't think...
- En garde.

195
00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:48.695  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Stop, stop, stop! I surrender.

196
00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Why aren't you fighting back?

197
00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:53.492  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Is it because you're distracted
by the smell of the ravioli?

198
00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:55.076  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
'Cause I kinda am.

199
00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:58.872  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I wasn't fighting back
'cause when you came at me,

200
00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:01.416  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
all these thoughts rushed to my head like,

201
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.003  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
"Don't get hurt. Why did I agree to this?

202
00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:07.422  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I'm kinda hungry."

203
00:09:07.506 --> 00:09:09.716  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
That's why you are bad at sports.

204
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.219  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
The key to athletics is clearing your mind

205
00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:14.721  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
and not thinking at all.

206
00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:19.393  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Huh. No wonder you're so good at this.

207
00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.394  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[cha-ching]

00:19:14.236 --> 00:19:17.406  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
we were filming a movie
for my book report,

417
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:22.202  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and you and you
and you and you were in it,

418
00:19:22.286 --> 00:19:25.372  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
and even you were there,
and I had just met you.

419
00:19:25.456 --> 00:19:27.333  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
He's Bulldozah's son.

420
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:31.629  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Bulldozah's some famous
gift wrapper down at the mall.

421
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:33.422  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I know who he is.

422
00:19:33.506 --> 00:19:36.342  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
I've watched every episode
of his family's reality show.

423
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:37.969  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I love <i>The Bulldozah Bunch.</i>

424
00:19:38.052 --> 00:19:41.848  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
By the way, 
are you really scared of balloons?

425
00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.725  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
No, of course not. Why?

426
00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.603  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
There aren't any in here, are there?

427
00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.355  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
So we were making a movie version of

428
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.440  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
<i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz?</i>

429
00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.734  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
You are aware there already is one.

430
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.362  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Everyone's seen it.
It's the best movie ever.

431
00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:59.281  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Wait, you've all seen it?

432
00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:00.199  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Yeah.
- Yes!

433
00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:02.076  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Classics!
- For reals?

434
00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.578  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
Although making a movie
book report is not a bad idea.

435
00:20:04.662 --> 00:20:06.580  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
These days, teachers need to be dazzled.

436
00:20:06.664 --> 00:20:10.250  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
And so do dads who don't think
their kids have any talent.

437
00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:13.295  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Hmm, we could turn a quick buck

438
00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:15.589  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
by landing some product placement.

439
00:20:15.673 --> 00:20:18.217  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I don't think that's such a good idea.

440
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.760  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Let me guess.

441
00:20:19.844 --> 00:20:21.345  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
You think I should read the book
and write a paper.

442
00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:23.430  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Pfft! That's way too much work.

443
00:20:23.514 --> 00:20:25.474  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
If it were me, I'd just slide some cash

444
00:20:25.558 --> 00:20:28.435  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
in an envelope and take the easy "A".

445
00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:30.771  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
- Are you serious?
- No.

446
00:20:30.855 --> 00:20:33.066  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
Read the book and write the report.

447
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:34.901  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:79.33% 
If there's anything
I've tried to teach you,

448
00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:37.904  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
it's the value of hard work.

449
00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:40.322  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
[yawns] Well, I'm beat.

450
00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:43.367  position:50.00%,middle  align:middle size:80.00%  line:84.67% 
I think it's time for my mid-morning nap.
