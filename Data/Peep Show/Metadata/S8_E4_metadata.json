To make things worse for Mark not only has Hans been promoted above him at work, making him Mark's boss but Jeremy has arranged for the unstable Big Mad Andy to decorate the flat - largely so that Jeremy can sign him up for life skills coaching. Mark finds solace in an MBA evening class, meeting the elegant Stephanie and Jeremy, strangely in love with Dobby, urges him to pursue her but Mark cops out when he gets a call from Jeremy requiring his help to calm down Big Mad Andy.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2128659", "rating": 7.5, "votes": 595, "number_of_episodes": 54}
