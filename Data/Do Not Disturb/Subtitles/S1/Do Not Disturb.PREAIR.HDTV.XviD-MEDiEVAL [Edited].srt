1
00:00:06,149 --> 00:00:09,028
Hi. There is a wine glass on the floor
by the elevator. Do you know long

2
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:11,657
it's been there? Over an hour. You know
how I know that? Cause I put it there.

3
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:13,275
To test you. Get rid of it.
Hey!

4
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,280
Why don't we get this fireplace up, OK?
Fire is sexy.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,668
And let's get the AC up
because fire is hot.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,094
Nicole, what you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be off today?

7
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:25,165
Yes, I am but girls keep wiping out
in these giant heels

8
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:27,587
that you are making us wear
so I have to cover.

9
00:00:27,872 --> 00:00:31,092
But don't expect much. I'm either
really hungover or still a little drunk.

10
00:00:31,212 --> 00:00:34,162
Let's keep it together today,
RJ is coming in.

11
00:00:34,518 --> 00:00:37,602
Don't worry, I'll be fine. I had
a pack of nicorette for breakfast.

12
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:41,573
<i>The Times</i> has picked The Inn as one
of New York 10 best places to stay.

13
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:44,691
They're coming in to interview RJ cause
he's the owner. Even though I'm the one

14
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,300
who did everything around here,
not that he would ever acknowledge that.

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,774
Oh, Neal's got daddy issues.

16
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:52,572
It just kills me when older men
withhold their approval

17
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:54,724
of younger men
who want to be like them.

18
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,619
He made me general manager
of the hottest hotel in New York.

19
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:01,573
In fact,
I'm kind of a big deal right now.

20
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:03,413
If you were hoping
to ride me to the top,

21
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,848
now it might be
a good time to hop on.

22
00:01:06,521 --> 00:01:08,488
Sexual harassment.

23
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:12,117
Lucky for you I need it today,
otherwise I might call Rhonda on you.

24
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:14,950
Please, don't even joke,
just the sound of that woman's name

25
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,775
makes everything on me proper.

26
00:01:18,324 --> 00:01:19,527
Not again!

27
00:01:24,986 --> 00:01:26,965
Rhonda, seriously
you look gorgeous today.

28
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,754
Oh, Molly wants something.
What is it?

29
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,014
Remember how you said you'd talk to Neal
about getting me out of reservations

30
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,432
which I hate
and up to the front desk which I'd love.

31
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:38,977
No, what I remember saying is,
"Please stop asking me about this."

32
00:01:41,387 --> 00:01:43,298
Rhonda, thanks god, help!
Ming is...

33
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:44,774
She's flipping out. I...

34
00:01:44,934 --> 00:01:47,770
I sent her to clean 410
for an early checking but apparently...

35
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,957
Neal was already there
giving the model from Sweden

36
00:01:50,077 --> 00:01:51,507
an early checking up his own...

37
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,218
- No, he wasn't.
- Yeah, yeah, he was.

38
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:58,603
And the worst part is
I can't get Ming to stop rocking

39
00:01:58,723 --> 00:02:00,415
to tell me what he looked like naked.

40
00:02:07,786 --> 00:02:09,151
You know, you pick it up.

41
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:10,872
Excuse me, miss Peet?

42
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,177
Miss Peet?

43
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:14,512
Jason, that makes me sound
like a teacher.

44
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,639
I'm not old enough to be your teacher.

45
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:19,772
I'm sorry I can't tell
how old black people are.

46
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,360
Anyway I know you told me to hang
in there with this bellmen thing

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,277
but it's been 3 days and I hate it.

48
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:32,195
And I tried to talk to Neal
about this but he just said,

49
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:34,491
"Do you realize
where you get to work, op?"

50
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,451
Don't you pay Neal any attention.

51
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,038
Now, is mister Jeffreys upstairs
waiting for his luggage?

52
00:02:40,198 --> 00:02:42,248
No, I put him in a cab to the airport.

53
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:50,109
What is this?
Nicole, what happened?

54
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:53,676
Miss catalogue model here
doesn't know how to walk in high heels.

55
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,519
I mean, come on,

56
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:58,640
suck in your stomach,
squeeze your ass and focus.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,510
I've been doing it since I was 3.

58
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,088
This is the third child
who falls in these things.

59
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,522
What is Neal thinking?

60
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:09,059
What am I doing? I had lunch.

61
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:12,195
I'm like an animal.

62
00:03:14,274 --> 00:03:17,033
Larry, baby, give me some ice
for this foot.

63
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:19,577
This is great news,
if her ankle is broken

64
00:03:19,737 --> 00:03:21,496
then they do need someone upstairs.

65
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:22,662
Molly...

66
00:03:23,273 --> 00:03:26,607
have some sensitivity,
this child is hurting.

67
00:03:27,057 --> 00:03:29,556
And she stinks like an ashtray.

68
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,671
That's why your bones are so brittle.

69
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:34,884
And you, no, you're not going upstairs.

70
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:36,928
- Why?
- Because I need you in reservations.

71
00:03:37,048 --> 00:03:39,514
- Anyone can answer a phone.
- But not like you.

72
00:03:39,674 --> 00:03:42,433
- I'll train some new girl.
- But I like having you down here.

73
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:44,529
- I'll come visit on my breaks.
- Stop it!

74
00:03:44,649 --> 00:03:46,354
What do you have to get up there so bad?

75
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:48,464
Do you realize who stays here?

76
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,057
Rockstars, producers, europeans.

77
00:03:51,177 --> 00:03:54,477
They could discover me and make me
an international singing sensation.

78
00:03:58,609 --> 00:04:00,201
That is quite a plan.

79
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,330
You got fair, girl, it's...

80
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:03,830
Exciting!

81
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,293
Crazy as hell but...

82
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:10,110
Exciting!

83
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:14,394
I'm telling you, if these girls
keep falling off their shoes,

84
00:04:14,514 --> 00:04:15,903
you're gonna get yourself sued.

85
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,334
Okay, let me explain why

86
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:21,055
I'm not taking those girls
out of those shoes.

87
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:24,934
Because hot chicks and high heels
turn me on, how about that?

88
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,803
Plus there's something
about their discomfort

89
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:29,512
that makes me feel like a man.

90
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:33,010
How about you let me do my job
and you take care

91
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,944
of human ressources whatever that is.

92
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:36,863
I take care of people.

93
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:38,857
You do know what people are, right?

94
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:42,376
They are those broken down things
holding up your uniforms.

95
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,122
Okay, I don't know
where all this is coming from...

96
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,699
But let's be clear. <i>The Times</i> is not
writing an article about this hotel

97
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,964
because you breastfeed
the hobbits downstairs.

98
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,127
They're writing it because of me.

99
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:00,523
I personally chose every piece
of furniture in this lobby,

100
00:05:00,643 --> 00:05:02,263
every piece of art on these walls.

101
00:05:02,423 --> 00:05:04,757
And every piece
of smoking hot ass behind the...

102
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:06,517
What is that?
How did it get out?

103
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:10,709
You know, it's totally unfair
that you're so super busy

104
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:13,815
just because all those other girls
broke their ankles and stuff.

105
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:16,904
- Do you want me to help?
- I'm not doing anything.

106
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,205
Do you want me to get that?

107
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:24,452
I don't answer the phones, it just goes
somewhere else, I don't answer.

108
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:27,705
She's not getting upstairs.
And we both know why.

109
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,192
Alright, in retrospective,

110
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,918
it's probably the wrong week
to go off my anti-anxieties.

111
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:35,546
RJ is on his way here with <i>The Times</i>,
you're all over me with the "Hey, hey,

112
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,424
"you a real fine woman,
won't you back that thing up", so...

113
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,418
Let's be done. Okay?
You want to get her outta here?

114
00:05:41,538 --> 00:05:44,389
Your downstairs girl is blocking
both of my upstairs girls. Thank you.

115
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:49,788
I can't believe you put me away
from the front desk

116
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,976
just as a two-time Grammy winner was
checking in and I was helping Nicole.

117
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:57,075
It would've been a perfect time for you
to ask Neal If I could work upstairs.

118
00:05:57,195 --> 00:06:00,284
Baby girl, mother loves you
enough to tell you the truth.

119
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:03,242
Neal is not going to let you
work upstairs, okay?

120
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:07,552
That you are as plump and lovely
as a girl can be. You are.

121
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:11,575
Alright, but this is not the plump
and lovely Bed and Big Breakfast.

122
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:15,962
It's the skinny bitch
and high heels hotel, you feel me?

123
00:06:18,152 --> 00:06:19,007
Now...

124
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:22,532
let's get downstairs and do the jobs
we're being paid to do today.

125
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:26,513
I'ma catch up with you.

126
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:29,142
I need the two-time Grammy winner

127
00:06:29,302 --> 00:06:31,091
to give Hello to Rhonda.

128
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:40,917
Inn Reservations, I hate my life,
can you hold?

129
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,133
Hi, Julie, is my father there?

130
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,778
Will you have him call me
as soon as it gets out of court?

131
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:52,081
I'm just having a really bad day at work
and I wanted to talk to him about it.

132
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:54,192
Victor,
get whatever color curtains you want,

133
00:06:54,312 --> 00:06:56,315
you know, I don't care about that stuff.

134
00:06:57,468 --> 00:06:59,778
No, not purple, come on!

135
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,425
No, that's too gay.

136
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:06,018
Well, I know we're gay,
but now that's just gay on gay.

137
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:08,725
Victor, I got to go.

138
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,627
God, why can't I be the wife?

139
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:18,382
Do we still have those normal looking
shoes the girls used to wear?

140
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:19,692
Yeah, let me look.

141
00:07:20,641 --> 00:07:23,112
- Ms Peet... Rhonda...
- Jason...

142
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:26,603
Did you come all the way down here to
tell me that you hate being a bellman?

143
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:29,494
I just don't think
I fit in good upstairs.

144
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:31,788
It's all these beautiful people

145
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:34,248
and they are all so smart and classy.

146
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:36,225
Baby, those people
aren't smart or classy.

147
00:07:36,345 --> 00:07:38,377
And you're just
as beautiful as they are.

148
00:07:38,863 --> 00:07:39,685
No!

149
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,865
Yes, you are.

150
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,594
Can't you just give me
something to do down here?

151
00:07:46,854 --> 00:07:48,554
Baby you don't have any skills.

152
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:50,098
I can waddle.*

153
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:53,518
Sit down!

154
00:07:55,215 --> 00:07:56,868
Let me tell you a story.

155
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:00,191
About a week ago,
I'm walking down Colombius Avenue

156
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:02,601
and up the street in front of me,
there's this homeless man.

157
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:05,049
So see, all these people
are making these really wide circles

158
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,989
so they don't have
to walk up next to him.

159
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:09,443
Well, when I get up there,
I see that the man...

160
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,140
pants are open
and his thing is out.

161
00:08:14,156 --> 00:08:16,650
Jason, it was a monster.

162
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:19,234
You know
what I thought in that moment?

163
00:08:19,354 --> 00:08:22,545
I'm thinking "Buddy, if you got a thing
like that and you end up homeless,

164
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:25,200
"you got nobody to blame but yourself."

165
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:33,379
I don't get it.

166
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:37,106
Really, I'd like to.
What was the cross street?

167
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:44,620
People need to know what they got
and then they need to use it.

168
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:47,572
You fit in fine upstairs, baby.
Trust.

169
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:55,774
I can't believe
you're making us put these shoes on.

170
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:58,194
They look like
they cover the prescription.

171
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,211
I'm not letting one more child
get hurt on my watch.

172
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:05,548
Well, Neal is gonna freak.
He wants us mean and hobbled.

173
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,177
Neal is not even gonna notice. You're
all behind the desk the entire time.

174
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:20,712
Rhonda did it.
She made us wear the old shoes

175
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:23,855
and we hate them.
I feel like a lesbian postal worker.

176
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:27,421
I wish you looked half that hot.

177
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:31,199
RJ is gonna be here in any seconds
so you all better back up in your toes.

178
00:09:33,069 --> 00:09:35,047
- Don't you dare, get down.
- Get up.

179
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:36,680
- Down!
- I said get up!

180
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,456
- Up!
- Don't listen to him, down!

181
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,567
- Stop it, down!
- Up!

182
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,211
It's quite a number
you choregraph there.

183
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:44,925
RJ, welcome!

184
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:48,216
Neal, how come every time I come here
you're borderline hysterical?

185
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,977
I'm not hysterical. Are those
the people from <i>The Times</i>?

186
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:56,349
- Should I go introduce myself?
- Definitely not.

187
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:58,267
You two, come with me.

188
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:02,663
So Rhonda,
how did the birthday party go?

189
00:10:03,414 --> 00:10:04,774
Mario treated you okay?

190
00:10:04,934 --> 00:10:06,712
Like a queen.
Thanks for making the call.

191
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:09,014
Call? What call?
He made a call for you?

192
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:15,020
Now how do you think it made me feel
to get off an airplane

193
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,163
and have my office inform me
that my hotel is being sued?

194
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,652
Oh, I told you you were gonna get sued!

195
00:10:22,846 --> 00:10:24,335
Who is suing us?

196
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:26,212
Molly Plesky's father.

197
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,220
Apparently
someone here at the hotel told Molly

198
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,509
she was too plump
to work at the front desk.

199
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:34,363
And apparently,
that is now discrimination.

200
00:10:36,308 --> 00:10:38,404
"I told you you were gonna get sued!"

201
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:42,019
That's ugly.
I don't like it.

202
00:10:43,305 --> 00:10:46,323
Let me remind you that I did
a little time upstate for a crime

203
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:48,234
that I may or may not have commited.

204
00:10:48,551 --> 00:10:51,877
And the last thing I need
is for that reporter to change his story

205
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:53,889
from "Top 10 Best Places to Stay"

206
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:56,312
to "Ex-con Hates Chubbies."

207
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,038
You should know RJ.
I did not say it, Rhonda did.

208
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:04,625
Wait a minute. It's your evil policy.
You won't let go and put a girl upstair.

209
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:07,420
She's not getting upstairs!
She's not getting upstairs!

210
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:10,733
- Hold hands.
- What?

211
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,365
- I'm sorry?
- Hold hands.

212
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,427
It's what I did
when my kids must behave.

213
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:15,731
Do it.

214
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:19,599
Now, Rhonda, say something nice to Neal.

215
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,732
Nice suit, Neal.

216
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,545
You have amazing cans, Rhonda.

217
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,526
It's true, they're pretty spectacular.

218
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,993
Thank you. Thank you both.

219
00:11:39,153 --> 00:11:40,619
Now, as far as I'm concerned,

220
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:44,009
you two are one. I want you
to make that law suit go away.

221
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:45,915
Or I'll make you go away.

222
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,460
Both of you.

223
00:11:55,194 --> 00:11:57,767
Victor, I can't talk right now,
I'm at work.

224
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,383
Well, remember that thing I used to do
before I got health benefit

225
00:12:01,503 --> 00:12:03,071
and you became a playwright?

226
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,409
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,231
Are you there?
I'm sorry.

228
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:11,581
I cannot believe this child.

229
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:14,559
Getting her daddy to sue this hotel
and putting my job in jeopardy?

230
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,030
I'm gonna rip right into her!

231
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,092
No, you are not.
I'm going to handle this, got it?

232
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,061
- Molly, can we talk for a sec?
- In my office, now.

233
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:33,509
Molly, why do you think we just
dragged you in here, right now?

234
00:12:34,725 --> 00:12:36,926
My god,
are moving me to the front desk?

235
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,225
- You are not, sweetie.
- Yes, yeah we are.

236
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:42,540
You are? I'm so exciting!

237
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,142
Sorry, I just need
to get your signature on these.

238
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:46,835
First of all, I want to apologize.

239
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:49,774
I was heartbroken to hear you felt
you were being discriminated against.

240
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,691
Obviously you got your feelings hurt
and I feel very bad about that.

241
00:12:52,851 --> 00:12:54,944
- What's happening here?
- And this one.

242
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,905
The truth is it was RJ's idea

243
00:12:58,065 --> 00:13:00,621
for all the girls upstairs to be this
weirdo model types. I told him,

244
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:03,248
That's not the world we live in anymore
but he didn't want to listen.

245
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,258
- This one.
- You really need me

246
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:07,706
to do this right now
or you're just in here to eavesdrop.

247
00:13:07,866 --> 00:13:09,032
Eavesdrop.

248
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:13,504
Okay, then sit down
and stop distracting me with all this.

249
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:14,954
- Get out!
- Yep!

250
00:13:17,686 --> 00:13:20,495
Personally, I think it's great
that your dad is suing the hotel.

251
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:22,322
It's gonna light a flame
under RJ's butt

252
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:24,682
and get rid of this all stupid policy
altogether.

253
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,559
But if you put me upstairs,

254
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,103
he won't sue.
I'll tell him not to.

255
00:13:29,263 --> 00:13:30,645
Hang on!

256
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:34,233
That hadn't occurred to me.
Had that occur to you Rhonda?

257
00:13:34,393 --> 00:13:36,191
- Let me...
- Why don't you call your daddy

258
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,550
and tell him everything
is gonna be alright now.

259
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,170
Thanks, Neal.

260
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,788
What are you doing?
You're not putting her up there.

261
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:49,159
No, I'm not.

262
00:13:49,441 --> 00:13:52,304
We'll just put her off a while
and find some reason to fire her.

263
00:13:52,858 --> 00:13:54,712
I'm not going along with that.

264
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,293
Those kids out there
might just be decoration to you

265
00:13:57,413 --> 00:13:58,774
but they mean something to me.

266
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:02,062
And I'm not going to start lying to this
girl just to make it better for you.

267
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:04,472
Hey, it's better for you too.

268
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:07,142
If Molly's daddy shuts down this hotel,

269
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:10,201
you're gonna loose all these kids
you care so much about.

270
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,995
And what are you gonna do
with yourself then?

271
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:20,779
Is she behind me?
Is she behind me?

272
00:14:20,939 --> 00:14:22,177
- No!
- Got her.

273
00:14:26,669 --> 00:14:28,686
You know, it is so offensive
that there's a policy

274
00:14:28,806 --> 00:14:30,869
that heavy people can't work upstairs.

275
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:34,126
That's like saying I can't work upstairs
because I'm a redhead.

276
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,295
That's why I can't work upstairs,
isn't it?

277
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:42,275
Jackass, I've just sent guests up to 510
which you marked as clean.

278
00:14:42,395 --> 00:14:44,331
Meanwhile, they're walk in
to find a filthy room

279
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,200
and your chinese woman
crying in the tub.

280
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,908
Ming... She's in the bathtub?

281
00:14:48,028 --> 00:14:49,681
She's feeling much dishonoured.

282
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,892
Listen, if she can't clean the rooms,

283
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:54,622
I'm sure there are 11 other people
in her apartment who can.

284
00:14:55,349 --> 00:14:56,357
Hey, stick!

285
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,643
Now, *.

286
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:00,728
You know what this is?

287
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:01,987
This is food.

288
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:05,648
We eat it and we're nice.
You don't eat and you're mean.

289
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:07,191
Mean and thin.

290
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:09,714
You always leave out
the most important part.

291
00:15:11,855 --> 00:15:14,197
Don't make a black woman
take off her earrings.

292
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:28,994
It kind of burnt.

293
00:15:32,163 --> 00:15:34,895
I don't know
who I am more mad at right now.

294
00:15:35,055 --> 00:15:36,957
Molly for creating all this drama,

295
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:40,150
Neal for lying to Molly
or me for letting him get away with it.

296
00:15:40,438 --> 00:15:42,945
When I was a kid,
we were greatful for food,

297
00:15:43,218 --> 00:15:45,573
clothes, a hammy down white baby doll.

298
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:49,660
These new kids think
they are entitled to everything.

299
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,648
You understand what I'm saying?
I just...

300
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,082
Oh, hell.
Where did you come from?

301
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:57,752
Neal is not really
gonna put me upstairs?

302
00:15:57,964 --> 00:15:59,203
No, baby, he's not.

303
00:15:59,663 --> 00:16:00,921
Then why did he lie to me?

304
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,790
Because he's a liar.

305
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,263
And because RJ is upstairs
with that reporter from <i>The Times</i>,

306
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,214
he didn't want your little story
getting out.

307
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:10,598
This si wrong Rhonda, you knwo it is.

308
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:14,664
What's wrong is having your daddy
trying to fix your problems.

309
00:16:15,256 --> 00:16:17,436
If I had a fight
that I thought was worth fighting,

310
00:16:17,556 --> 00:16:19,218
baby, I'd fight it for myself.

311
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:21,422
Okay, I'd get right on up,

312
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:24,011
into whatever face
was looking down on me,

313
00:16:24,131 --> 00:16:27,577
and I'd say,
"Hey, it's Rhonda, deal with me."

314
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:30,993
"Or I will bring
this whole house down around."

315
00:16:33,277 --> 00:16:34,830
Well... Hold on.

316
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,374
- Where are you going?
- To fight my own fight.

317
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:39,627
No, no!
Wait a minute!

318
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:41,279
That's not what I meant.

319
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,341
Oh, damn!
What did I just do?

320
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:47,260
I think you just sent up upstrairs

321
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,720
to bring the whole house down
around ya.

322
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:54,085
So why don't we give one of RJ
with the lobby down below?

323
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,060
A king and his castle kind of thing.

324
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:57,698
I like the sound of that.

325
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,054
- Where should I stand?
- Where you are is fine.

326
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,204
Baby girl, wait.

327
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:05,611
What exactly
are you planning to do here?

328
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:08,745
I'm going up to RJ and that reporter
and I'm gonna say, "Hey,

329
00:17:08,865 --> 00:17:11,992
"I'm Molly, you can't hide me downstairs
because I'm plus size."

330
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:15,371
Hold on, a lot of people's lives
could be affected by this.

331
00:17:16,261 --> 00:17:18,803
Sorry, but it's always been like this
and I'm sick of it.

332
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:22,651
Besides, if it's a fight worth fighting,
I got to fight it, isn't what you said?

333
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:26,728
Yeah, I guess I did say that, didn't I?

334
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,753
Look, I get it.

335
00:17:44,302 --> 00:17:45,638
You don't care about me.

336
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:48,112
But are you really gonna let

337
00:17:49,363 --> 00:17:51,288
Rhonda loose her job over this?

338
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:54,034
Wait! Are you gonna
loose your job if I do this?

339
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:56,578
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine, come on.

340
00:17:58,158 --> 00:18:00,833
Rhonda, this is your whole life,
you don't have anything else.

341
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,496
Excuse me, you got one friend
on these stairs. Let's go.

342
00:18:06,707 --> 00:18:07,777
Come on.

343
00:18:12,777 --> 00:18:14,021
I can't.

344
00:18:18,735 --> 00:18:20,269
Oh, god!

345
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,229
Are you okay?

346
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:23,203
No.

347
00:18:23,974 --> 00:18:26,134
That wine glass
is still by the elevator.

348
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:32,780
I had no idea how hungry I was.

349
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,933
I mean...

350
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:37,661
I feel calmer,
my head doesn't hurt, it's like...

351
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,814
Oh my god, the screaming stopped.

352
00:18:44,077 --> 00:18:46,537
You have beautiful eyes,
I've always said that.

353
00:18:46,657 --> 00:18:49,298
When you say stuff like this, it makes
me wish that we're still hang out.

354
00:18:49,418 --> 00:18:50,433
Why don't we?

355
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,718
- Victor bugs me.
- Oh my god, he bugs me too.

356
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:54,907
- Then why are you with him?
- I don't know.

357
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:57,902
That was delicious, baby girl.

358
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:00,449
Saving my job,
knocking Neal down those steps.

359
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:02,227
You knocked Neal down the steps?

360
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:06,315
No, I threw myself down the steps
in a heroic gesture to save this hotel.

361
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:11,737
Are you okay?
Here, sit down, I'll get you some ice.

362
00:19:12,731 --> 00:19:15,645
I know, right? 11 grams of protein
and she's calibraty.*

363
00:19:16,635 --> 00:19:19,499
Why are you looking so sad?
You did a good thing up there.

364
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:20,861
You're my girl.

365
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:24,363
Whatever, I'm still your fat girl
who can't work upstairs.

366
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:27,473
Why do you wanna work upstairs?
The guests are mean,

367
00:19:27,593 --> 00:19:28,843
they're all perfumy,

368
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,423
you can't believe how many of them
answer the door naked.

369
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:32,986
Women and men.

370
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:36,595
And they are old,
like thirty and above, it's gross.

371
00:19:38,957 --> 00:19:40,715
But I'm a singer
and I need to be up there

372
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:43,977
so the people who stay here,
the people who matter can see me.

373
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,875
Why? If you're a singer,
they just need to hear you.

374
00:19:47,224 --> 00:19:48,273
There you go.

375
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,067
What am I supposed to do?

376
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:51,642
Answer the phone all,

377
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:56,823
<i>"Reservations, this is Molly."</i>

378
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,745
Do that.

379
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:04,523
Why are you bossing my balls to get
upstairs when you can sing like that?

380
00:20:04,813 --> 00:20:07,084
That's is the truth right there, diva.

381
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:10,295
But I can't really
answer the phone like that.

382
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:14,027
No, you're right. Cause once was great
but I can't hear that all day.

383
00:20:16,497 --> 00:20:18,361
Here's what you could do though.

384
00:20:18,481 --> 00:20:20,538
Just occurred to me
that we got a bar right upstairs.

385
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:22,516
- Don't.
- Where people sometimes perform.

386
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:25,602
- Don't.
- That baby did just save your job too.

387
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,481
Fine, you can have one night a week.

388
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:31,417
- Really.
- But like a tuesday.

389
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:33,441
Afternoon, and no suntime.

390
00:20:35,057 --> 00:20:36,530
I hate him, never ask me why.

391
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:39,324
- Okay.
- Oh my god!

392
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,277
This is gonna be so fun.

393
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:44,882
You are officially
the most talented person I know.

394
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,894
Damn, I should have fed her
months ago.

395
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:54,923
<i>Reservations,</i>

396
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,794
<i>this is Neal.</i>

397
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,525
<i>Reservations, this is Neal...</i>

398
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,852
<i>Reservations,</i>

399
00:21:07,012 --> 00:21:09,844
<i>this is Rhonda.</i>

400
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:13,609
That's how you do that.

401
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:18,082
- Do you want to grab a drink?
- Where do think I'm going?
