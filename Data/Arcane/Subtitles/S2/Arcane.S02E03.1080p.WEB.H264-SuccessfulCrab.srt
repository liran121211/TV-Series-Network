00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:25,957

00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:28,624
Locate Jinx, dismantle Shimmer,

00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:31,791
<i>and neutralize any agents
still loyal to Silco.</i>

00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,832
<i>The rise of industry

7
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:38,125

becoming increasingly toxic.</i>

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,541
<i>They call it the Grey.</i>

9
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,166

10
00:00:45,833 --> 00:00:48,666

Thanks. I thought I was a goner.

You're Smeech's man.

41
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,790
Was.

42
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,707
Not anymore. Name's Heenot.

43
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,999
I...

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,999
Oh, I decided
it was time for me to retire.

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,374
Looks more like
someone decided to retire you.

46
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,749
Yeah, well, timing was never my strong...

47
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,999
Sorry.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,999
Sorry, it's... It's the Grey.
It gives me the...

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,332
Tell us how you wound up here.

50
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,624
Hey, wait, wait.

51
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:19,874
Jinx is off the rails, even for her.

52
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,249
She's got a real fire lit under her ass.

53
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,040
She's planning something big,

54
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,124
right here in the pipeworks.

55
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:28,499
It's a pretty big place down here.

56
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,291
She was headed towards the old tunnels.
Something about rerouting the vents.

57
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,374
- This is it, then. Cuff him.
- Hey, I told you everything I know.

58
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:40,499
You're a confessed criminal.
You'll spend your retirement in a cell.

59
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,540
Check your gear.

60
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,291
This is what we've trained for.

61
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:45,541
Can I get a minute?

62
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:56,125
Your first request
for an audience was uninteresting.

63
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:59,833
The second, inappropriate
for someone of your station.

64
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,208
The third...

65
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,875
plain annoying.

66
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,916
People have lost their heads for less.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,458
So tell me, Amara,

68
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:17,833
what does a member
of Piltover's merchant guild want from me?

69
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:22,624
I'm not here representing the guild.

70
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,791
I've come here to settle a debt.

71
00:05:26,916 --> 00:05:29,375
My bookkeeper is down the hall.

72
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:32,874
What you've stolen...

73
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,624
...is more precious than any gold.

74
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:47,125
Did you truly believe
Piltover was beyond our reach?

75
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,375
My son is dead.

76
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,000
Is that not enough to sate your bloodlust?

77
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:02,665
I haven't insulted
your intelligence, Ambessa.

78
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,750
Do not insult mine.

79
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,957
We know what you're chasing in Piltover.

80
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,750
We will not allow it.

81
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,458
Allow?

82
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:15,999
Thank you.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,958
Your visit only confirms my suspicions.

84
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,040
Try to stop me, insolent witch.

85
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,208
My death means nothing.

86
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,207
You should have given up the feud.

87
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:44,333
You have no inkling what family is to me.

88
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,833
Triple the guard.

89
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,875
This will have consequences.

90
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:02,957
We need control now.

91
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,540
Salo isn't ready.

92
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,249
Perhaps it's time we involved Mel.

93
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,457
No. We must distance ourselves.

94
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:12,415
She's safer as our enemy.

95
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:13,665
I'll handle Salo.

96
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:14,666
Mm.

97
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,291
Her disappearance
won't go unnoticed for long.

98
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:20,875
It's worse than that.

99
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,374
We should cut the others loose.

100
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,290
Listen, if that Heenot idiot
is telling the truth,

101
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,207
Jinx is gonna have surprises
in store for us.

102
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,999
All the more reason to bring backup.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,583
She'll smell their nerves a mile away
and find a way to use them against us.

104
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,416
Tell me I'm wrong.

105
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,749
I can't let her get away again.
Are you sure you're ready to...?

106
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,291
My sister is gone.

107
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,583
There's only Jinx now.

108
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,666
It has to end.

109
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,583
I'm so sorry about your mother.

110
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,125
I'm sorry I can't bring her back,
but please just...

111
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,541
Everyone in my life has changed.
Promise me you won't change.

112
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,125
I won't.

113
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,166
Out.

114
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:52,915
Do you realize how easy it was
for me to track you down here?

115
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,915
Hmm. Well, I do own the place.

116
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:57,624
It's enough work propping you up

117
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:01,665
without you dulling what few wits
are left rattling around in there.

118
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,624
If you propped as well as you prod,

119
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,999
maybe I'd have better uses for my time

120
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,749
than sitting around waiting for an update

121
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,000
on Princess Kiramman's
underground escapades.

122
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:15,541
She's gotten no closer to Jinx.

123
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,750
But that doesn't seem
to steal the stars from anyone's eyes.

124
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:24,250
Perhaps if you hadn't let a child
overpower you in your own chamber.

125
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,916
It's not the girl.

126
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,124
It's the name.

127
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,791
It bewitches people.

128
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:31,582
You should know.

129
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,083
Do you really think
Mel could have succeeded--?

130
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,790
Never speak ill of my family.

131
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,375
Why are you here?

132
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,541
To sober you up.

133
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,250
Mission accomplished.

134
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,624
It's time.

135
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:01,332
Rally every house and family
with even a modicum of influence.

136
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,540
Can you manage that?

137
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,790
Wait. For certain?

138
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:06,124
Yes, of course.

139
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,291
Whatever you need.

140
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,250
There is another matter,
concerning your guild merchant Amara.

141
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,374
And, yes.

142
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,291
Lift.

143
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,582
Fantastic stuff.

144
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:37,416
Good to see you again, Lest.

145
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:38,791
I'm out.

146
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,083
Keeping an eye on a councilor
with peculiar tastes doesn't rattle me.

147
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,665
But that woman...

148
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,207
You met my mother? What did she want?

149
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:50,166
I don't know. They kicked me out
before I could hear any of it.

150
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,208
We both know you heard every word.

151
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,290
I'm sorry, but I really can't.

152
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:58,290
Lest, this is vitally important.

153
00:11:58,291 --> 00:11:59,540
I need to know.

154
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,458
This was never about Salo.

155
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,290
You're using me to get to her.

156
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:05,415
And then what?

157
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,207
You take what you need,
hang me out to dry? Hmm?

158
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,332
I'm expendable?

159
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,332
No, no one is expendable.

160
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,374
That's what this is all about.

161
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:16,291
Everything with my mother
is a calculated risk.

162
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,374
I'd love to promise your safety,

163
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:21,040
but I can't make any assurances
other than this:

164
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:25,040
If my mother gets what she wants,
the whole city will suffer.

165
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:28,916
And right now you're the only one
who can stand in her way.

166
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,207
They're setting up some big announcement.

167
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,540
All the who's who.

168
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,500
Aiming to take over
and put Salo in the hot seat, but...

169
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,791
we know who's really pulling the strings.

170
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:43,915
I caught a name. Amara.

171
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,916
I don't know what you make of that.

172
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,083
Here, brand-new cocktail. All the rage.

173
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,457
It's made with Shimmer.

174
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:52,999
Leaves traces on the body.

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,291
That should be all you need
to shut Salo down.

176
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,165
Thank you.

177
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,416
For what it's worth...

178
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,332
dangerous as she is,
your mother was spooked.

179
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,416
I could smell it.

180
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,290
Like a cat backed into a corner.

181
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,999
Viktor hypothesized that there may be
something he called "wild runes."

182
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,790
Patterns that occur naturally

183
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,790
where the border
between our world and the Arcane is thin.

184
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,124
Runes like the ones
you use in Hextech.

185
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:52,290
What's the difference
between those and wild runes?

186
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,708
Pass me a tome.

187
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:59,749
I used words you understood
in order to elicit your action.

188
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,583
This is what Hextech runes are.

189
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Pass me a tome.

190
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,874
Pass me a tome.

191
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:11,165
There, you sighed.
Still a kind of language.

192
00:14:11,166 --> 00:14:12,957
A sound, but not words.

193
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,790
Something raw. Natural.

194
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:16,415
That's wild runes.

195
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,749
Most places, the Arcane is dormant,
but here and there, it's more active.

196
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,124
- Wild runes are...
- Sort of like its fingerprints.

197
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,249
Exactly.

198
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,457
So you're telling me
that pattern is on my tree

199
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,208
because you pissed the Arcane off
with all your demands?

200
00:14:29,791 --> 00:14:31,249
That's-- That's not what I...

201
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,457
Oh, the lad may be onto something.
Every action sparks a reaction.

202
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,208
Oh, ball sockets.

203
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,625
Do you think this could actually
be a result of overuse of Hextech?

204
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:47,249
I've seen miracles spring
from the hands of mages many times,

205
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,707
but so often,

206
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,665
they turned to horrors.

207
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:55,291
I'd always presumed
it was due to mankind's...

208
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,375
turbulent relationship with power.

209
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,916
But perhaps it is a property
of the Arcane itself.

210
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,499
We tested our Hextech under
every conceivable condition for years.

211
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,374
If there's some reaction taking place,

212
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:14,040
how come we've never seen
any sign of it until now?

213
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:19,291
And why would it appear
on a tree, deep underground?

214
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,625
Hmm.

215
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,915
Your source panned out.

216
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:04,125
I've confirmed Salo met privately
with members of several houses today.

217
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:07,250
I should have been first
to bring this to you.

218
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,624
I promise I wouldn't have missed it.

219
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,040
It's just such a bold move.

220
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,874
And at this moment, it's...

221
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,041
Foolish.

222
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,666
Of course, your mother
is anything but a fool.

223
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:21,208
There must be an angle I'm missing.

224
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,625
Hmm.

225
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,790
Did you look into the other matter?

226
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:29,791
There's a rat's nest of misinformation
surrounding your brother's passing.

227
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:32,958
Whomever he crossed knows
how to cover their tracks.

228
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,833
Moreover, they've managed to strip
your mother of most of her holdings.

229
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,541
She's desperate.

230
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,500
Which makes her all the more dangerous.

231
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:47,375
What are we going to do?

232
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,999
Summon the apothecary.
I'll want his opinion of this.

233
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,583
And check in on Amara.

234
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,250
This is still part of the Hexgates?

235
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,291
We must be at least 200 feet
below the surface.

236
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,957
The entire structure is a channel,

237
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:15,750
focusing the Hextech energy
into a precise beam.

238
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,416
Cait.

239
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,791
If you see an opening...

240
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,083
take the shot.

241
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,833
Vi.

242
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,124
<i>How do you
know so much about its design?</i>

243
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:08,707
<i>Read what I could,
deduced what I couldn't.</i>

244
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,957
<i>Plus, I didn't think the Topside
would trust anything that important</i>

245
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,291
<i>below the surface.</i>

246
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:27,874
I thought the gemstone mesh
was installed aboveground.

247
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,207
The mesh is aboveground,

248
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,915
but we weren't sure what would happen
if the gate overloaded,

249
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,999
so we installed a failsafe at the base.

250
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,207
So instead of it exploding
in your neighborhood,

251
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,415
it would blow up in ours.

252
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:40,415
We're miles from the main fissures.

253
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:43,207
These are the same utility ducts
that carry our water

254
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,124
and facilitate our ventilation.

255
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,790
That would explain it affecting the tree.

256
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:49,707
Inconceivable.

257
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:53,250
You know, you say we should
feel like we're all one people.

258
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:57,500
But whenever it rains,
we're the ones that get wet...

259
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,166
What the...?

260
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,124
Jinx!

261
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,624
<i>Jinx! Jinx! Jinx!</i>

262
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,208
Finally got the name right.

263
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,790
Guess there really isn't
a crack in the earth

264
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,999
where you won't find me.

265
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,540
What is this place?

266
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,957
Don't you remember
the old Janna bedtime stories

267
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,833
Vander used to tell us?

268
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,749
Miners trapped underground.

269
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,665
Air running thin!

270
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:33,041
But then some wispy wind woman
wafts to their rescue.

271
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:38,458
Wild the kind of crap people get up to
when you choke them out.

272
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:43,082
We used the Grey to clear the streets.
To keep people safe.

273
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,250
"We."

274
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,333
Never thought my sister
would turn bluebelly.

275
00:19:48,916 --> 00:19:51,165
Never thought mine would orphan kids.

276
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:55,540
Ha! Why not?
Done it to myself enough.

277
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,874
But plastering my face all over

278
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:01,250
so someone else would do your dirty work?

279
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,915
Poisoning our air?

280
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:08,207
You've turned a leaf, sister.

281
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,540
I'm done blaming myself for your mistakes.

282
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,957
Done pretending you're my sister.
You're not.

283
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,582
You killed her.

284
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,416
I'm not gonna let you
stain her memory anymore.

285
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,833
Then stop me.

286
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:27,333
'Cause no matter what I do,

287
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,708
I just can't seem to die.

288
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,333
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:33,958
I'm sorry too.

290
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:02,750
I know you're sweet on her.

291
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,833
Hope you got a chance to, you know...

292
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:10,000
Before...

293
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,666
I'm ready.

294
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:24,250
Is that a wild rune?

295
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,208
I have no idea what that is.

I'm glad it's you.

325
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,208
Had to be you.

326
00:25:44,708 --> 00:25:45,583
No!

327
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,208
What are you...?

328
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:27,333
Get off me.

329
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:31,749
Get away from her.

330
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,624
- Cait.
- Move.

331
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,540
Scram, kid.

332
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:36,624
Cait, she's a child.

333
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,958
Move. She's not getting away again.

334
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,333
Cait.

335
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,165
- Move.
- Cait!

336
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,041
No, no, this isn't how it's supposed to...

337
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,833
We have to go now!

338
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:57,625
Cait.

339
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,625
You stopped me.

340
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,583
I shouldn't have had to.

341
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:09,957
I had the shot.

342
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,249
That was a kid. What if you missed?

343
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,082
I wasn't going to miss.

344
00:29:16,458 --> 00:29:17,916
What's wrong with you?

345
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,875
I keep telling myself
that you're different.

346
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:23,708
But you're not.

347
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,999
It's her blood in your veins.

348
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,541
Then why are you the one acting like her?

349
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,500
Elora?

350
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:50,957
What's wrong?

351
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:09,041
Black Rose.

352
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,458
Thank you all
for answering my summons.

353
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:38,165
I've come to trust the expertise
of Ambessa Medarda.

354
00:31:38,166 --> 00:31:40,290
You no doubt recognize the name.

355
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:43,790
She's just shared with me
some very upsetting,

356
00:31:43,791 --> 00:31:46,500
but sadly unsurprising, news.

357
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,375
Good evening.

358
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:55,291
Yesterday I met
with your guild merchant Amara.

359
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:57,665
We spoke of rebuilding,

360
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:01,749
restoring this great city
to its former glory,

361
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:06,125
when two Zaunite assassins fell upon us.

362
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:08,665
I tried to save her.

363
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:11,124
But the blade pierced her heart.

364
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:16,375
Our families should not need
fear an assassin's dagger in the night.

365
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,166
It's time to end this.

366
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,915
You've given Zaun
opportunity after opportunity

367
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:25,665
to repair their wrongs,

368
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,375
and how have they answered?

369
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:33,333
Half your council is dead.

370
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,708
Your memorial is made a massacre.

371
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,333
Well, no more.

372
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:46,124
Wrath must be met with wrath.

373
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,790
You must declare martial law.

374
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:56,874
Appoint a general to lead
until this threat is vanquished.

375
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:00,499
Someone who will not pale
when faced with Zaun's degeneracy.

376
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,332
Whose conviction never wavers.

377
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,707
A pillar of your community

378
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:09,249
whose house has always stood for progress.

379
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,624
Who may consider my experience

380
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:15,707
and my entire detachment
of Noxian soldiers

381
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,250
at their disposal.

382
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:25,165
Until all our families are safe.

383
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:29,208
Of course, I could only be referring to...

384
00:33:34,166 --> 00:33:36,165
Caitlyn Kiramman.

385
00:34:18,916 --> 00:34:20,666
Vengeance for your son.

386
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,541
It's you.

387
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,083
Come, child.

388
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,916
Your mother will have justice.

389
00:35:36,708 --> 00:35:37,833
I swear it.
