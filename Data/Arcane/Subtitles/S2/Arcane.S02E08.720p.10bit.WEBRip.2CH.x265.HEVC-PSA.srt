1
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,625
Drink the moment, Mel Medarda.

2
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,750
There is no time like your first.

3
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:32,625
I'm one of you?

4
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,624
A mage?

5
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,332
We each have
our own expressions.

6
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,249
Yours is quite rare.

7
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,582
An empath.

8
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,415
Attuned to the ethereal.

9
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:46,582
Able to sense others' inner selves
and bend their magic.

10
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,750
A conduit and a mirror.

11
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,915
What does that make you?

12
00:01:50,916 --> 00:01:53,916
Even now you hide your true face
behind illusions.

13
00:01:55,208 --> 00:01:57,833
Truth is
the greatest illusion of them all.

14
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:02,207
I think beneath that mask you're scared.

15
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,082
I can see through your tricks.

16
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:05,708
That makes me a threat.

17
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,416
For the gifted,
arrogance is the ultimate threat.

18
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,208
Your power has merit.

19
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:15,125
But should one want you dead,

20
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,833
a simple blade would do nicely.

21
00:02:19,333 --> 00:02:20,625
Where is my brother?

22
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:25,208
Regrettably, his fate wasn't
among your mother's lies.

23
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,000
You killed him.

24
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,665
I gave Ambessa every opportunity
to atone for her transgressions.

25
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,833
She chose pride over progeny.

26
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:37,000
But you need not bear her crimes.

27
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:38,790
The test.

28
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,624
This whole charade.

29
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:42,333
You want to recruit me.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,957
Your talents developed quickly.

31
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,082
It's no coincidence.

32
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,083
The Arcane is waking up.

33
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:51,083
What has my mother done?

34
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,750
A calamity is approaching,

35
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,500
rivaling even the ancient Rune Wars.

36
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,457
Ambessa sits at the helm,

37
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:02,958
blinded by her thirst for legacy.

38
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:06,250
Our efforts to divert her course
have foundered.

39
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,708
We can't afford another failure.

40
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,249
This is what you see in me?

41
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,666
A silver bullet?

42
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,499
I see salvation of your city,

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,416
countless others beyond.

44
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,540
She's my mother.

45
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,207
For all her faults,

46
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:25,875
she has always done
what she thought was best for the family.

47
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,832
Your brother thought so too,

48
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,083
until he uncovered her secret.

49
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:32,500
Your birth,

50
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,040
the entire course of your life,

51
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,582
was no accident.

52
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,875
She hid you because you are that
which she covets most:

53
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:41,958
a weapon.

54
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,833
Today you've been born into a new family,

55
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:52,333
from which you'll find
there is sadly no return.

56
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,791
Those untouched by the Arcane fear us.

57
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:00,666
What is this?

58
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,250
A welcome to your future.

59
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,541
<i>The world is a perilous place
for a solitary mage...</i>

60
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:28,916
<i>sister.</i>

61
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:33,458
<i>I regret
that I couldn't save him.</i>

62
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,875
<i>His injuries were too severe.</i>

63
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,208
<i>We do not lament
a warrior's death.</i>

64
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,333
<i>We avenge it.</i>

65
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,875
What of their Herald?

66
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,332
The blood should sustain Viktor
for a short while.

67
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,416
Beyond that, it is up to his own will.

68
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:04,625
You promised a cure to death.

69
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:08,833
An outcome dependent on Viktor's survival.

70
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,166
Doctor.

71
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,625
Your ingenuity deserves praise.

72
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,250
Viktor.

73
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,000
I am...

74
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,083
grateful.

75
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:37,041
The world I now see is more...

76
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,875
lucid than ever.

77
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:47,000
You can inhabit your followers?

78
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:48,916
We are one.

79
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:52,791
This is the Glorious Evolution.

80
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:55,583
Or it could have been.

81
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:59,750
I sense my twilight approaching.

82
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,750
An anomaly festers beneath the Hexgates.

83
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:10,375
<i>I believe it has the capacity
to complete the doctor's transformation.</i>

84
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:14,583
This will allow you to evolve others?

85
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:16,166
In theory.

86
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,750
But Jayce's attack has done its work.

87
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:25,666
I do not have the strength to overcome
the defense he will raise against me.

88
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,624
I will deliver you to this anomaly,

89
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,000
if you agree
to empower every soldier I bring you.

90
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,666
I will evolve all those willing.

91
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,791
<i>Vi?</i>

92
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,541
Vi?

93
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,458
Vi?

94
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,082
Come on.

95
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,750
We need to get out of here.

96
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,332
No!

97
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,791
Isha!

98
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:31,375
Shh. Easy there.

99
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,500
Took all the three docs to patch you up.

100
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,040
Loris?

101
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,083
Wasn't sure you'd pull through.

102
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,291
Thank that thick noggin of yours.

103
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:00,166
Where are the others?

104
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:01,708
Cait?

105
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,415
Jinx?

106
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:06,666
Jinx.

107
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:12,290
Caitlyn wanted to be here
to tell you herself.

108
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,416
Loris.

109
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:15,125
Spit it out.

110
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:21,791
Maybe we can negotiate.

111
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,458
Not with Ambessa.

112
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,915
I saw it in her eyes.

113
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,832
She will burn Piltover
to the ground for my betrayal.

114
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,332
You can't blame yourself.

115
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,582
I don't need consolation.

116
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,708
I need a plan.

117
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:37,208
Arrested?

118
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,832
I can handle this, Maddie.

119
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,250
Check on my father?

120
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:51,040
- Vi.
- She saved your life.

121
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:53,040
If you will calm down for one...

122
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,332
Knowing you'd never
have done the same for her.

123
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,124
We'll never know, will we?

124
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,290
You didn't let me in
on that part of your plan.

125
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,415
Clearly the right call,

126
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:03,665
since you still can't trust her enough
not to shove her in a box.

127
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:04,999
Trust?

128
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,165
You believe I'm so daft
I can't recognize a contingency?

129
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:12,165
She wasn't there for my benefit.
You didn't trust me to follow through.

130
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:13,457
Can you blame me?

131
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:17,624
How long were you sidled up
with that shifty, self-serving war pig?

132
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,749
She oinked poison in your ear.

133
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,707
You just ate it.

134
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:21,916
I know.

135
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:31,790
The only thing Jinx cared about
was getting you to safety.

136
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,500
Then she just surrendered.

137
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,041
I didn't even have time to think
before they hauled her off.

138
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:42,708
She's being held in the bunker
while I decide what to do.

139
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,208
I was waiting for you to recover.

140
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,875
Cait, she's changed.

141
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,125
We can't erase our mistakes.

142
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,541
None of us.

143
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,166
Who decides who gets a second chance?

144
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,416
If you're here to kill me,

145
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:38,791
make sure to finish the job.

146
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,166
Vi thinks you've changed.

147
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,708
She can't accept
what you and I know.

148
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:49,041
There are no happy endings.

149
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,291
Is that all you have to say for yourself?

150
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,957
There won't be a trial.

151
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,165
I'm giving you this one chance
to account for your actions,

152
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,875
all the pain you've caused.

153
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,625
No amount of good deeds
can undo our crimes.

154
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,500
Do what you came here to do.

155
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,250
Hating you...

156
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,083
I've hated myself.

157
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,500
I just don't have the energy
for it any longer.

158
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,458
I didn't know your mom was there.

159
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,125
It probably wouldn't have made
a difference, but...

160
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,791
I didn't know.

161
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,083
Jayce?

162
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,666
What happened to you?

163
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Doesn't matter.

164
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,083
Something happened to me too.

165
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,375
You're the reason
we didn't die in the attack.

166
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,458
Apparently so.

167
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:09,583
How long have you known?

168
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,832
It started then.

169
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,416
Feelings I couldn't explain.

170
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But this...

171
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,625
I still don't fully understand.

172
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,791
Why just me? Why not save all of them?

173
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:28,165
It wasn't a decision.
One moment you're addressing the Council,

174
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:32,790
the next we're standing in rubble.
I didn't have any greater awareness.

175
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,999
How can I know you aren't lying to me?

176
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,749
Why would you think I am?

177
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,082
Because you used me,
and Viktor, for Hextech.

178
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:41,832
You called us "investments."

179
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:46,083
Two brilliant young inventors who shared
a penchant for impossible surprises.

180
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,415
Carrying magic from myth to machine.

181
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,208
Rallying the hope and hearts of a nation.

182
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,250
You were a wise investment.

183
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:09,583
Allow us a moment of civility, Jayce.

184
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,875
We must talk.

185
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:14,916
Viktor.

186
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,125
How did you get in here?

187
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:23,457
You once benefitted
from my knowledge of this place.

188
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,624
That was a long time ago.

189
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,665
Had you given me the chance,

190
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,832
I would have shown you
the merits of my work.

191
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:32,999
Our work.

192
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,707
No, this is your obsession.

193
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,666
Everything you've done
to these people, you did alone.

194
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,457
Perhaps.

195
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,582
But I'm alone no longer.

196
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,708
I now speak with all their voices.

197
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,624
Say what you came here to say.

198
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,165
Somehow I think you already understand

199
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:01,207
what must transpire
to complete my mission.

200
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:04,332
I would prefer to do so in peace.

201
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:07,957
The Noxian has other intentions.

202
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,375
Mother?

203
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:20,125
The Arcane stirs within you.

204
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,249
Viktor, for all our sakes,

205
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,707
stay away from the Hexgates.

206
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,790
Your mind has become rigid, Jayce.

207
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:47,040
Fear clouds your judgment.

208
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:50,125
This chain of events started with you.

209
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:58,707
In my confusion,
I was unable to reconcile this.

210
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,875
But I now understand.

211
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,874
The Glorious Evolution is destined.

212
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:11,291
Let us instead do this once again
as partners.

213
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,541
My partner died in this room.

214
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:25,291
It was my sincere desire to avoid this.

215
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,875
Doctor.

216
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:09,083
You may begin the process.

217
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:27,791
Go away.

218
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,750
You're too late.

219
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,415
Oh, it's a hell of a place.

220
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,832
It says something about the late Marcus

221
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:39,750
that he found imprisoning your sister
to be a greater mercy than killing her.

222
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:41,958
Killing isn't mercy.

223
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:46,875
A spark of rebellion
still burns inside that husk, I see.

224
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,291
No.

225
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:50,665
Killing is a cycle.

226
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,540
One that started
long before Vander and me.

227
00:20:53,541 --> 00:20:57,750
And it will continue
long after the two of you.

228
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm done running in circles.

229
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,040
We build our own prisons.

230
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:09,875
Bars forged of oaths, codes, commitments.

231
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,291
Walls of self-doubt
and accepted limitation.

232
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:17,500
We inhabit these cells, these identities,

233
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:19,916
and call them "us."

234
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:26,125
I thought I could break free
by eliminating those I deemed my jailors.

235
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:27,708
But...

236
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,041
Jinx...

237
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:34,583
I think the cycle only ends
when you find the will to walk away.

238
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:42,291
Jinx?

239
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,083
What are you doing?

240
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,791
I swiped these from the guard station.

241
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:58,249
If you come, help, use all that
explosive potential of yours for good,

242
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,790
maybe we could rewrite your story,
like you did with Zaun.

243
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,000
What do you think?

244
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:05,750
Sure, Vi.

245
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,750
You're never gonna give up
on me, are you?

246
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:26,540
Hey!

247
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:29,040
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

248
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:32,250
You don't need to feel guilty
about being happy.

249
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:35,125
You deserve to be with her.

250
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,833
Wait.

251
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,875
There's no good version of me.

252
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,416
What are you gonna do?

253
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,583
Break the cycle.

254
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:47,250
Jinx!

255
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,208
I'm sorry.

256
00:23:07,541 --> 00:23:08,666
I've been an idiot.

257
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,458
And an ass.

258
00:23:11,875 --> 00:23:13,000
You're hurting too.

259
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:18,540
For as long as I can recall,

260
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:21,375
I have chased the archetype of a Medarda.

261
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:25,666
I believed it my calling
to merit the blood in my veins.

262
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,041
It was all a lie.

263
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,624
This blood is alien to me.

264
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:36,875
Yet it has dictated the course
of my entire life.

265
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,541
I'm no more than a passenger.

266
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,166
A life I spent in self-pity.

267
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,332
Now it's gone.

268
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,333
I can never return to it.

269
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
I've been confused about a lot lately.

270
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,375
But there's one thing I know in my bones.

271
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,375
There is no force in this world

272
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:00,458
that can control you.

273
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:10,625
You will never be a passenger.

274
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,208
Quiet.

275
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:42,500
Forgive me.

276
00:24:43,208 --> 00:24:44,875
But we don't have much time.

277
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,125
A storm is coming,

278
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:49,832
the likes of which Piltover,

279
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:53,000
perhaps Runeterra itself, has never faced.

280
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,541
This creature infiltrated
the very room you're standing in.

281
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,083
And we barely survived.

282
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:11,040
Hundreds more are on the way.

283
00:25:11,041 --> 00:25:12,916
The Noxian general is leading them.

284
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:18,582
This isn't a fight for ideals
or territory.

285
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:21,000
It's a fight for humanity itself.

286
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:22,541
I'm asking...

287
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,749
No, begging you, every one of you,

288
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,957
Topside and bottom,

289
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,000
to aid us in this coming war.

290
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,458
And it will be a war.

291
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,165
Now, this isn't a fair request,

292
00:25:37,166 --> 00:25:38,666
but it is our only hope.

293
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,541
The forces against us are too great.

294
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,416
We need every hand we can get.

295
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,708
Bring them down!

296
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:07,790
We're abandoning the city's outskirts
to stage our defense at the Hexgates.

297
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:10,250
The final bastion of our salvation.

298
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,625
If you choose to flee, don't stop running.

299
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,625
But I'm choosing to fight.

300
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,625
And I pray that you will join me.

301
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:56,041
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

302
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:09,541
Just a moment.

303
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:19,541
Here, ma'am.

304
00:28:25,125 --> 00:28:26,875
Had a feeling I might find you here.

305
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,041
I really believed she'd help.

306
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,375
Say it.

307
00:28:36,083 --> 00:28:37,790
You told me so.

308
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:40,749
I was an idiot to trust her.
I went behind your back.

309
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,541
I choose wrong every time.

310
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,708
And because of it, I've lost everyone.

311
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:57,083
You really think I needed
all the guards at the Hexgates?

312
00:29:02,666 --> 00:29:06,208
Sorry to say,
you've grown a bit predictable.

313
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:28,707
Uh, listen, while you were gone,
I saw someone...

314
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:29,625
Cait.

315
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,250
I don't fucking care.

316
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,583
Take watch of the Herald.

317
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,583
You're alive.

318
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:37,000
I know about the Black Rose.

319
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,582
You know a facade.

320
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,707
They are nothing but lies.

321
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:47,790
You taught me
the best lies come wrapped in truth.

322
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,833
What really happened to Kino?

323
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:53,124
Your brother was struck with curiosity.

324
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:54,499
He got caught in their web

325
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:57,499
and, with every action,
grew more deeply entangled.

326
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,000
So you let him die?

327
00:32:00,375 --> 00:32:02,832
I carried him in my belly,

328
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,957
nursed him from my bosom.

329
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:08,166
He was all the sweetness in my heart.

330
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,707
For that, they took him,

331
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:13,708
carved into me a wound
that will never close.

332
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,374
I pray you never suffer the agony

333
00:32:18,375 --> 00:32:21,708
of being forced
to forsake one child to save another.

334
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,666
You should have come to me.

335
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:29,415
You'd have made
the impossible intolerable.

336
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,624
I did what you could not.

337
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:32,665
For you.

338
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,833
For the family.

339
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:37,458
Piltover has nothing to do with your feud.

340
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:40,749
Board your boats, leave our shores.

341
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,499
I will join you.

342
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,083
We can avenge Kino together.

343
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:50,290
This is more
than vengeance, child.

344
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:55,624
These mages dangle over our heads a sword
that impales us should we rise too high.

345
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:59,874
Their very nature violates
the most core of Noxian principles,

346
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:03,582
that every one of us is equal
on the battlefield.

347
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,415
That through cunning,

348
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,333
sweat,

349
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,333
and steel...

350
00:33:10,208 --> 00:33:12,500
we shape our destinies.

351
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:17,624
The fact you've come
to parley for your friends' lives prove

352
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:20,165
you still lack the wrath necessary

353
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,041
to defeat an enemy like the Rose.

354
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,000
I've found another way.

355
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,125
Imagine, child,

356
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:38,249
an army that need never fear death.

357
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,041
What have you done, Mother?

358
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:56,666
Doctor.

359
00:33:57,916 --> 00:33:59,916
You may begin the process.

360
00:34:06,541 --> 00:34:07,791
Very well.

361
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,208
I guess this is goodbye.

362
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:36,416
Thank you very much for your company
in my solitude, Ms. Young.

363
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,750
I will miss our talks.

364
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:53,708
No.

365
00:34:57,625 --> 00:34:58,625
You won't.
