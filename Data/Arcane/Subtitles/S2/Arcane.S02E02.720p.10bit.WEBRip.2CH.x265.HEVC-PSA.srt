1
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:20,416
<i>Well, it's all going to shit.</i>

2
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,541
<i>Chembarons warring
for control of the Lanes.</i>

3
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:30,083
<i>Wannabe street thugs
squabbling over scraps.</i>

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,291
<i>Just like when Vander shoved off.</i>

5
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,291
<i>Except this time...</i>

6
00:00:39,125 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>you aren't here
to put it all back together, because...</i>

7
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:49,166
<i>Because someone put
all those holes in you.</i>

8
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,291
<i>Vi used to say I could fix anything.</i>

9
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:04,833
<i>Before I broke everything.</i>

10
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:08,666
<i>She used to say a lot.</i>

11
00:01:10,083 --> 00:01:11,416
<i>Her and you.</i>

12
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:15,000
<i>Always bossing me around.</i>

13
00:01:17,208 --> 00:01:19,000
<i>Now it's so quiet.</i>

14
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,791
<i>What am I supposed to do with that?</i>

15
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,208
<i>Have you had enough?</i>

16
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,250
You feel it?

17
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,832
That...

18
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,375
...buzzing behind your eyes?

19
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,290
Because you know, in a moment,

20
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,000
it could all... poow!

21
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,541
Hmm.

22
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,416
Best feeling in the world, kid.

23
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,582
Yep, that's me.

24
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,957
You ever need to curse a sibling

25
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,125
or a family or a society...

26
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:30,958
{\an8}my card.

27
00:06:46,875 --> 00:06:48,999
Well, you know, far be it from me,

28
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,957
but, uh, you hired me to run the numbers.

29
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:55,540
And ever since we've gone up
against the other chembarons,

30
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,707
the numbers are in the, uh...

31
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,790
Shitter?

32
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,374
Not exactly the term I...

33
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,540
Ever wonder why fat brains like you
always wind up working for grunts like me?

34
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,916
No, uh, never.

35
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,415
You only use half your head.

36
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,790
Plotting moves.

37
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:11,540
Calculating odds.

38
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,874
Know how Silco took hold of the Lanes?

39
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:16,207
With his bare teeth.

40
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:19,457
It just, you know, seems, uh, hasty.

41
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,999
Last count, Margot had
at least ten hitters guarding the stash.

42
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,415
Margot and Chross can buck
all they want, but in the end,

43
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,332
I'll be the one smiling.

44
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,082
Until I'm in Silco's chair,

45
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:35,041
your only job is
to make the numbers work, hmm?

46
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,624
The Grey.

47
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,915
All the way up here?

48
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:53,582
What do you know? Cleared the place out.

49
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,915
Might have made our jobs a lot easier.

50
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:57,457
No, no, no. We can't.

51
00:07:57,458 --> 00:08:00,499
It's factory smog trapped underground.

52
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,915
No more, no less.

53
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,833
Boss.

54
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,790
You-- You go on ahead.

55
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:12,041
Report back.

56
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,250
Me?

57
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:01,790
I know you're all fantasizing
about sawing each other's heads off.

58
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,708
So I'm gonna get right to it.

59
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,040
These turf wars have to stop.

60
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:09,790
These two have been the aggressors.
I've only defended my interests.

61
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,374
Playing coy doesn't suit you, love.

62
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,915
You started this dance
when you raided the Rapturewalk.

63
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:17,499
What could I want
with your boulevard of filth?

64
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,665
Topside is the real enemy.

65
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,999
Us killing each other
is playing right into their hands.

66
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,290
Our best shot is
to put aside these petty squabbles

67
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,082
and join forces.

68
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,665
Ally with these two?
I rather favor my chances with Topside.

69
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,832
Even together,
they outnumber us four to one.

70
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,582
That's before all the recent casualties.

71
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,040
Might matter up there,

72
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:42,125
but they don't know the first thing
about fighting in the fissures.

73
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,124
Hmm.

74
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,208
Is he dead?

75
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,041
Why is he so quiet?

76
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:50,291
She's right.

77
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,332
We don't get Topside off our backs,
we don't last.

78
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,665
But I got a different solution.

79
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:58,457
We give them Jinx.

80
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,083
It's all they really want.

81
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,707
We don't hand over our people.

82
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:08,499
"We"? You don't do much
of anything anymore, do you, magpie?

83
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,458
Bird without a wing's
just a funny-looking rat.

84
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,249
Struck a nerve, did I?

85
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,499
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

86
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,082
You help me put a bow on Baby Blue
for our friends upstairs,

87
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:26,083
I'll cut you a brand-new puncher,
top of the line, all the fixings.

88
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,874
Think on it.

89
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:29,290
But I promise,

90
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,708
it's the last offer you're gonna get.

91
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,583
I can't believe you're dead
and I'm still mopping up your messes.

92
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:24,625
Jeez, lady, you crazy?

93
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,458
Talking to dead people.

94
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,583
You here to finish me off?

95
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,416
Haven't I done you enough favors?

96
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,666
Same time every day.

97
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,583
Big baby couldn't do it himself.

98
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,540
- Couldn't do much himself.
- Mm.

99
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:07,665
About now, he'd have me all over the Lanes
running his collections.

100
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,040
Building his weapons.

101
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,332
Making his deals.

102
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,208
Exploding his enemies.

103
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,124
He dips out,

104
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,416
the whole world flips over.

105
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,749
All his plans.

106
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,041
Everything we built.

107
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,916
The hell we supposed to do now?

108
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,250
Watch it all burn.

109
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,125
What'd I tell you?

110
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,958
<i>Viktor.</i>

111
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:15,624
<i>Viktor.</i>

112
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,749
<i>Viktor!</i>

113
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,124
<i>Viktor...</i>

114
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,332
<i>Viktor!</i>

115
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,082
<i>Viktor...</i>

116
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,500
<i>Viktor.</i>

117
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:15,666
Jayce?

118
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,500
Viktor?

119
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:23,583
My God.

120
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:25,750
What...

121
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,541
am I?

122
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:29,666
You're...

123
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,166
You're alive.

124
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,332
You're-- You're alive.

125
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,708
Oh! Oh, uh...

126
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,833
You must be cold.

127
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,958
Cold.

128
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,000
No, I don't think so.

129
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,749
I sense a charge.

130
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,000
A potential.

131
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,333
A recursive impulse.

132
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,666
Unpleasant, but...

133
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:06,083
"cold" isn't its name.

134
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,499
The Hexcore.

135
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,082
Viktor, it saved you.

136
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:17,915
Somehow it-- It adapted to your injuries,

137
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,374
changing and evolving.

138
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:22,666
It was as if it was connected to you.

139
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,415
I did my best using the notes
from your leg. Recorded everything.

140
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:29,875
- There are still so many questions, but--
- I was supposed to die.

141
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,874
You promised to destroy the Hexcore.

142
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,957
No.

143
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:36,499
Don't you see?

144
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,041
Heimerdinger was wrong.

145
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,624
We were wrong. It's not as bad as we--

146
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:43,165
It killed Sky, Jayce.

147
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:44,083
What?

148
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,833
No.

149
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:48,416
She had such dreams.

150
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,083
As did we once.

151
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:05,374
I'm going to resign from the Council.

152
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,874
I understand now.

153
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:10,166
My place was always here
in the lab with you.

154
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,083
We'll make this right. Together.

155
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,791
I must say goodbye
to this place now.

156
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,250
To you.

157
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,625
Goodbye?

158
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,832
Viktor, you're my partner.

159
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,666
Our paths diverged long ago.

160
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:30,291
It was affection that held us together.

161
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,874
You think it's so easy?

162
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:37,500
To turn your back while your city
looks to you for salvation?

163
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:41,625
To cling to principles while
your best friend bleeds out in your arms?

164
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,083
I never asked for this.

165
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,750
Where are you going?

166
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,041
Goodbye, Jayce.

167
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,000
There's so many of them.

168
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,291
It's all the fighting.
We're gonna have capacity issues soon.

169
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,832
Then there's the security risk.

170
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:22,208
We're not turning people away.

171
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,916
All these years,
we finally get rid of Silco,

172
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:29,790
just so a new one can take his place.

173
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:33,666
Now watch this.

174
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,041
Oh, this is quite troubling.

175
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,791
That tree means so much.

176
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,458
It's our food. Fresh air.
We built our whole identity around it.

177
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,165
Every time it seems
like we might catch a break...

178
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:10,290
Ah, now, it's not lost yet, lad.

179
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:14,625
If there is a means of preservation,
by golly, we'll find it.

180
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,666
I have seen something
of this nature before.

181
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,833
Oh.

182
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,750
Ch-ch-ch.

183
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:48,540
Hmm.

184
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,165
Don't you essentially own this place?

185
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,291
Shh.

186
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,208
Come on.

187
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:05,125
The brambleback
has left the jungle.

188
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:10,375
Uh, you do realize code phrases don't work
when you make them up on the spot?

189
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,250
Shh.

190
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,832
Professor?

191
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,790
Yes, of course.

192
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,666
- What the devil's gotten into you?
- I thought...

193
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,458
Why are you breaking into my lab?

194
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,125
And who's he?

195
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:57,124
This is my new pupil, Ekko.

196
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,291
Ekko, my former pupil Jayce.

197
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,958
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

198
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:07,374
I apologize for the intrusion.

199
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,916
We were attempting to sneak in.

200
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,790
Oh, pishposh. Like you've never done it.

201
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,541
Were you sleeping here?

202
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,166
You drink tea, Ekko?

203
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:28,833
Ah.

204
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:33,250
You're right.

205
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,540
It matches the corruption we saw

206
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:40,040
on the plants we tested with the Hexcore,
but where did you say you found this?

207
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,540
Deep in the underground.

208
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,790
Ekko's home is a marvelous place.

209
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:44,915
Truly a wonder.

210
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,165
- You should see what--
- Hey.

211
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,040
Uh, right, uh, when I said "home,"

212
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,415
I was, of course,
referring to his cognitive center.

213
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:57,874
- Not a physical location hidden in the...
- Heimer, what are you doing?

214
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,708
Did any of the plants survive?

215
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,666
They weren't what we were trying to save.

216
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:04,708
But this pattern.

217
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,791
How could it be there and here?

218
00:21:11,625 --> 00:21:12,500
Oh, no.

219
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,458
Where's Viktor?

220
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,166
It's okay.

221
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,458
<i>Viktor.</i>

222
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:04,416
<i>Viktor.</i>

223
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,333
Hmm.

224
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,291
Hmm.

225
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,125
Hmm.

226
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:44,416
Hmm.

227
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:09,291
It's all clear.

228
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:12,916
Sorry, commander.

229
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,500
Baby Blue.

230
00:27:33,791 --> 00:27:35,374
Right through their fingers.

231
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:37,332
You must be part eel.

232
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,165
Just means I can up my finder's fee.

233
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:42,500
There's always a deal to be struck.

234
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:46,790
Ah, ah, ah. They want you alive.

235
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,665
But don't think
I won't skewer out those peepers.

236
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:52,291
Drawback of you long-range types.

237
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,833
Me? I'm the kind of guy
who likes to get in close.

238
00:27:57,208 --> 00:27:59,540
Never thought I'd catch you blubbering.

239
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:02,290
Wonder if Silco even saw that.

240
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:03,208
Twice.

241
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,375
When he met me

242
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:07,333
and when I killed him.

243
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,040
You?

244
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:11,249
It's always me.

245
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:13,457
Whether I'm pulling the pin or not,

246
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:16,125
everyone who gets close to me dies.

247
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,333
Wanna know the real kicker?

248
00:28:20,541 --> 00:28:25,291
You're the kind of guy
who likes to get in close.

249
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,333
Poow.

250
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:49,500
Hmm?

251
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,541
Huh?

252
00:30:47,541 --> 00:30:50,999
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
There's a deal to be struck here.

253
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,290
You forget, Smeech?
You already made your last offer.

254
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,083
Tell me,

255
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:18,666
who's a funny-looking rat now?

256
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,415
Fancy meeting you here.

257
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:47,250
Moron never could keep
his damn mouth shut.

258
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,040
You could've just let me eat it.

259
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,375
Haven't I done you enough favors?

260
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,458
I didn't ask you for this.

261
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:02,750
It was something I could fix.

262
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,666
You got that look in your eye again.

263
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:07,791
What are you planning?

264
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,416
To finish what's left of my family.

265
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:18,166
Oh, God.

266
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:36,833
<i>Viktor.</i>

267
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:39,750
<i>Viktor.</i>

268
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:50,707
Careful not to scrape up the gear.

269
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:53,125
Won't sell as well.

270
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:06,249
Nothing personal, friend.

271
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,000
We just got needs we can't ignore.

272
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:17,541
So much senseless pain.

273
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,750
What are you doing?

274
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,375
You need not suffer anymore.

275
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:58,916
But...
