Up again?

32
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:56,332
The city's not going anywhere.

33
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,666
I have an audience with the Masons' Guild
first thing in the morning.

34
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:03,915
Let me guess.

35
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:05,707
Complaints about the Noxians.

36
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,582
Hmm. They doubled
their fortification requests.

37
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,040
Again. To keep--

38
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:11,541
Keep us safe.

39
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,583
I never expected this to go on so long.

40
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,291
I thought...

41
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,916
I don't know what I thought.

42
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,291
Just...

43
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:25,791
it wasn't this.

44
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,374
You could call it off.
Withdraw from the underground.

45
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:35,666
Reestablish the Council.
All you have to do is give the order.

46
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,166
Not without Jinx.

47
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,540
Besides, a withdrawal could lead
to a worse situation than the one--

48
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,541
Ah. Okay, Ambessa.

49
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,249
She delivered us Zaun,

50
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,166
as she vowed.

51
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:00,125
Without her, who knows
how many Enforcers we'd have lost?

52
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,500
I've learned so much from her.

53
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,624
You're our leader.

54
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:08,125
The Enforcers, Piltover, they follow you.

55
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:12,875
I follow you.

56
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,250
I'll come to bed soon.

57
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:29,124
Ladies and gentlemen,

58
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,165
you're in the wrong place.

59
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:33,332
Scumbags and scalawags,

60
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,332
put your hooks and paws together

61
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:38,124
for the meanest, ugliest,

62
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:41,125
goriest spectacle of your lives.

63
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,249
In the gray corner,

64
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,290
our undefeated champion.

65
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,957
With claws like daggers

66
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,207
and teeth like sharper daggers.

67
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,582
The devilish,

68
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,290
the wretched

69
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,624
Stink Maw!

70
00:04:55,625 --> 00:04:57,665
And in the other gray corner,

71
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,832
the challenger.

72
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,166
A rising star,

73
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,290
with hideous mandibles

74
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,540
and a face
that would make a brood mother squirm.

75
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,208
The creepy,

76
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,957
the dastardly

77
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,290
Scuttle Butt!

78
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,790
Two will enter.

79
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,625
And after that, who knows?

80
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:23,624
Handlers, release your beasts.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,040
No, no. What are you doing?

82
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:45,666
Show some effort.

83
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,790
Congratulations on your victory.

84
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,249
Well, you're past your prime, champ.

85
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,041
Only thing to do is--

86
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,749
Hmm. A rematch?

87
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,624
Return of the titans.

88
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,582
Vengeance. Redemption.

89
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,207
The inexplicable release of bodily gases.

90
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,207
All right, all right.

91
00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:25,624
I still think it's a dumb idea.

92
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,666
But I guess you won, and a deal's a deal.

93
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:30,416
I guess.

94
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,333
Ta-da!

95
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,041
You like it?

96
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:46,499
You're lucky.

97
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,958
I didn't get to do much of this
with my older sis.

98
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,916
She was more into...

99
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,500
hitting things.

100
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,416
I had a different name back then,
you know.

101
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:01,791
Powder.

102
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,750
Stupid, right?

103
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,000
I thought I was rid of her
for good, but, uh...

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,916
you kind of remind me of her.

105
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:13,875
Pew.

106
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,500
Did Sevika put you up to this?

107
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,499
That's a past life, kid.

108
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,916
And it was about as sweet
as last year's milk.

109
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,166
Jinx is dead.

110
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,208
Hmm.

111
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:43,457
How, in a city teeming
with brilliant inventors,

112
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:47,875
have we managed to unearth
such unrelenting incompetence?

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,499
This is their doing.

114
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,040
We can't be certain the Black--

115
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,125
Keep their name out of your mouth.

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,290
We can't be certain the Order
was also behind the disappearance

117
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,374
of Jayce and Heimerdinger.

118
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,624
Who else?

119
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:06,582
The moment we seize control
of this backwater,

120
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,207
everyone with an inkling
of talent vanishes.

121
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,082
It's no coincidence.

122
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,416
Our instincts were right.

123
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,458
They fear Hextech.

124
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,583
But we were too slow.

125
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:21,541
How could I not secure the scientists?

126
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,708
They have my daughter, Rictus.

127
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,458
Our moment will come.

128
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,916
But you must be prepared.

129
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,374
<i>To expedite processing,</i>

130
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,332
<i>have any and all bags open</i>

131
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,625
<i>and ready for examination.</i>

00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,915

133
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:54,540
<i>as we make every attempt to ensure

134
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,000
Next. Move along.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,540
<i>To expedite processing...</i>

136
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,749
You have Jinx to thank for this.

137
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,916
She is not your friend.

138
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,415
She is not your champion.

139
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,499
She hides while you suffer.

140
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,457
And yet you refuse to hand her over.

141
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,540

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,916

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,083
You're right.

149
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,500
It's hers.

150
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,790
I'd recognize it anywhere.

151
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,915
That's where the similarities end.

152
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:24,250
No body count. No theatrics.

153
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,875
You think it's a copycat?

154
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:31,000
I think we've made them desperate
for something to believe in.

155
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,957
This doesn't have to change what we talked
about this morning. You can still--

156
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:39,166
Officer Nolen.

157
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,583
Quite the familiar face these days.

158
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,290
General.

159
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,666
I'd like a word with Commander Kiramman.

160
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,416
In private.

161
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,374
I suppose I don't need to advise you

162
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,249
on the hazards
of professional entanglements.

163
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,541
Nor is that the advice
you rushed here to provide.

164
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,499
It's beyond question
that the news of Jinx's return

165
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,957
will ignite Zaunite resistance.

166
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,957
But the blade cuts both ways.

167
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,332
There's a trail.

168
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,541
We have her scent.

169
00:12:18,666 --> 00:12:21,499
I'd expected this development
would encourage you.

170
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:26,000
Was it for my encouragement that
your man Rictus was instigating violence?

171
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,541
You don't trust me.

172
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:31,166
"The blade cuts both ways."

173
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,332
Fearless child.

174
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,083
You never shy.

175
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,375
You have a recommendation?

176
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,915
If it wasn't Jinx at the checkpoint,

177
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,040
one of them knows where she is.

178
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,082
Arrests require cause.

179
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:53,665
What greater cause is there
than returning peace to this city?

180
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,416
Why is peace
always the justification for violence?

181
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,041
We've lost so many.

182
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,791
The anger, the sorrow...

183
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,374
It's tiring.

184
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,666
Gods, I know it's tiring.

185
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:25,916
But you will never rest
knowing that she's out there.

186
00:13:27,708 --> 00:13:30,625
Or maybe I underestimated you.

187
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,666
Maybe you have the strength I do not.

188
00:13:34,416 --> 00:13:35,583
To forgive

189
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,166
and trust in tomorrow.

190
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,666
The decision is yours, commander.

191
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:54,208
I hosted the most lavish galas
in the city.

192
00:13:57,458 --> 00:14:00,790
It was a measure of status
to be on my guest list.

193
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,333
Toast of the town.

194
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:07,124
Now people avert their gaze
when I roll by.

195
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,415
My gaze isn't averted.

196
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,249
Oh, spare me.

197
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,665
I wouldn't have hired you

198
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:15,540
if you weren't versed in the art
of indulging your clients' egos.

199
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:19,332
Plus you're one of the few councilors
left from the old batch, right?

200
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,832
Never learned anything
about the younger Medarda, did they?

201
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:26,207
Even when she's not here,
she's all anyone talks about.

202
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:27,332
I get it.

203
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,249
She's the last heir of the great Medardas.

204
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,124
But the writing's on the wall.

205
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:35,750
When you're missing this long,
you're not coming back.

206
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:39,541
- Same time next week?
- Tomorrow.

207
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:42,708
The effects have been diminishing.

208
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,291
Huh.

209
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,915
I keep hearing about this healer
down in the fissures,

210
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,124
way out on the fringes.

211
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:53,375
They say he makes miracles happen.

212
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,332
I saw one.

213
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,790
Like nothing I'd ever seen before.

214
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,291
Can't hurt to look, can it?

215
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,499
You could have warned me.

216
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,040
Fat chance. About what?

217
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,832
Your stunt at the checkpoint.

218
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,750
No idea what you're babbling about.

219
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,625
That wasn't you?

220
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,583
Hmm.

221
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,083
Hmm.

222
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,290
Well, however it happened,

223
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:34,291
the whole undercity's buzzing,
saying you're back.

224
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,082
- So I'm thinking--
- Not your strong suit.

225
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,165
Would make a world of difference
if you showed up.

226
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,415
You're a symbol.

227
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,166
Ha. You want a symbol?

228
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:52,874
Silco spent his whole life
trying to rally the undercity together.

229
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,790
Stupid joke that it is,

230
00:15:54,791 --> 00:15:57,250
you have the chance to pull it off.

231
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,374
I told you, I'm not interested.

232
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,165
Do you know how much
he sacrificed to protect you?

233
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,665
He believed in your potential.

234
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,583
Well, then he shouldn't have died!

235
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:13,582
We're having a rally tonight.

236
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:14,915
Vander's statue.

237
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,415
Firelights, your fans...

238
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,040
Anyone I can bring to the table.

239
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:22,165
Stick your head in the dirt if you want,

240
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:25,749
but this fantasy
you've been living out here,

241
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,916
it's not gonna last forever.

242
00:16:30,291 --> 00:16:32,208
Don't trip on the way out.

243
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,625
I don't know how you do it, kid.

244
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,458
I gotta go bother someone.

245
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,833
Still giving me the silent treatment, huh?

246
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,124
Between you and Isha,

247
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,375
I'm losing my snappy comebacks.

248
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,625
Me, a hero.

249
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:12,375
How screwed up is this place?

250
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,207
I know Sevika's right,

251
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,125
and I probably owe it to you,

252
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,540
on account of the murdering and all.

253
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:26,833
But I got something going now.

254
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,415
A friend.

255
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,208
And I don't want to mess it up.

256
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,500
Maybe that's what I was like for you.

257
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:46,999
If you care so much about me
playing your stupid revolution game,

258
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,750
speak up now, or I guess...

259
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,875
I guess you...

260
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,500
You're really gone.

261
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,708
And there's no reason
to stay here anymore.

262
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,916
Statue...

263
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:28,250
Vander's statue...

264
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,500
<i>It's no secret we got history.</i>

265
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,833
<i>Blood spilt on all sides.</i>

266
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,916
<i>But we grew up on the same streets.</i>

267
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,833
Ate the same scraps.

268
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,874
Like it or not,
we're in this mess together.

269
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,540
Enforcers raiding our homes.

270
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:10,040
Noxians down our throats.

271
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:13,249
Innocents getting carted off
to Stillwater.

272
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,665
We gotta choose right now
whether we're gonna throw in the towel

273
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,750
or make a stand together.

274
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,040
Not as Firelights

275
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:24,624
or Jinxers

276
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,499
or washed-up goons.

277
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,540
- As Zaunites.
- We wanna see Jinx!

278
00:20:28,541 --> 00:20:30,040
Where is Jinx?

279
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:32,665
Where is she?

280
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,415
We wanna see Jinx!

281
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,665
Yeah, where is she?

282
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,708
Yeah, where's Jinx?

283
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,290
You're all under arrest.

284
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:00,874
- Drop the blade.
- Drop it.

285
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:02,832
Drop the blade.

286
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,583
I'm back.

287
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,791
Time to find out
who's the new pebbleweight--

288
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,500
Hmm? Isha?

289
00:22:46,416 --> 00:22:49,207
Okay, I get it.

290
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:51,041
We're playing that game, are we?

291
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,625
Isha?

292
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:00,999
They got her.

293
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,207
What?

294
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:03,791
She came to the rally.

295
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,124
Topside raided the place.

296
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:07,958
Took everyone.

297
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:11,707
<i>You know what you are.</i>

298
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:14,165
- <i>Damn it, Powder!</i>
- Shut up. Shut up.

299
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,625
Shut up. Shut up.

300
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:18,750
<i>Stop calling me that.</i>

301
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:22,374
<i>Her name is Jinx.</i>

302
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:23,666
<i>She's my sister.</i>

303
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:27,207
- <i>Jinx.</i>
<i>- You have to be someone else.</i>

304
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:28,333
<i>Jinx.</i>

305
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:31,291
<i>Jinx.</i>

306
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,291
Chin up, little one.

307
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,625
I'll tell you a secret.

308
00:24:00,791 --> 00:24:02,416
We won't be staying long.

309
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,957
Don't suppose you can swim, huh, Lefty?

310
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,125
Well, only leaves the fun option.

311
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:49,541
I'm gonna hate this, aren't I?

312
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,832
Ha! It's me.

313
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,207
Your vile villainess.

314
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:07,290
The author of your nightmares.

315
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:08,874
The, uh, dread of your--

316
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:10,333
Who are you?

317
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,665
Mm, Jinx?

318
00:25:14,666 --> 00:25:17,707
Yeah, never heard that before.

319
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,082
You're not gonna haul me in?

320
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:22,124
Claim the prize? Be the big hero?

321
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:25,915
You expect me to believe Jinx,
the master criminal,

322
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,375
wears pants like that?

323
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,790
What's wrong with my pants?

324
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:32,833
You look like
a half-eaten circus tent.

325
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,000
Ugh! I am Jinx.

326
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:54,625
"Half-eaten."

327
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,333
Can we focus?

328
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,291
Oh... Oh, oh, oh...

329
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:14,541
Let's go.

330
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,999
Whoo! Big mama.

331
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,540
How'd you take her in?

332
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:23,375
I gave her a choice between this
and a swim in the harbor.

333
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,708
Cell Block C. Carry on, officer.

334
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,915
Yes, sir.

335
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,000
Move it.

336
00:28:06,083 --> 00:28:07,875
Come on, man. I have a kid.

337
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:09,958
You can't keep us in here.

338
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,582
Here I am,

339
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,875
your big fat hero.

340
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:15,833
You're late for
Stink Maw's great comeuppance.

341
00:32:08,708 --> 00:32:10,333
What the hell was that?

342
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,083
Move it.

343
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:18,875
Stand down.

344
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,041
Get her out.

345
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,707
You really are a--

346
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:28,958
Big fat hero.

347
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:56,458
You got me, hairball.

348
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,500
But just remember...

349
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:02,416
you're no Stink Maw.

350
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:04,916
Smile.

351
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,875
Powder?
