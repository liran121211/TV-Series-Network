1
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:18,832
Well, folks there he is,

2
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:22,332
the butterflyweight champion
of the Piltover Boxing League,

3
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,875
Gustove "The Scowler" Jowler!

4
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,457
Looking good, sis.

5
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,333
Wait, just--

6
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,707
I don't wanna hear another word
out of your mouth.

7
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,249
It's Vander.

8
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,583
I'm not falling
for another one of your tricks.

9
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,416
He's...

10
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:13,208
alive.

11
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:19,791
We both know that's bullshit.

12
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:40,666
He needs our help.

13
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,666
I can prove it.

14
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,125
<i>Months of peacekeeping occupation.</i>

15
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,500
<i>Countless operations.</i>

16
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,958
<i>Oceans of sweat and tears.</i>

17
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,958
<i>I'd begun to think we might finally see
an end to Zaun's perverse abominations.</i>

18
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,666
<i>How foolish was I?</i>

19
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,083
The beast came for you.

20
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,833
It was summoned by you.

21
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,749
In my experience,

22
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,875
only guilty men
answer accusations with silence.

23
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:27,665
In my experience,

24
00:06:27,666 --> 00:06:29,875
no one in power is innocent.

25
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,790
There are cells
buried deep within this prison

26
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,374
so devoid of light

27
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,499
and fresh air
and all basic human considerations

28
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,665
that up till now,
I have forbidden their use.

29
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,207
If you do not want to waste away

30
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:46,125
the remainder of your days
in one of these, you have one recourse.

31
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:01,958
Tell us everything we need to know
to hunt down this beast.

32
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,333
Your youth betrays you.

33
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,290
Patience is a product of age.

34
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:11,875
Both of which I possess in abundance.

35
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,457
This is your final chance.

36
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,416
Tell me what you were planning.

37
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:21,875
How was Jinx involved?

38
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,416
You will rot in here.

39
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,166
Elora?

40
00:08:02,166 --> 00:08:04,541
Black Rose.

41
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:09,624
Hope you find these quarters
to your liking.

42
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,499
They still haven't replied
to my requests for a transfer.

43
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,458
Who's there?

44
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,165
Not sure I know anymore.

45
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:22,333
Our hosts have a way
of scrambling your omelet.

46
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:27,708
They killed my friend.

47
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:30,291
Elora was there.

48
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,083
And then...

49
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,666
Elora!

50
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,665
Ah. The stewards of the old world

51
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:44,166
are always keen
to give you a glimpse of their might.

52
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,708
What is this place?

53
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,000
Near as I can tell,

54
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,207
an Oculorum.

55
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:54,874
According to legend,

56
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:59,499
the ancients built specialized chambers
to seal away false prophets.

57
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,540
But if you ask me,
they're just the fancy pits

58
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,416
peacock princes like
to toss their friends into.

59
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,666
Peacock princes?

60
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,624
Sorry, just an old family joke.

61
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,707
You know, the kind of rulers
with an artistic flair.

62
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,166
Step into the light.

63
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,666
Kino?

64
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,916
It's me, brother.

65
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,458
Mel.

66
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:50,708
Mel.

67
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,708
You've grown up.

68
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,208
I'd hoped they'd never come for you.

69
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,333
This is where I lost him.

70
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,457
Cool, huh?

71
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,291
Not even toxic.

72
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,375
Pretty sure.

73
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,749
Why would Vander be all the way down here?

74
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,290
Beats me.

75
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,625
Ask him yourself.

76
00:12:37,208 --> 00:12:40,791
When will you admit
that this is just one of your fantasies?

77
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:44,249
Or do you not want the kid
to know how delusional you are?

78
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,249
She wasn't always like this.

79
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,500
She actually used to be pretty cool,
before I kicked her butt.

80
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,665
See what I mean?

81
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,875
Delusional.

82
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,582
Wish I was just seeing things
when you decided

83
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,749
to throw in with the Piltie goons
who murdered Mom and Dad.

84
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,207
At least they never had to see
the psycho their daughter turned into.

85
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,291
Which one?

86
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,790
Wake up, sis.

87
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:10,999
I'm a hero.

88
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,415
I busted half of Zaun out of Stillwater

89
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:16,332
while you were passed out
in the bottom of a mug.

90
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,833
Now can it and keep walking,
before I kick your ass again.

91
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,874
You wouldn't last one second

92
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:26,874
without all your ugly gadgets
and chickenshit tricks.

93
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,457
Ha! What about those
overdesigned bitch-mittens

94
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,625
you didn't even build yourself?

95
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,958
You think I need these to--?

96
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,333
There. One second.

97
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,957
Last chance to surrender.

98
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,125
Go right ahead, fat hands.

99
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,208
Hey, kid.

100
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,583
Still got all your insides?

101
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:22,875
Mm.

102
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,416
But don't ditch us.

103
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,291
Why'd you come get me?

104
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,500
You don't actually need my help.

105
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,041
You haven't for a long time.

106
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:03,040
Last time Vander needed us,
we tried it alone,

107
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:07,166
and nothing was ever the same.

108
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,208
So...

109
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,125
maybe this is like a do-over.

110
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,791
Besides,

111
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,916
he's your father too.

112
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,833
I've been expecting you.

113
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,415
Confident, aren't you?

114
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,332
It's always the same look

115
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,166
when one covets a weapon.

116
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,791
I've fought battles from the Bloodcliffs
to the Dalamor Plain.

117
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,750
I've never seen a beast of such savagery.

118
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,166
No beast is more savage than man.

119
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,625
I trust you have terms.

120
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,791
You will serve me.

121
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,457
My enemies will be yours.

122
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:11,499
Your weapons will be mine.

123
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,707
In return, I will supply all your needs.

124
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:17,457
You will be treated
as an esteemed adviser.

125
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:20,166
But I demand absolute loyalty.

126
00:16:27,541 --> 00:16:29,332
Do not test this,

127
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:32,416
or you will yearn for Caitlyn's dungeons.

128
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,375
You already know what I want.

129
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:38,999
He isn't a monster.

130
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,707
He was once a man.

131
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,583
Well respected, at that.

132
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,333
Victim of great tragedy.

133
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,458
<i>He had a ferocious will to live.</i>

134
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,208
<i>An incredible tolerance for pain.</i>

135
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,000
<i>With him,</i>

136
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:06,291
<i>I was able to make strides
impossible with any other specimen.</i>

137
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:09,833
<i>But the mind...</i>

138
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,791
<i>The mind I could not recover.</i>

139
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,583
<i>The man forever lost
in the bowels of the beast,</i>

140
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,458
<i>compelled only by the scent of blood.</i>

141
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,916
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

142
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,416
<i>It now seems
I had yet to uncover the right catalyst.</i>

143
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,833
Blisters and bedrock.

144
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,791
There was a funeral
for you in Noxus.

145
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,291
Oh. Did Mother commission a statue?

146
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,249
I held rites in Piltover.

147
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,875
She believes you're dead.

148
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:18,958
I do like to disappoint her.

149
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,708
How did you know to do that?

150
00:18:36,541 --> 00:18:37,500
I don't know.

151
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,625
I just felt...

152
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,375
It's like some sort of puzzle.

153
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,749
Kino, what happened to you?

154
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,333
How did you wind up here?

155
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,166
She didn't tell you.

156
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:02,874
After a few rounds with
some dubious noblefolk in Basilich,

157
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,666
I started hearing strange rumors
about Mother.

158
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,415
Different than the usual kind.

159
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,999
They said, many years ago,

160
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,458
she passed through their hometown and...

161
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,208
fell in love.

162
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,958
That's not our mother.

163
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,540
Indeed.

164
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,125
But the more I inquired,
the more I started believing it.

165
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,457
The old travel logs.

166
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,250
The local accounts.

167
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:32,041
I should have left it alone, but...

168
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,125
The affair led to a child.

169
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,916
That's impossible.

170
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,541
It is the reason we are here.

171
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:48,333
Simply put,

172
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,958
whatever that child inherited
is of terrible interest to our captors.

173
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:12,583
This will allow you to locate your beast?

174
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,208
Not precisely.

175
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,832
My family archives
have shed light

176
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,875
on many of this city's mysteries.

177
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:29,291
Commander.

178
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,000
General.

179
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:35,458
One such mystery caught my attention.

180
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,333
The curious dismissal
of a revered academy alchemist.

181
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,125
Unparalleled, by all accounts.

182
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,749
And no mention of his crime.

183
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,374
This led to one other missing puzzle piece

184
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:03,166
whose absence has always
gnawed at my mind.

185
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,583
Who invented Shimmer?

186
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,291
We have our answer now,
don't we, Dr. Reveck?

187
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,500
You're a monster.

188
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,291
Why?

189
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,458
Why do all this?

190
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:36,958
Why does anyone commit acts
others deem unspeakable?

191
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,583
For love.

192
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,124
Perhaps,

193
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:24,750
in another life...

194
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,083
you would have been friends.

195
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,708
Everything I've done is to cure her.

196
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,458
I believe the beast may hold
the final key.

197
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:44,416
Precisely what are you trying to cure?

198
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,250
That affliction we all suffer.

199
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:53,541
Death.

200
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,583
Imagine a world
that no longer need fear it.

201
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,166
- Mel?
- I'm getting us out of here.

202
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:21,958
Hmm.

203
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,124
Say this is some sort of sordid labyrinth.

204
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:32,165
Usually there are consequences
for someone who fails these tests.

205
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,749
Deadly consequences.

206
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,541
I deserve to know the truth.

207
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,582
Of course.

208
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,207
Makes you wonder
why she kept this from you, doesn't it?

209
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,916
For all these years?

210
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:44,875
I'm missing something.

211
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:49,708
A healthy sense
of self-preservation, I'd say.

212
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:04,208
You aren't my brother.

213
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:14,583
Who are you? What have you done with Kino?

214
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,416
We had such high hopes for him.

215
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,250
At first, it seemed plausible
that he could have been the child.

216
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,666
But then your mother...

217
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,250
led us to you.

218
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Sister.

219
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:40,375
What is it?

220
00:26:41,375 --> 00:26:42,708
A message from Vander.

221
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,083
To Silco.

222
00:26:51,416 --> 00:26:54,957
- "Silco, I've looked everywhere, but..."
<i>- I've looked everywhere, but...</i>

223
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:57,166
<i>it's clear you don't wanna be found.</i>

224
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,165
<i>God, I'm shit at this.</i>

225
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,416
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

226
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:04,999
<i>When she died, I lost my head.</i>

227
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,249
<i>I told myself what I did to you
was for the greater good,</i>

228
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,750
<i>that you deserved it.</i>

229
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:12,583
<i>But the dirt was on both our hands.</i>

230
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,083
<i>Anyway, you know where to find me.</i>

231
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,958
<i>Blisters and bedrock.</i>

232
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:20,125
<i>V.</i>

233
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,166
If he found this,

234
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,916
everything might have been different.

235
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,583
We have to get out of here.

236
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:36,707
It's him. It's Vander.

237
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:38,832
- That's not Vander.
- It is.

238
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,375
Something's got him riled up.

239
00:28:41,958 --> 00:28:44,249
No, Vander, no.

240
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,832
It's me.

241
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:03,708
He's gonna kill you.

242
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,583
Don't hurt him.

243
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:36,250
Hark!

244
00:29:58,625 --> 00:30:00,540
Vi, it's him.

245
00:30:00,541 --> 00:30:02,666
You have to believe me.

246
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,665
Vander!

247
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:30,624
What's the occasion?

248
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:34,582
Hmm. Can't a lady
just be in the mood for a familiar song?

249
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,750
Not this lady,
and not this song.

250
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:05,665
Tonight a harebrained scheme
these two bozos cooked up

251
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:10,750
to turn a dank crack in the earth
into a thriving, healthy community

252
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,540
became a reality.

253
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:13,916
Tonight, eh?

254
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,291
You hear that, Bozo 2?

255
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,958
We made it. We're done.

256
00:31:19,708 --> 00:31:21,541
Oh, you're sadly mistaken.

257
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,457
I'm Bozo 1.

258
00:31:23,458 --> 00:31:26,083
A night of revelations.

259
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,458
I'm knocked up.

260
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:46,041
- A girl.
- How do you know?

261
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,415
Mm. Wasn't really part of my plan,

262
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:52,833
but guess that's everything
when you're living week to week.

263
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,500
What did Connol say?

264
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,166
I haven't told him.

265
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,166
Working up the nerve.

266
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:03,832
I don't know anything about kids.

267
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:06,374
I get sweaty being alone with one.

268
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:09,415
Hey, you're gonna be a great mother.

269
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:10,582
Shut up.

270
00:32:10,583 --> 00:32:12,333
I'm not ready for that.

271
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:18,499
I started trying to come up with a name,
and it hits me that this one word

272
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,208
is a decision
she's gonna live with her whole life.

273
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,082
I can't protect her
from all the shit down here

274
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:30,000
and work out how to be a parent
at the same time.

275
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,040
Then I realized,

276
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:35,207
I don't have to.

277
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:37,249
Hmm? Why's that?

278
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,374
Because the second I told you,
I put you on the hook.

279
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:43,666
You two are gonna figure
this Zaun thing out.

280
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:48,083
I don't care if you have to carve it
out of the bedrock, covered in blisters.

281
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,375
You're not allowed to fail anymore.

282
00:32:50,916 --> 00:32:51,833
For her.

283
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:53,916
For me.

284
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,833
What's the point
if we can't raise an ankle biter or two?

285
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:02,582
To Zaun, then.

286
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:08,125
Blisters and bedrock.

287
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,791
I've always liked the name Violet.

288
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,958
What are you waiting for?

289
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,708
He's your dad too.

290
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,708
Salo?

291
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,083
What are you doing here?

292
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:12,916
Jayce.

293
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,750
One could ask the same question.

294
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,666
How are you walking?

295
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Who do you think could mend
such a broken creature?

296
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,000
Would you want to speak with him?

297
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:36,708
Jayce.

298
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:40,915
I'd feared I wouldn't have the chance
to speak with you again.

299
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:42,166
Viktor?

300
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,458
I would prefer to converse in person.

301
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,875
But there's so much work to be done.

302
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,125
How are you doing this?

303
00:36:55,791 --> 00:36:59,250
I suppose this is
somewhat beyond where we left off.

304
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:02,833
Is Salo still in there?

305
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:06,374
Where else would I be?

306
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:07,832
You have my solemn vow

307
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:11,457
that anything you discuss
will be kept in the strictest confidence.

308
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:12,916
I owe Viktor...

309
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:14,541
everything.

310
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,250
Very kind, Salo.

311
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:24,750
I have so many breakthroughs
to share with you, Jayce.

312
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,541
I thought you were done with Hextech.

313
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,333
And me.

314
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,583
I was clouded by emotions.

315
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:37,665
Come. Visit me.

316
00:37:37,666 --> 00:37:39,375
See what I've accomplished.

317
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,666
I've helped so many.

318
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,708
You've given Hextech
to the people?

319
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:01,833
As we always promised we would.

320
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,791
Viktor has truly worked wonders.

321
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:08,707
Hextech isn't a miracle.

322
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,040
It's a curse.

323
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,000
We have to end it, Viktor.

324
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,208
We have to.

325
00:38:16,083 --> 00:38:17,708
You seem different.

326
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,458
Something happened.

327
00:38:23,166 --> 00:38:24,875
Now I see it.

328
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:28,166
You, too, have touched the Arcane.

329
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:31,750
Your mind suffered.

330
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:42,083
If you'll excuse me,

331
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:44,666
I must return to him.

332
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,999
I can't let you leave.

333
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,499
I'm sorry you feel that way.

334
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,666
I'm sorry too.
