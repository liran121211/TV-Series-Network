1
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:03,999
Huh?

2
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,500
You're beyond help.

3
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,290
Whoa, relax, jumpy.

4
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:10,457
I've got a new idea...

5
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,540
Uh, did you just throw that?

6
00:01:17,541 --> 00:01:18,875
Stay... Stay back.

7
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,583
Oi.

8
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,208
What in the seven sumps
is all this racket?

9
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,875
Oi, one of those days, huh?

10
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,790
You know those ugly twins,

11
00:01:34,791 --> 00:01:36,624
genius and madness.

12
00:01:36,625 --> 00:01:39,540
Maybe take the madness outside.

13
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,999
I still got a business to...

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,083
Oh.

15
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,791
What's gotten into him?

16
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,332

17
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,874

34
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:45,666
Hey, spaceboy,

35
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:48,583
I'm not talking to myself over here.

36
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,041
What is up with you?
You've been out of it all day.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,249
I feel like
I woke up in the wrong universe.

38
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,915
This is what happens
when you stay up all night.

39
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,665
Those synapses start firing around

40
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,499
like drunk slugs.

41
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,583
There's still plenty of time
before the competition.

42
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,665
Okay? We'll work out the kinks.

43
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,874
I've got you.

44
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,000
Ah, if it isn't Zaun's royalty.

45
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,041
My liege.

46
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,415
Sit down.

47
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,208
Hey, hey, little man.
Trouble in paradise?

48
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,415
Just the usual project woes.

49
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,915
Tell me about it.

50
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:33,332
We finally got the hybrids
to feed off the fissure gases,

51
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,374
but the conversion rate's way too low.

52
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,332
They hardly grow.

53
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,457
They're nowhere near robust enough
to purify all the air down here.

54
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:43,457
- Unless you plant a million of them.
- No way we're doing that.

55
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:45,790
And we've tried cultivating the soil,

56
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,541
infusing the water.

57
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,374
No luck.

58
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,624
I'll be right back.

59
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,707
Oh, no.

60
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,916
Go. Save him from himself.

61
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,874
Where would you be without her?

62
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,208
Hey, Gert.

63
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,082
No. Oh, come on.

64
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,790
- Hey...
- Hey, Gert.

65
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,665
Do the Chem Sisters
have another show coming up?

66
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,082
Mylo here is a big fan.

67
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,083
Like, huge.

68
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,165
Cool.

69
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,957
Uh, yeah, the old man's gonna let us
play the party the night before

70
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,290
that Innovators Competition
you all are gunning for.

71
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,874
What would they do without you?

72
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:46,457
There would probably be some arm-flailing.

73
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:53,125
You know, one thing I learned
as a bartender:

74
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,874
As good as it feels
to pour everyone's drink,

75
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,541
you need to fill your own cup
every now and again.

76
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,040
Let me guess.

77
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,249
You think I'm holding myself back.

78
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,583
I think you're too smart
to spend your life in a bar.

79
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,000
Hey, professor.

80
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,625
- Professor?
- Am I late for a gathering of the minds?

81
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,458
Whoa.

82
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,708
Oh.

83
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,415
One can't shout from the rooftops

84
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,915
about being thrust
into parallel dimensions

85
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:52,041
without awkward consequences.

86
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:58,540
It seems the anomaly which dislodged us
from our proverbial reality

87
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,250
also scattered us across time.

88
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,208
Man, I thought I was going crazy.

89
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,749
How long have you been here?

90
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,124
One thousand,
one hundred twenty-eight days,

91
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,957
six hours, and twenty minutes.

92
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:13,916
Give or take.

93
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,540
So you've just been waiting for me
all this time?

94
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,999
Precisely. Or rather, imprecisely.

95
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,874
I grew skeptical you'd arrive,

96
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,749
even during my unusually long lifetime.

97
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,750
What about Jayce? Is he here?

98
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,957
I fear he may have wound up elsewhere.

99
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,540
The anomaly behaved
differently around him.

100
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,416
Tell me you figured out a way
to get us home.

101
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,249
That is a veritable conundrum.

102
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,082
I'm afraid Hextech
was never invented here.

103
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:51,499
And without a creation
so prodigious as the Hexgates...

104
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,124
No anomaly.

105
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,582
Oh, it isn't all bad.

106
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,832
I've been able to accomplish
wonderful things in this world.

107
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,290
Give it time to settle.

108
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:03,833
This place will grow on you. You'll see.

109
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,124
Grow on me?

110
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,540
I have people back home who need me.

111
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,124
We don't belong here.

112
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,957
And yet we can't leave.

113
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,832
I'm gonna find a way back,
with or without you.

114
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,166
- Oh!
- Oh. Uh...

115
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,000
I was gonna go see Vi.

116
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:23,582
Vi?

117
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:24,874
You wanna come?

118
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:28,082
<i>What have we done?</i>

119
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,166
Hello?

120
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:21,541
Is anyone out there?

121
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:29,666
Who's there?

122
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:39,666
You.

123
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,208
Did you bring me here?

124
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:46,833
Where are we?

125
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,666
Wait!

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No.

127
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,666
It can't be.

128
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,124
What's with
the third degree, Ekko?

129
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,250
We've been working on this for months.

130
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,207
Humor me.

131
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,749
You had one of your funky dreams

132
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,582
about an energy-storage device
that you swore would win the competition.

133
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:47,457
So you came to me for help.

134
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,124
I came to you?

135
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,790
You weren't gonna figure it out yourself.

136
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,416
"Zero-loss chemical energy cell."

137
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,333
And this invention.

138
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:02,165
You don't have
some alternative purpose for it?

139
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,040
You're the big idea guy.

140
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,666
Sorry, sis.

141
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:10,291
Someone's wigging out over his project
and having an identity crisis again.

142
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:11,875
No names.

143
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:17,624
I got the "not living up to my potential"
speech from Vander again.

144
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:18,958
Reminds me of you.

145
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,333
Hmm?

146
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,541
She's dead?

147
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,375
How?

148
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,125
That's not funny, Ekko.

149
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,290
It was a mistake to come here.

150
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:36,083
What's that supposed to mean?

151
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:40,958
Just 'cause you're having a bad day,
don't take it out on me.

152
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:42,708
Was it you?

153
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,249
You gave us the tip.

154
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,832
We went on that job because of you.

155
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,666
The job.

156
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,415
That's why there's no Hextech here.

157
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,499
You should leave.

158
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,415
Go. Before I do something I regret.

159
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,708

201
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,166
Thank you very much.

202
00:16:31,875 --> 00:16:35,541
You think you can recreate the anomaly
with these?

203
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,208
That's the theory.

204
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,750
Inconceivable.

205
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,875
So you'll help me?

206
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,790
I meant that quite literally.

207
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,833
I don't believe this can be done.

208
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,082
Tampering with the Arcane

209
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,749
never ends well, lad.

210
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,750
The risk is far too great.

211
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,458
You said I was your pupil.

212
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,375
I need a professor.

213
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,833
Better yet,

214
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:00,333
a partner.

215
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:04,291
Oh, blast nozzles.

216
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,124
How could I forsake
a brilliant lad in need?

217
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,375
<i>Again.</i>

218
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,625
<i>I never asked for this.</i>

219
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,916
<i>That research is everything.
My whole life.</i>

220
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,666
<i>He was my mentor, Mel.</i>

221
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:51,833
<i>And I betrayed him.</i>

222
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,833
<i>You must destroy it.</i>

223
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:56,916
<i>It corrupts.</i>

224
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,165
<i>Consumes.</i>

225
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,957
<i>I was trying to create magic.</i>

226
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,458
- <i>Piltover...</i>
<i>- It's your time now, Jayce.</i>

227
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,499
<i>Perhaps it's time.</i>

228
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,915
No, no.

229
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,582
<i>For the era of magic.</i>

230
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,165
<i>I've seen nations destroyed...</i>

231
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:12,166
<i>Please.</i>

232
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,708
<i>...exactly like this.</i>

233
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:24,958
Watch your step.

234
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,290
We're almost there.

235
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,499
I don't know what this is all about,

236
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,041
but if you're trying to apologize,
dragging me through the...

237
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:40,125
You painted this?

238
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,125
I had this dream...

239
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,291
where things went another way.

240
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:50,375
She looks so badass.

241
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,374
You don't know the half of it.

242
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,040
She was the toughest person
in all of Zaun.

243
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,707
Nothing scared her.

244
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,375
No, not my sister.

245
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,625
Vi was strong because she was afraid.

246
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:07,875
Her fear of losing us
is what made her fight so hard.

247
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,915
- You were different in my dream too.
- Oh, yeah, buster?

248
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,957
Is that what this is about?
You want me to change?

249
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:16,875
No.

250
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,708
No, no, I just...

251
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:25,500
You aren't the kind of person who helps
other people with their projects.

252
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:28,916
Your ideas change the world.

253
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:33,500
I can't shake the feeling
that that's who you're supposed to be.

254
00:21:34,041 --> 00:21:36,125
Things are good, Ekko.

255
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,500
I like my life.

256
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:43,290
I don't wanna lose what makes me "me"

257
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,250
chasing some wild dream.

258
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:53,958
Sometimes taking a leap forward
means leaving a few things behind.

259
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:58,082
You're a real mystery, aren't you, mister?

260
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:02,916
All right, out with it.

261
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:04,666
What do you want from me?

262
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,583
Hmm.

263
00:23:57,125 --> 00:23:58,250
Huh.

264
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,208
It's so small.

265
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,166
Golly, we've done it.

266
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:46,958
Halfway there.

267
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,375
So, what does it do?

268
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:56,958
Uh...

269
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,707
So, what does it do?

270
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,500
You just asked me that.

271
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,207
No, I didn't.

272
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,625
I'm too tired for games.

273
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,708
No, I didn't.

274
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,249
It's a time loop.

275
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,500
Huh? A time loop?

276
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:29,416
- Huh? A time loop?
- A time loop.

277
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,832
You're going back in time.

278
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,457
Gadzooks. How did you stumble upon that?

279
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:39,374
I was playing with inversions
on Jayce's acceleration rune.

280
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,582
How far did you go?

281
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,582
I don't know. A second?

282
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:45,290
- Try going back further.
- Take it slow, lad.

283
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:48,957
We wouldn't want to push
a new invention too far too quickly.

284
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,250
Mm...

285
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
One.

286
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:29,875
Two.

287
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,583
Three.

288
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,540
- Gadzooks.
- Four.

289
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:44,707
The limit is four seconds.

290
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:47,708
Are you certain, my boy?
What were the indicators?

291
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,166
Trust me.

292
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,083
It's four seconds.

293
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,374
- Amazing.
- Hmm.

294
00:26:54,375 --> 00:26:56,541
We could show it off at the party.

295
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,125
We aren't done.

296
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:03,208
Please go change before the party.

297
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,083
I think I might know
how to give it a boost.

298
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,457
A boost?

299
00:27:15,458 --> 00:27:17,874
A momentary upgrade, if you will.

300
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,124
That's great. Where do we start?

301
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:22,458
You can start by attending your party.

302
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:26,249
One's thoughts are
more easily gathered in isolation.

303
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,832
And what's the point of a device like this

304
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:31,125
if you don't enjoy the time you have?

305
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:14,125
You load it through here
and then you wait for it...

306
00:28:15,958 --> 00:28:17,749
It's just a prototype for now...

307
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:22,915
There he is.

308
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:25,499
Hey, nervous, kid?

309
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,207
Big day tomorrow.

310
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:28,958
It's all I can think about.

311
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,291
Where's the little lady?

312
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:35,874
Not sure. She said something
about making an entrance.

313
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:38,916
She does love a spectacle, eh?

314
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,083
Yeah.

315
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:48,208
Hey, in case I don't remember
to tell you tomorrow,

316
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:51,416
you've always meant the world
to me, Benzo.

317
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:53,874
Oh.

318
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,165
Well, you, uh...

319
00:28:56,166 --> 00:29:00,624
Ach. Uh, you...
Oh, don't get all mushy on me now.

320
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:01,541
Hey.

321
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:08,165
- Making the big man misty, are you?
- Oh, these damned allergies.

322
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:10,415
You should be proud of yourself, Ekko.

323
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,875
Powder's been raving about your Z-Drive.

324
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:16,166
Can't remember the last time
I saw her so alive.

325
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:20,707
I have the feeling
that you'll be running this place soon.

326
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:23,665
So there's a chance for us yet.

327
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,250
You?

328
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:29,665
Didn't think
I'd miss your big day, did you?

329
00:29:29,666 --> 00:29:31,791
Didn't you try to kill him?

330
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:37,624
Greatest thing we can do in life
is find the power to forgive.

331
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:38,958
Ach.

332
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,624
Some night.

333
00:30:55,625 --> 00:30:57,083
It's beautiful.

334
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,750
Where'd you learn those moves?

335
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:03,916
<i>Oh, I was just following your lead.</i>

336
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,750
<i>Mm.</i>

337
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,415
<i>He's got lines.</i>

338
00:31:09,833 --> 00:31:11,625
<i>Hey. Uh...</i>

339
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,125
I just want to thank you.

340
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,500
You know, for everything.

341
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:22,583
<i>I used to dream
the undercity could be like this.</i>

342
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:27,750
<i>But somewhere, I got consumed
by all the ways it wasn't.</i>

343
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:30,625
<i>I gave up on it.</i>

344
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,458
<i>Gave up on you.</i>

345
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:38,250
I've never seen you
give up on anything, Ekko.

346
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,000
You ever wish
you could just stay in one moment?

347
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:49,791
Sometimes taking a leap forward means...

348
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:52,666
leaving a few things behind.

349
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,166
I promise I'll never forget this.

350
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:57,041
You better not.

351
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,916
- Sorry, I...
- No...

352
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,083
It's fine, I...

353
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:10,250
Can we just pretend
like it's the first time?

354
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:50,582
Ekko, my lad. You're just in time.

355
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,332
This is a big upgrade.

356
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:53,790
Just a moment.

357
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,833
I only need
to hook up the final power supply.

358
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,416
Whoa.

359
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:21,375
This is where it all started, isn't it?

360
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,541
The end of Piltover.

361
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,583
Because of Hextech.

362
00:34:34,916 --> 00:34:36,708
Why did you ever give me this?

363
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,833
Why?

364
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,250
It doesn't have to go this way, right?

365
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:52,374
Just tell me there's a chance.

366
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,540
Oh, I do wish
I could apologize to Ms. Powder

367
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:10,666
for co-opting her space like this.

368
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,250
It truly was the only way.

369
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:31,708
Send me back.

370
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,625
Never a dull moment.

371
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:16,665
I must say that since I've met you, lad,

372
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,290
I've truly lived.

373
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:19,208
What?

374
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,750
- Back in a wink.
- No! Heimerdinger, wait! Wait!

375
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,250
I won't fail.

376
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,083
I swear it.

377
00:36:58,666 --> 00:36:59,791
No!

378
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:48,708
Powder?

379
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:50,625
Huh?

380
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:52,916
What happened?
