1
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,666
Mel.

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,708
Mel, are you okay?

3
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:08,708
It's okay.

4
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,625
No.

5
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:43,874
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

6
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,833
Go, go.

34
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,749
She was a great woman.

35
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,250
A good friend.

36
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,458
I don't know
how we'll face this crisis without her.

37
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,083
To think we nearly extended sovereignty

38
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,541
to the creatures who did this.

39
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:19,291
We're charged with imposing order.

40
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,541
And we've been asleep at our posts.

41
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,458
Well, my eyes are open.

42
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,083
There will be no more fairy tales of peace
until we scour our basement of its demons.

43
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,000
So kind of you
to assist Councilor Salo, Mother.

44
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,082
As we are at war,

45
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:40,250
I thought it prudent to solicit the advice
of such an experienced veteran.

46
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,707
Let us address the matter at hand.

47
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,165
Our people are scared, suffering.

48
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,582
They need to know their leaders
have the situation under control.

49
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,665
An unprecedented show of force.

50
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:56,124
We flood the undercity with Enforcers,
armed with Hextech.

51
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,916
Innocents will be caught
in the cross fire.

52
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,082
How many more councilors have to be
blown to pieces before you wake up?

53
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:03,333
We are under siege.

54
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:09,333
What is she doing here?

55
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,290
Officer Kiramman witnessed
the attack firsthand.

56
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,708
She confirmed this was the act
of a single deranged individual.

57
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,249
Jinx.

58
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,374
Silco is dead.

59
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,457
The underground, leaderless.

60
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:23,582
If we follow your plan,
we risk unifying them against us.

61
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,125
So, what is your solution? Chastisement?

62
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,874
A firm reprimand?

63
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,040
We use their division against them.

64
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,624
Pin the attack on Jinx,

65
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:34,374
post a reward too substantial to ignore.

66
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:38,499
I'm sorry, Mel. I'm not comfortable
trusting our fates to chance.

67
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,124
Jinx has proven elusive.

68
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:43,833
Our healing can only begin
once she's been brought to justice.

69
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:51,625
Then it's settled, 2 to 1.

70
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:53,375
We invade.

71
00:07:57,541 --> 00:08:00,499
If I may? In crises such as these,

72
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,374
it's imperative you present
a unified front to the public,

73
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,541
whatever your personal feelings.

74
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,125
How wise.

75
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:14,208
I'll agree to endorse the invasion.

76
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,500
But I draw the line at Hextech.

77
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,165
We have an ethos.

78
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,166
Such force must be a final resort.

79
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,875
Agreed.

80
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,708
Then it's settled, 2 to 1.

81
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,916
I had the shot.

82
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:03,166
Your mother left this to you.

83
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:06,083
The Kiramman Key?

84
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:08,083
No, I'm not...

85
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,415
I don't deserve it.

86
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:13,125
It's your legacy now, Caitlyn.

87
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,166
What is she still doing here?

88
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:56,375
Hey.

89
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,958
You were right, Cait.

90
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,916
Powder's gone.

91
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:25,915
I can make this right.

92
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,790
If you get Jayce to fix the gauntlets,
I can do this myself.

93
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,666
No one else needs to get hurt.

94
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,124
No.

95
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,749
No more rogue mission.

96
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,874
No more reckless plans.

97
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,249
My mother was right.

98
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,874
My arrogance led me
to take on more than I could handle,

99
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,500
and she paid the price.

100
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:48,833
They're sending
all the Enforcers after Jinx.

101
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,375
I'm going with them.

102
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:54,125
Please, I have to help.

103
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,583
You can.

104
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,000
As one of us.

105
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,332
Cait, I can't wear this.

106
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,791
People are calling for blood.

107
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,915
The Council won't stop them.

108
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,958
You can show
that not all of Zaun supports Jinx.

109
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:17,000
We can show them.

110
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:18,958
Together.

111
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,290
I watched them kill my parents.

112
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,540
Do you have any idea how that feels?

113
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,541
Yes. I do.

114
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,291
I thought you were on our side.

115
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,791
You didn't think at all.

116
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,791
Hey, watch it.

117
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:14,833
Sorry.

118
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,666
Not my first.

119
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,333
You all right?

120
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,665
You, uh...

121
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,833
lose someone in the attack?

122
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,375
How is he?

123
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,916
Same as before. Breathing.

124
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:19,583
Pulse is consistent.

125
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:21,625
Beyond that,

126
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,166
your guess is good as mine.

127
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,958
What's it doing to him?

128
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:46,915
The Hexcore has been evolving.

129
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:50,165
Shifting through runic patterns
faster than I can keep up.

130
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,791
All I know for certain
is that it's keeping him alive.

131
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:57,458
It's the sort of puzzle
Viktor would love if he wasn't...

132
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,166
It should be me up there instead of him.

133
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,458
Don't say that.

134
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,332
He'll come back to us.

135
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,832
I still don't understand.

136
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:13,332
He was right next to me.

137
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,665
How does the explosion do that to him,
and I just...?

138
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,708
I just walk out without a scratch?

139
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,208
There's no sense to these things, Jayce.

140
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,666
How'd it go with the Council?

141
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,458
My mother's entered the game.

142
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:36,874
She's already gotten her hooks into Salo.

143
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,833
Using his grief
to make a play for Hextech.

144
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,499
Mel, I promised Viktor,

145
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,791
never again.

146
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:46,374
It's all right.

147
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,415
I handled it.

148
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,833
I won't let them corrupt your dream.

149
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,833
Caitlyn was there.

150
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,957
You might pay her a visit.

151
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,666
She hides it admirably,
but the poor girl's in so much pain.

152
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,458
<i>Hey, Sprout.</i>

153
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,624
How'd you find me?

154
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:01,541
Your dad.

155
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,958
Mother and I used to come here
when we needed an escape.

156
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,750
One of the few places we never argued.

157
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,416
I'm sorry I haven't been around.

158
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,707
How's Viktor?

159
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,250
I can't even tell if he's still in there.

160
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,041
Ever since it happened...

161
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,708
three faces keep spinning through my mind.

162
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,375
I see Mother.

163
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,583
When they found her.

164
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,832
And every fiber of me just sinks,

165
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,291
like a stone swallowed in dark water.

166
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,083
But then there's Jinx.

167
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:45,708
Laughing.

168
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,707
I want to tear that laugh
from her throat forever.

169
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,625
Cait.

170
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,124
I know.

171
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,874
I just understand now

172
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,999
how easy it is to hate them.

173
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,791
One vicious act.

174
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:02,250
<i>Then I see Vi.</i>

175
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,332
I asked her to put on the uniform.

176
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,791
Suffice to say, she declined.

177
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,375
Vi? Wear a badge?

178
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,666
She thinks those gauntlets of yours
will solve all her problems.

179
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,416
What if she's right?

180
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,082
Hextech may keep us alive, Jayce,

181
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,000
but it's not what will save us.

182
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:34,750
Me.

183
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:37,833
Join the peanut patrol. Ha.

184
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,541
And I thought she had no sense of humor.

185
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,540
I like peanuts.

186
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,790
Her dad's right.

187
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,041
There's no point
in sticking around up here.

188
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:50,708
Except...

189
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,375
I'm the one who created the monster.

190
00:18:58,916 --> 00:18:59,750
Vi?

191
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,875
Who are you? And how do you know my name?

192
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,333
Junior Officer Nolen.

193
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,249
Maddie.

194
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,333
And, uh...

195
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,416
it's written on your face.

196
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,582
So, what is it?

197
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:26,665
Random search?

198
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,500
Escort off the property?

199
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,083
Or you just here to waste my time?

200
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,290
Search? No.

201
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,290
No, no. Heh.

202
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:38,249
Uh, you're something of a legend
amongst the Enforcers.

203
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,208
Caitlyn made quite a scene at the station
when they tried to deny your enlistment.

204
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,041
Now I have to ask,

205
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,540
is it all true?

206
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,707
You went after Silco alone
when the Council wouldn't back you?

207
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,250
Took on his whole gang?

208
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,290
Cait said all that?

209
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,082
She said if every Enforcer
had a heart like yours,

210
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,790
we could take on Noxus itself.

211
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,791
Then she threatened
to withdraw her family's funding.

212
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,125
Anyhow, I'm glad you're joining up.

213
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,208
Hmm.

214
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,707
After the sheriff betrayed us...

215
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,375
Well, let's just say...

216
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,458
it's nice to know
there are still good ones left.

217
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,875
Officer Nolen.

218
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,000
Duty calls.

219
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:46,125
A real honor, Vi.

220
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,707
- Go ahead, ma'am.
- This way, ma'am.

221
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:12,250
- Stop.
- Please keep moving, folks.

222
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,166
Mm-hm.

223
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,541
One of the many privileges
of serving as your councilor

224
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,916
is having the occasion now and again
to stand behind this podium

225
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,041
to behold so many

226
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:07,125
joined together not by birth or dictum
but by all that we share.

227
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:09,583
Our hope.

228
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,958
Our curiosity.

229
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,958
Our compulsion to leave behind us
a world better than that before.

230
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:24,083
These things we share
are what make us one people.

231
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:42,250
Today we share an unthinkable loss.

232
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,625
Councilor Irius Bolbok,

233
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,999
Councilor Torman Hoskel,

234
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,416
and Councilor Cassandra Kiramman
were taken from us.

235
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,000
But they shall not be forgotten.

236
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,832
We commissioned this statue

237
00:23:00,833 --> 00:23:03,791
so we may remember them
for their countless contributions...

238
00:23:06,291 --> 00:23:08,208
their lifetimes of service.

239
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:13,040
Not for the craven act
that stole them away.

240
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,832
Ma'am, you can't go in...

241
00:23:19,208 --> 00:23:21,583
Though we've suffered
a terrible blow,

242
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:26,500
I assure you,
the rule of law prevails in Piltover.

243
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:29,500
- No.
- We will find those responsible.

244
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,791
And they will account for their crimes.

245
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,500
Awful, isn't it?

246
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,416
Losing a loved one.

247
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:15,166
You aren't safe up here, toppers.

248
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,416
None of you are safe.

249
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,166
Look out!

250
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:07,790
Go.

251
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,290
Get the counselors out of here.

252
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,374
I have an idea.

253
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,832
What are you doing?

254
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,875
For my son.

255
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:08,500
Come on.

256
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,291
Shit.

257
00:31:46,833 --> 00:31:48,415
Perimeter secured.

258
00:31:48,416 --> 00:31:49,333
We'll see.

259
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,958
Thought you were gonna
get yourself killed.

260
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:13,000
Here, come with me.

261
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,582
A memorial.

262
00:32:14,583 --> 00:32:15,666
I got you.

263
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:18,957
What kind of animals?

264
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:20,957
They wanted the spectacle.

265
00:32:20,958 --> 00:32:22,707
They're trying to scare you.

266
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:25,041
All they did is piss me off.

267
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:26,458
You...

268
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,040
You need to find a way
to call off the invasion.

269
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:31,082
What?

270
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,249
This battle was on your soil.

271
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,540
Down there, you'll be on their terms.

272
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,457
None of this is on our terms.

273
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,750
- Maybe you should change that.
- I don't know how, okay?

274
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:45,249
She dies and leaves this giant hole,

275
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,666
and I'm just supposed to fill it.

276
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,666
Like she was never there to begin with.

277
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,000
Hey.

278
00:32:52,583 --> 00:32:53,416
You won't.

279
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,750
The hole gets smaller, but...

280
00:32:56,791 --> 00:32:57,875
you never fill it.

281
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,750
I was wrong to spring the badge on you.

282
00:33:07,125 --> 00:33:08,374
It's just...

283
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,166
every way I slice it,

284
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,665
if I go after your sister alone,

285
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:14,791
one of us comes back in a box.

286
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,208
It's all coming apart.

287
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,000
No, it isn't.

288
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,833
We won't let it.

289
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:41,166
<i>I know you doubt
the merit of your birthright, Caitlyn.</i>

290
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:44,333
<i>There's wisdom in that.</i>

291
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,208
<i>But remember:</i>

292
00:33:51,708 --> 00:33:53,041
<i>You're a Kiramman.</i>

00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,040

<i>♪ Heavy is the crown ♪</i>

301
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:26,832
Never in our lifetimes
has Piltover's leadership been forced

302
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,958
into the dungeons of our capitol.

303
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,958
But here we are.

304
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:37,666
Does anyone still doubt that our enemy
is greater than one deranged individual?

305
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,957
How did they sneak so many
of these things into the ceremony?

306
00:34:41,958 --> 00:34:45,040
I thought we took every measure
to secure it.

307
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,541
They must have had help.

308
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,375
From someone up here.

309
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:51,124
We can't afford
any more handwringing.

310
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,249
If we do not defend ourselves
with Hextech,

311
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,291
our principles will mean nothing.

312
00:34:56,875 --> 00:34:58,665
I...

313
00:34:58,666 --> 00:35:01,082
We aren't prepared
for a full-scale invasion.

314
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,957
The undercity's attack proved that.

315
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:06,000
This is a closed Council meeting.
Who let you in here?

316
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:09,082
I am a decorated officer.

317
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,790
Leader of House Kiramman.

318
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:12,749
Address me with respect,

319
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,666
or keep your mouth shut.

320
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,833
I will lead a strike team into Zaun
with three objectives:

321
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,500
locate Jinx,

322
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,500
<i>dismantle Shimmer,</i>

323
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:28,333
<i>and neutralize any agents
still loyal to Silco.</i>

324
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:32,541
What makes you think
you'll fare better than our forces today?

325
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,500
<i>We've got a few surprises
of our own.</i>
