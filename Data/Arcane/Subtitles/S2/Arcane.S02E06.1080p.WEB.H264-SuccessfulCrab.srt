1
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,125
<i>I see it now.</i>

2
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:55,415
<i>I can't let you leave.</i>

3
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,915
<i>I'm sorry you feel that way.</i>

4
00:00:59,916 --> 00:01:01,375
<i>I'm sorry too.</i>

5
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,125
Poor Salo.

6
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:23,499
That isn't Jayce.

7
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,333
But there is another will
at work within him.

8
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:31,040
I thought I heard something
just before the portal closed.

9
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:32,582
Ancient, like a...

10
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:33,916
Like a voice.

11
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:38,208
This is a sophisticated conjuration.

12
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,332
A singularity,

13
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,790
simultaneously self-replicating
and self-annihilating.

14
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,708
We've never seen complexity like this.

15
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,458
Flawless...

16
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,583
exquisite...

17
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:57,541
chaos.

<i>defining it by three core principles.</i>

34
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,000
<i>Vision.</i>

35
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,250
<i>The top of the triangle.</i>

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,415
<i>Charting a course,
and having the wisdom to navigate it.</i>

37
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,332
<i>This form is your base, child.</i>

38
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,250
<i>Your eyes see what others don't.</i>

39
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,458
<i>Might.</i>

40
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:46,625
<i>Bending your environment to your will.</i>

41
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,082
<i>Your speed is improving.</i>

42
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:53,250
<i>But eventually you need force.</i>

43
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,833
<i>Too much force
exposes you to risk.</i>

44
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,333
<i>Indeed.</i>

45
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,416
<i>The last is guile.</i>

46
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,665
<i>Phantoms.</i>

47
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,125
<i>Tricksters.</i>

48
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:14,915
<i>Mages.</i>

49
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:16,333
<i>Absent honor.</i>

50
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,832
<i>Absent accountability.</i>

51
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,208
<i>Remember this, Caitlyn.</i>

52
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,291
<i>Tunnels in your eyes.</i>

53
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,040
<i>Lava in your veins.</i>

54
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,166
<i>Shadows in your heart.</i>

55
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,416
This is the truth of combat.

56
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,791
I've discovered a fourth principle.

57
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:47,208
One that heightens all others.

58
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,582
Sacrifice.

59
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,583
The temper born of suffering.

60
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,208
We understand it as others cannot.

61
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:58,916
We are kin.

62
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,666
Pardon the interruption.

63
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,125
I've tracked him to Zaun.

64
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,791
Let's hunt a beast.

65
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,416
Vi.

66
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,583
I hoped you might return.

67
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,375
You filthy traitor.

68
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:42,666
Yes.

69
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,124
That was me at my worst.

70
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,333
Simply awful.

71
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,374
But the Herald has freed me
of my past self.

72
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:53,416
He's given me a chance to make amends.

73
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,707
- Excuse me. Some water?
- All are welcome.

74
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:01,374
But I must ask you
to surrender your weapons.

75
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,124
This is a place of peace.

76
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:04,416
Ugh.

77
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:10,208
Hm.

78
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,541
Welcome, you two.

79
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,875
Hello, friend.

80
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,125
Would you like some fruit?

81
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,750
The Herald's vision.

82
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,041
Come, he's expecting you.

83
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,000
We hear you can heal people.

84
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,166
Viktor.

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,958
You once told me, all systems have limits.

86
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,583
He is worth the risk.

87
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:22,416
Vander's psyche is
deeply entangled with that of the beast.

88
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,500
How did you know his name?

89
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,665
He told me.

90
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,957
Ask for a miracle healer,

91
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,125
get a metal fortune cookie.

92
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,041
I saw your father.

93
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:39,249
His dream of your family
and vision of Zaun as it could have been,

94
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,166
it was...

95
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,083
beautiful.

96
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,875
Cookie.

97
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,208
Can you help him?

98
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,207
I will do all in my power.

99
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,957
Hmm. Hmm?

100
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:54,207
However, I have one condition.

101
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,375
Looks like you got a couple.

102
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,999
You have much
to offer this commune, Powder.

103
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:09,125
Your talents can be used to build,
instead of destroy.

104
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,208
I'll stick with what I know, thanks.

105
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,832
My condition is that
he must be restrained at night.

106
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:21,666
I've seen the harm of which he is capable.

107
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,791
What do you think?

108
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,791
You actually want my opinion?

109
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,916
I hate fortune cookies.

110
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,916

I remember Mom's smell the most.

138
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,665
- Axle grease.
- Axle grease.

139
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,250
This place.

140
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,166
Do you think it could actually work?

141
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,875
Underground utopia,
run by a skinny tin Machine Herald.

142
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,833
Maybe when Piltover slides into the sump.

143
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,750
What if we stayed?

144
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,541
Helped them out?

145
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,583
"We"?

146
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,708
Forward!

147
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,166
Halt.

148
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:38,375
No weapons.

149
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,916
I'm afraid the Herald insists.

150
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,541
If I may.

151
00:14:59,333 --> 00:15:03,040
I believe this Herald may be
a former pupil of mine.

152
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,957
A man of science.

153
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,375
Let me speak with him.

154
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,000
Hmm.

155
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,749
Ready our forces for tonight.

156
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:22,375
I should like to meet this Herald.

157
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:53,666
You've felt it, haven't you?

158
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,541
Your decline?

159
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,249
Your power is finite,

160
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,291
diminished by every use.

161
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:06,041
I've been expecting you, doctor.

162
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:08,624
Viktor.

163
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,083
Incredible.

164
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:14,165
What I wouldn't give
to glimpse the world through your eyes.

165
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:15,958
To know what you know.

166
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:21,624
His quest led him astray
of any trodden path.

167
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,499
His own shadow dissolved to darkness.

168
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Now the only course was forward.

169
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,916
The only warmth, a dream of her waltz.

170
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,749
Knowledge is a paradox.

171
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,415
The more one understands,

172
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:42,416
the more one realizes
the vastness of his ignorance.

173
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,208
Marvelous specimen, isn't he?

174
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:53,166
The regenerative qualities
of his blood will stabilize you.

175
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:56,915
Apex Shimmer combined with you,

176
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,541
the apex form of Hextech.

177
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,000
What you are suggesting would destroy him.

178
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:04,875
And for what?

179
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,458
Conquest?

180
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,166
The greed of warmongers?

181
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:12,915
To complete your work.

182
00:17:12,916 --> 00:17:15,458
To save us from ourselves.

183
00:17:17,041 --> 00:17:19,375
You must survive, Viktor.

184
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,249
Do you believe in fate, doctor?

185
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,332
Our paths carved before us.

186
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,916
Guided by an invisible hand?

187
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:34,707
Not fate, evolution.

188
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:38,833
Nature's greatest force, forever in flux.

189
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,250
No.

190
00:17:40,916 --> 00:17:43,624
Evolution has a destination.

191
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,916
Not to combat nature,

192
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
but to supersede it.

193
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,416
The final, glorious evolution.

194
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,250
But he isn't a specimen.

195
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,208
He's a man.

196
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,833
And he needs my help.

197
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,875
I will not sacrifice his humanity
for your cause.

198
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,458
You may leave.

199
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:12,708
Very well.

200
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,082
But I assume you understand already,

201
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:20,166
if you perish,
this community is soon to follow.

202
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,541
On the job, I see.

203
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,500
You can't be here.

204
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,540
Oh. Here, like where I landed

205
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:31,790
when this rich, unhinged mongoose
just tackled me?

206
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:33,333
Mongoose?

207
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,083
Your hair.

208
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:40,124
You look like an angry oil slick.

209
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,083
Don't sugarcoat it, cupcake.

210
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:50,125
The routes in and out
of this canyon are being monitored.

211
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,333
No one can come in or out
without being questioned.

212
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,000
Who's out there?

213
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,165
We tracked some sort
of new chemweapon down here.

214
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,333
A bloodthirsty murderous beast.

215
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,375
What are you doing here?

216
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,666
Trying to save... my dad.

217
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,874
Viktor believes he can save
the man inside the beast.

218
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:27,540
If he succeeds, I'm afraid the creature's
usefulness will be lost to us.

219
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,875
Then we'll have to force his hand.

220
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:35,915
I believe I can craft a serum
that will prohibit Viktor's success.

221
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,875
Make sure it's secured.

222
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:41,958
Yes?

223
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,541
It's Vi.

224
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:15,666
So much for happy reunions.

225
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:18,166
Well done, Caitlyn.

226
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:47,750
It's time.

227
00:22:03,916 --> 00:22:05,999
We have scouts up now, sir.

228
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,333
Six, collectively.

229
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:27,000
Slippery as an eel.

230
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:37,916
I knew you could get it.

231
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,916
Had some time to think lately.

232
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:53,041
Ever since you dropped into my life,
it's like I put on glasses.

233
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:58,333
Except I can't tell
whether everything's blurry or clear.

234
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,624
Wanna hear a dumb joke?

235
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,457
A sentimental ex-con, a giant furball,

236
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:13,416
and two of Piltover's most wanted
walk into a weird cult.

237
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:18,416
And here comes the punch line.

238
00:23:21,625 --> 00:23:22,666
Vi.

239
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,999
You've been quite a curiosity.

240
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,665
One who captured Caitlyn's heart.

241
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:30,666
I owe you thanks.

242
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,833
Your absence provided a vacuum
I was able to fill.

243
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:41,165
In other circumstances, I might have
offered you a position in my organization.

244
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:42,916
Your resilience is undeniable.

245
00:23:46,416 --> 00:23:48,250
Of course, that won't be possible.

246
00:23:48,791 --> 00:23:51,708
You cause too many complications.

247
00:23:52,291 --> 00:23:55,166
Caitlyn must not be distracted.

248
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:58,791
Don't worry, she's not distracted.

249
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,458
You know, my father taught me about trust.

250
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:07,166
He told me if I wanted it,
there were three things I needed to do:

251
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:11,165
Be honest, even if it means
telling a self-righteous windbag

252
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:13,041
that her breath smells like a cesspool.

253
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:14,958
Be patient.

254
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,250
Mm, still haven't cracked that one,
but being tied up sure helps.

255
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,250
And the third?

256
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:25,540
Just shut the fuck up.

257
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,832
The fissures are blocked by guard towers.

258
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:45,415
Patrols circle the commune
at even intervals.

259
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:49,707
Her personal guard are posted
here, here and here.

260
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,874
They aren't expecting trouble at home.

261
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:54,165
With flawless timing and luck and...

262
00:24:54,166 --> 00:24:56,291
A big distraction.

263
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:07,457
<i>Whatever you do,</i>

264
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,041
<i>don't underestimate Ambessa.</i>

265
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:21,874
<i>Vander's in trouble.</i>

266
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,125
<i>I have a plan.</i>

267
00:25:23,666 --> 00:25:25,249
<i>You're not gonna like it.</i>

268
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:42,416
Hope I was worth your time.

269
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,124
<i>I won't...</i>

270
00:25:57,125 --> 00:25:58,332
<i>I won't fail.</i>

271
00:27:39,208 --> 00:27:40,291
Vi sent me.

272
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:43,291
I'm going to get you out of here.

273
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:53,541
Ambessa believed in you.

274
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:58,791
Your death will be a deep cut.

275
00:28:56,333 --> 00:29:00,833
Don't touch my daughter.

276
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,250
You.

277
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:05,750
<i>I won't fail.</i>

278
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:08,541
<i>I swear it.</i>

279
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,041
Vander.

280
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:04,500
<i>I understand now.</i>

281
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,749
<i>The message hidden within the pattern.</i>

282
00:33:09,083 --> 00:33:12,166
<i>The reason for our failures
in the commune.</i>

283
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,208
<i>The doctor was right.</i>

284
00:33:15,541 --> 00:33:16,875
<i>It's inescapable.</i>

285
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,541
<i>Humanity.</i>

286
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,375
<i>Our very essence.</i>

287
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:26,041
<i>Our emotions...</i>

288
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,625
<i>Rage.</i>

289
00:33:29,791 --> 00:33:31,208
<i>Compassion.</i>

290
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,083
<i>Hate.</i>

291
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:37,625
<i>Two sides of the same coin.</i>

292
00:33:38,166 --> 00:33:40,916
<i>Inextricably bound.</i>

293
00:33:51,875 --> 00:33:53,208
Vander, wait.

294
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,457
Pew!

295
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,875
Boo!

296
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
No!

297
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:42,875
Pew!

298
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,500
Isha!

299
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:08,166
<i>That which inspires us
to our greatest good...</i>

300
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:15,083
<i>is also the cause of our greatest evil.</i>
