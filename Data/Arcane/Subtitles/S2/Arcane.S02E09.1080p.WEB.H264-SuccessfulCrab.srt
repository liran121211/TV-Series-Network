I just wanna talk to you.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,457

00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,250
- You're too late, Ekko.
- Wait!

23
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,583
Always a dance with you.

24
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,208

You know, catch my breath.

26
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,666
See if I can talk an old friend
out of blowing us up.

27
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,666
- I'm tired of talking.
- No!

00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,958

very special...

31
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,375
that no matter what happened in the past,

32
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,125
it's never too late
to build something new.

33
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:00,374

I need you and the Enforcers
to buy me as much time as you can

52
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,416
so I can shut down the Hexgates.

53
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,750
It's our only chance.

54
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:05,958
Viktor's at the center
of all this, isn't he?

55
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,166
We're meant to lose this fight.

56
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,416
If he reaches the Hexgates...

57
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,791
Then we'd best stop him.

58
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,958
Move, move!

59
00:06:17,208 --> 00:06:20,582
Reinforce the forward artillery.
We can't let them break through.

60
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,791
- Go.
- Let's go.

61
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,583
- Hold it.
- Go.

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,875
Reload.

63
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,833
- Give her some air.
- You're okay.

64
00:06:58,416 --> 00:07:00,125
Down!

65
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,583
- Back!
- Come on.

66
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,333
Let's go.

67
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,750
Around the gate!

68
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,166
Bold, little one.

69
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:52,000
- Move your units and wait there.
- Stay.

70
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:38,125
Come on!

71
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,333
Let's go, let's go.

72
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:45,666
I warned you of the hazards
of professional entanglement.

73
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:04,540
Desperation is the doorway
to oblivion, child.

74
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,208
Let's get this over with.

75
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,625
I did appreciate your warmth.

76
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:55,207
If you care for me at all,
spare their lives.

77
00:14:55,208 --> 00:14:59,291
There is nothing to gain
from this senseless bloodshed.

78
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,875
Still a fox.

79
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,250
Soldier.

80
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,540
Get in line.

86
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,041
Fire!

87
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:10,125
Let's run.

88
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,166
Hmm.

89
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:56,833
Where is Viktor?

90
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:29,000
Despite the circumstances, Jayce...

91
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:35,000
I am... pleased to see you.

92
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,000
There must be some part
of you still in there.

93
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,875
I am more than I ever was.

94
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:54,500
What other choice do we have?

95
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:34,125
Mother, look at the price
of your ambition.

96
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,374
You've sacrificed everything.

97
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:38,416
Rictus.

98
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:40,000
Kino.

99
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,958
This city I built for our family.

100
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,583
If it was for us,
you wouldn't have fought me.

101
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,958
You are no Medarda.

102
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,000
You remember your--

103
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,625
Shut up and fight.

104
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:46,750
Vi!

105
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,250
Vi!

106
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,625
Vi!

107
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:16,208
It is the answer
you and I pursued all our lives.

108
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:21,374
An end to cruelty, injustice.

109
00:22:21,375 --> 00:22:23,457
All of us our own authors

110
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:26,875
to an unbroken saga of progress.

111
00:22:27,583 --> 00:22:30,458
To the benefit of all.

112
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:33,874
People deserve to choose their own fates.

113
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,790
Choice is false.

114
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:39,707
It is how we clothe and forgive

115
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:44,124
the baser instincts
that spur us to division.

116
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,582
Death, war, prejudice.

117
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,915
Energy spent only to consume itself.

118
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:57,000
But we can be of one mind.

119
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,791
United.

120
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,333
You fought well, child.

121
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,625
Now!

122
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,416
A wolf has no mercy.

123
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:30,000
Your daughter is wiser
than you credit.

124
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,375
I salute you, Ambessa.

125
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:35,791
For one without the gift,

126
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:37,875
you were quite a thorn.

127
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:53,875
What are you doing, sister?

128
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:13,624
I see your face, deceiver.

129
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,875
Sly girl.

130
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:48,458
You are the wolf.

131
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,833
Looks like you shouldn't have come back.

132
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,374
Still don't get it, huh, sis?

133
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:00,166
I'm always with you.

134
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,750
Even when we're worlds apart.

135
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:11,374
Stop this insanity, Viktor.

136
00:27:11,375 --> 00:27:14,458
That is precisely my intention.

137
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:23,750
Your eyes won't lie...

138
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,541
when your mind...

139
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33,791
is open, Jayce.

140
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:53,750
Vander.

141
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,416
Dad?

142
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:53,916
Do you see?

143
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:59,916
The sublime intersection
of order and chaos.

144
00:31:36,166 --> 00:31:38,875
This is what you see?

145
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,958
This conflict.

146
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:53,208
This senseless waste.

147
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,541
I know their minds, Jayce.

148
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:03,207
They want better lives,

149
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,083
but emotion clashes with reason.

150
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:11,000
Humanity's self-corrupting contradiction.

151
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:15,791
You've always wanted to cure
what you thought were weaknesses.

152
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,166
Your leg.

153
00:32:19,291 --> 00:32:20,416
Your disease.

154
00:32:21,541 --> 00:32:23,541
But you were never broken, Viktor.

155
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:26,916
There is beauty in imperfections.

156
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,166
They made you who you are.

157
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,666
An inseparable piece of everything...

158
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,250
I admired about you.

159
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:29,875
That device can't be.

160
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,833
I thought I wanted us
to give magic to the world.

161
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:07,791
Now...

162
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:09,875
all I want...

163
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,375
is my partner back.

164
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,416
Why do you persist?

165
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:22,958
After everything I've done?

166
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,625
Because I promised you.

167
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,833
Why did you ever give me this?

168
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:36,957
Why?

169
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:55,333
I thought I could bring an end
to the world's suffering.

170
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,833
But when every equation was solved...

171
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,500
<i>all that remained...</i>

172
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:08,916
were fields of dreamless solitude.

173
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,375
There is no prize to perfection.

174
00:36:14,458 --> 00:36:16,583
Only an end to pursuit.

175
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:19,541
<i>In all timelines,</i>

176
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,625
<i>in all possibilities...</i>

177
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:31,041
<i>only you...</i>

178
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,625
can show me this.

179
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:13,583
You must go, Jayce.

180
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:33,916
We finish this together.

181
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,833
Vi!

182
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:55,416
Vi, hurry, you can make the other ledge.

183
00:39:58,833 --> 00:39:59,999
Vi!

184
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,208
What are you...?

185
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,333
Vi.

186
00:40:15,125 --> 00:40:16,416
Vi?

187
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,708
You can't save him.

188
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:34,541
Vi!

189
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,000

203
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:31,666

204
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:33,625
<i>For its truth...</i>

205
00:43:35,916 --> 00:43:38,291
<i>the agony of every sacrifice...</i>

206
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:48,125
<i>the exaltation of every triumph...</i>

207
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,625

208
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:02,666

<i>Our only consolation that with every loss,</i>

212
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:19,916
<i>we found some good,</i>

213
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:21,750
<i>some light,</i>

214
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:23,833
<i>worth gaining,</i>

215
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:26,416
<i>worth fighting for.</i>

216
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:40,833
<i>And though we are doomed

217
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,875

218
00:45:09,583 --> 00:45:11,916

219
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:00,833
Is that...

220
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:02,916
singing?

221
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,583
It's just a tune my mother used to hum.

222
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,875
Are you still in this fight, Violet?

223
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:27,708
I am the dirt under your nails, cupcake.

224
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,166
Nothing's gonna clean me out.
