In fighting topside,
you'd sacrifice everything that we are.

It's not the way. Can't you see that?

188
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:33,791
Kill me if you have to,
but please spare the Lanes.

189
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,416
You'd die for the cause,
but you won't fight for one?

That's quite the conviction.

Please. We can prove that it works.

206
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,458
Hmm. You couldn't do so earlier today,
how is tonight any different?

No, he's my new partner.

Even if you manage to prove your theory,
the Council would destroy it.

And no matter what happens here,
it's going to change our world.
