our family's interests and grow yourself.

179
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,791
Which you have.

180
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,333
You said, "Perhaps, your sentimentality
will be more at home

181
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,166
with those soft-spined
idealists overseas."

182
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,833
You have your father's memory.

183
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,083
Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me.

184
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,416
-Mel.
-Or that.

185
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,583
[seagulls caw]

186
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,750
Your brother's gone.

187
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,958
[gasps]

188
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,375
What happened?

189
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,958
[sighs]
He crossed the wrong man.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,083
I was distracted.

191
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,500
That's a mistake I can't take back.

192
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,291
[heavy breathing]

193
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,916
Your Jayce Talis has turned his eye
to Hextech weaponry.

194
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,666
[scoffs]
I knew it.

195
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,291
War is coming.

196
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,375
You've let the problems
of your undercity fester too long.

197
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,000
Piltover isn't like Noxus.

198
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,000
War isn't our first and every recourse.

199
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,416
I sponsored Hextech to protect the city,
not burn it to the ground.

200
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,208
It's not conjecture, it's a fact.

201
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,083
Weapons can't be unmade
and they are always used.

202
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,958
I'm here to help guide you
to the right decisions.

203
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,625
-I don't need your guidance.
-We'll see.

204
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,666
Miss Medarda?

205
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,708
-Yes?
-Yes?

206
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,791
He's for me, dear.

207
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,375
I'm off to sample the local cuisine.

208
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:27,958
[seagulls caw]

209
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,208
[door opens]

210
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,791
We'll present our case
to the Council tonight.

211
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,833
You did all this yourself?

212
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,208
Without even going down there?

213
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,708
[Vi sighs]

214
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,958
And I thought Powder could get obsessed.
[scoffs]

215
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,958
What happened to her, it's not your fault.

216
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,875
When my parents were still alive…

217
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,666
me and Powder
used to share a bed like this.

218
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,166
Except, maybe, half the size.

219
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:15,208
We played a game where we pretended
to be bigger and bigger monsters.

220
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:21,125
So she would say, "I'm a slug monster
with venom for ooze."

221
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:26,833
And I'd say, "Well, I'm a slug-eating crab
with razor spikes."

222
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:33,750
Sometimes, I… I'd get carried away
and she'd get scared.

223
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,416
I didn't want her to start crying
and wake my parents up, so…

224
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,333
I pretended to chase my own monsters away.

225
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:44,833
I'd say…

226
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
"No monster's gonna get you
when I'm here."

227
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,958
Then a real monster showed up.

228
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,333
And I just ran away.

229
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,750
I left her.

230
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:03,583
[dramatic music]

231
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,666
[gasps, coughs]

237
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:26,875
[Powder laughs]

238
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,500
You know, Powder,
you're stronger than you think.

239
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,083
Vi?

240
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,791
[Vi] <i>I'm so sorry, Powder.</i>

241
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,291
-<i>Your sister is jinx.</i>
-No!

242
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,125
[Vi] <i>Jinx.</i>

243
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,041
No, no. No!

244
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,291
[sobs]

245
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,250
I understand this must be painful.

246
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,166
No!
[whimpers]

247
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,416
-I'm afraid it will only get worse.
-Wait!

248
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,833
No!
[screaming]

249
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:02,208

[Silco grumbles]

253
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,041
What have you done?

254
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,791
I saved her life.

255
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,541
[groans]

256
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,083

[man 1] Hey, watch it, furball.

260
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,416
[man 2] Move.

00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,666

Oh.

269
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,541
Hmm.

270
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,041
-Hmm.

Huh?

Hmm…

274
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,208
Like this.

275
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:41,666
[gasps]

276
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,625

00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,208
[girl] Bye…

[electricity crackles]

282
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,500
Oh, ingenious.

283
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,250
Though these blades
seem improperly pitched.

284
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,250
[Ekko] You're wrong.

285
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,750
It's designed for the fissures.

286
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,833
The air is denser.

287
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,750
[Heimerdinger] Oh.

288
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,125
-[grunts]
-Are you all right, lad?

289
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,583
Yeah, I'm fine, I just sprained my ankle.

290
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,291
Are you Councilor Heimerdinger?

291
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,875
It's just Heimerdinger now.

292
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,208
What are you doing
on this side of the river?

293
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,166
I wanted to offer my assistance

294
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,458
to the citizens of the undercity, but…

295
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,958
it seems I'm unwelcome.

296
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,166
[chuckles]

297
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,083
-What is it?
-We're having the exact same day.

298
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,291
[scoffs]

299
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:55,291
That looks like more than a sprain.
You need medical attention.

300
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,583
I have to get home.
It isn't safe for me here.

301
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,500
[grunts]

302
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,208
I don't know how I'm gonna get there
with my leg busted, and, well…

303
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,083
you're holding my ride.

304
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,416
[water sloshes]

305
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,333
[relaxing music]

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,833
[slurps]

307
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,458
Do they teach military history
at your Academy, Mr. Talis?

308
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,500
It's, um, Councilor Talis.

309
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,791
And I'm not sure.

310
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,333
[Mrs. Medarda] The Alornian General
Sonnem Parlec

311
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,333
used to find ways
to meet his enemies blindfolded.

312
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,666
He said a man's mind
hides behind his body.

313
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,666
Somehow, I doubt he ever tried this.

314
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,541
You're Mel's mom.

315
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,625
Among other things.

316
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,375
[Mrs. Medarda] Squeeze, child.
You won't break it.

317
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,666
I do have other matters,
so if you'll excuse me…

318
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,916
[Mrs. Medarda] The threat
of the undercity is real.

319
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,250
-Your leadership is impotent.
-[scoffs]

320
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,583
We may not be Noxus, but Piltover
isn't as helpless as you think.

321
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,500
[Mrs. Medarda]
Who said anything about Piltover?

322
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,666
The Council is the problem.
The mind hiding behind the body.

323
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,000
Navigating your current crisis
requires expertise you lack.

324
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,083
Do you know what the success rate
for senior Academy inventors is?

325
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,250
[Jayce] Three percent.

326
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,708
We're no strangers to failure.

327
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,416
What makes this the City of Progress is
that we keep trying until we get it right.

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,875
So thank you for your advice,
Mrs. Medarda, but I have a city to run.

329
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,208
Wait.

330
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,458
[water sloshes]

331
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,750
[gasps, clears throat]

332
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,291
[Mrs. Medarda] I see why this province
and my daughter have fallen for you.

333
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,833
You have the passion of youth.

334
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,000
I have experience.

335
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,958
I want you to succeed here, Jayce,
to grace the world with Hextech.

336
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,833
But if you don't accept certain realities,
I fear you'll end up like General Parlec.

337
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,750
Slaughtered with your eyes closed.

338
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,291
[suspenseful music]

339
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,458
[Councilor 1]
Three of my suppliers have said

340
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,958
they intend to delay shipments until fall

341
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,208
to give things "time to cool off."

342
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,708
[Mrs. Kiramman] We have greater concerns
than a dip in profits.

343
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,666
The Sheriff betrayed us.
We need better information.

344
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,250
We need to act.
Before anyone else gets killed.

345
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,375
Perhaps Marcus
was operating independently.

346
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,791
What could anyone in the undercity
offer him that he didn't have up here?

347
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,500
It's not what they offered him,

348
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,875
it's what he had to lose.

349
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,166
Councilors, my daughter
has a unique insight into our situation.

350
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,666
Thank you.

351
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,791
Councilors, this is Vi.
She was born in the undercity.

352
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,291
Even though we failed her
in countless ways,

353
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,291
she risked everything to show me
what life is really like down there.

354
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,625
People are starving, sick,
ravaged by Shimmer.

355
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,916
[Caitlyn] They live in constant fear

356
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,750
of the coordinated efforts
of violent crime lords.

357
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,041
One man leads these efforts.

358
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,208
Silco.

359
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,458
We've done investigations of Silco.

360
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,166
They yielded no such level
of organization.

361
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,291
And who led these investigations?

362
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,791
What does this Silco even want from us?

363
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,625
He believes the undercity
should be independent.

364
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,791
He calls it the Nation of Zaun.

365
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,291
[suspenseful music]

366
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,708
What about these?
Do you know who made them?

367
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,416
No, well…

368
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,166
-[Caitlyn] Uh…
-Her name is Jinx.

369
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,291
[Jayce] This Jinx has the Gemstone?

370
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,333
-Then we have to go in by force.
-That could trigger war.

371
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,708
-There are good people down there.
-[Councilor 1] Hmph. Bad ones too.

372
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,750
[Councilor 2] Even if we wanted to invade,
they have Shimmer.

373
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,750
We have Hextech.

374
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,625
What happened to you?

375
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,375
We've been talking about talking
for weeks now.

376
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,666
They're still cleaning the blood
off the bridge.

377
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,750
-When do we say enough is enough?
-Jayce, you don't know war.

378
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,208
I do.

379
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:52,083
It must be our last resort.
There may be a diplomatic solution.

380
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,791
She's right.

381
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,458
[grunts]

382
00:23:00,708 --> 00:23:02,125
[sighs]

383
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,625
What? You want to negotiate with him?

384
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,666
[Mrs. Kiramman] It may be the only way
to avoid further bloodshed.

385
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,958
[Vi] This is insane.
Did you learn nothing?

386
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,000
You can't talk to him!

387
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,208
He hates you. Everything you stand for.

388
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,833
He will never back down.

389
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,500
-Enforcers, please escort them out.
-Forget it.

390
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,916
[Vi] I remember
where your fancy damn door is.

391
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,750
[sighs]

392
00:23:33,458 --> 00:23:34,833

[rain pattering]

394
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,875
[Caitlyn] Vi! Wait!

395
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,875
Wait! Where are you going?

396
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,041
I don't know. Back where I came from?

397
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,416
Seems like that's
what everyone up here wants.

398
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,625
-I can fix this.
-You can't!

399
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,416
[Vi] This is how things are.
How they've always been.

400
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,000
I was so stupid to think it could change.

401
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,958
[Caitlyn] There must be something else
we can do. Some other way.

402
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,291
We'll make a new plan. We have to try.

403
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,541
We tried. Okay? It wasn't enough.

404
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,833
Topside and bottom. Oil and water.
That's all there is.

405
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,833
What about us?

406
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,458
Oil and water.

407
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,208
Wasn't meant to be.

408
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,958
[sighs]

409
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,208
-You're just saying that.
-[Vi] Do yourself a favor, Cupcake.

410
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,750
Go back to that big,
shiny house of yours and just…

411
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,500
forget me, okay?

412
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:34,125

00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,708
[Sky] Viktor, I've been working
on a private project

425
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,125
for a couple weeks now.

426
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,833

No.

[dramatic music]

434
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:17,833
Viktor, I was hoping you might take a look
at something I've been working on.

[Viktor grunts]

436
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,250
[Sky] Viktor…

437
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,791
I was inspired by your…
[sighs]

438
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,208
Everything you do inspires me.

You want to make Silco pay
for what he's done?

465
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,000
I could have you arrested.

466
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,750
You guys really like
to bandy that threat around.

467
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,333
You ever been to Stillwater?

468
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,041
-[Jayce] No.
-[Vi scoffs]

469
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,375
So you just wave an arm,
have someone dragged off,

470
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,750
don't bother to find out
what it does to someone

471
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:39,166
being stuffed in a stone box
for weeks, or months, or even years?

473
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:45,458
-Yeah. I want to make Silco pay.
-[Vi] I want in.

474
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,166
There is no in.

475
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,916
-You heard the Council.
-Fuck the Council.

476
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,625
You said you were tired of doing nothing.

477
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,916
[Vi] That's the only sensible thing
that came out of anyone's mouth tonight.

478
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,791
I'm not a vigilante.

479
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,333
No, you're a victim.

-Hmm.

485
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,791
Someone close to me had a pair of these.

486
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:26,250
[Vi] You're the first person Caitlyn
looked for when we made it to topside.

487
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,208
Of everyone up here,

488
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,500
you're the one she trusted
to do something.

490
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,500
What do you want me to do? Arrest him?

491
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,375
[Vi] Silco controls
the undercity with Shimmer.

492
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,916
Shut down his supply,

493
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,125
and it's only a matter of time
before his own people turn on him.

494
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,375
[Jayce] And how do we do that?

495
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,500
[Vi] Take out
his manufacturing facilities.

496
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,000
Hit them hard and fast,
before he can react.
