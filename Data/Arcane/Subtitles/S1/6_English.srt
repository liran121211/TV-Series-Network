Ten outta ten, toots!

184
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:22,708
I think I know
just how to deliver that message.

193
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,416
Ah, about time Daddy joined us.

194
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,666
You were so busy,
little Ren here saw me in.

198
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,416
Let's talk outside.

199
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,041
Can't you see we're playing?

200
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,375
You remember our old friend Vi, don't you?

201
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,916
Vander's daughter. She was about your age.

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Her father went on a long trip and Daddy
here assured me that she left with him.

203
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,291
[gulps]

204
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,250
But it seems she never made it.
Isn't that sad?

205
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,541
Could you imagine being separated
from your father?

206
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:43,916
[gasps]

207
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,208
She's… in a safe place.

208
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,083
She's in the Lanes.

209
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,375
That's not possible.

210
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:57,250
There's an enforcer with her. A girl.
Roughly the same age.

211
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,833
Caitlyn. She's a Kiramman. Just like them,
she does whatever she wants.

212
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,875
I… can't control her.

213
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,541
Then of what use are you?

214
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:10,875
I'll track her down.

215
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,208
I can fix this.

216
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,625
Please.

217
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,125
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

218
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,666
What's important
is that we don't repeat them.

219
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,500
-My people are tracking Vi and this…
-[scoffs]

220
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,708
…Caitlyn.
They cannot be allowed to resurface.

221
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,208
[Silco] Do we understand each other?

222
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,333
Hmm.

[Jayce] Incredible.

234
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,000
This is unlike anything
we've ever seen, Jayce.

235
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:33,666
It, it, it could be the key to augmenting
physiology, extending life…

236

-Curing you.

It's happened to everyone.

239
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,625
I can't determine why.

240
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,458
They're… rejecting the transmutation.

-There may not be time.

We're in uncharted waters here and…

245
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,541
I can feel my body… eroding.

246
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,416
I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger.
He might know something that could help.

247
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,666
In the meantime, we'll do what we do best.

I know you have your reservations
about me,

267

but this only works
if we can trust each other.

268
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,125
It doesn't work. It never has.

269

You topsiders always find a way
to screw us.

We aren't monsters, you know.
We're people, just like you.

Despite it all, I can tell…

I'm calling it the Hexcore.

282
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:26,958
It's an adaptive rune matrix.

is that it reacts to biological matter.

You must destroy it.

What?

291
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,458
Please, if ever you've put faith
in my guidance, hear me now.

292
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,958
I've seen nations destroyed
by a single seed and it looked…

293
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,958
exactly like this.

294
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,333
Professor, this could save Viktor's life.

295
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:07,583
Viktor, something's different.
You've changed. What did you do?

296
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,625
[stammers]
What do you mean, Professor?

297
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:15,000
It's that thing. It must be destroyed!

298
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,000
-Wait.
-No. I won't let you.

-[barks]
-Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos.

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,333
I will have it destroyed
one way or another.

00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,333
That's your opinion.
We'll see if the Council agrees.

You do what you have to.
I need to get ready.

Or at least I was. I mean,
I… I owed her old man my life.

00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,458
Probably more than that.

317
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,125

…with this.

Shimmer. Why would you take something
that does that to you?

336
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,875
I just… wanted to feel what it was like…

337
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,958
To be somebody.
To make other people afraid.

338

No, no. You go ahead.

Anyway, I don't want her
to see me like this.

About everything.

I found this on one of the Firelights.

356
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:40,791
It matches fragments we found
outside your lab and at the Hexgates.

357
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:46,500
I… have reason to believe
they're planning more attacks.

358
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,375
Well, how has this threat
gone unnoticed for so long?

359
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:53,250
Since the Hexgates were completed,
the fissures haven't been a priority.

360
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,791
Oh, we'll settle that later. For now,
we need to prevent any further attacks.

361
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,375
Short of searching everyone
who crosses the bridges.

362
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,125
I don't know how we can.

363
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,625
Then, that's what we'll do.

364
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:09,416
-Are you certain? This sort of an order--
-Do it. We have to protect the city.

365
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,166
One other thing.

366
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,416
I saw Caitlyn Kiramman had a prisoner
released on your order.

367
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,041
Is there anything I can assist with?

368
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,458
[Jayce] No. No, uh, we've got it covered.

369
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,416
[Heimerdinger]
Councilors, we have lost our way.

370
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,375
This city was founded
to be a bastion of enlightenment.

371
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:43,916
In a world that cannibalized itself
over power and pride.

372
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,916
But we've forgotten.

373
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,125
Loosened our morals in favor
of comfort and convenience.

374
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,541
Traded honor for prestige.

375
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,708
We were once one tribe.

376
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,958
Now we are Houses divided.

377
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:04,958
I believe, if we set aside our greed
and arrogance, we can be one again.

378
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:09,041
It will take vigilance.
We must hold each other accountable.

379
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,666
And who holds you accountable?

380
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,541
[Heimerdinger] What?

381
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,708
[Jayce]
Shimmer is rampant in the undercity.

382
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,791
Attacks at the Hexgates
and in the Academy Square.

383
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:22,416
Enforcers fear to set foot in the Lanes.
All under your watch.

384
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,291
Jayce, you forget yourself.

385
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,375
I'm sorry, Professor,

386
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,666
but healing this city
will take more than just speeches.

387
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,375
Time and again,
you've warned us what not to do.

388
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:37,041
But let me ask you this,
what's your plan to fix this?

389
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,125
I see what this is about.

390
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,666
Your Hextech projects need more time.
More safeguards.

391
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,625
Humans don't live for centuries.
We can't wait for progress.

392
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:52,708
We need a leadership
focused on the future, not the past.

393
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,041
You are the true Father of Piltover,

394
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,000
and your years of service
can never be repaid.

395
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,583
I believe it's time we gave
the beloved founder of our city…

396
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,166
a well-deserved retirement.

397
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,833
Jayce, don't do this.

398
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,083
Hmm.

399
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,541

401
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,791
[Jayce] It has to be unanimous.
All in favor?

00:25:24,208 --> 00:25:25,375
[sighs]

403
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:31,125

Right. Jinx. How could I forget?

423
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,291
We're going to have
to be more careful now.

My sister. I thought she died, but, no.

430
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,083
I have to try and find her.

431
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,291
How do you not know
if your sister is alive or dead?

432
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,083
It's hard to check up on people
from inside a concrete cell.

433
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,875
What, you don't have parents?

434
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,958
No! They were killed by enforcers.

You don't know your limits, girl.
It's what got Vander killed.

460
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:47,750
What drove your sister away.
And it's why I'm here right now.
