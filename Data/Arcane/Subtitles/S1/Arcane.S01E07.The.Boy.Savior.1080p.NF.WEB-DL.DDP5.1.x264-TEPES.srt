1
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,541
I knew it was a mistake trusting you.

2
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:12,625
You've been a real picnic yourself.

3
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:16,833
I'm not the one who walked us
into, not one, but two of Silco's traps.

4
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:19,291
This isn't Silco, it's someone else.

5
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:20,666
How do you know?

6
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,083
'Cause we'd already be dead.

7
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:23,333
Oh, very nice.

8
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:26,267
When were you planning to tell me
that your lunatic sister works for him?

9
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,684
Just as soon as you came clean about

10
00:01:27,708 --> 00:01:29,017
what the hell
you're really doing down here.

11
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,934
- I told you the truth.
- Bullshit.

12
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,250
What was that glowing stone?

13
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,458
That's what I thought.

14
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:40,166
What's going on?

15
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,976
- Hey, stop! Get your hands off of me!
- Leave her alone!

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,416
- Let me go!
- Vi?

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,583
Vi!

18
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,666
Vi!

19
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,166
Hey.

20
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,541
You shy? Or just ugly?

21
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:38,875
You look good for a dead girl.

Ekko?

39
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,458
What do you know about this?

40
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:59,541
Nothing. What the hell is this all about?

41
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,208
What were you doing with Jinx?

42
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,541
Her name is Powder.

43
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:06,291
And I just found her
when you and your goons showed up.

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's me. Vi.

45
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,208
Same person who used to take you down
to the junk heap

46
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,375
and hose you down
when you got covered in grease.

47
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,666
That was a long time ago.

48
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,708
People change.

49
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,708
Yeah. I'm getting that.

50
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,750
Are you working for Silco?

51
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,583
Fuck. You.

52
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,208
I thought you were dead.

53
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:31,041
Now you show up with a Piltie
and give her a tour of the Lanes?

54
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,916
You were following us?
Why didn't you say something?

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,416
I didn't know if I could trust you.

56
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,541
So... so you just come out swinging?

57
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,916
Gee, I wonder who I learned that from?

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,125
Ah, well, you shoulda learned more.
You still punch like a little boy.

59
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:46,250
And you still block with your face.

60
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,291
I remember when
you wouldn't stand up to me.

61
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,375
I missed you, little man.

62
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,583
How long have you had those off?

63
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,791
How long have you been whining?

64
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,250
Hmm. Fascinating.

65
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,916
I would very much like to see the device.

66
00:05:18,416 --> 00:05:20,458
This, uh, Hexcore.

67
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,458
That may be difficult to arrange.

68
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:30,958
I've tried every combination of runes,
but... it's always the same.

69
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,166
The subject, wither and rot.

70
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,208
Uh, perhaps the error resides
not with your calculations but...

71
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:41,541
with your subjects.

72
00:05:41,625 --> 00:05:44,083
Nature has made us intolerant to change,

73
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:49,250
but fortunately,
we have the capacity to change our nature.

74
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:52,708
- And this is... Shimmer?
- A variant.

75
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:57,375
It should provide everything one needs
to survive a violent transition.

76
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,458
Will it work on plants?

77
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,291
You aren't here about the plants, are you?

78
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,625
I know the look of a doomed man.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,291
I must warn you.

80
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,250
If you take this path,
they will despise you.

81
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:18,000
Love and legacy are
the sacrifices we make for progress.

82
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:21,708
It's why I parted ways with Heimerdinger.

83
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,166
- Jayce will understand.
- Perhaps.

84
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,166
Hammer work is such a delicate art.

85
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,458
How'd you find me?

86
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:11,125
You're the de facto head of the Council.
People notice where you go.

87
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:13,083
Huh. Don't remind me.

88
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,750
This border shutdown
has people agitated.

89
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,083
They should be.

90
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:22,541
Marcus brought this to me.
It's an explosive.

91
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,583
I tried taking it apart
and it nearly killed me.

92
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,626
Whoever built it
knows exactly what they're doing.

93
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:31,125
This and Shimmer. It's hard to believe
what they're capable of.

94
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,666
Is that what's really bothering you?

95
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:43,625
He was my mentor, Mel. And I betrayed him.

96
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,500
Everything you said about him was true.

97
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,750
My family cast me out
and yet, part of me still loves them.

98
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:56,208
Heimerdinger will understand eventually.

99
00:07:57,083 --> 00:08:00,416
It's your time now, Jayce.
No more red tape.

100
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,250
You can bring Hextech to the masses,
just like you've always dreamed.

101
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:09,625
Hmm. First, I have to save Viktor.

102
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,708
Where is he?

103
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,500
I don't know.

104
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,458
He disappeared.
He does that sometimes.

105
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,541
- No sign of Caitlyn either.
- The Kiramman girl?

106
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,958
It's just...

107
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,875
- Uh, never mind.
- Hey. We'll get through this.

108
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:28,333
I'll stall the Council
but they'll soon need their leader.

109
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,083
In the meantime...

110
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,083
Try not to lose your nuts.

111
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:50,833
All our business is down. Enforcers are
searching anyone who crosses the bridge.

112
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:55,833
Marcus is following my orders.
Preventing Vi and Caitlyn from returning.

113
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:57,458
Or he's finally flipped.

114
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,416
Hmm.

115
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,166
The chembarons scheduled an assembly.

116
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,750
Oh.

117
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:12,375
- I've had enough headaches.
- It didn't sound like a request.

118
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:18,958
Where are you going?

119
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,208
I need to find Jinx.

120
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,583
- Sir.
- What?

121
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,166
I got more in common
with cave lice than Jinx.

122
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:31,583
But let's just say I didn't always see
eye-to-eye with my old man.

123
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,041
And?

124
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,291
She'll come to you when she's ready.

125
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,583
Hmm.

126
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,125
<i>You lost her.</i>

127
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,750
I didn't lose her! They took her.

128
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:07,041
<i>She cares about
that enforcer, you saw it.</i>

129
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,041
She was there for me! Not the enforcer.

130
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,750
<i>Remember her name?</i>

131
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,333
Why would I remember her name?

132
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,458
Well, she's just some stupid topsider!

133
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,333
Caitlyn.

134
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:57,916
Pow.

135
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,333
Come on. Go!

136
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,666
I got it.

137
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,333
Whoo-hoo!

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,625
Is that real tree?

139
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:14,958
Pretty cool, huh?

140
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,541
When I first saw it,
I knew this was the place.

141
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:21,125
If a single seed could make it down here,
so could we.

142
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,208
You built all this?

143
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,750
Not alone.

144
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,916
After Vander...

145
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,416
...died,

146
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:31,958
Silco flooded the lanes with Shimmer.

147
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,500
He didn't care
what it did to people.

148
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,041
Everyone here was an addict or a victim.

149
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,333
Hi.

150
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,336
They needed
somewhere safe to start again.

151
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:47,666
I should have been there.
For you. For everyone.

152
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,250
That's a good way to drive yourself crazy.

153
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,458
If I just went with you that day,
maybe none of this would have happened.

154
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,791
Or maybe you'd be dead. Or... changed.

155
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,666
Powder's gone, Vi.

156
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,708
All that's left is Jinx
and she belongs to Silco.

157
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,291
You're wrong. She's still in there.
I can reach her.

158
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,416
You can't.

159
00:12:11,458 --> 00:12:12,833
I know my sister.

160
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,875
I got one more thing to show you.

161
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,875
This is everyone we've lost.

162
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:36,541
The price of our freedom.

163
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,833
Some of it was Enforcers.

164
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,000
Most was Silco.

165
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:47,083
Your sister works for him not because
she has to, but because she wants to.

166
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:49,666
I'm sorry, but that's who she is now.

167
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,875
Get down!

168
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:08,038
- Let us through!
- Come on!

169
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,625
We understand.

170
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:18,958
Just stand down!

171
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,208
- Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff.
- Not a problem, Councilor.

172
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,416
Jayce, what is this?

173
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,541
Do you have any idea how this looks?

174
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,125
I order a blockade
and my own partner violates it?

175
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,541
You ordered this? Why?

176
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,708
There are people down there
who seem hell-bent on destroying us.

177
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:41,875
What were you doing?

178
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,250
I was consulting a friend
about our quandary.

179
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,041
I told you, I knew someone.

180
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,208
Well, you didn't say
they were from the undercity.

181
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,958
What difference does that make?

182
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:53,250
What diff... They're dangerous.

183
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,083
I'm from the undercity.

184
00:13:56,166 --> 00:13:57,791
You're right.

185
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,333
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,625
I've had a lot on my plate.

187
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,000
Was your friend able to help?

188
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:06,625
No.

189
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,625
No, he said, "Nature was resistant
to this sort of tampering."

190
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,041
All right, we'll keep at it.

191
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,958
First, this wild attack
in the heart of Piltover.

192
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,958
Now, the border's closing.

193
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:43,208
We're bleeding money and for what?

194
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:48,083
His dreams of rebellion?
He's losing control.

195
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,416
If we stand together...

196
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,416
We aren't due for an assembly.

197
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:58,541
We should be.

198
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:02,583
Ever since your stunt topside,
profits have been plummeting.

199
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,625
He's right.
Merchandise is frozen at the border.

200
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,833
Topsiders are too afraid to cross.

201
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:11,791
We're all wondering,
what's your plan to fix this?

202
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,333
You're all wondering, are you?

203
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:22,500
Way I see it, we should cut a deal
and give back the Gemstone.

204
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,750
Better to have some trade
than none at all.

205
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,083
The border issue is temporary.
Jinx will deal with it.

206
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,958
Huh.

207
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,041
Rumor is, your dog's off her leash.

208
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:41,958
How you meant to bring Piltover to heel
if you can't handle your own people, huh?

209
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,583
What's that?

210
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,583
Oh, you don't recognize it?

211
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,875
Have you forgotten
where we came from?

212
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,541
The mines they had us in?

213
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,208
Air so thick it clogged your throat.

214
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,791
Stuck in your eyes.

215
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,000
But I pulled you all up
from the depths.

216
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:24,500
Offered you a taste of topside.

217
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,791
And fresh air.

218
00:16:30,916 --> 00:16:32,666
I gave you life.

219
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,500
Purpose.

220
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,916
But you've grown fat and complacent.

221
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,958
Too much time in the sun.

222
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:00,833
We came from a world where there
was never enough to go around, Finn.

223
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:06,000
That is why we fight.

224
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:07,791
Do you remember?

225
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:13,958
Sorry. Please.

226
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:17,333
Please.

227
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,833
Don't forget again.

228
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,375
Good meeting.

229
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,958
I've had word from
our friends overseas.

230
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,250
This threat from the undercity
is drawing attention.

231
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,375
Piltover looks vulnerable.

232
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,500
It's too soon. Jayce isn't ready.

233
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,625
There's one other thing.

234
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,625
This arrived for you.

235
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,041
Hmm?

236
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,791
What have you done with Vi?

237
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:16,750
Listen, let her go. I brought her here.
It's me you want.

238
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,000
- My hero.
- You're...

239
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,875
But I thought you...
I thought they were hurting you!

240
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:26,833
Vi tells me I can trust you.

241
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,125
You get
a pass back topside, that's it.

242
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,291
Let's go.

243
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,541
Let me help you with that.

244
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,750
Where've you been, Jinx?

245
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:54,541
Oh, you know.
Here, there, chasing down dead ends.

246
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:58,916
And guess what? They're not all dead.

247
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,333
I can explain.

248
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,750
Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.

249
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:09,875
I didn't know. Marcus never told me
she was in Stillwater.

250
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,791
But you found out she came back.

251
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,458
You lied.

252
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,708
- I wanted to protect you.
- From what?

253
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:25,000
She and the enforcer are back
for the crystal. Not for you.

254
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,875
Have you forgotten how she left you?

255
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:33,625
Who found you? Who cared for you?
Gave you a home?

256
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:39,083
I am your family.
Everyone else betrays us.

257
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:43,041
I need you.

258
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,916
Now more than ever.

259
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,333
You have to complete the weapon.

260
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,250
It's beautiful.

261
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:18,583
If your people had your way,
it'd be rubble and ash.

262
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,291
It's a misunderstanding.

263
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,666
They think you work for Silco.

264
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,750
Your people hunt us like animals.
Silco pays them to do it.

265
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,041
That's not possible. You're wrong.

266
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,250
Say that one more time.

267
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,750
Ekko, she believes what she's saying,
okay? She's not your enemy.

268
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, yeah? Then what's this?

269
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:45,333
You got it.
You have to let me take that back.

270
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,750
What is it?

271
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,041
It's a Gemstone.

272
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:53,666
It was stolen during the attack.
By your sister.

273
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,958
You just forgot to mention that?

274
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,375
With this, someone
with the right knowledge could build...

275
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,750
any Hextech device.

276
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:07,291
If enforcers are becoming
more... aggressive, that's why.

277
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,750
We could beat Silco with this.

278
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,833
That won't solve things.

279
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:16,583
Easy for you to say. Your people
aren't dying all around you.

280
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:21,000
Ekko, it's wrong what's been done to you.

281
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,500
You'd be well
within your rights to keep it.

282
00:22:25,083 --> 00:22:26,416
I couldn't blame you.

283
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,208
But... if you do,

284
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:32,625
this cycle of violence will never stop.

285
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,000
This is our best shot
at setting the record straight.

286
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,291
This city needs healing.

287
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,791
More than I ever realized.

288
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,791
Please, let me help you.

289
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:48,958
You got a plan?

290
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:51,500
I have a friend on the council.

291
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:54,000
Let me take the Gemstone to him.

292
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,000
He'll listen to me.
Your people wouldn't have to hide anymore.

293
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:04,208
One condition.
I'm the one who gives it to them.

294
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,125
Um, the form is crude, but...

295
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:14,833
uh, the engineering is... inspired.

296
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,416
You think they could crack Hextech?

297
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,708
Mm. It's a leap.

298
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:24,125
It's been suggested that they may
have found a way to utilize the Gemstone.

299
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:28,458
If we are to assume the worst, that would
mean they've turned it into a weapon.

300
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:30,458
Well, do we know this for certain?

301
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:32,833
We can't afford to wait to find out.

302
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,000
Wait. What are you suggesting?

303
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,708
We should prepare our own countermeasures.

304
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,000
You want us to build weapons?

305
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:47,041
Absolutely not.
That is not why we invented Hextech.

306
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,625
We would shatter
any attempt at peace.

307
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:52,184
- Heimerdinger would never go for this.
- Heimerdingers' inaction

308
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,625
is what brought us here.
You said so yourself.

309
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:58,875
The peace is already broken, Jayce.

310
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,416
I'm only asking you to prepare
to defend your people.

311
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,291
If we're lucky,
we'll never need to use it.

312
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:10,208
The decision is yours.

313
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,791
Ridiculous.
You cannot be considering this.

314
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,833
What if she's right? Are we just
gonna stand by while they attack us?

315
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:29,500
We're scientists, not soldiers.

316
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,250
We have the knowledge to defend ourselves.

317
00:24:32,333 --> 00:24:34,666
We agreed Hextech was to improve lives...

318
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,083
...not to take them.

319
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,583
We may not have a choice.

320
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:57,083
There is always a choice.

321
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:00,833
I need to think.

322
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,250
What are they?

323
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:02,250
We call them firelights.
Never seen so many though.

324
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:36,375
I'm worried I have to do something
I never thought I would.

325
00:28:03,416 --> 00:28:04,458
Vi?

326
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:09,625
I can't leave her again.

327
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,291
You can't change her.

328
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:13,916
I have to try.

329
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:19,041
Don't get yourself killed.

330
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:22,041
No promises.

331
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:34,125
It's been real, Cupcake.
Thanks. For everything.

332
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:46,208
Shut up. It's just a goodbye hug.

333
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:50,458
She wouldn't do that. Not again.

334
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,101
Halt!

335
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,291
What the hell is this?

336
00:29:22,583 --> 00:29:26,583
Sir! I have proof.
Silco's behind everything.

337
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:33,833
Show me.

338
00:29:37,958 --> 00:29:38,958
No.

339
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:40,791
Hmm.

340
00:29:42,583 --> 00:29:43,583
Shit.

341
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,083
Caitlyn!

342
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:16,875
Liar.

343
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:21,083
I told you to leave this alone.

344
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:05,416
Tell my...

345
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,958
Tell my daughter I...

346
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:18,916
Go!

347
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:43,291
Oh, look who it is. The boy savior.

348
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:03,791
Hah.

349
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,458
Yes!

350
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,625
No.
