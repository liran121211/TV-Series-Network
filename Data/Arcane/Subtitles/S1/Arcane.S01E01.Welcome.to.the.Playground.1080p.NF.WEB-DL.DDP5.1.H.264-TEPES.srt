Aw, man.

30
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,291
Hey, Powder.

31
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,083
Come take a look.

32
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:58,833
Whoa.

33
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,125
It's nice getting above it all, huh?

34
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,833
One day, I'm gonna ride
in one of those things.

35
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,500
And one day,
I'm gonna shoot one of 'em down.

36
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,875
Vi, are, are you sure about this?

37
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,078
- Look, if we get caught, we're...
- We're not gonna get caught.

38
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,291
We'll be in and out before anyone notices.

39
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:44,125
All right, everybody, follow me.
Just don't look down.

40
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,916
Couldn't we have at least
just walked there?

41
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,666
Gotta stay out of sight for this one.

42
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,750
Called it.

43
00:06:18,833 --> 00:06:20,500
This is on you, Vi.

44
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:21,708
- I'll get her.
- No.

45
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:22,958
Powder, look at me.

46
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:25,625
What did I tell you?

47
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:27,666
That...

48
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,291
...I'm ready.

49
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,375
That's right! So?

50
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:40,875
Phew!

51
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:52,750
Thanks.

52
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,708
What if Vander finds out
we're all the way up here?

53
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:15,833
Look around you.

54
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,333
You think anyone topside's going hungry?

55
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,896
Besides, this is exactly the sort of job
Vander would've pulled

56
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,958
when he was our age.

57
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,500
I'm going. Are you with me or not?

58
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,083
Vander's gonna kill us.

59
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,458
Yeah, only if we screw up.

60
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,791
So don't screw up.

61
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,875
All clear.

62
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,208
Who locks their balcony?

63
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:00,958
Hmm.

64
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:06,875
Whew.

65
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,798
There's tons of enforcers
down there.

66
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,250
Means we're in the right place.

67
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,555
You gonna get that door open
any time soon?

68
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,916
Working on it.

69
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,142
Seeing as I'm the only one
who knows how to pick locks,

70
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,833
I suggest...

71
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,416
Animals.

72
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,458
You know, Claggor, for once you're right.

73
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,500
We are definitely not supposed to be here.

74
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,250
Hmm.

75
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,583
Must be an inventor.

76
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,083
Huh.

77
00:09:10,541 --> 00:09:13,625
Whoa, I think this is a real Valdiani.

78
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,791
Oh, yeah? What about this?

79
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,250
That's a nose hair trimmer.

80
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:26,573
Keep an eye out for anything
that looks valuable, Powder.

81
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,458
Before Mylo fills the bag with junk.

82
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,250
Uh... guys?

83
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,416
Wait, Vi, how the hell
did we find this place?

84
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,875
It was a tip from Little Man.

85
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,833
- Little Man?
- Just leave it.

86
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:47,916
Come on.

87
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,000
How can anyone
have so much stuff?

88
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,208
Simple, just get born lucky.

89
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,791
Woo-hoo!

90
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,833
Mm.

91
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:35,791
Huh.

92
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,083
Whoa.

93
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,875
Mylo.

94
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,458
Powder, we gotta go.

95
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:12,125
Hello?

96
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,833
Is someone in there?

97
00:11:21,416 --> 00:11:23,750
Come on.

98
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,706
We'll be fine. Just get back on the roof.

99
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,208
Hold on!

100
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:54,916
Whoa! Look out!

101
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,125
Watch out!

102
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,208
Hey.

103
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,250
Shit.

104
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,916
Stop right there!

105
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,541
Get them off!

106
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,000
Faster!

107
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,625
Hey! Hey!

108
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,916
Look out!

109
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,291
Down there!

110
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,541
You can't get away!

111
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,680
- Hey!
- Come on!

112
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,458
Oh.

113
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,250
This way!

114
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,375
Keep going!

115
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,458
Go, go, go!

116
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,541
Oh, man, not again.

117
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:34,865
I just got this shirt...

118
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,625
Thought last time was the last time
we were gonna do this.

119
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:57,416
Well, this time's the last time.

120
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,041
Guys, what was that?
What the hell happened back there?

121
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't know. I didn't do anything.

122
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,791
You could fill a damn library
with all the things you didn't do.

123
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:11,583
Guys, we just emptied a Piltover penthouse
right under the enforcers' noses.

124
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:16,333
So, if you're done beating yourselves up,
let's get this home.

125
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,500
- Nice haul?
- You could say that.

126
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,240
I heard there was some action
across the river.

127
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,791
Someone, uh,
someone really kicked the nest, huh?

128
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:50,958
Is that so?

129
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:59,208
But now you're, you're tracking
this mess of yours through my streets.

130
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:02,875
- Your streets? What makes you think...
- Listen, we don't want any trouble, okay?

131
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:05,458
Hear that, Deckard?
They don't want any trouble.

132
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,916
You know, in my experience,
trouble finds you.

133
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,666
There's no reason this has to get ugly.

134
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,708
How about you share
a little taste of your treasure there

135
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,875
- and we'll call it even?
- No, no, no. We worked too hard to...

136
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:25,916
Just a taste?

137
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,833
Just a...

138
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,375
Huh?

139
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:28,416
Huh.

140
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,458
This day's turning out all right
after all.

141
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,583
Wait!

142
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,375
Wanna see how that ends?

143
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:47,291
Where's Powder?

144
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:54,708
Oh! Oh! You little...

145
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,250
Oh!

146
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:18,958
Come on, Mouser, I need you!

147
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,750
No.

148
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,833
- You did what?
- I'm sorry.

149
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,583
I tried to fight him off with Mouser,
but... she didn't work.

150
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,500
- Who saw that coming?
- We never should have gone over there.

151
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,708
Doesn't matter. The stuff's gone.

152
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:13,791
It's all right, Powder.
At least you're okay.

153
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,833
Okay? What about us?

154
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,375
I get my face bashed in,
and she just gets a pass?

155
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,458
Yup.

156
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,000
Every time. Every time she comes,
something goes wrong.

157
00:19:33,791 --> 00:19:35,333
She jinxes every job.

158
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,500

Mm. I suppose it does.

00:21:26,166 --> 00:21:27,625
Uh, wait a minute.

This, uh...

177
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,958
uh, this... isn't what we agreed on, so...

178
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,666
Well, demand for your wares has dropped
since we made our arrangements.

181
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,583
we shook on it.

00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:41,500
Ten thousand.

183
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,041
- Such are the risks of business.
- Ten.

184
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:46,041
It's a fair price.

185
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,166
I think you should take it.

186
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,416
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

187
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,083
I can't do that. I can't do that!

188
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,250
Make your choice.

189
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,041
You folks need anything?

190
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,250
Leave us.

191
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,875
You sure about that?

192
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,458
- Sounded to me like...
- Piss off.

193
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,916
Ah.

194
00:22:20,583 --> 00:22:22,708
I think I know what you need.

195
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,625
- You don't seem to listen, barman...
- A bit of advice.

196
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,166
Don't threaten the guy
who pours the drinks.

197
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:36,000
So you're Vander.

198
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:39,208
Hound of the Underground.

199
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,958
I expected something... younger.

200
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,041
We were expecting traders
who would honor their word,

201
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,791
so I guess we're all disappointed.

202
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:52,083
You got us all wrong, my friend.

203
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:55,000
We were just... negotiating.

204
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,250
Now you're speaking my language.

205
00:22:57,333 --> 00:23:00,541
How about you just give Huck
the rest of what you owe him,

206
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:03,750
and I'll let you walk out of here
in one piece?

207
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,583
Do we, uh... have a deal?

208
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:21,166
This is vile.

209
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:23,375
You'll learn to love it.

210
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,791
Welcome to the Lanes.

211
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,708
Vander learns none of this.

212
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:41,583
No worries there.
Powder took care of the evidence.

213
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:45,666
I tried, okay? You don't get it.
You're older, you're bigger.

214
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,791
- It, it isn't fair.
- So stick with us!

215
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:49,375
Take a punch or two.

216
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,958
- Everyone all right?
- Never better.

217
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,041
Good.

218
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,958
I don't suppose you can explain why it is
that I'm hearing about an explosion

219
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:04,500
and a foot chase topside?

220
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,583
Four children fleeing the scene.

221
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,041
What the hell were you thinking?

222
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:13,916
That we can handle a real job.

223
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,291
A real job?

224
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,309
We got our own tip, planned a route,
nobody even saw.

225
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:19,416
- You blew up a building.
- That wasn't...

226
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,250
Did you even stop to think about
what could have happened to you?

227
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:24,041
Eh? To them?

228
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,916
Where did you even get this tip?

229
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:37,708
- We just heard it at Benzo's shop.
- From?

230
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,791
Little Man.

231
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,375
I took us there.
If you wanna be mad, be mad at me.

232
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:47,418
But you're the one who always says
we have to earn our place in this world.

233
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,500
I also told you time and time again,
the Northside's off-limits.

234
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:54,416
- We stay out of Piltover's business.
- Why?

235
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,583
They've got plenty, while we're down here
scraping together coins.

236
00:24:57,666 --> 00:25:00,208
When did you get so comfortable
living in someone else's shadow?

237
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,250
Everyone out.

238
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,708
Sit down.

239
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:17,958
- I'm fine.
- Sit. Down.

240
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,375
Those kids look up to you.

241
00:25:28,791 --> 00:25:29,791
Yeah, I know.

242
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,791
You know, but you don't know.

243
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,166
When people look up to you,
you don't get to be selfish.

244
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:36,375
- I'm not...
- You say run, they run.

245
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:37,958
You say swim, they dive in.

246
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:40,375
You say light a fire,
they show up with oil.

247
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,208
But whatever happens, it's on you.

248
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:49,500
Just like it's on me
what happens to us down here.

249
00:25:49,583 --> 00:25:54,291
We make ourselves a problem for Piltover,
and they will send the enforcers.

250
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:56,458
So? Why answer to them?

251
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:59,041
These are our streets.
Someone should remind them of that.

252
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,458
You're not hearing me. That path?

253
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
This?

254
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:05,583
It's not gonna solve your problems.

255
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,666
Just makes more of them.

256
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,458
We clear?

257
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:18,333
How'd you get this?

258
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,458
Some idiot was following us.

259
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:23,208
On our side? Who?

260
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,541
I don't know. He was after the stuff.

261
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,750
Where is it now?

262
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:31,333
We lost it.

263
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:33,625
All of it?

264
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:35,750
Good.

265
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,541
Nothing can tie you
to what happened up there.

266
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,083
You're gonna have to lay low
for a bit, understand?

267
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:45,041
Okay.

268
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,041
We're gonna be fine, right?

269
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:49,791
I'll take care of it.

270
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:01,375
Oh, you did put that idiot
on his ass, though, right?

271
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:02,958
Mm.

272
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:15,541
Get up, Claggor. We're going out.

273
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,625
Wait, now?

274
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,208
Hey, hey, that's mine!

275
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:22,833
You wanna be treated like adults, right?

276
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:26,500
Then you should know better than
to come back from a job empty-handed.

277
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,906
I'm gonna have a little word
with your informant.

278
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:35,583
All right, give me the details
of exactly what happened up there.

279
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,708
She's a problem.

280
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,070
Mylo, I'm really not...

281
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,916
Do you remember
what was in that bag?

282
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,875
The biggest payout
we've ever seen and she just lost it.

283
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:03,458
She made a mistake.

284
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:05,375
Name one time she hasn't.

285
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,833
- She's young.
- Don't bullshit me.

286
00:28:07,916 --> 00:28:09,833
You were twice the person at half her age.

287
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,125
You know what, Mylo? You're right.

288
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:15,791
There's a bunch of things Powder
just can't do.

289
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,875
You don't have to tell me twice.

290
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,250
- Like, complain about everything.
- What?

291
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:25,166
- And brag nonstop.
- Okay, okay, I see where this is going.

292
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,791
Pick fights with the group
when we need to focus.

293
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:28,708
Vi, I...

294
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:31,708
And tell strangers on the street
that we got a nice haul?

295
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:34,416
- I, I didn't mean to...
- Powder's my problem, okay?

296
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,300
Your problem is never knowing
when to shut up.

297
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:38,541
But I'm gonna help you with that. Ready?

298
00:28:38,625 --> 00:28:40,083
You see this look on my face?

299
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:42,750
This will always mean
it's time to shut up.

300
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,416
But... I...

301
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,000
Nobody comes in.

302
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:58,416
We're closed.

303
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,083
Well, open up.

304
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,458
For good. You can take
your worthless junk elsewhere.

305
00:29:04,541 --> 00:29:06,291
Just as well.

306
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:08,916
Owner's the shittiest businessman I know.

307
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:15,125
Ekko. What's going on with that thing?

308
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,916
Give me a few seconds.
The cannon pinion's still busted.

309
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,416
Finish it later. Vander and I need a word.

310
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,291
- But...
- Uh-uh. Off you go.

311
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:30,123
- Claggor.
- He-he-hey, Little Man.

312
00:29:30,583 --> 00:29:31,666
You're a little early.

313
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,875
My guys are still roundin' up
this month's collections.

314
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:37,250
Won't have numbers until next, um...

315
00:29:38,041 --> 00:29:39,041
Whoo.

316
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,083
Why are you muckin' about with this?

317
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,041
I assume you've heard.

318
00:29:44,125 --> 00:29:46,041
Yeah, me and half the undercity.

319
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:49,833
How could they be so stupid?

320
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,375
The younger folk think
it's the right thing to do.

321
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,291
Yeah, and Vi's one of them.

322
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,250
Throws herself at trouble
wherever she can find some.

323
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,333
Eh, they're growing up, Vander.

324
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,708
Looking to write their own stories.
You can't protect them forever.

325
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,500
Someone was following them.

326
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:10,041
- Whole lot of someones, from what I heard.
- Not enforcers.

327
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:12,750
- Someone on our side.
- Who?

328
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:17,250
There's worse things
than enforcers out there.

329
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:19,833
We both know that.

330
00:30:21,708 --> 00:30:23,458
Yeah, I was hopin' you'd be working today.

331
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,333
- Did you guys go?
- Sure did.

332
00:30:25,416 --> 00:30:28,125
Hey, listen, how did you find that place?

333
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,708
- I just...
- Whoa, did you fight the enforcers?

334
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,583
What? Oh, no. Eh, just some bums.

335
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,625
Oh, did Vi kick their asses?

336
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,666
Yeah, I mean,
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

337
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,708
Oh, she showed me
a couple moves to practice. Look.

338
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:44,458
- Yeah, it's... it's coming along.
- Ya!

339
00:30:44,541 --> 00:30:46,541
Hey, so, how'd you find
that place, anyway?

340
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:48,833
Uh, this weirdo came into the shop.

341
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:51,791
Bought a whole bunch of stuff
Benzo only keeps there for display.

342
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,125
He paid in gold and didn't even haggle.

343
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,000
I charged him double price. Sucker.

344
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,500
- But how did you know where he lived?
- Uh, followed him.

345
00:31:00,583 --> 00:31:02,666
- How else?
- Oh. Right.

346
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,916
Oh, crap.

347
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,125
- Uh...
- They'll be fine. Go.

348
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, hello.

349
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,520
Evening, friends.

350
00:31:30,375 --> 00:31:31,833
Shit.

351
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,791
Something I can help you with?

352
00:31:37,875 --> 00:31:41,500
Some trencher trash attacked one
of the buildings in the Academy district,

353
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,083
but you already knew that.

354
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,125
We're looking for the culprits.

355
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,208
Got a description?

356
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:50,166
Yeah, it's exactly who you're picturing
in that thick head of yours.

357
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,416
Mm. You think my head is thick?

358
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,583
Uh, just past the average.

359
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:55,958
Listen, you shady son of a...

360
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,791
How about you go
for a little walk, Marcus?

361
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,375
Cool off a bit.

362
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:02,541
Go.

363
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,733
Lovely chap you've brought.

364
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:39,616
Don't mind the kid.

365
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,666
Doesn't know when to pipe down.

366
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,250
Some things are the same
topside and bottom.

367
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,125
You know this crossed a line upstairs.

368
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:52,416
Was anyone hurt?

369
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,416
A building was blown to bits.
What do you think?

370
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,541
Those who did this will be dealt with.

371
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:03,291
That workshop belonged to the Kirammans.

372
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:06,125
You know what kind of stuff
they had in there?

373
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:09,250
Makes this place look like a candy shop.

374
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,750
The Council needs someone
to make an example of.

375
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,583
People need to feel safe.

376
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:16,416
Yeah, topside people.

377
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,291
We had a deal, Vander.

378
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:22,375
You keep your people off my streets,
and I stay out of your business.

379
00:33:24,416 --> 00:33:26,875
Give me a name. We'll do things quiet.

380
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:28,958
No one will know you were involved.

381
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,500
I can't do that.

382
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:33,791
You don't seem to grasp
how serious this is.

383
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:36,250
If I don't put someone
behind bars tonight,

384
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:40,375
the next time I come down here,
I'll have an army of enforcers with me.

385
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,583
We both know how that'll go.

386
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:46,583
I'm sorry, Grayson,
but I can't offer up my own people.

387
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:55,208
If you change your mind,
this will reach me.

388
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:57,833
And only me.

389
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:25,625
What are you calling this one?

390
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,500
Whisker.

391
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,666
- You wanna talk about today?
- What's the point?

392
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:37,958
I ruined everything. I always do.

393
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,333
Nobody said that.

394
00:34:39,416 --> 00:34:43,416
No. Just that you were
"twice the person" at half my age.

395
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:46,083
You heard them.

396
00:34:46,166 --> 00:34:48,083
I'm not a fighter.

397
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,500
You don't have to be.

398
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:54,916
Look, I've got these and you've got those.

399
00:34:55,416 --> 00:34:56,583
They never work.

400
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,500
They will.

401
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,416
- Come with me.
- What?

402
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,208
Come on.

403
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,625
What are we doing here?

404
00:35:20,958 --> 00:35:22,833
See that gutter running along the canal?

405
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:34,041
That's where Claggor got his foot
stuck running from enforcers.

406
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:38,125
They thought it was funny,
so they left him there.

407
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,125
He was out all night before we found him.

408
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:44,583
That sign?

409
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,208
- You see it?
- Uh-huh.

410
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,666
Mylo tripped over his own paint bucket

411
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,458
and nearly fell off trying to draw
a giant middle finger.

412
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:58,166
His ass made that splotch.

413
00:36:00,375 --> 00:36:01,375
And that?

414
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:07,875
When I was a kid, some guy took
my favorite toy and threw it up there.

415
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:11,458
I used to come out here at night
and stare at it,

416
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:17,375
hoping maybe the wind
or a bird might knock it down.

417
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,625
We've all had bad days.

418
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:27,083
But we learn. And we stick together.

419
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:32,291
Oh, I forgot.

420
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:34,541
These were in my pocket.

421
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,958
- They're from the apartment.
- What are they?

422
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:40,958
I don't know.

423
00:36:42,125 --> 00:36:44,083
- Should we show Vander?
- No.

424
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,833
Let's keep this our little secret.

425
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:56,000
Mylo's wrong, Powder.
You're stronger than you think.

426
00:36:57,166 --> 00:36:58,333
And one day...

427
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,541
this city's gonna respect us.

428
00:37:35,708 --> 00:37:38,666
You were supposed to follow them
and not interfere.

429
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:41,708
I'm sorry.

430
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:44,208
They just caught us by surprise.

431
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:48,416
Now his accomplice
is asking questions about you.

432
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:52,208
That's not a risk I'm willing to take.

433
00:37:54,791 --> 00:37:59,833
The kids. It was their fault,
the explosion in the upper city.

434
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:01,708
That was them?

435
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:05,416
Yeah. The topsiders
are up in arms looking for 'em.

436
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,625
Vander's in trouble.

437
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:16,750
Smartest thing you ever said, boy.

438
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,625
Get him a meal.

439
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:22,291
But keep him off the streets.

440
00:38:26,083 --> 00:38:27,958
Our timeline has moved up.

441
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:30,291
It's almost ready.

442
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:33,666
Show me.

443
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:43,041
Feeding time.

444
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,125
And the side effects?

445
00:38:51,666 --> 00:38:53,541
Stabilizing.

446
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:34,250
You have a subject in mind?

447
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,083
Someone just volunteered.
