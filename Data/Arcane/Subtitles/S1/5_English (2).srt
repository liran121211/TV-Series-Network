[Caitlyn]
I heard the bathysphere has a nice view.

184
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,041
That could be a good way
to get a lay of the land.

185
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,500
Too risky.

186

Welcome to the Lanes.

You almost got me killed.

205
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,958
My little sister could do that
when she was seven.

Don't you want to blend in?

[Jayce] You had a vision?

What if we've been looking at it
backwards?

211
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,541
[Viktor] We've been trying to discover
runes that invoke specific effects

212
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,083
and then molding them
to a useful function.

213
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,750
Tools, as you like to put it. But, but…

214
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:47,625
If the legends are true,
mages aren't bound to single functions.

215
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,416
It's said the Arcane speaks through them.

216
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,250
I'm still not following.

217
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,750
[Viktor] They think. They adapt.

218
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,458
You think Hextech can… learn?

219
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,250
Are you sure this is safe?

220
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,666
Of course not.

No. Thank you.

229
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,333
You're missing out.

230
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,458
Are you going to question him?

231
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,375
About what? The meat?

232
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,583
Definitely not above board.

233
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:45,041
Silco. His connections?
Isn't that why we're here?

234
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,041
We're here because I'm hungry.
Do you know what prison food is like?

235
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,708
No, of course, you don't.

236
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,708
Unbelievable. I didn't break you
out of jail to eat… slop.

237
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,791
I knew this was a terrible idea.
You don't actually know anything, do you?

238
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,041
Mm. Better than I remember.

[violin music playing]

243
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,208
[Jayce] I haven't been here in years.

244
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,250
Since my parents brought me
for the winter fest.

245
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,708
We're not here for the performance.
Your House is in trouble.

246
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,833
That merchant formerly enjoyed
certain leniencies

247
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:40,708
with regard to her trade in exchange
for her generous Academy patronage.

248
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,458
By leniencies you mean corruption?

249
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,666
Hmm, Amara's harmless.

250
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,083
Oh, look at those two stooges.

251
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,250
Councilors Hoskel and Salo.
Don't they hate each other?

252
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,000
Hmm. But they share a taste
for the finer Noxian spirits,

253
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,916
technically an illegal import.

254
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,958
I tightened our security.

255
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,541
And in so doing,
put a target on your back.

256
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:08,666
There are those who covet your power
over the wealth the Hexgates afford.

257
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,708
And would take any opportunity
to seize it from you.

258
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,166
You've just made yourself
everyone's common enemy, Jayce.

of the Hexgates for collateral.

No one's asking you to.
These are simply favors amongst friends.

I never wanted anything to do
with politics. You pushed this on me.

to shape your own destiny.

Councilor Medarda. Councilor Talis.

He's just as precocious as ever.

[Amara and Mel chuckle]

[Mel] Oh, I hope you'll understand,
Jayce had to make a show of safety.

314
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,458
But he's here now to negotiate
all his deals personally.

315
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,041
Councilor Talis is willing to reinstate
former trade privileges

316
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,041
to those who share his vision.

317
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,791
Can we count you amongst them?

arrangements would be more profitable.

You know, Councilor Medarda's right.
The Hexgates are only the beginning.

324
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,750
In fact, we're currently looking
for new partners in our Hextech research,

325
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,833
and as a supporter of House Talis,

326
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,875
you'd be the first in line
to any of our advancements.

331
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,333
Mm. Your audience awaits, Councilor.

332
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,416
He's been quite the investment.

333
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,541

You expect everyone

If you really want people to talk to you,

360

I'm Pim. What's your name?

The Hextech wonder boy
is on the Council now,

and he's asking questions.

380

It's only a matter of time
before he finds the truth.

Once we've cracked their prize,
topside will have no power over us.

I can't do it.
Just… give it to the doctor.

You're the only one
I can trust with this, Jinx.

Sweetheart, I was real sad
to hear about Vander.

401

And the kids. Just terrible.

402
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,916
By the looks of it, no one down here
lifted a finger to stop Silco.

403
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:04,666
A few tried but Silco's got the muscle…
and the money.

404
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,208
He took over the Last Drop.

I think Silco has her.

My father put hammers
in the hands of the people,

422

and they built this magnificent city.
