1
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,166
Whoo!

2
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,916
Come over here, come on!

3
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,166
Sky?

4
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,458
Don't be afraid.

5
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,291
You built this?

6
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,750
Why aren't you playing with the others?

7
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,500
Hm.

8
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:26,083
Loneliness is often the byproduct
of a gifted mind.

9
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:27,708
What is it?

10
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,666
Hmm? Oh. This is Rio.

11
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,375
She's a rare mutation that I cultivated.

12
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,125
Here.

13
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,583
-Go on.

14
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,083
Hmm.

15
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,833
-She's dying.

16
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:08,916
I'm attempting to prevent that.
The mutation must survive.

17
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:10,500
Can I help?

18
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,208
You want to assist me?

19
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,000
Very well.

20
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:20,958
We can be loners together.

21
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,541
Good to see some things haven't changed.

22
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:44,666
Seems just yesterday I stumbled upon
an aspiring young scholar

23
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,083
from the undercity here,

24
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:49,916
ruminating in his steel oasis.

25
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:53,083
I heard your prognosis.

26
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,416
I'm terribly sorry, my boy.

27
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,000
Do you contemplate death, Professor?

28
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,583
Only that of friends.

29
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,791
I suppose your legacy
has been well-secured.

30
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,041
As one of Piltover's founders,

31
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,666
what haven't you to show
for your remarkable life?

32
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:18,541
You should be proud
of what you've accomplished, Viktor.

33
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,875
Figments.

34
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:28,166
My contributions will be short-lived,
even in your memory.

35
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,375
I have seen many students.

36
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:37,666
It's a sad truth that those
who shine brightest often burn fastest.

37
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:09,166
{\an8}

38
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:14,541
{\an8}

39
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,333
I didn't know you were an artist.

40
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:11,166
Hm. There's quite a lot about me
you don't know.

41
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:15,375
Listen, I'm sorry
for disappearing last night.

42
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,250
-Duty calls.

43
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,125
Viktor's dying.

44
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:39,791
I think it has something to do with gasses
in the fissures where he grew up.

45
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:42,500
Exactly the sort of thing
we wanted to fix with Hextech.

46
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:48,958
Improving lives. Solving real issues,
not just trade disputes.

47
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,041
Viktor saved my life once.

48
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,708
Now, he needs me
and there's nothing I can do.

49
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,458
I hate feeling so useless.

50
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,875
I didn't realize you were so close.

51
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:02,000
He's like my brother.

52
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,458
Why did you come to me with this?

53
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:08,875
I just…

54
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,041
Nothing feels impossible
when I'm with you.

55
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,333
I'm an exile from my family.

56
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,250
What?

57
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:20,750
Why?

58
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,750
I fell short of Medarda standards.

59
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,375
I don't believe that for a second.

60
00:07:27,541 --> 00:07:28,500
Do you?

61
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,750
You should be with him, Jayce.

62
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,666
We can't change
what fate has in store for us,

63
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,666
-but we don't have to face it alone.

64
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:42,958
It's a beautiful painting.

65
00:08:48,666 --> 00:08:50,458
-Chuck!

66
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,375
Thieram. Uh… My name's Thieram.

67
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,916
Nice try, Chuck.

68
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,083
What's all the hubbub?

69
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,666
Uh. Boss wants us to grab someone up.

70
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,916
Someone? Anyone?

71
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,250
-Who are you grabbing?
-Some girls.

72
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,083
I mean, I mean not…
I'm not grabbing girls.

73
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,125
Oh, other than the… those ones… I guess.

74
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,625
Focus. Who are they?
Why wasn't I invited to the party?

75
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:19,375
Uh, I don't know.

76
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:22,875
They… they got in a fight with Sevika.
They did a number on her.

77
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,791
Oh really? Which number?

78
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,666
It's like a saying…

79
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,583
You're doing great, Chuck.

80
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,333
Here, for your troubles.

81
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,458
Silco's goons aren't far behind.

82
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,125
We have to keep moving.

83
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,291
What the hell is that?

84
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:00,458
The sign.

85
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,875
Never mind, just help me to the edge.

86
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,958
-Can you do this in your--

87
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,833
Shit.

88
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,958
Come on!

89
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,208
Come on. Let's go!

90
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:50,375
We lost her.

91
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,166
Lost who?

92
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:33,208
I feel like you and I
got off on the wrong arm.

93
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,250
Maybe we should try the other.

94
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:42,541
No need. It's your sister.

95
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,166
She's back. She's looking for you.

96
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,625
It's not what you think.

97
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:53,041
She's with some girl enforcer.
Guess she replaced you.

98
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:55,666
You're lying!

99
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,708
Why bother?

100
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:01,125
Her back in town, it's only a matter
of time before you implode

101
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,583
and Silco finally gets the message

102
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,583
that you're about as good for our cause
as you were for your family.

103
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:08,666
-Jinx.

104
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,625
Ten outta ten, toots!

105
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:22,708
I think I know
just how to deliver that message.

106
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:57,416
Ah, about time Daddy joined us.

107
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:01,666
You were so busy,
little Ren here saw me in.

108
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,416
Let's talk outside.

109
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,041
Can't you see we're playing?

110
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:24,375
You remember our old friend Vi, don't you?

111
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,916
Vander's daughter. She was about your age.

112
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Her father went on a long trip and Daddy
here assured me that she left with him.

113
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:38,250
But it seems she never made it.
Isn't that sad?

114
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:42,541
Could you imagine being separated
from your father?

115
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,208
She's… in a safe place.

116
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,083
She's in the Lanes.

117
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,375
That's not possible.

118
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:57,250
There's an enforcer with her. A girl.
Roughly the same age.

119
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,833
Caitlyn. She's a Kiramman. Just like them,
she does whatever she wants.

120
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,875
I… can't control her.

121
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,541
Then of what use are you?

122
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:10,875
I'll track her down.

123
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,208
I can fix this.

124
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,625
Please.

125
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,125
Everyone makes mistakes, right?

126
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,666
What's important
is that we don't repeat them.

127
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,500
-My people are tracking Vi and this…

128
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,708
…Caitlyn.
They cannot be allowed to resurface.

129
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,208
Do we understand each other?

130
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,333
Hmm.

131
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,333
Hmm.

132
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,750
Oops. Ah. So sorry. Accidents happen.

133
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:05,583
Watch.

134
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:15,166
It responds to organic matter.

135
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,791
Incredible.

136
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,000
This is unlike anything
we've ever seen, Jayce.

137
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:33,666
It, it, it could be the key to augmenting
physiology, extending life…

138
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,708
-Curing you.

139
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,791
It's happened to everyone.

140
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,625
I can't determine why.

141
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:49,458
They're… rejecting the transmutation.

142
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,750
-We'll solve this.
-There may not be time.

143
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,833
We're in uncharted waters here and…

144
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:07,541
I can feel my body… eroding.

145
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,416
I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger.
He might know something that could help.

146
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,666
In the meantime, we'll do what we do best.

147
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:30,791
What is this place?

148
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,291
It's where the kind of people
you topsiders

149
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:36,208
-don't want to think about, wind up.

150
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,916
It was never this big, though.

151
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:52,333
There.

152
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,083
I know you have your reservations
about me,

153
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,666
but this only works
if we can trust each other.

154
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,125
It doesn't work. It never has.

155
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,125
You topsiders always find a way
to screw us.

156
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:42,500
I suppose topside is to blame
for all your misfortunes.

157
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:45,666
-No.

158
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,375
Not all of them.

159
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,541
We aren't monsters, you know.
We're people, just like you.

160
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:54,166
You don't know anything about me.

161
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,041
I shouldn't have left you.

162
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:03,041
It's all right.
Despite it all, I can tell…

163
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,500
you have a good heart.

164
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,291
-<i>You've got a good heart.</i>

165
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:15,875
What is that?

166
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,208
I'm calling it the Hexcore.

167
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:26,958
It's an adaptive rune matrix.
Hextech that evolves.

168
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,791
It's groundbreaking.

169
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,041
What's most exciting
is that it reacts to biological matter.

170
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:36,208
There are stories of healing magic.
Our samples thus far have perished…

171
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,041
You must destroy it.

172
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,375
What?

173
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,458
Please, if ever you've put faith
in my guidance, hear me now.

174
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:55,958
I've seen nations destroyed
by a single seed and it looked…

175
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,958
exactly like this.

176
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,333
Professor, this could save Viktor's life.

177
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:07,583
Viktor, something's different.
You've changed. What did you do?

178
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:09,625
What do you mean, Professor?

179
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:15,000
It's that thing. It must be destroyed!

180
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,000
-Wait.
-No. I won't let you.

181
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,666
-Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos.

182
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,333
I will have it destroyed
one way or another.

183
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:28,333
That's your opinion.
We'll see if the Council agrees.

184
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,666
I might know someone else who could help.

185
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,875
You do what you have to.
I need to get ready.

186
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:47,916
For what?

187
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,916
-Is she all right?

188
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,750
Wait, wait, wait! Easy. Easy.

189
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:07,833
That's Vi, right?

190
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,750
I'm a friend.

191
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:17,708
Or at least I was. I mean,
I… I owed her old man my life.

192
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,458
Probably more than that.

193
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,125
I guess.

194
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,583
-She's bleeding. She needs a doctor.

195
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,041
Not so simple to come by around here.

196
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,500
-Hey.

197
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:31,958
I'm sorry.

198
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:37,875
Oh, oh. But, ah, I do know someone else
who might be able to help.

199
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,458
Come with me.

200
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,333
Ailment?

201
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,833
Uh…

202
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,000
Uh… she's been stabbed.

203
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,875
She makes potions.

204
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,875
Helps people here with…

205
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,125
…with this.

206
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:14,333
Shimmer. Why would you take something
that does that to you?

207
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:19,875
I just… wanted to feel what it was like…

208
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:23,958
To be somebody.
To make other people afraid.

209
00:21:24,958 --> 00:21:26,125
-Instead of--

210
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,500
-Trade.

211
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:58,625
-Thank you, I really--

212
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:03,416
Let's go. I think Vi will be happy
to see a friendly face.

213
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,833
No, no. You go ahead.

214
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,250
She knew me when I was still…

215
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,458
Anyway, I don't want her
to see me like this.

216
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:19,875
Just tell her, uh, tell her I'm sorry.
About everything.

217
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:21,375
Okay?

218
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:37,041
I found this on one of the Firelights.

219
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:40,791
It matches fragments we found
outside your lab and at the Hexgates.

220
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:46,500
I… have reason to believe
they're planning more attacks.

221
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:49,375
Well, how has this threat
gone unnoticed for so long?

222
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:53,250
Since the Hexgates were completed,
the fissures haven't been a priority.

223
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,791
Oh, we'll settle that later. For now,
we need to prevent any further attacks.

224
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,375
Short of searching everyone
who crosses the bridges.

225
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,125
I don't know how we can.

226
00:23:03,291 --> 00:23:04,625
Then, that's what we'll do.

227
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:09,416
-Are you certain? This sort of an order--
-Do it. We have to protect the city.

228
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:17,166
One other thing.

229
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,416
I saw Caitlyn Kiramman had a prisoner
released on your order.

230
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,041
Is there anything I can assist with?

231
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,458
No. No, uh, we've got it covered.

232
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:34,416
Councilors, we have lost our way.

233
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:39,375
This city was founded
to be a bastion of enlightenment.

234
00:23:39,458 --> 00:23:43,916
In a world that cannibalized itself
over power and pride.

235
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:45,916
But we've forgotten.

236
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,125
Loosened our morals in favor
of comfort and convenience.

237
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,541
Traded honor for prestige.

238
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,708
We were once one tribe.

239
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,958
Now we are Houses divided.

240
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:04,958
I believe, if we set aside our greed
and arrogance, we can be one again.

241
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:09,041
It will take vigilance.
We must hold each other accountable.

242
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,666
And who holds you accountable?

243
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,541
What?

244
00:24:12,625 --> 00:24:14,708
Shimmer is rampant in the undercity.

245
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,791
Attacks at the Hexgates
and in the Academy Square.

246
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:22,416
Enforcers fear to set foot in the Lanes.
All under your watch.

247
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,291
Jayce, you forget yourself.

248
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,375
I'm sorry, Professor,

249
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:28,666
but healing this city
will take more than just speeches.

250
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,375
Time and again,
you've warned us what not to do.

251
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:37,041
But let me ask you this,
what's your plan to fix this?

252
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,125
I see what this is about.

253
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:42,666
Your Hextech projects need more time.
More safeguards.

254
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:47,625
Humans don't live for centuries.
We can't wait for progress.

255
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:52,708
We need a leadership
focused on the future, not the past.

256
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,041
You are the true Father of Piltover,

257
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:58,000
and your years of service
can never be repaid.

258
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,583
I believe it's time we gave
the beloved founder of our city…

259
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:05,166
a well-deserved retirement.

260
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,833
Jayce, don't do this.

261
00:25:09,166 --> 00:25:10,083
Hmm.

262
00:25:17,708 --> 00:25:20,791
It has to be unanimous.
All in favor?

263
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:31,125
With my deepest respect and appreciation,
Professor.

264
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,083
Vi.

265
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:19,958
-Easy, easy, easy.

266
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:24,750
We need you back on your feet.

267
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:28,583
What was the name Sevika gave you? Jinx?

268
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:36,208
Right. Jinx. How could I forget?

269
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:38,291
We're going to have
to be more careful now.

270
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,791
-Silco will be watching--

271
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:53,791
You used to live here?

272
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:56,375
Who's Powder?

273
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:02,208
My sister. I thought she died, but, no.

274
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,083
I have to try and find her.

275
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:07,291
How do you not know
if your sister is alive or dead?

276
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,083
It's hard to check up on people
from inside a concrete cell.

277
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,875
What, you don't have parents?

278
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,958
No! They were killed by enforcers.

279
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:43,958
Vander's prodigy.

280
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:55,458
I've regretted that we never had
the opportunity to speak.

281
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:03,000
What have you done with my sister?

282
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:06,458
-I've freed her.

283
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:10,750
Candidly, I thought you were the prize
of your secondhand family.

284
00:28:11,291 --> 00:28:12,500
But Jinx…

285
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,750
Oh. She is more than I ever imagined.

286
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:33,291
I'm gonna find her and erase whatever
fucked-up delusions you put in her head.

287
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:37,875
But first, I'm gonna bring
your bullshit empire down all around you.

288
00:28:40,416 --> 00:28:43,541
You don't know your limits, girl.
It's what got Vander killed.

289
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:47,750
What drove your sister away.
And it's why I'm here right now.

290
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:50,625
-Yeah, well…

291
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,791
You talk too much.

292
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:36,416
<i>Wherever you are,
light it up and I'll find you.</i>

293
00:31:44,458 --> 00:31:46,208
Rio will live.

294
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:47,875
You did this?

295
00:31:47,958 --> 00:31:53,541
I thought you understood.
The mutation must survive.

296
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:22,125
I understand now.

297
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:40,875
How many problems can one girl cause?

298
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,000
-Powder?

299
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,333
-Vi?

300
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:39,541
Oh, Powder!

301
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:52,291
I'm so sorry, Powder. I…

302
00:33:52,375 --> 00:33:56,208
I tried to come back. I promise, I did.
But I… I got arrested.

303
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:57,541
Marcus?

304
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,458
I don't know. I… It doesn't matter.

305
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:01,791
I just… I never thought I'd see you again.

306
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,875
Are you real?

307
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:11,833
Yes, of course. It's me, Vi, your sister.

308
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:13,875
I'm here. I'm right here.

309
00:34:15,125 --> 00:34:19,583
Things changed when you left. I changed.

310
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,916
I know, Pow-pow, I know.
You did what you had to do to survive.

311
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:28,708
Me too. It's okay.

312
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:31,125
What matters is we're together.

313
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,875
Who's she?

314
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:41,791
Who are you?

315
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:44,291
-It's okay. She's a friend.

316
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:48,125
Sevika wasn't lying?
You're with an enforcer?

317
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,041
Your sister is Jinx?

318
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,291
Caitlyn, just listen,
we can work this out.

319
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:59,291
This is a trick! You're playing me!

320
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,916
Shut up! I'm in no mood.

321
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:03,583
We didn't say anything.

322
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:04,833
I wasn't talking to you!

323
00:35:04,916 --> 00:35:06,500
Powder, it's okay.

324
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,500
Stop calling me that.

325
00:35:08,583 --> 00:35:11,958
It's Jinx now. Powder fell down a well.

326
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,125
You're not a jinx.

327
00:35:13,208 --> 00:35:15,708
-God, I never should have--
-Stop talking to me like I'm a child!

328
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,458
Was that why you came?

329
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:19,291
For this stupid stone?

330
00:35:19,375 --> 00:35:22,333
No, I don't even know what that is, I…

331
00:35:22,416 --> 00:35:25,083
{\an8}
You're a class act, Sister.

332
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:29,333
{\an8}Sister. Thought I missed her.
Bet you wouldn't miss her.

333
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,666
Powder! I'm here for you. Only you.

334
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,458
You can fire that thing if you want,
but I'm not going anywhere.

335
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:37,958
I'm not going to abandon you again.

336
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:44,000
-Everyone, shut up, I need to think.

337
00:35:44,083 --> 00:35:46,041
Do you hear that?

338
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,833
-Powder.

339
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,541
-Powder!

340
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,166
-Take her.

341
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,583
Vi?

342
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:18,833
No!
