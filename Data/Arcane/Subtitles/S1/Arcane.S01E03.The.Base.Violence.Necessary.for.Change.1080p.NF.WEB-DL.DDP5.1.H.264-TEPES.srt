1
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,458
<i>Ever wonder
what it's like to drown?</i>

2
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,458
<i>Story of opposites.</i>

3
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,083
<i>There's peace in water.</i>

4
00:00:55,958 --> 00:01:01,458
<i>Like it's holdin' you,
whisperin' in low tones to let it in.</i>

5
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,166
<i>And every problem in the world
will fade away.</i>

6
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,916
<i>But then there's this thing...</i>

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,500
<i>...in your head, and it's raging.</i>

8
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,083
<i>Lighting every nerve with madness.</i>

9
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,958
<i>To fight.</i>

10
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,291
<i>To survive.</i>

11
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,458
<i>And all the while,
this question lingers before you:</i>

12
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,166
<i>"Have you had enough?"</i>

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,791
<i>It's funny. You could pass a lifetime
without ever facing a choice like that.</i>

14
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,500
<i>But it changes you forever.</i>

15
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,500
<i>For that, I thank you...</i>

16
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,125
<i>old friend.</i>

00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,666

33
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,750
Vander?

34
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,791
We don't have much time.

35
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,000
How did you find me?

36
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,958
I'm proud of you. Always have been.

37
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,291
I'm sorry, I... This is the only way
to protect the others.

38
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,833
Vander.

39
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,375
You've got a good heart.
Don't ever lose it.

40
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,000
No matter how the world
tries to break you.

41
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,958
Protect the family.

42
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,250
What are you...

43
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,541
No.

44
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,123
Vander.

45
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,125
Let me out. This isn't right.

46
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,688
I'm guessing that's for me.

47
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,041
You gonna let us make the arrest or not?

48
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:15,166
You'll oblige a doomed man one last smoke.

49
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,458
Won't you?

50
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,291
I'm not putting you away, Vander.

51
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,583
The Council needs its pound of flesh.

52
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,958
Without you down here, it all falls apart.

53
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,416
Benzo will handle things.

54
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:41,250
I may not have my devilish charm,
but he runs a tight ship.

55
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,416
Vander, no. You can't do this.

56
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,750
You won't be coming back for a long time.

57
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,208
I know.

58
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,958
- Why?
- Mm.

59
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,083
It's the only way.

60
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,541
Benzo, open the damn door.

61
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,500
What's happening?

62
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,875
Hey. Stop right there!

63
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,750
What the devil...

64
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,375
No.

65
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,166
Silco?

66
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:55,000
You animal. Go crawl back
into whatever hole you came out of.

67
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,250
Benzo, stay back.

68
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,250
You never did know when to walk away.

69
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,708
Wait.

70
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,041
No!

71
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,750
Hmm. Stubborn to the end.

72
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,791
What the hell have you done?
This wasn't the deal!

73
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,916
Deal's changed.

74
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,375
No.

75
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,958
No!

76
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,458
This entire time, I thought
I needed to dampen the oscillations.

77
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,250
The crystals will only stabilize
at high frequency.

78
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,833
- You have to...
- Crank it.

79
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,583
Yes. Yes. You have to... crank it.

80
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,833
- It works.
- Eh... On paper.

81
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,333
Well, we could test it
if we had access to my equipment.

82
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,250
Which is being destroyed tomorrow.

83
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,791
- What?
- Oh. I... Yeah. I, I meant to tell you.

84
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,958
That research is everything.
My... my whole life.

85
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,892
Maybe if we showed them the equations,

86
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,101
- they'd let us...
- We need more than promises.

87
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,041
We need proof.

88
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,625
Not without the crystals.
The enforcers took them all. They're gone.

89
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,041
Yeah. Locked away in Heimerdinger's lab.

90
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,750
No. No. No. You heard the Council.
If we're wrong...

91
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,166
Better be right then.

92
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,166
Why? Why would you risk this?

93
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,500
Do you think it was my life's ambition
to be an assistant?

94
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,000
Scientists seek discoveries.

95
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,958
Ways to make the world a better place.

96
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,958
This Hextech dream of yours
has the potential to do that.

97
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,708
Our Hextech dream.

98
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,708
I saw everything.

99
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,625
Be... Benzo. They...

100
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,791
What about Vander?

101
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,375
They took him.

102
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,750
Where?

103
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,750
It's a little crude, I'll admit.

104
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,875
The base violence necessary for change.

105
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,083
But we both know
topside won't listen to anything else.

106
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:03,500
Even with your monsters,
you won't win a war against Piltover.

107
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,500
I don't have to.
I just need to scare them.

108
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,000
They won't dare set foot
in the underground again.

109
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,625
You'll get people killed. For what? Pride?

110
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,916
For respect.

111
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,208
Opportunity. Everything they've denied us.

112
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,000
You had my respect.

113
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,125
The Lanes' respect, but that...
that was never enough for you.

114
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:32,791
We shared a vision, Vander.
A dream of freedom.

115
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:38,625
Not just for the Lanes, but the whole
of the underground, united as one.

116
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,125
The nation of Zaun.

117
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,875
Do you even remember?

118
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,791
I trusted you.

119
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,625
And you betrayed me.

120
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,458
What I did to you...

121
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,291
I've never forgiven myself.
You were my brother.

122
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,458
No, you still don't understand.

123
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,916
Can you imagine what it's like?

124
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,125
<i>When your blood mixes with the filth</i>

125
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,541
<i>and the river toxins
eat through your nerves.</i>

126
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,041
<i>Oh, I hated you for what you'd done.</i>

127
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:30,416
<i>But as time passed, so did my hate.</i>

128
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,500
And I was left with an understanding.

129
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:40,083
The only way to defeat a superior enemy
is to stop at nothing.

130
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,291
To become what they fear.

131
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,333
I hated you, but you kept my respect.

132
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,708
Until you made peace with them.

133
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,916
Played lapdog
after everything we suffered.

134
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,041
I had no choice.

135
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,250
Perhaps.

136
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,208
But now you do.

137
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,458
Shimmer. We have the power.

138
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,500
We can finally realize our dream,

139
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,916
brother.

140
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,041
Look at what you've done.

141
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,416
Benzo. These kids.

142
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,916
In fighting topside,
you'd sacrifice everything that we are.

143
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,166
It's not the way. Can't you see that?

144
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:33,791
Kill me if you have to,
but please spare the Lanes.

145
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,416
You'd die for the cause,
but you won't fight for one?

146
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,291
I'm just... not that man anymore.

147
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,333
I'll show you what you really are.

148
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,000
Hmm.

149
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,375
So far, so good.

150
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,375
Hmm. Willing to risk exile
for your endeavor.

151
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,875
That's quite the conviction.

152
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:33,791
Councilor.

153
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,059
- What a surprise to see you, huh?
- Wait a minute, this isn't my bedroom.

154
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,083
How could I have...

155
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,000
Please. We can prove that it works.

156
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,458
Hmm. You couldn't do so earlier today,
how is tonight any different?

157
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,291
We figured out how to stabilize it.

158
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,458
You're the Professor's assistant.

159
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,583
No, he's my new partner.

160
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,083
Even if you manage to prove your theory,
the Council would destroy it.

161
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,875
Heimerdinger will recognize the potential.

162
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,625
He already does.

163
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,291
It scares him. It scares them all.

164
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,375
What about you?

165
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:10,041
I recognize that any worthwhile venture
involves risk.

166
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,000
Councilor, this technology, it's real.

167
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,958
And no matter what happens here,
it's going to change our world.

168
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,875
We should be the ones to lead it.

169
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,083
Piltover, the land of progress,
equality, innovation.

170
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,708
I know it sounds impossible,
but when have we ever let that stop us?

171
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,250
Please, just give us a chance.

172
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:49,458
One night, gentlemen. Impress me,
or I'd suggest you pack your bags.

173
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,083
Harold.

174
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,958
Oh. Oh.

175
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,291
Oh, Councilor Medarda,
you... you nearly scared me to death.

176
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,750
Ah. Another late night.
The work just doesn't end.

177
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,416
Well, I suppose that's a sign
of good business, huh?

178
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,375
Well, if the enforcers hit tonight,
we'll be ready...

179
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,226
- I think.
- Dibs on the bat.

180
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,726
- No, no, no, no. I found it.
- But I called it.

181
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,642
- But I found it.
- Respect the dibs.

182
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,684
- I called it already.
- Respect the...

183
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,958
Stop being such a big baby.

184
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,083
Vi?

185
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,184
- Where's the...
- Oh, you're back.

186
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,000
Hey. Those are Vander's.
Slow down. What's going on?

187
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,375
- Benzo's dead.
- Dead?

188
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,500
- They took Vander.
- Who took Vander?

189
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,583
I don't know. But I need to help him.

190
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,708
We're going with you.

191
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,208
Whatever killed Benzo...
was like nothing I've ever seen.

192
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,916
It tore him apart.

193
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,333
You're not doing this alone, Vi.

194
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,875
He's our father too.

195
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,958
Do we know where they took him?

196
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,416
Ekko followed them.

197
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,541
The old cannery next to the docks.
He said...

198
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,000
I need you to sit this one out, Powder.

199
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,541
What?

200
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,666
- You're not coming.
- I'm not afraid.

201
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,625
It's too dangerous.

202
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,291
But families stick together.
You said it yourself.

203
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,708
- I know what I said...
- I want to fight. I can help.

204
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,041
You're not ready.

205
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,916
You're all I have left.

206
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,375
I can't lose you.

207
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,416
Here. If they come for you,
take this and run.

208
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,083
Where ever you are, light it up,
and I'll find you. I promise.

209
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,708
It's all here.

210
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,583
It's time to crank it.

211
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,291
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

212
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,750
I don't think it's gonna hold!
Look at the buildup!

213
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,916
The resonance will stabilize it.

214
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,708
Trust me.

215
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,166
Hey, you seeing this?

216
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,250
I can help them.

217
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,958
Let's get Vander and get out.

218
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,833
I told you it would work.

219
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,333
All yours.

220
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,375
Wow.

221
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,000
It's never done that before.

222
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,916
All right. Here we go.

223
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,333
Disengage!

224
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,333
Incredible.

225
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,041
Vi.

226
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,791
What are you doing here?

227
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,625
We're breakin' you out.

228
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,750
- Mylo.
- On it.

229
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,166
How... how did you get in?

230
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,125
There's guards everywhere.

231
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,666
It was easy. We found an open window and...

232
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,208
Oh, god.

233
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,291
You have to get out. Now.

234
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,375
Welcome.

235
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,250
You have my congratulations.

236
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,500
But I'm afraid
this will be a very short reunion.

237
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,500
Hmm.

238
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,375
Have you heard the rumor?

239
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Vander the coward
fled town with his children.

240
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,125
And they were never seen again.

241
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,101
Claggor, see if you can find
another way out of here.

242
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,166
Okay.

243
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,500
You don't have to do this.

244
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,666
Yes, I do.

245
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,333
Vi.

246
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,625
Mylo.

247
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,166
Take a breath. You can do this.

248
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,541
We're gonna get you out.

249
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,458
Ready to rise to the surface?

250
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,208
Mylo, hurry.

251
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:30,875
Vi.

252
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,750
Silco. Let her go.

253
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,708
This is between you and me.

254
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,083
You had your chance.

255
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,708
Vi.

256
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,833
You did good.

257
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,416
- Open up.
- Stop this lunacy at once.

258
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,059
- They're almost through. No pressure.
- Open the door.

259
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,666
That sounds like pressure!

260
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,250
Open it.

261
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,500
Excuse me. Underfoot.

262
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,291
You've actually done it.

263
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:32,750
But just because it can be done,
doesn't mean...

264
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,958
Will you please stop hovering?

265
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,208
I'm not sure how to do that, sir.

266
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,458
This is not what Piltover's future
looks like, my dear boys.

267
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:47,541
That's for the Council to decide.

268
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,625
Perhaps it's time.

269
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,250
For the era of magic.

270
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,583
Uh, Hextech. For the era of Hextech.

271
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:16,041
You have to work. For me. Okay?

272
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:14,708
Kill them.

273
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,583
I knew you still had it in you.

274
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,625
Find the girl.

275
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,125
Silco!

276
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,958
Vander.

277
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,833
Vander...

278
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,958
Take care of Powder.

279
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,166
No!

280
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,166
Vi, it worked.

281
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,083
- What?
- Did you see me?

282
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,875
My monkey bomb finally worked.

283
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:20,833
You did this?

284
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,375
Why?

285
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,041
Why did you do this?

286
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,375
I... I didn't...

287
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,250
I was saving you.

288
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,250
I only wanted to help.

289
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,250
I only wanted to help.
I only wanted to help.

290
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,833
- I only wanted to...
- I told you to stay away.

291
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:52,250
- Please. Please. Please...
- I told you to stay away!

292
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,708
No. Why did you leave me?

293
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:59,666
Because you're a jinx. Do you hear me?
Mylo was right.

294
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,208
No. No. No. No. Violet, please.

295
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,708
Violet, please.

296
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,541
Vi! Vi, come back!
Please come back!

297
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,875
Please, Violet. I need you. Please.

298
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,208
Violet...

299
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,250
Violet. Please.

300
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:21,083
Powder.

301
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:23,125
- Pow...
- Shh.

302
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,726
He'll kill you if he hears you.

303
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,666
Come on. Let's go.

304
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:51,416
Hello, little girl.

305
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,166
Where's your sister?

306
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,375
She left me.

307
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,916
She is not my sister anymore.

308
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:41,750
It's okay.

309
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,875
We'll show them.

310
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,166
