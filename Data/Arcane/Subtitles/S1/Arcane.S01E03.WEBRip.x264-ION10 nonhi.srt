1
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,458
Ever wonder
what it's like to drown?

2
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,458
Story of opposites.

3
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:55,083
There's peace in water.

4
00:00:55,958 --> 00:01:01,458
Like it's holdin' you,
whisperin' in low tones to let it in.

5
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:07,166
And every problem in the world
will fade away.

6
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,916
-But then there's this thing…

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,500
…in your head, and it's raging.

8
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:25,083
Lighting every nerve with madness.

9
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,958
-To fight.

10
00:01:27,916 --> 00:01:30,291
-To survive.

11
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,458
And all the while,
this question lingers before you:

12
00:01:37,666 --> 00:01:39,166
"Have you had enough?"

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,791
It's funny. You could pass a lifetime
without ever facing a choice like that.

14
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,500
But it changes you forever.

15
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:53,500
For that, I thank you…

16
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,125
old friend.

17
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,750
Vander?

18
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,791
We don't have much time.

19
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,000
How did you find me?

20
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,958
I'm proud of you. Always have been.

21
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:37,291
I'm sorry, I… This is the only way
to protect the others.

22
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,833
-Vander.

23
00:03:39,541 --> 00:03:42,375
You've got a good heart.
Don't ever lose it.

24
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,000
No matter how the world
tries to break you.

25
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:46,958
Protect the family.

26
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,250
What are you--

27
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:51,541
No.

28
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,083
-Vander.

29
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,125
-Let me out. This isn't right.

30
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,666
I'm guessing that's for me.

31
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,041
You gonna let us make the arrest or not?

32
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:15,166
You'll oblige a doomed man one last smoke.

33
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:21,458
Won't you?

34
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,291
I'm not putting you away, Vander.

35
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,583
The Council needs its pound of flesh.

36
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,958
Without you down here, it all falls apart.

37
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,416
Benzo will handle things.

38
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:41,250
I may not have my devilish charm,
but he runs a tight ship.

39
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:44,416
Vander, no. You can't do this.

40
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,750
You won't be coming back for a long time.

41
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,208
-I know.

42
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,958
-Why?
-Mm.

43
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,083
-It's the only way.

44
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:59,541
-Benzo, open the damn door.

45
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,500
What's happening?

46
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,875
Hey. Stop right there!

47
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,750
What the devil…

48
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:32,291
No.

49
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:49,166
Silco?

50
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:55,000
You animal. Go crawl back
into whatever hole you came out of.

51
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:56,250
Benzo, stay back.

52
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:59,250
You never did know when to walk away.

53
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,708
-Wait.

54
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,041
No!

55
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,750
Hmm. Stubborn to the end.

56
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,791
What the hell have you done?
This wasn't the deal!

57
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,916
Deal's changed.

58
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,375
No.

59
00:06:34,958 --> 00:06:35,833
No!

60
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,458
This entire time, I thought
I needed to dampen the oscillations.

61
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:32,250
The crystals will only stabilize
at high frequency.

62
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,833
-You have to--
-Crank it.

63
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,583
Yes. Yes. You have to… crank it.

64
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,833
-It works.
-Eh… On paper.

65
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,333
Well, we could test it
if we had access to my equipment.

66
00:07:43,416 --> 00:07:45,250
Which is being destroyed tomorrow.

67
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,791
-What?
-Oh. I… Yeah. I, I meant to tell you.

68
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:53,958
That research is everything.
My… my whole life.

69
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:55,833
Maybe if we showed them the equations,

70
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:58,041
-they'd let us--
-We need more than promises.

71
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,041
We need proof.

72
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:02,625
Not without the crystals.
The enforcers took them all. They're gone.

73
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,041
Yeah. Locked away in Heimerdinger's lab.

74
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,750
No. No. No. You heard the Council.
If we're wrong…

75
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,166
Better be right then.

76
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,166
Why? Why would you risk this?

77
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:19,500
Do you think it was my life's ambition
to be an assistant?

78
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:22,000
Scientists seek discoveries.

79
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,958
Ways to make the world a better place.

80
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,958
This Hextech dream of yours
has the potential to do that.

81
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,708
Our Hextech dream.

82
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,708
I saw everything.

83
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,625
Be… Benzo. They…

84
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,791
What about Vander?

85
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,375
They took him.

86
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,750
-Where?

87
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,750
It's a little crude, I'll admit.

88
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,875
The base violence necessary for change.

89
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,083
But we both know
topside won't listen to anything else.

90
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:03,500
Even with your monsters,
you won't win a war against Piltover.

91
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:07,500
I don't have to.
I just need to scare them.

92
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:11,000
They won't dare set foot
in the underground again.

93
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:15,625
You'll get people killed. For what? Pride?

94
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,916
For respect.

95
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,208
Opportunity. Everything they've denied us.

96
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:25,000
You had my respect.

97
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,125
The Lanes' respect, but that…
that was never enough for you.

98
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:32,791
We shared a vision, Vander.
A dream of freedom.

99
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:38,625
Not just for the Lanes, but the whole
of the underground, united as one.

100
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,125
The nation of Zaun.

101
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:45,875
Do you even remember?

102
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:48,791
I trusted you.

103
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,625
And you betrayed me.

104
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,458
What I did to you…

105
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,291
I've never forgiven myself.
You were my brother.

106
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,458
No, you still don't understand.

107
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:13,916
Can you imagine what it's like?

108
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,125
When your blood mixes with the filth

109
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:20,541
and the river toxins
eat through your nerves.

110
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,041
Oh, I hated you for what you'd done.

111
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:30,416
But as time passed, so did my hate.

112
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,500
And I was left with an understanding.

113
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:40,083
The only way to defeat a superior enemy
is to stop at nothing.

114
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,291
To become what they fear.

115
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:48,333
I hated you, but you kept my respect.

116
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,708
Until you made peace with them.

117
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:54,916
Played lapdog
after everything we suffered.

118
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:58,041
I had no choice.

119
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,250
Perhaps.

120
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,166
But now you do.

121
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:05,458
Shimmer. We have the power.

122
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:08,500
We can finally realize our dream,

123
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,916
brother.

124
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,041
Look at what you've done.

125
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,416
Benzo. These kids.

126
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:22,916
In fighting topside,
you'd sacrifice everything that we are.

127
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,166
It's not the way. Can't you see that?

128
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:33,791
Kill me if you have to,
but please spare the Lanes.

129
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:38,416
You'd die for the cause,
but you won't fight for one?

130
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,291
I'm just… not that man anymore.

131
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,333
I'll show you what you really are.

132
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,000
Hmm.

133
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:25,375
So far, so good.

134
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:31,375
Hmm. Willing to risk exile
for your endeavor.

135
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,875
That's quite the conviction.

136
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:33,791
Councilor.

137
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:36,000
-What a surprise to see you, huh?
-Wait a minute, this isn't my bedroom.

138
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:36,916
How could I have…

139
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,000
Please. We can prove that it works.

140
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,458
Hmm. You couldn't do so earlier today,
how is tonight any different?

141
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,291
We figured out how to stabilize it.

142
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,458
You're the Professor's assistant.

143
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,583
No, he's my new partner.

144
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,083
Even if you manage to prove your theory,
the Council would destroy it.

145
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:59,875
Heimerdinger will recognize the potential.

146
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,625
He already does.

147
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,291
It scares him. It scares them all.

148
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,333
What about you?

149
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:10,041
I recognize that any worthwhile venture
involves risk.

150
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:23,000
Councilor, this technology, it's real.

151
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,958
And no matter what happens here,
it's going to change our world.

152
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,875
We should be the ones to lead it.

153
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,083
Piltover, the land of progress,
equality, innovation.

154
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,708
I know it sounds impossible,
but when have we ever let that stop us?

155
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:39,250
Please, just give us a chance.

156
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:49,458
One night, gentlemen. Impress me,
or I'd suggest you pack your bags.

157
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,083
-Harold.

158
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,958
Oh. Oh.

159
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:58,291
Oh, Councilor Medarda,
you… you nearly scared me to death.

160
00:14:58,375 --> 00:15:01,750
Ah. Another late night.
The work just doesn't end.

161
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,416
Well, I suppose that's a sign
of good business, huh?

162
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,375
Well, if the enforcers hit tonight,
we'll be ready…

163
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,166
-I think.
-Dibs on the bat.

164
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,666
-No, no, no, no. I found it.
-But I called it.

165
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,583
-But I found it.
-Respect the dibs.

166
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,625
-I called it already.
-Respect the…

167
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:26,958
-Stop being such a big baby.

168
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,083
Vi?

169
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:30,125
-Where's the--
-Oh, you're back.

170
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:43,000
Hey. Those are Vander's.
Slow down. What's going on?

171
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,375
-Benzo's dead.
-Dead?

172
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,500
-They took Vander.
-Who took Vander?

173
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,583
I don't know. But I need to help him.

174
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:51,708
We're going with you.

175
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,208
Whatever killed Benzo…
was like nothing I've ever seen.

176
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,916
It tore him apart.

177
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,333
You're not doing this alone, Vi.

178
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,875
He's our father too.

179
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,958
Do we know where they took him?

180
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,416
Ekko followed them.

181
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,541
The old cannery next to the docks.
He said…

182
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,000
I need you to sit this one out, Powder.

183
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,541
What?

184
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,666
-You're not coming.
-I'm not afraid.

185
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,625
It's too dangerous.

186
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,291
But families stick together.
You said it yourself.

187
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,708
-I know what I said…
-I want to fight. I can help.

188
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,041
You're not ready.

189
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,916
You're all I have left.

190
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,375
I can't lose you.

191
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:48,416
Here. If they come for you,
take this and run.

192
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,083
Where ever you are, light it up,
and I'll find you. I promise.

193
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:14,708
It's all here.

194
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:28,583
It's time to crank it.

195
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,291
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

196
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,750
I don't think it's gonna hold!
Look at the buildup!

197
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,916
The resonance will stabilize it.

198
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,708
Trust me.

199
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,166
Hey, you seeing this?

200
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,250
I can help them.

201
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,958
Let's get Vander and get out.

202
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,833
I told you it would work.

203
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,333
All yours.

204
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,375
Wow.

205
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,000
It's never done that before.

206
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,916
All right. Here we go.

207
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:40,333
Disengage!

208
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,333
Incredible.

209
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,041
-Vi.

210
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,791
What are you doing here?

211
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,625
We're breakin' you out.

212
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,750
-Mylo.
-On it.

213
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:41,166
-How… how did you get in?

214
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,125
There's guards everywhere.

215
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,666
It was easy. We found an open window and…

216
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,208
Oh, god.

217
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:52,291
You have to get out. Now.

218
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:53,291
Welcome.

219
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:06,250
You have my congratulations.

220
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,500
But I'm afraid
this will be a very short reunion.

221
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,500
Hmm.

222
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,375
Have you heard the rumor?

223
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
Vander the coward
fled town with his children.

224
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,125
And they were never seen again.

225
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,041
Claggor, see if you can find
another way out of here.

226
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,166
Okay.

227
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,500
You don't have to do this.

228
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,666
Yes, I do.

229
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,208
Vi.

230
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,458
Mylo.

231
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,166
Take a breath. You can do this.

232
00:23:07,666 --> 00:23:09,541
We're gonna get you out.

233
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,458
Ready to rise to the surface?

234
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,208
Mylo, hurry.

235
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:30,875
Vi.

236
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:34,750
Silco. Let her go.

237
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,708
This is between you and me.

238
00:24:36,791 --> 00:24:38,083
You had your chance.

239
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:53,708
-Vi.

240
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,833
You did good.

241
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:23,416
-Open up.
-Stop this lunacy at once.

242
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,000
-They're almost through. No pressure.
-Open the door.

243
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,666
That sounds like pressure!

244
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:35,250
Open it.

245
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,500
Excuse me. Underfoot.

246
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,291
You've actually done it.

247
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:32,750
But just because it can be done,
doesn't mean…

248
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:34,958
Will you please stop hovering?

249
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,208
I'm not sure how to do that, sir.

250
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,458
This is not what Piltover's future
looks like, my dear boys.

251
00:26:45,416 --> 00:26:47,541
That's for the Council to decide.

252
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:51,625
Perhaps it's time.

253
00:26:52,541 --> 00:26:54,250
For the era of magic.

254
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:57,583
Uh, Hextech. For the era of Hextech.

255
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:16,041
-You have to work. For me. Okay?

256
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:14,708
Kill them.

257
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:38,583
I knew you still had it in you.

258
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,625
Find the girl.

259
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,125
Silco!

260
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,958
Vander.

261
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:38,833
-Vander…

262
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,958
Take care of Powder.

263
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,125
No!

264
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:13,166
Vi, it worked.

265
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,083
-What?
-Did you see me?

266
00:35:15,166 --> 00:35:17,875
My monkey bomb finally worked.

267
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:20,833
You did this?

268
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:30,291
Why?

269
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,000
Why did you do this?

270
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:34,375
I… I didn't…

271
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,250
I was saving you.

272
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,250
I only wanted to help.

273
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:46,250
I only wanted to help.
I only wanted to help.

274
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:48,833
-I only wanted to--
-I told you to stay away.

275
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:52,250
-Please. Please. Please--
-I told you to stay away!

276
00:35:53,083 --> 00:35:55,708
No. Why did you leave me?

277
00:35:55,791 --> 00:35:59,666
Because you're a jinx. Do you hear me?
Mylo was right.

278
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,208
No. No. No. No. Violet, please.

279
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:17,708
Violet, please.

280
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,541
Vi! Vi, come back!
Please come back!

281
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:33,875
Please, Violet. I need you. Please.

282
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,208
Violet…

283
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,250
Violet. Please.

284
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:20,958
Powder.

285
00:37:21,666 --> 00:37:23,125
-Pow--
-Shh.

286
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,666
-He'll kill you if he hears you.

287
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,666
Come on. Let's go.

288
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:51,416
Hello, little girl.

289
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:54,166
Where's your sister?

290
00:38:08,125 --> 00:38:09,375
She left me.

291
00:38:16,833 --> 00:38:20,916
She is not my sister anymore.

292
00:38:40,458 --> 00:38:41,750
It's okay.

293
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,875
We'll show them.

294
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,166
We will show them all.
