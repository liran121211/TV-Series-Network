1
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:33,892
- You wanted to see me, Professor?
- Ah. Come in, Jayce.

2
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:35,892
Can you believe it?

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,625
Our city is about to turn 200 years old.

4
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:41,041
A bicentennial.

5
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:45,500
It's shaping up
to be an amazing Progress Day.

6
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:54,083
"Stanwick Padidly"?
Huh, I don't know much about him.

7
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,916
Everything he built either exploded,
melted, or toppled over.

8
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:00,708
And yet, here he stands.

9
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:05,208
Stanwick set his personal ambitions aside

10
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:07,833
and focused on something
far more important.

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,625
Our future.

12
00:01:10,125 --> 00:01:12,375
He realized nothing he could accomplish

13
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,291
could compare to the contributions
of his students.

14
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,041
I had no idea.

15
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,500
That was his sacrifice.

16
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,333
A dear friend.

17
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:28,041
The Council has recommended you give
the Progress Day speech this year.

18
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:31,041
What... But you always give that speech.

19
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,583
I... I could never take your place.

20
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,666
I agree with them.

21
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,750
Your Hexgates have done wonders
for our city.

22
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:44,125
Brought scholars from distant lands.
Reignited passions in arts and science.

23
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:46,458
You deserve this honor.

24
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:52,416
I... I will do my best
to make Piltover proud, Professor.

25
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,140
It's short notice, I know,

26
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:58,083
but perhaps there's something in the lab
you might be able to share?

27
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,916
People love a grand reveal.

28
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,666
Viktor and I have just the thing.
The next chapter of Hextech.

29
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,708
Come to the lab this afternoon,
I'll show you.

30
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,291
I'll look forward to it.

31
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,708
You certainly have something
to live up to, my boy.

32
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,791

<i>Happy Progress Day.
Happy Progress Day.</i>

49
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:36,083
Our most famous protégé, Jayce Talis.

50
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,958
The visionary behind the Hexgates,

51
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:43,041
a beacon of trade and prosperity
for our great City of Progress.

52
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,125
Excuse me.

53
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,541
Sorry, sorry. Yeah. Excuse me.

54
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,916
He's a very busy man.

55
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,916
- Cait.
- Serves you right.

56
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,291
You still avoiding her?

57
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:03,375
I'm working.

58
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,750
Oh, I can see that.

59
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:08,583
I mean, there's so much crime
to thwart outside your family's tent.

60
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:12,125
I can only imagine the strings she pulled
to have me posted here.

61
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,625
It's your fault really,

62
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,583
for not following her into a career
"more befitting your station."

63
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,458
She'd do anything to keep me
from seeing the real world.

64
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,791
Well, at least you'll have front-row seats
to the speech.

65
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,708
Speech?

66
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,166
Mm-hmm.
I'm giving the big address tonight.

67
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,500
Hmm. We really have descended to anarchy.

68
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:32,625
Have fun herding the drunkards.

69
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,791
Happy Progress Day.

70
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,333
Uh, shipping manifest?

71
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,541
From your friend. Downtown.

72
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,125
Let's go!

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,666
Ah, shit. The Firelights.

74
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,891
We have five minutes
till they're out of there.

75
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,748
You ever seen
this much Shimmer before?

76
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,291
They're expanding.
Check for more below. Burn it all.

77
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:33,125
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Open up.

78
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,375
Open the door.

79
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,833
Oh, no. She's here.

80
00:08:23,166 --> 00:08:24,166
What the...

81
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,750
Hi.

82
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Vi?

83
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,541
I can't lose you.

84
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,041
Why did you leave me?

85
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,375
<i>Because you're a jinx.</i>

86
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,623
<i>- I want to fight.
- You're not ready.</i>

87
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,250
No.

88
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,500
You were supposed to guard the cargo.

89
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,958
You think he will approve?

90
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,851
Heimerdinger believes
science should be used

91
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,583
to improve lives as much as we do.

92
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,125
We just need to show him it's safe.

93
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,875
And what about the Council?

94
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,375
We stabilized the crystal like they asked.

95
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,416
Built the Hexgates like they asked.

96
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:27,375
It's our turn to decide
the future of Hextech.

97
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,083
Professor. I'm so glad you could make it.

98
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:36,125
Wouldn't miss it for the world, my boy.
What do we have on the docket?

99
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,500
It all began with this.

100
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,458
A crystal of magical energy,

101
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:47,375
too volatile to be handled
outside our workshops.

102
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,583
Hextech was supposed to bring magic
into the life of the common man.

103
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:54,000
And now, it finally can.

104
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,708
A Hextech Gemstone.

105
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,958
Wait.

106
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,875
Holy sprockets.

107
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,000
We've found a means
to fortify the crystals.

108
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:27,208
This new version is stable
and absolutely safe.

109
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:34,041
We present to you
the next chapter of Hextech.

110
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,458
We can now design portable devices.

111
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,708
Oh...

112
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,083
The Gemstone can power virtually anything.

113
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,416
The Atlas Gauntlets.

114
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,875
The mining colonies in the fissures
can work faster and without fatigue.

115
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,666
The Hex Claw.

116
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,250
A mechanical arm,
equipped with a powerful ray of light.

117
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:31,583
Imagine what our artificers could do
with such a device.

118
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:35,500
I want Hextech to be a tool
for us to build a new world.

119
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:38,833
And now, it's finally possible.

120
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:46,166
Anyway, this is our presentation.

121
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,541
Quite amazing, gentlemen.
You should be very proud.

122
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:55,333
Obviously, there are a few kinks
to iron out and screws to be tightened,

123
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:59,416
but give it a decade of careful research,
and it will be ready.

124
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,666
A decade?

125
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:04,666
Oh, don't worry, my boy.
It zips past you in the blink of an eye.

126
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,541
With respect, Professor.

127
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:09,541
We can be improving lives
with Hextech now.

128
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,250
A breakthrough like this
takes time, Viktor.

129
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,416
Putting that kind of power
into everyone's hands is dangerous.

130
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,958
Keep at it and I'm sure
you will discover a way

131
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,791
to safeguard Hextech against misuse.

132
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:37,625
There must've been four, five of them.
I don't know how they got inside.

133
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:55,875
You're from the undercity.

134
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,833
I didn't do anything. She's crazy.

135
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,041
Easy.

136
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,333
She shot me.

137
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,875
Who shot you? Who were you working for?

138
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,583
- I can't. He'll kill me.
- Who?

139
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,291
I can protect you.

140
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,083
Caitlyn Kiramman,
why does that not surprise me?

141
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,000
Interfering in an investigation, again.

142
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,125
You're supposed to be guarding
your mother's tent.

143
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:28,041
I was, Sheriff, but she doesn't need it.
And clearly, this takes priority.

144
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:30,333
I realize you're used
to getting your way, Kiramman,

145
00:16:30,416 --> 00:16:32,291
but we have a chain of command
for a reason.

146
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,958
I understand.

147
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,666
But there's more going on here
than just the smuggling.

148
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,750
- If I could just question him I could...
- I'll take it from here.

149
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,309
Since you're looking for more work,

150
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,666
you can take the graveyard shift tonight
at the fair.

151
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,666
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

152
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,125
I want this one on a boat
to Stillwater prison.

153
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,375
Yes, sir.

154
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,708
She fired on us.

155
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,291
There are always mishaps in battle.

156
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:42,291
The Firelights were her target
and most are dead.

157
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:46,958
It wasn't a mishap,
she froze up and lost her shit.

158
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,333
I could've handled those brats.

159
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:52,375
- She's a problem and we all know it.
- We?

160
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:54,958
Who's we?

161
00:17:57,625 --> 00:18:00,541
I expect better from you than excuses.

162
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:03,541
It was your job to make sure
things went smoothly.

163
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,958
You failed. Don't disappoint me again.

164
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:21,458
The world's growing smaller
every day, thanks to the Hexgates.

165
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,833
And now, we're cut off.

166
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,916
The topsiders are leaving us
further and further behind.

167
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,791
What happened?

168
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:31,791
She already told you.

169
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,583
I'm asking you.

170
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,958
One of those Firelight wackos
was a girl.

171
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,833
- With pink hair.
- Hmm...

172
00:18:52,625 --> 00:18:54,291
Your sister's gone.

173
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,000
You know that as well as I do.

174
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,250
I know. I know. Sisters, right?

175
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,500
You can't live with 'em, can't stuff
'em back in the ol' babymaker.

176
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:08,291
Today's screw-up will set us back weeks.

177
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:11,750
I'm sorry.

178
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,500
- I need to know that I can rely on you.
- Phew.

179
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,458
I'm doing this for us, Jinx. All of us.

180
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:24,625
The sons and daughters of Zaun
deserve more than their runoff.

181
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,458
It won't happen again.

182
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
I know.

183
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,416
Sevika will clean up today's mess.

184
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,625
Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean
a dust bunny with a blowtorch.

185
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:51,000
She'll suffice.
You should focus on your gadgetry.

186
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,250
Ugh.

187
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Take some time.

188
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,666
I don't need time.

189
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,375
Take it anyhow.

190
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,958
Fundraiser's going well.

191
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:27,875
Your mother would be proud.

192
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,875
Hmm... Would she?

193
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:31,958
Tired of mingling?

194
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:35,458
Hmm. These people have nothing new
to offer me.

195
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,750
The only one actually worth my time
is him.

196
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:41,666
The golden boy.

197
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,125
Ah, he's won Piltover's heart.

198
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:47,500
Oh, speak of the devil.

199
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,446
Could I borrow you for a minute?

200
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,750
To what do I owe the pleasure?

201
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,291
It's Heimerdinger.

202
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,916
When is it not?

203
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,500
We've shown him our research.

204
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,750
He thinks we need more time.

205
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,291
It's Progress Day.

206
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,935
Representatives from all over the world

207
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,250
have come to see what new wonders
the City of Progress has to offer.

208
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:35,458
If there's a time to present
a new creation, it is now.

209
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,583
Great.

210
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:46,750
Heimerdinger is a great scientist.
But he's old. He only ever sees the past.

211
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:49,958
Piltover needs a leader who looks forward.

212
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:52,250
Someone like you.

213
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,916
You really believe that?

214
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:58,916
Hextech has the potential
to change everything.

215
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,333
The world is ready.

216
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,875
And I've already spoken
to several potential investors.

217
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:03,791
Investors?

218
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,083
Of course.

219
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,375
Everyone wants Hextech for themselves.

220
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,875
It's your speech.

221
00:22:09,958 --> 00:22:12,500
Give the people a glimpse of the future.

222
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,291
It wasn't her.

223
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,291
It wasn't.

224
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:42,250
I know. Just...
just some wannabe street trash.

225
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:44,791
I got confused, that's all.

226
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,833
Now, he thinks I'm weak.

227
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,041
"Sevika will clean it up."

228
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:54,083
Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.

229
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,541
I'm not weak.

230
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:07,166
And I'm gonna show him.

231
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:10,458
Oh, I'm gonna show him. You'll see.

232
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:23,833
Where were you?

233
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:26,125
They were asking
if I could do the address.

234
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,458
You should come up with me.
We're partners.

235
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:32,500
No, no. Not in front of all of them...

236
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,291
You... have your speech prepared?

237
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,208
Uh-huh.

238
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,750
An inspiration
to Piltover's future

239
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:44,083
and that of all humanity.

240
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:48,500
Please join me in welcoming to the stage...

241
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,208
- Jayce Talis.
- Guess it's time.

242
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,333
Uh, good evening.

243
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,625
I know many of you probably didn't expect
to see me here today.

244
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,833
And believe me,
I'm just as shocked as you are.

245
00:24:47,166 --> 00:24:51,458
My family and I are simple people.
In our factory, we made hammers.

246
00:24:52,083 --> 00:24:55,083
They were probably used to cut the stones
you're standing on right now.

247
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:59,458
No one in my life
expected very much of me.

248
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:04,541
And that is precisely what makes
this moment so extraordinary.

249
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:08,791
A few years ago, the Hexgates
opened their ports to the world

250
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:13,500
and made Piltover prosper beyond anything
we could have ever imagined.

251
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,166
But... we're not done yet.

252
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,500
This year, we've created something new
for you.

253
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,916
Something that... um...

254
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,208
That we will share with you...

255
00:25:58,833 --> 00:25:59,916
...when the time is right.

256
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,416
Things that will bring an end
to your hardships.

257
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,916
Whether you're the scion
of our high houses,

258
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,208
or an honest laborer from the underground.

259
00:26:12,291 --> 00:26:15,916
We vow to keep pressing forward,
for we are the City of Progress.

260
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,875
And our future is bright.

261
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,000
That it, then?

262
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:50,625
I thought that Talis boy
was some kind of genius.

263
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:53,267
Last year, didn't he launch a blimp
halfway across the continent?

264
00:26:53,291 --> 00:26:54,625
Airship, actually.

265
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:58,916
An airship has a rigid metal hull.
It's not a blimp.

266
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,625
It's a balloon, ain't it?

267
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,583
Sure as hell looks that way.

268
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,375
Pardon us, if we aren't quite
so refined as you, milady.

269
00:27:08,291 --> 00:27:10,517
What are you
even doing here, Kiramman?

270
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,875
Don't you have a cocktail party to attend?

271
00:27:16,708 --> 00:27:17,708
Fire.

272
00:27:18,041 --> 00:27:19,291
Fire!

273
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,783
- What's happening?
- Get the fire brigade.

274
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:36,500
Help. In here, please. Help me.

275
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:49,000
Help. It's so hot, please. I'm trapped.

276
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,583
I'm a helpless little girl
and I've set the building on fire.

277
00:27:55,666 --> 00:27:59,125
By accident. Totally by accident.

278
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,125
Get out. Now.

279
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:11,541
Also, I brought this dynamite.
Goodbye.

280
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,583
<i>The Gemstone is gone.</i>

281
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,708
<i>Along with some of our research papers.</i>

282
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:53,208
<i>The situation is still developing.</i>

283
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,791
<i>No one in the undercity
has claimed responsibility yet.</i>

284
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,041
How did it come to this?

285
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:08,708
Hmm. For too long
has the underground been left unchecked.

286
00:29:08,791 --> 00:29:10,166
We've lost touch.

287
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,666
They may not be your preferred
constituents but they're still our people.

288
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,250
The undercity cannot be controlled.
Not by us.

289
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:20,208
So where does that leave us?

290
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,833
Mr. Talis?

291
00:29:22,916 --> 00:29:25,708
Could the trenchers build a weapon
with the stolen crystal?

292
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:27,666
Shimmer, body replacements...

293
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,541
We've seen their ingenuity
over the years, of course, they can.

294
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,875
If the right person got a hold of it,

295
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:39,708
it's possible
they could utilize its energy.

296
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,916
We need to address this immediately.

297
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:44,708
I agree.

298
00:29:45,291 --> 00:29:48,416
It was my responsibility
to safeguard this technology and I failed.

299
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,208
My mistake cost people their lives.

300
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:55,083
I have come before you to recommend
that we suspend all Hextech operations

301
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:56,833
until the situation is resolved.

302
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:00,875
Including our laboratories,
the refinery and the Hexgates.

303
00:30:00,958 --> 00:30:02,791
Have you lost your mind?

304
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:05,291
The Hexgates must remain open.

305
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:08,791
Piltover's status
as a global shipping lane depends on it.

306
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:10,875
Thousands would lose their income.

307
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:14,791
But shouldn't the safety of Piltover
be our first priority?

308
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:17,250
You would sacrifice your life's work?

309
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:21,875
Without the Hexgates, my goods
cannot reach foreign markets till winter.

310
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:23,708
Am I to tell the Noxians

311
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:26,375
their next shipment of wine
will be vinegar?

312
00:30:26,458 --> 00:30:29,375
Councilors.
It appears we are at an impasse.

313
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:33,416
If we shut down the Hexgates,
the city will suffer.

314
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,000
But if we do nothing,

315
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,416
we leave ourselves vulnerable
to malefactors.

316
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,416
More lives may be lost.

317
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:46,416
Perhaps the time has come
to explore a more radical solution.

318
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,125
What are you suggesting?

319
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:54,458
Mr. Talis has demonstrated
his commitment to our safety.

320
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:57,583
He's willing to sacrifice
his own enterprise.

321
00:30:57,666 --> 00:31:00,541
And it seems to me only Mr. Talis

322
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,625
has the knowledge necessary
to secure the Hexgates.

323
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:07,041
I propose that a new chair
be brought forth,

324
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:10,708
and that House Talis be elevated
to this august body.

325
00:31:10,791 --> 00:31:12,666
- What?
- As a Councilor,

326
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,416
he will have the resources
necessary to protect all our investments.

327
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,958
Councilor Medarda,
his is highly irregular.

328
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:24,083
The Council has held seven seats
for generations.

329
00:31:24,166 --> 00:31:26,583
Does the boy have any experience?

330
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:30,458
Only that of a scientist.
Like Heimerdinger.

331
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,416
I believe Councilor Medarda is right.

332
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,875
Hextech security should be
administered by a scientist.

333
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:44,958
I second the motion.

334
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:47,125
Well then, shall we vote?

335
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:56,416
<i>♪ Come and play ♪</i>

341

Jinx!

343
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,125
That's me.

344
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:21,250
Half a dozen enforcers, dead. Enforcers.
Dead.

345
00:32:21,333 --> 00:32:23,416
- Yeah...
- A building blown to pieces.

346
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,375
Oh, yeah.

347
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:30,208
Do you have any idea what you've done?

348
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:33,250
Actually, I do.

349
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,791
Happy Progress Day!

350
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,000
Hey.

351
00:33:13,583 --> 00:33:15,250
How are you feeling?

352
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,458
I've had a break in the case.

353
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:21,041
Shouldn't you be resting?

354
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,458
While the trail is hot?

355
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:24,791
Listen, you know how I've suspected

356
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:28,041
there is a single mind
behind the undercity's violence?

357
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,500
The great conspiracy.

358
00:33:29,583 --> 00:33:32,833
I think whoever attacked the square
is our suspect.

359
00:33:32,916 --> 00:33:36,375
The same symbols showed up at the botched
smuggling operation at the Hexgates.

360
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,958
- The Hexgates?
- Keep up.

361
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:41,583
All this time, they've kept their dealings
localized to the undercity.

362
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:45,166
Low priority.
The attack on the square changes things.

363
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,416
They've overstepped.

364
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,000
If I can figure who made this,

365
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,833
it could lead me directly
to whoever's behind it all.

366
00:33:50,916 --> 00:33:53,916
The answer is here,
staring me in the face.

367
00:33:54,875 --> 00:33:56,125
I can feel it.

368
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,250
How do you intend to prove any of this?

369
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:07,208
If I can just work this out.
Marcus will have to listen.

370
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,726
If there's one thing
I've learned about the Council,

371
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,291
they need more than just theories.

372
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,875
Since when did you concern yourself
with the Council's opinion?

373
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,416
Since I...

374
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,458
became a Councilor.

375
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:25,166
You're serious.

376
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,083
When? Why?

377
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,066
Have they discovered how to govern
with grease and a spanner?

378
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:37,041
Ha ha. I was actually hoping
you might consider joining my staff.

379
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:41,083
"House Talis Security."

380
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:45,541
That's a ceremonial position.
I'd live behind a desk.

381
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,541
You almost died, Cait.

382
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,791
I just... I just want you to be safe.

383
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,250
Thanks, but I already have a job.

384
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,125
No. You don't.

385
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,416
After the attack,
your parents spoke to the Sheriff.

386
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,750
This is the best I could do.

387
00:35:02,541 --> 00:35:06,500
I don't need charity, Councilor.
Yours or my parents'.

388
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:08,500
- Cait.
- Get out.

389
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,376
I need to speak
with one of the inmates.

390
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:44,416
Oh, folks in here
aren't usually very talkative.

391
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:47,000
This one was hit by friendly fire.

392
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:50,791
He's got reason to talk.
Must have been sent in today?

393
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:56,166
Oh. Inmate 2135.

394
00:35:56,916 --> 00:36:00,375
<i>Yeah, I'm, uh, afraid that's not possible.</i>

395
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,000
- Why not?
- Uh, well, there's been...

396
00:36:03,083 --> 00:36:05,541
<i>- an incident.
- What kind of incident?</i>

397
00:36:05,625 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>The...</i>

398
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,916
<i>...not so pretty kind.</i>

399
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,916
<i>You don't understand,
I have to talk to him.</i>

400
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:20,458
<i>Oh, you'll be able to.
As soon as he can move his jaw again.</i>

401
00:36:21,458 --> 00:36:22,578
<i>Who assaulted him?</i>

402
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,333
Who the hell are you?
