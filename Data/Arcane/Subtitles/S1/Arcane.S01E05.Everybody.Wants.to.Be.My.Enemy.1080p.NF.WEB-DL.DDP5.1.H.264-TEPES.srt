1
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:50,791
Hmm.

2
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,208
That was quite some shooting, Kiramman.

3
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,166
Did my parents pay you to let me win?

4
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,625
Hmm... That's a serious accusation.

5
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,041
You held your shot, I saw you.

6
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:57,583
The trophy is yours. You earned it.

7
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,083
You haven't answered my question.

8
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,041
No, your parents didn't pay me.

9
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,875
I just thought you deserved it.

10
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm an enforcer.

11
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:16,875
For me, knowing how to handle this weapon
means being able to protect people.

12
00:02:17,541 --> 00:02:21,375
To be of service to the city.
And that's trophy enough.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,208
Begs the question, young Kiramman.
What are you shooting for?

14
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,605
I took a look at your file.

15
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:42,125
There's no record of you or your crimes.
What are you here for?

16
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:43,708
My sunny personality.

17
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,208
You attacked an inmate. Why?

18
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:48,791
Why not?

19
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,000
He was a witness
in an ongoing investigation.

20
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,583
Hmm, bummer.

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,333
This was a waste of time.

22
00:02:56,416 --> 00:02:57,333
Couldn't have put it better.

23
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,625
Hey, give Silco a kiss
on that winning eye of his, will you?

24
00:03:03,666 --> 00:03:05,666
Silco? The industrialist?

25
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,833
Okay, this is getting old.

26
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:10,309
Can you just send in whoever's gonna kick
the shit out of me,

27
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,750
so I can get on with my night?

28
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:20,666
Does this mean anything to you?

29
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,958
Where did you get this?

30
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:34,583
- My question first. He worked for Silco?
- Uh, they all do.

31
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,916
How can anyone not know that?
Where did you find this?

32
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,416
There was an attack. This is evidence.

33
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:44,375
I need proof if I'm to believe
what you're saying about Silco.

34
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,958
I could get it for you.
Just not from in here.

35
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,000
In what mad world
would I trust someone like you?

36
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,666
Someone like me?

37
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,916
You enforcers are all the same.
Just asshole criminals in fancy uniforms.

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,791
You know what? Find Silco yourself.

39
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,250
I will, thank you.

40
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:06,666
Hmm... Undercity's gonna eat you alive.

41
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,625
I've got orders from Councilor Talis,
concerning Inmate 516.

42
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,333
Not cooperative, huh?

43
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:22,833
You, uh, you want us
to have a chat with her?

44
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,291
- No.
- Oh.

45
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,416
It's for her release.

46
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:30,833
Huh. Since when's he a Councilor?

47
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:32,541
Since today.

48
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,291
How many chats have you had with her?

49
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,166
You know, I never even thought to count.

50
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:24,500

66
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,166
These brave Enforcers
sacrificed their lives

67
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,416
to defend the values of our great city.

68
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
To some, they are mothers...

69
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,875
fathers, sons...

70
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,291
daughters...

71
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,791
but to all, they are heroes.

72
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:08,833
Who was this, Daddy?

73
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:16,625
A good woman.

74
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:25,666
You said you could control her.
I lost six officers. Six!

75
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:31,000
She pushed it too far this time.
The Council's up in arms.

76
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:35,083
I can't make this go away for you
unless you give me something to work with.

77
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:38,583
Arresting her would be doing you a favor.

78
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't need favors.

79
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,875
I need you to do your job.

80
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,583
The Firelights have been a thorn
in both our sides.

81
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:53,541
They ambushed my shipment at the Hexgates
on the same day as the attack.

82
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,666
It seems to me
the Council has its culprit.

83
00:07:58,666 --> 00:07:59,958
Oh, that's tidy for you.

84
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:03,041
What if I'm not interested
in playing along?

85
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:08,500
We've accomplished a lot together, Marcus.
Sheriff.

86
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,541
And there is more yet to achieve.

87
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,000
I hope you can remain a part of it.

88
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,833
For their families.
From an anonymous, concerned citizen.

89
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,541
Yesterday's smuggling fiasco was nothing.

90
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,541
These manifests are full of discrepancies,
dating back months.

91
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,625
This is a poor use of our time.

92
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm a Councilor now, Viktor.

93
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,958
It's my responsibility to make sure
the Hexgates are safe and protected.

94
00:08:55,041 --> 00:09:00,041
What about our pledge to improve lives,
for those in need? For the undercity?

95
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:05,000
Look, I'm sorry I didn't announce
our other projects in my speech.

96
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,208
- Soon, we can do everything we...
- Soon?

97
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:10,541
There are people
who need our help now, Jayce.

98
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,250
You wanted to see me?

99
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,430
Have your people ever reviewed these logs?

100
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,833
- Mr. Talis, I assure you...
- Councilor.

101
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:19,500
And the only assurance I need is that

102
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:22,041
you will search and seize
any unauthorized merchandise.

103
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,708
I've made a list
of suspicious transactions.

104
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:26,708
All due respect, Councilor,

105
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,541
- today's your first day...
- Second.

106
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:29,666
Right.

107
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,142
You sure you don't want to confer
with the other Councilors before...

108
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:34,416
This corruption runs deep, Sheriff.

109
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,166
I intend to root it out.

110
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,875
Have you made any progress
with the stolen Gemstone?

111
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,083
Yes. Chief suspect is an undercity gang.

112
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,767
They call themselves the Firelights.

113
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,250
They operate like phantoms,

114
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:50,125
doing hit-and-runs on civilians
and disappearing into the night.

115
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,708
- How soon till we track them down?
- I've got my best officers on it.

116
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,250
Viktor? You all right?

117
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:10,166
A... a headache. I just...
I need to get to the lab.

118
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,500
Boring...

119
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:23,875
Boring. Wow. Super boring...

120
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,166
Here we go!

121
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,541
It's all about these runes.

122
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:36,791
They form some kind of math-y,
magic-y gateway.

123
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:43,000
To the realm of heebie-jeebies.
And this... Turns it on.

124
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,541
So... here goes.

125
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,708
No!

126
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,541
No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.

127
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,668
I heard the bathysphere has a nice view.

128
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,041
That could be a good way
to get a lay of the land.

129
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:39,500
Too risky.

130
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,625
What...

131
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,250
Nice jacket.

132
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,333
Welcome to the Lanes.

133
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:14,791
You almost got me killed.

134
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,958
My little sister could do that
when she was seven.

135
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,458
All us fissure folk can.
Don't you want to blend in?

136
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:32,166
You had a vision?

137
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,583
What if we've been looking at it
backwards?

138
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:37,546
We've been trying to discover
runes that invoke specific effects

139
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,083
and then molding them
to a useful function.

140
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,750
Tools, as you like to put it. But, but...

141
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:47,625
If the legends are true,
mages aren't bound to single functions.

142
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,416
It's said the Arcane speaks through them.

143
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,250
I'm still not following.

144
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,750
They think. They adapt.

145
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,458
You think Hextech can... learn?

146
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:05,250
Are you sure this is safe?

147
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,666
Of course not.

148
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,166
Oh, Jericho! Have I missed these.

149
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:30,541
Hmm?

150
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,541
No. Thank you.

151
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,333
You're missing out.

152
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,458
Are you going to question him?

153
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,375
About what? The meat?

154
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,583
Definitely not above board.

155
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:45,041
Silco. His connections?
Isn't that why we're here?

156
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:48,041
We're here because I'm hungry.
Do you know what prison food is like?

157
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:49,708
No, of course, you don't.

158
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,708
Unbelievable. I didn't break you
out of jail to eat... slop.

159
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:58,791
I knew this was a terrible idea.
You don't actually know anything, do you?

160
00:14:59,291 --> 00:15:01,041
Mm. Better than I remember.

161
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,916
Hmm.

162
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,208
I haven't been here in years.

163
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,250
Since my parents brought me
for the winter fest.

164
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:31,708
We're not here for the performance.
Your House is in trouble.

165
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,833
That merchant formerly enjoyed
certain leniencies

166
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:40,708
with regard to her trade in exchange
for her generous Academy patronage.

167
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,458
By leniencies you mean corruption?

168
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,666
Hmm, Amara's harmless.

169
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,083
Oh, look at those two stooges.

170
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:51,250
Councilors Hoskel and Salo.
Don't they hate each other?

171
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:55,000
Hmm. But they share a taste
for the finer Noxian spirits,

172
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,916
technically an illegal import.

173
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,958
I tightened our security.

174
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,541
And in so doing,
put a target on your back.

175
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:08,666
There are those who covet your power
over the wealth the Hexgates afford.

176
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,708
And would take any opportunity
to seize it from you.

177
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,166
You've just made yourself
everyone's common enemy, Jayce.

178
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,000
<i>Oh, what's the matter, Mylo?</i>

179
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,000
<i>You worried Powder's gonna beat you again.</i>

180
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:40,458
<i>Vander.</i>

181
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,166
<i>Because you're a jinx!</i>

182
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,596
<i>What makes you different makes you strong.</i>

183
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,250
Hmm.

184
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,500
Well, that place does look like
it has bodies buried in the basement.

185
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,083
You don't know anything.

186
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,875
I can't compromise the safety
of the Hexgates for collateral.

187
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:09,416
No one's asking you to.
These are simply favors amongst friends.

188
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:13,125
I never wanted anything to do
with politics. You pushed this on me.

189
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:16,500
You're a symbol of the future now, Jayce,
whether you like it or not.

190
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,916
With that comes the potential
to shape your own destiny.

191
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:25,541
The Council assumes you'll fail.
Time to prove them all wrong. Once again.

192
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,958
Welcome, Amara. How's little Rohan?

193
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:34,375
Councilor Medarda. Councilor Talis.

194
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,875
He's just as precocious as ever.

195
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:44,666
I had quite a shock this morning.
Enforcers banging on my door.

196
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,791
Oh, I hope you'll understand,
Jayce had to make a show of safety.

197
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,458
But he's here now to negotiate
all his deals personally.

198
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:56,041
Councilor Talis is willing to reinstate
former trade privileges

199
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:58,041
to those who share his vision.

200
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,791
Can we count you amongst them?

201
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:03,625
Councilor Bolbok seems to think other
arrangements would be more profitable.

202
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:05,458
The man's a fool.

203
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:07,708
With him, you'd be investing in the past.

204
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,583
With us, you'd be investing in the future.

205
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,291
You know, Councilor Medarda's right.
The Hexgates are only the beginning.

206
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,750
In fact, we're currently looking
for new partners in our Hextech research,

207
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,833
and as a supporter of House Talis,

208
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,875
you'd be the first in line
to any of our advancements.

209
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:34,333
How can I say no
to such an auspicious offer?

210
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:38,625
Hextech partners?

211
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:40,250
Has a nice ring, doesn't it?

212
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:44,333
Mm. Your audience awaits, Councilor.

213
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,416
He's been quite the investment.

214
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,541
Indeed. Better than expected.

215
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,041
The one place all the secrets are spilled.

216
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,083
Oh.

217
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,041
How exactly do you propose
we go about this?

218
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:12,750
Let 'em think you work here.

219
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:14,625
Excuse me?

220
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,291
I will not.

221
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,166
You know what your problem is?

222
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,791
Please. Tell me.

223
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,208
You expect everyone
to give you what you want.

224
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,931
If you really want people to talk to you,

225
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:27,083
you have to let them think
you have what they want.

226
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:28,750
And what do I have?

227
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,875
You're hot, cupcake.

228
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:37,291
So what'll it be, man or woman?

229
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:39,666
Um...

230
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:41,708
Hi.

231
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,791
I'm Pim. What's your name?

232
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:50,791
Matilda. But you can call her
whatever you want.

233
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,375
Ah, yes. Matilda.

234
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,666
My parents named me Matilda.

235
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,875
After my great-grandmother Matilda,
the, uh...

236
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,791
Would you believe it?

237
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,750
Sheriff, what a lovely surprise.

238
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,916
The Hextech wonder boy
is on the Council now,

239
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,583
and he's asking questions.

240
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:26,291
It's only a matter of time
before he finds the truth.

241
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,791
What is truth, but a survivor's story?

242
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,666
If I'm discovered, we're both finished.

243
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,708
Good thing you've located proof
of the Firelights' involvement.

244
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,333
This has gone too far.

245
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,708
Hmm? Imagining yourself a hero?

246
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:55,708
One final act to make you the martyr
you've always seen yourself as?

247
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:06,083
Then what are you waiting for?

248
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,083
Ah, he's faltering.

249
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:23,541
You need to weaponize the Hextech soon.

250
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,875
Once we've cracked their prize,
topside will have no power over us.

251
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:32,375
I can't do it.
Just... give it to the doctor.

252
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,375
You're the only one
I can trust with this, Jinx.

253
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:39,458
I keep... seeing them. That day.

254
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,583
Fear haunts us all, child.

255
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:52,666
Sweetheart, I was real sad
to hear about Vander.

256
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:56,166
And the kids. Just terrible.

257
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,916
By the looks of it, no one down here
lifted a finger to stop Silco.

258
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:04,666
A few tried but Silco's got the muscle...
and the money.

259
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,208
He took over the Last Drop.

260
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:07,875
I saw.

261
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:11,083
Things have changed
without Vander looking out for us.

262
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:15,458
Have you heard anything about Powder?
I think Silco has her.

263
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:18,916
I have to find her.

264
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,750
Silco's number two's a regular.

265
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,458
I can have Miguel tell you
where to find her.

266
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,541
I owe you.

267
00:25:30,583 --> 00:25:31,625
It's nothing.

268
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:37,875
I've only ever imagined the gardens...

269
00:25:37,958 --> 00:25:39,750
This is all I've seen.

270
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:54,708
You did well today.

271
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:56,708
I had a good teacher.

272
00:25:57,666 --> 00:26:00,666
It's only a matter of time
before those old fools on the Council

273
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,666
officially accept your research.

274
00:26:04,291 --> 00:26:06,500
My father put hammers
in the hands of the people,

275
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:08,750
and they built this magnificent city.

276
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:12,916
Imagine the wonders they could create
if we put magic in their hands.

277
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,666
The world will never be the same.

278
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,958
The Medardas usually only take
from the world.

279
00:26:20,833 --> 00:26:23,625
We're not often in the position
to give anything back.

280
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,083
I couldn't have done it without you.

281
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,166
Hmm.

282
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,333
It's beautiful.

283
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,916
I can't figure out why it's not working.

284
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,041
You will.

285
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:07,250
Are you headed home soon?
I thought we could walk together.

286
00:27:07,791 --> 00:27:10,666
I'm, uh, probably going
to sleep here tonight.

287
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:14,750
Again? You know
there's always tomorrow, right?

288
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:17,083
Good night, Miss Young.

289
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,083
Mm.

290
00:29:02,791 --> 00:29:04,833
I almost drowned in these waters.

291
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:07,541
You told me a million times.

292
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:10,541
Vander wasn't the man
you thought he was.

293
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,125
Right, he was like a brother to you,

294
00:29:13,208 --> 00:29:16,625
and he turned his back
and blah, blah, blah.

295
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,250
Did I miss anything?

296
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:21,708
I've got a new one for you.

297
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,708
That day, I let a weak man die.

298
00:29:40,541 --> 00:29:42,625
And another was reborn.

299
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:49,791
Betrayal, that pain that feels like
it'll eat you from the inside out,

300
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:54,625
can either break you or forge you
into something greater.

301
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:58,166
You need to let Powder die.

302
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,666
So the fear of pain
will no longer control you.

303
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:08,208
You're strong now.
Just like you were always meant to be.

304
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:10,708
Jinx is perfect.

Viktor, the doctors, um, they said you're...

326
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:09,333
How much time do I have?

327
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:16,583
Rotten luck, boys!

00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,291
<i>♪ Everybody wants to be my enemy ♪</i>

329
00:32:28,083 --> 00:32:29,125

You filthy traitor.

331
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,958
Vander had his chance.

332
00:33:03,666 --> 00:33:05,375
I see you never learned patience.

333
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:30,708
Where's my sister?
Where's he keeping her?

334
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,583
Keeping her? You mean Jinx?

335
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:36,458
She works for him.

336
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:50,333
She's like his daughter.

337
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,000
I'll give her your regards.

338
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,166
Why did you let her go?

339
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,833
Do you ever say "thank you?"

340
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,500
- He's gonna know we're here now.
- Whose fault is that?

341
00:35:41,625 --> 00:35:42,750
You're an all-right shot.

342
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,125
I'm an excellent shot.

343
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,916
You gonna help me out, cupcake?

344
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:52,333
Stop calling me that. My name is Caitlyn.

345
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,166
But you're so sweet.

346
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:55,875
Like a cupcake.

00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:58,416

The sister.

00:36:44,083 --> 00:36:45,291
She's back.

351
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,041
From the dead?
