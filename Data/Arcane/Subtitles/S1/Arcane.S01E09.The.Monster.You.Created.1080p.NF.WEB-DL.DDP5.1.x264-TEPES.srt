1
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,283
You didn't have a choice.

2
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,041
He knew what he was signing up for.

3
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:48,958
We're done here.

4
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:52,708
We haven't even scratched the surface.
Silco's still out there.

5
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:57,708
Do you not understand?
I am part of this now!

6
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,166
The next parents who get a message
their kid isn't coming home...

7
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't even know where to take it.

8
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:07,000
Do we just leave him here?

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,708
You've always been a part of this.

10
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,375
You just never had to look it in the eye.
One dead kid?

11
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,726
There's hundreds more where he came from,
thanks to Silco,

12
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,666
and thanks to people like you
who stuck their heads in the dirt.

13
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,000
- This is over.
- Not for me.

14
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:25,666
Take those off.

15
00:01:31,541 --> 00:01:32,958
Make me.

16
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,166
I can't let you leave with them.

17
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,833
Then, I guess you're gonna need
to kill another trencher.

18
00:01:59,375 --> 00:02:00,708
You won't make it alone.

Been a while
since topside's gotten this bold.

36
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:48,208
Say what you want about the late Sheriff.
He had his uses.

37
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,375
Too bad Jinx didn't think so.

38
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:52,958
We'll buy another.

39
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,125
You gonna do anything

40
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:58,041
about that piece of shit
that murdered my boy?

41
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:01,500
Let me guess, "Jinx will take care of it."

42
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:04,916
Just like she's been taking care
of everything else.

43
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:11,083
We all mourn the loss of your son, Renni.

44
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:18,416
At least, we have the solace of knowing
he died fighting for our cause,

45
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:25,166
instead of some petty personal dispute,
as so often occurs here.

46
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,875
You're one to talk
about sacrificing for the cause.

47
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,583
Where is Jinx anyhow?

48
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,208
Help her with the body.

49
00:05:14,708 --> 00:05:15,708
<i>Viktor...</i>

50
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:18,958
<i>I know this will probably
never see the light of day,</i>

51
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,625
<i>but watching how you work so tirelessly
to make the world a better place...</i>

52
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:27,500
<i>Well, I couldn't forgive myself
if I didn't try.</i>

53
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,708
<i>Everyone's gotta do
their part, right?</i>

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,083
Okay.

55
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:35,791
Noxian wine is bold by comparison.

56
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,434
The grapes are hardened by the climate.

57
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:41,458
But then, so is everything
that manages to survive in Noxus.

58
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,916
Mel, would you like...

59
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,416
Leave.

60
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,916
- Hmm.
- Stay away from Jayce!

61
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,416
You really are fond of him.

62
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,166
Better yet, march back to your ship
and get the hell out of my city.

63
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,208
Get ahold of yourself.
I taught you better.

64
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,688
We're in trouble, Mel.

65
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:31,250
The man who killed your brother
doesn't believe the score is settled,

66
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:33,541
and his resources exceed ours.

67
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,125
If there is a chance Hextech
can be weaponized, we must have it.

68
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,541
Piltover isn't your testing ground.

69
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,291
I've only accelerated
the process you started.

70
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,125
I wanted to protect the city
from people like you.

71
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:49,333
I can't believe you'd start a war
just to cover your ass.

72
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,916
I would set the world ablaze
to protect our family.

73
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,166
No.

74
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,333
I stopped being part of this family
the moment you cast me out.

75
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,958
Why? Why did you do it?

76
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,416
Because you weakened me!

77
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,791
I couldn't endure the look in your eyes
whenever I made the decisions,

78
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,875
the necessary decisions to keep us safe!

79
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,458
We need that weapon, Mel.

80
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:24,291
Let the war unfold.

81
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:27,250
And you come home,

82
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,791
take your place at my side.

83
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,291
It's where you belong.

84
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:45,750
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:49,541
I don't know where you'd have preferred.

86
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,916
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,458
Am I interrupting?

88
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,041
Remember the Distinguished Innovators
competition?

89
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:48,416
I remember you notching gears
in the carriage over.

90
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,500
They started cranking the engine
and the whole thing was rattling.

91
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:54,875
I thought a loose cog
was gonna take someone's eye out.

92
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,833
At least, you didn't throw up.

93
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,500
Everything made sense then.

94
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,541
You have to destroy it.

95
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,125
I know.

96
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,750
The Hexcore.

97
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:15,708
I... I can't do it.

98
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,291
You have to. Please.

99
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,000
What about your disease?

100
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,083
Without the Hexcore...

101
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,291
Promise me.

102
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,750
Okay. Okay.

103
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,791
I promise.

104
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,500
We lost ourselves. Lost our dream.

105
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:47,041
In the pursuit of great,
we failed to do good.

106
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:50,500
<i>We have to make it right.</i>

107
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,458
I'm busy.

108
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,708
When you took Vander out of play,
I thought,

109
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:23,958
"Now here's a man who understands
what it takes to run an enterprise."

110
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,958
The attitude, the instinct, the eye.

111
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,041
The whole package, you were.

112
00:11:29,875 --> 00:11:33,083
Always two steps ahead.

113
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,958
But time's lapped you, old man.

114
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,375
You're with him, are you?

115
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,625
You screwed up, Silco.

116
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,458
You're too young to remember
what the undercity was

117
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:53,333
before it became an "enterprise".

118
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,250
We had nothing.

119
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,458
You know
what bore us through those times?

120
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:01,875
Loyalty.

121
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:06,291
Brothers and sisters back-to-back
against whatever the world threw at us.

122
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:11,125
Now I'm forced to share the air
with parasites like you,

123
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,666
who leach off their legacies.

124
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:18,291
Today's the day you die, Silco.

125
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,083
That's a risk I've known all my life.

126
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:25,166
But I still believe in loyalty.

127
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,833
I would have had your son killed for this.

128
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,583
Though I suppose we're ahead
on that account.

129
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,416
Get out.

130
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,875
Were you tempted?

131
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,500
Not for a worm like him.

132
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,791
But he won't be the last.

133
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,250
Hmm.

134
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,000
Perfect place for an ambush.

135
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,625
And you without your hammer.

136
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,125
I was reminded recently of what
brought us together in the first place.

137
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,583
The threats beyond our walls.

138
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,291
This city has a short memory.

139
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:16,958
"Progress."

140
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,833
Far be it from me to stand in the way.

141
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,666
"Free trade routes, blanket amnesty,

142
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,458
unrestricted access
to the Hexgates, sovereignty."

143
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,458
Do you really think you're in a position
to demand all this?

144
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:51,458
I give you credit for your stunt, boy.

145
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,500
Didn't think you had the stomach.

146
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,708
But the big display
followed by a request for parley,

147
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,041
you're tipping your hand.

148
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:03,083
You're afraid.

149
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,916
I am afraid.

150
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:08,375
Today, I got a glimpse
of what war between us might look like.

151
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,708
Your people wouldn't stand a chance.

152
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,791
The Council couldn't care less.

153
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,625
I'm trying to save you from annihilation.

154
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,250
Well, well.

155
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,083
Not the fresh-faced Academy pledge,
are you?

156
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,000
You want peace, this is the price.

157
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,916
You'll discontinue
the production of Shimmer?

158
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,083
Half there already.

159
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:35,791
Return the Gemstone.

160
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,500
And I need Jinx.

161
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,833
She has to pay for what she's done.

162
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,958
They weren't her crimes.
She was working for me.

163
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:49,583
Believe me, if I had it my way,
it'd be you rotting in Stillwater,

164
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:53,416
but we can't make a deal
with a snake and cut off its head.

165
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,083
We both have our shitty parts to play.

166
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:59,666
Get me Jinx.
And I'll give you your nation of Zaun.

167
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,000
Astonishing.

168
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,583
You say all this came about
in your own brief lifespan?

169
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,791
How were you able to accomplish
so much so quickly?

170
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,125
You'd be surprised what you can pull off
when your life depends on it.

171
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,958
Uh, why this form?

172
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:53,000
Surely, there are more efficient
and safer methods of transportation.

173
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:55,958
Firelights!

174
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,458
- Huh?
- Hmm?

175
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,416
Oh.

176
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,020
It's not enough to give people
what they need to survive,

177
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,750
you have to give them
what they need to live.

178
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,500
A thousand times
I've imagined this moment.

179
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,291
Never like this.

180
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,083
All we ever wanted.

181
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,791
The boy didn't even haggle.

182
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,708
And what do I lose but problems?

183
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,041
Oh, it all makes sense now, brother.

184
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:58,333
Is there anything so undoing
as a daughter?

185
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,583
Damn it.

186
00:18:35,541 --> 00:18:36,781
Piss off.

187
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,916
Everyone out.

188
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,625
Well, your guard needs working.

189
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,083
I wish I could say it gets easier, kiddo.

190
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,208
But I'd be lying.

191
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,583
What I can say is...

192
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,625
She still needs you.

193
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,250
They all do.

194
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,458
So what do you say?

195
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:32,750
That's my girl.

196
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:44,625
Silco.

197
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,625
Bravo, sis.

198
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:06,541
<i>Councilors...</i>

199
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,291
My recent unsanctioned activities

200
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,750
in the underground
have shown me two things.

201
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,250
I'm not fit to govern the people
who live there.

202
00:23:15,916 --> 00:23:17,208
And neither are you.

203
00:23:17,958 --> 00:23:20,416
Our opportunity
to demonstrate our compassion,

204
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,166
our dedication,

205
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,416
our solidarity has passed.

206
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:29,000
They're right not to trust us.

207
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,875
You're walking a fine line, Jayce.

208
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:36,625
With respect, I don't give a shit
what any of you think of me anymore.

209
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,666
Except you.

210
00:23:41,541 --> 00:23:42,541
You were right.

211
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,250
You were always right.

212
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,208
My days here are numbered,
but I've come with Viktor,

213
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:52,500
my partner and a Zaunite,
with one final proposal.

214
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:58,000
Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco.

215
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,833
In exchange for the undercity's
independence.

216
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,541
What? Nonsense! We have procedures...

217
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,583
Really thought I buried this place.

218
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,625
But I should have known better.

219
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:50,875
Powder?

220
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,916
Nothing ever stays dead.

221
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:58,916
Are we alone?

222
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,916
For now.

223
00:25:02,916 --> 00:25:04,333
Maybe forever.

224
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,916
Wanna know a secret?

225
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,375
Silco thinks he made Jinx,

226
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:17,041
with all his rants
and his hard-won lessons.

227
00:25:17,125 --> 00:25:19,958
"Excise your doubts, Jinx."

228
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,833
"Be what they fear, Jinx."

229
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:26,083
Like everything was the same
as when Vander left him.

230
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:29,708
But he didn't make Jinx.

231
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:32,333
You did.

232
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,166
I'm sorry, Powder.

233
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:38,791
I never meant to leave you.

234
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,125
You never left.

235
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:43,791
I always heard you.

236
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:48,458
Shadows in the streets,
prickles on the back of my neck.

237
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,708
Your voice.

238
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,041
Pushing me.

239
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:57,250
Picking me up
when all the colors were black.

240
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,541
You're the reason I'm still alive.

241
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,375
I spent so many nights
in that shitty prison.

242
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:08,458
On the freezing floor,
hungry, bloody, counting the hours.

243
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,291
The only thing...

244
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:15,291
The only thing that kept me going
was the thought of getting back to you.

245
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,833
Are we still sisters?

246
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,333
Nothing is ever going to change that.

247
00:26:31,625 --> 00:26:34,750
- I always knew you'd come back.
- What's going on?

248
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:53,125
- No.
- He took everything from us.

249
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,375
Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back.

250
00:26:56,458 --> 00:26:58,166
Just like he planned to do with me.

251
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,916
<i>All the time saying
you abandoned me when he knew the truth.</i>

252
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,541
Liar.

253
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,041
Mm. We're missing someone.

254
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:37,833
Huh?

255
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,333
I paid your girlfriend
a visit this morning.

256
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,958
What did you do?

257
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,000
- I made her a snack.
- Huh?

258
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,250
No!

259
00:27:58,333 --> 00:28:00,541
Sheesh.

260
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:02,375
I'm not that crazy.

261
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:16,041
Powder! Leave her out of this.

262
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:23,583
Now...

263
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:27,458
Where should I sit?

264
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,916
That's your choice, really.

265
00:28:41,291 --> 00:28:43,541
Make her go away. Please.

266
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:46,583
Send her on her way and...

267
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:49,916
And you can have Powder back.

268
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,125
Mm.

269
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,666
- I can't.
- Ah.

270
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,916
No! Powder, listen.

271
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,375
We... we can just go.

272
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,708
We'll leave and never come back.

273
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:05,375
Where would we go?

274
00:29:05,958 --> 00:29:08,666
No, no, no. She's not saying that.

275
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
It's true, we'll put this behind us.

276
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,226
You'll never have
to see him again, Powder.

277
00:29:17,041 --> 00:29:19,041
What do you have to say about that?

278
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,708
Her name is Jinx!

279
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:25,041
She's lying.

280
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,250
You'll be with her a day
before she realizes

281
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,333
you aren't that girl anymore
and turns her back on you.

282
00:29:30,416 --> 00:29:31,416
Mm-hmm.

283
00:29:32,375 --> 00:29:34,166
You aren't lying?

284
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,000
You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.

285
00:29:37,083 --> 00:29:38,166
I'm not lying.

286
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,541
I'm on your side. I promise.

287
00:29:47,541 --> 00:29:50,500
Shut up! We're talking!

288
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:52,875
The topsiders offered me everything.

289
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,583
Independence, a seat at the table.

290
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,708
All in return for you.

291
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,708
They can all burn.

292
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:04,125
Everyone betrays us, Jinx. Vander. Her.

293
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:06,291
They will never understand.

294
00:30:08,125 --> 00:30:09,458
It's only us.

295
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,208
You're my daughter.

296
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,750
I'll never forsake you.

297
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,708
Drop the gun!

298
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,791
No. Please.

299
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,208
<i>It's time to leave them.</i>

300
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:48,958
No! Stop!

301
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:51,666
Drop the gun.

302
00:30:58,708 --> 00:31:01,583
Wait! She's my sister.

303
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,541
Vi, she's too far gone.

304
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,500
No, no, no.

305
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:29,458
Look out!

306
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:37,833
You see, now finish it.

307
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,666
Damn it! Powder, wake up!

308
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:44,000
Remember who you are! I know you remember!

309
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:50,791
- Picture Mylo! Claggor!
- Stop.

310
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,041
- Vander!
- Shut up! Don't listen to her!

311
00:31:53,125 --> 00:31:55,708
Dad!

312
00:31:55,791 --> 00:31:58,208
<i>Mom!</i>

313
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,125
Me!

314
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,708
No!

315
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:46,791
No...

316
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,458
Oh. Oh, no, no, no.

317
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:51,958
I'm sorry...

318
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,333
I never would have given you to them.

319
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:00,000
Not for anything.

320
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,458
Don't cry.

321
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:06,125
You're perfect.

322
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,250
Powder?

323
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:41,958
It's okay.

324
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:45,875
We'll be okay.

325
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:14,958
I thought maybe you could love me
like you used to.

326
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,250
Even though I'm... different.

327
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,458
But you changed too.

328
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,333
So...

329
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,291
Here's to the new us.

330
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:17,541
<i>We'll show them.</i>

331
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,750
<i>We will show them all.</i>

332
00:35:31,958 --> 00:35:35,250
I support Councilor Talis' proposal
for peace.
