1
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:29,825
You really went to the undercity
to get these?

2
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:31,033
Weren't you afraid?

3
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,436
A little danger is worth the risk,
don't you think?

4
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:34,866
Oh.

5
00:00:34,908 --> 00:00:35,908
Uh, careful.

6
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:37,866
That's your parents' money
you're dropping.

7
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,866
Powder, we've gotta go!

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,616
Hello? Is someone in there?

9
00:00:48,575 --> 00:00:49,575
Hey, open up!

10
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:19,450
Jayce?

11
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:22,533
Jayce!

12
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:36,658
Mom!

13
00:01:37,908 --> 00:01:39,616
Mom. Mom, wake up.

14
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,533
Mom.

15
00:01:44,075 --> 00:01:47,658
Help! Please, someone, help us!

16
00:01:48,325 --> 00:01:50,866
Help! Please!

17
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,825
No. Wait. Wait.

18
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:23,991
How?

19
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,616
<i>♪ I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that arouse ♪</i>

20
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,658

<i>♪ Look out for yourself ♪</i>

35
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:47,200
Let's go over it again.

36
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:49,991
You have to believe me.
I didn't do this.

37
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:54,575
Relax, kid. We know it was a break-in
but that doesn't explain this.

38
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:58,658
There's a lot of restricted items here
and I don't see any permits.

39
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,141
You wanna tell me how you got them?

40
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,991
Hey, hey! Be careful with that, please.

41
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:05,950
I believe someone
should have said that earlier.

42
00:05:06,908 --> 00:05:08,283
What happened here?

43
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:11,575
Science, I guess?

44
00:05:11,658 --> 00:05:15,575
Last time I checked,
science didn't require illegal equipment.

45
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:20,616
Nor was this approved by the Academy.
Who authorized your research?

46
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,908
It was an independent study.
Who are you anyway?

47
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,283
I'm assistant to the Dean of the Academy,

48
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:29,533
who it may serve you to remember
is also head of the Council.

49
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:34,450
He sent me here to ensure
that anything dangerous is removed safely.

50
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,991
Which, according to my list, includes you.

51
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:40,158
What? How am I dangerous?

52
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,533
Uh, that's for the council to decide.

53
00:06:12,158 --> 00:06:15,116
Imprisonment. What a curious principle.

54
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,991
We confine the physical body,
yet the mind is still free.

55
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:21,283
I do love a good conundrum.

56
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:25,200
I remember the first time
I saw you at the Academy.

57
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,116
You reminded me of myself.

58
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,991
A scientist ready to forge
a new vector of experimentation.

59
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,658
But sometimes we venture too far.

60
00:06:35,741 --> 00:06:39,325
No great science
should ever put lives in danger.

61
00:06:40,158 --> 00:06:43,616
Be honest, now.
What manner of inquiry was this?

62
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,533
Professor Heimerdinger, I...

63
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:48,533
I believe I've discovered
something truly incredible.

64
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,950
A way to harness magic through science.

65
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:51,950
Magic?

66
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,033
Yes.

67
00:06:53,116 --> 00:06:54,158
No.

68
00:06:54,241 --> 00:06:55,158
No?

69
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:57,450
The Arcane is dangerous, Jayce.

70
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,450
A force of nature.
Science cannot control it.

71
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,991
But maybe it can.

72
00:07:03,075 --> 00:07:05,700
I'm close to a breakthrough, I know it.

73
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:07,450
How old are you, my boy?

74
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:11,075
- I'm... I'm 24.
- Ah.

75
00:07:11,825 --> 00:07:14,700
Well, I am now 307 years old.

76
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:18,825
All my life,
I've pursued the mysteries of science,

77
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:22,866
only to discover
some are better left unsolved.

78
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,033
This, I'm afraid, is one of them.

79
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:30,075
Own your mistakes before the Council,
admit your work was dangerous,

80
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,908
but speak nothing of magic.

81
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:36,450
Do that and I theorize you'll get away

82
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:39,200
with, um, how do you say,
a slap on the wrist.

83
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,241
Remind me why we bother with this dump.

84
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:08,866
Vander said to lay low.

85
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,283
Enforcers never come down here,
so this is as good a place as any.

86
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:16,075
Oh, what's the matter, Mylo?
You worried Powder's gonna beat you again?

87
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:18,491
Hey, if she didn't keep
fixing these things,

88
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:19,658
I wouldn't keep missing.

89
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,783
You guys know I wouldn't take you
on a job you couldn't handle, right?

90
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,491
Are you kidding?
That was the best job we've ever done.

91
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:39,991
Maybe just don't take Powder next time.

92
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:41,783
Um...

93
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:05,325
Get back.

94
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:09,158
- Tell me where I can find them.
- Topsider business ain't my concern.

95
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:11,616
It's every one
of you trencher's concern now.

96
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,283
Give me a name.

97
00:09:20,866 --> 00:09:23,616
Hey, guys? You should see this...

98
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,658
Search them.

99
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,283
Go ahead, idiots. We've got nothing.

100
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,450
Go!

101
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:08,625
Go!

102
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,741
Come on!

103
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:20,765
Come on.

104
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:28,700
Get them!

105
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,033
Over here!

106
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:54,116
- You need to hide those crystals.
- Yeah, no shit.

107
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:58,700
The House Ferros received your letter.

108
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,408
They insist business is steady.

109
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:02,200
Steady is stagnant, Elora.

110
00:11:02,283 --> 00:11:05,408
They wished me to remind you
that it's thanks to their innovations

111
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,408
that you are the richest person
in Piltover.

112
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:10,741
Yet I remain the poorest Medarda.

113
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:14,366
Excellent choice, Councilor Medarda.
Supreme challenge.

114
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,533
- If I may...
- We need something revolutionary, Elora.

115
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:21,491
Something to put Piltover on the map.

116
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,950
- What of today's trial?
- His name is Jayce of House Talis.

117
00:11:26,033 --> 00:11:28,158
A House? Remind me.

118
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:29,450
They're toolmakers.

119
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:32,241
I believe they came to renown
for their design of the...

120
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,866
collapsible pocket wrench.

121
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,200
- But Heimerdinger favors him?
- As far as I can tell.

122
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:39,575
Hmm.

123
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,408
This one.

124
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,575
But that's...

125
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:45,033
Well, that's a child's toy.

126
00:11:45,616 --> 00:11:47,616
Hmm... Good.

127
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,991
The boy's got ambition.

128
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:54,835
It's why we supported him
in the first place.

129
00:11:54,908 --> 00:11:57,700
Ambition?
Darling, he nearly blew up our daughter.

130
00:11:57,783 --> 00:12:00,783
Jayce had nothing
to do with that. He was robbed.

131
00:12:00,866 --> 00:12:03,366
- We need to help him.
- Caitlyn's right.

132
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,366
We've known Jayce for years.
Besides, we're his patrons.

133
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,491
If anyone is meant
to speak up for him, it's us.

134
00:12:10,575 --> 00:12:14,158
We should hit them back.
We've got the numbers to beat them.

135
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,325
Yeah. Let's teach them
what it means to mess with us.

136
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:17,616
Yeah!

137
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:27,450
- You sure that's what you want?
- Let's do it.

138
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:31,783
We crossed that bridge once before,
and we all know how that ended.

139
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:33,575
You're just protecting your kids.

140
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,783
I'm protecting our people.
I'd do the same for any one of you.

141
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:43,408
We look out for each other.
It's the way it's always been.

142
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:47,616
This will blow over.
We just need to stand together.

143
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,408
The Vander I knew,
the one who built the underground,

144
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,408
wouldn't be afraid to fight.

145
00:12:58,408 --> 00:13:01,408
- Do I look afraid?
- No.

146
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,533
You look weak.

147
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:10,366
Why isn't he doing anything?

148
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,033
We kicked the Enforcers' butts
with just the four of us.

149
00:13:13,116 --> 00:13:14,991
Imagine what the whole
of the Lanes could do.

150
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:18,825
- Jeez, even Powder wants to fight.
- So, why aren't we?

151
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,825
Spill it, Ekko.

152
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,825
Um...

153
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:35,533
Oh, okay. Well, um, Vander's got a deal
with the Enforcers.

154
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,200
What deal?

155
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,700
For your birthday, Councilor.

156
00:13:56,783 --> 00:14:00,075
Ah, Mel, this is too kind.

157
00:14:00,158 --> 00:14:03,491
I'm told it was built only
for the sharpest of minds.

158
00:14:03,575 --> 00:14:06,616
And I bought you some Ginko nuts.

159
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,908
Don't you know I'm allergic?

160
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:10,033
What are you trying to do?

161
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:11,396
Kill an old man?

162
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:45,491
Jayce Talis.

163
00:14:48,116 --> 00:14:53,200
You are accused of illegal experimentation
and endangering the citizens of Piltover.

164
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:55,866
What do you have to say for yourself?

165
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:04,575
The materials were far more dangerous
than I was aware of,

166
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:09,283
and I... I now know my actions
were against Academy regulations.

167
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:13,991
What I did endangered people.
It was reckless, and for that, I'm sorry.

168
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:19,075
I ask the Council's forgiveness,
and I hope that I can continue my studies.

169
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:23,158
As Jayce's patron of many years,
I can speak for his character.

170
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,866
I believe that one day,

171
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,200
he will be a great contributor
to our society.

172
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,366
He destroyed a building.

173
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,033
Is this the sort of contribution
we can expect?

174
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,551
If you were a scientist,

175
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:38,116
you'd know you can't make a prototype
without breaking a few wrenches.

176
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,950
Do you have anything to show
for your work besides an explosion?

177
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:44,616
Uh, no. It came to nothing.

178
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,325
So, you're saying
your study was meaningless?

179
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:50,283
- It was revolutionary!
- Revolutionary how?

180
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,950
All I see is a boy meddling with things
he doesn't understand.

181
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,741
The Academy seems
to have loosened its standards.

182
00:15:56,825 --> 00:15:59,366
This is a fine line.
If we condone this, what's next?

183
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:00,658
Ridiculous, really.

184
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,676
The Council has more
important matters to deal with.

185
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,741
Perhaps we should just finish this...

186
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:07,533
I was trying to create magic.

187
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Magic?

188
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:17,450
Arcane talents are something
you're born with.

189
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,700
They can't be fabricated.

190
00:16:19,783 --> 00:16:21,741
Actually, I believe it is possible.

191
00:16:22,575 --> 00:16:24,950
Has anyone even tried it before?

192
00:16:27,908 --> 00:16:32,700
The Arcane is the curse of our world.
My race was nearly destroyed by it.

193
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:37,075
Surely, we, the pioneers of science,
can use it for good.

194
00:16:37,158 --> 00:16:41,033
We're the champions of discovery.
Why fear it when we can master it?

195
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:42,116
Jayce, enough.

196
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:46,116
This is the city of progress,
think of the wonders we could create.

197
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,241
- Let me prove...
- Enough!

198
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,575
You don't understand what's at stake.

199
00:16:52,616 --> 00:16:54,075
But how can you?

200
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:57,241
That's a burden that only I here carry.

201
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,491
Time.

202
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:04,741
<i>I've seen this power in the wrong hands.</i>

203
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:10,866
<i>It corrupts, consumes,
lays waste to civilizations.</i>

204
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:17,158
That cannot happen here, my boy.
It must not.

205
00:17:18,075 --> 00:17:20,033
Heimerdinger is right.

206
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:23,616
Piltover was founded to escape
the warmongering of mages,

207
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,950
not cultivate it.

208
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:29,908
The Ethos is clear.
He must be banished from Piltover.

209
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,200
Please, let me speak!

210
00:17:39,241 --> 00:17:42,533
As a lower house, my voice
doesn't carry much weight here.

211
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:46,158
But as a mother,
I have a voice that matters deeply.

212
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,950
My son isn't in his right mind.

213
00:17:50,741 --> 00:17:53,658
His entire life,
he's chased an impossible dream.

214
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:58,700
What he did was, uh, foolish and unwise.

215
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:03,908
But he has a good heart.
Please, let him come home.

216
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:08,366
A crime like this can't be overlooked.
The boy must be punished.

217
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,866
A violation of the Ethos
calls for banishment,

218
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,950
but I can sympathize with a young man's
dream to change the world.

219
00:18:16,533 --> 00:18:20,283
Perhaps in this matter,
a lesser sentence may suffice.

220
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:24,325
I move that Jayce be summarily expelled
from the Academy

221
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:27,241
and remanded to the care of his parents.

222
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:29,075
All those in favor?

223
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:47,658
You may take your son home, Mrs. Talis,

224
00:18:47,741 --> 00:18:51,116
but he is to never set foot
on Academy grounds again.

225
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:28,991
First time I've been invited to the Lanes.
It better be worth my time.

226
00:19:30,283 --> 00:19:32,783
Ah, you see, that's your weakness, Marcus.

227
00:19:32,866 --> 00:19:37,033
You carry your chin so high,
you fail to see the opportunity below.

228
00:19:37,116 --> 00:19:38,241
Who are you?

229
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:41,283
You're looking for four children,

230
00:19:41,366 --> 00:19:44,408
the ones running circles
around Piltover's finest.

231
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:45,741
What about it?

232
00:19:46,408 --> 00:19:50,700
Don't look so concerned.
I'm about to make your day.

233
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,116
Can I come in?

234
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:09,158
Hmm.

235
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:13,533
I still remember the look on your face
when you found these.

236
00:20:17,075 --> 00:20:21,783
Jayce, please. If I hadn't spoken,
you'd be lost to me.

237
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:24,700
I had to say something.

238
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,533
Magic saved your life.

239
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:33,616
Yes, but it won't save yours now.
You need to let it go.

240
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
I could've convinced the Council.

241
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,408
If my own family won't help me,
I'll find someone who will.

242
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:53,741
Oh. That foolish boy.

243
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:56,950
Yeah, I must admit,
his theory intrigues.

244
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,533
If dangerous ideas
didn't excite the imagination,

245
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:01,200
we would never wander astray.

246
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:06,241
Could it work? Could these stones
really invoke magic?

247
00:21:06,325 --> 00:21:08,658
Nonsense. It's far too unstable.

248
00:21:09,158 --> 00:21:10,741
Could you stabilize it?

249
00:21:10,825 --> 00:21:12,991
Me? Why would I?

250
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:14,866
That only leads to more problems,

251
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:17,158
and that poor boy
has enough of them already.

252
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:22,200
There. Come tomorrow morning,
his research will be safely disposed of.

253
00:21:22,908 --> 00:21:23,908
Lock up.

254
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:30,116
No, no, no. Magic is far too dangerous
in the wrong hands.

255
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,325
Will he live?

256
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:37,575
Long enough.

257
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,366
Beautiful, aren't they?

258
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:54,866
Yet, up there on the surface,

259
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,158
no one even knows they exist.

260
00:21:57,908 --> 00:21:59,366
They're monsters.

261
00:22:02,908 --> 00:22:04,658
There's a monster inside all of us.

262
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,283
What? No. No, no! It'll kill me!

263
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:16,533
I'd like to let you in
on a very important secret

264
00:22:16,616 --> 00:22:19,158
I learned when I was about your age, boy.

265
00:22:20,991 --> 00:22:23,200
You see, power,

266
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:27,908
real power doesn't come to those
who were born strongest,

267
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:30,533
or fastest, or smartest.

268
00:22:31,575 --> 00:22:33,116
No.

269
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,616
It comes to those
who will do anything to achieve it.

270
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:44,158
It's time to let the monster out.

271
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:30,866
They won't see you.

272
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:33,658
Your name's no good now.

273
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,908
My dad says you're a misfit,
and that we can't be friends anymore.

274
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,325
So, why are you out here?

275
00:23:43,575 --> 00:23:45,991
I'm a misfit too, I suppose.

276
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:48,200
What will you do?

277
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:52,700
Join the Talis hammer business, I guess.

278
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:54,408
You can't do that.

279
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:57,741
No, I can't.

280
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:03,283
Come inside, Caitlyn. Now.

281
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,950
I'm sorry. I just wanted to explain...

282
00:24:14,033 --> 00:24:15,575
I think you've done enough.

283
00:24:22,616 --> 00:24:24,533
<i>You said this was a robbery.</i>

284
00:24:24,616 --> 00:24:27,075
- Did they take anything dangerous?
- Hard to say.

285
00:24:27,158 --> 00:24:30,950
We don't exactly know what we did find,
let alone what we didn't.

286
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:34,408
This mention of magic
has the people afraid.

287
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:36,866
The culprits must be apprehended.

288
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,616
We're doing our best, Councilor.
I assure you.

289
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,741
Your attitude makes me question
if your best is up to the task.

290
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:45,616
Oh, we'll find them. Don't worry.

291
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,325
We've conducted exhaustive interrogations,
frozen commerce for half the district.

292
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:52,033
With all due respect, Councilor,

293
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:54,866
don't you think
we've pushed them hard enough?

294
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:57,116
Do whatever it takes.

295
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,908
Turn the undercity upside down
if you have to.

296
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:01,991
Just find them!

297
00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:16,075
Welcome to The Last Drop.

298
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:27,241
- What can I get you?
- Four sump-rats will do.

299
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:30,241
Search the place.

300
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,158
While you're wasting your time,
how about a proper drink?

301
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,450
I'll take the strongest shit you got.

302
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,783
Mm. You be careful with that.

303
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,450
Nearly forgot.
I ran into an old friend of yours.

304
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:49,783
He had some stories.

305
00:26:59,575 --> 00:27:02,158
You weren't always the peacekeeper,
were you?

306
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:09,283
Yeah, well,
you can't escape the past. Right?

307
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:12,658
Be a shame if I had to put them on again.

308
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,325
Cast iron's, well, it's hard to clean.

309
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:13,033
You people down here are all the same,

310
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:15,616
mistaking arrogance for bravery.

311
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,741
You think you're standing up
for something,

312
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:20,408
but we all know there is a crime

313
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,366
behind every coin
that passes through this place.

314
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:30,658
You're just a small man
in a little hole the world forgot to bury.

315
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:34,950
And I'm gonna bury the lot of you.

316
00:28:47,575 --> 00:28:50,283
Are you all okay?

317
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:52,783
No, we're not okay.
They almost saw Powder.

318
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:55,908
- What if they took her?
- No one is taking any of you.

319
00:28:55,991 --> 00:28:59,116
- Never let that happen.
- It's already happening.

320
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,616
You heard him, they won't stop.
We need to fight back.

321
00:29:04,616 --> 00:29:07,700
And if you won't, I will.

322
00:29:10,533 --> 00:29:12,616
I've heard this kind of talk before.

323
00:29:41,075 --> 00:29:42,158
Why are we here?

324
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,908
You still don't understand.

325
00:29:45,991 --> 00:29:49,325
What I don't understand
is how you can work with them.

326
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,741
We were here. We saw what they did.

327
00:29:53,616 --> 00:29:58,866
I grew up knowing I'm less than them,
that my place is down there.

328
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:03,950
I want Powder to have more than that,
and I'm willing to fight for it.

329
00:30:05,283 --> 00:30:10,241
So was I. I was angry, just like you.

330
00:30:10,325 --> 00:30:15,075
I led us across this bridge,
thinking things could change.

331
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,033
If I hadn't...

332
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:21,950
your parents would still be alive.

333
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,366
I know you wanna hurt the topsiders
for what they've done to us.

334
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,741
But who are you willing to lose?

335
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:32,366
Mylo? Claggor?

336
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:34,616
Powder?

337
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:43,991
Nobody wins in war, Vi.

338
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:52,325
What are we gonna do?

339
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:55,283
The Enforcers will come back.

340
00:30:56,991 --> 00:31:02,325
I... I don't know.
I'll, uh, I'll figure it out.

341
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:54,783
Am I interrupting?

342
00:31:58,658 --> 00:32:03,825
The hell's your problem? What's that?
Another list with my name on it?

343
00:32:03,908 --> 00:32:07,991
Actually, yes,
but only because you signed your notes.

344
00:32:08,075 --> 00:32:12,950
Every page, I might add.
Eh, a little egotistical, don't you think?

345
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,575
Is that why you came? To insult me?

346
00:32:16,908 --> 00:32:21,575
No, no, I was... I was intrigued
by what you said at the trial.

347
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:23,408
That makes you the only one.

348
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:25,908
Yes, well, I wanted
to talk about your work.

349
00:32:25,991 --> 00:32:28,658
This Hextech theory of yours.

350
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:30,491
It's not a theory.

351
00:32:30,575 --> 00:32:35,991
I saw with my own eyes what magic can do,
the lives it could save.

352
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:38,950
You've no idea how beautiful it is.

353
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:43,825
And now it's gone. No one believed me.

354
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:46,950
Nobody's ever believed in me.

355
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,533
A poor cripple from the undercity.

356
00:32:51,616 --> 00:32:54,408
I was an outsider the moment
I stepped foot in Piltover.

357
00:32:55,366 --> 00:32:59,158
I didn't have the benefits
of a patron or a name.

358
00:33:00,116 --> 00:33:01,908
I simply believed in myself.

359
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,658
Which is why I'm here
because I think you're on to something.

360
00:33:08,283 --> 00:33:11,116
I want to help you complete your research.

361
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,283
No one thinks it can be done.

362
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:18,366
When you're going to change the world,
don't ask for permission.

363
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:34,533
I don't even know your name.

364
00:33:35,825 --> 00:33:37,116
It's Viktor.

365
00:33:44,616 --> 00:33:47,491
- Vi, where you been?
- Rumor is the Lanes are gonna fight.

366
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,408
Look, I made them for the Enforcers.

367
00:33:56,491 --> 00:33:59,783
These are smoke bombs,
and those two are full of nails.

368
00:34:01,408 --> 00:34:04,033
They're gonna work this time, I know it.

369
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,741
Me too.

370
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:18,575
You know, Powder,
what makes you different makes you strong.

371
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:21,283
Always remember that, okay?

372
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:32,616
What the hell were you thinking,
going into The Last Drop?

373
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,616
- Do you have any idea what you've done?
- I was getting results!

374
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,116
- You heard the Council.
- You're a fool.

375
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,491
There is no stopping what happens now.

376
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:49,325
Maybe it's not too late.
