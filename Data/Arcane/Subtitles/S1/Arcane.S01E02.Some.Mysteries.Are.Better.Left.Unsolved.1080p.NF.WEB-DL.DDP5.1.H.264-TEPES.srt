1
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,125
You really went to the undercity
to get these?

2
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,333
Weren't you afraid?

3
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:33,736
A little danger is worth the risk,
don't you think?

4
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,166
Oh.

5
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,208
Uh, careful.

6
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,166
That's your parents' money
you're dropping.

7
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,166
Powder, we've gotta go!

8
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,916
Hello? Is someone in there?

9
00:00:48,875 --> 00:00:49,875
Hey, open up!

10
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:19,750
Jayce?

11
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:22,833
Jayce!

12
00:01:35,958 --> 00:01:36,958
Mom!

13
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:39,916
Mom. Mom, wake up.

14
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,833
Mom.

15
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,958
Help! Please, someone, help us!

16
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,166
Help! Please!

17
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,125
No. Wait. Wait.

18
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,291
How?

19
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,916
<i>♪ I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that arouse ♪</i>

20
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,958
<i>♪ From my mind to run around

<i>♪ Look out for yourself ♪</i>

35
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,500
Let's go over it again.

36
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,291
You have to believe me.
I didn't do this.

37
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:54,875
Relax, kid. We know it was a break-in
but that doesn't explain this.

38
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,958
There's a lot of restricted items here
and I don't see any permits.

39
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,441
You wanna tell me how you got them?

40
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,291
Hey, hey! Be careful with that, please.

41
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:06,250
I believe someone
should have said that earlier.

42
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,583
What happened here?

43
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,875
Science, I guess?

44
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:15,875
Last time I checked,
science didn't require illegal equipment.

45
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:20,916
Nor was this approved by the Academy.
Who authorized your research?

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,208
It was an independent study.
Who are you anyway?

47
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,583
I'm assistant to the Dean of the Academy,

48
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:29,833
who it may serve you to remember
is also head of the Council.

49
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:34,750
He sent me here to ensure
that anything dangerous is removed safely.

50
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,291
Which, according to my list, includes you.

51
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,458
What? How am I dangerous?

52
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,833
Uh, that's for the council to decide.

53
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,416
Imprisonment. What a curious principle.

54
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,291
We confine the physical body,
yet the mind is still free.

55
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,583
I do love a good conundrum.

56
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,500
I remember the first time
I saw you at the Academy.

57
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:27,416
You reminded me of myself.

58
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,291
A scientist ready to forge
a new vector of experimentation.

59
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:35,958
But sometimes we venture too far.

60
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,625
No great science
should ever put lives in danger.

61
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:43,916
Be honest, now.
What manner of inquiry was this?

62
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,833
Professor Heimerdinger, I...

63
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:48,833
I believe I've discovered
something truly incredible.

64
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,250
A way to harness magic through science.

65
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,250
Magic?

66
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,333
Yes.

67
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:54,458
No.

68
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,458
No?

69
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,750
The Arcane is dangerous, Jayce.

70
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,750
A force of nature.
Science cannot control it.

71
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,291
But maybe it can.

72
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm close to a breakthrough, I know it.

73
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,750
How old are you, my boy?

74
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,375
- I'm... I'm 24.
- Ah.

75
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, I am now 307 years old.

76
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:19,125
All my life,
I've pursued the mysteries of science,

77
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:23,166
only to discover
some are better left unsolved.

78
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,333
This, I'm afraid, is one of them.

79
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:30,375
Own your mistakes before the Council,
admit your work was dangerous,

80
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,208
but speak nothing of magic.

81
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,750
Do that and I theorize you'll get away

82
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,500
with, um, how do you say,
a slap on the wrist.

83
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,541
Remind me why we bother with this dump.

84
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,166
Vander said to lay low.

85
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,583
Enforcers never come down here,
so this is as good a place as any.

86
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:16,375
Oh, what's the matter, Mylo?
You worried Powder's gonna beat you again?

87
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,791
Hey, if she didn't keep
fixing these things,

88
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,958
I wouldn't keep missing.

89
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:34,083
You guys know I wouldn't take you
on a job you couldn't handle, right?

90
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,791
Are you kidding?
That was the best job we've ever done.

91
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,291
Maybe just don't take Powder next time.

92
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,083
Um...

93
00:09:03,416 --> 00:09:05,625
Get back.

94
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,458
- Tell me where I can find them.
- Topsider business ain't my concern.

95
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,916
It's every one
of you trencher's concern now.

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,583
Give me a name.

97
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,916
Hey, guys? You should see this...

98
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:35,958
Search them.

99
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,583
Go ahead, idiots. We've got nothing.

100
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,750
Go!

101
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,125
Go!

102
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,041
Come on!

103
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:29,000
Get them!

104
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:40,333
Over here!

105
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,416
- You need to hide those crystals.
- Yeah, no shit.

106
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:59,000
The House Ferros received your letter.

107
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,708
They insist business is steady.

108
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,500
Steady is stagnant, Elora.

109
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,708
They wished me to remind you
that it's thanks to their innovations

110
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,708
that you are the richest person
in Piltover.

111
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,041
Yet I remain the poorest Medarda.

112
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,666
Excellent choice, Councilor Medarda.
Supreme challenge.

113
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,833
- If I may...
- We need something revolutionary, Elora.

114
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:21,791
Something to put Piltover on the map.

115
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,250
- What of today's trial?
- His name is Jayce of House Talis.

116
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,458
A House? Remind me.

117
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:29,750
They're toolmakers.

118
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,541
I believe they came to renown
for their design of the...

119
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,166
collapsible pocket wrench.

120
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,500
- But Heimerdinger favors him?
- As far as I can tell.

121
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,875
Hmm.

122
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,708
This one.

123
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,875
But that's...

124
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:45,333
Well, that's a child's toy.

125
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:47,916
Good.

126
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,291
The boy's got ambition.

127
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,135
It's why we supported him
in the first place.

128
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,000
Ambition?
Darling, he nearly blew up our daughter.

129
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:01,083
Jayce had nothing
to do with that. He was robbed.

130
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,666
- We need to help him.
- Caitlyn's right.

131
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,666
We've known Jayce for years.
Besides, we're his patrons.

132
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,791
If anyone is meant
to speak up for him, it's us.

133
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,458
We should hit them back.
We've got the numbers to beat them.

134
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:16,625
Yeah. Let's teach them
what it means to mess with us.

135
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,916
Yeah!

136
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,750
- You sure that's what you want?
- Let's do it.

137
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:32,083
We crossed that bridge once before,
and we all know how that ended.

138
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:33,875
You're just protecting your kids.

139
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,083
I'm protecting our people.
I'd do the same for any one of you.

140
00:12:40,166 --> 00:12:43,708
We look out for each other.
It's the way it's always been.

141
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:47,916
This will blow over.
We just need to stand together.

142
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,708
The Vander I knew,
the one who built the underground,

143
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,708
wouldn't be afraid to fight.

144
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,708
- Do I look afraid?
- No.

145
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,833
You look weak.

146
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,666
Why isn't he doing anything?

147
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,333
We kicked the Enforcers' butts
with just the four of us.

148
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,291
Imagine what the whole
of the Lanes could do.

149
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:19,125
- Jeez, even Powder wants to fight.
- So, why aren't we?

150
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,125
Spill it, Ekko.

151
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,125
Um...

152
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:35,833
Oh, okay. Well, um, Vander's got a deal
with the Enforcers.

153
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,500
What deal?

154
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,000
For your birthday, Councilor.

155
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,375
Ah, Mel, this is too kind.

156
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,791
I'm told it was built only
for the sharpest of minds.

157
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,916
And I bought you some Ginko nuts.

158
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,208
Don't you know I'm allergic?

159
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:10,333
What are you trying to do?

160
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,696
Kill an old man?

161
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,791
Jayce Talis.

162
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:53,500
You are accused of illegal experimentation
and endangering the citizens of Piltover.

163
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,166
What do you have to say for yourself?

164
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:04,875
The materials were far more dangerous
than I was aware of,

165
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,583
and I... I now know my actions
were against Academy regulations.

166
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:14,291
What I did endangered people.
It was reckless, and for that, I'm sorry.

167
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:19,375
I ask the Council's forgiveness,
and I hope that I can continue my studies.

168
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,458
As Jayce's patron of many years,
I can speak for his character.

169
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,166
I believe that one day,

170
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,500
he will be a great contributor
to our society.

171
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,666
He destroyed a building.

172
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,333
Is this the sort of contribution
we can expect?

173
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,851
If you were a scientist,

174
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:38,416
you'd know you can't make a prototype
without breaking a few wrenches.

175
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:42,250
Do you have anything to show
for your work besides an explosion?

176
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:44,916
Uh, no. It came to nothing.

177
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,625
So, you're saying
your study was meaningless?

178
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:50,583
- It was revolutionary!
- Revolutionary how?

179
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:54,250
All I see is a boy meddling with things
he doesn't understand.

180
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,041
The Academy seems
to have loosened its standards.

181
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,666
This is a fine line.
If we condone this, what's next?

182
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,958
Ridiculous, really.

183
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,976
The Council has more
important matters to deal with.

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,041
Perhaps we should just finish this...

185
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,833
I was trying to create magic.

186
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Magic?

187
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,750
Arcane talents are something
you're born with.

188
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,000
They can't be fabricated.

189
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,041
Actually, I believe it is possible.

190
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,250
Has anyone even tried it before?

191
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:33,000
The Arcane is the curse of our world.
My race was nearly destroyed by it.

192
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:37,375
Surely, we, the pioneers of science,
can use it for good.

193
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:41,333
We're the champions of discovery.
Why fear it when we can master it?

194
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,416
Jayce, enough.

195
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:46,416
This is the city of progress,
think of the wonders we could create.

196
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,541
- Let me prove...
- Enough!

197
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,875
You don't understand what's at stake.

198
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,375
But how can you?

199
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,541
That's a burden that only I here carry.

200
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,791
Time.

201
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,041
<i>I've seen this power in the wrong hands.</i>

202
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:11,166
<i>It corrupts, consumes,
lays waste to civilizations.</i>

203
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:17,458
That cannot happen here, my boy.
It must not.

204
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,333
Heimerdinger is right.

205
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,916
Piltover was founded to escape
the warmongering of mages,

206
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,250
not cultivate it.

207
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:30,208
The Ethos is clear.
He must be banished from Piltover.

208
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,500
Please, let me speak!

209
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,833
As a lower house, my voice
doesn't carry much weight here.

210
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:46,458
But as a mother,
I have a voice that matters deeply.

211
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,250
My son isn't in his right mind.

212
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:53,958
His entire life,
he's chased an impossible dream.

213
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:59,000
What he did was, uh, foolish and unwise.

214
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:04,208
But he has a good heart.
Please, let him come home.

215
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,666
A crime like this can't be overlooked.
The boy must be punished.

216
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,166
A violation of the Ethos
calls for banishment,

217
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,250
but I can sympathize with a young man's
dream to change the world.

218
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,583
Perhaps in this matter,
a lesser sentence may suffice.

219
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,625
I move that Jayce be summarily expelled
from the Academy

220
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:27,541
and remanded to the care of his parents.

221
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,375
All those in favor?

222
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,958
You may take your son home, Mrs. Talis,

223
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:51,416
but he is to never set foot
on Academy grounds again.

224
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:29,291
First time I've been invited to the Lanes.
It better be worth my time.

225
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,083
Ah, you see, that's your weakness, Marcus.

226
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:37,333
You carry your chin so high,
you fail to see the opportunity below.

227
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,541
Who are you?

228
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,583
You're looking for four children,

229
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,708
the ones running circles
around Piltover's finest.

230
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,041
What about it?

231
00:19:46,708 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't look so concerned.
I'm about to make your day.

232
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:04,416
Can I come in?

233
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,458
Hmm.

234
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,833
I still remember the look on your face
when you found these.

235
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:22,083
Jayce, please. If I hadn't spoken,
you'd be lost to me.

236
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,000
I had to say something.

237
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,833
Magic saved your life.

238
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:33,916
Yes, but it won't save yours now.
You need to let it go.

239
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I could've convinced the Council.

240
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,708
If my own family won't help me,
I'll find someone who will.

241
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,041
Oh. That foolish boy.

242
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:57,250
Yeah, I must admit,
his theory intrigues.

243
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,833
If dangerous ideas
didn't excite the imagination,

244
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,500
we would never wander astray.

245
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:06,541
Could it work? Could these stones
really invoke magic?

246
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,958
Nonsense. It's far too unstable.

247
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,041
Could you stabilize it?

248
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,291
Me? Why would I?

249
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,166
That only leads to more problems,

250
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,458
and that poor boy
has enough of them already.

251
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:22,500
There. Come tomorrow morning,
his research will be safely disposed of.

252
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:24,208
Lock up.

253
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:30,416
No, no, no. Magic is far too dangerous
in the wrong hands.

254
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,625
Will he live?

255
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,875
Long enough.

256
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,666
Beautiful, aren't they?

257
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:55,166
Yet, up there on the surface,

258
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,458
no one even knows they exist.

259
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,666
They're monsters.

260
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:04,958
There's a monster inside all of us.

261
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,583
What? No. No, no! It'll kill me!

262
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,833
I'd like to let you in
on a very important secret

263
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:19,458
I learned when I was about your age, boy.

264
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,500
You see, power,

265
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:28,208
real power doesn't come to those
who were born strongest,

266
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,833
or fastest, or smartest.

267
00:22:31,875 --> 00:22:33,416
No.

268
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,916
It comes to those
who will do anything to achieve it.

269
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:44,458
It's time to let the monster out.

270
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:31,166
They won't see you.

271
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,958
Your name's no good now.

272
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,208
My dad says you're a misfit,
and that we can't be friends anymore.

273
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,625
So, why are you out here?

274
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,291
I'm a misfit too, I suppose.

275
00:23:47,333 --> 00:23:48,500
What will you do?

276
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,000
Join the Talis hammer business, I guess.

277
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,708
You can't do that.

278
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,041
No, I can't.

279
00:24:00,416 --> 00:24:03,583
Come inside, Caitlyn. Now.

280
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,250
I'm sorry. I just wanted to explain...

281
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:15,875
I think you've done enough.

282
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:24,833
<i>You said this was a robbery.</i>

283
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:27,375
- Did they take anything dangerous?
- Hard to say.

284
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:31,250
We don't exactly know what we did find,
let alone what we didn't.

285
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:34,708
This mention of magic
has the people afraid.

286
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,166
The culprits must be apprehended.

287
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,916
We're doing our best, Councilor.
I assure you.

288
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,041
Your attitude makes me question
if your best is up to the task.

289
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,916
Oh, we'll find them. Don't worry.

290
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,625
We've conducted exhaustive interrogations,
frozen commerce for half the district.

291
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,333
With all due respect, Councilor,

292
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:55,166
don't you think
we've pushed them hard enough?

293
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,416
Do whatever it takes.

294
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,208
Turn the undercity upside down
if you have to.

295
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,291
Just find them!

296
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:16,375
Welcome to The Last Drop.

297
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:27,541
- What can I get you?
- Four sump-rats will do.

298
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:30,541
Search the place.

299
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:38,458
While you're wasting your time,
how about a proper drink?

300
00:25:38,541 --> 00:25:40,750
I'll take the strongest shit you got.

301
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,083
Mm. You be careful with that.

302
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:47,750
Nearly forgot.
I ran into an old friend of yours.

303
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,083
He had some stories.

304
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,458
You weren't always the peacekeeper,
were you?

305
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:09,583
Yeah, well,
you can't escape the past. Right?

306
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:12,958
Be a shame if I had to put them on again.

307
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,625
Cast iron's, well, it's hard to clean.

308
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:13,333
You people down here are all the same,

309
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:15,916
mistaking arrogance for bravery.

310
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,041
You think you're standing up
for something,

311
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,708
but we all know there is a crime

312
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,666
behind every coin
that passes through this place.

313
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:30,958
You're just a small man
in a little hole the world forgot to bury.

314
00:28:33,166 --> 00:28:35,250
And I'm gonna bury the lot of you.

315
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,583
Are you all okay?

316
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:53,083
No, we're not okay.
They almost saw Powder.

317
00:28:53,166 --> 00:28:56,208
- What if they took her?
- No one is taking any of you.

318
00:28:56,291 --> 00:28:59,416
- Never let that happen.
- It's already happening.

319
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,916
You heard him, they won't stop.
We need to fight back.

320
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:08,000
And if you won't, I will.

321
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,916
I've heard this kind of talk before.

322
00:29:41,375 --> 00:29:42,458
Why are we here?

323
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,208
You still don't understand.

324
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:49,625
What I don't understand
is how you can work with them.

325
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,041
We were here. We saw what they did.

326
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:59,166
I grew up knowing I'm less than them,
that my place is down there.

327
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:04,250
I want Powder to have more than that,
and I'm willing to fight for it.

328
00:30:05,583 --> 00:30:10,541
So was I. I was angry, just like you.

329
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:15,375
I led us across this bridge,
thinking things could change.

330
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,333
If I hadn't...

331
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:22,250
your parents would still be alive.

332
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:27,666
I know you wanna hurt the topsiders
for what they've done to us.

333
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:30,041
But who are you willing to lose?

334
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:32,666
Mylo? Claggor?

335
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,916
Powder?

336
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:44,291
Nobody wins in war, Vi.

337
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:52,625
What are we gonna do?

338
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,583
The Enforcers will come back.

339
00:30:57,291 --> 00:31:02,625
I... I don't know.
I'll, uh, I'll figure it out.

340
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:55,083
Am I interrupting?

341
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:04,125
The hell's your problem? What's that?
Another list with my name on it?

342
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:08,291
Actually, yes,
but only because you signed your notes.

343
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:13,250
Every page, I might add.
Eh, a little egotistical, don't you think?

344
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,875
Is that why you came? To insult me?

345
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:21,875
No, no, I was... I was intrigued
by what you said at the trial.

346
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,708
That makes you the only one.

347
00:32:23,791 --> 00:32:26,208
Yes, well, I wanted
to talk about your work.

348
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,958
This Hextech theory of yours.

349
00:32:29,041 --> 00:32:30,791
It's not a theory.

350
00:32:30,875 --> 00:32:36,291
I saw with my own eyes what magic can do,
the lives it could save.

351
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:39,250
You've no idea how beautiful it is.

352
00:32:40,666 --> 00:32:44,125
And now it's gone. No one believed me.

353
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,250
Nobody's ever believed in me.

354
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,833
A poor cripple from the undercity.

355
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,708
I was an outsider the moment
I stepped foot in Piltover.

356
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:59,458
I didn't have the benefits
of a patron or a name.

357
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,208
I simply believed in myself.

358
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,958
Which is why I'm here
because I think you're on to something.

359
00:33:08,583 --> 00:33:11,416
I want to help you complete your research.

360
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,583
No one thinks it can be done.

361
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,666
When you're going to change the world,
don't ask for permission.

362
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,833
I don't even know your name.

363
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,416
It's Viktor.

364
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:47,791
- Vi, where you been?
- Rumor is the Lanes are gonna fight.

365
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:56,708
Look, I made them for the Enforcers.

366
00:33:56,791 --> 00:34:00,083
These are smoke bombs,
and those two are full of nails.

367
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:04,333
They're gonna work this time, I know it.

368
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,041
Me too.

369
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,875
You know, Powder,
what makes you different makes you strong.

370
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,583
Always remember that, okay?

371
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:32,916
What the hell were you thinking,
going into The Last Drop?

372
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,916
- Do you have any idea what you've done?
- I was getting results!

373
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,416
- You heard the Council.
- You're a fool.

374
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,791
There is no stopping what happens now.

375
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,625
Maybe it's not too late.
