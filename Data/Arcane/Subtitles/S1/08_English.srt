1
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:40,416
When I was ten,

2
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,583
your grandfather brought me
to the aftermath

3
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,333
of the Battle of Hildenard.

4
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:49,458
He offered me a gold coin for every blade
I retrieved from the fallen.

5
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,458
Said we needed the steel.

6
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,583
But I knew it was a lie.

7
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:57,791
He wanted me to know death.

8
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:02,000
Kino says war is a failure of statecraft.

9
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:04,541
Your brother thinks
he can talk his way out of anything.

10
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,791
He fancies himself a fox among the wolves.

11
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:10,708
But mark me, child,
if you want to last in this world,

12
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:14,958
you must learn to be both the fox
and the wolf.

13
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,125
We'll paint the walls in gold.

14
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,041
Import crystal chandeliers.

15
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,208
Advisors will enter here,

16
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:28,208
but the regent
will have her own, secret entrance.

17
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,041
She should have a kind, fat face.

18
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:36,500
Clever, to charm her subjects,
but pliable so we can mold her.

19
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:38,333
Perhaps, she could be my daughter.

20
00:01:39,166 --> 00:01:40,958
You'd give me a throne?

21
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:46,750
I will give you the world, child,
if you prove you can take it.

22
00:01:59,916 --> 00:02:01,458
What should we do with her?

23
00:02:08,208 --> 00:02:10,000
She won't make trouble for us.

24
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:14,000
Strip her of her possessions
and send her to the far colonies.

25
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,500
-She's a symbol of the old regime.

26
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:23,291
Kill her now,
and only one must die.

27
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,166
Let her live and you may need
to kill thousands.

28
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,041
We can show the people we are merciful.

29
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,708
A wolf has no mercy.

30
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,791
-Will you be okay?

31
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,541
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

32
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,625
{\an8}Jinx!

33
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:03,750
It's gone.

34
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,750
What?

35
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,375
<i>It was all for nothing.</i>

36
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,875
{\an8}

37
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:07,208
{\an8}

38
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:14,125
{\an8}

39
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,416
{\an8}

40
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,750
{\an8}

41
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,833
Sir, we've secured the area.

42
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:56,000
I've got orders to escort you
back into the city.

43
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:57,875
Sir?

44
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,333
Are you all right?

45
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:43,291
Who lives here?
Another Councilor friend of yours?

46
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,333
Caitlyn!

47
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:52,833
Oh. We were so worried.
Thank goodness you're safe!

48
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,250
And you found a stray.

49
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,333
This is Vi.

50
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,083
She's from the undercity.

51
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,208
So I see.

52
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,083
Could we have a word, Caitlyn?

53
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,000
In private.

54
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,250
You have to speak
to the Council.

55
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,083
Speak to the Council?

56
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,583
You understand you've broken several laws?

57
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,791
She was doing what she thought was right.

58
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:21,166
I'll take responsibility.

59
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,041
You're a Councilor's daughter.

60
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:25,416
Your actions reflect on the entire body.

61
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
My actions?

62
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,708
{\an8}You know what else
reflects on the Council?

63
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,791
{\an8}Its citizens living on the streets.
Being poisoned.

64
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,625
Having to choose between a kingpin
who wants to exploit them

65
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,000
and a government that doesn't give a shit.

66
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,333
-Caitlyn!

67
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,250
I'm sure our daughter could use
some rest after her adventures.

68
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,791
-I'll schedule an audience.

69
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,458
Thank you.

70
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,958
You and your friend
can address the Council yourselves.

71
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,916
I'd suggest you prepare accordingly.

72
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,583
-Her injuries are severe.
-You think I can't see that?

73
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:30,250
Huh.

74
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:36,000
I believe I can save her,
but the process will be demanding.

75
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:39,250
-Sometimes death is a mercy.

76
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,458
She can take it.

77
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:43,625
And before I begin, I must knowâ€¦

78
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:46,541
Are you prepared to lose her?

79
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,041
-Jinx?

80
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,833
-Jinx!

81
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:58,458
She won't die, Doctor.

82
00:08:58,541 --> 00:08:59,666
She can't.

83
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,166
I understand.

84
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,625
Please understand,
this is for your own sanity.

85
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,750
I, too, once had a daughter.

86
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,500
Silco isn't taking guests.

87
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,708
Not a problem.

88
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:40,500
Wasn't here for him.
Thought I might bend your ear.

89
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,416
You know when I ask my mates
what Silco's up to,

90
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,166
your name's first out of their mouths.

91
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,250
"Sevika's out in the harbor,"
or "Sevika paid the knuckleheads a visit."

92
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,625
You're a scary lady.

93
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,000
Get to your point.

94
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,708
Run a tight ship, don't you?

95
00:10:01,791 --> 00:10:03,916
Except it's not your ship.

96
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,708
It's his and Jinx's.

97
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:08,416
This is your plan?

98
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,708
Undermine Silco
by making a half-assed play at my ego?

99
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,791
Gotta hand it to you, Finn.

100
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,791
Every time I think you can't get dumber,
you dig a new low.

101
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,416
Let's be plain, then. He's slipping.

102
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,666
The undercity's devolving to chaos.

103
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,250
And somehow, I get the feeling
he isn't up there balancing booksheets.

104
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,541
Jinx gets a whim,
suddenly his spine's made of jelly.

105
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:35,541
And here you are, shoveling his shit.

106
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,041
Ego is one thing, brain's another.

107
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:49,500
You aren't the only one dissatisfied
with his performance.

108
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,958
There's bigger fish than Silco.

109
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:31,000
Mel. Elora.
You didn't have to come out to meet me.

110
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,958
-What are you doing here, Mother?
-Can I not visit?

111
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,541
I've heard stories
of Piltover's hospitality.

112
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,625
You didn't sail halfway across
the continent to sample the local cuisine.

113
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,208
-It's been over a decade, Mel.
-Since you banished me?

114
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,791
Such drama.

115
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,708
I sent you here to oversee
our family's interests and grow yourself.

116
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:51,791
Which you have.

117
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:55,333
You said, "Perhaps, your sentimentality
will be more at home

118
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,166
with those soft-spined
idealists overseas."

119
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,833
You have your father's memory.

120
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,083
Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me.

121
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,416
-Mel.
-Or that.

122
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,750
Your brother's gone.

123
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,375
What happened?

124
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,958
He crossed the wrong man.

125
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,083
I was distracted.

126
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,500
That's a mistake I can't take back.

127
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,916
Your Jayce Talis has turned his eye
to Hextech weaponry.

128
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,666
I knew it.

129
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,291
War is coming.

130
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,375
You've let the problems
of your undercity fester too long.

131
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:43,000
Piltover isn't like Noxus.

132
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,000
War isn't our first and every recourse.

133
00:12:46,083 --> 00:12:50,416
I sponsored Hextech to protect the city,
not burn it to the ground.

134
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,208
It's not conjecture, it's a fact.

135
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:57,083
Weapons can't be unmade
and they are always used.

136
00:12:57,166 --> 00:13:00,958
I'm here to help guide you
to the right decisions.

137
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:04,625
-I don't need your guidance.
-We'll see.

138
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,666
Miss Medarda?

139
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:09,708
-Yes?
-Yes?

140
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,791
He's for me, dear.

141
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,375
I'm off to sample the local cuisine.

142
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:37,791
We'll present our case
to the Council tonight.

143
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,833
You did all this yourself?

144
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,208
Without even going down there?

145
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,958
And I thought Powder could get obsessed.

146
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,958
What happened to her, it's not your fault.

147
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,875
When my parents were still aliveâ€¦

148
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:05,666
me and Powder
used to share a bed like this.

149
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,166
Except, maybe, half the size.

150
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:15,208
We played a game where we pretended
to be bigger and bigger monsters.

151
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:21,125
So she would say, "I'm a slug monster
with venom for ooze."

152
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:26,833
And I'd say, "Well, I'm a slug-eating crab
with razor spikes."

153
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:33,750
Sometimes, Iâ€¦ I'd get carried away
and she'd get scared.

154
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,416
I didn't want her to start crying
and wake my parents up, soâ€¦

155
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,333
I pretended to chase my own monsters away.

156
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:44,833
I'd sayâ€¦

157
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
"No monster's gonna get you
when I'm here."

158
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,958
Then a real monster showed up.

159
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,333
And I just ran away.

160
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,750
I left her.

161
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,500
You know, Powder,
you're stronger than you think.

162
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,083
Vi?

163
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,791
<i>I'm so sorry, Powder.</i>

164
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,291
-<i>Your sister is jinx.</i>
-No!

165
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:41,125
<i>Jinx.</i>

166
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,041
No, no. No!

167
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,250
I understand this must be painful.

168
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,166
No!

169
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,416
-I'm afraid it will only get worse.
-Wait!

170
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:56,833
No!

171
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,041
What have you done?

172
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,791
I saved her life.

173
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,791
Hey, watch it, furball.

174
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,416
Move.

175
00:17:26,583 --> 00:17:27,666
Oh.

176
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:29,541
Hmm.

177
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:32,041
-Hmm.

178
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,791
Huh?

179
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,541
Hmmâ€¦

180
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:40,208
Like this.

181
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,625
Get away from her.

182
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,208
Byeâ€¦

183
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,500
Oh, ingenious.

184
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,250
Though these blades
seem improperly pitched.

185
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,250
You're wrong.

186
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,750
It's designed for the fissures.

187
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,833
The air is denser.

188
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,750
Oh.

189
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,125
-Are you all right, lad?

190
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,583
Yeah, I'm fine, I just sprained my ankle.

191
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,291
Are you Councilor Heimerdinger?

192
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,875
It's just Heimerdinger now.

193
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:35,208
What are you doing
on this side of the river?

194
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,166
I wanted to offer my assistance

195
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,458
to the citizens of the undercity, butâ€¦

196
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,958
it seems I'm unwelcome.

197
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,083
-What is it?
-We're having the exact same day.

198
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:55,291
That looks like more than a sprain.
You need medical attention.

199
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:58,583
I have to get home.
It isn't safe for me here.

200
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:03,208
I don't know how I'm gonna get there
with my leg busted, and, wellâ€¦

201
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,083
you're holding my ride.

202
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,458
Do they teach military history
at your Academy, Mr. Talis?

203
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,500
It's, um, Councilor Talis.

204
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,791
And I'm not sure.

205
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,333
The Alornian General
Sonnem Parlec

206
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:32,333
used to find ways
to meet his enemies blindfolded.

207
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:35,666
He said a man's mind
hides behind his body.

208
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,666
Somehow, I doubt he ever tried this.

209
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:40,541
You're Mel's mom.

210
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,625
Among other things.

211
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,375
Squeeze, child.
You won't break it.

212
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,666
I do have other matters,
so if you'll excuse meâ€¦

213
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,916
The threat
of the undercity is real.

214
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,250
-Your leadership is impotent.

215
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,583
We may not be Noxus, but Piltover
isn't as helpless as you think.

216
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,500
Who said anything about Piltover?

217
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,666
The Council is the problem.
The mind hiding behind the body.

218
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,000
Navigating your current crisis
requires expertise you lack.

219
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,083
Do you know what the success rate
for senior Academy inventors is?

220
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,250
Three percent.

221
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,708
We're no strangers to failure.

222
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:20,416
What makes this the City of Progress is
that we keep trying until we get it right.

223
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,875
So thank you for your advice,
Mrs. Medarda, but I have a city to run.

224
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,208
Wait.

225
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,291
I see why this province
and my daughter have fallen for you.

226
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:37,833
You have the passion of youth.

227
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,000
I have experience.

228
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:44,958
I want you to succeed here, Jayce,
to grace the world with Hextech.

229
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,833
But if you don't accept certain realities,
I fear you'll end up like General Parlec.

230
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,750
Slaughtered with your eyes closed.

231
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,458
Three of my suppliers have said

232
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,958
they intend to delay shipments until fall

233
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,208
to give things "time to cool off."

234
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,708
We have greater concerns
than a dip in profits.

235
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:08,666
The Sheriff betrayed us.
We need better information.

236
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,250
We need to act.
Before anyone else gets killed.

237
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,375
Perhaps Marcus
was operating independently.

238
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,791
What could anyone in the undercity
offer him that he didn't have up here?

239
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,500
It's not what they offered him,

240
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,875
it's what he had to lose.

241
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,166
Councilors, my daughter
has a unique insight into our situation.

242
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,666
Thank you.

243
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,791
Councilors, this is Vi.
She was born in the undercity.

244
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:38,291
Even though we failed her
in countless ways,

245
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:42,291
she risked everything to show me
what life is really like down there.

246
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:46,625
People are starving, sick,
ravaged by Shimmer.

247
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,916
They live in constant fear

248
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,750
of the coordinated efforts
of violent crime lords.

249
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,041
One man leads these efforts.

250
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:55,208
Silco.

251
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,458
We've done investigations of Silco.

252
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,166
They yielded no such level
of organization.

253
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,291
And who led these investigations?

254
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,791
What does this Silco even want from us?

255
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:09,625
He believes the undercity
should be independent.

256
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,791
He calls it the Nation of Zaun.

257
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,708
What about these?
Do you know who made them?

258
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,416
No, wellâ€¦

259
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,166
-Uhâ€¦
-Her name is Jinx.

260
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,291
This Jinx has the Gemstone?

261
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:27,333
-Then we have to go in by force.
-That could trigger war.

262
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:30,708
-There are good people down there.
-Hmph. Bad ones too.

263
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,750
Even if we wanted to invade,
they have Shimmer.

264
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:35,750
We have Hextech.

265
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:37,625
What happened to you?

266
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:40,375
We've been talking about talking
for weeks now.

267
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,666
They're still cleaning the blood
off the bridge.

268
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,750
-When do we say enough is enough?
-Jayce, you don't know war.

269
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,208
I do.

270
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:52,083
It must be our last resort.
There may be a diplomatic solution.

271
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,791
She's right.

272
00:23:02,208 --> 00:23:04,625
What? You want to negotiate with him?

273
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,666
It may be the only way
to avoid further bloodshed.

274
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,958
This is insane.
Did you learn nothing?

275
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,000
You can't talk to him!

276
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:16,208
He hates you. Everything you stand for.

277
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,833
He will never back down.

278
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,500
-Enforcers, please escort them out.
-Forget it.

279
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:27,916
I remember
where your fancy damn door is.

280
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:41,875
Vi! Wait!

281
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,875
Wait! Where are you going?

282
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:47,041
I don't know. Back where I came from?

283
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:49,416
Seems like that's
what everyone up here wants.

284
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,625
-I can fix this.
-You can't!

285
00:23:51,708 --> 00:23:54,416
This is how things are.
How they've always been.

286
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,000
I was so stupid to think it could change.

287
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,958
There must be something else
we can do. Some other way.

288
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:03,291
We'll make a new plan. We have to try.

289
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,541
We tried. Okay? It wasn't enough.

290
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:09,833
Topside and bottom. Oil and water.
That's all there is.

291
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:11,833
What about us?

292
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,458
Oil and water.

293
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,208
Wasn't meant to be.

294
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:22,208
-You're just saying that.
-Do yourself a favor, Cupcake.

295
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:26,750
Go back to that big,
shiny house of yours and justâ€¦

296
00:24:27,958 --> 00:24:30,500
forget me, okay?

297
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:35,708
Viktor, I've been working
on a private project

298
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,125
for a couple weeks now.

299
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,833
No.

300
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,333
Viktor, I've been working on this
for a year now andâ€¦

301
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:01,666
Viktor.

302
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:17,833
Viktor, I was hoping you might take a look
at something I've been working on.

303
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,250
Viktorâ€¦

304
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,791
I was inspired by yourâ€¦

305
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,208
Everything you do inspires me.

306
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:39,666
Viktor!

307
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,625
Viktor!

308
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:29,750
Sky? Sky? No.

309
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:33,333
No! Thatâ€¦ that can'tâ€¦ that can'tâ€¦

310
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:19,083
You want to make Silco pay
for what he's done?

311
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,000
I could have you arrested.

312
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,750
You guys really like
to bandy that threat around.

313
00:28:25,458 --> 00:28:27,333
You ever been to Stillwater?

314
00:28:27,416 --> 00:28:29,041
-No.

315
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:32,375
So you just wave an arm,
have someone dragged off,

316
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,750
don't bother to find out
what it does to someone

317
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:39,166
being stuffed in a stone box
for weeks, or months, or even years?

318
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:45,458
-Yeah. I want to make Silco pay.
-I want in.

319
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:47,166
There is no in.

320
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:49,916
-You heard the Council.
-Fuck the Council.

321
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,625
You said you were tired of doing nothing.

322
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,916
That's the only sensible thing
that came out of anyone's mouth tonight.

323
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,791
I'm not a vigilante.

324
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:59,333
No, you're a victim.

325
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:05,291
-Huhâ€¦

326
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,958
This so people notice you when you
raise your hand in the boardroom?

327
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:16,833
-We built them for mining the fissures.

328
00:29:16,916 --> 00:29:18,541
-Hmm.

329
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:20,791
Someone close to me had a pair of these.

330
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:26,250
You're the first person Caitlyn
looked for when we made it to topside.

331
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:28,208
Of everyone up here,

332
00:29:28,291 --> 00:29:31,500
you're the one she trusted
to do something.

333
00:29:35,166 --> 00:29:37,500
What do you want me to do? Arrest him?

334
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,375
Silco controls
the undercity with Shimmer.

335
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,916
Shut down his supply,

336
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,125
and it's only a matter of time
before his own people turn on him.

337
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,375
And how do we do that?

338
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:48,500
Take out
his manufacturing facilities.

339
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:51,000
Hit them hard and fast,
before he can react.

340
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:56,791
Soâ€¦

341
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:59,583
We got a deal, pretty boy?

342
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,666
-Come on.
-Over the bridge.

343
00:30:39,375 --> 00:30:40,375
Secured!

344
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,416
Get back!

345
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,875
You little punk.

346
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,208
Hey!

347
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,041
-Hmm.

348
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,083
Hmm.
