1
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,780
This is the year 1332.

2
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,960
It has been seven years since the wedding of Casimirus and Anna.

3
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,460
The couple has already got two daughters, Elizabeth and Kunegunda.

4
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,310
There is a war between Poland
and the Teutonic Order,

5
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:51,160
and John of Bohemia makes a
claim to the Polish crown.

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,286
Despite the victory at
the battle of Plowce,

7
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,460
king Vladislav loses
Kuyavia and Dobrzyn Land,

8
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,260
and the Czech king effortlessly made vassals of Silesian and Mazovian princes,

9
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,920
who invade the lands of the kingdom of Poland.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Vladislav and Casimirus retaliate against them.

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,520
After two years of war expedition, the father and the son return to Krakow...

12
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Lord, I thank you for their happy return.

13
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
I thank you for my children.

14
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Thank you for Casimirus, for his wife,

15
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
for their two daughters.

16
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,500
Oh Lord, you know how much Vladislav wanted to regain his home land.

17
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
He wanted so much.

18
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,500
And it didn't happen...

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Why?

20
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Why didn't you help him?

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why are you angry?

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,840
All right! It's beautiful, leave it!

23
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,000
You haven't seen your husband for so long, my lady.

24
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,460
And he hasn't seen you.

25
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,430
You have to look beautiful.

26
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,900
Don't punish us, Lord!

27
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,600
I beg you!

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,600
Help us finish the reunification. 

29
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,900
And protect my son, Casimirus.

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,700
Mom, quickly, we're running to greet Daddy!

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,720
How ugly!

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,720
Mom, what is it?

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,720
It's Givate, the good snake, the guardian of the forest.

34
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,720
In my country, Lithuania, people believe it has got special powers.

35
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,990
You mustn't believe in such things! You go to hell for it!

36
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,540
But it's not a sin to know where you're from

37
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,540
it's only a childhood souvenir.

38
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:20,040
and Christ died on the cross for all people, including Lithuanians.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,200
You're waiting for someone too, aren't you?

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,700
For my father.

41
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,140
Grandma!

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,140
Daddy and Grandpa have returned from the war.

43
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:44,140
Let's go to town to greet them!

44
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,140
You can't go to town now, but

45
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,740
you'll be invited to the welcome ceremony.

46
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,000
I promise...

47
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,540
But Grandma, why?

48
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,540
Girls, we have to prepare...

49
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,540
- I am prepared!
- But we have to correct it, come on.

50
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,830
- Please, come.
- No, no!

51
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,820
Anna...

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,180
Dress more modestly

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,180
There will be a ceremony

54
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,180
My lady, it's for the return of my beloved husband!

55
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,180
I understand, but you don't want him to think

56
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,880
you dressed like this when he was away.

57
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,480
Change this dress, please.

58
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,880
Is this Dad?

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,080
Yes, darling.

60
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
He didn't have a beard.

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
At war there's no time to shave.

62
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,990
Daddy!

63
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,990
Daddy, you were away for so long!

64
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,740
Don't fear.

65
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,740
Don't fear of anyone. Never!

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where's your sister?

67
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,740
Jadwiga!

68
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,260
Greetings, my wife!

69
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Mother!

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,820
Greetings, son!

71
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,940
Pax vobiscum!

72
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Thanks to God!

73
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,640
For the victories over the lords of Glogow.

74
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,620
for the capture of Koscian.

75
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,920
For defeating the Silesian princes.

76
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,620
Mother of Jesus Christ, the king of Nazareth.

77
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,620
Save the king of Poland,

78
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,320
Save his son, Casimirus

79
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:20,380
<i>/praying in Latin/</i>

80
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
- I'm going to the girls.
- Good. Dance.

81
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,980
Pelka, who's that girl?

82
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Be careful.

83
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,580
She's not married?

84
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,580
It's my daughter.

85
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,980
I am Niewieza of Golcza, the royal knight.

86
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,760
At dusk, there will be a tournament. I'll win it for you.

87
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,340
Let me be your knight.

88
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,220
Look... I conquered a duchy

89
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:34,220
and I'm to weak to get up.

90
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,220
I'll help you.

91
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,220
Lean on my arm. Come.

92
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,750
Vladislav!

93
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:49,450
Vladislav!

94
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,020
I want you to give me a son.

95
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The heir.

96
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,060
So come to my bed tonight.

97
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
You've been away for two years.

98
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
At war, I got unused from gallantry.

99
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,460
But you captured Koscian, and the whole of Krakow is talking about it.

100
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,000
I won't boast about it.

101
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why not?

102
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,300
My father says

103
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
a modest ruler means a weak country.

104
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
And a cruel ruler?

105
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
I murdered like a butcher.

106
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,340
And a good ruler means a big war.

107
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,720
So, let's drink for war!

108
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,220
Lady!

109
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Don't tell me... Don't tell me it's now...

110
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,820
It's... It's a bit better...

111
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
but the end is near...

112
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,780
The king reconciled with God...

113
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,300
Nobody can learn

114
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
about the king's illness...

115
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Even the pope...

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,810
Only our children....

117
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,870
The king and queen are not here...

118
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,870
And your mother keeps an eye on me all the time...

119
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Casimirus...

120
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Your father is asking to see you.

121
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,340
I have visitors.

122
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,040
And where's the king?

123
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Aren't he and his son preparing a new war?

124
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,860
The bishop of Krakow should know such things best.

125
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,910
They don't listen to the bishop.

126
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,610
Your husband slaughtered more than a hundred people in Koscian.

127
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,610
The king forbid it

128
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,990
but he went with the Hungarians and wiped them out.

129
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,890
Knights, Silesians, Czechs, Germans...

130
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,490
He spared nobody.

131
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,490
He slaughtered noblemen like cattle.

132
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,000
And what?

133
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The town treasury was empty.

134
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What victory is that?

135
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Forgive me, bishop, but I'm going to dance.

136
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,660
Do you find people's death amusing?

137
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,260
I find your hypocrisy appalling.

138
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,260
Time has come for me, my son...

139
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,990
No, Father, not yet...

140
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,990
I've always been proud of you

141
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,990
I've never shown it to you.

142
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,990
but I've been...

143
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,990
Be a proud king

144
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
Good and proud.

145
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,240
I'll never be the king like you.

146
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,240
You will.

147
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
You'll be better.

148
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
You'll be great.

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,820
I'll never achieve what you did.

150
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,420
You regained the crown.

151
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,420
And you'll keep it.

152
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,420
You'll regain the lands which I couldn't regain.

153
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:42,000
You'll be a great king.

154
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Father!

155
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
Father!

156
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:56,480
I saw how the prince greeted his wife upon his return.

157
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,180
He wasn't very effusive...

158
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,180
But she's his wife...

159
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Because of this marriage we have peace in the east.

160
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,180
And, in spite of this...

161
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,440
In spite of this, aren't you happy, my lady

162
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,440
your son is Gediminas' daughter's husband?

163
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,440
I've never really accepted this.

164
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Never.

165
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
But there's nothing you can do now.

166
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,940
You're wrong. I can.

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I may not allow her to be crowned

168
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
when Casimirus becomes the king.

169
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,500
I'm wearing the crown.

170
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
Can I disagree to this?

171
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I can!

172
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,000
Promise that when you're the queen, there will be more fun like this.

173
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Do you like to play so much? Where's your knight?

174
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,100
He's getting ready for the tournament.

175
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,400
So, go, you have to be there, have fun, because lent is coming soon

176
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
and only prayers and mortification.

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Thank you, my lady.

178
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,500
Wait!

179
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,700
First, find Egla and tell her to come here.

180
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Yes, my lady.

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,500
Let's summon a medic.

182
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,920
The Benedictines of Tyniec can cure with herbs.

183
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,120
We can't summon anyone, this is the king's will.

184
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Nobody can know of his ailment.

185
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Even your wife.

186
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
He fell so suddenly.

187
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
It may be witchcraft.

188
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Maybe someone bewitched him.

189
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
Since when do you believe in superstition?

190
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,620
You'd better pray for your father's health.

191
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,620
We need to bring your sisters.

192
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,620
You tell me to hide my father's condition from my wife

193
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,620
and you want to the Hungarian king know?

194
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,950
Not the king, but the queen.

195
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,950
Your sister, Elizabeth.

196
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,550
And Kunegunda will tell you

197
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,000
what's happening in Silesia.

198
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,800
What are the Czech king's intentions?

199
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,240
And you believe the sisters will keep the secret?

200
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
And our envoys?

201
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,720
You choose them - it will be your first decision.

202
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,220
It may decide your whole life.

203
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,220
Your future crown.

204
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
Why am I to say nothing to Anna?

205
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,220
Because there are two rulers on Earth.

206
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,220
who, for sure, mustn't know of the father's illness

207
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,000
The master of the Teutonic Order and the great prince of Lithuania.

208
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,800
- Your wife's father.
- No,no,no...

209
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,200
Anna will suspect something's wrong with the father.

210
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,000
It all depends on you.

211
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You don't have to tell her everything

212
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Be cautious.

213
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Are there people you trust?

214
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes.

215
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
So bring them.

216
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,000
And act...

217
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,260
Egle, are you sure the king's dying?

218
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,260
I knew they're hiding something from me.

219
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,260
Not only from you. They're hiding it from everybody.

220
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,360
Because they're afraid.

221
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,760
Yes, they are afraid that the enemies may learn about the king's illness.

222
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,660
Do you know what Jadwiga said?

223
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,060
That as long as she's alive, I won't be crowned.

224
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,760
You understand, Egle? I won't be the queen!

225
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,760
If I was the mother of the king's heir, I would be safe.

226
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,560
but, until I bear a son, I may be got rid of, sent away.

227
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,560
And even killed.

228
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,760
Egle, I need advice. What to do? How to defend myself?

229
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,200
You can't do it alone.

230
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,600
And your husband obeys his mother

231
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,900
My husband wouldn't let me get hurt.

232
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,600
But could he defend you?

233
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,200
Don't ask questions but tell me what to do!

234
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,800
Algirdas, your brother.

235
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,710
I don't understand?

236
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,010
Summon him to come here.

237
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,010
Let's say, to visit his sister.

238
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,610
You'll be safe with him by your side.

239
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,910
But how to let him know?

240
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,910
Only a trusted person can go to Lithuania.

241
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,710
You will go to Silesia, to my sister, Kunegunda.

242
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,010
And you, Pelka, to Visegrad, to the Hungarian queen, my sister, Elizabeth.

243
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,550
Nobody can learn about our mission. Nobody!

244
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,550
You'll carry letters.

245
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,550
They can't fall into the wrong hands.

246
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:13,450
You have to deliver them to my sisters in person, understand?

247
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,450
And when do we depart?

248
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,450
Today, immediately.

249
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,450
- But...
 - What? Are you scared?

250
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,450
No!

251
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,450
So...

252
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,980
The fight is between

253
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,980
Stan of Kokorzyn

254
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,580
and Niemieza of Golcza.

255
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Niemieza of Golcza?

256
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Is he here, or is he a coward?

257
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Wait here!

258
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,620
I lost my honour.

259
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,620
I didn't stand the ground.

260
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,620
They called me a coward.

261
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,620
And now I can't even explain why I did it.

262
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,620
You're given a secret mission in the king's service.

263
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,620
This is a great honour.

264
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,020
Have you sent for the sisters?

265
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,020
Elias is finishing the letters

266
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,020
They'll go soon.

267
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,820
They say you flinched at Plowce.

268
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,820
That you fled the battlefield...

269
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,520
They don't want to believe I ordered to send you away.

270
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,920
It was my mistake.

271
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,100
Don't let them call you a coward...

272
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,100
-Never.
- I won't let them.

273
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,100
And now, the death of the Zachs...

274
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,980
Unnecessary evil...

275
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,480
Unnecessary evil is pure evil.

276
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,380
Koscian is a different story...

277
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,380
It's war...

278
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,380
But the death of the Zachs'?

279
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,100
The eyes of the murdered will haunt you in your dreams.

280
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,580
Then, when you wake up, 

281
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,880
think of the crown.

282
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,480
It'll give you some relief.

283
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
And remember, 

284
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
You're the king of blood

285
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
and this obliges.

286
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,120
I'll probably go to the monastery.

287
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,660
What happened?

288
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,640
My knight didn't turn up for the fight. What embarrassment!

289
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,240
Oh well... Terrible, really!

290
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,640
Before you go to the monastery because of this, go to the kitchen and call my cook.

291
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,640
You're hungry, my lady. I'll fetch something.

292
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Cudka... 

293
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,440
Don't look for Niemieza, but bring the cook.

294
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,940
My king, it's ready. The seal.

295
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,500
On this sword...

296
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,500
on which king Vladislav made a pledge to the Polish crown.

297
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,700
You swear...

298
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,700
not to disclose to anybody

299
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
that the king lies ill in bed,

300
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
never to disclose to anybody

301
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,700
where you were sent

302
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,700
and that you'll sooner die than disclose the king's secrets.

303
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,700
I swear.

304
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,700
I'll sooner die.

305
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,700
I swear.

306
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,010
- I'm here,my lady.
- Close the door.

307
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,960
Have you recently brought kindziukas from Lithuania?

308
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,300
It didn't taste good?

309
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,340
I'll order to boil this merchant alive.

310
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,640
with Polish borscht, so that he gets more fat.

311
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Who is this merchant?

312
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,040
Can he be trusted?

313
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,440
I won't get tortured for him.

314
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,440
Is he still in Krakow?

315
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,840
What's his name? Is he Lithuanian?

316
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,640
Vytautas, my lady.

317
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,140
He was to bring amber to Hungary, but he sold it to Teutonic knights.

318
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,840
Disgrace, my lady. I didn't know anything about it.

319
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,940
This Vytautas has to do something for me.

320
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,940
Everything, my lady, for Perkunas <i>(the god of thunder)</i>

321
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,240
and for Jesus, but don't punish him, my lady!
He's my relative from Trakai.

322
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Relative? Where's he sleeping?

323
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,240
At my place...

324
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,740
But we quarreled and he went away.

325
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,740
He must be sitting at the inn in town.

326
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,740
You'll give him this ring.

327
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,740
He must go quickly to Lithuania and give it to my brother, Algirdas.

328
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,040
He'll get a reward worth more than this ring.

329
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,840
And tell my brother I need his help. 

330
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,000
Very well.

331
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,000
- Why did you flinch?
- I didn't.

332
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,500
- But I can't tell you why I withdrew.
- Tell me!

333
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,500
Or else, I won't forget you!

334
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,060
Cudka, what's going on here?

335
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,900
He's a coward... and a traitor!

336
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,120
He's brave and loyal.

337
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,520
Believe me.

338
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,080
I'm leaving, daughter. I don't know for how long.

339
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,380
Where?

340
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
Secret mission.

341
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
I can't say more.

342
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,680
I've been waiting for you.

343
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,980
My husband...

344
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,400
And you seem not happy to see me...

345
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,640
You left me alone at the feast.

346
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,240
Don't be angry, Anna

347
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
I come back from war, a wild man...

348
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,020
You make me blush.

349
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,220
I know... I neglected you...

350
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,220
But just say a word... What do you want?

351
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,620
A new horse?

352
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,120
A village?

353
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,720
A jewel?

354
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
Say what you want...

355
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,810
One dance...

356
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,980
I won't go. The prince will kill me.

357
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,980
- He knows I'm trading with Teutonic knights.
- He won't kill you.

358
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,450
You will give this ring to prince Algirdas.

359
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
It's a sign.

360
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,900
You'll pass the message and get a reward.

361
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,220
I had a dream

362
