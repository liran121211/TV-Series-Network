1
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:39,950
And this was a cuckold...

2
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,180
Whoever calls the king a "cuckold" one
more time, will lose their tongue and job.

3
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,360
They're talking about me. I know it.

4
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,490
I'm innocent but everybody
thinks I'm a harlot.

5
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,490
Ignore it, queen.

6
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,930
She didn't have a proof.
She knew she'd lose.

7
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,330
But she preferred to hurt me with slander.

8
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,010
The king supports you and
that's what matters.

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,700
Father, who's the clown
accompanying the king?

10
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,920
Mykanda of the Battle-axe coat of arms.

11
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,600
Was he entrusted by king Vladislav with
protecting Casimirus at the battle of Plowce?

12
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,700
King, this is your first official document.

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,640
An extension of the truce.

14
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,790
I hope it will make the kingdom stronger.

15
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,200
- Jasko, you'll go to Torun with it.
- Yes, sire.

16
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,690
Won't bishop Grot be disappointed?

17
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,520
I understand his position and
I hope he understands mine.

18
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,440
Gregory, stay at Wawel.

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,440
I need a good chamberlain of the court.

20
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,230
King! Because of him you're
called a coward in whole Europe.

21
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,230
Battle-axe at the court?

22
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,650
I'm not afraid of rumours.
And I need friends.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,430
If I hadn't taken Casimirus
from the battlefield,

24
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,320
you'd be serving a different king today.

25
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,840
You were protecting your own head.

26
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,550
I was saving the future king.

27
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,900
You saved you damned butt!

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,460
And now the king's son's called a coward!

29
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,160
Better a coward than a corpse.

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,770
Easy, gentlemen. Now we've
got a different problem.

31
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,320
Holy Spirit dictated this to you, lady.

32
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,740
And this Spirit taught me a lot about life.

33
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:29,320
But Casimirus prefers making mistakes to
learning from his mother how to avoid them.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,330
Mother...

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,150
I have to go back to Visegrad
as soon as possible.

36
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:38,510
Charles insists on the engagement
between little Andrew and Joanna,

37
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,060
the prince of Calabria's daughter.

38
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,230
Is it bad? You wanted to
marry him off to an Italian.

39
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,990
I heard she's a very quarrelsome person.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,160
You must be cautious when
choosing a wife for your son.

41
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,890
More cautious than me.

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,880
Elizabeth, I'll be missing you very much.

43
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,240
I regret to go too.

44
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,480
Especially that I've got a
coronation gift for Casimirus.

45
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,320
A gift?

46
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,980
Kunegunda and I brought jesters to Krakow.

47
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,040
A jester troupe. Isn't it
entertainment for the rabble?

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,080
Joy as a gift is good for
anyone to start ruling.

49
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,520
Make sure they hold a show.

50
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,750
- Why me?
- Nobody's more respected than you here.

51
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,060
And this is this big problem?

52
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,220
That queen Jadwiga had an unhappy
face during the coronation?

53
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,940
It's hard for her to give up the
crown that she strove for so much.

54
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,530
The rumours about the new queen
seem to be a bigger problem.

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,170
With all due respect... But it's queen
Jadwiga who made these accusations.

56
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:42,460
Does this mean queen Aldona and queen
mother don't hold each other in esteem?

57
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,430
Beautifully said.

58
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,550
It's hard for her to accept
the loss of position.

59
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,580
The adultery trial only
added fuel to the fire.

60
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,240
Tell everybody that if anyone accuses my wife
of infidelity will be expelled from the court.

61
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,260
King, I heard there will
be jesters at the feast.

62
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Even maids know about it, and I don't.

63
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,160
Queen, I'll take care of this
when we finish, all right?

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,700
Not now, excuse me.

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,280
Let me guess, the king
has important matters.

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,330
The king has his matters and I have mine.
Sometimes ours.

67
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,350
I understand. I know what it
means to be the king's wife.

68
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,600
Is it easier when you're not?

69
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,320
At last!

70
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,190
Lady, forgive me it took so long.

71
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,960
Catherine, I'm happy you're here.

72
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,120
I need support so much now.

73
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,400
I lost my husband, home, crown.
I'm left with nothing.

74
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,800
Nothing? Except for the son
who has just been crowned?

75
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,320
The family near you? What else
does a woman of our age need?

76
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,120
Gentlemen, stop it!

77
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,960
Do you want to show the king
how a hare hunts for a hound?

78
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,490
Have you got a better idea?

79
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,970
You'll run after your butt to Czechia if
we can't come up with anything better.

80
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,520
We have to perform something.

81
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,780
If we don't pay the inn-keeper
today, he'll kick us out.

82
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,500
I can't sleep outside. I've got lumbago.

83
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,570
- Innkeeper! - yes?

84
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,300
- Give us a moment!

85
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,450
What's going on at Wawel? What
are the hot topics there?

86
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,120
Whether to bathe in hot or cold water.

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,890
It's the most boring kingdom in the world.

88
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,090
Queen Elizabeth promised a good pay.

89
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,600
Do you want to know
what's going on at Wawel?

90
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,700
I'll tell you. If you drink with me.

91
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,650
What are you doing?

92
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,320
I know I shouldn't. You
don't need my sorcery.

93
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,260
I wanted to secure this place before I go.

94
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,790
Egle, what are you talking about?

95
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,780
I'm going back to Lithuania,
with your brothers.

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,440
I won't let you go anywhere.

97
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,170
You are as dear as mother to me.

98
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,120
I'd better take Lithuanian
ghosts away from here.

99
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,250
There's a Lithuanian queen
on the Polish throne,

100
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,750
so Polish ghosts have to
accept Lithuanian ones.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,630
Can brother Wojciech come in?

102
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:25,870
Yes, please.

103
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,540
I don't want to disturb. It's
the first day of your rule.

104
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,000
Only lords rule. Here...

105
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,310
Bitterness?

106
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,250
I thought everything will be
different after the coronation,

107
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,840
That something will change.

108
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,430
But this trial hurt me a lot.

109
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,520
On the contrary.

110
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,690
You admitted a mistake. It
was an act of great courage.

111
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,260
Rather of foolishness.

112
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,530
The queen will never forgive me.

113
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,440
She'll be very watchful now, but...

114
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,790
You have to watch your
every step and every word.

115
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,540
What am I to do?

116
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,380
Follow Christ.

117
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,730
He was good to his tormentors.

118
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,280
I'll never be good enough for her.

119
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,960
I don't know how to talk to her.

120
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,750
Have you tried?

121
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,720
Try. Now you've got the crown.

122
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,240
Start using it.

123
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,390
It was great honour meeting you.

124
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,660
I hope we'll meet again.

125
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll be happy to come to Vilnius
for your baptism, prince.

126
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,880
The I'll ask you to be my godmother.

127
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,710
Can you do me this favor, queen?

128
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,230
Certainly!

129
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,230
Good bye, prince!

130
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,480
Lady!

131
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,710
Be careful!

132
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,390
The last thing we need is her jealous
husband with an army at our borders.

133
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,920
A wonderful woman.

134
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,550
Beautiful, brave, wise.

135
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,750
Our Aldona should be like this.

136
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,850
Our sister doesn't lack
beauty, courage or anything.

137
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,320
But she's too honest.

138
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,320
The court is a nest of wasps.

139
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,150
You need to know how to treat them
so that they don't sting you.

140
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,100
Elizabeth knows this.

141
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:27,980
Don't you wonder why she got close to you?

142
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,340
I don't know.

143
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,840
It's not about you, can't you see?

144
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,340
She'd like to baptize us.

145
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,080
She'd earn favour from the pope.

146
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,800
And why do you think I'm doing this?

147
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,480
When I praise her, she stands by
Aldona against her own mother.

148
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,730
You'd better look for Arunas
instead of teaching me.

149
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:51,520
If he decided to hide, we're
on a wild goose chase.

150
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,160
Nobody will find him.

151
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,120
You have green fingers.

152
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,240
I lived in a forest.

153
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,630
I believed it has divine powers.

154
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,840
God's present in all existence.

155
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,600
Really? You won't find Him in some people.

156
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,450
Everybody's got their weaknesses. You too.

157
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,120
I thought of moving you to Swiety
Krzyz or even Monte Cassino.

158
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,710
Please, don't.

159
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,960
I've got to stay here to
fight against temptation.

160
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,720
Not just run away from it.

161
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,500
I want to sacrifice my love to God.

162
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,770
I want to heal people.

163
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,770
Leave healing to God.

164
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,190
And me? When will He heal me?

165
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,300
From this love.

166
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,200
Have you chosen your conventual name?

167
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,100
Remind me...

168
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,970
the name of the man who
helped Jesus carry the cross.

169
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,900
Simon.

170
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
I'd like to have this name.

171
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,000
You're still occupying the royal chambers.

172
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:10,860
You don't use a weapon but
you can have it your way.

173
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:14,300
The sword is not as handy as the mind.

174
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,680
Vladislav admired you so much.

175
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,340
When he stayed with us,
he talked only about you.

176
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,700
He didn't even look at any young girl.

177
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,620
How I envied you...

178
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,860
He always preferred
politics to bed-chamber.

179
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:33,500
I've never met a man who'd talk
about his wife with such devotion.

180
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,790
How well you brought up the children,

181
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,470
How you hid with them,

182
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,470
How you led the defence of Wawel.

183
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,770
Queen, I beg for forgiveness.

184
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,410
I was so scared you'd
expel me from the court

185
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,170
that I lost my senses.

186
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,850
Go away if you have
nothing important to say.

187
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,760
Queen Anna... Nobody wants to
listen to her at the court.

188
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,210
And she wastes the royal funds...

189
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,880
I counted myself. She sent people on
errands to town seven times yesterday.

190
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:11,040
The king has the right to have
fun in a royal way. Leave us.

191
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,920
What happened? You used
to praise her so much.

192
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,220
She said she saw Anna with a Lithuanian
knight and later she denied it.

193
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,800
I told everybody to make an oath.

194
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,040
Are you suspecting Anna of infidelity?

195
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,740
She swore she was faithful to her husband.

196
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,890
Did you believe her?

197
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,100
Casimirus did and it's enough for me.

198
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,310
How will you live under the same roof now?
After such an event...

199
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,140
Here's my son's wife.

200
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,430
Your highness, do you
remember Catherine Pilecka?

201
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,430
Of course.

202
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,720
Excuse me, lady, but can
we talk face to face?

203
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,290
Of course.

204
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,010
Yes.

205
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,520
Queen, the whole court
is buzzing with gossip.

206
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,060
Advise me, please, what to do.

207
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,440
Are you asking me for advice?

208
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:20,170
You agreed to pass your crown to me.

209
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,490
I know how much it meant to you, Mother.

210
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,430
Behave flawlessly. Don't lose your temper.

211
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,570
Keep your head up. You're not blaming
yourself for anything, are you?

212
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,940
Forgive me I doubted your fidelity.

213
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,490
I'm glad you believed, after all.

214
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,370
Was this Lithuanian knight dear to you?

215
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,690
Casimirus is my husband, and
nobody else matters to me.

216
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,580
Child, I'm happy you say so.

217
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,250
I see Casimirus is very happy.

218
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,000
You gave him two daughters.

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
All you lack is a son.

220
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,270
Casimirus comes more often
to my chamber recently.

221
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,130
Does he? I'm happy to hear that.

222
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,820
Catherine's waiting for me.

223
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,470
Queen...

224
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,890
I apologize for anything that
offended you for all those years.

225
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,000
Forgive me, I always meant well...

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,640
The rules of the court are
difficult and not natural for me.

227
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:36,080
I admire how easily you adjusted
to them because I can't.

228
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,860
That's why I'm asking you for help...

229
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,220
My child!

230
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,220
I have a request to you.

231
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,210
I'd like to stay in my chamber.

232
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,090
Opposite the king's? And me?

233
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,930
I think my son will find a
way to you even in the dark.

234
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,970
The feast is coming. I have to prepare...

235
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,520
A comedy show.

236
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,760
My daughters know how to add
splendour to the celebration.

237
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,560
They learnt this from
you, Mother, didn't they?

238
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,910
Did Mother really kiss you?

239
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,590
And she even called me queen...

240
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:13,280
You see? She's changing because of you.

241
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,920
Not enough to move out of her bed chamber.

242
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,640
Everything will be fine.

243
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,320
Will you persuade her to move?

244
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,810
Not today.

245
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,570
Let's have fun.

246
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,110
Long live king Casimirus.

247
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,900
Long live queen Anna.

248
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,790
Honourable guests, princes, courtiers...

249
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,380
It's great joy to carry
the burden of the crown.

250
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,750
You share everyday hardships with me,

251
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,300
today, let's rejoice!

252
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,060
But, theatre first!

253
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,230
It's a gift from the king's sisters

254
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,630
for his coronation.

255
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,210
Play the fanfares for the artists.

256
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:08,120
We must fulfill queen mother's request.

257
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,280
The play is called... "A Little Snare".

258
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,290
It takes place far, far away...

259
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
In the faraway China,

260
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,020
where emperor Cock-A-Doodle-Doo

261
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,020
and empress Cha-Caw

262
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
decided to marry off

263
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,080
their son, Little One

264
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,710
Wife, agree to marry off our son at last!

265
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,530
Little One is still a child.

266
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,530
He's 40 years old!

267
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,100
Exactly, a child!

268
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,130
It's time for him to have his own children,

269
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,660
to stop sleeping in the
cradle in our bed chamber.

270
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,920
All right. On one condition...

271
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
I'll pick a wife for him myself.

272
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:34,590
Little One, put this iron
away or you'll get hurt!

273
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,760
He got dirty! Mummy will clean!

274
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,340
Mummy will clean!

275
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,340
Mother, did you agree for this?

276
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,000
The mother found the best
candidates in the kingdom.

277
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,450
What's your dowry, miss?

278
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,060
The woman's deaf!

279
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,060
You are a chef!

280
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm saying you can't hear.

281
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,850
Mice? They're near?

282
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,290
Where?

283
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,110
Daddy? It's not time for me to marry.

284
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,460
Mice!

285
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,840
Son, don't worry.

286
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,250
The next candidate will be younger.

287
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:40,410
What's your dowry, beautiful lady?

288
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,660
Three cartloads of gold.

289
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,420
Did you hear that son?
Three cartloads of gold.

290
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,420
Go, meet your future wife.

291
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,060
Come back to me, my husband!

292
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,890
And he ran away from his wife.

293
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,500
- If he gets hurt when hunting? - Hurt...

294
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,760
- If he falls down? - Falls down...

295
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,210
- If he gets injured? - Injured...

296
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,280
- Gets a cold? - A cold...

297
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,440
I told you husband, Little One
is not ready for a marriage.

298
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,890
I know.

299
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,840
We'll enlarge our chamber so that
he can stay with us for ever.

300
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,300
No, no!

301
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:47,050
Thank you, sire, for bringing me here.

302
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,120
I'm the emperor's son. Be my wife!

303
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,180
You have to defeat my fiancee first.

304
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,970
I wield an axe the best in China,

305
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,510
I can shoot an arrow behind the Great Wall.

306
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,510
I'll best him at sword and dice.

307
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,920
How about singing?

308
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,180
I'm too nervous for that...

309
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,610
Good bye...

310
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:34,810
/singing/

311
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,630
I've lost...

312
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,040
the duel for a wife.

313
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,080
More beautiful than dawn...

314
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,940
So similar to you, Mother.

315
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:56,730
To me? Impossible, my son's hallucinating.

316
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,880
Don't worry, Little One. I'm
with you and I'll always be.

317
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,280
What is it? Poison?

318
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,410
I prefer to die rather than
live without my beauty.

319
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,000
I feel I must sing!

320
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:25,340
/singing/

321
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,780
No, Mother, don't sing!

322
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:40,800
It's a wonderful medicine.
It cures voice and mind.

323
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,730
My husband, the emperor, was right. I
have to give you back to your wife.

324
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,000
Even stupid geese let their
goslings leave the nest.

325
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:57,450
For the wedding gift, I'll give you
whole China... to the Great Wall!

326
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,760
What happened, castellan?

327
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,440
A bunch of fools!

328
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,240
A sense of humour is a sign of intellect.

329
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,480
And what if people learn about it?

330
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
When they start talking about it in Europe?

331
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,640
Both Jadwiga and Casimirus
had a good laugh.

332
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,990
Drink some mead and at least
pretend the comedians amused you.

333
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,050
They didn't!

334
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,300
As I said. Only smart people
have a sense of humour.

335
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,090
Right!

336
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,400
Tired?

337
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,280
The air is stifling, isn't it?

338
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:46,540
Catherine, tell me if, in your opinion,

339
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,750
I'm embarrassing my son.

340
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,790
Motherly love can't embarrass...

341
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:58,780
I've never seen a comedy like that.

342
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,660
Is this really how simple folks see me?

343
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,480
Nonsense! Drink your herbs!

344
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
They laughed at me.

345
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,970
People will laugh even at a bear's show.

346
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,970
They need entertainment.

347
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,730
What did they call this play?

348
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,440
"A Little Snare"?

349
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,250
Yes.

350
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,560
Very clever.

351
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,520
Love is such a little snare.

352
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,970
I think Anna completely ensnared Casimirus.

353
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:35,640
There's only one way to help
my son rule peacefully.

354
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,430
I'll need your help.

355
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,160
What do you want to do?

356
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,670
I have a plan.
