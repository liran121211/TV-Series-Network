1
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,530
Stanislava, where's my mother?

2
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,560
She prayed whole night
by the king's coffin.

3
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,630
Mother!

4
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,260
Whose child is this?

5
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:04,460
/singing in Latin/

6
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,060
Mother, we have more important
issues to discuss now.

7
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,060
But it's important too.

8
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,560
Very important.

9
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,230
So, answer me.

10
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,930
Father just died and you
care of some stranger child.

11
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,300
Stranger?

12
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,460
She looks like yours.

13
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,630
I'm not going to explain.

14
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,730
Either to you or anybody.

15
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,730
An illegitimate child.

16
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,200
Don't we have enough problems
because your marriage with a pagan?

17
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,760
What if it reaches the pope?

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,500
I believe you'll take care
so that it doesn't happen.

19
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,030
How much time has passed since
your return from Hungary?

20
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,260
You said everything was fixed,
and there will be no trace

21
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,160
of your adventure with this girl anymore.

22
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,460
There is no trace.

23
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:27,560
Since Clara's father raised his
sword against the king and queen

24
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,230
the court sentenced their
whole family to death.

25
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,400
So, it's not Clara Zach's child?

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,200
I swear it's not.

27
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,830
Elizabeth swore none of them survived.

28
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,100
Wait.

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,760
What are we to do with her?

30
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,260
This is king Vladislav.

31
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,560
The father of our lord, Casimirus.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,530
He was a good king.

33
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,530
And a good father.

34
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,530
Can you hear me?

35
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,130
We have to be good to prince Casimirus.

36
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,600
He's very sad now.

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,760
/whispering/

38
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,460
Yolanta, can you speak?

39
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,460
You know the prayer for the dead?

40
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,530
You speak!

41
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,100
This is the seal of Elizabeth, your sister.

42
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,930
It's clearly written -

43
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,400
protect the child of
Casimirus, the king of Poland.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,330
But it doesn't have to be my daughter.

45
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,330
She'll be safe in a monastery.

46
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,300
Yolanta, she has my mother's name.

47
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,760
For the memory of your dead father,

48
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,500
tell the truth.

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,630
There was another woman...

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,700
in Visegrad, at Charles's court.

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,530
In that case,

52
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,060
you can't get rid of this child,

53
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,500
in whose veins our blood flows.

54
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,430
We need to keep her.

55
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,760
I won't do it to Anna.

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,760
Do you care of Anna now?

57
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
You should have thought about it then.

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,960
Besides, if she were a good wife...

59
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,360
She is! a good wife.

60
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
So, she will understand.

61
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,460
This child may be an obstacle
to Casimirus's coronation.

62
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,860
The pope agreed for it long ago.

63
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,930
But Casimirus does
everything against himself.

64
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,560
First, marriage with a pagan,

65
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,660
trouble at Hungarian court,

66
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,100
murder in Koscian,

67
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,330
war with the Teutonic Order...

68
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,330
Not enough? And now this?

69
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,300
Casimirus is not ready
to sit on the throne.

70
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,230
On the contrary, he's ready,
and he'll be the king.

71
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,500
And we have to support him.

72
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,330
We promised that to his father.

73
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:46,230
He's the laughing stock of Europe.

74
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,460
He fled the battlefield at Plowce.

75
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,060
The Teutonic knights
spread the news already.

76
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,800
And he behaves like a pagan.

77
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,100
And do you, excellency,
always behave like a bishop?

78
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,100
Brave!

79
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,530
He must have already snitched to the pope.

80
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,900
What about the girl?

81
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,900
It would be best to send
her back to the monastery.

82
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,260
But she may be in danger.

83
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,930
If this is the king's daughter,

84
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,500
we must protect her.

85
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,100
The court will boil over with gossip.

86
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,860
Only for a while...

87
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,860
Then they'll soon find another topic.

88
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,430
And what about the bishop?

89
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,760
How the please the "conscience" of Krakow?

90
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,600
I'll ask him to crown
Casimirus together with me.

91
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,160
He likes being important.

92
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,460
And what about Ann?

93
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,460
You know that she can get angry.

94
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:42,660
It's time she had her chaplain.

95
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,060
Someone who'll teach her how to forgive.

96
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,930
This way.

97
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,930
To the inn.

98
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:02,100
This is a longer route.

99
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,800
You said we were to go as fast as possible.

100
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,030
It's not good Anna was left there alone...

101
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,230
I have a bad premonition.

102
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,560
You want to go back?

103
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,260
How many times did Aldona tell
you they don't want us there?

104
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,130
That because of us there
may be no coronation.

105
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,760
But, since she called for my help,

106
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,300
maybe I should stay?

107
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,300
I'll ask gods.

108
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,160
Honey?

109
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
It's for the girls.

110
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,800
Lent hasn't ended yet.

111
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,100
They're Christians too.

112
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,100
And they'll think God loves them.

113
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,730
So, can I bring it to them?

114
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,730
Add the third one.

115
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,900
So, it's true.

116
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,460
What's true?

117
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,460
That Casimirus fasts.

118
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,460
But only under his mother's eyes.

119
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,530
Stop it! Bring it!

120
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
And be reasonable with the honey.

121
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,330
Egle, why doesn't Yolanta speak?

122
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,760
Maybe she can't.

123
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,360
But Cudka said Yolanta knows prayers.

124
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,660
Maybe she doesn't want to speak.

125
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,660
Sometimes when one has
some terrible experience

126
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
words are not enough...

127
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,200
I'll tell you a legend of a good
goddess, the queen of snakes

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,100
Grandma doesn't allow us to
listen to legends of gods

129
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,300
So, I'll tell you about the
love of Milda and Ramois.

130
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,760
It's not a legend. We
call it an itolorauda.

131
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,100
Is it true?

132
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,130
Yes.

133
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,400
It begins in a Lithuanian forest.

134
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,460
Egle, the lady's calling you.

135
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,300
I'll take care of them.

136
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:03,100
Do you know a true story about love?

137
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,030
Pour.

138
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,700
No froth.

139
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
Pour more.

140
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,860
Still no froth.

141
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,860
A bad omen.

142
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:46,230
Beer.

143
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,230
/speaking Hungarian/

144
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,730
Hungarians.

145
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,660
Give us more beer.

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,800
I can't keep quiet because
I'm not like them.

147
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,100
And I won't pretend everything's all right.

148
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,460
So talk to him?

149
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,400
Now? When he's taking over the kingdom?

150
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,130
Praised be Jesus Christ.

151
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,500
I'm brother Wojciech of Dominican Order.

152
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
And I'm a cursed Lithuanian.

153
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
That's what your brethren say about me.

154
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,100
Shall we pray?

155
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,630
You in Lithuanian, I in Polish.

156
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,800
In Lithuanian? Your god can
understand only Latin.

157
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,560
You speak to him with your own words.

158
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
He will understand for sure.

159
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,560
Tell him everything you fear.

160
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,560
I don't fear. I'm mad.

161
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,030
I'll pray for you, then.

162
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,960
All you can do is to scare people
with hell and take their joy away.

163
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,330
Tell all your complaints to God,
who died on the cross for us.

164
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,330
He'll help you for sure.

165
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,960
/speaking Hungarian/

166
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,460
Edmundas, you've been to Hungary.

167
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,100
Can you understand what they say?

168
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,130
The bearded one mentioned Casimirus.

169
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,630
We can cast dice.

170
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,630
As you wish.

171
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,630
All omens are bad.

172
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:57,400
/speaking Hungarian/

173
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,060
They said something about Casimirus

174
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,930
but I didn't hear everything.

175
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,460
They say they're going to
stay till the very end.

176
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,460
As if they waited for the king's funeral.

177
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,530
They came from Visegrad

178
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,660
and have some important
matters to take care of.

179
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,830
I think they mentioned vengeance.

180
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,200
Nothing more?

181
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,630
There was a bad omen.

182
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,000
I have to go back.

183
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,000
You stay here and watch them.

184
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,700
Beer.

185
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
Quickly.

186
00:12:54,430 --> 00:13:02,430
/Hungarian/

187
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,500
Jesus Christ!

188
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,760
You promised you wouldn't drink.

189
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,130
The city is mourning. I'm
crying after the dead king.

190
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,600
And you're drinking...
Have you got no shame?

191
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm drinking because...

192
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,530
Because?!

193
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,130
I did a terrible thing.

194
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,130
Of course, terrible.

195
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,130
I had to close the stall myself.

196
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,230
If not Joseph, the potter, I'd
have to carry everything myself.

197
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:24,230
Shame! I have a husband and
strangers have to help me.

198
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,300
I'll do penance...

199
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,300
May God forgive my sins...

200
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,100
Anna, they're waiting for me...

201
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,130
Egle said it's urgent.

202
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:39,900
You must know what I want to talk about.

203
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,600
This girl's name is the same
as your pious grandma's.

204
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,260
- Anna, please... - Say!

205
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,800
Were you unfaithful to me?

206
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,500
Be frank with me!

207
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,830
Yes, there was another woman.

208
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,830
Anna, I'm sorry.

209
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,930
I can't reverse it, but
you're the queen now.

210
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,900
I promise you...

211
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,900
I trusted you...

212
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,200
I've always been faithful and loyal to you.

213
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
You could trust me too.

214
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,460
I'm not going to kneel, but I beg you.

215
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,630
As your husband, as the
king, as Vladislav's son...

216
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,260
He liked you so much.

217
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,960
I beg you. For his memory.

218
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,960
Help me.

219
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,660
I beg you.

220
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,430
My granddad kept telling my father

221
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,160
"Don't look back if you want
to build a strong state".

222
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,600
The spirits will involve
you in their games.

223
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,730
The spirits...

224
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,130
For now, there are so many people
that there's no room for any spirit.

225
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:02,000
And everyone wants to gain
something from my father's death.

226
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,760
Focus on the crown, not
the coffin, Casimirus.

227
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,230
You'll have to take care of
the kingdom, not mourning.

228
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,960
You can leave the latter to your mother.
She's always mourning.

229
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
Will you let Yolanta stay?

230
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,130
I beg you.

231
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,400
I can't send her away
now, it's too dangerous.

232
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
You have to promise me something.

233
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:26,330
When you become king, you'll guarantee the
right to the throne to our daughters.

234
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,300
Anna, you know I can't do it. In Poland
only sons can inherit the throne.

235
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
Now, you will be the king.

236
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,260
And you can change it.

237
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,130
My lord, forgive me, but
I have to say this...

238
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,760
It hasn't been possible to tell
you this, but I want you to know

239
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,260
I feel very sorry for king Vladislav...

240
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
I loved him like my father.

241
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,460
I commiserate with you.

242
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,330
Thank you.

243
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,560
Pray for him.

244
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,760
I pray for him every day.

245
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,000
I know it's hard to lose the father but

246
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,800
your highness has still got
his mother, and wife...

247
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,500
You summoned me, sire...

248
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,360
You'll go to Visegrad to inform
my sister of our father's death.

249
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,930
But Pelka has already gone there...

250
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,430
Yes, but he's not returned
and Elizabeth hasn't come.

251
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,960
Something bad must have happened.

252
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,100
Does Cudka know?

253
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,760
You'll take the best horse.

254
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,160
Tell the treasurer to give
you as much as you need.

255
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,560
I'll take her of her.

256
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,700
Quick!

257
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:57,460
Look! He lost his mind
because of this beer...

258
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,730
Where did he get the money for drinking?

259
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,730
Didn't he steal from you?

260
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,100
I've lived too long with him
to keep money in sight.

261
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,800
I know how to hide it from him.

262
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,700
He can hide it from you too...

263
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,500
He mentioned 30 pieces of silver...

264
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,260
Holy Mary!

265
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,430
This is money from the devil!

266
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,500
Easy, woman...

267
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,300
He must have stolen it.

268
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,260
Take it.

269
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,930
The king's dead.

270
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:38,930
Hard times are coming.

271
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:44,460
Martin, what have you done?

272
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,630
It's obvious we all feel sorry
for the dead king Vladislav.

273
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,960
When they bring the coffin to the
church, we'll go to the ceremony.

274
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,460
But now, guests are coming
to the Wawel Castle.

275
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,760
Where's the Lithuanian?

276
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,760
She should hear it too.

277
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,230
The canon and the bishop
will hold the ceremony,

278
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,530
and when they pray long,
they can eat a lot.

279
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:37,530
You, cup-bearer, prepare more mead and beer

280
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:44,200
The life of our future king depends
on what we put on the table.

281
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,730
And remember, I always tell you

282
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,700
There will be strangers in the castle

283
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,030
And it's always dangerous

284
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,700
We have to be careful, very careful

285
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,400
Did you hear?

286
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,130
And cook only food for fasting?

287
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,300
Exactly!

288
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,430
Get down to work.

289
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,300
Do you want to tell me something?

290
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,800
No, I'm only cleaning.

291
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,200
So, what are you waiting for?

292
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,930
Knead the dough.

293
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,300
I'm on it!

294
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,560
I'd like to cut rumours and speculation.

295
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,200
The girl named Jolanta
will stay at the court.

296
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
My mother and I decided
we're not sending her away.

297
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,030
Wouldn't she be better
off in the monastery?

298
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,330
She's still a child...

299
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,030
If she chooses monastery in the
future, I won't stop her...

300
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,560
Now, she stays here.

301
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
So, this topic's finished.

302
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:51,130
Now, I'd like you to be frank with me.

303
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,560
You know you can always count on us.

304
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,500
So, let's try to clarify our situation now.

305
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,600
Are you ready for it?

306
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,960
I prefer the worst truth
than courtly make-up.

307
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,360
Spytek, how about the
treasury, who can I count on

308
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,630
and what's the gravest danger now?

309
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:24,100
The truth is... treasury is almost empty.

310
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
We can't afford any war.

311
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,660
When does the truce with
the Teutonic Order expire?

312
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,660
By Pentecost.

313
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,030
These are the terms of the
truce with the Order.

314
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,300
Pope's consent to the marriage with Anna.

315
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,230
Lithuania is your strong
ally, remember, Casimirus.

316
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,630
Can we count on them? Trust them?

317
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,130
I hear all the time they're pagans,

318
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,500
that this alliance was a mistake...

319
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,130
But your daughters are half-Lithuanian

320
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,530
these are strong bonds.

321
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,530
Giediminas knows it too.

322
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,900
Guards!

323
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,030
Open!

324
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,160
Look, how much Father managed to achieve.

325
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,100
I want the subjects to
remember him for ever.

326
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,160
I'll order a tomb that
will survive all wars.

327
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,330
Great. But we have to wait with the
funeral and the coronation for Elizabeth.

328
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:02,260
I hope Niemierza will reach Hungary soon.

329
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:07,800
Remember, you can count only in
your sister and nobody else.

330
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,560
Father trusted Giediminas too.

331
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,730
Don't count on pagans.

332
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,100
Count only on Hungarians and on me.

333
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,130
I can forgive Casimirus this one time only.

334
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,860
But I won't let myself
be humiliated anymore.

335
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,260
Algirdas?

336
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,630
What are you doing here?

337
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,630
I came back to warn you.

338
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,930
Hungarians are scheming
against your husband.
