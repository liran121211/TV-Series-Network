1
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:54,640
Didn't Aldona want to come?

2
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:02,880
It's not surprising my sister
is suffocating at Wawel.

3
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,670
Did she complain?

4
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,070
She's missing Lithuania.

5
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,500
We don't invite women to hunting.
We hunt on our own.

6
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Without women.

7
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,320
This is her home, but her heart...

8
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,570
Be kind to her.

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,040
So, you've given dispensation, after all.

10
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,770
Easter is coming, so we need meat.

11
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,840
I heard a bear plundered royal beehives.

12
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,770
Isn't it the same one that
escaped during your last hunt?

13
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,860
Insult!

14
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,070
Why to pierce such a valuable hide?

15
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,070
You should leave it for better hunters.

16
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,860
Don't be misled by who I am.

17
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,590
I know how to use the weapon.

18
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,850
And the tongue.

19
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,110
I will hold a mass for the hunting.

20
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,730
Maybe under this big oak?

21
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,090
We don't pray under oaks. We're not pagan.

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,400
What I meant was shade.

23
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,160
So, maybe I'll get this bear.

24
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,600
But don't worry. You'll get
some lard as consolation.

25
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,970
You'll rub it in your back, bishop.

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,160
/praying in Latin/

27
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,400
Anna, why aren't you praying?

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,930
We're sitting in these vaults all the time.

29
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,410
The body fragments are creepy.

30
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,160
Don't say so, these are holy relics.

31
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,320
Why couldn't I go hunting with them?

32
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,890
I can use a bow better than any of them.

33
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,400
Because none of them is a
wife of the heir apparent.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,760
You keep complaining you feel confined,

35
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,170
but when I go to give alms, only
little Elizabeth accompanies me.

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,190
I'm leaving.

37
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,720
Why?

38
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,760
Won't you wait for the coronation?

39
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,100
No, mother.

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,310
Go in peace. The mass is ended.

41
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,540
You're holding the bow like
a woman holds a sliver.

42
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:44,960
You need to hold it like a woman.
Tight and tender.

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,560
You want to challenge me?

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,300
You want to ridicule yourself?

45
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,500
Ready!

46
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,100
Two shots.

47
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,420
Like children...

48
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,160
No Pole can shoot as well as a Lithuanian.

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,370
Except for me.

50
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,020
How about further?

51
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,840
Haven't you heard the best
bowmen are from Krakow?

52
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,160
I haven't heard you're one of them.

53
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,390
What happened?

54
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,680
I'm barely alive.

55
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,830
Today, I did these three Hungarians who
wanted to poison the royal family.

56
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,090
The first one was easy, the second one
fainted immediately, but the third one...

57
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:11,560
He groaned like hell, and
in damn Hungarian...

58
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,250
There was nothing left to break...

59
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,790
You should have killed them faster.

60
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:18,810
Hadn't it been for Casimirus's
servants, I'd have killed them.

61
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,610
But the order was to
give them painful death.

62
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,560
They were to beg for mercy.

63
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,320
Did they?

64
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,930
And why are you so curious?

65
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,280
Do you think it's fun to torment people?

66
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,010
Then you have such
nightmares that it hurts.

67
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,040
Especially the heart.

68
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,960
I have such nightmares and backache...

69
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,400
So, go see the medic, maybe he can help.

70
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,750
Thank you, I'd rather stay alive.

71
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,620
Last time he wanted to burn warts
on my hands with hot iron.

72
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,810
And they say it's me who
doesn't have mercy.

73
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,120
On top of it, I am to kill
my relative's husband.

74
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,340
I don't feel sorry for him
because he's a scoundrel.

75
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,010
Still, family is family.

76
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,830
Why have you dressed up like this?

77
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,130
I'm going to see the king.

78
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,830
The king's gone hunting.

79
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,170
So, the queen.

80
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,640
I won't let you torture my Martin.

81
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,050
Did I tell him to bring poison to Wawel?

82
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,760
He didn't even share the money
he got for it with you.

83
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,080
He drank it away himself.

84
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,080
His conscience didn't let him calm down.

85
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
He's always been sensitive.

86
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,800
Are you talking about the same man, or

87
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,700
maybe you've got two different husbands?

88
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,460
You never liked Martin, did you?

89
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,220
Don't be so happy. I won't
let my man get killed.

90
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,990
I'll beg the queen and God.

91
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,380
You'll return to Krakow in the evening,

92
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,380
take somebody and go to the Great Master.

93
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,900
Maybe we should wait for their answer

94
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,630
after their envoy returns.

95
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,160
We need to renew the truce
as soon as possible.

96
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,710
We can't afford a new war.

97
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,710
People are tired. They need peace.

98
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,190
I want them to feel safe.

99
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,920
And make sure bishop Jan
doesn't know about it.

100
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,620
He's very stubborn in the Teuronic case.

101
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,260
The later he gets to know
about it, the better for us.

102
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,920
Don't you know my opinion?

103
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,600
You'll move out tomorrow at dawn.

104
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,140
You've always valued my opinion.

105
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,730
I need to start ruling at last.

106
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,610
Greetings. We've been to
Tyniec for a retreat.

107
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,270
And we were told you're hunting here.

108
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,860
Forgive our hard words.

109
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,240
We didn't want to stand against you.

110
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,440
We just have a different view
on the country's affairs.

111
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,000
I bear no grudge.

112
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,300
We'd like to attend your coronation.

113
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,330
Now we have to stick together, don't we?

114
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,200
Here.

115
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Thank you.

116
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,420
Bring it there.

117
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,320
God bless you.

118
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,440
You're a saint, lady. Like
your mother and sisters.

119
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Thank you.

120
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,220
Elizabeth!

121
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:58,040
Where's bishop Grot?

122
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,100
He was to wait for us here.

123
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,290
He was just ahead of us.

124
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,980
He went further to get the bear first.

125
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,850
It's the bishop's horse.

126
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,800
I hope the bear didn't get him.

127
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,220
Elizabeth, darling, look at me.

128
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,110
Egle, go away, no sorcery!

129
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,380
Anna, how can you allow this?

130
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,870
It's only herbs, lady,
like yours from Tyniec.

131
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,610
Oregano and valerian.

132
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,800
It won't end well, let's call a medic.

133
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
- Mum! - Easy, darling!

134
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:44,120
I'll go to the kitchen and
tell them to bake apples.

135
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,700
I won't eat apples, Egle. I'm fasting.

136
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,910
What have you said?

137
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,600
I haven't been eating for three days.

138
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,270
St. Kinga at my age did penance and fasted.

139
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,620
It's important, isn't it, grandma?

140
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,810
Are you happy?

141
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,630
This is the result of your teaching.

142
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,640
Did you tell your chldren
to do penance and starve?

143
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm not surprised only
three of them survived.

144
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,560
Forgive me.

145
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,760
You left me no choice.

146
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,070
I shouldn't have said that, I'm sorry.

147
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
Do you really hate me so much?

148
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,040
You were so young when you came here.

149
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,880
I thought I'd be able
to be a mother for you.

150
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,040
You've never even tried.

151
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,170
I've been trying every day.

152
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,640
You wanted to get rid
of me on the first day.

153
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,160
The king persuaded me.

154
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,090
But you don't make it easier.

155
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,650
We have only one thing in common.

156
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,180
Taking care of the girls and Casimirus.

157
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:31,130
Not only did I miss the hunting, but
now I need to go back with you.

158
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,130
In a carriage, like a woman.

159
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,340
Bolko, bring me to Wittenberg...

160
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,160
to Rudolf.

161
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,590
Son...

162
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,190
You haven't changed your mind?

163
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,190
I'm asking you for the last time.

164
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,750
Come with us.

165
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:08,600
Casimirus needs me.

166
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm sorry for Anna.

167
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,730
Nothing matters to you except
Casimirus and this rim of gold.

168
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,520
You're not fair.

169
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,680
Mum.

170
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,370
Some woman's begging to see the queen.

171
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,640
I almost shot you, what happened?

172
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,740
An adder scared my horse.

173
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,920
Or your god got angry that you
want to shed blood in Lent.

174
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,390
I gave dispensation for the whole hunting.

175
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,820
All candles in Krakow churches
are made from these hives.

176
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,800
We can't allow some bear to destroy them.

177
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,080
Come on.

178
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,730
Are you afraid someone can see you
on the same horse with a pagan?

179
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,280
You can say that all the way
you were evangelizing me,

180
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
and my horse too.

181
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,580
Quiet!

182
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,860
A bear?

183
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,100
Rather a human.

184
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,850
Have mercy on my husband.

185
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,250
He didn't deserve death in torment.

186
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,060
There's no mercy for those who rise
against the king and his family.

187
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,500
There isn't and there won't be.

188
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,760
He's not evil, but foolish.

189
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,690
God didn't distribute
brains among people evenly.

190
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,640
I can't release him.

191
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
You're the queen, lady.

192
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,430
You can do everything.

193
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:41,760
The law is the law and
it binds the queen too.

194
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,010
Let go! I need to talk to your commander.

195
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,880
Go to hell!

196
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,880
Somebody else should be sitting here.

197
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,700
She deserves painful death, not me!

198
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,320
Understand?

199
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,770
The truth is I told him to look for a job.

200
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,650
He got in this mess because of me.

201
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,240
I should be in the vault now, not him.

202
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,770
It's my fault.

203
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,020
This woman has no conscience.

204
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,690
She told me to bring poison to the court.

205
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,720
She said it's spice. How
could I know it's poison?

206
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Why are you telling me this only now?

207
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,080
I was to take the whole truth to my grave.

208
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,020
But how could I die with clear conscience

209
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
knowing she still walks the earth.

210
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,080
I love her more than anyone.

211
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,100
But, for money... this woman
is ready for the worst crime.

212
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,990
It's only words.

213
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,570
I've got a proof.

214
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,610
I know where she hid the money
she got from the Hungarians.

215
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,960
So, speak!

216
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,200
I will!

217
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,240
Of course, I will.

218
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,410
But on one condition.

219
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
Have you called for me, lady?

220
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,130
By my decree, Martin Harcik
will be only beheaded.

221
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:24,430
Without the torture he was sentenced for.

222
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,090
But I already sealed the king's
and the chancellor's will.

223
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:30,090
Do as I say.

224
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,310
When the king is absent, I rule here.

225
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,330
God bless you, lady!

226
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,040
Take her.

227
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,130
Where have you been, sire?

228
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,340
I sent ten people to look for you.

229
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,560
I found your bishop and this kid myself.

230
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
He's a poacher.

231
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,560
You know it's a royal forest.

232
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,960
Where are you from?

233
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,940
From beekeper's post by the river.

234
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,750
Go bring his father.

235
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,440
My father's dead.

236
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,440
The Teutonic knights killed everybody.

237
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,390
I'm the oldest man in the family.

238
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,030
Do you know the punishment for poaching?

239
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,200
I'd rather hang than
watch my sisters starve.

240
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
Wouldn't you rather have a job at the
castle and money for their upkeep?

241
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,880
You can't. He was poaching
at your property.

242
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,200
He broke the law!

243
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,080
I won't hang a kid. He's even
younger than my little Elizabeth.

244
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,100
What's your name?

245
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,100
I was baptized as Maciek.

246
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,620
Come to the royal kennel.
There's a job for you there.

247
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,920
Now go. Didn't you forget something?

248
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,860
Lady, please excuse me.

249
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,750
The timing may not be the best,
but I have a big request.

250
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,480
Will you speak out for me with my father?

251
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,290
I don't think you really
need my backing, Helen.

252
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,550
A heart matter?

253
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,770
My knight is Jasko, the son of Spytek.

254
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,560
And I am from Poznan.

255
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,440
My father and brothers will
never agree to our marriage.

256
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
I'm not allowed to even look at him.

257
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,040
I can't imagine my life without Jasko.

258
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,560
Lady, excuse the interruption.

259
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,820
Marcin Harcik claims the whole
conspiracy is led by his wife.

260
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,390
That's impossible.

261
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,090
He swears on his head it's true.

262
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,090
So he'll lose it!

263
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,730
He'll be beheaded but without torture.

264
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,410
How come? Why?

265
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,510
I pardoned him on his wife's request.

266
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,360
I haven't seen a woman who loved her
husband so much for a long time.

267
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,710
She was even ready to let herself
be locked instead of him.

268
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,110
And this coward accuses her and
blames her for everything.

269
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,750
My children were almost
killed because of him.

270
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,490
Don't forget they wanted to poison me too.

271
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,030
What shall we do, then?

272
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,570
Proceed with beheading and that's all!

273
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,680
But he was sentenced for death by torture.

274
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,340
Thanks God you don't rule here.

275
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,470
Let me go!

276
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:48,620
Calm down! I won't torture
you, one blow and that's it.

277
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
And is that to calm me down, cousin?

278
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,760
Mind that my axe may miss the right spot!

279
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,570
Harcik, get up!

280
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,920
Go, get water!

281
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,430
What's with the water?

282
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,850
Lazy dogs!

283
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,760
Guards, catch the runaway!

284
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:30,890
Tak off your clothes or I'll kill you!

285
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,870
Have mercy, sir!

286
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,870
Now!

287
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,830
Don't look! Take off your clothes!

288
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,830
Quickly!

289
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,830
Run!

290
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,300
Guards!

291
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,530
Who are you?

292
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,200
There, in the river. Somebody's drowning.

293
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,560
This must be our runaway.

294
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,910
Save him, sir!

295
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,250
You save him!

296
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,250
I can't swim.

297
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,530
Let's check it.

298
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,980
Have you seen anybody here?

299
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,500
A runaway from the vault.

300
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Marcin Harcik, thin and not tall.

301
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
That maybe the one drowning in the river.

302
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:38,090
This was after the mass...

303
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,320
I killed a bear just with a knife.

304
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
Maybe with a wooden spoon?

305
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,480
And you, Casimirus, wouldn't
kill even a hare like this.

306
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,120
Prince, this is...

307
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Do you want to try?

308
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,630
Sure.

309
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,630
Unless you're afraid.

310
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:57,130
Casimirus!

311
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,690
Just don't cry like a woman.

312
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,600
Let's see who's going to cry.

313
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:16,700
Yes, he's strong... You
need to find a way...

314
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,870
My sister's crying all the time.
Do you know that?

315
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,490
Say what you know!
