1
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,710
We have peace until next Pentecost.

2
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:43,720
The Great Master Lothar von Braunschweig

3
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,840
signed the truce on hitherto terms.

4
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,020
Didn't he try to force us to break
the alliance with Lithuania?

5
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,570
No, he didn't even mention it.

6
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,340
Your adamant stance when
negotiating with the envoy

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,340
must have been successful, sire.

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,730
I'm asking you for one thing

9
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,460
let's not forget Kuyavia.

10
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,460
I promised Father I'll recapture Kuyavia.

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,960
We don't forget it, lady.

12
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Still, all of us agree that now

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,800
a war with the Order
would end in a disaster.

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
Not all of us.

15
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,020
Bishop?

16
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,550
Lady! You have a guest.

17
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,550
Is Algirdas already back?

18
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,550
He was to visit the salt mines.

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,900
Are you alone?

20
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,500
May I come in?

21
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,480
What are you hiding there?

22
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,450
Gingerbread?

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,840
May I try?

24
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,990
Really?

25
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,990
Can't you see I want to try them?

26
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,470
So good!

27
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,600
At Plowce, king Vladislav
led our knights to victory.

28
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,350
The Teutonic knights had to withdraw

29
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,880
and they failed to join with
John of Bohemia's forces.

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,690
Have you forgotten the reception
when you returned to Krakow?

31
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,240
No, I haven't.

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,170
So, why are you wasting a
chance for the final victory?

33
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,000
Why do you want to wait until the Teutonic
Order rebuilds it power and attacks us again?

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,930
I know, there's no money. I
hope it's only about this.

35
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,840
I hope if excellency wanted
accuse me of cowardice,

36
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,340
he'd be brave enough to
tell this face to face.

37
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,830
This is not an act of capitulation.
This is the proof of a new order.

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,710
I want less destruction
and more construction.

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,600
It's good in peaceful times.

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,280
Our times won't be peaceful when
our only tactics is the sword.

41
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,360
When troops move to and fro through
our lands and our houses burn.

42
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,720
In this way, the land
will never be prosperous.

43
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,120
It won't be a European
power like the others.

44
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,240
Sire, tell our knights about it.

45
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,940
If they have no real enemy, they'll
find one among themselves.

46
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,940
Enough! I'm expecting sound arguments.

47
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,040
Counselling the king is a vocation.

48
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,190
If someone doesn't understand this,
they don't deserve to be here.

49
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,100
Chancellor, issue the document.

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,310
My copy of the truce is to be ready for
the coronation, on St. Mark's day.

51
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:57,120
There aren't many people close
to you at the court, are there?

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,700
I've got daughters, Egle,
Cudka and Casimirus.

53
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,360
It's not easy to tell
your secrects to a man.

54
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,100
I'll hide it in case the queen came here.

55
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,420
You both still don't get on well, do you?

56
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,440
Yes, but I think it's my fault.

57
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,590
Have you already got a
dress for the coronation?

58
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,210
I don't know if I'll be crowned.

59
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,880
You've got to be prepared
for either situation.

60
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,880
And look good in either, for your subjects.

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,200
And look beautiful for your husband.

62
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,630
I've brought a few of my dresses.

63
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,670
You'll see what's hot in Europe.
We'll think of something.

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,260
I've brought a great tailor from Venice.
You should think of it too.

65
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,960
Don't expect your husband
to have this idea.

66
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,210
We'll meet as often as necessary
and solve the current problems.

67
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,720
We're at your order, sire.

68
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,690
And another thing...

69
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,110
I want to know what's going
on behind the castle walls.

70
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,440
Too often do we forget about our subjects.

71
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:14,350
Our world is the crown and the court,
but they've got other concerns.

72
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,420
The wealthy and the knights
will say they want to fight.

73
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,890
I'm not talking about knights.

74
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm talking about simple folks.
I've been among them recently.

75
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,230
I heard their complaints.

76
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,400
Where? Here in Wawel?

77
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,610
No. At a roadside inn.

78
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,680
An inn? Son, that's not
a place for the king.

79
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,970
And where's his place if
nor among the subjects?

80
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,290
The council's meeting is over.
Thanks to everyone.

81
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,760
Please, ask Jasko not to leave
the king even for a moment

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,960
if my son wants to travel outside Krakow.
That's unheard of!

83
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,630
There won't be a better moment.

84
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,500
We've got a good position for attack.

85
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,150
We can always negotiate.

86
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,440
That's right. It would be a mistake
to miss such an opportunity.

87
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
But the king doesn't understand this.

88
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,720
He's too young and too inexperienced.

89
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,220
The knights will be happy to join.
The prince of Sieradz will join.

90
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,250
I talked to him. He'll join even today.

91
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,290
Excellent!

92
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,290
We'll go, but only with Casimirus.

93
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:19,100
You have to persuade him
to renounce the truce.

94
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,720
Because if we start without him,

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,160
we'll have new enemies - him and Hungary.

96
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,060
Show them to the tailor. Let her
make something similar for you.

97
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,060
All of them are beautiful.

98
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,320
Try on the one you like most.

99
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,920
It's this one.

100
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,040
ELizabeth, may I ask you a question?

101
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,560
When Casimirus stayed at your court...

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,590
did he take Clara by force?

103
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,690
You know him. Do you think
he'd be able to do it?

104
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,040
I think not.

105
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,410
So, why are you listetning to
rumours spread by his enemies?

106
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,130
Clara gave herself to him.

107
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,150
But it's true that Casimirus has
always been attracted by women.

108
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm blaming myself I didn't watch him then.

109
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,530
Fate didn't favor us either.

110
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,600
At the begining... children,
one and then the other

111
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,740
and there was no room for tenderness.

112
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,160
The he went to you, and
this scandal erupted.

113
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,920
It's terrible to hear such
things of your own husband.

114
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,480
And he exposed me and
the children to risk...

115
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,880
Me too. I lost my fingers.

116
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,060
Clara's father attacked me and my husband.

117
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,360
We had to kill him and all his family

118
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,940
to prevent further plots and attacks.

119
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,720
And he still reached you here.

120
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,240
Don't you bear any grudge to Casimirus?

121
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,150
Everybody makes mistakes.

122
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:03,770
His had tragic results.

123
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,120
But he became more responsible and caring.

124
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,720
Though he was always brave.

125
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,650
I don't know what to with Yolanta.

126
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,960
Her presence here must be a burden for you.

127
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,620
This is not the child's fault.

128
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,040
Cudka promised she'll take care of her.

129
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,240
Watch out for Cudka, that's my advice.

130
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,480
- Look? - Where do you have it from?

131
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
My father gave me. Try it on.

132
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,800
And? Wait...

133
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
Can we talk?

134
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,500
Have you thought it over?

135
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,110
Will you accept my gift?

136
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,510
Yes and no.

137
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,230
I care about you.

138
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,900
That's why I'd like to be frank with you.

139
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,260
I'm counting on it.

140
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,190
I don't want to hurt you.

141
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,250
If it turned out that it's not love

142
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,880
I must be sure.

143
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,880
Cudka, even if you don't love me yet,

144
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,710
I'll do all I can for you to love me.

145
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,050
Don't let her think too long.

146
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,050
Thinking and love don't go together.

147
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,760
Act or you'll lose her.

148
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,130
You've been overhearing.

149
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:37,550
We're friends for a long time.

150
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,550
I can't watch you suffer from love.

151
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,490
You go to Pelka now and ask
for his daughter's hand.

152
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,130
Then, you go to Cudka at
once and propose to her.

153
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,130
I know what I'm saying.

154
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,760
It's useless. I can't do it.

155
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,060
A little bit of patience.
Everybody was a novice one day.

156
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,960
But, understand, I can only trade.

157
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,770
Calm down, I'll show you again, look.

158
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,000
Come on.

159
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,400
With clay... you need to work gently...

160
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,780
You need to listen to it
and it will lead you.

161
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,780
It will drive me crazy!

162
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:43,520
It's all because of my bad luck.

163
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,180
My husband was killed,
my goods were stolen.

164
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,520
Why?

165
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,720
Try again. Look!

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,500
I don't want!

167
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,290
I don't know if I can marry him.

168
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,060
Though I like him very much.

169
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,320
Love will come with time.

170
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,800
No. I...

171
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,090
I love the king.

172
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,970
So do I.

173
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,680
Do you know what queen Elizabeth told me?

174
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,960
In the modern courts in France or Italy,

175
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:40,360
more rhythmic and pleasant
music is in fashion.

176
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,600
They play and sing not
only for God's glory.

177
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:52,620
Gentlemen! I'd like to speak
to you, knight Pelka.

178
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,940
I'm listening, knight Niemierza.

179
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,330
Personally, if possible.

180
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,600
Gentlemen!

181
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,350
To love the king is not a sin but a duty.

182
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,540
We all love him because he's clever, brave

183
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,030
and does his best to improve our lives.

184
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,520
This is the king's duty.

185
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,570
The subject's duty is to
respect him and love him.

186
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,880
So, I'm not a sinner if I love him?

187
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,090
No, as long as we talk about pure love.

188
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,000
I could kiss the earth on which he steps.

189
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,780
It's adorable you want to serve him.

190
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,730
I'll do everything for him.

191
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,610
Good.

192
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,120
Tell me something about your knight.

193
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,530
He's gentle, nice...

194
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,180
He loves me, I know it.

195
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,450
He sometimes acts like
crazy, but he's a good boy.

196
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,620
He never gives up without a fight.

197
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,080
It's hard not to love him.

198
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,380
So, you see. Your own heart
has told you the way.

199
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:34,240
I know it's pure. I'm certain.

200
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,480
You'd better not tempt the king
with your beauty and devotion.

201
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,420
Don't distract him from
his destiny and duty.

202
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,230
So, I am to marry Niemierza

203
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,600
because of the king?

204
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:01,040
First of all, pray sincerely.
In your heart.

205
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,130
You'll get the answer.

206
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,920
Will you give me your daughter's hand?

207
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,920
I love her more than anything

208
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,480
and I promise to do
anything to make her happy.

209
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,480
I don't own much.

210
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,020
But I'll do my best for
her not to lack anything.

211
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,130
I know you'll be good to her.

212
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,400
Does it mean yes?

213
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,130
I'll give you my blessing.

214
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,090
Thank you!

215
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,140
- But there's one condition. - What?

216
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,360
My daughter must decide herself
if she wants to marry you.

217
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,410
She experienced a lot. She
lost her mother and brothers.

218
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,410
I want her to be happy.

219
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:46,730
So, I won't force her to do anything.

220
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,340
Nobody should be forced to get married.

221
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,330
It's bliss to love and to be loved.

222
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,870
If Cudka agrees to marry you, I'll give you
the village I got from king Vladislav.

223
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,500
Damn!

224
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
You're doing well.

225
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:16,120
Look! A little bird.

226
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,210
A nice bird, but you
can't eat soup from it.

227
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,210
Children would like it.

228
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,350
It could be painted and
they could play with it.

229
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,950
I'm not sure...

230
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,770
I don't have kids myself.
God didn't bless me.

231
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:36,010
But my neighbor has to give something to
her kids all the time to keep them busy.

232
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,220
Sometimes a spoon, sometimes a mug.

233
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,860
Why can't it be a clay bird?

234
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,190
Another jug...

235
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,050
If you keep doing like this,
we'll run out of dishes soon.

236
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,760
- I'm sorry. - It's all right.

237
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,440
It's not. I don't know
what's wrong with me today.

238
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,470
I burned the beans for pig ears.

239
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,570
Come on, pig ears. Nobody eats it here.

240
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,250
But we do in Lithuania.

241
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:23,710
I've been waiting for so long to prepare
a real Lithuanian feast for my lady.

242
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,540
And what now? We'll serve only kibinai.

243
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:31,160
And the Hungarian goulash
that burns tongues.

244
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,190
Come on, nobody will even try it.

245
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,620
And if they do, they'll be sorry at once.

246
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,240
I'll make broth with those ears.

247
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,650
Arunas!

248
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,120
/Lithuanian/ - What do you want?
- Get ready!

249
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:07,420
/Lithuanian/ You're going to Krakow
with prince Kestutis tomorrow.

250
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,420
/Lithuanian/ The road is dangerous.

251
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,120
/Lithuanian/ The prince needs
goods warriors with him.

252
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,200
/Lithuanian/ I'll go with Kestutis
everywhere, but not there.

253
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,810
/Lithuanian/ That's an order.

254
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:23,630
/Lithuanian/ You've got no choice.

255
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,680
Look! I baked them.

256
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,560
Beautiful!

257
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,960
You'll see! The whole Krakow is
going to talk about my birds.

258
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,470
I'll go to the inn to sell them.

259
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,340
There are Hungarians there,
and they may like them.

260
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
Maybe you open a stall? With toys?

261
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,800
- A stall? - Yes!

262
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,260
And what's this for?

263
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
You're so good to me.

264
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:12,460
As never before.

265
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,610
I'm going to have a stall.

266
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,980
Toys... People will buy...

267
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,240
I'll quickly make enough
for votives for my Martin.

268
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:36,490
I want this list of penalties to
be read to all people of Krakow.

269
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,160
Let everyone know there will be
no mercy for bandits and thieves.

270
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,680
Excuse me, sire, this may not
be an appropriate moment.

271
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,090
We need to improve the
condition of the treasury.

272
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:48,090
What's your advice, chancellor?

273
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,300
Taxes have to be collected
more effectively.

274
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,270
I'll ask my sister how
Charles Robert does it.

275
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,130
Have you got other issues? The
feast starts in a moment.

276
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,420
We need a new cup-bearer.

277
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,650
And the young Ligenza? The
widow was to send her son.

278
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,430
He's coming to us from Bologna.

279
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,430
- He studied? - Yes, sire.

280
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,570
It's too late for me to do it...

281
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,520
One more time.

282
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,930
That's all right.

283
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,290
It was good. We just don't have
enough opportunity to dance.

284
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,760
But dance is not a sin.

285
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,190
Of course, not.

286
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,490
You play beautifully, Yolanta.

287
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,770
Dad, you didn't see how beautifully
we danced with Kundzia.

288
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,730
There will be problems.

289
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:35,470
The guests can't stop praising your dishes.

290
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,470
No wonder if they fasted so much...

291
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,280
No, it's your dishes...

292
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,280
I only finished the dessert. How about it?

293
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,940
Beautiful!

294
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,020
And the rest? We need to
bring it to the tables!

295
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,680
Beautiful!

296
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:45,800
/praying in Latin/

297
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,960
We can't pray because Anna wants to dance.

298
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,110
The joy of life is expressed in
dance and it's pleasing to God.

299
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm mourning and want to be respected.

300
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:04,410
The resurrection of Jesus
Christ overcomes death

301
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,120
and changes it into the miracle of life.

302
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:17,130
It seems for them the time for
resurrection has already come.

303
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,460
/praying in Latin/

304
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,300
Hard times are coming.

305
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,570
Isn't all of this waste of money?

306
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:34,120
But you liked the wine,
didn't you, excellency?

307
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,120
Lady, you inspired these
walls with life and beauty.

308
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,160
You can see they're inhabited
by people, not ghosts.

309
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,360
I only brought a little wine.

310
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:53,180
I heard, lady, you helped our countrymen
find a new home at the Hungarian court.

311
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:57,160
It's pleasure to support
those who deserve it.

312
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,020
I came only to try the
wine Elizabeth brought.

313
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
Sit, please.

314
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,800
Cudka,

315
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:25,050
my love

316
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,940
will you be my wife?
