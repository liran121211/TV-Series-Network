1
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,530
Forgive me that I distract you from your vigil
at the Lord's tomb, but it's important.

2
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,850
Can I tell you everything, Brother?

3
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,820
You confess to God, not human.

4
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,440
And will you keep the secret?

5
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,080
We swear it when we become priests,
so you don't need to worry, lady.

6
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm not worthy celebrating
the Resurrection.

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,290
I'm not as pious as queen Jadwiga,

8
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,290
I can't pray like this.

9
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,030
Is that what you wanted to confess to me?

10
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,050
I keep asking God to help
me forget something.

11
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
I follow the commandments,

12
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,130
but I can't help my memory

13
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,020
- I can't...
- Entrust your worry to Christ.

14
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,690
He'll certainly help you.

15
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,700
I burned souvenirs of my past life,

16
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,700
and it didn't help.

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,560
After so many years, I can't
forget my first beloved one.

18
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,800
The more I try,

19
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,030
The more often I reminisce about him.

20
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,840
It's a sin, isn't it?

21
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Don't fear.

22
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,250
Never compare yourself to others.

23
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,420
You don't think those gathered in
the chapel are without sin, do you?

24
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,140
Christ suffers for all of us.

25
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,320
And he waits for all of us.

26
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,710
If only Martin could see this...

27
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,540
Rose, people are gathering
at Christ's tomb. Come!

28
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,040
Look, his head keeps dropping.
Like Harcik when he got drunk.

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
And then he beat you. Come.

30
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
That's the way he was.

31
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,230
At least I wasn't all alone.

32
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:18,480
When we're all, you can't be alone, come.

33
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,930
Do you think he's in paradise?

34
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,140
For sure, come, Rose.

35
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:37,180
/singing in Latin/

36
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:28,700
/praying in Latin/

37
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,130
Egle?

38
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,110
What silence at the castle!

39
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,210
Even the guards let me in without trouble.

40
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,990
I've got the amulet you asked for.

41
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,990
Here's your pay.

42
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,660
- You'd better not show it to anybody.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,480
I'll beg our gods to help my lady.

44
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,480
What's the problem?

45
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:17,100
She's got to choose which gods to trust.

46
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,830
That's none of my business.

47
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,170
Do you think they really believe
you can die and then resurrect?

48
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,420
I don't know. But they
do want to believe it.

49
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,420
I'll never comprehend it.

50
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,530
I'll go to town. People are leaving church.
Maybe I'll do some business?

51
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,780
To town or to the kitchen?

52
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,600
/singing in Polish/

53
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,880
/singing in Polish/

54
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,580
Have you brought anything?

55
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,120
Dried in the sun for half a
year, and rubbed with herbs.

56
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,700
So dried or rubbed?

57
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,810
Interchangeably. In Poland, you have
no idea what a good sausage is.

58
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,810
Where's Gabia?

59
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,050
I'va got a Lithuanian pirog for her.

60
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,970
With groats and cheese.

61
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,120
She's just gone out with a Hungarian cook.

62
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,200
Where?

63
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,510
To church.

64
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,370
Have you got more of this kindziukas?

65
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,830
We've got Lithuanian visitors. Do
you want to make a profit or not?

66
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,830
I'll unpack everything in a moment.

67
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,680
But don't touch the pirog
and this one either.

68
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,290
That's for my little cook.

69
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,090
Little cook...

70
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,600
Mother, guests are waiting.

71
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,870
We'll see the soon, but the
matters is very urgent.

72
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,870
Sit down, please.

73
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,010
I don't believe in your wife's conversion.

74
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,800
I looked at her during the prayer.

75
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,600
Don't defend her. It's not necessary.

76
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,870
Mother...

77
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,260
It's a holy day today. Very important.

78
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,600
Christ's resurected. We should rejoice!

79
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm rejoicing. I only
wanted to help you both.

80
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,770
I want to help Anna. She's been
with us for so many years.

81
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,690
She watches our ceremonies but
she doesn't participate in them.

82
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,920
And, I guess, you've got a plan.

83
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,470
No... I've got no plan.

84
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,470
You should have one.

85
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,400
Your wife won't be peaceful as long as Lithuanians
practice their sorcery at the castle.

86
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,940
- What sorcery?
- Don't pretend you don't know.

87
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,090
They all do this. Some
grains, grain-ears...

88
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,640
Nobody will go through the door
because the smoke suddenly changed...

89
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,830
- This is a task for you. - For me?

90
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,250
So, am I to throw them away?

91
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,060
These people are dear to my wife.

92
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,880
I believe you'll find a way to help them.

93
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:10,880
Start with Anna.

94
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,970
When she was baptized, she was very young.
Now she should understand more.

95
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,970
Fine, but I'm not a priest.

96
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,170
Priests are responsible
for spiritual matters,

97
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,510
and you are responsible for...
matters of all kinds.

98
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,750
The Lithuanians are here to stay,

99
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,910
and it depends on you whether
they'll respect our god

100
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,910
and our customs.

101
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,910
This is the king's role.

102
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,800
And for such a king shall you be annoited.

103
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,050
Now, let's go. The guests are waiting.
They must be hungry.

104
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,050
And so am I.

105
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,990
Let's go, son.

106
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:08,570
/humming/

107
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,740
Finish with these peppers.

108
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,830
Peppers, peppers with everything!

109
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,460
Good peppers.

110
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,480
Put this meat in a pot
and fill it with water.

111
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,880
I'll do it. He's never made broth.

112
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
So, teach him!

113
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,180
Maybe there will be some use of him.

114
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,640
He sings beautifully.

115
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,340
In Hungariarn...

116
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,340
A nice man.

117
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,340
The cook should cook.

118
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,280
Maybe you show us what
you can do, will you?

119
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,940
Peppers, peppers...

120
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:46,030
/speaking Hungarian/

121
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,840
Very good.

122
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,280
Let him go back to his place.

123
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,660
Such a nice man.

124
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,210
Nice?

125
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,690
Everything will be fine.

126
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,970
After Lent, whatever we put
on the table will be eaten.

127
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,060
Egle, I told you we don't
need these things here.

128
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,560
Gods aren't angry with you,
but don't offend them.

129
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,780
- Say goodbye to them. - No.

130
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,370
I know you mean well.

131
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,560
You're lost, lady. The father's and the
local beliefs struggle inside your soul.

132
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,030
No wonder you can't find your place.

133
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,380
But be careful.

134
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,650
You'll lose yourself and
you won't be happy.

135
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,510
This is not your country
and not your faith.

136
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,510
This is my country, Egle.

137
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,440
Here is my home, my
husband and my children.

138
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,970
Can't you see it?

139
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,700
You've been here with
me for such a long time

140
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,110
and you still haven't learned?

141
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,110
Here everybody's watching and judging.

142
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,740
Egle, if I don't show them I believe,

143
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,200
they won't believe me.

144
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Is this what you want, really?

145
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
Do you want to be like them?

146
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,290
You never will.

147
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,480
You want to convert. So be it.

148
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,720
But be yourself. Giediminas's daughter.

149
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,950
Holy Mary!

150
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,080
Is this how you greet me, cousin?

151
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,130
Whenever I see you I
recall my Martin's pain...

152
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,000
Stop blaming me. I didn't do anything
to him, and I'm in trouble myself.

153
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,200
He was my first runaway.

154
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,570
You could have spoken out for
him, and you did nothing.

155
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,160
The executor must do his duty.

156
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,300
Martin has never been good to you.
Your parents told you this.

157
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,950
And you were stubbornly in love.

158
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,950
He drank, beat you, didn't love or care...

159
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,710
He wanted to push the blame on you,
as if you gave him this poison.

160
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,810
I said it before, so I don't
need to waste my time.

161
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,160
What have you got?

162
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,490
It's expired. And you said you
bought it from the Hungarians.

163
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,490
It's for sale, not for you.

164
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,010
It's a holy day today. You'd
give us a cup or two?

165
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,840
Where's Casimirus?

166
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,080
I can't see the children.
Shouldn't they be at the table?

167
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,810
You'll see, Mother. Hungarian vegetable
stew is the best for children's pale skin.

168
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,340
I'll make sure little Elizabeth tries it.

169
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,720
Isn't the music too loud?

170
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,720
Maybe we tell them to stop playing?

171
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Archdeacon!

172
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,950
Is it true God doesn't like
music during the meal?

173
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,250
I haven't asked.

174
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,100
Lord, bless thy gifts which
we are about to receive.

175
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,560
Amen.

176
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,650
A gift from Charles. The
best of Hungarian vineyards.

177
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,520
Dear guests.

178
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,100
I'd like to request so
much that I lack words.

179
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,680
But while requesting,
I'd like to thank you,

180
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,310
although I can't mention everyone,

181
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:24,460
for advice, support, mediation,

182
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,400
or for spiritual care which
we've been given recently.

183
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,140
I'd like to thank most and reward
with three villages in Greater Poland

184
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,480
our archdeacon of Krakow,
Jaroslaw Bogoria of Skotniki.

185
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,400
It's very generous, sire, but there maybe
more urgent matters from more needy subjects.

186
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:02,890
Power with no money must
cultivate alliances.

187
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,940
What did you say?

188
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,390
Pope John teaches that the
rich don't need allies.

189
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,720
And the poor must buy them all the time.

190
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Elaborate, excellency.

191
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:22,010
So said my father, who, as you know, is
quite close to the head of our church.

192
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:26,990
Excellency, try a Lithuanian
dish, your allies' cuisine.

193
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,520
It won't hurt scholarly disputes.

194
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,580
Good you've come.

195
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,210
You need to rejoice together
on a day like this.

196
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,580
Here...

197
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,140
Lord has resurrected!

198
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,700
Wouldn't you find some warm food for
travellers robbed by bandits on the road?

199
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,870
- Where?

200
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,800
Around half a day from the turnpike.

201
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Near a wood with young lindens.

202
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,330
What bandits rob Christians on a holy day?

203
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,960
There's bread and beer for the child.

204
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,990
Fresh home brew, warm soup, should I serve?

205
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,630
- God bless you for your good heart.
- Amen.

206
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,710
I'd better go to watch the stall.

207
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,050
Easy, the bandits were on the road.
There are guards in town.

208
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,780
I've got a premonition...

209
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,600
Rose, wait. I'll go with you.

210
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
So long!

211
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,490
Cudka, dance with us, please!

212
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,240
Nobody's dancing. We're mourning.

213
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,770
We want to dance, please!

214
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:06,590
- So dance! - We want to dance with you!

215
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,480
Lady! Can I dance with the girls?

216
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,490
Grandma, please!

217
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,320
This is the best babka (cake but also
woman in Polish) in our kitchen.

218
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
I prefer bread with cheese.

219
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
With cheese? Then I prefer our pirog.

220
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,240
So, you've prepared this wonder of yours!

221
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,010
Peppers!

222
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,720
Let me see!

223
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,030
Beer!

224
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,240
Milk! Milk!

225
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,550
Water!

226
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,800
So, didn't I say he'll kill us all here?

227
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,010
/speaking Hungarian/ Peppers...

228
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,160
Hot?

229
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Hot!

230
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,160
Damn it!

231
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:09,480
Cudka!

232
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,810
Time to take the kids!

233
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,990
But we want to stay!

234
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:19,610
Take them with Helen.

235
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,180
Girls, to the chambers, please.

236
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,180
But you will join us later, won't you?

237
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,280
Maybe it's time for us as well?

238
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,830
Lent has finished not only on the table.

239
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,840
Holy Mary! They plundered the whole house.

240
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,630
Nothing! Nothing's left!

241
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,150
All there's left to do is to
jump into the river like Martin.

242
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,980
Rose!

243
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,600
King Vladislav died, and what did I say?

244
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,360
There were no bandits under his rule!

245
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,630
There were but only on roads!

246
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,630
There weren't.

247
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,840
As if I wasn't miserable enough...

248
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,760
It's better to drown at once
and the suffering is over.

249
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,000
Where's Cudka?

250
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,900
She went to dance, but I'm here.

251
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,870
Bring me some Tokaji, then.

252
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,820
Give me a son!

253
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,750
Egle...

254
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:36,250
Hide it.

255
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,420
She only cares.

256
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,800
I know but only God protects you.

257
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,710
There's no need for trinkets.

258
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,920
I'll throw them away.

259
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,900
Throw them from your
heart, most importantly...
