1
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,900
At this time? What can be so urgent?

2
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,320
Lady, archdeacon Jaroslav.

3
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,920
Your majesty.

4
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,830
I know the reason why
Anna can't be crowned.

5
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,940
Adultery.

6
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,400
What are these suspicions based on?

7
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I'm not suspecting. I know.

8
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,950
Your majesty.

9
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:21,450
Stanislava, call Casimirus in.
He has to know.

10
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,880
The king is praying with Elias before
the coronation. Is it necessary?

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
It's necessary.

12
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,450
I must see Aldona one more time. Help me!

13
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,120
How did you get in here?

14
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,650
I must say something very
important to Aldona.

15
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,740
Anna!

16
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,540
King Casimirus's wife, who
will be crowned today.

17
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,720
Have you lost your mind?

18
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,230
I beg you.

19
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,610
It's a matter of life and death.

20
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,230
Mother, mind your words, please!

21
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,460
And with whom?

22
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,040
A common knight, and a pagan!

23
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,650
Lady, maybe this needs to be verified?

24
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,650
I'm doing this!

25
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,850
- I'm verifying! - No, it's crazy...

26
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,560
Summon Algirdas and Kestutis. It's
impossible the brothers don't know about it.

27
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,870
Everybody has to make an oath.
Anna and chambermaids. Everybody!

28
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,660
Here! Now!

29
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,880
Today is the coronation. The kingdom's
festival... Let's not ruin it.

30
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,000
- It can do harm.
- She's not faithful to my son.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,910
- Are you sure, lady? - I've got a witness.

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,360
Lady, prince Algirdas and prince Kestutis.

33
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,910
Who needs help?

34
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,460
My son. Your sister has betrayed him.

35
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,130
We won't let anybody offend her.
Casimirus I didn't expect this.

36
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,680
I trust my wife.

37
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,400
Prince, are you ready to swear
on what's dearest to you,

38
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,790
that you know nothing of
your sister's affair?

39
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:04,800
I vouch for her virtue with my honour.

40
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,610
And do you vouch too, prince?

41
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,070
Don't accuse me, please.

42
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,700
Neither me, nor my sister.
She's faithful to her husband.

43
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,330
That means the case is closed.

44
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,110
It should be enough for you, Mother.

45
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,790
Don't walk away, please.

46
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,400
Helen. When Anna comes, you'll tell
us what you saw, under the oath.

47
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
Let everybody hear the truth.

48
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,280
Tell me what's this about.

49
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,090
You know something. You won't cheat me.

50
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,980
- Did Aldona betray Casimirus? - No!

51
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,680
- So, who are they talking about?
- Arunas, your knight.

52
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,000
Where is he? Where's Aldona?

53
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,970
You must come with me. That's
queen Jadwiga's order.

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,900
We're to swear Anna never
betrayed Casimirus...

55
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,970
It's obvious.

56
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,700
And that she was alone
at night recently.

57
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Swear on the relics of St.
Jadwiga of Silesia.

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,890
How can I swear if I don't know?

59
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:22,620
I was by my father's bed.

60
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,450
But you've been with her every
day for last eight years.

61
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,360
This will decide Anna's
coronation, maybe even her life.

62
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,550
Am I to lie?

63
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,640
You're to help her.

64
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
This is what service is about.

65
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,160
Kneel.

66
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,400
Cross yourselves.

67
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,540
What are they doing?

68
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,650
They're praying over chrism.

69
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,260
It's a special kind of oil

70
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,990
with which your father will be
anointed at the coronation.

71
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,680
The king's authority comes from God.

72
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,850
The archbishop confirms it with this sign.

73
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,880
It's as if your father was
no longer just a human.

74
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,770
Is our mother going to be anointed too?

75
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,480
Of course, she's king's wife.

76
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Did Grandma agree?

77
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,450
Grandma loves all your family.
Your mother too.

78
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,090
Queen Jadwiga shouldn't
agree to Anna's coronation.

79
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,500
The king decides everything.

80
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,260
Something happened?

81
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,120
No, everything's fine.

82
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,500
Pray for your parents.

83
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,040
Why didn't you tell me?

84
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,440
He didn't want to go.

85
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,550
I forced him.

86
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,940
You took him yourself.

87
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,020
If I had known, I wouldn't
have taken him to Krakow.

88
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,730
Aldona chose Casimirus,
what do you want from me?

89
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:26,430
What if she runs away with him?

90
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,940
She's responsible. I trust her, don't you?

91
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,200
I do, too.

92
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,330
But there's darkness in her heart.

93
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,680
The whole alliance may break
apart because of one knight.

94
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
We've got to find him.

95
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,960
Lady, I insist.

96
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
I didn't do anything improper.

97
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Give me the rings.

98
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,080
The queen summons you.

99
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,930
You can go Stanislava.
I'll come when I'm ready.

100
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,760
What's going on with you?

101
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,200
How can I swear if I don't know?

102
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,670
I wasn't there.

103
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,610
They'll tell me to swear on
the relics of St. Jadwiga...

104
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:06,240
- Tell the truth! - So, we must know it.

105
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,740
I can lie for you, but I
want to know how it was.

106
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,280
I went to see Arunas.

107
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,140
- Alone? - Yes!

108
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,800
But I didn't betray my husband!

109
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
A conversation is not adultery.

110
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,160
A conversation and feelings can be a sin.

111
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,240
Do you think so?

112
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,280
Queen Jadwiga thinks so,
and she will judge you.

113
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,480
Thought, words and desires can be a sin,

114
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,060
but she doesn't care of
your salvation but power.

115
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,540
I'll be delighted to say I was there.

116
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,880
She's hurt you so much for all these years,

117
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,320
and I won't let her win.

118
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,960
Cudka, send for brother Wojciech. If there's to
be a trial, there should be someone just there.

119
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,940
- If she really... - Come on!

120
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,330
The words of the oath
have to be written down.

121
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,380
Helen, you've got to be here. All the time.

122
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,350
I'll never leave you.

123
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,320
And I'll always love you.

124
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,070
But you won't see me anymore.

125
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,930
Let's get it over with.

126
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,800
What are you accusing me of, Mother?

127
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,550
I'm not your mother.

128
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,720
Husband, if you want, I'll swear.
And so will my maids.

129
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,290
Egle can't swear on relics.

130
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,320
Cudka can.

131
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,050
Cudka cared of her wounded
father at that time, didn't she?

132
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,190
Anna couldn't have done anything improper.

133
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,850
Can you prove it?

134
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,770
Will you swear?

135
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,840
/Lithuanian/ Where's Arunas?
Was he with you all night?

136
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:25,100
/Lithuanian/ When did
you see him last time?

137
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,950
/Lithuanian/ At dusk. He said he was
told to visit Krakow, so he went.

138
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,540
Arunas had better not be found.

139
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,240
Just a suspicion of an affair
with the queen means death.

140
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
I had better not find him.

141
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,810
Praised be Jesus Christ.

142
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,510
For ever and ever.

143
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,810
Brother Wojciech, come over here, please.

144
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,160
Cudka, swear that

145
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,230
Anna, daughter of Giediminas,
the wife of my son Casimirus

146
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,220
is faithful to him.

147
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,840
Remember that perjury is a sin.

148
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:42,830
Forgive lady, forgive Anna, I can't.

149
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,370
I assure you, Casimirus, I'm innocent.

150
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,520
I swear I didn't betray you.

151
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,340
Thank you wife, I believe you.

152
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,990
Helena, come.

153
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,470
It's your turn now.

154
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,090
I swear last night I saw

155
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,430
Anna, daughter of Giediminas,
the wife of Casimirus

156
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:30,730
meeting secretly a Lithuanian knight.

157
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,850
She's lying.

158
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,800
Is it true?

159
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,860
I must see the abbot.

160
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,790
A Lithuanian?

161
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,280
A knight. Please.

162
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,060
I didn't betray you and I'm
not afraid of the truth.

163
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,760
Yes, I spoke to a Lithuanian knight.

164
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,590
But I didn't offend against the duties
of wife and mother with any deed.

165
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,010
Why Anna?

166
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,790
I asked him to never come
to Wawel, and that's all.

167
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,560
Why did you meet him secretly?

168
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,990
And who would let us talk freely?

169
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,270
Knight Arunas didn't come here out of
his volition. He was ordered to come.

170
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,650
Like I was ordered to
come here the other day.

171
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,260
I always obeyed my father.

172
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,470
I never betrayed the king and I
have nothing to blame myself for.

173
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:54,030
But Helena saw you together.

174
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,760
The clouds covered the moon, and..

175
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,440
But, yes... I saw them as
if in each other's arms.

176
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,280
Helen, why are you lying?

177
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,780
I don't want to see the
one who's lying anymore.

178
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,000
He wants to see you.
Probably from Lithuania.

179
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,230
You wanted to talk to the abbot.

180
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,500
Bring me to him, sire.

181
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,560
It's me.

182
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,300
How can I help?

183
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,300
I'd like to join your order.

184
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,220
Have you suddenly felt a calling or
you're running away from somebody?

185
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,240
I want to sacrifice my life to God.

186
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,920
Follow me, knight.

187
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,470
Say what you know.

188
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,760
I saw. I prefer not to
have seen it, but I did.

189
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,090
Helen, are you sure of what you saw?

190
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,540
- We're sometimes misled by our senses.
- Speak!

191
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,040
Go on, what did you see?

192
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,500
I didn't see!

193
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,340
Did you lie?

194
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,810
I misled you, queen. I'm sorry.

195
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,840
They talked in the moon light.

196
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,520
This man reached out his hand.

197
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:04,840
But Anna withdrew...

198
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,630
I didn't tell you this. I'm sorry.

199
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,840
You lied to me.

200
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,580
My husband. I've never been with
another man since we're together.

201
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,790
I love you and I'll support you.

202
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,510
Son...

203
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,100
Do you believe her?

204
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,120
Are you sure you're ready
for such life, knight?

205
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,970
I don't have needs.

206
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,160
We live like this. Here in Tyniec,
in Swiety Krzyz, in Monte Cassino.

207
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,340
And we keep repeating the same rule.

208
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,720
Teach me, sire.

209
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,160
Whoever you are, and you
eschew your desires,

210
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,920
willing to serve Jesus Christ,

211
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,160
you put on a mighty and holy armour...
of obedience.

212
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,480
I know how to be obedient.

213
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,220
Do you know how to stay silent?

214
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,120
Our rule says even good
or holy conversations

215
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,000
should be allowed only
rarely to advanced learners.

216
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,450
The Scripture says: Sin is not
ended by multiplying words.

217
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,060
Life and death are under
the tongue's control.

218
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,660
I'll stay silent.

219
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,080
My name's Arunas. The one who
gets everything his way.

220
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,000
You'll have to adopt a
different, conventual one.

221
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,480
I request a baptism.

222
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,640
Did you commit a crime?

223
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,350
I love a woman who will never be mine.

224
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,580
I want to give this love to your god.

225
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,910
You fool.

226
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,510
You'll tell Him about yourself.

227
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,480
I only need to know who this woman is.

228
00:18:52,970 --> 00:19:00,970
Virgin, Mother of God, God-famed Mary!

229
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:20,560
Ask Thy Son, our Lord, God-named Mary,

230
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:42,750
To have mercy upon us
and hand it over to us!

231
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:50,750
Kyrie eleison!

232
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:03,740
/praying in Latin/

233
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,000
Listen to the prayer we say,

234
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
For what we ask, give us today:

235
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:33,480
Life on earth free of vice;

236
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:42,080
After life: paradise!

237
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:51,360
Kyrie eleison!

238
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,850
May everyone be subject to authority

239
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,430
ruling over the others.

240
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,430
There is no authority

241
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,320
that doesn't come from God.

242
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,760
And those that exist

243
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,580
are constituted by God.

244
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,740
Let us walk honestly, as in the day

245
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:50,430
not in rioting and drunkenness,

246
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,430
not in chambering and wantonness,

247
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:59,200
not in strife and envying.

248
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:04,040
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ,

249
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,260
and make not provision for the flesh,

250
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,240
to fulfill the lusts thereof.

251
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:28,380
/praying in Latin/
