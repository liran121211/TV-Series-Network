1
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,820
God, take this love away from me.

2
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,680
It brings me only suffering.

3
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,440
He belongs to another one.

4
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,590
Cudka!

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,640
Father!

6
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
You've returned!

7
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,930
Mum, there's somebody there, look!

8
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,750
Nobody's there, sleep!

9
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,720
It's too early to get up.

10
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,640
/singing a lullaby/

11
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,240
That's you...

12
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
And who did you expect?

13
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,480
Easy. You're safe.

14
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,440
I won't let anybody get hurt.

15
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,360
Nobody wanted to tell me where you went...

16
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
or when you'd return.

17
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,240
You've been away for so long.

18
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,490
Snow blocked the roads to Visegrad.

19
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,780
I was afraid I'd lose you.

20
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,910
Promise you'll not leave me alone again.

21
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,320
Child, you know it's not up to me.

22
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,470
But I may stay in Krakow long enough
to get you a good pair of shoes.

23
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,520
Has anybody seen a lady
running barefoot in Wawel?

24
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,280
I've got shoes, but I couldn't find them.

25
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,860
I was in such a hurry to see you.

26
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,860
I didn't want to wake you, but I
wanted to make sure you're safe.

27
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,430
I can't stand the thought our
daughters could have been poisoned.

28
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,920
Whatever are they doing here?

29
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,900
Are you surprised I wanted them
with me after all of this?

30
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,570
Royal children sleep in their own bed.

31
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,990
In Lithuania a home is a home.

32
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,990
Even the richest one.

33
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,030
And kids can play and hug their mother.

34
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,220
Maybe if it weren't for these cold
walls, you'd be different too?

35
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,500
Different?

36
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,440
Kunegunda, get up!

37
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,560
It's always a war, or
Lent, and now the kids...

38
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,610
Lady, the bells for matins...

39
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,660
Again, I dreamt of...

40
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,640
Who?

41
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,720
My children.

42
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,720
Everybody's abandoning me.

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,780
Enemies all around.

44
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,400
Were Vladislav alive, he'd know what to do.

45
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,090
And if he didn't know, he
would ask your advice.

46
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,050
Forgive, my lady.

47
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,710
My tongue's quicker than mind.

48
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,860
If my son was willing to
listen to me, like my husband

49
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,860
there wouldn't be this mess now.

50
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,630
But Casimirus want to rule by himself,

51
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,630
without my support.

52
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,270
He wants to prove he's the king.

53
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,910
He's completely different from Vladislav.

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,140
Therefore I pray for him all the time.

55
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,380
Pelka says Elizabeth and her court
will be here at any moment.

56
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,800
Why wasn't I sent for?

57
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,756
Pelka arrived in the middle of the night.
You were asleep.

58
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,040
That's what I'm talking about.

59
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,760
We have to prepare the funeral,

60
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,110
receive the guests, provide security.

61
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,040
Do you know what would happen if the
Hungarian queen was poisoned at Wawel?

62
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,280
They caught the poisoners,
they're in the vault.

63
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,040
How do you know these are all of them?

64
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,270
Do we know who's behind them?

65
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,560
We'll get to know

66
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,040
It's enought to interrogate
them well, torture a little...

67
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,410
Later. Now we need to prepare Wawel.

68
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,520
Let me out, people help me!

69
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,320
Quiet, man!

70
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,020
I can't listen to this anymore.

71
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,020
You scream for the whole night, like crazy.

72
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,800
It may be my last sunrise...

73
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,600
I don't want to die...

74
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,110
Please, knight!

75
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,070
Here, sit at the table.

76
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,070
Give us groats with dressing!

77
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,570
Bring salted fish and slice bread!

78
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,640
Don't trouble yourself, cook master.

79
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,720
I'll eat anything.

80
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,200
The prince said I need to receive
you as a distiguished guest.

81
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,960
I'd be happy to eat our
beer soup with cheese.

82
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,640
I was thinking of it during the
whole way back from Visegrad.

83
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,140
Soup? Here you are!

84
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,800
Hold on!

85
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,160
They say there are now
poisons you can't smell.

86
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,430
It's just cooked.

87
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:31,600
You can eat it. Nobody's going
to get poisoned with my soup.

88
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,200
Who'd like to poison me?
Do I disturb anybody?

89
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,530
Casimirus's children aren't safe.

90
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,340
Somebody tried to poison them yesterday.

91
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Holy Mary, why?

92
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,290
Luckily, nobody got hurt and the
poisoners are already in the vault.

93
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,440
You must have no conscience
to hurt innocent children.

94
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,870
They'll pay for that with their heads.

95
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,140
And the executioner will
add extra pain first.

96
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,140
All right, get down to work!

97
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,680
The fish won't cook by itself and
neither will the cabbage slice.

98
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,500
Tell us how they fed you in Hungary.

99
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
Is it true everything's so spicy there?

100
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,680
Once I even had tears in my
eyes, my tongue was burning!

101
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,940
What can I give them here?

102
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
They've been on the way for two weeks.

103
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,550
When they arrive, they'll
be so tired and hungry

104
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,320
that any food will make them happy.

105
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,510
So, maybe our cuisine?

106
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,710
Polish!

107
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,890
I can't believe the queen misses
all the cabbage or sour soups.

108
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,790
Everything's so sour here
that your mouth hurts.

109
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,450
I'll start squinting and salivating,

110
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,690
maybe they'll think I'm too
stupid for a conspiracy...

111
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,450
and they'll let me go...

112
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,450
Casimirus won't bother.

113
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,160
He's got neither heart nor honour.

114
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,640
First, he raped Zach's daughter and
the murdered the whole family,

115
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640
so that he could flee from justice.

116
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
Yeah, raped...

117
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,080
Don't try to wriggle from the executioner.

118
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,160
Or he'll make you suffer
cutting your head off.

119
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
One stroke.

120
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,100
Even if I starved, I'll never
again take what's not mine,

121
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,010
and I'll be fasting...

122
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,100
just let me live a little more.

123
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,470
Is something bothering you, daughter?

124
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,630
I'm all alone here.

125
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,630
Alone?

126
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,180
I know well you've got
someone in your heart.

127
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,760
I talked to him about you.

128
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,570
But I won't give my daughter away easily.

129
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,410
I must be sure Niemierza
will take good care of you.

130
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,960
Niemierza?

131
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,770
Aren't you curious what's
going on with him?

132
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,040
We haven't been engaged,
so I'm ashamed to ask.

133
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,680
I though you like him.

134
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,000
You probably like the
prince, my lady, don't you?

135
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,290
All women, ladies-in-waiting and chambermaids
alike, follow him with their eyes.

136
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,800
I saw a picture of St. Sebastian,
pierced with arrows here...

137
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,160
I thought I'd never see
a man more handsome.

138
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,600
But, Casimirus is in a different league...

139
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,850
The dough for cake isn't ready!

140
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,690
The fish isn't cleaned!

141
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,690
And you came here for a chat!

142
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,600
Praised be God and all saints!

143
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,280
Forever and ever.

144
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,540
I have to go back to my lady.

145
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
Your daughter's beautiful.

146
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,090
It's good she's like her mother and not me.

147
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,650
Why did queen Elizabeth linger for so long

148
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,180
before coming to her father's funeral?

149
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,400
When I arrived in Visegrad, she was sick.

150
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,660
The medics wouldn't let her go.

151
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,130
Here...

152
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,130
No, we're still before the mass.

153
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,920
The funeral procession is today, isn't it?

154
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,470
The rich and the commonners will be able to

155
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,910
see off the king in all churches of Krakow.

156
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,560
Then I'll go too.

157
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,880
No, you take a rest.

158
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,880
You've been travelling for a week.

159
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,700
I owe my king much more.

160
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,170
And this little I can do,

161
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,170
pray and join the procession.

162
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,210
First, there will ba carts,
each with four horses

163
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,660
Everything as you wished, lady,

164
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,660
dressed in black cloth

165
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,090
Later mourners and mounted
knights in full armour

166
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,090
How about monastery congregations?

167
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,470
All clergymen in town are waiting,

168
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,640
singing mourning songs.

169
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,950
Later the black cloth has to be
shared by churches and monasteries

170
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,040
Somebody has to give alms to the poor,

171
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,080
so that they pray for the late king's soul.

172
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Maybe Pelka?

173
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,590
Where's Kundegunda?

174
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,440
Find her, please!

175
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,080
Will you let him die?

176
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,860
You're my cousin!

177
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,480
Leave me alone, woman. Beer!

178
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,440
Have mercy, man. Save Martin!

179
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,710
What will I do without him?

180
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,710
Is he the only man in the world?

181
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,710
You'll find a better one.

182
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,570
After all these wars, only the ugly, the
lame or the old are left in Krakow.

183
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,000
Oh yeah, it must be hard to find such
a bum and drunkard like your Martin.

184
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,080
I'll be delighted to cut
this scum's head off.

185
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:54,220
Do you know why no woman wants you?

186
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,280
Because you're only good for
murder and carrion collection...

187
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,840
Not for love...

188
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,200
What am I to do?

189
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,960
What if something happened
to her or she was kidnapped?

190
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,240
At Wawel, how come?

191
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,320
And how come murderes
found the way to here?

192
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,040
Yolanta!

193
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,080
Why are you hiding here?

194
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,050
Everybody's looking for you.

195
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,240
Mom says grandpa is among angels now,

196
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,660
and the bishop says he'll turn to ash.

197
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,230
So, what will happen to him?

198
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,700
Come, they're waiting for us.

199
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,220
I don't want to go to angels and
I don't want to turn to ash.

200
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,590
What ideas are those?

201
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:11,240
Because if I turn to ash,
I won't be there anymore.

202
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:13,660
Only the body dies.

203
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,400
The soul is immortal.

204
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,600
You'll leave the body like an old dress,

205
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
and you'll fly straight to God!

206
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,560
Naked?

207
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,880
God, what am I to do?

208
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,690
Martin...

209
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,670
Martin...

210
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,690
My love!

211
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,400
I brought you bread.

212
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,960
Thank you!

213
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,980
Get me out of here!

214
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,370
How?

215
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,370
How? How?!

216
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,540
They'll cut my hands off, impale
me, and dismember my body...

217
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,960
What can I do?

218
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,670
Pray only, so that the devil
doesn't take you to hell.

219
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:55,100
I've paid for a mass for you.

220
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,660
And I paid the rest to the
guards to let me in here...

221
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
and say goodbye...

222
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,990
I don't want to die...

223
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,490
Aren't you ashamed of
crying in front of a woman?

224
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,920
What man are you?

225
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,190
A man... full of life!

226
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,430
You devil!

227
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,940
My death actually suits you...

228
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,940
Do you want to get rid of me?

229
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,020
You lost your mind out of fear.

230
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,520
My bedsheet hasn't cooled yet,

231
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,640
and you're already looking for another man?

232
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,040
How dare you? I'm a decent woman.

233
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,670
I swore to you.

234
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,430
I swear to you too, I won't
leave you even after... death.

235
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,490
Martin, for God's sake,
what are you saying?

236
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,240
I'll come back from the nether
world as an evil spirit,

237
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,000
and I'll make sure no man
replaces me in your bed...

238
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,200
And, because you let them behead
me, I'll rattle with chains,

239
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,500
so that you'll never sleep till you die.

240
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,260
Brother...

241
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,030
If it wasn't for you, I'd
be preparing a funeral

242
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,560
not only for my father,
but also for my children.

243
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,870
Let Wawel be your second home.

244
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:20,700
Aren't you afraid of having
a pagan as your brother?

245
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,470
My daughters are half-Lithuanian
and half-Christian.

246
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,430
Your sister has also been baptized.

247
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,040
Perhaps you'll convert too?

248
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,330
I'll send for Giediminas to Lithuania.

249
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,920
I want all my friends to be
with me during the coronation.

250
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,880
And I'll pray for your imminent baptism.

251
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,610
Will you get baptized?

252
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,340
Who knows?

253
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,040
The act of conversion requires time.

254
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,400
Sure...

255
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,130
I know you want the best of both worlds.

256
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,130
The pope and the patriarch.

257
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,310
Whatever, when we were kids

258
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,120
you always cheated everybody at dice.

259
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,550
It's not only me who wants
the best of both worlds.

260
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,790
Praised be Jesus Christ.

261
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,790
Forever and ever.

262
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,400
I heard the Hungarian
court is coming to Wawel.

263
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Don't you need something?

264
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
I can fix anything.

265
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,960
How much?

266
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,310
A little help.

267
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,920
Bring me to the chancellor or
pass a good word on my behalf.

268
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,230
I've got so much work I
don't know where to start

269
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,940
and now the chancellor...

270
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Please, it's a matter of life and death.

271
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,340
Come later, when everything's more quiet.

272
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,850
After the funeral, after the coronation.

273
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,680
It will be too late.

274
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,400
The chancellor needs more beer, quickly!

275
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
Open the new barrel!

276
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Praised be God!

277
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,480
Are you preparing it for the chancellor?

278
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,920
Everybody's hungry and thirsty
after the procession.

279
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,550
Have they finished?

280
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,270
They have. It was beautiful.

281
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,640
What weeping, what lament!

282
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,640
And what complaints from
the lords and the clergy!

283
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,880
The human tongue can't express it.

284
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:58,090
Lord, have mercy! Spare Martin's life.

285
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,350
He may be a drunkard but not murderer.

286
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,950
Are you Martin's wife?

287
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,170
Yes! He's innocent.

288
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,970
It's me. I ordered him to find a job.

289
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,560
Now he's in the vault because of me.

290
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,900
The law is harsh but it is the law.

291
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,720
Whoever betrayed the king must be beheaded.

292
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,680
Sire, I beg you! Don't
torture him at least.

293
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,680
- Take her! - Don't torture him!

294
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,680
Don't pull out his teeth and nails!
Have mercy!

295
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,010
He won't stand it!

296
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,010
How did she get in here?

297
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,090
Stupid woman! Do you want
to lose your head too?

298
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:33,360
I don't care...

299
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,780
They're going to kill Marcin.

300
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,140
It's as if they killed me.

301
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,150
What life is it without husband?

302
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,590
You'll find another...

303
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,720
Sure...

304
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,580
When, at night, Marcin will rattle
chains and keep me awake...

305
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,440
I prefer to jump to the river...

306
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,440
What's with her?

307
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,900
She's running as if chased
by some evil spirit...

308
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,900
What have you done to her?

309
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,040
I?

310
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Damned men!

311
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,040
You're only pain in the neck!

312
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:32,620
Stop this sorcery, Egle.

313
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,480
You can't believe in two gods.

314
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,960
Or love two men.

315
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,870
That's only a childhood souvenir.

316
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,280
He's still waiting for you.

317
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:53,870
He'd better forget about me.

318
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:16,400
Mum...

319
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,650
I'm here.

320
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,560
Are you better?

321
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,970
If I were a man,

322
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,850
you'd be sitting by my side night
and day, like by the father's.

323
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,330
But you're not dying.

324
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,340
What's my fault?

325
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,700
That I wasn't born a boy?

326
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,880
You can't change the way the river flows

327
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,640
or the woman's fate.

328
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,620
So, stop complaining or
you'll die of bitterness.

329
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,650
You're most like me of all my children.

330
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,910
I knew you could achieve more.

331
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,080
That's why I demanded more from you.

332
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,980
Your highness, queen Elizabeth
and her court are in Opatowiec.

333
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,580
So, she's going to be in
Krakow in a day or two.

334
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,850
Are the rooms ready for her court?

335
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,860
Egle, what can you see?

336
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,500
Are we in danger?

337
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,990
Giltine.

338
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,580
The godess of death?

339
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,000
Somebody's going to die?

340
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,240
Egle?
