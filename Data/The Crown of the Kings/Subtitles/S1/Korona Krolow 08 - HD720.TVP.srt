1
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,860
Drink, daughter.

2
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,400
Who did it?

3
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,640
Who wanted to poison you, mum?

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,190
We'll get to know.

5
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,970
Now, I'm worried about you.

6
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,970
Drink.

7
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,150
I want to go home. To my place.

8
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,150
Take a rest first.

9
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,060
I only fainted.

10
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,320
They wanted to poison you.

11
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,440
Go with me to Sachsen.

12
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,220
You shouldn't stay here after all that happened.

13
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,220
You're sweet.

14
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,660
Mum, you care so much so that your mother is beatified.

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,600
We'll take care of this.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,230
I'll ask Rudolf.

17
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,930
He'll arrange your meeting with the pope.

18
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,490
But Casimirus can't be left alone now.

19
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,490
I can't leave him.

20
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,790
He'll manage on his own.

21
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,790
Yes, I'm praying for this,

22
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:40,510
but I can't leave now.

23
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,510
Not now.

24
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,490
It's not only about Casimirus, is it?

25
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,370
We've been attacked and

26
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,880
I need to make sure the traitors are punished.

27
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,080
It's really Casimirus's fault.

28
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,780
Everybody's saying it's the Zachs' revenge.

29
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,310
I don't believe it.

30
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,310
How long will you defend him?

31
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,940
Be calm and prudent. Don't let them provoke you.

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,200
I won't touch the envoy, but I won't forgive them the latest war.

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
The father died because of the Teutonic knights.

34
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,680
You yourself wanted to negotiate with them.

35
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,090
Be careful, they know the country is weakened by wars,

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,940
they know we have no troops,

37
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,610
let's face it, we don't pose any threat to them.

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,640
At least, don't let them know your intentions

39
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,160
If they're not afraid of us, at least make them afraid of yourself.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,720
What would Father say about this?

41
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,020
Be the king, at last, and not just the king's son!

42
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,390
Ask the Teutonic envoy in!

43
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,280
He caused so much evil and misery!

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,760
Don't indulge him so much.

45
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,890
Kunegunda, what are you saying?

46
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,760
Everybody's afraid to tell you this.

47
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,760
Casimirus isn't fit to be the king.

48
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
People laugh at him.

49
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,650
Ha can only land our family in trouble.

50
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,400
Like with Clara Zach in Hungary...

51
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,720
I don't believe Hungarians wanted to poison me.

52
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,150
And if it is Anna?

53
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,780
Mum!

54
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,000
She came to the table later than anybody...

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,620
Mum!

56
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,010
It's her brother who warned Casimirus.

57
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Don't be blinded by your hatred of her.

58
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,320
No, no, darling.

59
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,960
Algirdas tried to confuse us.

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,880
He spread rumours of Hungarian conspiracy.

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,450
I don't believe it.

62
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,740
They want to get rid of me, so that Anna becomes queen.

63
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,200
Do you really believe they would do that?

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,320
This is the position of Great Teutonic Master,

65
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Lothar von Braunschweig.

66
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,820
We also want a truce.

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,590
You should reconsider the alliance with Lithuania.

68
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,080
The pope condemned your deal with pagans.

69
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,200
The order has a mission.

70
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,800
We bring the light of Christ.

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
Mainly with sword...

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,610
Let's talk about salvation,

73
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,610
not about its tools.

74
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,260
An alliance with us against Giediminas would give you more profits.

75
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,750
That's not possible.

76
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,200
You highness knows the first commandment.

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,090
I know it well. My wife is a Christian.

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,040
Lithuanians are and will be our allies.

79
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,620
I'm only warning.

80
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,440
If you attack Christian states together,

81
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,290
there may be a crusade against Krakow.

82
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,020
Nobody wants it.

83
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,590
Spytek, you'll go to Torun.

84
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,360
What shall I tell the Great Master?

85
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
We'll sign the truce...

86
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,360
on hitherto terms.

87
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,680
Have them cleaned before the funeral.

88
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,730
I did what you told me. Free my family.

89
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,320
That's all you can get for the cup-bearer.

90
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,240
It must be the king or queen, not some courtier.

91
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,600
I don't want money, but to know if they're alive.

92
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Let me go!

93
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:33,920
You agreed. You wanted to make a profit.

94
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,160
Go back to your service.

95
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
We're waiting at the inn by the forest.

96
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,280
I beg you, don't hurt my children.

97
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,510
You're risking their lives with every moment.

98
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,630
You're to be at the inn at angelus,

99
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,960
with information for whom the bells are tolling.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,060
Don't try to lie to us anymore.

101
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,600
Your son can say prayers so beautifully.

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
It would be a pity if he died.

103
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,980
Look mum, we shared with Yolanta.

104
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,560
I'm happy you've got good hearts.

105
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,240
That's what most important in life.

106
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,680
Grandma says ten commandments are most important.

107
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,690
They're very important

108
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,100
but so are good deeds.

109
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,800
You've never spoken to them like this, what's on?

110
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,680
Their lives are in your hands. Keep an eye on them.

111
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
You don't need to worry.

112
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,440
They haven't found the traitors who wanted to poison my mother-in-law.

113
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,100
Nobody knows who else they may hurt.

114
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,260
So, the princesses aren't going to the funeral ceremony?

115
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,010
No, and they must stay here until I'm back.

116
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,520
Nobody can enter this room.

117
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,690
I can trust only you.

118
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,820
Watch my children.

119
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:05,130
And Egle, please, no more stories about dragons.

120
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,710
Take it, please.

121
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,760
- Money.
- This is the queen's decision.

122
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,490
Your husband saved her life.

123
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,490
Money won't bring him back.

124
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,950
If you want land, a village, say it.

125
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,920
Sire, forgive me, but I have a request...

126
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,190
You'll get what you want.

127
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,600
I don't want money but I have a request, a great one...

128
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,040
Accept my son, Nicholas, to the service at your court...

129
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,100
He's a good boy and he'l be useful to you.

130
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,820
Send him here right after the funeral.

131
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Chancellor, take care of him.

132
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Good bye, lady.

133
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,430
You doubted, sire.

134
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,430
There may be trouble with him.

135
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,390
Gather everyone in the hall and let them say last goodbye to the king.

136
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,390
Has the one in the vault said anything?

137
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,700
Have we got any lead?

138
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
He only brought the poison in.

139
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,540
Hang him right after the funeral.

140
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,780
Why aren't your daughters here?

141
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,020
Children need to be accustomed to death.

142
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,980
So that they don't fear it.

143
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,390
They'd better remember the king as he was alive.

144
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,310
He's alive!

145
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,040
His life will be eternal.

146
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,100
Father...

147
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,180
King Vladislav!

148
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,840
What are we to do?

149
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,600
Help your mother.

150
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,160
Why isn't he here?

151
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,980
Father!

152
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,060
Martin!

153
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,750
I brought you bread.

154
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,040
I don't want to eat.

155
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,760
I want to leave this place.

156
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,130
Help me.

157
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,880
What can I do?

158
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
You need to find the hooded one.

159
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
The one who paid me.

160
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Too late.

161
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,360
You admitted that you brought the poison.

162
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,270
I didn't know what I was carrying.

163
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,270
Did the money eclipse your mind?

164
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,920
The hooded one took me in. He said it was spice.

165
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,910
And now I have to rot in a vault... with rats.

166
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,820
- That's my husb... - Quiet, I know!

167
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,860
You said something about a hooded man, who is it?

168
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,040
I don't know, a stranger. I never saw him before.

169
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,130
Where can I find him?

170
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,240
How can I know?

171
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,520
He comes out of nowhere, Hungarians pay him.

172
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,230
And who poured the poison, him?

173
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,760
No, he didn't enter Wawel. The guard, Roch, didn't let him in.

174
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,090
He lives in Stradom. The hooded one talked to Roch only.

175
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,360
Why didn't Roch let him in? The gates were open.

176
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,790
How can I know? I'm not the guard of guards.

177
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,550
Take it.

178
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,120
Do something, stupid!

179
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,840
You're scolding me again!

180
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,300
 Rot here!

181
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:03,720
I'll be better off without you.

182
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,230
My love!

183
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,230
Come back!

184
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,000
Stay.

185
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,400
Keep looking for the traitor.

186
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,410
You'd like to have your own kids, wouldn't you?

187
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,410
With Niemierza...

188
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,130
I hardly know him.

189
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,760
He's always on a mission...

190
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,470
And you?

191
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,960
You'd like to get married, would you?

192
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,640
You like Jasko, don't you?

193
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,030
My father will never let me marry him.

194
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,760
Why? He's near the king.

195
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,980
He's from Tarnow.

196
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,340
So what?

197
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,340
I'm from Greater Poland, from Poznan.

198
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,290
Don't you understand?

199
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,870
Our families will never let us be together.

200
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,870
Can't you beg your father?

201
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,110
You don't know him...

202
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,110
He's different from yours.

203
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,260
Tell us about this love!

204
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Sure.

205
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,800
This story is called itolorauda.

206
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,420
The lady told us not to open to anybody.

207
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,130
Egle?

208
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,130
Check who's there.

209
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,130
But don't let anybody in.

210
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,620
Are you Roch?

211
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,800
No, sire. I'm Macko.

212
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,680
Where is he?

213
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,620
He finished his watch and left.

214
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,810
Have you seen Roch?

215
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,810
He went to see off the king.

216
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,480
The cook master sent this for the girls.

217
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,340
I can't let anybody in.

218
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,760
But they must be thirsty. I was to bring it to them.

219
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,380
The girl was to bring it.

220
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,710
They're preparing lunch.

221
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,130
There's nobody left for errands.

222
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,350
Is it for kids? They're thirsty.

223
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,350
We're allowed to take it only from the girl cook.

224
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,190
Or the table master.

225
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,900
I want to drink!

226
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Back to the room! You can't go out.

227
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,060
Cudka, hide the kids!

228
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,670
God forgive me!

229
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,350
My family...

230
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,350
Somewhere behind the inn... in the forest!

231
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,040
They got them... Save... my family...

232
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,160
Have you heard, prince?

233
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,240
The inn in the forest!

234
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,070
Somebody kidnapped his family. He begged to free them!

235
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,440
Lock the door! Hide the kids!

236
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,010
Treason! Follow me, quickly!

237
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,010
I'll explain on the way.

238
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:35,680
Queen Jadwiga forbids putting dragon's tongues on the table, chancellor!

239
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,480
Had they been here yesterday, Jan would be alive now.

240
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,000
Her highness says prayer is stronger.

241
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,300
Tell that to his widow. She was here to collect his body.

242
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,150
She asked the king to accept Nichloas for service at the court.

243
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,150
Holy Christ, not him!

244
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,030
Why?

245
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,820
I haven't met anybody weirder than him.

246
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,100
There will be only trouble with him.

247
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,410
The king has promised.

248
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,430
There's no other way.

249
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:22,090
I've asked so many times not to put this when I'm here.

250
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,020
Your highness, it was the chancellor's order.

251
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,130
He's still upset with having exposed you to danger yesterday.

252
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,540
The prayer's enough.

253
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,730
God will protect us then.

254
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:43,600
Your highness, everybody believes dragon's tongues protect from poison,

255
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
so why not?

256
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,010
God shouldn't mind.

257
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:51,900
How do you know what God minds?

258
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,850
This is superstition.

259
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,300
Do you remember how the father was proud of them?

260
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,970
I ordered to take them from the treasury, here...

261
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,560
They don't disturb the prayer, do they?

262
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,490
But they may do harm to salvation.

263
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,400
Poison in the castle. They wanted to kill the girls.

264
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,120
God, only the Lithuanians stayed at the castle.

265
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,430
Algirdas, Egle!

266
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,730
Go to the forest and kill them. We don't need them.

267
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,280
First, the payment.

268
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,160
Bring the proof the job's done.

269
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,920
What do you want me to bring you?

270
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,250
The crown of kings?

271
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,550
Bells aren't tolling.

272
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,680
People aren't talking.

273
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
So nobody died at the castle.

274
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,150
I did my job.

275
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,610
The money pouch.

276
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,260
The money pouch.

277
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,080
My daughters.

278
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,360
Yolanta, come to me.

279
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,930
Come, don't worry.

280
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,620
Michal and Rafal, follow me.

281
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
Stay with them.

282
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,830
Take them alive!

283
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,420
We need to deliver them alive!

284
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,340
Kill me, but tell me Casimirus is dead.

285
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,120
Are you a Zach?

286
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,010
It's impossible, all of them are dead!

287
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,120
Speak!

288
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,710
Go to hell, pagan scum!

289
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,640
Clara didn't deserve to die.

290
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,670
And your king doesn't deserve to live.

291
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,670
Where's your man in the hood?

292
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,440
Speak!

293
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,440
You'll never find him.

294
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,200
The Zachs' revenge will reach you.
