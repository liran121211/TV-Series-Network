1
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,600
Lady...

2
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,390
Let's keep this conversation between us.

3
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,650
Let's cancel today's council.

4
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,910
Let's eat a family lunch without politics.

5
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,650
But all the princes can't
wait to talk about it.

6
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,160
That's why I need your help.

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,880
I don't want to create an opportunity

8
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,040
for anybody to attack him
or question his position.

9
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,360
What kind of an idea is this?

10
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,750
He'll manage.

11
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,180
But these conflicts won't do any good.

12
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,590
Vladislav nominated
Casimirus for the throne.

13
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,950
You heard it.

14
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,260
Isn't it enough to make everybody shut up?

15
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,370
Let him defend his crown.

16
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,720
What if he doesn't convince them?

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,930
Then we'll invoke the dead king's will.

18
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,140
What if they mutiny?

19
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,140
New times are coming.

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:47,180
Now even women can inherit the crown.

21
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,410
Are you afraid of this, my lady?

22
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,220
My daughters disappointed me very much.

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,120
One stood against her brother

24
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,720
and the other didn't even come.

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,090
Queen Elizabeth will come for sure.

26
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,480
Elizabeth has always been your soft spot.

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,350
I am her godfather!

28
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,970
If your husband does what he
promised, you'll be fine.

29
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,600
My husband will never betray the king!

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,700
This has already happened. Now
he has to do what he promised.

31
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,130
Have mercy! Release the children!

32
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,850
Keep me, but let the kids go!

33
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,470
This doesn't depend on me.

34
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,850
Help! Help!

35
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,390
Enough!

36
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,970
Now, only your husband can save you.

37
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,240
/Hungarian/ At last! At
last I can hear crying.

38
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,660
/Hungarian/ This is all
king Casimirus's fault.

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,990
I have to come in!

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,510
Excuse me, lady, but the cook master
says he's got an important issue.

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,320
Excuse me, but it's very urgent.

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,880
Speak!

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,140
I'm afraid poison has been
brought into the castle.

44
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,080
Afraid? I don't understand.

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,080
Has it been brought in or not?

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,320
Excuse me, lady, but I can't be sure.

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,870
I appreciate your concern, but I
don't know what the issue is?

48
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,530
Who are you suspecting?

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,390
I'm not sure.

50
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,600
When you find the suspect, bring him to me.

51
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,930
Even the slightest betrayal
must be punished severely.

52
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,840
One more thing,

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,250
tell the table master and the
cup bearer to test every dish.

54
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,000
For everybody

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,390
We must be careful and very strict.

56
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,520
It will be enough.

57
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
As you wish, my lady.

58
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,170
Why was I so foolish to return here?

59
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,170
He must have gone to the queen.

60
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,730
They're going to torture me.

61
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,760
I don't understand why I
came here from Lituhuania

62
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,160
and can't get adjusted for so many years...

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,900
Don't report on me to the
queen, she hates Lithuanians

64
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,440
They'd better push me of the cliff or cut,

65
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,560
I don't want tortures...

66
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,120
- Say who brought the poison - Not me.

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,480
Don't you remember any
stranger in our kitchen?

68
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,160
There was one on the day the king died.

69
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
He helped carry bags with flour.

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
He said he was looking
for a job and for you.

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
I chased him away.

72
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,130
Do you remember how he looked?

73
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:40,170
Like a common man, not much
brain, even less shame...

74
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,320
Knead the dough.

75
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,640
And cook enough groats, so
it's enough for everybody.

76
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,670
Didn't you report on me to the queen?

77
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,040
If you had wanted to
poison the king's family,

78
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,640
you'd have done it long ago...

79
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,480
It will end badly.

80
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,520
It would be better if
Casimirus persuaded them

81
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,930
rather than ruled against them.

82
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,190
They should obey the king's will.

83
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,660
Soon, everybody will want
to have something to say.

84
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,330
And these rumours of
Hungarian conspirators.

85
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,600
This must end!

86
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
And my cook who sees poison everywhere.

87
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,100
The guards watch everything night and day.

88
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,100
That's not enough, castellan.

89
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,820
Find the culprits and give
them to the executioner.

90
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,880
Let people see we'll not spare anybody

91
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
the sooner it happens, the better.

92
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,130
But, my lady, we don't know
who the conspirators are...

93
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,010
So, have another criminal beheaded.

94
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,310
Make them fear

95
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,850
let anyone who stands up against
the king know the consequences.

96
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:56,640
Fear is the best guard.

97
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,280
If only my mother knew
that we do it during Lent

98
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,610
after Father's death...

99
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:30,350
If you didn't think of your
mother when you're with me

100
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:33,120
and think of me when
you're with your mother

101
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
all of us would be better off.

102
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,880
Oh, a crown again!

103
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Divination is a sin!

104
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,320
Do you believe God looks into our bedroom

105
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,800
and sees these scattered wheat ears?

106
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,280
I don't know.

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,160
Ask Father Wojciech about it.

108
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,890
Do you know he's been here?

109
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,260
I'm the future king.

110
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,020
I know what my wife's doing.

111
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,120
But you don't know what she's going to do.

112
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
And I saw it...

113
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
I don't believe such sorcery.

114
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,680
I make decisions, do you understand?

115
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,980
Not blind fate...

116
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,080
Not my mother.

117
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,660
I!

118
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,650
Will you persuade your
mother to my coronation?

119
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,040
And will you have a new crown made for me?

120
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,280
But such one with many jewels and
so that I could dance in it?

121
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,350
Is Casimirus with his wife?

122
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,200
They're discussing matters of the kingdom.

123
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,620
- The guests are gathering for the council.
- No one can disturb them.

124
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,100
Superb embroidery...

125
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,830
As if the ornament flowed from
your fingers on the canvas...

126
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,400
This is for Niemierza of Golcza.

127
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,510
My knight.

128
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,750
Is he an envoy again?

129
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,040
I'm not allowed to discuss it.

130
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,430
I am.

131
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,800
I know where he went and what for.

132
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Do you know anything about my father?

133
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,920
Don't worry. He's the bravest of knights.

134
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,420
He will return.

135
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,420
Everybody's waiting.

136
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,800
You could have knocked.

137
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,430
I'd have had to kill Cudka,
or tie her, at least.

138
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,040
Such guard would be useful
at the gates of Wawel.

139
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,780
Help Anna get dressed.

140
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,570
And you, sire?

141
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,730
I'm not going ot dress up.

142
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,570
Martin, you'd better go back.

143
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:28,040
Again, you're ducking out of work.

144
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,860
Come on, you're not working today either.

145
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,310
The axes are sharpened,
but the vaults are empty.

146
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,580
So help us carry bags.

147
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,330
We need to bring groats to Wawel.

148
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,330
More and more guests are
coming to the king's funeral.

149
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,580
Your woman's making money from
it, so what to worry about?

150
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,040
If only you knew...

151
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,970
Laudetur lesus Christus.

152
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,990
I'd better go.

153
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,780
I've got work to do.

154
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:14,360
My old woman's not a weakling, but still...

155
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,520
She won't carry everything
to Wawel by herself.

156
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,790
Why are you looking at them?

157
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,610
Martin, be careful.

158
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,190
You can't touch an envoy.

159
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,600
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

160
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,680
I won't sit at the table with them.
I don't trust strangers.

161
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,680
There are too many of them around.

162
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
Algirdas, they're not so dangerous.

163
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,960
I've got a bad premonition.

164
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,280
Who'd dare to use poison at the castle?

165
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,730
Everyone. I saw those
in the throne chamber.

166
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:09,720
One would be happy to pour
poison the the other's cup.

167
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,160
Send this beauty away, I advise you.

168
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,470
Cudka?

169
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,120
I brought her up.

170
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
This didn't make her uglier.

171
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,470
She's got her knight. Niemierza of Golcza.

172
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,380
This won't be an obstacle to your husband.

173
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,380
Send her to the old woman.

174
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,830
Keep Egle. You can trust her.

175
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,520
I can take care of myself.

176
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,160
I know. But send her away.

177
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,200
Are you out of mind?

178
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,460
Where have you been?

179
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
I checked if they're alive.

180
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,190
What are you looking for?

181
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,800
A proof that we're serious.

182
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:16,040
What do you want to do?

183
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,700
I'll pay a visit. In Wawel.

184
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,330
What beer to serve? Weaker or stronger?

185
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,560
Serve mead.

186
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
But we were to fast.

187
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,490
For me, only herbs. For the
guests, the best mead.

188
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,290
I want everyone to make a toast.
For the king.

189
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,290
Hurry!

190
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,090
Let's not delay it, gentlemen.

191
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,560
Say what's on your mind.

192
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,050
Casimirus, let me begin.

193
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,740
"The mighty will be mightily
tormented", says the Book of Wisdom.

194
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,630
God is the strictest evaluator of kings

195
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,180
but the book also says that

196
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,830
"Whoever seeks wisdom will
find her sitting at the door."

197
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,410
My lords, rise.

198
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,700
I want to make a toast.

199
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,950
Long live Casimirus, king of Poland.

200
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,830
I disagree!

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,280
I'm king Vladislav's grandson.

202
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,600
Why do we need a king?

203
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,920
Instead of coronation, let's
just partition the land,

204
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,090
like our great grandfather Boleslaw did.

205
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,610
We're all equal.

206
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,610
Quiet!

207
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,310
Let's hear what prince Bolko has to say.

208
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,840
What right do you have to undermine the
will of king Vladislav and the pope?

209
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,910
I'll accuse you of betrayal.

210
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,270
Do it.

211
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,820
Do it, mother.

212
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,240
Show how you love the family.

213
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
But remember, "the mighty
will be mightily tormented."

214
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,190
Don't invoke the Scripture in such anger.

215
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,750
My sister and I had to obey.

216
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,360
Marry whom you told us,

217
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
go where you sent us.

218
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,950
Elizabeth is a queen,

219
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,220
Casimirus will soon be king,

220
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,730
and I?

221
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,560
Have you ever thought about me?

222
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Quiet.

223
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,950
Let him speak.

224
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,150
Look, is he to be the king? A mute?

225
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:00,970
Speak, son!

226
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,050
Where are the queen's herbs?

227
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,760
Over there!

228
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,460
Take it to the table, quickly!

229
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,790
Put it here.

230
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,760
That's him!

231
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,920
He was here with the millers
and tampered with the shelf!

232
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,680
That's him!

233
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,700
Are you sure?

234
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,640
I recognize him!

235
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,510
Guards!

236
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,420
You said you were looking
for a job, confess!

237
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,070
You're lying, woman!

238
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,500
Who would let him in the castle?

239
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,300
What's on?

240
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
I didn't want to kill the king.

241
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,400
Give it to me. I'll bring it.

242
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,040
Go back to the kitchen,
you're needed there.

243
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,490
I have to do it myself.

244
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,850
I'll bring it.

245
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,240
To the cup-bearer.

246
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Of course.

247
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,310
Why is it so hot?

248
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,880
Do I work in the kitchen?

249
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,510
They asked, so I brought it.

250
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,930
A son or a grandson may be the king.

251
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,690
You fled at Plowce.

252
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,690
We don't want a coward as the king.

253
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,940
You have a big mouth and
only in Wawel, uncle.

254
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,390
But who could you stand
against in the field?

255
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,770
He's right!

256
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,020
Listen to him!

257
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,050
In my own castle... My nephew...

258
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,340
Wait them out, let them talk.

259
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,300
There's poison in the castle.

260
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,100
You know our achievements.

261
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,100
You know who fled from the battlefield.

262
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,230
Casimirus.

263
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,230
Who defeated the Czechs?

264
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,230
I.

265
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,420
I'm innocent. I brought spices.

266
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,570
A man came, paid, told me to bring it.

267
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,520
So I brought it.

268
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,280
Just a pouch. I didn't know it's poison.
Have mercy, castellan.

269
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,890
But later, I did penance.

270
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,640
Who gave you this? Or
you're going to the vault.

271
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,490
A stranger. I never saw him again.

272
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,760
What did he look like.

273
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,200
Hooded but not a monk.

274
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Big, but not tall.

275
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
Strange because he paid in advance.

276
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Where is it?

277
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,540
He drank it away.

278
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,440
To the vault.

279
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,750
I know where they meet.
I'll tell you everything.

280
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,940
They?

281
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,800
The hooded one and... Hungarians.

282
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Hungarians?

283
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
Are you sure?

284
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,870
You can't mistake their language.

285
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,400
Why do we need the crown?

286
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,120
We have strong duchies.

287
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,370
We're good rulers, each on his own.

288
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,960
They caught the one who brought poison.

289
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,170
Go to the guards and learn who sent them.

290
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,720
I wanted...

291
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,620
What did you want?

292
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,250
Doesn't matter.

293
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,250
Tell me what's happening.
What are they saying?

294
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,150
Prince Bolko says he'll be a better king.

295
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,150
And what did Casimirus say?

296
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,150
Did he oppose him?

297
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,410
I saw how Casimirus looks at you.

298
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,840
Be careful.

299
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,850
We have peace with princes of Stettin.

300
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,400
We live on good terms
with the Wittelsbachs.

301
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,560
Brandenburg poses no danger to us.

302
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,850
Let's share.

303
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,440
It's easier to govern a duchy
than the whole kingdom.

304
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,650
Lower costs, so life is easier.

305
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,720
Enough.

306
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,060
We're not partitioning the kingdom.

307
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
The king's already up there,

308
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,870
he sacrificed his life to unite Poland,

309
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,480
and what did you sacrifice?

310
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,340
I'll never let you ruin it!

311
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,940
You want only the crown, don't you?

312
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,570
No, Bolko. I want time.

313
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,700
Here. I drank with them here.

314
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,610
You're lying?

315
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,120
Here, I swear.

316
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,320
Kill him on the spot.

317
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,120
Who was with them?

318
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,140
I said, Hungarians.

319
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,920
What did they look like?

320
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,720
Two young ones, one tall.

321
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,460
One young with a scar on his cheek.

322
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,150
Did he pay?

323
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,350
No, the hooded one.

324
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,240
I'll crush his skull!

325
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
Not here, my lord!

326
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Yes, he'll tell you I'm innocent.

327
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,900
Do you know him?

328
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,900
Of course, everybody knows him.

329
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,220
The last time I saw him,
he drank with Hungarians.

330
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,320
They were very generous.

331
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,920
You'll hang. That's for sure.

332
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,920
It's not me. It's the hooded one.

333
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,240
He either threatens or
tempts with money. Devil!

334
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,650
Was there anybody hooded with them?

335
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:38,680
No, only he and the Hungarians.

336
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,610
What do I pay you for?

337
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,650
Go away!

338
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,650
You were not to come here.

339
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,650
I'm waiting for the bells tolling.

340
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,580
I did what you wanted. Free my children.

341
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,930
- You swore. - Of course.

342
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,150
Where are they?

343
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,360
With the Hungarians.

344
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,080
Do your job.

345
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,640
Come to the inn.

346
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
You'll get the reward...

347
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,180
and your family.

348
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:41,360
You know what to do next.

349
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:50,360
Close the gate. Don't let any stranger in.

350
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,230
Bring him to the vault.

351
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,040
Have the whole Wawel searched.

352
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,000
Sire, should we let those in?

353
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,060
Who are you?

354
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,470
An envoy from the Great Master
Lothar von Braunschweig.

355
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,010
Should we let the envoy in?

356
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,460
We can't separate, Przemysl,
because there will be war again.

357
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,990
And not only at the borders
but also between us.

358
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,480
There will be war in the family,

359
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,360
and people are tired with
war, they're afraid.

360
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:27,840
You're afraid.

361
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:34,330
You say partitions wer better.
Maybe then, but not today.

362
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,820
Today we're not a power state,
but we can be one tomorrow.

363
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,320
Charles Robert's building a strong Hungary.

364
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,190
Jan of Bohemia strengthened teh Czechs.

365
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,700
My father-in-law, Giediminas,
rules a great country.

366
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Pagan!

367
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,360
And the Teutonic knights?

368
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,060
You'll never defeat them.

369
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,050
Let's share.

370
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:53,050
Let Casimirus speak!

371
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:55,680
My mother, queen of Poland is right.

372
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,320
"The mighty will be mightily tormented",

373
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
so before you say, "Let's
partition Poland",

374
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,210
think if your children will be free.

375
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,730
The Teutonic knights are only
waiting till Poland is weaker

376
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,790
We need to act united because
only then are we strong!

377
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,800
I was at the father's death.

378
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:19,150
I swore I'll recover Kuyavia,
and I'll keep my word.

379
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,760
He's dead.

380
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,050
Poison.

381
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,380
Treason at Wawel!
