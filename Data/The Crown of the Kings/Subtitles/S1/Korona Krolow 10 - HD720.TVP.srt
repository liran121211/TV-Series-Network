1
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,490
Is it your first time at Wawel?

2
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,610
/German/ Careful!

3
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,140
At last!

4
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,140
Difficult road!

5
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,220
Crowded! Had to wait!

6
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,220
For the last moment...

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,430
What's written here?

8
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,580
I see Casimirus, but here...

9
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,080
De... gra...

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,560
Dei gratia

11
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,480
Dei gratia - God's mercy, my son!

12
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
- I didn't look straight! - Not straight!

13
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,160
Give me a bowl and wax.

14
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,280
Beautiful...

15
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,960
Pity they don't make such in Krakow.

16
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
Don't take our jobs away!

17
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,810
Is Elizabeth here?

18
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,620
Tell me, mum. Nobody wants
to tell me anything.

19
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,030
Easy, Kunegunda.

20
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,030
Tell me!

21
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,620
No, I don't want!

22
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,610
You have to drink this medicine.
You've got fever.

23
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,680
Mum!

24
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,860
See? I'm drinking and I'm fine.

25
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,600
These are good herbs,
from Tyniec monastery.

26
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,710
You did it for me...

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,330
Drink!

28
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
Mum!

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,160
They're not so bitter.

30
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,320
Will you stay with me?

31
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,570
- Yes. - You will.

32
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,930
Lady! Queen Elizabeth has arrived.

33
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,050
She's come. At last!

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
We were worried, sister.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I sent another knight!

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,370
Mum prayed so much with a rosary
that she'll go straight to heaven!

37
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,840
The medics didn't allow me to go.

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,100
Then snow fell and Charles
didn't let me go.

39
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,200
And I didn't let Pelka go back.

40
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,830
I wanted to get to know everything myself.

41
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,720
He told me about you, the war
with the Teutonic Order,

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,690
about his daughter you took care of here.

43
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,740
Is Yolanta's mother dead for a long time?

44
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,360
The girl can hardly remember her.

45
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,360
Are you sure she's my child?

46
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,680
I wouldn't have sent her to you.

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Why doesn't she speak?

48
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,330
She's not a mute. It's
simply her experiences.

49
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,650
I'm sorry, brother. I didn't
expect they would follow her here.

50
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,630
God, if something happened to you...

51
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,930
So, from the beginning I was their target.

52
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,800
I should have let you know.

53
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,940
Hadn't it been for Algirdas,
my daughter could be dead.

54
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,090
Where are the traitors?
We've got to sentence them.

55
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,660
In the vault.

56
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,370
We'll take care if it after the funeral.

57
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,400
No Hungarian can endanger the
life of the Polish king.

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,930
People need to know we won't spare...

59
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,500
The mass is coming soon!

60
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,890
Let's wait with it.

61
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,180
You need to act fast, trust me.

62
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,180
It's always safer this way.

63
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,390
You shouldn't delay the punishment.

64
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,560
Elizabeth!

65
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,620
At last!

66
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,840
At last we're all together.

67
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,320
How is Elizabeth dressed?

68
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,900
Is she wearing black or more fancy?

69
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,420
Your sister's asking about you, duchess!

70
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,160
Nobody's asking about
me and nobody needs me.

71
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
They should have poisoned me.

72
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Don't say that, duchess.

73
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,940
Casimirus on the throne,
Elizabeth on the throne...

74
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,390
I'm only a duke's wife.

75
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,160
We were brought up together.

76
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,740
Elizabeth will start with
her paternalistic tone...

77
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,740
How I dislike it...

78
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,250
Little sister!

79
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,630
Your highness!

80
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,630
How are you?

81
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,630
Mum said you're sick.

82
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,680
Elizabeth...

83
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,960
Charles is ready to send his knights

84
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,490
if anyone defies our father's will.

85
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,680
It's good you're here.

86
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,110
You don't even know what's going on here.

87
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,110
You'll tell me everything.

88
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,110
My Kunegunda.

89
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,820
It's good you came.

90
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,680
Spytek!

91
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,250
At last, I'm at home!

92
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,320
Talk to your knight!

93
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,360
I'll be there soon!

94
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,550
Cudka!

95
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,800
It's for you!

96
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,550
Straight from Visegrad.

97
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,400
Try it on!

98
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,920
They say they're most
fashionable in Europe now.

99
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,860
But...

100
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,180
I can't take it.

101
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,590
It's good you're close to Casimirus.

102
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,210
He needs you very much, Spytek.

103
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,130
And your Jasko's become a knight!

104
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,450
I promised the king, and you
know I love him as my own son.

105
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,450
How is he doing?

106
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,680
I remember Father worried about him.

107
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,280
We both know his character...

108
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,680
He was very touched by the king's death.

109
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,200
But I hope he learnt from this situation

110
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,070
and he's recovering now, he'll be fine.

111
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,640
Can I help?

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,930
Don't hide anything from her, Spytek!

113
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,590
Tell her what Anna is doing.

114
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,240
Her maid refused baptism.

115
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,000
She does sorcery at the castle.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,090
And Algirdas...

117
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:14,860
By the way, didn't your son
want the crown for himself?

118
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,030
Or so I heard.

119
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,020
For God's sake, Kunegunda, I don't
know why you persuaded him to do this.

120
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,820
Be careful! Here walls have ears.

121
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,860
Nobody will forgive and forget anything.

122
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,720
I won't forget what Casimirus
did at your court.

123
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,940
Calm down. We came here to
support him, not attack.

124
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,670
That's true, duchess.

125
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,080
We promised the king loyalty.

126
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,920
So, Spytek. Tell us what people
say of the Hungarian conspiracy.

127
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
What are you talking about, Kunegunda?

128
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,680
Didn't you know? Really?

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Didn't you know those people
planned to kill Casimirus?

130
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,700
Enough, I won't let anybody offend me.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,530
Elizabeth, Casimirus is waiting
for you in the chancery, hurry!

132
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,250
We're starting soon.

133
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,650
Has something happened?

134
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,650
Did you have an argument?

135
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,080
No, everything's fine, mum.

136
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,400
Pray together, Kunegunda
needs this very much.

137
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,370
Maybe grace of wisdom will fall upon her.

138
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,670
I don't want this dress.

139
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,760
A poor relative.

140
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,560
Have you seen how beautiful
Elizabeth's dress is?

141
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,390
So much embroidery and gold!

142
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,600
Do you think it makes her happier?

143
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,820
You've got one jewel more than her.

144
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,670
You've got a good heart.
Nothing else matters.

145
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,400
Now I'll be haunted by
three Casimirus's women:

146
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,080
Mother, sister Crazy and sister Queen.

147
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,630
And I'm all alone.

148
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,300
You're not alone. You've got Casimirus.

149
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,090
And that's a lot!

150
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,730
You should be happy because
he always stands by you.

151
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,730
Bring them in!

152
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,440
The sentence is to be read in
Visegrad during every mass.

153
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,400
You'll have it sent as soon
as we put our seals down.

154
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,870
Queen!

155
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,280
Laslo?

156
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,280
Istvan?

157
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,250
After so many years of
service at our court?

158
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,740
Lady, today is the king's funeral.
Pardon them.

159
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,400
We don't want pardon but Casimirus's death.

160
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,810
Off with their heads.

161
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,740
- This is my will. - No.

162
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,000
Hold it.

163
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,110
Beautiful! I'll do it the Lithuanian way.

164
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,900
We don't serve it this way.

165
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,060
What will you treat Elizabeth's court with?

166
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,800
You've seen how many have come.

167
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,870
It's Lent, not a binge.

168
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,120
I'll do it really well.
You won't be embarrassed.

169
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,890
I'll use horse radish
leaves and cure it first...

170
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,240
I said!

171
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,560
You won't do it.

172
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Everything's ready. The oven's hot.

173
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes. The oven's hot. We're by the oven
and there's the king's funeral there.

174
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,940
I served Vladislav for so many years,
and now I can't even see him off.

175
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,660
So, go!

176
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:02,030
He was important to you. I will manage.

177
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,540
We'll prepare everything as it should be.

178
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,280
No fish, no Lithuanian food, as you wish.

179
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,210
- Such an important event! - Go!

180
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,960
I'll promise I'll listen to the cook.

181
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,000
So, do it.

182
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,650
So, do it, do it the way you want.

183
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,490
Let them see how great
Lithuanian dishes are.

184
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,740
So, go now.

185
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,290
I'm going.

186
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,870
Do you prefer death to pardon?

187
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,110
You don't deserve death.

188
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,750
Death would be pardon.

189
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,310
Casimirus, the bells are tolling.

190
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,250
You should hang, murderer.

191
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,310
For Clara.

192
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,680
For Ferdinand.

193
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,520
- They will be aven... - Silence!

194
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,050
I sentence you to torture.
Chancellor, make sure it happens.

195
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,720
They're to suffer till they beg for death.

196
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,840
Take them!

197
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,780
Send it to Visegrad as soon as possible.

198
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,450
My husband needs to know the
Zachs' case is finally over.

199
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,320
You know what to do!

200
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,920
Yes, I'm to follow the knight.

201
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Do you know which one?

202
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,650
This is knight Pelka.

203
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,790
He's putting on the king
Vladislav's armour.

204
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,310
Father, what honour...

205
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,510
There's no more honourable knight among us.

206
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,750
This is the king's cape.

207
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,310
Pelka, I'm happy it's you.

208
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,080
The king admired you very much.

209
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,260
Where's your husband?

210
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,630
You can't go without him.

211
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,680
Accept my gratitude.

212
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
I heard that but for you

213
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,260
the princesses could be dead.

214
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,070
I saved my sister's daughters,

215
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,740
they're half Lithuanians. Accept the fact.

216
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,490
Is your brother always so cheeky?

217
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,220
He's so gentle with you
that I can't recognize him.

218
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,080
Where's Yolanta?

219
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,090
Where you sent her, with our daughters.

220
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,820
She was in danger. She's
Casimirus's child, our blood.

221
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,980
Let's go.

222
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,440
The first one's wearing the king's cape.

223
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,330
The one in black is death.

224
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,180
Death? It's a knight!

225
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,710
That means the king is dead.

226
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:59,610
/praying in Latin/

227
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:12,990
God, have mercy on my lord's soul.

228
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,090
Elizabeth...

229
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,360
Please, sit next to me.

230
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
I want to talk to Anna.

231
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,950
Kunegunda...

232
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,480
Thank you, I'll be here, on the other side.

233
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,100
Sit next to me.

234
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,270
Do you mind?

235
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,270
It's great honour.

236
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:44,110
Ask my cook for the wine I brought.

237
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,110
Elizabeth, it's Lent.

238
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,320
Even the pope in Avignon
drinks wine in Lent.

239
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,070
Don't worry, I didn't bring anything
that would break your rules.

240
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,140
Queen, am I to pour?

241
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,810
Mother, please agree.

242
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,290
It's our best Cerman wine.

243
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,640
All right, but just for trying.

244
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,560
Let's keep this wine for
Casimirus's coronation.

245
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,330
Forgive us.

246
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
Casimirus, I need you for a moment.

247
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,580
The sentence was announced.

248
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,110
You know I can't do anything for you.

249
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,110
Why did you call me?

250
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,680
You do it for us. Yes, you!

251
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,430
- Kill king Casimirus! - You're insane!

252
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,680
Avenge your countrymen. There
won't be a better opportunity.

253
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,680
Did he suffer?

254
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:35,120
More because of the loss of
Kuyavia than the illness.

255
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,530
You knew him.

256
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,730
You know what mattered to him.

257
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,560
What did he say? Did he mention me?

258
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:51,870
Yes, he asked to say goodbye to you.

259
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,720
He said how he was proud of you,

260
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,380
how well you rule.

261
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,510
What did he really tell you?

262
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,800
Not to trust the Teutonic
knights and recapture Kuyavia.

263
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,850
Remember you can count on us.

264
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:15,310
Charles will send troops if
anyone disturbs the coronation.

265
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,310
I hope it won't happen.
