1
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,250
Get up, get up!

2
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,680
What's going on?

3
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,050
Go, wake up my husband!

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,280
Tell him to come to my chamber at once!

5
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,740
I came for the payment.

6
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,800
But you haven't done it yet.

7
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
I was to deliever it to
the kitchen and I did.

8
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,050
I was to find a man at the
castle and I did. Pay me!

9
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:55,340
The bells aren't tolling.
That means nobody died.

10
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,340
God takes life away, not me.

11
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,850
Tell your man to do his
job and then I'll pay.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,200
Do you remember the plan?

13
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,110
First, the old woman, then the kids...

14
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,620
and Casimirus, in the end.

15
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,310
He's to see the suffering of his family.

16
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,620
Like we saw the death of the Zachs.

17
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,620
Casimirus is a murderer.

18
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,820
When they start dying, they'll
reinforce the guards.

19
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,820
It will get harder and harder.

20
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,170
You know we can be generous.

21
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,680
You're going to make it!

22
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,710
Algirdas?

23
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,820
You're still here?

24
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,480
Egle...

25
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,510
You were to leave...

26
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,820
Listen to him!

27
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,310
I was on my way...

28
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:41,570
At the inn behind the forest
we overheard the Hungarians...

29
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,250
They're scheming against you!

30
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:43,970
Impossible!

31
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,280
They mentioned your name...

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,200
Who was that? Names!

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,570
Some rich lords, maybe from
your sister's court...

34
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,340
Nonsense!

35
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,360
Are you accusing me of lying?

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,780
Are you accusing my sister?

37
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,320
If you died, her husband
would become king of Poland.

38
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,420
Now you'll die! Jasko, sword!

39
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,400
Enough!

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,770
- Coward...
- Traitor!

41
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,450
- It's you who betrayed... my sister!
- I'll kill you!

42
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,130
Calm down!

43
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,390
My people are following them
but you have to be careful.

44
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,390
Reinforce the guards.

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,470
I'll let Mother know.

46
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,200
So, you can't govern yourself...

47
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,630
Easy, easy!

48
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,610
She should know. You need to warn her too.

49
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,610
I'll let her know.

50
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,360
I'd take Aldona and the kids to Vilnius.
It's safer there.

51
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,710
I can protect my family.

52
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,270
I know. That's why you
should send them with me!

53
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,440
Mum!

54
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,050
Please, think it over.

55
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,000
Bolko will make a better king.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,760
He's a good commander...

57
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,410
He's good with books...

58
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,030
And Casimirus...

59
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,890
Even Elizabeth is tired
of hiding his crimes...

60
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,400
She's been hushing up the Zachs'
case for so many years...

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,090
Crown Bolko and the scandals will die away.

62
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,570
Daughter, I don't know why you're
attacking your brother so much...

63
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,960
It's so painful to me.
Why are you doing this?

64
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,960
I'm fighting for my son.

65
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,960
Like you for yours.

66
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,960
Mum I need to talk to you.

67
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,500
Can you leave us alone?

68
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Brother, pray with us
for the father's soul.

69
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,540
Later, Kunegunda.

70
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,470
There's nothing more important
than prayer, is there, mother?

71
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,540
Yes, of course, we'll pray together, but...

72
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,800
now, please, leave us alone for a moment...

73
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,890
Save your soul...

74
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,600
You won't forgive yourself if
anything happens to the kids...

75
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,230
I won't flee...

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,310
He's waiting for you...

77
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,070
He hasn't married...

78
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,920
He's at Kestutis's court...

79
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,930
Am I to leave my husband?

80
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:17,560
An unfaithful husband, a
disrespectful mother-in-law

81
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,480
this strange castle...

82
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,320
I agreed for it 8 years ago...

83
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,580
Casimirus won't hold for long

84
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,720
Almost all his cousins
wander around the Wawel

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
They pretend they follow the king's will

86
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
but they want power for themselves.

87
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,080
Cousins...

88
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,240
Well, but promise me I won't meet him.

89
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,420
You're afraid of yourself...

90
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,070
Get ready.

91
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,370
You're coming home.

92
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,090
I don't believe in the plot.

93
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,620
Maybe they're common travellers.

94
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,620
He came back because of this.

95
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,900
Maybe Algirdas is trying to
set you against your sister.

96
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,910
He's accusing your only
allies of plotting, really?

97
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,090
What if he's right?

98
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:24,190
How many times have I heard of
plots, magic, poisoned books?

99
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:27,660
He heard something at the inn
and now he's inspiring panic

100
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,150
I won't let pagans disturb
the king's funeral!

101
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,820
Drink, these herbs can cure...

102
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,820
and soothe nerves...

103
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,160
I'm considering Anna and the
kids hiding somewhere...

104
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,960
Will she agree to that?

105
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,640
Fresh herbs for the queen.

106
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,270
Her highness is fasting, in fact..

107
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,960
And who's that for?

108
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,340
For my lady.

109
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,920
Bring it before it cools.

110
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,460
I feel you're hiding something from me.

111
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,800
I'll keep an eye on you.

112
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,480
You'd better keep an eye
on those who bring this.

113
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,400
The lady complained the food is
not only poor but also cold.

114
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,020
It's a good idea.

115
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,060
Anna should go away.

116
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,730
This way it will be safer.

117
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,890
You said there's no danger.

118
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,890
I don't believe in plots but

119
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,680
the presence of Anna and kids
at the castle poses a problem.

120
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,610
And these Lithuanians...
I can barely stand them.

121
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,120
Mother, please!

122
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,480
Casimirus, don't you understand?

123
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,480
If her brother persuades her to go, use it!

124
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,230
Persuade her it's for her benefit.

125
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,120
Little princesses will be safe, and...

126
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,710
your coronation more peaceful.

127
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,760
My coronation?

128
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,820
Or your crown?

129
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,640
There's only one crown of the queen.

130
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,250
Anna has to wait.

131
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,970
What is it?

132
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,380
To hell with that Polish fasting! Let's go!

133
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,920
First, I'll talk to Casimirus and Jadwiga.

134
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll tell them I'll be back for coronation.

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,720
I've been waiting for 8 years for that day.

136
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,880
Do you always have to take a risk?

137
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,050
Even with your own life?

138
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:49,340
I won't give up. Not now.

139
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,400
We have to hurry. My people may be exposed.

140
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,510
Algirdas! You can rely on them, can't you?

141
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,740
Go away! Why have you come here?

142
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,680
Give this coin to daddy.

143
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,910
Ask him to buy something for
you when comes back home.

144
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,460
Thank you, sir.

145
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,920
Tell him I'm waiting for him here,

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,520
and I'd like to hear good news.

147
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,440
It's still a child!

148
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,920
You know the way to Wawel, don't you?

149
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,580
I'll be there quick as a flash, sir!

150
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,210
There's not much gold, but the
celebrations must be befitting.

151
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,880
The cook master can spend
as much as he wants.

152
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,170
And is this tomb necessary now?

153
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,680
- Maybe a bit later? - No!

154
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,060
Get the best artist and let him begin.

155
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,790
You summoned us, sire.

156
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,900
Reinforce guards at the gate and the walls.

157
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,770
Pay attention to any strangers.

158
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,680
Are you afraid of something?

159
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,680
I want to be sure the castle is safe.

160
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Cook master! Check all deliveries.

161
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,280
Buy only from trusted merchants.

162
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Yes, your highness.

163
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,400
But her highness, the queen,
already told us to be careful.

164
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,520
I appreciate her thoughtfulness,
but you can't just be careful.

165
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,600
You must be certain the castle is safe.

166
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,600
My family can be scared at the table.

167
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,120
I can vouch for all my people.

168
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:34,760
And you?

169
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,840
So can I.

170
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Be watchful.

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,730
What's going on? Why aren't you at work?

172
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,360
I'm not going back to Wawel. I'm scared.

173
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,700
Scared of what?

174
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
- The cook master threatens you. - No.

175
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,010
I saw a strange pouch and two dead rats.

176
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,420
Have you never seen rat poison?

177
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,970
Rat poison in spices?

178
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,250
- Did you tell the cook master? - No!

179
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,970
Why?

180
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,190
Because he wouldn't believe me.

181
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,850
He hates me from the very beginning.

182
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,020
What did you do with this pouch?

183
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,440
Nothing. It disappeared.

184
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,290
So, what are you afraid of?

185
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,140
Because if someone gets
posioned, they'll blame me.

186
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,480
If you run away now, they'll
blame you even more.

187
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,240
You've been serving your
lady for so many years.

188
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,600
- Go back! - No!

189
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,220
You must prove you're
devoted to them and useful.

190
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
Not all ends badly.

191
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,910
Vytautas, I'm scared!

192
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,350
Where's she? We'll soon serve the tables.

193
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:34,250
The woman's not here. It's suspicious.

194
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,420
I'd have to tell the queen about it.

195
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,930
The cook is playing with her guy.

196
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,710
What guy?

197
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,300
She says it's her relative,
but we have our opinion.

198
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,070
Every night she sneaks to the castle town.

199
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,530
Then she always brings
Lituanian delicacies.

200
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,880
But she always lets us try them.

201
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,150
Am I to go to Lithuania?

202
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,870
I'll show you my country at last.

203
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,170
You know my father was in slavery there.

204
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,910
- Are you afraid of me? - Not you, but...

205
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,420
Easy, you're safe with us.

206
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,860
Trust us.

207
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,490
What's on?

208
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,860
Cudka's afraid to go to Lithuania.

209
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,020
And you believe her?

210
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,740
She wants to stay here for Casimirus...

211
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,800
Women! You're blind.

212
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,550
Don't kill. Forgive me.

213
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,800
What happened?

214
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,590
The Hungarians disappeared!

215
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,970
How disappeared? Where did they go?

216
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,970
I don't know. We fell asleep.

217
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,450
Get out.

218
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,700
They didn't talk about anything important.

219
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,990
And their strange language...

220
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:04,990
So, we fell asleep.

221
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,460
Out!

222
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,460
Out of my sight!

223
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,110
And what now?

224
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,910
Now, everyone at the
castle may be your enemy.

225
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,990
Sire...

226
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,610
Is Anna ready for the feast?

227
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,560
I beg you, don't tell
us to go to Lithuania.

228
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,880
Let me stay here, I don't want to leave.

229
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,610
It's not going to be for long.

230
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,900
Are you in danger?

231
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,640
I'm not afraid of myself, but you all.

232
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,220
You shouldn't stay alone.

233
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,600
So many guests and so much work!

234
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,650
Where have you been?

235
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,710
Forgive me, sir!

236
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,000
I've got to tell you something.

237
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,930
Speak!

238
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,700
There was a pouch on the shelf.

239
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
With white powder.

240
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,360
And two dead rats next to it.

241
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,040
I went to throw them away.

242
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,210
When I was back, the pouch disappeared.

243
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:28,920
Don't look at me like this.

244
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,270
And what did you do?

245
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,770
I scrubbed the shelf clean

246
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,020
in case it was some rat poison,

247
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,460
so that nobody gets hurt.

248
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:38,910
I knew it! I knew you're
hiding something from me!

249
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,090
I didn't do anything!

250
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,580
Why didn't you tell me?

251
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,590
Would you believe me?

252
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,400
What was I to do? I
didn't know who to tell?

253
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,080
Guards!

254
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,080
None of your cooks would even notice

255
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,406
if something was added to the food.

256
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,680
You should have told me!

257
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,320
You should have told me you saw it!

258
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,220
Guards!

259
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,960
Are you going to scare me with guards?

260
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Why do you think I'm back?

261
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,960
Because I feel sorry for the kids.

262
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
I feel sorry for my lady... and you.

263
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,960
There is a poisoner at the castle.

264
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,310
Maybe even in our kitchen.

265
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,610
What will you get from putting me to jail?

266
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,600
What's going on?

267
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,360
There are strangers wandering
in the cloisters...

268
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,230
I'm innocent, I swear...

269
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,210
I'd like to believe you.

270
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,270
Give stronger beers.

271
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,960
Two at each entry. King's order.

272
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,070
Nobody goes home for the night.

273
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,430
My family's waiting for me.

274
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,520
They can wait!

275
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,830
This is service!

276
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,570
Don't drink from the king's table!

277
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,920
More!

278
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,260
You see, I'm not so scary...

279
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,260
To hell with you!

280
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,150
Did you find your father? Did
you tell him what to do?

281
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,720
I couldn't find him. I walked
around the whole castle.

282
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,920
Not good. You promised me.

283
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,190
And where's the coin I gave you?

284
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,280
You're not lying?

285
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
Did you go to the castle?

286
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,650
Not your fault. Keep it.

287
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,880
Thank you.

288
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,480
I'll have to wait for your husband, then.

289
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,760
He was to do something for me.

290
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,990
I need to be sure he didn't disappoint me.

291
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,330
Maybe you clean this place?!

292
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,960
I'll go get water.

293
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,370
You're not going anywhere.

294
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,680
You've come here to mourn Vladislav.

295
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,810
But also to welcome the new king.

296
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:58,170
We have bonds of blood and faith.

297
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,940
That's why I ask, let's pray...

298
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,720
for our unity and good fortune.

299
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:12,890
/praying in Latin/

300
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:16,540
So, who are we welcoming on the
throne, Casimirus or Bolko?

301
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Isn't there a better candidate?

302
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
No, there isn't.

303
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,070
Stop it! Enough!

304
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,060
I heard it. Aren't you ashamed?

305
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,870
The king's dead body is
still in his chamber

306
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,680
and you're already questioning his will.

307
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,600
Well, we want to talk about this will.

308
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,970
Bolko, I ask you for gtreater
respect for Casimirus.

309
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:52,220
Do you think one victorious
battle makes you a king?

310
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,850
Yes.

311
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,030
I defeated the Czechs.

312
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
I'm changing my duchy.

313
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,690
And Casimirus?

314
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,630
Is he changing anything except his bedroom?

315
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,630
Eat those words!

316
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,360
Eat those words or I'll kill you.

317
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,270
Kill him!

318
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,280
Stop it!

319
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Humiliation is a worse punishment.

320
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,720
Stop, please.

321
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,450
Kunedgunda, please, you should
apologize to your brother.

322
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,370
I'm not going to, mum.

323
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,960
You don't need to apologize me.

324
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,820
Enough of these whispers in the shadows.

325
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,920
Let's meet tomorrow and speak frankly.

326
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,200
If anybody questions my crown, be brave
to tell me that straight in the face.

327
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,260
Jasko, tomorrow you summon Spytek,
the chancellor and the archdeacon.

328
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,260
Everybody has to be present.

329
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,400
My beloved daughter-in-law is
leaving us, unfortunately.

330
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,210
She's leaving with prince Algirdas.

331
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,910
So, let's drink for their safe journey.

332
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:25,770
Lady, I'm grateful, but
I decided not to go.

333
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:31,520
Forgive me, Algirdas, but I
can't accept your invitation.

334
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,430
My place is here, with my husband.

335
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,430
The future king of Poland.

336
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,700
My husband will kill you
if he sees you here.

337
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,370
He probably prefers to make some profit.

338
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,800
Who are you and what do you want?

339
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,480
The same as him.

340
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,800
The death of the king and his family.
