1
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,050
What can you see, Egle?

2
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,050
Nothing good.

3
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,310
Illness.

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,080
No.

5
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Poison.

6
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,110
Poison, here at the Wawel castle?

7
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,110
Who do they want to poison?

8
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,340
Look, Egle, and say!

9
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,340
I can't see anything more.

10
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,200
But take care of yourself and the girls.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,540
This house isn't safe.

12
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,620
Maybe I should have left with my brother.

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,820
But then they won't put
the crown on your head.

14
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,140
I'm not fleeing anywhere.

15
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,140
People say she's a witch.

16
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,110
Really? Maybe I'll ask he
to cast a spell on you.

17
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,340
So that you want and love me.

18
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,340
Are you a wife that deserves love?

19
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,710
You bring your brother to defend you?

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,710
From whom? Me?

21
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,340
He's your ally, like the
whole of Lithuania.

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,450
You wrote to your brother in secret.

23
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,280
Hiding from me.

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,340
Is this how a loyal and
faithful wife behaves?

25
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,910
And you didn't tell me
of the king's illness.

26
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,710
Is this how a loyal and
faithful husband behaves?

27
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,250
And the lie that the king
went into a retreat...

28
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,250
Are you surprised I wanted to check this?

29
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,770
Sneaking out of the castle in disguise?

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,740
Am I your wife or prisoner?

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,020
No, only not the nutmeg.

32
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,600
This may remind the king of
the mutiny of bishop Muskata.

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,800
Bake bread with honey and spices.

34
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,480
We have to receive the family honourably.

35
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,110
My lady, maybe we ask the
bishop for dispensation?

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,310
So that the guests don't feel offended?

37
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,940
Are we to be embarrassed with
our piety, observance of Lent?

38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,340
Don't change anything

39
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,570
and, just in case, get rid
of this Lithuanian cook.

40
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,680
We need extraordinary caution.

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,020
No stranger is allowed in the kitchen.

42
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,400
This is fine, but without dressing.
And this too.

43
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,800
Maybe I could hire someone for help?

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,740
No, it's too dangerous.

45
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,820
So, maybe let the Lithuanian stay.

46
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,620
She's very devoted to her
lady, princess Anna.

47
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:29,820
And, last but not least, a Christian.

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,200
A Christian, you say?

49
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,420
If you vouch for her, then fine.

50
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:13,200
I heard you're looking for
a job in the Wawel Castle.

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,850
Where do you know it from?

52
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,050
Bring it to the castle.

53
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,740
What is it?

54
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,310
Spice.

55
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,770
Find someone else for errands.

56
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,220
I'm looking for a better job.

57
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,770
Do it well and I'll help
you get a better job.

58
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,770
You'll put it there and that's it.

59
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,510
Be fair, Anna.

60
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,620
I wasn't here because I was in Hungary
and then at war for a long time.

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,620
I'm constantly at war.

62
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,170
With your mother.

63
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,420
She talks about mercy and has sin
in her mind because she hates...

64
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,970
Mind your tongue!

65
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,970
I never neglected my duties as your wife.

66
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,740
And you, good lord, how many women
have you had since we married?

67
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,650
How often and how passionately
do you express you love to me?

68
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,370
Do you want war with me?

69
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,220
No, I only want you to treat me fairly.

70
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,540
The Czechs are preparing to capture Krakow.

71
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,280
The Teutonic knights are
standing at the border.

72
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,080
The Hunchback and Przemysl are
only waiting for my father to die

73
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,510
to remove me from power.

74
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,170
In such moment I can't have your
brother behind my back, I can't!

75
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,850
Do you know why he came here?

76
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
Because he worries about us.

77
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,510
About me, but also about you.

78
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,480
Cousin?

79
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,480
Laudatur lesus Christus.

80
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,820
Prince, you're alone, without retinue?

81
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Alone. We're rushing to uncle Vladislav.

82
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,250
Your visit is a great
honour to our monastery.

83
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,880
My people are staying in the Miechow Forest,
and they can enter the Wawel Castle any time.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
Every day we pray for king Vladislav

85
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,000
for peace in our land and for unity.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,540
Very well, we're just passing
on the way to Krakow.

87
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,910
But first, we need to pray for
the success of your plans.

88
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,510
You'll send Algirdas back.

89
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:55,650
But understand, we can count only on him.

90
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,650
He's not helping but only
putting you in danger.

91
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,650
Don't you understand
what our council means?

92
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,650
You're a thorn in my mother's side.

93
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,540
We were to pave Lithuania's way to Rome,
and how did it end?

94
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,540
Together, we're fighting
against a Christian order.

95
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,540
What kind of Christian order is that?

96
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,940
Plain murderers with
crosses on their capes.

97
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,480
But Christian...

98
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,940
The bishop is only waiting
for your false move.

99
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:18,510
He'll accuse you of
godlessness and paganism.

100
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,570
You wouldn't let it happen,
would you, my husband?

101
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,400
So, you would...

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,770
The Czech king is spreading such rumours.

103
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,540
He's got the title to the Polish crown

104
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,910
so he wants to get it at all cost.

105
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,940
The Czech one seems not enough.

106
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,940
There's danger lurking from any direction.

107
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,680
The future king isn't afraid, is he?

108
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,650
The future king isn't afraid of anyone.

109
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,650
But he's never blind to
what's going on around him.

110
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,650
Dear Anna.

111
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Hey, where are you bringing it?

112
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
To the Wawel Castle's kitchen.

113
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,940
I'll help you.

114
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,050
I won't pay homage to Casimirus.

115
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:30,340
Our duchies could connect Greater
Poland with Lesser Poland

116
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,820
On condition the crown
is yours and not his.

117
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,400
This would be best for you and for me.

118
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,510
I don't know, Przemyslav,

119
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,020
our families have always
been loyal to Vladislav.

120
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,020
Times have changed.

121
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,570
What are we to do?

122
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,940
Kuyavia is lost.

123
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,940
Teutonic knights set the terms.

124
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,940
Maybe there was no other way.

125
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:52,280
If only the king had wanted,
there would be a way.

126
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,140
We can't allow Casimirus's coronation.

127
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,680
The mass is just starting.

128
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
We're hurrying to Krakow.

129
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,280
Can there be anything more urgent

130
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
than a prayer to our lord?

131
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,080
So similar, almost like the king...

132
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Who's this?

133
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,620
King's oldest grandson.

134
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,770
Bolko Swidnicki. He stopped
Jan of Bohemia's army.

135
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,620
Why is he here?

136
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Have the Czechs invaded again?

137
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Maybe the king opened his eyes

138
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,020
and understood his son is not
suitable to be his heir.

139
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:58,110
Because he can't fight but
only slay, like in Koscian.

140
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,850
Quickly, quickly!

141
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,710
- Where to put it?
- Here!

142
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,970
Yes, according to the deal.

143
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,740
And what are you doing here?

144
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,140
Somebody said you need help in the kitchen.

145
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
We don't need anybody. Get out!

146
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,310
Mum!

147
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,400
At last!

148
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,880
It's good you summonned me. How is Father?

149
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,540
A bit better. He wanted
to see you all together.

150
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,110
- Take a rest.
- Thanks God, he's alive!

151
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,570
Bolko, my son, has come with me.

152
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,050
To celebrate his victory over the Czechs,

153
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,740
I ordered new pearls for Holy Mother.

154
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,280
- Here you are.
- I'm so proud of my son.

155
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,280
Does Father know the Czechs
want to take his crown.

156
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,280
They're writing letters all the time.

157
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,130
They say Poland doesn't exist anymore.

158
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,130
And that Father is the king of Krakow only.

159
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,130
But these are only words...

160
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,860
They say everywhere it's true...

161
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,700
You'll tak about it with Father

162
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,230
and consult Casimirus what to do next.

163
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,230
Yes...

164
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,760
Does anything bother you?

165
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,330
Do you want to tell me something?

166
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,230
I'm your mother, don't hide anything!

167
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,100
Mother...

168
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,900
Bolko has already some experience.

169
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,330
He's clever, brave, mature...

170
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,330
That's why we admire him...

171
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:57,800
And there are different
opinions about Casimirus.

172
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Kunegunda, listen...

173
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,230
I'm very proud of my grandson and your son,

174
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,960
I believe when Casimirus
sits on the throne,

175
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
he can rely on him.

176
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,060
If you gave your son some
hopes for the crown,

177
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,230
talk to him before he meets Casimirus.

178
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,560
You know your brother's temper...

179
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,060
And take this too, quickly.

180
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,760
Good day, Bolko!

181
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,860
Good day, I see Krakow is
growing with every day.

182
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,760
I'd like this city to be the capital
of all our duchies one day.

183
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,360
The capital of Poland.

184
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Yes, if only the Czechs
wouldn't take it from us.

185
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,900
You defeated Jan once, so I believe

186
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,100
you'll do it again if necessary.

187
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,060
I'm proud of you, Bolko.

188
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,400
We'll meet at the king's chamber.

189
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,000
You must leave.

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Your presence is not helping me.

191
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:17,060
Algirdas, they're accusing
me of still being a pagan.

192
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,300
I'll kill your Casimirus like a dog!

193
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,060
The news of his antics in
Visegrad reached even Lithuania.

194
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,600
He raped a maidservant of queen Elizabeth.

195
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,230
And then they had her family
killed to the third generation.

196
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,360
And he has the nerve to
accuse you of anything.

197
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,900
It's not him.

198
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,560
He only complains I didn't give him a son.

199
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,960
Everybody gossips little
Kunegunda isn't his

200
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,630
because he was sick after
little Elizabeth's birth.

201
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,060
And you're tolerating this...

202
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,860
You let yourself be humiliated...

203
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,860
Accused...

204
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,630
Don't you have dignity?

205
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,960
Aldona...

206
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,730
Do you want this crown so much?

207
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,200
I'd take you even today.

208
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,230
To the Neman River. You'd
be free, think about it?

209
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,500
You'll come back to your people.

210
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Here, they forbid you to dance, have fun...

211
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,260
This is not a castle for you.

212
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,930
This life is not for you.

213
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,660
This is my husband and
these are my children.

214
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,260
And this is my land now.

215
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,130
You have to help Casimirus.

216
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,400
Everybody will be against him.

217
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,400
That's why he needs to seek allies.

218
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,030
Has everybody come?

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,230
Are there my daughters?

220
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,830
Nephews?

221
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Vladislav of Leczyca and Przemysl
of Sieradz haven't arrived yet.

222
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,130
Also, we've got no news from Elizabeth.

223
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,260
Our envoy to Hungary hasn't returned yet.

224
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,760
I wanted to say good bye.

225
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,760
Dominus vobiscum.

226
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Et cum spirit tuo.

227
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,960
What have you got?

228
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,130
A letter to the king.

229
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,400
To the king?

230
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,300
In person.

231
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,060
It's not the good time
to send anybody there.

232
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,430
It's got the Hungarian queen's seal.

233
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,260
I'll take you to the queen.

234
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,530
I was told to give it
to the king in person.

235
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,130
The lady will decide if
you can see the king.

236
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,400
No one can enter.

237
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,060
The king's council is in session.

238
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,630
Castellan of Krakow will summon you, lady.

239
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,260
It's the king's order.

240
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,760
Maybe they're deciding
you won't be the king.

241
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,630
So this is what you want?

242
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,330
Kunegunda, your brother will be the king.

243
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,930
If they start the war
with the Teutonic knights

244
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,330
he won't be the king because
Poland will cease to exist.

245
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,560
Give way, I advise you.

246
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,430
I don't feel good that I leave you here.

247
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,700
I'll take care. Don't worry.

248
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,860
Give my greetings to everyone.

249
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,060
Everyone?

250
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,930
You'll give him a son, and
they won't touch you.

251
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,660
Stay well, sister.

252
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,360
You'll help him.

253
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,030
You'll help Casimirus.

254
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,660
Help him become great.

255
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,660
My lord,

256
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,760
you can count on me.

257
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,100
Father!

258
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,900
King!

259
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,900
Vladislav!

260
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,600
Father!

261
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,530
Look who's come to you!

262
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,200
Your beloved daughter.

263
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,960
And your grandson.

264
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,260
Vladislav?

265
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,660
King?

266
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,060
So, it's begun...

267
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,760
I've been looking for you.

268
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,030
Where have you been, my lady?

269
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,200
What's happened?

270
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,530
And why are the bells tolling so wildly?

271
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,700
King Vladislav died.

272
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,330
A Lithuanian will be the queen of Poland.

273
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,230
So that he won't pick
somebody from the living.

274
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,900
Husband, I'll summon our daughters.

275
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,500
Knight! I have to speak to the king!

276
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,200
Help me, I have a letter to the king!

277
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,700
It's a pity, my lady, you
don't have a son to lean on.

278
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,230
I have daughters, who love their father.

279
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,730
Don't you think, my lady, it's God's gift?

280
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:46,460
Where are the royal stables?

281
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
There, my lord.

282
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,460
My lady, a Clarisse nun
is waiting with a letter

283
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,200
from your sister Elizabeth,
the queen of Hungary.

284
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,830
Ask her in.

285
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,000
Forgive me, lady, it can't wait.

286
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,730
The king has to read it
as soon as possible.

287
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,230
Give me the letter.

288
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,860
I was clearly instructed -

289
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,200
only to the king's hands.

290
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,760
Here they are.

291
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,630
Where is the chamberlain?

292
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,630
He was to take the girls.

293
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,030
I'm Kunegunda, and you?

294
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,030
Kunegunda!

295
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,330
Mom, they're so alike!

296
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,430
What does it mean?

297
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,030
Who is it?
