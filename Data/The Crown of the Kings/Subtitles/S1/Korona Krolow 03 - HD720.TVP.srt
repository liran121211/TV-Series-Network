1
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,000
Who's out there?

2
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,740
I'm here to speak to princess Aldona.

3
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,200
That is, Anna...

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,360
Casimirus's wife...

5
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,180
Prince Casimirus's?

6
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,920
Yes, the prince's...

7
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,900
You should rest, my lady...

8
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,080
I'll be watching....

9
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,900
I'll stay, father...

10
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,780
I believe the king can feel my presence.

11
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,820
My lady, you decide whether to wake princess Anna

12
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,020
I'd rather not be responsible for this.

13
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,300
And Poles are said to be so brave...

14
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,220
Yes, my lady...

15
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,980
Have you copied it?

16
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,700
Read the gospel...

17
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,680
to our son.

18
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,730
Take it easy. We'll pray for him.

19
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,480
Prayer is good

20
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,360
But allies, even better

21
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,520
They're on the way. The letters have been sent.

22
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,060
If I gave him a duchy...

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,640
He could rule peacefully....

24
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,300
and have a peaceful life.

25
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,940
But you've always wanted Casimirus to become the king.

26
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,040
Yes...

27
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,000
But the Polish crown...

28
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,960
is so heavy...

29
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,600
If not him, then who?

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,260
Crown is not a choice, it's a vocation, the heritage of blood...

31
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,940
He's got allies... sister, the queen of Hungary.

32
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,380
and Lithuanians, Anna's family...

33
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,040
It's a great force...

34
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,180
Few would dare challenge him...

35
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:37,220
But, Vladislav of Leczyca and Przemysl of Sieradz...

36
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,640
This is your family, your relatives...

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,620
I'm their direct paternal uncle...

38
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,140
but they've never accepted that

39
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,020
I became the king.

40
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,020
and, moreover

41
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,280
Casimirus is younger than them.

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,880
And the Czechs?

43
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,020
The Czechs? Jan is ready to ally with

44
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,220
the Brandenburg, the Teutonic Knights...

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,120
and then, he'll be on his own...

46
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,860
Who'll be with him?

47
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,140
I...

48
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,480
I'll be with him as I've always been with you...

49
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,700
Vladislav?

50
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,780
<i>/murmuring/</i>

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,460
Father?

52
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,440
He may be gone before night...

53
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,800
Speak! What did my brother say?

54
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,500
Relax. He's on the way.

55
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,500
I knew he'll come.

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
He should be here around tomorrow noon.

57
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,400
He sent me forward to let you know,

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,540
He'll be waiting in the Miechow Forest.

59
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,140
But how will I get there?

60
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,720
It's Lent. You can't ride a horse...

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,900
Do even horses fast in Poland?

62
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,640
Strange customs...

63
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,460
That's the way it is, so don't count on a rich breakfast...

64
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,720
Egle, give me some advice...

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,420
We'll come up with something tomorrow...

66
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,980
Algirdas is near, that's what counts.

67
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,320
Still, you'll have to explain his presence to your husband.

68
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,040
Prince Algirdas told me to say he sent me here to cheer you up.

69
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,980
And so that your daughters learn how to play the tarkas.

70
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,380
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Prince?

71
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> - It's early.
- We're moving out.

72
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,680
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> - Vladislav of Leczyca sleeps upstairs.
- The Hunchback?

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I want to avoid him.

74
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> This is the king's nephew.

75
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,540
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> He hates the Teutonic knights.

76
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Our ally.

77
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,260
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Ally?

78
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,120
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> So, why is she sneaking to Krakow?

79
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,820
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> He's got his right to the crown.

80
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> And this is why we have to be at the Wawel Castle first.

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,640
I need boiling water.

82
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,420
Make a fire, woman.

83
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,000
Again, only bread and beer?

84
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,240
It's Lent. You forgot?...

85
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,920
Is it the king's breakfast?

86
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,260
Jesus was fasting for 40 days.

87
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,560
In the desert.

88
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,380
How can the king be healthy if all he eats is unhealthy.

89
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,520
Salvation of the soul. That's what matters.

90
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,220
- Right, Christian?
 - We add some cheese.

91
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,860
Put it back. Today's Friday.

92
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,280
I said, only bread and beer!

93
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,940
So, at least, let my lady have a piece of cheese...

94
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,500
Is she pregnant?

95
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,360
No.

96
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,820
In this case she should fast. Like everyone.

97
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,540
How can she be pregnant if she's always fasting?

98
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,640
Vytautas?

99
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,180
This is Vytautas, my countryman. He brings goods from Lithuania.

100
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,360
Good day, my lord. I have the best goods. A royal feast, straight from Lithuania.

101
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Show the goods to the lord!

102
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,800
Are we waiting for his highness?

103
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,380
Is he ill?

104
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,520
Owing to your prayers, he's in perfect health.

105
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,220
Where's your wife?

106
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,440
It's Lent. We don't sleep together, so I don't know where she is.

107
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,900
She should have heard the bells, though.

108
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,480
Lady, they're going to look for you.

109
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,320
Bishop Grot himself will hold the morning mass.

110
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,580
Bishop Grot? I can't miss the mass then.

111
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,580
Egle, you'll be serving the new princess Anna.

112
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,180
- My lady...
- Take off the cape. Quickly!

113
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,180
You'll be pretending our lady, you fool!

114
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,280
I'm going with you.

115
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,480
I'll take care myself, without a minstrel.

116
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,560
I was to watch you. You won't go without me.

117
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,760
And who's that?

118
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,860
An artist, my lady.

119
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,660
What if we're caught?

120
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,780
Nobody's going to know.

121
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,900
The queen will recognize me and give to the executioner.

122
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,020
You'll sit at the back.

123
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,840
You'll have a coat, pray and keep your head down,

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,120
and the veil will do the rest.

125
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,760
You only need to walk like a real queen,

126
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,960
and not sneak like a maidservant.

127
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,600
Enough talking, let's go.

128
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:46,980
My lady...

129
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
I'll do as you ordered, my lady.

130
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,360
Saddle the horse!

131
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,680
I'm going with the chatelaine to help the poor.

132
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:06,080
<i>/praying in Latin/</i>

133
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:11,220
<i>/praying in Latin/</i>

134
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:20,620
<i>/praying in Latin/</i>

135
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,060
Mom?

136
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:35,600
<i>/praying in Latin/</i>

137
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,940
My lady, you can't leave the town.

138
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,620
Who said so?

139
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,620
It's dangerous. The guards will stop you.

140
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,480
Oh bright lady!

141
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,700
Help!

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,780
It's a conman!

143
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,960
Catch him!

144
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,800
Halt!

145
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
Follow me!

146
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,680
Stop!

147
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,000
Wife, come with me!

148
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,480
What does it mean?

149
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,120
Where is she? Speak immediately!

150
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,280
- I can't
- Speak before I get angry!

151
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,620
I swore to my lady.

152
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,180
Aren't you ashamed of your lies? Do you know it's a sin?

153
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,000
My wife's committing adultery and you keep quiet?

154
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,320
It's not adultery, I swear, she's loyal to you.

155
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
So, who is she meeting in secret?

156
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,460
Her brother.

157
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,260
Where?

158
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,440
Where? Speak!

159
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,240
The Miechow Forest. That's all I know, I swear.

160
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,640
What's going on?

161
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,280
You're going with me!

162
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:25,180
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Good day, my queen!

163
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,180
I'm not a queen.

164
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,140
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> You'll be one soon, my darling.

165
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,160
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I wasn't sure it's you. You look stronger.

166
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,140
What does it mean, my lady?

167
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,260
Who's that man?

168
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,920
That's my brother, Algirdas, don't you recognize?

169
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,000
Put back your swords, as his hand is faster than his tongue.

170
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,280
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Should I kill them?

171
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:11,260
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Algirdas. This is my husband, Casimirus, and his knight, Jasko of Melszyn.

172
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,760
Were you running away to your brother?

173
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,140
I wasn't running away, but going out to greet him.

174
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,720
Galloping...

175
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,680
I'd expect anyone but you, my husband...

176
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,860
You neglect your wife....

177
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,460
Did she complain?

178
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
She didn't have to...

179
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,460
Everyone can see it...

180
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,520
Stop it. For my sister it may be somebody important.

181
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,880
You betrayed our lady.

182
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,960
If Casimirus catches them, he'll kill her. It'll be your fault.

183
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,520
They'll expel you from the court. Didn't you like it here?

184
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,820
I can't lie! It's a sin.

185
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,120
I have to speak with the prince urgently.

186
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,840
He went somewhere with Jasko. Don't you know?

187
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,280
I thought you're his most trusted man.

188
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,960
If I were him, I wouldn't trust anybody more than you.

189
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,540
I went to Sieradz and Leczyca.

190
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,660
Did you talk to Valdislav and Przemyslav?

191
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,620
Yes

192
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,520
Both are very concerned about your illness, my lord.

193
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,240
Maybe a bit too much.

194
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,060
As if they had made an agreement.

195
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,220
There are many troops on the roads.

196
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,220
And Teutonic knights?

197
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,220
They respect the peace and observe the truce.

198
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,220
Probably tired of winter.

199
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,900
But the prince of Leczyca is gathering knights.

200
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,120
He wants to attack the Order

201
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,740
to break the truce.

202
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,280
You should rest, my lord.

203
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,360
There's no time left. Give me the chest.

204
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,920
Knight!

205
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,280
Niemierza of Golcza

206
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,820
You've served my faithfully.

207
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,520
Take this ring.

208
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,420
Don't make him tired. Go now!

209
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,500
It's an honour

210
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,980
to serve the king.

211
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,540
I don't need rewards.

212
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,860
Take it, boy.

213
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,400
Go now, go!

214
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,660
Algirdas, the Lithuanian prince, princess Anna's brother, has come to Krakow.

215
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,260
Without our invitation...

216
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,260
Where's Anna?

217
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,260
Did she know of his coming?

218
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,600
She even went out to greet him.

219
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,460
Without our permission...

220
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,460
Did she take my carriage?

221
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,180
Horseback.

222
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,340
A savage.

223
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,480
So many years with us...

224
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,480
and still a pagan.

225
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,000
What are your orders, my lady?

226
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,560
Is your father in town or at the castle?

227
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,740
He's awaiting a call. He's been trying to see the king.

228
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,180
Send out for him.

229
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,040
I'll go myself.

230
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,180
No, you can't. You have to be at the castle when Algirdas is here.

231
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,060
I want to know what he and Anna are scheming.

232
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,100
Put these on this side.

233
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,100
At the beginning.

234
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,840
Bring it back to the storage.

235
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,260
It's Lent!

236
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,820
The Lithuanian prince arrived. The princess's brother. He doesn't fast.

237
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,420
This is why we serve fish, groats dumplings and vegetable stew.

238
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,240
Lent, but the royal way.

239
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,240
It's impolite to make the guest starve.

240
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,700
It's impolite to ignore the host's customs.

241
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,720
Here's miss Pelka...

242
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,500
She'll explain it to you...

243
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
what and how it should be.

244
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,080
You should return to Lithuania with your people.

245
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,080
Mother, you're speaking of my wife.

246
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,940
But this wife of yours is scheming against us with her brother.

247
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,600
I should send you back.

248
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,440
Lady, you have no right. I didn't betray my husband even in my thoughts.

249
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,940
How do you behave?

250
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,740
You ride a horse, go alone outside the castle.

251
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
- You don't pray
- Mother!

252
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,700
You need to deserve to wear the queen's crown.

253
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,320
Send for Spytek...

254
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,700
and the archdeacon of Jaroslav

255
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,080
I want to talk to them...

256
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,000
My lady, let me still be your knight...

257
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,060
Never!

258
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,500
You brought me so much embarrassment!

259
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,500
Look!

260
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,500
I can't talk!

261
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,300
But I can show how the king rewarded me. I had to leave because of his orders.

262
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,840
I'm not worthy of you.

263
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,600
I betrayed my lady.

264
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,040
What are you talking about, Cudka?

265
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,000
If only I could get my father's advice...

266
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,280
- He's left!
- He's gone on a secret mission!

267
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,620
Where?

268
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,960
I can't say, but he'll return.

269
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,960
You can be certain.

270
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,980
We need to talk.

271
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,300
Don't be afraid!

272
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,360
We're not angry with you, are we, my wife?

273
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,220
I want to look like a king.

274
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,700
Maybe it's too early to rise from your bed?

275
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Rather too late.

276
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,520
Tell them to bring the broth.

277
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
And something fat.

278
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,960
But it's Lent.

279
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,520
This Lithuanian cook must have something in her stock.

280
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,360
Lent is needed for salvation of the soul, but that's not all.

281
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,400
I don't trust anybody. What if they poison you?

282
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Who are you afraid of?

283
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,480
Everybody.

284
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,480
I'm not going anywhere.

285
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,040
So, why did you summon me?

286
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
You want help? Go to Lithuania with me.

287
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,820
No, Algirdas.

288
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,760
You have to go. The queen suspects you and I are scheming.

289
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,300
The old woman can't do anything.

290
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,440
She can.

291
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,300
She can have my marriage invalidated. I didn't think of it.

292
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,800
Your Casimirus is chasing after maidservants all the time.

293
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,140
Stop it.

294
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,600
He's my husband and the future king.

295
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,240
The old hag won't let you become the queen.

296
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,680
I'll take care of her.

297
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,420
Aldona

298
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,420
Prince Vladislav of Leczyca is near Krakow.

299
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,720
Prince of Sieradz will be here soon.

300
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:44,740
Jan of Bohemia will follow them.

301
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,360
Hungary.

302
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,000
They'll reach an agreement and there will be war.

303
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,760
They'll won't defeat Casimirus.

304
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,680
So, the cousins are there for a surprise.

305
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,440
When I tell them my will straight in their faces.

306
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,960
Casimirus must be the king.

307
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,820
They won't deprive him of the throne.

308
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,960
Do you believe in him so much?

309
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,940
I'm telling you he'll lose the crown.

310
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,220
The it will be too late to run. Come with me today.

311
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,220
No.

312
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,600
You go.

313
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,140
Go and tell that the old king is dying.

314
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,360
I have to stay here.

315
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,000
You summoned me and you're throwing me away.

316
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,600
Not throwing but asking.

317
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,840
I saw what you're wearing on your neck.

318
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,060
You haven't forgotten Lithuania...

319
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,120
and him...

320
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,160
Go now.

321
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,560
You may die here with Casimirus

322
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,480
They won't spare the girls either.

323
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,220
Here, either war or death is awaiting you...

324
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,740
...or the crown of the queen of Poland.
