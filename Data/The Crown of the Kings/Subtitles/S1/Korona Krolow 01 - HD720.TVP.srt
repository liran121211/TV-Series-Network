1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,300
This is the year 1325.

2
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,300
It's been 5 years since the coronation of Vladislav I the Elbow-high.

3
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,300
The Polish lands have been reunited under his rule, but the war with the Teutonic Order is still going on.

4
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,300
Silesia and Masovia (Warsaw) are outside Polish borders. 

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,300
Allies are needed.

6
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:00,300
For a few years, Elizabeth, the daughter of the Elbow-high and Jadwiga, is the wife of Charles I of Hungary, of the Capetian House of Anjou.

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:07,300
Time has come for the marriage of the only living son of the ruling couple to bear a fruitful alliance...

8
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:36,770
<i>/praying in Latin/</i>

9
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,770
Oh, Lord...

10
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,770
Bless our Polish kingdom...

11
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,770
Save the king and his subjects from evil...

12
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,770
Amen.

13
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,340
- A strange man...
 - I can see...

14
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:05,420
- This one? Wants to speak with the king only?
 - Yes.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,660
Who are you?

16
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,740
Pelka... of Sieciechow...

17
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,740
I'm coming from Lithuania...

18
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,740
I escaped...

19
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,740
from slavery...

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,820
Water! Quickly, give him water!

21
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,150
The knight, Pelka of Sieciechow wants to speak to the king.

22
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,150
Pelka? But he's in Lithuanian slavery...

23
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,550
He fled. He's barely alive. He wants to speak with the king.

24
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,550
Bring him here!

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,420
My lord, save us!

26
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,420
Do something for those in Gediminas' slavery...

27
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,420
There are so many of us left there...

28
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,420
And nobody will ever mention us...

29
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,420
Winters are heavy...

30
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,420
People die of the cold...

31
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,420
The guards use us as living targets, just for fun.

32
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,420
Shooting at the naked ones with bows.

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,000
Their families are too poor to collect the ransom...

34
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,420
But the poor are your subjects too!

35
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,000
There are more and more of them being enslaved...

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,420
The border is weak...

37
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
Not enough troops...

38
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,420
People live in constant fear...

39
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
Let him eat first!

40
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,420
War with Lithuania is out of question.

41
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,820
The Czech king is only waiting for it and he'll move in from the south and he may attack Krakow.

42
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,820
Silesia is already under his control.

43
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:44,000
Destroying a pagan capital would appeal to the Pope.

44
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,100
Remember about the Teutonic knights, my king.

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,100
We attack Lithuania, and they attack us.

46
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
Lords, don't leave people without help!

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,800
My king, if you want to retain the crown, you have to maintain peace.

48
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,800
Freedom of my subjects is more important than the crown.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,060
This is my father's horse.

50
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,260
- Are you giving it to this man?
I'm following a king's order.

51
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,460
Has my father given Grom to you?

52
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,460
Then you must have done something great.

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,460
- So long, my lord!
- Don't you want to rest before your journey?

54
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,660
If you haven't seen home for so long, there's no time to waste.

55
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,660
May God be with you!

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,140
A strange man..

57
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,140
Dressed like a peasant, but he mounts a horse like a knight.

58
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:52,140
That's Pelka. There are not many knights like him anymore. Nothing for himself.

59
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Come on!

60
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,560
Now, think only of the victory, king!

61
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,560
There's only one king in Poland, King Vladislav!

62
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,780
But, one day, you'll be the king.

63
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,780
The crown is heavy, and you need to be watchful lest nobody should topple it.

64
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,980
So?

65
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Lithuanians.

66
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,020
They came at night. The glow was such as if the whole forest was on fire...

67
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
And the lady?

68
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,020
Misfortune, my lord.

69
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,020
The lady and the young lords were defending for long

70
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,020
They killed many bastards.

71
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,520
But they got so angry because of their comrades' death

72
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,520
that they were tortured.

73
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,000
Did nobody survive?

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Only the young lady.

75
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She hid, but they found her the following day.

76
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where is she?

77
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,600
The miller's daughter took her to the monastery.

78
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,060
Nobody's managed to baptize Lithuania.

79
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,460
The land is still waiting for the light of Christ.

80
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,460
But such an alliance will give the Teutonic knights the reason for war.

81
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,460
But we'll get a strong all.

82
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,860
Gediminas won't join is in the war with the Teutonic knights.

83
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,560
But he'll release my subjects from slavery.

84
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,560
You heard what Pelka said.

85
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,660
But, isn't there another way? Do we have to ally with pagans?

86
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:31,360
My queen, in order to acquire these pagans as an ally desperately needed in this situation

87
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,360
and to create new opportunities to convert them to true faith

88
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
such an alliance is worth making.

89
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
It will only strengthen the Polish crown.

90
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,260
Is that true, Father?

91
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,260
Am I to marry a pagan?

92
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
I prefer to go to war.

93
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
You'll have your chance to fight.

94
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Mother, have you agreed to this?

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

96
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,800
For the benefit of the subjects and the peace of the kingdom.

97
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,400
You'll marry the daughter of Gediminas, the prince of Lithuania

98
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,400
It has already been decided.

99
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,600
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> You'll be mine.

100
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,960
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> For ever.

101
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,830
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> And only yours.

102
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Your Highness!

103
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Princess

104
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:01,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Your father's calling you. I know you're here.

105
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,740
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Are you following me?

106
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,740
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> We're looking for you.

107
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,740
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> So you tell him you haven't found me.

108
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Don't you know your father?

109
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> He'll fly into a rage.

110
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Let's go.

111
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,920
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Marry a Pole? I'll never do that!

112
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,920
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Watch your tongue! You're speaking to the High Prince!

113
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I'm speaking to my father.

114
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,620
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> And why don't you want him?

115
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,620
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> He's not old.

116
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,620
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> He's a Christian, a stranger.

117
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,620
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> This is why you'll marry him.

118
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,340
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> The pope doesn't respect me.

119
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,340
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> The Teutonic knights murder our people.

120
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,000
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> You'll become the Polish queen, and, at last, they'll start to respect us.

121
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> They're afraid of you.

122
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Isn't it enough for you?

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Not enough.

124
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,400
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> His mother comes from a pious family.

125
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,100
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> And she'll never agree to a marriage with a...

126
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Pagan!

127
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,100
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> That's what they call us, isn't it?

128
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> They'll baptize you.

129
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Help me, brother!

130
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,620
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> What have you promised them?

131
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,620
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> What have you sold me for?

132
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:33,420
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I'll release the Polish prisoners.

133
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> What will you gain from this?

134
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I?

135
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,900
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> There's a lot to say.

136
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I'll be a laughingstock in the east.

137
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Laughingstock among my noblemen.

138
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,730
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> But you...

139
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,220
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> You'll be the queen of Poland.

140
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,940
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> She's in love with another one, Father.

141
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,460
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Tough luck.

142
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
They're coming.

143
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,420
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Have you come for my sister?

144
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:44,420
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> We welcome the fiancee of the son of Vladislav, the king of Poland.

145
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:19,050
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Here she is.

146
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,320
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Your horses are poor. Weren't there any better in the Wawel Castle stables?

147
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,300
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> If you ever needed my help

148
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> don't hesitate to call me.

149
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,780
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I don't want to marry him.

150
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,780
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I know.

151
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,620
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Stay well, my sister.

152
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,620
We have to go.

153
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
It's a long way ahead of us.

154
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,280
And who's that?

155
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,020
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Don't you know?

156
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,020
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> A Lithuanian witch.

157
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,380
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Do you remember when you said I was a witch?

158
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,380
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Aren't you afraid they'll send me back to Vilnius?

159
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,380
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> I'm allowed to joke like this. I'm the future queen.

160
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,380
<i>/Lithuanian/</i> Have you seen your fiancee at last?

161
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,380
Your highness...

162
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,380
Jadwiga, the queen of Poland.

163
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,300
This crucifix is your baptism gift.

164
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
Leave us alone.

165
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Leave!

166
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,030
Aldona

167
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,000
From today, never oppose me.

168
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,860
This is my castle.

169
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,860
My kingdom.

170
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,000
In Poland, the king is the ruler, not the queen.

171
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
One does not interrupt the queen.

172
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
I buried two sons.

173
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,200
I have only Casimirus left.

174
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,990
The future king.

175
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,990
You will have to obey him unconditionally.

176
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Did you understand?

177
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,060
What do you ask the holy church for?

178
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Baptism.

179
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Asking for baptism for a God's child

180
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
Aldona, daughter of Gediminas

181
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,380
you're accepting the duty

182
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,380
to bring her up in faith

183
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,920
so that, following God's commandments

184
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,260
she loves God and neighbour

185
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,260
as we were taught by Jesus Christ.

186
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,900
Are you aware of this duty?

187
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,900
We are aware.

188
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,900
Aldona,

189
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,060
do you renounce sin

190
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,060
in order to live in the freedom of the child of God

191
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Do you...

192
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,500
believe in God the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth

193
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,780
Do you believe?

194
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,870
I believe...

195
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,420
What name have chosen for baptism?

196
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
Anna

197
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,340
Anna...

198
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,170
I baptize you

199
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:00,000
<i>/praying in Latin/</i>

200
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Szczerbiec <i>(the Polish coronation sword)</i>

201
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,100
The sword of the Polish kings. I saw it at your coronation.

202
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,100
Soon it will be yours.

203
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,100
Father, your reign will be long.

204
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:33,100
And do you want to take the throne?

205
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,820
I will obey you.

206
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,340
I'm asking if...

207
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,340
you want to be the king?

208
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,340
Do you want to rule the country

209
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,340
which is surrounded by peril?

210
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:54,340
Which was only reunited and immediately everybody's at one another's throat?

211
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,340
Ready to devour one another?

212
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,340
Do you want?

213
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Because it's not easy at all.

214
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,340
I know, I'm learning from you how to rule.

215
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,560
You want to learn?

216
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,260
Remember, you never know who's your enemy.

217
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,260
On the throne, you've got only one ally...

218
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,260
Yourself.

219
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,860
Do you remember what I taught you?

220
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:32,860
Who's name is God's name, will not be threatened by any danger.

221
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:35,100
And here...

222
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,200
This sign strengthens the love of kings and princes and the wrath of judges...

223
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,200
Remember, your wife will become a Christian

224
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,200
if she sees you've got an ability for wrath and for love.

225
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,580
Tell everybody at home, you won't be back soon

226
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,030
All of us have got a lot of work at the King's son's wedding.

227
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,320
Princess Anna's cook has arrived.

228
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
It's my kitchen.

229
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,620
The queen's order. The woman's staying.

230
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,520
- You understand Polish?
- Better than you Lithuanian.

231
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
A pagan or Christian?

232
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,300
And what milk do cows give?

233
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Pagan or Christian?

234
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,540
God, have mercy, only men.

235
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,340
You save thousands of people.

236
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,340
Why didn't you want anything from my father?

237
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,670
You'd rebuild your house, get land.

238
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,670
I'm a knight, not a landowner.

239
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,670
If the knights aren't landowners, there's always war.

240
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,700
Am I to build a house...

241
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,200
And wait in fear for another raid?

242
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,180
I'd rather go to war and serve the king.

243
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,180
Your daughter...

244
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,180
could be my wife's lady-in-waiting.

245
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,700
My lord, she's still a child.

246
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,500
Both are new here.

247
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,180
They may like each other.

248
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
She'll have everything here.

249
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Think it over.

250
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,940
Did she tell you she doesn't believe in Jesus?

251
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,620
Whatever she said, I don't believe her.

252
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
She received baptism.

253
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
She's changed her name, but she hasn't changed her heart.

254
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
and that's why I'm worrying about our son.

255
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:53,950
Our son

256
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,950
is to be the king.

257
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,350
So, first, he has to learn to control his wife

258
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,350
and then Poland.

259
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,350
But he's so young...

260
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,350
He's already a man.

261
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,000
But she doesn't want him.

262
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,500
So he has to 

263
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
conquer her.

264
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,540
<i>/singing in Latin/</i>

265
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:19,740
Give your right hands to each other.

266
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,980
I, Casimirus,

267
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:31,980
the son of Vladislav, the king of Poland

268
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,700
take you, Anna, as wife

269
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,020
and pledge you love,

270
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,380
marital fidelity

271
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,140
to have and to hold

272
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,780
So help me God.
