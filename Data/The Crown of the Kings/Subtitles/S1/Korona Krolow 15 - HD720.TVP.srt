1
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,150
This is your dowry.

2
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,270
A bit far from Krakow.

3
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:47,550
Why do you need Krakow?

4
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,960
You'll be a wife, a mother...

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,160
You'll have a lot to do.

6
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,920
You'll build a house...

7
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,370
bring up my grandchildren.

8
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,480
Father, when you started the family,

9
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,240
how did you know what you felt was love?

10
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,010
Love will always prevail.

11
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,019
Like grass. An army can march over it,

12
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,710
fire, water... It will always recover.

13
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,070
But it's got to be true.

14
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,530
- And from here... - I love Niemierza.

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,580
Love is about standing by
somebody, whatever happens.

16
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,839
I'd like to live here with Yolanta.

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,440
I want you to bring my
grandchildren on my land.

18
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,319
I saw the way you look at Casimirus.

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,740
Do you want to follow the
little girl's mother's fate?

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,320
Be careful, daughter.

21
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,490
I won't do anything that
may make you ashamed.

22
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,840
I know.

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,750
But be careful.

24
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,350
It's great joy to be at
your coronation, Casimirus.

25
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,449
Krakow impressed us a lot.

26
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,620
Vilnius is like a younger brother.

27
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,340
Maybe it will catch up with the older soon?

28
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,720
Arunas, you must admit
the castle's impressive.

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,519
It's easier to get lost here
than in a Lithuanian forest.

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,180
I don't get lost in a forest.

31
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,680
Your castle, sire, is a bit intimidating...

32
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,969
Kestutis?

33
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,769
You didn't say your brother's so handsome.

34
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,099
When I last saw him he was
shorter and slimmer than me.

35
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,100
I was missing you too.

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,509
There was nobody to challenge
when practicing the bow.

37
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,279
There's no better archer in Lithuania.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,450
Maybe, except Arunas. Do you remember him?

39
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,600
Give it to me, I'll hang it.

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,850
I'll bring something to eat.

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,660
Are you from far away, miss?

42
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,879
Can't you help me with something, miss?

43
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,370
I've got six kids at home. Starving.

44
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,590
Have mercy, lady.

45
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,880
I've got nothing, I'm sorry.

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,540
You've got something, anyway.

47
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,460
Give it back to her, good man.

48
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,760
Easy.

49
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,460
My lord...

50
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,280
Leave him!

51
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,080
Father!

52
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,230
Don't leave me, Father!

53
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,290
Help me, man! Save him!

54
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,770
You are so much like her...

55
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,120
Don't leave me, Father...

56
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,140
Queen Jadwiga!

57
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:43,020
Sit down, please.

58
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,900
I want everybody to feel like at home.

59
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,979
I've got to talk to him.

60
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,840
With whom?

61
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,840
You know very well. Help me.

62
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,270
No.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,369
I'll talk to him.

64
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,949
It will only make him angry. You know him.

65
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,619
I do. And I know you too.

66
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,800
I remember how you sneaked out together,

67
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,429
against everybody and everything.

68
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,280
Quiet!

69
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Pour!

70
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,789
Nobody can learn about me and him.

71
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,789
I've got to talk to him.

72
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:39,790
It won't end well.

73
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,720
Sit down, child.

74
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,520
Helen...

75
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,180
I know how hard it is for you to be
far from your family, your mother.

76
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,860
And being a lady-in-waiting
is sometimes difficult.

77
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,559
It's great honour.

78
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
I know I can rely on you.

79
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,739
I can, can't I? You're honest, sincere

80
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,740
you got good upbringing.

81
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,339
Thank you, lady.

82
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,720
I know you'll understand my... concerns.

83
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,739
The coronation's coming soon,

84
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,400
there are more and more
strangers at the court...

85
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,550
I want to you to keep an eye on Anna.

86
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,460
It's for her benefit. And yours.

87
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,120
- Mine? - Yes. As her maid,
you're responsible for her.

88
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,740
So, be watchful, please.

89
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,420
Very watchful.

90
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,360
Day and... night.

91
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,079
What happened?

92
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,760
Have you seen a ghost?

93
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,209
Arunas?

94
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,680
Leave us alone, Egle.

95
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,959
The queen can be alone
with a male stranger.

96
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,959
I'm not a stranger, Egle.

97
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,960
You know me since I was a child.

98
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,639
And what if somebody learns you're here?

99
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,150
Make sure nobody does.

100
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,180
I thought you're wiser.

101
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,179
Why did you come here?

102
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
I had no choice.

103
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,150
They say you've got no wife
or children, is it true?

104
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:16,939
Yes, true.

105
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,360
Why? You're free.

106
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,800
I burned the snake pendant I got from you.

107
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,599
Arunas, we were children.
It's time you forget me

108
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
and start living your own life.

109
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,810
You think I didn't marry because of you.

110
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,160
I saw why you left.

111
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,920
You gave him children.

112
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,719
I had no choice.

113
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,610
I can't remember you
resisted this marriage much.

114
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,040
You let yourself be sold.

115
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
For this...

116
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:50,399
How can you say so?

117
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
You had no choice!

118
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,680
And what choice was that...

119
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,599
Between a pauper and a king?

120
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,560
My father would never agree
for us to be together.

121
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,720
You didn't use to listen
to your father so much.

122
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,780
But it was before you learnt
you'd become a queen.

123
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,239
If only I had had another choice...

124
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,240
You had.

125
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,400
What do you want?

126
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,350
Queen Elizabeth is coming here.

127
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,680
Careful!

128
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,420
I'm here.

129
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,569
What happened?

130
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,569
Bandits attacked us.

131
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,690
Bring him to my chamber, quickly!

132
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,590
You have to try the dresses before the
maids start sewing in the ornaments.

133
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,390
Now?

134
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:58,990
Don't stand like a tailor's
dummy, help her take it off.

135
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,780
With such body, you don't need to
give your husband an aphrodisiac.

136
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,870
A man doesn't need much. You'll
just show your bare arm.

137
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,840
Heavy...

138
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:36,200
Being a woman is not light, and
being a queen is even heavier.

139
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,829
Embroidered rose bushes will be here,
each with three golden leaves.

140
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,220
Then branches with pearls, and...

141
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,470
Beautiful!

142
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,760
It will be finished with gold and silver.

143
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,800
Here, embroidered clover.

144
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,120
You need magic fingers for all of this.

145
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,009
I'm sorry...

146
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,009
You can do without them.

147
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:08,299
Luckily, a woman's love is shown
not only with her fingers

148
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,760
but also the eyes, mouth and
even the tip of her toe.

149
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,770
Unlike a man's love, which
grows only in his...

150
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,130
What?

151
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,339
You need to know something
before your wedding.

152
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,490
You give your husband ecstasy, and
he'll stay put by your bed like a dog.

153
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,839
Solid work, potter.

154
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,519
And what's that?

155
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Birds.

156
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,799
Very smart.

157
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,159
Children should see it.

158
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I don't have children.

159
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:49,710
The little princesses!

160
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,530
Why may children need clay birds?

161
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,889
Live ones are nicer.

162
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:55,919
All children, royal or
peasant, like to play!

163
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,799
What an idea! I am to
bring clay birds to kids.

164
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,160
They'll be happy.

165
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,700
We need to pay.

166
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,120
- How much? - 10 groszes each.

167
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,780
I'd buy two pots for this money!

168
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,420
All right. I'll pay.

169
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,439
I though he'd try to bargain!

170
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,610
The end price is 3 groszes.

171
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,100
We women must help each other.

172
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,800
Thank you.

173
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:37,210
Turn a little.

174
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,080
It will pinch a little...

175
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,920
It's nothing for a knight, though...

176
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,069
Are you all right?

177
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,720
Hush! Leave him alone.

178
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,420
He needs to rest.

179
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:31,130
You're going to make it.

180
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm so afraid.

181
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,249
Easy.

182
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,650
Tell me he's not going to die, please.

183
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,880
Tell me, I don't want to be alone.

184
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,270
You won't. I'll always be with you.

185
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,679
Is Pelka wounded?

186
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,680
Elias is dressing his wounds.

187
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,379
It's amazing the king had
time to visit my father.

188
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,380
Your father is not just a knight.

189
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,490
Still, it's amazing...

190
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,040
For my father, it must be important.

191
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,719
Because of the marriage
of Aldona and Casimirus,

192
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,719
we're closer to the Christian world.

193
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Don't tell me you want to be baptized.

194
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,709
I want our people to have a better life.
Is it bad?

195
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,479
Our people love, dance, enjoy themselves.

196
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,300
Here they'd be better off
without this Calvary.

197
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,240
I want to see Krakow
from the tallest tower.

198
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,029
Have you seen Arunas, where is he?

199
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,319
- He should see it.
- He must have got lost.

200
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,119
It's his first time in such a castle.

201
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,100
We'll find him.

202
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,649
He was to visit places with us.

203
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,399
Learn courtly manners.

204
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,049
Everything is different and new for him.

205
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:56,490
He's my bravest man but he
cringed the moment he saw Wawel.

206
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,320
/Lithuanian/ Find Arunas!

207
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,020
Don't get up.

208
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,430
Elias let me stay here if
you promise not to get up.

209
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,589
Where's my daughter?

210
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,080
With Niemierza.

211
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,280
Forgive my insolence...

212
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,569
but I have to ask you for something...

213
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,800
Whatever you want.

214
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,719
Make sure she marries him.

215
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
He won't hurt her.

216
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,000
You're talking as if you were to die.

217
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,369
The wound is deep.

218
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,130
Are you in a hurry?

219
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,420
Wouldn't you prefer to
dance on her wedding?

220
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,920
Promise me.

221
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,359
I'll make sure Cudka marries Niemierza.

222
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,280
I'll supply them with everything.

223
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,840
I'll do everything for
your daughter to be happy.

224
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,580
I'll send a maid with whiting.

225
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,510
Elizabeth, thank you.

226
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,000
Helena, I thank you too.

227
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,660
I didn't stop thinking of you.

228
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,819
I can't.

229
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,080
Someone can come in here anytime.

230
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,410
Meet me at night.

231
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,759
You're stronger.

232
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,759
You've got shape too.

233
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,760
You peeped.

234
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,660
Find one man who'd hold himself.

235
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:23,450
I'll keep this picture
in my mind till I die.

236
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,960
Go now.

237
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,860
Wait for me at the Eastern Gate.

238
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,400
Arunas!

239
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,750
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

240
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,609
I married somebody else.

241
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,219
You're mine and you will.

242
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,599
- I swore to God. - Their god. Not ours.

243
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Now, mine too.

244
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,599
Don't you remember when we
made sacrifice to Perkunas?

245
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,630
This was before I got to know the real god.

246
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,839
Have you seen him?

247
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,840
No.

248
00:20:57,841 --> 00:20:59,660
So, how do you know he's real?

249
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,649
From here. Faith doesn't come
from your head, but your heart.

250
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,650
So does love.

251
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,840
For all this time, I haven't
touched another woman.

252
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,279
Do you love me?

253
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
Are you still asking?

254
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,129
When I'm next to you and I hear your voice,

255
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,129
I have less and less strength...

256
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,000
So, if you really love me,
lead me not into temptation.

257
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,330
God wouldn't forgive me, nor Casimirus.
I can't.

258
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,640
Father, how are you?

259
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:57,660
When I see you, I feel better at once.

260
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,640
You're so beautiful...

261
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,400
Guard her, boy.

262
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,860
Like the apple of my eye.

263
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,960
- Does it hurt? I'll call Elias. - No.

264
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,870
All's in God's hands.

265
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,150
Maybe He will let me see
my grandchildren first,

266
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,090
before He summons me.

267
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,800
Helen, speak, please.

268
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,320
I followed Anna.

269
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,580
Speak, for God's sake.

270
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,660
I saw her... with a Lithuanian.

271
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:52,320
Did Anna betray Casimirus?

272
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,049
Helen, if you want to stay at the
court, you have to tell the truth.

273
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,440
Did Anna betray my son?

274
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,710
I knew it.

275
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,040
I knew it.

276
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,770
She can't become the queen.

277
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,640
God! What will happen now?

278
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:21,040
Don't talk to anybody about it, even Jasko.
