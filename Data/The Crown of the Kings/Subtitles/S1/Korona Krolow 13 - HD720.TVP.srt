1
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,680
I may not eat meat

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,560
but I really missed horse riding.

3
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,480
Not only you, but we have
to follow the rules.

4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,940
You can change them,

5
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,120
you'll be king soon,

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,960
actually, you're king already.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,680
If the king doesn't follow the law

8
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,120
he becomes a tyrant.

9
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,120
This is the only thing
I'm really afraid of.

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,120
I've seen a lot of pride
among those who rule,

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,320
and I don't want to be like this.

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,040
You won't. You're different, you're free.

13
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,680
Lent is over.

14
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,720
We buried Father. Let's
hold a feast, at last!

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,020
You know how Mother will react
when she hears of dances.

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,900
- Another quarrel...
- There will be another quarell, whatever.

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,390
She doesn't need a reason.

18
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,990
Let's wait till the coronation.

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:22,990
And then, will it be different?

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,400
/praying in Latin/

21
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,550
How do you think?

22
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,640
Is it my fault little Elizabeth fainted?

23
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,910
She's a child and she fasted like an adult.

24
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,160
I shouldn't have taken her to give alms.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,450
Mum, it's not your fault.

26
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,850
The weather's so changeable
and she's so sensitive...

27
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,810
Mother?

28
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,360
What happened?

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,590
Little Stephen... was the same as she.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,320
My firstborn son...

31
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,380
We've never talked about it.

32
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,150
Never.

33
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,790
Pity, isn't it?

34
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,680
I still can see... the
faces of my dead children.

35
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,740
Shall we pray together?

36
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,620
And you?

37
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,620
I'll pray for you.

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,080
I'll pray my whole life.

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Not whole!

40
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,050
One day you'll get married
and have a lot of duties.

41
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,420
No, queen aunt, I'll go to
monastery, I won't get married.

42
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,960
Mum is always sad and it's
so beautiful in church.

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,520
Elizabeth, but marriage is very important,

44
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,020
you'll have children, and you may
even be the ruler of a kingdom,

45
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,650
like me or aunt?

46
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,060
But I don't want. I'll pray
for Dad, that is, the king.

47
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,060
And for Poland.

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,930
What's going on?

49
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,200
Nothing.

50
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,880
I can see you're hiding something.

51
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,550
No.

52
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,030
I talked to Algirdas at the hunt,

53
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,310
and he worries about you

54
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,870
he says you look lost.

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,350
Let's leave them.

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,070
If they need us, they'll find us.

57
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,000
Or we'll find them.

58
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,560
They didn't even leave
one bowl in one piece.

59
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,680
The stole all baskets and hares.

60
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,790
Everything I bought from
Hungarian merchants.

61
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,730
Hides, sacks, belts, wine skins...

62
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,730
They stole everything.

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,600
God, for what sins do you
punish me like this?

64
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,800
And there? Two barrels
with cabbage were hidden.

65
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,260
They sniffed them and stole them.

66
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,810
There were dried mushrooms here.

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,960
Nothing's left.

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
I'll help you, Rose.

69
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,300
And everything I collected
at the king's funeral.

70
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,640
Big purchases attract thieves.

71
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,330
I heard the inn-keeper
is looking for workers.

72
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,880
Am I to serve beer to the drunkards?

73
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm sorry, Rose, I only wanted...

74
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,240
What did you want? Did you want
me to be a servant at the inn?

75
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,400
I only wanted to help, Rose.

76
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
God forgive you such advice.

77
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,360
I'd better go.

78
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,400
What's biting you?

79
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:58,400
He should know when you work for yourself,
you don't want to be somebody's servant.

80
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,430
But he meant well. You should go
to the castellan. He's a just man.

81
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,800
- What for?
- With request, as a victim of thieves.

82
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,650
You'll make a complaint and
maybe you'll get something.

83
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,580
The castellan should know
there's banditry in town.

84
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,600
Where's Aldona?

85
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,130
Gone for a ride.

86
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,520
In such weather? There's
going to be a storm!

87
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,390
Little Kunegunda and Yolanta
are quarreling again.

88
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,290
You need to understand Yolanta.
She experienced a lot.

89
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,290
A savage...

90
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,440
She says little but she can scream.

91
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
I think she needs a mother.

92
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,110
I feel nobody cares about her.

93
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,520
It's true. The kid doesn't understand
you're on your own in the world.

94
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,560
I'd be happy to take care of her, but...

95
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,360
I'm afraid to ask.

96
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,100
It can't be like this. We
need to talk to Aldona.

97
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,700
Anna.

98
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,910
I don't want to go back to the castle.

99
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,910
It's so gloomy there.

100
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,920
It's not easy for the girls either.

101
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,130
First, the grandfather's death, then

102
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:17,820
the whole affair with poison.

103
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,320
I worry about them,
especially little Elizabeth.

104
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,530
Admit it, Yolanta's on your mind.

105
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,480
Will you ever tell me who her mother was?

106
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,340
She's dead. Isn't it enough?

107
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,410
I don't want to revisit the past, but
I won't send her back to monastery.

108
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,770
The Hungarians were executed.
There's no danger anymore.

109
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,340
They were not alone. We
don't know who helped them.

110
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,330
There's an inn over there.

111
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,870
The poorest of your
subjects must eat better.

112
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,330
Excess at the castle hurts the subjects
when the country's ruined by war.

113
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,780
Your highness, I have a letter from
his majesty king Charles Robert.

114
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,190
Maybe they've discovered
other conspirators...

115
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,190
Let me open it, Mother.

116
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,950
Bad news?

117
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,230
The pope fainted during a mass.

118
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,960
Well, he's almost 90 years old.

119
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,880
He nominated three cardinals, Frenchmen.

120
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,710
So, again Frenchmen are going
to elect the next pope?

121
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,340
My husband asked me to pass
his respects to Mother.

122
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,550
Tell him I pray for him.

123
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,430
You witnessed the execution, didn't you?

124
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,470
Did they say anything before they
died, did they turn anybody in?

125
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,350
Even when tortured, they
only cursed his highness.

126
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,040
They said he's got enemies, in Poland too.

127
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,760
Are you hiding something? I've
got no secrets from my mother.

128
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
That's all I know.

129
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,480
Anybody rising against my son
will be severely punished.

130
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,590
I believe, by God's decree, he'll be king.

131
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,040
They're robbing again.

132
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,520
Those merchants lost everything.

133
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,230
They even stole peasants' herbs.

134
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,000
In Krakow it's the same story.

135
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,400
My acquaintance, a stall
holder, was robbed too.

136
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,440
I'm looking for a job for her...

137
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,540
No! I wanted to hire somebody
but I have nothing to pay now.

138
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,640
I'll be broke myself soon.
People have nothing to pay with.

139
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,430
Today I've only sold two fishes
and three bowls of groats.

140
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,590
I can't afford it.

141
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,590
Say, how to live?

142
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,800
And even this rain...

143
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,640
Lightnings, the end of the world.

144
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,520
One beer, please.

145
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,060
A moment.

146
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,120
I told you the castellan's not here.

147
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,940
So, who'll listen to my complaint?

148
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,260
Help, good people, help!

149
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,840
What's going on?

150
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,000
Let go!

151
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,700
Sire, I came to see the castellan.

152
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,560
He's said to have gone
to the Teutonic knights.

153
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,010
He's not in Krakow.

154
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,360
So, who's going to help me?

155
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,080
I'm only a stall holder.
My husband drowned.

156
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,320
Such misfortune! They took everything,
even the last piece of cheese.

157
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,340
Calm down! Who and what
did they take from you?

158
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,640
They must be pagans because
it was a holy day.

159
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,210
I fasted on Good Friday, and today too.

160
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,010
Today it's because I have
nothing to eat anyway.

161
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,620
On Easter they burgled my
house and took everything.

162
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,360
I'll pass it to the castellan
and he'll take care of it.

163
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,990
Will I get back even a little?

164
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,230
Come in a fortnight.

165
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,810
He'll hear you out.

166
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,090
Sir, I beg you, give me something to eat.

167
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,640
How can I pay you if I was robbed?

168
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,460
Where will I take goods
from if I give them away?

169
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,630
At least give me something to drink, man!

170
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,860
Fine.

171
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,280
Here.

172
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,620
God bless you, sir.

173
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:10,060
May God be with you, inn-keeper.

174
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,650
May God be with you, my lords!

175
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,080
Go away!
Sit down, please!

176
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,780
Sit down please!

177
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,200
Serve us your best food! Quickly!

178
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,830
Yes, sir! I'm on it! The best!

179
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,240
It must be some great lord.

180
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,390
It's raining.

181
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,640
It's not safe here.

182
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,240
What do you think of sending Anna
with the girls to the north?

183
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Maybe Sandomierz.

184
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,240
- Mum! - Yes?

185
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,750
You shouldn't separate
Casimirus from his wife.

186
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,590
Who's talking about separation?

187
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,410
It's all about her feeling safe.

188
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,860
And I can be free here and
take care of politics.

189
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,480
All you want is to keep the crown.

190
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,080
Maybe.

191
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,080
All I want is that all is well

192
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,760
for our family and, first
of all, for the new king.

193
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,440
I hope Casimirus took a
warm kaftan and cape.

194
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:29,240
Coming, my lords, here you are...

195
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,920
God bless you.

196
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,520
Pardon my insolence, your highness

197
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,630
May God be with you.

198
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,150
I'm begging you, my
acquaintance was robbed.

199
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,620
The woman's left with nothing.
She's left alone and without help.

200
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:08,090
My lord, help ordinary folk.
Thieves are spawning everywhere,

201
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,950
on roads, in towns, it can't be!

202
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,760
You impressed me you
don't ask for yourself.

203
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,260
Who are you?

204
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,920
I'm a potter. I do the best I can.

205
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,840
- What's your name? - Joseph.

206
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
I was brought up in Pradnik.

207
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,340
Inn-keeper!

208
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,020
How much is in our purse?

209
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,720
Yes, sire!

210
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,940
Today, you'll feed everyone hungry.

211
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
Whatever you have.

212
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,570
Yes, sire!

213
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,120
Who is it?

214
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,520
Man! This is king Casimirus!

215
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,130
Lady, there's only beer, very poor.

216
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,870
Your highness, can we enter?

217
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,820
Sure. Amadeus, bring in the gifts.

218
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,990
This is for you.

219
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,040
Thank you.

220
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,440
And this is for you.

221
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,200
Thank you.

222
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,750
Yolanta, you'll get something special.

223
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,480
This rosary was blessed
by the pope in Avignon.

224
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,140
It's treasure.

225
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,610
Let it lead you in your life.

226
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,880
Queen Aunt, I'll be happy
to exchange, may I?

227
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,870
I prefer a rosary, and I see Yolanta's sad.

228
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,040
May everybody have a heart like you.

229
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,600
I also have a great request to you.

230
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,730
Ask Grandma to let me learn to write.
I'd really like to!

231
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,680
Now?

232
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,760
St. Felix wrote letters
to the emperor at my age.

233
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,800
Potter!

234
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,220
My wife has a request to you.

235
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,100
You'll make beautiful bowls
and jugs for our castle.

236
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,800
Lady, I will! Whatever I can.

237
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,420
The coronation's coming.

238
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,420
An important day. There'll be may guests.

239
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,440
I'd like more such beautiful
things to be at the castle.

240
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,820
I don't know if I'll manage, lady...

241
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,940
Come to Wawel.

242
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:56,880
My sister queen Elizabeth's
people will show you new styles.

243
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,290
It's great honour!

244
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,290
But remember!

245
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,350
I don't want them to be the
same as Hungarian or Venetian.

246
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:08,090
I want them to be colorful
and decorative, but ours.

247
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,300
Polish!

248
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,300
And let this acquaintance
of yours help you.

249
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,980
Yes, sire!

250
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,640
Forgive me, sire, another
guest has recognized you.

251
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,450
Can they come closer?

252
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:28,490
Come people!

253
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,360
King! We thank you!

254
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:51,680
God, if you leave people no other
choice, this must mean only one thing.

255
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,030
That you summon them, do you?

256
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:59,820
I had a bad husband.
Drunkard, but he was mine.

257
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,390
The Vistula River took him from me.

258
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:06,400
If they hadn't robbed me,
maybe I could make it.

259
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,770
If God allowed...

260
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,160
But He didn't...

261
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,260
Maybe it never rains but it pours...

262
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,900
And God has nothing to do with it.

263
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,130
Jesus!

264
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,250
Rose, for God's sake!

265
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,770
and then the people knelt and
the whole inn started shaking...

266
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,570
and Casimirus only looked humbly...

267
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,780
Cudka, he's... really great.

268
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,760
You should see the beautiful dresses
queen Elizabeth brought for the girls.

269
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,360
And, imagine, little Elizabeth
gave hers to Yolanta

270
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,110
because she wasn't given a dress
but a rosary, and she was sad.

271
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,110
What did queen mother say?

272
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,380
She doesn't like when the girls dress up.

273
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,160
Yes, but they were so happy!
It was joy to see it.

274
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,470
Cudka... you like children, don't you?

275
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,200
I'd like to care of orphans.

276
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,000
When I see Yolanta my heart breaks.

277
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,220
I won't thank you. Don't expect it.

278
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:48,270
I don't want you to thank
me but to find a job

279
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,270
which you may like.

280
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,450
If you helped me with my jugs,
it would be much easier.

281
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,940
I'm good at trading, not craft.

282
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,750
You'll learn soon.

283
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:03,640
Just for a start to help you
stand on your own feet.

284
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,250
I've got a big order from the king.

285
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,830
I won't manage just by myself.

286
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,830
But on the very holy day...

287
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,260
Easter!

288
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
I went to the office and what?

289
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,210
It's not fair!

290
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,400
But the king is. And his wife, Anna, too.

291
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,160
When I told them about you, they
placed an order immediately.

292
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,440
I told them!

293
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,550
God bless you!

294
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,200
Casimirus, I have a request to you.

295
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,370
Write to the chancellor and...
he'll consider it.

296
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,950
Oh, say it out!

297
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,310
Will you agree that I get married?

298
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:52,720
Sure, Niemierza, this is great news!

299
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,270
With Cudka.

300
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,720
What do I have to do with it?
You've got to ask Pelka.

301
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
But I want to have the king's blessing.

302
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,030
You've got it, of course!

303
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,800
We'd also like to...

304
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,180
adopt Yolanta.

305
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,650
She'd be close to you,
and she'd have a family.

306
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,480
I'm sorry, I didn't want to disturb you.

307
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,680
I just mean well.

308
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,950
I know you're doing it for me

309
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,950
and you don't need help at all.

310
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,950
- But... - Don't interrupt!

311
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,280
It's nice you do it for me.

312
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,520
I'm poor. No one at all
would pay attention to me.

313
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:49,790
I will work with you.

314
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:52,380
And your potter's shop will be...

315
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,650
not only the best in the whole street...

316
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,890
but in the whole kingdom!

317
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,290
If, of course, it's true about
this order from the king.

318
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,760
Because I won't believe
you met him face to face.

319
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:14,640
I'll save money, and I'll order
beautiful votive offerings for Martin.

320
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
The most beautiful in Krakow.

321
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,620
For my little Martin...

322
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:36,040
Casimirus!

323
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,920
Where are you?

324
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,930
The first night in the king's chamber.

325
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,160
It's a bit creepy here.

326
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,110
Niemierza asked to give him
consent to marry Cudka.

327
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:54,730
And? Did you agree?

328
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:59,470
I won't stand in the way of love.

329
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,050
You can't!

330
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,600
Cudka's afraid to ask me, but I see
she'd like to take care of Yolanta.

331
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,040
Let them get married, but I
won't let them take her.

332
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,520
I see everything starts to turn out fine...
