1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:03,500
- [Gypsy] When Ryan and I got
married, it was by a bathroom.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,042
- [Ryan] Gypsy's always
needed that white dress moment.

3
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,167
- Yeah, I can see it.

4
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,750
- It's beautiful, right?

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,875
- Is this the life that we
really wanna lead for ourselves?

6
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,000
- But I still would
like you to remarry me.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,875
- The timing needs
to be at a little bit

8
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,583
of a more convenient time.

9
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,708
- You know, I'm not her mother.

10
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,625
I'm not trying to prevent
her from living her life.

11
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:30,250
- If I see that I am being
controlled, I'm leaving.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,583
Still crying, you know?

13
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:34,042
I said, "I miss Ken."

14
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:36,708
- Gypsy's gone to her
parents without me.

15
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,958
- All right, well, I gotta go.

16
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:46,000
Sometimes it's actually really
nice not to have him around.

17
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,083
I just don't know what to do.

18
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:50,833
I gotta delete my social media.

19
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,042
- Baby, that is revenue.

20
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:54,000
- I don't care!

21
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,750
- Yes! All of a
sudden, now you're not.

22
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,000
[tense urgent music]

23
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,167
- I don't wanna split up,

24
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:05,667
but I mean, it's not up to me.

25
00:01:05,667 --> 00:01:06,708
It's never been up to me.

26
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:11,042
[foreboding music]

27
00:01:12,042 --> 00:01:15,542
[tense music]

28
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:18,125
[traffic whirring]

29
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:21,292
[birds chirping]

30
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:29,458
- So Ryan and I are having
an argument right now.

31
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:30,333
- Really?

32
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:33,833
- Well, I didn't, he
texted me something

33
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:36,542
the night that I first got here,

34
00:01:36,542 --> 00:01:40,917
and I didn't wanna show
you or Mom right away

35
00:01:40,917 --> 00:01:45,292
or at all, so I just
kept it to myself.

36
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:50,208
And this morning, we start
having more of a fight.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,792
This is what he said,
the very middle text

38
00:01:52,792 --> 00:01:55,417
is what he said the first
night that I was here.

39
00:01:57,958 --> 00:01:59,750
- "I'm gonna be honest
about something,

40
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:04,208
I could really give a
[bleep] about your dad's..."

41
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:08,333
[melancholic music]

42
00:02:09,542 --> 00:02:13,708
Wow, [tongue clicks]
that's unbelievable.

43
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,208
It's a shame he feels that way.

44
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,083
Can't believe he would say that.

45
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,667
- Yeah, and-
- [Kristy] He doesn't get it.

46
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,708
- No, I'm like-
- Is that his true colors,

47
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:27,083
like, coming out?

48
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,542
- When things are good,
things are really good,

49
00:02:29,542 --> 00:02:32,458
but he's so selfish when
it comes to my time.

50
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:40,375
I give him a call and he's
like "Well, video call with me."

51
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,708
You know? And I'm like,

52
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,833
"You know, we don't need
to do that right now."

53
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:45,375
And he's like, "Why?

54
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,875
Is there somebody there that
you don't want me to see?"

55
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:53,042
Like, the way he was
hinting as if Ken was here.

56
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,250
- Yeah, right?

57
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,500
- [Gypsy] I know.

58
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,333
- Like, we would
allow that to happen.

59
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,042
- [Gypsy] I know.
- [Kristy] Exactly, exactly.

60
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:00,333
- And I think I texted him,

61
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,292
and I was like, "I'm not dealing

62
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,875
with this [bleep] right now."

63
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:04,250
- Good.

64
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,625
- And when I stand my
ground, he'll back down,

65
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:10,458
and he will apologize
because that will pacify me,

66
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,833
and it'll lead to us making up,

67
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,583
but no real solution happens.

68
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,042
I understand if he's insecure.

69
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:20,667
I get it, but to sit there

70
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:25,375
and almost nonchalantly
accuse me of cheating on him

71
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:27,708
while I'm here spending
time with y'all.

72
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:28,792
- Right.

73
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,167
- I mean, I love Ryan,

74
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,500
but we have been going
through this cycle

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,125
for years, three years.

76
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,708
The cycle is,

77
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,542
I have a little freedom

78
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:46,000
and Ryan gets jealous
and possessive.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,833
And I shy away from that,

80
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:51,000
and I try to stand my ground.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,208
- To me, that's a big red flag.

82
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,792
- It is a red
flag, and I see it!

83
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,250
- It's not good.

84
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,250
I think he doesn't get it.

85
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:01,167
I think he doesn't get that it,

86
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,042
you know, it's all triggers.
[bird cawing]

87
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,042
You feel confined,
you feel trapped,

88
00:04:05,042 --> 00:04:06,708
you feel like
there's no way out.

89
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:09,375
And every time he does
something like that,

90
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:12,000
he's trying to put you
back into this box.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,500
- And I fight it too.

92
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,958
It's not like I sit
there and take it.

93
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,375
I stand up for myself,

94
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,292
and I'm like,
"Don't be selfish."

95
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,958
- Right, right.
- And I called him out on it.

96
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,167
And then his divert back is,

97
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,583
"I was just kidding."

98
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,083
- [Rod] You don't say
that if you're kidding.

99
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,125
- [Gypsy] No, it's blame.

100
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,000
- [Kristy] It's always
that, right?

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,333
- It's always that.

102
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,542
- Look, he knew
what he was getting.

103
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,417
He knew he was
getting you that was,

104
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,542
had been confined all your life.

105
00:04:33,542 --> 00:04:36,375
And he had to realize that

106
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,542
you're gonna feel like
you want some freedom.

107
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,708
And he should have
understood that

108
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,292
he's gonna have to
give you some of that.

109
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,083
And he needs to deal with it,

110
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,667
and let you do your thing,

111
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,500
and let you find your
little place in the world.

112
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:52,875
- I wanna make it work.

113
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:56,792
So I keep making it work,

114
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:59,875
but I feel like I'm
ignoring some inner voice

115
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,708
that tells me that, "You
know what you should do,

116
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:06,542
but the journey there is
gonna be long and difficult."

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
[contemplative music]

118
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:16,250
[melancholic music]

119
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,333
[traffic whirring]

120
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,292
[birds chirping]

121
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,000
I am glad that I had this
solo time with my dad.

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,458
My dad just wants my happiness.

123
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,125
But the fight that
Ryan and I are having,

124
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,417
I mean, Ryan and I are
gonna have to talk about it.

125
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,917
How that goes, I don't know.

126
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,958
- Okay, we're ready.

127
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:45,458
[door creaking]

128
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:46,958
- [Gypsy] Hey!
- Thank you for coming.

129
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:51,500
- [Kristy] Yeah, we'll get you
a bike next time.

130
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,375
- You did? You had fun?

131
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,375
- [Gypsy] I had a lot of fun.

132
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:54,375
- We'll go camping again?
- Yeah!

133
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:55,833
- Yeah.
- Really glad you had fun.

134
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,542
- I did, I did.

135
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,167
- My gut reaction after
seeing the text from Gypsy

136
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,875
is I gave him a 50/50 chance,

137
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,083
and maybe I was wrong.

138
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,417
It's gonna be harder
than we expected for them

139
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:13,083
to work through this.

140
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,542
Ryan's gonna have to man up,

141
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,583
and really give her a
little bit of freedom,

142
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,292
and just lighten up.

143
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,625
He's pushing her away.

144
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:22,583
[door creaking]

145
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:28,458
[luggage wheels rattling]

146
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:31,292
[traffic whirring]

147
00:06:31,292 --> 00:06:33,958
[tense music]

148
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,167
[Gypsy sobbing]

149
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,583
- I'm back home.

150
00:06:47,042 --> 00:06:48,792
[Gypsy sighing]

151
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,292
[Gypsy sniffing]

152
00:06:51,292 --> 00:06:53,042
Ryan bought me flowers.

153
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,500
[Gypsy sniffing]

154
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,542
[sad music]

155
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:04,500
And he said he was sorry.

156
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,875
[sad music continues]

157
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,750
I just don't know what to do.

158
00:07:21,458 --> 00:07:24,083
[hopeful music]

159
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,750
- Gypsy went to
visit her parents

160
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,333
in Cut Off this past weekend.

161
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,833
And you know, I
knew she'd be busy.

162
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:35,083
Rod felt like he hadn't
had that one-on-one time.

163
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:39,167
And I guess when I'm there,
it feels like, you know,

164
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,000
I might get in the way of that.

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,167
And I was like, "Okay,
that's fine, I understand."

166
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,375
And I was very understanding.

167
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:49,500
- So when I came back
from my parents' house,

168
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,583
my dad and Kristy had
carried my suitcase

169
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,458
up to our apartment,

170
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:56,750
and Ryan was waiting for us.

171
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,750
And I step into the door,

172
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,208
and the first thing
I see is, like,

173
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:01,667
a big bouquet of flowers.

174
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:05,292
Then when we start
talking, I told him,

175
00:08:05,292 --> 00:08:07,500
"You were being
selfish this weekend.

176
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,375
The thing that you said
about my dad was unfair."

177
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:13,458
And he's like, "I
was just joking.

178
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,875
Didn't you see where
I said, 'Ha, ha'?"

179
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:19,125
- I know what I did was
wrong in certain aspects.

180
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,917
I hit a trauma trigger.

181
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,500
And I hate that we fought the
first weekend we were away,

182
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,375
like, that was the
first time we were apart

183
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,833
since she's been outta jail.

184
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,375
It was just a bad weekend.

185
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,542
We eventually made up.

186
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:31,875
And now, we're great.

187
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,875
- We sat down and we
talked for a little bit.

188
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:37,000
And he's like, "I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that."

189
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,000
- Currently, things are fine.

190
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,500
- I mean, that's one
thing I love about me

191
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,792
and Gypsy is that if
we have an argument,

192
00:08:48,792 --> 00:08:52,042
we grow from it and
we move forward.

193
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,042
[tense music]

194
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:00,417
[foreboding music]

195
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,125
- So you did that
video today, huh?

196
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,167
Let me watch this thing.

197
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,500
See what the big fuss is about.

198
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,375
All right, so here we go.

199
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,292
- So to anyone watching...

200
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:13,542
- Ah, it's too long.

201
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:15,500
- No, let me watch it. Ow!

202
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,583
they asked me

203
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,875
what was my feelings
about my co-defendant

204
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,833
and how did I feel that

205
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:30,667
he is doing life without parole?

206
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,625
- You talked about him.
- [Gypsy] And in comparison

207
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,625
to my sentence,

208
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:36,458
and I was honest with them.
- And [indistinct].

209
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,750
- I've always felt that,

210
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,708
I feel like more than one life

211
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,667
was taken that
night because of me.

212
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:49,667
They put two stipulations
on me, mandatory therapy

213
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:53,292
and no contact with
my co-defendant,

214
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:54,833
absolutely no contact.

215
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,958
And that's fine as well.

216
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,167
I'm gonna be honest,
I got carried away

217
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:00,958
in the hype of everything.

218
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:06,958
Social media is, like,
literally a doorway to hell.

219
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,375
Like, it's so crazy.
[both chuckling]

220
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,875
I can't even wrap
my head around it.

221
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,667
- Doorway to hell.
[Gypsy chuckling]

222
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,833
- It's contemplating deleting
it in a couple months.

223
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:17,958
I don't know.

224
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:22,125
To all the people
that I offended

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,375
with a lack of accountability,

226
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:29,583
I'm sorry, I'm learning.

227
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,000
So thank you for watching, bye.

228
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,000
That's my video.

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,208
- [Ryan] That was good,
baby. I like that.

230
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,000
- I did that while
you were at work.

231
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,000
- And I'm proud of you.

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,250
- I was tired of
feeling like I had to

233
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,625
watch this and watch that,

234
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:53,167
like, be careful what I say.

235
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:55,750
- I've been trying to
tell you that for a while.

236
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,542
- I'm like, I'm
trying so careful

237
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:03,625
not to make any wrong
moves for my parole,

238
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,583
and I feel like I
get lost in that.

239
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,125
- Right.

240
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,792
Baby, I've been on this
journey with you, I get it.

241
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,708
Like, I've been telling
you from day one,

242
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:15,042
like, just be yourself
'cause you're great.

243
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,542
- Yeah.

244
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,958
[uplifting music]

245
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,958
- We'll talk about
the delete later,

246
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:22,208
but right now, we're
not deleting that.

247
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,167
- Well, I said in
a couple months.

248
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:26,917
- We'll see.

249
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,375
- I said in a couple months.

250
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,375
- I don't mind if you
stop posting as much,

251
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,417
but we'll talk about it later.

252
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,708
- I'm just not gonna tell
you if I'm gonna delete it.

253
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:38,167
- No, you're not gonna.

254
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:40,208
- Oh, it's gone! I don't
know what happened.

255
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,542
- No, you're not.

256
00:11:41,542 --> 00:11:43,625
[melancholic music]

257
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,458
[clock ticking]

258
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,125
- What did you guys think about

259
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:50,042
Gypsy's Taking
Accountability video?

260
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,792
[tense music]

261
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:56,958
- Nick Godejohn is currently
serving a life sentence

262
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:58,208
plus 25 years for the murder

263
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,875
of Gypsy Rose's mom,
Dee Dee Blanchard.

264
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,250
Gypsy Rose then got released,

265
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,917
and she's just out here
doing the most, the most.

266
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,208
- If you watch her videos,

267
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,500
she shuts down the
conversation about Nick,

268
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,792
redirects the question
back to herself,

269
00:12:08,792 --> 00:12:11,750
and is like, "I can't think
about that for my healing,

270
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,250
and my this, and
my that, you know?"

271
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,833
[tense music continues]

272
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:21,458
[soft pulsing music]

273
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:23,917
- [Gypsy] I'm ready.

274
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:24,875
- [Parole Officer] And I
have that piece of paper

275
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,500
saying you're off
of supervision.

276
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,250
- [Gypsy] Right.

277
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:30,083
And that's my ultimate goal too.

278
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,708
- [Parole Officer] Then you
got the rest of your life

279
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,708
to make as many
documentaries, and books,

280
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:35,708
and whatever you want to,

281
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:37,667
you know?
- Right.

282
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,583
Very true, very true.

283
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,875
- [Parole Officer]
Okay, all right.

284
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,500
- All right, thank you.

285
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,875
- [Parole Officer] If you want
my soapbox, you have my card.

286
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,042
- Thank you for calling.

287
00:12:46,042 --> 00:12:47,208
- [Parole Officer]
All right now, Gypsy.

288
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,708
- All right, bye-bye.
- Okay, bye.

289
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,875
- I gotta delete my social media

290
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:57,750
because people, that one
little thing where I said that,

291
00:12:59,042 --> 00:13:02,708
"I'm responsible for my
co-defendant being incarcerated.

292
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,542
I felt like two lives
were taken that night."

293
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,958
Somebody reported
that to Missouri

294
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,208
saying that I'm trying
to communicate with him.

295
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:10,375
- But you're not.

296
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,875
- Like I said,

297
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,000
people have the upper hand.
- Delete that.

298
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,917
Delete those videos.

299
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,292
- That's not good enough.

300
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:18,708
- Baby, that is revenue.
Does he know that?

301
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:19,958
- I don't care!

302
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,292
- I know, but did
you tell him that?

303
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:23,625
- I don't care!

304
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,750
- I get it! Then delete it.

305
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,375
- If all you care
about is [bleep] money-

306
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,542
- I don't! Delete it then.

307
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,792
Just let us pull that money out,

308
00:13:34,792 --> 00:13:36,292
at least, before you do that.

309
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,500
[Gypsy chuckling]

310
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,917
[moody downbeat music]

311
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,292
- Baby, that's what I was
saying, tell him that.

312
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,042
'Cause he's always
saying, "Get a job."

313
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,292
- [Gypsy] [bleep].

314
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,458
[Ryan sighing]

315
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,542
[raven cawing]

316
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,583
[distant thunder rumbling]

317
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,125
- I can't believe
you have to do that

318
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,000
because of one [bleep] comment.

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,542
That was a great video.

320
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,917
- [Ryan] I know you can.

321
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,875
- [Ryan] I know, but you're not.

322
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,042
Look at me.

323
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,875
Look at me.

324
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,958
- [Ryan] You are.

325
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,083
- [Ryan] You are.

326
00:14:32,583 --> 00:14:34,458
- You are doing
everything right.

327
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,625
[Gypsy sobbing]

328
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,542
You're doing everything right.

329
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:40,625
That's what sucks.

330
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,917
- [Gypsy] I know.

331
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:45,042
- [Ryan] That's what [bleep]
sucks about this.

332
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,500
[Gypsy sobbing]

333
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,875
Word for word, what'd he say?

334
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,042
He said, "Stop,"

335
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:58,125
or he just said,
"You have to do it"?

336
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,958
- [Gypsy] It's not
in my best interest

337
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:02,458
to have any public
social media right now.

338
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,708
- [Ryan] I don't want
you have to delete

339
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,042
because one person called.

340
00:15:07,042 --> 00:15:09,000
- [Gypsy] That's the
position that I'm in.

341
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,542
- I know, but I get it.

342
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:15,708
If you'd have done something
wrong, then I would be like,

343
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,542
"Baby, you gotta
delete that video."

344
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,333
- It's wrong to them, and
that's all that matters.

345
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,708
- [Ryan] But it's
not wrong, baby.

346
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,583
- It's not, doesn't
make it right.

347
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,333
- [Ryan] But who is it?
- But it's wrong to them.

348
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,167
- But a judge can't put you
back in jail for you saying,

349
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:30,917
"I am guilty of my crime,
and I did my time."

350
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:31,958
Just breathe for me.

351
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,542
That's all I'm asking you to do,

352
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,542
'cause he didn't come
here with handcuffs.

353
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:40,667
[sad music]

354
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,083
I don't want you to
go back to prison.

355
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,958
I mean, it's [bleep] ridiculous.

356
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,125
- It's all I care about.

357
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,792
There's not enough
money in the world

358
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,375
that can get me out,

359
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,625
does that make sense?
- Baby, I get it.

360
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,625
I get it.

361
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:56,458
[troubling music]

362
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,375
Baby, you haven't
done anything wrong.

363
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:07,250
And your directive has
never said no social media.

364
00:16:08,042 --> 00:16:09,458
- No, my directive does not.

365
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:10,583
- You have to get a job,

366
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,083
and you have to bring in income.

367
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,083
This is your income.

368
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:17,000
Social media is your income.

369
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:21,542
That's my point
when I said revenue.

370
00:16:21,542 --> 00:16:23,750
[wary music]

371
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,083
- It's not a good idea

372
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:29,750
to post anymore on
public social media.

373
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,375
- Okay.

374
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,667
- And I'm gonna heed those words
regardless of what you say.

375
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,708
Would you put a
price on my freedom?

376
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,167
- No, of course not.

377
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,458
Of course not.

378
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,667
[wary music continues]

379
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:52,500
[Gypsy's throat clearing]

380
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,208
[Gypsy sniffing]

381
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,500
- Okay.

382
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,708
[wary music continues]

383
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,083
Okay, I'll just,

384
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:05,708
I just wanna sit and think
on things for a bit, okay?

385
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,542
[tense music]

386
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:09,125
- Okay.

387
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,583
[tense music continues]

388
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,750
[suspenseful music]

389
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:25,750
You look really nice.

390
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,083
- [Gypsy] Thank you.

391
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,792
- That halter top you
bought last night, huh?

392
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:30,583
- No, this is a different one.

393
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:31,542
- Is it?

394
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:33,167
- This is actually
athletic wear.

395
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,750
- I like it.

396
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,875
You're tired, huh?

397
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,333
- I'm so tired.

398
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,125
- Well, snap out of it,
baby, it's date night, wow!

399
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:41,958
[Gypsy groaning]

400
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,333
[Ryan laughing]

401
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:46,250
I didn't realize I
don't like that sound.

402
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,208
I don't like my
wife going [groans].

403
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,375
When I said it's date
night, you're like, [groans]

404
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:54,667
"Date night with my husband."

405
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,417
- I am talking.

406
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:03,292
[car engine whirring]

407
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:09,542
[melancholic music]

408
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,125
- [Gypsy] Hey, okay, thank you.

409
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,500
- [Ryan] Okay, thank
you very much.

410
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,458
Thank you very much.
- [Gyspy] All right, thank you.

411
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,792
- [Server] You guys enjoying?

412
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:21,333
- [Ryan] Hi, thank you.
- [Server] Yeah, of course.

413
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,208
- [Ryan] No, little plate.

414
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,667
- [Gypsy] Little plate?

415
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:25,208
- Yeah, that's for,
like, soy sauces, so.

416
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,708
- [Gypsy] Oh, okay.

417
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,708
- [Ryan] You never had 'em
like completely fresh, like-

418
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,417
- Yeah, nice and steaming.

419
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,833
[Ryan munching]

420
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:36,542
- [Patron] Yeah, yeah, sweet.

421
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,583
[Gypsy moaning]

422
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:38,792
- Good?
- Mm-hmm.

423
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:41,750
- You know, I just want
to take you somewhere.

424
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,250
I wanna do something.

425
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,875
You know, I don't want,

426
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:46,625
we go to the mall all the time.

427
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:50,167
We, you know, we haven't
gone to the movies yet.

428
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:52,667
You know, before you
got out of prison,

429
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,875
we always used to talk about
going to bed and breakfasts

430
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,667
and things like that, we
haven't done that yet either.

431
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,417
You know, we have time.
We can go to New Orleans.

432
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:02,000
We have time to do something.

433
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,375
And like, I haven't been to
the French Quarter with you.

434
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,208
- There's nothing much to
do in the French Quarter

435
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,583
for someone that is
can't go in bars though.

436
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:12,750
- You can go in bars,
you just can't drink.

437
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,458
- Can't go in an establishment

438
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,375
that the primary thing
being sold is alcohol.

439
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,708
- [Ryan] Really?

440
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,125
- Said so in my paperwork.

441
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,583
- Oh, that sucks.

442
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:25,792
- [Gypsy] Mm-hmm.

443
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,500
- There's places you could shop.

444
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,667
There's restaurants,
there's the aquarium.

445
00:19:32,417 --> 00:19:34,583
The Degas House
would've been awesome.

446
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,167
- [Gypsy] Yeah, it
was really pretty.

447
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:37,958
- [Ryan] It was gorgeous.

448
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,042
- Yeah.
- I mean,

449
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:39,667
that would've been
an experience.

450
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:41,375
We should have done that.

451
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,125
- Well, we weren't ready.

452
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,250
- [Ryan] Well, it's just-
- Had too much going on.

453
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,917
- I'd still say yes.
Would you still say yes?

454
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,417
- Yeah.

455
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,917
- [Ryan] Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

456
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:54,375
- You'd remarry me?

457
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,875
- [Gypsy] Huh?
- You'd remarry me?

458
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,958
[troubling music]

459
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,625
- Can we not do this on camera?

460
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:03,375
- Okay.
- [Gypsy] Okay.

461
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:04,667
- So that's a no, right?

462
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:05,625
- No, it's not a no.

463
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,208
It's just kind of
one of those things

464
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:09,250
that you could ask
those questions

465
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,708
when we're not filming.

466
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:12,875
- Okay.

467
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,083
- You know?

468
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,208
[patrons chattering
indistinctly]

469
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:16,417
You know what I'm saying?

470
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:18,542
Like, some things can
be just between us.

471
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,917
- Yeah, but we
can always say no.

472
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:23,042
We're just talking.
- Right.

473
00:20:23,042 --> 00:20:25,042
You're like, "Ah, oh my God."

474
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,375
- No, we're just talking.

475
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,583
- [Gypsy] Yeah.

476
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:28,375
- Oh yeah.
[dish sizzling]

477
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:29,750
- [Ryan] Oh wow.

478
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,167
- Be careful with her,
she's feisty today.

479
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,875
- [Ryan] That looks great.

480
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,125
- [Gypsy] Hey, fancy.

481
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,375
- [Ryan] That's nice.

482
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:36,708
- [Maria] Seaweed and Naruto,

483
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,875
and then that's gonna be
snow crab with all that.

484
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,000
- Thank you so much, Maria.
- The forks,

485
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,375
and I'll leave now, so enjoy.

486
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,333
- All right, thank you.
- All right, thanks.

487
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,583
- [Maria] Back in a little bit.

488
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:47,833
- How's the chicken?

489
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:55,208
[Ryan munching]

490
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,333
- So have you felt
cooped up any this week?

491
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:03,208
[patrons chattering
indistinctly]

492
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:05,750
- Well, have you?

493
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,875
[foreboding music]

494
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,375
No?

495
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll take that as a yes, okay.

496
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:21,125
[patrons continue to
chatter indistinctly]

497
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,917
[foreboding music continues]

498
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:28,458
- What you mean?

499
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:32,375
- It's like, it's very routine.

500
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,625
- That's not true.

501
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,708
That's so not true.

502
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:40,375
- I'm just saying
that, I don't know.

503
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,667
I'm gonna have times where I
feel cooped up and I'm tired.

504
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,250
- I know, babe.

505
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:53,000
I know you'd have been happy

506
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,792
just sitting at home tonight.

507
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,083
You know?

508
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,458

[Gypsy munching]

511
00:22:07,583 --> 00:22:09,750
Be right back.
- [Gypsy] Okay.

512
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,708
[foreboding music]

513
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:20,667
- I think, like, tonight, I'm
just in a mood. [chuckles]

514
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,208
[door creaking]

515

[door thudding]

517
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:38,500
- Okay, I know you're cold.

518
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,042
Ooh, God, baby,
your chill bumps.

519
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,875
[Gypsy chuckling]

520
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:48,292

526
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,000
[wary music]

527
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,125
Anything else going on?

528
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:11,458
- [Gypsy] Nope.
- [Ryan] Okay.

529
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,750
[wary music continues]

530
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,500
[car engine whirring]

531
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,042
- [Ryan] Huh?

532
00:23:58,542 --> 00:23:59,792
I mean, I'm...

533
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,417
It's, whatever, baby.

534
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:13,167
[Gypsy whimpering]

535
00:24:13,167 --> 00:24:16,667
[distant traffic whirring]

536
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,542
- Yes!

537
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,542
I don't know why
you think I'm not.

538
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,708
And all of a sudden,
now you're not.

539
00:24:33,375 --> 00:24:34,083
- Okay.

540
00:24:38,792 --> 00:24:39,583
Tell me why.

541
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,000
Talk to me.

542
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:05,625
[Ryan chuckling]

543
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:06,833
- We are different
people, but like not,

544
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:09,250
we're not heading
toward different things.

545
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,750
Like, baby, it's okay to
be different, but we...

546
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:17,125
- I don't know.

547
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,250
[Bleep], you're probably already
talking to him anyway.

548
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,625
[vape pen clinking]

549
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:29,625
- You're not? Okay.

550
00:25:29,625 --> 00:25:31,750
Then why all of a sudden
are you not happy?

551
00:25:33,792 --> 00:25:35,708
When did this happen
all of a sudden?

552
00:25:35,708 --> 00:25:39,625
When did you feel this
unhappiness? Tonight?

553
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,750
- No.

554
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,125
- Let's do marriage
counseling then.

555
00:25:46,708 --> 00:25:48,792
Let's go to, let's at least try.

556
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,250
Instead of just
throw in the towel,

557
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,500
let's at least try.

558
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:58,667
- I know, but I'm
saying together.

559
00:26:00,167 --> 00:26:01,625
I'm saying together.

560
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,917
We go in and we talk
about this together.

561
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,917
I don't want you to
make a rash decision.

562
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:11,792
- You make rash
decisions all the time.

563
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:14,542
All the time.

564
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,083
We were fine.

565
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:26,542
- The majority?

566
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,208
Like, right now, you're
having a bad day,

567
00:26:30,208 --> 00:26:33,083
so therefore, you're not
happy with this marriage.

568
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,667
Not every day is gonna
be hunky-dory, baby.

569
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,167
Marriage is hard.
Nobody said it was easy.

570
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,125
[soft emotional music]

571
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,667
There's gonna be days
where you're like,

572
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,000
"Oh, I just want a break."

573
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,750
Or, "Oh, I just wanna do this.

574
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,958
Oh, I just need to get away."

575
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,583
But you have to work at it.

576
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,333
- Okay, right?

577
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:00,125
And are you not wanting
to fight for this anymore?

578
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:05,125
[traffic whirring]

579
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,083
No?

580
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:12,583
[traffic whirring]

581
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,375
Okay.

582
00:27:15,375 --> 00:27:17,750
[vape pen clinking]

583
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,083
[car engine roaring]

584
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,750
- Yeah.

585
00:27:27,708 --> 00:27:30,833
[foreboding music]

586
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,167
[Ryan chuckling]

587
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,292
- Okay.

588
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,250
- [Ryan] Yeah.

589
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,083
[foreboding music continues]

590
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:06,000
[traffic whirring]

591
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,917
[Gypsy sniffing]

592
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:26,792
[traffic whirring]

593
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:37,333
[Ryan breathing heavily]

594
00:28:39,833 --> 00:28:42,958
[car door thudding]

595
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:48,292
[Gypsy sobbing]

596
00:28:48,292 --> 00:28:52,083
[foreboding music continues]

597
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,875
[car door thudding]

598
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,833
[troubling music]

599
00:29:07,792 --> 00:29:10,708
[Gypsy sobbing]

600
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,833
[crickets chirping]

601
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:19,167
[introspective music]

602
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:32,875
- You know, I just wish my
wife would stop doing this.

603
00:29:36,167 --> 00:29:39,208
[introspective music continues]

604
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:42,083
Being with somebody like
her, it happens a lot.

605
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:45,208
You know, I knew
her being released,

606
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:47,542
it would be hard
on her, you know?

607
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:49,083
But I mean, I know she loves me.

608
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,708
I mean, that's not
even up for debate,

609
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,417
but it's, like, my heart
just got ripped out.

610
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,417
And I have to pick
it up all the time,

611
00:29:58,417 --> 00:30:00,167
and I do it every time.

612
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,708
She feels cooped up,

613
00:30:03,708 --> 00:30:05,958
and she feels freer in
Cut Off on occasion.

614
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:07,417
And you know, of course,

615
00:30:07,417 --> 00:30:08,667
she felt free this last time.

616
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,542
It was a [bleep]
Disneyland trip.

617
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,375
Like, they go, and they
have all this stuff planned,

618
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:15,042
and they're gonna have fun
and [speaks gibberish].

619
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,500
That's not normal life.

620
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,083
But with me, it's a normal life.

621
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,000
And it's like, I don't know,

622
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,875
I guess she's still
stuck in fairytale world.

623
00:30:22,875 --> 00:30:24,375
I don't know.

624
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:26,625
Like, I've created this
life for her and all this,

625
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:31,208
and it's, I guess, it's just
not what she imagined, yeah.

626
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:34,542
And you know, I don't
know what else is at play.

627
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:39,125
You know, she still mentions
her ex from occasions.

628
00:30:39,125 --> 00:30:43,250
He continues to, like,
always is in the background.

629
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,542
And I'm like, "Are you talking?"

630
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:45,458
And she's like, "No."

631
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:47,417
And I'm like, "Okay."

632
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,125
And I have to believe that,

633
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:53,083
like, I can't think otherwise

634
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:54,542
'cause I'd go [bleep] crazy.

635
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:59,958
You know what I mean? Like,
I would go [bleep] crazy.

636
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,833
And then I'm the jealous
controlling one, you know?

637
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,375
It's just hard.

638
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:09,042
I mean, I don't wanna split up,

639
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:11,833
but I mean, it's not up to me.

640
00:31:12,958 --> 00:31:14,542
You know what I mean?

641
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:15,708
It's never been up to me.

642
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,083
[tense music]

643
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,958
It's her decision, you know?

644
00:31:20,542 --> 00:31:22,958
Like, she knows I'll
love her and always have.

645
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,458
[hopeful music]

646
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:32,875
All right. [sniffs]

647
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,250
[hopeful music continues]

648
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:44,625
[keys clinking]

649
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:47,583
[car doors thudding]

650
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:52,875
[Ryan breathing heavily]

651
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:56,417
[hopeful music continues]

652
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,542
[car engine whirring]

653
00:32:05,542 --> 00:32:08,375
[birds chirping]

654
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,000
[serene music]

655
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,917
- I packed an overnight bag

656
00:32:14,917 --> 00:32:16,667
so I can spend the
night with Mia.

657
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:20,792
Tomorrow night, Mom and I are
gonna go to the apartment,

658
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:23,125
gather some of my stuff,

659
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:25,375
and just spend the next
two weeks in Cut Off,

660
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:29,917
and see where my head's
out in two weeks.

661
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:35,042
- I think I'm probably
just gonna have space.

662
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,958
It's just ultimately I know that

663
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,833
I'm in a codependent marriage.

664
00:32:42,833 --> 00:32:45,375
I am in a codependent
relationship.

665
00:32:45,375 --> 00:32:48,375
When I went to hang
out with y'all in Cut Off,

666
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:51,292
he was feeling that
need to have me home.

667
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,250
So he has that
codependency to me.

668
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,500
Can't we-
- That was a task,

669
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,375
and I'm glad you, yeah.
- Have some healthy

670
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,292
level of boundaries?
- Boundaries?

671
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:05,875
- And independence
for the both of us?

672
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,458
[tense music]

673
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:14,875
- That Thursday night,

674
00:33:14,875 --> 00:33:16,333
we didn't have a good
night that night,

675
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:19,708
but we talked and then,
like, we kinda made up some,

676
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,042
and we went to bed.

677
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,542
And then I come
home the next day,

678
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:27,333
and she had, like, permanently
moved into the spare bedroom.

679
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,333
She's like, "I'm in
the spare bedroom."

680
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:32,083
And then next thing
I know, she was gone.

681
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,042
And I hadn't seen her since.

682
00:33:34,042 --> 00:33:35,875
And it's one of
those where, like,

683
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:38,125
she had never experienced
anything before.

684
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,042
You know, I knew being married

685
00:33:40,042 --> 00:33:42,000
would be hard for her, you know?

686
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,083
Like, but in my head,
I thought, like,

687
00:33:46,083 --> 00:33:49,000
her having a safety net,
somebody to rely on,

688
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,583
somebody to hold her at night,

689
00:33:50,583 --> 00:33:54,125
somebody to tell her it's
gonna be all right was good.

690
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,125
But other people

691
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,542
who have influence
didn't see that.

692
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:05,375
- What I'm getting
from all of this,

693
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:08,417
I mean, you went from one
prison to another prison,

694
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,917
and now, you're in
another one and-

695
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:12,000
- [Mia] I wouldn't
go that far, Mom.

696
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:15,750
- Well, I mean, she's
stuck in that house.

697
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,458
You have never lived

698
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,208
like you should have growing up

699
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,750
and now is your chance.

700
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:27,125
And he should remember that.

701
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:32,125
It seems like he wants the
Gypsy that was in prison,

702
00:34:33,208 --> 00:34:35,958
that was okay with him
that he stayed home

703
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,750
and all of this stuff.

704
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,375
- Not compatible.

705
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:42,083
You may love him
and he may love you,

706
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:44,542
but ultimately, when
it comes down to, like,

707
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:47,792
the things that obviously
y'all want in life

708
00:34:47,792 --> 00:34:49,250
are very different.

709
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:51,083
And how are you supposed
to be in a relationship

710
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,042
and live your life that
you've been so eager

711
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:55,583
to live if that's who
you're married to?

712
00:34:56,667 --> 00:34:57,875
- You know, I mean, yes,

713
00:34:57,875 --> 00:34:59,958
y'all have been
married, you know?

714
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,667
It's gonna be, you know?
- I'm coming up on two years.

715
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,333
- But y'all, to me-

716
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:05,208
- [Mia] It's been a few months.
- Y'all been married

717
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,250
just a few months.

718
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,542
- [Gypsy] Yeah.
- [Mia] To me too.

719
00:35:07,542 --> 00:35:10,583
- And now, you could
see the concern that me,

720
00:35:10,583 --> 00:35:12,542
and your sister, and all had.
- Yeah.

721
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:13,833
- [Kristy] You know,
like, go out and live.

722
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,542
- Yeah.

723
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:18,875
[depressing music]

724
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:23,000
- Gypsy's very impulsive,
but people influence her.

725
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,375
She's already an
impressionable young girl.

726
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:29,208
And to feed stuff in her
head, put stuff in her head,

727
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:33,708
I mean, it just
poisoned her marriage.

728
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,875
I know we still
have what we have.

729
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:38,208
And so does she.

730
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:42,708
That's why, I mean, I know her,

731
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:45,250
I know her family doesn't
want me to see her.

732
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,042
Where she's at, I would not be,

733
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:49,375
I would not feel welcomed.

734
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:53,000
I wanna show up, but
at the same time,

735
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,417
I wanna respect her family

736
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:56,875
'cause I've never done
anything wrong to them.

737
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,167
You know, the way they paint me

738
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:02,375
is I'm controlling and all this.

739
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:03,458
Well, if I show up there,

740
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,250
that fits their narrative more.

741
00:36:07,875 --> 00:36:10,375
It's just, it's sad.

742
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:13,292
I'm sad, sad over...

743
00:36:13,292 --> 00:36:16,375
[depressing music continues]

744
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:19,875
- I texted my PO,
and I asked him.

745
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:23,208
I'm like, "If I am not
happy in Lake Charles,

746
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:25,833
could I move in
with my parents?"

747
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,750
And he's like, "Yeah, I mean,
if you're not happy there,

748
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,625
I can transfer your case,
your paperwork, whatever.

749
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,750
to where your parents are."
- [Kristy] Yeah.

750
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:36,875
- You know, I thought I
could have been happy in

751
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,958
Lake Charles with Ryan,

752
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,875
but I also thought
that our marriage

753
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:43,542
would be a little different
than it actually is.

754
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:46,833
I've always been a people
pleaser my whole life.

755
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:49,542
And this is the one
time that I'm like,

756
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:53,292
"Okay, I'm gonna
take a step back,

757
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:55,667
and, you know,
reevaluate the situation,

758
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:58,042
and come back when
I have a clear mind

759
00:36:58,042 --> 00:36:58,167
and come back when
I have a clear mind

760
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:00,750
that this is honestly
what I want."

761
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:03,417
I'm not gonna say that
I'm getting a divorce

762
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:06,167
because I haven't made
that choice up yet,

763
00:37:07,542 --> 00:37:10,083
but I will say that the living
environment that I'm in,

764
00:37:10,083 --> 00:37:12,542
I can't get my mind right.

765
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,250
[contemplative music]

766
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,917
[car engine whirring]

767
00:37:20,917 --> 00:37:22,875
- 25 minutes to be there.

768
00:37:22,875 --> 00:37:23,750
- I let him know.

769
00:37:24,917 --> 00:37:25,750
- You did?

770
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,750
- Yeah.
- Okay.

771
00:37:30,583 --> 00:37:33,250
Or I could do it, you could
just hand stuff to me,

772
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,250
you know, come to the door,

773
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,250
hand that to me.
- Yeah.

774
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,750
I mean, honestly I
just wanna, like,

775
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,417
get the guitars to you.

776
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:42,750
That'll be the first
thing I can give to you.

777
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,417
- Yeah, I'm gonna let you
bring the big suitcase.

778
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:46,542
- Yeah, I'll get
the big suitcase.

779
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:50,083
And then I have a little
small list of stuff

780
00:37:50,083 --> 00:37:53,375
for you.
- Yeah.

781
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:56,250
[dramatic music]

782
00:38:00,292 --> 00:38:03,500
[hand brake creaking]

783
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:07,375
Dear Lord,

784
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:09,708
I'm asking You to give Gypsy

785
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:13,292
all the strength that
she needs to go in

786
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,875
and do what she needs to do.

787
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,750
Let it go calm.

788
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,292
Everything's gonna be
okay, Gypsy. [smooches]

789
00:38:19,292 --> 00:38:20,167
Jesus' name,

790
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,042
amen.
- Amen.

791
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:24,292
[dramatic music continues]

792
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:26,917
[keys clinking]

793
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,417
[footsteps plodding]

794
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:36,375
[light switch clicking]

795
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,792
Hey, baby girl. Hi, honey.

796
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:41,458
[Gypsy smooching]

797
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:43,833
Hey, honey. I know, girl, here.

798
00:38:45,708 --> 00:38:47,583
Yeah, Mom.
- [Kristy] His car's not here.

799
00:38:47,583 --> 00:38:48,792
- [Gypsy] He's definitely here.

800
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,500
[luggage bag zipping]

801
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,292
[clothes hangers clicking]

802
00:39:00,417 --> 00:39:02,542
- [Gypsy] This is all
my hanging clothes.

803
00:39:02,542 --> 00:39:05,042
- [Kristy] Gypsy,
there's a box right here.

804
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,708
[box clacking]

805
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,333
[Gypsy sniffing]

806
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:17,042
- [Gypsy] Man, I leave
the place for a little bit,

807
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,292
it goes to [bleep].

808
00:39:18,292 --> 00:39:20,542
- [Kristy] That's
what I just said.

809
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:23,083
- [Gypsy] That's
some of my clothes.

810
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:25,375
- Pix.

811
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,208
Pixie, Pixie.

812
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:30,000
[boxes clacking]

813
00:39:32,208 --> 00:39:33,333
- Yeah, that's it.

814
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,583
Oh, is that like...

815
00:39:38,208 --> 00:39:39,500
Okay.

816
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,708
I'm gonna go make sure

817
00:39:40,708 --> 00:39:42,583
that he's been
feeding her and stuff.

818
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:45,458
Okay, she's got food,
she's got water.

819
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:48,625
All right, other than
that, I think that's it.

820
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:51,250
- Jacket?

821
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,542
- Yeah.

822
00:39:52,542 --> 00:39:53,583
- [Kristy] And the guitars?

823
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,875
- Yeah.

824
00:39:54,875 --> 00:39:57,375
- Bring your white puffer
because you may need it.

825
00:39:57,375 --> 00:39:58,875
- [Gypsy] It might get cold?

826
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:02,333
- [Kristy] Yeah, you didn't
want your Saints jersey?

827
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,500
- No.

828
00:40:04,542 --> 00:40:05,792
- [Kristy] I'm just thinking-

829
00:40:05,792 --> 00:40:07,042
- It says Anderson on the back.

830
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:08,042
- [Kristy] Oh, that's true.

831
00:40:08,042 --> 00:40:10,083
- If change was comfortable,

832
00:40:10,083 --> 00:40:13,625
then I don't think anybody
would go through change.

833
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:16,833
It's just something
that you have to go

834
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:20,333
through the rough stuff to
get to where you belong.

835
00:40:20,333 --> 00:40:22,917
[Gypsy sobbing]

836
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:42,833
- I'm sorry, baby girl. [sobs]

837
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:46,333
If it's separation,
that's the one thing.

838
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:49,083
If it's a divorce,
that's another thing.

839
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:51,125
- [Kristie] Pixie, you're
making my heart break.

840
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:54,375
- [Gypsy] Oh, is it the
right thing? I don't know.

841
00:40:54,375 --> 00:40:56,542
Is it the wrong
thing? I don't know.

842
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:02,042
[door thudding]

843
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,167
[dramatic music]

844
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:05,542
He keeps texting me.

845
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:07,042
He's like, "Just tell
me you don't love me."

846
00:41:08,208 --> 00:41:09,417
And I'm like, "I can't tell you

847
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:10,792
I don't like."
- Yeah.

848
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:12,042
- [Rod] She made a
mistake marrying Ryan.

849
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:14,375
- Gypsy Rose Blanchard
and her ex-fiance

850
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,375
that she got
engaged to in prison

851
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:18,292
have gotten matching tattoos,

852
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,708
- Their matching tattoos
broke my heart.

853
00:41:20,708 --> 00:41:22,500
[Ryan breathing heavily]

854
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,000
- She needed to know the
real reason why he ended it.

855
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,917
- Did she?

856
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,375
- [Kristy] Yes,
she did because I-

857
00:41:28,375 --> 00:41:30,500
- He should have told
her that, not you.

858
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,000
- I want a divorce.

859
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,667
And in six to nine months,
I'm gonna be with Ken.

860
00:41:37,625 --> 00:41:38,917
I'm happy again,

861
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:42,583
and I don't wanna do
anything to mess it up.
