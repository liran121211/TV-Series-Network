1
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:03,875
- [Gypsy] This is
Ryan flipping out

2
00:00:03,875 --> 00:00:05,208
because I told my sister about--

3
00:00:05,208 --> 00:00:07,083
- No, you told the
world about it.

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,250
You're hovering.

5
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,375
Thank you.

6
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,958
I'm not gonna say
he's a hoarder,

7
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,333
but there's a lot of clutter.

8
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,875
- Just don't let her
talk (bleep) about me.

9
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,583
I know she's going to.

10
00:00:24,583 --> 00:00:25,833
- I don't see any issues.

11
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,375
- Well, it's a lot
of responsibility.

12
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:30,500
I'm not an idiot. I know
how to care for a dog.

13
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:33,542
- Who are you texting?

14
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:36,958
- I'm just texting my
sister, honey. Relax.

15
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,708
- I'm very relaxed.

16
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:43,250
- If I see that I am being
controlled, I'm leaving.

17
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,167
- What?

18
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:49,875
- Gypsy's first true
relationship was Ken.

19
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,583
- Something happens
with Gypsy and Ken,

20
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:53,750
it's gonna be your fault.

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,375
- For years, he never
gave me like an answer.

22
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:02,625
I went through like a
huge, like self-doubt.

23
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,708
I know that he is
interested in blondes.

24
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:07,542
I'm not blonde, I'm a brunette.

25
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:09,875
- It's important for
me to share my thoughts

26
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:13,000
and opinions on her, and the
time that we spent together,

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,042
and everything will
unfold as it should.

28
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,542
- [Gypsy] Woo!

29
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:19,583
- Captain Gypsy Rose.
[Gypsy laughing]

30
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,417
- I am kind of
rushing into things

31
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,792
and kind of like wanting to
do everything all at once.

32
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,333
You had an issue with Kristy,
you had an issue with Mia.

33
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,917
- Well, they question
our relationship.

34
00:01:27,917 --> 00:01:31,542
Am I wrong fighting for our
marriage? That's what I'm doing.

35
00:01:31,542 --> 00:01:32,833
- I miss Ken.

36
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:36,042
I have two men in my heart.

37
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:37,292
- Talking about me,

38
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:39,000
reaching out to me
right before her wedding,

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,458
phone conversations
that we've had since?

40
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,750
[tense music]

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,583
[gentle music]

42
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:04,375
- I'm obviously like a
little nervous about it

43
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,333
'cause I've never
been on camera before.

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,500
- Yeah.

45
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,333
- I'm sure Kristy's told her.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,708
- Why wouldn't I be?

47
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,750
[pensive music]

48
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:34,750
You know, Gypsy was never
Gypsy Rose Blanchard,

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,292
to me at least, you know,

50
00:02:36,292 --> 00:02:38,292
not after we got
to know each other.

51
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:41,333
She's just Gypsy,
just Gyps, that's it.

52
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,042
It's a long time
to think back to.

53
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:51,375
This is almost seven years ago.

54
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,000
When I wrote her the first time,

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,250
it wasn't because I was like
looking for a girlfriend.

56
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,417
I can't tell you what I
was thinking at the time,

57
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,458
at the age of 24, but like,

58
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,042
I just wanted to let her know

59
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,917
that you have support out here.

60
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,542
But she would get, you know,

61
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,417
hundreds of those kinds of
same letters all the time,

62
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,083
so I don't know why
she wrote me back,

63
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,500
but I'm happy she did.

64
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:19,958
And then that eventually
graduated to phone calls.

65
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,333
She started calling
me and I mean,

66
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:24,167
I would talk to her for
sometimes, like, no joke,

67
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:26,292
3, 4, 5 hours, you know?

68
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:30,500
We just connected
in a lot of ways.

69
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,375
You know, there
was kind of like,

70
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,083
not talked about maybe
lingering feelings in the air,

71
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:38,083
but it didn't really
come to fruition until

72
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,792
that first visit,
I would say, yeah.

73
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:41,292
You know, you can't wake up

74
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:44,042
and decide how you
feel about somebody

75
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,167
or how you connect
with somebody.

76
00:03:45,167 --> 00:03:47,792
Sometimes, it just
happens organically.

77
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:52,500
She's an incredible person.

78
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,208
I mean, she's one of the
sweetest people I've ever met.

79
00:03:56,917 --> 00:03:59,333
You know, back then I
would, I mean, even today,

80
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,625
I would have a very like,
overactive, overthinking,

81
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,917
like million miles a
minute racing kind of mind.

82
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,583
And Gypsy had a way of like,

83
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,792
kind of calming me down and
like centering me, again.

84
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,750
She was a huge, huge
part of my everyday life,

85
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,167
so cutting ties was extremely
hard and very difficult.

86
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,417
[gentle music]

87
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,417
[phone rings]

88
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:35,042
- [Gypsy] Hey.
- [Mia] Hey.

89
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,500
- [Gypsy] Did you
watch my video?

90
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,667
- [Mia] Which one?

91
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:41,917
- The videos that I sent you
last night or this morning?

92
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,208
- [Gypsy] Ryan had a
whole freak out moment.

93
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,500
- [Mia] Oh, Lord.

94
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,042
- He's like, "You had
to do it on camera?"

95
00:05:02,042 --> 00:05:06,708
and I'm like, I didn't mean
for it to be like on camera.

96
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:09,333
- [Mia] Okay.
- So there's that.

97
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,958
- [Mia] All right, I'll
text you about it.

98
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:11,875
- All right, love you.

99
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,750
- [Mia] All right.
Love you too, bye.

100
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,958
- I know you want some water.

101
00:05:19,958 --> 00:05:21,750
[water running]

102
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,750
What time we going
rock climbing?

103
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,958
- Four something.

104
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,542
- So who were you
on the phone with

105
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,000
when you were on
the balcony, Mia?

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,375
- Yeah.

107
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:37,875
- I'm sure you told her that
we had an argument, huh?

108
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,750
- Yep.
- Did you really?

109
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,708
- Yep.
- Why? It wasn't even that bad.

110
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,417
I love that you take
these little disagreements

111
00:05:44,417 --> 00:05:45,708
as like massive arguments.

112
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,208
- I didn't say
they were massive.

113
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,875
- Okay.

114
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:51,042
[tense music]

115
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,208
[birds chirping]

116
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:56,125
[chimes ringing]

117
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:59,375
- I think I feel
a little bit like

118
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:04,375
I haven't had a chance to
spend some time with Gypsy,

119
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:05,708
just me and her.

120
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:06,958
- I know, and that's the truth.

121
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,542
- I don't know how
to fit that in with,

122
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,208
you know, she's
real busy, I'm just--

123
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:12,417
- I mean, look.

124
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,000
- Trying to find a
time when we could

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,375
just kind of, just me and her.

126
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,375
- Well, you need to, you
need to tell her, B.

127
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,708
You need to have a
conversation with Gypsy.

128
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,250
- I'm trying to have a
conversation with you,

129
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,458
but you not letting me talk.

130
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,958
- [Kristy] I'm sorry, you
know, that's how I am.

131
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:25,792
- Yap, yap, yap.

132
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,833
- I know I'm that
way, but finish.

133
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,500
- I'm good.
- No, say what you wanna say.

134
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,083
- [Ron] No, I think
you got the point.

135
00:06:31,083 --> 00:06:32,667
- No, say it, say it.

136
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,042
- I said it, babe. I don't know.

137
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:37,042
I just feel a little
jealous, that's all I mean.

138
00:06:37,042 --> 00:06:38,208
- I get that.

139
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:40,375
- Of Ryan, of you.

140
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,500
Of, you know, all the media,

141
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,542
just all the things
she's got going on.

142
00:06:44,542 --> 00:06:47,583
I just feel like we haven't
had a chance and you know,

143
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,583
I haven't told her that, but I
don't want to tell her that.

144
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,250
- You have to tell her.

145
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,208
- But I don't know, I'll feel
guilty for feeling that way.

146
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:57,000
- You should not feel guilty,
Rod, because you were robbed.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,708
- Because it's just been so
crazy since she's gotten out.

148
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,125
We haven't really had that...

149
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:03,667
- Yeah.
- Look, I mean...

150
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:05,375
- I got tears in my
eyes because I'm hurt.

151
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,458
I feel bad for you.

152
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,583
- It's okay.
- I told Ryan,

153
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:11,833
"You've been waiting
for her for two years,

154
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,917
we've been waiting eight plus."

155
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,458
- Yeah.

156
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:19,708
I mean, I feel like I'm
being selfish about it.

157
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,833
- [Kristy] You have
every right to selfish.

158
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:25,875
- But I feel like I'm
worried about my happiness

159
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,042
and not hers.

160
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,458
The last thing I want
is to push too hard

161
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,667
and she draws away.

162
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,375
- [Ryan] All right, baby, you
ready to go have some fun?

163
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,875
- [Gypsy] Yes.

164
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,000
[gentle music]

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,083
- You got my wallet?

166
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,208
- Yeah, wallet.
- You excited?

167
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,292
- Yes.

168
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:47,208
[indistinct chatter]

169
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,708
Get up there.

170
00:07:50,708 --> 00:07:53,750
What keeps me drawn to Ryan

171
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,083
is he has a very
compassionate heart,

172
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:02,167
and he is able to
understand me emotionally

173
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:05,625
in a way that I don't feel like
a lot of people understand.

174
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,417
He loves me in a way
that nobody ever has,

175
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:13,167
regardless of how
many fights we have,

176
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:18,250
or the ups and the downs,
like, he loves me for me.

177
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,458
Love is always
worth fighting for.

178
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,292
- Look, we got this
whole spot. There you go.

179
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,458
- Thank you.

180
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,417
- Oh, it's delicious.

181
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:34,250
Are you super mad
at me for texting

182
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,958
that video to my sister?

183
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,250
- A little.

184
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,875
- Why?

185
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,542
- Because, babe, that video
didn't help the situation.

186
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:43,292
Does that make sense?

187
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:45,583
- I don't wanna do anything
that hurts your feelings.

188
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,792
- I know.
- Or hinders your

189
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,917
relationship with my family,

190
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:52,167
but anytime that
anybody has any sort

191
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:55,500
of reservations about
our relationship,

192
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,542
they're not in your
favor so much anymore.

193
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,792
You had an issue with Kristy,

194
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,042
you had an issue
with Mia, like.

195
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,667
- Well, they question
our relationship.

196
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm a prideful person.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,292
Like I don't butt into
their relationship.

198
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:08,458
- And it's coming
from protective.

199
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,917
- I understand that.

200
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,792
Baby, I have nothing against
Kristy. I call her mom.

201
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,333
I have nothing against Mia.

202
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,875
- You know, what's funny
is it's like, "I love them,"

203
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,625
but then you say all these
like, snarky remarks.

204
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,542
Like, "Yeah, Kristy just
loves the attention."

205
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:24,833
Like you said that
literally when we were

206
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,500
in the car waiting
to come in here.

207
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,375
- But I also joke
around a lot too.

208
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,708
- You do.

209
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,333
When I was 13, I went
through this phase.

210
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,875
My mom hated it.

211
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:39,208
Every little
sarcastic attitude is,

212
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,583
"Oh, you took offense to
it, oh, I was just joking."

213
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,000
It's like a fall back,
it's like an excuse.

214
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,000
Hi, thank you.
- Chicken nuggets.

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,208
- Thank you, oh,
these look delicious.

216
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,042
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Y'all need anything else?

217
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,167
- I'm good. Thank you,
Amanda. Thank you.

218
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:56,167
- Thank you.

219
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,583
[tense music]

220
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,375
- I guess I do
say snarky things,

221
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,875
but I'm joking when I say them,

222
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,042
and I am defensive when
people have talked (bleep)

223
00:10:05,042 --> 00:10:06,375
about our marriage
and everything.

224
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,708
Like, 'cause I
know what we have.

225
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,917
Like, am I wrong for feeling

226
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,750
like fighting for our marriage?

227
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,375
That's what I'm doing.

228
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,833
I'm an emotional person, I
wear my heart on my sleeve.

229
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,708
- [Gypsy] I know.
- And you know when I'm upset.

230
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,750
You know when I'm happy,
you know all that.

231
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,000
Like, I'm not
going to deny that.

232
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,500
I'll stop with the snide
comments. I'll give you my word.

233
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,875
I'll work on it.

234
00:10:34,292 --> 00:10:35,875
- I know how he is.

235
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,208
Okay, you say that
you're gonna, you know,

236
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,375
be a little bit more
open with my family.

237
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,958
Okay, let's wait and see.

238
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,417
It's nothing that you
can tell me right now.

239
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,042
It's not a promise you can make.

240
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,750
Let me just see if you
make good on what you say.

241
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,083
[pensive music]

242
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,958
- I like to get up
early in the morning,

243
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,708
put my teeth in
before Ryan gets up.

244
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:13,667
I'm comfortable around
him enough to be myself,

245
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,667
but we're still newlywed,

246
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:18,417
so I still try and
look good for him.

247
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,958
I only usually let the people

248
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:23,917
that I'm closest to
see this process.

249
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,250
My teeth is something

250
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,292
that I've always been
really insecure about.

251
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,167
I just don't feel
pretty without my teeth.

252
00:11:36,417 --> 00:11:37,667
Okay.

253
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:50,167
My mom told the dentist that
my teeth were chipping away,

254
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:54,083
and that I was
experiencing tooth pain.

255
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:59,167
So what they did was they
decided to extract my teeth.

256
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:04,167
Oh, this is when they
took the very first tooth.

257
00:12:07,042 --> 00:12:09,833
See how it started off
at one at the bottom.

258
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,042
I was given partials,

259
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:19,208
free partials from an
oncology dental clinic.

260
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,000
And they were free

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
because my mom told them
that I went through chemo.

262
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,958
What I remember is when the
dentist talked about extracting

263
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,792
my teeth, my mom
said, "Oh, it's fine.

264
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,250
She's not a vain child.

265
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,333
She's not concerned
with her looks."

266
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,667
[somber music]

267
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,708
Concern with my
looks was forbidden.

268
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,417
I couldn't be concerned
with my looks.

269
00:12:45,417 --> 00:12:50,750
So, I mean, when I look in
the mirror and I see my smile,

270
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,917
I mean, I see like
messed up teeth.

271
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:59,250
Like I don't see it as
a smile, it's imperfect.

272
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,208
It's not my choice.

273
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,750
Normal girls don't
have this going on.

274
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,417
Normal girls don't have
to wake up every morning

275
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:10,667
and go brush their teeth and
then take their denture cup

276
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:13,167
and put them in, take them out.

277
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:17,750
It's, um, it's sad.

278
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,750
[bright music]

279
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,750
- Hey, look at all
the toys you got.

280
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,250
You want your dragon?

281
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,875
[toy squeaks]

282
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:45,042
So Ryan won't be coming out much

283
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:47,875
'cause, you know,

284
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:50,083
he's been sick for
quite a while now.

285
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,750
- Oh, he needs to stay in there.

286
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,042
- [Gypsy] And like...

287
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,250
- He needs to rest.

288
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,208
- Yeah, there's this
giant rumor going around

289
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,542
that I'm pregnant just because--

290
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:00,875
- That's what I
was about to say.

291
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,208
- You know, and I don't
think that it should be okay

292
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:07,875
that people take pictures
of people at the hospital

293
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,708
and be able to post
them on the internet.

294
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,042
That's not cool.

295
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,542
- Yes, guys, the
speculation is on.

296
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,292
- Is Gypsy Rose pregnant?

297
00:14:17,292 --> 00:14:18,958
Well, apparently that's
what people are saying.

298
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,208
- They were caught visiting
a hospital together.

299
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,583
This is the picture of the
cake and the pregnancy test.

300
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,833
They've been telling people

301
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,333
that she might have
a bun in the oven.

302
00:14:30,542 --> 00:14:34,875
- Like you, we were literally
walking into the hospital

303
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:37,750
so Ryan could get
his chest X-rayed,

304
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,958
and they're saying that
they overheard me--

305
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,875
- Right.
- Say that I'm pregnant

306
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,875
and checking on the baby.

307
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,167
None of that was said.

308
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,375
And then like--
- Anything for attention

309
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:52,167
- Part of me wants to
dispel the rumors,

310
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,042
and the other part
of me is like...

311
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:57,375
- Because they live for
it. They live for a drama.

312
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,792
I'm not holding you.

313
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,792
- I'm gonna check
on Ryan right quick.

314
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,000
[tense music]

315
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,542
Can I get you anything?

316
00:15:07,542 --> 00:15:08,542
- [Gypsy] Okay, okay.

317
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,333
- [Gypsy] I love you.

318
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,292
Pixie.

319
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,833
- Wait, Aurora, wait, come here.

320
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:24,167
[pensive music]

321
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,583
- [Kristy] Pixie.

322
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,042
- Baby!

323
00:15:29,042 --> 00:15:30,542
- She's like, I wanna go play.

324
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:32,000
- Girl, come on.

325
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,542
- You wanna go swimming?

326
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,542
- Pixie does.

327
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,167
- No, Aurora, you're
not going swimming.

328
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:43,250
Me and dad were sitting
down and we were talking

329
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:49,375
and he said, "When's
my time with Gypsy?"

330
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:53,917
He wants that
one-on-one without Ryan.

331
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:58,167
He's hurt, he said he's jealous.

332
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,125
Dad doesn't want
to really tell you,

333
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,875
and I'm like, you
need to tell her.

334
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:07,042
- I mean, he could
tell me anything.

335
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:12,083
- He knows that the
way you were raised

336
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:17,083
was all under a
controlling thumb.

337
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,542
- Right.
- And he doesn't ever want

338
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:23,625
you to think that he
is controlling to you.

339
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,792
- I would never feel
that way about him.

340
00:16:25,792 --> 00:16:28,958
I mean, if he just told me--

341
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,125
- Exactly.
- How he feels,

342
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,000
I could implement
that into things.

343
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:39,083
My dad has never said anything
to me to make me think

344
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:44,000
that he was jealous of
the people around me

345
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,167
getting to spend time with me.

346
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:48,417
So it does kind of
shock me a little bit.

347
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,750
And even more so
that he doesn't feel,

348
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,458
I'm not gonna say
not comfortable,

349
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:58,500
but he has fears of letting
me know these things.

350
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,958
- I think he just feels like
he doesn't want to be her.

351
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:05,875
- And he's not.
- [Kristy] And he's--

352
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,458
- And he never will be.

353
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:08,875
- [Kristy] And that's
what he's scared about.

354
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,583
- But he's still
my dad and he needs

355
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,000
to learn how to be a dad.

356
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,833
- I just wanna thank
everybody that has continued

357
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,875
to support me
throughout my journey.

358
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:29,208
I know that there is quite a
few support, quite a few hate.

359
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,208
The hate doesn't bother me.

360
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,042
I'm pretty secure in
who I am as a person.

361
00:17:34,042 --> 00:17:37,208
And I just don't
let it get to me.

362
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:40,333
To all the supporters,
thank you, I love you.

363
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,708
To all the haters, no comment.

364
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:45,750
Because I'm not gonna
waste my time on you guys.

365
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,708
All right.

366
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:00,792
- So Gypsy, if I gave
you a magic wand,

367
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:04,083
what few things would you
change about your nose?

368
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,083
- The bump, and I just
want a more feminine slope.

369
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:11,708
I've been teased about
my nose for forever.

370
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,000
- [Surgeon] Yeah.
- And I hate the profile shots.

371
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,250
- It's mainly profiles, gotcha.

372
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,000
- And I just want a more
feminine looking nose.

373
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,917
- [Surgeon] You got it,
I'm gonna take a look.

374
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:22,125
- All right.

375
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:24,042
- Your septum's a
little off of the track,

376
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,708
but we can fix it,
take the bump off,

377
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:29,042
and then maybe lift your
tip up just a smidge.

378
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:30,958
I think that'll give
you a more feminine nose

379
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,000
and kind of let
everybody see your eyes

380
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,167
and not let the nose block you.

381
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:36,083
- Right, I can see
my nose from here.

382
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,167
Like, it's embarrassing.
- I know what you mean.

383
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,292
- She wanted to know
if you did two for one.

384
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:43,917
- Yes. Absolutely, that's
why I went to tag along.

385
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,375
- Perfect.

386
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,500
- When I was little, I got
teased 'cause of my nose.

387
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,042
But then, like now being
a public figure in a sense

388
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:55,167
on social media, it
doesn't help the fact

389
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,958
that I already had
this insecurity,

390
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,458
and then I have people calling
me The Nose on social media.

391
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:03,542
I am kind of rushing into things

392
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,708
and kind of like wanting to
do everything all at once

393
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,375
because I have that ability.

394
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,333
Like, okay, let's do
a massive makeover,

395
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,167
and make yourself the
best version of yourself,

396
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:17,375
so I could disassociate
from my past.

397
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,500
- So the first thing I
think we ought do is I think

398
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,375
we ought to shorten your nose
and tilt it up just a teeny bit

399
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:23,708
to make it a little
bit more feminine.

400
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:24,917
- Okay.
- Okay?

401
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,333
And now the next
thing we're gonna do

402
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,667
is we're gonna take
you a little bump down.

403
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,458
- Oh, wow.
- Wait, I need to look.

404
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,833
Wow.
- That's looks so much better.

405
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,458
- That is crazy.

406
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:38,208
- I think it looks, so if you
look at this picture, right?

407
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,625
You see the nose because
it's kind of overpowering

408
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,792
and it's like your eye
is always gonna be drawn

409
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:44,667
to the thing that's
a little different.

410
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:47,375
So if you look at this
picture, you see your eyes,

411
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,625
because the nose
basically goes away.

412
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,917
- [Gypsy] Right.

413
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,083
That looks so nice.
- I know.

414
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:56,458
- I'm like, wow, it
looks so different

415
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,542
and it looks so feminine

416
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,500
and like it doesn't
look ugly anymore.

417
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,833
- We kind of have to
work with what we have.

418
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,292
- I'm gonna look like
a different person.

419
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,583
So yeah, I wanna schedule
the surgery like ASAP.

420
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,125
If could do it
today, I would do it.

421
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,333
Thank you.
- Good seeing you.

422
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:15,500
- Thank you so much.
- Awesome seeing you.

423
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,208
- Nice to meet you.
- See you next?

424
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,750
- Hopefully.
- [chuckles] All right.

425
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,292
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you so much.

426
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,542
- You're welcome.

427
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,958
- It looked good.
- I looked.

428
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,417
- So are you nervous at all?

429
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:28,042
Like being that you've had
so many surgeries before

430
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:32,583
and this is like your first
one on your own accord?

431
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:35,417
- I mean, this is a surgery
that I'm choosing to have.

432
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:38,750
This is a surgery that I've
been looking forward to having.

433
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:41,708
So no, not really.

434
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,667
Every other time it was to
take something away from me.

435
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:46,875
This is to give
me something, so.

436
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:49,125
- [Kristy] Yeah.
- It's a little different.

437
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:51,333
[pensive music]

438
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,875
Well, the times that
like Ryan's at work,

439
00:20:56,875 --> 00:21:00,417
like in the morning, it's
kind of like I do my thing,

440
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:03,083
I get my texts outta the way,

441
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,250
but then by three o'clock

442
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,417
when it's quitting time, oh,

443
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:09,125
I'm ready for him
to come back home.

444
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,292
- Yeah.
- I'm like, I miss you.

445
00:21:10,292 --> 00:21:11,792
I'm ready for you
to come back home.

446
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,375
- Right.

447
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,708
It's good to miss him.

448
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:19,250
- And then that's a sign
to me that I'm like,

449
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,208
this marriage is good, you know?

450
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:28,042
But couple days ago I
went to the bedroom,

451
00:21:28,042 --> 00:21:29,708
woke Ryan up.

452
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:32,375
I said, I need to
tell you something.

453
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,750
He's half asleep.

454
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,625
I said, I miss Ken.

455
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,625
- He must have woke up quick.

456
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:44,875
- He did, and he was like,
"You need to let that go.

457
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:48,042
You need to let him
go. You are married."

458
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,750
And I'm like, I know I am,

459
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,875
but I think that we both
need to come to terms

460
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:57,417
with the fact that I
have two men in my heart

461
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,417
and he's still
there in my heart.

462
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,042
It was the day before
Valentine's Day too.

463
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:11,542
Not only did I call Ken two
weeks before the wedding,

464
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:16,500
but the conversation
that Ken and I had,

465
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,042
I was honest with Ryan about it.

466
00:22:20,042 --> 00:22:24,958
I asked Ken, I said, if you
don't want me to get married,

467
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:28,083
then you need to tell me now.

468
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,833
- And what he told you?

469
00:22:29,833 --> 00:22:31,500
- And he told me that,

470
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,875
"I want you to do
what makes you happy.

471
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,167
I think you should wait."

472
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:39,792
But he didn't say,
"Wait for me."

473
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,708
If he would've said,
"Wait for me..."

474
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:48,583
- You would have, I
know you would have.

475
00:22:52,542 --> 00:22:55,917
- Do you wish that Ryan
would've done what Ken did?

476
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,833
Not in leaving me, but
waiting to get married.

477
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:01,750
- Yes, yes. I will not
hesitate with that answer.

478
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,625
And y'all knew that I
wanted y'all to wait.

479
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,083
- Yeah.
- You know,

480
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:11,167
I wanted you to get out and
live and try new things,

481
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,958
and see if it was really real,

482
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:16,875
and that you weren't
holding onto a pipe dream.

483
00:23:16,875 --> 00:23:18,042
- Yeah.

484
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:21,042
The what could have been
with Ken weighs on my heart,

485
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:24,667
and I can't allow myself to
dwell on what could have been.

486
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,833
- It'll drive you insane.

487
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,917
[tense music]

488
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:37,042
[pensive music]

489
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:42,208
- It wasn't that I had like
fallen out of love with her,

490
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:44,875
or I didn't care about her,
or that I met somebody else,

491
00:23:44,875 --> 00:23:47,583
or it wasn't any
of those things.

492
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,625
There were a lot of
people that were kind of

493
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:54,333
in my ear about what our
relationship was doing

494
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:58,042
for her and how it was affecting
her in a negative context.

495
00:23:58,042 --> 00:24:03,042
I felt that I was hindering
her from self-development.

496
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,167
That was what ultimately
led to our separation,

497
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:09,417
and in hindsight, I didn't
realize at the time,

498
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:10,917
I mean, it makes
so much sense now,

499
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:14,708
but like when somebody is
kind of codependent like that,

500
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,375
and I would say that
Gypsy definitely was,

501
00:24:16,375 --> 00:24:19,417
that that role is just gonna
be fulfilled by somebody else.

502
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,250
That she had reached
this new platform of fame

503
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,750
that she now has hundreds

504
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,042
of people writing her
with ill intentions.

505
00:24:27,042 --> 00:24:28,375
Sure, I mean, I don't know.

506
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,500
You know, but a lot
of them I don't trust,

507
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,958
and that's what happened,
like almost immediately.

508
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:41,625
- No, I wasn't supportive of
any of her other relationships.

509
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:45,750
And I've seen interviews that
she's given talking about me

510
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,125
that she was
devastated, you know,

511
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,542
and that it was hard for her.

512
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,708
And I mean like even
just small components,

513
00:24:51,708 --> 00:24:55,417
like her reaching out to me
right before her wedding,

514
00:24:55,417 --> 00:24:57,875
and phone conversations
that we've had since.

515
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,458
- No.

516
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:14,500
- The last time Gypsy and
I spoke was right before

517
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,875
she got outta prison.

518
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:20,417
I made the decision that I
thought was best at the time

519
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:21,792
in the environment that I was in

520
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:24,125
and the people that
I had in my circle.

521
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:27,792
You know, I can't do
anything to change it,

522
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:31,417
but all I can say to her now
is that I really honestly hope

523
00:25:31,417 --> 00:25:32,792
that you have real
joy in your life,

524
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:34,042
and I'll always defend you,

525
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:38,250
and I just hope that
you get everything

526
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,583
that life has to offer.

527
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,917
[gentle music]

528
00:25:44,958 --> 00:25:47,917
- I'm gonna be
right back. Oh yeah.

529
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:51,625
You think daddy has
a treat for you.

530
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,292
That's not for you.

531
00:25:53,292 --> 00:25:54,375
You wanna come sit down?

532
00:25:54,375 --> 00:25:55,625
- [Ryan] Yeah.

533
00:25:58,083 --> 00:26:00,708
You had your appointment
with the doctor.

534
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:02,708
How was it? Like,
do you like him?

535
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,958
- Yeah, he was very nice.
It went really good.

536
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:07,542
I scheduled it for
April 5th and they said

537
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:12,208
that recovery time
I'm looking at,

538
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,167
you know, six, eight weeks.

539
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,750
- I mean, that's a
lot on your body.

540
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,542
You know, you're
messing with your teeth

541
00:26:20,542 --> 00:26:23,250
and this, I mean, is
there any other work done

542
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,875
that I need to know about?

543
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:27,333
- I mean, not like
surgical work,

544
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,125
but I wanna get my
hair done again.

545
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:30,208
- Not what I meant.

546
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:34,000
Baby, that's real blonde.

547
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,542
- Yeah, I want it to actually
be like super noticeable.

548
00:26:36,542 --> 00:26:38,208
- So you're gonna
get a nose job,

549
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,875
you're getting your teeth done
and your hair's gonna change.

550
00:26:39,875 --> 00:26:42,000
You're not even gonna be my
wife anymore. Like who are you?

551
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,667
- I am gonna be your wife, I'm
just gonna look super hot.

552
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:46,250
- You already there.

553
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,708
- You might feel that way,
but I wanna feel that way.

554
00:26:50,708 --> 00:26:52,667
- I just hope it doesn't
change your looks up too much.

555
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:54,333
I know you're gonna
look beautiful.

556
00:26:54,333 --> 00:26:55,958
- I hope it changes a lot.

557
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,125
- It's hard for me sometimes

558
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,417
to think about all these
changes 'cause it's like,

559
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:05,708
"Well, is it gonna change how
she perceives everything?"

560
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,750
You know, it's just
one of those like,

561
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,208
you just don't know, you know?

562
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:13,708
Like somebody could see
themselves in a different light

563
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:15,542
and be like, "Well,
I'm better now.

564
00:27:15,542 --> 00:27:16,917
I could do this instead."

565
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:19,750
You know, like it's
just one of those like,

566
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,292
I have to be self
secured myself,

567
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:24,125
knowing that these changes
won't change her as a person.

568
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:31,375
[gentle music]

569
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:41,042
- Right now, I think that I
am at a point in my evolution.

570
00:27:41,042 --> 00:27:44,708
I'm trying to figure out
what the future holds for me.

571
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:47,708
This is the phase where
I'm analyzing my life.

572
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,125
So much of like why Ryan and
I have had a lot of issues

573
00:27:55,125 --> 00:27:59,458
with breaking walls
down, trust walls,

574
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,625
is because of the
breakup with Ken.

575
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,792
With Ken, I was an open heart,

576
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:08,333
open mind and then I got hurt,

577
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:12,208
and so my baseline to enter
into my relationship with Ryan

578
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,625
was still coming from
a place of healing.

579
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,875
So going into it,

580
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:20,875
I was already mistrusting
of relationships.

581
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:34,417
I have silver crowns
on all my back molars.

582
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:36,208
Two of them have fallen off.

583
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:44,083
I like the the blonde
coming from the root.

584
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:45,417
- Okay, so no more shadow root.

585
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:46,667
- Right.
- Okay.

586
00:28:46,667 --> 00:28:49,583
- I don't think I
express my affection

587
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,667
in the way that he deserves

588
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,625
because there is that
little part of me

589
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:55,875
that is still so
broken over Ken.

590
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,083
[tense music]

591
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,500
You know, part of me wonders

592
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,583
had I just waited and stayed
single after Ken broke up

593
00:29:06,583 --> 00:29:10,833
with me to see what would
happen later, but I didn't.

594
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,000
I went to a rebound
as soon as I could

595
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,250
because I was hurting.

596
00:29:16,875 --> 00:29:19,500
I love Ryan, I'm
in love with Ryan,

597
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:25,250
but Ken had unlocked
something inside my soul.

598
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:31,917
Oh my God, they look so good.

599
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:37,250
Definitely different.
Cute, I like it.

600
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:39,875
I know he's gonna like it too.

601
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,000
- [Ryan] Hey, Pixie Pix.

602
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,375
Hey, baby.

603
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:53,375
- [Gypsy] Hey.

604
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,625
- [Ryan] Oh, let's see.
- [Gypsy] Hey Pixie.

605
00:29:56,625 --> 00:30:00,542
- Oh wow, oh my God.

606
00:30:00,542 --> 00:30:02,625
- Looks very
different, doesn't it?

607
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:06,042
- Oh wow, it's cut too.

608
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:08,167
- You like it?
- I love it.

609
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:10,542
- You like it?

610
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:13,750
- I do. Look at that, baby.

611
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,417
- Four hours in the chair.

612
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,000
- Is blonde. I thought you
weren't gonna go all blonde.

613
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,500
- Well, it's blonde so.

614
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,375
- It looks good.
- Thank you.

615
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:25,958
How was your day at work?

616
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:29,333
- Good, look at that.
- Yeah.

617
00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:32,708
- You look so good.
- Good girl. Hey baby girl.

618
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,458
- Oh, you ain't
gonna sit with me?

619
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,875
So I can look at you?

620
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:40,042
- There you go. Did she
poop skidoo anywhere?

621
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:43,167
- I didn't see anything.
You got a cut too, huh?

622
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:44,500
- Yeah.
- You didn't go short

623
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,542
like you wanted?

624
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,125
- No, I mean like
I told her that

625
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,750
I wanted just like an angle cut.

626
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,042
- Looks good.
- [Gypsy] Thank you.

627
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:55,083
- You look so good. Yeah,
you changing all of you.

628
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,375
You ain't gonna be
my wife no more.

629
00:30:56,375 --> 00:31:00,125
- I am too. I just look
a little different.

630
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,792
- You look a lot different.

631
00:31:01,792 --> 00:31:03,875
Did you ever think
you'd ever go blonde?

632
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:05,417
- I mean, maybe.

633
00:31:05,417 --> 00:31:08,083
- Like really blonde, not
like reddish blonde or?

634
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,042
- I mean, I wanted to.

635
00:31:10,042 --> 00:31:12,208
- I know, but like...
- I don't know.

636
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:15,333
- Looking now in the mirror,
do you like notice like...

637
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,708
- Oh yeah, I can see
that it's blonde, yeah.

638
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:20,500
- Okay, did she put any toner
in? Is it gonna get lighter?

639
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,000
- It has toner. Yeah.

640
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,250
- So it will get lighter?

641
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,542
- Mm-hmm.

642
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:25,958
- You look just different.

643
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:30,875
Did you miss me today?

644
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,375
- Yeah.
- No, you didn't.

645
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,667
- I almost fell asleep in
that chair. I'm not gonna lie.

646
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:38,750
- You showed anybody, you
took a picture of anybody?

647
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,042
- Yeah?
- Really?

648
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:42,042
So I'm not the first
person to see it.

649
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:44,500
- Well, you are the first
person seeing the person.

650
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,458
- Well, I'm not the
first person to see it.

651
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:48,125
- [Gypsy] No.
- Who'd you send a picture to?

652
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:50,333
- My dad and Kristy.

653
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,000
- What'd they say?
- [Gypsy] They like it.

654
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,625
- Yeah, your boyfriend like it?

655
00:31:54,625 --> 00:31:57,042
[Ryan laughing]

656
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,417
He did? Good.

657
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,000
Just joking.

658
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:07,292
What you think,
Pixie? You like it?

659
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,875
[pensive music]

660
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:21,917
- I think that there is that
wall of guilt between me

661
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:24,500
and my dad that we both
have been putting bricks

662
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,583
on it and adding to it.

663
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:30,792
I think instead of keep
on piling on the bricks,

664
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,667
we need to start
taking them down.

665
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:46,208
- You know, it was asked of
me to stay in Lake Charles

666
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:48,583
and let her parents have
Gypsy for the weekend.

667
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:54,500
It did hurt not
being asked to come.

668
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,375
It's not one of those
things I'm mad at,

669
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,208
but I have to bite my tongue,

670
00:32:58,208 --> 00:33:02,042
I have to walk that thin line
of I can't be controlling.

671
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:04,417
I can't be this,
I can't be that,

672
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:05,708
Like I have to be,

673
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:08,167
I have to be aware of
her trauma and her past.

674
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,708
So, I mean, it's a tough
road to walk, but it's okay,

675
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,542
'cause I chose it.

676
00:33:12,542 --> 00:33:14,625
[gentle music]

677
00:33:21,042 --> 00:33:23,583
- You know, being able to show
Gypsy all of this stuff.

678
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:26,208
It's, you know, it's all
about culture down here.

679
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:27,792
This is our blood.

680
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:30,125
I mean our roots go
really deep here.

681
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,250
I just wanted to give her
a taste of some of this.

682
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,958
Get some mud between her toes.

683
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,208
So the way you do it,
just grab the rope,

684
00:33:37,208 --> 00:33:38,417
make sure the
rope's not tangled.

685
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,750
- Okay.
- Drop it like that.

686
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,958
- All right.

687
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:45,500
- Stand right there. I'm
gonna tell you when, okay?

688
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
- All right.

689
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:51,250
Woo! [laughing]

690
00:33:52,958 --> 00:33:55,375
I do that to everybody.
You're initiated.

691
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:57,667
- That's what I was gonna say.

692
00:33:57,667 --> 00:33:59,125
I'm like, that's my initiation.

693
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,667
- Perfect. Good job.

694
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,000
[gentle music]

695
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:10,250
Cool.

696
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,542
- Ooh!

697
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,375
- So come up and drive.

698
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:16,125
- Oh my God.
- Get right here.

699
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,125
- Woo!

700
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:29,542
[laughing]

701
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,792
All right, let me take over.

702
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:39,542
- All right, go ahead.

703
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,042
Okay.
- Okay. Pull it up fast.

704
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:50,583
Come on. Big crab, big crab.

705
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,083
- They took the bait.

706
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,458
- [Rod] Took the bait?
[laughing]

707
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,542
God, Gypsy, you ain't worth
(bleep) at crabbing, girl.

708
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:57,542
- Hey!

709
00:34:59,417 --> 00:35:03,583
I think we both feel
a mix of emotions.

710
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,167
Like at times, you know,

711
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,417
I feel like I don't
always know what to say.

712
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:13,167
I don't know if it's just like
that comfortability level.

713
00:35:14,542 --> 00:35:19,042
It comes from like, wanting
to have a dad in my life,

714
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:20,667
and I just don't
wanna do anything

715
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,625
or say anything
that'll screw it up.

716
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,042
- [Gypsy] Woo!

717
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:31,375
- [Rod] Put it right
here. Tie it to this.

718
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:35,458
All right, we'll leave
them there 15, 20 minutes.

719
00:35:37,125 --> 00:35:39,542
So I've noticed you took down

720
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:41,875
a lot of your social
media and everything.

721
00:35:41,875 --> 00:35:44,583
- Yeah, like, I'm
seriously considering like,

722
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:48,083
just deleting at least
like the public ones.

723
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:51,875
It's just like, it doesn't
mean anything for me

724
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:55,000
to have a bunch of strangers
comment on my life.

725
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,083
- Yeah.
- And it's not worth it either.

726
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,042
- That's good, it's
good to hear that.

727
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:01,750
You can't win all those battles.

728
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,542
Everybody's gonna have
opinions, some good, some bad,

729
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,583
but then you try
to defend yourself

730
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:10,292
and then you're spending
so much mental energy

731
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:13,458
on stressing out about this
when you don't have to.

732
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:15,583
- Yeah.
- It really doesn't matter

733
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,375
as long as you're
good with, you know,

734
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:21,500
your family and the
people that that matter.

735
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,042
- And I don't wanna go
through my whole life being,

736
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,375
you know, Gypsy Blanchard,

737
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:29,542
the girl that
murdered her mother.

738
00:36:32,542 --> 00:36:37,958
- I don't want people
to look at you like,

739
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,833
this is Gypsy
Rose, she's famous.

740
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,542
- [Gypsy] I don't either.
- For killing her mother.

741
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,083
You shouldn't be famous
for something like that.

742
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:44,375
- Exactly.

743
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:47,708
I hate that that F-word, famous.
- Mm-hmm.

744
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:51,167
- Like, do I think
I'm famous? No.

745
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,958
- This is Gypsy Rose,
she survived this,

746
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:56,375
and went through
this, but, you know,

747
00:36:56,375 --> 00:37:00,083
I'd rather be like that
then, you know, she's famous.

748
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,958
- So that's why I'm just like,

749
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,667
I really just wanna fade back.

750
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:08,542
- The way she analyzed
how social media

751
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:11,542
and was affecting her and
all this negative stuff,

752
00:37:11,542 --> 00:37:13,375
it reflects a lot
on her maturity

753
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:14,875
and I'm real proud of that.

754
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:19,583
[screams]
- Two crabs, yay!

755
00:37:19,583 --> 00:37:21,792
- Yes, yes!

756
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,750
[Rod laughing]
Success!

757
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:38,458
This guitar was my dad's
guitar. It's a good guitar.

758
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,500
[guitar playing]
Sounds great.

759
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:44,667
So you can use it as long
as you try to play it.

760
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:45,625
- I will.

761
00:37:46,542 --> 00:37:47,792
For the first time in my life,

762
00:37:47,792 --> 00:37:51,042
I have an actual dad
to teach me things.

763
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,583
- This is a pick.
- Okay.

764
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,792
I'm starting to
learn his personality

765
00:37:54,792 --> 00:37:58,375
and get a sense of
who he is as a person.

766
00:37:58,375 --> 00:38:00,042
He always just
wants my happiness,

767
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:01,917
and that's what I've learned.

768
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:03,667
- And this 12th note.

769
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,375
[guitar playing]

770
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:08,333
- My dad is the one that
named me Gypsy Rose.

771
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:10,125
I never knew that
because my mom told me

772
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:13,458
that her and my
grandma had named me,

773
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:14,875
and he's like, no,
you're Gypsy Rose,

774
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,208
because I'm a fan of
the band Guns N' Roses,

775
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,167
and I'm like, I didn't
know that. [laughs]

776
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,708
[guitar strums]

777
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,417
- Hold on. Okay, try again.

778
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,417
See? See how that feels?

779
00:38:27,417 --> 00:38:29,042
- Yeah.
- You got a feeling in it.

780
00:38:29,042 --> 00:38:30,208
You're feeling it
with the words.

781
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:31,750
- Yeah.
- Okay. So that's one chord.

782
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,458
- Oh, wow.
- It's one chord song.

783
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:37,333
- I guess I should be on my
own two feet at 32 years old,

784
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:40,167
but in a lot of ways
for experience wise,

785
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:44,417
it's like I'm back being 12,
16 years old all over again.

786
00:38:44,417 --> 00:38:45,417
All right.
- Good?

787
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:47,208
- Oh my God. Okay.
- It feels high?

788
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,375
- It feels really high.

789
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,458
You're around the
people that you love

790
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:51,625
and if they're
teaching you something,

791
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,792
it's like a flashback to a time.

792
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:58,292
So it's almost that I'm
catching up on those memories.

793
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:01,083
Ooh.
[laughing]

794
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,750
- I've missed so much that it's
a little hard to catch up.

795
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,208
We just want to enjoy that
and I'm so happy to have that.

796
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,750
So blessed now.

797
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,375
- I got a wedgie!
[laughing]

798
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:15,417
- Turn the way you fall.
[laughing and yelling]

799
00:39:15,417 --> 00:39:17,458
- (indistinct) a Band-Aid!

800
00:39:17,458 --> 00:39:19,958
- Aw (bleep), that
ain't nothing, girl.

801
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,083
Your first bike crash.

802
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,458
It ain't gonna be your
last, don't worry about it.

803
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,333
[phone rings]

804
00:39:32,708 --> 00:39:33,875
- Hey.

805
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:39,875
- Oh, I'm about to eat some
crab and some crawfish

806
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:41,958
and some shrimp.

807
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,458
- Not right now, honey.

808
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,000
- How was your day?

809
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,000
- Good? What'd you do?

810
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:01,208
[laughing]

811
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:06,583
- Me and dad went crabbing
and we caught three crabs.

812
00:40:07,958 --> 00:40:09,042
- Yeah, that's it.

813
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:14,958
- But you got the
pictures I sent you?

814
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,125
- Thank you.

815
00:40:25,042 --> 00:40:26,667
- I'll video you later.

816
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:31,125
- Like who?

817
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:36,583
- All right, well I gotta go.

818
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:40,875
[tense music]

819
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:47,875
- Sometimes it's actually really
nice not to have him around.

820
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,542
Ryan and I are having
an argument right now.

821
00:40:53,542 --> 00:40:55,125
This is what he said.

822
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:58,708
- [Ron] "Could really give a
(bleep) about your dad's..."

823
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,500
Well, to me that's
a big red flag.

824
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,625
- It is a red flag.

825
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,333
- Baby, that is revenue.

826
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:05,417
- If all you care about
is (bleep) money.

827
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:07,083
- Baby.

828
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:08,250
(bleep).

829
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,542
Will you remarry me?

830
00:41:09,542 --> 00:41:11,167
- Can we not do this on camera?

831
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:14,875
Sometimes I just think
that I would be happier

832
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,792
somewhere else.

833
00:41:16,792 --> 00:41:21,208
- You have never lived
like you should have.

834
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:22,833
[indistinct whispering]

835
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:25,583
[Gypsy crying]
