1
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:05,917
- She is going home today,
but she is not free yet.

2
00:00:05,917 --> 00:00:07,167
- [Ryan] We're being followed.

3
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,208
[Gypsy grunts]

4
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,792
- [Gypsy] I am concerned.

5
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:11,458
Is paparazzi gonna follow us
all the way back to our home?

6
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:16,083
- We consummated our marriage.

7
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:18,667
A lot of people felt

8
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,417
I should have waited
in getting married.

9
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,542
- It's a lot of responsibility.

10
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:24,500
- That's the kind of [bleep]
that you tell a child.

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,875
Like, it's a lot of
responsibility, you know?

12
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:28,042
Just please don't treat me

13
00:00:28,042 --> 00:00:29,667
like I don't know
what I'm doing.

14
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:32,500
If we don't get on that flight,

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,542
we don't do "Good
Morning America."

16
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:35,750
[somber music]

17
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,667
There's so many people.

18
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:39,917
- [Ryan] Quickly.

19
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:41,708
- Am I at risk for
dangerous people?

20
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,000
- Gypsy!
- Come our way.

21
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:44,708
- [Paparazzi] Gypsy.

22
00:00:44,708 --> 00:00:46,208
- I was engaged once before.

23
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,792
Ken texted my stepmom.

24
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:51,375
He's sniffing around to try
and break me and Ryan up.

25
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:55,083
If you're not gonna be there
at my worst, you do not

26
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,250
deserve me at my best.
- Deserve me at my best.

27
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:00,500
[somber music]

28
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,167
[calm music]

29
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,708
- [Ryan] You know,
it's been nice

30
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,250
just me and you being here.

31
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,375
- [Gypsy] It's been nice not
having to do anything either.

32
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:18,667
- I love that you took up for
me last night on social media,

33
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,542
although it created
some drama, you know?

34
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,625
But you know I don't
listen to them yahoos.

35
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,458
- I know.

36
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,458
I'm trying to be really smart

37
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,250
with my social media right now.

38
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,875
I feel like everything
I do is on a microscope.

39
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:33,667
I posted one comment and
it's blowing up right now

40
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,458
on all the media channels.

41
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:39,167
- Gypsy Rose
Blanchard clapped back

42
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:42,042
against haters in her
husband's Instagram comments.

43
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:44,083
- "They jealous because
you are rocking my world

44
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:44,958
every night.

45
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:45,958
Yeah, I said it.

46
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:47,875
The D is fire."

47
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,000
- I'm sure after the many years

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,458
that Gypsy Rose was in prison,

49
00:01:50,458 --> 00:01:53,208
she is very happy to
be getting that D.

50
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,500
- Oh my God.

51
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,875
- What?

52
00:01:57,875 --> 00:02:00,708
- Gypsy Rose Blanchard, my
hubby gets it every night.

53
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,667
- Oh, you never said that.

54
00:02:02,667 --> 00:02:04,708
- I never said that.

55
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,542
Well actually on a low
key way, I did say that.

56
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,000
- You did, you did

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,458
now that I think about it.
- A low key way.

58
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:11,375
Oh, my God.
- You did and now

59
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,542
that I think about you said,

60
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:14,375
"He's rocking my
world every night."

61
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:17,375
You did.
- Oy.

62
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:20,167
- Oy.
- We're newlyweds.

63
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:22,167
It's not like we're, you know,

64
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,875
not human.

65
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,167
- [Ryan] I know, but damn.

66
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,625
- You know who's
probably seeing this [bleep]

67
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:33,625
and getting so mad?

68
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,792
Hehe, my exes.

69
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:35,833
I love it.

70
00:02:37,292 --> 00:02:39,542
- [Ryan] Don't even get
me started on them, baby.

71
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:41,125
[Gypsy laughs]

72
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:43,583
- Ryan was getting quite
a few negative comments

73
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:45,708
and they were being
very ignorant.

74
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,667
I feel a sense of
responsibility to defend him

75
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,250
because he's coming
into this with me.

76
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,500
We're experiencing
this whole whirlwind

77
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,375
of social media
attention together.

78
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,417
I want him to know
that he's not alone.

79
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:59,250
- Look, I got strips or nuggets.

80
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,083
I got either one for you.

81
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,917
I'm gonna start
packing some, you eat.

82
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:07,250
- Ryan and I are
going to New York City

83
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,708
to do interviews.

84
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,333
A little bit nervous
about all the press

85
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,958
that we have planned out for it.

86
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,167
- All right, so I got my pants.

87
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,875
I am about to throw

88
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:21,417
in my undershirts in there.

89
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:24,583
- I'm only packing
what we gonna wear.

90
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:26,625
We're not packing
our whole life.

91
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,250
- [Ryan] Speak for yourself.
- I know you want to.

92
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,208
- Speak for yourself.

93
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,667
Fine.

94
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,708
Fine baby, fine.

95
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:39,375
This is my first trip with
my wife leaving our home.

96
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,583
So it's like our
honeymoon in a way.

97
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,042
- [Gypsy] I'm nervous.

98
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:45,583
- I am too.

99
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:48,667
- I'm more nervous about the
PO meeting than New York.

100
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,250
- [Ryan] Well, it's
understandable.

101
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,250
- I'm about to go and
see my parole officer

102
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,250
in the state of Louisiana
for the first time.

103
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,792
It's actually pretty important.

104
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,417
I wanna make a good
impression with him.

105
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,583
I wanna like let him
know that like...

106
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,375
- [Ryan] You are gonna be great.
- I hope he knows

107
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:08,542
that I'm not some stuck
up, fame crazy person.

108
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:11,833
He kind of decides
where I can go,

109
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,125
what I could do,

110
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:14,708
my restrictions and everything.

111
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,458
So this is just the
first official meeting.

112
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,083
I just wanna be on
the real road with him

113
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,208
and be like, listen,
I left Kansas City

114
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,333
because they said to
and I didn't wanna

115
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,500
jeopardize anything.
- Right, we did exactly

116
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,708
what they asked.
- I was a responsible inmate.

117
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,875
I'm a responsible person.
- We did exactly

118
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,458
what they asked of us there.

119
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,333
- [Gypsy] I know that my PO
probably has been reading

120
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,542
a lot of the stuff that's
being put out by tabloids.

121
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:42,458
So I just really kind of
wanna put it out there that,

122
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,458
listen, I came out of prison
just wanting to live my life.

123
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:47,917
- Baby, I'm gonna carry,

124
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:50,250
remember what I told you about
carrying one load of clothes

125
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,542
in your carry on, right?

126
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,583
- [Gypsy] Yeah, you got your
blood pressure medicine?

127
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,250
- [Ryan] Yep, I got everything.

128
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,917
- Just making sure.

129
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,000
- Booyah, baby.
- Good job.

130
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:04,417
My freedom is at the
forefront of my brain 24/7.

131
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,292
Literally my biggest fear
is going back to prison

132
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,792
for another year and a half.

133
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,292
All right, we're on our way.

134
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,458
- [Ryan] This is one meeting
we cannot be late for.

135
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,708
- I'm nervous.

136
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,167
This appointment
is very important,

137
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,292
above all else.

138
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:23,542
- [Driver] All right.

139
00:05:23,542 --> 00:05:24,917
- I mean I've talked
to plenty of people,

140
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:28,750
parole officers,
institutional parole officers.

141
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,333
- But I just don't like how
they intimidate inmates.

142
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,500
- Yeah, they do it a
weird way in prison.

143
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,667
- Here it is.

144
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,625
- All right, we made
it in good timing.

145
00:05:40,333 --> 00:05:42,708
[intense music]

146
00:06:02,125 --> 00:06:03,875
- This is bull [bleep].

147
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,583
Of course I'm nervous.

148
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:05,542
My wife's in there.

149
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,250
I don't know what's going on.

150
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,583
So I'm hoping that
there's no issues

151
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,583
and she gets her travel permit.

152
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:12,958
I don't know what we would do.

153
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:15,583
[intense music]

154
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,875
All right, we gots to go.

155
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:25,583
I had to do like a whole
questionnaire, paperwork.

156
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:28,000
- All right, you can tell
me all about it in the car.

157
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,458
I'm worried about the flight.

158
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:30,542
We're like two and
a half hours away.

159
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:31,625
So we just gotta get there.

160
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,542
- [Gypsy] Yeah, okay.

161
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:35,375
- How'd that go?
- It went really good.

162
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,708
- You were taking so long,

163
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,542
I thought you were in
there squalling, like.

164
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:43,583
- No, they had to do hand
prints, fingerprints, DNA.

165
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,792
- Damn, baby.

166
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,708
They say try to
keep a low profile?

167
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,833
- Just more like be
aware of what you do,

168
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,000
what you say.

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,625
Like if I take a selfie

170
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:56,208
and there's a vodka
bottle in the back of me,

171
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,333
you don't wanna give anybody
any reason to nitpick

172
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,208
and then report back
to him or to Missouri.

173
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:04,458
Be like, oh yeah, there's
a vodka bottle in the back

174
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,333
and here's the proof.

175
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:06,917
- Let me ask you this,

176
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,875
does he have control over
you now or does Missouri?

177
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,375
- They both do.

178
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,875
I'm being supervised by
two different states.

179
00:07:16,542 --> 00:07:19,500
[intense music]

180
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,458
- Man, this say arrival, 7:42.

181
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,000
[bleep] we're cutting it close.

182
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,750
- Damn, we are cutting
it close, boss.

183
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:32,958
[phone rings]

184
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,333
- Hello?

185
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,667
Oh, okay, hi.

186
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,917
- [Rep] You need to
make this flight.

187
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:39,208
- We need to stuff
everything in our carry-ons

188
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,542
'cause if we don't
make this flight,

189
00:07:40,542 --> 00:07:41,542
we don't arrive till six-

190
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:43,375
- Baby, I can't.

191
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,708
Like we have to check.

192
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:49,833
- If we have to, we
will leave our...

193
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:51,833
- No, I have to have it.

194
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,500
Like, baby, we got
one set of clothes.

195
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,417
Like what do they
- I know.

196
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:55,750
- want us to do?
- I know.

197
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,042
All right, we're gonna
do the best we can.

198
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:58,750
- Okay.
- No, we're not.

199
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,958
- All right, I will.
- No, we're not.

200
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,000
- Okay, bye.

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,625
- Baby, no we're not.

202
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,583
- Okay, here's the situation,

203
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,417
if we don't get on that flight,

204
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:08,875
we don't do "Good
Morning America."

205
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,500
- I understand, but we're
gonna get on the [bleep] flight.

206
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,208
All my clothes are in my bag.

207
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,625
My meds are in my check bag.

208
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:15,917
You get what I'm saying?

209
00:08:15,917 --> 00:08:17,708
- Well, then that's
why you put your meds

210
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,125
in your car-
- [bleep] [bleep] whatever.

211
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,125
- I'm just the messenger.

212
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,708
- Gate C's this lane, bud.

213
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:27,292
Gate C's over here.

214
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,458
Other lane boss.
- [Driver] Okay, okay.

215
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,708
- [Ryan] You better
get in another lane.

216
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,042
- [Driver] Yeah, yeah, gotta go.
- He's got it.

217
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,208
Quit badgering the man.
- [Driver] Says C

218
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,542
to the right.
- Yeah,

219
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:36,667
that's what I'm telling you.

220
00:08:36,667 --> 00:08:38,875
[Gypsy groans]

221
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:42,542
- This is the most stressed
out I've been in a while.

222
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,667
- Zoom around this [bleep].

223
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,375
- What did I say about language?

224
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,042
- What did I say about language?

225
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:48,292
- Sorry.

226
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,833
- Oh my God, we have
to make this flight.

227
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,833
He has everything.

228
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:02,750
[clock ticks]

229
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,250
- Gypsy Rose Blanchard has
now done her first interview

230
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,625
since getting out of prison

231
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,167
and it was with "Good
Morning America."

232
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,542
Ryan joined her on this,

233
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,833
but one of the takeaways
that I got from this

234
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,333
was the fact that she has stated

235
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:16,000
she is now becoming the woman
she's always wanted to be.

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,125
- When asked if this was
her happily ever after,

237
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:19,750
she said quote,

238
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,833
"It is, I had to kiss a couple
frogs to get to this one."

239
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,667
And then she leaned
in, kissed his face,

240
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,458
and said, "Handsome face."

241
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:28,167
[intense music]

242
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,208
- [Ryan] Baby, I love our view.

243
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:37,583
- I know, it's so beautiful.

244
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:39,500
- Like, we don't even have
to leave the hotel room.

245
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,542
We can just hang out
in New York like this.

246
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,708
- That was insane.

247
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,500
We were late to the airport.

248
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,667
Her PO meeting took
longer than we,

249
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:51,250
than it should have.

250
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,042
And we were like, oh God, are
we gonna make this flight?

251
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:57,833
- He started getting nervous
and he started freaking out.

252
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,000
And then I'm just kind of like,

253
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,708
I'm just the
messenger right now.

254
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,208
Like, don't freak out on me.

255
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,375
- I was mad.

256
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,708
I was throwing my
luggage basically.

257
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,250
But Gypsy calmed me down.

258
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,750
To me it was like, baby, focus.

259
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,833
And I was like, okay.

260
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,667
And it's kind of cool
when she freaks out,

261
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,417
I'm the calm one and
then when I freak out,

262
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,375
she's the calm one.

263
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,375
- So what are these little jars?

264
00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:18,292
- [Makeup Artist] Concealer.

265
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:19,125
- Concealer?
- Yeah.

266
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,208
- My mom didn't like
want me to wear makeup.

267
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,292
She didn't even want
me to wear lip gloss.

268
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,792
- Mom restricted everything.

269
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,250
Couldn't even wear blue jeans.

270
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,833
[sad music]

271
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:36,208
- It is kind of polar
opposites, honestly,

272
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:40,958
where I was in prison,
restricted, hardly any makeup,

273
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,625
and now I'm getting all glammed
up and I'm in New York City.

274
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,000
Kind of like I've stepped
in the twilight zone.

275
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,292
And then like the
attention on social media,

276
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:53,708
like I'm not used to it at all.

277
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,417
And so right now, I think
there's a huge adjustment

278
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:58,750
that needs to happen.

279
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:01,250
It's like, is this my life?

280
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:07,875
[lively music]

281
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:15,167
- So baby, you excited to
go shoot at "The View?"

282
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:16,167
- I'm nervous.

283
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:19,000
- Baby, you got this.

284
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,958
- I came out of prison just
wanting to live my life

285
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:26,667
and all this media attention
is not something that I said,

286
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:28,375
hey, I wanna be famous.

287
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:31,542
It's just, it's happening
whether I like it or not.

288
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:33,542
- Gypsy.
- Come our way.

289
00:11:33,542 --> 00:11:35,750
- So there's our security.

290
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,375
- No selfie.

291
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:42,708
- Pressed for time.

292
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:44,542
- Yup, no time.
- All right.

293
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:45,667
- Okay, come out on this side.

294
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,625
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- How are you?

295
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,833
- [Ryan] Is there
a restroom in here?

296
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,167
- There's a private
restroom in there.

297
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,375
- Thank you so much.

298
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,208
- [Producer] Gypsy, there's
a little gift for you

299
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:09,083
on the table.

300
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:09,917
- Awe.

301
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,208
Oh my goodness, I
wanted one so bad.

302
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,875
I watched the show and
I was like, oh my God,

303
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,250
I hope I get a little mug.

304
00:12:20,375 --> 00:12:21,208
Thank you guys.

305
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,417
This is awesome.

306
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:24,375
This is gonna be in
front of a live audience.

307
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,167
So part of me is scared

308
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,000
that my brain is just
gonna shut off and be like,

309
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,708
focus all on the people.

310
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,375
So I can stutter
when I'm nervous.

311
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,875
So I just hope I don't stutter.

312
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,250
- [Ryan] You got this, babe.
- Yeah.

313
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:45,458
- [Ryan] Haters gonna hate.

314
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,542
Let 'em hate
- Right.

315
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:48,458
- because I mean,
I'm that awesome

316
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,375
when I pulled this.

317
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,667
So, you know, it is what it is.

318
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,250
Yeah, no, but I love
that she did comment.

319
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,667
Come to my defense.

320
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:56,542
I love that she's willing.
- I'm a tiger.

321
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,042
- Yeah, she's [Ryan growls],

322
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,167
she gets you.
- I'll get you.

323
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,208
- [Ryan] She'll maul your face.

324
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,625
- Not literally.

325
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,167
[audience applause]

326
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,958
- So Gypsy Rose Blanchard made
worldwide headlines when she

327
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,708
was convicted of orchestrating
her mother's murder.

328
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,042
[intense music]

329
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,958
- I don't wanna be
remembered as the girl

330
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,417
who killed her mother.

331
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:20,375
I'm always gonna struggle
with wanting my privacy,

332
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:22,167
but also wanting a voice.

333
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,875
[audience applause]

334
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,042
- Please welcome
Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

335
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,542
You were released from
prison just a week ago.

336
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:32,708
- Yes.
- How are you doing?

337
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,708
- Well I'm doing great.

338
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,958
I'm in New York City
for the first time.

339
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,042
I know I am enjoying my freedom.

340
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:40,917
I'm taking it day by day.

341
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:44,042
But with the massive amount
of platform that I have,

342
00:13:44,042 --> 00:13:45,667
you know, the 6 million
followers

343
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,667
on Instagram and TikTok,

344
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,542
I really wanna get
into advocacy work.

345
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:54,083
You know, if there is someone
out there watching right now,

346
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,208
please listen to
me, heed my words

347
00:13:56,208 --> 00:14:00,042
that you are not alone in
this, you know, situation.

348
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:01,625
There are other ways out.

349
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,958
I did it the wrong way.

350
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:04,958
You you know?
- [Joy] No, no, no, no,

351
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,250
don't say that.

352
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,083
- But I did.

353
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,333
- [Joy] You had
no choice really.

354
00:14:08,417 --> 00:14:09,958
- I did something wrong
and I paid my dues for it.

355
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,000
- [Joy] Oh, you mean that part?
- Yes, the part of it.

356
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,708
- Oh yeah.
- You know, that part of it.

357
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:13,875
- Never mind.
- Where are you going

358
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,042
with this story?
- No, no, no, no.

359
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,875
You know, so I did something-
- Murder is wrong, Joy.

360
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,000
- Yes, murder's wrong.

361
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,542
[lively music]

362
00:14:23,542 --> 00:14:24,708
That was so good.
- Was it good?

363
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,667
You do all right?

364
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,208
- They were so nice.

[paparazzi chatters]

366
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,083
- No time, we got places to go.

367
00:14:38,542 --> 00:14:39,792
Thank you, we love y'all.

368
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:40,958
We love you.

369

- Possible.

[Gypsy giggles]

371
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:48,208
Probable, possibly when I say

372
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,375
possibly.
- Possible or something.

373
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,625
[Gypsy laughs]

374
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,917
- Possible.

375
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,083
You did so good, gimme a kiss.

376
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,167
So proud of you.

377
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,875
- That went a lot smoother
than I like was preparing for.

378
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,042
- You looked so good up there.

379
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:05,250
Like, I was like,
that's my wife.

380
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,167
I kept telling the audience,

381
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,917
y'all realize that's my wife.

382
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:10,083
- [Gypsy] Okay, so we
just have a podcast.

[lively music]

384
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,083
- Go ahead, sweetheart.

385
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,375
- Gypsy, how are you?
- Hello, hi.

386
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,583
it's nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

387

So nice to meet you.
- Ryan.

388
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:24,125
Nice to meet you, buddy.
- So nice to meet you.

389
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,542
This is my fiance, Natalie.
- Hi, hi.

390
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:28,583
It's nice to meet you.
- Right on, I love that.

391
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,708
- Thanks, man.
- It looks good.

Hey, I'm Ryan.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

[lively music]

395
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:39,958
- Gypsy, welcome to
"The Viall Files".

396
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,375
Congratulations on being out.

397
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,542
- Thank you.
- We're very excited

398
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:43,417
to be with you.

399
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:44,375
- Thank you.

400
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,083
- What has this
been like for you

401
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,333
since being released for prison?

402
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,792
- You know, it's a
bit of a little bit

403
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,375
of a whirlwind for me.

404
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,500
I never expected to have such
a big social media following.

405
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,792
So I'm kind of like,
okay, I have a voice now.

406
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,125
I'm free, it's my turn now.

407
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,333
- Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

408
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,083
- It's cool watching
everything unfold

409
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,917
because it's just
like, you know,

410
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:09,208
I have to like pinch myself.

411
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:10,417
Like, while during
"The View" I was like,

412
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:12,542
you know, I'm actually
married to this woman.

413
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:15,042
Like, in my head I'm
like, that's my wife.

414
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,083
Like, can you believe that?

415
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,333
Like, that's my
wife right there.

416
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,833
It's surreal.

417
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,208
I love that she picked me.

418
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:23,125
- Do you have a
desire in the future

419
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,917
to kind of disappear or go away?

420
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:29,667
- I've always had a very
love hate relationship

421
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,333
with the media and the
attention from all of this.

422
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:33,542
- [Nick] No, that won't go away.

423
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,958
- That's actually, I
was engaged once before.

424
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,417
- Mm-hmm. To Ken.
- Yeah, to Ken, yeah.

425
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:41,250
And we were together
for two years

426
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,625
and then our engagement
was announced

427
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,125
and he is a very private person.

428
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,333
And so he didn't
like the attention.

429
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,542
And so I attributed him
breaking off the engagement

430
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:56,917
and breaking my heart and
devastating me to the fame.

431
00:16:56,917 --> 00:16:59,375
So that made me hate it

432
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:02,583
and then seeing how
I've been welcomed,

433
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:05,958
that makes me at least
feel more comfortable

434
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,875
in being who I am.

435
00:17:07,875 --> 00:17:09,708
- Well now that you're married,

436
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:10,750
should we bring him in here

437
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,667
and get to know Ryan
- Yes, yeah.

438
00:17:11,667 --> 00:17:12,917
- a little bit?

439
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:13,750
All right, let's do it.
- Let's get him in here.

440
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,792
- [Nick] Get in here, Ryan.

441
00:17:14,792 --> 00:17:15,667
- [Gypsy] Come sit next to me.

442
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:20,917
- All right Ryan, we have to
ask you, how is your heart?

443
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:22,250
- It's been a
rollercoaster ride,

444
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:23,708
but I'm enjoying it.

445
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,542
This fame thing is so new.

446
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:27,583
It's kind of overwhelmed
me in a sorts of like,

447
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,625
I didn't realize it'd
be as big as it is.

448
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,042
You know, she's always been
worried that I was gonna leave

449
00:17:32,042 --> 00:17:33,667
for the fame, you
know, because of it,

450
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,917
because of past relationships.

451
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,417
And I've told her that
I'm not going anywhere,

452
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,292
- You know, being
open and honest

453
00:17:38,292 --> 00:17:40,708
around the day that
I got outta prison,

454
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:42,083
Ken texted my stepmom.

455
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,583
- [Natalie] Ah, stop
- And she told, yeah,

456
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,250
she told me about
it and I'm like,

457
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,042
oh, so now he wants
to come around.

458
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,167
oh, so now he wants
to come around.

459
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,708
So I told Ryan about it.
- [Natalie] Yeah.

460
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:54,042
- I was open and I'm like, you
know, he's sniffing around.

461
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,708
[suspenseful music]

462
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,083
- Ken texted my stepmom.

463
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:03,208
- I don't like him at all.
- And he was like,

464
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,708
hey, what's up?

465
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,458
- Why do you think he decided
it's time to pop back up?

466
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,167
- Because I think now I'm free

467
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:14,333
and I don't think that he
has respect for my marriage.

468
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,500
- Well, he doesn't like me
'cause I've called him names.

469
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,250
- Names.
- Like I have, you know,

470
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,375
he's known as something to me.
- Yeah.

471
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,000
- I don't see why
you should like him.

472
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,875
- Yeah, yeah.
- I call him a dumb mother,

473
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,042
you know?
- Yeah.

474
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:27,958
- Beep, beep, beep, beep.
- So every time I-

475
00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:28,708
Every time that like-
- You can swear

476
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,000
on the podcast.

477
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,750
- He's reached out to me before.

478
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,208
- Has he?

479
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:36,208
- Well, actually Gypsy has
like asked me to text him.

480
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,042
- He still has my stuff.
- Apparently he has

481
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:39,417
stuff of hers
- Like he has stuff of mine

482
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:40,792
- that he like holds.
- like old pictures and stuff.

483
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,833
I've asked him to just
ship my stuff to my stepmom

484
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,375
and then I can get it from her.

485
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,875
And he's like, no, you know,

486
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,417
I still have all that
stuff, but like, you know?

487
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,167
- [Natalie] You can come get it.

488
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,417
- You can come get it.
- You can come get it, yeah.

489
00:18:52,542 --> 00:18:54,042
- You know, if he's sniffing
around to try and like,

490
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:55,583
break me and Ryan up

491
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:59,958
or see if I will leave
Ryan to get back with him,

492
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,875
this is how I feel about it.

493
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:05,708
If you're not gonna be there
at my worst, you do not

494
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,583
deserve me at my best.
- Deserve me at my best.

495
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,333
Okay.
- Yeah, that's right.

496
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:13,708
- And if you know anything
about Gypsy's Instagram

497
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,000
and you've seen the
recent comments,

498
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,125
she's not going anywhere.

499
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,625
- I'm glad.
- Turns out the D

500
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,000
is fire.

501
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,125
- Come and get it, baby.

502
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,375
- He's missed his chance.

503
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,875
It is what it is.

504
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,667
[calm music]

505
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,792
- Good, trying to figure out...

506
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,542
Is there like a secret
to this or something?

507
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:38,667
- Should I wear my
black shoes with this

508
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,417
or my brown one?

509
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:40,917
I'm a wear my brown though.

510
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,375
- Brown shoes look good.

511
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,833
- Okay, well I got
a black jacket.

512
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,458
That's the only problem.

513
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:47,875
And a black scarf.
- It's just warm.

514
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:48,917
- Okay.
- All right.

515
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:49,792
So what are we gonna do?

516
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:50,625
We just go and go walk?

517
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:51,958
- Yeah, let's go
to Times Square.

518
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,667
[lively music]

519
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,167
This is the first chance
we've had to walk New York,

520
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:04,875

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,792
very bad behavior
by allowing someone

695
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,792
who helped take
someone else's life

696
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:29,333
have such a massive
platform right after prison.

697
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,667
[sad music]

698
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,000
- I've been looking
at my DMs more

699
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,750
and I will have at
least 10 death threats.

700
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,208
This person said, "You
stupid waste of space.

701
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:56,667
Wait until you are cancelled

702
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,708
by real people that
ruin your life.

703
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,125
You are going to wish that
you were back behind bars.

704
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:04,542
I can't wait to be a part of
tearing you down bit by bit.

705
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,667
You deserve nothing but
to be six feet under

706
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,375
or locked away forever.

707
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,667
There are real kids with
cancer and real life problems,

708
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,875
unlike you that just
went along with it

709
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:16,042
because mommy told you to.

710
00:27:16,042 --> 00:27:18,167
You poor excuse
for a human being

711
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:20,542
and I wish nothing
but the worst for you.

712
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:23,125
You attention-
wanting whore self.

713
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:26,042
You deserve nothing good and
I will make sure I'm a part

714
00:27:26,042 --> 00:27:28,000
of making your
life a living hell.

715
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,625
Go to hell. Go hang
yourself [bleep]."

716
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:37,250
I understand that a lot of
people are upset right now

717
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,542
because I came out of prison

718
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:42,875
and the first thing
that I was jolted into

719
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,833
was this sense of fame.

720
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,458
What happens if I get a hater

721
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:50,333
that is a little too
comfortable with how they feel

722
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:54,208
and they come up to me and punch
me or get physical with me?

723
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:57,708
You know, that is a
dangerous situation.

724
00:27:57,708 --> 00:28:00,083
When the backlash comes,

725
00:28:00,083 --> 00:28:02,833
am I at risk for
dangerous people?

726
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:12,167
[calm somber music]

727
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:17,417
- [Ryan] You excited to
eat my mom's cooking?

728
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:19,542
It's really good.
- Yeah, yeah.

729
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:20,542
This is gonna be great.

730
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,833
- [Ryan] This is gonna be great.

731
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,292
[Gypsy chuckles]

732
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,042
[car door slams]

733
00:28:26,042 --> 00:28:26,750
Hey.

734
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,167
- Hey.
- Hey.

735
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:30,125
- [Gary] Y'all made it.
- We made it.

736
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,333
- [Ryan] We match.

737
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,625
- I cooked for the first time,

738
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:36,208
my first real well
semi-real meal by myself.

739
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,208
- [Joy] Tell me.

740
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,125
- So it was just a
Nora pasta side.

741
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:40,458
I'm playing on my
phone, you know,

742
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:42,042
checking Instagram and whatever.

743
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,542
All of a sudden, [Gypsy
imitates crackling]

744
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:45,667
it like, no.

745
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,333
- [Joy] It overflowed?

746
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,625
- It started foaming.

747
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:50,792
I thought I was gonna
set the house on fire

748
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:51,875
my very first try.

749
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:52,875
- She sure did.

750
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:55,083
She come running out, ahh.

751
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,208
- Smile.

752
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,750
There we go.

753
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,792
Oh, that's a cute picture.

754
00:29:01,792 --> 00:29:02,875
- Oh, that's a good one.

755
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:04,625
- That's a good one.
- Let me see.

756
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:05,542
- [Gypsy] You want
me to send it too?

757
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:07,708
- Oh, it is good.

758
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:09,208
- I only take cute pictures,

759
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:10,500
[Gypsy laughs]

760
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,250
despite what the
haters online say.

761
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,417
- I feel like I want to
engage on social media

762
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:18,792
because it's new
to me, it's fun.

763
00:29:18,792 --> 00:29:21,708
I'm showing my life
to my followers.

764
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:25,583
I'm not doing anything that
anybody else wouldn't be doing.

765
00:29:25,583 --> 00:29:27,792
But everybody wants
to find a negative

766
00:29:27,792 --> 00:29:29,083
in something that I do.

767
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,167
- [Joy] Y'all ready to eat?

768
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:33,542
- [Ryan] Mom, this
looks delicious.

769
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:34,500
Where are you sitting me, baby?

770
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,417
- Right here.

771
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:36,375
- [Ryan] Okay, sweetie.

772
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,500
- Next to me.

773
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,875
[calm music]

774
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:44,417
This is delicious.

775
00:29:45,667 --> 00:29:46,958
- I love it.

776
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,542
We're gonna cook this at home.

777
00:29:48,542 --> 00:29:50,042
- Yeah, right.

778
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:51,833
That's why I was telling you
we got that exact chicken.

779
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:52,625
[phone vibrates]
- [Joy] Did you see those

780
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:54,208
stuffed potato?

781
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:56,708
- That's my boss,
I gotta take this.

782
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,542
[intense music]

783
00:29:58,542 --> 00:29:59,750
Hey, what's going on?

784
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:05,792
- [Ryan] Yes ma'am, yes ma'am.

785
00:30:05,792 --> 00:30:07,250
That's when I plan
on coming back.

786
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:14,167
[intense music]

787
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:18,333
- [Ryan] I was worried
about my kids' parents,

788
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:22,042
how did they feel and
that was my main concern.

789
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,083
Well trust me, we got our
hand slapped for that one.

790
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,792
So no worries on that.

791
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:27,708
I understand.

792
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:28,917
All right, thanks, bye.

793
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,208
- [Gypsy] Everything okay?

794
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,375
- Yeah, she just
wanted to touch base,

795
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:33,083
see if I was coming
back on Tuesday

796
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:36,250
and she thanked you for the
D is fire comment by the way.

797
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,708
[Joy laughs]

798
00:30:37,708 --> 00:30:39,708
- Yeah, she thanked
you for that one.

799
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:44,500
But she said they've had one
negative call from a parent

800
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,250
and if she's like, you're
kind of the celebrity

801
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,375
of the school now.

802
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:50,083
So one teacher thinks
I'm not coming back.

803
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:52,792
She thinks I'm too famous and
I'm like, y'all are crazy.

804
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:55,583
[Joy laughs]

805
00:30:55,583 --> 00:30:56,958
I'm like, I need my job.

806
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,083
- [Gary] Yeah, you
wanna keep your job.

807
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:08,208
- I have to ask her first
if she wants to, but...

808
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,333
- You were trying to get
her to do it the other day.

809
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,625
- Oh.

810
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,708
- Well she's the prettiest
girl in school, I like her.

811
00:31:13,708 --> 00:31:16,250
[Joy laughs]

812
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,625
- [Ryan] Zoom in a little bit.

813
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,708
- Maybe I should
take my hair down

814
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,458
because this is going
on my Instagram.

815
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,208
So I gotta look good.

816
00:31:22,208 --> 00:31:23,417
[Gypsy giggles]

817
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:27,125
I would love to
just kinda be free

818
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:31,375
to not care what people think.

819
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:34,500
But I'm in a position where
even the littlest things

820
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,708
that I do are being scrutinized.

821
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:39,208
The negative comments make
me feel like I can't be

822
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:42,042
my authentic self
on social media.

823
00:31:42,042 --> 00:31:43,833
Your nose is too big,

824
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:45,875
you look fat, you're ugly,

825
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:47,667
you're a killer,
you're a murderer.

826
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:50,750
There's only so much that
someone can take of that.

827
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,875
I like this one way better.

828
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:53,167
- I like this one.

829
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,333
- [Joy] Let me look at it.

830
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,167
Lemme see it, lemme
see it, lemme see.

831
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,500
- You'll be the judge.

832
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,000
[calm music]

833
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:09,750
- [Ryan] You excited?

834
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,708
Check out our wedding venue.

835
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,208
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

836
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:15,667
Or a potential wedding venue.
- A potential.

837
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:18,958
Right, potential being the word.

838
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:21,042
Ryan and I got married

839
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:25,333
and the ceremony was not
the ceremony of our dreams.

840
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,417
We just wanna have something
that we can invite everybody

841
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:29,375
that we care about
and that loves us.

842
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:32,417
And so we're looking
at wedding venues.

843
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,542
Slidell, that's
where I used to live.

844
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:38,458
Tulane, that was my hospital.

845
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:40,875
- [Ryan] Uh-huh.
- Yes.

846
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:42,417
- [Ryan] Oh gosh.
- That was one of

847
00:32:42,417 --> 00:32:45,458
my hospitals, Tulane
Medical Center.

848
00:32:45,458 --> 00:32:46,708
- [Ryan] Oh wow.

849
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,458
- This bridge looks familiar.

850
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:50,750
- [Ryan] The bridge?

851
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,083
[Ryan and Gypsy laugh]

852
00:32:53,083 --> 00:32:54,625
That bridge looks familiar.

853
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:57,250
That stop sign looks like
something I would talk to.

854
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,583
- [Gypsy] Very funny.

855
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:00,750
I'm having deja vu.

856
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,000
- [Ryan] That bridge
looks familiar.

857
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,625
All good baby, I'm glad.

858
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,500
- [Gypsy] Coming
back to New Orleans,

859
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,750
you know, it brings
back a lot of memories.

860
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,833
It's like you're
coming back home.

861
00:33:11,833 --> 00:33:13,417
The houses look so beautiful.

862
00:33:13,417 --> 00:33:15,208
- [Ryan] Isn't
that cool looking?

863
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,042
You excited?
- Yeah.

864
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,583
- [Ryan] Degas
House, it's this one.

865
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,708
- Ryan and I got married

866
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,375
and it was by a bathroom.

867
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,667
- Yeah, I mean it was,
it was the visiting room.

868
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,708

were in prison.

1041
00:40:14,042 --> 00:40:15,167
- I know.
- I was in love

1042
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,250
with you.

1043
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,458
- I know.

1044
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,583
- You know that.

1045
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,750
- So we got our sights
set on a normal life.

1046
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,792
- You know, I just wanna
have a family with you.

1047
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:29,167
- Okay, we need to
start taking that route.

1048
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,042
- Well, we're going to.

1049
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:35,542
- There comes a point
that is this the life

1050
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:37,958
that we really wanna
lead for ourselves?

1051
00:40:37,958 --> 00:40:38,875
- Right 'cause we

1052
00:40:38,875 --> 00:40:39,792
wanna have kids.
- Having to be

1053
00:40:39,792 --> 00:40:41,708
in the spotlight all the time.

1054
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,792
- Trust me, I'm on
this journey with you.

1055
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,167
[sad music]

1056
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,542
But I still would like
you to remarry me.

1057
00:40:50,542 --> 00:40:53,708
- I would, I just,
the timing needs to be

1058
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:56,292
at a little bit of a
more convenient time

1059
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:57,625
than just right now.

1060
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:06,458
[sad music]

1061
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:08,708
I had a nightmare about my mom.

1062
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:12,208
I know I didn't turn
out how you wanted me to

1063
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:13,875
and I know you
wished better for me.

1064
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:15,625
- [Friend] How's
it feeling, Gyps?

1065
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,542
- I think it hurts less than
the pick and poke that I did.

1066
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:21,833
It's a K to
symbolize Ken, my ex.

1067
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:25,500
- What?
- [Stepmom] Yes.

1068
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,875
- If I wasn't married to Ryan...

1069
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,000
[fingers snap]

1070
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,250
- I know.

1071
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,000
Well he's not with
anyone right now.

1072
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,542
- Of course not.

1073
00:41:33,542 --> 00:41:35,375
I have my commitment
to my husband,

1074
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:39,542
but I also just feel like no
one is ever gonna love him

1075
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,750
as much as I love him.

1076
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,375
- He's a dumb mother [bleep].

1077
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:44,750
Pretty soon I'm
gonna get involved

1078
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,542
and you do not want that, Ken.

1079
00:41:46,542 --> 00:41:48,458
Believe me, you
do not want that.
