you. And I always will.

173
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:15,125
- [Ryan] You're still
technically my wife,

174
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:20,292
and I do miss you, I'm not
gonna lie, I miss you terribly.

175
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,458
- [Gypsy] Ryan, it's too late.

176
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:26,208
I've set down a path I can't
change, even if I wanted to.

177
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,958
- [Ryan] Yes you could, if you
wanted to, you could, baby.

178
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,417
I mean, come on, at
least let me see you.

179
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,208
- [Gypsy] I told
you I needed time

180
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,167
to figure out how I felt.

181
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,708
- [Ryan] But you
haven't even seen me!

182
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:42,875
It's not fair.

183
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,292
- I've lived with you
for three months.

184
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,458
- [Gypsy] Do you think
that if you saw me

185
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,042
anything would change?

186
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:52,833
- [Ryan] Maybe, but I
mean, me not seeing you

187
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:55,875
after one fight is
(bleep), it's (bleep).

188
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,792
- [Gypsy] I just don't
think it's a good idea.

189
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:02,042
- [Ryan] Why?

190
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:05,875
- [Gypsy] [sighs]
Because I don't--

191
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:07,167
- [Ryan] So you know.

192
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,917
- [Gypsy] I don't wanna
give you false hope.

193
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,208
- [Ryan] False hope?

194
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,458
- [Gypsy] Even this call
is giving you false hope.

195
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:17,958
I shouldn't have called.

196
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,458
- [Ryan] Babe,
when I married you,

197
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,000
I knew this would be difficult,

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,208
I knew this would be difficult,

199
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,167
I knew that.

200
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,500
But you gotta know,
I'm still right here,

201
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,583
I've been here this whole time.

202
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,292
- [Gypsy] I know, but I'm not.

203
00:10:42,417 --> 00:10:44,958
- I want a divorce,

204
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,958
and in six to nine months,
I'm gonna be with Ken.

205
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,000
- [Ryan] You are still
Gypsy Rose-Anderson,

206
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,708
you know that, right?

207
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,333
- [Gypsy] Trust me, I know.

208
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,375
I'll text you later.

- [Gypsy] Hey,

214
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,792
- [Ken] I'm driving. [laughs]

215

What are you doing?

216
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,792
- [Gypsy] I talked to Ryan,

217
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,750
I just got off the
phone with him.

218
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,000

- [Gypsy] He wants to meet up.

221
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:42,833
- [Gypsy] Obviously, I don't
think it's a good idea.

222
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:45,917
I told him point blank, I
said, "I want a divorce,

223
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:48,750
and after this six to nine
months, I'm gonna be with Ken."

224

225
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,458
- [Gypsy] He's still like trying
to like work it out with me.

226
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:06,000
- [Gypsy] Any part of
me that wants to? No.

227
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,333
- [Gypsy] Honestly, no.

228
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,042
- [Gypsy] I know. I trust you.

229
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,208
- [Gypsy] I love
you, too. Be safe.

230
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,292
- [Gypsy] I will. I'll
talk to you soon.

231
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,333
Bye.

232
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,208
Ken has always been in my heart,

233
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:36,042
and I needed to find out what
it was that I was feeling,

234
00:12:36,042 --> 00:12:38,875
why can't I get,
like, not let go?

235
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,208
And he came to visit me,
so this is the first time

236
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:43,958
we've been able to see
each other in person.

237
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,500
We had a great weekend.

238
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,833
We went to New Orleans, we
just hung out, got caught up.

The idea of getting
a husky together

240
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:56,208
has always been like a thing
that we've bonded over.

241
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,750
So when we reconnected,
I was like,

242
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:01,000
"Let's get matching
husky tattoos." [laughs]

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,458
This was my idea. [laughs]
I'm like, "Let's do it!"

I'm like, "This feels
right, this feels good."

For the first time,
I'm like, "Hell yeah!"

Like I'm happy right now,
like this is freaking awesome.

We just create happiness,

where it's almost like
a giddy teenager happy.

00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:25,125
Having that taste of what
it could be like with Ken

250
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:30,250
just solidified my
feelings for him.

She whispered to me
that she was scared.

confidence was nothing.

going on behind the scenes

331

do was acknowledge

that this marriage is not
what I want and not working,

340
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:02,542
- [Kristy] No, it was like--

341
00:18:02,542 --> 00:18:03,458
- [Mia] Don't cut me off.
- [Kristy] "Happy birthday,"

342
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:03,625
and stuff like-- you cut me off.

343
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,458
and stuff like-- you cut me off.

344
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,208
It was, it got less and less.

345
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,875
Like when they first split.

346
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:14,375
- [Mia] You played a big
role in their thing, though.

347
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,958
- [Kristy] Well you know, she
needed to know the real reason

348
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,250
why he ended it.

349
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,083
- [Mia] Did she?
- [Kristy] Yes she did, because-

350
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,292
- [Mia] He should've
told her then, not you.

351
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:28,042
- [Mia] Did she?
- [Kristy] Yes she did, because-

352
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:29,542
- [Kristy] Ryan
didn't want her--

353
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,917
- [Gypsy] I did block him,
because Ryan wanted me to.

354
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,333
- [Kristy] Right, so--
- [Mia] If you ever came to me

355
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,417
talking about one of my
exes while I'm with Andre,

356
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,208
like married, like that is-
- [Kristy] No, no.

357
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,292
Y'all situation's different.

358
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:42,375
Y'all situation's different.

359
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,333
She needed closure.

360
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:48,833
And she didn't have it, so I
took it upon myself to do it.

361
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,208
He let her go,

362
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:59,125
because he wanted her to
find herself without him.

363
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:04,292
The main reason why he ended
it was not what we thought.

364
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,750
- [Mia] Yeah, I don't know
if I believe that, either.

365
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,958
I still gotta, I
gotta talk to him.

366
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,417
I gotta make my own...

367
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,542
- [Gypsy] And that's something
that I want you to do.

368
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,583
Like, on your own
time, you know.

369
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:22,125
- [Kristy] I wouldn't
have liked if

370
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:27,375
Ryan would've dogged Ken
after he knew the real truth.

371
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,583
- [Gypsy] He did.

372
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:31,375
- [Mia] That is
still not your place.

373
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,000
- [Kristy] Well, I
didn't say it was my,

374
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,042
I said this is my opinion.

375
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:37,875
- [Mia] And he had every right
to hate Ken and all that.

376
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:39,500
He has every single right.
- [Kristy] Exactly.

377
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,375
- So let him feel the way he-
- [Kristy] Exactly.

378
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,042
- [Mia] Then why are you
saying that you wouldn't

379
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,458
want him talking
about Ken like that?

380
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:45,750
That is his feelings.

381
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,208
- [Kristy] No, he has
a better understanding--

382
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,458
- [Mia] Oh my gosh.
- [Kristy] Mia, of why.

383
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,875
- [Mia] I'm not gonna,
okay. Conversation done.

384
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,375
Before I get pissed off,
I'm not talking more.

385
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,875
- [Kristy] I just see things
at all different angles

386
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,708
than you, I guess.

387
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,375
- [Mia] No, 'cause you're
saying one thing and then,

388
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,042
I say something else, but
then you agree with me

389
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,625
and it's just flip flop like a-

390
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,250
- [Kristy] I don't agree
with, I'm telling you why

391
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,875
I told her, why I told Gypsy-

392
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:09,375
- [Gypsy] Y'all have
the worst communication.

393
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,792
- [Mia] She don't know
when to stop talking

394
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,333
and she keeps talking
on and on and on--

395
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,625
- [Kristy] In circles.

396
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,708
- [Mia] And don't even
make sense sometimes.

397
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:16,417
I'm like, "What are you
even trying to say?"

398
00:20:16,417 --> 00:20:17,917
- [Kristy] Well, I'm just trying
to make the whole thing--

399
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,250
- [Mia] I get, but do
you see my whole point?

400
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,958
You don't like to,
you say "I, I, I."

401
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,125
- [Kristy] I, I, yeah.

402
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,667
Because that's how
I, and I told you,

403
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:29,042
I, this is my opinion.
- [Mia] All right.

404
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,792
- [Kristy] Not Gypsy's, not
the man in the moon's opinion,

405
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:32,958
my opinion.

406
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:37,792
- [Mia] There just
have been many things

407
00:20:37,792 --> 00:20:41,292
from many different angles
that have bothered me.

408
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,750
And I don't know.

409
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,542
Maybe just different
values, different morals,

410
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,625
but I mean, it is what
it is. It's not my life.

411
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:49,750
- [Kristy] Well, like I said--

412
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,833
- [Gypsy] Normally,
it's not my values, but.

413
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,958
- [Mia] A little different
thing between Ryan and Ken,

414
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:03,125
for me, is that Ken knew
that Gypsy was still married.

415
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,333
Where's your respect for Ryan?

416
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,958
You may not like the
guy at all, but like,

417
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,000
for me, that says a lot
about your character.

418
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,333
And I don't feel like he
was trying to protect Gypsy

419
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,833
in the best way.

420
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,583
How are you protecting her,

421
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,083
from what these people
are gonna say about her?

422
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,833
How are you protecting her from

423
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,458
what the world is
gonna think of her?

424
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:30,250
You are not doing
anything, at all.

425
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,917
Y'all are making
irrational decisions

426
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,250
based on short-term
happiness instead of,

427
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,625
you know, thinking long-term.

428
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,083
- [Gypsy] Watching
Mia and Kristy fight,

429
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm just like, "Mm-hmm."

430
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,500
People get affected
by my choices.

431
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,375
I get affected by my choices.

432
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:51,208
But at the end of the
day, I have to also

433
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,958
live with myself and, if nobody
else is gonna make me happy,

434
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,875
I have to do what's
gonna make me happy.

435
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,083
- [Kristy] I don't regret
a thing. You know why?

436
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,500
She's my priority.

437
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,417
I want her to be happy.

438
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:07,875
I want her to live, bottom line.

439
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:09,917
[soft music]

440
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,542
- [Ryan] Come on,
Pix. [smooches]

441
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,292
Come on.

442
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:20,667
Hey.
- [Joy] Who's here?

443
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:23,292
- [Ryan] Pixie Pix.
- [Joy] Pixie Pix!

444
00:22:23,292 --> 00:22:25,750
- [Ryan] Yeah.
[dogs barking]

445
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,292
- [Joy] Did you sleep
in here last night?

446
00:22:28,292 --> 00:22:30,417
- [Ryan] Yeah. I sleep fine.

447
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,083
I get a text at like
three in the morning,

448
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:38,083
"Hey, I'm awake. Please
let me know you're okay.

449
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,875
How's our baby doing?"

450
00:22:39,875 --> 00:22:41,625
- [Joy] Oh, now she
wants to know about Pix.

451
00:22:41,625 --> 00:22:43,542
- [Ryan] Now she wants to know
about, "I miss her so much,

452
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:44,875
how's our baby?"

453
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,708
Stuff like that gives
me hope and it's...

454
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:50,042
- [Joy] But, I know, Ryan,
but is that healthy?

455
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,375
- [Ryan] Mom, that's
what I'm dealing with.

456
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,958
That's, I have to fight that.

457
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,333
- [Joy] I know, I know.

458
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,792
I know, it's such a
rollercoaster ride.

459
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,542
- [Ryan] Last night, she
told me "I'm selfish,

460
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:03,625
I'm sorry I'm so selfish."

461
00:23:03,625 --> 00:23:05,958
- [Joy] If she wants to go, go.

462
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,542
But why the continual contact?

463
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:12,958
- [Ryan] You know, I'm
struggling with that,

464
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,958
I'm wondering how much
longer I can take.

465
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:17,292
- [Joy] You're gonna know
when you've had enough.

466
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:18,667
You're gonna know.

467
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,333
But that don't mean there's
not a lot of heartbreak

468
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,917
in between that.
- Yeah.

469
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,917
[soft music]

470
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:27,917
She got out, we went to
New York and we had this

471
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:31,250
honeymoon romance in New
York and then we came back

472
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,167
and started living
our regular life.

473
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:39,250
I think she expected it to stay
that honeymoon perfect phase

474
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,542
like, living carefree.

475
00:23:42,542 --> 00:23:44,625
- [Joy] Do you think
she had that envisioned

476
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:47,417
in her mind before
she was released,

477
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,292
that that's the way
that life's gonna be?

478
00:23:49,292 --> 00:23:50,375
- [Ryan] Yes.

479
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:52,000
- [Joy] Well, it's
not like that.

480
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,958
- [Ryan] So when Ken came
to visit, it was a vacation.

481
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:57,542
It was wonderful,
it was a vacation.

482
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:59,958
'Cause it was.
- [Joy] Yeah, it was. It was.

483
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:03,167
- [Ryan] That's not real life.
- [Joy] Mm-mm.

484
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,750
- [Rod] So how was
your time with Ken?

485
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,208
- [Gypsy] It was amazing.

486
00:24:13,208 --> 00:24:14,625
- [Rod] Really?
- [Gypsy] Yeah.

487
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:21,625
We went to New Orleans and
we did like a swamp tour.

488
00:24:21,625 --> 00:24:24,708
We got Jazz Fest tickets.
- [Rod] Yes.

489
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,167
- [Gypsy] I talked
to Mia about it.

490
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,292
- [Rod] Yeah.

491
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,417
- And she's okay
with him coming.

492
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:31,042
She copped an attitude with me.

493
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:34,208
Rightfully so.

494
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:35,458
'Cause she asked me, she's like,

495
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,958
"Oh, you going to get a tattoo?"

496
00:24:36,958 --> 00:24:38,667
I said, "Yeah, I'm
gonna get a tattoo.

497
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:40,042
Ken's getting one, too."

498
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:45,292
She didn't ask me if we were
getting matching tattoos.

499
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,708
So I kind of left that part out.

500
00:24:46,708 --> 00:24:48,000
- [Kristy] Did you show him?

501
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,833
- [Gypsy] No, no, I didn't.
- Oh, that's right.

502
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:50,958
Yeah.

503
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:53,458
Oh, it is bigger.

504
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:54,792
- [Gypsy] Yeah, it's a lot
bigger than what I thought.

505
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:56,208
And then, like his
is the same thing,

506
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:57,375
but it doesn't have this,

507
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:58,583
and it doesn't have
the little dots.

508
00:24:58,583 --> 00:24:59,833
- [Kristy] Hers is the girl one.

509
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,000
- [Gypsy] Mine's the girl one.

510
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,208
- [Rod] So they're
not matching tattoos.

511
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,750
- [Gypsy] They're not identical!
[Rod laughing]

512
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,375
- [Rod] At least
it doesn't say Ken.

513
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:08,792
- [Gypsy] [laughs]
No. It doesn't.

514
00:25:08,792 --> 00:25:11,083
- [Joy] And this tat.
What's up with the tat?

515
00:25:12,625 --> 00:25:13,958
- [Ryan] That was too...

516
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,250
- [Joy] Don't wanna
talk about it. Okay.

517
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,708
- [Ryan] That's one I
don't like talking about.

518
00:25:19,708 --> 00:25:21,375
- [Joy] All right.

519
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,917
- [Ryan] That was a scar that

520
00:25:23,917 --> 00:25:25,667
I probably will never get over.

521
00:25:26,583 --> 00:25:27,833
- [Joy] Probably so.

522
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:30,708
- [Ryan] That one was
a scar that cut deep.

523
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,917
[pensive music]

524
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:54,917
- [Rod] I guess we're
moving on to Ken.

525
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:56,917
I have to start accepting..

526
00:25:56,917 --> 00:25:58,208
- [Kristy] Ken's a good guy.

527
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:00,917
I like, I've talked to
him a lot more than you.

528
00:26:00,917 --> 00:26:02,542
- [Rod] I'm not saying
he's not a good guy.

529
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:03,833
- [Kristy] Right, you just,

530
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:05,375
I mean, she needed to
find out who she was

531
00:26:05,375 --> 00:26:10,167
without anybody else, and the
way a lot of people see it is

532
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:15,250
what Ryan did was
selfish on his part.

533
00:26:17,167 --> 00:26:19,250
When she finally told me
and I asked her straight up,

534
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,667
I said, "So you didn't
want to come live here

535
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,875
because you were 32 years old

536
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:27,292
and you thought you
would be a burden?"

537
00:26:29,292 --> 00:26:30,750
She said yeah.
- [Rod] Really?

538
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,125
- [Kristy] Mm-hmm.

539
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:33,750
That's the reason
why she married him.

540
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,792
Did she wanna love him like
he loved her? Of course.

541
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:40,917
But when it's not
there, it's not there.

542
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:44,875
- [Rod] I feel like
a failure now that..

543
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,875
We had all that time
to make her feel like

544
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:51,958
she had a place to come to and
she still didn't feel that.

545
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,708
- [Kristy] Look, if
you would have said,

546
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:55,750
"I'm totally against it, no,"

547
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,333
that's what she
wanted you to say.

548
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,625
She was craving that from you.

549
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:03,708
But you know how you said, like,

550
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:05,417
"I don't want to
tell her what to do

551
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:06,833
because that's
what her mom did"?

552
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:09,458
- [Rod] I'm just thinking
about what you said,

553
00:27:09,458 --> 00:27:11,292
about why she married Ryan.

554
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,208
[Rod sighing]

555
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,292
- [Kristy] It's a
hard pill to swallow.

556
00:27:17,292 --> 00:27:20,208
- [Rod] Well, I mean, I'm gonna
try not to carry any guilt.

557
00:27:22,625 --> 00:27:24,583
And I'm not gonna
tell her no next time

558
00:27:24,583 --> 00:27:26,167
if I don't like it, either.

559
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,667
She's gotta make
her own decisions.

560
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,583
- [Kristy] You're
right. You're right.

561
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:29,792
- [Rod] I'm not carrying that.

562
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:31,250
- [Kristy] But I
know, right, exactly.

563
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,875
- [Rod] She might be mad
right now, living here,

564
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,375
"Oh, I should have married Ryan"

565
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,375
if I cracked down and act
like this hard ass daddy.

566
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:39,375
You know? "No, you gotta
be home by 10 o'clock."

567
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:41,375
- [Kristy] Rod, we wouldn't
have told her that, though.

568
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,458
We wouldn't have told her she
had to be home by 10 o'clock.

569
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:44,708
- [Rod] Well--

570
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,000
- [Kristy] What the
hell you talking about?

571
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,333
- [Rod] That's the kind
of daddy that is, though.

572
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:48,792
The kind that says, "No,
you can't get married,"

573
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,000
is the kind of daddy
that says, "No,

574
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,083
you gotta be home
by 10 o'clock."

575
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:52,625
- No, no, no.
- I'm not that person.

576
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:53,833
- [Kristy] I know
you're not that person.

577
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:54,833
Don't get mad at me!

578
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:56,208
- [Rod] I'm not,
I'm just saying.

579
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,875
- [Kristy] No, dude,
bro, let me tell you.

580
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,792
You take that anger out
on his ass over there

581
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:02,750
in Lake Charles and not on me.

582
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:06,792
I saw your face, I saw
your reaction. I know.

583
00:28:06,792 --> 00:28:08,083
- [Rod] I'm just
making a point. Sorry.

584
00:28:08,083 --> 00:28:09,167
- [Kristy] Now you're
freaking pissed.

585
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:12,250
And it's okay, but
don't get mad at--

586
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,000
No, uh-uh, you throw that
attitude somewheres else.

587
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:22,917
- You know, I feel guilty
that I didn't tell her no.

588
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,292
'Cause I really didn't,

589
00:28:24,292 --> 00:28:26,625
I really felt like
it wasn't gonna work.

590
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,500
It was just the
dynamics of her being,

591
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,083
you know, controlled
all her life

592
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:32,750
and getting out and being free.

593
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:37,458
I mean, I don't know if it
would have worked with Ken

594
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:39,250
when she comes out, you know?

595
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,167
So, I need to let her make that
choice and we'll deal with,

596
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:47,875
I'm not gonna say I
haven't learned from it,

597
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:50,000
I think I can probably be
a little bit more honest

598
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,125
with her now, you know.

599
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:55,125
So I have some daddy issues
that I have to deal with myself.

600
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:01,250
[pensive music]

601
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,458
[phone ringing]

602
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,708
- [Gypsy] Hey.

603
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:20,875
- [Ken] Hey, how's it going?

604
00:29:20,875 --> 00:29:23,083
- [Gypsy] I'm good.
Where you at?

605
00:29:25,875 --> 00:29:27,542
- [Gypsy] Okay, that's not bad.

606
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:28,917
That'll be here in no time.

607
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,958
How are you feeling?

608
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:36,083
- [Gypsy] I been tracking you.

609
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,083
- [Gypsy] Mm-hmm.

610
00:29:38,875 --> 00:29:40,958
- [Gypsy] And stalking you.

611
00:29:42,792 --> 00:29:45,458
[light music]

612
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:50,042
- [Gypsy] This weekend,
Dad, Kristy, me, and Ken

613
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:51,833
are all gonna go to Jazz Fest.

614
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,958
And we're just gonna have
like a really nice weekend,

615
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,458
I'm very excited.

616
00:29:57,458 --> 00:30:00,750
I haven't seen him since
probably about three weeks ago.

617
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,875
[laughs] All right,
well, drive safe.

618
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,917
- [Gypsy] Love you. Bye.

619
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:10,042
My hope is that Ken and I will

620
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,958
have that fairytale dream life

621
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,875
that we always wanted
to have with each other.

622
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:19,500
But I'm only planning
as far as a week.

623
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:24,500
You know, 'cause
that's all you can do.

624
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,000
'Cause things always change.

625
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,417
He's on 21st.
- [Kristy] He's right there.

626
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,083
Why?

627
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,542
- [Gypsy] I'm not
nervous, I just--

628
00:30:39,542 --> 00:30:41,167
- [Kristy] Nervous excited?
- [Gypsy] Nervous excited.

629
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:45,375
- [Rod] I'm kinda struggling
with how I'm gonna

630
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:49,125
handle this whole Ken scenario
now that it's a thing.

631
00:30:50,083 --> 00:30:51,875
You know, he broke her heart.

632
00:30:51,875 --> 00:30:54,583
And I really never had
any closure with that,

633
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,375
I never talked to him about it.

634
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,167
The relationship
I have with Gypsy,

635
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,917
you know, I'm walking
a line with her,

636
00:31:01,917 --> 00:31:05,250
I don't wanna be too
pushy, but be supportive

637
00:31:06,542 --> 00:31:10,125
and you know, provide her
with some good advice,

638
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:13,458
which I'm learning to do that.

639
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:16,625
- [Gypsy] This would be the
first time my dad has seen Ken

640
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,250
since 2019.

641
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,417
My dad has always expressed that

642
00:31:22,417 --> 00:31:24,542
it's not that he
doesn't like Ken,

643
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:24,708
it's he didn't like
how Ken broke my heart.

644
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:27,333
it's he didn't like
how Ken broke my heart.

645
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:32,583
I think Ken's headspace
is trying to get back

646
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:34,667
in my dad's good graces.

647
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:37,708
Trying to make up for that
bridge that was kind of burned.

648
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:46,000
[tense music]

649
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,583
- [Kristy] There he is.

650
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,167
I wanna see Parker.

651
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:57,708
Where's Parker?

652
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:02,250
- [Gypsy] Hey!
- [Ken] Hey, you.

653
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,333
[Gypsy squealing]
[dog barking]

654
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:08,542
[smooches] Good to see you.
- [Gypsy] You too.

655
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:10,042
- [Ken] Let me get
Parker real quick.

656
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:11,708
- [Kristy] Yeah, get
Parker. I want Parker.

657
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,167
- [Gypsy] Hey, buddy!
- [Ken] Come on out, buddy.

658
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:15,583
- Hey, buddy.

659
00:32:15,583 --> 00:32:17,542
- [Kristy] Parker!
- [Gypsy] Miss me?

660
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:18,875
Parker, Parker!

661
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:20,208
He's like, "Where's Jas?"

662
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:23,000
- [Kristy] What you doing? Huh?

663
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,417
You wanna know who loves
me? Parker loves me.

664
00:32:27,417 --> 00:32:28,792
- [Ken] Yeah, he missed you.

665
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:32,125
Hey, Kristy.
- [Kristy] Hey.

666
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,875
- [Ken] I like your
hair. Looks good.

667
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:36,208
- [Kristy] Thank
you. You smell good.

668
00:32:36,208 --> 00:32:38,125
- [Ken] Oh, thanks.
How's it going, Rod?

669
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,375
- [Gypsy] Oh, you're already
shedding all over me.

670
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,250
- [Kristy] That's why I
have the lint roller.

671
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:44,667
- [Gypsy] I made the mistake
of wearing these pants.

672
00:32:44,667 --> 00:32:47,250
[Ken chuckling]
(bleep).

673
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,750
I'm gonna sit on you.

674
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,042
- [Ken] Okay, come here.

675
00:32:50,042 --> 00:32:51,458
- [Rod] You did good.
- [Ken] Yeah.

676
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:53,708
- [Rod] Just an hour late.
- [Ken] Yeah.

677
00:32:53,708 --> 00:32:55,208
- [Gypsy] You're wearing
the cologne, I can tell.

678
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,500
- [Ken] I got it for you.

679
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,875
- [Rod] Okay, well,
while we're all here,

680
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:59,208
I got a few things I wanna say.

681
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:01,333
- [Gypsy] Oh, boy.
- [Ken] Okay.

682
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:03,125
- [Rod] First of all,
thanks for coming.

683
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:04,833
Right?
- [Ken] Thanks for having me.

684
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,708
- [Rod] I could tell
last couple weeks

685
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,208
how happy Gypsy's been.

686
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:14,583
Kristy brought
something up to me,

687
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:18,750
saying I wasn't telling Gypsy
how I felt on everything,

688
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,500
you asked about marrying Ryan.

689
00:33:23,792 --> 00:33:26,792
I may not have been
completely honest with you.

690
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:29,792
I wanted to let you make
that decision on your own.

691
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:32,417
I didn't want to make you feel
like I was controlling you,

692
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,833
you know?

693
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:36,625
You made a mistake, I made a
mistake. We're gonna move on.

694
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,875
And we're gonna be
proud of it. Okay?

695
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,583
Ken.

696
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,375
You broke her heart once. Right?

697
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:50,792
That scares me a
little bit still.

698
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:54,375
And I hope that
doesn't happen again.

699
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,667
Gypsy, I want you to know,

700
00:33:57,458 --> 00:34:01,417
you married Ryan, that's
just a piece of paper, baby.

701
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,708
I don't want you to
hide if you're in love.

702
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,750
If y'all are in love--
- [Kristy] Show it.

703
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,667
- [Rod] That's the best
feeling in the world.

704
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,625
You were controlled your
life, baby, your whole life.

705
00:34:17,625 --> 00:34:22,208
Don't hide your feelings
anymore, be you. Okay?

706
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:26,375
You know, your whole
life was based on lies.

707
00:34:26,375 --> 00:34:28,208
Let's start this off right.

708
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:31,750
If you're in love,
tell the world.

709
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,167
"I love Ken.

710
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:35,542
So what, I got married.
I made a mistake," baby.

711
00:34:35,542 --> 00:34:37,208
And I'm not worried
about how it looks

712
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,875
to the other people.

713
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:41,583
The biggest thing you lose
is some respect from me,

714
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,000
your mom, your sister, your mom.

715
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,667
You know, that integrity
is what matters.

716
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:50,208
Oh, and the last
thing I wanted to say.

717
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:51,833
She wants a baby.

718
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:52,958
- [Gypsy] What?!

719
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,083
- [Rod] I can tell, bro.

720
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,208
[Kristy laughing]
- [Gypsy] What?

721
00:34:57,208 --> 00:34:59,125
Where did this come from?

722
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,583
- [Kristy] I don't know.

723
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:03,583
- [Rod] I'm gonna tell both
of y'all, just wait. Okay?

724
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:06,250
Make sure y'all give y'all
relationship a chance

725
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,375
to develop without
the stress of--

726
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,542
- [Kristy] Well, one baby.
- [Rod] Additional burden, okay?

727
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,625
- [Gypsy] We'll have babies--

728
00:35:12,625 --> 00:35:14,083
- [Rod] I mean, I
want a baby, too.

729
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,250
You know, I'm not gonna lie.

730
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:18,125
I want a little
grandkid, but you know,

731
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,958
I don't want to be raising one.

732
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:21,917
[laughing]

733
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,750
- [Kristy] We want it
where it can go back home.

734
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,375
[Gypsy laughing]
- [Rod] Please, please.

735
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,542
I'm gonna be really
disappointed.

736
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,375
- [Ken] No, I 100%
agree with you on that.

737
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,750
It's definitely, you know.

738
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,750
- [Kristy] Y'all enjoy each
other first and foremost.

739
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,875
- [Ken] In time.
- [Gypsy] Lots of time.

740
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:40,583
[tense music]

741
00:35:52,375 --> 00:35:57,250
So it is the end of May
and I am late on my period.

742
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,708
So I texted Ken and I'm
like joking with him,

743
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,333
I'm like "Well, I guess
you've been spared

744
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,875
my PMS for the month, 'cause
I guess I'm not gonna,

745
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:07,042
I skipped a period."

746
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:10,292
So he's like, "Or, maybe..."

747
00:36:10,292 --> 00:36:12,417
And I'm like, "No,"
like, [scoffs].

748
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,083
And he's like, he gave me
like the big eye emoji.

749
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,167
I'll go and take a test.

750
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,250
So I go in the bathroom,
I take the test.

751
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:24,375
And it came back positive.

752
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,500
[pensive music]

753
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:35,208
- [exhales] Okay.

754
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,083
I'm breathing.

755
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:41,750
My first thought is "My dad's
gonna kill me!" [laughs]

756
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:47,625
'Cause he had just said, like,
"I know you want a baby,

757
00:36:47,625 --> 00:36:50,417
but I would prefer
you guys wait."

758
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,417
Yep, two positive tests.

759
00:36:58,417 --> 00:37:00,417
Not just one, two.

760
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:06,708
- Oh, he was happy, like
he had to take a moment,

761
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:09,375
like he took an hour, we
had a good FaceTime call,

762
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:11,917
he was excited, all smiles.

763
00:37:11,917 --> 00:37:14,667
And then like he had
to process for an hour.

764
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:16,375
And then he calls me
back and he starts like,

765
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:18,792
he's happy crying and I'm like,

766
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:23,625
"Aw, I've never heard you
like cry before." [laughs]

767
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,750
I've been having
a lot of anxiety.

768
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:27,958
Because it's like,

769
00:37:27,958 --> 00:37:30,375
I wanna make sure I'm
doing everything right.

770
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,833
There's too many what-ifs

771
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,542
and I can't go into
that rabbit hole.

772
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,875
[pensive music]

773
00:37:50,375 --> 00:37:52,625
How have I changed in
the last seven years?

774
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:54,375
- [Ken] You're more transparent.
- [Gypsy] Mm-hmm.

775
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,042
- I mean, you're still
the same impulsive,

776
00:37:57,042 --> 00:38:00,583
like do what you want type
person, it's a good thing.

777
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,917
- [Gypsy] Are you gonna
remind yourself of that

778
00:38:04,917 --> 00:38:06,375
when things get hard?

779
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,083
- [Ken] How much more
rough could it get?

780
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:10,125
- Rough.
- Okay.

781
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,500
We'll figure it out.

782
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,917
- [Gypsy] All right,
are we done? [laughs]

783
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,458
[Ken and Gypsy laughing]

784
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:31,167
- [Ken] Everything's
gonna be just fine, okay?

785
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,417
[tense music]

786
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:45,750
- [Producer] Did she tell
you? What was it like?

787
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:48,792
Can you give me a
little snapshot?

788
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:54,625
- [Ryan] [sighs] I mean, I
don't know what to think.

789
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:59,542
You know, a month before,
right after she left,

790
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:02,208
Gypsy texted me a bunch
of pregnancy tests

791
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,750
and said she was pregnant.

792
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,792
Okay, well, who's the father?

793
00:39:06,792 --> 00:39:09,625
It could have been me
or Ken at that point.

794
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:11,500
So, she didn't know.

795
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,042
She was like, "I don't know."

796
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:16,875
The previous month, she sent
me pictures of pregnancy tests.

797
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,625
But this time,
there's no pictures.

798
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:22,000
No proof, so like, I don't
know what to believe.

799
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,708
Like, it's one of those I don't
believe it, I still don't.

800
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,125
You know, it's hard for me
to wrap my head around that.

801
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:32,792
Like, secretly Gypsy and me
were trying to get pregnant.

802
00:39:32,792 --> 00:39:35,542
Well, Gypsy always
wanted to be pregnant.

803
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,750
It's so confusing. Such
a confusing time for me.

804
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,125
Like, my world's in turmoil.

805
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,583
- [Producer] What
happens next, for you?

806
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,458
- [Ryan] I have no idea.

807
00:39:50,125 --> 00:39:53,125
My mind is mush a lot and Gypsy
said the same thing to me.

808
00:39:54,042 --> 00:39:56,542
She doesn't know up
from down sometimes.

809
00:39:57,583 --> 00:40:00,167
But like, we always
had each other.

810
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,708
Gypsy's always come back to me.

811
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,708
You know, I mean, I
do love her enough to

812
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:08,625
want her to be
happy, but you know,

813
00:40:09,542 --> 00:40:11,000
is she that happy?

814
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:16,042
I mean, if she still contacts
me, is she that happy?

815
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,167
[pensive music]

816
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:26,667
- [Gypsy] I'm scared that I
bring a certain level of drama

817
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:30,583
to his life that I
don't mean to bring.

818
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:33,708
It just, it's like my baggage.

819
00:40:33,708 --> 00:40:35,917
He could leave me right now,

820
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:38,125
and it's completely
out of my control.

821
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:41,708
And that's scary, it
was scary back then

822
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:43,167
and it's still scary now.

823
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,917
But he has my heart, and
I can't control that.

824
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,667
- Yeah.

825
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,375
I mean, I trust
that he loves me,

826
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:09,250
I trust that I love him,

827
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,333
but that fear is there.

828
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,958
And right now, I just
think I'm happy again.

829
00:41:21,208 --> 00:41:23,333
And I don't wanna do
anything to mess it up.
