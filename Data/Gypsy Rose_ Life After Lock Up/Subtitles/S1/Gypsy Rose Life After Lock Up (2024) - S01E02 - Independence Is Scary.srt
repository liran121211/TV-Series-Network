1
00:00:02,042 --> 00:00:03,667
- [Woman] Gypsy was
Dee Dee's daughter,

2
00:00:03,708 --> 00:00:05,417
but also her prisoner.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,542
- Hospitals is what I knew,
surgeries is what I knew.

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:10,083
I have always had

5
00:00:10,208 --> 00:00:12,500
a difficulty letting go

6
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,917
of my ex-fiance, Ken.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,625
- Gypsy Blanchard
will be set free.

8
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,583
- She's ready to go home to
Louisiana with her husband.

9
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,500
- Oh my God. I did not sleep.

10
00:00:22,583 --> 00:00:25,125
Oh, it feels so
weird being in a car.

11
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,000
- Yeah. You're free.

12
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:30,500
We're being followed.
[Gypsy groans]

13
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:31,625
- [Bystander] Any plans?

14
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,667
- Lots of them.

15
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,167
- Made it.
- Hey!

16
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,542
We got another situation
going on though.

17
00:00:39,167 --> 00:00:41,250
- I just need a minute, okay.

18
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,750
I'm so sorry. [sobbing]

19
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:43,792
I don't know...

20
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:44,708
- [Kristy] Don't be sorry!

21
00:00:44,792 --> 00:00:46,292
- I do not feel free right now.

22
00:00:46,292 --> 00:00:49,250
I am in a different
form of prison.

23
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:50,458
[suspenseful music]

24
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:53,083
[Gypsy crying]

25
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:59,667
[gentle pensive music]

26
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:05,292
[Gypsy crying]

27
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,500
[Kristy faintly speaking]

28
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,167
- [Kristy] It's okay.

29
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:15,333
- [Gypsy] [sobbing] I'm sorry.

30
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:19,458
- [Kristy] Like I said, there
is nothing to be sorry about.

31
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:22,125
[tense music]

32
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,208
[people chattering]

33
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:27,875
- [Gypsy] I'm just
scared about them saying,

34
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:29,250
okay, you're being
argumentative.

35
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,083
Okay, you're
getting a violation.

36
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:32,333
- [Mike] Okay.

37
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,167
- [Gypsy] You're
getting sent back.

38
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:34,333
- So first of all,

39
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:36,167
you have to actually
commit a violation

40
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,167
for them to revoke
you, which you haven't.

41
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:42,625
Right now the guy that
we need to deal with is,

42
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,833
sounds like he was missing
a piece of information.

43
00:01:44,917 --> 00:01:45,708
- Mmm-hmm.

44
00:01:45,792 --> 00:01:46,750
- We'll sort this out.

45
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:47,833
- [Gypsy] Okay.
- Okay?

46
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:48,625
- [Ryan] Thanks, boss.
- [Mike] Yeah.

47
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:49,583
- Thank you.

48
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:50,417
[gentle music]

49
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
I'm a very responsible person

50
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:55,250
and I'm not gonna
argue with anyone.

51
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:58,667
If they give me a
directive, I will follow it.

52
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,292
They always say,

53
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:02,458
the justice system is meant
to fail an individual,

54
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,750
but I'm not gonna let them.

55
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,792
It's whatever it
takes to keep me free.

56
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,000
[gentle tense music]

57
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,667
[phone ringing]

58
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,583
[people chattering]

59
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,333
[phone ringing]

60
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:19,083
- [Ryan] This is Ryan.

61
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:20,917
Hold on one second for me, sir.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,167
Let me get Gypsy.

63
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:25,750
[people chattering]

64
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:26,750
[Ryan murmurs]

65
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,458
[somber music]

66
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,958
[Ryan murmurs]

67
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:39,500
- Hello?

68
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,583
- Okay, would that
be immediately or,

69
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:51,542
or tomorrow morning.

70
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,250
- Okay, tomorrow morning?

71
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:03,208
- If that is yes,
if that is okay,

72
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,333
because we have like, literally
not even slept two hours.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,917
- Twelve.

74
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,875
- Yes.

75
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:25,583
- Yes and it takes
roughly about 13 hours.

76
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,792
- Okay.

77
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,292
- All right. Thank you.

78
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,583
- [Parole Officer] Thank you.

79
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:44,542
[phone beeps]

80
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:45,333
- Okay.

81
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,500
- [Rod] It's settled. Good.

82
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:47,750
- It's settled.
- [Ryan] It's settled.

83
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,917
- I could live with that.
Let's enjoy today.

84
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:49,917
- I can live with that.

85
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,417
[people laughing, chattering]

86
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,542
- That's the main thing
is I don't wanna go back.

87
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:56,500
I didn't know what
all was gonna happen

88
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:59,500
and I'm just kind of like, I'm
overwhelmed with everything.

89
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:02,833
And I'm like, I don't
wanna go back to prison.

90
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,667
I don't wanna do anything
that they are not okay with.

91
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,750
- [Ryan] Right.

92
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,167
- I'm like, I feel
like I've done my part.

93
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,833
- Right. You have.

94
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,125
You have. Look at me, you have.

95
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,000
- Okay.

96
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,333
- And you know,

97
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:17,208
it sucks we won't be able
to stay in [indistinct].

98
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,375
But it's okay.

99
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,208
- I'm okay with that.
- [Ryan] Yeah.

100
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,500
- I'm just kind of like

101
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,375
the going back to
Louisiana right now.

102
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,708
- Right. That's the kicker.

103
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:24,708
We didn't wanna do that.

104
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:25,958
- Right.

105
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,000
- And now we got directed,
we can enjoy the day,

106
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,875
enjoy the night, wake up have
breakfast in the morning then go

107
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,708
- [Gypsy] Okay.
- and well go back to our home.

108
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,958
- Okay.
- Okay?

109
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,250
- [Gypsy] I love you.

110
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:41,708
- [Kristy] So, what'd
you do last night?

111
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,542
- Was the bed comfy?

112
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,167
- The bed was comfy and,

113
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,708
it was so nice.

114
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,417
It was so nice.

115
00:04:49,417 --> 00:04:51,917
We consummated our marriage.

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,750
[Kristy laughing]

117
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,167
[Gypsy laughing]

118
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:59,125
- [Kristy] Silly
girl, silly girl.

119
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,625
- You're so happy for me.

120
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:01,750
- [Kristy] You're a silly girl.

121
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,500
[Gypsy laughing]

122
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,375
[laughing]

123
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,208
- Bragging rights.

124
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,042
Girl, you deserve that.

125
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,167
- I'm happy that, you know,

126
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,750
it was with the right person.

127
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,000
You know, that's important.

128
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,167
- [Mia] I just wanted to have
a little girl talk with you.

129
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,417
- [Gypsy] Okay.

130
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,417
- Birth control, did
you figure that out?

131
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,625
- Okay.

132
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,292
Do you want kids right away?

133
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,875
- I mean, I want kids.

134
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,042
I just, I don't think that
right away would be smart.

135
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:39,958
- Agreed.

136
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,792
- I'm not gonna say that,

137
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,333
if it happened,

138
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,583
I would be sad.

139
00:05:47,667 --> 00:05:51,208
I just don't think
that, I'm not gonna try.

140
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:54,583
I just wanna settle
into marriage.

141
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:56,625
I know in my heart that
the marriage is stable,

142
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:57,583
It's like, is this my life.

143
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,667
but I just wanna
feel it out first.

144
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,833
- Do you think that

145
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,875
all the medication and the
surgeries may have hindered

146
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:07,958
your ability?

147
00:06:08,042 --> 00:06:09,458
- I'm not, I'm hoping not.

148
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:12,333
I've had regular
periods, you know,

149
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,833
I've had two pap
smears in prison.

150
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,458
They all came back normal.

151
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,708
But like, I don't know.

152
00:06:19,792 --> 00:06:22,417
- You should probably schedule
a gynecologist appointment.

153
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,792
- Yeah, yeah.
- Soon.

154
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:27,000
Probably could find out
how many eggs you have left

155
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,958
and all that.

156
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:30,167
And if you are able to.

157
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,375
- Mmm-hmm.

158
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,708
- And me talking
to you about this

159
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,542
is not me telling you to
have babies or me like-

160
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:35,542
- [Gypsy] I know.

161
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,417
- I want you to have kids.

162
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,333
I just don't want-

163
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,125
- [Gypsy] No, I know, I know.

164
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,500
- To prevent that.

165
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,333
- [Gypsy] Right, you
just wanna make sure

166
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:41,208
that I'm doing the right thing.

167
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:42,083
- Yeah.
- I get it.

168
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:42,958
- [Mia] When it's on your time.

169
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:43,875
- Yeah, I understand.

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,042
Thank you.

171
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:45,833
- You're welcome.

172
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,333
Somebody has to.

173
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:48,375
Now, you have a sister
to talk to about this.

174
00:06:48,458 --> 00:06:49,833
- Thank you!

175
00:06:49,917 --> 00:06:50,667
Thank you, sis.

176
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,667
Love you.
- Love you, too.

177
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:53,500
- Okay.

178
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:54,792
- I'm very hopeful

179
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,958
and I'm worried,

180
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,083
for sure.

181
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,417
I'm worried about the world.

182
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,292
It's like she's a
new little born baby

183
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,500
and I don't want
anything to hurt her.

184
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,708
I know she wants to do
things with her life

185
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:12,292
and she wants to
find her purpose

186
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,292
and she's excited for that.

187
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,583
And I'll be there to
help her figure it out

188
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:18,792
as much as I can be.

189
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:22,458
[gentle bright music]

190
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:23,500
- To freedom.

191
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:24,917
- Let's pop one up, right?

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,958
- [Gypsy] Right.

193
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:27,500
- All right, one, two, three.
- Three.

194
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:28,542
[bottle cap pops]

195
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:31,750
[everyone exclaims]

196
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:32,792
[Gypsy laughs]

197
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,667
- The color palettes of freedom

198
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:38,667
are so bright and fibrous.

199
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,917
- [Mia] Smile like you're happy.

200
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,333
- Smile like you mean it.

201
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:45,125
In prison, it's
white walls, gray,

202
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,292
strong metal.

203
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,667
[family laughing]

204
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,208
This is what I've
been missing out on.

205
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:53,125
It's amazing. [laughing]

206
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,542
Hmm, oh, that's so good.

207
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,250
I feel very weird.

208
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:03,042
Being in front of an
audience. [laughing]

209
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:04,375
Oh my goodness.

210
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,375
These, I think, will fit!

211
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,833
I have fat calves.

212
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,417
- Suck it in. I'm just kidding.

213
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,542
[Gypsy laughs]

214
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,667
- [Ryan] You see, I was leaving?

215
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,250
- You're about
ready to get kicked.

216
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:19,000
- Her road right now is hills,
spirals, u-turns, everything.

217
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,708
Everything has been
thrown at her, you know,

218
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,958
from having all this family
time to cutting it short.

219
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:26,083
But it is what it is.

220
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:27,750
I mean, she's gonna have

221
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,500
to put her seatbelt on
pretty tight. [laughing]

222
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,875
That's what I'm gonna say.

223
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:33,333
Hold on 'cause it's
gonna be a bumpy ride.

224
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,000
But she always has me.

225
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:37,583
We're her tribe.

226
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,167
- And this is my
big present to you.

227
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,167
- Okay.

228
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,125
Ooh!

229
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,708
Christian Louboutin!

230
00:08:44,792 --> 00:08:46,750
These are really nice.

231
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,542
- [Kristy] Those are stunning.

232
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,625
- Okay.

233
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,083
Awwww!
- [Kristy] Read it.

234
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:59,958
- Never forget that I love
you forever and always.

235
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:01,833
I hope that you
believe in yourself

236
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,125
as much as I believe in you.

237
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,833
Always keep me in your heart.

238
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,333
For you are always in mind.

239
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:11,208
Nothing and no one, not even
time will ever change that.

240
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:12,667
You are braver than you believe,

241
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,125
stronger than you seem,

242
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,167
smarter than you think and
love more than you know.

243
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:20,167
I can't promise to be here
for the rest of your life,

244
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,500
but I can promise to love
you for the rest of mine.

245
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,458
Love, dad.
- [Ryan] Aw.

246
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:25,375
- Aw.

247
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,500
Don't make me cry now!

248
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,375
I have been solid!

249
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:34,000
And this is gonna
make cry. [laughs]

250
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:36,625
- I've always been
daddy's little girl.

251
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:40,500
It's different having
a sister come in.

252
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,417
But I've had my
dad for 22 years.

253
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,792
She hasn't.

254
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,583
I know that what I have
with my dad is a good thing

255
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:49,375
and I want them to
build that, as well.

256
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,792
and I want them to
build that, as well.

257
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,542
I want them to have that.

258
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,625
And I can't wait to watch it.

259
00:09:57,458 --> 00:09:59,208
- Now you gotta get
a hug [indistinct].

260
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,375
Let's throw all this
trash. [laughing]

261
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:04,292
- [Rod] I love you.

262
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,083
[gentle music]

263
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,500
[clock ticking]

264
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,417
- This morning, Gypsy
Rose Blanchard posted

265
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,750
her first social media post

266
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,417
since being released
from prison yesterday.

267
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,708
It was a selfie on Instagram

268
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:19,333
with the caption "First
selfie of Freedom."

269
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,833
- She truly looks so happy.

270
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,000
- Gypsy Rose's family
had a welcome home party.

271
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,708
Mia captioned the
photos with saying,

272
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,167
"The sweetest, hello.

273
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:28,625
Welcome home sister."

274
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:29,750
- Some really disappointing news

275
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:31,167
just came out about Gypsy Rose

276
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,125
and her going to the
Chiefs' game tomorrow.

277
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:35,083
Unfortunately, she
will not be attending

278
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,208
because she has been ordered
to leave the state of Missouri

279
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:40,708
by her parole officer,
according to TMZ.

280
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,583
[worrisome music]

281
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,667
[jewelry clanks]
- Crap.

282
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:58,875
[pensive music]

283
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:00,875
- I'm trying to
get this necklace.

284
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,875
- I love spending
time with my husband.

285
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:10,875
We've been having sex the
last two nights. [laughing]

286
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,833
Even in here. [laughing]

287
00:11:12,917 --> 00:11:16,042
I was like, "Shut
up!" [laughing]

288
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:23,000
- Even with the
family. [laughing]

289
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:25,833
That's why I slept so
good last night. [laughs]

290
00:11:25,917 --> 00:11:26,750
- [Mia] We gotta go home.

291
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,500
I see you getting antsy.

292
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:29,667
- [Rob] Yeah.

293
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,792
- What time is y'all flight?

294
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,083
- [Mia] I'm hungry, too.
- [Rod] 12:30.

295
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:32,833
- [Gypsy] 12:30.

296
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:33,875
- So y'all be careful.

297
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,333
Have fun. Enjoy.
- Thank you.

298
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,417
- I will, I will.

299
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:39,417
- [Kristy] Yeah.

300
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:42,458
- [Gypsy] I love you.
- [Rod] Roger?

301
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:43,333
- I love you, too.
- I'll see you soon.

302
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,667
[tense music]

303
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:47,917
- [Mia] All right, love you.

304
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,250
- [Kristy] Love you, too.
- Love you.

305
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,833
From start to present,

306
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:56,208
I think it has just been a
whirlwind for me of emotions

307
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:58,958
and ups and downs.

308
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:02,042
I feel like the
stakes are high as far

309
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,083
as that I have to
do good on parole.

310
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,917
That is literally my biggest
fear is going back to prison

311
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,083
for another year and a half.

312
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:14,375
I don't wanna risk
that for anything.

313
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,208
My first priority will
always be my freedom.

314
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:21,667
[reflective music]

315
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,250
[tense music]

316
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,167
- [Ryan] You ready
for this [bleep]?

317
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,083
- [Gypsy] Yeah, I'm just
ready to get out on the road.

318
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:37,750
[tense music]

319
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,500
There's just two of 'em
right now, which is good.

320
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,125
[tense music]

321
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,958
[tense music continues]

322
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:54,542
That [bleep] is right behind me.

323
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:55,750
- Just ignore 'em.

324
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,250
[tense music]

325
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,542
- [Ryan] All right, you
gonna call the PO?

326
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:02,458
- [Gypsy] All right.

327
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:03,375
- All right, be good.

328
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,167
[phone ringing]

329
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,000
- Hi, this is Gypsy
Rose Blanchard

330
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,833
and I just wanted to call

331
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,000
and let y'all know
that we are driving

332
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,167
back to Louisiana as we speak.

333
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,750
- [Parole Officer] Alright,
I do appreciate you calling.

334
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:18,667
- [Ryan] Absolutely.
- Thank you so much.

335
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:20,000
All right, have a good day.

336
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:20,833
- [Parole Officer]
All right, thank you ma'am.

337
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:21,875
- Okay. Bye.

338
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:23,125
- [Parole Officer] Bye-bye.

339
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,250
- Yep, I just wanna keep
them on the up and up.

340
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,125
- Good, baby.

341
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:32,167
[gentle xylophone music]

342
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,500
Look at this [bleep].

343
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,500
- Yes. Paparazzi,
we were hungry.

344
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:43,625
- [Ryan] Yep.

345
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,042
- And we gotta eat, you know.

346
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,125
- Not really.

347
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,208
There's a guy taking
our picture right there.

348
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,542
Like now I'm about to
give him a closeup.

349
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:57,292
This is Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

350
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,667
- Hi.

351
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,500
- [Worker] Oh, that
must suck. I'm so sorry.

352
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:01,750
- It's okay.

353
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:02,667
- Yeah, there's nothing
that they can do.

354
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,833
- Second day out, you know,

355
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:04,833
it's something I
gotta get used to.

356
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,000
- [Worker] Yeah, how it is?

357
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,292
- You know? [laughing]
- [Worker] Here you are.

358
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:08,667
- I just wonder how
many pictures does

359
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:10,667
he actually need of us?

360
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,250
- [Worker] Well, I hope
you have a better day.

361
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,292
- Thanks, thank you, guys.
- [Gypsy] Thank you.

362
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,708
- All right, don't
eat in front of him.

363
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:20,667
- Oh.
[pensive music]

364
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:21,667
Oh, these are so good.

365
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,375
- [Ryan] Are they good, baby?

366
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,583
- They're very good.

367
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,750
- [Ryan] Good.
- Hmm.

368
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,333
I am concerned.

369
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,833
Is paparazzi gonna follow us
all the way back to Louisiana?

370
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,917
Are they gonna follow
us back to our home?

371
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,458
That's not what I want.

372
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:36,667
I think there was
a mass difference

373
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,000
of what my expectation was.

374
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,500
I expected it, but
not that intense.

375
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:44,125
[tense music]

376
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,750
[cars whirring]

377
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:51,833
I think this necklace looks
so pretty with this sweater.

378
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:52,833
- [Ryan] Oh, it's gorgeous.

379
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:54,167
I just wish my name was in it.

380
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,042
- Later on in life, I
wanna get another one

381
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,125
where I could have.

382
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:00,000
- Yeah.

383
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,250
[Ryan laughs]

384
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:07,875
[Gypsy laughs]

385
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:12,875
- [Ryan] No!

386
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,292
- "I'm so happy
she's outta prison."

387
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,125
- [Ryan] RG?

388
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,833
- [Gypsy] KU.

389
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,542
- No!
- Yes.

390
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,333
- Mother.
[Gypsy laughs]

391
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,333
And of course Kristy
let you know about it.

392
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,000
- It's not like she singled
him out and was like,

393
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,708
"By the way, Ken texted me."

394
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,417
- Too late, buddy.

395
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,250
[tense music]

396
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,167
- [Gypsy] Ken is my ex-fiance.

397
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:39,875
Ken and I first started
dating in September of 2017.

398
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,292
We were together for two years.

399
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,333
Even though he was in the free
world and I was in prison,

400
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:48,792
this was my first
actual relationship

401
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,458
that was long term.

402
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:53,833
Right before we were
gonna get married,

403
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,750
he ended the relationship.

404
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,375
It devastated me.

405
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,167
I think he pretty much
gave me every breakup line

406
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,292
you can think of in the book.

407
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,208
[tense music]

408
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,000
- Of course! Baby.

409
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,667
- I just wouldn't
have told you that.

410
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:12,750
You know what I call him?

411
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,792
Dumb mother.

412
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,208
[tense music]

413
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,333
[heavy pensive music]

414
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,667
- [Gypsy] Is that guy
still following us?

415
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,083
- Oh yeah, he's back there.

416
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:33,500
Vultures, man.

417
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,708
Another thing...

418
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,458
- Bye, thank you.
Bye-bye, go home.

419
00:16:44,542 --> 00:16:45,625
- Yes, they pulled off!

420
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,958
Yeah!

421
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,542
[suspenseful music]

422
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,958
Hey, baby, how do you feel?

423
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:56,125
We're about to be out of
the state of Missouri.

424
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,625
- Oh, I feel relieved.

425
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:00,000
- Yeah, we are so close.

426
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:02,000
- [Gypsy] I feel relieved.
[laughing]

427
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:03,792
- [Ryan] Hey look, here we go.

428
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:04,667
You see it?

429
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,667
- I see it.

430
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,792
[hand tapping] I beat you.

431
00:17:12,792 --> 00:17:14,583
- [laughing] You're so silly.

432
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,625
[Ryan laughs]

433
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:20,917
- Goodbye, Missouri.
- Yep. Goodbye, Missouri.

434
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,750
- I don't wanna be back.

435
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,125
I'm just happy to leave

436
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,750
all of that behind.

437
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,708
Go with a fresh start.

438
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:29,958
You know?

439
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,125
- New state.
- New state. New start.

440
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:34,417
- New life.
[reflective music]

441
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,667
[light bright music]

442
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:50,167
[light bright music continues]

443
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,417
- Alexa!

444
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,625
Play, "Shake It Off,"
by Taylor Swift.

445
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:02,000
- [Alexa] Should I
start your free trial

446
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:04,500
and play, "Shake It
Off," Taylor's version?

447
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,417
- Yes.

448
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:09,042
- [Alexa] You're
missing a payment method

449
00:18:09,167 --> 00:18:11,042
so I can't sign you up.

450
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,000
- [Gypsy] Are you
still unpacking?

451
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:14,875
- [Ryan] Yeah, we got
a lot to unpack, baby.

452
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,708
We got Christmas presents.

453
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:18,000
We gotta figure out

454
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,125
where we're gonna put
some of this stuff.

455
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:22,125
- What drawers would be mine?

456
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,292
- If you want this
whole thing, it's yours.

457
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:25,500
- Okay.

458
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,333
Who do you think is
gonna take up more space?

459
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:32,333
- [laughing] Not
even up for debate.

460
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:35,417
- I think a lot of
people felt like

461
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,417
I should have waited
in getting married

462
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:38,833
and I know that.

463
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:40,250
Now they feel more comfortable.

464
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,583
Like my family feels more
comfortable with Ryan.

465
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:45,333
and now that they've got
to spend time with him.

466
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:48,333
But I think my dad is skeptical.

467
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:51,000
I mean, it's
something I expected,

468
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:54,083
I expected my dad to
still have, not concerns,

469
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,333
but almost like prove it to me

470
00:18:56,417 --> 00:18:58,542
that things are gonna be okay.

471
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:02,833
But the transition from
prison relationship

472
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,625
to full-fledged marriage,

473
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,125
I feel like it's
transitioning beautifully.

474
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,125
Oh, this is so cute!

475
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,958
- [Ryan] Isn't that cute?

476
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,625
- I love this.

477
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,750
Okay, I gotta look at all the
different cat pictures now.

478
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,667
- Yep.

479
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Being home with Gypsy is great.

480
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,208
I'm glad to be
doing my own thing.

481
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,250
I got her to myself.

482
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:25,583
You know, it's funny,

483
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,667
I have been waiting a
long time to be with her.

484
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,208
So has her family.

485
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,000
And I know they're
probably a little jealous

486
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:33,417
that I got a lot of
her time and I get it

487
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,208
and I'm okay with sharing her.

488
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,292
At the same time, nobody knows
her quite as well as I do.

489
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,667
She wanted me to pick her up.

490
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,500
She wanted this, she wanted
to move here with me.

491
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,792
But like her parents are
planning on coming over tomorrow

492
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:48,208
and spending more time with
her and I'll give their time.

493
00:19:48,292 --> 00:19:49,875
You know, it's no biggie.

494
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:51,292
But that's my time too, so.

495
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,167
- I'm gonna turn on the light.

496
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:57,833
This is

497
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:00,000
a bra

498
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:02,500
that if you put
it in a nice bow,

499
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,833
it's like a Christmas
present bow.

500
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,792
And as you can see,

501
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,167
it's very short.

502
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,417
There's nothing to it.

503
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:16,792
So he bought these for me
about two and a half years ago.

504
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,750
We just started dating

505
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,833
and I think he had
like full confidence

506
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:25,208
that we would work out perfect.

507
00:20:25,292 --> 00:20:28,708
I always wanted to wear
this one for the first time,

508
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,000
but I ended up just
being like [exclaiming],

509
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:35,500
"All right, let's
do this." [chuckles]

510
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:38,500
A big part of womanhood is

511
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,875
learning to be comfortable
with our sexuality.

512
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,875
And for years I wasn't.

513
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:49,333
I'm self-conscious because I
have scars all over my body.

514
00:20:49,417 --> 00:20:52,417
And I had a lot of surgeries
that were unnecessary.

515
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,458
And so I'm like, "Am I gonna
be what he wants me to be?

516
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:58,000
Am I attractive to him?"

517
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,208
And even to the
point that I'm like,

518
00:21:02,292 --> 00:21:04,083
"Don't even look
at me down there!"

519
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,500
You know, don't because.

520
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,750
And he's like, "It's okay."

521
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:12,208
For a long time I actually
kind of like questioned

522
00:21:12,292 --> 00:21:13,792
like my own sexuality

523
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,292
because as a teenager
or a preteen,

524
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,625
I felt that I was
attracted to girls.

525
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,750
And I got to experiment
with that in prison.

526
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:26,792
I think I've kissed more
girls than I have guys.

527
00:21:28,292 --> 00:21:30,333
I had such big fears
that I was like,

528
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,708
"What happens if I'm
just not gonna like sex?"

529
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,458
I feel like I don't
have a sex drive.

530
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:38,417
There is a rule against
masturbation in prison.

531
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,000
Not only do you have the risk of

532
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,333
if you get caught masturbating,

533
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,375
but for me, I can go six
months and just be fine.

534
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,292
And I'm like, what
happens if I just,

535
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,917
I'm not a sexual being?

536
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,750
And so I'm discovering
things about myself.

537
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,500
I'm like, I'm a
freak! [laughing]

538
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:58,958
[light rhythmic music]

539
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,583
- All right, we got a couple
special treats for y'all.

540
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:06,250
- All right.

541
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,292
Some non-alcoholic.

542
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:09,708
- [Rod] And then sparkling rose.

543
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,833
- Stuff.

544
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,458
Okay, I'm gonna love
the sparkling rose.

545
00:22:12,542 --> 00:22:13,833
- That's what I figured.

546
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:14,833
Because it's you.

547
00:22:16,958 --> 00:22:18,375
Gypsy's never had steak before

548
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,583
so I made sure to get
a nice cut of ribeye.

549
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,792
- Been while since I got a kiss.

550
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:24,583
[lips smacking]

551
00:22:24,667 --> 00:22:25,458
- Hmm.
- Thank you.

552
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:26,417
- Give me another one.

553
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,708
[lips smacking]
Hmm.

554
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:31,125
[Rod] All right, you
ready to do this?

555
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:33,458
Thank you.

556
00:22:33,583 --> 00:22:34,792
- Can I tell you something

557
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:37,042
that I've never told
you guys before?

558
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,250
- [Kristy] Tell me.

559
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:42,333
So you remember
whenever you and dad

560
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,708
came to my wheelchair games,

561
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:48,333
you know the wheelchair
races that I was in?

562
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:52,500
So after,

563
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,750
when y'all left,

564
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:58,750
my mom said that dad was
making fun of me and that-

565
00:22:59,917 --> 00:23:01,292
- Like, as if.
- I know.

566
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:06,333
But she said, "This is why I
don't invite them to anything

567
00:23:07,417 --> 00:23:08,458
because you know
what your dad said?"

568
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,083
And I said, "What?"

569
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,125
She's like, "He
called you a retard."

570
00:23:13,208 --> 00:23:15,000
[tense music]

571
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,500
- No, that's how she saw you.

572
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,083
And we didn't see you like that.

573
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,625
Never once!

574
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:24,375
Never once would we-

575
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:25,208
- And it-

576
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:25,708
- And it-

577
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:26,667
- [Kristy] But it
just goes to show.

578
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,000
- Yeah.

579
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:30,542
- [Kristy] You know how much
she tried to pull you away.

580
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,625
- It's like it was just
comment after comment

581
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:35,375
and after so many years,
comments build up.

582
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,375
- [Kristy] Yeah.
- You know?

583
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,833
And opinions are formed, so.

584
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:39,792
- [Kristy] Yeah.

585
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:44,667
- I wish that my mom could
have been honest with me.

586
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,792
I mean, she twists
things in stories

587
00:23:47,875 --> 00:23:51,417
to make herself seem
holier art than now.

588
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,042
But with my dad,

589
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,250
I think we're headed to a
really, really good place.

590
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,917
I think we're in
a good place now,

591
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:58,958
but I think we're gonna be able
to foster that relationship

592
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:01,083
we always wanted to
have with each other.

593
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:03,708
- [Rod] Where's the beef?

594
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:04,750
- [Gypsy] Take a picture
with me and the steak.

595
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,250
- [Kristy] Take more than one.

596
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,583
[gentle banjo music]

597
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,458
- Lord God, heavenly
Father, we gather tonight

598
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:12,667
to give you thanks, Lord.

599
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,917
Thanks for bringing
Gypsy back home to us.

600
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,792
In Jesus' name, Amen.

601
00:24:15,875 --> 00:24:16,542
- [All] Amen.

602
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,125
- All right.

603
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,000
- Very nice.

604
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,417
- Oh, yeah, this is amazing.

605
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,708
Mmm-hmm.

606
00:24:22,792 --> 00:24:24,250
- [Kristy] Aurora's gonna beg.

607
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,083
She'll be looking
straight at you, Dad.

608
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:29,208
[all laughing]

609
00:24:29,333 --> 00:24:31,917
[gentle music]
[inaudible dialogue]

610
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:35,958
- [Gypsy] So I was thinking
about wearing this.

611
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:38,500
It's a shame we don't
wear the same size.

612
00:24:38,625 --> 00:24:39,792
Try to do it before-

613
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:40,875
- And the shoes.

614
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:42,708
- [Kristy] Ooh, that's
gonna look nice.

615
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:43,583
- I know!

616
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,917
- You've come a long way.

617
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:47,542
- Mmm-hmm.

618
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:50,708
[reflective music]

619
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:57,208
- When I was fixing her makeup
and she closed her eyes,

620
00:24:58,417 --> 00:24:59,875
all I saw was Mia.

621
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,708
And that's when I
was like, "Oh my God,

622
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,208
You know, I could have been
helping you with everything."

623
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:09,333
And to be able

624
00:25:09,417 --> 00:25:13,125
for a dream to
become a reality is

625
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:15,958
unmeasurable.

626
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:19,750
Look, see?
- I like that. Yeah.

627
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:22,000
- Rub.

628
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,750
Go. Up and down, up down.

629
00:25:24,833 --> 00:25:26,000
There you go. There you go.

630
00:25:26,042 --> 00:25:27,500
[Gypsy laughing]

631
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,167
You see, y'all
learning the tricks.

632
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,667
You see how it makes it look?

633
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,458
A little more
pronounced, you know?

634
00:25:33,542 --> 00:25:34,333
- Yeah.

635
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:35,167
Oh, the necklace.

636
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,708
- I have never been
dressed like this before.

637
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,208
You know, looking
at myself right now,

638
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:52,500
like I never thought that I'd
look this pretty, you know?

639
00:25:54,083 --> 00:25:55,125
This is just not something

640
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:58,167
that I ever saw for
myself. [laughing]

641
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,917
I guess I just, I
knew that my mom

642
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,042
would never let
me look like this.

643
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:08,833
Having long hair

644
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,792
and wearing a really
low cut dress.

645
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:15,792
I'm not used to
looking in the mirror

646
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,667
and liking how I look.

647
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,542
So this is definitely

648
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:21,042
a little bit of a shock.

649
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:24,542
Kind of like a little
Cinderella moment. [laughing]

650
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,167
I'm killing it! [laughs]

651
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,667
[gentle reflective music]

652
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,042
- [Rod] Oh, wow.
- [Ryan] Wow.

653
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:41,208
- Gorgeous!

654
00:26:42,375 --> 00:26:43,667
Sparkly.

655
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,708
Gypsy Rose Blanchard Anderson.

656
00:26:48,208 --> 00:26:49,542
[men exclaiming]

657
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,292
You look beautiful.

658
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,167
- How do I look?

659
00:26:51,208 --> 00:26:53,333
- Oh my God.

660
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:54,708
That's my wife.
- I know.

661
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:55,708
This is your wife.

662
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,583
- [Kristy] That is your wife.

663
00:26:57,708 --> 00:26:59,250
- What you whatcha
gonna do about it.

664
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,708
[Kristy laughing]

665
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:01,375
- [Kristy] He's like,
I'm gonna [indistinct].

666
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,417
- You look so good.

667
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,250
I love the necklace you got on.

668
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:04,500
- Thank you.

669
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,875
- [Kristy] She has on
her dad's necklace.

670
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,208
- Yeah, this is the
necklace that dad got me.

671
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,500
Yeah.

672
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:10,625
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

673
00:27:10,708 --> 00:27:11,500
- [Rod] All right,
Ryan, come around.

674
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:12,958
I wanna do a toast.

675
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:13,667
- [Gypsy] Okay.

676
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,708
- I just wanna say a few words.

677
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,000
Ryan, you're a good guy.

678
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:17,958
I like your family.

679
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:19,875
Gypsy, I'm so proud of you.

680
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,792
You've come so far, darling.

681
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:24,125
I love you so much and
I'm just [heavily sighs].

682
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,250
I'm so happy for you.

683
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,583
- Thank you, daddy.

684
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:32,500
- So to y'all wedding
and your new life.

685
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,667
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

686
00:27:33,708 --> 00:27:35,167
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

687
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,208
- All right. Let's party.

688
00:27:36,292 --> 00:27:37,333
Let's dance!
- Woo.

689
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:38,542
- Thanks, Dad.

[gentle reflective music]

691
00:27:43,542 --> 00:27:44,583
- [Rod] 10.

00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,000
- [All] Nine.

693
00:27:46,042 --> 00:27:46,833
Eight.

00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:26,792
Done. Fine.

891
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:30,750
[curious music]

892
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,250
You're hovering.

893
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:34,917
Thank you.

894
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,458
[Ryan groans]

895
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,250
[curious music]

896
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,000
- [Ryan] I don't know, babe.

897
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:43,458
Like I would love for
you to have the dog.

898
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:44,833
- Mmm-hmm.
- When I'm at work.

899
00:35:44,917 --> 00:35:46,125
- [Gypsy] I don't
see any issues.

900
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,000
- I mean, it's a lot
of responsibility.

901
00:35:48,042 --> 00:35:49,167
- I mean, I don't
see any issues.

902
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,875
I stay at home.
- True.

903
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,042
- While you're at work.

904
00:35:52,167 --> 00:35:54,000
It's not like I'm
going to a nine to five

905
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:55,500
and leaving the puppy by itself.

906
00:35:55,542 --> 00:35:57,875
I'm gonna be here at the
apartment by myself, so.

907
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,917
- And you want a puppy, puppy?

908
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:01,333
- Mmm-hmm.

909
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,875
- [Ryan] You wanna start
from the ground up?

910
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,167
- Yeah.

911
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,250
- [Ryan] What do
you wanna name it?

912
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:07,458
- Oh, we haven't
even picked one out,

913
00:36:07,542 --> 00:36:09,208
let alone ready for a name.

914
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:12,292
- True.

915
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:13,708
I say we call it hormonal.

916
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,708
- I'm not hormonal.

917
00:36:16,792 --> 00:36:18,333
I'm just a woman.

918
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,625
- Okay, well let's
call it a woman.

919
00:36:20,708 --> 00:36:21,667
- No.

920
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:22,875
- Okay.

921
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,000
Because at an apartment, baby,

922
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,083
you have to take 'em for walks.

923
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:27,333
- Dang it.

924
00:36:27,458 --> 00:36:28,708
- And you have to
pick up their pee

925
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,333
and you have to pick up
their poop and stuff.

926
00:36:30,458 --> 00:36:32,042
- Mmm-hmm. I'm not an idiot.

927
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,042
I know how to care for a dog.

928
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,833
- I didn't say
you were an idiot.

929
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:41,042
Baby, I didn't say
you were an idiot.

930
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:43,667
[tense music]

931
00:36:46,042 --> 00:36:48,583
[door slams]

932
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:56,333
[tense music]

933
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,667
I didn't call you
an idiot, baby.

934
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:00,250
- [Gypsy] Why are you
treating me like one?

935
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,708
- [Ryan] I'm not.

936
00:37:04,208 --> 00:37:05,667
I'm not.

937
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:07,083
- [Gypsy] That's the kind of
[bleep] that you tell a child.

938
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,500
"It's a lot of
responsibility, you know?"

939
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,625
[somber music]

940
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:12,125
- Baby, you're gonna
be great with a dog.

941
00:37:12,208 --> 00:37:13,000
I'm all for it.

942
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,500
I think you're gonna
do great with it.

943
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:24,583
- [Gypsy] I've had
animals before.

944
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:25,458
- I know.

945
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:29,167
- Just, please, don't
treat me like I'm a child.

946
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:31,500
Like I don't know
what I'm doing.

947
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,542
I know a dog is a lot
of responsibility.

948
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,917
I'll walk it, I'll feed
it, I'll do everything.

949
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:38,917
Like...

950
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:40,333
- Okay, sweetie.

951
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:41,500
- I think a lot of people,

952
00:37:41,583 --> 00:37:43,583
they have this perception of me

953
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:48,583
that just because I have
not experienced something,

954
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,208
that attributes to
being childlike.

955
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:53,583
And for me, it's not.

956
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:56,125
My mother used to
treat me like a child

957
00:37:56,125 --> 00:37:58,792
and she wanted me to be a child.

958
00:37:58,875 --> 00:37:59,875
I'm not stupid.

959
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,667
You don't have to talk
to me like I'm stupid.

960
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:03,958
It irritates me.

961
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:09,792
- I never treat
you like an idiot.

962
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,500
I never have.

963
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,667
You know, I get mad when
people treat you like that.

964
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,708
- I know.

965
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,542
And you are starting
to act like them.

966
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,125
- I'm walking a thin
line with Gypsy.

967
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,458
Like I want her to live her life

968
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:24,167
and I don't wanna be a
controlling husband and I'm not.

969
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:25,542
But it's one of those things

970
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:28,000
that if I say something that
a normal husband would say,

971
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:30,333
then I'm like controlling
her and I'm like her mother.

972
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:32,417
And it's like, whoa,
that's not fair.

973
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,833
Any little thing
could be a trigger.

974
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,875
I got things in my
past that trigger me.

975
00:38:38,958 --> 00:38:40,708
You know, like, I don't
like being abandoned.

976
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:42,708
I like knowing that
people are there for me.

977
00:38:42,833 --> 00:38:46,333
You know, I get
where she comes from.

978
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:47,542
How are you not cold?

979
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,958
I'm over here freezing
my [bleep] off.

980
00:38:52,042 --> 00:38:53,333
- Because I'm mad!

981
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:56,083
- I apologize if you think I
was treating you like a kid

982
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,708
'cause I'm not meaning to.

983
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,833
- Thank you.

984
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,333
We haven't had major conflict,

985
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:03,833
but in the little
tiffs that we've had,

986
00:39:04,708 --> 00:39:07,583
I'm pretty open about
what I'm mad about.

987
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,500
I don't wanna be controlled.

988
00:39:09,542 --> 00:39:11,500
I push back 10 times harder

989
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,458
if I feel like I'm
being controlled.

990
00:39:14,417 --> 00:39:17,000
I didn't back then with my mom

991
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:19,042
and there was so many
times that I could have,

992
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:20,083
but I was so scared.

993
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,583
Now? Bring it!

994
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:23,958
'Cause I got that
confidence now.

995
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,583
[tense music]

996
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,667
Nobody ever said this
was gonna be easy,

997
00:39:31,792 --> 00:39:33,917
you know, I love
her unconditionally

998
00:39:34,042 --> 00:39:37,583
and you know, I'm just happy
to be along for the ride.

999
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,500
No matter what me
and Gypsy go through,

1000
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,750
we will always come
together in the end.

1001
00:39:41,833 --> 00:39:43,125
[dramatic music]

1002
00:39:43,208 --> 00:39:46,500
- I'm more nervous about the
PO meeting than New York.

1003
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:49,333
Literally my biggest fear
is going back to prison.

1004
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,250
- We're gonna get on
the [bleep] flight.

1005
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,333
You better get
in the other lane.

1006
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:54,833
- He's got it. [groans]

1007
00:39:54,917 --> 00:39:57,750
- [Ryan] So baby you excited
to go shoot at The View?

1008
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:58,542
- I'm nervous.

1009
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,167
- The attention on social media,

1010
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:04,042
like I'm not used to it at all.

1011
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:07,083
- [Ryan] Very quick.
- [Gypsy] Right quick.

1012
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:10,792
Ken texted my stepmom.

1013
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:14,625
- Why do you think he decided
it's time to pop back up?

1014
00:40:14,708 --> 00:40:17,417
- I don't think that he has
respect for my marriage.

1015
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,417
- He doesn't like me.

1016
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,667
- I go into my messages

1017
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,542
and I will have death threats.

1018
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:25,375
Am I at risk for
dangerous people?

1019
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,417
I'm feeling a lot of stress

1020
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,292
from everything else
going on right now.

1021
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,083
- I just want to have
a family with you.

1022
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:35,250
- Is this the life that we
really wanna lead for ourselves?

1023
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,083
[dramatic music]
