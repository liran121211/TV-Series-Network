1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,458
- I was in prison, restricted,

2
00:00:03,458 --> 00:00:06,000
now I'm getting all glammed
up and I'm in New York City.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,042
I was engaged once before.

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,750
- To Ken?
- Yeah, to Ken.

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,750
The day that I got outta
prison, Ken texted my stepmom

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,875
and I'm like, "You know he's

7
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,333
sniffing around."

8
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,458
- Gypsy is amazing, you know,
it's so cliché, you know,

9
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,292
like baby you complete
me, but she really does.

10
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:25,042
- So this will be where
all of your tables

11
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:26,458
are set up for the reception.

12
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:27,708
- [Ryan] That place
was beautiful.

13
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:30,542
- Yeah. But the timing needs
to be at a little bit of

14
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,208
a more convenient time.

15
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,708
I was close with my
mother's side of the family

16
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,167
when I was really little,

17
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,625
but I think that I have
bonds to mend still.

18
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,083
I know I didn't turn out
how you wanted me to.

19
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,667
He sent me a lot of pictures.

20
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:51,083
He mailed them to me.

21
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:55,208
- Kristy has continued
conversation with Ken.

22
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:57,167
Sorry dude, you had
your shot, move on.

23
00:00:58,167 --> 00:01:00,167
- Ken is single.

24
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,625
What's gonna happen when
Ryan and I have an argument?

25
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,542
[tense dramatic music]

26
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,542
[soft music]

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
[Gypsy sighs]

28
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:27,417
I can't sleep.

29
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,375
I had a nightmare about my mom.

30
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,167
Snuck out of bed while
Ryan was still asleep.

31
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,167
So I came out on the patio.

32
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:40,708
[sirens in background]

33
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,542
Thinking about that house.

34
00:01:47,417 --> 00:01:49,583
Thinking about the
coulda, shoulda, wouldas.

35
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,542
It's not easy to
live with, guys.

36
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:15,917
- Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

37
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,000
Nightmares I've had for,

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,583
since my crime.

39
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:22,417
So, and I mean, it's not
always about the crime,

40
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:25,000
it's about my life with my mom.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,167
It always involves my mom.

42
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:31,917
There's nothing that I could
do to stop the nightmares.

43
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:34,167
It's my psyche going over things

44
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:35,333
that I wish I could have

45
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,250
or should have done differently.

46
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,250
And so I just keep
going back to that.

47
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,375
[tense suspenseful music]

48
00:02:43,375 --> 00:02:46,208
It was my choice to
commit this crime.

49
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,208
I don't even know

50
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,542
like the road to
self-forgiveness.

51
00:02:49,542 --> 00:02:53,750
Like, like who shows
you the first step?

52
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,208
[clock ticks]

53
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:59,292
- Gypsy Rose Blanchard
suffered horrible abuse

54
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,542
at the hands of her mother.

55
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:02,667
- She destroyed Gypsy's
computer and phone

56
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,500
and then she chained her
to her bed with handcuffs.

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,917
- This is not Gypsy Rose
Blanchard's belly button.

58
00:03:07,917 --> 00:03:10,042
This is actually
a scar left over

59
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:13,125
from the feeding tube that
Gypsy Rose Blanchard's mother

60
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,375
forced her to have.

61
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,792
- She was fed very little,

62
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:17,625
forced to go to the
bathroom on herself.

63
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:21,458
And Dee Dee also connected a
dog leash to Gypsy and herself

64
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,875
so she would feel any time
Gypsy moved in the night.

65
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,417
- Gypsy says that she is
looking forward to a new life

66
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:28,417
and a new start now that
she's out of prison.

67
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,458
[cars humming past]

68
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,917
[soft music]

69
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,667
- I've only been
here what, once?

70
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:52,750
I've only been here once and
it looks completely different.

71
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,375
- Yeah.
- Like completely different.

72
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,125
It looks like a different house.

73
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,625
- Yeah, we've done a lot

74
00:03:58,625 --> 00:03:59,667
- Uh huh.

75
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:03,333
- I don't know,
it's kind of crazy.

76
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:04,625
Like, I don't know,

77
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,375
I've been having a picture
of me and her in there

78
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:07,958
since like middle school.

79
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,417
Like she's my sister, you know?

80
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:11,375
I wanted her in there

81
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:12,708
and like she has short
hair in the picture

82
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,417
and she's in a
wheelchair holding me

83
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:15,750
and now like she's
walking through the house

84
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,708
and she's not in a
wheelchair no more.

85
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,125
- [Rod] Let's go!

86
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,292
- [Mia] Are y'all
just going ride?

87
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:22,583
- We're going to
stop at the cemetery

88
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,500
so she can see her
grandmother, Emma.

89
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,042
And we're gonna go through
the Golden Meadow Park.

90
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,333
Yeah.

91
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,083
- I think I know
where Mama's grave is.

92
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,708
- Really?

93
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,875
- Yeah. I haven't been to her
grave since I was like 10, so.

94
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,667
- Would you like to bring
some flowers or anything?

95
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:37,792
- Yeah, that would be nice.
- [Rod] All right, let's go.

96
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:40,375
[gentle music]

97
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:46,792
Golden Meadow baby. Look.

98
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,958
- [Gypsy] Yeah, this used
to be my favorite park

99
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,625
in Golden Meadow.

100
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,458
Like this used to be my
favorite spot as a kid.

101
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,042
- I think it was a lot
of our favorite spots.

102
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:56,333
- [Gypsy] Yeah.

103
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,417
- [Rod] Like in the
spring it's really nice.

104
00:04:57,417 --> 00:04:59,542
You can go park under
those oak trees.

105
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:01,875
- [Kristy] Yeah.

106
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,000
- Y'all want to stop
right here for a minute

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,958
and maybe take a picture?

108
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,167
- [Gypsy] All right.

109
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:06,958
- [Rod] Under the
trees right here maybe?

110
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:07,750
All right.

111
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,208
- Hey.
[lips smack]

112
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,167
- You liked this park as a kid?

113
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:15,000
- Yeah, I did.

114
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:22,042
My mom used to take me here
when I was really little.

115
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:24,208
It was one, I don't remember
much from my childhood,

116
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,333
but this is like
my favorite spot.

117
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:30,208
It was such a simpler
time when I was little.

118
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:33,250
Like nothing was complicated.

119
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,750
The things, I mean, my
life was complicated,

120
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,083
but my perception
of my life wasn't.

121
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,625
Like all I knew
is mommy loved me.

122
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,708
Grandma loved me, Papa loved me,

123
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,958
my aunts and uncles loved
me, my cousins loved me,

124
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,042
and that's all I knew.

125
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,042
- [Ryan] That's cool.

126
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,250
- Who's gonna take a picture?

127
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,792
- Go ahead and get in
there with your people.

128
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:55,708
They are my people now, too.
They my family, too, so.

129
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:57,375
- Yeah. You're
part of the tribe.

130
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,833
- [Ryan] I'm part
of the family now.

131
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:01,667
All right.

132
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:05,667
I like it.

133
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,583
- [Rod] Okay,
let's go. We gotta go.

134
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,708
Remember I said your mom

135
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,125
and I got back together
for a little while?

136
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,458
- {Gypsy] Uh-huh.

137
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:21,042
Me and Dee Dee lived, I
think it was this street.

138
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:23,417
- [Ryan] There's a
little spot right here.

139
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,875
- I can't quite remember man.

140
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,292
It was one of these little
houses in this neighborhood.

141
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:28,375
I'm not exactly sure.

142
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,708
- I'll never know.

143
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:31,333
- We didn't, it was
like three months.

144
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,333
Okay. And I was trawling so I
might have spent a week there,

145
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,708
you know?

146
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:41,208
But that's when you had
the breathing machine.

147
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:43,042
- [Gypsy] Oh yeah.
- [Rod] Yep.

148
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:44,625
- [Gypsy] That's what
came first, wasn't it?

149
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,042
The sleep apnea machine?

150
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,667
- [Rod] The sleep apnea
was the first, the first thing.

151
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:48,958
- [Ryan] How old were you?

152
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,583
- She used to tell me.
- I was little little.

153
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:52,833
- She used to put
you sleeping on her.

154
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,875
- God baby. She put you
in that sleep apnea machine

155
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,583
that young?
- [Gypsy] Yeah, very little.

156
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,875
- That's terrible.

157
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:01,917
- It wasn't easy to
sleep with all that [bleep].

158
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,583
[gentle music]

159
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:12,375
- Straight up in the front.

160
00:07:15,917 --> 00:07:18,500
Okay. I'm gonna let you
go do your thing, Gypsy.

161
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:29,042
- My grandma Emma, we
all call her Mama Emma.

162
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,417
But I called her Momsy.

163
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,583
She was a great grandmother.

164
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:35,708
And from what I
remember, you know,

165
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:38,167
she always said I was the
favorite grandkid to me.

166
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,875
And she would dress me up in
these little frou-frou dresses

167
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,417
with the cute little
socks and everything.

168
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:47,917
And I think I was
seven when she passed.

169
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:50,417
And like, that's when
my mother really started

170
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,042
to spiral out of control.

171
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:57,083
Like I remember my mom
was so angry at God

172
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,958
when my grandmother passed away

173
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,875
she took all the angel statues
that she had in the house

174
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:05,125
and just was smashing
them on the ground.

175
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:07,042
She was devastated.

176
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:13,208
My mom always wanted to be
buried with my grandma Emma.

177
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,500
Like if it was in my control,

178
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,208
I would've done that right away.

179
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:22,583
But I need to do something
to get a sense of closure.

180
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:25,667
Hey Mama.

181
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:29,875
[sad gentle music]

182
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,833
We had good memories
together when I was a kid.

183
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,833
- Yeah.

184
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:39,125
- This is my husband Ryan.

185
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,875
And he's a sweetheart.
You would've liked him.

186
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,125
He treats me good.

187
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,167
He cooks a great gumbo.

188
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,750
I know I didn't turn out
how you wanted me to,

189
00:08:56,792 --> 00:09:00,708
but you know I love you

190
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,917
and I know you wished
better for me and my mom.

191
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,875
I wanted to put
Mama where you are.

192
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:17,417
Unfortunately that was a little
something outta my control.

193
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:22,625
And I'm hoping that you
and her are in heaven.

194
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,625
She could be at peace finally

195
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:29,083
and feel the love that she
needed to feel all along.

196
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:31,250
So, I love you, Mama.

197
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,875
I feel like I failed
her as a granddaughter

198
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:36,542
I feel like I failed
her as a granddaughter

199
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,250
and I'm sorry that

200
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:42,042
I made the mistakes that I did.

201
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:50,833
[gentle music]

202
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,542
- [Gypsy] This wind is kicking.

203
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:57,917
- [Bobby] What's going on?

204
00:09:58,875 --> 00:09:59,708
- Hi!

205
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:01,875
- Gypsy!

206
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,292
- Hey!
- Good to finally see you.

207
00:10:03,292 --> 00:10:04,208
- You too.

208
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,208
- I was close with my
mother's side of the family

209
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,708
when I was really little,

210
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,708
but I think that I have
bonds to mend still.

211
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,625
I'm a big believer in that

212
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,458
it's like never too
late to do that.

213
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,458
Is this where you live?

214
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,083
- [Bobby] Yeah, I live here.

215
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,458
- [Gypsy] Oh, okay.

216
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,208
- [Bobby] So this is
my dog and my cat.

217
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,833
- [Gypsy] Aw. Hello!

218
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,125
- The last time I seen
Gypsy, she was four years old

219
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,208
and she was pushing other
kids around in the wheelchair.

220
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:37,125
My parents, my dad really,
he knew some things.

221
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,500
He would hear hearsay
from the aunts, you know,

222
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,542
from his two sisters.

223
00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:41,792
They would tell us, you know,

224
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,208
"Gypsy's going back
into the hospital.

225
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,708
She's got another surgery."

226
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,792
So I just knew her as
being a sickly kid.

227
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:48,542
I really didn't know much else.

228
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:49,875
It's been a long time.

229
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,375
- You know that I,

230
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:54,083
whenever I was going through
my mom's wallet, like,

231
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,875
or whenever she would
pull credit cards out,

232
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,708
she kept a picture of you.

233
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:58,792
- [Bobby] Yeah?

234
00:10:58,792 --> 00:10:59,667
- In the back of her wallet.

235
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:00,667
A little wallet size.

236
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:01,542
- Yeah.
- [Gypsy] Her whole life.

237
00:11:01,542 --> 00:11:02,542
- We were good friends.

238
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,833
We were really good friends.

239
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,625
Like as far as I thought anyway.

240
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,333
- [Gypsy] Mm-hmm.

241
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,417
- [Bobby] Like she was like, she
was closer to my age, you know?

242
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,125
- Yeah.

243
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:11,542
- So all the other aunts were
like my older aunts, you know?

244
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,042
- Yeah.

245
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:15,792
From what I gather,
everyone of the family

246
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:16,958
keeps on telling me

247
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,583
that they knew my
mom was different.

248
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,417
Like by different,
what did they mean

249
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:23,750
when they say different?

250
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,708
- It was like she was
bipolar or something.

251
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,583
- She actually was
diagnosed with bipolar.

252
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:28,833
- Oh yeah. Look, one day

253
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:31,583
your mom was still
very much a teenager

254
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,708
and we were on the trampoline

255
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:36,750
and would peel open this orange

256
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,458
and she picks off this
one little whatever,

257
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:40,750
a little pocket,

258
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,792
little packet of, and
so it's sitting there

259
00:11:42,792 --> 00:11:44,750
and she's talking to
it like it's a baby

260
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,000
or something like that.

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,917
And she's real genuine about it.

262
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:49,417
- What?

263
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,750
- And like she's going on, she's
like it's name and whatever

264
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,708
and then how much she's
gonna love it and treat it

265
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:56,042
and then just smashes it
and then she takes off

266
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:58,375
and I'm like, what the
the [bleep] was that?

267
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,833
- What?

268
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:01,583
- Yeah. But it was just so
traumatic to me as a kid

269
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,625
'cause I was buying
her little story,

270
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,125
whatever she was
saying, you know?

271
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,625
- Well sometimes whenever
you're a young kid like that,

272
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,542
we hear things and we see things

273
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,125
and things go on and
we're kind of like,

274
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,042
we don't really pay
attention to it.

275
00:12:13,042 --> 00:12:15,792
Like when my mom would
say she heard voices,

276
00:12:15,792 --> 00:12:17,667
I should have told
someone then like,

277
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,125
"Hey, mommy hears voices."

278
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,042
- [Bobby] Yeah.

279
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,375
- But at that young of a age,

280
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,000
I didn't wanna make her
feel bad about herself.

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,583
It's just kind of like,

282
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:27,042
what do you say when
you're that young?

283
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:30,125
You know, family member
after family member was like,

284
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,875
"We knew your mom was weird."

285
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,500
She was different, but that's
all they attributed it to.

286
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,333
I mean, I knew there was
times that like she saw shapes

287
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,083
and she heard voices.

288
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,542
But growing up I
didn't even know

289
00:12:42,542 --> 00:12:44,667
what mental illness
was back then.

290
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,250
In the family that I grew up in,

291
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,375
there wasn't much education
about mental health,

292
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,042
therapy, and things like this.

293
00:12:52,042 --> 00:12:54,583
So there was not that foundation

294
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,708
of an understanding
enough about it

295
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,792
to know how to
help the situation.

296
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:02,333
- I didn't know how
far it had gotten

297
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:03,792
because like I say, I hadn't
seen her since you were four.

298
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:05,583
And once in a while I
get a little snippet of,

299
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:06,917
okay, Gypsy's doing this.

300
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,375
She's back in the hospital.

301
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,500
I remember Kristy come
and get tattooed with me

302
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,542
and she was talking about you
being in the Special Olympics

303
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:15,417
and I was just like, "Yeah,
of course, she could walk.

304
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:18,542
Of course she's dominating at
Special Olympics," you know?

305
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:19,833
[Gypsy laughing]

306
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,875
But I don't know why
she hadn't stepped up

307
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,375
and said anything
about, you know,

308
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,917
there was so many
people that failed you.

309
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:30,333
- Now after the fact, I've
been told multiple times

310
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,625
"We knew something
was a little off,"

311
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,708
or "We suspected,"

312
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,125
and I'm like,

313
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:37,875
"Well, could I ask why
didn't you say anything?"

314
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,875
And they're like, "We
just didn't wanna risk

315
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,292
upsetting your mom."

316
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:44,000
- Yeah. Well I was second
guessing my own mind

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,042
because after seeing
just pictures of you,

318
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,750
tubes in your mouth, you
know, tubes down your throat.

319
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,625
So I'm starting to think
maybe I'm [bleep] up,

320
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:53,542
maybe I'm wrong.

321
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,708
Maybe she can't walk.

322
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,042
Or maybe Dee Dee
has told her so long

323
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:59,458
that she can't walk,

324
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,917
that she really physically
can't do it anymore.

325
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:03,958
Like her mind is triggered
the whole situation itself.

326
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:05,167
Her legs completely.

327
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,875
- Have you talked to anybody
from that side of the family

328
00:14:08,875 --> 00:14:12,208
about how they feel about me

329
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:15,792
and having
communication with me?

330
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,375
- No, not so much.

331
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:21,500
I can't see how they don't
see your side of the story.

332
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,833
You know what I'm saying?

333
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,708
Like they, or maybe
they just shut it off

334
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,375
because they feel a certain way,

335
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:28,917
that's their baby sister.
You know what I'm saying?

336
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:30,875
- Yeah. Of course.

337
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,250
I have my perception,

338
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
but other people
have theirs too.

339
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,000
So it's nice to kind of
listen and take it in.

340
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,125
I can't undo the past, you know?

341
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,333
All I can do is move forward.

342
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,917
I mean, but it was
so good to catch up.

343
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:43,708
- It was so great catching up.

344
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,708
- Talking to you.

345
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,458
- We got so much
more living to do.

346
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,750
- I know.

347
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,625
- [Bobby] Let's get
some pain going.

348
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,042
- Okay. Oh, I'm nervous.

349
00:14:49,042 --> 00:14:50,875
I want to have my
cousin tattoo me

350
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,375
because I always said if I
get a tattoo, number one,

351
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,042
I want it to mean something
and I want Bobby to do it

352
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,833
because he had did my mother's,

353
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,792
he did my dad's,
he did Kristy's.

354
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,250
He's done my cousins.

355
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,542
So it's like a family thing.

356
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:05,167
Like he's the tattoo artist.

357
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:07,333
He's the place to go.

358
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,042
- [Bobby] Do you like the
size of the fleur-de-lis

359
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,125
as opposed to this?

360
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:12,708
- Yeah, I like that.

361
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,250
- [Bobby] Okay.

362
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,417
- So I'm getting a unalome
with a fleur-de-lis on top.

363
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,375
The unalome is a symbol for
basically life's journey.

364
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:25,625
So it means that the twist
and turns of life happens.

365
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,875
That's part of our journey,

366
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,375
but it doesn't make
it any less beautiful.

367
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,958
And the fleur-de-lis is
obviously for French culture,

368
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,042
which I am Cajun, so.
[Gypsy laughs]

369
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,875
Yeah.

370
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,042
This is my first one.

371
00:15:37,042 --> 00:15:37,917
- [Producer] It's
your first tattoo?

372
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,875
- It's my first tattoo.

373
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,542
- [Bobby] Her first
professional tattoo.

374
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,917
- I have a pick 'n poke
that I did in prison.

375
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,667
- You gotta sharpen up a staple.

376
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:50,042
Yeah.

377
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,542
Take some gel pen ink and
drive it into yourself.

378
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:56,333
- Yeah. This one right
here. It was a K for my ex.

379
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,375
Once he dumped me I was like,
this freaking K needs to go.

380
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,333
- Yeah. Scrubbing
off with Brillo.

381
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:03,042
- Yeah. Scrubbing
off with Brillo.

382
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:05,333
- I may have to make
another appointment.

383
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,083
[gentle music]
[Gypsy laughing]

384
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:18,083
- [Gypsy] I'm gonna
get comfortable.

385
00:16:20,375 --> 00:16:22,708
- [Ryan] Oh, that's what
it's gonna look like, huh?

386
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:23,625
- [Gypsy] Yeah.

387
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,750
- You excited?

388
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,417
Oh, that's gonna be beautiful.

389
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,042
That is beautiful.

390
00:16:29,042 --> 00:16:30,875
You got this.

391
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,958
[tattoo machine whirrs]

392
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,750
- Ever thought about
getting big tattoos or no?

393
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,708
- No, I never thought about it.

394
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,417
I've had my fair
share of labs and IVs

395
00:16:44,792 --> 00:16:48,875
and tests and over the course
of eight and a half years,

396
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,375
I think my threshold
for pain has shortened.

397
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:56,417
But the tattoo is less painful

398
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:59,125
than the labs that I had.
[Gypsy chuckles]

399
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:03,458
- [Bobby] Some people say

400
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:04,792
tattoos hurt
more than childbirth.

401
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,792
I don't believe that.

402
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:06,917
- I don't know.

403
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:09,125
I haven't experienced
the other yet.

404
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:10,542
- [Bobby] That makes two of us.

405
00:17:10,542 --> 00:17:12,125
- [Gypsy] I think it hurts
less than the pick 'n poke

406
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,375
that I did.

407
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,667
Is that it?

408
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,667
- [Gypsy] Oh my God.
That wasn't bad at all.

409
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,542
- [Bobby] No, I told you
it wasn't gonna be nothing.

410
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,250
- I wouldn't go that
far but it wasn't bad.

411
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,375
- The pain will wear
off and you'll be like,

412
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,708
"All right, what
can I get next?"

413
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:26,875
[Gypsy laughs]

414
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,042
- I'm so proud of myself.

415
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:29,667
I got a tattoo.
[laughing]

416
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:34,208
Like definitely a moment of
independence right now for me.

417
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:36,417
Like I never thought
that I'd get a tattoo.

418
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,417
And it looks so pretty.

419
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,667
The fact that like, this is
just a moment of freedom.

420
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,875
It's a choice.

421
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,667
Like getting a
tattoo is a choice

422
00:17:45,667 --> 00:17:49,958
and I finally get to have
the choice to do one.

423
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,417
- That's cool.
- [Gypsy] That is cool.

424
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,583
[gentle music]

425
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,333
- Well, Ryan was
supposed to help me cook.

426
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:17,458
- I didn't plan on
getting a tattoo,

427
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,333
but I'm getting one
just hanging out

428
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,708
and he's like, what you want?

429
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,500
Next thing you know,
I just started talking

430
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,000
and he is like, "Oh, I'll draw
you up something real quick."

431
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,292
And I was like, "Let's do it."

432
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:27,417
I was like, why not?

433
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:30,208
I'm here, let's make it happen.

434
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,708
He's gonna do like a rose

435
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,167
and then the leaves are
gonna be like a fleur-de-lis.

436
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:35,083
- [Gypsy] Ooh.

437
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,125
- You know, I wanted a rose.

438
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:37,167
- I know.
[lips smack]

439
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,458
- Gypsy Rose.

440
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,250
- I love that she gets
to try some of this food.

441
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,542
Maybe she'll want the recipe.

442
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,333
It's been passed down
from Kristy's mama to me.

443
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,625
So I'm just happy that
her and Mia are both here

444
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,625
at the same time.

445
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,583
You know.

446
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:59,917
Coming here to my house,
I mean, I'd like for her

447
00:18:59,917 --> 00:19:01,792
to just feel at home.

448
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:05,042
Waited for her to come back
here a long time, you know?

449
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,542
And I'd like for her to see

450
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,292
where she could have
lived, you know?

451
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:12,625
And I wish she could
stay, you know.

452
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,625
- Told y'all it's
a mess in here

453
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,667
'cause I'm looking, I'm going
through so much pictures

454
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,250
to put in albums.

455
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,875
I think I have, when she
first started dating Ryan.

456
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:39,958
He sent me a lot of pictures.

457
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,250
He mailed them to me.

458
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:47,083
Gypsy's first true
relationship was Ken,

459
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,333
where she experienced struggles

460
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:52,042
and experienced laughter

461
00:19:52,042 --> 00:19:55,667
and experienced heartache.

462
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,667
[paper ripping]

463
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:06,583
This is stuff that she had
when they were still together.

464
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,375
They lasted for about like
two years, I wanna say.

465
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,083
And what I thought at the time

466
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:16,875
is that he couldn't
take the heat.

467
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:19,042
People are trying to
find the information,

468
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:22,875
calling his family and you
know, calling him at work.

469
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,375
And next thing you know,

470
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:28,333
she called me
hysterically crying

471
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,458
that he broke up with her.

472
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,958
When they did
split I was pissed.

473
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:37,167
You know, you promised you
would be there for her.

474
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:41,208
And when the [bleep]
got real, you left.

475
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,667
I loved Ken.

476
00:20:43,667 --> 00:20:46,542
Me and Ken still
have a friendship.

477
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:49,625
And I don't care
who likes it or not.

478
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,958
When my kids break
up with somebody,

479
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:53,458
I don't break up with them.

480
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:59,125
- I mean, having Ryan,
the kind of guy he is,

481
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:01,875
he's really easy to
like, I don't know.

482
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,417
He's not shy, you
know, he is outgoing.

483
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:09,042
So, I mean, Ryan got her
through those last couple years.

484
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:10,333
And you know, and
I told him, I said,

485
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:11,708
"You're gonna have
your hands full, Ryan."

486
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:15,625
You know it's gonna
be a job for you

487
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,792
to like keep her in
check a little bit.

488
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:24,708
She's spontaneous and she can
make some quick decisions.

489
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:27,750
And that's why I say he is
gonna have his hands full.

490
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:32,208
- Ryan is a great guy, you know,

491
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,875
but if her and Ken would
still have been together

492
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,792
and she got outta prison,

493
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:44,458
I knew in my heart
she was gonna be safe.

494
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:45,792
I wouldn't have worried.

495
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:50,708
And I didn't know there
was more to the story

496
00:21:50,708 --> 00:21:53,958
of why he ended
it until recently.

497
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,542
He reached out and he said,

498
00:21:58,542 --> 00:21:59,792
"I need to talk to you."

499
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:04,208
He called me and
he explained to me

500
00:22:04,208 --> 00:22:06,375
that people were telling him,

501
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:09,917
"If you love her
enough, let her go.

502
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,083
Let her find
herself on her own."

503
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,333
And he said, look, you
know, if he would've known,

504
00:22:17,333 --> 00:22:18,625
And he said, look, you
know, if he would've known,

505
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,833
she would've dated some,
like, found somebody else

506
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,208
and got engaged, he
wouldn't have let her go.

507
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:26,292
[tense dramatic music]

508
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:36,958
[gentle music]

509
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,708
- No. Mine don't hurt at all.

510
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:50,708
- Not yet.
- [Ryan] Not yet.

511
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:01,042
[car door slams]

512
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:02,042
- [Rod] What up?

513
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:03,042
- Look at it!

514
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:04,125
- It looks good.

515
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,042
- I know it looks good.

516
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,333
I want you to see Ryan's.

517
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,208
- I can't even tell
it's covered like.

518
00:23:07,208 --> 00:23:08,917
- I know. I know,

519
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:10,208

00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:47,208
So in case Ken would text,

695
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:50,083
but then I'm like, that
would be still harboring

696
00:32:50,083 --> 00:32:52,375
an omission.

697
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:54,750
I'm gonna tell Ryan
about it later.

698
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,958
But knowing what
you just told me,

699
00:32:57,958 --> 00:33:00,708
in a different world,

700
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:03,125
if I wasn't married to Ryan,

701
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:07,083
knowing all of this.
[snaps fingers]

702
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,250
- [Kristy] I know.

703
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,125
You don't even need
to say it, girl.

704
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:12,708
- Okay. I'm gonna
hop off of here.

705
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:13,917
I love you.

706
00:33:13,917 --> 00:33:16,000
- All right. I love you, too.
- Okay. Bye.

707
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
- [Kristy] Bye.

708
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,375
[contemplative music]

709
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,292
- God, for years,

710
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:30,708
he never gave me like
an answer of like,

711
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:32,667
what was the final straw.

712
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:37,750
And for years I went
through like a huge,

713
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:41,083
like self-doubt tunnel.

714
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,917
Like I know that he is
interested in blondes.

715
00:33:43,917 --> 00:33:46,250
I'm not blonde, I'm a brunette.

716
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,542
So I'd go in the shower,
take fingernail clippers

717
00:33:48,542 --> 00:33:53,042
and just cut my hair off
trying to do everything I can

718
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:55,250
to get his attention again.

719
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,417
I would've given
anything to that man.

720
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,833
I would've bought the sun,
the moon and the stars

721
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:02,417
and gave it to him on a platter.

722
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,125
And that hurts me that
I loved him that much.

723
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:16,083
- Because I feel like no
one is ever gonna love him

724
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:18,167
as much as I loved
him at that time.

725
00:34:23,292 --> 00:34:26,667
And it makes me
feel better knowing

726
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:30,208
that he's truly
sorry for hurting me.

727
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,167
But it doesn't change anything.

728
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:37,542
Like I married Ryan,
I have a marriage now.

729
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:40,542
I'm wearing this wedding ring
that belonged to Ryan's mom.

730
00:34:40,542 --> 00:34:43,458
Like I have a commitment
to my husband.

731
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,208
And I wanna keep that.

732
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,250
But what's gonna
happen when Ryan

733
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:57,333
and I have an argument?
Is that little thought

734
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:02,208
in the back of my head
gonna say, "Ken is single.

735
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:07,250
And he's always understood me."

736
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,000
Like he was my
best friend first.

737
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,750
So I can't take it.

738
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:19,542
I have to stay loyal
to my marriage.

739
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:21,792
I can't entertain the
thought of anything else.

740
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:33,375
[soft music]

741
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,333
[door clicks open]

742
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,625
- Baby!
- [Gypsy] Hey!

743
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:40,917
- [Ryan] Hey sweetie.

744
00:35:40,917 --> 00:35:42,292
- How was your day?

745
00:35:42,292 --> 00:35:44,167
Did all the students
talk your ear off?

746
00:35:44,167 --> 00:35:45,375
- I had some.

747
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:47,208
- Lemme show you what I did.

748
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:50,125
- You know, I had a full
eight hours at work, right?

749
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:54,000
- Now it's gonna be a
little bit of a shock.

750
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,500
- Okay?
- Okay.

751
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,833
- I see you threw
out our spaghetti

752
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:59,500
that was good that I
ate for lunch. Okay.

753
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,292
- All right. Ready? Ready.

754
00:36:03,458 --> 00:36:05,917
- Good God.
[Gypsy chuckles]

755
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:07,208
Where's our food, baby?

756
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,708
- I knew you were
gonna say that.

757
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,917
- [Ryan] We had food.

758
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,792
- Yeah, but it
was all old stuff.

759
00:36:11,792 --> 00:36:14,250
Okay, so you've got onions.

760
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,333
- Baby, what happened
to that chicken

761
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,583
that I just cooked?

762
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,042
- The chicken is right
here. I saved it.

763
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:20,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

764
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,167
- And the rice was
good too, right?

765
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:23,458
- Didn't know that.

766
00:36:27,208 --> 00:36:29,167
I kept the bacon.
- Okay.

767
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,917
- Yeah, I kept the bacon.

768
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:37,375
So yeah, you had a
whole lot of condiments

769
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:39,250
- And you throw those away?

770
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,708
- Just the empty ones.

771
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:41,625
- What empty ones?

772
00:36:41,625 --> 00:36:43,333
- They had a lot
of empty [bleep].

773
00:36:45,375 --> 00:36:47,375
- It is like we had food.

774
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,542
- Yeah, but honey, that was old.

775
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:51,417
- Gypsy...

776
00:36:53,542 --> 00:36:56,875
I said make it your
home and you have.

777
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:59,417
Damn, you just hit me with
a lot in like five seconds.

778
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,417
- I know. I cleaned
out the fridge,

779
00:37:01,417 --> 00:37:04,417
I cleaned out all [bleep]
that was in my closet.

780
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:07,167
- Well I didn't know you were
cleaning out our whole life.

781
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:09,750
- It didn't take me
very long either.

782
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,125
- Well no, it doesn't
take people long

783
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,292
to throw [bleep] away.

784
00:37:12,292 --> 00:37:13,583
[Gypsy chuckles]

785
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:15,875
All right. Anything else
I need to be aware of?

786
00:37:20,958 --> 00:37:23,167
- Uh uh.
- [Ryan] What are these?

787
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:25,042
- [Gypsy] That's
them yucky pillows

788
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:27,042
I don't know why were keeping.

789
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:28,542
- [Ryan] What? That were where?

790
00:37:28,542 --> 00:37:30,208
- That was in your closet.

791
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:31,792
- Baby, 'cause you don't
throw pillows away.

792
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:33,708
- You absolutely do.

793
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:36,750
You absolutely should
change your pillows,

794
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,208
especially when
they look like this.

795
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,792
This is gross.

796
00:37:43,208 --> 00:37:44,333
Ugh!

797
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,250
- Don't throw these away.

798
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,417
Look, throw the food out,

799
00:37:47,417 --> 00:37:49,167
but not that big Tupperware,

800
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:50,458
you don't throw that
big Tupperware away.

801
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:52,917
- You don't even
drink that stuff.

802
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:54,375
Where did these come from?

803
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,083
- In case somebody ever
came over and did it?

804
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,792
Maybe my ex-girlfriend
came over.

805
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:03,208
- Okay.

806
00:38:03,208 --> 00:38:05,167
I got something to
tell you tonight.

807
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:06,458
- [Ryan] What's that?

808
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,917
- I'll get you back for that.

809
00:38:08,917 --> 00:38:10,417
- [Ryan] Oh really? No.

810
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,917
Get away from me.

811
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:12,833
No.
- Come here.

812
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:13,750
- No.

813
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:14,833
- Come here.

814
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:15,667
- No.

815
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:18,542
I don't like that.

816
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,375
No.

817
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,792
Get away from me. No.

818
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:29,958
[soft music]
[birds chirp]

819
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:40,667
- Yes. Kristy has continued
conversation with Ken.

820
00:38:41,917 --> 00:38:44,958
He's been reaching out to
her just to ask questions

821
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:46,542
and things like that

822
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:50,542
because Gypsy has blocked his
number, has refused contact,

823
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:52,542
has chose to move
on with her life.

824
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:53,917
And now that she's outta prison,

825
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:56,375
he's like trying to
weasel his way back in.

826
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,875
And Kristy has continued
to allow that door,

827
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:02,208
like she keeps cracking
that door open.

828
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,958
I'm mad at Kristy over this

829
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,208
because it's like,
what are you doing?

830
00:39:06,208 --> 00:39:07,417
What is the point?

831
00:39:07,417 --> 00:39:08,625
- So I knew that he
would get a little

832
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:10,333
ticked off at Kristy.

833
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,958
He got a little
ticked off at me, too

834
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:15,625
when I told him that I
started to get all emotional

835
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,417
and I'm like, what
do you expect?

836
00:39:18,417 --> 00:39:21,917
Like, does it break
my heart a little bit

837
00:39:21,917 --> 00:39:24,583
to learn that Ken left me

838
00:39:24,583 --> 00:39:26,875
because he thought he
was doing the right thing

839
00:39:26,875 --> 00:39:28,708
for me at the time?

840
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,917
Yeah, of course
it broke my heart.

841
00:39:30,917 --> 00:39:32,417
And of course his
reaction was like,

842
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,625
"Well if you wanna
go be with him,

843
00:39:33,625 --> 00:39:34,917
then go be with him."

844
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,458
And I am like, "We are married."

845
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:41,375
I am like, "I love you.

846
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:43,917
I am invested in our
life together here."

847
00:39:45,542 --> 00:39:47,125
- I mean, I'm sure
he regrets it.

848
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,125
I mean, why wouldn't he?

849
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:49,750
She's out. She's beautiful.

850
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,250
And I'm sure everybody
in his circle's

851
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,708
telling him he's a
dumb mother [bleep]

852
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:55,667
'cause he is a
dumb mother [bleep].

853
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,000
Pardon my language, I'm sorry.

854
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,708
I'm just pissed off.

855
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:01,167
He left a wonderful woman,

856
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:03,458
a beautiful, wonderful woman.

857
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:07,125
And he left her and I came
along and swooped her up.

858
00:40:07,125 --> 00:40:10,250
You know, that's what happens
when you leave a good woman.

859
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,708
There are options.

860
00:40:11,708 --> 00:40:15,375
You know, like, and
Gypsy's happy with me.

861
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,417
So it's like, dude, go on.

862
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Apparently the D is
fire or something.

863
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:23,833
Like, sorry dude, you
had your shot move on.

864
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,667
[tense music]

865
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:30,083
I'm tired of talking about him.

866
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:34,125
I wish he would just go
away like he needs to.

867
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,500
Like, pretty soon I'm
gonna get involved

868
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,333
and you do not want that, Ken.

869
00:40:38,333 --> 00:40:39,958
Believe me, you
do not want that.

870
00:40:42,292 --> 00:40:43,333
- [bleep]

871
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:45,042
- Dang. I love my wife.

872
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:46,708
- [Gypsy] I want to
work on our marriage.

873
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:49,042
Even if it means that
we have some things

874
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,208
that we need to work
through with trust.

875
00:40:51,208 --> 00:40:52,542
- Just do like I asked you

876
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:55,208
and don't ever reach
out to Ken ever.

877
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,667
She's 30 years old.

878
00:40:56,667 --> 00:41:00,125
She's making 17, 18-year-old
person type decisions.

879
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,125
- I don't know.

880
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,958
- So something happened though.

881
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:04,458
- Are you pregnant?

882
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:05,458
Oh my God.

883
00:41:06,917 --> 00:41:08,708
- [Producer] Why do
you want to talk now?

884
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,208
