1
00:00:02,042 --> 00:00:03,250
- Birth control. Did
you figure that out?

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,708
Do you want kids right away?

3
00:00:04,708 --> 00:00:06,208
- I mean, I want kids.

4
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:08,958
I just, I don't think that
right away would be smart.

5
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:10,042
- Agreed.

6
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:11,542
- Ken texted my stepmom.

7
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:15,208
- Why do you think he decided
it's time to pop back up?

8
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:18,000
- I don't think that he has
respect for my marriage.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,083
- He doesn't like me.

10
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,375
- Is this the life

11
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:22,917
that we really wanna
lead for ourselves?

12
00:00:22,917 --> 00:00:24,875
- But I still would
like you to remarry me.

13
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:27,000
- The timing needs to
be at a little bit

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,667
of a more convenient time.

15
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:32,583
- What?

16
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:36,917
- [Kristy] Gypsy's first
true relationship was Ken.

17
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:38,500
- I loved him so much.

18
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:42,833
I have to stay loyal
to my marriage.

19
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,625
I've never orgasmed
with a partner.

20
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,500
I have that past history
with being molested too.

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,792
Getting past the
mental blocks is hard.

22
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:52,458
- [Ryan] Who are you texting?

23
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,375
- I'm just texting
my sister, honey.

24
00:00:55,375 --> 00:00:58,500
- He thinks Kristy's trying
to sabotage our marriage.

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,250
- If something happens
with Gypsy and Ken,

26
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,250
it's gonna be your fault.

27
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,042
- [Ken] I just feel like
it's important for me

28
00:01:05,042 --> 00:01:07,208
to share my thoughts
and opinions on her

29
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,458
and the time that
we spent together.

30
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:11,542
[pensive music]

31
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:26,792
- It is hard to
hear about an ex.

32
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:29,708
It absolutely is hard for Ryan.

33
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,125
I mean, he's my husband.

34
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:35,500
And Ryan feels like Ken

35
00:01:36,583 --> 00:01:39,125
is possibly a threat.

36
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:42,542
But I love Ryan,

37
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:44,667
and I want to work
on our marriage,

38
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,333
even if it means that
we have some things

39
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,542
that we need to work
through with trust.

40
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,583
I understand that.

41
00:01:52,542 --> 00:01:54,417
- You know, now that
she's happily married,

42
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:57,375
now he's trying to come back
and try to weasel his way in?

43
00:01:57,375 --> 00:01:59,625
It's like my guard's
up, you know?

44
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:03,500
But, at the same time, it's
like she's never gonna want it.

45
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,208
I feel like it, I don't think
she's gonna do that to me.

46
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,542
[pensive music]

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,500
- This is for
training, so, like,

48
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,042
whenever you wanna start
training for tricks,

49
00:02:16,042 --> 00:02:18,083
like, you say a
command, like sit.

50
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,458
- Mm-hmm.
[clicker clicks]

51
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,208
- And then, you give a
little treat when they do it.

52
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,917
- I've never trained
a dog before.

53
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:25,542
- I haven't either.

54
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:28,875
- Like, I've trained it to like,

55
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:30,875
I know, like, rub
its nose in pee

56
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,375
when it pees in the house.

57
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:35,750
- Oh, that's not nice.
- I know, but it works.

58
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,375
I can't believe we're
actually getting a dog.

59
00:02:37,375 --> 00:02:39,375
Like, we talked about it,

60
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,792
and then next thing you
know, it's like, here it is.

61
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:45,875
Did I expect to
have a puppy today?

62
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,417
Absolutely not.

63
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,417
I just wanted all my ducks
in a row before we got it.

64
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:52,375
You know, we made one phone
call and the lady was like,

65
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:53,708
"Yeah, meet me
here, here, here,"

66
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,708
and I was just like,
"Whoa, what just happened?"

67
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,667
You know, but this is a
milestone for me and Gypsy.

68
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:00,958
- Let me grab my purse.

69
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:04,708
- I have always wanted my
own family to call my own.

70
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,917
You know, when I was growing
up, I didn't have a dad,

71
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:09,917
so it was one of those, it
was me, my mom, my brother.

72
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:11,750
And then, my stepdad came in

73
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,792
and, you know, then it
became him and my mom.

74
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,500
And, you know, it
was just one of those

75
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,542
where I never had a
family where I felt like

76
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:20,292
this is my family, you know?

77
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:22,375
And it's cool now,
'cause I'm setting it up

78
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,958
the way I wanna set it up.

79
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:27,667
So it's my family
and I like that.

80
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,375
You want me to warm up
that burger real quick?

81
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,417
- No, let's just go.
- You sure?

82
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,417
- Yeah.

83
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:37,083
Well, I think now that we are,
like, bringing a new addition

84
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,458
and a fur baby into our life

85
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:41,333
that it will make
this a little closer.

86
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:45,875
All right, think
we can roll out.

87
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,583
- [Ryan] Baby, where was
that towel? Did you see--

88
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,292
- I got it!
- Oh, my baby's on point.

89
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:51,833
- When I tell you
I got everything,

90
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,250
I got everything.
- My baby's on point!

91
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,333
I love my wife. [kisses]

92
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,583
[gentle music]

93
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,500
- [Rod] Yeah, well, I was
on the boat when Ryan-

94
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,417
- Ryan called you?
- Texted me.

95
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:13,000
He texted me telling me
some stuff about Ken,

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,375
and you were involved,

97
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:18,292
and he felt like you were
stepping inside the circle

98
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,875
or whatever.
- Right, yeah.

99
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:22,167
- That's when I called
him and talked to him,

100
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,250
and I agreed with him.

101
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,083
- Yeah, I mean, think about it.

102
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:27,875
Ken was a big part of her life,

103
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:31,542
and he has the right
to speak his opinion

104
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:35,250
and set the facts straight.

105
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,875
- You know, he chose not
to be with her anymore,

106
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,750
to give her that freedom.

107
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
But then he's gonna
come back around,

108
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,417
I don't know, I feel
like he's maybe trying

109
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,625
to worm his way
back in, you know?

110
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,750
- No, I think when Gypsy
and Ryan did a podcast,

111
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,333
and you haven't
heard it, I heard it,

112
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,542
they dogged him out.

113
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,833
He had told me, he says, "My
story needs to be heard."

114
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:05,000
- Gypsy and Ryan's
relationship is fresh, fragile,

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,875
and she needs to be happy.

116
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:07,958
That's all I want.

117
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:13,167
- I mean, I hope and
wish that they last.

118
00:05:13,167 --> 00:05:16,000
If it doesn't, then we'll be
there to pick up the pieces.

119
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:25,542
- I would hope Ken
sincerely feels

120
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:28,083
that he wants Gypsy to be happy.

121
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:32,417
And in order for her to be
happy, and move on from it,

122
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:36,917
and have that closure,
just stay quiet, stay away,

123
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:41,000
and give her and
Ryan the best chance.

124
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:46,042
I do, honestly, gut-check
feeling is that he's gonna try

125
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:49,042
to somehow worm his way
back into the situation.

126
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:51,292
[tense music]

127
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:58,167
- Getting nervous.
- Why are you so nervous?

128
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,708
- I'm just nervous,
babe, it's a pup.

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,333
Who you texting?

130
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:11,375
- I'm texting Mia.
- I saw that address.

131
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,667
What does she want?

132
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:14,375
- [Gypsy] For what?
There's no address.

133
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,458
- Scroll back down, that's.

134
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,208
- Oh, that's ours, that's
for the free stuff.

135
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,667
- Oh, okay.

136
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:23,250
Well, I saw that, and was
like, "What the hell?"

137
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,708
- Yeah, that's for
the free stuff.

138
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,125
- That's why I was like,
"Who are you texting?"

139
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:30,333
[tense music]

140
00:06:37,792 --> 00:06:41,417
Has there been any
thoughts to reach out?

141
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:44,083
- For what?
- To, you know,

142
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:49,250
has there been any desire
from you to reach out

143
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,875
to what's his face?

144
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,333
- You can say what's
his face's name?

145
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,167
- To Ken?
- No.

146
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:57,083
- No desire whatsoever?

147
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,583
- No, we're good.
- Okay.

148
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,625
That's what I just
wanted to know.

149
00:07:01,625 --> 00:07:03,000
Like, I believe it.

150
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,333
The situation's done, right?
- Situation's done.

151
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,667
- That's one reason I love you.

152
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:22,583
What kind of stuff you
trying to get there?

153
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,875
- I'm just texting
my sister, honey.

154
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:27,000
[tense music]

155
00:07:28,542 --> 00:07:31,792
- Okay.
- So, relax.

156
00:07:34,292 --> 00:07:35,792
- I'm very relaxed.

157
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,125
I'm just asking,
what's going on?

158
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,167
- I know.

159
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,417
[gentle music]

160
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,000
- [Ryan] Hey, how
you doing? I'm Ryan.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,958
- [Gypsy] Hi!
- [Ryan] This is my wife.

162
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:59,875
- [Gypsy] Aw, hello, baby.
- Yes, yes.

163
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,792
- Thank you for doing this.
- Please text me, call me

164
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,458
if y'all have any
problems or any concerns

165
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,375
with her at all.
- [Gypsy] Okay, okay.

166
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,875
- Thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

167
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,667
- [Ryan] You just made
our family complete.

168
00:08:09,667 --> 00:08:10,917
- See you, girl.
- Thank you.

169
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,083
- Bye.
- Bye.

170
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,958
- Hi, baby.

171
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:16,000
Aw, she's so little.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,042
[Gypsy giggling]

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,458
- She loves licking on you.
- She's a good girl.

174
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,833
You like the name Pixie?

175
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:28,583
- I like the name Pixie.
- Okay, Pixie it is.

176
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,333
- [Gypsy] Hey, baby.

177
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,875
It's cold.
- It is cold, Pixie.

178
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:35,875
- Aww.

179
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,125
She's a little cold right now.

180
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,167
Hey, baby.

181
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:44,750
This is where we live.

182
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:48,000
Come here, baby.

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,625
I love her already.

184
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,375
She's only been home
for like an hour

185
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,667
and I absolutely love her.

186
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:53,917
She's so sweet.

187
00:08:53,917 --> 00:08:55,958
You know, I think
that this breed

188
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:58,792
kind of fits our situation,
our living situation,

189
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,125
and us in our home right now,

190
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,875
so I think she's
perfect for our family.

[gentle music]

192
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,458
It feels like this is a good
decision for me and Ryan,

193
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:14,875
and I think it'll
give us something

194
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:18,167
to kind of bring us
closer together.

you know, we don't
live in the past,

201
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,125
and that's one thing I
love about me and Gypsy.

don't like Ryan, 'cause I do.

206
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,292
I mean, when I
see them together,

207
00:09:51,292 --> 00:09:55,042
you know, you could see that,
you know, they have that love.

208
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:59,667
Ken was her first
real relationship.

209
00:09:59,667 --> 00:10:01,208
Lord, I'm friends
with all my exes.

210
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,083
- Since Ryan got in the picture
and they decided to get married,

211
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,000
I thought Ken would've
never been mentioned again.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,417
But, apparently, it's not
gonna go away like it should.

213
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:14,417
- Now that she got closure

214
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:17,875
of really why things ended,

215
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:21,292
I don't think we'll
hear too much of Ken.

216
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,542
- Well, I just hope from here,

217
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:25,333
you know, if they
got their closure,

218
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,250
let's close the book on
Ken and don't talk to him.

219
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,917
- I'm not getting involved in...

220
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:33,333
- Just do like I asked
you and don't ever...

221
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,333
You allowed a door to open up.

222
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:40,708
If Ken wants to
reach out to Gypsy

223
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,083
and they wanna communicate,

224
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,917
you should have told Ken,

225
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,667
"I can't help you."

226
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,500
If something happens
with Gypsy and Ken,

227
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,292
it's gonna be your fault.

228
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:01,000
- I'm not gonna lie to
Gypsy, that's the thing.

229
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,958
I promised her that I would
never keep anything from her,

230
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:07,000
because that's what Dee Dee did,

231
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,667
and I'm not like that.

232
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:14,167
If she needs to hear
whatever he has to say

233
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,708
for her to heal,

234
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,833
let her freaking heal.

235
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:25,625
My gut, I think that
it's not fully closed.

236
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,250
- I'm not even gonna
call it a saga,

237
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,792
but it's a seed I
feel like that can,

238
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:34,458
you know, grow some bad grass.

239
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:34,708
you know, grow some bad grass.

240
00:11:35,542 --> 00:11:36,500
There's not a lot I
can do to stop it.

241
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,917
If it's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen.

242
00:11:37,917 --> 00:11:39,875
But I don't want Kristy
to be to blame for it,

243
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,542
or me to be to blame for it.

[gentle music]

00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:58,500
- I'm excited to, you know,
hang out with my sister.

247
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,208
- [Ryan] Yeah, I wish I was
going to hang out with you.

248
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,375
- [Gypsy] Well, we're just
gonna be doing some girl stuff,

249
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,875
so you probably wouldn't
be that interested.

250
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,458
- [Ryan] No, I wouldn't.

251
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,875
- I wore these
pants 'cause I knew

252
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,417
that she would probably
be wearing leggings,

253
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,917
and if she's gonna show
her body I wanted to too.

254
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:17,833
- That's nice.
[Gypsy laughing]

255
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,583
- Sorry, I think them
things on your chest

256
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,792
are bigger too now, I think.

257
00:12:21,792 --> 00:12:23,250
- Well, she's got
the flat stomach.

258
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,125
She's got the flat stomach,
she has smaller boobs.

259
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:29,000
But she's got like
that athletic build,

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,917
and I've got that, like..

261
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,250
- Got that kaboom!

262
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:36,583
- I got that stripper
body. [laughing]

263
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,958
- Okay, now we're
turning around.

264
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,042
[Gypsy laughing]
Trip's canceled.

265
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:41,583
- [Gypsy] If I had
to rate myself,

266
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:44,042
I'd rate myself a solid six.

267
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:47,167
I look in the mirror
and sometimes I'm like,

268
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,917
"Yeah, my mom was right,
I'm not desirable."

269
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:53,000
And I look at, you know,
my sister and I'm like,

270
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,750
"You are so pretty."

271
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,042
Like, I wish I was born pretty.

272
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,708
- Yeah, y'all never had,
like, one-on-one girl time.

273
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,667
- Right.
- Oop, let me get over.

274
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:08,458
- Yeah, I mean, I just, like,

275
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:11,375
I don't know what kind of stuff
she's like into and stuff,

276
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:16,375
so, I mean, it'd be a good time
to get to know her that way.

277
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,208
- Yeah.

278
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,042
- Even though we're
10 years apart,

279
00:13:19,042 --> 00:13:21,667
Mia just wants to be someone
that I can lean on and talk to.

280
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,042
I know that I'm
the older sister,

281
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:28,375
but, in many ways, she is the
one with the most experience,

282
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,250
and I go to her for advice.

283
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,458
- Just don't let her
talk (bleep) about me.

284
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,375
I know she's going to.

285
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,875
- She's not gonna talk
(bleep) about you.

286
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,500
- Yeah.
- She's not!

287
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,250
- Okay.
- Like, I mean,

288
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,375
she hasn't talked
(bleep) about you.

289
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,708
All she said was that
sometimes she likes you,

290
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,458
sometimes she's iffy about you.

291
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,458
- She has no reason
to be iffy about me,

292
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,083
that's the thing it's like...

293
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,458
I get it though, she's
being a protective sister.

294
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:03,833
- Yeah.
- I get it.

295
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:05,208
Mia feels how she feels.

296
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:08,333
Like, I can't change
that just over time.

297
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:11,417
Like, all I can do is be
me and be there for Gypsy,

298
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,667
and that's all I plan to do.

299
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,542
- Hello!
- Hey!

300
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,333
I brought your stuff.
- Perfect.

301
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,292
- Hey, girl.
- You look cute!

302
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:21,333
- Thank you!

303
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,042
- This wind ain't nothing nice.

304
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,625
- Sorry, it's not
better weather.

305
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,500
- All right.
- Y'all ladies have fun.

306
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,708
Y'all have a good day.

307
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,083
Be careful, you got
precious cargo now.

308
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:32,625
- [Mia] I know, all
right, be careful.

309
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,833
- [Ryan] Okay, y'all have fun.

310
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:34,917
- Love you!
- Love you, baby.

311
00:14:34,917 --> 00:14:36,500
Mwah!
- Mwah.

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,250
[bright music]

313
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,500
So how have you been?
- Good.

314
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,833
- [Gypsy] How's school going?

315
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:46,958
- It's all right.

316
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,208
I have my first exam on Monday.

317
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:53,083
- You know, nursing is
definitely something

318
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:56,458
that I think that you
have the heart for.

319
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,875
I know my experiences
with doctors and nurses

320
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,875
hasn't been all that great,

321
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:02,292
and I have a complicated
history with it.

322
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:05,625
But, you know, I think that
it's a good profession.

323
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,708
I scheduled my appointment,

324
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,792
it's for the 27th.

325
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:14,542
- For your nose?
- For my nose.

326
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:17,375
I'm so tired of how
the profile side looks.

327
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,667
- I hate my profile.
- Because it's like,

328
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,167
it dips down and
then it dips back.

329
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,542
Like, it goes back up.

330
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:25,833
And if they can just shave
the bump down a little bit

331
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:29,125
to where I have a
more feminine slope,

332
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,875
I would be happy with that.

333
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,083
- Dad screwed us.
[Gypsy laughs]

334
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,208
People are so mean about it too.

335
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:39,708
- They are, I watched one video,

336
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,875
there's this dude that said,

337
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:46,458
"Big nose, beady-eyed,
Ninja Turtle looking B."

338
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,333
They wanna hate on anything.
- Yeah.

339
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,042
- And they're gonna try and find

340
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:55,542
what they can to hate on.

341
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,917
[gentle music]

342
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,583
- Well, hello, ladies.
- Hi.

343
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,375
- How are y'all?
- Good.

344
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,875
- Good, so--
- This is my first time.

345
00:16:11,875 --> 00:16:13,292
I've never had one.
- Oh, is it really?

346
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,042
- So I have no idea
what to expect.

347
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,917
- I am honored to
be the first one,

348
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,208
'cause I will set
the bar very high

349
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:20,333
for the next one that comes.

350
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:23,083
- Yeah, so I'm like, I really
don't know what to expect,

351
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,208
or what to do, or anything.

352
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,208
My short, little legs. [giggles]

353
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:34,875
Mm, it's massaging me.

354
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,583
- This is you first
time in a massage chair?

355
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,208
- Uh-huh.
- That's crazy.

356
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,708
- I'm like, ooh, this
feels nice. [giggles]

357
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,583
Ahh. [laughs]

358
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:49,875
So things have been
a little bit weird.

359
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:52,208
- Why?
- You remember how everybody

360
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:55,208
was like, "Yeah, you
don't know someone

361
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,125
until you live with them"?
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:16:57,125 --> 00:17:00,042
- I'm learning that.
- Mm.

363
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:02,542
- I mean, it doesn't
change my love for him,

364
00:17:02,542 --> 00:17:07,042
but I didn't know that he
snores like a grizzly bear.

365
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,458
I sleep with earplugs.

366
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:13,042
But I'm like, I didn't know
that before I married you.

367
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,042
- What about laundry,
and dishes, and all?

368
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:17,583
- Okay, he's good at
keeping up the dishes.

369
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,292
I do the laundry.

370
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:22,125
He is, I'm not gonna
say he's a hoarder,

371
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,250
but there's a lot of clutter.

372
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,458
I hate clutter, my
mom was a hoarder.

373
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,792
- That's what I was thinking.

374
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,208
- It's a problem for me.

375
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,375
Like, it is like an OCD
thing, I don't like clutter.

376
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:38,542
The closet, there was
clothes everywhere.

377
00:17:38,542 --> 00:17:40,875
I took out everything,

378
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,750
and then piece by
piece, "You want this?

379
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,458
If not, it's going to Goodwill."

380
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:50,917
Made two Goodwill bags,
yet there's still so much.

381
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,833
So it's just differences
in personality,

382
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,750
and sometimes it
gets overwhelming.

383
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,208
And I have to tell him like,

384
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,917
"I need to go and sit
outside for a second.

385
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:02,292
Have a moment away from you.

386
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:03,708
I'll come back, I love you.

387
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,292
I might text you, but right
now I need this me time."

388
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,292
You know?
- Yeah.

389
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,833
- Things have been
a little bit weird

390
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,333
between Ryan and Kristy lately.

391
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,542
- Why? Because of Ken?

392
00:18:20,542 --> 00:18:22,750
- Yes, so--

393
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,542
- I knew that was gonna happen,
I don't know why she did that.

394
00:18:25,542 --> 00:18:28,708
- I mean, it was just
one of those things

395
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:33,000
that we were talking and
it led into it so easily,

396
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,792
and it was kind of
like out of left field,

397
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:37,750
"Yeah, I talked to Ken the
other day for like two hours."

398
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,333
She's like, "Yeah, he told
me, like, the real reason,

399
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:43,500
like, why he broke up with you."

400
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,708
And, of course, that was,
like, a huge thing for me,

401
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,583
because, like, I never
got closure with that.

402
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,375
She's like, "The
reason why he left you

403
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:54,042
is because he felt like

404
00:18:54,042 --> 00:18:56,458
he was doing the
right thing by you."

405
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,375
So she's like, "He made
the ultimate sacrifice,

406
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,417
by, like, he loved you so
much that he let you go."

407
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:05,125
And then, that got me crying.

408
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,375
I'm like, "I loved him so much."

409
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:12,375
Okay, so stirred up
a bunch of feelings.

410
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,375
Okay?

411
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,292
I had to tell Ryan about it,

412
00:19:16,292 --> 00:19:19,417
because I'm like, I don't
keep stuff from Ryan.

413
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:24,000
So I was like,
"Kristy talked to Ken,

414
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,750
and not only does he
regret leaving me,

415
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,042
but he also is single too."

416
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:33,250
[tense music]

417
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:40,542
Oh, his reaction was
something to the fact of,

418
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:44,625
he thinks Kristy's trying
to sabotage our marriage.

419
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:48,000
It's a slap in his face,
and duh, duh, duh, duh,

420
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,833
and so he texted Dad.

421
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:55,750
- I wear my heart on a
sleeve, I'm very sensitive.

422
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,708
And with Kristy, I
know she accepts me,

423
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,375
but it's one of those like,
quit bringing old stuff up.

424
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,167
You know, especially with
that situation with Ken,

425
00:20:04,167 --> 00:20:05,917
I was kinda like,
"What is your purpose?"

426
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:07,500
So I called Rod and was like,

427
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
"Hey, Dad, here's the situation.

428
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,792
I feel like Kristy is not
respecting my marriage."

429
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:16,208
And he was like, "Man, I'll
hit you back, just hang tight."

430
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:17,667
And then, Rod called
me and he's like,

431
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:21,000
"I told Kristy if she ever
brought him up again,

432
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,542
that she'd be in trouble.

433
00:20:22,542 --> 00:20:24,750
You know, like if Gypsy
wants to reach out,

434
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,375
you let Gypsy reach out."

435
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:28,250
Said, "You are not
gonna be the reason

436
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,250
that that door
stays open, Kristy."

437
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:31,750
And that's all I could ask for.

438
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,375
Kristy didn't want
us to get married.

439
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:35,250
Just accept the fact that Gypsy

440
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,417
made the right
choice with her life.

441
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:41,792
I wish they would stop
trying to protect her,

442
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:47,167
and trying to look for
reasons for her to leave me.

443
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:49,375
[tense music]

444
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,792
- Well, I don't understand
why he got Dad involved.

445
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:55,375
You're a grown man, why
you getting Dad involved?

446
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:56,792
He could go to Mom and say,

447
00:20:56,792 --> 00:20:59,292
"Look, I don't like that,
you know, you said this.

448
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,833
Can you please not talk to
her about this anymore?

449
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,375
It makes me uncomfortable,

450
00:21:03,375 --> 00:21:05,500
and I don't think she needs
to hear this kind of thing."

451
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,375
- I don't think, he's
not comfortable yet.

452
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:10,000
And he can't vent to
me, 'cause I'm like,

453
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,042
"Well, stop bashing Mom for
just giving me closure."

454
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,375
And I told him I cried too.

455
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,167
And he's like, "Well,
do you want him?

456
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,583
Go be with him.

457
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,958
If that's what you want,
now's the time to tell me."

458
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:27,708
- Did you think about it?
- I mean, no. [giggles]

459
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,250
- [Mia] That wasn't
very convincing at all.

460
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,375
- No, of course
not, no. [laughs]

461
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,417
No, I mean, I can't
focus on anything else,

462
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:43,208
but this marriage.
- You're right, you're right.

463
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:45,333
Everybody always wants
what they can't have.

464
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,458
- Mm-hmm.

465
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:47,167
Even though, as
much as I love Ryan

466
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:48,667
Even though, as
much as I love Ryan

467
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,208
and I love our life together,

468
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,250
a part of me wonders that,

469
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,667
like, me pushing a wedding

470
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:58,792
and getting married in prison,

471
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:03,833
did I change the
course of my fate?

472
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:09,667
[tense music]

473
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,042
- So, did you find
a gynecologist?

474
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,708
- I'm working on it.

475
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:19,875
I needed to set up a
primary care first.

476
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:24,083
So I have my first primary
care doctor on Tuesday.

477
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,375
- Okay.

478
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,208
- You know what the
really sucky part is?

479
00:22:27,208 --> 00:22:29,833
- What?
- I still haven't orgasmed.

480
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,292
I've never orgasmed
with a partner.

481
00:22:36,583 --> 00:22:38,417
- Can you orgasm by yourself?

482
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,000
- I don't even know that.

483
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,792
- Okay.

484
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:47,667
- Like, I have that past
history with being molested too.

485
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:53,083
So getting past the
mental blocks is hard,

486
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,792
'cause I'm like,
so self-conscious.

487
00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,542
- No, I get it, it's
just being a woman.

488
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,250
It's like, I don't
know any gynecologist--

489
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,125
- So something happened though.
- What?

490
00:23:04,125 --> 00:23:05,833
Did he (bleep) in you?

491
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,125
Are you pregnant?

492
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:11,333
[tense music]

493
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,667
- You know, I don't want
Kristy to be involved

494
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,333
in their stuff or myself.

495
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,208
You know, they gotta
hash out some things.

496
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
But, you know,
when she feels like

497
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,708
there's something she can't
communicate with Ryan,

498
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,250
that she can reach out,
and she's doing that.

499
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,958
And that's all we can hope for,

500
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:38,917
is we're there for her to help
her make the right choice,

501
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,250
what's right for
her in her heart.

502
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,167
You know, we want
her to be happy.

503
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:45,375
[tense music]

504
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:47,667
You know, she's 30 years old.

505
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:52,792
She's making 17, 18-year-old
person type decisions.

506
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,417
- No, I'm not pregnant!

507
00:23:59,417 --> 00:24:01,417
It only happened two nights ago.

508
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:02,917
- Did you take anything?

509
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,167
Oh my God, you still
can, there's still time.

510
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,708
I'm not even joking.

511
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,500
My test is on this stuff.

512
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:13,792
Gypsy, you cannot
have a kid right now.

513
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:17,542
- I just, I mean, it wasn't...

514
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:20,458
Okay, this is the
situation, all right?

515
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,500
- You are not on anything.
- I'm not.

516
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,042
- Your chances are very high.

517
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:27,083
So you could take
something up to 72 hours.

518
00:24:28,208 --> 00:24:30,083
It hasn't been 72 hours has it?

519
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:32,500
- No.
- Do you even care

520
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,000
to take anything?
- I mean, sure.

521
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,833
- Because it seems
like you don't want to.

522
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:40,833
- No, I don't care, like,
I just, I don't feel like

523
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:44,208
it's going to happen, becuase--
- You don't know that though.

524
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:45,708
- It didn't happen last month.

525
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:48,000
- He did it again last month?

526
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,542
Gypsy!

527
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:51,625
- It may have been one time
that it was an accident.

528
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,208
- It doesn't matter.
- But, I mean,

529
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,708
it didn't result in anything.
- It doesn't matter.

530
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,000
Like, it...

531
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:06,000
- You're so stressed out
right now. [laughs]

532
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,375
[pensive music]

533
00:25:08,375 --> 00:25:09,875
- She's gonna learn.

534
00:25:10,958 --> 00:25:12,667
We all want her to
take a step forward

535
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:15,000
and two steps back a
few times, you know,

536
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,542
and on her own.

537
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:20,958
I think that's important
that we give them that space

538
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:25,458
to have some issues and be
able to reconcile those.

539
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,583
You know, that's how you
build a relationship.

540
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,833
That communication skill
helps you to better make it

541
00:25:30,833 --> 00:25:33,625
through bigger and bigger
battles, I find, you know?

542
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:36,750
[engine sputtering]

543
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:41,292
[tense music]

544
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:42,708
- It's like, I'm torn.

545
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,042
I wanna start a family,

546
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:46,917
but then, at the
same time, I'm like,

547
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:49,875
I also wanna give
me and Ryan time

548
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:53,250
to know that this
marriage is going to work

549
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,167
before bringing in a child.

550
00:25:56,167 --> 00:25:58,125
- That is my big thing.

551
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:02,292
Y'all are fresh, in a
sense of living together

552
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,667
for the first time,

553
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,833
y'all are learning, you
know, being dog parents.

554
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:07,208
He just went back to work,

555
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:10,542
and I don't want it to
be six months from now

556
00:26:10,542 --> 00:26:11,833
and you're pregnant,
and you're like,

557
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:14,125
"Do I even want to
be with this man?"

558
00:26:14,125 --> 00:26:16,000
For them to not be
careful right now,

559
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,500
it's kind of scary
when she brings it up

560
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,875
and she hasn't taken
the precaution of,

561
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,833
you know, going
to get that extra,

562
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,500
you know, medication to make
sure that it doesn't happen,

563
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,792
all I could do is
give that advice.

564
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:32,458
- I have, like, what
I ultimately want

565
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,958
in the big picture,

566
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:36,042
but then I also have, like,
the things that I'm like,

567
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:39,042
okay, well, I have a
full plate right now,

568
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:44,292
and I can't donate my time

569
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:48,375
solely to raising a
child at this point.

570
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:52,833
- I want you to get all the
things that you want first.

571
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,708
You won't be able to
get your nose done.

572
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,083
You might not be able
to get your teeth done.

573
00:26:56,083 --> 00:26:56,875
You might not be able
to get your teeth done.

574
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:58,667
- I won't.
- There are things that--

575
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:03,083
- If you're pregnant, you
can't undergo rhinoplasty.

576
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,792
- [Mia] Yeah, there's
a lot of things that--

577
00:27:04,792 --> 00:27:06,500
- We may need to
stop at the store

578
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,875
and get the morning-after pill.

579
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,125
- We will, we can, for sure.
[Gypsy laughs]

580
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,208
[pensive music]

581
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,667
[tense music]

582
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:26,708
I'm thinking about
giving Ryan a call

583
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:29,125
and just letting him know,

584
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,792
you know, that I wanna take
the morning-after pill.

585
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:36,417
- Okay.
- Just as a precautionary.

586
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:38,208
- Do you wanna
call him right now?

587
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:40,083
- Sure.
- Okay.

588
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:41,292
- Okay, heh.

589
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,708
So, oh, wait, there he is.

590
00:27:46,542 --> 00:27:47,750
Hey.

591
00:27:55,042 --> 00:27:57,083
- Yeah, I, uh...

592
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,000
Well, I told Mia about,

593
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,250
you know, a few
nights ago's event.

594
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:17,000
- You know, our little
tussle in the sheets.

595
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,667
- So, I also, like,

596
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,750
you know, told her that,

597
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:31,417
you know--

598
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:38,667
- For contraceptives,

599
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:41,042
like, emergency contraceptives,

600
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:44,208
like, a morning-after
pill type of thing.

601
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:51,375
You don't got
nothing else to say?

602
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,875
- I don't know.

603
00:29:04,292 --> 00:29:05,750
- Well--
- It's 72 hours.

604
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,458
- It's 72 hours, it
hasn't been 72 hours.

605
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,375
- Yeah, it hasn't
been that long.

606
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,083
- Okay.

607
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,292
- Okay.

608
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:20,792
- [Mia] I'm getting a
sister for the first time,

609
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:22,500
so I wanna protect that.

610
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,583
You know, you live
and you learn,

611
00:29:23,583 --> 00:29:24,875
so she's gonna
make those choices

612
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,042
and at the end of the day,

613
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:27,375
she's gonna do what
she wants to do.

614
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,917
But if I could give her
some guidance in a way,

615
00:29:29,917 --> 00:29:31,625
then I absolutely will.

616
00:29:31,625 --> 00:29:32,917
- What are you doing?

617
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:41,125
- All right, well, we're
pulling up to the place.

618
00:29:42,917 --> 00:29:44,042
Love you.
- [Ryan] Bye.

619
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:45,875
- Bye.
- [Ryan] Uh-huh.

620
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:51,375
- He's so mad. [laughs]

621
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:52,583
- [Mia] He's mad?

622
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:55,292
- I could just tell
he's not happy.

623
00:29:55,292 --> 00:29:58,917
- He's not happy about you
telling me or you taking it?

624
00:29:58,917 --> 00:30:00,417
- Me telling you, probably.

625
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,167
- Like, he's not gonna not think

626
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:06,292
you're gonna tell me all about
y'all sex life all the time.

627
00:30:06,292 --> 00:30:07,458
- All the time, right.

628
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:11,042
- But, I mean, I think
this was appropriate enough

629
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,125
for you to get my opinion

630
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,958
and for me to be able
to give you my advice,

631
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,458
as to I think you should.
- Right.

632
00:30:18,458 --> 00:30:20,375
- And, you know, I
guess y'all didn't know

633
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,250
that you could take
it up to 72 hours.

634
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,875
- Nope.
- You wouldn't have known

635
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,250
that if you wouldn't
have talked to me.

636
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,125
Who knows? Maybe you
would've had a little kid

637
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,125
running around in nine months.

638
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,542
- Right.
- You know?

639
00:30:30,542 --> 00:30:31,875
- Yeah.
- But, okay.

640
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:34,208
[gentle music]

641
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:37,458
- Okay, Ryan texted me.

642
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:40,833
- And said?

643
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:45,000
- He said, "You had
to do that on camera?

644
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:50,000
I will pull out from now
on, no worries." [laughs]

645
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,250
- Pull out from now on?

646
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,333
You should've been doing
that all this time.

647
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,417
Oh, I'm not judging
him for it, it happens.

648
00:30:56,417 --> 00:30:59,458
- No, I mean, it happens, it's
whatever, you know, I mean.

649
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:05,083
So I should probably
take it, right?

650
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,667
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah, I should probably--

651
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,125
- Go get it.
- Okay.

652
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,917
I know in the big picture,
Ryan and I want a family.

653
00:31:10,917 --> 00:31:14,708
But Mia's right, like,
that doesn't mean

654
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:17,458
that we can't be responsible.

655
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,875
There's a lot of roadblocks

656
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,125
that we're having
to face right now,

657
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:26,042
and so I just wanna make sure
that I'm 100%, he's 100%,

658
00:31:26,042 --> 00:31:28,500
that we're stable for the child,

659
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,875
and that's just not right now.

660
00:31:30,875 --> 00:31:33,042
Wow, literally one pill.

661
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:37,000
- Yes.
- 40 bucks for one pill.

662
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,375
This is ridiculous.

663
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,750
- It's either 40 bucks
for that one pill

664
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,917
or thousands of
dollars down the road.

665
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:48,875
What do you want?
- You're right, you're right.

666
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,375
Down the hatch.

667
00:31:53,375 --> 00:31:55,292
- [Mia] Mm, dinner.

668
00:31:55,292 --> 00:31:57,375
[tense music]

669
00:32:02,083 --> 00:32:05,333
- Cheers, to not
getting pregnant.

670
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:12,542
- [Mia] Good job, I'm proud.

671
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,542
I'm glad you were smart
enough to take something.

672
00:32:14,542 --> 00:32:16,167
- Honestly, I mean,
I feel the same way.

673
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,083
Like, I wanna make sure
that going into it,

674
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:22,125
we know, 10 toes down,

675
00:32:22,125 --> 00:32:26,667
that this is something
that is for the long haul

676
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,375
and we're both ready.

677
00:32:28,375 --> 00:32:33,083
'Cause, I mean, even
if we were both ready

678
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:36,250
emotionally and mentally,

679
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,000
I just don't think that
the timing for right now

680
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,333
is where it needs to be.

681
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:51,042
I think I'll know when I'm
ready when I can fully say

682
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:56,083
that I could put myself
aside and put a child first,

683
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,208
and right now, I can't say that.

684
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,208
Oh, my Uber's here.

685
00:33:04,208 --> 00:33:06,875
- All right, I'll help you out.
- All right.

686
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:08,375
- Okay.
- All right.

687
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:11,583
- [Mia] Today was very,
like, different for me.

688
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:13,167
Like, I never had a sister

689
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:15,417
I could go shopping with or
get my nails done, you know?

690
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:18,625
And I feel like I'm getting
a sister and a friend.

691
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:22,125
I hope to be somebody
that she could talk to

692
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,375
that's not Mom or Dad.

693
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:27,208
That's somebody that
could understand,

694
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,833
but also give advice, but
listen when she needs it,

695
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:33,542
and, like, I want
to be that for her.

696
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:37,875
- All right, Mimi, I love you.

697
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:39,625
- All right, I love
you too, be careful.

698
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:40,708
- All right, I will.

699
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,208
- Let me know whenever
y'all make it back.

700
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:43,333
- [Gypsy] All right,
I'll text you.

701
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,458
- All right, don't slip.

702
00:33:44,458 --> 00:33:45,917
- All right
- All right, love you.

703
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:47,167
- [Gypsy] Love you.

704
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,167
[gentle music]

705
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,167
This is Ryan flipping out,

706
00:34:09,167 --> 00:34:11,958
because I told my sister
about our difficulties.

707
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,792
- No, you told the
world about it.

708
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,667
Not your sister, the world.

709
00:34:35,917 --> 00:34:37,333
[door thuds]

710
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,333
[birds chirping]

711
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:38,208
[gentle music]

712
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:51,375
- He needs to understand
that I have been living

713
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:54,542
my whole life in a cage.

714
00:36:54,542 --> 00:36:59,208
How I used to be with my
mom, I felt powerless.

715
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:01,042
When I am feeling powerless,

716
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:05,500
my reaction is to
take back control.

717
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,500
I'm just trying to
find warning signs,

718
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,208
and maybe I'm looking too hard,

719
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,458
maybe I'm overanalyzing,

720
00:37:11,458 --> 00:37:15,208
but I wanna make sure that
I take care of myself.

721
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:24,167
- You know, with Gypsy and her
childhood traumas and stuff,

722
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:25,750
I have to be careful,

723
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:29,958
because I don't want her to
think that is the situation,

724
00:37:29,958 --> 00:37:31,375
'cause it's not,
it's not at all.

725
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,875
You know, I'm not her mother.

726
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,875
I'm not trying to prevent
her from living her life.

727
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,000
You know, like, it just...

728
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:42,958
I hate when she feels that,
like, if I hit a trigger

729
00:37:42,958 --> 00:37:44,375
and feels that for a second,

730
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,042
it makes me take a
step back and be like,

731
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:49,792
"Okay, well, let's rethink it,
and then we'll come back to it,"

732
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:53,417
because, you know,
that's not who I am.

733
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:57,708
- I feel like, you know,

734
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,875
there's gonna come another
time and another time

735
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,958
where he gets in his
emotions about something

736
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:07,208
and wants our whole world
to be just about us.

737
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,750
And I'm gonna
continue keeping up

738
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,750
that feeling and
that demeanor of,

739
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,417
that's my family and I can
talk to them if I want to.

740
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:22,750
But I will say that
if there comes a time

741
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:28,042
that I see that I am being
controlled, I'm leaving.

742
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:30,292
[tense music]

743
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:50,750
- Take this little part here,

744
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,708
just slide it up
underneath your face

745
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:54,292
kind of on the shirt
right down here.

746
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,583
[tense music]

747
00:39:12,292 --> 00:39:13,625
- I've never done
an interview before,

748
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,208
because, in the past, I
didn't wanna play a part

749
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,875
in the media circus.

750
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:21,875
- It is, it's crazy.

751
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:23,958
Yeah, she's blown up more
than I ever thought she could,

752
00:39:23,958 --> 00:39:25,875
you know, or wanted her to.

753
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,542
We talked about what
kind of dog we wanted,

754
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:30,708
and I always wanted a husky
my whole life as a kid.

755
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:34,583
And if I got one, I was
gonna name him Balto,

756
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,333
and she loved that,

757
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,708
'cause she always loved
that movie as well.

758
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,417
And, you know, yeah,
she just told me

759
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,667
that was her
favorite dog as well,

760
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,333
and that she always
wanted a husky as well.

761
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,708
We actually planned on
that for our future,

762
00:39:45,708 --> 00:39:47,750
that we were gonna get a husky.

763
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,625
That was one of the things
that we bonded over.

764
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,500
Come here, drop it.

765
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:55,375
Ready?

766
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:58,500
We were not together when
I got Parker, you know.

767
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
That was years after
our separation.

768
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:09,042
- Well, I'm more separated
from her than ever,

769
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:11,667
and I just feel like

770
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,917
it's important for me to
share my thoughts and opinions

771
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:18,708
on her and the time
that we spent together,

772
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,958
and everything will
unfold as it should.

773
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,083
[tense music]

774
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:27,333
- [Producer] Were you
supportive of the marriage?

775
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,917
- No, I wasn't.

776
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:31,625
- Anytime that anybody
has reservations

777
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,417
about our relationship,

778
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:35,708
they're not in your
favor so much anymore.

779
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:38,125
- What things would you
change about your nose?

780
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:40,500
- That looks so much better.
- Wow, that is crazy!

781
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,875
- Woke Ryan up, I
said, "I miss Ken."

782
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:47,042
- Gypsy's gone to her
parents without me.

783
00:40:47,042 --> 00:40:50,458
It did hurt not
being asked to come.

784
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:53,083
- Captain Gypsy Rose.

785
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:55,167
- [Ryan] So I still can't
get a video call, huh?

786
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:57,250
Is there somebody there
you don't want me to see?

787
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:01,458
- All right, well, I gotta go.
- [Ryan] All right, fine.

788
00:41:01,458 --> 00:41:03,042
- Sometimes it's
actually really nice

789
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:04,208
not to have him around.
