00:00:01,917 --> 00:00:04,875
[dramatic music]

2
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:06,292
- [Reporter] Startling
new developments

3
00:00:06,292 --> 00:00:07,125
in an already bizarre

4
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:09,000
murder case in Springfield.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,542
- [Reporter 1] 24-year-old
Gypsy Blanchard admitted

6
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:13,208
to killing her mother,
Dee Dee Blanchard.

7
00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,292
- [Reporter 2] Gypsy shocking
many of those who knew her

8
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:17,167
because she was not
using a wheelchair.

9
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:18,875
It is a twisted story.

10
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,625
- [Reporter 3] Experts
say she's the victim

11
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,542
of Munchhausen by Proxy Syndrome

12
00:00:22,542 --> 00:00:24,750
and suffered at the
hands of her mother.

13
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,792
- [Gypsy] From a very young
age, my mother had claimed

14
00:00:27,792 --> 00:00:32,042
that I had seizure disorders,
hearing impairment.

15
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:35,500
I was forced to
use a wheelchair.

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,333
As I got older, she
started shaving my hair off

17
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,417
and telling people
that I had cancer.

18
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:43,792
- [Kristy] Gypsy
was Dee's daughter,

19
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,000
but also her prisoner.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,542
- [Gypsy] Doctors
is what I knew,

21
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:51,417
hospitals is what I knew,
surgeries is what I knew.

22
00:00:51,417 --> 00:00:55,000
I wanted that life that
I was living to be over.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,875
- [Rod] I was gone a lot,
I wasn't the best dad.

24
00:00:57,875 --> 00:01:01,167
I shoulda went and checked,
and I had suspicions.

25
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,542
One of the bigger regrets I have

26
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:06,917
is not making her feel
that she could come to me.

27
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,625
- [Gypsy] I met this
guy, Nick, online.

28
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:12,208
I thought that he could be the
one that would take me away

29
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:15,083
from this existence
living with my mother.

30
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,417
He starts talking to me about

31
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:19,417
how he would kill
my mother for me.

32
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:24,125
He arrives at the house,
I get down on the ground,

33
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,333
and I hear screaming,

34
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:29,667
and that's when I
hear her call my name.

35
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:33,667
And she's like,
"Gypsy, help me."

36
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:40,042
And to this day, I can't
get that out of my head.

37
00:01:40,042 --> 00:01:41,500
- [Mike] What in
the world happened?

38
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,375
You know, we didn't
know what to think.

39
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,708
- [Kristy] Oh, if I
could go back in time,

40
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,875
I would rewrite the script.

41
00:01:46,875 --> 00:01:50,125
- [Mike] While, yes, she
was involved in the murder,

42
00:01:50,125 --> 00:01:53,500
she just went from
one prison to another.

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,042
- [Reporter] Gypsy pleaded
guilty to second degree murder,

44
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:59,250
she was sentenced
to 10 years in jail.

45
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,917
- [Gypsy] Since my
incarceration, I am finally free

46
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:06,333
to build relationships
and friendships.

47
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:09,708
And I have been
keeping a secret.

48
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,542
I am engaged!

49
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:13,208
[chuckles]

50
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:15,875
- [Ryan] Her story,
you know, just hit me.

51
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:18,125
And I thought,
"Gosh, she's cute."

52
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:19,667
- [Mia] Fan boying huh?

53
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,208
- Well, yeah, well,
yeah, at that point,

54
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,500
yeah, at that point
I guess I was.

55
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,333
- I wish they would
wait a little bit.

56
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,458
- [Kristy] Why now?

57
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:27,625
Why rush?

58
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,875
- [Reporter] Gypsy Rose
reportedly married a man

59
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,125
named Ryan Scott Anderson
in 2022 while in prison.

60
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:34,417
- [Gypsy] He calms,

61
00:02:34,417 --> 00:02:38,333
almost like a storm
that's inside my soul.

62
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,708
- Gypsy Blanchard
will be set free.

63
00:02:39,708 --> 00:02:41,375
- [Reporter] The
Department of Corrections

64
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,708
granted her early release.

65
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:45,042
- Gypsy Blanchard says
she's ready to go home

66
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:47,500
to Louisiana with her husband.

67
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,208
- [Gypsy] I feel like
the Gypsy Blanchard

68
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,625
that entered this institution

69
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:55,458
has been through a
great deal in her life

70
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:57,417
but has overcome a lot.

71
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,375
- [Mia] When she gets
in the real world,

72
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,042
she don't know
what it's like yet.

73
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:04,292
- But wouldn't you prefer
her have somebody to lean on?

74
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:06,625
- [Mia] Yeah, but she has us.

75
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,292
- [Kristy] There will
be bumps in the road,

76
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:10,000
but that's what
she has family for.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,292
- I just want her to be happy,

78
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:13,500
that's all I really care about.

79
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,667
- [Gypsy] I want to
live a simple life

80
00:03:16,667 --> 00:03:19,042
that everybody else
takes for granted.

81
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:22,375
I don't wanna be
remembered as the girl

82
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,042
who killed her mother

83
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,208
who

84
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,417
was abused by her mother.

85
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:32,208
I want this to be,
okay, you know my story.

86
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:35,750
Alright, now let's see
what I do with my life.

87
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,667
[suspenseful music]

88
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:42,833

famous prisoners

00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,375

- [Reporter] Her case has
been turned into documentaries

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and a TV series, some even see

97
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,708
Gypsy Rose as a
sympathetic hero.

98
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,500
- [Reporter 1] Now the
32 year-old Blanchard

99
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,917
moving forward with
the world watching.

100
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,500
- [Reporter 2] Whether you
look at Twitter, X or Facebook,

101
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,458
even TikTok, it's
trending everywhere.

102
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,250
- Tomorrow she is
getting released.

103
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,833
Wonder if she'll get TikTok.

104
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:17,875
- This woman is iconic,
like she's a legend.

105
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,500
- This is insane, like
Gypsy Rose Blanchard

106
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,167
is getting out of prison.

107
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,042
[ominous music]

108
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,708
[wind blowing]

109
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,917
[locks clicking]

110
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,708
- Hi.

111
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm a little nervous.

112
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:57,250
- [giggles]

113
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,375
- I don't know, I just
always get nervous.

114
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,250
It's like little jitters.

115
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,417
- [laughs] I know, it's so nice.

116
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:17,500
- I feel like ever
since my case was

117
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,708
all over the media,
all over the news,

118
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:22,667
people have been on
this journey with me.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,292
And I think that I've outgrown

120
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,583
this prison version of
myself that I think a lot

121
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:33,083
of people have come
to associate me with.

122
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,750
I wanna be Gypsy Rose Blanchard,

123
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:37,958
a survivor,

124
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,375
an advocate for
people that have been

125
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:44,042
through what I
have been through.

126
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:49,375
And I wanna be someone that
my family could be proud of.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,958
[uplifting guitar music]

128
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,583
- [Ryan] Oh, you decorating
the tree, I like it.

129
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,750
- I like a lot of
lights, a lot of lights.

130
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,500
- [Ryan] Do you?
- Oh yeah. [whispering]

131
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,125
- What's her favorite
kind of cake?

132
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:20,083
- White icing with buttercream.

133
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:21,458
- What do y'all want on it?

134
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:23,167
- Umm...

135
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,167
- Like on, like
letters on the cake?

136
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:25,958
- Yeah, like a saying.

137
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:26,833
- [Mia] We're not gonna have

138
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,250
a plain white cake.

139
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,167
- Yeah, just say,
"Welcome home Gypsy Rose."

140
00:06:30,167 --> 00:06:32,750
or have like couple roses on it.

141
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,583
- I'm overwhelmed.

142
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,583
Yesterday I was
saying, you know,

143
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,917
"Eight years left,"
and now it's here.

144
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:42,042
[melancholy music]

145
00:06:42,042 --> 00:06:45,375
Countdown her last night there.

146
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,042
Tomorrow night
she'll be with us.

147
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,750
- [Ryan] You need any help
dad, you need anything?

148
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,042
- [Rod] No, I'm good right now.

149
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,042
Everybody keeps asking me,
you know, "What you think,

150
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:01,542
"how it's gonna go, you know,
are they gonna last or not?"

151
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,667
And I mean, this is
a whole new chapter.

152
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:07,542
Everything's new and she's
got stuff to look forward to.

153
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:09,250
You know, you have
to make mistakes

154
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,542
and learn from them, you know,

155
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:16,917
and everybody could tell
her how they feel, and

156
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,750
but, at the end of the day,
she's still gonna make her

157
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,958
choice and that's what she
did through this you know,

158
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,292
deciding to get married
in prison and everything.

159
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:26,875
And I wanted her to
make that choice.

160
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:30,167
And I want her to like
have to live with it

161
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:31,792
and learn from that.

162
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,000
- [Ryan] Oh man, smells good.

163
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,792
Marrying Gypsy wasn't easy.

164
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,375
Of course, I asked for his
approval and he gave it to me.

165
00:07:41,375 --> 00:07:46,542
But you know, you never know
if you truly get that approval.

166
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,458
It just smells better
and better in here

167
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:51,583
each time I come, you know.

168
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,708
Right now I just
want this to work.

169
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:58,042
You know, everybody's giving
us a 50 50 shot, you know?

170
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,708
But I feel it's 100 percent.

171
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,333
Can you believe this
day's actually here?

172
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:03,917
- [Rod] I know it, bro.

173
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,333
- Isn't it crazy?

174
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,750
I mean, I've only
waited three years.

175
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,042
Y'all been waiting
eight and a half.

176
00:08:08,042 --> 00:08:09,417
- I know.

177
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:10,708
- Part of me like has to
put that in perspective,

178
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,292
y'all been waiting so long

179
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:15,375
and I come in and
I go pick her up.

180
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:16,833
- [Rod] Yeah.

181
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:19,125
I ain't gonna lie, I'm jealous
bro but that's all good.

182
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,625
[bacon sizzling]

183
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,417
- [Ryan] And I'm the lucky
one that gets to pick her up.

184
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:24,042
A lot of people wanted
that honor, I got it.

185
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:26,833
I don't know how, I
pinch myself sometimes.

186
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:28,167
- [Rod] I'm going to
tell you this though.

187
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,208
- [Ryan] What's that boss?

188
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,500
You pick her up and y'all do

189
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,000
some crazy [bleep],
I got a lot of guns.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,375
[ominous music]

191
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:36,625
[ominous music]

192
00:08:41,042 --> 00:08:42,708
- It is hot in here.

193
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,167
It is so hot, man.

194
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,708
- [Gypsy] What makes Ryan
like so different from my exes

195
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,208
- [Gypsy] What makes Ryan
like so different from my exes

196
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,292
is because I think with
my exes, they were in love

197
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:04,458
with the idea of me rather
than they were in love with me.

198
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,125
They were so hyped up

199
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,125
to wanna get to know

200
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:12,375
the Gypsy Blanchard they
saw on the TV screen.

201
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:16,417
And when I showed
that I'm human,

202
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:19,917
I'm not a character,
I have flaws

203
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:21,250
because

204
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,042
the level of emotional baggage

205
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,833
that I carry,

206
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:28,708
I put that so deep inside

207
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:31,583
that the only person
that gets to see that

208
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,667
is my significant other.

209
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:39,292
And I kind of feel like
everyone else ran and he didn't.

210
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:42,708
- [Ryan] [nervous sigh]

211
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,542
I'm super excited,
super nervous,

212
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,000
but in a good nervous,
like it's ready

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,458
for, it's actually
happening, you know.

214
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,667
I didn't think this
day would come.

215
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,875
I always talked about
it and, you know,

216
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:55,292
I remember when a year happened

217
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:58,750
and I just made a
countdown clock on my phone

218
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,042
and little by
little I'd check it

219
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:03,708
and be like, "Okay,
250 days, 100 days."

220
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,708
Then when it got to
like 30, I was like,

221
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:09,208
"Baby, we're at 30 days,"
like that month flew by too.

222
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:12,167
So I think the countdown
clock says two days.

223
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,667
So one day,

224
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,125
it's crazy, it's crazy.

225
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:19,375
[gentle music]

226
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:23,833
- [Mia] I like Ryan, I do,
nice guy, you know, respectful.

227
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:29,583
But until I see them
interact one-on-one together,

228
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,500
I think I will be skeptical

229
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,917
of the whole situation

230
00:10:32,917 --> 00:10:35,542
until I see it for myself.

231
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,875
I don't want
anything to hurt her.

232
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:40,208
But I'm happy if she's
happy and I'll support

233
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,875
whatever decision
she wants to make,

234
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,667
I'm there 100 percent,

235
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,375
I'll always be there.

236
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,250
How old are you?

237
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,792
- [Ryan] 37.

238
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,250
- [Mia] Wait, your birthday's?

239
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,208
- June.

240
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,458
- [Mia] June too?

241
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,042
- What day in June?

242
00:10:53,042 --> 00:10:53,750
- [Mia] 25th.

243
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,792
- I'm 23rd right on,

244
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:56,208
you're a cancer too, right on.

245
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:57,125
- Oh really?

246
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:58,042
I didn't know that.

247
00:10:58,042 --> 00:11:00,875
- And we gonna get
along just fine.

248
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,458
- [Kristy] Gypsy and I, over
the years, have created a bond

249
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:12,083
and, you know, she felt
comfortable calling me mom.

250
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,542
And like I told her the
first time we went to court,

251
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:19,875
she thought after
we heard everything

252
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,167
that we were gonna leave.

253
00:11:22,167 --> 00:11:26,958
And I do not condone what
she did but I understood.

254
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:28,958
And I put my hand on that glass

255
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:30,958
and she put her
hand and I'm like,

256
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,917
"You know, I will
never leave your side,"

257
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,500
because that's what moms do.

258
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,417
We protect,

259
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,333
we love,

260
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,250
we love hard,

261
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,417
we protect harder

262
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,083
but also

263
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,750
the bond.

264
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,417
- [Ryan] Alright, party people.

265
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:55,417
- [Kristy] Heading out?

266
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:56,292
- [Ryan] I gotta go.

267
00:11:56,292 --> 00:11:57,125
- [Kristy] Be careful.

268
00:11:57,125 --> 00:12:00,458
- Alright, next
time y'all see me,

269
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,750
I will have ole girl with me.

270
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,542
- Go get her brother.

271
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:04,375
- I will, Dad.

272
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:05,292
I love you man.

273
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:05,958
- [Rod] I love you brother.

274
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:06,958
- Alright guys, love y'all.

275
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:07,792
- [Kristy] Love you too baby.

276
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:08,667
Be careful.

277
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,875
- Always.

278
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:10,708
- [Kristy] Try to get
some sleep tonight.

279
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:11,583
- [Mia] Yeah.
- I will.

280
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,917
I'm gonna do the best I can.

281
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,208
- So much, honestly, you know.

282
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,333
Just neglect, general
neglect, you know.

283
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:36,583
I mean I could have
done so much more,

284
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,333
dug in a little
deeper, you know.

285
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:44,417
I think there's some
reconciling that we have to do.

286
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:49,667
I think we probably both have
questions for each other.

287
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,750
But we need to start
it on a good foundation

288
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,208
where we can be
honest, you know,

289
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:58,875
of how we failed in the past,
things we've done wrong.

290
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,917
Could start something
fresh from there knowing

291
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,667
where we stand with
each other, you know,

292
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,542
we got a long way
to go, I know that.

293
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:11,000
You know, it's a gonna be
a tough balance, you know?

294
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:16,292
[upbeat music]

295
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,125
- [Ryan] Hey baby.

296
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,417
- [Ryan] Are you?

297
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,042
- [Ryan] Well baby, you
know, you gotta think

298
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,792
this is your last day in prison.

299
00:13:41,042 --> 00:13:43,083
- [Ryan] They just asked me
what we plan to do tonight

300
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:46,333
and I said, "love
on you, sleep."

301
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,000
- [Gypsy] [chuckling]

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,542
- [Ryan] Baby, I wanna say
this is the prison calling me.

303
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:53,042
Can you hold on a second?

304
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,458
- Hang on.

305
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:58,917
This is Ryan.

306
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,458
- [Ryan] Yeah, hey,
what's up Major?

307
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,958
- No sir, I haven't had
any, anything that's

308
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,500
out of the ordinary.

309
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,958
- Yeah, what time you thinking?

310
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,208
- [Ryan] Okay.

311
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,875
- Absolutely,
absolutely, like I said,

312
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,083
just gimme a call,
I'll be in town.

313
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,500
- All right brother. Bye.

314
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:47,792
- The prison, he was just
double checking where I was at.

315
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,500
I tried to get him to tell me

316
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,167
the exact time and
he would not do it.

317
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,375
Damn, he wouldn't gimme a time.

318
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,000
- [Ryan] No, I haven't
baby, but I will.

319
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:03,917
- [Ryan] I love you too.

320
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,000
Bye baby.

321
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,125
That's Gypsy Rose.

322
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,708
[gentle guitar music]

323
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,958
She's so good.

324
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,250
I love her.

325
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,417
That's my wife.

326
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,333
Really, man, I'm not even
gonna lie, I'm so nervous.

327
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:32,375
I get to finally
have my wife home.

328
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,583
Still, gonna be different,
her being at home,

329
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,250
it's a new ball game,

330
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,333
but I'm ready for
it, I've been ready.

331
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,542
but I'm ready for
it, I've been ready.

332
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:42,167
[gentle music]

333
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,208
- Gypsy Rose Blanchard,
the most famous victim

334
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:48,792
of Munchausen by
Proxy is going to be

335
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:50,750
paroled tomorrow,
December 28th.

336
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,333
- This has been
very controversial.

337
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,667
Some people believe that
she should not have gotten

338
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:55,833
any time, some people believe

339
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,250
she should have
gotten more time.

340
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,208
- You guys, I
cannot stop thinking

341
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,000
about Gypsy Rose Blanchard
getting out of prison.

342
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,583
[upbeat rock music]

343
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,125
- Gypsy says that she's bracing
herself for the spotlight

344
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,875
and scrutiny she's
going to come home to,

345
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,542
but that she's looking
forward to spending time

346
00:16:10,542 --> 00:16:12,250
with her father
and her stepmother,

347
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,042
and her new husband, Ryan.

348

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,542
- [Ryan] Cherry peach Lemonade.
Don't hit it too hard.

526
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:29,542
- [Gypsy] [coughs]

527
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:32,083
It's just a little
harsh. [coughs]

528
00:24:32,083 --> 00:24:33,083
Damn.

529
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,458
- It's harsh at first.

530
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,083
- It's so harsh. Ugh.

531
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,375
- I'm sorry baby.
That was harsh.

532
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:40,833
- Oh, it's okay.

533
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,000
- [Ryan] Are you getting sleepy.

534
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,125
- [Gypsy] Little bit.

535
00:24:46,125 --> 00:24:48,792
This bed feel so comfortable.

536
00:24:48,792 --> 00:24:51,625
- You the one that
feels comfortable.

537
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,042
- Just wanna lay
in it for a second.

538
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:54,250
- Lay down.

539
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,042
- Yeah. That feels nice.

540
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:55,958
- That feel good?

541
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,125
I just wanna hold you.

542
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,708
I missed you.

543
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:05,083
- I was cold all night,
but I'm not cold anymore.

544
00:25:05,083 --> 00:25:06,833
- You not? Look, I
can actually rub up.

545
00:25:06,833 --> 00:25:09,250
- [laughs] No one's
telling you don't do that.

546
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,125
- That's so hot. I'm
actually love on you now.

547
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:16,000
[guitar strings]

548
00:25:20,125 --> 00:25:21,417
[clock ticking]

549
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:24,500
- Am I the only one that woke
up looking for live footage

550
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,000
of Gypsy Rose being released?

551
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,708
What the heck?

552
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:29,917
Where's the live footage?

553
00:25:29,917 --> 00:25:32,208
- Gypsy Rose Blanchard
is now a free woman.

554
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:34,583
She has just been released
from prison in apparently

555
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,292
a very secretive way.

556
00:25:36,292 --> 00:25:39,792
[dramatic music]

557
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:41,917
- We don't know where she
is or what she's doing,

558
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:45,167
but it should stay that way
until she decides to share.

559
00:25:47,667 --> 00:25:49,042
- [Ryan] Alright, baby.

560
00:25:49,042 --> 00:25:52,000
- [Gypsy] Did I show
you my first selfie?

561
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
That's first selfie.

562
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:53,875
- Oh.

563
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:56,417
Fine as ever.

564
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:57,542
- [Gypsy] [giggles]
It looks good?

565
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:58,750
- [Ryan] Yeah.
Looks really good.

566
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,083
- [Gypsy] How do you
text people back?

567
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:03,042
- [Ryan] Alright, so
you click on messages.

568
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:03,917
- Okay.

569
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:05,583
- [Ryan] And you text the person

570
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,208
and well, you'll
learn sweetheart.

571
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,708
- Wow, it's even got
like smart thingies

572
00:26:12,708 --> 00:26:15,542
where I said we're
just leaving the,

573
00:26:15,542 --> 00:26:18,917
and it says house,
office, airport.

574
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:19,792
Creepy.

575
00:26:21,417 --> 00:26:25,083
- It is so cute. How you don't
know that stuff. Gimme kiss.

576
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,458
So cute.

577
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,458
- This is my first cell phone.

578
00:26:27,458 --> 00:26:29,125
- [Ryan] I know. It is adorable.

579
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,208
- [Gypsy] So once
we get out of town,

580
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:33,833
I'm gonna wear these
boots that don't fit.

581
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,708
- [Ryan] Right, I gotta.

582
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:35,500
- To get out into the car.

583
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,833
- [Ryan] Yep.

584
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,042
- And then we're gonna
go find somewhere

585
00:26:38,042 --> 00:26:40,083
where we can get some
shoes that do fit.

586
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:46,167
- Oh, last night
was great. Great.

587
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:49,917
We got to, yeah, we got
to love on each other.

588
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:51,875
- We got to consummate
our marriage.

589
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:55,708
- [Ryan] We did get to do
that. She was so nervous.

590
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:56,792
- [Gypsy] Not for
long. [laughs loudly]

591
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,125
- [Ryan] Not for
long. She got into it.

592
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:01,708
- [laughs]

593
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,875
- [Ryan] No, it was great.

594
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,208
- That's all the
details y'all get.

595
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,042
- [Ryan] It was great, I
married the right woman.

596
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:05,917
Let tell you that

597
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,208
- [Gypsy] He always use to say

598
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,542
'I'm a dynamo'.

599
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:11,583
And I'm like, every
guy says that.

600
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:13,375
No, he's a dynamo.

601
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:14,208
- Y'all heard that?

602
00:27:14,208 --> 00:27:15,625
[clicking noises]

603
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:16,833
- Oh my God.

604
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:20,833
- It's cold.

605
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,875
Alright back seat.

606
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,542
Woo it's cold.

607
00:27:41,542 --> 00:27:43,625
[upbeat music]

608
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:48,417
- Where's my brush? My
hair looks like [bleep].

609
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,292
- It's fine.

610
00:27:50,542 --> 00:27:52,542
- [Ryan] Alright,
we're rolling out.

611
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,042
- [Gypsy] Alright.

612
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:56,250
Whew okay now,

613
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,625
long car ride.

614
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:04,333
[upbeat music]

615
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:05,750
So this is Chillicothe.

616
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,708
This is where I've been
living this whole time.

617
00:28:07,708 --> 00:28:08,750
- [Ryan] Yep.

618
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,833
Oh, I love your glasses.

619
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:19,625
- [Gypsy] I know
they are adorable.

620
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,292
Yeah, okay, I can see
a little better though.

621
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:24,708
- How was it being in
the room by yourself?

622
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:25,542
- When you went
to take a shower?

623
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:26,542
- [Ryan] Yeah.

624
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:28,292
- I was putting on my makeup

625
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:28,917
and it was really nice.

626
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:30,208
It was just kind of.

627
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,583
- [Ryan] It's just
nice being a alone.

628
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,875
- It was just nice kind
of doing my own thing.

629
00:28:32,875 --> 00:28:34,583
- Yeah, that's what
I'm what I'm saying.

630
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:38,083
- It's just a whole
different feel to life.

631
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:46,042
[gentle guitar]

632
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:50,833
- [Rod] Oh, hey.

633
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,083
- [Corrine] How are you?

634
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:52,875
- Good.

635
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,083
- [Corrine] Good.

636
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:54,917
- Better than I've
ever been, I guess.

637
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:56,542
- [Kristy] Oh God, Mike.

638
00:28:56,542 --> 00:28:58,167
- What's up buddy?

639
00:28:58,167 --> 00:28:59,833
How you doing?

640
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:00,625
- [Mike] Good.
How are you doing?

641
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,208
- Good man.

642
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,750
- [Mike] I've been doing this
for sixteen and a half years.

643
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,208
I've handled probably
over four thousand cases.

644
00:29:06,208 --> 00:29:10,208
There's really never
been one like this.

645
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:14,458
It was extremely hard
for me to accept that

646
00:29:14,458 --> 00:29:18,375
her going to prison was going
to have to be an outcome.

647
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:21,250
This is the final chapter of

648
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,917
what I worked so hard on.

649
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:27,542
And what I really hoped
would be the outcome

650
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:31,125
for Gypsy is she finally
gets to come home to her dad,

651
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:34,417
to her stepmom, and she
gets to live a normal life.

652
00:29:34,417 --> 00:29:36,375
- I don't know what
y'all have planned today,

653
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,708
but y'all, could even
sleep on this. [laughs]

654
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:40,667
I mean.

655
00:29:40,667 --> 00:29:41,958
- We're here.

656
00:29:41,958 --> 00:29:42,875
- [Corrine] Yeah, that's what
we had planned.

657
00:29:42,875 --> 00:29:43,708
- [Mike] Yep.

658
00:29:43,708 --> 00:29:44,792
- [Rod] Awesome.

659
00:29:44,792 --> 00:29:46,417
- It's too important.

660
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,375
- Broadway Shoes. There we go.

661
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:51,750
- [Gypsy] Okay.

662
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,208
Okay, I gotta walk
in these things.

663
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:02,375
- [Ryan] Baby,
just for a minute.

664
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:03,292
- Alright.

665
00:30:03,292 --> 00:30:04,167
Oh it's cold.

666
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:07,875
- Ah.

667
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,958
- Thanks.

668
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:11,542
- [Ryan] Welcome
sweetheart.

669
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,542
[trunk lid clunks]

670
00:30:13,542 --> 00:30:14,292
You're covered.
[chuckles]

671
00:30:14,292 --> 00:30:15,708
- [Gypsy] [laughs]
- I'm huge.

672
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:16,708
- [Gypsy] It's warm.
- [Ryan] Alright.

673
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,875
- [Gypsy] All right,
hold my hand.

674
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,250
- Come on baby.

675
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,042
- [Gypsy] I'm trying to
not walk extremely fast

676
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,875
so I don't trip and die.

677
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:27,917
- [Ryan] Who is that?
People we don't know.

678
00:30:33,292 --> 00:30:35,792
[tense music]

679
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:46,708
- [Man] Where we
going? Where you going?

680
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,458
[tense music]
[Gypsy speaks indistinctly]

681
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,375
- It was fun.

682
00:31:21,542 --> 00:31:23,125
- Bought these new shoes.

683
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,083
- Lots of them.

684
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,250
- Nope.

685
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,333
[car doors thud]

686
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:38,875
- What the hell? Who was that?

687
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:48,333
- You see him? He's
in the car right now.

688
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:49,708
Like, I just don't
want these [bleep]

689
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,375
to know where we're going.

690
00:31:52,375 --> 00:31:55,750
[suspenseful music]

691
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,667
We're, we're being followed.

692
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,542
Can't we like call the police?

693
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:01,375
- [Gypsy] Ugh.

694
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:02,750
[engine revving]

695
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,042
- [Ryan] Damn I just want to go.

696
00:32:05,042 --> 00:32:06,167
- Don't crash.

697
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,042
- [Gypsy] Hey dad,
we're being followed

698
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:12,833
by media right now,

699
00:32:12,833 --> 00:32:14,083
but we don't know what to do.

700
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,167
So, what happens if
they're gonna show up,

701
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:19,083
they follow us to the
Airbnb? What are we gonna do?

702
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,667
- [Rod] I would say
just come here darling.

703
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:21,125
- [Mike] Yep.

704
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,083
- Just come here.

705
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,750
Y'all can park in the garage.

706
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,083
- [Gypsy] Alright.

707
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,500
- [Rod] And we'll just
close the curtains. I mean.

708
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,542
- We'll deal with it.
- [Rod] We won't let 'em come on

709
00:32:27,542 --> 00:32:28,542
the property or anything.

710
00:32:28,542 --> 00:32:29,792
- [Gypsy] Alright.

711
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:33,167
- Alright, will do, I think
we're about 30 minutes out.

712
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,958
- Well, can't wait
to see you, darling.

713
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,542
- [Gypsy] I know. I love you.

714
00:32:36,542 --> 00:32:36,875
See you soon. Bye.

715
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:38,042
See you soon. Bye.

716
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,542
- [Ryan] That's
just crazy, baby.

717
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,958
They must have been
on us the whole time.

718
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,375
- Maybe. Maybe they knew
what hotel we were in.

719
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:53,625
[clocking ticking]

720
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,042
[clock ticking]

721
00:32:55,042 --> 00:32:56,542
- We now have the
details of Gypsy Rose

722
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,042
Blanchard's prison release

723
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,292
and the first pictures of
her since she's been freed.

724
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:02,208
- And as she was
leaving, people noticed

725
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,917
that she did not
have on any shoes.

726
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:07,208
- Literally this picture
of her bag went viral

727
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:09,458
because people
were talking about

728
00:33:09,458 --> 00:33:12,500
and debating every single
item that she had in this bag.

729
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,417
- Buying new shoes, Gypsy was
asked if she had any plans.

730
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:16,708
And she responded.

731
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,333
- Lots of them.

732
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:20,333
- And she's already
planned her first outing.

733
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,292
She's going to be going
apparently to a Chief's game

734
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,042
and hoping to meet Taylor Swift.

735
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:27,125
- Even though she knows
Taylor may not be there

736
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,292
because of her tour schedule,

737
00:33:28,292 --> 00:33:29,417
she's still going
to the Chiefs game

738
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:31,208
because apparently she's a
big football fan.

739
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:33,375
- All we can hope is
that Gypsy is happy

740
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,625
and able to live her best life.

741
00:33:37,917 --> 00:33:40,125
- Look, you see
that right there?

742
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:40,958
- Oh, okay.

743
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,375
- That white car.

744
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:45,125
- Okay, that white
utility looking truck.

745
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,500
- [Ryan] Yeah.

746
00:33:51,042 --> 00:33:53,000
- Hope, okay, he's going
the other way, so hopefully.

747
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,375
- No he's not, he's right there.

748
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,458
- Oh, nevermind.

749
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:57,292
- [Ryan] Just pulled
in behind him.

750
00:33:57,292 --> 00:34:00,042
I hope he didn't get my number.

751
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,042
- [Gypsy] I don't
know how that works.

752
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,250
- [Ryan] I got a voicemail.

753
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,542
Let's see who this
voicemail is from.

754
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,542
- Alright, I better call him.

755
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:15,375
- [Ryan] Here you go.

756
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,208
- Yeah.

757
00:34:16,208 --> 00:34:17,000
- We'll call 'em right now.

758
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,792
- Alright.

759
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:25,417
- [Officer] Interstate this is.

760
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:27,542
- Hi, this is Gypsy Blanchard.

761
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,042
- Umm...

762
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,583
- Umm, is...
- Ah, I...

763
00:34:41,292 --> 00:34:43,583
- Yes, that is correct.

764
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:48,292
I had pre-okayed that with
my parole officer way before

765
00:34:49,417 --> 00:34:52,875
and I haven't gotten
to give him a call yet

766
00:34:52,875 --> 00:34:56,458
because I got released at like
three o'clock in the morning.

767
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,250
So I was waiting
for a decent hour

768
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,083
and right now we're
headed to Kansas City.

769
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:02,375
- To meet her family,

770
00:35:02,375 --> 00:35:03,875
- To meet up with my family.

771
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,375
Like I discussed

772
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:08,958
with the IPO in Chillicothe
Correctional Center.

773
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:12,500
And so I was just getting ready
to call my PO so I can kind

774
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,083
of know what my
reporting directives are.

775
00:35:20,708 --> 00:35:22,167
- No they don't.

776
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:28,750
- Uh-huh.

777
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,375
- Drive.

778
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:38,250
- Our plan was we were gonna,

779
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,208
- Our plan was already set.

780
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,875
- Our plan was already set

781
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,833
to stay a few days
in Kansas City.

782
00:35:42,833 --> 00:35:43,667
- Yeah with our P.O.

783
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:44,792
- Shh!

784
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,708
And with my parole
officer's permission.

785
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:49,583
He said that that's fine.

786
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:53,333
And to report to him in
Louisiana after the holiday.

787
00:35:58,042 --> 00:35:59,500
- Yes.
- Yes, he does.

788
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:05,542
- On New Year's Day.
- The 1st.

789
00:36:10,542 --> 00:36:12,125
- Okay.

790
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,250
- Okay. That sounds
good. I will do that.

791
00:36:22,625 --> 00:36:24,208
- Okay, that sounds
good. I'm sorry

792
00:36:24,208 --> 00:36:26,292
for the miscommunication,
you know?

793
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,250
- Okay, thank you.

794
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:30,958
- [Officer] Okay,
thank you ma'am.

795
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:31,875
- [Gypsy] Okay, bye-bye.

796
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:32,833
- [Officer] Bye-bye.

797
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:33,958
[phone beeps]

798
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,042
- Jesus.
- [Ryan] They need to chill.

799
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:38,042
Like you need to go
to Louisiana now.

800
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,333
- I'm like, we've
already, clarified.

801
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,708
- No we've cleared
this [bleep] so...

802
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:45,708
[traffic whoosh]
[gentle music]

803
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:53,792
- Well ,I mean, what are your
thoughts on the Chief's game?

804
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:56,833
The media portraying it as
you know, she's going there

805
00:36:56,833 --> 00:36:58,458
to meet Taylor Swift.

806
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,125
- Right.

807
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,333
It could be bad.

808
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,083
- [Mia] I don't like it.

809
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,292
- [Rod] Considering her past

810
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:06,875
meeting all the celebrities

811
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:09,542
and using her illness to get
her to meet all these people.

812
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:10,958
- [Corrine] Right. That's what
her mom trained her to do.

813
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:13,708
- [Rod] After the murder,
they found a bunch of receipts

814
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,958
and stuff from
charitable foundations,

815
00:37:16,958 --> 00:37:18,875
from some country music singers,

816
00:37:18,875 --> 00:37:21,333
like some checks and things.

817
00:37:21,333 --> 00:37:23,625
That's resurfacing
some of that mentality.

818
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:24,667
- Exactly.

819
00:37:24,792 --> 00:37:26,417
- And something her mom
used to get her to those

820
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:28,042
celebrities, and now.

821
00:37:28,042 --> 00:37:29,250
- [Corrine] Right.

822
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,542
- I just don't wanna
see that fester in her.

823
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:32,375
- [Mia] I don't think it
was a smart idea at all.

824
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,667
But at the same time, I
feel like she's just ready

825
00:37:34,667 --> 00:37:37,208
to do whatever she wants to
do without anybody telling her

826
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:38,708
what she can and can't do.

827
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:42,833
And she wants to experience
and that's what she's doing.

828
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,542
And it's not like she's
gonna really listen to us.

829
00:37:44,542 --> 00:37:46,708
She's gonna do whatever
she wants regardless, but.

830
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:49,417
- [Mike] And then you've
got Ryan in the mix too.

831
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,333
So I mean we don't have just,

832
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,375
it's not just
talking to Gypsy now.

833
00:37:53,375 --> 00:37:55,833
You have to take
into account that

834
00:37:55,833 --> 00:38:00,708
she does have somebody there
also offering advice and.

835
00:38:00,708 --> 00:38:03,667
- Brings in another
element of navigating.

836
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:05,125
- Correct.

837
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:06,250
- We'll have to
stay tight with them

838
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,875
regarding everything
she's doing.

839
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:12,083
I know she's got a obviously
check in with a parole.

840
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:13,625
- [Mike] Correct.

841
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,375
When you're on parole, you
are still under the custody

842
00:38:16,375 --> 00:38:18,292
of the Department
of Corrections.

843
00:38:18,292 --> 00:38:21,042
And so you don't have
the same freedoms

844
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:23,625
that the average person does.

845
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:28,417
She is going home today,
but she is not free yet.

846
00:38:28,417 --> 00:38:31,250
[dramatic music]
[traffic humming]

847
00:38:33,583 --> 00:38:36,000
- [Ryan] Damn [bleep]
right there.

848
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,375
I could lose him right now.

849
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,792
- [Gypsy] You know, Dad
said just drive safe.

850
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,875
Don't get in a car crash
worrying about losing him.

851
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:46,042
- [Ryan] I know.

852
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:48,292
- That's stressing me out.

853
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,375
- What's stressing you out?

854
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:50,292
- Just drive safe please.

855
00:38:50,292 --> 00:38:51,375
- Okay baby I will.

856
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:52,542
- Thank you.

857
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,417
- I feel my heart
getting faster.

858
00:38:57,417 --> 00:38:59,542
Faster and faster.

859
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,792
If I wanna run about ten laps,

860
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,792
'cause I have all
this nervous energy.

861
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:08,375
I'm on two and a half
hours, three hours of sleep

862
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:11,417
and not too long
she's gonna be here.

863
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:13,042
My mind just keeps going.

864
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,292
[can pops open]

865
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:17,833
I still can't believe
that it's here.

866
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:23,375
- Look, he stopped
in the mid-traffic.

867
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:25,542
[bleep] [bleep]

868
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:29,708
- Be safe.

869
00:39:31,375 --> 00:39:34,333
- He's about to
see where we turn.

870
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,750
- [Mia] They're here.

871
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,458
- [Rod] Coming in hot.
He ain't lying.

872
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,333
[tense music]

to go directly to Louisiana

880

cleared this, like your P.O.

962

and like he knows that.

That's when our intake
is and he's like,

nope, I don't care.

in touch with her P.O.

So that's why we were
still in the car.

out what's going on.

- Yeah, what we need to do.

- We'll talk to somebody and.

- [Ryan] It was just crazy.

He said we got reports she's
going to a Chief Bengals game.

Y'all can't go to the
Chief Bengals game.

- Let me see what
I can find out.

979
00:43:59,292 --> 00:44:03,542
I think this is an example
of how things are going to be

980
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:05,292
for Gypsy herself.

981
00:44:05,292 --> 00:44:08,417
I don't think this is something
that would be an issue

982
00:44:08,417 --> 00:44:10,167
for anybody else.

983
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:14,875
Because of the media
frenzy, probation and parole

984
00:44:14,875 --> 00:44:16,375
wants her to get to Louisiana

985
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,958
wants her to get checked in

986
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:21,917
so that Louisiana can
take over supervision.

00:44:21,917 --> 00:44:24,542
If this were just
any other person,

988
00:44:24,542 --> 00:44:29,500
I don't think it would've even
registered on anyone's radar.

you wanna talk?

a few days in Kansas City

and drive back on the
first to Louisiana.

995

I don't wanna do anything
in violation of my parole.

I'm a very responsible woman
that just wants to do right.

1001

And what she's told and
whatever that means.

we'll let you know

really good P.O.

the situation

1008

and is willing to
work it out with you.

Yeah, worst case you'll have
to leave in the morning.

a great time today.

is Mike Stanfield

1030
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:36,208
and I was her attorney
during the case.

1031
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:38,542
We just spoke to her
Louisiana probation

1032
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:40,417
or parole officer on the phone.

1033
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:43,542
He has no problem with
her not being in Louisiana

1034
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,250
until after the
first of the year.

1035
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:59,000
- So the issue is, is
you just want her out

1036
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,542
of the state of Missouri.

1037
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:08,125
- Well, so they've been up
since one o'clock this morning.

1038
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:12,042
So her traveling from
Kansas City where she is

1039
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:15,292
to Louisiana tomorrow morning
would not be sufficient.

not, their office isn't

open until January 3rd.

1044
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,042
She couldn't report there,

1045
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:36,125
if she got to Louisiana
by 8:00 AM tomorrow,

1046
00:47:36,125 --> 00:47:37,583
she couldn't report tomorrow.

1047

- Okay.

1048
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,542
She literally has
already reported

1049
00:47:43,542 --> 00:47:44,875
to the Louisiana officer.

00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:48,625
I spoke to him personally
30 minutes ago.

1051
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:51,542
- [Gypsy] I just
need a minute, okay?

1052
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,500
[sobbing]

1053
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,375
- [Kristy] It's, baby.

1054
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:58,542
Listen. Listen to Mom.

1055
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,292
Listen. It's okay.

1056
00:48:00,292 --> 00:48:03,250
It's okay. You did
the hardest part.

1057
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,583
[Gypsy sobbing]

1058
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,375
- [Kristy] They're not
gonna send you back.

1059
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:09,583
[Gypsy sobbing]

1060
00:48:09,583 --> 00:48:12,042
- [Kristy] They not gonna
send you back Gyps.

1061
00:48:12,042 --> 00:48:13,292
- [Gypsy] [sobbing]
I'm so sorry.

1062
00:48:13,292 --> 00:48:16,458
- [Kristy] Don't
be sorry, please.

1063
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,083
- [Gypsy] I'm sorry.

1064
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,375
I feel like I've got
all these people.

1065
00:48:20,375 --> 00:48:24,208
- [Kristy] No, no listen.
These are your people.

1066
00:48:24,208 --> 00:48:28,250
There is nothing to be
sorry about. Not a thing.

1067
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:35,375
- [Gypsy] This was
supposed to be a good day

1068
00:48:35,375 --> 00:48:38,708
and I wanna have a good day
with everybody else too.

1069
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:43,625
But I also just want to do
what I'm supposed to on parole.

1070
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:50,208
I don't understand why
I have to be different.

1071
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:52,958
I don't understand what
makes me different.

1072
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:56,542
Because to me I'm just
another average bear.

1073
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:01,167
And I guess I'm getting
a huge culture shock.

1074
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:02,042
So.

1075
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:09,000
At the end of the day I will
still do whatever it takes

1076
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,458
to make me free.

1077
00:49:12,792 --> 00:49:14,708
I do not feel free right now.

1078
00:49:14,708 --> 00:49:16,292
I feel like I am

1079
00:49:16,292 --> 00:49:18,917
in a different form of prison.

1080
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,208
I had a nightmare about my mom.

1081
00:49:22,208 --> 00:49:24,542
It's not easy to live with.

1082
00:49:24,542 --> 00:49:27,500
- [Man] Gypsy can we
get a quick selfie?

1083
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,333
- [Ryan] Come here.

1084
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,708
- [Gypsy] I have my freedom now.

1085
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:30,583
[Gypsy laughs]

1086
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:31,542
Whoa!

1087
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:34,833
- I'm terrified.

1088
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:35,958
I don't know how to cook.

1089
00:49:35,958 --> 00:49:36,833
- That's so bad.

1090
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:37,875
- It's not bad.

1091
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,125
- It's so bad.

1092
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,542
- Hadn't had a sex
life to speak of.

1093
00:49:41,542 --> 00:49:43,000
We consummated our marriage.

1094
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,333
- Apparently the D is fire son.

1095
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:46,208
- Oh my God!

1096
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:48,250
- [Gypsy] I feel like everything
I do is on a microscope.

1097
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,792
Am I at risk for
dangerous people?

1098
00:49:50,792 --> 00:49:52,125
I've been getting death threats.

1099
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:55,042
My parole officer
received a complaint.

1100
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:57,875
My biggest fear is
going back to prison.

1101
00:49:57,875 --> 00:49:59,542
I don't wanna be the old Gypsy.

1102
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:00,583
[uplifting music]

1103
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:01,792
- What would you
change about your nose?

1104
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:02,750
- The bump.

1105
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,333
I am kind of rushing into things

1106
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,042
and wanting to do
everything all at once.

1107
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:07,458
- She's 30 years old.

1108
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:10,583
She's making 17, 18-year-old
person type decisions.

1109
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,042
- What?

1110
00:50:13,042 --> 00:50:14,292
- If something
happens with Gypsy

1111
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:16,208
and Ken, that's going
to be your fault.

1112
00:50:16,208 --> 00:50:18,042
- [Ryan] He's trying to
weasel his way back in

1113
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:19,917
because now Gypsy's
out of prison.

1114
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,750
- We had sex. It
wasn't protected.

1115
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:23,875
- Are you pregnant?

1116
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:24,667
- Who is that?

1117
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:25,458
Who are you texting?

1118
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:26,792
- You're mad at me

1119
00:50:26,792 --> 00:50:29,375
because I confided in someone.

1120
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,417
Are you happy?

1121
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:32,125
- [Ryan] I'm very
happy with you.

1122
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:34,042
- [Gypsy] I just think
I would be happier

1123
00:50:34,042 --> 00:50:35,792
somewhere else.

1124
00:50:35,792 --> 00:50:37,167
- Go call Ken.

1125
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,958
You're probably already
talking to him anyway.

1126
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,542
[tense music]

1127
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:44,208
- [Ken] I've never
been on camera before

1128
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,292
talking about
anything like this.

1129
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:49,458
- [Ryan] I need to have faith
that you always come back.

1130
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:51,042
- [Gypsy] I sent him
a text and I'm like,

1131
00:50:51,042 --> 00:50:52,000
I'm gonna want a divorce.

1132
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,000
- Hey you!

1133
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,375
[chuckles]
