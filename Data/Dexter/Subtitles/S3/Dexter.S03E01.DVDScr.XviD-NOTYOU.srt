1
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,947
Last season on Dexter

2
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,947
The butcher bodies was submerged inside these heavy duty garbage bags

3
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,278
Did you here that
30 bags! Do you know what that means?

4
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:07,082
There might be a new massmurderer out there way worse than the icetruck killer

5
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,843
8 confirmed victims of the bay harbour butcher

6
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:13,466
That's what the press is callling whoever dumped those bodies offshore

7
00:02:13,518 --> 00:02:15,970
Last thing Miami need is another serialkiller

8
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,660
Any idea who the FBI send in?

9
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:19,749
Some guy named Lundy

10
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:22,738
We have positive id's on all 18 of our complete bodies

11
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,432
All 13 was tried for murder or at least expected of murder

12
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,582
Bay harbour butcher give me one shot at putting a bullet in the fuckers head

13
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:33,022
- You realy feel that way?
- Yes that's the one thing to value a human life

14
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:35,962
Yeah but i think we had different homework assignments

15
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:39,582
Tell me the truth

16
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:41,363
are you an addict?

17
00:02:41,608 --> 00:02:42,991
Yes, I happen to be Christine

18
00:02:43,026 --> 00:02:45,282
- I'm Dexter
- Hi Dexter

19
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,161
There's my sponsor

20
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:51,212
So tell me exactly how full of shit are you

21
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:52,760
This woman see's me

22
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,163
Somehow she's able to make me feel ok about what I am

23
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:59,952
Yo're gonna tell me all your
deepest darkest secrets

24
00:02:59,988 --> 00:03:05,141
Laura Moser. My mother was murdered
I never told anyone that before

25
00:03:05,176 --> 00:03:09,080
Did you find out what happened to the men responsible for your mothers murder

26
00:03:09,128 --> 00:03:10,230
Santos Jiminez.

27
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,863
went into witness protection

28
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:13,870
Where are you?

29
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:16,403
I've decided to look up
someone from my past

30
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:18,290
1972 !

31
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:21,060
You slaughtered her
and she sold cocain

32
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:23,020
she was a snitch for a cop

33
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:24,483
she was fuckin him

34
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:28,510
It seemed my foster father and my biological mother where having an affair

35
00:03:28,558 --> 00:03:30,540
Did he blame himself for her death?

36
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:33,392
Is that why he took me in
or was he just using her

37
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:34,631
Was he using me?

38
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:37,982
There ain't no papertrail on the early years of Dexter Morgan

39
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,581
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fuckin Jimmy Hoffa

40
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,141
Back off

41
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:50,851
If Dexter files a complaint you will be took off the force

42
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:52,672
He's hiding something Maria I can feel it

43
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:54,630
I did some bloodslide analyses

44
00:03:54,676 --> 00:03:57,140
You will find out what you want what I realy am

45
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,842
- You don't understand
- Well then make me

46
00:04:05,898 --> 00:04:07,271
Who the fuck are you?

47
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:09,473
Pardon my tits

48
00:04:09,508 --> 00:04:12,121
How could you do this to Rita and not to mention her kids

49
00:04:12,837 --> 00:04:15,183
You and Lila stayed in a hotel together

50
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:16,712
It's over Dexter

51
00:04:18,318 --> 00:04:21,883
I'm sure you've heard we have a suspect in the Bay Harbout Butcher case

52
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,521
Sergeant James Dokes

53
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,752
He had the slides?

54
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,343
Carefully hidden in the trunk of his car at the airport

55
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:28,682
Jesus christ Morgan

56
00:04:28,725 --> 00:04:30,112
you're the Bay harbout butcher

57
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:32,262
You sure about that? You might want to check with Lundy

58
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,892
What's it gonna be Morgan? Kill me now or set me free

59
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,231
Don't worry i'll send the FBI your way soon enough

60
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:44,662
You're still gonna try to frame me

61
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,040
Mission accomplished

62
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:49,290
After tomorrow i'll be out of reach, permanently

63
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,721
You going somewhere?

64
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,840
Good bye Lila

65
00:04:52,408 --> 00:05:01,292
Hey who's out there anybody out there

66
00:05:01,297 --> 00:05:03,462
- What are you doing there
- His name is Dexter Morgan

67
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,461
I found out that he's the Bay harbour butcher

68
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:06,942
Please just open this gate

69
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:08,680
Oh hey your alive

70
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:09,972
Im ok

71
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:11,091
oh you

72
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,870
Dexter.

73
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:16,441
What the fuck are you doing

74
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:19,531
No turn that off you're insane

75
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:28,761
What where you thinking? are you insane!

76
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:31,223
I where just trying to bring us back together again

77
00:05:31,306 --> 00:05:33,760
The Lila experiment is officialy over

78
00:05:33,856 --> 00:05:35,810
Could have had it all Dexter

79
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,862
I've never been one to put much weight
in the idea of a higher power

80
00:05:51,008 --> 00:05:56,843
but if I didn't know better I have to believe that some
force out there wants me to keep doing what i'm doing

81
00:05:57,005 --> 00:06:00,713
You wanted to be close to me Lila?
This is the most I have to offer

82
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:02,901
You taught me to accept who I am

83
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:05,782
Thank you

84
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:08,091
The code is mine now

85
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,542
is mine alone

86
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:12,240
so too are the relations I cultivate

87
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:16,133
My father might not approve but i'm no longer his disciple

88
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,883
I'm a master now

89
00:06:20,507 --> 00:06:23,263
an idea transcended into life

90
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:29,903
Our father

91
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,751
Ah life

92
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:35,281
Life is ritual

93
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:37,063
routine

94
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:38,822
control

95
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:43,302
and an essential part of that routine

96
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:47,182
regular oral hygiene

97
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:51,470
well

98
00:06:51,637 --> 00:06:53,790
Few minutes that'll numb right up

99
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:55,970
So

100
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:58,063
how was your summer Dexter?

101
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:59,632
I went to the carnival

102
00:07:01,956 --> 00:07:03,631
I even won a prize

103
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,992
Hope you stay away from all the sweet stuff

104
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:10,721
Nah ususaly i'm..good but sometimes i indulge

105
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:16,633
I also made it a point to meet new people

106
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:20,381
Can never have to many friends

107
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:23,370
Now this temporary crown is gonna go way into the back

108
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:25,010
So there might be some blood

109
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,773
Not a problem

110
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:29,422
You still have your boat?

111
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,701
Oh you bet!

112
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,651
That's the only place I can realy let everything go

113
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:35,961
That's great

114
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:38,513
We're gonna have you up and
out on that water in no time

115
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:01,541
For someone that needs to spend
his life pretending to be normal

116
00:08:01,665 --> 00:08:09,732
I've been able to finaly settle in
to a nice, normal world

117
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:36,011
and Rita is the scafolding
that holds that world in place

118
00:08:36,276 --> 00:08:37,492
What are you thinking

119
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:42,310
Life is good

120
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,700
Here you go buddy

121
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,359
Ok Ashter you're up

122
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,378
Mickey mouse, unicorn or starfish?

123
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,282
Just plain round panncakes Dexter

124
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:00,791
She's growing up

125
00:09:01,806 --> 00:09:03,750
It starts with panncakes?

126
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,212
It starts when it starts

127
00:09:06,248 --> 00:09:07,810
Hey Dexter

128
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:12,242
uhm, can you come to dads day
at my school tomorrow

129
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:18,361
Just tell me what to do

130
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:31,720
Bye Charlotte

131
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:33,600
Bye Mom See you Dexter Bye Mom

132
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,993
Get your bag!

133
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:47,053
You hear that?

134
00:09:48,218 --> 00:09:49,421
Hear what

135
00:09:51,438 --> 00:09:52,730
The calm

136
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:57,781
everything is sowing into place
for the first time in my life

137
00:09:58,126 --> 00:09:59,822
I got these terrific kids

138
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,230
There's no longer any drama surrounding me

139
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,533
and I have this great

140
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:08,701
generous, gentle guy

141
00:10:14,636 --> 00:10:18,020
Most normal people enjoy
a sacred pact with society

142
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:20,970
Live a good life and
society will take care of you

143
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:22,802
but if society drops the ball then

144
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:25,592
someone else have to pickup the slack

145
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,632
That's where i come in

146
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:30,653
Fred Bowman a.ka Freebo

147
00:10:30,475 --> 00:10:33,512
kills two college girls in skates
on the state police screwup

148
00:10:33,627 --> 00:10:37,363
otherwise known as Floridas catch
and release program

149
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:41,971
he does the deed, gets away with murder
and falls of the radar

150
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:44,070
everyone's radar but mine

151
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:48,972
You got a birthday coming up dad

152
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:51,411
What to get the man who had everything

153
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,163
How about...

154
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:55,582
Freebo?

155
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:03,801
Morning Dex

156
00:11:03,976 --> 00:11:05,741
Dexter the doughnut guy

157
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:08,310
Part of my routine

158
00:11:08,428 --> 00:11:09,380
but let the record show

159
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:12,123
im not the only one with a daily ritual

160
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:14,993
Angel Baptista, bearclaw

161
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:18,890
Vince Masuka. Lemon custard

162
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,252
better than sex

163
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:26,272
actualy it's not

164
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:28,531
Hey I need a favour

165
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:29,621

167
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:32,730

Right. Yeah

169
00:11:34,298 --> 00:11:36,172
The editor was stoked that i was the LFI

170
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:37,150
lead forensic investigator

171
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:39,311
on the BHB
Bay harbour butcher

172
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:40,273
- Hey
- Hey

173
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:42,002
No biggie
i've been published before

174
00:11:42,258 --> 00:11:43,723
Penthouse doesn't count

175
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:45,583
Hey! That letter was famous!

176
00:11:45,847 --> 00:11:47,113
Death by pastry

177
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,053
You changed your hair

178
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,100
Makes you look younger

179
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:53,741
I don't want to look younger

180
00:11:55,366 --> 00:11:57,221
By the way nice job on the Renaldi case

181
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,440
Yeah, well...

182
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:00,702
murder/suicide pretty straight forward

183
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:03,901
Oh but still the report was spot on right

184
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:10,120
All right

185
00:12:11,026 --> 00:12:13,720
Quinn's been in homicide for two weeks and he noticed

186
00:12:14,235 --> 00:12:15,340
Noticed what?

187
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,581
My hair

188
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:21,352
I changed my hairstyle for the
first time since I was eight

189
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:25,873
Ahh short...er, shorter

190
00:12:26,985 --> 00:12:29,231
Quinn he is just showing off
his detective skills

191
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:31,002
Oh you think he thinks i'm a potential lay?

192
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:32,582
That is not happening

193
00:12:32,778 --> 00:12:34,673
and as long as you're not noticing things

194
00:12:34,185 --> 00:12:38,060
You also not noticed that i've given up men,
liquir and smokes for the last 27 days

195
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:42,811
this is you're remembering days birthday

196
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:45,082
Dad. Birthday. Right.

197
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:47,510
Blue room seven thirty like always

198
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:51,981
Tried calling you last night

199
00:12:52,135 --> 00:12:53,381
I.. wasn't home

200
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:55,901
I also tried your cellphone

201
00:12:58,247 --> 00:13:00,122
You're in the same pants that you
had on yesterday

202
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:02,560
and that's just a backup
when you keep a locker

203
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:05,602
I thought a part of your restructuring
of the department

204
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:08,270
was you staying out of our personal lifes

205
00:13:08,505 --> 00:13:10,472
Anything you want me to know?

206
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:13,591
Know this I went out and
had a great time last night

207
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:15,510
and you should be happy for me

208
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:16,870

209
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,793

210
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,430

00:13:34,428 --> 00:13:38,143

214
00:13:40,716 --> 00:13:45,740

dectective Sergeant Baptista

215
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,132

216
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:53,863

217
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:56,831

218
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:01,102

219
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,980

221
00:14:14,118 --> 00:14:15,193
Payraise?

222
00:14:15,986 --> 00:14:18,583
No dildo it means he's my supervisor

223
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:21,312
which means i have a lock for my detective shield.

224
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:24,480

Why?

276
00:18:01,757 --> 00:18:04,031
Well, he started drawing our attention

277
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,212
back when he was in narcotics

278
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:08,171
He's in your orbit now

279
00:18:08,307 --> 00:18:11,031
I don't know the guy except
he handles my paperwork

280
00:18:11,068 --> 00:18:13,823

00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:23,411
Yuki, that's not gonna happen

285
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:27,322
Cooperation with the IA has its upsides
in the department

286
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:28,932
Yeah maybe for Rosen

287
00:18:29,215 --> 00:18:30,160

292
00:18:41,268 --> 00:18:45,183
Uh-uh you don't get to blow me off
and still ask me questions

293
00:18:54,495 --> 00:18:55,751
Loud music

294
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,173
cover of darkness

295
00:19:00,308 --> 00:19:01,311
Perfect

296
00:19:36,406 --> 00:19:37,452

what the fuck happened back there

303
00:20:29,255 --> 00:20:32,433
I went there to kill Freebo
and ended up killing a total stranger

304
00:20:34,098 --> 00:20:36,673
I didn't kill someone I completely met before

305
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:39,690
Who's guilt I wasn't absolutely certain of.

306
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:42,332
I did something wholy inside the moment

307
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:44,731
and wholy outside the code

308
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:48,473
Something

309
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:50,852
spontaneous

310
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:53,391
Who did I just kill?

311
00:20:55,185 --> 00:20:56,602
Freebo's doorman

312
00:20:56,718 --> 00:20:57,512

A safe place

328

God created pudding

329
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:13,530
Pudding of chocolate

330
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:18,990

Huge?

351
00:24:09,738 --> 00:24:11,203
Who the hell are you?

352
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:13,323
I bet you wonder who the hell he is

353
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:17,820
Who he is, is what makes this case huge

354
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:18,803
It's Miguel Prado

355
00:24:18,828 --> 00:24:20,321
He's that ADA that's been on a mission

356
00:24:20,356 --> 00:24:23,113
to put away as many bad guys as he can you know

357
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:25,590
"a safe Miami is the only Miami"

358
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:29,153
A safe Miami and we're all unemployed

359
00:24:30,925 --> 00:24:32,663
Why does he look so familiar?

360
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,570
Cause he just made the
cover of Florida Magazine

361
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,473
Top prosecutor in the state

00:24:37,478 --> 00:24:38,593

He's a lieutenant with the
sheriffs department

367
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:51,642
Made himself quite the reputation for being a law and order hard ass

368
00:24:51,808 --> 00:24:52,751
and

369
00:24:53,756 --> 00:24:54,970

371
00:24:57,198 --> 00:24:59,303
as in baby brother

372
00:24:59,988 --> 00:25:02,710
So much for spontaneousity

373
00:25:02,858 --> 00:25:04,813
What was he doing in a dump like this?

374
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:07,631
They're saying that he was a coach at a youth club

375
00:25:08,008 --> 00:25:11,513
Came here to confront the scum bag
who was selling shit to his kids

376
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,613
Talk about the wrong place
at the wrong time

377
00:25:14,126 --> 00:25:15,522
Tell me about it

378
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:24,641
Find anything?

379
00:25:24,885 --> 00:25:26,083
Yeah...

380
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:30,032
dead guy with a hole in his chest

381
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:43,701
This window is cracked,
there's blood on the wall

382
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:44,840
Who shut these drapes?

383
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:46,453
Probably first on scene

384
00:25:46,488 --> 00:25:49,382
Some dipshit review? still outside puking

385
00:26:06,495 --> 00:26:07,873
So what do we got?

386
00:26:08,146 --> 00:26:12,141
Signs of a majorly big struggle here,
there, everywhere

387
00:26:12,186 --> 00:26:13,990
Single stabwound to the chest

388
00:26:14,028 --> 00:26:15,232
You read my article yet?

389
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:17,303
Started it So far it is realy good

390
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:18,151
Awesome

391
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,211
Whoever did this

392
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:41,592
He's already wishing he was dead

393
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:51,290
Someone realy stepped on his dick with this one

394
00:27:03,965 --> 00:27:07,520
There where so many lessions
in the wanted code of Harry

395
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:13,853
Twisted commandments handed down
from the only god I ever worshiped

396
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,120
One through ten

397
00:27:16,996 --> 00:27:18,840
Don't get caught.

398
00:27:20,826 --> 00:27:22,432
That I got covered

399
00:27:23,795 --> 00:27:26,611
But killing someone without knowing if he's guilty

400
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:31,632
I'd love some help on this one

401
00:27:32,715 --> 00:27:34,473
But my god is dead now

402
00:27:42,348 --> 00:27:43,591
Mans best friend

403
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:44,813
right Dex?

404
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,172
Not today

405
00:27:48,305 --> 00:27:52,071
Hey my sister says that LaGuerta
knows this Miguel Prado pretty well

406
00:27:52,227 --> 00:27:53,571
Way back when when we...

407
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:56,153
Hey wazzup?

408
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,881
Way back when when we Mighuel was in 
law school

409
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:02,062
and Maria was just starting in law enforcement

410
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:03,341
They hooked up

411
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,821
Hooked up?

412
00:28:05,027 --> 00:28:10,382
Between us for Maria Miguel Prado
will always be the one who got away

413
00:28:17,146 --> 00:28:18,871
Prelim has the victim

414
00:28:19,025 --> 00:28:22,110
Oscar Prado 26 dead

415
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:25,291
Dead from a single stabwound to the chest

416
00:28:25,645 --> 00:28:27,951
The deceast brother ADA Miguel Prado

417
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:30,730
informed the active scene that
Oscar went to confront one

418
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:33,921
Fred Bowman streetman Freebo

419
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:37,060
for selling drugs to some youth club kids

420
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:37,850
Morgan.

421
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:40,613
This Freebo is the same guy that killed those two co-ed's

422
00:28:40,626 --> 00:28:42,611
in the Everglides and got away with it so

423
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:45,122
the way it looks Oscar Prado died a hero

424
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:50,141
Also our team found a shitload of...
substantial amount of drugs in the house

425
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:51,870
Any leads on his whereabouts?

426
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:55,812
That part of the neighbourhood isn't exactly
policefriendly but i'm staying on it

427
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:57,227
Talk to me about forensics

428
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:02,405
Evidence indicates this was no hit and run

429
00:29:00,955 --> 00:29:03,180
It was a furious close end battle

430
00:29:03,347 --> 00:29:04,321
Whoever..

431
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:06,251
Was it whomever?

432
00:29:06,276 --> 00:29:06,976
Whoever's good

433
00:29:07,076 --> 00:29:11,942
Whoever did this got in a lucky shot
or was realy good at handling a blade

434
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:16,310
According to the ME the aorta was
cleanly severed in one penetration

435
00:29:16,945 --> 00:29:18,021
Not easy to do

436
00:29:18,237 --> 00:29:19,592
Any luck finding the weapon?

437
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:21,222
It's not on either premises

438
00:29:21,255 --> 00:29:24,171
We've checked roofs, sewers, trashbins
in a five blocks radius

439
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:27,312
Our conclusion the assailant took it with him.

440
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:29,383
Dexter what's the blood saying?

441
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,912
Pretty much what everyone else is

442
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:34,173
I have some second level on scene work to do

443
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:36,002
I get back to you ASAP

444
00:29:36,248 --> 00:29:37,883
Give it to sergeant Baptista

445
00:29:37,968 --> 00:29:38,961
Full disclosure

446
00:29:39,465 --> 00:29:43,043
I've had a personal relationship with
the Prado family for many years

447
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:47,011
and it goes alot further than the whole Cubano thing

448
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:49,730
Sergeant

449
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:52,461
Stating the obvious lieutenant

450
00:29:52,748 --> 00:29:54,302
I'd like Freebo for this

451
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:55,531
Me too

452
00:29:56,477 --> 00:29:57,393
Morgan.

453
00:29:57,846 --> 00:29:59,103
Yes mam

454
00:29:59,646 --> 00:30:02,851
Hit the streets harder
Learn what you can learn

455
00:30:03,757 --> 00:30:07,271
With all due respect lieutenant 
if Freebo did this

456
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:09,920
he's not in Miami
I mean he's in the winds

457
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:13,083
We could sit around on our asses
and speculate on wherever we think

458
00:30:13,317 --> 00:30:17,540
the prime suspect may or may
not be or we can actualy go and look for him

459
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:25,883
As a Miami prosecutor I have
dedicated my career to fighting crime

460
00:30:25,987 --> 00:30:29,541
To make our streets safe
for everyone

461
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:35,001
Every family white, black, latino, asian deserves

462
00:30:36,006 --> 00:30:41,080
the full measures of our devotion to their dignity

463
00:30:41,227 --> 00:30:47,652
another crime has touched my family in
the most profound way imaginable

464
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:51,163
I grieve equaly for every
family that has been

465
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:56,822
visited with the same unimaginable
news that we have received today

466
00:30:56,975 --> 00:30:59,881
Our beautiful city is a city of families

467
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:06,840
and the untimely taking of any of us touches all of us

468
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:10,823
My parents brought my brothers from....

469
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:15,131
Part of my ritual has always been
to get to know my victims

470
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:18,021
Confirming their guilt beyond all doubt.

471
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:23,422
Oscar Prado tried to kill Freebo
and he tried to kill me

472
00:31:23,597 --> 00:31:26,222
No way he was there
on some noble youth club mission

473
00:31:26,358 --> 00:31:28,503
He's got to be guilty of something

474
00:31:28,685 --> 00:31:30,480
Aren't we all?

475
00:31:30,498 --> 00:31:32,300
So I ask again

476
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:35,270
Who are you?

477
00:31:44,005 --> 00:31:46,991
Two speeding tickets and an illegal u-turn

478
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:52,662
What about outside the code of Harry

479
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:55,771
Harry finds me in a pool of blood

480
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:58,600
Turns me into his own personal vendeta machine

481
00:31:58,657 --> 00:32:04,173
and when he see's the monster he
created in action he kills himself

482
00:32:04,377 --> 00:32:06,691
Death can drink to his honor on his own

483
00:32:06,916 --> 00:32:09,222
Any luck in the land of reluctant witnesses

484
00:32:09,315 --> 00:32:11,063
One house I play good cop

485
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,770
the next i play bad cop

486
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,232
I still can't get shit from anybody in that neighbourhood

487
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:16,981
You know what the
problem is right?

488
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:18,901
Wait Quinn let me guess

489
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:20,192
The cop part?

490
00:32:20,457 --> 00:32:23,371
No they don't owe you anything There's no insentive

491
00:32:23,517 --> 00:32:26,393
which gives the balance of power
weighing in their direction, right

492
00:32:27,957 --> 00:32:31,772
Her let me give you one thing,
call this guy,

493
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:37,190
tell him you know me. Tell him you want to
cash in one of my coupons.

494
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:38,252
Coupons ?

495
00:32:38,516 --> 00:32:41,311
Yeah he's a CI from my days in narcotics.

496
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,520
He got a hook in him and it's not
coming out aanytime soon.

497
00:32:45,346 --> 00:32:47,003
What you want in return?

498
00:32:47,176 --> 00:32:49,132
For you to remember that i did you a solid

499
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:52,820
Not even a thank you?

500
00:32:52,978 --> 00:32:54,082
Thank you

501
00:32:54,535 --> 00:32:56,862
Stop looking at my ass

502
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:14,022
Detective.

503
00:33:14,917 --> 00:33:16,740
Officer. Your Anton?

504
00:33:17,527 --> 00:33:21,251
In the flesh
You got something you want to show me?

505
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:26,680
Oh yeah I've seen him before

506
00:33:27,267 --> 00:33:28,470
Realy? Where?

507
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,871
In the news

508
00:33:30,088 --> 00:33:32,522
Isn't that the guy you let walk with those co-ed killers.

509
00:33:32,758 --> 00:33:35,533
Now that there was some
fine piece of police work

510
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:39,160
You know him from the news paper

511
00:33:39,187 --> 00:33:41,712
Yeah i think i saw him on CNN or something

512
00:33:41,747 --> 00:33:43,100
Ok that's all you got?

513
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:44,750
Thats all you got

514
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:49,261
You know if you and Quinn's fucking with me
Im realy not in the mood

515
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:52,121
You know summer if you need something
for that temper I got a man down the street

516
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,942
that sells realy ?mellow weak?
to take that edge right off.

517
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:57,492
Well thank you but i don't take advice
from drugdealers so..

518
00:33:57,527 --> 00:33:58,581
Drugdealers?!

519
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:03,183
Oh never that.
Drug user, occationaly

520
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,392
Strictly weed though officer,
strictly weed

521
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,891
Then how did you become Quinns snitch

522
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:09,712
I got caught up in a drugbust

523
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:12,272
Quinn told me if I blew the whistle on the bigger fish

524
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,673
I would stay out of jail
so i listened

525
00:34:14,997 --> 00:34:16,471
attentively

526
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:19,601
Yeah well...

527
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:21,670
you know it never hurts
for an occational drug user

528
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:23,220
to have another friend
on the force

529
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:25,020
That's the thing officer

530
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:26,981
I got enough friends

531
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:29,213
Yeah well im out of here

532
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:31,073
Yeah you have a good one you hear

533
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:42,033
What about this Prado guy?

534
00:34:43,385 --> 00:34:49,142
..and to determine the impact site.
The exact point where forces carry the body

535
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:52,410
You have to distinguish the geometric differences

536
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:55,833
between backspatter, satelite spatter,

537
00:34:56,148 --> 00:34:58,633
misting and arterial spurting

538
00:34:58,868 --> 00:35:00,711
- Groose!
- Shut up!

539
00:35:01,038 --> 00:35:05,910
Ehm, you remember how before when
Caties dad was talking about being a surgent

540
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:07,301
Yeah

541
00:35:07,426 --> 00:35:11,562
and sometimes how he has to cut into
bodies and there's blood

542
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:13,543
But he saves lives

543
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,052
Do you save lives?

544
00:35:19,277 --> 00:35:21,790
Ok you know how there's good guys and there's bad guys?

545
00:35:21,937 --> 00:35:23,670
So you catch bad guys?

546
00:35:23,968 --> 00:35:26,281
Well not directly but I help

547
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:28,063
Do you have a uniform?

548
00:35:29,395 --> 00:35:30,613
Eh, lab coat

549
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:32,210
A gun?

550
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:33,773
No

551
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,451
He got a badge.

552
00:35:36,397 --> 00:35:37,751
A laminate

553
00:35:38,398 --> 00:35:42,673
Well thank you so much for taking
time from your busy schedule Mr.Morgan

554
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:44,483
to come and talk to the children

555
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:47,000
Yeah it was a real learning experience

556
00:35:53,625 --> 00:35:55,610
Looks like I realy got through to em huh

557
00:35:55,976 --> 00:35:59,262
It would have sucked even worse today
if I didn't have a dad today

558
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:02,940
Thanks for inviting me buddy

559
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:13,610
If anyone should have father issues,

560
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:17,113
anger, rejection, abandonment it's Cody

561
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:20,312
and what does he do? He moves on.

562
00:36:23,718 --> 00:36:25,802
How does that happen?

563
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,070
I was so bad you're crying?

564
00:36:34,258 --> 00:36:38,991
No, no it's just something I always wanted

565
00:36:38,965 --> 00:36:39,202


566
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:41,200
You being here for the kids

567
00:36:41,687 --> 00:36:44,902
It felt so wonderfully uncomplicated

568
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:53,663
Hello?

569
00:36:54,197 --> 00:36:59,532
Mr.Morgan this is Miguel Prado
I need to see you Right away

570
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:07,690
So much for uncomplicated

571
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:29,690
It almost looks like a piece of art

572
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:32,471
Thank you sir

573
00:37:32,696 --> 00:37:34,931
but to me it's more like a story

574
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:39,492
Tell me that story Mr.Morgan

575
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:50,023
The encounter started over here
The scuff-marks on the linoleum,

576
00:37:50,455 --> 00:37:52,621
the crumpling, the thrower-up, they all

577
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:55,543
have the directional followty that leads to..

578
00:37:55,696 --> 00:38:02,652
Now this is where your brother and Freebo
he's my lieutenants prime suspect

579
00:38:04,835 --> 00:38:06,903
But you know that

580
00:38:07,947 --> 00:38:10,500
There was a brutal struggle

581
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:15,842
I got to say it looks like your brother fought like a hero

582
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:22,821
but he was overmatched and sustained
a fatal stabwound to the chest

583
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:28,250
Everything about the blood
suggests that your brother

584
00:38:28,365 --> 00:38:30,721
bleed out almost instantly.

585
00:38:31,186 --> 00:38:32,861
Did he suffer?

586
00:38:33,246 --> 00:38:35,150
Blood never lies

587
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:43,243
So now i know how he died
Question is why

588
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:46,092
Well one more thing Mr.Morgan

589
00:38:47,555 --> 00:38:50,542
Why would a blood spatter analyst

590
00:38:50,808 --> 00:38:53,751
spend time searching the sheriff departments database

591
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:57,372
for information on my dead brother

592
00:38:58,756 --> 00:38:59,661
Uhm...

593
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,523
Like you sir I wanted to understand what happened here

594
00:39:07,696 --> 00:39:09,271
I felt that

595
00:39:10,168 --> 00:39:15,732
knowing some details about your
brothers life help me make sense out of his death

596
00:39:15,908 --> 00:39:21,420
In your line of work Mr.Morgan is it usual
for you to get so involved?

597
00:39:25,785 --> 00:39:29,743
I just sounded like a prosecutor there, i'm sorry

598
00:39:30,387 --> 00:39:31,370
It's not a problem sir

599
00:39:31,418 --> 00:39:34,392
and no it's not usual for me to get so involved

600
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:38,391
but this one, this death got to me

601
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:43,491
It's just..

602
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,471
it seem so unreal..

603
00:39:48,357 --> 00:39:49,801
he's gone

604
00:39:50,665 --> 00:39:52,163
Yeah I know

605
00:39:54,527 --> 00:39:58,803
So a man died Mr.Morgan and what's left a soul?

606
00:39:58,945 --> 00:39:59,940
And what is that exactly?

608
00:40:02,865 --> 00:40:04,381
I realy couldn't tell you

609
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:06,912
Because some people say
the soul lives on forever

610
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:11,501
I don't know

611
00:40:11,666 --> 00:40:14,002
Which makes you a synic

612
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:16,742
It makes me a scientist

613
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:23,722
So noone you ever loved has died?

614
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:29,031
My father died when I was in my twenties

615
00:40:31,308 --> 00:40:39,081
and you don't believe that his soul,
call it his lifeforce is still here somehow

616
00:40:39,248 --> 00:40:41,361
living inside you?

617
00:40:44,577 --> 00:40:50,563
Because I... I should have been there for him

618
00:40:51,387 --> 00:40:53,182
You can't blame yourself sir.

619
00:40:53,346 --> 00:40:55,752
It's easier said than done Mr.Morgan

620
00:41:02,275 --> 00:41:03,652
Do me a favour

621
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:06,962
You realy want to get to know
my brother like you say

622
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:08,420
Come to his wake tonight

623
00:41:08,545 --> 00:41:13,721
Come see how much and how,
how fully he was loved.

624
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,043
Ok

625
00:41:16,868 --> 00:41:22,651
Taken enough of your day here, 
thank you.. Dexter

626
00:41:33,027 --> 00:41:34,160
This reports final?

627
00:41:34,477 --> 00:41:37,933
Blood specimen's I collected all came back
belonging to Oscar Prado

628
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:40,960
Trace prints on and around the victim
all points to Freebo

629
00:41:41,656 --> 00:41:42,913
Anyone out there talking?

630
00:41:43,116 --> 00:41:46,482
Officer Morgan was hitting up the usual
firewall of clammed up witnesses

631
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:50,281
and eyewitnesses so I put her in touch with
an old CI of mine

632
00:41:50,507 --> 00:41:51,513
hopefully she...

633
00:41:51,716 --> 00:41:55,151
Hey Quinn that CI you put me on
was totaly useless for Freebo

634
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:57,542
Sadly it's not a perfect world

635
00:41:57,575 --> 00:42:00,440
Yeah for all we know Freebo
is in like Nebraska by now

636
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:03,543
Well I guess you don't owe me
that favour then

637
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:04,450
How come he gets favours?

638
00:42:04,487 --> 00:42:05,791
He doesn't

639
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:07,832
But what the CI told me about the victims

640
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:11,653
He wasn't some hero coach that
went into the hood and took one for the team

641
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:12,863
What do you mean?

642
00:42:13,086 --> 00:42:16,430
Oscar Prado was into Freebo
for some serious cash

643
00:42:16,586 --> 00:42:19,941
Now why would someone be into
i don't know a drugdealer for big bucks.

644
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:22,500
Because Oscar Prado
the pride of little Havannah

645
00:42:22,718 --> 00:42:24,672
was a fucking junkie.

646
00:42:29,438 --> 00:42:30,551
Thanks Maria

647
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:35,761
Good one Morgan

648
00:42:53,347 --> 00:42:54,961
She's been in better moods

649
00:42:56,428 --> 00:42:58,371
Yeah I didn't exactly brighten her day

650
00:42:58,417 --> 00:42:59,841
No you didn't

651
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:01,781
Excuse me for doing my fucking job!

652
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,832
You see any other supercops coming
down here with any leads?

653
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:08,833
No Deb you're definitly amazing but you gotta

654
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,663
I know i know i know

655
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:14,520
Be aware of my surroundings
take the temperature of the room before I open my mouth

656
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,912
I know it's a bad habit I admit it

657
00:43:17,007 --> 00:43:19,150
Well look on the bright side
now that you've given up men, boose

658
00:43:19,212 --> 00:43:23,712
and cigarettes running your mouth
is the only bad habbit you have left

659
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,250
That's right

660
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:26,712
I'm a model of fucking perfection

661
00:43:29,578 --> 00:43:31,983
You know what day it is today right?

662
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:33,883
How could I forget?

663
00:43:34,398 --> 00:43:37,212
7.30 I buy your first drink

664
00:43:43,558 --> 00:43:44,512
You wanted to see me? Hey Baptista

665
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,520
I need you to think about Debbie Morgans continued

666
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:54,042
involvement on the Oscar Prado case

667
00:43:56,687 --> 00:43:58,083
You want me to throw her
under the bus

668
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:00,131
for what being a little overzealous

669
00:44:00,168 --> 00:44:01,283
It's not about heal

670
00:44:01,368 --> 00:44:03,350
It's about tact and sensitivities

671
00:44:03,747 --> 00:44:05,152
It's also about the real world

672
00:44:05,346 --> 00:44:06,871
This case is as high profile as it gets.

673
00:44:06,965 --> 00:44:11,510
I... No Morgan is resourceful, intanatious

674
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:13,942
and usualy the right amount 
of pain in the ass

675
00:44:14,087 --> 00:44:16,421
But there's political ramifications

676
00:44:16,658 --> 00:44:18,562
and my history with Miguel Prado aside

677
00:44:18,577 --> 00:44:20,573
this case is just too big for her

678
00:44:21,766 --> 00:44:24,060
Just say the word Maria
and I will follow your orders

679
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:28,293
Becoming a homicide sergeant is more
than just a bump in payscale

680
00:44:28,425 --> 00:44:30,540
it's a quantum leap in responsibility

681
00:44:30,696 --> 00:44:33,192
All part of moving up the chain

682
00:44:34,096 --> 00:44:37,002
If i'll bounce her she'll hate me

683
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,930
Your her boss ? not her friend

684
00:44:42,237 --> 00:44:43,463
It's up to you

685
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:31,211
Can I get another cranberry juice

686
00:45:31,248 --> 00:45:33,241
That makes three problems down under

687
00:45:33,777 --> 00:45:35,951
Geez I like the fucking taste ok

688
00:45:42,526 --> 00:45:43,871
Miss you dad

689
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:54,770
My condolences

690
00:45:54,937 --> 00:45:56,113
Thank you for coming

691
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,310
Losing my brother it's gonna
leave a pain in my heart

692
00:46:01,505 --> 00:46:03,911
that I don't think ever gonna heal

693
00:46:06,368 --> 00:46:08,263
You have a brother Dexter?

694
00:46:18,458 --> 00:46:21,640
No just a one loud sister

695
00:46:21,766 --> 00:46:23,530
What she said back at the station

696
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:27,983
It's ok I know my brother was a good man

697
00:46:28,906 --> 00:46:32,573
but i can tell that he suffered
from the tragedy of perfection

698
00:46:35,056 --> 00:46:36,680
Who doesn't

699
00:46:37,998 --> 00:46:39,581
Oh indeed...

700
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:55,691
You attacked me with a knife
in a dopedealers house.

701
00:46:55,876 --> 00:47:00,062
No Oscar you certainly didn't suffer
from the tragedy of perfection

702
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:03,521
Then why do this feel so wrong?

703
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:07,731
Why in your death are you still
so alive in my life

704
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:12,021
Did you know him well?

705
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:15,311
Not as well as I thought

706
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:17,973
Sorry

707
00:47:58,388 --> 00:47:59,511
Cuervo black

708
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:04,922
Thanks

709
00:48:11,276 --> 00:48:12,392
Harry

710
00:48:22,037 --> 00:48:23,590
What the hell is that?

711
00:48:24,015 --> 00:48:26,152
Cranberry Juice is that
gonna be a problem?

712
00:48:26,377 --> 00:48:30,501
Not even close to a problem
but the taste is kinda funky

713
00:48:37,366 --> 00:48:40,822
You know by the time my dad was my age
he already had his shield

714
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:44,890
Kinda why i'm here

715
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,601
I'm taking you off
the Oscar Prado case

716
00:48:58,266 --> 00:49:00,893
I come up with grade a intel on Oscar Prado

717
00:49:01,135 --> 00:49:04,420
and I get tossed of the case
for being a little loud?

718
00:49:04,578 --> 00:49:06,391
In a nutshell

719
00:49:07,376 --> 00:49:08,963
Did Maria put you up to this?

720
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,123
It was my decision

721
00:49:19,758 --> 00:49:21,431
I'll tell you one thing Angel

722
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:26,470
I'm not letting anyone getting in the way
of me getting my shield

723
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:30,730
There's only one person in this apartment
that can get in your way

724
00:49:30,988 --> 00:49:31,802
Who?

725
00:49:32,166 --> 00:49:33,360
You

726
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:46,122
Can I get a real fucking drink please?

727
00:49:54,105 --> 00:49:57,602
My sister still lives her life
trying to please her father

728
00:50:01,828 --> 00:50:02,980
