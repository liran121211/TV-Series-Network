1
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,878
Previously, on Dexter...

2
00:01:48,913 --> 00:01:51,047
We need to go after the root cause,

3
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,149
this bloodsucking, 
soulless defense attorney

4
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:54,317
Ellen Wolf.

5
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,553
Has she ever actually killed anyone?

6
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:57,754
Keep an open mind about her.

7
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:59,889
Miguel's on his way over here right now.

8
00:01:59,924 --> 00:02:03,193
I know one side of him. 
Maybe there's more.

9
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,627
Missing evidence,

10
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:06,896
Witness intimidation, 
jury tampering.

11
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:09,666
- You got proof? 
- He's a bad guy. He's not a stupid guy.

12
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,700
I'm pregnant.

13
00:02:10,734 --> 00:02:12,635
They say this part should pass soon.

14
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:17,073
This isn't some kind of 
weird end run, is it?

15
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,975
Make me see how 
sensitive you really are?

16
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,810
I'm not all that sensitive. 
- Yeah, you are.

17
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:24,047
Someone loaned freebo some money

18
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:25,849
and is willing to skin 
people to get it back.

19
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:26,916
Which is why I want to use

20
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:28,351
our C.I. more aggressively.

21
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:29,419
Wait. You mean Anton?

22
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:30,787
Yeah, we're gonna spread the word

23
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,455
that Anton knows where Freebo is.

24
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,756
You're gonna use him as bait?

25
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,091
Which means that the skinner

26
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:36,359
will be looking for me.

27
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:37,594
Am I being set up?

28
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:40,463
I found the fucking lead on the skinner case.

29
00:02:40,498 --> 00:02:41,531
The skinner is using

30
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,867
tree-trimming as a 
cover for surveillance.

31
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,001
He watches from the trees,

32
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:46,703
and when the time is right, 
he grabs them.

33
00:02:46,737 --> 00:02:48,071
I know what you did for me.

34
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:50,907
I will be your bait.

35
00:02:52,143 --> 00:02:54,444
So you told Quinn I 
was investigating him.

36
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:55,578
Hey, you're the one who fucked him.

37
00:02:55,613 --> 00:02:57,147
Not my fault he didn't want an encore.

38
00:02:57,181 --> 00:03:00,183
Cop's dead 'cause Quinn 
cut all the wrong corners.

39
00:03:00,217 --> 00:03:01,184
Next dead cop's on you.

40
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,788
What did it feel like to end his life?

41
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:06,389
Felt like justice.

42
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:07,891
We're like-minded.

43
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:09,626
Together we can make a difference.

44
00:03:23,407 --> 00:03:26,042
It's said that everything is 
connected to everything.

45
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,379
The butterfly effect.

46
00:03:29,446 --> 00:03:31,414
You drop a pebble into a pond,

47
00:03:31,448 --> 00:03:33,082
and the ripples radiate outwards,

48
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,486
touching and affecting everything.

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,755
Until finally a fish 
grows arms and legs

50
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:42,192
and crawls out of the water.

51
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:45,261
And picks up a rock and smashes 
the next two fish over the head.

52
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:48,364
And we have the first serial killer.

53
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:52,869
This is good pizza.

54
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:54,671
On television.

55
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:56,439
What channel's ESPN over here?

56
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,810
I think it's a big number.

57
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:05,782
Yeah, there you go.

58
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,350
And now we got Gary 
going the other way.

59
00:04:07,384 --> 00:04:08,351
Tryin' to get in.

60
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:12,155
No way. that's not a foul, man.

61
00:04:12,189 --> 00:04:16,726
That was definitely 
wrong what that guy did.

62
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:18,228
You're clearly not a 
sports fan, are you?

63
00:04:19,997 --> 00:04:21,397
Not really.

64
00:04:21,432 --> 00:04:23,600
I'm more of a 
National Geographic kind of guy.

65
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:26,102
Sharks, bears, the occasionally penguin.

66
00:04:26,137 --> 00:04:27,670
You do have other interests, though.

67
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:30,240
Yeah, I suppose I do.

68
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:34,344
Speaking of which...

69
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:39,516
Uh, boundaries.

70
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,720
Eh, it's encrypted.

71
00:04:43,754 --> 00:04:45,421
Oh, yeah, that's right. 
Trust issues.

72
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,031
Football.

73
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:57,133
See. you do know your sports.

74
00:04:57,168 --> 00:05:01,004
This guy right here.

75
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:03,106
Billy Fleeter.

76
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,941
Should I know him?

77
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:06,543
Not yet, but hopefully, you will.

78
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:09,746
This was from maybe five years ago.

79
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
He never went pro.

80
00:05:10,815 --> 00:05:12,448
Drug problem. turned to gambling.

81
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:14,818
Unfortunately, he wasn't very good at it.

82
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:16,219
More than once he's paid his debts off

83
00:05:16,287 --> 00:05:18,721
to his bookies by working as an enforcer.

84
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:19,656
Breaking fingers?

85
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,492
Crushing skulls with a baseball bat.

86
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:23,860
I went after him

87
00:05:23,894 --> 00:05:25,962
a few years ago, but...

88
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:27,997
I just couldn't get the evidence.

89
00:05:28,032 --> 00:05:30,500
I had to tell the children of 
a 70-year-old man

90
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,569
that he had just killed

91
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:33,937
that there was nothing we could do.

92
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:36,473
So here it comes.

93
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:38,174
Miguel wants me to kill him.

94
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,742
I don't want you to kill him.

95
00:05:39,777 --> 00:05:40,844
No?

96
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:43,780
I wanna do it.

97
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,584
You.

98
00:05:47,618 --> 00:05:49,452
I've let you do all of the 
heavy lifting so far.

99
00:05:49,487 --> 00:05:52,155
Now it's my turn.

100
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:53,623
I'm ready to get my hands dirty.

101
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:03,900
It's one thing to let Miguel 
provide a little backup,

102
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:06,002
another thing to share 
the reins with him.

103
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:08,738
I'm gonna need your help, Dexter.

104
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:11,374
Not a good idea.

105
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:16,946
Just, uh, think about it.

106
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:18,948
No, Dexter,

107
00:06:18,983 --> 00:06:20,683
don't think about it.

108
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:25,655
The waffle is a lot like the pancake,

109
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:26,689
only square.

110
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:28,758
Why is it square?

111
00:06:28,793 --> 00:06:31,594
Because it was invented
by Simon P. Waffle,

112
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:34,297
and he liked to stack 
his waffles in boxes,

113
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:36,399
And that's just easier to do 
if they're square.

114
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,401
You're making that up.

115
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:42,038
I'm hurt that you would even think that.

116
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,174
Oh, God, Dexter, 
you're making a mess.

117
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,375
That's okay. 
We'll clean it up.

118
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,810
It's not the point.

119
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:49,045
What is the point?

120
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,146
I don't know.

121
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,948
The point is not to 
make a mess to begin with.

122
00:06:53,584 --> 00:06:54,851
Rita's pregnancy hormones seem to be

123
00:06:54,885 --> 00:06:56,486
ganging up on us this morning.

124
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,456
How come there are no 
English muffins left?

125
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,507
Uh, I think you ate the 
last one yesterday.

126
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:01,524
Waffle?

127
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:03,493
Uh, that's disgusting.

128
00:07:03,527 --> 00:07:05,028
Cody, you need a haircut.

129
00:07:05,062 --> 00:07:07,597
Let's see... 
four, five, six more months

130
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:08,731
till she delivers.

131
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:09,666
Rita, are you okay?

132
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,101
No, I'm not okay.

133
00:07:12,136 --> 00:07:13,203
Right, I am starting a new job

134
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:14,838
and I'm planning a 
wedding all by myself.

135
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:16,206
What can I do to help?

136
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,175
It's not like you can 
pick out the deejay.

137
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,643
Last time I got into your car,

138
00:07:20,711 --> 00:07:22,045
Your radio was tuned to marching music.

139
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:23,780
It helps me think.

140
00:07:23,814 --> 00:07:25,448
And it's not like 
you can pick the florist

141
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:26,783
or the caterer or even
the wedding bands.

142
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,151
I could pick the wedding bands.

143
00:07:28,185 --> 00:07:29,352
Right.

144
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:31,454
Just like the engagement 
ring you never gave me.

145
00:07:31,489 --> 00:07:32,689
You said you didn't want one.

146
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:33,890
I don't want one.

147
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:38,294
Who drank all the orange juice?

148
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:48,571
Jesus Christ. 
- What?

149
00:07:48,606 --> 00:07:51,141
You have like no hot 
water in your shower.

150
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,643
All right.

151
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:54,978
Yeah, I told you to wait, remember?

152
00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:58,148
Well, I can't wait. 
Some of us have jobs to get to.

153
00:07:58,182 --> 00:07:59,315
I'm a musician. 
I work nights.

154
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:01,584
Yeah, and what do you do 
with the rest of your day?

155
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:05,188
You take a nap, 
you watch cartoons.

156
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:06,422
Jack off.

157
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,390
Oh, I rarely watch cartoons.

158
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:09,726
Fucking hilarious.

159
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:17,667
Well, you better not be 
writing any more songs about me.

160
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:19,202
Most ladies would be flattered.

161
00:08:19,236 --> 00:08:21,938
Well, most ladies aren't cops.

162
00:08:22,006 --> 00:08:23,873
Oh, right.

163
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:24,974
Right.

164
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:46,362
I gotta go.

165
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:48,998
You okay?

166
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:52,602
Come get these.

167
00:08:52,636 --> 00:08:54,938
Yeah.

168
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:02,745
Freebo's dead.

169
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,582
And now there's a 
tree trimmers' convention in here.

170
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:08,084
It seems random, but it's not.

171
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:10,787
The butterfly effect again.

172
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:12,555
Of course, it's an odd sensation

173
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,691
when you happen to be the butterfly.

174
00:09:14,725 --> 00:09:16,893
And if I were to help 
Miguel kill Billy Fleeter

175
00:09:16,927 --> 00:09:20,430
who knows the effect 
that would have on the world?

176
00:09:20,498 --> 00:09:21,431
Is this the beginning

177
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:23,666
of a whole new level of friendship?

178
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,935
Is it the end of life as I know it?

179
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:29,706
Mr. King,

180
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,875
we met at the scene of our 
second victim, is that correct?

181
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,309
Yes, that is correct.

182
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:34,911
Great. Have you ever worked at 
any of these addresses?

183
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,816
No, no, see, these are city jobs.

184
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,384
I'm a private contractor.

185
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:44,287
Okay, well, I'm gonna need a 
list of all of your employees.

186
00:09:44,321 --> 00:09:46,956
I can get you a copy of my payroll records.

187
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:48,291
That would be a big help.

188
00:09:48,325 --> 00:09:49,492
How soon do you need this?

189
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,195
Ten minutes ago would be great.

190
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:53,696
Very well. 
Thank you.

191
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:10,446
Looks like someone got lucky last night.

192
00:10:10,481 --> 00:10:13,183
Uh, let's just say

193
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,285
that Barbara and I have 
taken it to the next level.

194
00:10:15,352 --> 00:10:17,053
You know that now you've done the deed,

195
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:18,154
she's gonna be taking notes,

196
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:19,956
making a checklist of your every move,

197
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,724
to see if you're 
relationship material, right?

198
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,760
That's not true. 
Wait, is it?

199
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:27,063
Well, it's not like 
we write anything down.

200
00:10:27,097 --> 00:10:30,200
It's...more of a mental process.

201
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,237
Morning, Loo.

202
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:36,539
Third day in a row of this, huh?

203
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:39,843
Let's hope something shakes 
loose on this. Come here.

204
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,311
Uh, I have a favor to ask you.

205
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:42,912
Shoot.

206
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:44,781
You know I got to go to 
that peace officers...

207
00:10:44,815 --> 00:10:46,549
...association thing tomorrow night.

208
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:49,519
You wanna-- you wanna be my date?

209
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:52,622
Maria, um,

210
00:10:52,656 --> 00:10:54,591
thank you for the invite.

211
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,992
But I have plans.

212
00:10:56,026 --> 00:10:57,894
And if I bail, I don't think 
it's gonna go over too well.

213
00:10:57,928 --> 00:11:02,132
Like that. Huh.

214
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:04,868
Okay. Good for you. Okay.

215
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:12,275
Relationships are complicated.

216
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:15,278
Letting Miguel kill 
Fleeter would be a gamble.

217
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:18,348
This guy's a gambler. 
Look where it got him.

218
00:11:18,382 --> 00:11:19,883
Something to consider 
when Miguel and I do

219
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,484
our research tonight at the casino.

220
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:34,164
How'd you find out about this place?

221
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:36,299
Research.

222
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:39,936
Always a first good step, right?

223
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,805
Move a little closer?

224
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,506
Tonight is just about watching, 
learning his routine--

225
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,408
where does he go,

226
00:11:45,442 --> 00:11:47,544
when does he go, 
what does he do when he gets there.

227
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:49,746
Okay. 
Later, we'll meet him.

228
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:51,414
We?

229
00:11:51,448 --> 00:11:54,551
Yeah, we'll see how it goes.

230
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:56,820
Right now, 
we don't want him to notice us.

231
00:11:56,854 --> 00:11:58,521
We don't want anyone to notice us.

232
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:01,458
Cameras all over the place.

233
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:05,061
Number one rule of the code is 
"Don't get caught."

234
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,563
Code? What code?

235
00:12:06,597 --> 00:12:10,333
How much do I tell him?

236
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,669
It's just a series of precautions.

237
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:13,937
Learned where?

238
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,941
Common sense mostly.

239
00:12:17,975 --> 00:12:19,409
A little more than that.

240
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:20,610
Well, my dad was a cop.

241
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:22,145
Right, right.

242
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,414
So he taught you... 
- What cops look for in an investigation.

243
00:12:24,448 --> 00:12:26,783
Oh, and so you work it 
backwards from there, right?

244
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:29,052
Plus, I spend all day looking 
at other people's mistakes.

245
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:31,187
You pick things up.

246
00:12:31,222 --> 00:12:32,388
I'm sure.

247
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,226
Am I forgetting something, Dexter?

248
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,229
Was there one final lesson where I said, 
"Go now,

249
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:42,565
far and wide, 
and preach the code, my son"?

250
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,700
I don't think so.

251
00:12:46,871 --> 00:12:48,505
So when you popped Anton 
for drug possession,

252
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,640
was it just pot, or was it coke or--

253
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:51,608
What was it?

254
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:53,943
Uh, pot, I think.

255
00:12:53,978 --> 00:12:55,512
Right. right, it couldn't have been

256
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:56,746
anything too serious,

257
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,914
Or you wouldn't have made him a C.I.

258
00:12:57,948 --> 00:12:59,249
I guess.

259
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:00,817
You're just full of answers today.

260
00:13:00,851 --> 00:13:04,587
I-I-I just busted guys 
like him every day.

261
00:13:04,622 --> 00:13:06,422
I don't remember,

262
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:07,924
and it's all written down somewhere.

263
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,994
Right. C.I. files.

264
00:13:20,337 --> 00:13:21,204
Hello?

265
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:22,972
Hey, lazy, hope I'm waking you up.

266
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:25,975
Hey, lazy? 
I haven't been to bed yet.

267
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,310
Look, I need your C.I. number.

268
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:29,479
I'm gonna file a status report.

269
00:13:29,513 --> 00:13:30,747
What's a C.I. number?

270
00:13:30,781 --> 00:13:34,217
Your assigned confidential 
informant number.

271
00:13:34,251 --> 00:13:35,819
It should be on your paychecks.

272
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,721
What checks?

273
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:41,491
Your paychecks from the county.

274
00:13:41,525 --> 00:13:44,260
Hello. I don't get any paychecks.

275
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:46,129
Quinn always pays me in cash.

276
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,632
Oh.

277
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:52,068
Okay. 
I'll get it from him then.

278
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,676
My client was supposed to 
be sent to county yesterday.

279
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,977
Apparently he was, 
but then they put him

280
00:14:01,011 --> 00:14:03,012
on the next bus right back 
here in the afternoon.

281
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:04,714
I've been chasing him 
all over the place.

282
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:06,916
We shouldn't have those mix-ups.

283
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:08,251
Is it a mix-up,

284
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:10,787
Or is Miguel fucking with me?

285
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,589
Ever since I started looking into him,

286
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,858
he's been going out of his
way to make my job harder.

287
00:14:14,925 --> 00:14:16,593
Well, you knew that was gonna happen.

288
00:14:16,627 --> 00:14:18,595
Doesn't mean I can't bitch about it.

289
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:22,599
Oh, anyway, I should go see my client

290
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,968
and ask what perfectly 
logical reason he had

291
00:14:25,002 --> 00:14:26,803
for lighting his 
ex-wife's house on fire.

292
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:28,605
Oh, I wanted to ask you.

293
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,808
Any chance you'd go to a 
police charity function

294
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:33,676
with me tomorrow night?

295
00:14:35,346 --> 00:14:37,013
Room full of cops?

296
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:38,414
I can't imagine anything more fun.

297
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:40,950
Shouldn't have asked.

298
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:42,452
I'm kidding. 
I'd love to go.

299
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:47,724
Okay, next on your list, Mr. King,

300
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:50,160
Santiago Ramirez.

301
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:52,162
He no longer works for me.

302
00:14:52,196 --> 00:14:53,129
That didn't end so well.

303
00:14:53,164 --> 00:14:55,365
Why? 
He was run over.

304
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:59,769
Uh, Mario Astorga. 
Didn't I talk to him?

305
00:14:59,804 --> 00:15:01,070
Yes, if you remember,

306
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:02,639
he's the one who 
found the body of that man.

307
00:15:02,673 --> 00:15:03,973
Right. Second victim.

308
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,742
Mario's one of my best foremen.

309
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:06,676
So he's a good guy?

310
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:10,013
What, he's not a good guy?

311
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:15,752
He has a temper. 
He gets very angry.

312
00:15:15,786 --> 00:15:18,521
Keep going.

313
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:20,423
I knew his family back in Nicaragua.

314
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,358
We're both from San Marcos.

315
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:23,626
But Mario had to leave.

316
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:24,627
Why?

317
00:15:26,897 --> 00:15:28,731
The police were looking for him.

318
00:15:28,766 --> 00:15:31,267
I heard he killed someone with a knife.

319
00:15:34,772 --> 00:15:36,072
Do you know where I can find Mario?

320
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:38,174
I don't know where he lives.

321
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,510
But tomorrow, 
he'll be at Bayside Park.

322
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:42,912
- You sure? 
- I make the schedule.

323
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:49,953
Fleeter pays off his gambling debts

324
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:52,055
by eliminating people for his bookie.

325
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:54,757
A schoolteacher here, 
a mother of two there.

326
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:56,359
People who can't settle their debts.

327
00:15:56,393 --> 00:15:58,094
Sending a message to others--

328
00:15:58,129 --> 00:15:59,562
"Pay up."

329
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,464
Do I help Miguel move forward on this,

330
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:03,800
or do I listen to Harry and shut it down?

331
00:16:06,537 --> 00:16:07,637
Hey, you.

332
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:10,740
Yeah, I just heard a 
love song on the radio

333
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,142
that reminded me of you.

334
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:13,409
Oh, that's sweet.

335
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:14,310
And it made me really angry.

336
00:16:15,913 --> 00:16:17,881
So have you gotten 
the wedding bands yet?

337
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:20,950
Um, I'm still doing my 
research, but I'm on it.

338
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,420
I gotta go.

339
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:35,398
Hey, you know anything 
about wedding rings?

340
00:16:35,432 --> 00:16:37,834
Yeah.

341
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,269
Wedding rings and nuclear fission are

342
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:40,537
like my secret specialties.

343
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:43,540
Thanks.

344
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:45,275
Your brother's kind of a dweeb, huh?

345
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:47,977
You say anything more about my brother,

346
00:16:48,045 --> 00:16:50,580
and I will kick your 
fucking nuts down your throat.

347
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:53,383
That doesn't even make any sense.

348
00:16:55,352 --> 00:16:58,755
So, hey, Anton doesn't have any priors,

349
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:00,023
you pay him in cash,

350
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,825
and I can't find him in the C.I. database.

351
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:03,893
Should be in there.

352
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:04,994
What are you hiding?

353
00:17:06,997 --> 00:17:08,998
Anton is not officially a C.I.

354
00:17:09,033 --> 00:17:11,134
What do you mean?

355
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:12,435
Come here for a second.

356
00:17:17,441 --> 00:17:20,877
Look, it was just 
easier for both of us.

357
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:22,946
I never filed an arrest report on him

358
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,714
so he has no police record.

359
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:25,849
I did him a favor.

360
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:28,351
Plus, it saved me the 
hassle of all that paperwork.

361
00:17:28,385 --> 00:17:32,622
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

362
00:17:32,656 --> 00:17:35,191
We used him as bait.

363
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:38,027
He was putting his life at risk, 
and he was

364
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,863
under no legal obligation to help us.

365
00:17:39,897 --> 00:17:41,464
No, no, no, there was just 
no paperwork, that's all.

366
00:17:41,499 --> 00:17:42,665
Not to mention the fact

367
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,300
that because he's not officially a C.I.,

368
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:46,536
there's no end date to when 
he's done working for us,

369
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,937
so you can just string him 
along as long as you want to.

370
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,672
What are you getting so upset about?

371
00:17:49,707 --> 00:17:50,773
What, are you in love with the guy?

372
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:55,645
No, I'm not in love with him.

373
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:57,614
But you're sleeping with him.

374
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:59,716
Jesus Christ,

375
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,784
do you know what kind of a 
bonehead mistake that is?

376
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,219
Sleeping with an informant?

377
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:05,255
I mean, it's that kind of judgment'll
screw up your career.

378
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:05,257
 

379
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,389
He's not an informant. 
You just said it.

380
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:07,457
But you didn't know.

381
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:09,125
Either way, it makes you look stupid.

382
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,461
No, you don't get to
lecture me, asshole.

383
00:18:11,495 --> 00:18:13,596
Anton could so easily 
file a huge lawsuit

384
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,131
against the police department

385
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,800
once he finds out 
how you fucked him over.

386
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,868
Yeah, if someone told him.

387
00:18:18,903 --> 00:18:22,105
Of course I'm gonna tell him.

388
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:25,308
You'll sell out a cop for 
some dope you're fucking?

389
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:29,846
That's not half as bad 
as being responsible

390
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,247
for another cop dying

391
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:33,249
because you don't like 
to play by the rules.

392
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:36,619
What?

393
00:18:36,654 --> 00:18:39,489
Yuki told me.

394
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:43,193
You don't know what the fuck 
you're talking about.

395
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,440
Despite Harry's warnings,

396
00:18:57,475 --> 00:19:00,510
here I am with Miguel, 
outside Billy Fleeter's house.

397
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:13,323
If I'm gonna stop this, 
it's gonna have to be soon.

398
00:19:13,357 --> 00:19:14,190
Are you sure you want to do this?

399
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:16,192
It's breaking and entering.

400
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:17,193
But you know that.

401
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:20,830
Yes, I do. 
Let's go.

402
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:23,967
Here, put these on.

403
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,305
Forensics guy who always 
has latex gloves on him.

404
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,740
No one would ever think twice, huh?

405
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:35,078
I guess you're right.

406
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:43,186
I don't want Miguel to see 
how easy this is for me.

407
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:50,260
Uh, you want me to try?

408
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:53,830
No, I think I--

409
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:55,632
I got it.

410
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:03,439
So what are we looking for?

411
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,108
Proof.

412
00:20:05,142 --> 00:20:07,143
That he's guilty.

413
00:20:07,178 --> 00:20:09,345
We know he bludgeons people to death,

414
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,416
so look for something... bludgeony.

415
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:23,927
Uh, this looks like it's
been knocked around some.

416
00:20:28,265 --> 00:20:29,399
Hold it up.

417
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:37,340
Purple?

418
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:38,842
Ergo...

419
00:20:38,876 --> 00:20:40,143
Blood.

420
00:20:40,177 --> 00:20:43,546
How easy is this?

421
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:45,215
I'll test it against the
blood of his alleged victims.

422
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:46,082
Let you know later today.

423
00:20:46,116 --> 00:20:47,584
You know it takes me two days

424
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:48,618
to get a search warrant,

425
00:20:48,652 --> 00:20:51,488
then another day to catalog evidence,

426
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:52,455
and then, a week before I 
can get the lab results.

427
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,258
This is definitely the way to go.

428
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,094
We also need to make sure that 
he's likely to kill again.

429
00:20:58,162 --> 00:20:59,162
Why is that?

430
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:02,098
It's just one of the rules.

431
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:04,100
One of these days I'm 
gonna make you sit down

432
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:05,668
and write out all these 
rules for me, but okay.

433
00:21:05,736 --> 00:21:07,804
He--he kills whenever he needs money.

434
00:21:07,838 --> 00:21:10,573
That's how he pays off his 
debts to the bookie.

435
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,742
Dex, I've tried a lot of 
these gamblers before,

436
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:14,043
and they all keep records.

437
00:21:14,078 --> 00:21:15,044
They're like anal about their numbers.

438
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,346
There's got to be like a ledger

439
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,314
around here somewhere.

440
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:21,718
Maybe there's a hidden 
wall safe or something.

441
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:23,720
We're talking about the man 
who leaves his murder weapon

442
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:25,355
in an umbrella stand.

443
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:26,589
Yeah, you're right.

444
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:27,590
What if we don't find anything?

445
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,459
Then we don't move forward.

446
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:42,939
Leave it, Dex.

447
00:21:42,973 --> 00:21:45,241
Just put it back.

448
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:46,843
You can stop this right now.

449
00:21:46,877 --> 00:21:49,312
Call it off.

450
00:21:49,346 --> 00:21:50,880
Why should I call it off?

451
00:21:50,915 --> 00:21:54,984
I didn't teach you the code 
to share with your buddies.

452
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:57,353
I taught you the code to keep you alive.

453
00:21:57,388 --> 00:22:00,490
You don't get to have friends, Dexter.

454
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:03,393
Nothing good can come out of this.

455
00:22:03,427 --> 00:22:06,663
Hey, Dex, you know what, I don't think

456
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,431
we're gonna find anything here, man.

457
00:22:08,499 --> 00:22:10,667
Look at you.

458
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:12,802
It's my life, dad.

459
00:22:12,837 --> 00:22:13,970
30 grand in the hole.

460
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:16,606
I think we know how he's 
gonna pay that off.

461
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,912
So, look, we moving forward?

462
00:22:22,947 --> 00:22:25,615
Yeah, moving forward.

463
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:27,250
If the blood matches.

464
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:34,124
I can't believe we are just now 
sending out invitations.

465
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:35,258
This is so last minute.

466
00:22:35,326 --> 00:22:38,027
It's okay. 
There's plenty of time.

467
00:22:38,062 --> 00:22:39,896
And Dexter's no help.

468
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,264
Do you know, 
I asked him for menu suggestions--

469
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:42,465
Do you know what he says?

470
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:43,666
I don't know.

471
00:22:43,701 --> 00:22:46,436
Steak. He says steak.

472
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,071
Yeah, that's great, Dexter.

473
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:49,305
That's really great.

474
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,474
We'll start with a steak appetizer,

475
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:53,076
followed by steak salad,

476
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,145
followed, of course, by a steak,

477
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:57,147
and then, of course, 
it'll all be topped off

478
00:22:57,181 --> 00:22:58,982
by a steak fucking cake.

479
00:22:59,016 --> 00:23:00,049
Rita.

480
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:01,317
Rita.

481
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:03,019
What?

482
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:04,420
The envelope.

483
00:23:04,455 --> 00:23:05,555
You're making a mess.

484
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:13,363
Why don't you stuff for a while?

485
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:15,298
And I'll do the addresses.

486
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:18,101
Okay.

487
00:23:23,474 --> 00:23:25,909
I've got big news.

488
00:23:25,943 --> 00:23:27,343
Yeah, about the skinner?

489
00:23:27,378 --> 00:23:29,813
No, about you.

490
00:23:33,517 --> 00:23:35,084
You're free.

491
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:37,787
Oh, yeah, ever since Abe Lincoln.

492
00:23:37,855 --> 00:23:40,256
I mean from the police department.

493
00:23:42,293 --> 00:23:45,795
You're no longer a C.I.

494
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,097
Hold on, wait a second.

495
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:51,468
The way Quinn explained it was, 
if I play ball,

496
00:23:51,502 --> 00:23:53,169
it would knock down my felony possession

497
00:23:53,204 --> 00:23:55,138
to a misdemeanor, 
and if I worked hard enough,

498
00:23:55,172 --> 00:23:56,573
it would go away all together.

499
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:59,075
Well, it's gone away.

500
00:24:02,446 --> 00:24:04,481
Hmm, how's that?

501
00:24:06,817 --> 00:24:08,384
Clerical error.

502
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:10,820
The necessary papers were never filed,

503
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:13,756
so there were never any 
charges for you to work off.

504
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,259
Wait, so I've been doing all this 
shit when I didn't have to?

505
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,261
 

506
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,228
Just be glad you don't 
have to do it anymore.

507
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:24,467
Well, thank you.

508
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:28,705
And I want to put 
protective detail on you.

509
00:24:28,739 --> 00:24:31,007
What?
No. No, Debra.

510
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,108
- Anton. 
- Listen.

511
00:24:32,143 --> 00:24:34,978
You said I'm free, 
so I'm free of this.

512
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,179
So we should celebrate.

513
00:24:36,247 --> 00:24:37,547
Dinner tonight.

514
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:40,583
Mm, no, I'm working tonight.

515
00:24:40,618 --> 00:24:41,985
How about we celebrate now?

516
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,187
I've got to go back to work.

517
00:24:44,255 --> 00:24:47,924
Tomorrow. 
Breakfast.

518
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:50,593
Perfect.

519
00:24:50,628 --> 00:24:53,029
So I'm guessing we got a 
blood match, huh?

520
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:55,298
That's why we're here.

521
00:24:58,068 --> 00:24:59,302
Life vests?

522
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:01,037
We can't exactly load up the cart

523
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:02,705
with axes and machetes, now can we?

524
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,607
Exactly right.

525
00:25:04,642 --> 00:25:07,310
So, um, have you given any thought

526
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,279
as to how you want to do this?

527
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,614
Mm-hmm. 
Small caliber gun to the head.

528
00:25:12,716 --> 00:25:15,151
Then I walk away.

529
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:16,319
That happens all the time.

530
00:25:16,353 --> 00:25:17,821
Guns make noise.

531
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:19,522
And they leave 
evidence behind-- bullets,

532
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,090
casings, powder residue.

533
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:22,325
Not to mention the body.

534
00:25:22,393 --> 00:25:23,827
Okay.

535
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:25,695
You don't want to create a crime scene.

536
00:25:25,729 --> 00:25:28,097
It's where experts like me 
gather evidence against you.

537
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:29,899
Okay, okay, I get it, I get it.

538
00:25:29,934 --> 00:25:31,868
What do you suggest?

539
00:25:35,005 --> 00:25:39,242
Up close and personal.

540
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,847
Hey, in case we have to tie anybody up.

541
00:25:46,884 --> 00:25:49,719
I'm gonna put together 
a starter kit for you.

542
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:12,842
Hey, you got better.

543
00:26:12,877 --> 00:26:14,744
Yeah, what do you know?

544
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:22,819
What better place to gamble on Miguel

545
00:26:22,887 --> 00:26:26,422
than a room full of games of chance?

546
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,992
Where slot machines go to die, huh?

547
00:26:29,026 --> 00:26:31,861
And at least one gambler.

548
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:43,106
I think that's it.

549
00:26:45,209 --> 00:26:46,376
Now we pick up Mr. Fleeter.

550
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,678
You ever drop a quart of milk?

551
00:26:48,746 --> 00:26:50,446
Watch it spread over the 
whole kitchen floor,

552
00:26:50,481 --> 00:26:51,481
The mess it makes?

553
00:26:53,684 --> 00:26:55,251
There's six quarts of 
blood in the human body.

554
00:26:55,286 --> 00:26:56,553
This isn't gonna be pretty.

555
00:26:58,956 --> 00:27:00,457
There's no shame in backing out.

556
00:27:00,491 --> 00:27:04,894
Dex, after 14 years of filing briefs,

557
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:09,532
trying cases, 
and dealing with bullshit...

558
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,935
...this is all gonna look 
nice and neat in comparison.

559
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:24,814
I have been to some lame-ass rubber chicken 
dinners in my day, okay. I know, I know.

560
00:27:24,815 --> 00:27:24,816
 

561
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:28,718
A no-host bar is punishment enough,
but no bar at all is cruel.

562
00:27:28,719 --> 00:27:28,720
 

563
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:30,286
And unusual.

564
00:27:30,354 --> 00:27:31,754
All right, 
I'm buying the first round.

565
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:32,922
Thank you.

566
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,257
That's pretty.

567
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,059
Gift from my first husband.

568
00:27:36,093 --> 00:27:39,028
Nice, nice.

569
00:27:39,063 --> 00:27:40,463
You're handsome.

570
00:27:40,498 --> 00:27:43,066
Dire ethanol emergency here.

571
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,501
What'll it be, ladies?

572
00:27:44,535 --> 00:27:46,436
Uh, cuba libre for this one.

573
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,537
Gracias.

574
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:50,206
And a double scotch 
neat soda back pour moi.

575
00:27:50,274 --> 00:27:52,208
Very nice.

576
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,413
Easy.

577
00:27:57,481 --> 00:28:00,717
Oh, and who was that guy, that--
that suit and haircut

578
00:28:00,784 --> 00:28:02,252
sitting next to you 
that wouldn't shut up?

579
00:28:02,286 --> 00:28:05,188
Oh, the, um, the senior liaison

580
00:28:05,222 --> 00:28:07,824
for the greater mi-- 
who knows?

581
00:28:07,892 --> 00:28:09,292
I don't know-- 
what's sad is that this is

582
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,561
the only social event 
I've been to in six months.

583
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:13,630
Oh, that doesn't qualify 
as a social event.

584
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:17,300
Okay.

585
00:28:17,334 --> 00:28:19,736
Can I get you anything else?

586
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,872
Yeah, how about a foot massage

587
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,576
with those big, 
gorgeous hands of yours?

588
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,480
They're kind of cold from scooping ice.

589
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,616
Hmm, but you're hot.

590
00:28:35,986 --> 00:28:37,086
Cheers.

591
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:41,458
- Nothing shy about you, huh? 
- No.

592
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:43,426
Well...

593
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:44,894
...after a pair of empty marriages,

594
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:49,898
I realized the secret to 
long life and happiness is,

595
00:28:50,336 --> 00:28:56,639
well, chocolate and flirting with 
young, hopefully hung men.

596
00:28:56,674 --> 00:28:58,808
Sounds fattening and dangerous.

597
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:01,044
- Oh, but so fun. 
- Hmm.

598
00:29:01,078 --> 00:29:02,812
Which, clearly, 
you're not having enough of.

599
00:29:02,847 --> 00:29:05,348
- I am. 
- Hmm.

600
00:29:05,382 --> 00:29:08,451
Look, believe me,
I've had my fun.

601
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:11,121
You need to be raising 
hell and breaking hearts.

602
00:29:11,155 --> 00:29:12,322
- I need to be? 
- You need to be.

603
00:29:13,657 --> 00:29:15,558
The skirt-wearing days 
do not last forever.

604
00:29:15,626 --> 00:29:17,527
We all end up old and in the way.

605
00:29:32,143 --> 00:29:34,544
I tell Miguel to be inconspicuous,

606
00:29:34,578 --> 00:29:35,645
and what does he do?

607
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,715
He shows up looking like the unabomber.

608
00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:40,917
I've got my work cut out for me.

609
00:29:40,951 --> 00:29:43,987
Oh, close game, close game.

610
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,157
Yeah, good deed.

611
00:29:49,326 --> 00:29:51,194
Good game, huh?

612
00:29:51,228 --> 00:29:53,730
No, it's not a good game.

613
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:55,865
Good game is when they don't 
beat the fucking point spread.

614
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,668
Oh, you got a little money riding on this?

615
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,972
A little bit.

616
00:30:11,415 --> 00:30:14,284
Shit.

617
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:17,086
Sorry.

618
00:30:19,156 --> 00:30:21,758
Not half as sorry as 
somebody else is gonna be.

619
00:30:24,762 --> 00:30:25,962
Here we go.

620
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:31,801
Buenas noches, Patron.

621
00:30:34,438 --> 00:30:35,538
Hey, who was that guy?

622
00:30:35,606 --> 00:30:37,640
Uh, I don't know. 
Some guy.

623
00:30:37,675 --> 00:30:39,275
How do you know him?

624
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,677
I don't.

625
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:42,745
Dex, sometimes people recognize me.

626
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,948
It's off.

627
00:30:44,982 --> 00:30:46,649
We're not doing this.

628
00:30:46,717 --> 00:30:48,151
We need to take down the kill room.

629
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:50,119
No, no, Dex, 
let's just wait.

630
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:51,454
No one ever goes in that room there.

631
00:30:51,489 --> 00:30:52,755
You saw.

632
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,823
Tranquilo, huh?

633
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:55,592
We decide tomorrow, okay?

634
00:30:55,626 --> 00:30:58,862
We'll see.

635
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:09,806
Anton. 
Me again.

636
00:31:09,874 --> 00:31:14,244
Waiting on you still.

637
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:15,512
The way I figured it,

638
00:31:15,546 --> 00:31:16,779
you gigged until closing,

639
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:18,348
and then you went home and 
smoked some of that herb

640
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:20,817
that you keep in your cereal box.

641
00:31:20,851 --> 00:31:24,454
And now, like all self-indulgent, 
vaguely adolescent musicians,

642
00:31:24,522 --> 00:31:26,956
you are sleeping in till noon-- 
and I'm okay with that.

643
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:28,625
Okay? I'm okay with that.

644
00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:30,827
As long as you're alone.

645
00:31:30,861 --> 00:31:33,363
Okay, okay. 
Too much caffeine.

646
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:49,746
A dutch farmer sees his crop fail.

647
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,349
No money to his name, 
he takes a job working on a boat.

648
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:56,553
An unseasonably strong wind 
blows him to Indonesia.

649
00:31:56,587 --> 00:31:58,788
He drops a bean into the soil.

650
00:31:58,823 --> 00:32:02,125
And voila, 400 years later...

651
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,927
Java.

652
00:32:03,961 --> 00:32:05,562
Everything is connected.

653
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:11,401
Hello?

654
00:32:11,435 --> 00:32:14,804
Dex, wanna hook up for breakfast? 
I'm buying.

655
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,874
I would, Deb, 
but I'm already freshly bageled.

656
00:32:17,942 --> 00:32:19,476
What are you doing up so early?

657
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,377
Trying to be a good fiance.

658
00:32:21,445 --> 00:32:24,447
Rita made me vice president in 
charge of wedding rings,

659
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:25,682
so I'm off to the jewelry store.

660
00:32:25,716 --> 00:32:29,319
And what do you know about 
buying women jewelry?

661
00:32:29,353 --> 00:32:31,721
Zero.

662
00:32:31,755 --> 00:32:33,490
Less than. 
Jesus, Dex.

663
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:35,125
Look, I'll meet you at that 
place on second street

664
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:37,060
at 10:00, okay?

665
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:46,503
The wedding band has to 
match the engagement ring,

666
00:32:46,537 --> 00:32:47,904
so what does that look like?

667
00:32:50,174 --> 00:32:52,942
She said she didn't want one.

668
00:32:52,977 --> 00:32:55,512
My God, you just get dumber every day.

669
00:32:55,546 --> 00:32:57,113
How do you survive in this world?

670
00:32:57,148 --> 00:32:58,148
Of course she wants one.

671
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:00,517
How am I supposed to know that?

672
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:03,620
You're such a Y-chromosome cliche.

673
00:33:03,654 --> 00:33:06,189
Just buy her a beautiful, romantic,

674
00:33:06,223 --> 00:33:09,392
I love you with all of my 
heart fucking engagement ring.

675
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:10,627
And Dex,

676
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:12,095
size matters.

677
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:19,636
Can I ask you something

678
00:33:19,703 --> 00:33:23,072
non-jewelry-wise?

679
00:33:23,107 --> 00:33:24,507
Go for it.

680
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:27,911
Okay, hypothetically...

681
00:33:29,847 --> 00:33:31,481
...let's say that 
this guy has to work

682
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:33,983
with this girl, 
but he fucking hates doing it,

683
00:33:34,051 --> 00:33:35,852
and too bad 'cause he 
has no fucking choice.

684
00:33:35,886 --> 00:33:37,320
And?

685
00:33:37,354 --> 00:33:42,625
And one thing leads to another...

686
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,796
...and this hypothetical guy...

687
00:33:46,831 --> 00:33:49,732
...starts having sex with 
this hypothetical girl.

688
00:33:49,767 --> 00:33:51,134
Hypothetical sex?

689
00:33:51,168 --> 00:33:53,436
Real sex.

690
00:33:53,471 --> 00:33:56,906
Really real sex.

691
00:33:56,941 --> 00:33:58,441
But then the guy is told 
that he no longer has to work

692
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:00,477
with this girl, and poof, 
he just disappears.

693
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:03,279
You know. 
Thin air. Adios.

694
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:06,049
So I'm wondering, is it possible

695
00:34:06,116 --> 00:34:08,751
if Mr. Hypothetical never really 
was all that into this girl?

696
00:34:08,786 --> 00:34:11,588
And he was just getting it on to, 
I don't know, pass the time

697
00:34:11,622 --> 00:34:15,225
or satisfy primal urges or whatever?

698
00:34:15,259 --> 00:34:17,994
Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.

699
00:34:19,864 --> 00:34:20,964
What the fuck do you know?

700
00:34:24,301 --> 00:34:26,102
That one.

701
00:34:26,137 --> 00:34:28,872
I gotta go sit in a hot car and 
wait for a suspect.

702
00:34:33,677 --> 00:34:38,047
Hey, Anton...

703
00:34:38,115 --> 00:34:39,282
...what the fuck? 
Call me.

704
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:56,499
I can bring Mario in myself.

705
00:34:56,534 --> 00:34:58,601
Let you get all the credit 
for catching the skinner?

706
00:34:58,636 --> 00:35:00,103
No fucking way.

707
00:35:00,137 --> 00:35:01,538
We don't know he's the skinner.

708
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,173
Closest thing we got.

709
00:35:06,744 --> 00:35:09,612
That was really fucking unfair 
what you said yesterday.

710
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:13,616
Well, is it true?

711
00:35:13,651 --> 00:35:16,786
That a cop died because of you?

712
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:19,589
It's not that simple.

713
00:35:19,623 --> 00:35:22,392
Try me.

714
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:26,329
Yuki Amado was my 
partner in narcotics.

715
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:29,466
There was another detective 
on our team, Stewart.

716
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:33,136
He made a bad judgment call and 
shot an unarmed coke dealer.

717
00:35:33,204 --> 00:35:35,505
I remember that.

718
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:39,843
Paralyzed him, right?

719
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:43,646
Then Stewart went on a bender

720
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:45,915
until he finally swallowed 
his own bullet.

721
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,584
How does Yuki make that your fault?

722
00:35:47,651 --> 00:35:52,689
Because Stewart had a 
problem with crystal meth.

723
00:35:52,723 --> 00:35:55,925
And I knew it.

724
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,961
And rather than bust him, 
I tried to protect him.

725
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:01,197
So it is your fault.

726
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:03,166
Listen to you.

727
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,101
Everything is so black and white.

728
00:36:05,136 --> 00:36:06,903
You could have stopped him.

729
00:36:06,937 --> 00:36:08,171
Yeah, sure, if I knew what I knew now.

730
00:36:08,205 --> 00:36:09,472
But that's not the way things work.

731
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:11,141
I'm sorry. 
You're just making excuses.

732
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:13,376
Yeah, of course I'm making excuses.

733
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:14,377
Don't you?

734
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:15,411
I mean, how else do you sleep at night?

735
00:36:15,446 --> 00:36:17,947
Who the fuck said I sleep at night?

736
00:36:17,982 --> 00:36:19,415
Then you must be killing yourself

737
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,451
over hooking up with Anton, huh?

738
00:36:24,555 --> 00:36:25,622
Yeah, it was probably a mistake.

739
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:26,656
I think he lost all interest

740
00:36:26,724 --> 00:36:28,224
once he realized he was free.

741
00:36:28,259 --> 00:36:30,894
Not so black and white, is it?

742
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:37,467
Mario.

743
00:36:45,576 --> 00:36:46,576
Mario Astorga?

744
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:50,713
Fuck!

745
00:37:04,328 --> 00:37:06,196
I'm guessing he didn't want to 
come in for questioning.

746
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,797
He made a run for it.

747
00:37:07,832 --> 00:37:09,432
Interview two.

748
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:12,435
What's his story?

749
00:37:12,503 --> 00:37:13,403
So far, he hasn't said a word.

750
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:15,271
Ah, you keep at it.

751
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:17,340
And you check with Nicaraguan 
authorities on priors.

752
00:37:17,408 --> 00:37:19,642
We're just waiting to hear back.

753
00:37:21,846 --> 00:37:23,346
I'm never gonna get out of here.

754
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:26,816
I gotta call Barbara and 
cancel our dinner.

755
00:37:26,884 --> 00:37:28,184
Oh, she's not gonna like that.

756
00:37:30,154 --> 00:37:31,754
I mean, it--
it's work.

757
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:34,257
I'm not here.

758
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:35,125
Leave a message.

759
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,660
Hello, Barbara.

760
00:37:37,728 --> 00:37:42,532
This is sergeant Angel Batista.

761
00:37:42,566 --> 00:37:44,934
Angel to you.

762
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:46,436
How are you?

763
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,505
Good I hope.

764
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:53,877
So I have to cancel 
our dinner tonight.

765
00:37:53,911 --> 00:37:58,281
And I am deeply, 
deeply apologetic.

766
00:37:58,315 --> 00:38:02,418
And I hope that you will 
let me make it up to you

767
00:38:02,453 --> 00:38:04,954
in whatever possible way

768
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:07,457
you wish things made up

769
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:11,161
to you in.

770
00:38:20,638 --> 00:38:23,373
Oh, I can tell

771
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,208
by that look on your face,

772
00:38:25,242 --> 00:38:27,644
you're trying to figure out 
how to tell me something

773
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:28,678
I don't wanna hear.

774
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,251
Calling off the kill.

775
00:38:35,286 --> 00:38:36,319
It's over.

776
00:38:36,353 --> 00:38:38,922
Really, Dex?

777
00:38:38,956 --> 00:38:41,858
Just because some guy 
recognized me in a bar?

778
00:38:41,892 --> 00:38:44,561
No one is ever gonna 
make that connection

779
00:38:44,595 --> 00:38:45,662
once Fleeter disappears.

780
00:38:45,696 --> 00:38:48,031
I'm not taking that chance.

781
00:38:48,065 --> 00:38:49,899
'Cause that's not the 
way you do things. right.

782
00:38:49,934 --> 00:38:50,900
No, it isn't.

783
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:53,703
Tell me about that.

784
00:38:55,372 --> 00:38:56,439
What are you asking?

785
00:38:56,474 --> 00:38:58,808
I wasn't gonna bring it up before,

786
00:38:58,843 --> 00:39:00,810
but I'm guessing...

787
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:02,512
...you've been doing this for a while.

788
00:39:02,546 --> 00:39:05,815
Freebo wasn't your first.

789
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,717
Was he?

790
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:14,124
How many, Dex?

791
00:39:16,327 --> 00:39:19,262
Okay, you know what, 
it doesn't matter.

792
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,633
I will respect your privacy.

793
00:39:23,701 --> 00:39:25,235
But I just don't understand

794
00:39:25,269 --> 00:39:28,037
why are you not gonna help me here?

795
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:31,207
Just because we--
we broke this little rule from your code?

796
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:32,942
Come on, Dex. 
It's okay.

797
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:34,277
No, it's not okay.

798
00:39:40,217 --> 00:39:41,251
You never should have
asked me to help you.

799
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:42,418
You're not ready.

800
00:39:42,486 --> 00:39:44,487
I'm not-- 
or is it you that's not ready?

801
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:48,892
Because we could have dealt with this 
Fleeter problem like three times already,

802
00:39:48,926 --> 00:39:51,761
and you keep throwing up all of these 
roadblocks with all this code bullshit.

803
00:39:51,762 --> 00:39:51,763
 

804
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:53,897
It's not bullshit.

805
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:55,098
Oh, come on. 
Keep telling yourself that, Dex.

806
00:39:55,132 --> 00:39:57,600
Come on, it's like wearing a 
fucking strait jacket, man.

807
00:39:57,635 --> 00:40:01,404
No, Miguel, it's just the opposite.

808
00:40:01,438 --> 00:40:04,841
If I didn't have the code, 
the darkness--

809
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:19,322
I could stand here and tell you

810
00:40:19,356 --> 00:40:22,592
another story about my abusive father,

811
00:40:22,626 --> 00:40:24,194
but what I haven't told 
you about is the time

812
00:40:24,228 --> 00:40:25,862
that I kicked the shit out of him

813
00:40:25,896 --> 00:40:27,530
and knocked him down a 
flight of stairs.

814
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:29,132
And I really enjoyed it.

815
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,070
That was the first time in my life

816
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:37,040
that I've ever felt...

817
00:40:37,074 --> 00:40:40,944
...powerful like...

818
00:40:40,978 --> 00:40:44,214
...like I was in control of--
of something.

819
00:40:44,281 --> 00:40:45,348
And ever since then, 
I've been trying

820
00:40:45,382 --> 00:40:47,917
to--
to get that feeling back again.

821
00:40:47,985 --> 00:40:50,156
So when you talk to me about...

822
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:56,926
...the darkness inside of you...

823
00:40:56,961 --> 00:41:01,364
...I understand.

824
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:02,432
I really do.

825
00:41:05,603 --> 00:41:08,571
I just want to let some of mine out too.

826
00:41:14,378 --> 00:41:18,681
I know you understand that.

827
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:26,222
You know what, Mr. Astorga?

828
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:29,058
Maybe I should have 
opened with my closer.

829
00:41:29,093 --> 00:41:30,927
Meaning?

830
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:32,762
We know about the incident in Managua,

831
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:35,965
the one where you stabbed a cab driver.

832
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,101
He touched my sister.

833
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:39,602
Sadly, he survived.

834
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:42,071
That's a heartbreaking story.

835
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:44,174
Still you are an illegal guest

836
00:41:44,208 --> 00:41:46,776
of our country. 
- Immigration's on the way.

837
00:41:46,811 --> 00:41:48,444
You're gonna be on a 
plane before the sun comes up.

838
00:41:48,479 --> 00:41:50,346
But I have a son.

839
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:51,314
He was born here.

840
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:52,315
He's a U.S. citizen.

841
00:41:52,349 --> 00:41:53,483
He's my life.

842
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:54,584
Your boy's a U.S. citizen?

843
00:41:54,618 --> 00:41:56,019
Yes.

844
00:41:56,053 --> 00:41:57,787
Then he stays. 
Maybe your wife too.

845
00:41:57,822 --> 00:41:58,822
We don't know yet.

846
00:41:58,856 --> 00:42:00,190
But we do know is if you keep

847
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:01,524
stonewalling us on this skinner case,

848
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:03,159
you are gone on a one-way ticket.

849
00:42:03,194 --> 00:42:06,162
No matter what you try to do to me,

850
00:42:06,197 --> 00:42:07,497
the facts ain't changing.

851
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:08,998
'cause I don't know anything 
about anything.

852
00:42:09,033 --> 00:42:11,267
Then why would George King 
suggest otherwise?

853
00:42:18,342 --> 00:42:20,210
Senor King said I knew something?

854
00:42:20,244 --> 00:42:23,146
In a word?

855
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,214
Yup.

856
00:42:28,118 --> 00:42:31,121
And senor King will be very disappointed

857
00:42:31,155 --> 00:42:32,689
to hear you're calling him a liar.

858
00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:34,357
No!

859
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:35,458
Please.

860
00:42:35,493 --> 00:42:38,061
What are you so afraid of, Mario?

861
00:42:40,498 --> 00:42:42,532
Yeah, what'd this guy do to you?

862
00:42:42,566 --> 00:42:43,867
What can he do to you?

863
00:42:43,901 --> 00:42:47,137
Please.

864
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:48,938
Send me back to Nicaragua.

865
00:42:48,973 --> 00:42:50,006
Alone?

866
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,975
Si. Yes.

867
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:53,476
Alone.

868
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,288
We mentioned George King's name 
once and he turns to jell-o.

869
00:43:05,322 --> 00:43:06,689
Scared to death of him.

870
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:07,924
You thinking what I'm thinking?

871
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:12,262
Yeah, King jobbed us.
I'm gonna issue a bolo for him.

872
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:12,264
 

873
00:43:23,874 --> 00:43:25,775
Hello?

874
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:26,743
Shit.

875
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,313
Who was it?

876
00:43:30,347 --> 00:43:32,882
Uh, me.

877
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:35,885
I was checking to see 
if my phone was working.

878
00:43:37,755 --> 00:43:40,690
Barbara never called me back.

879
00:43:40,724 --> 00:43:42,058
I think I ruined it.

880
00:43:42,092 --> 00:43:45,161
Sorry.

881
00:43:45,229 --> 00:43:47,363
Dating sucks.

882
00:43:47,398 --> 00:43:50,700
Yeah.

883
00:43:50,734 --> 00:43:54,037
Well, I'm outta here.

884
00:43:54,071 --> 00:43:56,339
Still no George King, 
but we put the word out.

885
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:10,887
Barbara.

886
00:44:15,893 --> 00:44:17,660
You got my message.

887
00:44:17,695 --> 00:44:21,498
Yup. been listening to it all day.

888
00:44:21,532 --> 00:44:24,334
Makes me laugh every time.

889
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:26,569
It's pretty bad, huh?

890
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:28,771
Um, the worst.

891
00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:32,942
I'm glad I amuse you.

892
00:44:32,977 --> 00:44:35,278
Not half as glad as I am.

893
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:48,892
Hey, did they finish already?

894
00:44:48,926 --> 00:44:50,927
They never even started.

895
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:52,295
What do you mean?

896
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:53,296
Where's Anton?

897
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:54,564
He never showed.

898
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:56,166
- Why? 
- I don't know.

899
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,134
They waited an hour. 
They called.

900
00:44:58,169 --> 00:44:59,302
Doesn't answer.

901
00:44:59,336 --> 00:45:02,539
Thanks.

902
00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:17,554
What the f--

903
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:34,937
Poetic.

904
00:45:44,515 --> 00:45:45,615
Are you ready?

905
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:48,117
I am.

906
00:45:53,591 --> 00:45:56,860
Thank you.

907
00:45:56,894 --> 00:45:58,695
Thank you for this.

908
00:45:58,729 --> 00:46:00,930
For letting me in.

909
00:46:00,965 --> 00:46:04,734
For showing me the way.

910
00:46:24,021 --> 00:46:25,155
Look at him.

911
00:46:26,891 --> 00:46:30,994
Look at him trying to figure it all out.

912
00:46:31,028 --> 00:46:32,629
What the fuck?

913
00:46:34,832 --> 00:46:36,399
We're here because of them.

914
00:46:36,467 --> 00:46:40,436
Those lives that you destroyed.

915
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:43,940
Who are you?

916
00:46:43,974 --> 00:46:47,811
We're justice.

917
00:46:52,817 --> 00:46:56,619
Hey, man, I was just doing what I had to do.

918
00:46:56,654 --> 00:46:57,921
As are we.

919
00:47:05,496 --> 00:47:07,464
I've always done the deed alone.

920
00:47:07,498 --> 00:47:09,933
Never stood outside.

921
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,335
Been a witness to this moment.

922
00:47:17,174 --> 00:47:19,175
The moment of truth.

923
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:21,377
Can Miguel go through with it?

924
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:23,847
Can he step out of the cocoon and fly?

925
00:48:04,655 --> 00:48:06,089
How do you feel?

926
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:17,534
Fantastic.

927
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:29,312
Shouldn't we get him out of here?

928
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:33,883
As bonded as we may feel, 
there are still things

929
00:48:33,918 --> 00:48:35,418
I can't share with Miguel.

930
00:48:35,452 --> 00:48:36,452
I got it.

931
00:48:36,487 --> 00:48:40,790
No, it's--it's too much work.

932
00:48:40,825 --> 00:48:43,393
Leaving no trace is my 
area of expertise.

933
00:48:43,427 --> 00:48:46,563
Yeah, but, Dex--

934
00:48:46,597 --> 00:48:49,632
Get home before Sylvia starts to 
wonder where you are.

935
00:48:49,667 --> 00:48:51,434
I mean it.

936
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:53,102
Okay.

937
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,604
I'm going.

938
00:48:59,844 --> 00:49:01,978
Not a good idea.

939
00:49:06,317 --> 00:49:08,885
That would be against your code, huh?

940
00:49:08,953 --> 00:49:11,121
Sorry.

941
00:49:27,705 --> 00:49:30,039
Anton, you in there?

942
00:49:38,883 --> 00:49:41,050
Hello, Anton?

943
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:03,807
Oh, God.

944
00:50:11,015 --> 00:50:11,915
Shit.

945
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,983
Trimmed trees.

946
00:50:14,018 --> 00:50:15,084
The skinner's been here.

947
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,971
You were wrong.

948
00:50:35,005 --> 00:50:36,005
It went well.

949
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,373
Maybe.

950
00:50:37,408 --> 00:50:38,475
Who knows?

951
00:50:38,509 --> 00:50:40,910
You can't admit it.

952
00:50:40,945 --> 00:50:41,945
He did good.

953
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:43,646
That was never the issue, Dex.

954
00:50:43,681 --> 00:50:47,183
I was only thinking about you.

955
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:49,352
Of course.

956
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,889
You've set something in motion here.

957
00:50:52,923 --> 00:50:55,391
Everything Miguel does from 
now on is connected to you.

958
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:59,929
It's a lot of responsibility 
teaching him what you just did.

959
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:02,866
A heavy burden.

960
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:06,236
It was too much for me to bear.

961
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,370
I hope you're a stronger man.

962
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:44,674
You're still up.

963
00:51:46,911 --> 00:51:47,777
I can't sleep.

964
00:52:07,998 --> 00:52:09,132
I hope it's okay.

965
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,801
My God.

966
00:52:11,836 --> 00:52:14,604
It's--
it's perfect.

967
00:52:17,341 --> 00:52:21,244
Dexter, God, you've been such a 
saint through all this.

968
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:24,614
I don't know 
how you've put up with me.

969
00:52:24,648 --> 00:52:26,049
If you need me to help out

970
00:52:26,083 --> 00:52:27,517
with more of the wedding stuff-- 
- No.

971
00:52:27,551 --> 00:52:32,055
No, it's...

972
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:34,157
...it's the hormones.

973
00:52:34,225 --> 00:52:36,459
I go crazy when I'm pregnant.

974
00:52:36,527 --> 00:52:38,394
Tell me about it.

975
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:39,696
That's not true.

976
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:43,166
You should just get out while you can.

977
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,267
Just run for your life.

978
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,568
I won't.

979
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:50,373
I promise.

980
00:52:50,407 --> 00:52:53,009
It's like I have this 
monster living inside of me,

981
00:52:53,043 --> 00:52:54,644
and I don't know how to control it.

982
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,551
Maybe I can help you out with that one.

983
00:53:11,495 --> 00:53:14,430
It's so beautiful.

984
00:53:17,635 --> 00:53:19,636
It's been said

985
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:22,972
that a butterfly can flap 
its wings in Brazil...

986
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:29,045
...and set off a storm in Florida.

987
00:53:31,916 --> 00:53:36,419
I'm taking the chance that's
not entirely true.

988
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,000
