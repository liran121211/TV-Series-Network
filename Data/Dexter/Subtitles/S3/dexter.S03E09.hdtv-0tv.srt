1
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,580
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,680
I found a fucking
leadon the skinner case.

3
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,720
The skinner is usingtree-trimming
as a cover for surveillance.

4
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:51,060
He watchesfrom the trees, and when
the time is right,he grabs them.

5
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,420
Mr. King.

6
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,790
We met at the scene of oursecond
victim, is that correct?

7
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,310
yes, that is correct.

8
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,710
Mario astorga?

9
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,520
I don't know anythingabout anything.

10
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,080
Then why would george
kingsuggest otherwise?

11
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,190
What are you so afraid of,mario?

12
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,770
This is the shirt I was
wearingwhen freebo met his end.

13
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,140
That's his bloodright there.

14
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,600
This shirt implicates mein his death.

15
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:14,700
I trust you, and I want youto trust me.

16
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,750
but he's being secretive.
He's never home.

17
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,800
He says he's with dexter.
But I thinkit's a cover.

18
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,960
freebo's final resting place.

19
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,760
Hiding a bodyin a cemetery.
You're fucking brilliant.

20
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,850
We need to goafter
the root cause-

21
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,060
bloodsucking, soullessdefense
attorney ellen wolf!

22
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,980
We can't kill her.

23
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,170
I see.

24
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,970
- This is personal.
- Fuck yes,this is personal.

25
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,230
I'm asking you to do
thisfor me as my friend.

26
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,940
- I'm sorry. No.
- Well, then, fuck you.

27
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,490
Someone loaned freebosome money and is
willing to skin peopleto get it back.

28
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,390
We're gonna spread the word
that anton knowswhere freebo is.

29
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,350
Which meansthat the skinner
will be looking for me.

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,840
What are you hiding?

31
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,030
Anton is not officiallya C.I.

32
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,790
We used him as bait.

33
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,340
I mean, what, are you
in lovewith the guy?

34
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,240
Anton, you in there?
Shit. Trimmed trees.

35
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,580
The skinner's been here.

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,280
I'm readyto get my hands dirty.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,120
I've always done the deed alone.

38
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,190
Never stood outside.

39
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,980
Been a witnessto this moment.

40
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,580
you've set somethingin motion here.

41
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,300
Everything miguel doesfrom
now on is connected to you.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,190
<font color=#00FFFF>Dexter Season03
Episode09 About Last Night</font>

43
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,380
Today I wake up,
kiss the wife-to-be...

44
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,390
feed the
stepkids-to-be,

45
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:54,310
dress myself in the
usual pants, shirt...

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,470
and pretense.

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,720
But last night, it was no pretense.

48
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,840
Miguel and I took a life. Together.

49
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,740
And today, someone knows my truth.

50
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,120
Shares my reality.

51
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,110
I'm not alone.

52
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,610
Sylvia, good morning.

53
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,640
Sorry for coming overso early.

54
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,920
It's okay.

55
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,510
But I need to see your
facewhen I ask you.

56
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,190
Ask me?

57
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,620
Syl, what is it?

58
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,430
Miguel was out till all hourslast night.

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,140
He says he was with you. Is that true?

60
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,930
Absolutely. We were just
hanging. Being guys. You know.

61
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,010
Miguel was tellingthe truth.

62
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,570
You see,there's nothing to worry about.

63
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,030
Dexter didn't get
heretill late. It was-

64
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,830
it had to bealmost midnight.

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,880
Miguel got homean hour ago.

66
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,340
He's having an affair.

67
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,450
Um, no. No, no. You don't know that.

68
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,780
When you've been marriedas long as we
have, you knowwhen your husband's lying.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,700
Something to look forward to.

70
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,960
Maybe dexter knowswhere he went.

71
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,630
I really don'T.

72
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:24,300
But he did talk about a
case he needed to look over.

73
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,110
At the office.

74
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,760
This really isn'tyour
problem. I should go.

75
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,280
No. No, no, no.

76
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,930
You stay here for as
longas you need to, okay?

77
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,070
I'll just leave.

78
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,590
Work.

79
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,120
With a detour on the way.

80
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,770
Dex. Dex, man.

81
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,840
How you doing? You okay?

82
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,700
- I'm good.
- Me too.

83
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,330
It's like there wasan imbalance
in the world, and we righted it.

84
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,870
With our own hands.

85
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,050
It was deserving.

86
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,850
I don't know. I feel real.

87
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,760
Like maybe for the first timein my life.

88
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,120
I know what you mean.

89
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,110
But. If we're thinkingabout continuing
these extracurricular activities...

90
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,070
- absolutely.
- You need to workon your alibis.

91
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,770
Syl stopped by this
morning,wondering where you'd been.

92
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,020
Ah, shit. I'm a moron.

93
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,480
I tried to cover for you,but
I thought you went home.

94
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,580
I'm sorry, man.

95
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,710
I went overto jack's hideaway over
on 57th. I was, like, so wired.

96
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,620
The next thing I know,the
sun was coming up.

97
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,810
Jack's hideaway.

98
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,630
Don't worry about
syl. I can handle that.

99
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,830
I got a motion hearingthis
morning, though, I don't wanna miss.

100
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,740
I'll get betterat this.

101
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,140
With your help.

102
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:22,040
I stalked a wife-killer at jack's hideaway
last year,grabbed him right at closing.

103
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,360
At 2:00 A.M.

104
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,140
Sylvia said miguel got homean hour ago.

105
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,270
Did he just lie? To me?

106
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,790
Another detour.

107
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,940
There's nothing here either.

108
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,120
Well, what about the
blinds? What about the glass?

109
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,250
Checked 'em. Deb, there's no blood.

110
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,110
Anton didn't just followthe
skinner out of here.

111
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,650
I'll keep looking.

112
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,060
I think we needto recanvass.

113
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,890
We've already talkedto
everyone in the building.

114
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,610
What about the kids? They're awake now.

115
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,030
We'll talk to the kids.

116
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,180
What do we got?

117
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,150
The skinner has anton.
Did you see the trees?

118
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,230
I saw them. It doesn't
mean he got nabbed.

119
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,780
The coffee potwas left burning. I
mean, he definitely leftin a hurry.

120
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,450
What the hell was
anton doingback in town?

121
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,980
He never left.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He contacted me, but he
wouldn'tagree to surveillance.

123
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,610
Who cares if he agrees? He's a C.I.

124
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,350
That's why we used himas
bait in the first place.

125
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,090
Guys. No liner.

126
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,190
The building trash dumpster.

127
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,290
Subscription renewal formfrom rolling
stone addressed to anton briggs.

128
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,930
This is his garbage.

129
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,430
So the bag split on
impactwith the dumpster here.

130
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,850
he threw it. Defensive move.

131
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,690
Why the hell didn't he usehis fists?

132
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,420
he was hurt. There's
blood and some hair.

133
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,280
Looks like he hit his
headagainst the wall.

134
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,820
How bad?

135
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,680
Hard enough to daze him.

136
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,460
A blow from behind could
havepropelled him forward.

137
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,150
So anton comes down to emptythe
garbage, the skinner clocks him,

138
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,960
he does a headerinto the wall,
throws the bagas a last ditch.

139
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,700
Skinner tosses him in
the carand peels out.

140
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,080
Got tire marks here.

141
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,230
Fuck.

142
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:16,060
all right, we got a confirmed
missing person. Anton briggs.

143
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,330
Find a photo. Get his face
outto all patrols and the media.

144
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,820
Set up a tip line.

145
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,210
Pull in some off-duties
to man the phone bank.

146
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,790
Skinner's had himfor 24 hours.

147
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,660
How long do you thinkhe can hold out?

148
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,800
Well, the M.E.'S reporton the other
victims suggests the skinnerstarts slow.

149
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,460
Probably to build fear.
Anton's a big guy. A lotta skin.

150
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,600
That's meantto be comforting.

151
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,350
George king,we need to bring him in.

152
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,580
We gotta find him first.

153
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,430
We got bolos out on himall night long.

154
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,680
Haven't found him yet. We
could search his house,though.

155
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,800
We still holding king's
foremanon resisting arrest, right?

156
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,560
He give us anythingthat'll
buy us a warrant?

157
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,170
Mario astorga clammed
up. Too scared of king.

158
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,780
He would rather be deportedaway from
his family than to talk about king.

159
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,320
- Is that all we got?
- Yeah.

160
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,830
I'll try and finda flexible judge.

161
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,330
Let me knowwhen it comes in.
I'm gonna go siton king's house.

162
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,130
We'll go siton king's house.

163
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:16,800
Hey, I want thisaboveboard. Use
restraint. Wait on the warrant.

164
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,830
And I hope they find
somethingbecause even if we nab king,

165
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,320
we got nothing to hold him onpast today.

166
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,790
A day can savea lot of skin.

167
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,240
I keep telling you. You have to listen.

168
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,090
If I knewwhere freebo was, I'd tell you.

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,260
Don't you fucking understand,
man? It was the cops.

170
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,730
I was- I was
fucking bait.

171
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,760
All right, all right, you're right.

172
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,110
I know where he is. I can
show you. I can show you.

173
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,140
All right, listen to me.

174
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,810
He owes you money,right?

175
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:08,570
He owes you money? I can get you money.

176
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,690
I can find you money.

177
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,060
I don't wantyour money.

178
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,270
I loaned freebothat money.

179
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,000
This is about respect.

180
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:42,120
With your first cut,you had all
night to consider my questions.

181
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:49,190
This cut,you only have one hour.

182
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,210
And when I return,there'll be no rest.

183
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,870
Use the time to think about
the skin you have left to lose.

184
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,810
Hi, how are you?

185
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,120
Are you screeningyour calls? Ellen?

186
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,760
I'm surprised you missed the
motion hearing this morning.

187
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,320

Either way, let me knowyou're
all right. Okay? Bye.

191
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,130
Miguel went missinglast night.

192
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,180
Ellen's missingthis morning.

193
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,130
Could be a coincidence.

194
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,220
Patrol's been set up hereall night.

195
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,790
King's not inside.

196
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,780

213
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,680
That's too bad.

214
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,440
Oh, no, serendipitousactually.
It worked in my favor.

215
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,730

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,790
What are you looking for?

263
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,300
More like who. You wanna tell
uswhere you've been all night?

264
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:27,990
Oh, I work, ma'am. Nights.
Mornings. Trees keep growing.

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,120
It's a good business. I'm
only hometo have breakfast.

266
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,170
You wanna grab a
bageldown at the station?

What, you got somewhereyou need to be?

270
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,650
- Trees.
- They'll wait.

271
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,210
Am I under arrest, sir?

272
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,990
No, but we can hold youfor questioning.

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,190
For the day.

274
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,790
what are you, a lawyer?

275
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,490
Oh, no, wait, I forgot.
You're a fucking tree trimmer.

276
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,800
I moved to this countryfor
its amazing liberties.

277
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:00,960
- I know my rights.
- Great.

278
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,200
George king is hanging
youout to dry, mario.

279
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,680
I thought you might
want a chance-

280
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,170
I've seen the fear.

281
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,720
An inch away from death fear.

282
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,090
it'd be a shame to leave your
wife and your little baby behind.

283
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:22,180
His is real.

284
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,280
What makes you so scary,george king?

285
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,800
you miss your country,george?

286
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,440
I like this country,sir.

287
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,460
I like miami, sir.

288
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,070
Nicaragua can be a rough place,huh?

289
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,430
You in the military down there?

290
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,630
Death squads, contras.

291
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,700
You woulda beenabout the right
age to get caught upin that.

292
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,900
You learn a few things there,george?

293
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,290
I learn respect, sir.

294
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:49,680
No interrogation techniques?

295
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,390
Maybe a little snatch and grab.
What do they call that? Renditioning?

296
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,160
Oh, I don't know that,ma'am.

297
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,070
Ma'am, sir.

298
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,420
You did learn respect.

299
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,750
Did you show any fucking respectto
wendell when you tore his skin off?

300
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,360
How about anton when you
bashedhim over the goddamn head?

301
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:12,040
morgan, you want a coffee?

302
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:14,770
Why don't you geta coffee?

303
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,090
Yeah. Sure.

304
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,020
He looks harmless,doesn't he?

305
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,700
They usually do.

306
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:35,630
I don't know. Maybe he's not our guy.

307
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,480
Well, you should trustyour
instincts on this one.

308
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,180
This oneof your creepy insights?

309
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,620
Why does it always haveto be creepy?

310
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,550
Fucking tell me.

311
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,390
He's heldlife and death in his hands.

312
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,660
He likes it.

313
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,040
I knew it.

314
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,460
So how do I crackthis sick fuck's brain?

315
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,630
From what I've readabout
these sick fucks,

316
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,220
they usually havesome sort of code.

317
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,310
I'd say disrespect is highon
his list of violations.

318
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,550
Maybe if you came at himwith deference.

319
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,690
Deference, huh?

320
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,900
Yeah, think about it. Hey, lieutenant.

321
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:22,600
I heard you sayyour friend ellen
is ill. Was it a stomach thing?

322
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,220
Because I just
readthis article-

323
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,900
I don't knowwhat it is. I
haven't heard backfrom her.

324
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,300
I left her three messages.
I'm a little worried.

325
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah, me too.

326
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,590
I hope she didn't getin
an accident or something.

327
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,610
Excuse me. I have an errand to run.

328
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,020
A home office.

329
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,430
If she were sick,this is where she'd be.

330
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,710
Her car's here.

331
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,970
She could have gonefor
a really long walk.

332
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,930
Or borrowed a friend's car.

333
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,120
Or maybe laguerta's rightand ellen is
comatose in some hospital,post-accident.

334
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,600
One can hope.

335
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,280
Not that there are any
signsof foul play here.

336
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,160
But harry did raise meto be paranoid.

337
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,350
Blood. Damn it.

338
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,430
No. Miguel wouldn't do this.
We agreedellen wolf is innocent.

339
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,490
hello.

340
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,750
It's just blood. There's no body.

341
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,360
He would even knowwhat to do with one.
I never taught himhow to dispose...

342
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:05,990
as far as miguel knows,the best place to
dispose of a bodyis beneath an open grave.

343
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:09,190
Good thinking.

344
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:19,780
Hello.

345
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:22,650
Uh, set-ups arein the kitchen.

346
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,380
Miguel?

347
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:28,470
Hi. Any bites?

348
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,340
No, just nosy neighborsso far.

349
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,610
Syl's office saidthat she would
be here. Is she out back or-

350
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,770
no, she wasn't feeling upto an open
house, so I'm sitting it for heR.

351
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,600
Well, you'rea good friend.

352
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,910
Here. You should have these.

353
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,290
How about I make suresyl gets them?

354
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,600
Miguel.

355
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,070
Flowers are a good
start,but can I be honest?

356
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,630
I like honest.

357
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,990
- You're an idiot.
- That's honest.

358
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,500
You were smart enoughto ask her to marry
you, and she's stillthat same fantastic woman.

359
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,020
You don't thinkI know that?

360
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,150
Well, you're not actingthat way.

361
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,480
I am not havinga goddamn affair, okay.

362
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:21,110
- All right, let's say that's the truth.
- It is.

363
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,400
Either way,you violated her trust.

364
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,180
I just needed space.

365
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,860
I've got everything falling apart around me
now, you know, oscar, ramon,now my cases-

366
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,600
and the same thingsare falling apart
for her, because she's your partner.

367
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,840
You're a wise person,aren't you?

368
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,950
Well, if I am, it's onlybecause I've
learned from my many, many mistakes.

369
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,510
You have insight.

370
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,600
And I tell you what.

371
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm gonna followyour lead.

372
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,860
So point the way.

373
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:21,300
Mr. King, I understand that
respect is very importantto you.

374
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,400
Yes, ma'am.

375
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,140
And I'm sure you feel that
people have to earnyour respect.

376
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,140
Yes, ma'am.

377
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,090
I feellike you've earned this.

378
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
What's the matter,little gardener? Huh?

379
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,010
You feel disrespected?

380
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,850
You'll get used to itin prison
because your foreman mario'snext door,

381
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,500
and he is spillinghis guts.

382
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,690
You are so surehe's afraid of you. Why?

383
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,950
What did you doto him?

384
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,340
What did you doto anton?What did you do?

385
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,530
Morgan!

386
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,090
Fuck.

387
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,610
Help!

388
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,310
Help me!

389
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,090
You know, we're supposedto
be working together.

390
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,210
You keep going off half-cocked.
How am I supposed to trust you?

391
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,680
You trust me? That's unbelievable.

392
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,310
You're lucky batista wasn'twatching the
monitors. What the fuckwere you thinking?

393
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,810
I was thinkingabout anton.
You oughta try itsome time.

394
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,400
I want to find himjust as bad as you do.

395
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,290
If you gave a shitabout anton, you
wouldn't have made himyour fake C.I.

396
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,740
And he wouldn't be messed upin this.

397
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,680
You're the onetoo busy boning him to
provide himwith protective surveillance.

398
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,980
You are so crossing the lineright now.

399
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,270
Am I?

400
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,100
You knew anton was in town.

401
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,060
And I fucking told himto call it in.

402
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,590
You should have called
it inyour fucking self.

403
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,210
I know. It's my fault.

404
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,940
No, you're right.

405
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,050
I used him. I...

406
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,560
just fucking used him.

407
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,400
We can only hold george
kingfor a few more hours.

408
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,600
We better get backto work.

409
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,890
Schedule says there
arefour funerals today.

410
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,500
Graves back-hoed last night.

411
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,280
That's fourmiguel
could have chosen from.

412
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,790
She's not here. That's one down.

413
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,700
That blood might not
even belongto ellen.

414
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:34,040
Could be a client's blood.
Or the previous owner'S.

415
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,120
He did it. Miguel really did it.

416
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,820
And I taught him how.
I guided him to this.

417
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:03,200
I created... this.

418
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,220
I'm sorry.

419
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,440
Miguel's making his own choicesnow.

420
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,960
Look who he chose.

421
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,100
She didn't deserve this.

422
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,450
You can say it.

423
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:54,580
Won't change anything, dex,
whether I told you so or not.

424
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,420
Easier to accept it.

425
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,880
'Cause there'll be plenty
morewhere ellen came from.

426
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,520
No, there won'T.

427
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,150
Hey, miguel, is it too
lateto grab that lunch?

428
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:35,830
So what do you thinkof
this george king sicko?

429
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,000
Skinner suspect?

430
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,580
I gotta go from hereto your precinct

431
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,190
to discuss whether we're
gonnafile charges against this guy.

432
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,790
- You thinkhe's the guy?
- He's the guy.

433
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,200
Skinner.

434
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:57,410
Well,if the law can't
get him, you and I can.

435
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,680
In fact, I could have this guy
outon the streets in a few hours.

436
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,720
You need some helpon this one,
or is this another solo project?

437
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,790
We agreed to leaveellen wolf alone.

438
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,520
Technically, we agreednot to
kill her together. And we didn'T.

439
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:26,720
- Technically? - I know.
That's-that's bullshit.

440
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,790
I didn't tell you because
I knowyou wouldn't approve.

441
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,160
'Cause she wasn't guilty.

442
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,190
Apparently, we have a
differentdefinition of that word.

443
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,810
You got rid of herbecause
she got in your way.

444
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,060
Whatever happenedto serving justice?

445
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:47,650
Is that reallywhy you do
this, dex? To serve justice?

446
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,510
We don't have to pretendwith each other.

447
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,090
- That's what I thought.
- Okay.

448
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,300
I should have told you.

449
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,140
It was a chickenshit thingto
do, and I abused your trust-

450
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,900
a trust, by the way,that
wasn't easy to earn.

451
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:08,040
That's not lost on me.

452
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,470
I gave you my shirtlinking
me to freebo's death.

453
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,880
I wish I had another oneto prove to you
how importantthis partnership is to me.

454
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,310
I'd takea little remorse.

455
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,410
You would knowthat I don't feel it.

456
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,100
Yeah, you'll feel itif you get caught.

457
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,190
I didn't leaveany evidence.

458
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,460
They're just gonna think it
wasone of her scumbag clients.

459
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,580
Right. Right, just another lowlifewho
beat and stabbedan innocent woman.

460
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,360
Again,different definitions.

461
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,830
Dex.

462
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,370
This is the natureof a real friendship.

463
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,000
We're gonna disagree.

464
00:30:58,010 --> 00:30:59,980
And when we do,we just go our own way.

465
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,420
No, no moreindividual projects.

466
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,490
Individuality is what
makesamerica great.

467
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,380
I don't think that's whatour
forefathers had in mind.

468
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,440
Look. I'm a big boy.
I know what I'm doing.

469
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:18,700
Eventually, you're gonna trust that too.

470
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,940
I'll see youover at the precinct.

471
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,830
He thinks he's untouchable.

472
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,490
He's not. It's time he learned that.

473
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,130
Probably not a lot of
leadson that screen.

474
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:55,360
King's a ghost.

475
00:31:55,390 --> 00:32:00,320
He grabbed anton without a single security
camerain the area picking up him or his truck.

476
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,880
There's not one shotto implicate him.

477
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,240
So we'll have to get itout of king.

478
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,770
You gonna let quinn do iton his own.

479
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,470
My time is better spent here.

480
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,360
Away from people.

481
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:26,070
You know, someone- a
good friend, actually-

482
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,220
told me I had a big wallaround me.

483
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,690
I thought it made me a better cop.

484
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,830
I don't think it did.

485
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:07,250
They look at himand see a defender of
truth, justice, and the american way.

486
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:10,380
I see a man about to learna hard lesson.

487
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,040
tire tracks in the alley are
consistent with king's truck.

488
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,120
And several otherthousand
trucks in the miami metro area.

489
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,580
King's companytrims trees.

490
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,120
Now trimmed trees were foundin
every one of the victims' homes.

491
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,850
That's the leadthat nailed him.

492
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,600
I don't know about nailed.

493
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,580
The trees at my
placejust got trimmed too.

494
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,950
- Yeah, but mario astorga- -
we're talking about a foreman,right?

495
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:33,210
A foreman who's terrifiedof his boss.

496
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,800
You can arrest my bosson
that same evidence.

497
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:38,550
He's the fucking guy.

498
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:43,650
- Sir.
- miguel. May I?

499
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,110
We really need your helpon this one.

500
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,550
And you do owe usfor getting ramon off.

501
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,000
I do. But I can't very well charge
mr. King with assaulton a palm tree.

502
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,020
You have your ways,miguel.

503
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,820
You've bent rules before.
Getting people lostin the system.

504
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,270
We need to buy timefor anton briggs.

505
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:15,860
For you. I'll do everythingin my power.

506
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,290
We'll be right there.

507
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,420
Showtime.

508
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,110
Dex, get your kit. You too, masuka.

509
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,540
- Hey, it's called
off-duty. - Not anymore.

510
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:36,190
You two, you stay on king. Don't
let up. We got another body.

511
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,760
Anton?

512
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:42,050
A female at the cemetery.

513
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:10,110
- Cause of death?
- Take your pick.

514
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,540
Sever beating,strangulation...

515
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,550
plus three stab wounds.

516
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,060
Whoever did thiswas not a fan.

517
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,400
You have no idea.

518
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,810
Think our killer's a pro.

519
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,690
I haven't seen many
body dumpsthis clean.

520
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,860
I made sure of that.

521
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:29,800
Miguel getting caughtisn't
part of the lesson plan.

522
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,560
angel, don't let her see this.

523
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,730
no, they said it was
her. But it's not, is it?

524
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,590
Maria, I'm sorry.

525
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:42,620
No, I don't
believe-

526
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,290
- oh, my god.
- Walk with me.

527
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,120
Too many people are
affectedwhen the innocent die.

528
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,580
That is partof the lesson plan.

529
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,430
No one is untouchable. I
learned that the hard way.

530
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,910
So will miguel.

531
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,620
His own vulnerability is aboutto
become very real to him...

532
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,480
after the stage show ends.

533
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,770
- They won't find anything.
- I know.

534
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,590
So you're just makinga point.

535
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,510
Am I?

536
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:45,270
We follow the code. Or else.

537
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,290
There are a lotof other subtleties, but if
that'swhat you've gleaned, then yeah,that's my point.

538
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,300
You're a wise person,aren't you?

539
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,630
- You're being facetious.
- No, no, you have insight.

540
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,090
I'd be a foolnot to follow your lead.

541
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:21,900
I thinkyou're gonna save my life.

542
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,780
Is this real?

543
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,950
I should go make a
statementto the press.

544
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,470
I wouldn't want anyone
gettingideas about killing lawyers.

545
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,470
Lesson learned. It seems.

546
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,790
Oh, good. Good. You're here.

547
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,870
Come here. Taste this.

548
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,840
This one.

549
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:05,240
And now this one.

550
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,960
Which one?

551
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,260
I'm more in the moodfor steak.

552
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,610
No, this isfor the wedding cake.

553
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,230
We have to choose one.
Chocolate or hazelnut?

554
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,350
Is sylvia still here?

555
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:24,730
No, because of me.

556
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,670
I intervened.

557
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,160
Apparently,I'm a very wise person.

558
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,320
Apparently?

559
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,150
According to miguel.

560
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,310
He came to the open house
I was sitting for syl.

561
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,310
- Really? - We-we
talkedfor a while.

562
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:45,340
Actually, I talked. I
just-I gave himsome insight.

563
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,170
Insight.

564
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,880
He said he thinksI could...

565
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:55,050
Save his life.

566
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:57,580
Every word, bullshit.

567
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,170
When did he start lying?
With ellen? Before her?

568
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:03,360
So, chocolate?

569
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,150
What about that shirt?

570
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,120
The shirt.

571
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:12,580
Dexter, what's wrong?

572
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,730
I have to lookat some blood.

573
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,620
Evidence. For a crime.

574
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,240
Hazelnut.

575
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:44,930
Maria, why don't you
head home,get some rest?

576
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:48,530
I can'T. I have to...

577
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,410
- do something.
- Sure.

578
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,600
I'm here if you need me. Okay?

579
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,060
Tell me that we're closeon the skinner.

580
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,200
'Cause this ellen wolf
thingis about to take over.

581
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,580
Still running down tips,but
they're bullshit so far.

582
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,480
They're gonna keep beingbullshit
because no one saw king take anton.

583
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,290
What about mario astorga?

584
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,250
As tight-lippedas king.

585
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,920
Maybe I can help.

586
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,940
She could use a winright now.

587
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,810
we all could.

588
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,520
You gonna charge king?

589
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,910
Not with what you have.

590
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,580
We release him,he's in the wind.

591
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,720
Anton's dead.

592
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,930
So has king askedfor legal counsel yet?

593
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,030
King knowswe have nothing on
him. Why would he wastethe money?

594
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,130
Well, technically,if he's not represented, I
can't walk in there and offer him any deals.

595
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,840
Not on the record,anyway.

596
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:46,530
Come on. No one'll know the difference.

597
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,370
still a year from now, the recorded
document shows upon cnn, uh-uh.

598
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,350
Actually, that camera's
beenon the fritz.

599
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,720
It wouldn't surprise meif
it didn't record anything.

600
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,130
Freebo's blood.

601
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:41,270
The link between his murderand miguel.

602
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,240
If I go down,I can take miguel with me.

603
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:48,780
Mutual assurance. A symbol of trust.

604
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,340
Fuck. That's it?

605
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,560
No way we're gonna letthat monster walk.

606
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,160
Are we?

607
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,570
I hope we meet again.

608
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,590
I'd like to getto know you better.

609
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,780
But how wellcan you really know someone?

610
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:30,320
How muchdo you want to know?

611
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:07,000
There's gotta be something.

612
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,250
All we got is mario, who won't say shit.

613
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,260
I mean, we can start skinninghim
ourselves before he'd talk.

614
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,260
Morgan,we're not skinning mario.

615
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,410
I got a better idea.

616
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,560
Wanna sharewith the whole class?

617
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:26,290
No, just you. I need a partner on this.

618
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,560
Here we are. Home sweet home.

619
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,670
It's too badanton won't ever
get to do that. Thanks to you.

620
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,050
What?

621
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,750
los arboles.

622
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:58,950
Holy shit.

623
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,890
You told him I revealed things?

624
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,890
We didn't tell him shit. He knew you were
in holding. He must have thoughtyou caved.

625
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:06,720
I didn't tell anyoneanything.

626
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:09,490
Look, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to
getyour family caught up in this,all right?

627
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,160
We'll do everything we canto help you.

628
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:14,740
What can you do? Nothing.

629
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,600
You're right. We don't
even knowwhere this guy is.

630
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:25,420
You gotta help me, or I
can't doanything to help you.

631
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,520
Then that's it. I'm sorry.

632
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,840
Wait! He has a building.

633
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,950
We wentthrough all of his holdings.
There's no record of himowning any building.

634
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,060
He rents it with cash.

635
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,540
He had me go thereand pay once.

636
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:43,020
- He's trying to grow trees to sell.
- Where?

637
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,020
On 164th under the highway.

638
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:48,250
It's all I know.

639
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,690
Mi familia.

640
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,800
Go inside. Lock the door.
I'll send a patrol car. Go.

641
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:06,650
- It worked. Get in.
- Thank you.

642
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,050
Anton! Anton, are you in there?

643
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,720
Anton?

644
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,460
Fuck restraint. Here.

645
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,190
Morgan! Get out of the way.

646
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:29,970
It's me. It's okay. You're safe.

647
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,790
I need an ambulance at
the 164 and the 94 asap.

648
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,580
Get an apb outon george king.

649
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,930
You found me. You found me.

650
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,650
You can't get away from methat easily.

651
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,670
And the results are...

652
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,260
I, uh...

653
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:48,590
Come on. I'll take you home.

654
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,900
I can't go home.

655
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:57,000
There's too much silence.

656
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,590
I know.

657
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,800
You don't want to have to
thinkabout what she went through.

658
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,520
- Only to realizethat she's really gone.
- Don'T.

659
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,730
- Pero, corazon, she's gone.
- Don'T.

660
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,320
Okay?

661
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,840
And that's gonna hurt
like hell. I know that too.

662
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:30,210
But you have friends.

663
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:38,360
You got me. I'm right here.

664
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:44,930
Okay? I'm right here for
you. To get you through.

665
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:02,350
It's not freebo's blood.
It's not even human.

666
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,940
It's bovine. Cow's blood.

667
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:09,200
He's been using methe whole time.

668
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,350
I didn't create a
monster;I was used by one.

669
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:16,120
He used me.

670
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,890
Miguel!

671
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:32,530
Nine holes tomorrow?

672
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:36,330
You bet.

673
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:48,610
today I keep up the pretense.

674
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:54,540
But soon,maybe tomorrow, miguel
will knowexactly how I feel.

675
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,690
Because finally there's
anemotion I don't have to fake.

676
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,150
Today,I feel something real.
