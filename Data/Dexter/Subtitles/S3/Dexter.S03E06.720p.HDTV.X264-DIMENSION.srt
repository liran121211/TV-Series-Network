00:01:30,948 --> 00:01:37,883
Dexter, Season 3, Epsiode 6

1
00:01:40,948 --> 00:01:42,883
Previously on dexter...

2
00:01:42,917 --> 00:01:44,317
I just got off the phone with the sheriff's department.

3
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:47,020
They've confirmed their skinning victim is related to ours.

4
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:48,722
That gives us three victims.

5
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:52,058
I've got unit bringing in a 15-year-old kid named wendell owens.

6
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,560
He was freebo's doorman.

7
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:56,196
If things get really bad, you use that card and call me, okay?

8
00:01:57,264 --> 00:01:59,398
You think I cut this kid loose to make you look bad?

9
00:01:59,432 --> 00:02:01,734
I'm not sure anymore...

10
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:04,069
Partner.

11
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:05,671
You know a joey quinn?

12
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,874
Cooperation with i.a. has its upside.

13
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,910
Yuki, that's not gonna happen.

14
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:12,344
Ramon's obsessed.

15
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:15,848
He's not going to stop looking for oscar's
killer until it takes him all the way down.

17
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:18,117
- Is there a problem here? 
- Yeah, sergeant.

18
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,719
Your people don't know what the fuck they're doing.

19
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:22,254
That guy's wound way too tight.

20
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:24,657
Where you've been, dexter?

21
00:02:24,691 --> 00:02:25,991
How are you, camilla?

22
00:02:26,026 --> 00:02:28,327
Ah. I've been better.

23
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:32,031
Are you, uh, looking for anything special tonight?

24
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:33,766
Might be more than an hour.

25
00:02:36,036 --> 00:02:37,636
Take a pass...

26
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:40,239
Sergeant.

27
00:02:41,241 --> 00:02:43,275
Anton, open up. it's me.

28
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:46,045
Hi.

29
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,913
Hi.

30
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:49,648
The chicky hines conviction.

31
00:02:49,683 --> 00:02:52,751
My people have come across evidence that could get the case reopened.

32
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:54,854
Prado know you're coming to me with this?

33
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:57,189
Don't you see what happened today?

34
00:02:57,224 --> 00:03:01,768
I gave you the chance to avenge two women whom the system failed,

35
00:03:01,768 --> 00:03:05,531
And just like I hoped, you seized that opportunity.

36
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,833
I see who you are. I am with you.

37
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:10,970
Behind you.

38
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:13,105
I respect you.

39
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:25,985
He's tired. keep on reeling.

40
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:27,486
You got him.

41
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,421
Here he comes! come here!

42
00:03:29,456 --> 00:03:31,457
Come here!

43
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:32,791
Oh, yeah!

44
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:34,393
Oh, shit!

45
00:03:34,427 --> 00:03:36,896
Ah, ah.

46
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,430
Ah...ah!

47
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:40,499
Go ahead.

48
00:03:40,534 --> 00:03:42,801
That's gonna be some mighty fine eatin'.

49
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:46,172
Hey, man, on the grill with syl's mango and lime salsa.

50
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:47,940
Our house tomorrow night.

51
00:03:47,974 --> 00:03:50,943
Check with the little woman...

52
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,511
Who's getting bigger as we speak.

53
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,550
I could get used to the simple joys of male bonding.

54
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:59,552
Hey, how 'bout a... brewski?

55
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:00,486
Okay.

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,788
Ah, that looks good.

57
00:04:04,391 --> 00:04:07,159
So dex...

58
00:04:07,194 --> 00:04:09,028
Ahh.

59
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:10,930
What was it like, man?

60
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:12,464
In bimini.

61
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:17,336
Flat, mostly. lots of mangroves.

62
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,039
Talking about ethan turner.

63
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:21,340
What about him?

64
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:23,142
What did it feel like to, uh...

65
00:04:23,176 --> 00:04:25,978
Take him out, hmm?

66
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:27,413
To end his life.

67
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,052
So much for the simple joys of male bonding.

68
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:37,289
Like I could explain or miguel could understand.

69
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:39,091
You put people on death row.

70
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:40,860
You must know what it's like.

71
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:41,153
Oh, no,

72
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:43,527
But there's like an ocean of bureaucracy of briefs and

73
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:46,165
Appeals between me and that bad guy taking his last breath.

74
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,069
I'm asking you what did it feel like to use your hands, to...

75
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,738
To make this a better place?

76
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:58,110
It felt...right.

77
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,147
Felt like justice.

78
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:06,940
I've got, like,

79
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,290
Five floors of prosecutors and the whole police

80
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,191
Department at my fingertips, and you did what I couldn't.

81
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:14,293
You came through for me, dex.

82
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:17,596
I been sleepin' like a baby ever since.

83
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:23,769
It was hot today, huh?

84
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:27,573
Like I said the other night, I know you, dexter.

85
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,542
I see who you are.

86
00:05:29,576 --> 00:05:32,545
We're like-minded. hmm?

87
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:35,714
Together, we can make a difference.

88
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,151
We?

89
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:43,055
Miguel, my amigo, claims to know me.

90
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,491
On some level, I suppose maybe that's true.

91
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:47,560
Who are you kidding?

92
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:51,130
He knows about freebo.

93
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:55,668
He detailed me to the ethan turner kill.

94
00:05:58,738 --> 00:06:01,473
He's seen me with blood on my hands and hasn't blinked.

95
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:05,077
Miguel's got no clue what's really going on inside you.

96
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,979
The urge, the ritual.

97
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:12,117
Miguel has really gone out of his way to understand who I am...

98
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:15,120
Which is more than you ever did.

99
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,089
Well, I understood.

100
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:19,124
I just couldn't accept it.

101
00:06:21,027 --> 00:06:22,695
And miguel won't either.

102
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:25,764
You didn't want me to have any friends.

103
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:28,067
You think miguel's a pal?

104
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:30,102
Your wingman?

105
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,139
You might wanna put that notion to the test...

106
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:36,909
See how like-minded you and miguel really are.

107
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:45,518
Every time you let someone get close, it ends badly.

108
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:54,927
I do need to consider my spotty record connecting with others.

109
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,996
But miguel's not going away.

110
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:59,798
I need to make him understand the risks.

111
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:04,336
When he does, he'll wanna rethink the like-minded thing.

112
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:05,878
Just because he can gut a fish

113
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:08,240
Doesn't qualify him to hang with me while i...

114
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:10,476
Do what I do best.

115
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,556
You need a jump? I have cables.

116
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,294
Skinner struck again.

117
00:07:28,328 --> 00:07:30,262
Super-hard this time.

118
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,764
The victim's name was wendell owen.

119
00:07:31,798 --> 00:07:32,965
He was 15 years old.

120
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:36,735
It's more collateral damage in our search for fucking freebo.

121
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,771
Wendell owens?

122
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,907
I brought him in for questioning the other day.

123
00:07:41,942 --> 00:07:44,710
I thought I remembered hearing his name somewhere.

124
00:07:44,744 --> 00:07:46,626
He might have been mixed up with some lowlifes,

125
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:48,180
But wendell was a pretty decent kid.

126
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:54,253
Go do your thing. I just need a minute.

127
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,198
Body's still warm.

128
00:08:06,266 --> 00:08:08,234
Putting time of death about three hours ago.

129
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:09,793
Unlike the two previous victims,

130
00:08:09,793 --> 00:08:12,204
This one died from the skinning process itself.

131
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:14,406
Jesus christ.

132
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:17,810
Freebo's probably in another galaxy, and the skinner doesn't even know it.

133
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,778
Meanwhile, he's stepping up his game.

134
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:22,508
Maybe we let the press know freebo got outta dodge,

135
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:25,117
Might get this guy to put down his ginzu knife.

136
00:08:25,151 --> 00:08:28,311
Or he'll keep looking, take his horror show on the road,

137
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:30,322
Become somebody else's nightmare.

138
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:33,259
No, I wanna nail whoever's doing this.

139
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:35,027
He's definitely not learning to do this on the fly.

140
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:36,195
He's had plenty of practice.

141
00:08:36,263 --> 00:08:40,557
You run this through the national database, see if a similar m.o.

142
00:08:40,557 --> 00:08:42,234
Comes up anywhere else.

143
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:53,189
What I need to find right now is a target to present

144
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:57,516
To miguel with a high degree of difficulty and jeopardy.

145
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:03,189
So that he truly understands that he's in way over his head.

146
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:06,525
Dex.

147
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,894
I have a question.

148
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,162
It's serious.

149
00:09:10,197 --> 00:09:12,331
I can't ask any of the other cops.

150
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:13,833
I'm all yours.

151
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:15,534
It's about the skinner.

152
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:17,436
His last two victims,

153
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,904
Wendell and javier,

154
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:22,675
They were both killed after I was done questioning them.

155
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:24,376
Do you think the skinner's

156
00:09:24,411 --> 00:09:26,879
Drafting off my investigation?

157
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:31,383
I don't know. anything's possible.

158
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:32,751
Because I'm freaking out

159
00:09:32,786 --> 00:09:34,286
That whoever's looking for freebo

160
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,821
Is using me to attract him.

161
00:09:35,856 --> 00:09:37,389
Who else knows you brought wendell in?

162
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:40,125
His mom, um...

163
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,527
All the cops in the station.

164
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:45,664
Anton. ramon prado.

165
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:48,300
Miguel's brother.

166
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,805
The law and order hard ass sheriff

167
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,807
Who's been obsessed about finding freebo

168
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:56,242
For killing his little brother.

169
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,644
There's your motive.

170
00:09:58,678 --> 00:10:01,714
Do we seriously think that ramon, a fellow cop,

171
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:03,782
Could do something this sick?

172
00:10:03,817 --> 00:10:05,618
Like a career in law enforcement

173
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:07,753
Precludes violent behavior?

174
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:09,655
Can you imagine the shit storm this is gonna create

175
00:10:09,689 --> 00:10:10,956
If I'm wrong?

176
00:10:10,991 --> 00:10:13,592
It'll create a worse shit storm if you're right.

177
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,731
Hey, keep me in the loop.

178
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:20,599
Yeah.

179
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:24,603
Ramon's got anger issues. I don't want you getting hurt.

180
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:28,107
Aw. you do care about me.

181
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:32,011
Wait till you see the wine cellar at the forge.

182
00:10:32,045 --> 00:10:33,779
It is legendary!

183
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:35,114
They even have a bottle

184
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:38,651
Of chateau d'yquem... belonged to thomas jefferson.

185
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:41,353
I'm kind of a cuba libre kinda girl myself.

186
00:10:43,223 --> 00:10:45,724
Ellen, it's me. nicely done.

187
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,327
Handing miguel prado his head on a pike today--

188
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:50,863
Make the hines motion stick, he could be disbarred.

189
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,598
Bravissimo.

190
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:56,368
I was gonna talk to you about this,

191
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:58,504
If and when my motion's upheld.

192
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,641
How 'bout we talk about it now?

193
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:04,577
Okay.

194
00:11:04,611 --> 00:11:07,980
Miguel's been playing fast and loose for a long time

195
00:11:08,048 --> 00:11:09,381
With legal ethics.

196
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:12,518
The chicky hines case is just one example

197
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,454
On a very long list of prosecutorial misconduct.

198
00:11:15,488 --> 00:11:18,457
I came to you with information to help your client,

199
00:11:18,491 --> 00:11:21,060
Not for you to trump up some witch hunt

200
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:23,996
Against my friend and colleague.

201
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,733
You can't possibly believe he's either of those things

202
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,401
If you really knew miguel...

203
00:11:29,436 --> 00:11:31,437
Believe me, I know miguel.

204
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:33,873
I will explain everything over dinner.

205
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:35,608
No, thanks.

206
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,745
I'm not feeling especially social right now.

207
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:53,526
Hey.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

208
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,262
No, I'm alone. come on in.

209
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:58,931
Taking the night off?

210
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:07,806
So, um...beer?

211
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,008
Sure.

212
00:12:09,042 --> 00:12:10,342
Pot?

213
00:12:10,377 --> 00:12:12,378
Fuck you.

214
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,185
Sounded kind of upset on the phone.

215
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:21,854
I'm kind of upset in person too.

216
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:28,594
You didn't talk to anyone

217
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:31,964
About me bringing wendell in for questioning?

218
00:12:32,032 --> 00:12:35,100
No. I don't talk to anybody about anything.

219
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:38,204
I try to keep the whole c.i. thing under wraps, you know?

220
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:40,372
Then how the hell did it get out?

221
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:44,443
Well, it's a pretty safe bet wendell didn't tell anybody.

222
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,782
You should have seen what this sicko did to him.

223
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:51,951
I'm glad I didn't.

224
00:12:51,985 --> 00:12:54,019
What would make anyone go that hard

225
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:56,222
On some street kid, for christ's sakes?

226
00:12:56,256 --> 00:12:58,490
There's this guy I'm lookin' at...

227
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:00,492
He's a cop who had a beef with freebo.

228
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,630
He saw me in the station when I was questioning wendell.

229
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:06,966
Wouldn't be the first time the boys in blue

230
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,437
Handled their own business, right?

231
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:15,541
I can't rule out that I put wendell in the crosshairs.

232
00:13:15,575 --> 00:13:19,278
He trusted me enough to cooperate, and...

233
00:13:21,448 --> 00:13:23,382
Look what happened to him.

234
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:33,225
Hey, look...

235
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,561
Even if you're right,

236
00:13:35,595 --> 00:13:38,264
You couldn't have known, right?

237
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:42,635
Don't beat yourself up.

238
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,041
It's what I do best, huh?

239
00:13:59,853 --> 00:14:02,221
I should go.

240
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,089
All right.

241
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:09,061
Hey, um...

242
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:11,530
Hey, look, um...

243
00:14:11,565 --> 00:14:14,500
That girl from the other night was...

244
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,268
Was nothing serious.

245
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:20,906
Uh, well...it's none of my business anyway.

246
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:22,474
Yeah, right.

246
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:26,474
Right.

247
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:28,147
Jenna kendrick.

248
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,717
One of the first crime scenes I worked blood spatter.

249
00:14:34,254 --> 00:14:35,955
This is somebody's daughter.

250
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:41,026
And that was done to her by this animal.

251
00:14:41,061 --> 00:14:42,261
Clemson galt.

252
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,163
Aryan affiliated.

253
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:47,166
Took a claw hammer to her for getting pregnant.

254
00:14:47,234 --> 00:14:49,335
He was arrested for murder,

255
00:14:49,369 --> 00:14:50,703
Even confessed to his cellmate.

256
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,104
He called it "hammer time."

257
00:14:52,172 --> 00:14:53,472
They get a conviction?

258
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:57,209
Galt's aryan affiliates either got witnesses to recant

259
00:14:57,277 --> 00:14:58,477
Or made them disappear.

260
00:14:58,512 --> 00:15:00,479
Verdict came back not guilty.

261
00:15:00,514 --> 00:15:03,249
That--that type of stuff happens way too often man.

262
00:15:03,283 --> 00:15:06,018
Galt's doing 15 to 20 for armed robbery

263
00:15:06,052 --> 00:15:07,419
In a supermax upstate.

264
00:15:07,454 --> 00:15:08,854
Well, that's something, at least.

265
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:10,222
Getting him off the streets.

266
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:12,525
Only he's still running things from his prison cell.

267
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,394
The wife and three kids of an aryan defector,

268
00:15:15,428 --> 00:15:17,229
Killed with a claw hammer.

269
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,533
While you're sleeping like a baby,

270
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,936
This is who's keeping me up nights.

271
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,973
Justice comes at a price,

272
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:31,443
One that miguel is about to discover he can't afford.

273
00:15:31,478 --> 00:15:34,079
This asshole doesn't deserve to breathe, okay?

274
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:37,016
You're not gonna get any argument with me about that.

275
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,385
But he's in custody.

276
00:15:39,452 --> 00:15:41,120
In a supermax, no less.

277
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:43,322
That's always been the problem.

278
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,627
You're the big deal law enforcement guy.

279
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:49,995
I bet you could get us access.

280
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:52,498
That--that's beyond dangerous, dexter.

281
00:15:52,532 --> 00:15:53,699
That's crazy!

282
00:15:53,733 --> 00:15:55,334
I knew if I appealed to reason,

283
00:15:55,368 --> 00:15:58,737
Miguel would eventually understand the downside.

284
00:15:58,772 --> 00:16:00,306
Ne-never mind that my fingerprints

285
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,974
Will be all over this!

286
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:05,044
Reason leads to self-preservation,

287
00:16:05,078 --> 00:16:07,379
A potent force.

288
00:16:07,414 --> 00:16:10,583
We both would be seriously exposed here.

289
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:14,787
I just need to sit back.

290
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:18,023
He'll see the pros are heavily outweighed by the cons,

291
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:20,659
And we'll be back to mojitos and barbecues.

292
00:16:23,463 --> 00:16:24,964
Yeah, when you get right down to it,

293
00:16:24,998 --> 00:16:27,733
I guess ethan turner was an accident of opportunity,

294
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,702
A once-in-a-lifetime thing.

295
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:32,238
What about freebo?

296
00:16:32,272 --> 00:16:35,007
Another accident of opportunity?

297
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:38,911
Well, that situation just sort of...unfolded.

298
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:41,580
You're right.

299
00:16:41,615 --> 00:16:45,317
We both have too much to lose.

300
00:16:45,352 --> 00:16:48,420
Hey, we took out the garbage...twice.

301
00:16:48,455 --> 00:16:50,523
We should quit while we're ahead.

302
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:52,224
No.

303
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,529
I owe you this one, dexter.

304
00:16:56,563 --> 00:16:58,764
You stuck your neck out for me twice now.

305
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:00,299
- No, you don't owe me--  
- Fair is fair.

306
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,268
And I won't let you down.

307
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:08,374
But we need to come up with a real plan.

308
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:11,177
Again...we.

309
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:14,613
Miguel surprised me last night.

310
00:17:14,648 --> 00:17:18,050
I expected him to say no and he gave me a definite maybe instead.

311
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:20,186
Hey, 
no doughnuts today?

312
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,388
Not today, vince.

313
00:17:22,422 --> 00:17:24,623
Talk about your passive aggressive.

314
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:27,451
Clemson galt has been on my top ten list for years,

315
00:17:27,451 --> 00:17:29,295
And miguel could be a big help.

316
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:31,764
But the goal here isn't to satisfy my need.

317
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:34,500
It's to get miguel to find some other hobby.

318
00:17:34,534 --> 00:17:37,069
Dexter. got a minute?

319
00:17:38,438 --> 00:17:40,406
Who's sick?

320
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,674
Uh, remember camilla from records?

321
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,209
She's in the hospital.

322
00:17:43,243 --> 00:17:45,778
It's not looking good, so I got everyone to sign.

323
00:17:45,846 --> 00:17:47,680
Camilla's sick?

324
00:17:47,714 --> 00:17:48,881
Sorry, I thought you knew.

325
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:51,817
Lung cancer. it's terminal.

326
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:53,485
Just like gene.

327
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,287
Camilla's husband.

328
00:17:55,322 --> 00:17:58,891
My folks used to play cards with them when deb and I were growing up.

329
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:01,427
He died just last year. lung cancer too.

330
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:02,628
Smokers?

331
00:18:02,662 --> 00:18:03,762
Ah, chimneys.

332
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:06,532
Life catches up.

333
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:08,300
Yeah.

334
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:10,402
So does death.

335
00:18:10,437 --> 00:18:12,571
It's a shame. she's a good person.

336
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:14,273
It sounds like she was a friend.

337
00:18:16,176 --> 00:18:18,143
A good friend.

338
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,281
Those are in short supply these days.

339
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:23,883
Camilla's at good samaritan.

340
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,152
You could drop that off, let her know she's in our prayers.

341
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:28,754
I'll do that.

342
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:30,122
Thanks.

343
00:18:30,156 --> 00:18:33,659
Detective gianna, sergeant batista, miami-metro homicide.

344
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,728
How can I help you, sergeant?

345
00:18:35,762 --> 00:18:39,064
I was, uh, wondering, detective...

346
00:18:39,099 --> 00:18:42,067
Maybe we could...

347
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:44,003
See each other.

348
00:18:44,037 --> 00:18:47,072
As--as in a...a date?

349
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:48,974
Well, yeah.

350
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:50,543
You could call it that.

351
00:18:50,577 --> 00:18:53,913
Look, um, sergeant, let--let's be clear.

352
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:57,883
'cause being clear will save us both a lot of agita.

353
00:18:57,918 --> 00:18:59,351
Hey!

354
00:18:59,386 --> 00:19:01,720
I, uh...

355
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:04,590
I don't date. ever.

356
00:19:04,624 --> 00:19:07,893
Do you eat...ever?

357
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:10,296
Sometimes.

358
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,165
Good nutrition's important.

359
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:16,202
I'll tell you what, sergeant.

360
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:19,305
I get hungry enough, I will call you.

361
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:29,515
Angel?

362
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:33,352
What?

363
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:36,188
Can I throw something at you that might sound a little crazy?

364
00:19:36,223 --> 00:19:38,257
Crazy? from you?

365
00:19:40,493 --> 00:19:42,094
- Ramon prado.  
- What about him?

366
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:43,829
Do we like him for the skinner?

367
00:19:48,935 --> 00:19:51,003
Okay, that's not a little crazy.

368
00:19:51,037 --> 00:19:52,347
He has access to all of our records,

369
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:54,106
So he knows exactly who I've been talking to.

370
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,709
And we've all seen him up close-- this is not a stable guy.

371
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:57,977
He's a fucking whack job.

372
00:19:58,011 --> 00:19:59,678
I looked into his work schedule.

373
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:03,182
He was off duty when the last two murders went down.

374
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,952
You seriously wanna look at ramon prado for multiple homicide?

375
00:20:06,987 --> 00:20:08,954
If only to rule him out.

376
00:20:08,989 --> 00:20:12,015
Not only have we not found the perp that killed miguel prado's

377
00:20:12,015 --> 00:20:15,528
Little brother, now you wanna investigate his other brother for murder?

378
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:17,963
In a nutshell.

379
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:20,866
Can't ignore something just 'cause it's messy.

380
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,335
If I'm right, this is huge.

381
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,321
And if you're wrong,

382
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:26,066
Everyone involved will be shitting 

383
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:28,274
Blood due to acts I'd rather not describe.

384
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:29,508
Thanks for that, sarge.

385
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:32,845
I've got a gut feeling.

386
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:35,714
You, uh, wanna go to the lieutenant with this?

387
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:37,683
I can't go to laguerta with this.

388
00:20:41,121 --> 00:20:42,087
You follow up...

389
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:44,924
Off the grid, and it's on you.

390
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,091
Thank you, sarge.

391
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:47,793
Ramon's off duty tonight and tomorrow.

392
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,862
I'll set up on him, I'll see what shakes loose.

393
00:20:49,896 --> 00:20:51,263
If you need company...

394
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:52,631
I've got it covered.

395
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,067
And try to be discreet, will you?

396
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:56,969
For a change?

397
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,237
Yeah.

398
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:30,569
Dexter.

399
00:21:32,339 --> 00:21:33,506
You came.

400
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,107
I also brought you these.

401
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:37,510
But it looks like somebody beat me to it.

402
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:44,884
That new mom in maternity donated them to terminal care.

403
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,255
Talk about irony, huh?

404
00:21:55,428 --> 00:22:03,936
You know, dexter, my whole life I've been searching for...

405
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,072
The meaning of life?

406
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:10,042
The perfect...

407
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:14,480
Key lime pie.

408
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:17,049
And what do I get when I'm about to croak?

409
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:23,322
Fucking pie crust, reddi wip, and green jell-o.

410
00:22:23,356 --> 00:22:26,859
I'll see what I can do about finding you the perfect key lime pie.

411
00:22:26,893 --> 00:22:29,161
You better do it fast.

412
00:22:30,764 --> 00:22:32,932
Next thing to go is the appetite.

413
00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:47,513
Gene always had this thing about lighting my cigarette.

414
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:50,883
And he'd pass it to me...

415
00:22:52,219 --> 00:22:54,420
Before he lit his own.

416
00:22:57,524 --> 00:22:59,592
Sweet, sweet man.

417
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,603
Then it all caught up to him.

418
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:13,806
I watched him wither to a skeleton.

419
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:21,847
My 6' tall, 200-pound husband, shitting all over himself.

420
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:27,553
His last breath was a mercy.

421
00:23:37,964 --> 00:23:41,167
Dying I can do.

422
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:43,369
Hell, I'm doing it.

423
00:23:43,403 --> 00:23:47,072
The pain sure is a bear, though.

424
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,741
How bad?

425
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:51,443
The worst part of the whole damn thing...

426
00:23:51,478 --> 00:23:54,647
Not losing my life...

427
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,416
My time on this earth...

428
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:01,187
Is losing my...my...

429
00:24:04,891 --> 00:24:07,393
Dignity.

430
00:24:24,277 --> 00:24:26,178
That fish was great.

431
00:24:26,246 --> 00:24:28,347
You don't think miguel overcooked it?

432
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:31,817
A bit, but the mango salsa saved the day.

433
00:24:31,852 --> 00:24:33,686
Thank you.

434
00:24:33,753 --> 00:24:35,888
So do you like what you do?

435
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:37,389
I mean, real estate.

436
00:24:37,424 --> 00:24:39,792
I can't imagine doing anything else.

437
00:24:42,276 --> 00:24:44,201
I decided that losing my job at the 

438
00:24:44,201 --> 00:24:46,565
Motel is not a bad thing but a good thing.

439
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,635
So I'm looking around.

440
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:53,472
Well, with your people skills, you'd be great at real estate.

441
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,808
You think?

442
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:59,278
How 'bout you start work tomorrow?

443
00:25:01,114 --> 00:25:02,915
I'm...i'm sorry, what?

444
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:05,618
I need an assistant.

445
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:09,355
Having someone I can trust is everything.

446
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:13,325
Salud.

447
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:25,337
Listen, I've been giving a lot of thought to this clemson galt thing.

448
00:25:25,372 --> 00:25:27,072
Good.

449
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,574
Digame.

450
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:34,280
What if we were to travel upstate and arrange an interview with him?

451
00:25:34,314 --> 00:25:36,248
About?

452
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:38,952
A career criminal with a record like his,

453
00:25:38,952 --> 00:25:43,222
He's gotta be an encyclopedia of intel on tons of other cases.

454
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,412
We would just need to get galt alone long enough

455
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:49,795
To make it look like another prisoner did the deed.

456
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:50,433
Last week,

457
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:55,134
An inmate is found in a prison hallway drowned in a bucket of water.

458
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:58,838
This stuff happens all day long in places like that.

459
00:26:00,674 --> 00:26:03,245
An inmate is found dead in custody, dexter,

460
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,878
Be a lot of inquiries and investigations.

461
00:26:05,912 --> 00:26:07,979
You got the bleeding hearts comin' outta

462
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:10,149
The woodwork whining about prison reform.

463
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:12,785
Ha. it doesn't sound like much of a plan.

464
00:26:16,423 --> 00:26:17,923
That is the plan...

465
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:20,860
So that miguel finally includes himself out.

466
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:22,428
But, um...

467
00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:26,999
I'm in the middle of trying a racketeering case right now.

468
00:26:27,033 --> 00:26:28,567
Money laundering.

469
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:31,770
The aryans, they're masters at moving cash around.

470
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:36,548
I subpoena galt as an expert witness,

471
00:26:36,548 --> 00:26:40,679
Corrections transports him down here to testify.

472
00:26:40,714 --> 00:26:43,682
Then galt is within our reach, hmm?

473
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,019
And on my turf.

474
00:26:47,053 --> 00:26:50,589
Guessing it would take a long time to set something like that up.

475
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:54,593
It would.

476
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:56,729
But I've already issued the subpoena.

477
00:26:56,763 --> 00:26:59,632
Galt'll be here tomorrow night.

478
00:26:59,666 --> 00:27:04,236
Only...he's gonna be a no-show on the witness stand the next morning.

479
00:27:04,304 --> 00:27:09,975
Swing by the courthouse tomorrow, I'll walk you through all the details.

480
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:15,714
Can't you say thank you, dexter.

481
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:18,516
Miguel seems to have way more aptitude

482
00:27:18,516 --> 00:27:21,720
And appetite for this than I ever imagined.

483
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:33,632
Just calling to check in.

484
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,768
Just having a look-see in ramon prado's car.

485
00:27:35,802 --> 00:27:37,870
- Deb, you really need to-- 
- relax.

486
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:39,624
He's scarfing down his second plate of

487
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,707
Arroz con pollo at a restaurant up the block.

488
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:44,735
He's got a wife and kids at home, got the night off,

489
00:27:44,735 --> 00:27:46,378
So why is he eating alone?

490
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:50,683
Well, maybe the wife's arroz con pollo isn't pollo enough.

491
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,419
You find anything interesting?

492
00:27:53,453 --> 00:27:56,305
A set of german steel filet knives, a couple of straight razors,

493
00:27:56,305 --> 00:27:57,890
And like 12 pounds of human skin.

494
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:00,292
Just be careful out there, will you?

495
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,027
Yes, sir.

496
00:28:04,497 --> 00:28:06,165
Deb's got her mission.

497
00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:08,434
I've got mine.

498
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,244
Hey, I can get out and give you a great,

499
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:32,858
Big hug so everyone can see what good friends we are...

500
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:34,994
Or you can talk to me.

501
00:28:35,028 --> 00:28:38,323
You know, after 12 hours on surveillance detail,

502
00:28:38,323 --> 00:28:40,566
How 'bout you blow me instead?

503
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,476
I've been given the directive to either

504
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:44,737
Step up my investigation of quinn or close it.

505
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:46,772
Because you haven't found dick.

506
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:48,013
If you weren't such a fuckwad,

507
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:50,176
I'd almost feel sorry for you for working for i.a.

508
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,944
Where careers go to die.

509
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:54,680
You need to get next to quinn, be his go-to girl.

510
00:28:54,714 --> 00:28:56,615
You'll be wearing a wire.

511
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:00,119
Are you on crack?

512
00:29:00,153 --> 00:29:01,687
How many times have I told you to eat shit?

513
00:29:01,755 --> 00:29:04,523
What the fuck makes you think I'm suddenly willing to play now?

514
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:05,836
Because if you don't,

515
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:09,862
I'll put the word out that you've been cooperating all along.

516
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:12,464
Everyone'll think you're a rat anyway.

517
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:17,436
Hard to believe even you would sink that low.

518
00:29:26,146 --> 00:29:28,547
So that door right over there? hmm.

519
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:29,915
Check this out.

520
00:29:29,983 --> 00:29:33,686
That's supposed to be kept locked, and it never is.

521
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,655
The smokers use it as a shortcut to get outside.

522
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,091
Shortcut to a shorter life.

523
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:42,695
You know, statistically, most escapes happen out of a courthouse.

524
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:44,771
The security's a little bit more lax,

525
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:47,266
The defendant is wearing a suit and a tie.

526
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:49,702
It makes it easy for him to just walk away.

527
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:52,238
Easier for us to cover our tracks.

528
00:29:52,272 --> 00:29:53,739
That too.

528
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:58,739
[Talking in a foreign language]

529
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:02,348
We're good.
- Must be good to be you.

530
00:30:02,382 --> 00:30:04,083
Sometimes.

531
00:30:17,764 --> 00:30:21,158
Real reason she's blindfolded-- so she doesn't have to watch

532
00:30:21,158 --> 00:30:25,004
Everything she stands for get pissed on by someone like ellen wolf.

533
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:25,501
You know,

534
00:30:25,501 --> 00:30:27,627
She had this client once who threw a

535
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:31,110
Five-year-old into an industrial washer for talking dirty.

536
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:33,579
She got him off with six months in a mental hospital.

537
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:34,980
Diminished fucking capacity.

538
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:36,148
Hey.

539
00:30:38,451 --> 00:30:40,986
She probably got paid more that than you took home in a year.

540
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:44,590
And I gotta tell you, I'm very disappointed with your boss over there.

541
00:30:44,624 --> 00:30:46,541
I never thought that she, of all people,

542
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:50,129
Would hurt me like this and throw in with these fucking bottom-feeders.

543
00:30:50,163 --> 00:30:53,532
My dad used to say be careful what you think you know about someone.

544
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,701
You're probably wrong.

545
00:30:57,737 --> 00:30:59,371
Smart man.

546
00:31:00,373 --> 00:31:02,908
Well, sometimes.

547
00:31:02,943 --> 00:31:03,742
Maria!

548
00:31:05,612 --> 00:31:09,248
I appreciate your, um, cooperation in the deposition.

549
00:31:10,684 --> 00:31:13,152
I've never had a problem telling the truth.

550
00:31:13,186 --> 00:31:17,723
We've got, uh, more than enough to get the hines conviction set aside.

551
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:21,560
And you've set the stage for your smear campaign against a stand-up guy.

552
00:31:21,595 --> 00:31:23,629
Nice.

553
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:27,265
You know, you ever wanna hear the unexpurgated version of your guy,

554
00:31:27,265 --> 00:31:28,400
Come find me, okay?

555
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,113
Looks like a church.

556
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:42,448
Yeah.

557
00:31:44,918 --> 00:31:46,819
The holding cell is through that door.

558
00:31:48,555 --> 00:31:51,357
Connects to a hallway, then goes out to a parking garage.

559
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:54,793
On your right, there's gonna be an emergency exit.

560
00:31:54,861 --> 00:31:56,996
And that deadbolt is gonna be taped...

561
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:59,198
Open.

562
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:02,001
Why risk it all?

563
00:32:02,035 --> 00:32:05,471
Your career, reputation, freedom.

564
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:07,373
You could just walk away.

565
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:10,376
You didn't walk away from ethan turner.

566
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:15,648
Because you understand, dexter, that we're living in...

567
00:32:15,682 --> 00:32:17,448
We're living in crucial times,

568
00:32:17,448 --> 00:32:20,553
Crucial times that demand extraordinary measures.

569
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:24,593
Miguel's convinced himself he wants this

570
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:27,293
Kill tonight for lofty and noble reasons.

571
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,794
I'm not quite as high-minded.

572
00:32:28,862 --> 00:32:31,030
You didn't answer my question.

573
00:32:31,064 --> 00:32:33,199
Asshole drunk dad...

574
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:35,266
Maybe I'm still trying to clean up the mess

575
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:37,536
That I couldn't when I was a kid, I don't know.

576
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:43,475
Come on, I'll, uh, show you where you're gonna be hooking up with galt.

577
00:32:50,984 --> 00:32:53,219
Morgan, what's the hurry?

578
00:32:53,253 --> 00:32:54,753
You meeting someone?

579
00:32:54,788 --> 00:32:56,322
More like avoiding someone.

580
00:32:56,356 --> 00:32:59,792
Hey, this is me not telling you I'm tailing ramon prado again tonight.

581
00:32:59,826 --> 00:33:02,761
Well, this is me not hearing a word you're saying.

582
00:33:02,796 --> 00:33:05,004
I'm also unofficially and off the record

583
00:33:05,004 --> 00:33:07,433
Telling you to be smart and watch your ass.

584
00:33:07,501 --> 00:33:09,969
'scuse me, officer.

585
00:33:10,003 --> 00:33:12,004
Sergeant. how can I help you?

586
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:17,109
I was just, uh, released for this legal thing.

587
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:18,077
You were arrested.

588
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:21,146
And released. totally victimless.

589
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:24,118
Only I live like a million miles away from here,

590
00:33:24,181 --> 00:33:26,118
and I really need a ride.

591
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:28,988
How 'bout the bus?

592
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:31,836
How 'bout you take me home and I think 

593
00:33:31,836 --> 00:33:35,094
Of some victimless way of saying thank you?

594
00:33:44,771 --> 00:33:47,606
I'll have dispatch call you a cab.

595
00:33:47,641 --> 00:33:49,808
Just like that?

596
00:33:49,843 --> 00:33:51,210
Just like that.

597
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:10,863
Agent batista.

598
00:34:10,897 --> 00:34:13,999
Sergeant, barbara gianna here.

599
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:19,103
So happens, uh...I'm hungry.

600
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:23,008
Hungry enough to-- to see if you are too.

601
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:25,110
Are you asking me out on a date, detective?

602
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:28,981
I don't date, sergeant. ever.

603
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:31,417
Marino's trattoria, 7:30?

604
00:34:31,484 --> 00:34:34,854
Aren't you gonna ask me if I really turned over a new leaf?

605
00:34:34,921 --> 00:34:37,957
It could be I'm just not partial to redheads.

606
00:34:38,024 --> 00:34:41,126
I have no idea what you're talking about, detective.

607
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:43,262
I'll see you at 7:30.

608
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:51,670
Delivered fresh daily from a little bakery down in key largo.

609
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,907
Supposed to be the best in the keys.

610
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:56,509
Well, it's not.

611
00:34:56,543 --> 00:34:58,811
Pardon my bluntness, but...

612
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,279
This pie is green.

613
00:35:00,313 --> 00:35:02,948
Means they used food coloring.

614
00:35:03,016 --> 00:35:05,784
Something purists frown on?

615
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:09,288
Which I'd be doing right now, except even my face hurts.

616
00:35:09,322 --> 00:35:14,894
The other thing they fucked up-- this wasn't made with condensed milk.

617
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:17,663
No, it's fresh and organic.

618
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:23,035
Only they didn't have fresh milk in the keys back in the day.

619
00:35:25,872 --> 00:35:29,408
Here comes miss morphy.

620
00:35:29,442 --> 00:35:32,178
Bringer of bad dreams and less pain.

621
00:35:32,245 --> 00:35:34,813
Dexter...

622
00:35:34,848 --> 00:35:39,852
If you're as serious about key lime pie as I am...

623
00:35:43,256 --> 00:35:45,691
You can do better.

624
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:52,965
Tonight's the night. but it feels different.

625
00:35:52,999 --> 00:35:54,500
I won't be alone.

626
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:58,904
Uncharted territory for me... not without risk.

627
00:35:58,939 --> 00:36:00,940
And strangely exhilarating.

628
00:36:00,974 --> 00:36:02,508
So what do you think?

629
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:06,111
Best pizza night ever.

630
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:10,282
No, I meant about syl's job offer.

631
00:36:10,317 --> 00:36:13,191
If real estate's something you're interested in,

632
00:36:13,191 --> 00:36:15,087
I think you should go for it.

633
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:17,022
And syl's great at what she does.

634
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,558
In a market this bad, she's still always closing.

635
00:36:19,593 --> 00:36:22,728
And I could learn a lot. I just...

636
00:36:22,762 --> 00:36:23,762
But...

637
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,568
Well, what if i...

638
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:31,270
See a side to her that I don't like?

639
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:33,591
I guess that's the risk you run 

640
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:35,591
when you go into business with somebody,

641
00:36:35,591 --> 00:36:36,909
Especially a friend.

642
00:36:36,943 --> 00:36:40,613
Makes things more complicated, no doubt about it.

643
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,581
Still...

644
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:46,085
Without my friend syl, I wouldn't have this opportunity.

645
00:36:46,152 --> 00:36:49,820
So I think I'm gonna take the risk and jump in 

646
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,126
With both feet and see if this new thing calls to me.

647
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,366
It's getting late.

648
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,101
You don't wanna stay?

649
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:05,504
Miguel and I have a... early morning run.

650
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:08,107
I can sleep in longer if I stay at my place.

651
00:37:08,175 --> 00:37:11,277
Don't be surprised if he's a no-show.

652
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:13,379
What makes you say that?

653
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:16,482
He's been a complete wreck lately.

654
00:37:16,516 --> 00:37:17,950
Not sleeping, terrible mood.

655
00:37:17,984 --> 00:37:21,387
I mean, syl thinks something's really bothering him.

656
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:23,088
I saw him today. he seemed fine.

657
00:37:23,123 --> 00:37:25,624
Well, you may be his buddy, but you're not his wife.

658
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:30,229
And besides, it's not like you can hide anything from your partner.

659
00:37:30,297 --> 00:37:32,198
So true.

660
00:37:32,265 --> 00:37:34,567
Why would you want to?

661
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:41,974
Looks like miguel's got a bad case of nerves about tonight.

662
00:37:42,008 --> 00:37:44,009
He isn't sleeping like a baby anymore.

663
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:48,047
If you're gonna bail of of this, now would be a good time.

664
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:51,383
What the hell are you dressed like that for?

665
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:53,052
I figured the more the merrier.

666
00:37:53,086 --> 00:37:57,423
Why don't we swing by and pick up rita and the kids?

667
00:37:59,192 --> 00:38:01,760
Bring them along too.

668
00:38:03,296 --> 00:38:06,398
What makes you think you can count on miguel?

669
00:38:06,466 --> 00:38:08,934
He's just a little jumpy. he's new at this.

670
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:10,705
Mark my words, dex,

671
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,705
he'll give you up in a heartbeat to save his own ass.

672
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:17,142
This is not a guy who wants to spend the rest of his life in a cage.

673
00:38:17,177 --> 00:38:20,446
Just one more thing miguel and I have in common.

674
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,481
You don't know what you're getting into.

675
00:38:22,549 --> 00:38:25,818
You've never had to rely on anyone else before, dexter.

676
00:38:25,852 --> 00:38:29,555
Because you taught me loneliness as an art form.

677
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:31,724
But guess what?

678
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:36,395
I finally have a life with a family and now a friend...

679
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:39,565
Who I trust.

680
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:42,134
We only see two things in people...

681
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:45,838
What we wanna see and what they wanna show us.

682
00:38:45,872 --> 00:38:48,207
You don't know miguel any more than he knows you.

683
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:50,527
You aren't seriously gonna lecture me on 

684
00:38:50,527 --> 00:38:53,612
Relationships after the debris field you left behind.

685
00:38:56,183 --> 00:39:01,253
No matter how close two people are, an infinite distance separates them.

686
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:05,157
Look at you and me.

687
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:15,835
Mind if I get a picture with you, jefe?

688
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:17,303
You got a cam--oh.

689
00:39:17,337 --> 00:39:18,871
Oh, yeah.

690
00:39:21,208 --> 00:39:22,775
No problema.

691
00:39:28,348 --> 00:39:30,316
Gracias.

692
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:33,285
Any truth you're gonna run for d.a.?

693
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,622
Uh...if I do, I'm gonna need your support.

694
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:38,424
You got it, jefe.

695
00:39:43,363 --> 00:39:44,997
Thanks, officer.

696
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:57,476
You listen to me, pulled pork.

697
00:39:57,511 --> 00:40:01,051
I got no clue why the fuck you dragged me down here in all this humiliation,

698
00:40:01,051 --> 00:40:02,564
But you can suck my white dick,

699
00:40:02,564 --> 00:40:04,984
You think I'm helping your spic ass with shit.

700
00:40:08,722 --> 00:40:12,391
This all ends right here, right now, clemson.

701
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:15,995
This makes us even.

702
00:40:26,706 --> 00:40:28,059
When you walk out the door,

703
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:31,443
One of your nazi pals is waiting for you in the parking garage.

704
00:40:31,478 --> 00:40:37,850
From now on, all of the threats to my family, they stop, understand?

705
00:40:48,862 --> 00:40:51,597
I knew my aryan brothers would come through, ese.

706
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:08,681
Thanks.

707
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:11,273
Have any arrangements been made in case this guy's 

708
00:41:11,273 --> 00:41:14,220
Testimony runs a little long and he has to stay another day?

709
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:17,056
We're holding a spot for him in protective at miami-dade.

710
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,824
My good man. appreciate it.

711
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,032
I got a witness in there, man, he's taking a nap.

712
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,935
I'm gonna really need him fresh for court in a couple of hours.

713
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:31,370
I gotta put a county wristband on him.

714
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,918
Just take a second.

715
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:49,922
Clem galt, I'm your wheel man.

716
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:51,690
Welcome home.

717
00:41:51,725 --> 00:41:55,194
Heil hitler.

718
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:57,196
Let's get the fuck outta here. 
- ride's this way.

719
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,431
Have ya outta the country by lunchtime.

720
00:41:59,499 --> 00:42:00,733
Fuck!

721
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,168
Shit! what's going on here?

722
00:42:02,202 --> 00:42:03,769
I don't know. come on.

723
00:42:09,009 --> 00:42:10,176
I'll get ya outta here.

724
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,544
We just gotta get to the car.

725
00:42:11,611 --> 00:42:13,245
Galt had to have an accomplice.

726
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:16,015
Just set up a perimeter around this building right away.

727
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:16,982
No one should get in or out.

728
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:18,984
Fuckin' spic set us up.

729
00:42:19,019 --> 00:42:20,719
This guy cannot get away!

730
00:42:20,754 --> 00:42:22,054
And I'm gonna return the favor.

731
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,423
That's mighty white of you.

732
00:42:31,731 --> 00:42:33,599
Galt's right. he's selling you out.

733
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:38,737
Never underestimate the capacity of other people to let you down.

734
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:40,539
It's not the time, dad.

735
00:42:45,078 --> 00:42:46,612
There he goes.

736
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,014
Looking out for number one.

737
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:51,717
Which is what you should have done.

738
00:42:57,557 --> 00:43:01,527
Like the man said, nobody gets in or out.

739
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:08,968
Might as well give up.

740
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:10,769
No sense risking death by cop.

741
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:12,433
You keep miguel's involvement secret,

742
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:14,206
He might let you off with a few years.

743
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:15,341
Stop.

744
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:18,177
Unless they find those blood slides when they toss your apartment.

745
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:19,745
Stop!

746
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:23,616
Hola, amigo.

747
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:43,335
I'm gonna drop you off at your car.

748
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,406
Then I'll meet you at the stash house as soon as I can get outta here.

749
00:43:49,509 --> 00:43:51,243
- Wait for me, huh?  
- Thanks for this.

750
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:53,412
That's what friends are for.

751
00:43:55,615 --> 00:43:55,755
Hey,

752
00:43:55,755 --> 00:43:59,115
I'm gonna do a loop around the building until you get more backup here,

753
00:43:59,115 --> 00:43:59,451
Okay?

754
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:00,486
You got it, jefe.

755
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,568
Gimme a fucking break, ramon.

756
00:44:17,704 --> 00:44:19,905
Don't fucking lie to me

757
00:44:39,726 --> 00:44:42,394
You can make this stop right now...

758
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,863
If you tell me where he is.

759
00:44:43,897 --> 00:44:46,131
I don't know.

760
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:51,804
You're making this very hard on yourself, felipe.

761
00:44:58,812 --> 00:44:59,845
Whoa!

762
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,680
You scared the fuckmother out of me.

763
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:03,282
You're the one that called me.

764
00:45:03,316 --> 00:45:04,650
What do we got?

765
00:45:05,685 --> 00:45:07,286
Kidnapping, for starters.

766
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,154
Who's the special guest?

767
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:10,923
That's felipe cepeda.

768
00:45:10,957 --> 00:45:12,424
He's one of freebo's hemp suppliers.

769
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:13,993
I questioned him a couple of weeks ago.

770
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:17,062
Now ramon's got a few questions of his own for him.

771
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:20,132
Well, so far, I've only heard one---where's freebo?

772
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,468
I'm just waiting for the skinning to start.

773
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,171
Oye.

774
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:26,972
Tell me where he is.

775
00:45:27,007 --> 00:45:28,140
I don't know!

776
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:29,708
Okay.

777
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,645
Okay.

778
00:45:37,117 --> 00:45:39,885
Nothing like a nice cold soda pop before a good skinning.

779
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:46,225
Aah!

780
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:47,760
Fuck, that's gotta hurt.

781
00:45:47,794 --> 00:45:49,461
- Wait, wait.  
- Wait?

782
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,397
We need to be sure he's the skinner.

783
00:45:57,904 --> 00:45:58,804
Felipe...

784
00:46:00,907 --> 00:46:02,708
You have some answers for me now?

785
00:46:08,014 --> 00:46:09,281
I don't get it. I don't get it.

786
00:46:09,316 --> 00:46:10,883
That's not the skinner's m.o.

787
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:12,184
Maybe he's just warming up.

788
00:46:18,592 --> 00:46:20,292
Here he goes...

789
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:30,736
Vete.

790
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:37,376
He's not the skinner.

791
00:46:59,533 --> 00:47:02,101
Alright, I gotta take this. don't go anywhere.

792
00:47:02,135 --> 00:47:04,270
Hello.

793
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:06,097
So ramon prado's a sick fuck,

794
00:47:06,097 --> 00:47:09,108
But he's not the sick fuck we're looking for.

795
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:11,143
I'll talk to you about it over breakfast.

796
00:47:11,178 --> 00:47:12,878
I gotta go.

797
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:13,879
What's up?

798
00:47:16,249 --> 00:47:20,052
So, why are you calling us in at midnight?

799
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:21,720
We've picked up ramon prado.

800
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:24,056
He's, uh...outside.

801
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:26,759
We got a uni watching him to keep his mouth shut.

802
00:47:28,895 --> 00:47:30,496
For what?

803
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,331
Kidnapping.

804
00:47:32,365 --> 00:47:33,432
False imprisonment.

805
00:47:33,466 --> 00:47:36,001
And torture.

806
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:44,043
Are you sure?

807
00:47:44,077 --> 00:47:46,478
We witnessed it ourselves.

808
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:51,984
- My god, i--  
- We can't give him a pass on this.

809
00:47:52,018 --> 00:47:54,787
I...shit.

810
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:56,922
No, we can't.

811
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,596
Thank you for being politic at least.

812
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,932
I woulda perp-walked him right through here.

813
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:12,238
Morgan insisted we be discreet out of respect for his family.

814
00:48:16,076 --> 00:48:18,410
Were you aware of this investigation?

815
00:48:18,445 --> 00:48:20,279
Yes, I was.

816
00:48:20,313 --> 00:48:21,647
And you didn't inform me?

817
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:25,217
I wanted something solid before involving you.

818
00:48:27,087 --> 00:48:28,754
Thank you for that.

819
00:48:28,788 --> 00:48:33,292
Morgan, you handled a tough situation the smart way.

820
00:48:33,326 --> 00:48:35,694
How do you wanna do this?

821
00:48:35,729 --> 00:48:37,830
Book him.

822
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:40,866
I'll notify the family.

823
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,376
That went well.

824
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,388
Internal affairs is investigating you.

825
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:05,324
What?

826
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:08,360
They've been giving me a sandpaper enema to wear a fucking wire.

827
00:49:08,395 --> 00:49:10,262
- This has been goin' on for a while.  
- Yes.

828
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:12,698
- And you're finally telling me.  
- I'm finally telling you.

829
00:49:12,732 --> 00:49:15,017
Do you wanna tell me why this i.a. chick

830
00:49:15,017 --> 00:49:17,303
is so gung ho to bring you down?

831
00:49:17,337 --> 00:49:21,273
Wait. does this i.a. chick go by the name of yuki amado?

832
00:49:21,308 --> 00:49:23,843
As a matter of fact, yes.

833
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,912
You wanna tell me what's going on?

834
00:49:26,947 --> 00:49:31,150
Yeah. yuki and I have a...history.

835
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:33,752
It's a totally personal vendetta on her part.

836
00:49:35,388 --> 00:49:37,389
I'll handle it.

837
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:38,991
I appreciate the heads up, though.

838
00:49:53,906 --> 00:49:54,936
Even in prison,

839
00:49:54,936 --> 00:49:57,710
I'm sure you heard about the big slump in the real estate market.

840
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:03,349
What the fuck...

841
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,753
Shit!

842
00:50:07,787 --> 00:50:10,856
There is an upside to the downturn, though.

843
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:13,692
Plenty of empty houses.

844
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,999
Do you recognize this one?

845
00:50:20,033 --> 00:50:22,334
It's where you killed jenna kendrick.

846
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:24,870
I got no idea what the hell you're talking about.

847
00:50:24,905 --> 00:50:28,474
I'm talking about hammer time, clemson.

848
00:50:30,076 --> 00:50:31,944
No.

849
00:50:31,978 --> 00:50:34,747
You got me mixed up with somebody else.

850
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,826
You can't imagine how much I've been looking forward to this.

851
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:56,338
And none of it would be happening if it weren't for my...

852
00:50:56,338 --> 00:50:58,604
Friend miguel prado.

853
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,206
You remember him?

854
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,274
He really came through tonight.

855
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,944
In a big way.

856
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,983
I never had a partner before.

857
00:51:11,017 --> 00:51:14,987
I had my doubts initially, but everything worked out.

858
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:19,325
But this part, the ritual...

859
00:51:19,392 --> 00:51:22,228
The connection and certainty...

860
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:26,699
Followed by that pristine silence...

861
00:51:26,766 --> 00:51:29,535
Is for me.

862
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,574
And me alone.

863
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,792
Miguel will be disappointed.

864
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:58,731
I'll explain to him I took galt straight to the cemetery

865
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:02,468
And dumped him in a grave after the screw-up at the courthouse.

866
00:52:02,502 --> 00:52:03,014
Truth is,

867
00:52:03,014 --> 00:52:07,306
I'm not ready to share this part of me with anyone else just yet.

868
00:52:09,309 --> 00:52:11,710
Present company excepted.

869
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,648
I'm not sure I ever will be ready.

870
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:24,304
Even if miguel senses my deception,

871
00:52:24,304 --> 00:52:27,660
He'll forgive me this one small untruth.

872
00:52:27,694 --> 00:52:29,061
Dexter.

873
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:36,168
How can I be so sure?

874
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:43,639
Because after tonight,

875
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:49,515
I can honestly say I know who miguel prado really is...

876
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:53,819
My first good friend.

877
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:57,056
And those are in short supply these days.
