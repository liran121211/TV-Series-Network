1
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:46,711
Previously on Dexter.

2
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,079
I'm pregnant.

3
00:01:48,114 --> 00:01:49,347
I just think I'm gonna be a lousy father.

4
00:01:49,382 --> 00:01:50,348
I don't wanna screw the kid up.

5
00:01:50,383 --> 00:01:51,516
Who are we kidding?

6
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,717
You're gonna be a great father.

7
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:54,753
What do you have on Freebo, Maria? 
- Ramon.

8
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,222
Well, we're working on some new angles.

9
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:58,356
Which means you've got shit.

10
00:01:58,391 --> 00:01:59,891
He's obsessed.

11
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:01,493
He's drinking more than usual.

12
00:02:01,527 --> 00:02:05,230
He's not going to stop looking for oscar's killer
Until they takes him all the way down.

14
00:02:05,264 --> 00:02:07,532
I only have one person I can trust anymore.

15
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
Yourself.

16
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:10,201
I was thinking of you.

17
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:11,536
What you need?

18
00:02:11,604 --> 00:02:12,904
I need Freebo.

19
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,006
Come on, man, what did you google him or something?

20
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:18,643
Well, why wouldn't they want to support
A valuable colleague during his shining moment?

22
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:22,380
You're, like, the foulest person I've ever met.

23
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:23,481
I'm gonna do you a favor.

24
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:26,685
Call this guy.
Tell him you want to cash in one of my coupons.

26
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,020
He's an informant from my days in narcotics.

27
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:32,524
You, uh, you looking for anything special tonight?

28
00:02:32,558 --> 00:02:34,793
Might be more than an hour.

29
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:40,832
Take a pass, sergeant.

30
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:43,868
I hate anyone who disgraces the badge.

31
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:44,936
Are we good?

32
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:47,706
You keep your dick in your pants,
And then we're good.

34
00:02:47,773 --> 00:02:49,608
Rita, we're connected.

35
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:50,575
I feel you.

36
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,044
You're what makes me real.

37
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:54,913
And that's how I know I want to marry you.

38
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:56,348
Yes.

39
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:58,149
Yes, we will marry you.

40
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:13,698
There are many ways to stop the heart.

41
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:15,033
Electric shock.

42
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,534
Bad diet.

43
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,069
Sever the aorta--

44
00:03:18,137 --> 00:03:19,704
My personal favorite.

45
00:03:19,772 --> 00:03:22,007
But to start one beating,

46
00:03:22,074 --> 00:03:23,942
This is a first.

47
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:24,910
There.

48
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,778
That's the heart.

49
00:03:26,812 --> 00:03:30,115
Oh, Dex, that's our baby.

50
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:33,251
Our baby. it's incredible.

51
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:36,354
Rita, gushing with the runaway emotion

52
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,391
Any parent would feel seeing their unborn child For the first time.

54
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,761
Any parent except me.

55
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:45,630
I'd say you're at nine to ten weeks.

56
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:49,067
All I feel is her hand clenching mine.

57
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:53,338
She's stronger than she looks.

58
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:56,241
Can we get a picture to show the kids?

59
00:03:58,309 --> 00:04:00,078
I can no longer deny that I'm going to be a father.

60
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:03,081
Up until now, I've been avoiding its inevitability.

61
00:04:03,115 --> 00:04:06,484
It's like a lamp in a room that's always been there.

62
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:08,819
And now it's suddenly turned on.

63
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:10,522
Don't worry.

64
00:04:11,356 --> 00:04:13,191
Everything looks perfectly normal.

65
00:04:18,497 --> 00:04:19,798
Yes.

66
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:23,701
Front or back pocket?

67
00:04:25,336 --> 00:04:26,637
You lost me.

68
00:04:26,671 --> 00:04:28,305
The picture of the baby.

69
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,840
Front or back pocket?

70
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:31,375
How'd you know I'd have it with me?

71
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:33,677
You're a first time dad, 
Aren't you?

73
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:39,984
Oh, this is amazing.

74
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,485
This is a human life.

75
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,556
It is overwhelming.

76
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,360
This picture right here makes it real.

77
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,695
Your life is gonna change forever, man.

78
00:04:56,101 --> 00:04:57,268
We're playing here!

79
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:59,236
You could kill somebody!

80
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,208
Sorry.

81
00:05:04,242 --> 00:05:06,443
I got half my mind still in the office, you know?

82
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,414
Oh, there's your ball.

83
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:13,017
So I got this case, you know?

84
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:17,187
South beach guy kills his wife on a cruise ship.

86
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:21,258
And I got no jurisdiction because she goes missing in international waters.

88
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:23,093
My only hope right now is the feds.

89
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:24,628
How do you know he's guilty?

90
00:05:24,663 --> 00:05:25,529
Oh, he's guilty.

91
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,900
Five years ago, he kills his first wife.

92
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,635
Drug overdose.

93
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,804
His pills. no alibi.

94
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:37,408
Then he uses her money to go and hire this legal dream team to confuse the jury and

96
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:39,410
They had to let him go.

97
00:05:39,444 --> 00:05:42,212
Dexter, my hands are tied by the law,

98
00:05:42,247 --> 00:05:45,015
And the defense attorneys get to wipe their asses with it.

100
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,217
And everything that I believe in is compromised.

101
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:49,253
That's you.

102
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:55,159
Seems Miguel and I understand each other better
than either one of us knows.

104
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:58,729
I could do us both a favor and look into this wife killer.

106
00:05:58,763 --> 00:06:04,201
When it comes to my brand of justice,
I don't have to compromise.

108
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,039
Sliced it.

109
00:06:09,074 --> 00:06:11,475
Yeah.

110
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:15,479
Thank you again for inviting us.

111
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:18,349
That massage was amazing.

112
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,217
We spend enough money to be members here.

113
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:22,486
At least now I have somebody to go to the spa with.

114
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,789
All of that stuff, 
That's not for men, right, Dex?

116
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:30,694
Lying naked on a table, helpless,
No thanks.

118
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,531
So, Rita, why don't you tell Dexter My great idea?

120
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,133
Great idea?

121
00:06:36,167 --> 00:06:43,540
Well, Syl has offered to list my house with her agency
so we can buy something bigger together.

124
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:47,378
You're just throwing money away on that apartment.

126
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:50,080
And that way you can move in sooner.

128
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:53,083
I was actually thinking I might keep my place.

129
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:55,185
You were?

130
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,154
Well, I could always sublet it.

131
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:02,493
At some point we're gonna need a bigger home.

132
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:05,963
You definitely need something that you can grow into.

134
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:08,132
This is how customer must have felt,

135
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,967
Surrounded on all sides,

136
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:11,368
Doomed.

137
00:07:11,403 --> 00:07:14,039
So why don't we talk about all this after we eat?

139
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,211
Oh, the line's thinning.

140
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:21,079
Come on, Rita.

141
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,514
You have got to try these crepes.

142
00:07:26,285 --> 00:07:27,886
It's going to be okay.

143
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:30,055
Trust me.

144
00:07:32,058 --> 00:07:33,625
I'm so sorry, man.

145
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:37,228
Syl, she gets these ideas in her head,
And it's like you can't stop her.

147
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:41,108
I guess I always knew at some point
I'd have to give up my place.

149
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:43,368
I just didn't think it would be so soon.

150
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:46,004
Every man needs his privacy.

151
00:07:46,072 --> 00:07:48,473
Some more than others.

152
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:51,009
But that's why god created golf.

153
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:59,918
How many times have I walked down this sidewalk?

154
00:07:59,952 --> 00:08:01,786
Sun in my face.

155
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:04,356
Cool ocean breeze on my skin.

156
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:07,292
Taken a dip in the pool to relax,

157
00:08:07,326 --> 00:08:10,795
Appreciating the wisdom of the three little words

158
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,099
No children allowed.

159
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:16,701
Are those times gone forever?

160
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,078
Before I even think About following up on Miguel's lead,
I need to make sure Ethan Turner meets my code.

163
00:08:36,487 --> 00:08:39,491
How can Rita expect me to just pick up and move?

164
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,293
This is my home.

165
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:45,397
My sanctuary.

166
00:08:54,574 --> 00:08:57,409
Careful.

167
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:58,677
Leave it.

168
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:04,416
Not really Rita's style.

169
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:06,451
But it's mine.

170
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,686
Not anymore, son.

171
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,655
In marriage, everything's 50/50.

172
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:15,392
What's yours is Rita's.

174
00:09:25,104 --> 00:09:28,273
Better hope she doesn't insist on a place with central air.

175
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:50,295
Rita and Syl may be busy planning my life and where I'll live.

177
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:53,365
But there are some things I still control.

178
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:58,303
Right on time.

179
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:00,672
You're getting pretty good at this secret meeting stuff.

180
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,307
Yeah, well, we've done it enough.

181
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:04,376
With bumpkus to show for it.

182
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,611
It's "bupkus."

183
00:10:06,646 --> 00:10:08,613
Not "bumpkus." it's yiddish.

184
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:10,081
No, it's not.

185
00:10:10,116 --> 00:10:11,516
You wanna bet?

186
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,351
How much?

187
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:14,853
Make it a million.

188
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:17,055
I'll take a check.

189
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,959
Where's your guy?

190
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,428
In the alley behind you.

191
00:10:25,498 --> 00:10:28,066
Wonderful.

192
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,268
I love the smell of ass in the morning.

193
00:10:30,303 --> 00:10:32,404
Hey, you're the one that's been all over mine for leads.

194
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:34,372
Don't be hating where I find them.

195
00:10:34,407 --> 00:10:36,074
I know, I know.

196
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:42,581
Well, you better split before we get made.

197
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:44,115
Well, that's cute.

198
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,850
What?

199
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:47,052
You.

200
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:48,553
Trying to protect me like that, it's cute.

201
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:52,090
I'm trying to protect my investigation.

202
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,561
Aha!

202
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,561
And fuck you.

203
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:05,437
What the hell?

204
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:07,272
He wasn't like this earlier.

205
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,443
I'm trying to find whoever's responsible for skinning people,
not to stage an intervention.

207
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,411
You think your murders are somehow connected to Freebo?

208
00:11:13,446 --> 00:11:15,113
He used to score from Freebo.

209
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:16,915
It's worth a shot, right?

210
00:11:22,922 --> 00:11:24,356
Excuse me.

211
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,693
Anyone in there?

212
00:11:28,728 --> 00:11:30,629
Anyone fucking in there at all?

213
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:32,363
I'll bet you're real good with kids too.

214
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,171
Hey, Tilly.

215
00:11:41,206 --> 00:11:43,873
Hey, I got that "h" for you, man.

216
00:11:45,111 --> 00:11:46,778
Where? it's right here.

217
00:11:46,812 --> 00:11:50,849
But listen, I need you to think real hard for me first, Tilly.

218
00:11:50,883 --> 00:11:53,284
Now when was the last time you saw Freebo?

219
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:57,455
Fucker's gone, man.

220
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,324
Wendell said

221
00:12:00,859 --> 00:12:01,992
He's not coming back.

222
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,163
Who the fuck is Wendell?

223
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:09,334
You wanna see Freebo, you gotta go through Wendell.

225
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:16,374
Sheriff 21, this is dispatch.

226
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,076
Wagon is on the way.

227
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,813
Metro homicide.

228
00:12:23,447 --> 00:12:25,116
What are we doing here at a sheriff's crime scene anyway?

230
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,351
Excuse me, sheriff, you're blocking my light.

231
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:27,886
Whoa, jesus. 
- Excuse me.

232
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,490
Sheriffs are responding to a bulletin I issued
regarding any victims with missing skin.

235
00:12:32,525 --> 00:12:33,792
Excuse me.

236
00:12:36,295 --> 00:12:37,829
Same M.O. as our torture murder?

237
00:12:37,863 --> 00:12:39,531
Now remember, you two are just here to observe.

238
00:12:39,565 --> 00:12:41,666
This is the sheriff's turf.

239
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:45,670
They're gonna investigate the scene,
see what they can come up with.

241
00:12:45,705 --> 00:12:47,806
What's up with him?

242
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,507
He doesn't joke around anymore.

243
00:12:49,542 --> 00:12:51,042
He dresses better. he's polite.

244
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,812
Maybe someone pointed out the error in his ways.

245
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:56,480
Who called this in? neighbors.

246
00:13:03,288 --> 00:13:05,222
I just got off the phone with the sheriff's department.

247
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,125
They've confirmed their skinning victim is related to ours.

249
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,860
That gives us three victims.

250
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,895
They're sending someone over to look at our case files.

251
00:13:11,963 --> 00:13:14,598
And we'll be establishing a joint investigation.

252
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,033
This is our investigation, lieutenant.

253
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:18,769
You can't expect us to just give over our files.

254
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:20,137
No one is giving over anything.

255
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,839
It's a matter of professional courtesy.

256
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,007
We're still in charge.

257
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:27,544
Now, I've had the sheriff's lab send over all forensics.

259
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:28,779
I want both your input.

260
00:13:28,847 --> 00:13:30,014
My slate's clear.

261
00:13:30,048 --> 00:13:31,749
I'll talk with the medical examiner.

262
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:34,251
Another four-hour erection?

263
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:38,455
Anything else?

264
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:42,393
I've got unis bringing in a 15-year-old kid named Wendell Owens.

266
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:46,030
He was Freebo's doorman, which means he might be able
To connect the dots between his boss,

268
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:48,032
And why people who knew him keep winding up dead.

269
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:50,367
I may be one of those dots.

270
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:51,669
He's a minor.

271
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:53,537
Get consent from a parent to question him.

272
00:13:53,572 --> 00:13:55,806
I'll make sure everything's done by the book.

273
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,908
All right, I want updates on the hour.

274
00:13:59,878 --> 00:14:00,911
Good work, partner.

275
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:02,179
Yeah, right.

276
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,759
Wendell.

277
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:18,696
I doubt this boy would recognize me
from the day I met his dead boss.

279
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:21,032
But why take the chance?

280
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,200
Dexter Morgan.

281
00:14:22,235 --> 00:14:23,635
Hey, Dex.

282
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:26,938
Listen, I'm gonna have to cancel our lunch.

283
00:14:26,973 --> 00:14:28,773
Everything all right?

284
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:30,342
Rough morning, man.

285
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:34,679
Feds just informed me that they're not
gonna move forward on this cruise ship case.

287
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:36,147
Lack of evidence.

288
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:41,586
Got a witness puts this son of a bitch on the deck
With his wife just before she went missing,

291
00:14:41,621 --> 00:14:42,954
And he's still gonna walk.

292
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,656
Again!

293
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,059
Did I mention he left his first wife's teenage daughters penniless?

295
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:49,661
No need.

296
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:51,830
A whole family destroyed.

297
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:53,531
We could meet later if you want.

298
00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:55,400
No, no, I'm gonna be in court, man.

299
00:14:55,468 --> 00:14:56,601
How about tomorrow?

300
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,436
I may have plans. I'll let you know.

301
00:14:58,504 --> 00:15:01,072
There's due diligence to be done.

302
00:15:07,513 --> 00:15:09,981
How long is this gonna take?

303
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:14,085
The sooner you tell me where we can find your mom,
The sooner you're outta here.

305
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,789
She wasn't at your house.

306
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:19,958
We can't reach her by phone.

307
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:22,160
Does she have a job?

308
00:15:22,194 --> 00:15:23,895
She does what she has to do.

309
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,396
Same as me.

310
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,808
You know, I was about your age when my mom died.

311
00:15:37,642 --> 00:15:40,677
Suddenly, my father's raising two teenagers, by himself,

312
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:44,949
So I get how hard it is for a single parent to always be there.

314
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:48,486
Yeah, I bet you had it real bad.

315
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:51,122
No, I didn't.

316
00:15:51,157 --> 00:15:55,460
My dad worked really hard to get me and my brother the things he didn't have.

318
00:15:55,528 --> 00:15:58,663
So I got why he wasn't always home.

319
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:03,435
But after a while, I even stopped looking for him at my softball games.

321
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:06,204
Didn't mean he didn't love me,

322
00:16:06,272 --> 00:16:09,441
But didn't mean it didn't hurt.

323
00:16:09,475 --> 00:16:12,510
You played softball for real?

324
00:16:13,344 --> 00:16:14,345
First base.

325
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,615
But you don't look gay.

326
00:16:23,656 --> 00:16:25,156
You hungry?

327
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:27,859
Yeah, but not for any of that vending machine shit.

328
00:16:27,927 --> 00:16:32,998
Well, I'll tell you what, If you're brave enough, there's a roach coach outside.

330
00:16:33,032 --> 00:16:34,432
I'm buying.

331
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:43,875
Okay, I'll take some burgers, fries, and onion rings.

333
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,977
Deal.

334
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,381
Partner, would you keep an eye on our guest?

335
00:17:06,499 --> 00:17:07,699
Getting anywhere with the kid?

336
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:08,900
Sorta.

337
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:11,268
You and rita set a date yet?

338
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:12,103
Not yet.

339
00:17:12,103 --> 00:17:13,672
Well, are you gonna move in with her first?

340
00:17:13,706 --> 00:17:15,240
Where's this going?

341
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,643
Well, I kinda need to know, so I can break the lease
on my place and move into yours.

343
00:17:18,643 --> 00:17:21,580
What makes everybody think I'm just gonna give up my apartment?

345
00:17:21,614 --> 00:17:24,448
I don't know, maybe 'cause you're getting married.

346
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:26,517
Like there's room for rita and the kids at your place.

347
00:17:26,552 --> 00:17:30,521
No offense, but you're the last person who needs a fuck pad.

349
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,293
Dexter. 
Officer Morgan.

350
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:38,529
Can you tell me where I might find lieutenant Laguerta?

351
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:41,800
Thank you so much.

352
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:45,869
Guess we know who the sheriff's department sent to look into our files.

354
00:17:45,904 --> 00:17:46,904
Big fucking mistake.

355
00:17:46,938 --> 00:17:48,339
That guy's wound way too tight.

356
00:17:48,373 --> 00:17:49,941
And coming from me, that's saying something.

357
00:17:49,975 --> 00:17:52,244
You gonna take the fridge?

358
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:55,614
Thank you.

359
00:17:56,181 --> 00:17:58,182
They keep getting younger and younger, huh?

360
00:17:58,217 --> 00:18:00,251
- Who did this one kill?  
- The boy's not a suspect.

361
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,886
We think he was working for Freebo.

362
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,088
I have to say,

363
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:07,759
I'm a little surprised you're who the sheriff's department chose as their liaison.

365
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:09,093
I'm not here to make friends.

366
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:10,461
I'm here to do my job.

367
00:18:13,265 --> 00:18:18,403
I've known you your entire adult life, ramon, so let's cut the bullshit.

369
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:23,207
You're using this case to insert yourself into miami metro's investigation
Of your brother's death.

372
00:18:23,242 --> 00:18:29,247
If our victim can help track down
my brother's killer in the process, so be it.

375
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:33,818
As one lieutenant to another,
You know I could go over your head and get you pulled off this assignment.

378
00:18:35,921 --> 00:18:37,522
But I'm not gonna do that.

379
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:39,690
I know you and oscar were close.

380
00:18:39,758 --> 00:18:41,492
And he meant a great deal to me as well.

381
00:18:41,527 --> 00:18:48,666
So you will have this department's full cooperation to a point.

384
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,370
If it turns out that these cases are not connected,
the cooperation ends.

386
00:18:52,404 --> 00:18:53,571
Entiendes?

387
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:56,507
Claro.

388
00:19:03,148 --> 00:19:07,518
I need to thank Miguel for introducing me to a new hobby.

390
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:09,620
And for supporting an old one.

391
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,396
After the first wife's money ran out,

392
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:25,002
Ethan didn't take long to find the next wealthy woman to woo, 
marry, and throw overboard.

395
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,705
Maybe I can return the favor on that last part.

396
00:19:30,676 --> 00:19:32,977
Have both tanks delivered to the ship.

397
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:35,046
I'll need a dive skin too.

398
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,982
You got it.

399
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:39,984
Heading out to sea?

400
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:42,053
Caribbean cruise.

401
00:19:42,087 --> 00:19:43,387
Leaving tomorrow.

402
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:45,757
Do you know any good dive schools around here?

403
00:19:45,824 --> 00:19:47,692
Yeah.

404
00:19:47,726 --> 00:19:50,094
But they all require hours for certification.

405
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:53,364
You know if I were you,
I'd cut a few corners, head over to Bimini.

407
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:55,400
They'll have you under the water in less than a day.

408
00:19:55,434 --> 00:19:57,268
Bimini. that's close.

409
00:19:57,302 --> 00:19:59,303
I could be there and back in my boat.

410
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:00,805
The water's beautiful there.

411
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:02,840
It's my first port of call.

412
00:20:02,908 --> 00:20:08,279
Maybe I could take the wife, finally get her off my back
for never doing anything with her.

414
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:12,183
You'll have more fun if you don't.

415
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:20,591
I'm sure I will.

416
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:22,627
There you are.

417
00:20:22,862 --> 00:20:23,362
Good news.

418
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:26,263
Wendell's mother finally answered her phone.

419
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:28,632
Patrol's bringing her upstairs now.

420
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:30,400
Yes. Thank the baby fucking jesus.

421
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:32,602
You do know I'm catholic, right?

422
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:35,738
I'm sorry, but I've had that kid at my desk all afternoon.

424
00:20:35,773 --> 00:20:37,907
Hey, you ever hear the word "bumpkus"?

425
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:39,509
I think it's "bupkus."

426
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:41,244
-Shit.  -Yeah, hold on now.

427
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:45,548
There's this cold case I'm looking at, 
A dead John.

429
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:51,387
Now when you were working vice,
Did you bust the same places over and over again?

431
00:20:51,422 --> 00:20:53,556
Um, not really.

432
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:57,093
Most guys are regulars, so word gets out quick if a place is hot.

434
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:58,828
So we'd move the decoys around.

435
00:20:58,862 --> 00:21:03,566
But if you really want to know about paying for sex,
you should talk to Masuka.

437
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:05,301
Hey, vince, hold up.

438
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:10,540
Did you get a chance to look at
the sheriff's department forensics regarding their vic?

441
00:21:10,574 --> 00:21:12,575
I fucking would, if they'd fucking send them.

442
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,877
I've called four fucking times.

443
00:21:13,944 --> 00:21:16,279
Man, somebody needs a hug.

444
00:21:16,313 --> 00:21:18,848
I'd offer, but I don't know what I'd catch.

445
00:21:20,483 --> 00:21:21,184
Can I go now?

446
00:21:21,252 --> 00:21:24,153
You know, I can take inappropriate Masuka.

448
00:21:24,153 --> 00:21:25,955
I can take porn-loving Masuka.

449
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,457
I can even take flatulent Masuka.

450
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:32,762
But this dress shoe-wearing,
"please and thank you" zombie Masuka is fucking creeping me out.

453
00:21:32,796 --> 00:21:34,898
What's going on?

454
00:21:34,965 --> 00:21:37,800
Maybe I'm realizing no one around here is my friend.

455
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:41,437
The only time you people even acknowledge me
is when you want something.

457
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:42,972
That's not so.

458
00:21:43,007 --> 00:21:44,908
We put you on our bowling team.

459
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:48,444
Only because you wanted to keep everyone's handicap higher
to sandbag the other teams.

461
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:53,182
Okay, that's true, but not one person read my paper.

463
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:56,953
Not one fucking person showed up at the conference I spoke at.

465
00:21:59,021 --> 00:21:59,755
This is about your stupid paper?

466
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:02,455
You guys just don't get it.

467
00:22:06,263 --> 00:22:08,765
You hurt my feelings.

468
00:22:22,913 --> 00:22:24,214
What the fuck?

469
00:22:26,984 --> 00:22:28,952
Where's the kid?

470
00:22:28,986 --> 00:22:30,520
The mother wouldn't give consent.

471
00:22:30,554 --> 00:22:31,788
I had to cut him loose.

472
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:36,292
Did you explain to her how important it was that we talk to him? 

474
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,094
The moment I brought up Freebo's name, she clammed up.

475
00:22:38,162 --> 00:22:41,798
Word on the street is the last person
who talked to the cops about freebo wound up dead.

477
00:22:41,832 --> 00:22:44,968
I spent all day getting through to that kid.

479
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:47,937
He would have talked, or he would have
convinced his mother to let him talk.

481
00:22:47,972 --> 00:22:49,539
She was never gonna cooperate.

482
00:22:49,607 --> 00:22:52,408
You could have waited until I got back.

483
00:22:52,476 --> 00:22:55,011
Look, this is no reflection on the work you did here.

484
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:59,048
No, it's a reflection on how little you think of me and my work.

486
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,651
You think I cut this kid loose to make you look bad?

488
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:05,722
I'm not sure anymore.

489
00:23:05,756 --> 00:23:07,557
Partner.

490
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
Hey, baby.

491
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:18,501
You want a date?

492
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:33,950
Hey, sugar. 
What you look-- you have got to be kidding me.

494
00:23:34,018 --> 00:23:36,819
I'm not here for that, honest.

495
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:38,087
Your--

496
00:23:38,122 --> 00:23:39,789
You know, your--

497
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:43,059
You're blushing.

498
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:44,928
I'm not.

499
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:47,096
So what, uh, what are you doing down here, sergeant?

500
00:23:47,164 --> 00:23:50,333
'cause I gotta get back to work.

501
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:52,902
I came here because I--

502
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,371
I wanted to know if--

503
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:58,841
If you'd like to grab something to eat sometime.

504
00:23:58,876 --> 00:24:01,878
You know, to talk.

505
00:24:01,912 --> 00:24:04,948
And to eat.

506
00:24:07,585 --> 00:24:09,452
I'm not interested.

507
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:11,721
I rarely date cops.

508
00:24:11,755 --> 00:24:16,359
"rarely," does that mean "never"?

509
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:19,195
If I meant "never," I would have said "never."

510
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:26,302
Dex, is that you?

511
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,304
I'm in the kitchen.

512
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:31,040
What smells so good?

513
00:24:31,075 --> 00:24:33,676
It's a surprise.

514
00:24:37,147 --> 00:24:39,782
Look, brochures of houses.

515
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:43,453
I know it's fast.

516
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:44,520
But Syl and I spent

517
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:48,458
The whole day doing drive-bys,
and these are the ones I fell in love with.

519
00:24:48,525 --> 00:24:49,859
All of them?

520
00:24:49,927 --> 00:24:55,098
Well, they're in great school districts,
big yards, plenty of bedrooms, central air.

523
00:24:55,132 --> 00:25:00,370
I thought we could go through these after dinner and have Syl
schedule some showings for tomorrow.

526
00:25:00,404 -->  00:25:06,442
I understand that as man and wife,
Rita and I will have to live under the same roof.

528
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:09,445
So why is it the only word echoing in my head is...

529
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,047
No.

530
00:25:13,117 --> 00:25:15,818
No?

531
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:21,891
Okay, I guess we don't have to look at all of them.

532
00:25:21,926 --> 00:25:23,293
No.

533
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:28,898
"no" doesn't really work in a relationship, Dexter.

534
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:32,202
"can we talk about it?" is a little more productive.

535
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:35,939
I'm sorry, but I don't want to look at houses.

536
00:25:35,973 --> 00:25:38,107
Not now anyway.

537
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,814
Fine, that's all you had to say.

538
00:25:44,848 --> 00:25:51,287
Uh, if Syl and I go out to look tomorrow in the morning,
Can you watch astor and cody?

541
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:55,525
No, I'm going fishing tomorrow.

542
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,961
I'm gonna be gone all day.

543
00:25:57,995 --> 00:26:00,129
And you were gonna tell me this when?

544
00:26:00,197 --> 00:26:02,632
Rita, this is the first I'm hearing about house hunting.

545
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,568
I can't just drop everything at the last minute because you want me to.

547
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:10,607
Dinner will be ready in five minutes.

548
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:12,308
It's a roast.

549
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:13,810
Your favorite.

550
00:26:20,284 --> 00:26:22,585
I double-checked ethan's ship itinerary.

551
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,621
He's in bimini today only.

552
00:26:24,655 --> 00:26:27,790
Gives me one shot to head him off at the pass.

553
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:31,696
Sorry, Rita, but right now I need this
more than a big yard and a two-car garage.

555
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:39,137
Let me guess, Syl?

556
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:46,878
She might have mentioned that Rita and she were going house hunting
Because a certain gilipollas decided that he'd rather go fishing.

560
00:26:46,913 --> 00:26:48,113
Gilipollas?

561
00:26:48,147 --> 00:26:50,415
You don't wanna know.

562
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:52,183
So this is the boat you keep talking about, huh?

563
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:54,152
Wow, she's a beauty.

564
00:26:54,186 --> 00:26:55,654
You gonna take me out on her sometime?

565
00:26:55,688 --> 00:26:58,323
Sure thing.

566
00:26:58,357 --> 00:27:01,426
So what brings you out here?

567
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,162
Thought maybe we could grab some food before you go out.

569
00:27:04,196 --> 00:27:06,031
You know, kind of like a rain check for yesterday.

570
00:27:06,065 --> 00:27:07,599
Ah, can't leave the boat.

571
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:09,067
Everything's onboard.

572
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,569
Olvidete. okay.

573
00:27:10,603 --> 00:27:13,004
Don't worry about it.

574
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,106
So where are they biting?

575
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:16,875
Um, heading up north, mercy reef.

576
00:27:16,909 --> 00:27:18,843
Always had good luck there.

577
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:24,883
You know, I got half a mind to postpone the arraignment 
that I have and just go with you.

580
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:26,651
Please don't.

581
00:27:30,055 --> 00:27:30,855
Nah.

582
00:27:30,855 --> 00:27:32,290
I gotta be in court.

583
00:27:35,895 --> 00:27:39,464
I'm gonna try to put out some fire that your lieutenant started.

585
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:46,137
But I'm glad I caught you, you know?

586
00:27:46,172 --> 00:27:50,108
Hey, how about whatever you catch, 
we put on the grill tonight?

588
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,810
Wish me luck.

589
00:28:06,592 --> 00:28:08,326
Thanks for coming in early.

590
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:13,164
Lieutenant Prado wanted to get us all up to speed
on the skinner case.

593
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,667
Thank you.

594
00:28:15,701 --> 00:28:16,968
This is our vic's boyfriend.

595
00:28:17,003 --> 00:28:19,571
Now, no one's seen him since the night in question.

596
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:22,307
We could use your help tracking him down.

597
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,609
Soderquist, ramos, you're on it.

598
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:27,779
I was also hoping I could speak with a couple
of your previous witnesses.

600
00:28:29,313 --> 00:28:31,315
"speak with" as in we didn't do it right the first time?

601
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:32,917
Cases evolve.

602
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:34,252
Witnesses change their story.

603
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:35,787
Junior personnel, they make mistakes.

604
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:37,555
No disrespect.

605
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,124
Actually, it's a lot of disrespect.

606
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:40,525
You've come into our house twice.

607
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,127
You not only insult our police work,

608
00:28:43,161 --> 00:28:46,464
Now you're insulting one of the most dedicated officers
I've ever partnered with.

610
00:28:46,532 --> 00:28:47,832
Yes, you.

611
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:48,967
It's bullshit, my man.

612
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:58,944
Let's not lose sight of the fact that we want the same thing here to find
whoever is responsible for these murders.

615
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:01,279
Uh, there is one slight problem.

616
00:29:01,314 --> 00:29:05,116
Your case has nothing to do with our case.

617
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:06,184
The vic wasn't skinned?

618
00:29:06,252 --> 00:29:08,253
Not like our previous victims.

619
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:11,756
There were minute traces of ink in the papillary and reticular--

621
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,558
English.

622
00:29:13,593 --> 00:29:16,728
Someone dug out a tattoo from the back of her neck.

623
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:18,663
Post-mortem.

624
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:20,165
Which is another reason why

625
00:29:20,232 --> 00:29:22,467
I don't think we're looking at the same killer.

626
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:25,203
It's all right here in the county medical examiner's report.

628
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:26,271
That's your opinion.

629
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:28,139
My lab thinks differently. let me see that.

630
00:29:28,207 --> 00:29:30,242
You're not taking this seriously, are you?

631
00:29:30,276 --> 00:29:31,843
In a fucking heartbeat.

632
00:29:31,877 --> 00:29:33,845
Do you know how many times vince masuka's been published?

633
00:29:33,879 --> 00:29:36,514
He's our lead forensic investigator.

634
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:38,483
And there's no one better.

635
00:29:38,517 --> 00:29:41,519
Our victim was strangled, 
the same as yours.

637
00:29:41,554 --> 00:29:47,692
Petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes and bruising
Would lead one to conclude strangulation.

640
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:49,694
Unless you're me.

641
00:29:49,762 --> 00:29:53,565
You were so busy playing hide the sausage
with the M.E.'s report,

643
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,669
You were hoping I'd miss the cotton fibers
in the nose and airways.

645
00:29:57,703 --> 00:29:59,037
Your victim was smothered.

646
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:02,140
That's not opinion, that's science.

647
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:07,312
And science is one cold-hearted bitch
with a 14-inch strap-on.

649
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,980
And he's back.

650
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,785
Well, I think we're through here.

651
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:17,422
I'm not so sure your lieutenant would agree, Sergeant.

653
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:20,725
Then you don't know her as well as you thought, Lieutenant.

655
00:30:47,486 --> 00:30:49,187
Ethan.

656
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:53,391
Apparently Ethan is looking for more than adventure on the high seas.

658
00:30:53,459 --> 00:30:55,794
Both of his deceased wives had prenups.

659
00:30:55,828 --> 00:30:58,696
In a divorce, he would have been lucky to keep the rolex.

660
00:30:58,696 --> 00:31:01,199
But he wanted it all.

661
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:04,035
Ethan made a choice.

662
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,306
And pretty soon, you're gonna have to make one too, Dex.

663
00:31:08,341 --> 00:31:12,277
Ethan chose to be rich rather than married.

665
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:16,147
I, on the other hand, chose to stay with Doris,
even after--

667
00:31:16,182 --> 00:31:17,349
You cheated on her?

668
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:22,020
You think you and I are so different, don't you?

669
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:24,789
I'm nothing like you.

670
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:26,758
Really?

671
00:31:26,792 --> 00:31:30,929
You're here and rita's back home.

672
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:33,798
You're cheating on her, and you don't even realize it.

674
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,835
I'll make time for my dark passenger

675
00:31:36,903 --> 00:31:39,237
And for Rita.

676
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,473
It's about priorities, Dexter.

677
00:31:41,507 --> 00:31:47,078
You're gonna have to choose which one is your mistress
and which one is your wife.

679
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,815
And more importantly, which one comes first.

680
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:58,156
Harry, you missed a spot.

681
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:04,796
Oh, hi, baby.

682
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,698
Hi, mom.

683
00:32:12,505 --> 00:32:17,175
Attention all atlantic sun cruise passengers,
This is bebay, your cruise director.

685
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:21,313
The next sea taxi is leaving Bimini for our ship in 20 minutes.

687
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:28,186
It looked much bigger from out here.

688
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,055
Well, you could always knock out a wall or two.

689
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:31,790
It's easier than you think.

690
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,825
How about the kitchen?

691
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,727
Wall, the bay window was nice.

692
00:32:35,761 --> 00:32:37,829
But those cabinets...

693
00:32:37,863 --> 00:32:40,398
Don't get bogged down in the cosmetic stuff.

694
00:32:40,466 --> 00:32:43,602
How did it feel when you were inside?

695
00:32:45,436 --> 00:32:45,903
Like a home.

696
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,708
God, you're good.

697
00:32:49,742 --> 00:32:50,976
You're my friend, Rita.

698
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,877
I wouldn't put you in something I didn't believe in.

699
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:55,146
And I believe that this home can work for you.

700
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,781
For your family.

701
00:32:59,452 --> 00:33:02,354
What are the rules about using the bathroom in a house you're showing?

703
00:33:02,388 --> 00:33:03,555
No rules. you gotta go, you gotta go.

704
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,123
All right.

705
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:12,230
Can I see your venture passport, sir? thank you.

706
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:14,132
Keep coming.

707
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,168
Excuse me, sir, can I take a look at your venture passport?

709
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,303
Thank you.

710
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:19,871
Ma'am, could I see your pass?

711
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:21,773
Thank you.

712
00:33:23,407 --> 00:33:26,911
Attention all atlantic sun cruise passengers,
this is bebay, your cruise director.

714
00:33:26,911 --> 00:33:31,316
The sea taxi is departing Bimini for our ship in five minutes.

716
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,987
Also please remember that the last sea taxi
of the evening leaves the ship at 10:45 tonight.

718
00:33:36,022 --> 00:33:40,692
All visitors, guests, anyone who doesn't belong on board
must disembark at that time.

720
00:33:40,726 --> 00:33:42,093
It'll be tight.

721
00:33:42,128 --> 00:33:45,397
But I think both ethan turner and i will be off the ship by that time.

723
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:48,733
Of course, only one of us will be doing so
because he wants to.

725
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:54,272
Rita?

726
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:57,275
I'm bleeding.

727
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,578
Oh, my god.

728
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:02,280
All right, there's a hospital five blocks away.

729
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:04,583
Waiting for an ambulance is only gonna take time.

730
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:05,784
What about dexter?

731
00:34:05,818 --> 00:34:07,419
We'll call from the car.

732
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:14,526
Those things will kill you, you know?

733
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,529
I'll talk to you later.

734
00:34:19,064 --> 00:34:20,999
I've been by here four times looking for you.

735
00:34:22,233 --> 00:34:22,833
What for?

736
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:23,835
The other cop said you couldn't talk to me.

737
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,539
Well, he's right. I can't. officially.

738
00:34:27,573 --> 00:34:34,446
But unofficially, there's no reason you can't call me
just in case there's something you want to tell me about your ex-boss.

742
00:34:37,783 --> 00:34:41,419
Burgers, fries, and onion rings.

743
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:57,534
You know, I know the situation with your mom
not being around really sucks.

745
00:34:57,769 --> 00:35:00,939
But if things get really bad,
you use that card and call me, okay?

747
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,410
I kept my nose outta freebo's business.

748
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:08,580
It was safer that way.

749
00:35:08,614 --> 00:35:10,415
Do you have any idea where he is?

750
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:12,517
No.

751
00:35:12,551 --> 00:35:15,153
I know he was into someone for some major cash.

752
00:35:15,187 --> 00:35:16,721
He was pretty scared.

753
00:35:16,756 --> 00:35:19,491
That's probably why he's hiding out somewhere.

754
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:23,094
Well, that explains why someone's
trying so hard to find him.

756
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:24,429
They want their money back.

757
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:27,332
- So are we done? 
- We're done.

758
00:35:27,933 --> 00:35:29,033
Oh, yeah, one other thing.

759
00:35:29,033 --> 00:35:30,135
Yeah?

760
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,941
When you find that jerk-off,
tell him he still owes me three weeks' pay.

762
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:37,309
Thanks.

763
00:35:39,376 --> 00:35:40,211
Watch yourself out here, okay?

764
00:35:40,211 --> 00:35:40,979
Okay.

765
00:36:46,011 --> 00:36:47,745
Miguel, thank god you're here.

766
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,046
How is she?

767
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,682
They rushed her up to prenatal I.C.U.
but they won't tell me a thing.

769
00:36:51,717 --> 00:36:52,817
I'm not family.

770
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,487
Miss.

771
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:57,655
Hi, my name is Miguel Prado.

772
00:36:57,689 --> 00:36:59,123
I'm an assistant district attorney.

773
00:36:59,158 --> 00:37:00,591
I need you to find your chief of staff,

774
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:02,093
Dr. Reynolds, and have him call this--

775
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:03,795
Yeah, I'm just an admit nurse. you're gonna have--

776
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:07,432
Hey, call him.
Right now.

778
00:37:10,669 --> 00:37:12,403
I feel so bad for rita. she's all alone.

779
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,873
Baby, baby, Reynolds is gonna make sure
she gets the best care in Miami.

781
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:17,008
Why isn't Dexter back?

782
00:37:17,042 --> 00:37:18,109
I've been calling all day.

783
00:37:18,143 --> 00:37:22,613
Goddamn it, the father should be here.

784
00:37:24,216 --> 00:37:26,584
I enjoyed shuffling through your ipod
to make sure that no one hears us.

786
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:30,354
Of course, most of your shipmates
are up on the blue deck.

788
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:32,190
It's happy hour. just the two of us.

789
00:37:39,798 --> 00:37:44,202
Oh, it's too bad I have to make this quick.

790
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:47,305
I'm usually all for a stimulating conversation
at times like this.

792
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,973
But the last sea taxi leaves in an hour.

793
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:57,749
I've been going through some changes myself lately.

794
00:37:59,685 --> 00:38:00,752
I'm getting married.

795
00:38:00,786 --> 00:38:02,854
I've got a baby on the way. me.

796
00:38:05,657 --> 00:38:08,826
Even though my life may never be the same,
I want to thank you for reminding me,
 
798
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:11,395
How important it is to take time for oneself.

799
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:17,769
Savor these moments alone.

800
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,808
And here I am.

801
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:27,245
Paradox personified.

802
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:29,113
Taking life.

803
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:31,482
Creating life.

804
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:50,368
With the ship anchored away from shore,
the gulf stream will be ethan's last cruise.

806
00:38:50,402 --> 00:38:52,270
Bon voyage.

807
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:03,915
This isn't like Dexter.

808
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,917
Something's wrong.

809
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:09,487
Sweetie, I know this is difficult,
but you need to stay calm.

811
00:39:09,521 --> 00:39:11,489
I sent the coast guard out there to look for him.

812
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,224
He wasn't at his fishing spot.

813
00:39:13,258 --> 00:39:15,126
So maybe he's back at the marina by now.

814
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:16,627
Then why hasn't he called?

815
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:26,037
Anton, open up. it's me.

816
00:39:28,807 --> 00:39:31,175
I tried calling. I got a lead.

817
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,444
I know why someone's looking for you-know-who.

818
00:39:39,685 --> 00:39:42,854
Hurry up if you want your money.

819
00:39:43,888 --> 00:39:45,724
Yes, I was wrong about--

820
00:39:48,728 --> 00:39:50,495
Bupkus.

821
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,990
Is anton here?

822
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:57,335
He's in the shower.

823
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:01,439
Oh, he'll be out soon,
'cause I think we used up all the hot water.

825
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:05,109
I can get him.

826
00:40:05,144 --> 00:40:07,678
Oh, no, that's all right.

827
00:40:08,013 --> 00:40:11,049
Just, um, have him call Debra Morgan.

828
00:40:11,783 --> 00:40:13,250
It's important.

829
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,085
Are you sure you don't want me to--

830
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,253
Thanks.

831
00:40:23,094 --> 00:40:23,461
What?

832
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,197
Hello, Debra. this is Miguel Prado.

833
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:30,034
Have you heard from Dexter?

834
00:40:30,068 --> 00:40:32,303
Uh, no. why?

835
00:40:32,337 --> 00:40:35,239
Well, we're at the hospital with Rita right now.

836
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:37,675
Hospital? everything all right?

837
00:40:37,709 --> 00:40:40,978
Debra, we need to find your brother.

838
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,756
Ethan turner was incapable of compromise.

839
00:40:52,791 --> 00:40:56,860
He loved his wives' money more than he loved them.

840
00:40:56,928 --> 00:41:00,998
And in the end, it cost him dearly.

841
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:03,267
I don't wanna be like ethan.

842
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:10,107
Maybe my days of coming and going as I please are over.

844
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:12,376
But that doesn't mean my life is over.

845
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:24,321
Not as long as I have my boat and the open water.

847
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,957
There are some things I can keep to myself.

848
00:41:30,695 --> 00:41:34,098
You have 12 unheard messages.

849
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:37,935
Dex, it's me.

850
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:39,737
I'm on my way to the hospital.

851
00:41:39,804 --> 00:41:42,873
I think there's something wrong with the baby.

852
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:55,552
The baby?

853
00:41:55,587 --> 00:41:58,856
The baby's fine.

854
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:05,329
They said if I stay on bed rest the next few days

856
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:06,897
That I can...

857
00:42:06,932 --> 00:42:10,734
We can go home tomorrow.

858
00:42:15,507 --> 00:42:19,777
I don't know what I would have done
if I'd lost the baby and you weren't here.

860
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:25,149
And nobody could find you.

861
00:42:25,183 --> 00:42:27,618
I'm here now.

862
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:33,023
And I'm not going anywhere.

863
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:45,436
I think maybe we should wait
to find a house until after we're married.

865
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:50,107
Just name the date.

866
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:52,209
I'm ready.

867
00:42:58,917 --> 00:43:04,121
I'd like to walk down the aisle
before I start to show.

869
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:06,523
Whatever you want.

870
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:28,279
I may never be able to feel
our baby's heartbeat emotionally.

872
00:43:28,313 --> 00:43:31,248
But I know now I can't ignore it either.

873
00:43:31,283 --> 00:43:37,154
And for some reason I can't explain,
I'm relieved to know it's still here.

875
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:40,494
Fishing?

876
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,364
That's where you were all night?

877
00:43:47,399 --> 00:43:49,667
Deb...

878
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:55,639
You can't make me feel any worse than I already do.

880
00:43:55,707 --> 00:43:58,509
Well, I hope this was a big wake-up call for you.

881
00:43:58,543 --> 00:44:02,613
'cause you're gonna be a father before you know it.

882
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:06,483
Yeah, I see that now.

883
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,586
My life is changing.

884
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,855
And if it'll make you happy, my place is yours.

885
00:44:14,392 --> 00:44:18,028
What'll make me happy is you being there for that kid.

887
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:23,033
For homework and plays.

889
00:44:23,068 --> 00:44:25,903
And softball games.

890
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:30,541
Don't you dare be like dad.

891
00:44:30,575 --> 00:44:34,144
That's never gonna happen.

892
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:47,324
Quite a night, huh?

893
00:44:50,128 --> 00:44:52,129
I should have been here.

894
00:44:52,163 --> 00:44:54,965
Well, syl and I were.

895
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,001
That's what friends are for.

896
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,574
I owe you one.

897
00:45:03,608 --> 00:45:07,511
I just may take you up on that someday.

898
00:45:07,545 --> 00:45:12,549
You know, my office got the strangest fax tonight from Atlantic sun cruises.

900
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:16,954
You remember that guy that I was telling you about
whose wife disappeared on some cruise?

902
00:45:16,988 --> 00:45:21,892
Get this, he was reported missing about an hour ago.

904
00:45:24,562 --> 00:45:26,664
Where was it that you say you went fishing?

905
00:45:29,568 --> 00:45:31,168
Mercy reef.

906
00:45:31,202 --> 00:45:32,570
Yeah, Mercy reef.

907
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:36,507
That's what I thought you said.

908
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:42,179
'cause when I sent the coast guard over there,
they couldn't find you.

910
00:45:42,213 --> 00:45:44,782
The ocean's a big place.

911
00:45:46,251 --> 00:45:48,852
Or maybe you weren't at Mercy reef.

912
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:53,190
Where else would I have been?

913
00:45:55,894 --> 00:45:59,597
Bimini's...  What, 40 miles away?

914
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:02,333
I went fishing. 
You watched me leave.

915
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:04,101
You were on that cruise ship.

916
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:07,838
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

917
00:46:07,872 --> 00:46:12,142
You were on that cruise ship finishing what I couldn't.

918
00:46:14,546 --> 00:46:16,981
Wasn't me.

919
00:46:17,048 --> 00:46:21,852
You were making sure that Ethan Turner
could never hurt another innocent soul again.

921
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,554
It's getting late. you should go.

922
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:25,155
It's okay.

923
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,025
Dexter, you and I, we're the same.

924
00:46:28,059 --> 00:46:30,327
No one is like me.

925
00:46:30,362 --> 00:46:31,962
You're wrong.

926
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:37,101
Hey, you're wrong.

927
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:39,737
Don't you see what happened today?

928
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:45,676
I gave you the chance to avenge two women
whom the system failed, and just like I hoped,

930
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:48,479
You seized that opportunity.

931
00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:50,316
It's not like that.

932
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,118
Dexter...

933
00:46:54,152 --> 00:46:56,820
You don't have to lie to me.

934
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:59,523
Don't you understand?

935
00:46:59,557 --> 00:47:01,158
Hey, I see who you are.

936
00:47:01,192 --> 00:47:04,595
No, you can't.

937
00:47:04,663 --> 00:47:06,030
No one can.

938
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:07,965
You have nothing to explain to me.

939
00:47:07,999 --> 00:47:10,601
Nothing to apologize for.

940
00:47:10,635 --> 00:47:12,102
Ever.

941
00:47:14,205 --> 00:47:16,240
I'm with you.

942
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:19,310
I'm behind you.

943
00:47:19,344 --> 00:47:22,313
And I respect you.

944
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:28,118
I better get home.

945
00:47:28,153 --> 00:47:30,321
Syl will be waiting up.

946
00:47:30,388 --> 00:47:33,457
Good night, dexter.

947
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:37,661
When harry saw what I truly was,
he was repulsed.

949
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:41,699
It destroyed my brother, consumed Lila.

951
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:44,335
But not Miguel Prado.

952
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:47,938
Somehow he looks at me and he's...

953
00:47:47,973 --> 00:47:50,374
Proud.

954
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:55,374
