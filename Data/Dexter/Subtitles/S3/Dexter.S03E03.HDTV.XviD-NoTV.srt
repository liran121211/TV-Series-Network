1
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,334
<i>Previously on Dexter.</i>

2
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,634
This child is happening.

3
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,000
<i>I'm going to have a child.</i>

4
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,601
<i>But I can't be a father to it.</i>

5
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:47,967
<i>Can I?</i>

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,634
The Oscar Prado case?

7
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:51,467
Yeah, fucker's running
career maker of the year.

8
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,734
They nailed this Freebo guy in golden.

9
00:01:53,768 --> 00:01:55,933
This time, he killed a
senior A.D.A's brother.

10
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:57,967
<i>Except he didn't kill Oscar.</i>

11
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,300
<i>I did.</i>

12
00:01:59,334 --> 00:02:00,967
- What do you have on Freebo, Maria?
- Ramon.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,701
Well, we're working on some new angles.

14
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:04,900
Which means you've got shit.

15
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,033
This doesn't look good, Javier.

16
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,300
I think you fucked a
girl who's now dead.

17
00:02:07,334 --> 00:02:08,334
All right, look.

18
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:09,401
I passed her to a friend.

19
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:10,967
- Who could feed her--
- A friend?

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
- Right.
- Yeah.

21
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,567
Yeah, a white guy named Freebo.

22
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,467
Freebo?

23
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:17,634
Why do you think Freebo's still in town?

24
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:20,000
Because I think he killed
his girlfriend on Sunday.

25
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:21,434
Jane Doe.

26
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,367
And wasn't Jane Doe
missing a patch of skin?

27
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:24,933
Freebo's still out there, killing.

28
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:26,000
We got to catch him fast.

29
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,467
Yeah, but we got a lead now.

30
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:30,401
<i>This department is becoming
annoyingly effective.</i>

31
00:02:30,434 --> 00:02:33,100
Anton is my contact.

32
00:02:33,134 --> 00:02:34,300
If you wear him out,

33
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:35,234
or blow his cover--

34
00:02:35,268 --> 00:02:37,567
I know how to work a CI, Quinn.

35
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:40,333
So unless there's some other reason
you don't want me to talk to him?

36
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,234
I can get you a shield tomorrow.

37
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:45,567
Will you get me a shield for being a rat?

38
00:02:45,601 --> 00:02:46,801
No.

39
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,267
For being an honest cop, Debra.

40
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
Like your father.

41
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:54,567
I know all about the Chicky Hines case.

42
00:02:54,601 --> 00:02:55,634
He was a big one for the prosecutor.

43
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:56,667
And guess who that was?

44
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,167
Shit.

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,167
Miguel Prado.

46
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,434
<i>M-6 bayonet.</i>

47
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:04,234
<i>Oscar tried to kill Freebo with it.</i>

48
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,334
<i>It's only fitting I use
it to complete the task.</i>

49
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,134
It was self-defense.

50
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:19,234
Thank you.

51
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:21,334
You're welcome.

52
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,467
<i>The grocery store.</i>

53
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,601
<i>The modern day equivalent
of the serengeti</i>

54
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:44,401
<i>where the mighty lion goes to hunt.</i>

55
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:49,067
<i>And my weaker brethren
reward me with gifts.</i>

56
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,900
We'll be needing a lot
of those pretty soon.

57
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:58,167
<i>The lioness, of course,
has her own agenda.</i>

58
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:01,434
What's next?

59
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:04,801
Macaroni and cheese.

60
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:06,234
Mayonnaise.

61
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,601
You do your grocery list alphabetically?

62
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:12,367
How else would you do it?

63
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:16,567
Got it.

64
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,300
The rare and elusive white cheddar.

65
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:20,768
Very good choice.

66
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,434
Let's go find something else.

67
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,868
What you wanna be?
A painter?

68
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,367
I don't know...

69
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,434
I bet you're a good drawer.

70
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,534
A sculptor...

71
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,667
<i>My highly tuned senses
detect another predator.</i>

72
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,234
<i>Sniffing around one of my cubs.</i>

73
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:35,900
Did you get the mayo?

74
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,067
Yep.

75
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,434
He wanted to know
where the Cheerios are.

76
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:49,300
Aisle three. Other side of the store.

77
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,801
Thanks.

78
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,434
All right. What's next?

79
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:03,567
Zucchini.

80
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,933
<i>Just in case.</i>

81
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:45,434
F.Q.

82
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:49,200
Forensics quarterly.

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,033
Forensics quarterly.

84
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:56,768
With an article written by yours truly.

85
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:58,567
Good stuff. Very sexy.

86
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:05,201
"Simultaneous quantification of
autosomal and Y-Chromasomal DNA"?

87
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,567
I autographed it,

88
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,100
but if you want me to
write something personal,

89
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,834
Just let me know.

90
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,834
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

91
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,701
No match on her prints.

92
00:06:17,734 --> 00:06:19,200
No missing persons report.

93
00:06:19,234 --> 00:06:20,367
So Jane Doe--

94
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:21,967
... is still Jane Doe.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,567
And Freebo?

96
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:25,401
Same thing, nothing.

97
00:06:31,134 --> 00:06:34,067
Sugar is so much better
than the artificial stuff.

98
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,134
Don't you think?

99
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:36,501
Well, I guess.

100
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:38,534
Do you like milk or cream?

101
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,200
Neither.

102
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,134
Not exactly the chatty type, are you?

103
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:43,933
No.

104
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:50,100
Quinn, Morgan.

105
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,501
Man the phones.

106
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:53,234
Man the streets.

107
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,667
Someone out there's seen Freebo.

108
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:55,701
And we haven't found him yet.

109
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:56,301
Let's go.

110
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:57,601
<i>Miguel Prado.</i>

111
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:01,300
<i>The only living person who's
seen me with blood on my hands.</i>

112
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,234
- Miguel.
- Maria.

113
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:05,234
Hey. How are you holding up?

114
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,501
I can't lie.

115
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:09,968
I'm missing my little brother
every minute of every day.

116
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:12,267
Well, it'll get easier.

117
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,901
It's a cliche, but it's true.

118
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:19,267
I want to thank you for making
Dexter Morgan available to me.

119
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:22,000
He went to great trouble to help me...

120
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:26,834
Understand how Oscar's
last moments unfolded.

121
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:29,433
<i>Why is he trying so
hard to be my friend?</i>

122
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:32,234
We're doing everything we can
to find the man who killed Oscar.

123
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,701
Yeah, I know you are.
I know you are.

124
00:07:33,734 --> 00:07:36,833
That's why I feel like I'm
in such a difficult situation.

125
00:07:37,433 --> 00:07:39,401
What is that?

126
00:07:39,434 --> 00:07:43,734
You've dedicated so many of your
resources towards resolving this.

127
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:46,000
<i>He's trying to end the investigation.</i>

128
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,067
Is it worth it?

129
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,434
We both know if you don't catch a perp

130
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,634
in the first 48 hours, the
chances significantly drop

131
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:53,601
- that you ever will--
- Miguel.

132
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:54,900
This is not the time to give up

133
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,534
Or even slow down.

134
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,234
We will find Fred Bowman.

135
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:00,768
We'll bring him to justice.

136
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:02,334
Thank you, Maria.
Thank you.

137
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:08,933
Tonight...

138
00:08:08,967 --> 00:08:10,667
Viernes Cultural.

139
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:11,900
Come by the beach,

140
00:08:11,933 --> 00:08:14,401
Grab a beer, uh... medianoche.

141
00:08:14,434 --> 00:08:15,534
Right after work.

142
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:16,768
You'll be home by eight.

143
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:17,801
I don't know if Rita will be up for it.

144
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,434
Syl already talked to her.

145
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,900
She'd love to go.

146
00:08:23,033 --> 00:08:25,167
Then, Viernes Cultural it is.

147
00:08:31,601 --> 00:08:34,634
Did he say anything about
the Chicky Hines situation?

148
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,634
I still got a witness in lockup
that says Hines is innocent.

149
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:38,834
Miguel is aware of that.

150
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:40,033
I know.

151
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:40,934
I was just wondering when he's finally

152
00:08:40,935 --> 00:08:42,835
gonna get around to
questioning my witness?

153
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:46,300
I assumed he had already.

154
00:08:46,334 --> 00:08:47,734
Not as of this morning.

155
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:50,300
Well, I'm sure he'll get to it.

156
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:53,734
I'll talk to him.

157
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,667
We got a new murder victim.

158
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:58,601
Dumped in the park just like our Jane Doe.

159
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:00,001
Some of his skin was sliced off.

160
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,801
It looks like Freebo struck again.

161
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,367
All right. Let's get there.

162
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:04,634
<i>It can't be Freebo.</i>

163
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,167
<i>I killed him.</i>

164
00:09:08,467 --> 00:09:11,000
<i>But only Miguel and I know that.</i>

165
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,667
<i>And we're not at liberty to tell.</i>

166
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,933
Javier Garza. He was a low-life pimp.

167
00:09:36,967 --> 00:09:39,800
He's the one that connected
our Jane Doe to Freebo.

168
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:41,968
Well, it looks like Freebo
paid him back for that.

169
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,234
Well I can't say for certain

170
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:45,334
until I get this under the 'scope,

171
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:47,067
But I'm guessing we're looking

172
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,768
at something like an eight-inch blade,

173
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:49,933
Razor sharp.

174
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:52,367
Single-edged. Same type of...

175
00:09:52,401 --> 00:09:54,033
instrument used on our Jane Doe.

176
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,868
So Freebo killed Javier.

177
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,834
<i>No, he didn't kill Javier.</i>

178
00:09:57,868 --> 00:09:59,534
One of the tree-trimmers called it in,

179
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,167
Said he didn't see anything

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,334
or anyone unusual.

181
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,601
It all points to Freebo.

182
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:06,367
Looks like he got a little
hungry for flesh this time.

183
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:07,467
Yeah, what the hell's that about?

184
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,567
Do we think he's eating it?

185
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:11,634
There's a lot more
cannibalism in this country

186
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,033
than any of you realize.

187
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,501
Maybe the skin's like
a trophy or something.

188
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:17,801
Or he just likes to hurt people.

189
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:19,067
What do you think, Dex?

190
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,033
Well, they all sound
like good theories to me.

191
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:23,734
Way to commit.

192
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:26,167
All right, so far we
haven't found shit on Freebo.

193
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:27,634
But now he's giving us a second chance.

194
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,933
So let's not blow it.

195
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,267
Quinn, Morgan... let's
get a canvas going.

196
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,534
One block perimeter.
Start with the tree trimmers.

197
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,167
Why don't you take the tree trimmers?

198
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,434
I'm going to start over here.

199
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:38,967
Oh, gosh. I wonder why.

200
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:46,768
Can you come down here?

201
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,234
Sure.

202
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:57,501
Hi. I'm detective Joseph Quinn.

203
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:59,401
There's nothing to worry about here.

204
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:00,567
Did you guys see anything?

205
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,601
How long have you been out here?

206
00:11:01,634 --> 00:11:02,768
You been out here a while?

207
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:03,933
What's your name?

208
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,401
George Washington King.

209
00:11:05,434 --> 00:11:06,768
And you called this in?

210
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:07,834
Yes, I did.

211
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:08,834
You found the body?

212
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:10,967
Uh... no, no. Mario did.

213
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,300
Will you join us please?

214
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,100
Van aqui.

215
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:16,801
Mario, did you notice anyone else?

216
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,667
Keep my eyes on my work.

217
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,100
I got to go with Freebo on this one.

218
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:25,567
That means he's stepping out

219
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,300
from wherever he's been hiding.

220
00:11:27,334 --> 00:11:29,067
Not so good for our latest victim,

221
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,134
But good for us.

222
00:11:30,167 --> 00:11:32,033
Yeah...

223
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,933
Yeah.

224
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:35,234
Hey, Dex, let's grab a beer tonight,

225
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:36,467
talk about my Jane Doe.

226
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,501
I'd like to help you,

227
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:39,667
But I really have too much
to deal with right now.

228
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:40,768
What do you have to deal with?

229
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:43,701
Rita's pregnant.

230
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,634
Say again?

231
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:48,801
Rita's pregnant.

232
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,000
You're lying!

233
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:52,667
I'm not lying.

234
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:55,367
A baby?!

235
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:58,200
A motherfucking roly-poly
chubby-cheeked shit-machine?

236
00:11:58,234 --> 00:11:59,601
Are you kidding me?

237
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:01,334
Well, I've never heard it described

238
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,033
in quite those words before, but yeah.

239
00:12:05,634 --> 00:12:06,900
That's so great!

240
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm so happy for you guys.

241
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:15,401
Well, thank you.

242
00:12:16,868 --> 00:12:18,100
<i>Baby on board.</i>

243
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:19,834
<i>I've got to get on board.</i>

244
00:12:21,467 --> 00:12:22,901
Grab a sweater.

245
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:23,967
It'll get cool later.

246
00:12:33,467 --> 00:12:34,434
You okay?

247
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:37,734
I always get my morning
sickness late in the day.

248
00:12:37,834 --> 00:12:40,367
You want to stay home?
We don't have to go.

249
00:12:41,401 --> 00:12:42,033
No.

250
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,000
The Prados will understand.

251
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,534
No.

252
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,234
I was looking forward to seeing Syl.

253
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,567
And I know how much you
love hanging out with Miguel.

254
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,301
<i>Miguel. My new "bestest" friend.</i>

255
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:56,067
Besides, the doctor says
the way I'm feeling is fine.

256
00:12:57,967 --> 00:13:00,067
What else did the doctor say?

257
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:03,301
He asked me a million questions
about my medical history.

258
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:04,634
There's a form for you to fill out too,

259
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,200
but I told him you were adopted.

260
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:09,134
I mean...

261
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:10,868
Are there any details that you do know?

262
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,667
<i>Like mom was killed by a chainsaw.</i>

263
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:14,567
<i>My brother was killed by...</i>

264
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:16,467
<i>Well, me. That kind of stuff?</i>

265
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,300
No, I don't really know anything.

266
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,567
It's okay.

267
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:26,834
I could go to the doctor and
get checked out, if you want.

268
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,567
You'd do that?

269
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,342
Of course.

270
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:34,109
I'm glad we're in this together, Dexter.

271
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:36,643
And you'll make a good father.

272
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:38,842
You know, if you want to.

273
00:13:57,109 --> 00:13:59,776
Here. It'll help settle your stomach.

274
00:13:59,842 --> 00:14:01,309
Thank you.

275
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:03,143
How are you doing with everything else?

276
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,709
Good.

277
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,610
I feel better about it now.

278
00:14:08,043 --> 00:14:09,543
Actually kind of excited.

279
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:12,176
Good. And Dexter?

280
00:14:13,676 --> 00:14:17,109
I think he's still a little
overwhelmed by everything.

281
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,710
Ugh... Men.

282
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:20,242
They're such babies,
they need to be carried

283
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,209
kicking and screaming into fatherhood.

284
00:14:23,443 --> 00:14:26,010
I guess they're just scared
about losing their freedom.

285
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:28,643
Dexter.

286
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:33,242
I don't know if you officially got
to meet my other brother, Ramon.

287
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:35,410
Beautiful wife, Sara.

288
00:14:35,443 --> 00:14:38,476
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

289
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,110
Sheriff's department, right?

290
00:14:40,143 --> 00:14:41,609
That's right.

291
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:44,676
So you're the guy that Miguel
is always talking about?

292
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,943
Oh, don't worry.

293
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:48,776
Like they say, it's all good.

294
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,642
Yeah, if good means being part
of the team that's never going

295
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:53,110
to catch our brother's murderer.

296
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:56,643
My gracious brother.

297
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:59,476
Grab a beer?

298
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,143
Gracias, mi amigo.

299
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,376
Para servir.

300
00:15:07,043 --> 00:15:08,776
Free beer. Must be nice to be you.

301
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:12,676
A lot of people appreciate
knowing that I'm on their side.

302
00:15:15,843 --> 00:15:18,209
I understand you're soon-to-be a father.

303
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:20,976
Yeah.

304
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:23,742
What? Some mixed emotions there?

305
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:29,110
No. It's just...

306
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,376
Yeah, mixed emotions.

307
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:31,309
I don't know what's more complicated,

308
00:15:31,343 --> 00:15:34,077
having a father or being one. But...

309
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,776
It's good to know you're
not taking it lightly.

310
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,876
You'll see your way through it.

311
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,810
Hope so.

312
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:43,443
So uh...

313
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,742
Our friend Freebo...

314
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:47,610
Does he come back from the dead,

315
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:50,543
Or are the police mistaken?

316
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:53,110
I'd venture to guess
the police are mistaken.

317
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:55,676
You're positive?

318
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,242
Miguel, he's dead.

319
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:02,109
I believe you.

320
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:04,609
Well, good.

321
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:07,476
You just uh... Seem a little--

322
00:16:10,876 --> 00:16:13,610
You seem a little unsettled
with the whole thing.

323
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:16,810
<i>That's what he's looking for.
A sign that I'm normal.</i>

324
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:18,010
Uh... to be honest,

325
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,342
I haven't been sleeping too well lately.

326
00:16:19,376 --> 00:16:22,576
Just know you did the
right thing, my friend.

327
00:16:24,876 --> 00:16:26,910
And it will never be forgotten.

328
00:16:33,043 --> 00:16:36,710
<i>A full day of work.
An evening of socializing.</i>

329
00:16:36,743 --> 00:16:38,943
<i>And now... finally.</i>

330
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:42,710
<i>The calm, cool, aloneness
of my apartment.</i>

331
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:48,810
<i>Hello, Nathan Marten.</i>

332
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:50,810
<i>"Cheerios" man.</i>

333
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:04,143
<i>My animal instincts are never wrong.</i>

334
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:07,443
<i>Hello, Nathan Marten.
"Sexual Predator"</i>

335
00:17:08,743 --> 00:17:12,476
<i>You did four years at South Bay
correctional facility.</i>

336
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:15,043
<i>Your official status is "released."</i>

337
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,710
Which leaves you free to
slither about the earth.

338
00:17:33,976 --> 00:17:35,043
Miguel.

339
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:36,576
You know, I went back to my office,

340
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:37,843
to finish up with some paperwork,

341
00:17:37,876 --> 00:17:38,843
and it just...

342
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:40,476
It kept on nagging at me.

343
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:42,842
Cono, what Ramon said to you.

344
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:44,043
I wanted to apologize.

345
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,410
Ah... really not necessary.

346
00:17:47,876 --> 00:17:49,343
At least share a drink with me.

347
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:52,776
Yeah, I'll grab some glasses.

348
00:17:54,009 --> 00:17:55,709
<i>Showing up late at night like this,</i>

349
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,677
<i>is it creepy, or just what friends do?</i>

350
00:18:01,476 --> 00:18:02,742
How 'bout out here?

351
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:08,443
My father, he caught me
drinking from his bottle of rum

352
00:18:08,477 --> 00:18:09,610
when I was, like, 12.

353
00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:12,643
He grabbed that bottle,
he threw it at me.

354
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,410
Eight stitches, right in the
back of my head, right there.

355
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,110
Ouch.

356
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:21,176
He was a college professor back in Cuba.

357
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:25,176
Once he got married and had
a couple kids, he realized...

358
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:27,077
Time to get away from Castro's world.

359
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:29,409
So we came over on one of
these old fishing boats.

360
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:30,810
I was like, five.

361
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,109
Dexter.

362
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:35,476
The boat actually sank
50 yards from the shore.

363
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:36,676
My mother, she had to grab Ramon.

364
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,443
My father grabbed me, and
they swam to the shore.

365
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:40,643
Wet foot, dry foot.

366
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:41,843
Sounds brave.

367
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,343
Yeah.

368
00:18:43,376 --> 00:18:47,376
Yeah, he was a real hero, my father was.

369
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:49,910
He spent the rest of his
life telling everybody

370
00:18:49,943 --> 00:18:51,743
what a great man he could have been.

371
00:18:51,776 --> 00:18:53,810
If it wasn't for Castro.

372
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:55,743
The more he drank,
the greater he became.

373
00:18:58,309 --> 00:18:59,943
I would look at him and tell myself

374
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:02,810
"I'm not going to be like him."

375
00:19:08,343 --> 00:19:10,242
You succeeded.

376
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:12,476
Yes, I did.

377
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:13,776
You know what the funny thing is?

378
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,710
In his eyes,

379
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:17,176
I was a failure.

380
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:19,977
I could never measure up.

381
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:27,242
My father was disgusted by me.

382
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:31,976
Disgusted?

383
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,676
Then no offense to the dead,

384
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,509
but your father was an idiot.

385
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,142
Never said that to anyone before.

386
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:42,176
Not Rita.

387
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:43,409
Not my sister.

388
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,343
Yeah, yeah...
but Dexter--

389
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,077
They wouldn't understand.

390
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:46,909
You know that?

391
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:48,610
They don't know what it is to be a man.

392
00:19:48,643 --> 00:19:49,810
To be a son.

393
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:51,776
With all the pfffp... pressure.

394
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,376
You grow up to be exactly the man
your father molded you to be.

395
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:56,110
And still...

396
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:58,109
Not be good enough!

397
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,343
Exactly.

398
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,210
It was even harder on Oscar.

399
00:20:12,843 --> 00:20:14,076
You know, by the time he was born,

400
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,376
my father was hardly even around.

401
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,977
I mean I tried to take care of him,

402
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,142
Look aft-- you know.

403
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:23,176
I'm sorry.

404
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:24,610
<i>...that I killed him.</i>

405
00:20:26,043 --> 00:20:27,443
To Oscar.

406
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:29,977
To Oscar.

407
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,343
So, Dexter...

408
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,476
I think I have an answer
for our other little problem.

409
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:49,876
Yes, I think I got it all figured out.

410
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,077
All we have to do is get
Freebo's body, we dump it.

411
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:55,409
Then I can call Ramon.

412
00:20:55,443 --> 00:20:58,242
Tell him that I received
an anonymous tip

413
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:00,910
about where Freebo can be found,

414
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:02,343
that would close the case.

415
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:04,343
And we can all put it behind us.

416
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:08,043
Sorry, it's not possible.

417
00:21:08,077 --> 00:21:09,409
Of course it is. I'll help.

418
00:21:09,443 --> 00:21:12,710
Miguel, the body's... gone.

419
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,943
I'll get it. Just tell me where it is.

420
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:16,376
<i>He's not going to give up.</i>

421
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,509
<i>He needs to see something.</i>

422
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,876
I'll take you there.

423
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,443
Tomorrow, huh?

424
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:23,576
Lunchtime.

425
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,209
Okay.

426
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,109
I'll pick you up.

427
00:21:27,142 --> 00:21:28,576
But look, Dexter.

428
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,077
You're not in this alone, huh?

429
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:33,109
It's you and me.

430
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:34,643
Together.

431
00:21:40,943 --> 00:21:42,142
<i>That's the problem.</i>

432
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,376
<i>This whole "together" thing.</i>

433
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:49,109
Hey, stranger.

434
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,810
Shit.

435
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,576
All right, look, it's one thing
for you to come to the club.

436
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,477
But don't be tracking me
down all over the place.

437
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,776
I called you three times,

438
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,543
if you'd bothered to return
any of those phone calls,

439
00:21:59,577 --> 00:22:01,343
you could have picked the location.

440
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:04,043
No, I'm sorry it doesn't work that way.

441
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:10,476
Shit.

442
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:12,476
This is bullshit.

443
00:22:12,509 --> 00:22:13,476
What do you want?

444
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:16,443
Tell me about Javier.

445
00:22:16,476 --> 00:22:17,710
Okay, in case you haven't heard,

446
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:18,977
he's dead.

447
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,843
I have heard.
What else do you know?

448
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:23,543
That you were one of the
last ones to talk to him.

449
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,876
Looks like having a
conversation with you

450
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,176
can be dangerous to one's health.

451
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:29,109
Who had problems with Javier?

452
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:30,509
I don't know.

453
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:32,343
But I'm thinking I shouldn't
give you any more names,

454
00:22:32,376 --> 00:22:34,476
or they might end up dead too.

455
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:36,543
Well, you better give
me something, Anton.

456
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:38,810
I don't like you talking to me that way.

457
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:40,209
Oh, I'm sorry.

458
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:42,876
I didn't realize you were
such a high-class snitch.

459
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,576
Well, no part of me needs this.

460
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,242
So why don't you just
let me out of here.

461
00:22:48,276 --> 00:22:50,010
- Not till I get some answers.
- What, am I your prisoner?

462
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:51,376
Look, we have a deal.

463
00:22:51,409 --> 00:22:53,710
And I'm not leaving until
I get some information.

464
00:22:53,743 --> 00:22:55,476
You know something?
I know what'll make you leave.

465
00:22:56,977 --> 00:22:58,543
What the fuck?
Get rid of that.

466
00:22:58,576 --> 00:22:59,743
You sure don't want anyone to know

467
00:22:59,776 --> 00:23:00,910
you came to the men's room

468
00:23:00,943 --> 00:23:02,910
With your CI and lit up
a little joint, do you?

469
00:23:02,943 --> 00:23:05,343
Fuckin' flush it.

470
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:08,776
I can't flush this, mama.
This is premium island, lady.

471
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:11,910
If you light that, I'll arrest you.

472
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:14,443
Don't worry, there's more than enough.

473
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,710
I'll share.

474
00:23:27,476 --> 00:23:29,743
I told you not to fucking do it!

475
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:41,943
<i>It seems ironic that I,</i>

476
00:23:41,977 --> 00:23:43,543
<i>an expert on human dismemberment,</i>

477
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:45,443
<i>have to pay $800</i>

478
00:23:45,476 --> 00:23:47,443
<i>to have myself virtually dissected.</i>

479
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,410
<i>Check out this brain.</i>

480
00:23:58,443 --> 00:24:01,442
<i>This one belonged to a serial
killer executed last month.</i>

481
00:24:01,443 --> 00:24:03,310
<i>Killed 11 women.</i>

482
00:24:03,343 --> 00:24:05,943
<i>Then he really snapped.</i>

483
00:24:05,976 --> 00:24:09,376
<i>Killed his wife, two kids,
and the neighbor's dog.</i>

484
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,510
<i>Why are you showing me this?</i>

485
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:13,043
<i>Look.</i>

486
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:14,695
<i>How much smaller the
right hemisphere is.</i>

487
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:18,343
<i>This guy sure doesn't process
a lot of emotions, huh?</i>

488
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:21,443
<i>And you see all this activity
in the sub-cortex region?</i>

489
00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:22,810
<i>That's where feelings of aggression</i>

490
00:24:22,843 --> 00:24:24,376
<i>and violence come from.</i>

491
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:26,543
<i>- Why are you--
- Because.</i>

492
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:28,509
<i>Look.</i>

493
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:31,409
<i>It's exactly the same
as your brain, Dex.</i>

494
00:24:44,477 --> 00:24:47,410
Freebo's final resting place.

495
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:50,343
How?

496
00:24:53,276 --> 00:24:54,776
They dig the graves the day before,

497
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:56,810
they place a tarp over each one.

498
00:24:57,343 --> 00:24:59,142
It wasn't that hard

499
00:24:59,176 --> 00:25:01,242
to bring Freebo here late at night,

500
00:25:01,276 --> 00:25:03,109
find an open grave to place his body in,

501
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:04,043
and then to...

502
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:05,843
Cover it up with a foot of dirt.

503
00:25:05,876 --> 00:25:06,876
And then the next day,

504
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:09,810
they lower a 500 pound
casket on top of him,

505
00:25:09,843 --> 00:25:11,743
cover it all up with dirt.

506
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:13,209
Hiding a body in a cemetery.

507
00:25:13,242 --> 00:25:14,376
You're fucking brilliant.

508
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:18,310
I'll just get a judge to issue

509
00:25:18,343 --> 00:25:20,243
an exhumation order
now, and then we--

510
00:25:20,276 --> 00:25:22,443
I need you to not do that.

511
00:25:22,476 --> 00:25:24,443
Look, I've never done this before.

512
00:25:24,476 --> 00:25:26,609
I don't know what kind of
evidence I left on the body.

513
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:27,576
Hair, and fibers...

514
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,943
I can't have it traced back to me.

515
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:31,242
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

516
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:38,576
It does leave us with
our next little problem.

517
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,110
What is that?

518
00:25:40,143 --> 00:25:41,643
Well, we still have someone out there

519
00:25:41,676 --> 00:25:44,142
skinning and killing people.

520
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:44,976
Yes, we do.

521
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:47,043
And your homicide squad,
they think it's Freebo,

522
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:48,477
and they're wasting time and energy

523
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,409
looking for a dead man,

524
00:25:50,443 --> 00:25:52,276
When...

525
00:25:52,309 --> 00:25:53,543
The real killer, whoever that might be,

526
00:25:53,576 --> 00:25:54,977
is out there walking free.

527
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,676
Well how's that our problem?

528
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:59,409
Because justice isn't being served.

529
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:01,309
Of course.

530
00:26:01,343 --> 00:26:03,343
- Of course.
- We have to...

531
00:26:03,376 --> 00:26:05,776
Steer the police in the right direction.

532
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,209
How do we do this?

533
00:26:08,176 --> 00:26:10,976
I don't have a fucking clue.

534
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,210
<i>But I've got a feeling you're not going</i>

535
00:26:12,243 --> 00:26:14,276
<i>to leave me alone until
we figure this out.</i>

536
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,576
<i>Together.</i>

537
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,509
What do you think about cowboys?

538
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:25,743
Rugged American heroes?

539
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,010
No, I meant for the baby's room.

540
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:32,209
Nice.

541
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:35,077
We can do something
different if you want.

542
00:26:36,343 --> 00:26:38,476
Yeah, cowboys are...

543
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,876
Fine.

544
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:52,043
Hey, are you ready to
go to that yoga class?

545
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:54,176
Sure.

546
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,876
Astor! Cody!

547
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,876
Come on. Let's go.

548
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:14,376
<i>Nathan Marten.</i>

549
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,743
<i>As the sun begins to set,</i>

550
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:21,143
<i>the lowly scavengers reveal themselves.</i>

551
00:27:21,676 --> 00:27:23,710
Hey, it's the Cheerios man.

552
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,877
Who?

553
00:27:26,634 --> 00:27:28,667
The guy from the grocery store.

554
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:31,643
What guy?

555
00:27:31,676 --> 00:27:33,043
The man who talked to me.

556
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:34,343
Dexter knows.

557
00:27:36,525 --> 00:27:37,792
Who is he?

558
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:41,710
He's no one to be concerned about.

559
00:27:43,587 --> 00:27:45,120
<i>Because in a land of predators,</i>

560
00:27:45,153 --> 00:27:48,686
<i>A lion never fears the jackal.</i>

561
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:56,742
And here we go;
into another warrior pose.

562
00:27:56,776 --> 00:28:00,009
Feel your hips open up.

563
00:28:00,043 --> 00:28:02,243
We are strong warriors.

564
00:28:02,276 --> 00:28:02,943
All of us.

565
00:28:02,977 --> 00:28:04,876
<i>This is absolutely, without a doubt,</i>

566
00:28:05,409 --> 00:28:07,077
<i>The worst moment of my life.</i>

567
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:10,010
Now let's go into a little free-form yoga.

568
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:13,543
Just let yourself dance.

569
00:28:13,576 --> 00:28:15,642
<i>I was wrong. This is.</i>

570
00:28:15,676 --> 00:28:20,010
See the dust dancing
against the sunlight.

571
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:27,943
Be as beautiful as the
golden flakes of dust, Dexter.

572
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,743
<i>I could probably kill her before
anyone realized what happened.</i>

573
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,643
Excellent.

574
00:28:34,676 --> 00:28:39,443
Now I want all the partners to
turn and face their pregnant women.

575
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:42,109
Take your hand and
place it on her belly.

576
00:28:43,709 --> 00:28:45,376
And I want you to send all

577
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:49,276
of your positive intentions
to your unborn baby.

578
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:52,776
<i>I'm sorry.
I just don't want to hurt you.</i>

579
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,010
Good morning.

580
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,210
Mr. Prado, are you satisfied with
the sentencing of Chicky Hines?

581
00:29:16,243 --> 00:29:17,243
I am.

582
00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:18,510
I pushed for the maximum on this case,

583
00:29:18,543 --> 00:29:20,810
And I got it, and for just cause.

584
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,876
With Mr. Hines behind
bars for a very long time,

585
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:26,077
I'm hoping that the
families of his victims

586
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:27,509
can finally find some peace.

587
00:29:27,543 --> 00:29:28,543
Thank you.

588
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:31,509
- Miguel.
- Maria.

589
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:33,176
Another win for our team, huh?

590
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,710
I have to admit, I'm a little confused.

591
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:38,577
What happened with
the witness I gave you?

592
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:41,177
I thought he had information
that exonerated Chicky Hines?

593
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:44,443
I reviewed his statement,
it just didn't add up.

594
00:29:45,976 --> 00:29:49,242
I thought it had at least
merited a conversation with him.

595
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:53,076
I see this kind of stuff
all the time, Maria.

596
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,643
And I know you do too.

597
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:56,210
Scumbags trying to play the system,

598
00:29:56,243 --> 00:29:58,743
doing whatever they
can to stay out of jail.

599
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:03,943
Trust me on this one, hm?

600
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:06,743
Ms. Wolf, do you have a statement?

601
00:30:06,776 --> 00:30:08,943
Yes, I imagine the assistant
district attorney Prado,

602
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,043
is going to go home now

603
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:13,609
and uh... strip down to his
American flag underwear,

604
00:30:13,642 --> 00:30:16,009
and pour himself maybe a
nice crime-fighting drink.

605
00:30:16,043 --> 00:30:17,977
Make a few fund-raising phone calls

606
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,243
for his upcoming run for D.A.

607
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,477
But the truth is...

608
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,276
He just sent an innocent man to prison.

609
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:26,209
For 20 years.

610
00:30:26,542 --> 00:30:29,576
Ugh, he should be ashamed of himself.

611
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,009
It's despicable.

612
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:40,376
Someone's got to know who she is.

613
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,276
No luck?

614
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,843
I'm thinking of putting
her picture on milk cartons.

615
00:30:46,743 --> 00:30:48,043
Not a bad idea.

616
00:30:48,077 --> 00:30:50,409
Yeah, except nobody would
ever drink milk again.

617
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:58,943
Why the fuck did you lock up my CI?

618
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:00,577
Why do you keep calling him your CI?

619
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,410
Is there something
you're not telling us?

620
00:31:06,343 --> 00:31:08,076
You're very curious
about me, aren't you?

621
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,742
Look at you, changing the subject.

622
00:31:12,276 --> 00:31:13,043
Hey, sarge.

623
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:16,843
Um, can you ask officer Morgan
why my CI's in lockup?

624
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,443
He was antagonistic.
He produced a joint.

625
00:31:23,476 --> 00:31:25,543
I warned him not to light
it or I'd have to bust him.

626
00:31:26,076 --> 00:31:27,477
He lit it.

627
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:29,643
I knew I couldn't back down,

628
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:31,509
or he'd never have to
cooperate with me again.

629
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:33,242
He practically arrested himself.

630
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:35,943
That makes sense to me.

631
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,276
- You got a problem with that?
- No.

632
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:39,543
Good.

633
00:31:43,643 --> 00:31:44,910
Cut him loose.

634
00:32:10,209 --> 00:32:12,276
Do I know you?

635
00:32:12,309 --> 00:32:15,276
We met at the grocery
store the other day.

636
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,343
I don't recall.

637
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:21,842
You asked my girlfriend's daughter
to help you find the Cheerios.

638
00:32:21,843 --> 00:32:24,810
Oh. Right, right, right.

639
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:25,642
So what can I do for you?

640
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:26,876
Shut the fuck up, Nathan.

641
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,310
Stay away from my kids.

642
00:32:30,343 --> 00:32:31,642
What?

643
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:34,043
Sorry, buddy, you got the wrong idea.

644
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:36,043
I saw you at the beach
yesterday with your camera.

645
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,876
I'm a photographer.

646
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:40,543
I always have a camera with me.

647
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:43,176
I know who you are.

648
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,477
I know what you are.

649
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,876
Once.

650
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:50,176
Once I made a horrible mistake.

651
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,909
And I paid the price for it.

652
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:54,476
I did my time.

653
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:57,276
But I'm not like that anymore.

654
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,909
I learned my lesson.

655
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:00,876
I've changed.

656
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:03,709
You haven't changed.
That's impossible.

657
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:08,742
We are what we are.

658
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:16,876
<i>Night.</i>

659
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:19,443
<i>Good for the hunter.
Bad for the hunted.</i>

660
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,143
<i>Nathan Marten.</i>

661
00:33:22,676 --> 00:33:26,043
<i>Is your past the
prologue to your future?</i>

662
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:28,443
<i>From the outside, he looks normal.</i>

663
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:30,176
<i>But like me, his brain is flawed</i>

664
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,676
<i>and he has a compulsion
he's unable to control.</i>

665
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:34,709
<i>We're really not so different,</i>

666
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,876
<i>Nathan and I.</i>

667
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:38,843
<i>Except that I would never hurt a child.</i>

668
00:33:38,876 --> 00:33:42,110
<i>Then again, Nathan has
never killed anyone.</i>

669
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:45,543
<i>Which means he doesn't fit my code.</i>

670
00:33:45,577 --> 00:33:48,076
<i>I have other problems to
deal with besides Nathan.</i>

671
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:02,343
<i>Miguel Prado.</i>

672
00:34:09,077 --> 00:34:11,243
<i>And Teegan Campbell.</i>

673
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:13,543
<i>If I take care of one,
I take care of the other.</i>

674
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:20,443
<i>It's a new day in Miami.</i>

675
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:23,043
<i>Perfect time to help Deb help herself.</i>

676
00:34:23,076 --> 00:34:25,609
<i>One of the things that
makes my sister a good cop</i>

677
00:34:25,642 --> 00:34:27,709
<i>is that she's like a dog with a bone.</i>

678
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:29,876
<i>Once she's got her teeth into something,</i>

679
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,310
<i>she'll never let go.</i>

680
00:34:31,343 --> 00:34:33,843
<i>All I have to do is
lead her to the bone.</i>

681
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,843
Hey, papa!

682
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:42,253
Oh, hi.

683
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:44,477
Oh, god. Almost forgot.

684
00:34:47,577 --> 00:34:48,577
Isn't it great?!

685
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:51,009
Nice.

686
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,410
Have you started
thinking about names yet?

687
00:34:54,443 --> 00:34:56,477
Not that I want to push
it on you or anything,

688
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,876
But, if you have a girl,

689
00:34:57,909 --> 00:34:59,809
Debra's a really good name.

690
00:34:59,843 --> 00:35:02,210
Deb, I should tell you...

691
00:35:02,243 --> 00:35:03,642
Oh, my god.
What happened?

692
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:04,776
Nothing happened.

693
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,210
It's just...

694
00:35:06,243 --> 00:35:11,243
I'm not sure I'm going to
be there to raise the baby.

695
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,609
What?

696
00:35:12,642 --> 00:35:14,477
I don't know if I'm going
to be a father to the kid.

697
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,143
Of course you are, you moron.

698
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:20,676
- Deb--
- Shut the fuck up!

699
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:24,043
How could you even say you're not
going to be a father to that kid?

700
00:35:24,143 --> 00:35:25,577
I mean, where would
you be without Harry?

701
00:35:26,109 --> 00:35:29,476
And he wasn't even
your biological father.

702
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:32,009
I just think I'm going
to be a lousy father.

703
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:33,477
I don't want to screw the kid up.

704
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,943
Would you please stop doing that?

705
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:36,976
Then stop saying stupid things.

706
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:41,277
I mean, first of all,
who are we kidding?

707
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,110
You're going to be a great father.

708
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,709
And second...

709
00:35:46,743 --> 00:35:50,210
And much more important,
big dumb brother of mine,

710
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:51,376
this isn't about you.

711
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:56,809
Who's it about?

712
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,776
The baby.

713
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:04,776
So it doesn't matter how scared you are,

714
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,776
how reluctant or
unprepared you might feel,

715
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:08,276
The baby comes first.

716
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,976
And that baby needs you.

717
00:36:12,176 --> 00:36:14,809
So you're just going to
have to set aside all of--

718
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,376
Holy shit.
That's my Jane Doe.

719
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:21,543
<i>It's about time.</i>

720
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:22,776
Are you sure?

721
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:25,376
Yeah, that's her.
Teegan Campbell.

722
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,510
It looks like her.

723
00:36:26,543 --> 00:36:28,243
Yeah, I gotta go, Dex.
This is big.

724
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,743
What's that for?

725
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:35,710
I know you, Dex.

726
00:36:36,743 --> 00:36:37,577
You're the best brother in the world.

727
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:39,876
And you can do this.

728
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:42,142
And if you don't trust yourself,

729
00:36:42,176 --> 00:36:43,709
trust me.

730
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:45,343
I'm the smart one in the family.

731
00:37:03,343 --> 00:37:04,477
<i>They look motivated.</i>

732
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:07,443
Anything?

733
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:09,376
Once Morgan here found out

734
00:37:09,409 --> 00:37:11,376
that Jane Doe was Teegan Campbell,

735
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,076
it was a quick step
to find her apartment.

736
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,243
And guess who'd been hiding out there?

737
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:16,176
Freebo. His shit was everywhere.

738
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,176
All kinds of fresh fingerprint evidence.

739
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,043
That's good.

740
00:37:19,076 --> 00:37:20,909
Fucking guy's got an airtight alibi.

741
00:37:20,943 --> 00:37:21,943
We checked the call logs.

742
00:37:21,976 --> 00:37:23,343
Freebo called Abby Wilson four hours

743
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:26,009
before the estimated time of Teegan's murder.

744
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:27,043
We followed up with Abby.

745
00:37:27,076 --> 00:37:28,243
Yeah, but get this.

746
00:37:28,277 --> 00:37:30,009
She's saying she spent
all day in bed with Freebo.

747
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:31,310
If that theory holds,

748
00:37:31,343 --> 00:37:32,510
that means Freebo didn't kill Teegan.

749
00:37:32,543 --> 00:37:35,076
And there are several
calls from this phone

750
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,043
to Teegan's cell after she was killed.

751
00:37:37,076 --> 00:37:39,076
Assuming Freebo made those calls,

752
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,410
he may not even know that she's dead.

753
00:37:40,443 --> 00:37:42,609
We know Javier was
killed by the same person

754
00:37:42,642 --> 00:37:43,742
who killed Teegan, so...

755
00:37:43,776 --> 00:37:44,776
He's off the hook for that as well.

756
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:45,976
I was just telling Miguel

757
00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:47,543
how we weren't giving up on Freebo.

758
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:48,676
Now I have to call him

759
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,609
and tell him that he's probably right?

760
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:52,143
Freebo's probably long gone?

761
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:54,518
Looks that way.

762
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,310
What is that?

763
00:38:02,477 --> 00:38:04,577
You stuck a piece of chewing gum on it?

764
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:06,742
I'm sorry.

765
00:38:06,776 --> 00:38:10,609
This is a deliberate insult
against me, and my people!

766
00:38:11,142 --> 00:38:12,609
Come on! Come on!

767
00:38:12,642 --> 00:38:14,310
Asswipe.

768
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:16,676
Who the fuck are his people?

769
00:38:17,209 --> 00:38:18,376
I don't know.

770
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:20,443
Little scientists, I guess.

771
00:38:22,876 --> 00:38:23,909
The lieutenant's right.

772
00:38:23,943 --> 00:38:25,276
We're starting all over here.

773
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,942
We need to get out there and
see what we can shake loose.

774
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,609
We're looking at two cases now.

775
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:34,043
Ramos, liason with tri-state
P.D. on the Freebo situation.

776
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,376
Quinn, Morgan.

777
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,543
You stay on the skinner.

778
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:38,943
And you need to mend
fences with that CI.

779
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:40,410
He's part of that world.

780
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,043
We need all the help we can get on this.

781
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:43,043
Okay?

782
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:53,043
Lucky break, huh?

783
00:38:53,076 --> 00:38:54,776
Seeing that flyer?

784
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,577
You make your own luck.

785
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,410
<i>And now that I've dealt with Teegan...</i>

786
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,776
Yep?

787
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:11,043
Hi, it's Dexter. Good news...

788
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:14,210
I was going to call you.
We need to meet.

789
00:39:16,143 --> 00:39:17,742
Uh... okay.

790
00:39:17,776 --> 00:39:19,009
Today, right after work.

791
00:39:19,043 --> 00:39:20,543
Under the bridge, near the beach club.

792
00:39:33,709 --> 00:39:34,909
Hey, Dexter.

793
00:39:34,943 --> 00:39:37,310
Miguel.

794
00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:39,076
So you said on the
phone we have good news.

795
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,043
Yes.

796
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:44,176
It was just the other
day that I was stressing

797
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,443
the importance of getting the police

798
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:49,843
off of the Freebo trail.

799
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:51,143
And today...

800
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:53,043
Suddenly...

801
00:39:53,076 --> 00:39:54,176
I get the word that the police

802
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:55,642
have done exactly that.

803
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,676
I don't know how you did it, Dexter,

804
00:39:59,709 --> 00:40:01,076
but I'm impressed.

805
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,410
Actually, it wasn't me at all.

806
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,642
It was my sister, Debra.

807
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:08,076
You're a little uneasy with
compliments. Aren't you?

808
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:12,243
We all need to be liked.

809
00:40:13,076 --> 00:40:15,876
I also notice that you always
have your guard up around me.

810
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:19,876
Oh... that's not true.

811
00:40:20,409 --> 00:40:21,943
Ah, it's okay.

812
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:23,676
Actually, it's a good thing.

813
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:25,676
I appreciate that you're a cautious man.

814
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,443
It's actually a very
valuable trait to have,

815
00:40:29,477 --> 00:40:31,410
especially considering
our circumstances.

816
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:33,742
It's just my nature.

817
00:40:34,676 --> 00:40:35,210
I just want you to know

818
00:40:35,243 --> 00:40:36,709
that you don't have to worry about me.

819
00:40:37,742 --> 00:40:38,809
We're on the same side here.

820
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:43,976
Honestly, I try to avoid
taking sides in most situations.

821
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:45,076
There you go again.

822
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,310
Always being careful.

823
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:49,976
Okay...

824
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:52,276
Come on.

825
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,642
I got a gift for you.

826
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,943
A gift?

827
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:02,876
You know when you took care
of my brother's murderer,

828
00:41:02,909 --> 00:41:04,809
You gave me, uh, peace.

829
00:41:04,843 --> 00:41:06,009
Now let me give you peace.

830
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,310
A shirt?

831
00:41:12,843 --> 00:41:14,709
The shirt.

832
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:18,009
This is the shirt I was wearing
when Freebo met his end.

833
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,477
That's his blood, right there.

834
00:41:28,209 --> 00:41:31,142
This shirt implicates me in his death.

835
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:32,943
Accessory after the fact.

836
00:41:35,909 --> 00:41:37,009
Why?

837
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:38,843
Because I trust you.

838
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:41,577
I trust you.

839
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,742
And I want you to trust me.

840
00:41:49,343 --> 00:41:50,577
Same question. Why?

841
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,577
Because I like you.

842
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,509
I like working with you.

843
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:06,577
You're a good man, Dexter Morgan.

844
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,243
Potencial.

845
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,742
You've got a lot of potential in you.

846
00:42:14,577 --> 00:42:16,677
Sometimes I think that you are
the only one who doesn't know that.

847
00:42:18,076 --> 00:42:20,110
So I'm going to be
seeing you again soon.

848
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:22,109
All right?

849
00:42:23,943 --> 00:42:25,443
Yep. Okay.

850
00:42:28,376 --> 00:42:30,476
<i>Is it possible I've
actually made a friend?</i>

851
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:33,509
<i>Someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?</i>

852
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:35,076
<i>Or am I being foolish</i>

853
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,809
<i>for even asking myself these questions?</i>

854
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:50,243
Hey, listen, if you've come
to arrest me, I'm clean.

855
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,710
I don't even have my cuffs.

856
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:54,376
Look... Anton...

857
00:42:55,209 --> 00:42:56,577
I feel...

858
00:42:57,609 --> 00:43:00,142
Not good about what happened.

859
00:43:00,176 --> 00:43:01,743
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

860
00:43:01,776 --> 00:43:03,676
Came on a little strong, didn't you?

861
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,643
Yeah, well you kinda pushed
me into it, didn't you?

862
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:08,610
Yeah, okay. I'll admit that.

863
00:43:10,909 --> 00:43:12,276
All right, so, um...

864
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:15,543
I feel not good too.

865
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:19,343
Okay.

866
00:43:20,776 --> 00:43:22,043
I've even been working on a song.

867
00:43:22,577 --> 00:43:23,843
For you.

868
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:25,343
Kind of an apology.

869
00:43:25,376 --> 00:43:27,243
No fucking way!

870
00:43:27,276 --> 00:43:28,742
Yeah, yeah. um...

871
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:30,110
It's um...

872
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:32,443
It's not done yet.

873
00:43:39,076 --> 00:43:39,876
Hey, you.

874
00:43:39,876 --> 00:43:40,943
Hey, Dexter.

875
00:43:40,977 --> 00:43:43,876
I was wondering if you were
coming by later tonight?

876
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,109
<i>If I do, it'll be pretty late.</i>

877
00:43:46,142 --> 00:43:48,200
I've got some work stuff
I got to take care of.

878
00:43:48,276 --> 00:43:50,010
Well, do you think
you could get a chance

879
00:43:50,043 --> 00:43:52,142
to pick up some milk for the kids?

880
00:43:52,176 --> 00:43:54,242
For their cereal in the morning.

881
00:43:55,976 --> 00:43:58,309
I'll try to remember.

882
00:44:41,477 --> 00:44:42,909
He wrote this for me.

883
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:44,709
You're the puta mala flaca?

884
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:45,943
Yeah, that's me.

885
00:44:45,976 --> 00:44:48,343
She's the skinny mean bitch.

886
00:44:57,509 --> 00:44:59,343
<i>So here I am again.</i>

887
00:44:59,376 --> 00:45:03,109
<i>Drawn to the house of a man
who doesn't meet the code.</i>

888
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,543
<i>But maybe there's another code.</i>

889
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:29,476
<i>A code that says,
"You've stepped uninvited into my world."</i>

890
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:36,043
<i>And that's a place where
I decide who gets to live.</i>

891
00:45:36,976 --> 00:45:38,142
<i>And who doesn't.</i>

892
00:45:42,077 --> 00:45:44,309
I am not like you!

893
00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:04,043
Nobody hurts my children.

894
00:46:35,476 --> 00:46:37,743
Milk.

895
00:46:37,776 --> 00:46:40,509
Thank you.

896
00:46:40,543 --> 00:46:42,077
You're welcome.

897
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,693
So how was your day?

898
00:46:54,326 --> 00:46:55,927
Long.

899
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,927
You?

900
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,192
It was good.

901
00:47:01,792 --> 00:47:03,953
Yeah, mine was good too.

902
00:47:03,993 --> 00:47:09,027
I took care of some stuff I needed to do.

903
00:47:14,426 --> 00:47:15,493
That always feels nice.

904
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,027
Just sending out my positive
intentions to our baby.

905
00:47:52,959 --> 00:47:53,960
<i>So there it is.</i>

906
00:47:54,493 --> 00:47:56,192
<i>I'm going to be a father.</i>

907
00:47:56,726 --> 00:47:58,893
<i>And raise my child.</i>

908
00:47:59,426 --> 00:48:02,726
<i>It's what any good man would do.</i>

909
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,660
<i>After all...</i>

910
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:07,681
<i>It's a jungle out there.</i>
