1
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,205
Previously on dexter...

2
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,840
Remember camilla from records?

3
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:49,709
She's in the hospital.

4
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,676
Lung cancer. It's terminal.

5
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,512
Dying I can do.

6
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:55,514
The pain sure is a bear though.

7
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:56,948
I'll bet.

8
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,617
My whole life I've been searching

9
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,653
For the perfect key lime pie.

10
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,188
How about you start work tomorrow?

11
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,356
I need an assistant.

12
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,758
Having someone I can trust is everything.

13
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,193
Barber, gianna here.

14
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:09,461
So happens--

15
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:11,863
Uh, I'm hungry.

16
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:14,266
Are you asking me out on a date, detective?

17
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,635
Anton is my contact.

18
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,136
I know how to work a c.i., quinn.

19
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,371
Skinner struck again.

20
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:20,939
The victim's name was wendell owens.

21
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:22,140
He was 15-years old.

22
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,075
I can't rule out that I put wendell

23
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,076
In the crosshairs.

24
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:26,812
He trusted me enough to cooperate

25
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:28,613
And look what happened to him.

26
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,815
Hey, look.

27
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:31,217
Don't beat yourself up.

28
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:34,085
Real reason she's blindfolded

29
00:02:34,153 --> 00:02:35,420
Is so she doesn't have to watch everything

30
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:37,722
She stands for get pissed on by people like ellen wolf.

31
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,425
Miguel has been playing fast and loose

32
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,760
With legal ethics for a long time.

33
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:43,795
Then you've set the stage for your smear campaign

34
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,063
Against a stand-up guy.

35
00:02:45,097 --> 00:02:46,832
You ever wanna hear the unexpurgated version

36
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:49,501
Version of your guy, come find me, okay?

37
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:50,335
We've picked up Ramon Prado.

38
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:51,403
For what?

39
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:52,071
Kidnapping,

40
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:54,573
False imprisonment and torture.

41
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,009
Internal affairs is investigating you.

42
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,077
And you're finally telling me?

43
00:02:59,111 --> 00:03:00,212
I'm finally telling you.

44
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,680
Do you wanna tell me why this i.a. chick

45
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,148
Is so gung-ho to bring you down?

46
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,383
Yuki and I have a history.

47
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,852
Hola, amigo.

48
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,220
I can honestly say

49
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,754
I know who miguel prado really is.

50
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:11,590
My first good friend.

51
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,259
And those are in short supply these days.

52
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,708
Dad?

53
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,010
You need to throw up again?

54
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:40,152
I'm feeling great, amigo.

55
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:44,456
How long till you're done in here?

56
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:47,259
Not long.

57
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,960
Hey, I'll wait.

58
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,673
We'll play a quick nine when you finish.

59
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:06,278
Work on that slice of yours.

60
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,555
Nightmare?

61
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:22,260
Not sure.

62
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:26,364
You ever have those dreams where you're exposed?

63
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,733
All the time.

64
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,837
I show up at school bottomless.

65
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,238
Body parts out in the open.

66
00:04:33,272 --> 00:04:36,441
Exactly.

67
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,643
It's an anxiety dream.

68
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,946
It's probably about the wedding.

69
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,648
That must be it.

70
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,151
It's a stressful time.

71
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,218
But, hey, we got each other, right?

72
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,660
Except I'm not stressed.

73
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:56,962
Not about miguel.

74
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,463
He hasn't seen what harry saw,

75
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:01,032
But so far he hasn't turned away from my truth.

76
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,534
He's embraced it.

77
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,536
There's so much to do to pull off this wedding

78
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,804
Before the baby starts showing.

79
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm good at taking directions.

80
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:11,211
Good, because I need your guest list.

81
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,412
And your head count so we can pick a venue

82
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,014
And give a budget to the caterer.

83
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:19,984
Well, there's deb and, uh...

84
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:24,689
Deb, that's it.

85
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:25,924
That's my list.

86
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:29,828
That's it?

87
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,663
What about your friends?

88
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:33,565
Angel, vince?

89
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,601
Miguel.

90
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,702
He's a friend.

91
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:39,638
See, you're on a roll.

92
00:05:40,872 --> 00:05:42,908
Just make sure you get names, addresses,

93
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:44,442
Spouses and plus ones.

94
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,545
Okay.

95
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,879
I gotta go.

96
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,214
They're moving camilla

97
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:50,282
To hospice care today.

98
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,850
I wanna stop by before work.

99
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,485
You've been going there a lot.

100
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,452
You holding up okay?

101
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:55,987
Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

102
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,890
Well, I know you two were close.

103
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,225
Just give her my best.

104
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,628
Mm-hmm.

105
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:08,033
Those closest to me have always resided in a box of slides...

106
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,701
Until now.

107
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,215
Ooh, how about we pop some wheelies, boys?

108
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:27,419
After all, it is the last ride of my life.

109
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,789
You'll be around a long time, camilla.

110
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,458
Sure as hell better not be.

111
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,429
You need anything else you just let me know.

112
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,463
Okay.

113
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,004
This--this is the room, dexter.

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,710
The room I'm gonna die in.

115
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,145
Sooner the better.

116
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,416
Well, it's nice.

117
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,551
It's got wallpaper.

118
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,088
That shoebox there.

119
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,591
Get it for me, will you?

120
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:16,935
I thought you might like to have those.

121
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:21,973
She loved taking pictures.

122
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:26,077
Documented every bridge game we played

123
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,213
With harry and doris.

124
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,649
Drove me batty with that camera.

125
00:07:31,683 --> 00:07:34,653
But it's nice seeing these now.

126
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:39,090
Dexter, the awkward years.

127
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:42,027
And now look at you.

128
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:44,429
Engaged.

129
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,366
Baby on the way.

130
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,036
I'd love to meet rita.

131
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,637
We'll make that happen.

132
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,607
And that envelope there?

133
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,179
Those are my funeral plans.

134
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,440
I thought I was organized.

135
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,351
Simple catholic service.

136
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,651
Nothing fancy.

137
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,490
It's all arranged.

138
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,627
What family I have left lived up north.

139
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:21,032
If you wouldn't mind calling the funeral director

140
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:22,634
When the time comes.

141
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,337
They'll take care of everything.

142
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:27,406
Sure, okay.

143
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,942
Isn't this a bit--

144
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:32,844
What, morbid?

145
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,450
Death will be mercy, dexter.

146
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:43,255
No more pain, no more chemo.

147
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,357
Just...peace.

148
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:49,794
And the best part?

149
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:53,698
I'll get to see gene.

150
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,841
I gotta get to work but I'll be back later, okay?

151
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,709
Don't forget.

152
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,780
You promised to find me

153
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:11,817
The perfect key lime pie.

154
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,556
Better move fast.

155
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,867
Where can I get a good key lime pie?

156
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,935
You can't.

157
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:31,136
They all taste like sour dog shit.

158
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,704
It's camilla's favorite.

159
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,773
How's she doing?

160
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:36,241
She doesn't have much time left.

161
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:37,342
You should go visit her.

162
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:39,311
I don't do sick people.

163
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,946
I can't.

164
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,548
Reminds me too much of mom.

165
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:50,255
What's miguel prado doing here?

166
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,658
He is pulling his brother ramon out of some deep doody.

167
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,894
We bust him for kidnap and torture

168
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,497
And he's just gonna walk right outta here.

169
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:03,535
Fucker's lucky he's got an a.d.a. in the family.

170
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,504
It was an off-the-grid investigation.

171
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,072
Is that what you call, "false imprisonment"?

172
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,508
I'm not gonna get railroaded for doing your department's job.

173
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,243
Ramon, if you don't take this offer

174
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,878
You're looking at jail time here, okay?

175
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,147
The prick isn't even pressing charges, miguel.

176
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,816
My detectives will!

177
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,217
Unless they know you're not walking around

178
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:20,218
With a badge and a gun.

179
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:21,987
What, I give you my shield and then what?

180
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,788
Tell me what the hell am I supposed to do?

181
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,090
Get some help!

182
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,326
Hermano.

183
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,095
You don't have a lot of options here, okay?

184
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,831
It's early retirement with benefits.

185
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,300
Union won't be able to do better.

186
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:37,102
Listen to your p.b.a. rep, will you?

187
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,137
And keep the prado name out of the papers, right?

188
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:43,208
You really wanna put sara and the kids through all that?

189
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:01,493
I'll deliver these to his captain, start the paperwork.

190
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,895
Appreciate the consideration, lieutenant.

191
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,664
Yeah, okay.

192
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,606
This really would have been bad for me.

193
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,444
On top of the ellen wolf accusations,

194
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,712
The chicky hines case--

195
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,614
Chicky hines wasn't personal, miguel.

196
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:26,719
Yeah.

197
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,754
Helping ramon,

198
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,289
That was personal.

199
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,390
Thank you.

200
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,101
Tense in there.

201
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:45,303
A lot tenser in here.

202
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,374
I gotta blow off some steam.

203
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:52,077
After work, you and me, we're gonna go hit something...

204
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,245
Hard.

205
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,446
We are?

206
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,747
At the driving range.

207
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:57,015
Golf, right.

208
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,917
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

209
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:08,827
So what, you and the a.d.a., you're pals now?

210
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,596
Yeah, we are.

211
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:15,367
Kiss-ass.

212
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,536
Another crack like that and you're off the list.

213
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,873
Family and friends...

214
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,543
I see these people everyday but if they really knew me

215
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,678
They'd hardly call me friend.

216
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:28,947
Miguel might be the exception.

217
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,383
So when I say the skinner is a top priority,

218
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,451
I expect progress.

219
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,120
Understood?

220
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,189
Now where are we on the national database?

221
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,824
We ran it. nothing came back.

222
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:40,559
Got a call into interpol too.

223
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,494
Should I invite quinn?

224
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,397
He's so tan.

225
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:48,166
First, someone loaned freebo some money.

226
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,602
And is willing to skin people to get it back.

227
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,338
That same someone is drafting off our investigation.

228
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:54,539
We are being watched.

229
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:55,674
Which is why I wanna use

230
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,342
Our c.i. more aggressively.

231
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,577
Wait, you mean anton?

232
00:12:58,644 --> 00:12:59,911
Yeah, we're gonna spread the word

233
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,680
That anton knows where freebo is.

234
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,115
You're gonna use him as bait?

235
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,016
Ramos, soderquist, I wanna put anton

236
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,318
Under surveillance immediately.

237
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:08,954
That's his name.

238
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,055
Soderquist

239
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,357
You're gonna tell him, right?

240
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,592
All due respect, sarge.

241
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:14,393
We tell him, he bolts.

242
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,694
Two of my witnesses have turned up dead.

243
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:16,795
You wanna see a third?

244
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,196
Anton's already got a target on his back

245
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,264
By helping us.

246
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,532
This will protect him.

247
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:21,700
Yeah, right.

248
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:22,801
Okay, look.

249
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,302
I'm gonna keep anton in the dock

250
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:27,105
For now but I want eyes on him at all times.

251
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,143
Understand?

252
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,511
Hey, deb?

253
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,712
What?

254
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,547
Are you gonna bring a date to the wedding?

255
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:36,882
I don't know, dex.

256
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,183
I might be too busy picking up pieces

257
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,985
Of anton's skin to even be there.

258
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,521
So you're a "maybe"?

259
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,523
Morgan.

260
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:45,423
Her.

261
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,625
Wendell owens's mom called.

262
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,893
Sounds like she has something on his murder.

263
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:48,860
I'll drive.

264
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,428
Do not invite quinn.

265
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,830
No quinn.

266
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:53,732
Yo, morgan.

267
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,599
Him.

268
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:55,567
Grab your kit, buddy.

269
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,668
We got a crime scene.

270
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,578
Fucking mess.

271
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,947
City pays for the tree trimming but not the clean up.

272
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,616
We all can't live in high-class neighborhoods, morgan.

273
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,853
Yeah, I'm sure you live in a real dump, mr. cadillac.

274
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,425
Ms. owens, I understand you have

275
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,960
Some new information about your son's murder?

276
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,495
Yes, I do.

277
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:24,496
I found this.

278
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,304
That's my card.

279
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:35,807
It was in wendell's shorts.

280
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,109
The ones he was wearing that night.

281
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,278
The ones he got killed in.

282
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:41,646
I am so sorry for your loss.

283
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,914
You stay the hell away from me!

284
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,253
I didn't mean to-- 
- you didn't mean to what?

285
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,088
You came to my house.

286
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:53,492
You talked to my son and I told you not to.

287
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,060
You gotta go back inside.

288
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,301
You led that animal here.

289
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:04,836
Right here to my only baby.

290
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:12,144
And now he's gone.

291
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,813
Wendell is gone because of you!

292
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,314
He's gone!

293
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:28,126
Marriage, children.

294
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,228
You never expect it to end in tragedy.

295
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,698
Unless you're me.

296
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,300
I want all civilians cleared off the street.

297
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,970
We're gonna be rolling out a body.

298
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,505
Lisa morton.

299
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,208
College valedictorian on her way to harvard business school.

300
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:45,811
Found the murder weapon.

301
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:47,279
Under the sofa.

302
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,181
Screwdriver's consistent with the wound.

303
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:51,616
The perp must have used it to jimmy the front window.

304
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,084
I figured the girl heard it,

305
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,086
Came down to check it out.

306
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,689
Took a swing at the perp, missed, knocked over the lamp.

307
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:00,826
The perp freaked, stabbed her, ran.

308
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,627
Apparently without shoes.

309
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,362
These are sock prints.

310
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:05,864
Socks?

311
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,432
Yeah, looks like he cut himself.

312
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,935
Or stepped on the victim's blood?

313
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,404
No, if it was hers

314
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,406
The prints would become less saturated as he ran away

315
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,441
And got back to the window.

316
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,277
But they're more saturated, see?

317
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,079
Blood belongs to our guy.

318
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,381
Fucking socks?

319
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,716
Run it through the criminal database.

320
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,851
See if anything gets kicked back.

321
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,452
I'll bet you a night of lap dances

322
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,855
I already know who did it.

323
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,890
Albert chung.

324
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,292
Got arrested six months ago on a b&e.

325
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,229
Knocked an old lady down some stairs

326
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:39,564
And he did it all in his socks.

327
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:42,801
Same old lady, identifies the wrong guy in the lineup.

328
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,136
Shoeless schmoe walked.

329
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,971
How do you remember that?

330
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,105
Wasn't even a homicide.

331
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,240
Chung is asian, bro.

332
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,009
He makes us all look bad.

333
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,010
And taking off your shoes?

334
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,112
Can anyone get more cliche.

335
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,047
Well, he probably did it to keep quiet

336
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:58,016
Or to not leave shoeprints.

337
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,619
So he leaves "softprints".

338
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:03,088
Freaking moron.

339
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,390
And asians are supposed to be smart.

340
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,661
Fucking albert chung.

341
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:12,397
Fucking albert chung.

342
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:16,701
Fucking albert chung.

343
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,905
First, an old lady, now a college valedictorian.

344
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,241
Well, we've matched his dna to the blood at the crime scene.

345
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,676
Mug shots on every media outlet.

346
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,744
Someone will turn him in.

347
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,314
First I got ramon drinking himself into a stupor.

348
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,417
Then I got syl nagging me for attention.

349
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,453
And I got scumbags like albert chung running free.

350
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,489
Well, the department's working on that last one.

351
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,424
And what if they do catch him, eh?

352
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,159
Then what?

353
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,261
His attorney got him off once.

354
00:17:43,296 --> 00:17:45,397
I'll lay you odds that chung walks again.

355
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,068
No.

356
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,336
You and i...

357
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,671
We should take care of this ourselves.

358
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,274
There's a lotta wrong in the world, dex.

359
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,843
Just ask lisa morton's parents.

360
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:02,047
Slice.

361
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,649
I guess it can't hurt to keep tabs on chung

362
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:07,219
If the police can't bring him in on their own.

363
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,287
Hell, let them have albert chung.

364
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:10,755
He's just the symptom.

365
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:13,458
We need to go after the root cause.

366
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,360
The one responsible for putting him on the streets.

367
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:18,530
His blood-sucking, soulless, defense attorney,

368
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:19,531
Ellen wolf!

369
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,903
She got her client off.

370
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,671
Isn't that her job?

371
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:28,907
Her job is to uphold the law.

372
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,443
But ellen wolf, she twists and bends the law

373
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,544
Until it's unrecognizable.

374
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,846
Has she, uh...

375
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:37,749
Ever actually killed anyone?

376
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,584
Chung wasn't the first evil fuck

377
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,086
That she put back on the streets.

378
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,255
The body count is piling up!

379
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,225
If she hasn't done the deed with her own hands.

380
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,460
Dexter, you're being too literal.

381
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,095
I don't think I am.

382
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,364
Do me a favor, okay?

383
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:54,266
Keep an open mind about her.

384
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,700
Let me show you some files.

385
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:56,768
No pressure.

386
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,870
Just research.

387
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,242
Move your back foot to the left.

388
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:16,221
Ellen wolf doesn't fit my usual code.

389
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,956
But in the interest of friendship

390
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,691
I said I'd keep an open mind.

391
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,793
Camilla's request for the perfect key lime pie

392
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,728
Is much less complicated.

393
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,664
I'm not eating this crap.

394
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,898
Get it out of here.

395
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,066
Get it out of my room.

396
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,334
All right, honey, it's gone.

397
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,002
Don't you worry.

398
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,638
She's having a hard day.

399
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,774
Got some news.

400
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:49,921
Bad news, huh?

401
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,356
Tumors worse?

402
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,159
No.

403
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,329
It's slowing, goddamnit.

404
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,800
Doctors gave me another month.

405
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:06,371
Another month of struggling to breathe,

406
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,807
Of shitting myself,

407
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:13,778
Of this stupid, fucking wallpaper.

408
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,814
I'm...

409
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,115
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,385
I already lived through this with gene.

411
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:22,988
The end-stage.

412
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:27,559
All I want is to be on the other side of it.

413
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,396
He at least had me.

414
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,298
You have me.

415
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,769
I'll bring you as many key lime pies as you can stand.

416
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,074
Gene wanted me to end his life, you know?

417
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:51,416
I would have done it if I could have.

418
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,085
It is kind of illegal.

419
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,788
It's more than illegal.

420
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:00,992
It's a mortal sin to us catholics.

421
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:03,528
One-way ticket to hell.

422
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:10,969
I can't take my own life either.

423
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:18,143
But...

424
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:20,445
You're not catholic.

425
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,114
No.

426
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,816
I'm definitely not catholic.

427
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:30,589
But I... I do live by a certain code.

428
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,624
Of course you do.

429
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:37,395
Harry...taught you right.

430
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:43,168
So what I'm about to ask you is...

431
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,240
The most terrible thing anyone could--

432
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:50,175
Camilla I don't--

433
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:53,411
Just...help me.

434
00:21:53,446 --> 00:21:55,680
Please.

435
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,554
You're strong.

436
00:22:02,188 --> 00:22:05,624
And a good friend.

437
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:09,961
No, don't-- don't answer now.

438
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,565
Just think about it.

439
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,554
She couldn't have asked a better person.

440
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,489
Taking lives is what I do.

441
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:41,459
But never someone innocent and certainly not a friend.

442
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:07,819
Get in.

443
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:15,160
What's so important you had to see me

444
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,561
At the ass-crack of dawn?

445
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:19,331
Do you have any out-of-town relatives?

446
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,333
Why, you wanna take a vacation together?

447
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,905
Okay.

448
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:29,508
What's going on?

449
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,581
I heard a rumor about you.

450
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:39,784
That you know where freebo is.

451
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,319
You know that I don't.

452
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:44,489
I'm just telling you what I heard.

453
00:23:44,524 --> 00:23:46,358
And the other cops heard it too.

454
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:51,296
Which means that the skinner will be looking for me?

455
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:53,398
Shit.

456
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,433
This shit is crazy.

457
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:57,269
I've got nothing to do with freebo

458
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,104
Except for helping you and no one knows about that

459
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,272
Except for the cops.

460
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:06,211
Wait, are you telling--

461
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:07,445
Am I being set up?

462
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,083
Jesus.

463
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,352
And here you are asking me about out of town relatives.

464
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,288
Everybody's got one. 
- so you want me to go?

465
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,856
I want you to survive.

466
00:24:21,994 --> 00:24:26,498
I don't wanna lose a good c.i.

467
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,433
Listen, you telling me...

468
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,570
Me leaving...

469
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,171
It's not gonna help you any.

470
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:35,407
I'll find another lead.

471
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:37,943
So I guess I should go.

472
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,244
Good.

473
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,783
You watch that mouth of yours.

474
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:48,453
Fuck you.

475
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:05,537
The code has always been my guide.

476
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,038
Why should this be different?

477
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,306
Taking an innocent life

478
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:10,675
Could be a dangerous precedent.

479
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,777
I can't just change the rules for a friend.

480
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,348
Or maybe I don't want to.

481
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:21,553
But I can honor miguel's request

482
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,854
to research ellen wolf.

483
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,524
Keep an open mind.

484
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:28,126
Murderers, rapists, car-jackers set free

485
00:25:28,161 --> 00:25:30,428
To commit more heinous crimes.

486
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:32,731
Maybe my code could include the person

487
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,499
Who unleashed them on the world.

488
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,276
Hey, you.

489
00:25:44,343 --> 00:25:46,077
Hey, did you get my messages?

490
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:47,979
The list. you need my list.

491
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:51,550
A.s.a.p.

492
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,019
Working on it right now.

493
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,721
Thank you, dexter.

494
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:01,459
We still don't have a head count,

495
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:03,461
So I can't start looking for a venue.

496
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,497
It'll all get done, I promise.

497
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,365
Just made an appointment with the florist.

498
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,501
We can drive by after caravan.

499
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:10,836
I'd be having a complete meltdown

500
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,170
If it wasn't for you, syl.

501
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:15,040
Believe me, I'm happy for the distraction.

502
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,274
From what?

503
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,409
You have such a charmed life.

504
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,544
On the outside, in front of company.

505
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,180
But miguel, when we're alone he's--

506
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:23,748
Syl, what?

507
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:27,118
He just...

508
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,287
He goes to this dark place.

509
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:31,389
I know he lost his brother

510
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,124
And now his other brother's in trouble but--

511
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,559
That would put a strain on anybody.

512
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:35,727
But he's being secretive.

513
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,995
He's never home.

514
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,030
He says he's with dexter, but...

515
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:40,265
I think it's a cover.

516
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:44,336
Are you sure you're not reading into it?

517
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,437
I mean, I went through the same thing with dexter.

518
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:46,771
He was disappearing,

519
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:48,006
Acting weird.

520
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,074
What happened?

521
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,343
He was--

522
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:57,716
He was...

523
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,151
Going through a difficult time.

524
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:00,852
Rita, tell me.

525
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:11,730
He was doing drugs and he was having an affair.

526
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,465
Dexter?

527
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,000
God.

528
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,035
If someone like dexter can do that--

529
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,370
Look, we hadn't defined

530
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:19,404
Our relationship yet.

531
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:20,405
It wasn't like you guys.

532
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:21,873
It was different.

533
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,909
But the important thing is that I confronted him,

534
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,877
We talked about it, and it actually

535
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:27,078
Brought us closer together.

536
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:29,781
You just confronted him?

537
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,583
Well, if you don't deal with your problems

538
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:32,984
They only get bigger, right?

539
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:35,820
Dexter?

540
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:38,489
Really?

541
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:40,959
I know, I know.

542
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:44,763
There's no way your nickname was worse than "fat-tista".

543
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,264
'cause "gianna" just rolls off the--

544
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:47,835
"va-gianna."

545
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,536
Okay, you win.

546
00:27:51,604 --> 00:27:52,571
Kids can be cruel.

547
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:55,440
"fat-tista", huh?

548
00:27:55,475 --> 00:27:58,810
You can call me whatever you want.

549
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,245
Ah, too soon.

550
00:28:00,313 --> 00:28:01,413
Ah, it's okay.

551
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:02,714
I'm very patient.

552
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,649
Actually, angel, i, uh--

553
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:07,819
I think you're great but--

554
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:08,820
But.

555
00:28:08,855 --> 00:28:10,522
I hate that word.

556
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,524
I like spending time with you.

557
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:13,758
It's all right.

558
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:15,560
You can say it.

559
00:28:15,595 --> 00:28:18,330
You want us to be just friends.

560
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,005
I.... I like our friendship.

561
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,306
You gonna make me feel bad for that?

562
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,374
No.

563
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,909
I like it too.

564
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:32,410
But you want more.

565
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:34,613
You gonna make me feel bad for that?

566
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,554
You rang?

567
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,989
Ellen.

568
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,091
I didn't expect you to come over.

569
00:28:46,125 --> 00:28:47,659
I didn't expect you to call.

570
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:53,331
So?

571
00:28:56,135 --> 00:29:00,972
I'm starting to think I'm too close to the prado family.

572
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,207
I know one side of them.

573
00:29:02,275 --> 00:29:03,775
Maybe there's more.

574
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,210
There is.

575
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,646
Such as?

576
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,614
Broad strokes?

577
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:10,882
Uh, missing evidence,

578
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,185
Witness intimidation, jury tampering.

579
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,053
I've got details. you wanna hear 'em?

580
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,122
You have proof?

581
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:18,356
He's a bad guy.

582
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:19,624
He's not a stupid guy.

583
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,966
He couldn't have changed that much.

584
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,702
Hmm, maybe he didn't.

585
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:32,270
My ex-husband was always a prick.

586
00:29:32,305 --> 00:29:34,873
I just didn't wanna see it.

587
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:39,311
It's a little hard to take in, you know?

588
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,278
It's about to get much harder.

589
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,781
That's actually why I came in person.

590
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:44,549
Miguel's on his way over here right now.

591
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:45,884
What?

592
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,719
Why?

593
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:50,522
To negotiate the terms of albert chung's surrender.

594
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:53,058
You're not representing albert chung.

595
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,092
Chung saw himself on tv

596
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,460
And called me.

597
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:57,362
I'm here as his counsel.

598
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,964
You call miguel prado a bad guy

599
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:00,632
While representing someone like that?

600
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:02,567
It's not my job to judge, maria.

601
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,035
Well, you're certainly judging miguel.

602
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,838
And if he ever gets arrested, I will defend him too.

603
00:30:11,077 --> 00:30:13,645
Fucking albert chung.

604
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,480
That dipshit's photo has gotten more prime-time play

605
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,015
Than any asian face in years.

606
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,216
Way to represent.

607
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,051
It also got over 600 tipsters calling in.

608
00:30:20,086 --> 00:30:21,720
Folks up in arms over this one.

609
00:30:21,754 --> 00:30:22,721
Hey, guys?

610
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,524
I need your addresses for the wedding

611
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:27,292
And I need to know if you're bringing dates.

612
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,728
Can we bring "just friends"?

613
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,530
I never bring dates to a wedding.

614
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:33,431
Best man always hooks up with the maid of honor.

615
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,566
The maid of honor is rita's daughter.

616
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,534
She's ten.

617
00:30:35,568 --> 00:30:36,735
Masuka's your best man?

618
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:39,037
I, uh, hadn't really-- why?

619
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,505
Are you asking batista?

620
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,773
'cause I'd be honored, hermano.

621
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:43,909
Um, uh, I don't--

622
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,045
I'm not having a best man.

623
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:51,216
What about ushers?

624
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,192
I need back copies of your reports

625
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:01,860
On the skinner cases.

626
00:31:01,928 --> 00:31:04,496
All of them.

627
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,331
You looking for anything in particular?

628
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,966
Something, anything.

629
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,201
I need a fucking lead, dex.

630
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:10,635
I'll be here all night if I have to.

631
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,037
Diligent.

632
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:13,872
Not really.

633
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,544
Did you ever...

634
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:22,646
You know, compromise an investigation

635
00:31:22,646 --> 00:31:24,549
For personal reasons?

636
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:26,992
Never.

637
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:29,221
Figures.

638
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,724
Where did you get these?

639
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:34,292
Camilla.

640
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,763
She's in a lot of pain.

641
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,667
Then I hope she goes fast.

642
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,536
Not likely.

643
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,143
Just shoot me if I ever get like that.

644
00:31:51,177 --> 00:31:52,144
Really?

645
00:31:52,178 --> 00:31:53,445
Hell yes.

646
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,013
I'd do the same for you.

647
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:59,651
Pull the plug, put a pillow over your head, whatever.

648
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,186
I'd never let you suffer.

649
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,488
You wouldn't, would you?

650
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:05,991
Dexter.

651
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:07,459
Will you bring the prelim blood report

652
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:08,860
On lisa morton to the briefing room?

653
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:10,462
Miguel prado's asking for it.

654
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,663
He's here?

655
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,665
He and ellen wolf.

656
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:15,400
To negotiate the terms

657
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,968
Of albert chung's surrender.

658
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:19,004
Wear your flak jacket.

659
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,941
I'm not interested in your terms, counselor.

660
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:25,043
Albert chung needs to turn himself in.

661
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:25,911
If you want albert chung I suggest

662
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,946
You get interested, counselor.

663
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,115
Preliminary blood report as requested.

664
00:32:31,584 --> 00:32:33,318
I'd actually like dexter to stay.

665
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,220
Ms. wolf might need

666
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:36,621
A forensics expert to explain to her

667
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:39,825
How hopeless her case really is.

668
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:41,293
Oh, please, do stay.

669
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:42,928
Dexter.

670
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:47,032
He wants me to see how bad ellen wolf really is.

671
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,468
This is me open-minded.

672
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:52,604
Go ahead with your terms, counselor.

673
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,973
My client requests the news media be present

674
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,741
And that he be allowed to make a statement.

675
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:59,644
He requests the charge be kicked down to manslaughter.

676
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,313
Hmm, you've gotta be kidding.

677
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,083
He also requests conjugal visitation.

678
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,519
Jesus, you have no shame!

679
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:08,520
And no case!

680
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:09,955
Run the evidence

681
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:11,289
From the crime scene, will you?

682
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:13,391
Blood at the scene belonged to albert chung.

683
00:33:13,459 --> 00:33:15,026
Dna matched his sample in our database.

684
00:33:15,094 --> 00:33:16,895
Odds are 170 million to one

685
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:18,363
That it's anyone but albert chung.

686
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,067
Mmm, it won't hold up.

687
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:25,170
You do know what odds are?

688
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:26,771
The jury won't.

689
00:33:26,806 --> 00:33:28,640
Not when I get done discrediting you

690
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:29,641
And your chain of custody.

691
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,409
I think we all know

692
00:33:31,444 --> 00:33:33,244
How easy it is to plant evidence

693
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:34,179
And, well...

694
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,780
You look the type.

695
00:33:35,815 --> 00:33:39,351
Do I see sheets of plastic in your future?

696
00:33:39,886 --> 00:33:41,887
Dexter's work is solid, ellen.

697
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,389
Your prosecutor isn't.

698
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,158
Walk in the park to discredit you, counselor.

699
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,125
Try it.

700
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:49,761
We're gonna add slander to aiding and abetting.

701
00:33:49,795 --> 00:33:50,729
Oh, I'm not the one on trial.

702
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,864
Oh, you should be. you should be!

703
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:54,099
Getting your brother off with a slap on the wrist!

704
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,867
Not to mention the chicky hines debacle.

705
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:57,335
All right, let's stay on point here.

706
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,871
if albert chung kills again

707
00:33:59,906 --> 00:34:01,773
While you pursue this bullshit, that blood is gonna

708
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:03,175
Be on your hands. or do you even care?

709
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:04,376
Like you do?

710
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,811
You spout off about justice

711
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:07,546
And the constitution

712
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,080
Except for that pesky part about everyone

713
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:11,550
Deserving a fair trial.

714
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,484
While you set free the scum of the earth

715
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:14,352
For a fast buck, right?

716
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,955
How many pro bonos do you take on, miguel?

717
00:34:18,624 --> 00:34:20,292
How many innocent people have you saved

718
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:21,493
From fascistic prosecutors--

719
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:22,661
Ellen.

720
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,129
Don't kid yourself.

721
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:25,096
You might as well be walking the street,

722
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:26,898
The way you make a living.

723
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:28,433
Okay, enough, enough!

724
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,172
Dexter, would you step outside, please?

725
00:34:34,207 --> 00:34:35,941
Yeah.

726
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:42,514
Miguel, you know that that was completely out of line.

727
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:45,584
I'm no fan of ellen wolf's, but all I see

728
00:34:45,618 --> 00:34:48,053
Is a defense attorney doing her job.

729
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,321
Maybe too well.

730
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:51,189
But I can't kill her for that.

731
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:54,526
Now I have to tell miguel no.

732
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,395
Not what he wants to hear.

733
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,132
You're going the wrong way, morgan.

734
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,566
I'm just grabbing dinner, sarge.

735
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,568
I'm gonna do some overtime on the skinner case.

736
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,871
What do you hear from anton?

737
00:35:05,905 --> 00:35:08,406
He's not answering his calls but I think he probably--

738
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:09,441
Yeah, that's good.

739
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:10,475
Okay, see you.

740
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,476
Gianna?

741
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:13,512
Hey, just heading out.

742
00:35:16,048 --> 00:35:18,884
A buddy of mine is getting married in a few weeks

743
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:21,453
And he asked me if I was gonna bring a date

744
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,089
And you're the only one I want to invite.

745
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,857
You're inviting me to a wedding?

746
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:28,660
Maybe you don't get the concept of friends?

747
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:29,828
It's not a date.

748
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:33,131
It's--it's a plus one.

749
00:35:33,166 --> 00:35:35,267
The wedding is beside the point.

750
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,402
It made me realize

751
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,671
That you're the one I wanna spend time with.

752
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:42,574
And if us being friends means I get to keep doing that,

753
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:43,909
I'm in.

754
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,712
This isn't some kind of weird end run is it?

755
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,848
Make me see how sensitive you really are?

756
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:51,650
I'm not all that sensitive. 
- yeah, you are.

757
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:57,756
I'm confused.

758
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,492
I'm--

759
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,427
Hand-holding.

760
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:03,695
So simple.

761
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:06,565
So intimate.

762
00:36:06,632 --> 00:36:09,334
So...uncomfortable.

763
00:36:09,402 --> 00:36:11,203
Sorry about the pie.

764
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,471
I was told it was the best.

765
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:13,772
Got five stars.

766
00:36:13,806 --> 00:36:15,708
Don't worry about it.

767
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:19,044
Until you find me the perfect key lime pie

768
00:36:19,111 --> 00:36:21,613
I have something to live for.

769
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:28,787
Dexter, I'm so sorry

770
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:32,858
For putting you in that horrible position.

771
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:36,127
Asking you to violate your conscience

772
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:39,397
Was one of the worst things I've ever done.

773
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:43,335
I wanna help you, camilla.

774
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,237
If I were someone else, I'd do it.

775
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:48,507
I know.

776
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:52,077
I should have thought about your past

777
00:36:52,145 --> 00:36:56,481
Before I asked.

778
00:36:56,516 --> 00:36:58,116
My past?

779
00:36:58,151 --> 00:37:02,387
I know your secret, dexter.

780
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:08,960
You think...

781
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:12,130
If you help me die...

782
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:16,201
You'll be like him.

783
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:18,303
Your brother.

784
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,772
Brian moser.

785
00:37:20,807 --> 00:37:23,308
The ice truck killer.

786
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:25,877
I don't have a brother.

787
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:29,481
You did.

788
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:34,753
I read your file before I destroyed it.

789
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:37,689
Your birth mother was laura moser.

790
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:42,294
When the newspaper said brian moser

791
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:46,064
Was the ice truck killer...

792
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,866
I made the connection.

793
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,202
Camilla--

794
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,837
It's all right, dexter.

795
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:58,076
I'll take it to my grave.

796
00:38:02,014 --> 00:38:06,651
And you could never be like him.

797
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,591
No.

798
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:22,934
I had a high opinion of you, deb.

799
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:24,569
Guess I was wrong.

800
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,338
I told you repeatedly to stay out of my shit

801
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:27,706
And you wouldn't.

802
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,775
So you told quinn I was investigating him,

803
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:33,145
He did what he does, and now the case is dead.

804
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,514
You chose the wrong friend.

805
00:38:35,548 --> 00:38:36,615
Hey, you're the one who fucked him.

806
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:38,483
Not my fault he didn't want an encore.

807
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:40,552
Is that what he told you this was about?

808
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:41,586
He didn't have to.

809
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:42,621
It was obvious.

810
00:38:42,655 --> 00:38:44,556
Little miss heartbreak

811
00:38:44,624 --> 00:38:46,224
Turns a cadillac and a fancy watch

812
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:48,527
Into a fucking i.a. investigation.

813
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:50,295
How is that even original?

814
00:38:50,363 --> 00:38:52,597
What an empty room your world must be

815
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:54,599
If those are the dots you connected.

816
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:57,169
I'm happily married.

817
00:38:57,203 --> 00:38:58,703
Seven years.

818
00:38:58,738 --> 00:39:00,572
Working on our second kid.

819
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:03,775
With zero interest in a waste of clothes like quinn.

820
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,544
Fine.

821
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,679
I really don't give a shit.

822
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,015
Well then give a shit about this.

823
00:39:10,082 --> 00:39:11,999
A cop's dead

824
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:13,084
'cause quinn cut all of the wrong corners.

825
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,052
I came to you for help

826
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,154
To get him out of circulation.

827
00:39:16,189 --> 00:39:18,356
You refused.

828
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:20,592
Next dead cop's on you.

829
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,267
A dinner party.

830
00:39:29,302 --> 00:39:30,402
Washing dishes.

831
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,270
It seems so mundane.

832
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:34,439
But it's oddly...soothing.

833
00:39:34,507 --> 00:39:36,875
Maybe this is what belonging feels like.

834
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:39,044
Keep this up, we're looking like dishpan hands.

835
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:40,645
I should add rubber gloves

836
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,914
To our gift registry for dexter.

837
00:39:42,949 --> 00:39:43,982
We can do that?

838
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,484
Oh, you can register for anything.

839
00:39:45,518 --> 00:39:47,886
Furniture, motorcycles, power tools.

840
00:39:47,954 --> 00:39:49,254
Power tools.

841
00:39:50,256 --> 00:39:51,556
Ah, jesus, sylvia!

842
00:39:51,624 --> 00:39:52,991
Come on, use your brains, baby!

843
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:54,693
We just got this thing re-stained!

844
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:55,760
I got it.

845
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:56,728
It's fine.

846
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,163
Yeah.

847
00:39:58,197 --> 00:40:01,433
Uh, why don't syl and I finish the dishes

848
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,901
And we'll put dessert in the oven?

849
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:05,203
And you guys pop a movie in for the kids.

850
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:06,805
Uh, yeah, sounds good.

851
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:08,540
Movie time, kids.

852
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:09,741
Come on, muchachos.

853
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:12,077
Uncle miguel's gonna put a movie on for you.

854
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:18,016
Sorry about that.

855
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,284
He probably invited you guys over

856
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:21,219
So he wouldn't have to be alone with me.

857
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:23,088
Things haven't gotten any better?

858
00:40:23,156 --> 00:40:25,991
Worse... after I confronted him.

859
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:27,459
Oh, no.

860
00:40:27,493 --> 00:40:29,694
He just completely shut down.

861
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:31,797
Now he can't even be civil in front of company.

862
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:33,165
I'm so sorry.

863
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,733
I never should have said anything.

864
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:35,834
No.

865
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:37,669
It's not your fault.

866
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:40,705
Maybe dexter's a bad influence on him?

867
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:43,074
I know.

868
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,376
Wishful thinking.

869
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,745
He'd be a problem I could actually fix.

870
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:54,052
He's going to bring up ellen wolf

871
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,987
And I have to tell him no.

872
00:40:56,022 --> 00:40:58,089
Can friends do that?

873
00:40:58,124 --> 00:40:59,524
So, uh, ellen wolf.

874
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:02,327
Piece of work, right?

875
00:41:02,361 --> 00:41:04,196
Go easy.

876
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,664
Be tactful.

877
00:41:05,698 --> 00:41:06,765
We can't kill her.

878
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,935
I see.

879
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:12,971
She's...just doing her job.

880
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:15,073
You should tell that to the parents of all

881
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,942
Of those people that her clients have killed.

882
00:41:16,976 --> 00:41:18,343
Yeah, I read about them.

883
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:20,011
I also read about the wrongly convicted people

884
00:41:20,046 --> 00:41:22,347
She got off death row.

885
00:41:22,381 --> 00:41:23,882
The defense fund she set up.

886
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,484
She's fucking with the system.

887
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:28,086
Eating away at it from the inside out.

888
00:41:28,154 --> 00:41:30,455
Control, dexter. that's what she likes.

889
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,558
And now she's trying to control me.

890
00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:35,193
Re-opening my cases.

891
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:37,729
Undermining years of all my hard work.

892
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:39,222
So this is personal?

893
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,133
Fuck yes, this is personal.

894
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:42,968
And it should be personal for you too.

895
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,437
As my friend I'm asking you to do this for me.

896
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:46,638
Sorry, no.

897
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,073
Well, then fuck you!

898
00:41:49,442 --> 00:41:51,409
She's fucking with my life!

899
00:41:56,716 --> 00:41:58,617
I'm gonna go.

900
00:41:58,651 --> 00:42:02,754
I've never been great at conflict resolution.

901
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:07,159
Not without a blade and several rolls of plastic wrap.

902
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,961
Did dexter and miguel have a fight?

903
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:11,530
No, sweetie.

904
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:14,533
Did you?

905
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:15,867
Uh, why don't you guys go get ready for bed?

906
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:21,173
So what happened?

907
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,074
You grabbed us outta there so fast

908
00:42:23,109 --> 00:42:26,578
And you've been grinding your teeth the whole way home.

909
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,079
I disagreed with him.

910
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:30,081
About the affair?

911
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:31,082
What affair?

912
00:42:31,117 --> 00:42:32,818
Syl thinks there's someone else.

913
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:36,321
He's definitely obsessed with someone

914
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:37,222
But there's no affair.

915
00:42:37,256 --> 00:42:38,590
And there's not

916
00:42:38,658 --> 00:42:40,325
Going to be one either.

917
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:41,259
What?

918
00:42:41,294 --> 00:42:43,261
I'm confusing my metaphor.

919
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:45,564
Well, friends fight sometimes.

920
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:51,703
I'm not sure he'd consider me much of a friend right now.

921
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:54,039
Hey, you're a great friend.

922
00:42:55,508 --> 00:42:56,109
The problem's his.

923
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,744
Well, either way,

924
00:42:59,779 --> 00:43:01,713
Life was good before him.

925
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:03,382
It'll be good after.

926
00:43:04,217 --> 00:43:06,285
It's all right to be upset.

927
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,087
I'm not upset.

928
00:43:22,235 --> 00:43:24,302
Yo, dex.

929
00:43:24,337 --> 00:43:26,872
Put me down for a plus one to the wedding.

930
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:28,940
The list. Right.

931
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:31,376
Hey, that's a plus one.

932
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,777
Okay.

933
00:43:32,845 --> 00:43:33,778
Sarge. 
- yeah?

934
00:43:33,813 --> 00:43:35,213
I think morgan needs an intervention.

935
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:36,181
She's been here all night.

936
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:38,517
She find anything?

937
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:39,351
I don't know.

938
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:40,886
She's waiting on you for the big reveal.

939
00:43:44,056 --> 00:43:46,892
Batista may be plus one, but after last night

940
00:43:46,926 --> 00:43:49,528
I'm minus miguel.

941
00:43:49,562 --> 00:43:52,164
But with or without my help, camilla's on her way out.

942
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:53,398
It's okay.

943
00:43:53,432 --> 00:43:55,033
I'm better off on my own.

944
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:58,104
I can't believe this jackass is still on the run.

945
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,944
You know, he kinda looks like you.

946
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:11,349
That--that-- That's called racism, buddy, so don't even--

947
00:44:11,384 --> 00:44:13,451
Oh, shit.

948
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:16,488
He does look like me.

949
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:28,934
I found a fucking lead on the skinner case.

950
00:44:28,968 --> 00:44:30,035
In the trees,

951
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:31,470
Right, so...

952
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:33,438
We've had our heads up our asses, sarge.

953
00:44:33,473 --> 00:44:35,373
We've been looking down at the bodies

954
00:44:35,441 --> 00:44:36,875
But no one has been looking up.

955
00:44:39,078 --> 00:44:41,179
How much caffeine have you had?

956
00:44:41,214 --> 00:44:43,815
A metric fuck-ton.

957
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,983
You should stop.

958
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:46,017
It's giving you tourette's.

959
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:47,619
Our second victim, right?

960
00:44:47,653 --> 00:44:48,653
Javier garza.

961
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:50,188
I'm looking through it

962
00:44:50,223 --> 00:44:52,324
And I remember talking to this george guy.

963
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:53,959
This tree-trimmer, george something.

964
00:44:53,993 --> 00:44:56,428
It reminds me of that fucking mess

965
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:58,296
At lorna owen's house, right?

966
00:44:58,331 --> 00:45:00,399
Where somebody had trimmed the trees

967
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,900
And they didn't bother to clean it up.

968
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:04,336
So I'm thinking, "trimmed trees.

969
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,537
Tree-trimmer."

970
00:45:05,605 --> 00:45:07,272
Maybe there's a connection?

971
00:45:07,306 --> 00:45:08,340
Okay.

972
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:12,444
So I looked through every fucking photo

973
00:45:12,478 --> 00:45:15,380
Of every fucking crime scene and guess what I found?

974
00:45:15,414 --> 00:45:16,481
Trimmed trees?

975
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:20,585
No, I didn't find shit.

976
00:45:20,653 --> 00:45:24,189
But when I looked at the homes of the victims--

977
00:45:24,223 --> 00:45:26,925
Motherfucking trimmed trees.

978
00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:28,660
The skinner is using tree-trimming

979
00:45:28,694 --> 00:45:29,928
As a cover for surveillance.

980
00:45:29,996 --> 00:45:32,264
He watches from the trees and when the time is right

981
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:33,131
He grabs them.

982
00:45:34,166 --> 00:45:36,067
Tree-trimmers, landscapers...

983
00:45:36,102 --> 00:45:37,202
Blends right in.

984
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:43,008
Check city maintenance schedules.

985
00:45:43,042 --> 00:45:44,376
Get sub-contractors names.

986
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,512
Anyone who's worked near any of the victims' homes.

987
00:45:47,547 --> 00:45:48,480
Let's bring 'em in.

988
00:45:48,848 --> 00:45:50,849
I still can't get a hold of anton.

989
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:52,517
I think he might have skipped town.

990
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:53,919
Then it's a good thing you found a new lead.

991
00:45:53,953 --> 00:45:55,453
Huh, morgan?

992
00:45:55,488 --> 00:45:56,988
Good work.

993
00:46:03,996 --> 00:46:05,597
Anton skips town.

994
00:46:05,631 --> 00:46:07,165
You find a new lead.

995
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,300
Pretty convenient.

996
00:46:09,836 --> 00:46:11,503
Up all fucking night.

997
00:46:11,537 --> 00:46:13,438
Nothing convenient about it.

998
00:46:13,506 --> 00:46:15,407
Not all of us cut corners, detective.

999
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:31,156
You haven't been answering the phone.

1000
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:32,891
I've been busy.

1001
00:46:32,925 --> 00:46:36,261
I can see that.

1002
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:38,096
I can also see that you're troubled.

1003
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,331
Yeah.

1004
00:46:39,365 --> 00:46:40,799
That conscience I don't have?

1005
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,634
It's been eating away at me.

1006
00:46:42,668 --> 00:46:45,537
I know.

1007
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:46,438
I'll turn my client in.

1008
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:47,739
Then I'll feel better.

1009
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:50,442
You're only half-joking.

1010
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,676
You wanna bring in albert chung

1011
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:53,345
As badly as we do.

1012
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:56,948
I'm here to help.

1013
00:46:56,983 --> 00:46:58,517
You can't.

1014
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:01,486
I can...if you let me.

1015
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:04,789
If I let you I'll be violating privilege.

1016
00:47:04,824 --> 00:47:06,892
Well, that's where the help part comes in.

1017
00:47:06,959 --> 00:47:10,061
See, I'm getting to know you and that granite set

1018
00:47:10,096 --> 00:47:12,631
Of ethics you've got.

1019
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:14,766
Couldn't crack 'em even if I wanted to.

1020
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:16,535
You know that about me, huh?

1021
00:47:16,602 --> 00:47:18,904
Yep.

1022
00:47:18,938 --> 00:47:21,206
But it's your job

1023
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,975
To make sure albert chung has his day in court.

1024
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,078
And it's my job to make sure that happens.

1025
00:47:27,113 --> 00:47:29,548
I've got several ways of doing that.

1026
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:30,849
For instance,

1027
00:47:30,883 --> 00:47:32,284
Sometimes I set up surveillance

1028
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:34,020
Outside his attorney's office.

1029
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:38,858
Only an idiot would ask for a meeting here.

1030
00:47:40,393 --> 00:47:41,660
Only an idiot.

1031
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:48,400
I am not good at this.

1032
00:47:48,434 --> 00:47:49,601
Letting people help me.

1033
00:47:49,635 --> 00:47:51,837
I know that about you too.

1034
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:55,907
Why do you think I brought the scotch?

1035
00:47:55,942 --> 00:47:58,711
Deb, angel plus one, vince

1036
00:47:58,711 --> 00:48:01,480
Maria laguerta...

1037
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:03,548
Doughnut guy?

1038
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:05,350
I see him everyday.

1039
00:48:05,384 --> 00:48:08,220
If you don't know his name, he's not invited.

1040
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:19,131
We can come back.

1041
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:23,301
Dexter, bring that girl of yours in here.

1042
00:48:23,336 --> 00:48:24,836
I'm here.

1043
00:48:24,871 --> 00:48:26,638
I'm right here.

1044
00:48:27,974 --> 00:48:30,408
It's so nice to finally meet you.

1045
00:48:30,443 --> 00:48:32,010
Oh, rita.

1046
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:33,712
You know, I've got it.

1047
00:48:55,668 --> 00:48:57,002
Hey, you came.

1048
00:48:57,036 --> 00:48:59,104
You called.

1049
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:01,573
What the fuck are you doing here?

1050
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:02,841
I live here.

1051
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:04,442
Not here.

1052
00:49:04,477 --> 00:49:05,410
Here.

1053
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:06,945
We thought you left.

1054
00:49:07,013 --> 00:49:08,413
We pulled your security detail.

1055
00:49:08,481 --> 00:49:10,115
I have two dead-bolts and a nosy neighbor.

1056
00:49:10,149 --> 00:49:12,450
I think I'm safe.

1057
00:49:12,485 --> 00:49:15,821
Well, you'd be a lot safer in chicago.

1058
00:49:15,888 --> 00:49:19,224
I didn't wanna go without talking to you first.

1059
00:49:19,258 --> 00:49:21,660
I wanted to say thanks, you know,

1060
00:49:21,694 --> 00:49:22,794
For giving me the heads up.

1061
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:26,665
I do get free long distance.

1062
00:49:26,732 --> 00:49:28,533
You could have called me from chicago.

1063
00:49:28,568 --> 00:49:30,769
I didn't wanna go to chicago, debra.

1064
00:49:37,577 --> 00:49:41,279
I know what you did for me.

1065
00:49:41,347 --> 00:49:45,851
And I know what it could cost you.

1066
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:49,187
And I know how badly you want your shield.

1067
00:49:53,025 --> 00:49:54,993
Not if it means using you as bait.

1068
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:06,471
But I'll do it...

1069
00:50:06,506 --> 00:50:10,175
For you.

1070
00:50:10,209 --> 00:50:13,211
I'll be your bait.

1071
00:50:36,803 --> 00:50:39,404
Thanks for coming.

1072
00:50:39,472 --> 00:50:40,806
You hear about albert chung?

1073
00:50:42,875 --> 00:50:44,309
Who hasn't?

1074
00:50:44,943 --> 00:50:45,913
You hear how they got him?

1075
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,782
No.

1076
00:50:50,817 --> 00:50:54,886
He showed up at ellen wolf's office for a meeting.

1077
00:50:54,954 --> 00:50:57,155
Cops got wind of it.

1078
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:58,256
Sent s.w.a.t. in.

1079
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:00,225
They did the whole shock-and-awe thing.

1080
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:04,663
Apparently ellen wolf was in on it.

1081
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,933
She helped get him into custody.

1082
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,405
You were right about her, dex.

1083
00:51:13,439 --> 00:51:15,140
I told you when we first met

1084
00:51:15,208 --> 00:51:17,209
I usually don't take no for an answer.

1085
00:51:17,243 --> 00:51:20,479
That's kind of a button with you, isn't it?

1086
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,548
It couldn't have been easy for you.

1087
00:51:23,583 --> 00:51:25,083
But a good friend--

1088
00:51:25,117 --> 00:51:27,819
A real friend does the hard thing.

1089
00:51:27,854 --> 00:51:30,090
I was out of control.

1090
00:51:30,124 --> 00:51:33,025
Letting personal shit cloud up my thinking.

1091
00:51:33,025 --> 00:51:34,261
You, you reigned me in.

1091
00:51:36,025 --> 00:51:37,261
And..

1092
00:51:39,332 --> 00:51:41,032
Well, friends fight, right?

1093
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,469
I guess so.

1094
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:47,539
They also apologize when they're wrong.

1095
00:51:47,573 --> 00:51:49,708
I was wrong.

1096
00:51:49,775 --> 00:51:52,043
I apologize.

1097
00:51:55,381 --> 00:51:57,482
We're not gonna man-hug, are we?

1098
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:02,621
How about a beer?

1099
00:52:02,655 --> 00:52:04,324
Yeah, I'll get it.

1100
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,260
Two bottles.

1101
00:52:08,294 --> 00:52:10,595
Am I really a good friend?

1102
00:52:15,868 --> 00:52:17,435
Miguel thinks so.

1103
00:52:17,503 --> 00:52:19,104
Rita

1104
00:52:19,138 --> 00:52:20,839
Camilla

1105
00:52:20,873 --> 00:52:22,207
I wouldn't know.

1106
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:25,277
I don't have a lot of experience in that area.

1107
00:52:25,311 --> 00:52:28,313
To ellen wolf.

1108
00:52:35,488 --> 00:52:38,156
Maybe with practice.

1109
00:52:38,191 --> 00:52:39,958
Hey, you wanna be my best man?

1110
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:33,211
Miguel says a friend does the hard thing.

1111
00:53:33,246 --> 00:53:35,247
I agree.

1112
00:53:35,314 --> 00:53:37,048
And I'm about to become

1113
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:41,553
A true friend to camilla.

1114
00:53:41,587 --> 00:53:42,988
My secret ingredient.

1115
00:53:43,022 --> 00:53:44,723
Sodium pentothol.

1116
00:53:44,757 --> 00:53:47,692
Coma in half a minute.

1117
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,263
Pancuronium stops her breathing and then...

1118
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:52,732
Peace.

1119
00:53:52,766 --> 00:53:54,369
For her, anyway.

1120
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:05,343
Dexter.

1121
00:54:05,378 --> 00:54:07,913
I have a gift for you.

1122
00:54:07,947 --> 00:54:09,881
It'll make you feel better.

1123
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,758
Thank you.

1124
00:54:31,871 --> 00:54:33,805
Are you sure?

1125
00:54:33,873 --> 00:54:36,875
I'm sure.

1126
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:56,228
You finally brought me...

1127
00:54:56,262 --> 00:54:58,930
The perfect pie.

1128
00:55:30,229 --> 00:55:33,598
I'll tell gene...

1129
00:55:39,272 --> 00:55:43,341
You say, "hello".

1130
00:55:46,712 --> 00:55:49,548
I'm doing a good thing, aren't i?

1131
00:55:49,582 --> 00:55:51,650
Then why does it feel so...

1132
00:55:51,684 --> 00:55:53,785
Bad?

1133
00:55:55,121 --> 00:56:00,158
I want you to know that you were right...

1134
00:56:00,193 --> 00:56:01,526
About my brother.

1135
00:56:03,461 --> 00:56:04,696
But there's something else.

1136
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:09,801
I killed him.

1137
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,608
It's good...

1138
00:56:19,111 --> 00:56:21,146
You did.

1139
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,730
All the lives I've taken, they've always begged for mercy.

1140
00:56:38,764 --> 00:56:43,702
I've never understood that concept until now.

1141
00:56:43,736 --> 00:56:46,304
This.

1142
00:56:46,339 --> 00:56:49,641
This is mercy.

1143
00:56:49,675 --> 00:56:54,045
But only for a friend.
