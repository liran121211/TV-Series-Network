2
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:47,430
Previously on Dexter...

3
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,754
Is this doomsday number two?

4
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:52,120
Travis Marshall.

5
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,587
Press reporter. You wouldn't
happen to know of any good spots...

6
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:57,454
...where we could get a
drink this evening, would you?

7
00:01:57,487 --> 00:01:59,454
Maybe I do.

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,954
These drawings...

9
00:02:02,988 --> 00:02:05,921
...they were Gellar's?

10
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:07,954
No!

11
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:10,954
Seems Brother Sam's not
a changed man after all.

12
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:11,954
Please get off the property.

13
00:02:11,988 --> 00:02:13,787
Not without our boy Nick.

14
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:17,420
You deaf?

15
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,187
See how easy it is?

16
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:31,954
Get out and start walking away.

17
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:34,087
One way or another,
Travis will lead me...

18
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,011
...to the one who
really deserves my table.

19
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:50,654
Most people believe
we have free will...

20
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:54,590
...that we all choose our path.

21
00:02:56,888 --> 00:02:59,988
Sometimes the path is clear...

22
00:03:02,687 --> 00:03:04,621
...sometimes not so much.

23
00:03:08,654 --> 00:03:10,587
Every twist, every turn...

24
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:13,587
...can challenge our
sense of direction.

25
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:19,387
But it's the choices we make when
we reach a fork in the road...

26
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,087
...that defines who we are.

27
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,187
Deb, I'm kind of busy. Can...?

28
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,420
Dex, I'm sorry, I have bad news.

29
00:03:30,454 --> 00:03:32,087
It's Brother Sam. He's been shot...

30
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,888
- ...at his garage.
- What?

31
00:03:33,921 --> 00:03:35,554
EMTs are working on him now.

32
00:03:35,587 --> 00:03:37,053
I'm on my way there.

33
00:03:37,087 --> 00:03:38,187
I'll meet you there.

34
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,587
No, wait...

35
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,654
Shit.

36
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:48,487
I think this will be
sufficiently tawdry...

37
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:49,587
...for our purposes.

38
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:51,988
Pay the woman.

39
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Ma'am.

40
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:05,988
We're almost ready.

41
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,420
About the woman...

42
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:08,554
She didn't die, did she?

43
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:10,888
No, but her arm is badly broken.

44
00:04:10,921 --> 00:04:12,020
I'd like to get her
some painkillers.

45
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:13,487
No, Travis.

46
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,554
But she's in agony.

47
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,721
She's a whore.

48
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,754
She's an unrepentant sinner.

49
00:04:17,787 --> 00:04:20,654
She deserves what she's gonna get.

50
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,320
Have you given her her mark?

51
00:04:22,354 --> 00:04:25,320
No, not yet.

52
00:04:25,354 --> 00:04:27,721
What's wrong with you, Travis?

53
00:04:27,754 --> 00:04:28,787
What do you mean?

54
00:04:28,821 --> 00:04:31,220
You're hesitating.

55
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:33,087
You're slacking off.

56
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,621
You better get yourself together.

57
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,153
You know what's at stake here.

58
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,387
We're the chosen ones.

59
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,153
We're the two witnesses.

60
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:41,153
But what if it's wrong?

61
00:04:41,187 --> 00:04:42,487
What we're doing,
hurting these people...

62
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:45,187
God can be wrong?

63
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,921
I don't think so.

64
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,888
Do what you're told to do, Travis...

65
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,888
...or you're gonna be destroyed
along with the rest of the scum.

66
00:05:06,954 --> 00:05:08,787
It's bad. There are
three entrance wounds...

67
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:10,420
...two in the chest,
one in the back.

68
00:05:10,454 --> 00:05:12,420
No exit wounds.

69
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:15,787
Bullets bounced around,
really tore him up.

70
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:17,754
Whoever did this to Brother Sam...

71
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:20,454
...doesn't deserve to live.

72
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,454
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

73
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,721
My job.

74
00:05:22,754 --> 00:05:24,020
I'm sorry, Dex, I
can't let you do that.

75
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,120
You and Sam are friends.

76
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:26,287
Deb, I'm fine.

77
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,787
Really.

78
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:29,754
The last thing you need
is another unsolved case...

79
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,787
...you need my help.

80
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:34,621
I need to do this.

81
00:05:37,654 --> 00:05:39,454
Hey, hey!

82
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:42,153
Somebody get this dog out of here.

83
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,187
I got him.

84
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,687
What do we have?

85
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:46,487
Register's clean.

86
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:47,988
Looks like a robbery gone bad.

87
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,654
Or Julio's gang finally
got even with Brother Sam...

88
00:05:50,687 --> 00:05:52,254
...for stealing Nick away.

89
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,254
I suppose it's too much to hope...

90
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:54,354
It is.

91
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,287
DVD's missing.

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,587
Whatever happened
to stupid criminals?

93
00:05:58,621 --> 00:06:00,020
They're still stupid.

94
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:01,654
We'll catch this piece of shit.

95
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:03,988
The likely shooter is
Julio's replacement.

96
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,654
Taking out Brother Sam
would be a good way...

97
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:07,454
...to boost his cred as shot caller.

98
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,454
See, Louis, the art of dusting...

99
00:06:10,487 --> 00:06:13,988
...lies in the caressing of
the powder over the print...

100
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,320
...so as not to corrupt it...

101
00:06:16,354 --> 00:06:19,554
...as if one was trying
to... get a nipple erect.

102
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,888
Like this.

103
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:23,187
What's the blood telling you?

104
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,354
The spray pattern suggests
the shooter stood here.

105
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,420
Bang, bang.

106
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:34,854
Victim stumbled to the car...

107
00:06:34,888 --> 00:06:36,354
...and fell here.

108
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:39,487
Frothy blood suggests
a tracheal hemorrhage...

109
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:43,187
...and the victim
fell to his knees...

110
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,354
...but the drainage from
the interior wounds...

111
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:48,487
...is pooled, not smeared...

112
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:51,053
...so he must have
rolled to his side...

113
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:55,787
...and the shooter steps
forward for the kill shot.

114
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:57,487
Bang.

115
00:06:57,521 --> 00:06:58,888
Victim rolls to his back.

116
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:02,554
That's how we found him.

117
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:04,721
The awkward position of the
body causes the bullet...

118
00:07:04,754 --> 00:07:06,120
...to miss the heart.

119
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:08,721
It's probably the only
reason he's still alive.

120
00:07:08,754 --> 00:07:10,687
Guy's a fucking rock star.

121
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,554
Hey, this is Miami fucking metro.

122
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:17,187
We're all fuckin' rock stars.

123
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,521
Harrison seemed a
little off this morning.

124
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:20,187
It's all right if I
check in with Jamie?

125
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,587
Sure.

126
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:25,120
The night Julio and his
crew came for nick...

127
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,587
I hit one of them
with a baseball bat.

128
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:29,754
He seemed like Julio's number two...

129
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:32,787
...which could mean
he's now number one.

130
00:07:36,053 --> 00:07:37,487
Blood.

131
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:39,721
If he's in the system,
I'll have a name.

132
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,754
We have a match.

133
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:01,621
Leo Hernandez.

134
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,554
Two felony arrests...

135
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,787
...as well as one for
failure to pay child support.

136
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:12,988
What are the odds you're
at your last known address?

137
00:08:21,754 --> 00:08:22,988
Hello?

138
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,153
Yes, hello, I'm calling
for Leo Hernandez?

139
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:26,187
Who is this?

140
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,988
The department of social services.

141
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:35,020
Ah, Lieutenant, I ran the
prints from the garage.

142
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:36,387
I got 12 hits on afis.

143
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,521
All of them work for Brother Sam.

144
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,654
Well, that really
fucking narrows it down.

145
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:43,187
Maybe one of his ex-cons got
tired of working for a living.

146
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,988
Yale, Soderquist, I want
statements and alibis...

147
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,287
...from everyone on
the garage payroll.

148
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,354
Yeah, I'm sorry.

149
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:50,420
He sounds like a
horrible baby-daddy.

150
00:08:50,454 --> 00:08:52,754
You and your children
deserve better.

151
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:54,754
She hasn't seen Leo in over a year.

152
00:08:54,787 --> 00:08:56,354
Now what?

153
00:08:56,387 --> 00:08:59,287
So I couldn't find his broke ass.

154
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,754
Any news on Brother Sam's condition?

155
00:09:03,787 --> 00:09:05,854
Last I heard, he
was still in surgery.

156
00:09:05,888 --> 00:09:08,821
Hey, I got something.

157
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:10,787
Eighth street locos
blame Brother Sam...

158
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:12,621
...for the disappearance of
their shot caller, Julio Benes.

159
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,454
I killed Julio.

160
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:16,387
Is it possible this is my fault?

161
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,721
And according to this
report filed two days ago...

162
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:21,220
Brother Sam suspected the
locos of shooting up his garage.

163
00:09:21,254 --> 00:09:23,654
So maybe his motive was
revenge and not robbery.

164
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,687
Or revenge and robbery.

165
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:27,120
Hit the street. See if
you can't narrow it down...

166
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:28,153
...to a triggerman.

167
00:09:28,187 --> 00:09:29,320
Got it.

168
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:30,787
Deb, if it's okay...

169
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,387
I'm gonna swing by the hospital
and check in on Brother Sam.

170
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,387
Sure.

171
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:44,554
Hey, what's up?

172
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:47,387
Just... getting some rocket fuel...

173
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,654
...keep the engines burning.

174
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,120
Me too.

175
00:09:50,153 --> 00:09:52,954
Better get back to it.

176
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:54,888
Relax, I didn't come over
here to crack the whip.

177
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:56,387
I've just been going
so hard lately...

178
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,187
I haven't had a chance to catch up.

179
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,954
What's going on?

180
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:01,921
I'm good.

181
00:10:01,954 --> 00:10:03,954
Me too.

182
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,187
Can we... get back to work now?

183
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,220
Yeah, fucking go.

184
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:21,153
I'm taking a lot
of heat on doomsday.

185
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:23,187
The commissioner,
the mayor's office...

186
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,254
...the media are all over me.

187
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:27,554
Are we making any headway?

188
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:30,254
Quinn and Batista are
going through our suspect...

189
00:10:30,287 --> 00:10:31,988
...Professor Gellar's boxes.

190
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,320
I was about to get an update.

191
00:10:33,354 --> 00:10:34,854
Good, do that.

192
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:37,687
And remember, you're Lieutenant
now, not one of the gang.

193
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,521
I'm realizing that.

194
00:10:39,554 --> 00:10:42,387
Okay, well, I'd like
a briefing later today.

195
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,387
Okay.

196
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,988
If you're lying there because
of my dark passenger...

197
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,954
...I promise you, my dark
passenger will make amends.

198
00:11:07,888 --> 00:11:10,721
The lord is my light
and my salvation.

199
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:13,087
Hey, Nick, how are you?

200
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,721
Whom should I fear?

201
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:17,654
The lord is my life's refuge.

202
00:11:17,687 --> 00:11:19,921
Been trying to do good.

203
00:11:19,954 --> 00:11:23,120
How could this
happen to Brother Sam?

204
00:11:23,153 --> 00:11:25,087
It's a hard question to answer.

205
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,754
I'd rather focus on who did it.

206
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:29,187
One thing I ask of the lord.

207
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,333
This I seek...

208
00:11:32,954 --> 00:11:36,420
Is Leo Hernandez the new
shot caller for the locos?

209
00:11:38,487 --> 00:11:39,921
You here as a friend or a cop?

210
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:40,954
I'm not a cop.

211
00:11:40,988 --> 00:11:42,521
I'm a forensic analyst...

212
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:43,954
...and a friend.

213
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:47,621
And you and I both know the
locos wanted Brother Sam dead.

214
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:50,087
Where can I find him?

215
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,654
I ain't no rat.

216
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,888
If Leo shot Brother Sam, he
doesn't deserve your loyalty.

217
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:00,454
Come on, Nick, if
you don't tell me...

218
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,854
...the cops are gonna
drag it out of you.

219
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,888
I'll keep your name
out of it, they won't.

220
00:12:08,721 --> 00:12:10,754
He stays over on St. Andrew's.

221
00:12:10,787 --> 00:12:12,787
The white house near romaine.

222
00:12:12,821 --> 00:12:14,020
Brothers and sisters,
let us pray together...

223
00:12:14,053 --> 00:12:15,988
...for our friend Brother Sam.

224
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,554
Please join hands.

225
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,888
Please hear our prayer, lord...

226
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,420
...as we gather in your name.

227
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:27,053
Lord, we ask you to
heal our Brother Sam...

228
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:28,287
...and bring him back to us...

229
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,554
...because we need him.

230
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:32,487
He's your shining light among us.

231
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:34,787
He helps us see the way. Amen.

232
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,954
Amen.

233
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:38,487
And now in the name
of forgiveness...

234
00:12:38,521 --> 00:12:39,654
...let us say a silent prayer...

235
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:42,454
...for the misguided
sinner who shot Brother Sam.

236
00:12:46,521 --> 00:12:48,754
Anger won't bring him back.

237
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:52,254
I'd rather prey on him.

238
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:53,754
Here's where we are.

239
00:12:53,787 --> 00:12:56,854
Professor Gellar's former
T.A., Carissa Porter...

240
00:12:56,888 --> 00:12:58,454
The one you got the boxes from.

241
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,487
Right. She told us that Gellar
was working on a theory...

242
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:04,654
...about an early A.D. cult,
the Enesserrette, who believed...

243
00:13:04,687 --> 00:13:07,587
...that the book of revelations
was not only a biblical prophecy...

244
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,187
...but some kind of code to
bring about the end of the world.

245
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,787
I have no idea what that means.

246
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:14,354
According to Gellar's papers...

247
00:13:14,387 --> 00:13:15,988
...he thought he had
deciphered the code.

248
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,254
Seven steps or keys, each
requiring a human sacrifice.

249
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,687
We think that the
doomsday tableaus...

250
00:13:21,721 --> 00:13:24,487
...are an enactment of these keys.

251
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:26,787
Jesus.

252
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:28,320
I thought this crazy fuck
was trying to warn us...

253
00:13:28,354 --> 00:13:29,621
...about the end of the world.

254
00:13:29,654 --> 00:13:31,020
You're telling me he's
trying to cause it?

255
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:32,153
There's more.

256
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,754
We found a clipping from
a college newspaper...

257
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:36,220
...from a little over
three years ago...

258
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:39,621
...and it says that Gellar did an
artistic installation on campus...

259
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:42,153
...drawing attention to his
work on the Enesserrette cult.

260
00:13:42,187 --> 00:13:44,654
It got him in hot water
with the university.

261
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:47,287
The dead lamb
represents sacrifice...

262
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,754
...the naked chick represents
sinfulness, blah blah blah.

263
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,754
It looks like a practice
run for his current work.

264
00:13:51,787 --> 00:13:53,053
If we could find that
girl in the photo...

265
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:54,854
...who knows what she could tell us?

266
00:13:54,888 --> 00:13:57,854
Is that marking on her lower
back part of the tableau?

267
00:13:57,888 --> 00:13:59,521
Not sure. We just found
this before you walked in.

268
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,254
We haven't had a chance
to go over it in detail.

269
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:02,554
You got a magnifying glass?

270
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,554
Yeah.

271
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:08,921
Hm, looks like a tattoo.

272
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:11,988
One of those Hindu "Om" Dealios.

273
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Wrong religion, sweetie.

274
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:19,320
Good find, Deb. Um...

275
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,187
...we'll, uh, take it from here.

276
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,888
Oh, I can help if you want.

277
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,120
No, no, no.

278
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,954
Um, you've got a lot
on your plate, so...

279
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:27,087
It's okay, Deb, we got this.

280
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,120
We'll get back to you.

281
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:41,354
What?

282
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:43,754
The chick in the photo
is Carissa Porter.

283
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:46,020
What? Are you sure?

284
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,554
The tat above her ass?

285
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:50,087
I was in the vicinity.

286
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,053
Shit.

287
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:54,053
She just became our key witness.

288
00:14:54,087 --> 00:14:55,721
I told you not to go home
with her. Didn't I tell you?

289
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:57,153
Yes, you told me, mom.

290
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,621
The question is, what are
we gonna do about it now?

291
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,954
Well, we gotta find out what
else Carissa Porter knows.

292
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,053
That... that's fine.

293
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:03,521
But we can't let Deb
know about this...

294
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:05,087
'cause that could make
things a lot harder for me.

295
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,921
Lie to Deb? No way.

296
00:15:06,954 --> 00:15:08,754
Oh, so you're just gonna turn
your back on your partner?

297
00:15:08,787 --> 00:15:10,454
Oh, no, no. Do not
play the partner card.

298
00:15:10,487 --> 00:15:11,754
Of course I'm gonna
play the partner card.

299
00:15:11,787 --> 00:15:13,254
Why wouldn't I play
the partner card?

300
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,287
Situations like this are
exactly why the partner card...

301
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,454
...is in the fucking deck!

302
00:15:16,487 --> 00:15:19,587
I'm really not liking you right now.

303
00:16:15,888 --> 00:16:17,254
Deb, you got a sec?

304
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:18,521
What's up?

305
00:16:18,554 --> 00:16:20,721
Quinn and I have to go
to Tallahassee tomorrow...

306
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:22,621
...to question Carissa Porter.

307
00:16:22,654 --> 00:16:23,787
I thought you already
interviewed her.

308
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:25,754
We did. We have reason to believe...

309
00:16:25,787 --> 00:16:27,888
...that she's the naked
woman in the newspaper photo.

310
00:16:27,921 --> 00:16:29,354
No shit, how'd you figure that out?

311
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:33,354
Uh... just meticulous police work.

312
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:34,854
Fuckin' A.

313
00:16:34,888 --> 00:16:37,854
She's gotta be able to help
us get closer to Gellar.

314
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:39,687
But I can't spare you
guys for a whole day.

315
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:41,120
Have her come here.

316
00:16:41,153 --> 00:16:42,153
What?

317
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:45,254
Bring her into the station.

318
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:46,521
Oh. Um...

319
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:47,888
I don't know if she's
gonna go for that.

320
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:49,120
She's a Professor.

321
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:50,187
She's got classes to teach.

322
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,787
Fuck her classes.

323
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:55,854
She's a material witness in
a serial murder investigation.

324
00:16:55,888 --> 00:16:57,287
Tell her to get her
Om-tattooed ass...

325
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,754
...into this station
by tomorrow afternoon...

326
00:16:58,787 --> 00:17:00,954
...or I'll have her hauled
in here in handcuffs.

327
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:06,153
Try it nicely first.

328
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:13,420
Fuck.

329
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,654
What if Carissa says something
about our night together?

330
00:17:15,687 --> 00:17:16,687
I'll handle it.

331
00:17:16,721 --> 00:17:19,220
You just stay the
hell away from her.

332
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:55,320
Hi, Jamie.

333
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:56,687
Hi.

334
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,120
Harrison go down easy?

335
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:03,754
Totally.

336
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,153
We went to the park this afternoon.

337
00:18:05,187 --> 00:18:07,721
So it was like one page
of goodnight, moon...

338
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,654
...and then the sandman
dropped the whole bag on him.

339
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:11,854
You know, you don't have to do that.

340
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:13,888
Deb said she'd be by this weekend...

341
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:14,888
...to get the rest of her stuff.

342
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,654
Oh, no, I'm happy to do it.

343
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:19,020
There we go...

344
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:22,787
...all folded and packed
with very little hostility.

345
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:25,821
Guess I'll hit the road.

346
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:41,888
I heard about your
friend, Brother Sam.

347
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,521
How's he doing?

348
00:18:43,554 --> 00:18:46,621
He's, uh... in a coma.
Doesn't look good.

349
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,153
I'm really sorry.

350
00:18:50,187 --> 00:18:52,787
He seemed like a really nice guy.

351
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:56,587
Yeah, I didn't know
him... that well.

352
00:18:56,621 --> 00:18:58,821
It definitely sucks.

353
00:19:02,554 --> 00:19:05,854
Well, I'll... see
you in the morning.

354
00:19:05,888 --> 00:19:09,921
Good night. Thanks.

355
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:39,754
Why is it so hard
for you to admit...

356
00:19:39,787 --> 00:19:41,821
...you care about Brother Sam?

357
00:19:41,854 --> 00:19:44,087
It doesn't make sense.

358
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,020
Who is he to me?

359
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:48,220
A fellow traveler.

360
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:51,387
He was a killer at one time.

361
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,387
But he found a new path,
a path I could never take.

362
00:19:56,254 --> 00:19:57,888
It's because he's
traveled both roads...

363
00:19:57,921 --> 00:20:00,854
...that he understands
the darkness in you...

364
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:03,654
...and he sees the light.

365
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:06,721
I wish I did.

366
00:20:06,754 --> 00:20:09,220
Maybe things could
have been different.

367
00:20:09,254 --> 00:20:11,854
"What if's" are a waste of time.

368
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:14,320
I've accepted my dark passenger.

369
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:16,821
But there's more to you than that.

370
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:19,454
Brother Sam sees it...

371
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:22,387
...and he's helped you see it.

372
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,420
That's what he is to you.

373
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,320
So is there anything else
you want to talk about?

374
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:38,087
Nope.

375
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,754
You sure?

376
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:42,320
Yep.

377
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:44,354
Okay.

378
00:20:44,387 --> 00:20:47,354
Well, as far as the shooting at
Don Aldo's, you're good to go.

379
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:50,787
There's no need for
us to meet again.

380
00:20:50,821 --> 00:20:52,621
There's one more thing.

381
00:20:52,654 --> 00:20:54,654
Yes?

382
00:20:56,053 --> 00:21:00,220
I feel like my whole world
has been turned upside down.

383
00:21:00,254 --> 00:21:04,621
That's kind of more
than an afterthought.

384
00:21:05,721 --> 00:21:07,687
Go on.

385
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,087
For the first time, I feel lost...

386
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,721
...in a place that's
always felt like home.

387
00:21:14,754 --> 00:21:19,354
I look at my co-workers and I
see the doubt in their eyes...

388
00:21:19,387 --> 00:21:20,654
...and it makes me doubt myself.

389
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:23,787
I mean, they used to be my friends.

390
00:21:23,821 --> 00:21:27,153
Now they're my subordinates.

391
00:21:27,187 --> 00:21:30,287
It used to be simple.

392
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,287
I feel like shit about Quinn.

393
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,454
I think he thinks that...

394
00:21:36,487 --> 00:21:39,587
...I dumped him because I
think I'm better than him now.

395
00:21:40,821 --> 00:21:42,654
And I used to be able
to talk to Batista...

396
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:45,654
...but that's awkward because
I made Lieutenant over him.

397
00:21:48,487 --> 00:21:52,320
I still have Dexter.

398
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,354
We've always been close,
since we were kids.

399
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,120
But that's different too, because...

400
00:21:59,153 --> 00:22:01,320
...it's weird to be
my big brother's boss.

401
00:22:03,254 --> 00:22:05,888
I just don't know how to
act around anyone anymore.

402
00:22:05,921 --> 00:22:06,988
So don't.

403
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,988
What?

404
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,187
Don't act.

405
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,554
Just be Debra.

406
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:12,988
You're too much in your head...

407
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,954
...you're... you're
thinking too much.

408
00:22:14,988 --> 00:22:17,187
Just do the job, live your life...

409
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,287
...and give it all a
chance to sort itself out.

410
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,988
I don't know if I know
how to do that anymore.

411
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,687
What would you be doing right now...

412
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,821
...if you hadn't
gotten this promotion?

413
00:22:27,854 --> 00:22:29,320
If I wasn't Lieutenant?

414
00:22:29,354 --> 00:22:31,487
If I didn't have
briefings and reports...

415
00:22:31,521 --> 00:22:33,153
...and meetings
coming out of my ass?

416
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:36,420
Yeah.

417
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:39,254
I would probably throw
a housewarming party...

418
00:22:39,287 --> 00:22:41,387
...at my new beach house.

419
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:43,754
Well, that sounds
like a lot more fun...

420
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:45,254
...than worrying about
all this other stuff.

421
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:48,654
For a shrink, you're
not that annoying.

422
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:51,354
Thanks.

423
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:55,287
Not that you'd ever
need a shrink, but...

424
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,287
...you might need a bookmark.

425
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,654
I would guess it's obvious that
people who party all night...

426
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:19,287
...also don't get up in the morning.

427
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,187
But I'm finding it
very inconvenient.

428
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,787
Come on, Leo. Wake up.

429
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:44,988
Cops, man.

430
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,988
Oh, fuck.

431
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,821
Oh, fuck.

432
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:50,921
Fuck you, man...

433
00:23:50,954 --> 00:23:52,654
Hey, behave.

434
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,153
That's my little gentleman.

435
00:23:55,187 --> 00:23:58,888
Now I know the Locos are the
supplier for this neighborhood.

436
00:23:58,921 --> 00:24:01,787
And I'm guessing that you,
being a savvy consumer...

437
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:04,220
...have kept abreast on who's
running their operation now.

438
00:24:04,254 --> 00:24:05,554
I don't know shit.

439
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,020
I just don't believe you.

440
00:24:07,053 --> 00:24:09,754
I'm afraid you leave me no
choice but to flamingo your ass.

441
00:24:09,787 --> 00:24:11,153
Ass... what?

442
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:12,954
It's a Chicago thing.

443
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:14,387
It's ironic.

444
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,754
Because we don't actually
have flamingos in Chicago.

445
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:20,554
You actually have
them here in Miami...

446
00:24:20,587 --> 00:24:23,153
...and yet you don't
flamingo people.

447
00:24:23,187 --> 00:24:25,621
I'll catch you later.

448
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:28,821
Wait!

449
00:24:28,854 --> 00:24:31,888
Yeah.

450
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,320
The new locos shot
caller is Leo Hernandez.

451
00:24:34,354 --> 00:24:35,687
Drives a black muscle car...

452
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:38,153
...similar to the vehicle
I.D.'d at the garage drive-by.

453
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,487
Operates out of a house...

454
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,587
...at the intersection of
St. Andrew's and romaine.

455
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:43,587
I'll send backup.

456
00:24:45,821 --> 00:24:49,287
About time, Leo.

457
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:54,621
Police officer!

458
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,487
Hold it right there.

459
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,521
- He's coming out!
- Hands up.

460
00:25:05,554 --> 00:25:09,287
Gun! Gun!

461
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:16,587
He's down. Hold your fire.

462
00:25:17,687 --> 00:25:19,320
Get in to secure the weapon!

463
00:25:19,354 --> 00:25:21,754
- Clear!
- Moving in!

464
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,354
Is this the locos' shot caller?

465
00:25:33,387 --> 00:25:35,387
Yeah, recently retired.

466
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,554
Hey, Dexter, can I watch
you do the blood work?

467
00:25:37,587 --> 00:25:39,754
Louis, we're learning fingerprints.

468
00:25:39,787 --> 00:25:41,954
You're not ready for blood.

469
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:44,387
Come on.

470
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,187
Leo, you're not going
in my slide box...

471
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,621
...but justice has been done.

472
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,988
So why doesn't it feel better?

473
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:06,988
Think you got the right guy?

474
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,587
In the sense that he was
trying to blow my head off?

475
00:26:09,621 --> 00:26:11,621
Definitely.

476
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,521
As to Brother Sam,
I'll know when I find...

477
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:17,754
...the 9 millimeter that
put the holes in him.

478
00:26:22,888 --> 00:26:25,320
DVD player's on.

479
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:32,454
Security disc.

480
00:26:32,487 --> 00:26:35,454
From the garage.

481
00:26:59,454 --> 00:27:01,420
Okay.

482
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:03,721
It's not a slam dunk.
That looks like Leo.

483
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,287
He had on the same
sweatshirt when he was shot...

484
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,854
...he had the disc
in his possession...

485
00:27:07,888 --> 00:27:10,654
...and Yale has two witnesses
who say Leo was bragging...

486
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:13,954
...he was gonna "smoke
that Brother Sam".

487
00:27:13,988 --> 00:27:15,220
Sounds like it should hold.

488
00:27:15,254 --> 00:27:17,587
Good work, Mike, everyone.

489
00:27:17,621 --> 00:27:20,053
Oh, um, if you haven't heard...

490
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:21,854
...there's a party
at my place tonight.

491
00:27:21,888 --> 00:27:23,687
B.Y.O.B. Not because I'm cheap.

492
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:25,787
It's just 'cause I don't
have time to buy booze.

493
00:27:29,354 --> 00:27:31,254
This doesn't make
up for Brother Sam...

494
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:32,954
...but at least we got the bad guy.

495
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,954
Yeah.

496
00:27:38,454 --> 00:27:40,454
Something's not right.

497
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:47,554
Eli isn't barking.

498
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:51,487
If Leo were the man in the hood,
the dog would be going crazy.

499
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:53,787
The only person other
than Brother Sam...

500
00:27:53,821 --> 00:27:57,254
...Eli doesn't bark at... is Nick.

501
00:28:57,854 --> 00:29:00,687
I'm sorry, but the Professor
said no painkillers.

502
00:29:00,721 --> 00:29:04,020
Please just let me go.

503
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:06,487
I can't do that.

504
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:08,420
I have a son.

505
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:11,454
A little boy. He needs his mother.

506
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:19,554
Please.

507
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:22,287
I can tell you're a good person.

508
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,287
Please, help me.

509
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:39,654
Oh, well, look who's here!

510
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:40,888
Hey, Lisa.

511
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:44,521
Class, this is my brother Travis.

512
00:29:44,554 --> 00:29:46,320
Can you say hello?

513
00:29:46,354 --> 00:29:48,254
Hi.

514
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:49,387
This is such a surprise.

515
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,521
I mean, I mean, I'm... I'm thrilled.

516
00:29:51,554 --> 00:29:53,854
But you've... you've never
visited me at school before.

517
00:29:53,888 --> 00:29:56,254
Just needed to see you.

518
00:29:56,287 --> 00:29:59,053
That's music to my ears.

519
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:00,254
You wanna paint with us?

520
00:30:00,287 --> 00:30:03,420
Oh, no. I have to get going.

521
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:06,254
Come on. Class!

522
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:11,020
Travis is a very talented artist.

523
00:30:11,053 --> 00:30:12,220
Don't you think he should join us?

524
00:30:12,254 --> 00:30:14,721
Yeah!

525
00:30:14,754 --> 00:30:16,988
Okay, okay, just a little bit.

526
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Yay!

527
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,454
So what are we painting?

528
00:30:25,487 --> 00:30:28,587
We're painting what we're
gonna be when we grow up.

529
00:30:28,621 --> 00:30:30,988
I'm gonna be a nurse like my mom.

530
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,787
That's a great thing to be.

531
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:35,387
What about you?

532
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,020
I'm gonna be a transformer.

533
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,053
Oh, scary.

534
00:30:43,621 --> 00:30:45,654
Don't you envy them?

535
00:30:45,687 --> 00:30:48,053
So full of dreams.

536
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:51,053
And all the time in the
world to make them come true.

537
00:31:24,153 --> 00:31:26,621
The night Brother Sam carried
Nick from his apartment...

538
00:31:26,654 --> 00:31:27,988
Nick fired a shot at him.

539
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,988
From the couch, I'm
guessing, since he was stoned.

540
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:34,053
So the bullet should be...

541
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:40,721
...here.

542
00:32:03,287 --> 00:32:04,621
9 millimeter.

543
00:32:04,654 --> 00:32:07,654
Did it come from the same
gun that shot Brother Sam?

544
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:31,287
The striations match the
bullet taken from Brother Sam.

545
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,187
Nick shot Sam, the man
who tried to save him.

546
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,454
He's the ultimate Judas.

547
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,120
Thank you for coming down...

548
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:45,554
...on such short
notice, Professor Porter.

549
00:32:45,587 --> 00:32:47,387
You didn't give me much choice.

550
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,053
I hope you understand that...

551
00:32:49,087 --> 00:32:51,621
...we're trying to solve
a series of brutal murders.

552
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:53,687
Your cooperation is very important.

553
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,120
I don't see how.

554
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:56,921
I already told you
everything I know...

555
00:32:56,954 --> 00:32:58,354
...and I gave you Gellar's boxes.

556
00:32:58,387 --> 00:33:02,487
Professor Porter, are you
the woman in that photo?

557
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:06,287
Yes.

558
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,554
Why didn't you tell us about this?

559
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,354
Tell you the truth,
I'd forgotten about it.

560
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:15,587
Ma'am, you are lying naked
in the middle of campus...

561
00:33:15,621 --> 00:33:20,053
...with a dead sheep on your head.

562
00:33:20,087 --> 00:33:23,053
That's not the kind of thing
that just slips your mind.

563
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,954
Look, if that photo got out...

564
00:33:29,988 --> 00:33:32,954
I would look like a total
flake to my... the faculty.

565
00:33:37,053 --> 00:33:38,187
Quinn.

566
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,821
Why aren't you in
there with your witness?

567
00:33:39,854 --> 00:33:43,521
I had, uh, paperwork backing
up, so Angel took this one.

568
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,087
Paperwork?

569
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,020
She's a material witness in
the fucking doomsday murders.

570
00:33:47,053 --> 00:33:49,888
Come on, get in there.

571
00:33:55,087 --> 00:33:57,754
Professor Porter,
did you... do you...

572
00:33:57,787 --> 00:34:00,220
...share any of Professor
Gellar's religious beliefs?

573
00:34:00,254 --> 00:34:02,754
I didn't know he had
any religious beliefs.

574
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:05,621
He was an academic.

575
00:34:05,654 --> 00:34:08,888
Professor Porter.

576
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,921
Detective?

577
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,888
So that would be a no.

578
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:20,587
You're not a believer in
apocalyptic prophecies.

579
00:34:20,621 --> 00:34:23,153
Of course not. Look...

580
00:34:23,187 --> 00:34:26,153
I was just a prop. I was young.

581
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:28,687
I was trying to win
favor with my Professor.

582
00:34:28,721 --> 00:34:31,354
Well, kind of an unorthodox
way to go about it.

583
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:37,754
He was an unorthodox man.

584
00:34:37,787 --> 00:34:39,087
Has Gellar contacted you?

585
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,787
No. I told you.

586
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:43,687
I haven't seen or talked
to him in over three years.

587
00:34:43,721 --> 00:34:45,120
Well, you didn't tell
us about the photo...

588
00:34:45,153 --> 00:34:47,020
...so you can see how we
might be a little skeptical.

589
00:34:47,053 --> 00:34:50,087
What the hell is going on here?

590
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,053
You think because I
posed for a photo once...

591
00:34:53,087 --> 00:34:54,721
...that I'm somehow
involved in all of this?

592
00:34:54,754 --> 00:34:57,087
No one said anything
about you being involved.

593
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,621
But you're acting like
I'm guilty of something.

594
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,220
Not at all, miss Porter.

595
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:01,454
We're just trying to
ascertain the full nature...

596
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:03,120
...of your relationship
with Professor Gellar.

597
00:35:03,153 --> 00:35:06,087
I told you the full
nature of the relationship.

598
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,487
I was his T.A...

599
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:11,153
...and for a brief time, we
were lovers, but that's over.

600
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:12,387
Are you sure about that?

601
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,754
Jesus.

602
00:35:14,787 --> 00:35:16,387
If we were still involved...

603
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,220
...would I have slept
with Mr. warmth over here?

604
00:35:20,587 --> 00:35:22,787
Or are you implying
that I'm a whore...

605
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,320
...as well as an
accomplice to murder?

606
00:35:24,354 --> 00:35:26,787
Professor Porter, can we
just stay on the subject here?

607
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:30,687
No. I've had enough of this.

608
00:35:30,721 --> 00:35:32,454
I'm leaving now.

609
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:35,687
If you bother me again,
I'll get a lawyer.

610
00:35:35,721 --> 00:35:38,687
Good-bye, Joey.

611
00:35:45,621 --> 00:35:47,954
Leave us.

612
00:35:57,354 --> 00:36:00,787
Are you out of your mind?

613
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:03,487
You fucked a person of interest?

614
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:07,187
Who fucks a person of non-interest?

615
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:11,721
This is no time to be a smart ass.

616
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:14,454
I could have you fired.

617
00:36:14,487 --> 00:36:16,687
That woman was the key...

618
00:36:16,721 --> 00:36:20,087
...to interpreting all
of the Gellar evidence.

619
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,654
She's never gonna fucking
cooperate with us now.

620
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:23,854
Is that really what's bothering you?

621
00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:25,988
What? What...? What the fuck else?

622
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,988
Maybe you're jealous.

623
00:36:33,854 --> 00:36:36,988
Are you kidding?

624
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,988
I could give a fuck who you fuck.

625
00:36:40,721 --> 00:36:43,721
Just don't fuck with my
investigation, you fuck.

626
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:02,354
Well, I guess we're off.

627
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,888
You sure Deb invited me?

628
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,954
I really do not want to
crash a party with your son.

629
00:37:06,988 --> 00:37:08,387
Yes, I'm sure, have fun.

630
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,621
I'll be there later, after
I take care of my business.

631
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:11,888
Mwah!

632
00:37:11,921 --> 00:37:14,287
Sending Nick in pieces
to the bottom of the bay.

633
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,287
You wanna go to a party? Yay!

634
00:37:23,521 --> 00:37:26,287
Hello?

635
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,687
Of course, right away.

636
00:37:27,721 --> 00:37:30,487
Thank you for coming.

637
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:32,988
It was really important
to Sam that he talk to you.

638
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,587
This is good news, right?

639
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:37,921
That he's regained consciousness?

640
00:37:37,954 --> 00:37:39,888
Probably not.

641
00:37:39,921 --> 00:37:42,921
Doctor says sometimes people
come out of comas before...

642
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,087
...he doesn't have long.

643
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:57,888
Sam.

644
00:37:57,921 --> 00:38:00,921
I'm here.

645
00:38:06,354 --> 00:38:08,854
Don't worry.

646
00:38:08,888 --> 00:38:11,621
I know it was Nick who shot you.

647
00:38:11,654 --> 00:38:16,487
I'm gonna make sure he pays.

648
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,454
No.

649
00:38:20,487 --> 00:38:21,687
Don't do that.

650
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:24,687
I don't understand.

651
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:28,888
I want you to...

652
00:38:28,921 --> 00:38:31,754
...to give Nick a message for me.

653
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:34,621
Yes.

654
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:39,354
Tell him that I forgive him.

655
00:38:39,387 --> 00:38:41,954
What?

656
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:46,654
You're the only one
that I trust to do it.

657
00:38:48,754 --> 00:38:51,287
I didn't tell anybody.

658
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,721
The boys from the shop...

659
00:38:55,754 --> 00:38:57,721
...they wouldn't...

660
00:38:57,754 --> 00:39:02,220
...they... they're not ready.

661
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:05,888
You're wrong, I can't do this.

662
00:39:05,921 --> 00:39:08,320
You can.

663
00:39:12,454 --> 00:39:13,554
You don't know me.

664
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:15,888
Yes, I do.

665
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:19,587
I know about your darkness.

666
00:39:22,854 --> 00:39:26,587
I also see your light.

667
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:29,587
If there's light in
me, I don't feel it.

668
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:32,821
I just wanna hurt Nick.

669
00:39:32,854 --> 00:39:33,988
You don't know how
much I wanna hurt him.

670
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,053
You need to forgive him.

671
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:42,354
I don't know how.

672
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:45,387
Just let it go.

673
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:51,821
Can't live with the
hate in your heart.

674
00:39:52,921 --> 00:39:56,687
Eat you up inside.

675
00:39:56,721 --> 00:40:00,287
We gotta find some peace in life.

676
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Nick doesn't deserve it.

677
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:08,053
It ain't about him.

678
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:11,787
Dexter, if you don't
let that darkness go...

679
00:40:11,821 --> 00:40:16,020
...it won't let go of you.

680
00:40:16,053 --> 00:40:19,053
Let it go.

681
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:25,387
Let it go.

682
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:36,287
For you.

683
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,821
You can just put it
on the poker table.

684
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:41,153
No, this... this
is a special bottle.

685
00:40:41,187 --> 00:40:44,053
It's a housewarming/apology gift.

686
00:40:46,354 --> 00:40:48,287
I should have told you about
Quinn and Carissa Porter.

687
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,521
Yeah, you should've.

688
00:40:49,554 --> 00:40:51,988
I hope it doesn't
hurt us for doomsday.

689
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,320
Me too.

690
00:40:55,354 --> 00:40:57,120
Why can't you trust me, Angel?

691
00:40:57,153 --> 00:41:01,287
I do trust you. Of course I do.

692
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,854
It's just that...
Quinn's my partner...

693
00:41:04,888 --> 00:41:07,320
...and you're the boss.

694
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:09,420
I guess I haven't adjusted yet.

695
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:13,754
Well, that makes two of us.

696
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:15,587
It was the wrong way to go.

697
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:18,120
It won't happen again. Here.

698
00:41:18,153 --> 00:41:21,220
It better not.

699
00:41:21,254 --> 00:41:24,454
And this bottle better
cost at least $50.

700
00:41:26,821 --> 00:41:29,787
Not even close.

701
00:41:34,287 --> 00:41:37,087
Harrison's out like
a light on your bed.

702
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,821
But if that's inconvenient,
I can totally move him.

703
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:43,754
It's fine.

704
00:41:43,787 --> 00:41:47,254
Oh, and, uh, Dexter said to
tell you that he'll be late...

705
00:41:47,287 --> 00:41:48,254
...but he'll be here.

706
00:41:48,287 --> 00:41:50,287
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure.

707
00:41:52,787 --> 00:41:55,621
Jamie, I feel like we
got off on the wrong foot.

708
00:41:55,654 --> 00:41:57,420
What do you say we start over?

709
00:41:57,454 --> 00:41:58,821
I'd like that.

710
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:03,254
Then how about we have some
of this fancy-ass tequila?

711
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:06,320
I never say no to
fancy-ass anything.

712
00:42:14,387 --> 00:42:16,120
Let me ask you a question.

713
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:21,020
Um, is Dexter as cool
at home as he is at work?

714
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:25,020
Why? Is he, like,
your hero or something?

715
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:27,587
Yeah, right.

716
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:29,521
That... that would make me a nerd.

717
00:42:29,554 --> 00:42:31,554
Which clearly I'm not.

718
00:42:33,821 --> 00:42:35,187
Hey, you fucks.

719
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,621
Let's get the party started.

720
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:37,687
Oh, god.

721
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,153
Please tell me you didn't drive.

722
00:42:40,187 --> 00:42:41,821
No, my lovely assistant did.

723
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,320
Debra, chick from bar.

724
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:46,120
Chick from bar, Debra.

725
00:42:46,153 --> 00:42:49,587
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Debra,
her royal fucking majesty...

726
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:51,521
...Fifth Earl of Suffolk.

727
00:42:51,554 --> 00:42:54,187
Cindy.

728
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,420
Feel free to hang
all over me, babe...

729
00:42:55,454 --> 00:42:58,654
...because Debra here is
completely over my shit.

730
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:02,554
Wait a minute. This is your ex?

731
00:43:02,587 --> 00:43:04,354
You brought me to your
ex-girlfriend's house?

732
00:43:04,387 --> 00:43:06,854
No, actually, you brought me.

733
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:10,187
Have a nice life.

734
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,254
Damn, I just keep getting dumped.

735
00:43:20,654 --> 00:43:22,687
Let go of the darkness.

736
00:43:25,153 --> 00:43:28,153
How is that even possible?

737
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,420
Has Satan brought you
here, Travis, or has god?

738
00:43:38,153 --> 00:43:40,287
God.

739
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:43,254
I'm glad to hear that.

740
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:44,921
Everything's ready
to mark the whore.

741
00:43:44,954 --> 00:43:49,787
I have to go out and
do further preparation.

742
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:53,087
When I come back...

743
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,087
...I expect it to be done.

744
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:38,053
Who's there?

745
00:44:38,087 --> 00:44:40,354
What's happening?

746
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:44,921
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

747
00:45:07,787 --> 00:45:09,787
- What's happening?
- Get out.

748
00:45:09,821 --> 00:45:10,787
Where are you taking me?

749
00:45:19,587 --> 00:45:22,721
No, please.

750
00:45:22,754 --> 00:45:24,254
You're free.

751
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:28,754
So were you hoping to become
a forensic analyst or whatever?

752
00:45:28,787 --> 00:45:30,654
Uh, actually, I
already have a career.

753
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:33,787
Um, I create video games.

754
00:45:33,821 --> 00:45:37,320
Wow, that's so cool.

755
00:45:37,354 --> 00:45:39,287
So why are you a lab intern then?

756
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,454
Oh, I'm, uh... I'm developing
a new game about homicide.

757
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:45,087
I just figured it was a
great way to do research.

758
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:49,454
I'm sorry, but you must
be, like, a model, right?

759
00:45:49,487 --> 00:45:53,187
Because there's just
no other explanation.

760
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,787
Hey, excuse me, we
were kind of talking.

761
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:57,621
Exactly. "Were".

762
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:58,921
Run along back to the lab, Igor.

763
00:45:58,954 --> 00:46:00,387
I think I better go
check on Harrison.

764
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:01,621
- Yeah.
- Easy.

765
00:46:01,654 --> 00:46:03,821
Sorry.

766
00:46:03,854 --> 00:46:04,921
Move.

767
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:06,153
Hey, buddy.

768
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:07,454
Hey!

769
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:09,087
Why don't you give my
sister a little space?

770
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,921
I can't help it, she
has an outrageous ass.

771
00:46:11,954 --> 00:46:13,554
That's enough.

772
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:14,888
I wanna have a
relationship with that ass.

773
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:17,554
I wanna have babies...

774
00:46:17,587 --> 00:46:22,654
Okay, Quinn, I think it's
time we call you a cab.

775
00:46:25,787 --> 00:46:28,587
You ever love me?

776
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:32,587
Now is not the time.

777
00:46:32,621 --> 00:46:33,854
Come on, Deb.

778
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:36,320
It's not that hard of a question.

779
00:46:36,354 --> 00:46:38,320
Did you ever love me?

780
00:46:44,954 --> 00:46:46,988
All right.

781
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,020
That's what I thought.

782
00:46:57,487 --> 00:46:59,087
I'm sorry.

783
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,954
He's gone.

784
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:03,153
That's it.

785
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:06,220
Brother Sam is gone.

786
00:47:13,387 --> 00:47:15,120
Will you honor his dying wish?

787
00:47:15,153 --> 00:47:17,954
Forgive Nick?

788
00:47:17,988 --> 00:47:20,120
I want to.

789
00:47:20,153 --> 00:47:22,654
What did Brother Sam say?

790
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:24,888
Just let it go.

791
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:27,854
Let go of the darkness
this one time...

792
00:47:27,888 --> 00:47:30,854
...and show Nick the light.

793
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:43,420
I've accepted the path I'm on.

794
00:47:46,187 --> 00:47:48,287
But can I take a detour with Nick...

795
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:51,120
...for Brother Sam?

796
00:47:51,153 --> 00:47:52,487
One thing is certain.

797
00:47:52,521 --> 00:47:54,254
There's no way to get
around the fork in the road.

798
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:56,287
Hey, Dexter.

799
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,621
Hey.

800
00:47:57,654 --> 00:47:58,787
I'm glad I ran into you...

801
00:47:58,821 --> 00:48:02,020
I was hoping we could talk.

802
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:05,053
Let's go for a ride.

803
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:20,454
Dexter Morgan.

804
00:48:20,487 --> 00:48:22,320
Please leave a message at the tone.

805
00:48:22,954 --> 00:48:25,920
Where are you, bro?

806
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,054
You gonna tell me
what this is about now?

807
00:48:47,087 --> 00:48:49,620
Don't you recognize this place?

808
00:48:49,654 --> 00:48:51,487
It's a beach.

809
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,887
It's the beach where
you were baptized.

810
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:56,720
So?

811
00:48:56,754 --> 00:48:58,188
So I thought it would
be a good place...

812
00:48:58,221 --> 00:49:02,320
...for you to explain yourself.

813
00:49:02,353 --> 00:49:04,921
What are you talking about?

814
00:49:04,954 --> 00:49:07,554
Brother Sam regained consciousness.

815
00:49:07,587 --> 00:49:10,554
I know you shot him, Nick.

816
00:49:16,054 --> 00:49:17,188
You gonna arrest me?

817
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:20,320
I keep telling you I'm not a cop.

818
00:49:20,353 --> 00:49:23,720
What do you want?

819
00:49:23,754 --> 00:49:26,887
I want to know why.

820
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:29,054
Why'd you do it?

821
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:32,620
I don't know.

822
00:49:32,654 --> 00:49:34,087
You don't know?

823
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:36,254
You don't know why you put
three bullets in a man...

824
00:49:36,288 --> 00:49:37,887
...who only wanted to help you?

825
00:49:37,921 --> 00:49:39,887
Who believed in you?

826
00:49:39,921 --> 00:49:42,554
Who sacrificed for you?

827
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:46,854
A man who gave you a home?

828
00:49:46,887 --> 00:49:48,854
A man who baptized you.

829
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:51,887
Because he's full of shit!

830
00:49:54,254 --> 00:49:55,420
He gave me hope.

831
00:49:55,453 --> 00:49:58,221
But nothing changed.

832
00:49:58,254 --> 00:50:00,154
My life was shit before he
dunked me under those waves...

833
00:50:00,188 --> 00:50:01,188
...and it's still shit.

834
00:50:01,221 --> 00:50:04,087
He lied to me.

835
00:50:04,121 --> 00:50:06,854
My homies never did that.

836
00:50:06,887 --> 00:50:09,854
So you went back to them.

837
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:13,520
They wouldn't take me.

838
00:50:13,554 --> 00:50:16,554
Not unless I proved myself.

839
00:50:18,221 --> 00:50:19,854
Leo wanted Sam dead.

840
00:50:19,887 --> 00:50:23,887
That's why you gave
him the security disc.

841
00:50:26,987 --> 00:50:29,954
Here I am. The fork in the road.

842
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,420
Brother Sam loved you, Nick.

843
00:50:37,453 --> 00:50:39,654
Then why'd he rat me out to you?

844
00:50:39,687 --> 00:50:42,921
He didn't.

845
00:50:42,954 --> 00:50:44,954
He sent me to forgive you.

846
00:50:44,987 --> 00:50:48,453
Brother Sam forgives you...

847
00:50:48,487 --> 00:50:50,787
...for gunning him down like a dog.

848
00:50:50,821 --> 00:50:52,754
Your life might not have changed...

849
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:55,921
...but his did.

850
00:50:58,787 --> 00:51:00,353
Hey, look, I've gotta
talk to him, all right?

851
00:51:00,387 --> 00:51:01,654
We can work this out.

852
00:51:01,687 --> 00:51:02,687
I can't go back to jail.

853
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,754
He's dead.

854
00:51:04,787 --> 00:51:06,254
What?

855
00:51:06,288 --> 00:51:07,654
He died about an hour ago...

856
00:51:07,687 --> 00:51:11,154
...which makes you a murderer.

857
00:51:15,487 --> 00:51:19,054
Turn yourself in to the police.

858
00:51:19,087 --> 00:51:22,687
They'll find you anyway.

859
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,687
No, they won't.

860
00:51:29,054 --> 00:51:31,387
The only witness is dead.

861
00:51:33,687 --> 00:51:35,320
There ain't nothing on that disc.

862
00:51:35,353 --> 00:51:38,353
It's my word against yours.

863
00:51:42,587 --> 00:51:45,554
They got no proof.

864
00:51:50,188 --> 00:51:53,154
Nobody can do anything!

865
00:51:57,054 --> 00:51:58,420
Sweet Jesus!

866
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,254
I can't believe
this worked out, man.

867
00:52:29,954 --> 00:52:31,869
There's no light in you.

868
00:52:34,921 --> 00:52:37,887
There's no light in me.

869
00:52:51,607 --> 00:52:52,821
Hey, little brother.

870
00:52:54,854 --> 00:52:57,138
Miss me?

871
00:52:57,899 --> 00:53:08,113
