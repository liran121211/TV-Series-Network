00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:47,335
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,873
Gellar was pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis.

4
00:01:49,907 --> 00:01:50,811
Not the light.

5
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,135
What's happening?

6
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,547
No, please.

7
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:58,016
You're free.

8
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,418
- I'm done.
- Done?

9
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,953
With you, with everything.

10
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,957
Oh, please.

11
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:07,027
God's will doesn't stop just
because you want to play house

12
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,361
with your sister.

13
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:10,363
You could have asked me
before you just took off.

14
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,899
You offered me some time off.

15
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:14,702
I meant the afternoon,
not five fucking days

16
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:17,906
to go wherever it is that you are.

17
00:02:25,516 --> 00:02:28,285
Kids trust everybody.

18
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,025
For the little one.

19
00:02:35,059 --> 00:02:36,426
Here you go.

20
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,328
They trust the food you're giving them

21
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:39,663
is safe to eat.

22
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:42,332
This way, buddy.

23
00:02:42,366 --> 00:02:45,068
They trust you to lead the way.

24
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:47,904
Not the usual today.
Two coffees and...

25
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:49,406
What's good for an apology?

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,573
Male or female?

27
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:51,607
My sister.

28
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:53,309
I'd go with a cruller.

29
00:02:53,343 --> 00:02:54,443
Okay.

30
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:55,644
They don't question your motives.

31
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,847
Give a kid a mouthful
of sugar and trans fat,

32
00:02:57,881 --> 00:02:59,816
and he's your friend for life.

33
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,818
Thanks, Francisco.

34
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:12,798
Grown-ups are a lot harder.

35
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:15,867
My sister gave me a day off,
and I took five.

36
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:17,769
She has every right to be angry,

37
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:19,905
but I can't tell her
that I was in Nebraska...

38
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:22,841
Or why I was there.

39
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,981
Well, look what
the fucking cat dragged in.

40
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:32,450
The cat also brought
coffee and donuts.

41
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:34,152
You have five minutes.

42
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:37,188
Some of us actually
have to show up for work.

43
00:03:43,396 --> 00:03:45,163
I see you're all moved in.

44
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:47,432
Now it's four minutes.

45
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:50,936
Right.

46
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,305
I'm sorry...

47
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,342
I took off like that, I...

48
00:03:56,376 --> 00:03:59,512
really needed to get away.

49
00:03:59,546 --> 00:04:02,682
I'm sorry about what
happened with Brother Sam.

50
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:05,652
And this whole Trinity thing
sucks, I get it.

51
00:04:05,686 --> 00:04:08,021
And you want to blow me off?
That's fine too.

52
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:10,323
But you put me in a really
shitty position at work.

53
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:11,558
I know.

54
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:12,692
Everybody thinks I gave you a week off

55
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:14,361
in the middle of this DDK shitstorm,

56
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:16,629
which is only slightly better
than them knowing that

57
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:19,365
I didn't give you a week off!

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,135
I know.

59
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,403
I took advantage of you.

60
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:26,106
Yeah, you did.

61
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,043
I really am sorry.

62
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:33,414
Okay.

63
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:35,783
You're forgiven.

64
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,185
But it's only because I need
you in on this DDK shit.

65
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,687
What's going on?

66
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,622
Looks like this chick, Holly Benson,

67
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,958
was taken by DDK.

68
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:47,729
She got chained up, was held hostage,

69
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:49,297
but she ran away.

70
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,432
How?

71
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:53,268
They dumped her in some parking lot.

72
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:54,369
What--they?

73
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,403
That's the best part.

74
00:04:55,438 --> 00:04:57,172
Turns out there are two of these

75
00:04:57,206 --> 00:04:59,674
end-of-the-world
motherfuckers out there.

76
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:00,809
Gellar and some younger guy.

77
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,577
He's the one that let our vic go.

78
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:03,945
I think he might be a former student.

79
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,682
Seems like Travis Marshall
isn't my secret anymore.

80
00:05:06,716 --> 00:05:10,919
Wow.
Two of them.

81
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:12,620
Why did they let her go?

82
00:05:12,654 --> 00:05:15,589
Why did they tie body parts
to mannequins?

83
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:18,025
Why did they hang a waitress
from a spiked collar

84
00:05:18,059 --> 00:05:19,126
in a greenhouse?

85
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,661
They're bat-shit.
That's why.

86
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:24,565
But it sounds like Travis
is having second thoughts.

87
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,166
Okay, I have to go.

88
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,537
I'll fill you in on the rest
when we get to the station.

89
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,972
Yeah, I'm going to be a little late.

90
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:34,342
You have got to be fucking kidding me.

91
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,177
Brother Sam's funeral is this morning.

92
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:39,379
I feel like I should...

93
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:41,848
Okay.
Fine.

94
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,583
Go.

95
00:05:43,617 --> 00:05:45,751
Fucking funerals and donuts--
you're really good.

96
00:05:45,786 --> 00:05:48,354
Sorry.

97
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:53,858
Travis?

98
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:55,893
Hey, just in time.

99
00:05:55,927 --> 00:05:58,462
I got an egg white omelet,
your favorite kind

100
00:05:58,496 --> 00:06:00,631
of veggie bacon,
and scones in the oven.

101
00:06:00,665 --> 00:06:02,699
I can't believe you did all this.

102
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:04,134
Yeah, well, you're always
doing everything for me.

103
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:05,569
It's definitely my turn.

104
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:07,304
Go, sit down.

105
00:06:07,338 --> 00:06:08,873
Just let me get dressed first.

106
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:10,908
All right, hurry up.

107
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,033
I remember that day.

108
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,668
What are you doing here?

109
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,170
You said I was free.

110
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:39,905
And you are.

111
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,406
But I can't say I'm impressed

112
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:42,674
with what you've done
with your freedom.

113
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:45,043
You traded your place in God's plan

114
00:06:45,078 --> 00:06:47,179
for the pathetically mundane.

115
00:06:47,213 --> 00:06:50,149
- I like mundane.
- Really?

116
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:53,119
Because when we met,
you had plenty of it.

117
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:55,322
Your sister treated you like a child.

118
00:06:55,356 --> 00:06:56,523
You had no friends.

119
00:06:56,557 --> 00:06:58,425
No faith.

120
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,561
Your life was of no consequence,
and were you happy?

121
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,863
It's not like that now.

122
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:06,799
No, now you have
garden gnomes and...

123
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,968
Ah, someone's
made you breakfast.

124
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:13,972
Want to see what I've made?

125
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:18,543
Beautiful, isn't it?
All it needs is the right whore.

126
00:07:18,577 --> 00:07:21,079
Travis?

127
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:29,055
I bet she'd look lovely in red.

128
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,758
You stay the fuck away!

129
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:41,034
Are you taking that out?

130
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,203
Yeah, I'll just, uh--

131
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:45,205
I'll do it later.

132
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:50,077
Travis, you all right?

133
00:07:50,111 --> 00:07:51,545
Yeah, I'm fine.

134
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:54,382
Hey, do you want to get out
of here for a couple of days?

135
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,450
We--we could go to Disney World.

136
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,385
- You mean now?
- Yeah.

137
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,820
Right now, let's just...

138
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:00,955
go.

139
00:08:00,989 --> 00:08:02,924
Travis, you know
I-I can't leave.

140
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:06,126
I have school.

141
00:08:06,161 --> 00:08:08,663
But maybe in a--in a couple
of weeks on my break.

142
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,665
That would be fun.

143
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,606
How many people here can say that

144
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,874
"Brother Sam changed my life"?

145
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:28,982
Let us always keep him in our hearts.

146
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,283
"For the lord is my Shepherd,

147
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:32,852
"I shall not be in want.

148
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:35,988
"He makes me lie down
in green pastures.

149
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:38,324
"He leads me beside quiet waters.

150
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:40,960
"He restores my soul.

151
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:43,029
"He guides me in the paths
of righteousness

152
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:44,731
"for his namesake.

153
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:47,400
"Even though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

154
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:49,202
"I will fear no evil.

155
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:51,438
"For you are with me.

156
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:54,241
"Your rod and your staff,
they comfort me.

157
00:08:54,276 --> 00:08:57,345
"You prepare a table before me

158
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,746
"in the presence of my enemies.

159
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:03,983
"You anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.

160
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:06,085
"Surely, goodness and love
will follow me

161
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:07,953
"all the days of my life,

162
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:10,855
and I will dwell in the house
of the lord forever."

163
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:33,712
- Thank you for coming.
- You're welcome.

164
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:39,985
Hey, Dexter.

165
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,954
Okay.

166
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:44,256
I have something for you.

167
00:09:47,627 --> 00:09:51,097
Sorry about the blood.

168
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:53,232
He always had it close by, so...

169
00:09:53,267 --> 00:09:55,134
when he was shot...

170
00:09:57,104 --> 00:10:00,573
Last time I saw him, he said
he wanted you to have this.

171
00:10:00,607 --> 00:10:01,774
Oh.

172
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:03,609
Wow.

173
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:04,844
There's probably someone else

174
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:06,012
who would get more use
out of it--

175
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:07,613
someone more religious.

176
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:10,249
I don't know.

177
00:10:10,283 --> 00:10:12,084
Brother Sam used to always say

178
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:13,752
that no matter what the problem is,

179
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,287
the answer's in here.

180
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:17,990
You just have to figure out
the question.

181
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,861
Oh, hey.

182
00:10:21,895 --> 00:10:23,629
Have you seen Nick lately?

183
00:10:23,663 --> 00:10:25,297
Nick?

184
00:10:25,332 --> 00:10:28,267
Yeah, disappeared
after Sam passed away.

185
00:10:28,301 --> 00:10:29,702
None of us have seen him.

186
00:10:29,736 --> 00:10:32,505
Maybe he wanted some time alone.

187
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,406
Or maybe I drowned him,

188
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:39,412
right where Brother Sam's
ashes are floating.

189
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:42,815
Is it possible
that Brother Sam changed me?

190
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:47,954
I didn't kill Jonah
when I had the chance.

191
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:50,823
Did Sam somehow bring out
a little bit of light in me?

192
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:09,109
And did I pass that light on
to Travis as well?

193
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:13,547
Is that why he let Holly go?

194
00:11:13,581 --> 00:11:16,350
You did the right thing.

195
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:19,152
I know who you are.

196
00:11:19,187 --> 00:11:20,320
I remember your voice.

197
00:11:20,355 --> 00:11:21,622
I'm not here to hurt you.

198
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:24,024
You were in my car.
You tried to kill me.

199
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,526
And I let you go.

200
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,062
Just like you let Holly Benson go.

201
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,864
I want to know why.

202
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,266
I didn't want to see her suffer.

203
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,701
You've seen people suffer before.

204
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:39,239
What you said to me...
made me think.

205
00:11:39,274 --> 00:11:40,674
Think what?

206
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:44,811
That I don't have to do what he says.

207
00:11:44,846 --> 00:11:46,146
I told him I'm done.

208
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,981
I'm not working with him anymore.

209
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:49,883
How did Gellar take it?

210
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,019
Not very well.

211
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:57,090
He's angry.
He won't leave me alone.

212
00:11:57,124 --> 00:11:59,426
Why not just tell the police?

213
00:12:01,495 --> 00:12:05,265
I helped him do horrible things.
They'd--they'd arrest me.

214
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,034
They'd--

215
00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:08,235
I am a good person.

216
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:11,238
I thought we were doing
the right thing.

217
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:14,441
I just--

218
00:12:14,475 --> 00:12:17,078
I made a mistake getting involved

219
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,546
with all of this.

220
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,947
I can help you, Travis.

221
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:21,482
I can get him
out of your life for good.

222
00:12:21,517 --> 00:12:24,519
The police will never know about you.

223
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:25,953
You just have to help me find him.

224
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:29,123
Just because I'm not working with him

225
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:31,359
does not mean
that I will work with you.

226
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:33,361
All you have to do
is tell me where he is.

227
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:35,096
I'll take care of the rest.

228
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,132
You don't know who
you're dealing with.

229
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:41,068
Do you have any idea
how dangerous he is?

230
00:12:41,103 --> 00:12:42,904
He is crazy, I know that now.

231
00:12:42,938 --> 00:12:45,373
He will finish his mission,

232
00:12:45,407 --> 00:12:48,109
and he will kill anyone
who tries to stop him.

233
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:50,878
And then what?
Assuming the world doesn't end?

234
00:13:05,294 --> 00:13:08,331
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

235
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:12,669
Both of you need
to just leave me alone.

236
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:17,073
Travis has a Dark Passenger
all his own,

237
00:13:17,108 --> 00:13:20,777
but unlike mine, his walks
and talks and breathes

238
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:23,680
and goes by the name Professor Gellar.

239
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:24,882
And most significantly,

240
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:27,017
his Dark Passenger can be killed.

241
00:13:29,487 --> 00:13:30,621
Later.

242
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,865
What have we got?

243
00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:43,802
Call girl
of the high-end variety.

244
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:45,604
I.D. says Jessica Morris.

245
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,607
The lobby bar downstairs
is a known hangout

246
00:13:47,641 --> 00:13:49,175
for working girls.

247
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,012
Not that I would know that
for any reason.

248
00:13:52,046 --> 00:13:57,117
Rings on her track marks
say it's heroin.

249
00:13:57,152 --> 00:13:58,619
Maid must have wiped everything down

250
00:13:58,653 --> 00:13:59,887
before she found her.

251
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:02,689
No prints anywhere
except hers on the tub.

252
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:04,724
Looks like she OD'd and hit her head,

253
00:14:04,758 --> 00:14:08,027
if the drugs didn't kill her,
the blow to her skull sure did.

254
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:10,563
Probably an accidental death,

255
00:14:10,597 --> 00:14:13,499
but the M.E.'ll tell us more.

256
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:14,900
What do you think?

257
00:14:14,934 --> 00:14:17,335
Blood coming from her nose...

258
00:14:17,369 --> 00:14:18,636
Consistent with an overdose.

259
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:22,473
Yeah, but look at the pattern,
sort of a zigzag?

260
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:24,575
It starts this way,

261
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,612
suggesting that
she fell in this position.

262
00:14:27,646 --> 00:14:30,381
The blood dries, and then
it changes direction,

263
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:35,186
as though her head were turned
and then moved back,

264
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:38,089
suggesting the body was lifted
and then repositioned.

265
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:44,430
Heroin overdose
kills almost instantly.

266
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:46,198
Once her heart stopped beating,

267
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:48,767
there should have been
hardly any blood flow

268
00:14:48,802 --> 00:14:49,768
from the head wound.

269
00:14:49,803 --> 00:14:52,337
Unless...

270
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:53,906
Unless someone did chest compressions,

271
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,174
post-mortem.

272
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:01,413
Broken rib.

273
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:03,048
Could have been the EMTs.

274
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:04,784
She was long gone
when the maid found her.

275
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:08,789
The EMTs didn't attempt CPR.

276
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:10,124
What do you think?

277
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:13,194
I think it happened
pretty much like Vince said.

278
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:16,431
She OD's, hits her head, she dies.

279
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:21,035
Someone comes in, sees her.

280
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,403
He flips her over,

281
00:15:22,438 --> 00:15:24,872
causing more blood
to come out of her nose.

282
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:28,575
Tries CPR, but he cracks her rib

283
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,077
because he's panicked.

284
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:32,545
And he realizes that
he's just causing more blood

285
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,715
to flow from the head wound,
so he stops.

286
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,583
Puts the body back where he found her,

287
00:15:37,618 --> 00:15:39,218
then wipes everything clean.

288
00:15:39,253 --> 00:15:42,321
Someone call the captain over here?

289
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:43,990
No, why?

290
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:47,194
Because she's here.

291
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:51,331
Captain.

292
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:52,767
Where's Sergeant Batista?

293
00:15:52,801 --> 00:15:53,934
Downstairs.

294
00:15:53,969 --> 00:15:55,402
What do we have here?

295
00:15:55,437 --> 00:15:57,872
Looks like an overdose.

296
00:15:57,906 --> 00:15:59,574
Okay, good.

297
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:01,809
Make sure to copy me
on the M.E.'s report.

298
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:03,478
I'm going downstairs.

299
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:05,480
Yes, ma'am.

300
00:16:11,587 --> 00:16:13,055
Hey, Dexter.

301
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:14,323
You're back.

302
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:15,423
Louis.

303
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:16,591
Hey, uh--

304
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:19,060
I heard what you did
at that crime scene.

305
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,497
You know, the body was moved
and then repositioned.

306
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:23,766
So cool--you gotta show me how
you figure that stuff out.

307
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,601
Yeah, sure, we'll do that sometime,

308
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:26,936
but right now, I gotta...

309
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:32,542
Okay, I'm going to make this quick.

310
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:34,611
The whole city
is freaking out over DDK.

311
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,513
We're getting
over 100 calls a day--

312
00:16:36,547 --> 00:16:38,048
people saying that
they've seen Gellar,

313
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:40,283
people asking if it's safe
to go out at night.

314
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:42,818
I need everyone's asses
on the fucking ball.

315
00:16:42,853 --> 00:16:45,287
I'm going to keep rearranging
that sentence to make it hotter.

316
00:16:45,321 --> 00:16:46,955
Holly Benson's experience with DDK...

317
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:48,657
And that's still my sister.

318
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:51,026
Suggests that Gellar
is working with an accomplice.

319
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,394
Now, thanks to Louis,

320
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:55,296
we have a list
of male Tallahassee graduates

321
00:16:55,331 --> 00:16:56,731
living in the Miami area

322
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,666
that have taken classes with him.

323
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,603
We have over 200 names to investigate,

324
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:04,138
so I'm going to take some myself,

325
00:17:04,173 --> 00:17:05,239
Batista, Quinn, Mike...

326
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,041
You guys can divide up the rest.

327
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:09,443
And let's not let on that we
know Gellar has an accomplice.

328
00:17:09,477 --> 00:17:11,646
This fucker thinks
we don't know who he is?

329
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,581
Let's keep it that way.

330
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:15,583
How do I get Travis to trust me

331
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,853
before the cops
get to his name on the list?

332
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,322
Ah, I'm sorry I wasn't
at the crime scene this morning.

333
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:23,356
It's fine.
Mike was there.

334
00:17:23,391 --> 00:17:25,225
I got a way to make it up to you.

335
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:27,327
There's a new place
opening on Washington.

336
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,328
Opening night's invitation only.

337
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:31,029
Guess who's got two of these?

338
00:17:31,064 --> 00:17:33,932
I'll pass.
I've got Auri on Friday night.

339
00:17:33,966 --> 00:17:35,266
Auri always cancels on you.

340
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:36,767
Take Masuka.

341
00:17:36,802 --> 00:17:39,536
Your loss.

342
00:17:39,571 --> 00:17:42,139
- Hey, sis.
- Hey.

343
00:17:42,174 --> 00:17:43,574
What brings you here?

344
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:46,810
Oh, we were just
at Harrison's music class,

345
00:17:46,845 --> 00:17:49,846
and he wanted to see his daddy.

346
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:51,415
Come on, admit it.

347
00:17:51,449 --> 00:17:54,350
You wanted to say hi
to your big brother.

348
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,353
Hey.
I got your text.

349
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:58,956
Oh, yeah, we were
just in the neighborhood.

350
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:00,591
Want to maybe go for a walk with us?

351
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:02,727
Yeah, sure.
Let me just tell Mr. Masuka.

352
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:06,198
Okay.

353
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,900
You're still seeing that guy, huh?

354
00:18:07,935 --> 00:18:09,202
You don't like him?

355
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:11,204
I don't really know him.

356
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,706
You know what?

357
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,207
You should come to dinner with us.

358
00:18:14,242 --> 00:18:15,309
I don't know.

359
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:17,678
If you're going to judge him,

360
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:19,447
then maybe you should have some idea

361
00:18:19,481 --> 00:18:21,782
who you're talking about first.

362
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:24,985
Okay, sure.
Why not?

363
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:25,986
It'll be fun.

364
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,354
Yeah.

365
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:31,758
Children trust that when
we put them to bed at night,

366
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:35,961
they'll live to see another day.

367
00:18:39,866 --> 00:18:44,670
Adults are not always so fortunate.

368
00:18:44,704 --> 00:18:46,705
Travis is my only way to Gellar.

369
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
I have to convince him to help me.

370
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:54,813
Maybe I need to learn
to speak his language.

371
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:15,801
Brother Sam did say
all the answers were in here.

372
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:16,901
I'm not sure he meant

373
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:20,572
the answers to my kinds of questions.

374
00:19:57,077 --> 00:19:59,178
What are you doing here?
I told you--

375
00:19:59,213 --> 00:20:00,847
No, no, you don't
want to get involved.

376
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:03,716
I understand that,
but you are responsible

377
00:20:03,751 --> 00:20:06,119
for hurting a lot of people, Travis.

378
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:10,223
I'm sure you don't feel
good about that.

379
00:20:14,863 --> 00:20:17,165
You wandered from God's path.

380
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:21,769
I was led astray.

381
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:26,007
I know.
The blood.

382
00:20:26,041 --> 00:20:27,809
Long story.

383
00:20:27,844 --> 00:20:30,378
But what's more important are
the words underneath the blood.

384
00:20:30,413 --> 00:20:34,416
It says here, "Anyone then who
knows the good he ought to do--"

385
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:36,819
"And doesn't do, sins."

386
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:39,188
The "sin of omission."

387
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:41,457
James 4:17.
So?

388
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:44,927
So it sounds to me like
you're in some trouble, Travis.

389
00:20:44,962 --> 00:20:47,463
If you allow Professor Gellar
to continue doing

390
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,432
what he's doing,
according to James here,

391
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:51,801
it's just as much of a sin
as doing the killings yourself.

392
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,537
I know.

393
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:57,574
I wish that I could take it all back.

394
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:00,743
But now, I can't risk
antagonizing him.

395
00:21:00,777 --> 00:21:02,445
I can protect you.

396
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:03,513
It's not me that I'm worried about.

397
00:21:03,547 --> 00:21:05,915
It's my sister.

398
00:21:05,949 --> 00:21:07,250
Gellar's threatened her before,

399
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:09,252
and I can't let
anything happen to her.

400
00:21:12,022 --> 00:21:13,989
Can I blame him?

401
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:16,992
As long as Gellar's out there.
She's still in danger.

402
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:18,127
I can protect her.

403
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:20,296
What if you can't?

404
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:29,407
Um...

405
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:31,442
Okay.

406
00:21:31,476 --> 00:21:35,013
I'll try to convince Lisa
to go to her friend's

407
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:36,949
up in Pensacola for the weekend.

408
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:40,019
Gellar won't leave Miami.

409
00:21:40,053 --> 00:21:43,255
Let me get her safe,

410
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,691
and then I promise,

411
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:48,494
I'll do whatever you say.

412
00:21:58,238 --> 00:22:00,806
Sam was right about this book.

413
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,010
Hi, can I help you?

414
00:22:06,045 --> 00:22:08,346
I'm Lieutenant Debra Morgan,
Miami Metro Homicide.

415
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:10,681
I'm looking for Travis Marshall.

416
00:22:10,716 --> 00:22:11,849
His building manager said

417
00:22:11,883 --> 00:22:13,584
that they were forwarding
his mail here.

418
00:22:13,618 --> 00:22:16,353
Uh, Travis is my brother,
but he's not here right now.

419
00:22:16,387 --> 00:22:18,688
Can I--can I help you
with something?

420
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:20,757
We're investigating
a college professor,

421
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,193
James Gellar, in connection
with three homicides.

422
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:25,729
The Doomsday Killer.

423
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:27,832
Oh, my God.
Travis...

424
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:29,300
Has something happened?

425
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:31,669
No, we're just looking
into former associates of his.

426
00:22:31,703 --> 00:22:33,537
And according to our records,

427
00:22:33,572 --> 00:22:36,474
Travis took some classes
with him up in Tallahassee.

428
00:22:36,508 --> 00:22:38,643
We just want to ask him
a few questions.

429
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:40,912
Oh, I-I doubt
that Travis

430
00:22:40,946 --> 00:22:42,247
would be able to help you much.

431
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:43,848
I don't think he stays in touch

432
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:45,450
with anyone from school.

433
00:22:45,484 --> 00:22:46,785
He must have been pretty shaken up

434
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,286
when he found out an old professor

435
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:49,855
was a murder suspect.

436
00:22:49,889 --> 00:22:52,891
I guess so.

437
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:54,593
He didn't mention it?

438
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:56,094
Well, Travis isn't really the type

439
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:58,931
to talk about how
he feels about things.

440
00:22:58,965 --> 00:23:01,233
Not even to his sister.

441
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:02,401
So you aren't close.

442
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:04,403
Um...

443
00:23:04,437 --> 00:23:07,306
Our parents died when Travis
was still a teenager,

444
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,242
so I pretty much raised him
the rest of the way, so...

445
00:23:10,277 --> 00:23:12,378
Tragedy makes you tight, you know?

446
00:23:12,412 --> 00:23:14,480
But, uh--with Travis,
I think it also made him

447
00:23:14,515 --> 00:23:19,585
um, closed off,
I guess you would call it.

448
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,887
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

449
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:25,858
So you haven't noticed
any unusual behavior?

450
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:27,726
Nothing out of the ordinary?

451
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,896
No.
Same old Travis.

452
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,467
I actually have to get back to work.

453
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:37,102
Okay, if you could just have
him give me a call

454
00:23:37,136 --> 00:23:38,103
the next time you see him

455
00:23:38,137 --> 00:23:39,170
so we can check him off our list?

456
00:23:39,205 --> 00:23:40,472
Okay.

457
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,275
I'm sorry I couldn't
have been more help.

458
00:23:43,309 --> 00:23:45,744
No, thank you for your time.

459
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:17,641
Hey.

460
00:24:17,676 --> 00:24:20,911
So any luck finding DDK's accomplice?

461
00:24:20,945 --> 00:24:22,879
Um, no, not yet,

462
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:24,781
but I crossed five names off the list.

463
00:24:24,815 --> 00:24:26,115
And I'm going to go back out there

464
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:27,650
as soon as I make
a couple of phone calls.

465
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:28,851
Thank you.

466
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,519
Sounds like detective work,
lieutenant.

467
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:33,221
Well, it's a team effort.

468
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:34,823
One of these names
is going to pan out.

469
00:24:34,857 --> 00:24:37,225
Well, until it does,
I've got good news for you.

470
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,327
The M.E. report came back in

471
00:24:39,362 --> 00:24:41,664
on Jessica Morris, the prostitute?

472
00:24:41,698 --> 00:24:44,834
Cause of death was the overdose.

473
00:24:44,868 --> 00:24:47,804
Why is that good news?

474
00:24:47,838 --> 00:24:50,306
Because the case
can be closed as an accident,

475
00:24:50,341 --> 00:24:53,544
which means you have one less
homicide to worry about.

476
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:57,214
Wait, why were you looking
at the M.E.'s report on that?

477
00:24:57,248 --> 00:24:59,716
Your plate is so full

478
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:00,884
with DDK...

479
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:05,855
Came across my desk,
and I took a look at it.

480
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,857
Team effort, right?

481
00:25:07,891 --> 00:25:09,259
Right.

482
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:10,960
Okay, so...

483
00:25:10,995 --> 00:25:12,228
You can close the case now.

484
00:25:12,263 --> 00:25:13,429
Congratulations.

485
00:25:13,464 --> 00:25:15,432
Thank you.

486
00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:31,114
- Hey.
- Hey, where are you?

487
00:25:31,148 --> 00:25:33,016
I'm on my way back from lunch.

488
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,584
Look, will you do me a favor

489
00:25:34,618 --> 00:25:37,721
and put a rush on
Jessica Morris' blood report?

490
00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:39,356
Laguerta's acting weird.

491
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,657
Weird how?

492
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:42,158
She's being helpful.

493
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:43,660
I just want to see what she's up to.

494
00:25:43,694 --> 00:25:47,030
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

495
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,866
Lisa.

496
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,136
Come on.
Hurry up, Lisa.

497
00:26:00,913 --> 00:26:02,646
Stop following me!

498
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:04,148
Sorry, Travis.

499
00:26:04,182 --> 00:26:07,685
We don't have time for your
little journey to find yourself.

500
00:26:07,719 --> 00:26:09,654
We have to work to do.

501
00:26:17,263 --> 00:26:20,732
You know, uh, when Jamie told
me you got the Trans Am,

502
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:21,966
I was jealous.

503
00:26:22,001 --> 00:26:24,135
That is...one awesome car.

504
00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:25,970
You drive a V.W., right?

505
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:29,507
Yeah, it's a limited edition.
Actually, it's very rare.

506
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,742
I'm going to go to the restroom.

507
00:26:31,777 --> 00:26:35,046
You guys keep talking
about car things.

508
00:26:46,057 --> 00:26:49,293
Wow.
She's amazing.

509
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:51,495
I can't believe that a girl like that

510
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:53,464
could be interested in a guy like me.

511
00:26:53,498 --> 00:26:55,065
She's interested in a lot of people.

512
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,735
Oh.

513
00:26:57,769 --> 00:26:59,770
My sister's a really nice girl.

514
00:26:59,804 --> 00:27:01,672
She has a hard time saying no.

515
00:27:01,706 --> 00:27:03,373
So she dates a lot of guys?

516
00:27:03,408 --> 00:27:04,875
She's young.

517
00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:06,510
She's in school.

518
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:08,412
She's not in a place in her life

519
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,914
to be taking anybody too seriously.

520
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:13,583
Okay.

521
00:27:13,618 --> 00:27:16,987
I know you seem like a nice guy.

522
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,094
I just wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

523
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:28,466
Hmm.

524
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,638
So when Jessica Morris OD'd,

525
00:27:32,672 --> 00:27:35,274
there was definitely someone
in that hotel room with her.

526
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,343
No doubt.

527
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:40,012
Then why is Laguerta
on my ass to close this thing?

528
00:27:40,046 --> 00:27:43,348
Maybe she wants to keep a low profile?

529
00:27:43,383 --> 00:27:45,717
So what am I supposed to do?

530
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:49,421
If I do my job and I investigate
a possible homicide,

531
00:27:49,455 --> 00:27:51,121
then--

532
00:27:51,156 --> 00:27:53,657
I piss off captain close-it.

533
00:27:53,692 --> 00:27:56,359
And if I close it, this guy walks.

534
00:27:56,394 --> 00:27:59,730
Maybe you should talk to Laguerta.

535
00:27:59,764 --> 00:28:01,766
Yeah.
Maybe I should.

536
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,135
Either way, I have to sign
this fucking blood report.

537
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:06,171
Do you have a pen?

538
00:28:09,675 --> 00:28:11,610
Ah, here.

539
00:28:18,518 --> 00:28:21,253
Why do you have a pen
from the Shady Lane Motel

540
00:28:21,288 --> 00:28:23,055
at Kearney, Nebraska?

541
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:24,423
Uh...

542
00:28:24,458 --> 00:28:25,859
Must have picked it up somewhere.

543
00:28:25,893 --> 00:28:28,328
Yeah, at the Shady Lane Motel
in Kearney, Nebraska.

544
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:29,897
I can explain.

545
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:33,668
Kearney, Nebraska is where
Trinity's family was murdered.

546
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:34,903
Which you found out about the day

547
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:36,237
you took your little joyride.

548
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:38,606
So that is either one
motherfucker of a coincidence,

549
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:41,509
or you were "just driving"
to fucking Nebraska.

550
00:28:41,543 --> 00:28:43,411
Okay, yes, I went to Nebraska.

551
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:45,813
Why?

552
00:28:45,848 --> 00:28:48,649
Guess I just felt drawn there.

553
00:28:48,683 --> 00:28:51,318
Did you talk to Jonah?

554
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:53,120
Yes.

555
00:28:54,922 --> 00:28:56,757
Why?

556
00:28:58,026 --> 00:28:59,493
I don't know, Deb.

557
00:28:59,527 --> 00:29:02,062
We both lost people
we loved to the same killer.

558
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:03,898
I...

559
00:29:03,932 --> 00:29:05,633
just felt a connection with him.

560
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,236
And I needed someone to talk to.

561
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,071
And you couldn't talk to me?

562
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:11,239
I didn't want to burden you.

563
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:14,143
Oh.

564
00:29:14,177 --> 00:29:17,246
Burden me, my ass.

565
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:21,350
I burden you all the time.

566
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:24,019
It's not a burden for me
to be there for you.

567
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,888
It was a mistake.
I shouldn't have gone.

568
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,960
That's not the point.

569
00:29:31,994 --> 00:29:35,297
The point is that
you lied to me about it.

570
00:29:35,331 --> 00:29:36,898
The point is that
you thought you had to go

571
00:29:36,932 --> 00:29:40,001
to Butt-fuck-ville to talk
to somebody about Trinity.

572
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:43,437
Dexter, don't you think I get it?

573
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,378
I lost Lundy because of Trinity too.

574
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:58,484
Hey, guys, looks like
DDK struck again.

575
00:30:17,739 --> 00:30:20,707
Janitor found this early this morning.

576
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:24,711
The Whore of Babylon.

577
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:30,250
The next tableau.

578
00:30:39,994 --> 00:30:41,361
Shit!

579
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:43,797
I interviewed her yesterday.

580
00:30:43,832 --> 00:30:46,300
Her brother was a student of Gellar's.

581
00:30:46,334 --> 00:30:48,135
Travis.
Travis Marshall.

582
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:50,204
Find Travis Marshall
right the fuck now,

583
00:30:50,238 --> 00:30:51,806
and if you can't find him,
put a B.O.L.O. out on him.

584
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,342
I think he's Gellar's accomplice.

585
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:56,944
Travis just shot to the top
of Miami Metro Homicide's

586
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,279
most wanted list.

587
00:30:58,313 --> 00:31:00,815
Did Travis go back to Gellar,

588
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,886
or was this the price
Travis paid for defying him?

589
00:31:09,892 --> 00:31:14,129
A ripped seam...

590
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:17,800
F.N. Galway.

591
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,703
This used to be some kind of vestment,

592
00:31:20,737 --> 00:31:22,738
a robe, maybe.

593
00:31:30,113 --> 00:31:33,115
What do you think the letters
on her forehead mean?

594
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:35,917
We'll find out.

595
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:37,919
Hey, I got something.

596
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:47,797
It's your card.

597
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:49,699
What the fuck?

598
00:31:52,603 --> 00:31:54,103
What the fuck do you think means?

599
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:55,204
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.

600
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,106
These assholes are all about messages.

601
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:59,208
You think it's because
I talked to her?

602
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:00,275
Do you think it's to keep her quiet?

603
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,943
This isn't your fault, Deb.

604
00:32:04,247 --> 00:32:07,215
But it could be mine.

605
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:37,346
Sorry for the chain.

606
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,016
I couldn't risk you
disappearing on me.

607
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,420
You know you're far too important.

608
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,225
What do you want?

609
00:32:49,995 --> 00:32:55,867
Penance to cleanse your soul.

610
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:58,571
It's not your fault, Travis.

611
00:32:58,605 --> 00:33:01,039
The devil comes in many forms.

612
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:05,777
Sometimes he tempts you with an apple,

613
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:08,980
or fame or riches...

614
00:33:09,014 --> 00:33:13,750
or a mundane life with your family.

615
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,053
Do not talk about my sister.

616
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:20,190
Your sister whom you hold
in such high esteem...

617
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:22,926
talked to the police.

618
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,997
She betrayed you...

619
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:29,133
just like the Whore of Babylon.

620
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,135
What did you do to my sister?

621
00:33:35,107 --> 00:33:36,340
No.

622
00:33:39,945 --> 00:33:42,981
No!

623
00:33:43,016 --> 00:33:45,083
She's part of it now.

624
00:33:46,686 --> 00:33:49,488
Don't you get it, Travis?

625
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:52,924
She was doomed to hell on earth.

626
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:55,093
Tribulations.

627
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:58,630
But now, her soul is pure.

628
00:33:58,665 --> 00:34:00,932
She can go to God.

629
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:03,803
Just like you wanted.

630
00:34:03,837 --> 00:34:07,506
And you can come back to our mission.

631
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,843
I didn't want this!

632
00:34:10,944 --> 00:34:13,746
I understand.
It'll take time.

633
00:34:13,781 --> 00:34:15,915
Pray for your sister.

634
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,784
Do whatever it is you need to do.

635
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:22,089
And when I come back...

636
00:34:22,123 --> 00:34:25,126
I sincerely hope you have
a change of heart.

637
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:33,002
I was just on my way up to see you.

638
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:34,971
I hear DDK has struck again.

639
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,506
We have a B.O.L.O. out
on Travis Marshall.

640
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,275
Everyone in the city is going
to know what he looks like.

641
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:42,144
Meanwhile, you now have two suspects

642
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,613
and no arrests.

643
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:45,548
Yes, I know.

644
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,416
Actually, I was coming to talk to you

645
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,919
about Jessica Morris.

646
00:34:49,953 --> 00:34:52,855
The dead prostitute.

647
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:54,423
Why hasn't that case been closed?

648
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:56,458
Because I saw Dexter's report.

649
00:34:56,493 --> 00:34:57,792
Someone else was in the room.

650
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,761
The woman overdosed, Debra.

651
00:34:59,795 --> 00:35:01,729
What does it matter
who else was in the room?

652
00:35:01,764 --> 00:35:05,466
Because some dickhead left
a dead woman in a bathroom.

653
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Aren't we talking
involuntary manslaughter,

654
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:10,270
not to mention solicitation,
obstruction?

655
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:11,270
Hell, we could get murder two.

656
00:35:11,305 --> 00:35:13,272
Stop.

657
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:17,442
Debra...

658
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:21,380
I'm going to level with you.

659
00:35:21,414 --> 00:35:22,748
That compstat hearing

660
00:35:22,783 --> 00:35:24,751
did not go very well
for either one of us.

661
00:35:24,785 --> 00:35:28,087
Another open case will put
our clearance rate at 19%.

662
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:31,190
- But if we let a guilty man--
- 19%, Debra.

663
00:35:31,225 --> 00:35:33,893
Do you understand what's happening?

664
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:37,030
We have a city
in an all-out panic.

665
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:38,732
Last night, a woman
tried to drive her car

666
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:41,768
into Biscayne Bay
with her infant son inside,

667
00:35:41,803 --> 00:35:43,671
because she thinks
it's the end of the world

668
00:35:43,705 --> 00:35:46,874
and she didn't want him
to go through the tribulations.

669
00:35:46,908 --> 00:35:48,776
Now...

670
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,545
don't take this the wrong way,
but being young

671
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,481
and personable,
and saying bad words on TV

672
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:57,485
just is not going to cut it
right now, trust me.

673
00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,620
Find the man who killed
four innocent people,

674
00:35:59,654 --> 00:36:03,457
not some john who bailed
on a fucking junkie prostitute

675
00:36:03,491 --> 00:36:05,693
who overdosed.

676
00:36:05,727 --> 00:36:09,596
And that's an order, lieutenant.

677
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:11,999
Okay.

678
00:36:12,033 --> 00:36:14,501
Fine.
I'll close it.

679
00:36:14,536 --> 00:36:16,671
Good.

680
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,713
Yeah, it's me.

681
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:29,483
It's taken care of.

682
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:33,185
Yes, I'm sure you have nothing
more to worry about.

683
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:47,399
My search for F.N. Galway
has turned up nothing.

684
00:36:47,434 --> 00:36:49,067
This is the last of them.

685
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:51,770
And there's not much I can do
with intern puppy dog

686
00:36:51,804 --> 00:36:53,438
watching my every move.

687
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:56,541
You know, Google's kind
of five minutes ago, right?

688
00:36:56,575 --> 00:36:58,643
Uh, try Eliot.

689
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,583
Yeah, it, uh,
uses a targeted algorithm

690
00:37:04,617 --> 00:37:06,319
to aggregate content
without getting tripped up

691
00:37:06,353 --> 00:37:08,020
by all that sneaky
S.E.O. bullshit.

692
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:09,455
Intern puppy dog has skills.

693
00:37:16,798 --> 00:37:21,034
Oh, I'll let you do your thing.

694
00:37:22,269 --> 00:37:24,036
Got the M.E.'s report.

695
00:37:24,071 --> 00:37:25,504
Looks like Lisa Marshall
was killed the same way

696
00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:26,939
as our our fruit vendor
and our jogger.

697
00:37:26,973 --> 00:37:28,173
But get this:

698
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,909
The M.E. didn't find any
of those paper, 1,000--

699
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:33,778
whatever-the-fuck number things
anywhere on the body.

700
00:37:33,813 --> 00:37:35,647
That's because it was Travis
who put the numbers there.

701
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:37,449
That means this kill was all Gellar.

702
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:38,716
Weird.

703
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:40,251
Any luck finding Travis Marshall?

704
00:37:40,286 --> 00:37:41,920
Not yet.

705
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:44,823
But I found out he works
at the museum,

706
00:37:44,857 --> 00:37:47,492
restoring old Bibles.

707
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,095
I'll fuck Masuka
if this isn't our guy.

708
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:51,230
Sounds like you're getting close.

709
00:37:51,264 --> 00:37:52,732
Too close.

710
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:54,968
I'm going to have to work fast
if I want to save Travis.

711
00:37:55,002 --> 00:37:57,304
Hey, listen.

712
00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:00,575
You want to grab dinner
after work tonight?

713
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:02,909
You know, chat?

714
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:04,044
Talk?

715
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,646
Can we do another night?

716
00:38:05,681 --> 00:38:08,215
I'm pretty tired,
and I just want to spend

717
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,952
some down time at home with Harrison.

718
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:14,055
Okay.

719
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:15,223
Sure, another night.

720
00:38:15,257 --> 00:38:17,792
Definitely.

721
00:38:25,034 --> 00:38:27,036
I'm sorry I'm late.

722
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,971
I saw the news.

723
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:30,305
I wasn't sure you'd be able to make

724
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,940
our session anyway today.

725
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:33,208
Yeah, I almost canceled.

726
00:38:33,243 --> 00:38:38,113
But, uh, I could use the break.

727
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:40,315
That must have been
a difficult thing to see.

728
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,686
You could say that.

729
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:46,188
I mean, I show up, right,

730
00:38:46,222 --> 00:38:50,458
to question her
about her brother and...

731
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,995
24 hours later...

732
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,367
I can't help but feel responsible.

733
00:39:00,402 --> 00:39:02,036
You know, I knew that
there was something

734
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,974
that she wasn't telling me.

735
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:08,544
Do you think she knew that
her brother was involved?

736
00:39:08,578 --> 00:39:10,646
I think she knew something
was up with him.

737
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,783
And I think she was trying
to protect him,

738
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:17,654
which is what a good sister does.

739
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:21,858
And then, he ends up killing her.

740
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:24,394
Oh, Jesus.

741
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:26,998
Are all brothers assholes?

742
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,599
Who are we talking about now?

743
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,401
Who else?
Dexter.

744
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:35,005
Ah. So you think
he might kill you?

745
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,911
No, I don't think he's going
to kill me, I just--

746
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,016
I think he treats me like shit.

747
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,520
Oh?

748
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,525
He shuts me out.

749
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,762
He won't tell me things, like...

750
00:39:57,796 --> 00:40:00,865
really important things.

751
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,734
Sounds like you two are having

752
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,569
a little trouble communicating lately.

753
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,972
We aren't having trouble
communicating.

754
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,941
He's the one that's
keeping all the secrets.

755
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:15,044
But normally, you're pretty
open with each other.

756
00:40:15,078 --> 00:40:17,579
Yes. I tell
him everything.

757
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:20,616
I tell him about boyfriends, work.

758
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,220
I tell him about everything.

759
00:40:24,254 --> 00:40:28,892
Sounds like a lot
of talking about yourself.

760
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,627
Aren't you supposed to be on my side?

761
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,997
I'm just telling you what I'm hearing.

762
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,033
Okay, yeah.
We talk about me.

763
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:37,869
A lot.

764
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:39,337
But that's what I'm saying.

765
00:40:39,372 --> 00:40:43,242
I can't get him to tell me
shit-all about jack shit.

766
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:46,311
Or maybe he doesn't think
there's any room

767
00:40:46,346 --> 00:40:49,047
in the relationship for his needs.

768
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:53,753
Maybe next time you get together

769
00:40:53,787 --> 00:40:57,791
you could just make
some effort to focus on him

770
00:40:57,825 --> 00:41:00,960
and his issues.

771
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:26,485
Need another round?
Next one's on me.

772
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,287
Oh, I'm pacing myself.

773
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,855
I need to retain my ability...

774
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:31,356
Oh, yeah!

775
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:35,961
To...focus.

776
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,663
Sure, I get that.

777
00:41:37,697 --> 00:41:39,231
Yeah.
All right.

778
00:41:39,265 --> 00:41:40,966
Thanks, cutie.

779
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,500
Hey, be honest with me.

780
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:45,003
I wasn't your first choice
to bring here tonight, was I?

781
00:41:45,037 --> 00:41:47,872
Not really, but does it matter?

782
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:50,608
Not really.

783
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:52,276
Excuse me.
Can I get a refill, please?

784
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,578
Uh-huh.

785
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,146
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't go anywhere.

786
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,848
If I said you had a beautiful body,

787
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:58,849
would you hold it against me?

788
00:41:58,884 --> 00:42:00,484
Please.

789
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,786
Come on, it's a song.
I can sing it to you.

790
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,955
Yo, man.
Come on, relax.

791
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,491
Look, just look around
and enjoy the scenery, huh.

792
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,159
Look at that right there.

793
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:18,000
In the green thong.

794
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,837
That's a thing of beauty.

795
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:23,005
I'm going to marry her.

796
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,540
I'm going to marry green thong.

797
00:42:25,575 --> 00:42:29,378
- Come on, Quinn.
- Sit down.

798
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:31,413
- Will you marry me?
- Fine.

799
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:33,582
No, I mean, of course
no one wants to marry me,

800
00:42:33,616 --> 00:42:35,017
but can I at least
get a kiss from you?

801
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,686
Hey, back off, buddy.
All right?

802
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,121
Okay, we got to cut you off,
man, okay?

803
00:42:39,155 --> 00:42:40,355
- Okay.
- But wait, she's not...

804
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,657
finished breaking my heart yet.

805
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:42,958
If you don't take him outta here,

806
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:44,293
I gotta take him out.

807
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:46,028
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We don't need that.

808
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,463
No problem, we out, we out, let's go.

809
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,866
Green thong!
I love you, green thong.

810
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,001
All right.
Let's get you home, come on.

811
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,070
Nah, man.
I ain't going anywhere.

812
00:42:53,105 --> 00:42:55,606
I'm only getting started.

813
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,081
Louis' search engine
turned out to be useful.

814
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:06,551
Father Nicholas Galway,
retired catholic priest.

815
00:43:06,585 --> 00:43:09,421
You understand that
Father Galway's dementia

816
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:10,855
has progressed extensively?

817
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:13,291
It isn't likely he'll remember you.

818
00:43:13,325 --> 00:43:16,894
I'm not sure if that's good or bad.

819
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:21,632
Father?

820
00:43:21,666 --> 00:43:23,300
Yes?

821
00:43:23,335 --> 00:43:26,369
You have a visitor.

822
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,338
Thank you.

823
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,309
Father Galway?

824
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,912
Yes, that's me.

825
00:43:36,946 --> 00:43:39,715
I'm having trouble
remembering your name.

826
00:43:39,749 --> 00:43:41,984
Actually, we've never met.

827
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:43,752
- My name is--
- Francis Connolly!

828
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,054
Um...

829
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:47,089
You've come to apologize
for breaking the window

830
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:50,460
in the Narthex, I take it.

831
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,997
I'm sorry, Father.
I'm in the wrong place.

832
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:57,100
Oh, you're not going anywhere,
young man.

833
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,169
You must confess your sins.

834
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,872
Actually, I'm okay.
If I could just--

835
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:04,074
"Bless me, father,

836
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,543
for I have sinned."

837
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:09,179
My sins? Okay.

838
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:16,020
I've exceeded the speed limit
a few times.

839
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:18,622
Oh, who hasn't done that?

840
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:21,291
What other sins must you confess?

841
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,997
I lied to my sister.

842
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:30,067
The freckle-faced one,
Mary Grace, isn't that it?

843
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:32,803
She always had a cookie
in her hand, that one.

844
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:34,905
What else?

845
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:36,440
He's too far gone.

846
00:44:36,474 --> 00:44:37,574
I really should get going, Father.

847
00:44:37,609 --> 00:44:39,576
Son!

848
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:41,511
How do you expect to get into heaven,

849
00:44:41,546 --> 00:44:44,280
unless you let me
absolve you of your sins?

850
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,681
You can do that?

851
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,017
Anything you confess,

852
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:49,652
God will forgive.

853
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:01,529
I'm waiting, Francis.

854
00:45:01,564 --> 00:45:04,833
I've killed people.

855
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:10,907
Continue.

856
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:14,010
A lot of people.

857
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:21,085
Murder is a mortal sin.

858
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:26,224
You must...
You must...

859
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:30,429
Where were we?

860
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:33,966
Confession.

861
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:37,337
Oh, yes.
Of course.

862
00:45:39,239 --> 00:45:42,575
I absolve you of all of your sins.

863
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:47,615
In the name of the Father,
Son, and the Holy Ghost.

864
00:45:47,649 --> 00:45:49,516
Amen.

865
00:45:55,723 --> 00:45:57,891
Thank you.

866
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:12,838
Hmm.

867
00:46:12,873 --> 00:46:15,307
It's sad, isn't it?

868
00:46:15,342 --> 00:46:19,144
He was a wonderful priest
back in the day.

869
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:20,813
Yes, he was.

870
00:46:20,847 --> 00:46:24,984
Now half the time,
he doesn't know where he is.

871
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:26,986
Some Sunday mornings,
he asks to be driven

872
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,023
to his church because he thinks
he's supposed to lead mass.

873
00:46:31,057 --> 00:46:33,191
His church?

874
00:46:33,226 --> 00:46:35,627
Santa Maria de Loreto.

875
00:46:35,662 --> 00:46:37,463
Right.

876
00:46:37,497 --> 00:46:39,299
And that's in...

877
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:41,101
It's out in Davie.

878
00:46:41,135 --> 00:46:42,569
But--but don't
waste your time.

879
00:46:42,603 --> 00:46:44,905
It's been abandoned
for over 20 years now.

880
00:46:44,939 --> 00:46:46,773
Not much left of it.

881
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:48,408
An abandoned church...

882
00:46:48,442 --> 00:46:50,477
Very sad, huh?

883
00:46:50,511 --> 00:46:52,245
If Gellar's at that church,

884
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,514
his hideout will
make an even better kill room.

885
00:46:54,548 --> 00:46:58,552
I'll say good night to Harrison,
and then I'll be on my way.

886
00:46:58,586 --> 00:47:00,254
Oh.
Hey, Dex.

887
00:47:00,288 --> 00:47:02,623
Deb said I could take off
since she's here.

888
00:47:02,657 --> 00:47:05,559
I told you tonight wasn't good.

889
00:47:05,593 --> 00:47:06,893
I know.

890
00:47:06,928 --> 00:47:08,796
You got to eat, right?

891
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:11,131
So you can just relax and kick back.

892
00:47:11,166 --> 00:47:12,499
I'm making steaks.

893
00:47:12,534 --> 00:47:13,567
Which is a big deal,
because I can't remember

894
00:47:13,602 --> 00:47:15,036
the last time I cooked something

895
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,772
that didn't involve
"pierce film with fork."

896
00:47:17,806 --> 00:47:19,707
Something came up.
I have to go out.

897
00:47:19,742 --> 00:47:22,076
I just came to say
good night to Harrison.

898
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,711
I'm sorry
for the mix-up, Jamie.

899
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:27,348
Oh, that's okay.
I can stay.

900
00:47:27,383 --> 00:47:29,884
- Daddy.
- Something came up?

901
00:47:29,918 --> 00:47:31,853
What the fuck do you mean,
something came up?

902
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:34,188
Would you please watch
your language in front of him?

903
00:47:34,223 --> 00:47:36,224
I'll go give him his bath.

904
00:47:36,258 --> 00:47:39,927
- Night, buddy.
- Night, night.

905
00:47:41,663 --> 00:47:43,631
So when you said you wanted
a quiet night at home,

906
00:47:43,665 --> 00:47:44,732
you were just blowing me off.

907
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:46,234
I told you, something came up.

908
00:47:46,268 --> 00:47:47,869
You're not going
to tell me what it is?

909
00:47:47,903 --> 00:47:51,105
I can't talk about it right now.

910
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,373
You can't talk about it,

911
00:47:52,408 --> 00:47:55,142
or you can't talk about it with me?

912
00:47:55,177 --> 00:47:58,745
Deb, this isn't the time.

913
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,381
I gotta go.

914
00:48:02,784 --> 00:48:06,154
Do you know why
I came over here tonight?

915
00:48:06,188 --> 00:48:08,523
It was for you, asshole.

916
00:48:08,558 --> 00:48:09,992
So you could talk to me.

917
00:48:10,026 --> 00:48:11,393
Talk about what?

918
00:48:11,428 --> 00:48:15,064
About whatever stuff you drove
to Nebraska to talk about.

919
00:48:15,098 --> 00:48:16,332
Deb, please just let this go.

920
00:48:16,366 --> 00:48:20,502
I am just trying to have
a conversation with you.

921
00:48:20,537 --> 00:48:22,037
Is that so fucking hard?

922
00:48:24,307 --> 00:48:27,910
Deb...

923
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:31,547
Fine.

924
00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:43,727
I don't want to hurt you, Travis.

925
00:48:43,761 --> 00:48:46,163
I think you do.

926
00:48:46,197 --> 00:48:49,267
I think you like
watching people suffer.

927
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:53,471
There's only one way to get
the demons out of your head.

928
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,964
Who's out there?

929
00:49:18,999 --> 00:49:22,001
Don't you say a word.

930
00:50:01,775 --> 00:50:03,843
Did Gellar do this to you?

931
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,048
He killed my sister.

932
00:50:09,082 --> 00:50:10,883
Where is he?

933
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:14,353
Travis, is he here?

934
00:50:43,016 --> 00:50:45,583
Ah, damn it.

935
00:50:55,593 --> 00:50:57,960
Gellar has seen me now.

936
00:50:57,995 --> 00:51:00,429
This just got much harder.

937
00:51:07,704 --> 00:51:09,237
I'll help you.

938
00:51:09,272 --> 00:51:12,374
I'll help you kill him.

939
00:51:12,408 --> 00:51:14,543
I've gotten Travis to trust me.

940
00:51:14,577 --> 00:51:16,478
In my own way, I'm going to eliminate

941
00:51:16,513 --> 00:51:18,080
a small bit of darkness

942
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:20,082
and let some light in.

943
00:51:20,797 --> 00:51:31,049
