Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

4
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:50,383
What do you think
we're up against?

5
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:51,994
I mean, leaving the intestines
on the scale

6
00:01:52,114 --> 00:01:52,934
wasn't done by accident.

7
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,767
The body part removal
could be drug-related.

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,334
It could be Santeria, voodoo.

9
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,834
Attendance in our preschool

10
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,368
guarantees your child admission
to our secondary school.

11
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,588
So you are catholic?

12
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:04,922
Actually, I'm not.

13
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:06,588
What do you believe in,
Mr. Morgan?

14
00:02:06,622 --> 00:02:09,458
Nothing. I don't believe
in anything.

15
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,053
You can believe whatever
you want to believe,

16
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:13,323
but it's not just about you
anymore.

17
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:16,709
What kind of father keeps
blood slides in his apartment?

18
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,323
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you captain Laguerta.

19
00:02:21,356 --> 00:02:23,522
[Applause]

20
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,488
It seems smaller
without your stuff.

21
00:02:25,522 --> 00:02:27,256
I had to make room for you.

22
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,789
But I'm acting Lt only.

23
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:31,389
Not if I recommend you
for the position full-time.

24
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:34,089
What is going on with you?
You're acting so weird lately.

25
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,289
Debra...

26
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:36,855
will you marry me?

27
00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:39,122
God, I sound
like a fucking idiot.

28
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:40,755
[Gunfire]
Get down, get down!

29
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,056
Everybody down!

30
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:44,588
[Gunfire, screams]

31
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:47,488
[Grunts]

32
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:51,122
- What have we got here?
- Floater.

33
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:53,488
Washed ashore.
Some lady called it in.

34
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:55,455
It doesn't look like somebody
was trying to hide him.

35
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:57,488
More like they wanted
the body to be found.

36
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:59,423
There's something inside.

37
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,122
Holy Frankenfuck!
Snakes!

38
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:03,889
This is no amateur.

39
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:05,956
So it's begun?

40
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:09,089
Yes.

41
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,156
It's begun.

42
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:23,956
Until a few days ago,

43
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,122
I was convinced there was
nothing I believed in.

44
00:03:27,156 --> 00:03:28,356
But I was wrong.

45
00:03:28,389 --> 00:03:30,729
There is something
I truly believe.

46
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:35,539
Everything's better
after a bubble bath.

47
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:39,956
Rituals are important.

48
00:03:45,655 --> 00:03:47,707
Not just for a serial killer.

49
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:49,488
But also for a two-year-old

50
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:52,089
if you want him
to go to bed on time.

51
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:53,356
[Gasps]

52
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:55,655
[Laughs]

53
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:56,956
Here, put him back.

54
00:03:56,989 --> 00:03:58,156
Not that I mind.

55
00:03:58,189 --> 00:04:00,488
This ritual has become
my favorite.

56
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:03,089
Bedtime.
Alone with my son.

57
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:04,922
Being myself.

58
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:07,423
Monster story, daddy.

59
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,588
Again?

60
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:11,522
Okay, I may have told him
this one before.

61
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:19,522
Once upon a time
there was a little chino,

62
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:22,222
scaring everyone who lived
in the hood.

63
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,323
Nobody knew what to do.

64
00:04:24,356 --> 00:04:27,389
But daddy did.

65
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:31,022
He would slay
that icky monster,

66
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:34,356
hiding what was left of him
in a special place

67
00:04:34,389 --> 00:04:37,722
that no one would ever find.

68
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:39,056
Daddy's box.

69
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,855
You know about daddy's box?

70
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,323
I always knew
this day would come.

71
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:53,989
Just not so soon.

72
00:04:54,022 --> 00:04:57,755
I'm not sure how
this next chapter goes.

73
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:06,289
Is that the last of them?

74
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,622
Just one more to go.

75
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:12,189
We'll be ready soon.

76
00:05:12,222 --> 00:05:15,455
I may be a little late
tomorrow.

77
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:19,289
And you tell me that now?

78
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:23,022
Can't help it.

79
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,222
It shouldn't take long.
Nothing's changed.

80
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:27,789
Travis, we have to find
another.

81
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:30,356
Don't you think
I already know that?

82
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,989
Now look what you've done.

83
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:41,488
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

84
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:43,722
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

85
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:47,289
- These things happen.
- [Mutters]

86
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:49,423
I just want to make sure
that, uh,

87
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:51,822
I can rely on you.

88
00:05:52,855 --> 00:05:54,356
Of course.

89
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,588
Good boy.

90
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,022
Hello.

91
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:25,855
Wow.
Full-on breakfast.

92
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:27,855
Yeah. Uh,
juice is in the fridge.

93
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:29,156
- Freshly squeezed.
- Fresh squeezed.

94
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:31,855
Well, aren't we
the fucking Kennedys.

95
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:33,522
A good breakfast is
a good way to start the day.

96
00:06:33,555 --> 00:06:36,222
Yeah, another day
of sitting on our asses,

97
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,555
waiting for OIS to clear us
on the restaurant shooting.

98
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:40,356
Pancakes?

99
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:44,056
You do realize the bar is set
very high with me and pancakes.

100
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:46,323
My dad's were the best.

101
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:50,022
What the fuck?

102
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:53,889
What are you doing?

103
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:55,956
I wanted to do this
the other night,

104
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:58,488
but the shooting sort of
messed everything up.

105
00:07:00,423 --> 00:07:02,555
Debra Morgan, will you--?

106
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,755
- Are you insane?
- Come on, Deb.

107
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,222
I'm trying
to be fuckin' romantic here.

108
00:07:06,256 --> 00:07:08,922
Romantic isn't springing
something like this on me.

109
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:12,588
When--when have we ever
talked about marriage?

110
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:15,855
Will you get up?

111
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:18,189
Come on, Deb, we've been
at this for a year.

112
00:07:18,222 --> 00:07:20,122
You--you make me happy,
I make you happy.

113
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:21,122
So?

114
00:07:21,156 --> 00:07:24,423
So...I love you.

115
00:07:24,455 --> 00:07:26,922
But...

116
00:07:26,956 --> 00:07:29,855
This is huge!

117
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:32,122
You don't like the ring?
Is it the ring?

118
00:07:32,156 --> 00:07:34,889
No, it's--

119
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,323
It's beautiful.

120
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,822
It's just...

121
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:45,588
I just need time
to think about this.

122
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,455
Take all the time you need.

123
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:49,455
[Kiss]

124
00:07:50,488 --> 00:07:52,323
I'm not going anywhere.

125
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:53,622
Pancakes are burning.

126
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:03,256
Quinn just fucking proposed
to me over fucking pancakes.

127
00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:05,423
What the fuck is wrong
with him?

128
00:08:05,455 --> 00:08:06,423
He's Quinn?

129
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:07,689
I never said

130
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:11,522
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with him.

131
00:08:11,555 --> 00:08:13,655
I take it this means
it's a "no"?

132
00:08:13,689 --> 00:08:14,789
I can only hope.

133
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:17,289
Quinn as Deb's boyfriend
is one thing.

134
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:20,356
Uncle to my son,
over his dead body.

135
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:21,423
Maybe.

136
00:08:21,455 --> 00:08:22,922
I don't know.

137
00:08:22,956 --> 00:08:25,855
I mean, I guess
Quinn makes me happy.

138
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:28,289
Really? 'Cause there's
a vein in your forehead.

139
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:32,622
Quinn and I,
we get along great,

140
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:34,156
and there's no drama.

141
00:08:34,189 --> 00:08:37,189
And after
the last couple years,

142
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:38,789
that's kind of nice.

143
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,855
But?

144
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,323
But I'm not sure I want
anything

145
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,689
more than no drama right now.

146
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:46,389
Sounds like
you have your answer.

147
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:48,323
But if I tell him "no,"
then it's over, right?

148
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:50,222
And I'm not sure I want that
either.

149
00:08:50,256 --> 00:08:54,222
God, why can't things
just stay the same?

150
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:55,889
Tell me about it.

151
00:08:55,922 --> 00:08:58,256
Come on, we're gonna be
late for the briefing.

152
00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:01,222
[Gunfire and screaming]

153
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,588
Watch this.
She totally decks him.

154
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,389
- She flattened that guy.
- Where was Quinn?

155
00:09:05,423 --> 00:09:07,323
She's already got 500,000 hits.

156
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:09,189
Hey, hey, she's coming.

157
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,989
Nice.
[Applause]

158
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:14,189
Yeah, yeah, I'm a hero.
Fuck you very much.

159
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:15,323
You've totally
gone viral, Morgan.

160
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,289
You're an Internet sensation.

161
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,622
Give it a rest, man.

162
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:20,956
What?
Dude, she's a superstar.

163
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:22,089
I mean, have you guys
read the comments on here?

164
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:23,588
Oh, she has,
and if you're the one

165
00:09:23,622 --> 00:09:25,022
that wrote the poem
about my ass--

166
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:26,555
I know not of what you speak.

167
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:28,089
And it was a limerick,
thank you.

168
00:09:28,122 --> 00:09:29,122
Can we get started, please?

169
00:09:29,156 --> 00:09:31,356
All right, everyone,
settle down.

170
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:33,389
Where are we with ballistics
from the restaurant shooting?

171
00:09:33,423 --> 00:09:35,822
Uh, all casings and bullets
are accounted for.

172
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,956
All the victims were shot
by the shooter's gun,

173
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:39,722
and no stray bullets
from Morgan or Quinn.

174
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:40,956
The shooter talking?

175
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:43,488
He was pissed off
the restaurant fired him.

176
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,056
The manager was
the first to go down.

177
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:46,323
Two dead
all because this asshole

178
00:09:46,356 --> 00:09:48,056
wanted his job back
waiting tables.

179
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,789
All right,
with the shooting behind us,

180
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,956
we put everything
into finding out

181
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,689
who did this to Omar Rivera.

182
00:09:53,722 --> 00:09:56,488
Dex, the M.E. report
come back on the fruit vendor?

183
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:57,889
Nothing we didn't already know.

184
00:09:57,922 --> 00:09:59,655
The stitches and the snakes
are definitely post-mortem.

185
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:01,789
I and my lovely new intern Ryan

186
00:10:01,822 --> 00:10:03,222
are still waiting
for the medical examiner

187
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:04,822
to return our snakes.

188
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:05,822
Keep me updated.

189
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,789
Yale is looking into our vic.

190
00:10:07,822 --> 00:10:10,655
Rivera had ties
with the Salas cartel.

191
00:10:10,689 --> 00:10:12,022
You still thinking
this is drug-related?

192
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:16,056
Well, to a cartel,
a snake is a snitch.

193
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:17,555
If this wasn't
a warning to others

194
00:10:17,588 --> 00:10:19,156
to keep their mouths shut,

195
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:20,555
I'm not sure
what the message is.

196
00:10:20,588 --> 00:10:22,423
Maybe because the message

197
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:26,289
is in a language
only I understand.

198
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:30,089
What is that holy piece
of shit doing here?

199
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:32,822
I know that piece of shit.

200
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:34,889
Or at least I did.

201
00:10:34,922 --> 00:10:36,588
Rivera worked
at Brother Sam's garage

202
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:38,256
after he got out of jail.

203
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,588
Hey, I don't like it
any more than any of you.

204
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:43,755
Maybe the padre points us
in the right direction.

205
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:46,522
Guy like that
and his ex-con fucking friends

206
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:49,622
can go to hell for all I care.

207
00:10:49,655 --> 00:10:52,522
Brother Sam?

208
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,722
One big, bad ex-con
turned minister.

209
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,089
Runs an auto body shop
using former inmates.

210
00:10:57,122 --> 00:10:58,922
And, as you can see,
some of our brothers in blue

211
00:10:58,956 --> 00:11:00,956
think it's a sham.

212
00:11:00,989 --> 00:11:02,389
They may be right.

213
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:05,323
That can't be
a man of the cloth.

214
00:11:05,356 --> 00:11:06,689
That's a killer.

215
00:11:08,056 --> 00:11:11,989
[Gunfire and screaming]

216
00:11:15,588 --> 00:11:17,889
[Knocks]

217
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:20,555
Settled in next door.

218
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:23,356
Well, that would explain
the smell of perfume.

219
00:11:25,056 --> 00:11:29,956
I was wondering, have you
gotten around to finalizing

220
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,755
Sergeant Batista's paperwork?

221
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:32,822
I'm on top of that.

222
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:34,156
Because I haven't seen anything

223
00:11:34,189 --> 00:11:35,889
come across my desk.

224
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,122
I think
the sooner the department

225
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,689
has a full-time lieutenant,
the better.

226
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:41,655
I could not agree more.

227
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:46,822
Is that all, captain?

228
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,423
That's all.

229
00:11:58,022 --> 00:12:02,323
[Gunfire and screaming]

230
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:07,323
When's the last time
you saw Rivera?

231
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:10,956
A few months ago.
He came in.

232
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:15,356
He needed some brakes
for his pickup.

233
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:17,455
He brought, uh...

234
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:21,555
ripe grapefruits and oranges.

235
00:12:21,588 --> 00:12:24,522
It was a good day.

236
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:27,522
[Clears throat]
So are you--

237
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:29,056
Are you guys any closer
to finding out

238
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:30,289
who did this to him?

239
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:33,389
Well, that's why you're here.

240
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:37,323
But I need something to go on.

241
00:12:38,622 --> 00:12:42,056
When I knew Brother Sam,
he was Samuel Wright.

242
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:44,189
A string of holdups
led to the inevitable.

243
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,855
One of his victims fought back

244
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:47,689
and Wright killed him.

245
00:12:47,722 --> 00:12:49,256
I was ready to make my move

246
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:51,655
until a drug bust took Wright
off my table.

247
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,855
And you never saw Rivera

248
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,822
hanging out
with any of his old crew?

249
00:12:54,855 --> 00:12:58,122
No, I didn't.

250
00:12:58,156 --> 00:13:00,922
Omar had moved past that world.

251
00:13:00,956 --> 00:13:03,089
He was on a righteous path.
[Chuckles]

252
00:13:03,122 --> 00:13:05,256
It's--it's funny,
'cause I remember you

253
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:07,989
saying the same thing about
the last ex-con you vouched for.

254
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,822
Remember Victor Torres?

255
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,522
He gets paroled and goes out
and kills a 19-year-old girl.

256
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:15,389
There's not a day that goes by

257
00:13:15,423 --> 00:13:17,056
that I don't pray for that girl

258
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,722
or reach out to her family.

259
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,189
Well, her blood's
on your hands.

260
00:13:20,222 --> 00:13:21,323
There's a lot more

261
00:13:21,356 --> 00:13:23,356
than that girl's blood
on my hands.

262
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:27,056
My past,

263
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:28,588
the things that I've done,

264
00:13:28,622 --> 00:13:29,922
the life that I lived,

265
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:31,455
is haunting me to this day.

266
00:13:31,488 --> 00:13:32,455
Bullshit.

267
00:13:32,488 --> 00:13:33,455
I don't give a rat's ass

268
00:13:33,488 --> 00:13:35,423
what you think about me,
you understand?

269
00:13:35,455 --> 00:13:38,356
Or the work that I do
or the men that I do it with.

270
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,956
What I do know is this.

271
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:44,323
Omar did not have this coming.

272
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:47,089
His demons were gone.

273
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:50,089
Men can change.

274
00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:54,655
Men maybe.

275
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,488
- Are we done?
- Yeah.

276
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,889
- Thanks for coming in.
- Okay.

277
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:05,822
But what about a monster?

278
00:14:13,956 --> 00:14:15,922
You wanted to see me, sir?

279
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,389
I remember
when I had this office.

280
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:22,189
Miami was a different place.

281
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:25,289
Corruption was everywhere.

282
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:29,189
My dad said you never knew
who you could trust back then.

283
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,922
Harry was one of the good ones.

284
00:14:32,423 --> 00:14:34,389
And so are you.

285
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:36,056
Thank you, sir.

286
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:38,889
That means a lot.

287
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:41,488
It's why I'm making you
Homicide's new lieutenant.

288
00:14:41,522 --> 00:14:44,956
[Laughs]
Me, right. Lieutenant.

289
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:46,822
Fuckballs, you're serious.

290
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:49,089
Oh, f--sir.

291
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,122
You're exactly what
this department needs.

292
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,689
A fresh face, new ideas.

293
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:55,089
Wait, really?

294
00:14:55,122 --> 00:14:56,722
You want me in charge?

295
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,356
I don't even know what to say.

296
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:03,455
- Well, yes would work.
- But this is Batista's job.

297
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,622
He's expecting it.
He's earned it.

298
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,156
Well, Sergeant Batista's
a fine officer,

299
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,822
but he comes with
certain, uh, baggage.

300
00:15:10,855 --> 00:15:12,455
Besides, he's not a hero.

301
00:15:12,488 --> 00:15:13,722
You are.

302
00:15:13,755 --> 00:15:15,122
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

303
00:15:15,156 --> 00:15:16,222
I was just doing my job.

304
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:17,356
That's not how I see it.

305
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:18,855
That's not how
the city sees it.

306
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,689
No. This office needs
someone like you.

307
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:26,156
Oh, my God.
Dexter would flip out.

308
00:15:26,189 --> 00:15:29,822
And poor Masuka. I'd be
that little fuck's boss.

309
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:32,956
I'd be everybody's boss.

310
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:36,989
This is an honor.

311
00:15:37,022 --> 00:15:39,389
Do you really think I'm ready
for something like this?

312
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:42,722
Listen, I know this is
a lot to take in.

313
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:45,755
We can talk about it more
tomorrow, okay?

314
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:51,855
Congratulations, lieutenant.

315
00:15:57,488 --> 00:15:59,655
Lieutenant.

316
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:06,855
What the fuck
is going on today?

317
00:16:08,588 --> 00:16:11,056
Keep your eyes
on the bouncing ball

318
00:16:11,089 --> 00:16:14,689
and not on daddy's
bad pictures.

319
00:16:14,722 --> 00:16:17,488
Samuel Wright killed
this store owner in cold blood.

320
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:19,455
Bashed in his head
with a bottle.

321
00:16:19,488 --> 00:16:21,855
Now he's calling himself
Brother Sam,

322
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:24,156
professing to be a changed man.

323
00:16:24,189 --> 00:16:25,256
But I can't tell if I'm seeing

324
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:27,256
a man who's changed
for the better

325
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:29,356
or just a better cover.

326
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:30,389
Daddy's box.

327
00:16:31,755 --> 00:16:35,622
You want to put this
in daddy's box?

328
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:37,056
Thank you.

329
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:43,156
It seems like yesterday
he was just learning to crawl.

330
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,289
Daddy's box.

331
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:49,922
Or he's putting
all the pieces together.

332
00:16:49,956 --> 00:16:53,555
What I say, what I do.

333
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:56,423
Where things go.

334
00:16:56,455 --> 00:16:57,889
I'll be more careful.

335
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:00,256
Is that gonna be enough?

336
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,056
[Knock on door]

337
00:17:04,989 --> 00:17:08,022
You're looking at Homicide's
new fucking lieutenant.

338
00:17:08,056 --> 00:17:09,855
I know, right?

339
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:11,722
Got any beer?

340
00:17:11,755 --> 00:17:12,789
[Door closes]

341
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:18,323
That's quite the day.
Lieutenant.

342
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:19,989
Nope.

343
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:25,022
Two beers in, and it still
sounds fucking weird.

344
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:27,922
I can't do this.

345
00:17:27,956 --> 00:17:31,423
And it totally dicks Batista.

346
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:35,356
What could Matthews
possibly be thinking?

347
00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:37,789
That you're smart,
you're driven,

348
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:39,956
you're a great detective.

349
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:43,022
Who'll be leading the department
that may hunt me down one day.

350
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,755
[Sighs]

351
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:46,555
You should give yourself
some credit.

352
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:47,822
You should give me
another beer.

353
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:51,622
I'm empty here.

354
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:53,956
You ever wonder why dad
never made Lt?

355
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,588
He had his hands full.
With me.

356
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:58,755
Everyone talked about him
like he was some super cop,

357
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,222
but he stayed in the pen
his whole career.

358
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,389
Maybe he never wanted it.

359
00:18:04,423 --> 00:18:07,488
You know, after his funeral,

360
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:12,588
a tiny part of me was relieved.

361
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:17,455
I tried so hard to get him
to pay attention to me.

362
00:18:17,488 --> 00:18:18,855
And I thought with him gone,

363
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,689
I wouldn't need his approval
anymore, but...

364
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:22,755
[Laughs]

365
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:24,522
20 years later, I still do.

366
00:18:24,555 --> 00:18:27,189
He's still up here in my head.

367
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,522
You don't say.

368
00:18:28,555 --> 00:18:31,089
The weird thing is,
if I take this job,

369
00:18:31,122 --> 00:18:34,689
I'll have achieved more
than he ever did on the force.

370
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:37,256
And that's the part that scares
the shit out of me.

371
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,922
Not sure I follow.

372
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:40,022
Dad was my litmus test

373
00:18:40,056 --> 00:18:42,855
for what a real cop
is supposed to be.

374
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,789
And if he never made
lieutenant--

375
00:18:44,822 --> 00:18:47,289
Then you have no one
to compare yourself to.

376
00:18:47,323 --> 00:18:48,555
And I don't want to be
fucking Laguerta.

377
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:49,889
[Laughs]

378
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:53,423
So how would I even know
if I was doing a good job?

379
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:56,555
I'd be totally all on my own
on this.

380
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:57,789
Well, if you don't want
the job, don't take it.

381
00:18:57,822 --> 00:19:01,323
Fuck you.
Of course I want it.

382
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:04,323
[Laughs] Holy shit,
I really want it.

383
00:19:04,356 --> 00:19:08,956
[Phone ringing]

384
00:19:08,989 --> 00:19:10,855
Quinn again.

385
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:12,522
What the fuck does he want?

386
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:15,056
Out on a limb here,
but maybe an answer

387
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,189
as to whether you
want to be Debra Quinn?

388
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,356
Jesus h. Fuck,
I totally forgot.

389
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:21,922
[Laughs] Debra Quinn.

390
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:24,488
Your initials would be DQ.

391
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:25,488
Like the--

392
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:27,156
I will kill you.

393
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:31,855
I have no idea
what to say to him.

394
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:34,889
I've got to stall.

395
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:36,522
Can I sleep here?

396
00:19:36,555 --> 00:19:39,056
About one life-altering decision
a day is my max.

397
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:41,488
Yeah. I'll sleep on the couch
in the other room.

398
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:43,755
That's why you don't suck
as a brother.

399
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:48,488
Yeah, but what about
as a father?

400
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:54,056
[Water running]

401
00:20:01,922 --> 00:20:05,056
[Dishes clatter]

402
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,056
Aah!

403
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,089
Oh, Travis!

404
00:20:22,122 --> 00:20:24,289
God damn it.

405
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:26,655
Really wish you wouldn't
use that word.

406
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:27,755
Well, maybe I wouldn't

407
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,488
if my brother would
use the doorbell.

408
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,289
[Sighs, then laughs]

409
00:20:34,323 --> 00:20:36,989
You really scared me.

410
00:20:43,122 --> 00:20:44,922
Slow down.

411
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:48,256
And save some room for dessert.

412
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,056
I told you
I have to work tonight.

413
00:20:52,323 --> 00:20:54,555
You're working too much.

414
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,122
I can see it in your face.

415
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,156
I like to keep busy.

416
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,488
You want busy,

417
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:05,822
try keeping a bunch of
fifth graders focused on art.

418
00:21:05,855 --> 00:21:07,488
Today, all they
could talk about was,

419
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:10,855
they found another flock of
those dead birds up north.

420
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:13,689
They think it's the end
of the world or something.

421
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:18,289
What if it were?

422
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:22,056
Uh, then I'd say we better
eat this ice cream fast.

423
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,555
No, I-I-I can't stay.
I have to go.

424
00:21:24,588 --> 00:21:26,622
Oh, come on.
Blow off work for once.

425
00:21:26,655 --> 00:21:28,323
For me.

426
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:30,555
I barely get to see you
anymore.

427
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:34,122
Well, that was before...

428
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:36,122
Before what?

429
00:21:38,555 --> 00:21:40,022
[Sighs]

430
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:42,555
It's nothing.

431
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:46,189
Travis, we used to be so close.

432
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,389
We used to talk and do things.

433
00:21:49,423 --> 00:21:53,323
Now it's like pulling teeth
just to see you for an hour.

434
00:21:53,356 --> 00:21:55,289
I miss you.

435
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,689
I miss you too.

436
00:21:58,722 --> 00:22:02,455
Then let me spend an evening
with my baby brother.

437
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,089
Please?

438
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,722
[Crash]

439
00:22:33,755 --> 00:22:36,455
Now, who put that there?

440
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:46,555
[Groans]

441
00:22:49,722 --> 00:22:52,056
Good thing I have just the place
to get this fixed.

442
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:55,222
[Chatter]

443
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:58,222
[Both speaking Spanish]

444
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,822
If Brother Sam believes
in giving men like this

445
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:14,722
a second chance,

446
00:23:14,755 --> 00:23:17,822
who am I to deny him one
on my table?

447
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,822
You here about Eddie?

448
00:23:20,855 --> 00:23:22,922
What?

449
00:23:22,956 --> 00:23:26,423
Eddie.
You here about Eddie?

450
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:27,455
His parole agent.

451
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,956
Oh, no, I'm just a customer.

452
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:30,256
I dinged my car.

453
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:33,289
Is, uh, Brother Sam here?

454
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:36,956
He's out back.

455
00:23:47,423 --> 00:23:48,522
Can I help you?

456
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,455
Yeah. I was hoping
to get an estimate.

457
00:23:51,689 --> 00:23:53,588
You're not from around here,
are you?

458
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:55,789
Your shop came
highly recommended.

459
00:23:55,822 --> 00:23:57,488
By who?

460
00:23:57,522 --> 00:23:59,889
Co-worker.

461
00:24:02,488 --> 00:24:04,588
- You out front?
- Mm-hmm.

462
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:10,189
Was that the Holy Spirit?

463
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:13,323
Or his Dark Passenger
checking out mine?

464
00:24:13,356 --> 00:24:17,156
Yeah, my guys can
have this out in a day or two.

465
00:24:20,755 --> 00:24:25,022
Good shepherd.
What's that mean, exactly?

466
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:29,022
Well, uh, the men you see here,

467
00:24:29,056 --> 00:24:30,755
they're like my flock.

468
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:33,755
And, uh, my job is to make sure

469
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,822
that they don't wander.

470
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:38,722
That's a lot to take on.

471
00:24:38,755 --> 00:24:41,122
Yeah, well, I got a lot
to answer for.

472
00:24:41,156 --> 00:24:43,889
[Speaking Spanish]

473
00:24:43,922 --> 00:24:46,289
Nothing broke that
can't be fixed, right?

474
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:47,289
[Speaking Spanish]

475
00:24:47,323 --> 00:24:48,289
[Laughs]

476
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:50,056
Lord have mercy.

477
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,289
No car is ever totaled.

478
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:55,689
Yeah, it's like a man's life.

479
00:24:55,722 --> 00:24:57,056
Like a man's soul.

480
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:59,089
I oughta know that.

481
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:04,789
You know, I once killed a man
and walked off scot-free?

482
00:25:04,822 --> 00:25:06,056
For that I need...

483
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,789
- To pay.
- To pay.

484
00:25:08,822 --> 00:25:10,056
I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

485
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:11,056
Don't be.

486
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:13,122
The spirit moves me

487
00:25:13,156 --> 00:25:16,022
to tell my story and share.

488
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,789
I was facing death row.

489
00:25:18,822 --> 00:25:21,689
The judge presiding
over my case

490
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:23,356
suddenly dropped dead.

491
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,822
Mistrial?

492
00:25:24,855 --> 00:25:26,156
[Laughs]

493
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:28,522
Yeah. It sounds like
divine intervention.

494
00:25:28,555 --> 00:25:29,689
Yeah.

495
00:25:29,722 --> 00:25:32,689
Oh, God was playing me
all right, you know.

496
00:25:32,722 --> 00:25:35,722
I had to go out here
and get good and high

497
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:38,356
before he just said, son,
that's enough.

498
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:41,655
And, uh, I get stopped.

499
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:43,922
Possession charge.
I go back to jail.

500
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:46,722
But hallelujah, praise God,

501
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:49,022
that's how I got saved.

502
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,755
So that darkness inside,
it's gone?

503
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:54,122
No.

504
00:25:54,156 --> 00:25:58,455
It's still there, but I'm
fighting its ass every day.

505
00:25:58,488 --> 00:26:01,789
I really don't have
much of a choice, you know?

506
00:26:03,156 --> 00:26:07,455
I sacrificed
that bad part of my soul

507
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,389
to make up for some
of the pain I caused.

508
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:14,789
Nick still hasn't showed.

509
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:17,022
You find him and you tell him
I'm coming for him,

510
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:18,356
you understand?

511
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:21,555
Now.
Tell him now.

512
00:26:25,289 --> 00:26:28,289
One of the flock get lost?

513
00:26:28,323 --> 00:26:31,323
Yeah, something like that.

514
00:26:31,356 --> 00:26:32,356
[Clears throat]

515
00:26:32,389 --> 00:26:36,389
So, uh, what do you say there,
brother?

516
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:42,423
Guess I'll be seeing you soon.

517
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:45,056
All right.

518
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:46,789
You have a blessed day.

519
00:26:50,622 --> 00:26:53,956
Once we work our magic,
we put it up on the board here.

520
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,822
What are the abbreviations?

521
00:26:55,855 --> 00:26:57,755
What was run.
Uh, TR is trace.

522
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:59,356
TX, toxicology.

523
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:02,488
So where does everything go
after it's been run?

524
00:27:02,522 --> 00:27:04,522
Inquisitive.
I like.

525
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:06,022
[Both laugh]

526
00:27:06,056 --> 00:27:08,022
Evidence, down the hall.

527
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:11,588
Whoa. Cool.

528
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:15,789
Oh, yeah. Medical examiner
finally sent 'em over.

529
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:17,956
They don't make you squeamish?

530
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:19,689
Are you kidding?

531
00:27:19,722 --> 00:27:21,855
I love this.

532
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:23,423
Me too.

533
00:27:30,655 --> 00:27:32,256
Vince.

534
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:36,522
Hands off.

535
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:37,755
She's my student.

536
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,689
Yeah, and a lawsuit
landing on my desk

537
00:27:39,722 --> 00:27:40,956
if she catches you
staring like that.

538
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:42,022
Sounds like someone's expecting

539
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:44,423
to make
lieutenant buzz-kill.

540
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:53,256
Take these files
down to central booking.

541
00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:55,622

with the CI lab

542
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:56,922
and get back to me right away.

543
00:27:56,956 --> 00:27:58,356
Yes, sir.

Wow.
You really drink that swill?

546

Keeps me young.

547
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:13,056
How about we go
around the corner

548
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,122
and I buy you
a real cup of coffee?

549
00:28:14,156 --> 00:28:17,822
- My treat.
- Okay.

550
00:28:17,855 --> 00:28:20,889
Dexter, you got a minute?

551
00:28:20,922 --> 00:28:21,889
Yeah, I need to get to my lab.

552
00:28:21,922 --> 00:28:24,089
Has Deb mentioned
anything to you,

553
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:25,089

554

She, uh, said you proposed.

555
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:27,122
And?

royally, didn't I?

I wouldn't know.

559
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:34,289
Look, I know you and I
have had our differences,

560
00:28:34,323 --> 00:28:35,822
but it would really
mean a lot to me

561
00:28:35,855 --> 00:28:37,689
if you could help me out here.

562
00:28:37,722 --> 00:28:39,189
Well, this is between
you and Deb.

563
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:40,323
No, I know.

564
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:42,122
It's just, I don't
want her to feel

565
00:28:42,156 --> 00:28:46,389
like she has to, you know,
choose between you or me.

566
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:48,256
She doesn't.

567
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:51,289
Because it is never
going to be you.

568
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:53,522
No, I got it.

569
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:56,622
- I said it was my treat.
- I got it. Here.

570
00:28:56,655 --> 00:28:58,655
I can afford it.

What is it?

572
00:29:03,922 --> 00:29:08,056
I just wanted to let you know

573
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:11,622
that I'm the detective I am
because of you.

574
00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:13,922
Thank you.

you're like family to me.

Angel, Matthews has asked me
to be the new lieutenant.

582
00:29:35,622 --> 00:29:38,555
I'm sorry. I know how much
you wanted this.

583
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:43,488
What did you say?

584
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:45,555
That you should be
the new lieutenant, not me.

585
00:29:45,588 --> 00:29:47,323
What did he say?

586
00:29:47,356 --> 00:29:49,789
He wouldn't listen.

587
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:52,588
I could never, ever do this job
without your blessing,

588
00:29:52,622 --> 00:29:53,822
so you just say the word,

589
00:29:53,855 --> 00:29:56,956
and I'll tell Matthews
to go fuck himself.

590
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:04,222
This...

591
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:05,789
is really great.

592
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:09,622
You mean that?

593
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:10,956
Damn right.

594
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:13,689
It's about time a real cop
had that job.

595
00:30:15,555 --> 00:30:17,156
I couldn't be happier.

596
00:30:17,189 --> 00:30:19,822
Come here.

597
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:23,189
I'm gonna need
that money back, though.

I just found out about Morgan.

I'm so sorry.

603
00:30:37,222 --> 00:30:39,022
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

604
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:41,689
I was on the fence about this
whole lieutenant thing anyway.

605
00:30:41,722 --> 00:30:44,222
Look, this has nothing
to do with you.

Matthews is just using Morgan
to get back at me,

607
00:30:47,256 --> 00:30:48,488
but it won't work.

608
00:30:48,522 --> 00:30:50,156
I mean, she's barely
out of diapers.

00:30:50,189 --> 00:30:52,122
Don't do that.

Better than you ever were.

Look, you're angry, and you
have every right to be,

613

but I will fix this.

- I--
- Enough, Maria, enough.

paying the price?

he killed that man.

720
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,922
You kill him or me,

721
00:37:41,956 --> 00:37:45,389
you'll have the whole department
after you.

722
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:48,722
Yo, Julio, let's get
the fuck out of here.

723
00:37:48,755 --> 00:37:50,156
This ain't over.

724
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:53,423
Well, until it is,
I'm praying for you, son.

725
00:37:53,455 --> 00:37:56,222
Well, you best be praying
I don't put you down

726
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:57,755
like the last fuck-up
that crossed me.

727
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,889
Remember Hector Nunez?

728
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:03,789
They never found his body,
did they?

729
00:38:03,822 --> 00:38:05,588
[Engine starts]

730
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,689
[Engine revs]

731
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:14,822
That was--

732
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:16,989
That was a miracle.

733
00:38:18,156 --> 00:38:19,989
Miami Metro?

734
00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:23,356
Forensics department.

735
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:24,922
Lab geek.

736
00:38:24,956 --> 00:38:26,056
They didn't need to know that.

737
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:29,022
You don't fight
like no lab geek.

738
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:33,156
[Laughs]

739
00:38:33,189 --> 00:38:34,455
Lord have mercy.

740
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:38,189
It's just an evening full
of wonders tonight, huh?

741
00:38:38,222 --> 00:38:43,122
Praise God. The lord works
in mysterious ways.

742
00:38:43,156 --> 00:38:45,189
You don't say.

743
00:39:03,323 --> 00:39:06,655
Where were you last night?

744
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:08,689
My sister's.

745
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:13,356
She was worried about me.

746
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:15,555
I couldn't get away.

747
00:39:15,588 --> 00:39:19,222
You know that she
can't be saved, right?

748
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:22,222
She is a good person.

749
00:39:23,755 --> 00:39:26,722
She's all that I have.

750
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:29,989
You know that isn't true.

751
00:39:30,022 --> 00:39:33,922
You have me
and you have God now.

752
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:35,855
But I see

753
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:38,555
you have to be
reminded of that.

754
00:39:41,122 --> 00:39:43,655
Is this what you want, Travis?

755
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,389
[Groans]

756
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:54,222
To hurt me.

757
00:39:54,256 --> 00:39:56,289
You see how I suffer
for your sins?

758
00:39:56,323 --> 00:39:57,855
Stop!

759
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:01,222
I won't see her again.

760
00:40:02,555 --> 00:40:04,755
I won't.

761
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:07,189
I swear.

762
00:40:07,222 --> 00:40:11,289
It's my job
to take care of you.

763
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:12,389
Not hers.

764
00:40:12,423 --> 00:40:14,389
Forgive me.

765
00:40:16,189 --> 00:40:19,956
I will do better.

766
00:40:19,989 --> 00:40:24,389
I will show you
that I'm worthy.

767
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:28,522
[Crying]

768
00:40:30,655 --> 00:40:32,655
[Sighs]

769
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:39,755
Oh, fuck me.

770
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:44,855
Hey.

771
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:46,389
So...

772
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:49,922
You shouldn't have.

773
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:51,256
Really.

774
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:52,922
You know, I figured if,
you know,

775
00:40:52,956 --> 00:40:54,956
we're gonna talk,
then why not over Chinese

776
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,922
from that place you like?

777
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,356
- Beer's in the--
- I can't marry you.

778
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:01,455
- fridge.
- I'm sorry.

779
00:41:01,488 --> 00:41:04,323
You're so good to me,
but I can't.

780
00:41:07,455 --> 00:41:10,256
Well, if you don't
want to be with me,

781
00:41:10,289 --> 00:41:11,922
then why are you with me?

782
00:41:11,956 --> 00:41:14,389
Because...

783
00:41:14,423 --> 00:41:17,056
It wasn't...

784
00:41:17,089 --> 00:41:18,555
This.

785
00:41:18,588 --> 00:41:20,089
Oh.

786
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:24,455
I'm sorry for wanting to be
an adult here, Deb, but--

787
00:41:24,488 --> 00:41:26,855
I never meant to hurt you.

788
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:30,522
Or lead you on.

789
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:32,989
I just like things
the way they are.

790
00:41:37,455 --> 00:41:39,289
Yeah.

791
00:41:39,323 --> 00:41:41,323
That's, um,

792
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:42,855
not good enough, you know?

793
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:44,755
I want more.

794
00:41:44,789 --> 00:41:47,423
That's the problem.

795
00:41:47,455 --> 00:41:50,256
I don't.

796
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:56,289
- You are a great--
- You know what? Just don't.

797
00:41:56,323 --> 00:41:59,323
Don't be here when I
get back, all right?

798
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:02,222
[Door slams]

799
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:07,089
Oh, and I'm your new boss.

800
00:42:25,622 --> 00:42:27,455
Just tell the little guy
a story?

801
00:42:27,488 --> 00:42:29,689
Jamie put him to bed.

802
00:42:29,722 --> 00:42:32,256
[Typing]

803
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:35,289
Looks like Brother Sam's
a changed man after all.

804
00:42:35,323 --> 00:42:38,256
He was true to his word
about being a good shepherd.

805
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,689
He put his own life
on the line to save that kid

806
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:41,956
from a pack of wolves.

807
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:46,389
And here's the leader
of the pack.

808
00:42:46,423 --> 00:42:48,755
Harrison eventually is going
to need a good shepherd too.

809
00:42:50,689 --> 00:42:52,655
I'll be there for him.

810
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:55,122
And what about him?

811
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,022
[Takes deep breath]

812
00:42:58,056 --> 00:42:59,222
I was set on proving

813
00:42:59,256 --> 00:43:01,455
Brother Sam still deserves
to be on my table,

814
00:43:01,488 --> 00:43:02,689
but miraculously,

815
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:07,256
Julio goes and vets himself
to take his place.

816
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:10,256
Hector Nunez was a barber
in Julio's neighborhood.

817
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,655
Went missing six months ago.

818
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:15,089
No body.

819
00:43:15,122 --> 00:43:17,588
The Almighty at work?

820
00:43:17,622 --> 00:43:20,922
I'm not ready to call Julio
a sign from God,

821
00:43:20,956 --> 00:43:23,022
but I am thankful
for the bounty

822
00:43:23,056 --> 00:43:25,755
I am about to receive.

823
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:28,056
[Water running]

824
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:29,423
[Dishes clatter]

825
00:43:29,455 --> 00:43:30,889
I have any clean shirts?

826
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:32,956
Your room.
Or former room.

827
00:43:32,989 --> 00:43:34,622
Deb being here is temporary.

828
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:36,555
Who doesn't
rinse out their bowl?

829
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:39,289
Temporary, I promise.

830
00:43:39,323 --> 00:43:41,289
Deb.
[Knocks]

831
00:43:41,323 --> 00:43:42,555
I need a shirt.

832
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,356
What do you think?

833
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:50,389
Dad would be proud.

834
00:43:50,423 --> 00:43:52,056
Thanks again for
letting me crash here

835
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:53,689
until I find a place.

836
00:43:53,722 --> 00:43:56,222
It's why I don't suck,
remember?

837
00:43:57,289 --> 00:43:59,822
Just help Jamie out
when you can.

838
00:43:59,855 --> 00:44:03,855
Am I making the biggest
mistake of my life?

839
00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:08,222
[Sighs]

840
00:44:08,256 --> 00:44:09,689
I don't know, Deb.

841
00:44:09,722 --> 00:44:10,922
As Harrison gets older,

842
00:44:10,956 --> 00:44:12,989
I've been thinking more
about what I believe in.

843
00:44:13,022 --> 00:44:15,022
I'm coming to find that
the list is kind of short.

844
00:44:15,056 --> 00:44:16,488
[Laughs]

845
00:44:16,522 --> 00:44:19,588
What do any of us
really believe in?

846
00:44:19,622 --> 00:44:22,822
That you'll be
a great lieutenant.

847
00:44:22,855 --> 00:44:25,089
[Laughs]

848
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:28,256
Screw dad. I'm gonna
make you proud of me.

849
00:44:29,555 --> 00:44:31,689
Dissected
all seven baby snakes.

850
00:44:31,722 --> 00:44:33,056
Stomachs were empty.

851
00:44:33,089 --> 00:44:34,855
They didn't come
from a pet store.

852
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,455
Most likely the wild.

853
00:44:36,488 --> 00:44:37,889
Back to square one.

854
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:39,488
[Click]

855
00:44:39,522 --> 00:44:42,555
[Sighs]

856
00:44:42,588 --> 00:44:44,156
Remember Barry Manilow tickets.

857
00:44:44,189 --> 00:44:45,755
Toxicology's back.

858
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:47,588
On--on what?
The board is clear.

859
00:44:47,622 --> 00:44:48,956
The snakes.

860
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:51,323
I hope you don't mind,
but I ran tissue samples.

861
00:44:51,356 --> 00:44:54,588
Uh, wh--which I, uh,
would have done.

862
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:56,922
And look.
Heavy metals.

863
00:44:56,956 --> 00:44:58,289
If there was nothing
in the bellies of the snakes,

864
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:00,689
where did it come from?

865
00:45:00,722 --> 00:45:05,389
Uh, from mama snake.

866
00:45:05,423 --> 00:45:07,689
Who had to have been living
in a toxic environment

867
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:09,356
to pass it on to her young.

868
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:11,056
You wanna look up
EPA cleanup sites

869
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:12,555
or should I?

870
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:16,022
I'd rather look up your--

871
00:45:16,056 --> 00:45:20,588
I mean, I didn't--
I wasn't--

872
00:45:20,622 --> 00:45:21,956
Please don't sue.

873
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:25,056
You like to watch.

874
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,222
Good to know.

875
00:45:28,256 --> 00:45:30,122
[Exhales]

876
00:45:30,156 --> 00:45:31,256
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

877
00:45:31,289 --> 00:45:33,722
Morgan as lieutenant?

878
00:45:33,755 --> 00:45:35,655
Yes. I was just sending over
the paperwork.

879
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:37,423
Fuck you, Tom.

880
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,222
You get one of those
as captain,

881
00:45:39,256 --> 00:45:41,056
but don't push your luck,
Maria.

882
00:45:41,089 --> 00:45:43,822
We agreed the new lieutenant
would be Batista.

883
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:44,889
I agreed to nothing.

884
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:45,889
And need I remind you

885
00:45:45,922 --> 00:45:46,889
that all personnel decisions

886
00:45:46,922 --> 00:45:48,689
are ultimately my decision.

887
00:45:48,722 --> 00:45:50,056
If they weren't,

888
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:53,889
your little plan to blackmail me
wouldn't have worked.

889
00:45:53,922 --> 00:45:56,522
This is gonna be
a fucking disaster,

890
00:45:56,555 --> 00:45:57,922
and I won't take
the fall for it.

891
00:45:57,956 --> 00:46:00,289
Well, we'll see, won't we?

892
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:03,122
Oh! Better hurry.
Don't want to be late.

893
00:46:03,156 --> 00:46:04,455
For what?

894
00:46:04,488 --> 00:46:07,922
Your first official task,
captain.

895
00:46:10,622 --> 00:46:12,122
The Everglades?

896
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:14,356
All 4,000 square miles of it?
That's your big break?

897
00:46:14,389 --> 00:46:15,855
Oh, I never said
the Everglades.

898
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:19,655
I said hazardous waste sites
near or around the Everglades.

899
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:20,855
It would explain

900
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:22,056
where the pollutants
in the snakes came from.

901
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:23,956
Yeah.
We narrowed this down.

902
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:27,356
Someone could have seen
the bad guys coming or going.

903
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:30,256
[Sighs]

904
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,622
I suppose it's a start.

905
00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:34,822
What gives
with all the reporters?

906
00:46:34,855 --> 00:46:38,089
We're getting a new lieutenant.

907
00:46:40,655 --> 00:46:42,822
What the fuck
did you say to Deb?

908
00:46:42,855 --> 00:46:44,222
Good morning to you too.

909
00:46:44,256 --> 00:46:45,622
You know, everything was fine

910
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:47,289
until she spent the night
at your place.

911
00:46:47,323 --> 00:46:48,989
You know,
she's made her choice,

912
00:46:49,022 --> 00:46:50,455
but it's not you or me.

913
00:46:50,488 --> 00:46:53,289
Press conference is starting.

914
00:46:58,588 --> 00:47:00,855
Everyone,

915
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:04,423
thank you for coming
on such short notice.

916
00:47:04,455 --> 00:47:07,956
You're here today because
it's my privilege

917
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:10,855
to introduce
an officer who--

918
00:47:10,889 --> 00:47:14,588
well, under my watch
has proven herself to be

919
00:47:14,622 --> 00:47:16,356
one of Miami's finest

920
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:18,689
and a true friend.

921
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:20,222
Ladies and gentlemen,

922
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:22,423
I give you the youngest officer

923
00:47:22,455 --> 00:47:23,555
ever to make lieutenant

924
00:47:23,588 --> 00:47:26,588
in the history
of Miami Metro Homicide--

925
00:47:26,622 --> 00:47:29,222
Debra Morgan.

926
00:47:29,256 --> 00:47:33,855
[Applause]

927
00:47:51,323 --> 00:47:53,655
I gotta hand it to you, Julio.

928
00:47:53,689 --> 00:47:56,289
You ran quite a racket.

929
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:57,555
I read all about

930
00:47:57,588 --> 00:48:02,122
how you were shaking down
local business owners

931
00:48:02,156 --> 00:48:05,056
like Hector Nunez.

932
00:48:09,622 --> 00:48:10,689
You.

933
00:48:10,722 --> 00:48:12,423
You recognize
this shop, don't you?

934
00:48:12,488 --> 00:48:13,622
Fuck you.

935
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:17,022
My boys will fuckin'
kill you for this.

936
00:48:17,056 --> 00:48:18,022
Let me guess.

937
00:48:18,056 --> 00:48:20,889
With your history of violence,

938
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:24,488
Hector stood up
to you and your gang

939
00:48:24,522 --> 00:48:27,522
and that's why they never
found his body.

940
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:31,256
Just the way
they'll never find yours.

941
00:48:31,289 --> 00:48:33,356
Yeah, I killed him.
So what?

942
00:48:33,389 --> 00:48:36,588
You're a dead man.
My boys will f--

943
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:38,789
[Muffled shout]

944
00:48:38,822 --> 00:48:40,488
Will miss you, I'm sure.

945
00:48:40,522 --> 00:48:42,789
So I'll make this quick.

946
00:48:42,822 --> 00:48:44,588
[Muffled screams]

947
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:48,855
I have to get home.

948
00:48:48,889 --> 00:48:51,256
I have a much more important
ritual to tend to.

949
00:48:53,323 --> 00:48:57,722
You must be thinking "why me"
right about now.

950
00:50:00,323 --> 00:50:02,389
[Laughs]

951
00:50:04,555 --> 00:50:07,655
Hands up, and...
[Imitates explosion]

952
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:10,122
Good job.

953
00:50:10,156 --> 00:50:12,655
The good thing about
the mind of a two-year-old--

954
00:50:12,689 --> 00:50:14,122
it's easily distracted.

955
00:50:14,156 --> 00:50:16,156
You want to roll it?

956
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:19,389
Ooh.

957
00:50:19,423 --> 00:50:23,256
He won't remember daddy's box
if he has one of his own.

958
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:31,022
Monster story, daddy.

959
00:50:31,056 --> 00:50:34,122
How about a new story?

960
00:50:37,222 --> 00:50:38,889
[Gasps]

961
00:50:38,922 --> 00:50:43,423
"Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs.

962
00:50:43,455 --> 00:50:47,555
The first little pig
built a house of straw."

963
00:50:48,622 --> 00:50:53,356
"The second, a house of sticks.

964
00:50:53,389 --> 00:50:57,289
And the third,
a house of bricks."

965
00:50:59,822 --> 00:51:03,289
"But along came
the big, bad wolf."

966
00:51:04,423 --> 00:51:06,822
Wolves come in many forms.

967
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:10,789
Some have big eyes,
the better to see you with.

968
00:51:10,822 --> 00:51:13,789
You want to connect this part.
That's the joiner.

969
00:51:13,822 --> 00:51:17,189
Others huff and puff...

970
00:51:17,222 --> 00:51:19,056
- Hey, you all right?
- [Sighs] No.

971
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:20,722
While others
hide in plain sight.

972
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:21,789
I think I sprained my ankle.

973
00:51:21,822 --> 00:51:22,789
Really? Here,
let's take a look at it.

974
00:51:22,822 --> 00:51:23,922
I heard something snap.

975
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:24,922
What, did you fall down
or something?

976
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:25,922
Yeah.

977
00:51:25,956 --> 00:51:28,356
I should know,
because like it or not,

978
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:29,423
I'm one too.

979
00:51:29,455 --> 00:51:32,488
That's never going to change.

980
00:51:37,356 --> 00:51:39,423
And neither is the fact
my little lamb

981
00:51:39,455 --> 00:51:41,689
is becoming a little boy.

982
00:51:41,722 --> 00:51:45,889
Walking. Talking.
Listening.

983
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,755
As much as I want Harrison
to stay this way forever,

984
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:53,655
from now on,
the only wolves in his life

985
00:51:53,689 --> 00:51:56,922
have to be the stuff
of fairy tales.

986
00:51:56,956 --> 00:51:59,922
I can no longer allow him
to see the real me.

987
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:02,881
Only the version
that's make-believe.

988
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:06,056
It's the only way this story
gets to have a happy ending.

989
