2
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:48,064
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,132 --> 00:01:50,299
So far our killer has given us
three tableaus--

4
00:01:50,334 --> 00:01:52,400
the intestines in the scale,

5
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:53,468
the snakes victim,

6
00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:54,937
and the four horsemen.

7
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:56,372
What about the numbers
we found on the body,

8
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:57,806
1237 and 1242?

9
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,308
He's counting up to something.

10
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:02,177
Maybe it's to the end
of the world.

11
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:04,714
- Dexter.
- Sam, what are you doing here?

12
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:07,917
Brother Sam?
Are you guys, like, friends now?

13
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:09,818
We have a lead.

14
00:02:09,852 --> 00:02:11,820
This revelation expert
James Gellar.

15
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:14,323
The professor from
the University of Tallahassee?

16
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:17,058
Looks like we just found our
number one person of interest.

17
00:02:17,092 --> 00:02:19,326
You're going out
with that woman, aren't you?

18
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,961
You knew this was gonna happen.

19
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:22,795
She's part of God's plan now.

20
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,965
Is this Doomsday number two?

21
00:02:39,177 --> 00:02:40,577
During the middle ages,

22
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:43,814
it was believed that the outcome
of nearly all earthly events

23
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:45,782
was decided by angels,

24
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,851
either light or dark.

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,854
I'm quite certain
that face I saw in the crowd

26
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:55,858
was of the dark variety.

27
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:03,866
Unfortunately, he's chosen
to remain anonymous.

28
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,033
He left no trace DNA,

29
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,202
no sweat, no saliva,

30
00:03:07,236 --> 00:03:09,603
no prints.

31
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:34,629
A small repair.

32
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:40,902
Something skin-like.

33
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:49,879
Not your normal glue.

34
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:51,580
Despite his wish
to remain hidden,

35
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:53,949
I may find a way
to yank him out of the shadows

36
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,084
after all.

37
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,908
Eyes on God, not me.

38
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,746
And all God's people said...

39
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,048
Amen.

40
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,016
Help me up.

41
00:04:30,622 --> 00:04:32,890
It's time to do
a little hunting.

42
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:35,726
I thought
that we had some time.

43
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,262
You still don't hear him.

44
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,901
I've been fasting and praying

45
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:44,402
for days, and all I can hear

46
00:04:44,437 --> 00:04:48,106
is the sound of my own voice
banging around my head.

47
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,975
God remains silent to me.

48
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:53,212
It's a good thing I'm around.

49
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:57,683
'Cause we have to find
the whore of Babylon.

50
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:06,891
I was right about the glue--

51
00:05:06,925 --> 00:05:10,895
a polyvinyl acetate polymer
dissolved in toluene.

52
00:05:20,339 --> 00:05:22,273
And the backing is calfskin.

53
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:26,611
Together they're used in
ancient manuscript restoration.

54
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:28,746
Dude, your sister,

55
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,315
briefing room, now.

56
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:33,985
Okay, thanks.
I'll be there in a minute.

57
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,221
This is no amateur.

58
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:40,992
Thank you for joining us,
Dexter.

59
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:42,594
Okay, everyone,
let's get started.

60
00:05:42,628 --> 00:05:45,297
Our victim is Erin Baer, 29.

61
00:05:45,331 --> 00:05:46,765
She worked
at the glass house cafe

62
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:48,467
at the Miami Cultural Center.

63
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:50,102
Miami Cultural Center,

64
00:05:50,136 --> 00:05:52,938
full of ancient artifacts
in need of repair.

65
00:05:52,972 --> 00:05:54,806
I want unis plastering
Gellar's picture

66
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,241
all over the area.

67
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:57,342
Maybe someone got eyes
on him there.

68
00:05:57,376 --> 00:05:58,643
I'll take lead on that.

69
00:05:58,678 --> 00:06:01,112
Great. Where are we on
the revelation aspect of this?

70
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:03,482
Between the trumpet flowers
placed around her,

71
00:06:03,516 --> 00:06:06,084
the locusts,
and the iconography of an angel,

72
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:08,220
our Doomsday killer
was most likely referencing

73
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:10,622
Revelation chapters
8 through 10.

74
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:11,790
Any idea why he changed it up?

75
00:06:11,824 --> 00:06:14,292
Why our entrance
triggered her death?

76
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:17,361
Normally a serial killer
wants to do the kill themselves.

77
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:20,832
It's the whole point, right?

78
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:22,801
There's a passage which reads,

79
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:26,004
"You must go back
and report your message

80
00:06:26,038 --> 00:06:28,073
"to many peoples and nations

81
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:30,008
and languages
and kings."

82
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:32,144
So I'm guessing
we're those people.

83
00:06:32,178 --> 00:06:35,280
It seems his message is
more important than the thrill.

84
00:06:35,314 --> 00:06:37,115
Tell me you got something
from the M.E.'s office.

85
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:39,451
She found traces of spermicide
in Erin Baer.

86
00:06:39,485 --> 00:06:42,420
The M.E.'s take
is that the victim had sex

87
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,156
with someone who used
a spermicidal condom.

88
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,590
So what are we thinking,
that she just happened

89
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,925
to have sex
before she was kidnapped?

90
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,129
Or maybe she met Gellar,
had sex with him,

91
00:06:50,163 --> 00:06:52,498
and things got ugly for her.

92
00:06:52,532 --> 00:06:54,133
Or maybe
it was Gellar's accomplice.

93
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,668
Can't say for sure either way.

94
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:58,271
As far as we know,
she didn't know Gellar.

95
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:00,473
What did we get
on Gellar's last gig?

96
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:02,175
I've been trying to contact

97
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:05,311
his last teacher assistant
Carissa Porter.

98
00:07:05,346 --> 00:07:07,481
But so far
University of Tallahassee

99
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:08,616
has given us shit-all.

100
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,818
University's
not exactly thrilled

101
00:07:10,852 --> 00:07:12,520
to be linked
to Professor Nutbag.

102
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:14,055
Well, let's go up there
and make it clear to them

103
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,190
that we don't give a shit
whether they're thrilled or not.

104
00:07:15,224 --> 00:07:16,258
I'm on it.

105
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:19,560
Lab boys, what do we have?

106
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:21,529
Um, I've got locusts.

107
00:07:21,563 --> 00:07:24,298
But the necropsy on them
turned up jack and shit.

108
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:25,933
All they ate
was local greenery.

109
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:28,135
What about the dead fish
outside the angel crime scene?

110
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:29,202
All local.

111
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:30,737
You can catch them
off any pier,

112
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,739
buy them at any fish market.

113
00:07:32,773 --> 00:07:37,210
But we did find--

114
00:07:37,244 --> 00:07:39,912
ta-da--
another number.

115
00:07:39,946 --> 00:07:42,113
This one lodged
in Erin's esophagus.

116
00:07:42,148 --> 00:07:43,915
1,244.

117
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,317
Same paper and ink
as the other two.

118
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:50,253
1237, 1242, 1244.

119
00:07:50,288 --> 00:07:51,855
I did a check
into that number's usage

120
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,923
in the Book of Revelation.

121
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:54,658
Excuse me.

122
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:57,661
- Who's this?
- Uh.

123
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,030
Louis Greene,
the latest and greatest intern

124
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,298
from my forensics class.

125
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:02,866
He's up to speed
on the whole Doomsday case.

126
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,635
- What happened to the blonde?
- She's gone.

127
00:08:07,305 --> 00:08:10,374
Go on, Louis.

128
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:11,975
Yeah, well,

129
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,478
numerology
is all over revelation,

130
00:08:14,512 --> 00:08:16,279
but the only number
that's repeatedly referenced

131
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:18,782
that's in the thousands
is 1,260.

132
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:20,950
1260. You think
that's what he's counting up to?

133
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:24,287
If so, we've only got
15 days left.

134
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,622
And then what?

135
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:26,756
I don't know.

136
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,025
End of the world,
the rapture, Armageddon.

137
00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:31,694
More apocalyptic bullshit.

138
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,529
Dex, please tell me you have
something we can use.

139
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:35,431
I hate lying to my sister,
but--

140
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:38,166
Oh, sorry, nothing on the wings.

141
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:41,269
Okay, let's keep at it.

142
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:44,105
Let's find
this jizzbucket Gellar.

143
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,875
Class dismissed.

144
00:08:50,745 --> 00:08:53,847
Hey.

145
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,216
All that tippy-tappy stuff
you do on your laptop,

146
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:58,986
you're kind of a whiz
with computers, aren't you?

147
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,689
I tool around.
I've done some consulting.

148
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:03,224
I've made a couple RPGs.

149
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:05,694
Oh, role-playing games.
Nice.

150
00:09:05,728 --> 00:09:09,231
Any of them feature Amazon women
of immense strength,

151
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:10,833
by any chance?

152
00:09:13,204 --> 00:09:15,304
- No.
- Oh, that's okay.

153
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:18,207
Anyway, um, you mind?

154
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:20,209
Oh, yeah.

155
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:29,250
- Ice Truck Killer?
- Shh.

156
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:33,020
Let's keep it down, all right?

157
00:09:33,054 --> 00:09:34,521
It was stolen
from our evidence room,

158
00:09:34,556 --> 00:09:36,490
and if word gets out
we're losing evidence,

159
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:38,926
this department's street cred
goes straight down the shitter.

160
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,628
Well, why don't you just
get it back from the seller?

161
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:41,930
I tried.

162
00:09:41,964 --> 00:09:43,598
You have to give the site
what you're selling

163
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:44,833
before they agree
to auction it.

164
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:46,702
- Fuckers.
- I see.

165
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,538
So my question to you is...

166
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:53,176
Can I make this problem
go away?

167
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,045
I'll look into it.

168
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:07,624
Can I talk to you for a minute?

169
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:11,262
A minute.

170
00:10:11,296 --> 00:10:13,197
This is awkward.

171
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:15,800
What?

172
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:18,937
The engagement ring.

173
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:21,740
Fuck me in the ear,
I never gave it back to you.

174
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:25,244
Yeah, it's just that I got
30 days to return it.

175
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,647
- And since we're not gonna use--
- I'll get it back to you.

176
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:29,282
I'm so sorry.

177
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,516
It's okay.

178
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:36,422
I mean, you've had a lot
on your plate lately.

179
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:38,491
I better go.

180
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:41,860
Got some professors to harass.

181
00:10:51,837 --> 00:10:53,270
- Hello?
- Jamie, it's Debra.

182
00:10:53,305 --> 00:10:54,638
I need a little favor from you.

183
00:10:54,672 --> 00:10:57,174
About two weeks ago,
I brought a ring box

184
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,076
home with an engagement ring
in it.

185
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,511
You lost an engagement ring?

186
00:11:00,545 --> 00:11:03,948
I left it on Harrison's side
of the apartment.

187
00:11:03,982 --> 00:11:07,117
- Have you seen it?
- Uh, no.

188
00:11:07,152 --> 00:11:09,320
Do you think
you could look for it?

189
00:11:09,354 --> 00:11:11,489
I really appreciate all the help
I can get right now.

190
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:14,892
Thank you.
Bye.

191
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:19,830
Hey, Dex.

192
00:11:19,864 --> 00:11:21,665
- Sam.
- Hey.

193
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,133
Hey, how your little man doing?

194
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:24,301
Oh, he's doing great.

195
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,836
You should come by and see him.

196
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,537
Yeah, okay.
I'd love to.

197
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:31,441
Yeah.
Uh, how about tonight?

198
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:34,477
Uh, great, great.

199
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,045
You want to say 8:00?

200
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,048
- Perfect.
- Cool.

201
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,383
You didn't come
all the way out here

202
00:11:40,418 --> 00:11:41,785
just to ask about Harrison,
did you?

203
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:44,088
Yeah, I wish.

204
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:45,690
Some of Nick's old crew,

205
00:11:45,724 --> 00:11:47,992
they came by
and shot up the shop.

206
00:11:48,027 --> 00:11:49,727
Anybody hurt?

207
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:51,830
No, it was
an after-hours thing.

208
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:54,833
There was just bullet holes
in the garage door.

209
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:56,701
That's about it.
I called the cops,

210
00:11:56,735 --> 00:11:57,835
but nobody showed up,

211
00:11:57,869 --> 00:11:59,370
so, without the cop report,

212
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:00,638
the insurance don't do shit.

213
00:12:00,672 --> 00:12:02,239
You ever think of moving?

214
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:04,375
No.

215
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:06,910
God put me there
to do what I'm doing, man.

216
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:08,511
I don't scare off.

217
00:12:08,546 --> 00:12:09,846
You're a brave man, Sam.

218
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,748
O.G. For G-O-D,
know what I'm saying?

219
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,182
Yep.

220
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:14,250
Nope.

221
00:12:14,284 --> 00:12:15,251
See you tonight.

222
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,019
All right.

223
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:27,497
Excuse me, do you work here?

224
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:28,932
Read my tag.
I'm a docent.

225
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:31,135
How may I help you?

226
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:33,370
I accidentally poked a hole

227
00:12:33,405 --> 00:12:35,540
in a painting
that belongs to my boss.

228
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,208
I put my elbow right through it.

229
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:39,177
I know.
I'm such an idiot.

230
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:42,247
- Is there someone I can talk to--
- Follow me.

231
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:44,082
Okay.

232
00:12:45,551 --> 00:12:47,018
- Here at the museum...
- Right in here.

233
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:48,653
- Thank you.
- A lot of the action

234
00:12:48,688 --> 00:12:50,722
is behind the scenes.

235
00:12:50,757 --> 00:12:52,257
For nearly 35 years...

236
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,725
I'm sorry.
This isn't exactly--

237
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,794
Have you seen this before?

238
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:57,028
...restored works of art...

239
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:58,129
No.

240
00:12:58,164 --> 00:12:59,464
Well, sit down and watch it.

241
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:00,599
It's very informative.

242
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:01,800
That's why we made it.

243
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:04,436
...staining, discolorations.

244
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:07,805
They can make the art
look almost exactly

245
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,873
the way the artist intended it,

246
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:12,142
all while using
the same materials

247
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:14,812
that the artist used
during his or her own lifetime.

248
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:16,547
You wouldn't believe
how people end up treating

249
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:19,751
what can end up being
priceless works of art,

250
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:22,754
especially in our paper
conservation laboratory

251
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,456
where we're equipped with...

252
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,895
It's him.

253
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:32,232
The face I'm looking for.
He works here.

254
00:13:32,266 --> 00:13:34,401
That's how he knew
how to create those wings.

255
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:40,441
Morgan.

256
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:42,609
This is Detective Anderson.

257
00:13:42,644 --> 00:13:44,311
Dispatch gave me your number.

258
00:13:44,345 --> 00:13:46,180
We need a blood guy
on the double.

259
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:47,481
We're out at Miami shores.

260
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:50,417
1588, Northeast end
of 2nd Street.

261
00:13:50,452 --> 00:13:52,152
Got it.

262
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:56,423
Using radiograms
and infrared imaging...

263
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:58,058
Do you happen
to know the name of--

264
00:14:00,295 --> 00:14:03,430
Worst docent ever.

265
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,884
What do we got?

266
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,386
Male and female.

267
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,720
40s.

268
00:14:29,755 --> 00:14:31,689
Pictures on the walls
and rings on their fingers

269
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,991
make them man and wife.

270
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:36,160
Three gunshots.

271
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:38,363
One to the chest,
two to the stomach.

272
00:14:38,397 --> 00:14:40,965
The first cut on the face
not from a gunshot.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,969
- Maybe the fall.
- No, he fell back.

274
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:47,240
It looks more
like a glancing blow.

275
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:56,349
Cell phone.

276
00:14:56,383 --> 00:15:00,386
Maybe she threw it at him.

277
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,988
That's not the wife.

278
00:15:06,727 --> 00:15:08,727
Single gunshot to the chest,

279
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:11,263
through and through,
shot at close range.

280
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:12,664
No gun in sight.

281
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:14,132
Give me a hand.

282
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:23,109
We have our shooter.

283
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:26,779
The husband leaves,
forgets his phone,

284
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:29,282
the wife finds the pictures...

285
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:30,583
Wife throws phone
at two-timing bastard.

286
00:15:30,618 --> 00:15:32,418
And then shoots him,
boom, boom, boom,

287
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:33,787
three times.

288
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:35,622
She realizes what she did.
She's distraught.

289
00:15:35,656 --> 00:15:37,724
She turns the gun to her chest

290
00:15:37,758 --> 00:15:39,092
and blam.

291
00:15:39,126 --> 00:15:41,094
Murder-suicide.

292
00:15:41,128 --> 00:15:43,062
Took you all of 15 seconds
to solve that.

293
00:15:43,096 --> 00:15:44,463
It was a pretty easy one.

294
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:47,432
Hey, how the hell does a pro
like you stand working

295
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:50,235
with the rest of these
Miami Homicide chuckleheads?

296
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:51,669
Well, they're actually
pretty good,

297
00:15:51,704 --> 00:15:54,405
especially my sister Deb.

298
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,875
You probably know her
as Lieutenant Morgan.

299
00:15:56,909 --> 00:16:00,846
- Excuse me, detective?
- Hey, you can't be in here.

300
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,515
Oh, no, no, no.
It's okay.

301
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,383
I own the place.
They just--

302
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:07,420
Oh, my God.

303
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:08,622
Can I help you?

304
00:16:08,656 --> 00:16:11,091
I don't mean to sound crass,
but...

305
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,393
How long will they stay here?

306
00:16:12,427 --> 00:16:13,494
Till we finish.

307
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:15,329
Then the M.E.
will remove the bodies.

308
00:16:15,363 --> 00:16:18,898
And then how long will it take
for you to clean it up?

309
00:16:18,932 --> 00:16:20,933
Do I look like your maid?

310
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:47,459
Try not to look, huh?

311
00:16:47,493 --> 00:16:48,593
What?

312
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:49,594
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:51,897
It's okay.

314
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:54,800
God gave man the desire
to look at women.

315
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:58,136
It's the devil who made them
dress like that.

316
00:16:58,171 --> 00:16:59,904
That's not it.

317
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:01,539
What?

318
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:03,040
It's sad.

319
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:05,877
All of these people are doomed,
and they don't even know it.

320
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:10,481
It is sad.

321
00:17:10,516 --> 00:17:12,550
You're very sensitive, Travis.

322
00:17:12,585 --> 00:17:16,120
That's why you've been chosen.

323
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,958
Is that you?

324
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:33,335
It's not bad, huh?

325
00:17:33,369 --> 00:17:35,404
They're calling you
the Doomsday killer.

326
00:17:35,438 --> 00:17:38,674
It's kind of catchy.

327
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,843
I probably should stay
out of sight.

328
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:47,049
You may have to find
our whore without me.

329
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,951
By myself?
I can't.

330
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,552
Yes, you can.

331
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:52,354
I believe in you.

332
00:17:52,389 --> 00:17:54,423
God believes in you.

333
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:05,300
Aah!

334
00:18:19,148 --> 00:18:20,248
I have a face.

335
00:18:20,283 --> 00:18:22,417
Now I just need a name.

336
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,930
Travis Marshall.

337
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:36,967
Ancient manuscript restoration
and conservation.

338
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:48,979
No arrests, no warrants.

339
00:18:51,082 --> 00:18:55,052
No moving violations,
not even a parking ticket.

340
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:56,620
Appears you live
a quiet little life

341
00:18:56,655 --> 00:19:00,824
on 1742 Victory Street.

342
00:19:02,861 --> 00:19:06,163
Ready to see Brother Sam?

343
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,568
- Hey.
- Hey, Sam.

344
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:11,436
Come on in.

345
00:19:11,471 --> 00:19:16,141
- Let me take those for you.
- Nice.

346
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:17,275
Nice place you got here, man.

347
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:20,011
Oh, thanks.

348
00:19:20,045 --> 00:19:21,679
Hey, little man.

349
00:19:21,713 --> 00:19:22,913
How you doing?

350
00:19:22,948 --> 00:19:26,083
He's sleepy.
It's about his bedtime.

351
00:19:26,118 --> 00:19:29,787
Right on time then, 'cause...

352
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:30,921
It's his bedtime too.

353
00:19:30,955 --> 00:19:33,824
Maybe you could put him
to sleep for me?

354
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:35,125
Yeah?

355
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,828
Can you say thank you,
Harrison?

356
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,264
Thank you, Harrison,
for helping me

357
00:19:40,298 --> 00:19:41,599
put my little man to sleep.

358
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:42,833
Either way,
it's very nice of you.

359
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:44,101
Not a problem.

360
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:45,904
How's he doing
after the surgery?

361
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:47,372
He's doing great.

362
00:19:47,406 --> 00:19:48,773
That's good.

363
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:50,442
I'm gonna put him to bed.

364
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:51,544
I'll just be a few minutes.

365
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:52,878
All right.

366
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:54,046
Good night, little man.

367
00:19:54,081 --> 00:19:56,148
- Make yourself at home.
- Thank you.

368
00:19:56,183 --> 00:20:00,986
And now I guess
Sam and I are gonna hang out.

369
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,322
That's a cute boy
you got there, man.

370
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:08,159
Yeah, he's a keeper.

371
00:20:08,193 --> 00:20:10,461
It must be kind of hard
for you, man.

372
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:13,230
Just get up every day,

373
00:20:13,264 --> 00:20:16,834
leave, and go do what you do.

374
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:20,004
Do what I do?

375
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:23,308
Homicide every day.

376
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:25,043
How you end up in that, man?

377
00:20:25,078 --> 00:20:26,378
My dad was a cop.

378
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:28,147
I just sort of fell into it.

379
00:20:28,181 --> 00:20:31,183
Doesn't sound like the kind of
thing somebody just fall into.

380
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:37,056
What really happened?

381
00:20:37,091 --> 00:20:40,393
I guess in a weird way
I was sort of drawn to it,

382
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:42,028
the blood work.

383
00:20:42,062 --> 00:20:43,662
Why?

384
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:51,370
When I was three, I watched
my own mother get killed.

385
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:56,107
Something like that
stays with you.

386
00:20:56,142 --> 00:20:58,076
That's rough, man.
I'm sorry.

387
00:20:58,111 --> 00:21:03,049
Seeing that so young,
the darkness got in deep.

388
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,353
Never left me.
Never will.

389
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:09,790
You remember anything
before she died?

390
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:13,428
I don't know.

391
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:17,332
I remember at night
she would wrap me in a quilt

392
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:20,836
and sing songs to me.

393
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:26,443
Sometimes she'd trace her finger
along my ear.

394
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:27,711
Tickling me.

395
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,713
Must have made you feel good.

396
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,081
It did.

397
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:32,917
She was sharing that light
with you.

398
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,952
It's with you now.

399
00:21:34,986 --> 00:21:36,920
It's inside you.

400
00:21:36,955 --> 00:21:39,122
Think you got the wrong guy.

401
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,295
Well, the good book tells us

402
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,364
that there's no darkness

403
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:50,101
that the light can't overcome.

404
00:21:50,135 --> 00:21:52,569
So all the darkness
that you think you got

405
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,471
- inside you--
- Yeah?

406
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:57,207
All it takes
is just a little bit of light

407
00:21:57,242 --> 00:21:59,177
to keep it at bay.

408
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,981
Believe me.
I know.

409
00:22:03,015 --> 00:22:04,983
It's like with your son, man.

410
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:06,918
And see?

411
00:22:06,953 --> 00:22:08,253
I just mention him,

412
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,287
and you just light right up.

413
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:11,156
I guess I do.

414
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,325
And you're sharing
that light with him

415
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,060
every day all the time.

416
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:18,496
You really think so?

417
00:22:18,531 --> 00:22:21,600
I see it.

418
00:22:21,634 --> 00:22:23,568
You just got to let it out.

419
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:33,712
This is really nice, man.

420
00:22:36,015 --> 00:22:39,050
We got to do this again
sometime.

421
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:31,736
Shh.

422
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:40,011
Hey.
Hey! Hey!

423
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:41,513
Put her down!

424
00:23:41,548 --> 00:23:43,415
Get the fuck out of here!

425
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,450
Help me!
Help!

426
00:23:48,388 --> 00:23:49,888
Travis.

427
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:51,256
Where you been?

428
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,358
I'm sorry.

429
00:23:53,393 --> 00:23:55,394
I couldn't do it.

430
00:23:55,428 --> 00:23:57,996
- I tried.
- It's okay.

431
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:01,533
Many heroes of the faith
have endured their failures.

432
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:04,203
God's grace prevailed then too.

433
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:06,505
I thought I could do it.

434
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,376
Hey, it's my fault really.

435
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,344
I shouldn't have let you
go do this alone.

436
00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:14,847
Tomorrow night,
I'll be there with you.

437
00:24:14,881 --> 00:24:17,549
What about the police?

438
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:22,555
Do you think God's gonna allow
anything to slow us down now?

439
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:26,058
You go home, get some rest.

440
00:24:26,092 --> 00:24:29,095
Tomorrow night,
we'll start again.

441
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:43,209
Tomorrow night.

442
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,384
Brother Sam says we all have
a light inside us.

443
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,754
If I find Travis Marshall
to be guilty...

444
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:00,560
then I will snuff out his light.

445
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:20,579
He's neat.

446
00:25:20,613 --> 00:25:23,115
Everything in its right place.

447
00:25:30,657 --> 00:25:32,190
Masters degree in Art History

448
00:25:32,225 --> 00:25:34,159
from the University
of Tallahassee,

449
00:25:34,193 --> 00:25:37,662
the same place Gellar taught at
before he disappeared.

450
00:25:55,612 --> 00:25:59,448
I understand the urge
to end someone's life,

451
00:25:59,483 --> 00:26:03,252
but what is this fascination
with ending the world?

452
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:26,876
Looks like the same numbers

453
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:29,245
we found
in the Doomsday victims.

454
00:26:53,305 --> 00:26:55,206
Defacing the Bible.

455
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:57,241
I'm probably breaking a rule.

456
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,427
Hello, Doomsday killer.

457
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:52,362
I swear to God,
you're the only cop I know

458
00:27:52,397 --> 00:27:53,397
that drives the speed limit.

459
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:54,598
That car's not a toy.

460
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:56,400
In the right conditions,
it'll top 110 easy.

461
00:27:56,434 --> 00:27:57,667
And these weren't
the right conditions?

462
00:27:57,702 --> 00:28:02,306
No.

463
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,607
Is that our professor?

464
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:06,010
Professor Porter?

465
00:28:06,044 --> 00:28:08,679
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Detective Quinn.

466
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:11,416
This is Sergeant Batista.
Miami Metro Homicide.

467
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,451
Dr. Knudson, the department
head, said we'd find you here.

468
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:15,387
Right.

469
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:16,822
He told me you were coming.

470
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:19,591
So you knew Professor Gellar?

471
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,161
I did,
but I want to state upfront

472
00:28:22,195 --> 00:28:24,096
that Professor Gellar
didn't have anything to do

473
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:26,499
with those crazy Revelation
killings.

474
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:27,933
And you know this how?

475
00:28:27,968 --> 00:28:30,303
I was his teacher's assistant
for a year.

476
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:32,204
He even helped me get my job.

477
00:28:32,239 --> 00:28:33,372
Have you seen him recently?

478
00:28:33,406 --> 00:28:35,040
No, not since he left.

479
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:36,208
When was that?

480
00:28:36,242 --> 00:28:37,976
Three years ago about.

481
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,312
What about his blog,
"The Beginning of the End"?

482
00:28:40,346 --> 00:28:42,647
I mean, you have to admit,
there's some pretty crazy stuff

483
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:44,349
on there, and a lot of it
is in line with the killings.

484
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:48,219
He likes to stir up trouble,

485
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:49,787
make people think.

486
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:52,824
That's what made
everyone love him.

487
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:55,226
Oh, so you loved him?

488
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,727
Was he eccentric?

489
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:58,329
Yeah.

490
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:00,130
But he was also smart,

491
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:01,632
charismatic,

492
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:03,268
brilliant even.

493
00:29:03,302 --> 00:29:05,002
He saw things
between lines of text

494
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:06,871
that nobody else could.

495
00:29:06,905 --> 00:29:09,474
Being with him
was an incredible adventure.

496
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:13,078
So you did love him?

497
00:29:13,112 --> 00:29:14,212
We were close.

498
00:29:14,246 --> 00:29:15,480
Close, huh?

499
00:29:15,514 --> 00:29:17,248
Smart woman like you
with your looks,

500
00:29:17,283 --> 00:29:18,416
I bet he was hitting
on you all the time.

501
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,751
I mean, fuck,
if we worked together,

502
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:23,087
I'd have a hard time not wanting
to get close to you.

503
00:29:23,121 --> 00:29:26,023
It was more
than just a flirtation.

504
00:29:26,057 --> 00:29:28,325
We lived together.

505
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:29,759
For a while.

506
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:30,927
You're not together anymore.

507
00:29:30,962 --> 00:29:33,130
My year as his T.A. ended,

508
00:29:33,164 --> 00:29:35,165
he found another cute brunette,

509
00:29:35,199 --> 00:29:36,333
did the same thing with her.

510
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:39,169
Gellar had a thing
for brunette students?

511
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:43,241
I found out I was one
in a long line of girls,

512
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:46,344
but, you know what,
it was no big deal.

513
00:29:46,379 --> 00:29:47,746
I'm glad I got the chance
to know him.

514
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,781
He was good to me.

515
00:29:48,815 --> 00:29:52,085
Erin, our angel,
was a brunette.

516
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:55,956
Well, if by some miracle,

517
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,424
he contacts you--

518
00:29:57,458 --> 00:29:59,025
You'll be the first one I call,

519
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:03,629
if only to prove
you have the wrong guy.

520
00:30:03,664 --> 00:30:05,464
Hey, Professor Porter,

521
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,933
we're gonna be stuck here
for the night.

522
00:30:07,968 --> 00:30:09,768
You wouldn't happen to know

523
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:11,270
of any good spots
where we could get a drink

524
00:30:11,304 --> 00:30:12,537
this evening, would you?

525
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:13,805
Like some place kind of quiet?

526
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:15,874
Maybe I do.

527
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,714
Jesus Christ.

528
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:34,027
Do you always bring your work
home with you?

529
00:30:34,061 --> 00:30:36,630
I can't work for fuck
in my new office.

530
00:30:36,665 --> 00:30:40,234
It's like Laguerta's perfume
seeped into the walls.

531
00:30:40,268 --> 00:30:41,936
If she ever had a soul,
it's still in there.

532
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,605
Life was so much simpler

533
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:46,373
when all I had to do
was solve murders.

534
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:47,474
Red to black.

535
00:30:47,509 --> 00:30:49,676
- What it's all about.
- Who did it?

536
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,146
Wife.
Murder-suicide.

537
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,547
That brother of yours solved it

538
00:30:54,581 --> 00:30:56,449
like he was getting a message
from the dead.

539
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:58,985
Yeah, he's something special.

540
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,586
Ooh, nice place.

541
00:31:00,621 --> 00:31:03,356
Right by the beach too.

542
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,359
Nothing like a murder-suicide
to fuck up a great house.

543
00:31:06,393 --> 00:31:07,526
I've seen worse.

544
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:09,795
Male, 70s,

545
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:10,830
self-inflicted shotgun

546
00:31:10,864 --> 00:31:12,031
in the brainpan,

547
00:31:12,065 --> 00:31:14,133
which is bad enough,

548
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:15,668
but he had cats.

549
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:17,136
And they got hungry.

550
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:20,173
- Enough said.
- Ah, Chicago.

551
00:31:20,207 --> 00:31:22,408
Miss it?

552
00:31:22,442 --> 00:31:24,109
Miss the food.

553
00:31:24,144 --> 00:31:26,311
I mean, you can't get
a decent hot dog anywhere.

554
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:30,115
But homicide is homicide.

555
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:33,651
Yeah. I see the way you look
at people around here.

556
00:31:33,686 --> 00:31:35,553
You got
the world's youngest Lt,

557
00:31:35,588 --> 00:31:37,422
Batista and his hot rod,

558
00:31:37,456 --> 00:31:38,823
Masuka with--

559
00:31:38,858 --> 00:31:41,159
I made the mistake
of going in his lab unannounced.

560
00:31:41,193 --> 00:31:44,628
- He was--
- Enough said.

561
00:31:44,663 --> 00:31:45,796
He's got some fucked-up shit
going on,

562
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,897
but he gets it done.

563
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:50,500
The same could be said
for you, huh?

564
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:54,504
Good night, Anderson.

565
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:58,175
I'm grading this paper,

566
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,510
when all of a sudden I realize

567
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:02,413
I've read this before.

568
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:03,481
No way.

569
00:32:03,515 --> 00:32:04,949
This dumbass student

570
00:32:04,983 --> 00:32:05,983
changed some words around,

571
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:10,054
but he plagiarized
C.S. Lewis.

572
00:32:10,088 --> 00:32:11,255
C.S. Lewis.

573
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,424
I should arrest this guy
right now.

574
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:14,526
I've got my cuffs on me.

575
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,860
We can go.
I mean--

576
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,428
That sounds like fun.

577
00:32:17,463 --> 00:32:19,897
Yeah?
You want another round?

578
00:32:19,932 --> 00:32:22,333
You're not married, are you?

579
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,168
Definitely not.

580
00:32:24,202 --> 00:32:25,836
Then I want another drink.

581
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,871
Another round, please.

582
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,940
Thank you.
Oh, who looks shows up

583
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,208
when I'm buying drinks, huh?

584
00:32:31,242 --> 00:32:33,476
Hey, listen, we got a long ride

585
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:35,045
down to Miami tomorrow.

586
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:39,082
- You want to call it?
- One second.

587
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:45,123
You can call it if you want,

588
00:32:45,157 --> 00:32:47,592
but I'm about to cross
a fucking college professor

589
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:48,694
off my bucket list.

590
00:32:48,728 --> 00:32:50,696
Oh, be careful, partner.

591
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:52,398
She's part
of our investigation.

592
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:54,000
No, she's not.
She's just like a nice person

593
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:56,870
we talked to, you know.

594
00:32:56,905 --> 00:32:59,406
There's like 20 other women
here you could fuck.

595
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,808
I've already spent
like 80 bucks on her, though,

596
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:03,743
you know, so it's, like,
I don't want to have

597
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:06,046
to start all over again.

598
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,380
Get out of here.
Come on.

599
00:33:07,415 --> 00:33:09,983
We'll see each other
in the morning, all right?

600
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:12,151
- You're unbelievable.
- Yeah, go on, baby.

601
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:19,125
And there they are.

602
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,594
Thank you.

603
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:25,266
Here's to you.

604
00:33:57,499 --> 00:33:58,867
Hi, buddy.

605
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:01,469
Are you going to sleep?

606
00:34:01,504 --> 00:34:03,471
Are you going to bed?

607
00:34:03,506 --> 00:34:06,208
Are you tired?

608
00:34:06,242 --> 00:34:08,043
Found your ring.

609
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:09,645
Oh, jeez, you're a lifesaver.

610
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,215
Deb, really?

611
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:16,986
Ah, shit.

612
00:34:19,523 --> 00:34:21,090
He came in here
to give you a good night kiss,

613
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,759
not look at pictures
of dead bodies.

614
00:34:22,793 --> 00:34:25,194
Yeah, well, maybe if you
gave me a little warning.

615
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:26,862
Isn't there anywhere else
you can do this, Deb?

616
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:28,998
Right now?
No. Nowhere.

617
00:34:29,032 --> 00:34:31,066
Really? The lieutenant
doesn't get an office?

618
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:33,169
I don't like my office.

619
00:34:33,203 --> 00:34:34,970
- I like to work here.
- Oh.

620
00:34:35,004 --> 00:34:37,372
Harrison's got an entire
goddamn apartment over there.

621
00:34:37,406 --> 00:34:38,373
I've got jack shit.

622
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:40,042
He just wanted
to say good night.

623
00:34:40,076 --> 00:34:41,276
I know that.

624
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,378
Next time, why don't you
call me over there?

625
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,114
I will.
From now on.

626
00:34:45,148 --> 00:34:47,983
And maybe you could keep

627
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:49,652
the photos on Dexter's desk,

628
00:34:49,686 --> 00:34:50,887
so Harrison won't see them.

629
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:52,822
Again,
if you were doing your job,

630
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,390
this wouldn't have happened
in the first place.

631
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,060
My job?

632
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,361
- Yes.
- Really?

633
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,665
You mean my job isn't to be
your fucking maid?

634
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:01,833
- Oh.
- Uh-oh.

635
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,001
- I found it.
- Thank you.

636
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:04,436
- In Harrison's toy box.
- Thanks.

637
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,570
You're really lucky
he didn't eat it.

638
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,572
Oh, please.

639
00:35:06,606 --> 00:35:08,074
- Thank God you're home.
- Hello.

640
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:09,909
She needs to do a better job
of watching Harrison.

641
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,410
She is bringing home
all of these horrible pictures.

642
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:13,213
Would it be weird
if I just left?

643
00:35:14,983 --> 00:35:17,250
Hey, Jamie,

644
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:18,885
if Harrison's down
for the night,

645
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,520
maybe you should
just go on home.

646
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:22,356
See you tomorrow.

647
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,625
Okay.

648
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:28,929
Are you taking her side
on this?

649
00:35:28,964 --> 00:35:31,966
No, I'll talk to her too
tomorrow,

650
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,335
but, Deb...

651
00:35:34,369 --> 00:35:37,705
You got to admit
this isn't good for Harrison.

652
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:41,275
Yeah.
I'm a mess.

653
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,177
Maybe I do need
to go to therapy.

654
00:35:43,211 --> 00:35:45,580
No more than me.

655
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:48,015
Am I that fucked up?

656
00:35:57,793 --> 00:36:00,428
Bet you they don't even know
each other's names.

657
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:05,633
No wonder he wants us
to end it all.

658
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:10,270
These two.

659
00:36:10,305 --> 00:36:11,738
Follow them.

660
00:36:11,773 --> 00:36:14,808
Are you sure?
He looks pretty big.

661
00:36:19,314 --> 00:36:22,216
He's not as big as God.

662
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:27,722
Go on.

663
00:36:27,756 --> 00:36:30,158
Get the girl
before somebody comes.

664
00:36:30,192 --> 00:36:32,660
Put her in the trunk.

665
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:40,835
Help me.

666
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:45,674
I'm sorry.

667
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:55,649
See how easy it is?

668
00:36:59,922 --> 00:37:01,022
Come on.

669
00:37:05,728 --> 00:37:08,397
Hey.

670
00:37:08,431 --> 00:37:10,132
Come on in.

671
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:11,700
Where's Quinn?

672
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:13,235
Bathroom.

673
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:14,536
I'll get him.

674
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:27,082
Joey, your friend's here.

675
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:19,538
<i>The Alpha and Omega</i>
<i>of the Enesserette.</i>

676
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,868
Professor Porter,
could you come out here?

677
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:55,839
Uh, excuse me,
what are you doing?

678
00:38:55,874 --> 00:38:58,876
These drawings,
they were Gellar's?

679
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,144
You can't just start picking
through--

680
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:01,645
Did Gellar do this?

681
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,847
Whoa.
What's going on?

682
00:39:03,882 --> 00:39:04,882
Oh, my God.

683
00:39:04,916 --> 00:39:06,484
- Did he?
- Well, yeah.

684
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:09,720
Let me see.

685
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:15,058
Holy shit.

686
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:28,737
Can I help you?

687
00:39:28,772 --> 00:39:30,806
Michelle Ross.

688
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,507
The therapist
you've been dodging for weeks.

689
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,642
Fuck.

690
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:34,843
I'm sorry.

691
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:36,778
Happens more than you think.

692
00:39:36,812 --> 00:39:39,014
I figured since you weren't
coming to my office--

693
00:39:39,048 --> 00:39:42,117
That you would come to mine.

694
00:39:42,152 --> 00:39:43,819
Believe me, I understand.

695
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:48,058
So we should probably get down
to business, right?

696
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,327
Right here, right now?

697
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:52,529
Is that okay?

698
00:39:52,563 --> 00:39:56,934
Let's do this.

699
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,838
Okay, just to clarify,

700
00:40:01,872 --> 00:40:03,506
this is in reference
to the shooting

701
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,042
at Don Aldo's?

702
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:07,944
Have you been experiencing
any lack of sleep

703
00:40:07,978 --> 00:40:09,011
from the shooting in question?

704
00:40:09,046 --> 00:40:11,480
From the shooting, no.

705
00:40:11,515 --> 00:40:13,649
Have you found yourself
dwelling on that day?

706
00:40:13,684 --> 00:40:17,286
No.
Who has time?

707
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,487
Have you found it hard
to concentrate

708
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:20,223
on day-to-day tasks
because of the incident?

709
00:40:20,257 --> 00:40:22,758
No.

710
00:40:22,793 --> 00:40:24,761
Find yourself drinking more
than you did

711
00:40:24,795 --> 00:40:25,828
before the shooting?

712
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:30,834
Fuck, I don't drink enough.

713
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:32,402
That was a joke.

714
00:40:32,436 --> 00:40:34,338
Hm.

715
00:40:34,372 --> 00:40:36,573
Have you been experiencing
any guilt since the shooting?

716
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,275
No.

717
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:41,144
If he walked through that door,
I'd shoot him right now.

718
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:46,549
Great.

719
00:40:46,584 --> 00:40:48,585
So it sounds
like everything's fine.

720
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:49,786
Yeah.

721
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,021
Everything's great

722
00:40:51,055 --> 00:40:52,456
with the shooting.

723
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,457
It's just everything
that's happened since then

724
00:40:53,491 --> 00:40:57,394
that's fucking me up.

725
00:40:57,428 --> 00:41:01,264
Like what?

726
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:04,968
Like being lieutenant.

727
00:41:05,002 --> 00:41:07,971
And all the day-to-day bullshit
that comes with it.

728
00:41:08,005 --> 00:41:10,741
Got the Doomsday killer
doing his shit in my city,

729
00:41:10,775 --> 00:41:13,677
and I try to do any work
in here,

730
00:41:13,712 --> 00:41:15,813
and I can't,
and--

731
00:41:15,847 --> 00:41:17,982
did I mention I just broke up
with my boyfriend

732
00:41:18,016 --> 00:41:19,316
and I don't have a place
to live anymore,

733
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,885
so, at the end of the day,
I can't even go home?

734
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:25,189
I'm living with my brother
and his son, and...

735
00:41:25,224 --> 00:41:26,591
Don't get me wrong,
I love them,

736
00:41:26,625 --> 00:41:28,527
it's just...

737
00:41:28,561 --> 00:41:32,230
There's a reason I'm an aunt
and not a parent and...

738
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,734
I just feel like I don't
have a space

739
00:41:35,769 --> 00:41:39,037
to call my own right now.

740
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:45,075
So maybe you should get
some place that's your own.

741
00:41:54,617 --> 00:41:57,319
Detective Anderson

742
00:41:57,353 --> 00:41:58,454
and girlfriend.

743
00:41:58,488 --> 00:42:00,289
Her?
No way.

744
00:42:00,323 --> 00:42:02,924
I'm married.
She's my boss.

745
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,193
Lieutenant Debra Morgan,
Miami Metro Homicide.

746
00:42:05,228 --> 00:42:06,929
I'm so sorry.
I thought that you two--

747
00:42:06,963 --> 00:42:08,197
- Don't worry about it.
- My bad.

748
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:10,132
Can we get
this crime scene tape down?

749
00:42:10,166 --> 00:42:12,000
Wow.
It takes a lieutenant

750
00:42:12,034 --> 00:42:13,702
to tell me it's okay
to rent this place, huh?

751
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:16,038
- Can we go inside?
- By all means.

752
00:42:20,809 --> 00:42:25,112
Thank you.

753
00:42:25,146 --> 00:42:28,815
I wanted to come by and see if
I could possibly rent the place.

754
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,784
Oh?

755
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:32,786
The floors are a mess.

756
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,121
Yeah, they are, aren't they?

757
00:42:35,155 --> 00:42:37,457
Yes, they are.

758
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:39,960
Might have to replace 'em.

759
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:42,363
I mean, the toxic damage.

760
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:43,831
Toxic?

761
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:44,899
Blood-borne antigens

762
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:47,902
can live for two weeks easy.

763
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,808
Of course,
hep C is always a risk.

764
00:42:52,842 --> 00:42:54,743
I didn't know that.

765
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:56,578
Oh, God, just what I needed.

766
00:42:56,613 --> 00:43:00,349
Look, it's no secret

767
00:43:00,383 --> 00:43:03,385
you're gonna have a hell
of a time renting this place.

768
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,522
Legally, you're required
to disclose the murder/suicide.

769
00:43:06,556 --> 00:43:08,323
But I already know about it.

770
00:43:08,357 --> 00:43:09,758
And?

771
00:43:09,792 --> 00:43:13,394
What if I was to give you

772
00:43:13,428 --> 00:43:18,899
2/3 of the current rent
right now today?

773
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:23,571
Make that 3/4, two-year lease,
and you clean up the place.

774
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:25,641
Looks like you got yourself
a new tenant.

775
00:43:59,811 --> 00:44:04,181
Ah, what's the--
what's the progress on the--

776
00:44:04,215 --> 00:44:06,650
Yeah, all right,
I did everything

777
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:08,151
I know how, but I wasn't able

778
00:44:08,186 --> 00:44:09,586
to get the hand back.

779
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:11,622
The buyer bought it using
an eSniper program

780
00:44:11,656 --> 00:44:12,956
that firewalls the buyer,

781
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,625
so whoever's got it's
got it for good.

782
00:44:14,659 --> 00:44:17,861
- Oh, fuck.
- However...

783
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:20,064
I do like the sound
of your however.

784
00:44:20,098 --> 00:44:22,299
I erased any trace
of the sale from the Internet.

785
00:44:22,334 --> 00:44:25,269
So I'm sorry,
that's the best I can do.

786
00:44:25,304 --> 00:44:28,339
So if one were
to look online--

787
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,307
It's like it never happened.

788
00:44:30,342 --> 00:44:32,410
And I never checked it
out of evidence.

789
00:44:32,445 --> 00:44:35,279
There's no trail
coming back to here.

790
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:39,317
At the worst, the evidence room
fucked up, not us.

791
00:44:39,351 --> 00:44:41,752
Our department's safe.

792
00:44:41,786 --> 00:44:43,754
And while I was
on your computer,

793
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:46,189
I improved your credit rating,
installed a modded-up intel chip

794
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:48,325
to overclock your CPU,
and, most importantly,

795
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,562
I added a porn scrubber
to that thing.

796
00:44:54,198 --> 00:44:56,032
My man.

797
00:44:56,067 --> 00:44:58,502
Give it up, Lou.

798
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:01,505
Thank you.

799
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,794
Drive out
of the parking structure,

800
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:25,230
turn right on Flagler,
and then drive on

801
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:27,298
past the Miami River.

802
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:30,535
Nod if you understand.

803
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:37,176
You can take the car.

804
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,712
It's yours, my wallet,
whatever you want.

805
00:45:39,746 --> 00:45:42,716
I want none of those things,
Travis.

806
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:47,621
What do you want?

807
00:45:47,656 --> 00:45:49,791
I want your life.

808
00:45:49,825 --> 00:45:52,527
Just like the ones you took.

809
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:54,229
Doomsday killer.

810
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:55,997
God. God!

811
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,131
Yeah, let's start with him.

812
00:45:57,165 --> 00:45:58,466
I suppose it was God

813
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,135
who told you to kill
all those innocent people?

814
00:46:01,169 --> 00:46:03,103
God doesn't talk to me.

815
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:06,840
Then how do you know?

816
00:46:06,874 --> 00:46:09,375
He talks to Professor Gellar.

817
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,810
And how do you know
he talks to God?

818
00:46:10,844 --> 00:46:12,445
'Cause I've seen it.

819
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:16,448
God speaks to the professor.

820
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:20,953
He speaks
through the professor.

821
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,955
Keep going.

822
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:24,056
Before I met him,

823
00:46:24,091 --> 00:46:25,358
I was lost.

824
00:46:25,392 --> 00:46:27,527
But then the professor,

825
00:46:27,561 --> 00:46:29,162
he showed me the truth.

826
00:46:29,197 --> 00:46:31,832
He showed me the way.

827
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:34,669
He's a prophet
filled with truth and light.

828
00:46:34,703 --> 00:46:39,373
Bullshit!

829
00:46:39,407 --> 00:46:42,309
You killed those people
because you like it.

830
00:46:42,343 --> 00:46:44,978
Answer me.

831
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:49,048
I couldn't do it.

832
00:46:49,083 --> 00:46:51,184
I'm a failure.

833
00:46:51,218 --> 00:46:52,752
I'm failing God.

834
00:46:52,786 --> 00:46:55,922
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?

835
00:46:55,956 --> 00:46:59,425
Yes, yes, I wanted
to kill those people,

836
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,096
but I couldn't.

837
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,700
You're saying
Gellar does the killing.

838
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:09,069
He's so much stronger than me.

839
00:47:11,306 --> 00:47:13,608
The thing is, there's no fear.

840
00:47:13,642 --> 00:47:17,512
There's no regret.
But with me it's--

841
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:20,548
it's pathetic.

842
00:47:24,519 --> 00:47:27,654
Gellar is pulling you
toward the darkness, Travis,

843
00:47:27,689 --> 00:47:31,224
not the light.

844
00:47:31,259 --> 00:47:32,959
No, you don't know.

845
00:47:32,994 --> 00:47:36,963
Trust me, I know more
about darkness than most,

846
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:41,467
and Gellar is pure darkness.

847
00:47:41,502 --> 00:47:43,703
You need to find someone else
to follow.

848
00:47:43,737 --> 00:47:46,372
Pull over.

849
00:47:49,577 --> 00:47:52,212
Get out of the car.

850
00:47:52,246 --> 00:47:53,347
What?

851
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:54,615
Get out and start walking away.

852
00:47:54,649 --> 00:47:57,652
You'll find your car
back at the museum.

853
00:48:11,235 --> 00:48:14,171
One way or another,
Travis will lead me

854
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:16,573
to the one who really deserves
my table.

855
00:48:23,313 --> 00:48:25,448
Where are you?

856
00:48:25,482 --> 00:48:30,052
I'm on my way home.

857
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:31,087
What's going on?

858
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:34,891
I don't feel good.

859
00:48:34,925 --> 00:48:38,362
I've got--
I just feel sick.

860
00:48:38,396 --> 00:48:39,796
I should get some sleep.

861
00:48:39,831 --> 00:48:42,599
Travis, what are you
not telling me?

862
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:43,800
Nothing.
Nothing.

863
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:45,869
I just--
I feel sick.

864
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:47,804
I'll see you tomorrow?

865
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:52,042
Hey, you remember the story
about Jonah and the great fish?

866
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:56,446
Jonah tried to run from God.

867
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:59,549
He didn't get too far.

868
00:48:59,583 --> 00:49:04,187
Hope you're not trying to run
from God too.

869
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:06,222
Think about it.

870
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:19,802
I don't believe in angels,

871
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:21,671
but I do believe
there's a constant struggle

872
00:49:21,705 --> 00:49:24,140
between light and dark
in the world.

873
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:36,587
Who knows?
Maybe Brother Sam is right.

874
00:49:36,621 --> 00:49:39,423
Maybe sometimes
the light can win out.

875
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:51,201
But in my experience,

876
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:54,004
darkness usually prevails.
