00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,967
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:49,001 --> 00:01:51,700
You don't know him anymore,
Dexter-- you can be yourself.

4
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:55,767
With me.
Your real, genuine self.

5
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:59,534
- You can--
- Sorry.

6
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,834
Jonah, why are you still here?

7
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:05,467
I can't leave my mom
and sister alone with him.

8
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,734
Everything's ready to mark the whore.

9
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,700
No, please.
Where are you taking me?

10
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:13,934
You're free.

11
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,333
I know it was Nick who shot you.

12
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:19,700
Tell him that I forgive him.

13
00:02:19,734 --> 00:02:22,201
He's dead, which makes you a murderer.

14
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:25,567
They got no proof.
Nobody can do <i>anything!</i>

15
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,367
Aah!

16
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,901
Hey, little brother.

17
00:02:35,934 --> 00:02:38,567
Miss me?

18
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,767
I've been lost before.

19
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:53,101
After Rita died, after Lumen left.

20
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:57,367
But now I've been found.

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,867
Brian Moser,
my dead brother--

22
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:03,333
It's been a long time
since I've seen him.

23
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,101
Too long.

24
00:03:06,134 --> 00:03:08,567
Here. Catch.

25
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,767
You used to love to play.
Why the long face?

26
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:17,500
Brother Sam had hoped I'd be able

27
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:21,134
to forgive Nick for shooting him.

28
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,101
Because you don't turn
the other cheek, you slice it.

29
00:03:24,134 --> 00:03:26,634
Brother Sam doesn't know you
like brother Brian does.

30
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:28,934
Admit it...

31
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:31,834
You're a little glad to see me.

32
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:33,667
I feel...

33
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,500
- Relieved?
- Relieved.

34
00:03:36,534 --> 00:03:38,134
Unburdened.

35
00:03:38,168 --> 00:03:40,534
Like maybe I can stop pretending.

36
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:44,834
Pretending there's any light in me.

37
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,534
Feel that sun.

38
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:51,034
Feels good, doesn't it?

39
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:55,333
You know, we don't have to go back.

40
00:03:55,367 --> 00:03:57,567
We could keep going.

41
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,367
It's Debra.

42
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,534
Ehh...
The one that got away.

43
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:08,700
Hey, Deb, what's up?

44
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:11,134
I'll get there as soon as I can.

45
00:04:14,934 --> 00:04:16,901
We'll talk about this later.

46
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:30,067
Closing the door.
Must be serious.

47
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,034
Very serious.

48
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,500
It's Trinity.

49
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:39,333
He's back.
He killed again.

50
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,467
- What?
- Two people.

51
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,067
Family members--
his wife, Sally Mitchell,

52
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,734
and his daughter, Rebecca.

53
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,967
WitPro placed the Mitchells
in the middle

54
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,268
of bumfuck Nebraska,

55
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,767
and somehow Trinity managed
to track them down.

56
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:58,534
Well, not Trinity.
You killed Trinity.

57
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,867
What about his son, Jonah?

58
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:03,467
Trinity came after him too,
but Jonah survived the attack.

59
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,634
How lucky.

60
00:05:04,667 --> 00:05:06,567
Did he say what happened?

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,901
According to his statement,

62
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,600
Jonah came home from work

63
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:11,801
and saw Trinity
push Sally down the stairs

64
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,333
and begin to beat her.

65
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:17,001
Jonah fought him off, Trinity ran.

66
00:05:17,034 --> 00:05:20,901
And Jonah went upstairs
and found Rebecca...

67
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:24,467
Dead in a tub.

68
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,567
Or Jonah killed them

69
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,801
and is masquerading
as the Trinity killer.

70
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:35,767
And this all happened in...
<i>Nebraska?</i>

71
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,801
Some town called Kearney.

72
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:38,834
Road trip.

73
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:44,967
Brother Sam's death is
hard enough on you, I'm sure.

74
00:05:45,001 --> 00:05:46,934
And to top it off with this...

75
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:48,734
Let's go kill Jonah.

76
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:52,567
I--I'm gonna need some time.

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,467
Whatever you need.

78
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,101
Take the day.

79
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:07,201
"Carnival."

80
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,667
What?
Nothing.

81
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,934
I just love having you here.

82
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:18,134
Usually when you come to stay with me,

83
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:22,567
there's some...problem
that you need help with.

84
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:31,400
I can't, for the life of me,

85
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,500
figure out how...

86
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,268
how to turn off
the predictive text on my phone.

87
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,400
Do you have any idea how to do that?

88
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:42,700
I texted my boss that I had

89
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:44,600
two tickets to <i>Jizz</i> fest.

90
00:06:44,634 --> 00:06:46,367
Well, maybe
you'll get a promotion.

91
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,168
Oh, well, I wouldn't
hold my breath on that one.

92
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,834
Your boss doesn't mind
you not coming in?

93
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:54,700
My boss thinks I'm out tracking down

94
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:59,967
an ancient manuscript
from a private collector.

95
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:03,201
You sure you can't get
the whole day off?

96
00:07:03,234 --> 00:07:06,967
Oh, parent/teacher conferences
are a bitch to reschedule.

97
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,700
I'll only be a few hours.

98
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:28,168
- I'm done.
- Done?

99
00:07:28,201 --> 00:07:29,967
With you.
With everything.

100
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:34,101
God is the one with choice, Travis.

101
00:07:34,134 --> 00:07:36,400
He chose you and me.

102
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:39,067
We, however, have no say.

103
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:41,168
What about free will?

104
00:07:41,201 --> 00:07:44,567
Oh, please.
Let me inside.

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,400
No.

106
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,867
You see? Free will.

107
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:50,667
God's will doesn't stop

108
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,867
just because you want to
play house with your sister.

109
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:55,934
Until this little detour
of yours is over,

110
00:07:55,967 --> 00:08:00,767
I will carry on his work...
for the both of us.

111
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:09,734
Rebecca Mitchell.

112
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,634
Severed femoral artery.
She bled out in minutes.

113
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:15,534
- Razor blade?
- Check.

114
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:18,034
- Mirror?
- Check.

115
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,901
Sally Mitchell.

116
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,634
She was pushed down the stairs,

117
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,600
but that's not what killed her.

118
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:27,067
She suffered blunt-force traumas
to the head, neck, and chest.

119
00:08:27,101 --> 00:08:29,801
She was bludgeoned.
Was it with a hammer?

120
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,433
Hockey stick.

121
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,067
A girl dead in the bathtub,

122
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:34,967
a mom pushed and bludgeoned--

123
00:08:35,001 --> 00:08:37,300
Kind of an efficient little
combo pack there.

124
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:38,767
Jonah's been a very good student.

125
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:42,634
But Jonah loved his mom and sister.

126
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:47,268
When has love ever kept people
from killing one another?

127
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,333
You and I both know
how easy it would be

128
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:50,667
to choke Becca out.

129
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,101
Jonah climbs in the tub behind her,

130
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:55,967
cuts off her airway, opens her artery.

131
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,767
Now, mommy--
It's kind of genius of Jonah

132
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:00,967
to bludgeon her on the staircase why?

133
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,467
Because the castoff pattern
is consistent

134
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,333
with Trinity's height.

135
00:09:04,367 --> 00:09:05,767
Jonah stands on the highest step,

136
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:08,700
and suddenly he's as tall
as good old dad.

137
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:12,934
Kid has some real talent.

138
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,600
It's in his blood.

139
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,967
Son of a serial killer
becomes a killer.

140
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,001
What are the odds?

141
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,134
Let's go play in your room.

142
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:28,034
Cute kid.
My nephew.

143
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:34,001
Kearney, Nebraska, is a mere 30 hours

144
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:35,201
from Miami, FLA.

145
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,101
31 if you must stop along the way.

146
00:09:37,134 --> 00:09:41,667
We could rent a car,
take I-95 north.

147
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,834
Don't tell me
you're having second thoughts.

148
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:46,034
What about DDK? Miami Metro
could get to them first.

149
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,834
- They're not even close!
- I don't know.

150
00:09:48,867 --> 00:09:50,500
When you 86ed Trinity,

151
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:53,400
you gave Jonah the perfect alibi
to get away with murder.

152
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:56,500
I know how much you hate it when
people get away with murder.

153
00:09:56,534 --> 00:09:58,700
Everyone, that is, except for you.

154
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:01,168
So I'm a little, what,
responsible for this happening?

155
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,534
Your life is nothing
<i>but</i> responsibility.

156
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,433
Look around, Dexter.

157
00:10:05,467 --> 00:10:07,134
Look at your life!

158
00:10:07,168 --> 00:10:10,667
Sippy cups, poopy diapers,
baby monitors!

159
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,134
You've been domesticated!

160
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:15,867
You need to take this trip.

161
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,634
Come on, Dexter.

162
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,567
When was the last time you had fun?

163
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,034
Thanks for coming over
on such short notice.

164
00:10:28,067 --> 00:10:29,734
No problem.

165
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:32,268
I shouldn't be gone
more than four or five days.

166
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,234
Come in.

167
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:40,600
Timing's perfect.

168
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,567
The first chapter of my
dissertation is due next week,

169
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,734
and I never get anything done at home,

170
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,268
especially when Angel's there.

171
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,433
It's Brother Sam, isn't it?
You miss him.

172
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:52,234
I just need to get away from it all.

173
00:10:52,268 --> 00:10:55,234
I'll only bug you
if it's super important.

174
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,034
Where you going?
I'm not sure.

175
00:10:57,067 --> 00:11:00,400
Maybe down to the keys,
wherever the road takes me.

176
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:02,767
Well, have fun.
Let's get you to bed.

177
00:11:02,801 --> 00:11:04,967
Mwah!
I love you.

178
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,467
Wow, love. Really?

179
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,433
It's weird seeing you with a kid.

180
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,268
Let's go to Nebraska.

181
00:11:35,268 --> 00:11:36,734
Starting your mornings off right,

182
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:39,600
George's heart to Heart Rock Hits 96.

183
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,567
Deb, hey, it's me.

184
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,433
You know, I'm gonna need
more than a day

185
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:50,433
to clear my head--
It's hard to concentrate.

186
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,234
There's a lot to digest, I guess.

187
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:56,801
I'll be back in four days, five tops.

188
00:11:56,834 --> 00:12:00,634
Hope that hearing thing goes well.

189
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:06,268
70% of the murders
in my district were by firearms.

190
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,967
What percentage of murders
is by spiked collar?

191
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:12,134
I created a separate category

192
00:12:12,168 --> 00:12:13,901
for the Doomsday killer murders.

193
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,801
So that those unsolved cases

194
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:18,834
don't count against your clearances?

195
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:21,134
What is your division's
clearance rate?

196
00:12:21,168 --> 00:12:23,734
42%.

197
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:26,300
Add back in the open DDK murders,

198
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:31,367
and your clearance rate drops to...

199
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,500
29%.
But I can explain.

200
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:37,001
Numbers can't hear you.
Moving on...

201
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:39,467
Hey.

202
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,867
Six of those murders happened
on your watch

203
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:43,134
before I took over.

204
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:45,034
The clearance rate is a running total.

205
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,734
It doesn't matter who was
in the lieutenant's position.

206
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:49,400
If it doesn't fucking matter,
then what was that in there?

207
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:50,667
Because it felt personal.

208
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,333
That was my first compstat hearing,

209
00:12:52,367 --> 00:12:57,534
as a captain.

210
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:01,034
So you were just as nervous as I was.

211
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:02,534
But it has to be a fuckload
easier to sit there

212
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,433
and listen to stats
than it is to present them.

213
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,567
It is.
But as your captain,

214
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,001
they're my stats too,
so they have to be accurate.

215
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:12,767
My numbers are lousy.
Makes me feel lousy.

216
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:16,534
That's why I like compstat--
It's just numbers.

217
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,367
Look, I don't know what happened
between you and Quinn,

218
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,168
but I lost a relationship
because of this job,

219
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,700
and I take great comfort

220
00:13:28,734 --> 00:13:30,934
in the pure objectivity of numbers.

221
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:35,500
At compstat, there's no age,
no gender, no feelings.

222
00:13:35,534 --> 00:13:37,834
Improve your numbers,
and everything will change,

223
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,201
I promise you.

224
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:42,734
And if you don't catch DDK,
you will crash and burn.

225
00:14:00,034 --> 00:14:02,400
Hey, bro, I got your message.

226
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,433
Um, I know this is
a tough time for you,

227
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:06,934
so take today off.

228
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:08,934
But please don't take four.

229
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:11,867
What's left of my ass just got
handed to me on a paper plate

230
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,600
at that compstat hearing.

231
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:17,001
DDK is either gonna
make my career or end it.

232
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:20,667
I need your help.

233
00:14:46,268 --> 00:14:51,534
She's cute.

234
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:52,967
No.
I keep telling you no.

235
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:55,433
Go talk to her, Dexter.

236
00:14:55,467 --> 00:15:00,067
I told you I don't like
fucking when your mom's home.

237
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:02,500
Register's over here.
I gotta go.

238
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,767
Smile, Dexter.

239
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:12,834
You know, if it's any consolation,

240
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:14,634
I think boundaries are good
in a relationship.

241
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:15,700
Hmm. Is that right?

242
00:15:15,734 --> 00:15:17,967
Let's do her.

243
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:19,934
I, for example,
would never fuck anyone

244
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,500
if my mom were home.

245
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:23,300
Or I should say if my
adoptive mother were home.

246
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:24,500
I could never have fucked anyone

247
00:15:24,534 --> 00:15:25,867
if my actual mother were home,

248
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,867
'cause she was murdered
in front of me when I was three.

249
00:15:27,901 --> 00:15:32,400
Is that right?

250
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:34,600
I don't see any mothers
around here, do you?

251
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,367
Uh-uh.

252
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:50,700
Uh, that was--
Thanks.

253
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,201
Wouldn't it have been more fun

254
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:55,734
to kill her than fuck her?

255
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:57,333
I got what I wanted.

256
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:08,300
Right through the "O".

257
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,867
Aw...

258
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,201
I don't even like guns.

259
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:17,734
Faster!
Let's go faster!

260
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:27,600
Try different targets.
Something more familiar.

261
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,168
<i>Gospel Hour</i> is happy to
welcome Pastor Bill O'Connor

262
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:42,500
of Kearney's First
United Methodist Church.

263
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,001
"He will command his angels,
concerning you,

264
00:16:45,034 --> 00:16:46,834
"and they will lift you up
in their hands

265
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,500
so that you will not strike
your foot against a stone."

266
00:17:00,168 --> 00:17:03,433
A twister would do this town a favor.

267
00:17:05,634 --> 00:17:07,901
Stay here.
I want to talk to Jonah

268
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,101
face-to-face.

269
00:17:46,134 --> 00:17:49,667
Hello, Dexter Morgan.

270
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,134
After Rita Morgan died,

271
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:54,067
Kyle Butler's face
was all over the news

272
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:55,934
as her grieving husband.

273
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,600
That's when we realized Kyle Butler

274
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:00,767
was really Dexter Morgan.

275
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:03,300
No one connected the dots for the FBI.

276
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:07,433
We talked about it but...
decided as a family

277
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,634
that you tried to help us.

278
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:13,834
So we tried to help you.

279
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:17,534
But why did you lie
about who you were?

280
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:20,767
I was trying to protect my family.

281
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:24,168
I suspected your dad
was the Trinity killer.

282
00:18:24,201 --> 00:18:28,333
I thought I could bring him to justice

283
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:32,801
before he killed again.

284
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:35,567
I wanted to be a hero.
It was stupid...

285
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,667
and selfish.

286
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,034
That's what got Rita killed.

287
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:43,801
My father ruined both our lives.

288
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:48,234
What happened here, Jonah?

289
00:18:48,268 --> 00:18:50,001
What I really think happened?

290
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:51,367
This I want to hear.

291
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,767
My mom probably
called him at some point

292
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,201
asking for money,

293
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:58,534
making it easy for him to find us.

294
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:00,067
Did you see your father?

295
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:02,700
Oh, yeah.

296
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:04,001
I mean, I heard him

297
00:19:04,034 --> 00:19:06,967
before I saw him...
fighting with my mom

298
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:08,500
at the top of the stairs.

299
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:12,400
And I came in, and he looked at me.

300
00:19:12,433 --> 00:19:15,268
Then he pushed her down the
stairs like he wanted me to see.

301
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,101
Then he started hitting her
with my hockey stick,

302
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:21,234
and I grabbed it and fought him off.

303
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:24,067
He ran.

304
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:28,333
I went to my mom and...

305
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,534
then I went upstairs,

306
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:32,934
and that's when I found Becca.

307
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:35,801
What a performance.

308
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:38,934
- Jonah, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

309
00:19:38,967 --> 00:19:41,500
For your loss.

310
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:47,234
Yeah, well, I'm sorry
for your loss too.

311
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,168
Now, is that why you came
all the way out here,

312
00:19:49,201 --> 00:19:50,867
to tell me that?

313
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,567
I just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

314
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,067
It'll be okay.

315
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,801
Go back to Miami.
It's over.

316
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:11,400
Oh, I'd say the fun is just beginning.

317
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:20,500
Lt, the unis took
a statement from a woman

318
00:20:20,534 --> 00:20:22,834
at St. Joseph's who says she was
chained up for a few days

319
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,634
by someone called
"The Professor."

320
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,467
Was her name Mary Ann or Ginger?

321
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,801
No, it's Holly.

322
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:35,500
One of them kept
calling the other "Professor."

323
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:38,967
But I didn't see either of them.
I was blindfolded.

324
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:40,168
There were two of them?

325
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:42,333
The younger guy
is the one who let me go.

326
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,667
I sort of could tell that
he was the weaker of the two.

327
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,201
The younger guy said
he kept calling me...

328
00:20:49,234 --> 00:20:51,734
Holly, you're safe.

329
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,700
What did he call you?

330
00:20:54,734 --> 00:20:56,067
The whore.

331
00:20:56,101 --> 00:20:59,600
They didn't touch me
except when they chained me.

332
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,001
And the Professor, I think,

333
00:21:02,034 --> 00:21:06,967
would jam his knee behind my neck,

334
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:11,534
and hold my head so that
I couldn't close my mouth.

335
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:13,867
And then he would pour
this stuff into it.

336
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:16,433
And the younger guy kept saying
that he was sorry--

337
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:18,467
so sorry for doing this to me.

338
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,134
What'd they make you drink?

339
00:21:20,168 --> 00:21:23,034
It was cold, and it made me puke.

340
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:26,700
And it tasted like metal.
I think it was blood.

341
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:33,034
There's probably no way
to get a sample of that blood,

342
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,300
but we should run it all past Dexter.

343
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:37,268
Jamie said she was watching
Harrison for a few days.

344
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,834
Yeah, Dex said he needed a break,

345
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:40,567
so he just took off.

346
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,067
I get that.

347
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,834
Did Jamie mention where he was going?

348
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,801
No, but it was part
of a larger conversation

349
00:21:45,834 --> 00:21:48,001
about a date she has...
with Louis.

350
00:21:48,034 --> 00:21:49,201
Masuka's intern?

351
00:21:49,234 --> 00:21:50,500
Yeah. She met him
at your party.

352
00:21:50,534 --> 00:21:51,867
Let me get this straight.

353
00:21:51,901 --> 00:21:54,367
The guy who is Masuka's tool
all day long

354
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,101
is gonna be sexing up your sister?

355
00:21:56,134 --> 00:21:57,867
When you get ahold of Dexter, find me.

356
00:21:57,901 --> 00:21:59,433
For the Knights of Columbus
Demolition Derby...

357
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:02,934
Make sure you stop by
and give doc a big hello.

358
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:07,567
Debra, Debra, Debra.

359
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,400
Is she really worth it, Dexter?

360
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:13,600
What is it with you and her?

361
00:22:13,634 --> 00:22:16,467
I feel like I ran over
a nail or something.

362
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,767
Let's pull over.

363
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:22,101
We need to find a base camp anyway.

364
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,834
This looks good.

365
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,901
And if I can just get
your signature right there.

366
00:22:56,934 --> 00:23:00,400
Keep that pen if you want.

367
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:02,234
That'll be $39.

368
00:23:02,268 --> 00:23:06,534
Please and thank you.

369
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:09,101
I saw from your plates
that you're from Florida.

370
00:23:09,134 --> 00:23:11,168
Must be happy to get out of there.

371
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:15,134
From what I see on the news,
that Miami is a real sewer.

372
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:17,268
And now, whatever the hell
is going on down there...

373
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,867
- Horses running in the streets.
- Mmm.

374
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,801
People say the world is ending.
Crazy assholes.

375
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,700
So what brings you to these parts?

376
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:30,367
I'm following the Oregon trail.

377
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,934
Well, so partial
to the great outdoors,

378
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:34,101
what is it you do back in Florida?

379
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:36,001
Landscaping.

380
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:37,767
Never made any sense to me.

381
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:41,734
Just hiring someone to do
what nature does naturally.

382
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:44,201
This place would turn anyone
into a homicidal maniac.

383
00:23:44,234 --> 00:23:45,867
Can you point me
to the nearest garage?

384
00:23:45,901 --> 00:23:48,467
I have a flat.
I can patch that for you.

385
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,834
You can do that?

386
00:23:49,867 --> 00:23:51,667
Yeah.
We're pretty handy here.

387
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,967
Unlike us city people.

388
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,901
Can you patch a tire?

389
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:59,067
No, I cannot.

390
00:23:59,101 --> 00:24:00,834
Well, I'm happy to help.
I'll give you a good deal too.

391
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:03,034
- How 'bout 20 bucks?
- Sign me up.

392
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,467
It's a deal.

393
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,667
Not a callous on that hand, is there?

394
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,433
I wear gloves when I work.

395
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,534
About how long do you think?

396
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,634
It shouldn't take me more
than a while.

397
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,734
Town's not too far
if you want to grab a bite.

398
00:24:20,767 --> 00:24:22,400
Just follow the road.
It'll take you directly there.

399
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,700
I'm starving.

400
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:27,700
You're welcome.

401
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,433
Shortcut?

402
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,067
Lead the way.

403
00:25:05,333 --> 00:25:09,201
It's a little pot farm.

404
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:12,834
Now I see why shady norm
wanted us to stay on the road.

405
00:25:12,867 --> 00:25:15,234
Shady Norm's been a very industrious

406
00:25:15,268 --> 00:25:17,700
little fella, hasn't he?

407
00:25:17,734 --> 00:25:19,268
Come on, let's get out of here.

408
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,567
Let's get lunch.

409
00:25:41,534 --> 00:25:43,567
When the Whore of Babylon is revealed,

410
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,600
she is "sitting on
a scarlet-colored beast"

411
00:25:45,634 --> 00:25:47,001
having seven heads."

412
00:25:47,034 --> 00:25:48,400
There were some pictures of this beast

413
00:25:48,433 --> 00:25:49,634
in Gellar's sketch book.

414
00:25:49,667 --> 00:25:51,500
I blew them up a little.
Looks like a dragon.

415
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:53,101
Yeah, on paper.

416
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,867
Who knows how they'll bring it
to life in the next tableau?

417
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,767
Listen to this.
"The whore,

418
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,834
"in addition to being arrayed
in purple and scarlet,

419
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:03,134
will be drunk with the blood
of the saints."

420
00:26:03,168 --> 00:26:04,767
That's why they had holly
drink the blood.

421
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,433
Drunk on the blood of the saints?

422
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,034
Were they making her
drink their blood?

423
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,767
If they consider themselves
saints, the creepy fucks.

424
00:26:11,801 --> 00:26:13,867
And why'd the younger guy
let her go? Who is he?

425
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:15,634
Probably a former student, right?

426
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:17,433
I mean, he kept referring
to Gellar as "Professor."

427
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:19,367
How do we get an ID on him?

428
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,734
Well, Gellar taught
at Tallahassee for 12 years.

429
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:24,500
400 students per year, 4,800 names.

430
00:26:24,534 --> 00:26:26,534
2,400 if you exclude females.

431
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,400
So if they're gonna continue,

432
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,467
the best way for us to stop
the next murder from happening

433
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,201
is to get a name
on Gellar's accomplice

434
00:26:32,234 --> 00:26:35,500
in a haystack of 2,400
potential suspects?

435
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,567
Fuck just isn't enough right now.

436
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,667
2,400 is not that big a number.

437
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,734
Unless you're talking virgins.

438
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,567
Maybe I could be of some help.

439
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,001
I'll work on it.

440
00:26:46,034 --> 00:26:47,734
I would kill myself, but it would add

441
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:49,534
to my murder total for the month.

442
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:50,867
At least we're closer to catching him

443
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,034
than we were this morning.

444
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:54,867
Yeah, I feel a lot better.

445
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:58,834
Where the fuck is Dexter?

446
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:04,067
I promise I won't tell anyone.

447
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:07,367
Well, how do I know I can trust you?

448
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,433
Oh, well, that kiss
is a contract, you know.

449
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:12,934
Come on.

450
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:15,067
Okay, this is rough.

451
00:27:15,101 --> 00:27:18,367
And it's not even
a beta version, but...

452
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,801
you totally got my brother.

453
00:27:21,834 --> 00:27:25,001
Even down to the way that hat
sits on his big head.

454
00:27:25,034 --> 00:27:26,433
Is he, like, the star of your game?

455
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:28,034
Well, the game is modeled
on the department,

456
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:31,767
so if he's the lead on a case,
then he's kind of the star.

457
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:32,834
- Yeah.
- You're really smart.

458
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:36,433
I know.

459
00:27:36,467 --> 00:27:39,567
Someone's here.

460
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,034
- Debra?
- Hi. Where's Dexter?

461
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,534
On a trip.

462
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:46,867
- Where did he go?
- I don't know.

463
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:48,268
The keys?

464
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,367
His boat is still docked
at the marina.

465
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,634
Well, maybe he took his car.

466
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:53,767
Have you tried calling him?

467
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:56,767
About a thousand times.

468
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,268
But not from here.

469
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,067
If you could go somewhere
else, where would it be?

470
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:04,934
I've never been to Portland.

471
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:06,901
That's a little predictable, isn't it?

472
00:28:06,934 --> 00:28:08,168
Isn't that where all
serial killers go?

473
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:12,934
Home, sweet home.
Don't answer that, Dexter.

474
00:28:12,967 --> 00:28:15,600
Jamie? What's wrong?

475
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:19,967
- Where in fucktopia are you?
- Deb. Hi.

476
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:23,234
Did you get my messages?
What's that sound?

477
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:25,400
I can barely hear you.
The reception's terrible.

478
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,400
We had a breakthrough on the DDK case.

479
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:30,634
- Deb, I gotta go.
- You know...

480
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,300
You could have asked me
before you just took off.

481
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:36,734
You offered me some time off.

482
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:38,901
I meant the afternoon,
not five fucking days

483
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:41,534
to go wherever it is that you are!

484
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,034
Where are you?

485
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:46,767
It's-- I don't know...

486
00:28:46,801 --> 00:28:49,333
personal.
I'm your sister.

487
00:28:49,367 --> 00:28:52,534
Then tell my lieutenant that
I'll be back as soon as I can.

488
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,467
I'm sorry, you're breaking up.

489
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,934
We don't have much time.
We gotta do Jonah's now.

490
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,801
Let's go.

491
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:02,134
Goody.

492
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:36,867
There it is, 1965 Walnut Street.

493
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:40,433
Home of the family formerly
known as the Mitchells.

494
00:29:45,234 --> 00:29:48,500
You want to kill him here
or just lie in wait?

495
00:29:48,534 --> 00:29:52,300
Neither.

496
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,201
Then what are we doing here?

497
00:29:54,234 --> 00:29:57,168
I don't know for sure
that he's guilty.

498
00:29:57,201 --> 00:29:58,433
Not this again.

499
00:29:58,467 --> 00:30:00,433
Harry's code.

500
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:04,433
Tell me why it matters
if a person is good or bad.

501
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:07,034
Does it make you feel better
to kill bad people?

502
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:08,234
It's part of the ritual.

503
00:30:08,268 --> 00:30:10,500
You don't need
a justification to kill.

504
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:12,134
The code is more than that.

505
00:30:12,168 --> 00:30:14,433
It's kept me from getting caught.

506
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:16,168
It's given me a life.

507
00:30:16,201 --> 00:30:18,934
A life that is a big fat lie.

508
00:30:18,967 --> 00:30:22,168
Just like Jonah's story.

509
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:25,500
What more proof do you need
that Jonah's guilty?

510
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,767
The FBI didn't photograph
the entire living room.

511
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:38,300
Maybe Jonah made a rookie mistake.

512
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:41,700
My knives!

513
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:45,067
I'm guessing it's the motel gimp.

514
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:47,801
Whoever it is also took
my forensic kit.

515
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:49,934
Now, that I don't miss so much.

516
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:08,001
It's the midwest.

517
00:31:08,034 --> 00:31:09,867
Nobody locks their doors.

518
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:33,168
There's no blood <i>anywhere.</i>

519
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:38,734
Bleach.

520
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:40,667
He cleaned up.

521
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:47,967
Rebecca died in the bathtub upstairs.

522
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:53,101
I'm bored.

523
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:55,333
Why aren't we setting up a kill room?

524
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:59,333
This is where Jonah
would have had to stand

525
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,901
to make it look like his father
beat his mother to death.

526
00:32:02,934 --> 00:32:06,367
Try it.
Take a pretend swing.

527
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:21,834
Not the best clean-up job
I've ever seen.

528
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,168
Now for the living room.

529
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,734
This is the kitchen.

530
00:32:27,767 --> 00:32:30,567
I'm making a test for bleach,
which I wouldn't have to do

531
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,700
if my forensic kit hadn't been stolen.

532
00:32:43,101 --> 00:32:46,234
Get the fuck out of my house.

533
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:50,400
Show me where it happened, Jonah.

534
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:53,700
Your father killed your mother
here, on this staircase?

535
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,333
Police can be here in three minutes.

536
00:32:55,367 --> 00:32:58,734
Here is where her body was,
and here...

537
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,433
is where you cleaned up
your mother's blood.

538
00:33:00,467 --> 00:33:02,467
You're a sick fuck, you know that?

539
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,534
Where'd you fight your father
off-- It was here, right,

540
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,834
when you took the weapon
from him and hit him,

541
00:33:06,867 --> 00:33:09,001
chasing him off?
Yeah.

542
00:33:09,034 --> 00:33:10,567
Swinging at him the whole time.

543
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,867
Yeah, I was. Yeah.

544
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,667
If that were true,
there'd be blood here

545
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,001
on the wall,
and then the ceiling here.

546
00:33:16,034 --> 00:33:17,101
But there's no spatter here.

547
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:19,201
That's because
I cleaned it up. Now go!

548
00:33:19,234 --> 00:33:22,600
- With bleach?
- Yes.

549
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,734
Not on this wall.

550
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:26,268
Because there was no blood
on this wall,

551
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,467
because your father was never here.

552
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,034
I know for a fact that Trinity

553
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:34,433
did not kill anyone in this house.

554
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,567
Was that because you killed him?

555
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:50,734
Yes.

556
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:54,001
Just like you killed
your mother and your sister.

557
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:00,101
Get him.

558
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:19,634
Satisfied?

559
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:21,767
Let's go set up the kill room.

560
00:34:21,801 --> 00:34:24,001
That's my baby brother.

561
00:34:24,034 --> 00:34:25,967
What about your knives, Dexter?

562
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:28,367
You're gonna need them.

563
00:34:46,234 --> 00:34:48,767
Psst.

564
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:53,300
He's in the shed.

565
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:04,201
Hey, there.

566
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:07,534
You're real interesting,
Florida, you know that?

567
00:35:07,567 --> 00:35:10,333
All these potions and solutions

568
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:12,001
in this kit I found in your car.

569
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:14,967
And these knives of yours.

570
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:17,901
They ain't exactly
landscaping tools now, are they?

571
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:21,667
I'd like them back.

572
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,867
I know you saw what I was
growing out there

573
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:25,134
in that cornfield.

574
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:26,367
You know what's going on.

575
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,333
- I don't care about that.
- Really?

576
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,967
Then what are you doing here?

577
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:33,234
You obviously have
some sort of desk job.

578
00:35:33,268 --> 00:35:34,600
Those hands of yours are so smooth.

579
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:38,567
You with the DEA, ATF, FBI?

580
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,201
Why don't you put
the knife down and we can talk.

581
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:41,700
What are they worth to you?

582
00:35:41,734 --> 00:35:46,367
I can see you have some money
by that fancy car of yours.

583
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,667
It's a rental.

584
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,101
This is not how I was hoping
our first kill would be.

585
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:52,168
I should think knives
like those of yours

586
00:35:52,201 --> 00:35:57,067
would be worth $10,000 to you.

587
00:35:57,101 --> 00:35:59,001
This guy is leaving you no choice.

588
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,034
He's gonna kill you
if you don't kill him first.

589
00:36:01,067 --> 00:36:03,534
So I pay you $10,000,
you forget you ever saw me?

590
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:05,001
You can have your knives back.

591
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:08,700
I'll go find an ATM,
but I'm taking these with me.

592
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:11,467
I found this in the car too.

593
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,801
$10,000.

594
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:16,234
Please and thank you.

595
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:18,433
Or you're a dead man.

596
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,467
At last... A kill!

597
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,967
No lengthy vetting process,
no stalking.

598
00:36:50,001 --> 00:36:51,834
One can argue
self-defense, maybe.

599
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:54,001
A little too much talking
for my taste.

600
00:36:54,034 --> 00:36:55,634
Did you see his eyes?

601
00:36:55,667 --> 00:36:58,600
Yes.

602
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,467
Why do you wake up your victims

603
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,734
when they're on the table?

604
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:04,734
I want them to know what they've done.

605
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,901
Bullshit!

606
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:10,268
You like to watch the light
go out of their eyes.

607
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,168
Doesn't make a bit of difference
if they're guilty or not.

608
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:20,300
How do you feel?

609
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,834
Like anything is possible.

610
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,834
This is the life
I've always wanted for you.

611
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:32,067
Where do we go from here?

612
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:33,500
Jonah.

613
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:36,300
And then what, Dexter?

614
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:40,901
And then...

615
00:37:40,934 --> 00:37:42,433
we keep going.

616
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:47,367
But first things first.

617
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,268
How do you dispose of a body

618
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,634
when you're miles from the ocean?

619
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:54,567
Norm's a thief,
a pot-grower, and an asshole--

620
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,700
Any one of which would
explain his death.

621
00:37:56,734 --> 00:37:59,534
You can just leave his body
out in the open.

622
00:38:03,201 --> 00:38:05,433
I have a better idea.

623
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:18,400
I hope you took a souvenir.

624
00:39:08,168 --> 00:39:14,201
It's nice to see you, Travis.
I thought you were done with me.

625
00:39:14,234 --> 00:39:15,534
These are your things.

626
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:20,934
I wanted them out of my apartment.

627
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,534
Would have been a little bit easier

628
00:39:22,567 --> 00:39:26,801
if you'd just dumped 'em
in the trash, wouldn't it?

629
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:30,234
I thought bringing them here
would give me closure.

630
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:35,534
Closure.

631
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:37,500
Sounds like you went
from reading the Bible

632
00:39:37,534 --> 00:39:38,934
to reading
the self-help books.

633
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:41,367
But if you really came here because

634
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,234
you secretly wanted me to beg,

635
00:39:43,268 --> 00:39:47,967
well, then, please, Travis,
come back to me.

636
00:39:48,001 --> 00:39:49,801
I didn't come here to have you beg.

637
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:52,600
How 'bout a story, then?

638
00:39:52,634 --> 00:39:54,300
I read one the other day in the paper

639
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:57,067
about a little girl
in California who was abducted.

640
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:59,333
They went into her room,
and they grabbed her

641
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:01,567
while she was asleep
next to her teddy bear.

642
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,101
They raped her
and then they killed her,

643
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,600
and then they dumped her
into the woods.

644
00:40:04,634 --> 00:40:06,400
- Don't tell me--
- There was another story

645
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:10,168
about someone who set off a bomb
in Pennsylvania.

646
00:40:10,201 --> 00:40:15,367
11 people were killed, 20 maimed.

647
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,834
That's why the world,
as it is, has to end.

648
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:21,168
Stop talking.

649
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:24,034
The sins of humankind continue

650
00:40:24,067 --> 00:40:25,967
unless we put a stop to it.

651
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,967
No, no, shut up.
Just shut up!

652
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:30,934
Are you gonna kill me?

653
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:33,700
Is that what you want to do, Travis?

654
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:42,967
What I want...

655
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:45,500
is to be free.

656
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,467
I'll talk to God.

657
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,300
I release you.

658
00:40:59,333 --> 00:41:01,967
I can go?

659
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,467
You know where the door is.

660
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,534
You have no messages.

661
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:24,901
You're looming.

662
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:33,001
I, uh, came to apologize.

663
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:36,333
I apologize for being
an asshole at your party.

664
00:41:36,367 --> 00:41:40,268
And for sleeping
with that Professor chick.

665
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,168
And I apologize for proposing to you.

666
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:48,667
I just thought it was something
people did after a while,

667
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,700
you know?

668
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,534
Like buying a coffee table.

669
00:41:54,567 --> 00:41:56,734
We never bought a coffee table.

670
00:41:56,767 --> 00:41:58,001
Well, we talked about it.

671
00:41:58,034 --> 00:42:00,901
And we couldn't talk
about getting married?

672
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,867
We did have something good, right?

673
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:07,001
I mean, I'm not crazy, am I?

674
00:42:07,034 --> 00:42:09,268
Yeah.

675
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:13,801
We had something good.

676
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,500
You know, there's times
when I come home,

677
00:42:18,534 --> 00:42:20,867
and I still expect to see you there.

678
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:24,700
And--and I open up the door,

679
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:26,901
and everything's so neat and clean.

680
00:42:27,934 --> 00:42:30,268
And it hits me all over again.

681
00:42:32,168 --> 00:42:33,567
You're gone.

682
00:42:38,934 --> 00:42:42,300
- I'm right here.
- Yeah.

683
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,400
In Laguerta's office.

684
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:46,600
Fuck, I know, right?

685
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,367
It still feels like her office.

686
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,467
I think that's why
I haven't unpacked anything.

687
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,101
At all.

688
00:42:52,134 --> 00:42:53,667
Yeah.

689
00:42:56,901 --> 00:43:00,834
I wanted to tell you first
about this before anyone.

690
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:03,101
I made that difficult.

691
00:43:03,134 --> 00:43:06,234
Yeah, but...

692
00:43:06,268 --> 00:43:08,400
you were hurt.

693
00:43:08,433 --> 00:43:11,467
Because of me.

694
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,101
And for that I am truly sorry.

695
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:17,967
I really miss you, Deb.

696
00:43:20,168 --> 00:43:23,700
You, like, kept me glued or something.

697
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,600
Sometimes I don't know what I'm doing.

698
00:43:25,634 --> 00:43:27,634
I feel like the last day
my life made any sense

699
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,767
was the last day I spent with you.

700
00:43:49,234 --> 00:43:51,034
We can't.

701
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,901
We're over, aren't we?

702
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:02,600
Like <i>over</i> over.

703
00:44:24,268 --> 00:44:28,234
This is what our life together
could have been like

704
00:44:28,268 --> 00:44:29,801
if you hadn't killed me.

705
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,300
- Here's the call.
- Jonah.

706
00:44:35,333 --> 00:44:37,567
Hello?

707
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,134
Dexter, can we talk about this?

708
00:44:40,168 --> 00:44:41,500
Sure, Jonah.

709
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:43,967
Maybe somewhere private.

710
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:45,467
I was thinking the shop's closed...

711
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,700
I'll meet you there.

712
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:49,600
Jonah doesn't want to chitchat.

713
00:44:49,634 --> 00:44:51,001
I know.

714
00:44:51,034 --> 00:44:53,034
He has every reason
to want to kill me.

715
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:54,667
I'm the one person
who knows what he did.

716
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,967
Don't you just love it
when things fall into place?

717
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:38,667
You shouldn't have come to Nebraska.

718
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,268
I had to.
I couldn't believe it.

719
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,967
Believe what,
that I turned into a killer

720
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,101
like my father?

721
00:45:43,134 --> 00:45:45,734
Yes.
I thought I set you free.

722
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,567
Set your whole family free.

723
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,934
I wanted to kill him myself.

724
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:53,834
But you'll settle for killing
your mom and your sister?

725
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:55,801
Yeah, and you.

726
00:46:00,268 --> 00:46:02,034
Do it, Dexter! Do it!

727
00:46:03,834 --> 00:46:07,934
Kill me!

728
00:46:07,967 --> 00:46:09,300
What did you say?

729
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,801
Please.

730
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:14,367
You want me to kill you?

731
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,734
What are you waiting for?

732
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:17,834
Kill me for what I did.

733
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:24,467
Tell me what happened.

734
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:25,734
Who cares what happened?

735
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:29,234
I didn't kill Rebecca.

736
00:46:29,268 --> 00:46:31,234
She killed herself.

737
00:46:31,268 --> 00:46:35,067
I found her like that
in the tub, my baby sister.

738
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:38,801
God, I should have gotten her
out of that house sooner.

739
00:46:38,834 --> 00:46:40,201
She couldn't take it anymore.

740
00:46:40,234 --> 00:46:43,067
- Take what?
- Dexter...

741
00:46:43,101 --> 00:46:45,400
My mom.

742
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:50,400
How she blamed us
for everything he did.

743
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:52,534
She just--
She was still in love with him.

744
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:54,034
She kept defending him.

745
00:46:54,067 --> 00:46:57,834
She just wished he would come
and whisk her away

746
00:46:57,867 --> 00:47:00,700
to Thailand or Mexico.

747
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:04,101
Then I found Becca.

748
00:47:04,134 --> 00:47:06,700
And I just exploded on mom.

749
00:47:06,734 --> 00:47:11,634
I kept hitting her
over and over, just like dad!

750
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:13,600
I'm my father's son!

751
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:16,034
Time to put him down, Dexter.

752
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:25,834
You brought me here
to provoke a fight,

753
00:47:25,867 --> 00:47:27,333
hoping I would kill you.

754
00:47:27,367 --> 00:47:30,967
Death by Dexter.
Fantastic idea!

755
00:47:31,001 --> 00:47:32,034
Kill him!

756
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:39,001
What if this were my son?

757
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:41,134
We have come so far.

758
00:47:41,168 --> 00:47:42,500
He's not a monster.

759
00:47:42,534 --> 00:47:44,667
Don't you want to see
the light in his eyes go out?

760
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,567
No.

761
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,268
- Think how good it will feel.
- He has a conscience...

762
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,801
and regret.

763
00:47:52,834 --> 00:47:57,433
This is the wishy-washy part
of you I can't stand.

764
00:47:57,467 --> 00:48:00,467
Uh, oh, Biney's mad.

765
00:48:03,801 --> 00:48:05,801
This is like Debra all over again.

766
00:48:05,834 --> 00:48:07,834
You're weak.

767
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,901
I'm stronger than you.

768
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,867
We had a plan, Dexter.

769
00:48:17,901 --> 00:48:19,134
Just you and me.

770
00:48:19,168 --> 00:48:21,534
I'm going home.

771
00:48:28,134 --> 00:48:30,001
Baby brother.

772
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:31,801
Wait!

773
00:48:31,834 --> 00:48:34,767
How am I supposed to live with this?

774
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,834
Forgive yourself.

775
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:51,500
Have you been a good girl,
Debra Morgan?

776
00:48:51,534 --> 00:48:53,634
Because it's about to be Christmas.

777
00:48:53,667 --> 00:48:55,400
Show her, Louis.

778
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,834
I created a program
that cross-referenced

779
00:48:57,867 --> 00:48:59,734
former students of Gellar
with people living

780
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:01,234
in a 20-mile radius of Miami.

781
00:49:01,268 --> 00:49:03,801
- I excluded a few variables...
- And presto!

782
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:05,634
- 200 names.
- It was that easy?

783
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:08,500
- But not all that legal.
- Eh, not a problemo.

784
00:49:08,534 --> 00:49:11,001
Louis Greene is not
an employee of Miami Metro,

785
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:13,867
just an unpaid intern.

786
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:15,867
Thank you...

787
00:49:15,901 --> 00:49:17,500
I think.

788
00:49:17,534 --> 00:49:20,333
Here to serve.

789
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:30,367
If you want a ride to work,
I'm leaving in seven minutes.

790
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,901
- Not six?
- Not eight.

791
00:49:34,367 --> 00:49:36,234
I'll be ready.

792
00:49:57,201 --> 00:50:01,634
Brother Sam believed
light can keep darkness at bay.

793
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:04,934
But I wonder if darkness
is defined by light.

794
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:08,700
If so, darkness can't exist
on its own.

795
00:50:10,634 --> 00:50:15,801
There must, by definition,
be light somewhere,

796
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:18,001
waiting to be found.

797
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,667
Welcome home, son.

798
