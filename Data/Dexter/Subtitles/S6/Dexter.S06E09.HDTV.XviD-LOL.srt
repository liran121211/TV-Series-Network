00:01:46,421 --> 00:01:47,840
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:47,968 --> 00:01:49,635
You're saying Gellar does the killing.

4
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,337
He's so much stronger than me.

5
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:52,971
I can protect you.

6
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:53,973
It's not me that I'm worried about.

7
00:01:54,007 --> 00:01:55,007
It's my sister.

8
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,343
Your sister talked to the police.

9
00:01:57,378 --> 00:01:59,178
She betrayed you.

10
00:01:59,212 --> 00:02:00,847
Just like the Whore of Babylon.

11
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:03,115
- No!
- Ice Truck Killer?

12
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,016
It was stolen from our evidence room.

13
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,085
I erased any trace of the sale
from the Internet.

14
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,620
However, I wasn't able
to get the hand back.

15
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:10,821
So when
Jessica Morris O.D.'d,

16
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:12,322
there was definitely someone

17
00:02:12,356 --> 00:02:13,623
in that hotel room with her.

18
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:14,890
No doubt.

19
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:16,692
Then why is Laguerta on my ass
to close this thing?

20
00:02:16,726 --> 00:02:19,294
My sister's a really nice girl.

21
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:22,930
You seem like a nice guy.

22
00:02:22,964 --> 00:02:25,532
I just wouldn't want
to see you get hurt.

23
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:31,703
Travis, is he here?

24
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,240
Gellar has seen me now.

25
00:02:36,274 --> 00:02:39,041
- This just got much harder.
- I'll help you.

26
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,910
I'll help you kill him.

27
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:56,591
I've had my Dark Passenger for so long

28
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,692
that I can't really recall life
without it.

29
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,564
Like someone who's grown up
with a club foot,

30
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:07,334
or a stutter, or a lazy eye.

31
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:08,969
It's simply been my own affliction

32
00:03:09,004 --> 00:03:12,372
that I accept as part of who I am.

33
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:17,343
But for Travis, his Dark Passenger

34
00:03:17,378 --> 00:03:20,113
is a more recent acquisition.

35
00:03:20,147 --> 00:03:21,747
And he's not adjusting so well.

36
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:33,925
So I'm going to help separate them.

37
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:50,738
You saved my life.

38
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,440
Gellar would have killed me.

39
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,175
You said you'd help me find him.

40
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:56,977
Where is he?

41
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:01,781
- Travis.
- I don't know.

42
00:04:01,815 --> 00:04:04,050
Where else does he stay?

43
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:07,354
Nowhere.
This place was his home.

44
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:11,358
The only time he left was
when we were doing the work.

45
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,827
You mean hunting your victims.

46
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:23,971
This one.

47
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:26,107
The Bowls of Wrath.

48
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,575
The next tableau.

49
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,177
- Where will Gellar stage it?
- I don't know.

50
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:30,845
Then who will Gellar's next victim be?

51
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,013
I don't know.

52
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:34,649
He murdered your sister,
Travis. Think.

53
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,618
Gellar was the one
who made all the decisions.

54
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,987
Come on, Travis.

55
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:41,823
You must know something.

56
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:47,562
"2LOT"?

57
00:04:47,596 --> 00:04:49,564
Is that from the Bible?

58
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:55,335
I've never seen that before.

59
00:04:56,904 --> 00:04:59,205
Look for anything

60
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:02,408
that'll help us find Gellar.

61
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,500
I feel dizzy.

62
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:34,306
We need to take care of that arm,

63
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,041
and find you a place to stay

64
00:05:36,075 --> 00:05:40,713
where Gellar can't find you.

65
00:05:55,862 --> 00:05:58,096
What's this about, Dexter?

66
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,898
It's what Brother Sam would want.

67
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:02,601
Are you sure
this is about Brother Sam?

68
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:05,204
I know what I'm doing.

69
00:06:21,488 --> 00:06:23,989
My cell phone's on the speed dial.

70
00:06:24,023 --> 00:06:25,890
Sit down.

71
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:28,894
Hold out your arm.

72
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,299
So what am I supposed to do here?

73
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,768
Nothing.

74
00:06:34,802 --> 00:06:37,137
There's nothing you can do right now.

75
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:40,441
Not to mention you're wanted
for multiple murders.

76
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:43,945
You can't help me if you're in jail.

77
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:46,147
I'll be back later with some food.

78
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:49,150
In the meantime,
do not leave this room.

79
00:06:50,986 --> 00:06:52,953
And try to think of anything
that might help me figure out

80
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:55,089
where Gellar is.

81
00:06:59,094 --> 00:07:02,097
2LOT.

82
00:07:05,534 --> 00:07:10,004
"2LOT: The second law
of thermodynamics--

83
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,641
"Tendency for order to become disorder

84
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,642
or chaos."

85
00:07:14,677 --> 00:07:17,078
What does it have to do
with the Bowls of Wrath?

86
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:24,085
A parking pass.

87
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:26,921
You visited the Miami South campus.

88
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:29,890
Were you stalking your next victim?

89
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:44,138
"Professor Casey's
controversial book <i>2LOT's Tales</i>

90
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,541
"claims to demolish
every argument offered

91
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:49,110
for a God-centered universe."

92
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:50,979
If Gellar wants to pour out his wrath,

93
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,647
who better to receive it than...

94
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:57,519
"tireless crusader
for the virtues of atheism."

95
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:02,859
Dexter's allowed
to have a private life,

96
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:06,862
but is it too much to ask
for a little give and take?

97
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:10,332
Would you say that your
brother has always been guarded?

98
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:12,868
Well, yeah, that's the problem.

99
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:15,604
But if he's always been this way,

100
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,475
why would you
suddenly expect him to change?

101
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:21,810
I don't know.

102
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:23,779
Would you expect a chair

103
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:25,180
to suddenly become a table?

104
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:26,815
No, but--

105
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,317
No, because a chair...

106
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:30,886
- Is a chair.
- Mm-hmm.

107
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:33,923
Dexter is who he is.

108
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,428
You're good.

109
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:41,698
How does it make you feel
when he shuts you out?

110
00:08:41,732 --> 00:08:45,702
Alone.

111
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:48,238
Where do you think this comes from?

112
00:08:48,272 --> 00:08:51,875
This feeling of being alone?

113
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,844
I don't know.

114
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:01,385
My mom died when I was a teenager.

115
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,255
That must have been hard.

116
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:08,226
Becoming a woman
with--with no mother figure.

117
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:15,400
It would have helped if my dad
had paid me any attention.

118
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:21,206
That's probably why I fell in
love with someone twice my age.

119
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,041
He was shot in front of me.

120
00:09:23,075 --> 00:09:24,442
Did I mention that?

121
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,111
No.

122
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:30,449
I was probably looking
for someone safer

123
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:33,886
after being engaged
to this really great guy

124
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:37,790
that also turned out
to be a serial killer.

125
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:42,228
Would you like it if we
started seeing each other

126
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:44,130
more than once a week?

127
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:54,741
- Deb.
- Hmm?

128
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:56,810
Listen, I'm sorry about last night.

129
00:09:56,845 --> 00:09:58,445
You don't have to apologize.

130
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,380
- I don't?
- Nope.

131
00:10:00,414 --> 00:10:02,716
I get it.
You're a chair.

132
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,052
I'm a what?

133
00:10:05,086 --> 00:10:06,253
I don't have time to explain it.

134
00:10:06,287 --> 00:10:08,255
I'm late for the briefing.

135
00:10:14,295 --> 00:10:16,596
You look confused.

136
00:10:17,631 --> 00:10:19,599
Your sister ever say anything

137
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,968
that makes
absolutely no sense whatsoever?

138
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:23,102
All the time.

139
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:24,170
She ever call you a chair?

140
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:27,674
I don't think so.

141
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,980
Hey, have either one of you
seen Quinn?

142
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:35,414
I hope he's okay.

143
00:10:35,449 --> 00:10:37,083
Why wouldn't he be?

144
00:10:37,117 --> 00:10:39,352
Uh, he got shit-faced
last night

145
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:40,453
and started proposing to strippers.

146
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:42,121
Okay, let's get started.

147
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,622
Where's Quinn?

148
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:44,957
He's on his way.

149
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:49,061
Lisa Marshall
is DDK's latest victim--

150
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:50,596
the Whore of Babylon.

151
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,831
Where are we on finding
her brother Travis?

152
00:10:52,865 --> 00:10:55,066
He's gone missing.
Hasn't reported to work in days.

153
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,068
We got unis at his apartment
and at Lisa's house.

154
00:10:58,103 --> 00:10:59,303
So far, nothing.

155
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:01,171
So he and Gellar
either got the fuck out of dodge

156
00:11:01,205 --> 00:11:03,806
or they're holed up somewhere
planning their next installment

157
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:04,941
of "What the Fuck."

158
00:11:04,975 --> 00:11:06,709
Travis is holed up waiting for me.

159
00:11:06,743 --> 00:11:09,145
They have three tableaus to complete.

160
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,781
Now, according to Gellar's notebooks,

161
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:13,549
the Bowls of Wrath are next.

162
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:16,119
Now religious experts
that I've consulted

163
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:19,322
say that it's punishment
poured on the people.

164
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:22,927
Each bowl is a plague--
disease, darkness,

165
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:24,862
the ocean turns to blood.

166
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:26,364
You know this shit?

167
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:28,700
I've been studying.

168
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:30,835
Gellar updated his blog.

169
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,904
It's the first post
since the killings began,

170
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:35,741
- which is huge, right?
- Let me see it.

171
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,976
"In six days, the end will be marked

172
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,345
"with a solar eclipse.

173
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:41,247
"All those following false prophets

174
00:11:41,281 --> 00:11:42,815
are doomed."

175
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,552
Could be Professor Casey.

176
00:11:45,586 --> 00:11:47,020
Or me.

177
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm the one Gellar saw in the church.

178
00:11:50,124 --> 00:11:53,760
Look at all the comments.

179
00:11:53,795 --> 00:11:55,428
People are taking this shit seriously.

180
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,530
Professor Gellar,

181
00:11:57,565 --> 00:11:59,966
I support your quest.

182
00:12:00,001 --> 00:12:02,168
I'm inspired by your courage

183
00:12:02,202 --> 00:12:04,037
and faithfully follow you to the end.

184
00:12:04,071 --> 00:12:05,771
Doomsday Adam.

185
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:07,506
Well, a blog update's

186
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,508
not gonna help us find their location.

187
00:12:09,543 --> 00:12:12,011
Well, I could take a stab
at tracking down

188
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,546
the blog's Internet protocol address.

189
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,015
I hope you're not as good
as you think.

190
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:17,350
Do it, Louis.
I don't want to know

191
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:19,752
how you do it, but do it.

192
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,353
We're running on fumes here.

193
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,122
I need people following all leads,

194
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,223
whatever it takes
to catch these assholes, okay?

195
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:26,525
Let's do it.

196
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:28,293
I hate to root against my own team,

197
00:12:28,327 --> 00:12:31,029
but I want a shot at Gellar first.

198
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:43,475
All right!
Jesus Christ.

199
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:46,611
You missed the morning briefing.

200
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:48,313
Hey, I overslept.
It happens.

201
00:12:48,347 --> 00:12:49,914
Yeah, well, it's happening a lot.

202
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:51,950
Get dressed.

203
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:55,954
Your gun, where is it?

204
00:12:57,723 --> 00:13:00,592
Oh, fuck me.

205
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,026
You got to be kidding me.

206
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:04,696
The whole city is looking
to us to fix this DDK shit,

207
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,364
and you lose your gun?

208
00:13:06,398 --> 00:13:08,732
I went to the strip club with Masuka,

209
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:10,901
he bailed on me...

210
00:13:10,936 --> 00:13:13,337
And then me and this stripper

211
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:16,306
went into her car, and she...

212
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,141
You banged a stripper in her car?

213
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,177
Maybe my gun fell out in her backseat.

214
00:13:20,211 --> 00:13:22,312
You better pray that it did
and that it's still there.

215
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:26,616
Please, tell me
you at least got her number.

216
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,285
Oh, fuck me.

217
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,621
I got enough to babysit
with my kid sister.

218
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:33,189
Your phone's got GPS.

219
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:35,224
Track it.

220
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:46,569
That address is halfway across town.

221
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:49,704
We just lost a whole morning
because of your dumb ass.

222
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:51,939
I'll make it up to you.

223
00:13:51,974 --> 00:13:53,508
Mr. Morris.

224
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,975
Yes.

225
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,344
I'm Jessica Morris' father.

226
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,579
Thank you for seeing me.

227
00:13:58,613 --> 00:14:01,448
I am sorry for your loss.

228
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:02,849
How can I help you?

229
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,218
I'd like you to reopen Jessica's case.

230
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:09,156
Mr. Morris, I know
this must be very difficult,

231
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,191
but the medical examiner ruled
that your daughter's death

232
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,793
was an accidental overdose,

233
00:14:12,827 --> 00:14:14,328
not a homicide.

234
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:15,663
Yes, I know.

235
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:18,066
But her sternum was cracked.

236
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:20,135
And paramedics said
they never performed CPR

237
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:22,905
because she was already dead
when they arrived.

238
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:24,206
How do you know that?

239
00:14:24,241 --> 00:14:25,374
Does it matter?

240
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,242
If someone was with her when she died,

241
00:14:27,277 --> 00:14:28,343
why aren't you looking into that?

242
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:30,345
I'm sorry, but the case is closed.

243
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,180
Well, then reopen it.

244
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:34,149
What if that person killed her
and then tried to cover it up?

245
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:36,084
I am sorry, but my hands are tied.

246
00:14:36,118 --> 00:14:38,252
Please, just listen.

247
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:42,489
I don't know if you have kids,

248
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:43,991
but I hope you never have to see 'em

249
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:47,694
turning tricks on Collins Avenue.

250
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:50,364
I will run it upstairs.
I'll see what I can do.

251
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:52,967
Thank you.
Thank you.

252
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:56,838
How is your magic working?

253
00:14:56,872 --> 00:14:58,039
This is a tough nut,

254
00:14:58,074 --> 00:14:59,976
but I want to prove
Sergeant Batista wrong.

255
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,377
I can do this.
I can do this.

256
00:15:01,411 --> 00:15:03,179
What's his problem with you?

257
00:15:03,213 --> 00:15:05,315
He doesn't think I'm good
enough to date his sister,

258
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:07,483
so I backed off.

259
00:15:07,518 --> 00:15:09,585
Okay.
Stop with the fingers.

260
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,621
We gotta talk.

261
00:15:15,692 --> 00:15:19,961
Look, I--I understand the whole
cowardly geek response.

262
00:15:19,995 --> 00:15:21,396
I'm not a geek.

263
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,763
One bridge at a time, Louis.

264
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,698
You're into Jamie, right?

265
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,133
Well, yeah, she's amazing.

266
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,869
Well, you have to tell her that.

267
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:31,138
When it comes to matters of the heart,

268
00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:33,807
always follow your dick.

269
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:38,812
Yeah, but how am I
ever gonna win over Batista?

270
00:15:38,846 --> 00:15:40,213
You don't.

271
00:15:40,248 --> 00:15:43,116
If Jamie's into you
as much as you're into her,

272
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:46,753
she's gonna take care
of Batista for you.

273
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:48,888
Just don't tell him I told you so.

274
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:50,523
Yeah, I wanted
to talk to Dr. Casey

275
00:15:50,557 --> 00:15:53,892
about this "D" he gave me.

276
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:57,829
When's his class again?

277
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:00,399
Brunner Hall of Science.

278
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:03,435
Got it.
I'll catch him after class.

279
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:14,513
I brought you a sandwich.

280
00:16:14,548 --> 00:16:16,615
Did you find Gellar?

281
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,183
No.

282
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:20,118
But he updated his blog.

283
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:22,121
He did?

284
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,202
You have any idea what this means?

285
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:40,840
"All those following
false prophets are doomed."

286
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,941
It's a message for me.

287
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:46,545
He's offering me a way back in.

288
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,915
And I'm the false prophet.

289
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:54,120
Ever heard of this guy?

290
00:16:54,154 --> 00:16:56,022
Trent Casey?

291
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,157
Yes.
Gellar hates him.

292
00:16:58,192 --> 00:16:59,158
He's an atheist.

293
00:16:59,193 --> 00:17:00,293
Does he hate him enough

294
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:02,828
to want to kill him?

295
00:17:02,863 --> 00:17:06,165
The painting of the Bowls
of Wrath in the church

296
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,335
had "2LOT" written on it.

297
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,903
You think he's the next victim.

298
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:13,506
Yes.

299
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:17,144
How do we find him?

300
00:17:17,178 --> 00:17:21,014
I'll let you know.

301
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:22,182
Oh, man!

302
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,550
All right, boys and girls,

303
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,285
- time for a snack.
- I want one.

304
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,654
Good job.
Time for snack.

305
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:31,391
- Is this your penance too?
- What?

306
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,360
Catering for the toddler horde.

307
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:36,262
My wife's in a meeting.

308
00:17:36,296 --> 00:17:38,197
What's your excuse?

309
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:40,266
I'm here for my son.

310
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,368
Harrison.

311
00:17:42,402 --> 00:17:44,670
Cookie.

312
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:48,307
Thank you, Harrison.

313
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:56,584
That's one's mine.

314
00:18:03,293 --> 00:18:05,461
Hey.

315
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:06,695
How are you?

316
00:18:06,729 --> 00:18:09,064
Uh, okay.

317
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:10,265
How are you?

318
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,068
Uh...
This is a little awkward.

319
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:15,770
But I think I left something
in your car.

320
00:18:15,805 --> 00:18:18,607
Sorry.
I don't have a car.

321
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:21,744
Uhh, didn't I meet you last night

322
00:18:21,778 --> 00:18:22,945
out at Virginia Gardens?

323
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:26,315
Oh, you're looking for my mom.

324
00:18:29,186 --> 00:18:30,754
Mom.

325
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:32,890
Hotness like that's
got to run in the family, right?

326
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:35,626
I mean, she must be like...

327
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:37,328
Holy shit.
Hi.

328
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:38,329
- We got the wrong house.
- Joey.

329
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:40,732
- Hey.
- Okay.

330
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:44,803
So you two met at the club?

331
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:46,104
Oh, no, no.

332
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:47,906
We met across the street
at the Waffle House.

333
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,174
I work the late shift,

334
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,376
and this one was all hands.

335
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,177
Mm.

336
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:54,778
I'd love to hear more,

337
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:57,548
but Joey and I have to get back
to the station.

338
00:18:57,582 --> 00:19:01,551
And we think he may have left
some things in your car.

339
00:19:01,585 --> 00:19:03,953
It wasn't his innocence,
if you know what I mean.

340
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,725
It's unlocked.

341
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,864
Thank you, ma'am.

342
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:15,466
You can't tell anybody about this.

343
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,635
I can say anything I want.

344
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,637
Got it.

345
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:24,510
Oh, my God.
We took pictures.

346
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:31,084
I hope you at least wore--

347
00:19:31,118 --> 00:19:33,153
Oh, no, no, no, no.

348
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:34,487
Oh, great.
Fucking great.

349
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:38,624
Shit.

350
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:39,725
Just call the station.

351
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,127
Have 'em send a tow.

352
00:19:41,162 --> 00:19:43,163
The station doesn't know
that we're down here

353
00:19:43,198 --> 00:19:44,498
getting your gun back,

354
00:19:44,532 --> 00:19:46,333
and we got to keep it that way.

355
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:48,202
Or that you're driving
a car the '70s wants back.

356
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:49,404
Stow it, will you?
I wouldn't have

357
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,605
to be racing back
if it weren't for you.

358
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:51,907
I could have handled this on my own.

359
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,776
You can't handle your balls right now.

360
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,910
When are you gonna grow up?

361
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,245
Like you're one to talk.

362
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,646
Come again?

363
00:19:57,681 --> 00:19:59,214
All you want to do

364
00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:01,184
is try and control everything

365
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,585
and everyone around you

366
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,921
in order to feel better
about your own fucked-up life.

367
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:06,389
You're so full of shit.

368
00:20:06,424 --> 00:20:08,725
Yeah, really?
'Cause your first wife

369
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,092
up and left you.

370
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:13,362
Your second wife, she was
your wife for, what, six months?

371
00:20:13,396 --> 00:20:15,063
And you got a daughter
that wants nothing

372
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:16,064
to do with you.

373
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:17,265
I think you need to shut up.

374
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,600
And now your panties
are in a big wet wad.

375
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,935
Why?
Because your little sister's

376
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,136
dating someone you don't like.

377
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,437
Am I right, lieutenant?

378
00:20:23,471 --> 00:20:24,938
Oh, wait, no, my bad.
I'm sorry.

379
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,573
You're still sergeant,
'cause you fucked that up too.

380
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,321
Come on, is that all you got,
you motherfucker?

381
00:20:40,355 --> 00:20:41,589
Little motherfucker.

382
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,791
Hey!
Leave him alone

383
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,560
or I'll call the police.

384
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,842
Now creationists say

385
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:01,779
the second law of thermodynamics

386
00:21:01,813 --> 00:21:06,918
doesn't allow order
to arise from disorder.

387
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:11,256
So why does this idea

388
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:14,425
make their Bible-clutching
fingers twitch

389
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,595
with excitement, hmm?

390
00:21:17,629 --> 00:21:22,499
Because for creationists,

391
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:26,003
it means that the idea
of evolution, life arising

392
00:21:26,037 --> 00:21:29,472
from chaos,
contradicts the second law.

393
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:30,540
It can't happen.

394
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:32,308
Can I look at your syllabus?

395
00:21:32,343 --> 00:21:34,377
I forgot mine.

396
00:21:34,411 --> 00:21:38,515
- And you need...
- God...

397
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:43,086
...to explain everything, right?

398
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,454
Wrong.

399
00:21:44,488 --> 00:21:46,823
He's kind
of a self-important asshole,

400
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:49,393
but I like him.

401
00:21:49,427 --> 00:21:51,895
Casey's office is in scarnes hall.

402
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,598
And he has late office hours tonight.

403
00:21:54,632 --> 00:21:56,366
In case Gellar decides to show up,

404
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,801
I'll be here as well.

405
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:59,636
This coming from people that think

406
00:21:59,671 --> 00:22:02,139
there are no unicorns
because they were late

407
00:22:02,173 --> 00:22:03,740
getting to Noah's ark.

408
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:06,678
All right, that's all for today.

409
00:22:06,712 --> 00:22:11,649
Read chapters nine
through ten for next week.

410
00:22:11,684 --> 00:22:13,618
Thank you.

411
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,962
- Professor Casey.
- Mm, yes.

412
00:22:23,996 --> 00:22:26,131
I believe you're in danger.

413
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:32,370
What variety of lunatic might you be?

414
00:22:32,404 --> 00:22:33,904
I'm only trying to warn you.

415
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:35,740
Well, then you're one

416
00:22:35,774 --> 00:22:36,841
of the good ones.

417
00:22:36,875 --> 00:22:38,209
Do you have any idea

418
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:41,078
how many threats I get each week?

419
00:22:41,112 --> 00:22:42,246
This one is real.

420
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,580
Please.

421
00:22:43,615 --> 00:22:45,615
Unless you have some proof...

422
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:02,134
One elevator and one set of stairs

423
00:23:02,168 --> 00:23:03,602
equals two exits.

424
00:23:03,636 --> 00:23:06,005
Finally, some use for Travis.

425
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,814
Nice place.

426
00:23:15,849 --> 00:23:17,149
Thank Gellar.

427
00:23:17,183 --> 00:23:18,784
He found it.

428
00:23:18,818 --> 00:23:20,386
So this is where it all started.

429
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:24,189
And where it's going to end.

430
00:23:24,223 --> 00:23:25,857
This has become very important to you,

431
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:28,593
killing Travis' Dark Passenger.

432
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:31,863
Yes.

433
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:33,598
I would have done anything
for a chance

434
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,167
to get rid of yours.

435
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:40,837
I'm not sure you even tried.

436
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:43,039
You just refocused it.

437
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:45,641
So what will you do with him
once Gellar's gone?

438
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,777
Allow him to start over.

439
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:52,281
I know of a few people who
aren't using their identities.

440
00:23:52,316 --> 00:23:54,250
Your slides.

441
00:23:54,284 --> 00:23:58,555
I kill Gellar,
and Travis gets a second chance.

442
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:01,558
The one I'll never have.

443
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:06,197
What is Gellar like?

444
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:07,665
First year of college,

445
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:10,034
I took his class,

446
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:13,973
and he took me under his wing.

447
00:24:14,007 --> 00:24:18,711
Made me feel like I was part
of something important.

448
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:25,085
And I know it sounds crazy,

449
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,789
but he convinced me
that God had chosen us

450
00:24:28,823 --> 00:24:33,593
to become the two witnesses.

451
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:36,597
And what do the two witnesses do?

452
00:24:36,631 --> 00:24:38,665
They enact the <i>Book of Revelation</i>

453
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,435
and bring about the new world.

454
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:45,706
By ending this one.

455
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,908
Why would you want to do that?

456
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:53,313
Have you ever wanted
to wipe everything clean

457
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:56,449
and start your whole life
all over again?

458
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,627
Once Gellar's gone,
you can start again.

459
00:25:16,803 --> 00:25:18,404
There's Gellar.

460
00:25:18,438 --> 00:25:20,473
Let's go.

461
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,984
I'm gonna take the elevator.

462
00:25:32,018 --> 00:25:35,221
If Gellar took the stairs,
maybe I can head him off.

463
00:25:35,255 --> 00:25:38,324
Watch the stairs, make sure
he doesn't double back on me.

464
00:25:38,358 --> 00:25:40,660
Stay here.

465
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:45,998
Gellar doesn't have
much of a head start.

466
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:55,473
He knows I'm here.

467
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:02,075
Come on.

468
00:27:03,477 --> 00:27:05,611
Gellar.

469
00:27:15,323 --> 00:27:16,790
Sorry.

470
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:18,125
You told me
not to move--

471
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,159
Did you see Gellar?

472
00:27:19,193 --> 00:27:20,460
No.

473
00:27:27,668 --> 00:27:29,635
Stay behind me.

474
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:43,350
This is all my fault.

475
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:46,019
Travis is proving to be my penance.

476
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:51,124
There's not that much blood.

477
00:27:51,158 --> 00:27:55,395
Casey could still be alive.

478
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:57,363
Let's go.

479
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:10,209
I can't believe we lost him.

480
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:14,746
And Casey, he's gonna kill him.

481
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,981
We can still stop him.

482
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:19,149
How?

483
00:28:19,184 --> 00:28:22,152
Through you.

484
00:28:22,187 --> 00:28:24,021
This blog that Gellar writes,

485
00:28:24,055 --> 00:28:26,289
it's important to him?

486
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:29,793
Send a message to him.

487
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:31,528
Tell him you've changed your mind

488
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:33,062
and you need to see him.

489
00:28:33,097 --> 00:28:36,099
I'll do it right now.

490
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:43,240
Just keep sending messages.

491
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:46,010
Call me as soon as he responds.

492
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:51,649
Travis posted as the prodigal son,

493
00:28:51,683 --> 00:28:54,485
asking if it's okay for him
to make his way back home.

494
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,889
No response from Gellar.

495
00:28:57,924 --> 00:28:59,057
Hey, good morning.

496
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:01,827
Someone helping you fight crime?

497
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:04,798
All wiggles present and accounted for.

498
00:29:04,832 --> 00:29:06,132
Excellent.

499
00:29:10,103 --> 00:29:11,203
Morgan.

500
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:13,271
DDK struck again
at Miami South campus.

501
00:29:13,306 --> 00:29:15,006
Casey.

502
00:29:15,041 --> 00:29:17,008
I'm on my way.

503
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:19,243
Casey's lecture hall.
Of course.

504
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:21,312
Gellar laid him out where he preaches

505
00:29:21,346 --> 00:29:25,316
his godless doctrine
to the young and impressionable.

506
00:29:34,394 --> 00:29:36,429
This is Professor Trent Casey.

507
00:29:36,463 --> 00:29:38,230
He's an evolutionary biologist

508
00:29:38,265 --> 00:29:39,532
and noted atheist.

509
00:29:39,566 --> 00:29:40,934
Check it out.

510
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:43,737
The abdomen's got
a Alpha-Omega carved into it.

511
00:29:43,771 --> 00:29:44,938
Similar to the fruit vendor.

512
00:29:44,972 --> 00:29:46,173
Only this guy's missing stitches.

513
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:47,941
And a hand.

514
00:29:47,975 --> 00:29:49,676
That's new.

515
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,845
The puckering on the wrist tissue

516
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,447
indicates the hand was removed
post-mortem.

517
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:57,050
And judging from his pallor,
all his blood's been drained.

518
00:29:57,084 --> 00:29:59,552
Looks like he was strung up
and bled out.

519
00:29:59,586 --> 00:30:01,454
Gellar took another page

520
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:04,490
from my brother Brian's playbook.

521
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,661
His stomach cavity's
been hollowed out.

522
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:13,866
Any bets on the prize DDK left inside?

523
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,668
Unis swept the room.

524
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:18,004
They didn't find
any trip wires or blood.

525
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:19,973
So if this is the Bowls of Wrath,

526
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:23,042
then, what, is it gonna show up
in a bowl somewhere?

527
00:30:23,076 --> 00:30:25,410
Open him up.

528
00:30:25,445 --> 00:30:28,413
Brace yourselves for awful.

529
00:30:32,418 --> 00:30:34,085
Uh.

530
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:36,520
He's empty.

531
00:30:36,555 --> 00:30:40,090
So, then, where are the Bowls
of Wrath?

532
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,292
Let's get him
to the M.E.'s office.

533
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:44,328
- Somebody get a gurney.
- I got it.

534
00:30:44,362 --> 00:30:46,597
Quinn's right.

535
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:51,435
If each bowl is a plague
that God poured...

536
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:54,238
Hey, don't.

537
00:30:57,375 --> 00:30:59,677
Oh, my God.

538
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:01,712
What the fuck?

539
00:31:05,651 --> 00:31:07,586
Gellar hasn't seen wrath

540
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,921
until he's seen mine.

541
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,510
Are you serious?

542
00:32:03,545 --> 00:32:05,012
Bowls of blood dropped on my head?

543
00:32:05,047 --> 00:32:06,747
It's like a perfect fucking metaphor

544
00:32:06,782 --> 00:32:08,182
for my entire fucking life.

545
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:09,617
I'm not even sure I believe in God,

546
00:32:09,651 --> 00:32:12,086
but I'm pretty sure he hates me.

547
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,690
Losing your parents is difficult.

548
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:20,561
Having a loved one shot
in front of you is unthinkable.

549
00:32:20,596 --> 00:32:22,430
Finding out that your fiance
is a serial killer--

550
00:32:22,464 --> 00:32:27,035
Did I mention that he was
Dexter's biological brother?

551
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:29,771
No, you did not.

552
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:31,139
So wait a minute--

553
00:32:31,173 --> 00:32:33,007
the Ice Truck Killer was your brother?

554
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:35,543
No.
Dexter was adopted.

555
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,779
So we're not blood-related.

556
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:40,949
Oh.

557
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:44,319
What?
What does that "oh" mean?

558
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:45,520
You mentioned that your father

559
00:32:45,554 --> 00:32:48,223
didn't pay much attention to you.

560
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,192
What was his relationship
with Dexter like?

561
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:54,329
They did everything together.

562
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:58,533
And without your mother...

563
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:00,268
I was left behind.

564
00:33:02,171 --> 00:33:05,974
You can move forward, Debra.

565
00:33:06,008 --> 00:33:08,043
But it's gonna mean
taking responsibility

566
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:09,578
for your feelings and your choices.

567
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,113
What does that mean?

568
00:33:14,118 --> 00:33:15,985
Please don't misunderstand me.

569
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,588
I am very sensitive to the trauma

570
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,591
and the tragedy
that you've experienced.

571
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,727
But, as far
as your failed relationships

572
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:25,696
are concerned...

573
00:33:27,498 --> 00:33:28,932
What?

574
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:31,401
We are responsible
for the partners we choose.

575
00:33:31,435 --> 00:33:34,570
Bullshit.

576
00:33:34,605 --> 00:33:36,539
How the fuck was I supposed to know

577
00:33:36,573 --> 00:33:39,241
that Rudy was the Ice Truck Killer?

578
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:43,245
Are you saying that I chose
to be with a serial killer

579
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,480
on purpose?

580
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:46,181
I think you have a history of choosing

581
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:48,250
inappropriate or unavailable men.

582
00:33:48,285 --> 00:33:52,021
Well, what the fuck
do you want me to say?

583
00:33:52,055 --> 00:33:54,657
That my life is a train wreck
of a disaster?

584
00:33:54,691 --> 00:33:57,127
That my life is a shithole?
Well, I already know this.

585
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:58,528
This isn't news to me, okay?

586
00:33:58,563 --> 00:33:59,931
I know that I am broken.

587
00:33:59,965 --> 00:34:02,099
Do you know that you don't have to be?

588
00:34:02,134 --> 00:34:05,871
You can pick up the pieces.

589
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:08,707
- How?
- By making different choices.

590
00:34:08,741 --> 00:34:10,742
By breaking your patterns.

591
00:34:10,776 --> 00:34:14,079
Debra, it's gonna be hard.

592
00:34:14,113 --> 00:34:16,749
But you can make yourself whole again.

593
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:19,551
You can.

594
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:32,498
I heard about the bloodbath
at the crime scene.

595
00:34:32,532 --> 00:34:33,899
You okay?

596
00:34:33,934 --> 00:34:36,736
I'm fine.

597
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,170
I was actually coming down
to talk to you

598
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:39,772
about your request to open
the dead call girl's case.

599
00:34:39,806 --> 00:34:41,641
And?

600
00:34:41,675 --> 00:34:44,244
You can't afford to put an unsolved

601
00:34:44,278 --> 00:34:45,745
- back on your plate.
- Jesus fuck.

602
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,846
Are we really gonna do this again?

603
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:48,481
Careful, lieutenant.

604
00:34:48,516 --> 00:34:50,450
I'm just gonna stop you
right here, okay?

605
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:53,153
- Excuse me?
- We've been through this.

606
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:55,054
You're gonna say it's not happening

607
00:34:55,088 --> 00:34:57,156
and that I better do what you say

608
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,692
'cause you're gonna give me
some scary, squinty-eyed look,

609
00:34:59,726 --> 00:35:02,694
but I am so fucking sick

610
00:35:02,729 --> 00:35:06,197
of having this conversation.

611
00:35:06,232 --> 00:35:08,834
So I'm just gonna break
the pattern right now.

612
00:35:08,868 --> 00:35:11,103
If you have a problem with me

613
00:35:11,138 --> 00:35:13,907
investigating a potential homicide,

614
00:35:13,941 --> 00:35:16,009
which is my job,

615
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:17,644
then fire me.

616
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:20,647
Otherwise, I am reopening the case.

617
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:47,138
Morgan won't let
the call girl's death go.

618
00:35:47,172 --> 00:35:48,239
God damn it.

619
00:35:48,273 --> 00:35:49,407
I could have pressed harder,

620
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,910
but she'd only be more suspicious.

621
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:56,181
You know, it wasn't until I did CPR

622
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:59,017
that I saw the drugs
and realized she O.D.'d.

623
00:35:59,051 --> 00:36:01,553
Maria, I swear to God,
I did all I could.

624
00:36:01,587 --> 00:36:05,990
Your career would have been
over if you'd stayed.

625
00:36:06,024 --> 00:36:08,192
What the fuck is Morgan thinking?

626
00:36:08,227 --> 00:36:09,794
Doesn't she know when to back off?

627
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:12,831
Well, isn't that tenacity
the reason you promoted her

628
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:15,834
in the first place?
Against my advice, of course.

629
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,108
We have to stop her.

630
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:26,578
Don't worry.

631
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,255
Hello?

632
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:39,090
The police found Casey's body.

633
00:36:40,892 --> 00:36:43,260
The Bowls of Wrath.
He's done it.

634
00:36:43,295 --> 00:36:44,629
The body was missing a hand.

635
00:36:44,663 --> 00:36:46,863
Any idea why Gellar took it?

636
00:36:46,898 --> 00:36:50,100
The writing is on the wall.

637
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:52,368
- What?
- The expression.

638
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:54,470
It's from the Bible.

639
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:57,072
The fingers of a human hand appeared

640
00:36:57,107 --> 00:37:02,944
and wrote out,
"Your days are numbered."

641
00:37:02,978 --> 00:37:04,812
Gellar's sending another message.

642
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,480
What's the message?

643
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:10,117
I don't know.

644
00:37:10,152 --> 00:37:11,652
But it doesn't matter.

645
00:37:11,686 --> 00:37:13,721
Gellar contacted me through his blog.

646
00:37:13,755 --> 00:37:15,256
He wants me to meet him
at the church tonight.

647
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,024
Stay in the motel.
I'll pick you up later.

648
00:37:21,297 --> 00:37:23,264
You have Bowls of Wrath blood work?

649
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:25,567
Yeah, just finished.

650
00:37:25,601 --> 00:37:28,637
Good news.
The blood was pathogen-free.

651
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:30,505
So the shot I got was just for fun?

652
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:34,609
Are you okay?

653
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:36,612
Yeah, I just threw away
a pair of shoes

654
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:40,883
because they're full of blood,
but I'm great.

655
00:37:40,918 --> 00:37:45,956
'Cause I'm here if you need a chair.

656
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,224
- What?
- What you said before.

657
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:49,825
I'm a chair.

658
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:51,193
Yeah, but I don't want a chair.

659
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,362
I want a table.

660
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,497
What are you even saying?

661
00:37:55,531 --> 00:37:58,099
Never mind.

662
00:37:58,134 --> 00:38:00,234
Are we okay?

663
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,605
I have no idea if you are.

664
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,673
I'm sure not, but I'm working on it.

665
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:16,349
Louis Greene is the man.

666
00:38:16,383 --> 00:38:18,185
Easy with the bromance.

667
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:19,553
You're gonna pitch a tent.

668
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:20,854
Well, just remember
that I discovered him

669
00:38:20,888 --> 00:38:22,022
when I'm up for review.

670
00:38:22,056 --> 00:38:23,189
What'd he do?

671
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:26,226
Unscrambled the I.P.A.
of Gellar's blogs

672
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,897
and tracked it to an address.

673
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,066
Anderson, grab your gear.

674
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,335
Right behind you.

675
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:38,238
Yeah, that's my I.P. address,

676
00:38:38,273 --> 00:38:40,541
but it's unsecured,
so I couldn't tell you

677
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:41,909
who all uses the signal.

678
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:43,377
What's the signal's range?

679
00:38:43,411 --> 00:38:44,878
Give or take 500 feet.

680
00:38:44,912 --> 00:38:46,713
Well, you're putting out
1,000 milliwatts.

681
00:38:46,747 --> 00:38:50,150
I'm guessing it's probably
closer to 900 feet.

682
00:38:50,185 --> 00:38:51,985
These guys ever come in here?

683
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,855
I wouldn't know,
but I can keep an eye out

684
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:56,390
- if you want.
- Yeah, we'd appreciate that.

685
00:38:56,424 --> 00:38:59,060
You bet.

686
00:38:59,094 --> 00:39:00,661
You know, your guys
could drive up anytime,

687
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:02,931
use their laptop, and never
even get out of their car.

688
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,699
Up to 900 feet?

689
00:39:04,733 --> 00:39:06,267
Give or take.

690
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:07,935
Further if there's an antenna
within range.

691
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:09,236
What would that do?

692
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,106
Boost the signal by a couple miles.

693
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:15,142
What are you thinking?

694
00:39:15,176 --> 00:39:17,511
I want to bring in some unis,
have them fan out,

695
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:21,014
canvass the surrounding area,
see what they come up with.

696
00:39:21,048 --> 00:39:24,684
Louis, I'd buy you a beer,
but it has been a long day.

697
00:39:24,718 --> 00:39:27,720
Thanks.
I have plans anyway.

698
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,966
Uh...

699
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,034
Wow.

700
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:44,105
People love their games.

701
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:47,242
- There's a lot of money in it.
- Yeah.

702
00:39:47,276 --> 00:39:52,046
I guess.

703
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,484
You have quite the collection...

704
00:39:56,518 --> 00:40:01,722
of collections.

705
00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:04,758
Yeah, I don't--I don't
let a lot of people in here.

706
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,226
It's kind of obvious

707
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:10,964
I'm overcompensating for something.

708
00:40:10,998 --> 00:40:12,867
Oh, I've been known to collect.

709
00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:14,468
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

710
00:40:14,503 --> 00:40:18,006
I went through an '80s phase
in high school.

711
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:22,577
I had a zillion
of those black rubber bracelets.

712
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:25,413
Wore them like body armor.

713
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,249
So...

714
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:30,919
So weird I understand.

715
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:36,124
But why did you blow me off?

716
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:38,761
I was, um--

717
00:40:38,795 --> 00:40:42,064
I was trying to be respectful
of sergeant Batista,

718
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:44,567
A.K.A. your brother,
who happens to carry

719
00:40:44,601 --> 00:40:48,337
a very large gun, by the way.

720
00:40:48,372 --> 00:40:52,876
He sort of gently suggested
that I back off.

721
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:54,778
He scared you.

722
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:56,980
Does it make me a pussy if I say yes?

723
00:40:57,014 --> 00:41:00,317
It makes you honest.

724
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,401
There's another door along that side

725
00:41:50,435 --> 00:41:51,702
at the west narthex,

726
00:41:51,737 --> 00:41:53,704
and a door at the very end

727
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:56,241
just off the sacristy.

728
00:41:56,275 --> 00:41:58,310
But you always go
in the main entrance?

729
00:41:58,344 --> 00:42:00,346
- We both do.
- Then go in that way.

730
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,049
And then what?

731
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:07,719
Just talk to him,
tell him you made a mistake,

732
00:42:07,754 --> 00:42:09,955
that you're sorry.
Keep him engaged.

733
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:11,923
And what will you do?

734
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:14,659
I'll go in the back way.

735
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:17,863
And then...

736
00:42:17,897 --> 00:42:20,064
It's better you don't know.

737
00:42:22,701 --> 00:42:24,435
You don't trust me.

738
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:28,505
- Oh, it's not that.
- No, I understand.

739
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:29,606
Gellar's too smart.

740
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:32,009
I'd just give it away.

741
00:42:32,044 --> 00:42:34,512
Just do what you have to do.

742
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:39,051
I will.

743
00:43:12,421 --> 00:43:14,556
Hello, Travis.

744
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,226
Professor Gellar.

745
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:23,398
I'm kind of surprised
you haven't burst into flames.

746
00:43:23,432 --> 00:43:26,935
God is very kind.

747
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,072
God doesn't want to hurt me.

748
00:43:30,106 --> 00:43:32,374
Don't fuckin' tell me what God wants

749
00:43:32,409 --> 00:43:34,443
or doesn't want.

750
00:43:34,477 --> 00:43:37,146
You have no idea.

751
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:39,882
You're wrong.

752
00:43:39,916 --> 00:43:42,885
I don't believe
in a God of violence--

753
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:44,820
Then go read your Bible.

754
00:43:44,854 --> 00:43:46,555
Because God promises

755
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:49,491
that the devious tongue
will be cut out.

756
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,460
And he will tear you limb from limb

757
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:55,063
and destroy thee forever.

758
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:57,766
Repent your sins, Travis,

759
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:02,604
or you will burn for all eternity.

760
00:44:02,638 --> 00:44:05,874
I have only tried to do
what I thought was right,

761
00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:09,144
- what I thought--
- No!

762
00:44:09,178 --> 00:44:12,581
God has given you so many chances,

763
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,151
and you disappoint him
time after time.

764
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:19,656
But he loves you.

765
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,527
He truly loves you.

766
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:28,098
He's gonna give you one more chance.

767
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:31,368
And all you have to do
is listen to me.

768
00:44:33,604 --> 00:44:36,473
Come to me.

769
00:44:56,228 --> 00:45:00,866
You've got a lot riding on
this second chance for Travis.

770
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,802
It's up to him
what he does with his life

771
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:04,236
once I'm done with Gellar.

772
00:45:04,271 --> 00:45:06,439
What about your life?

773
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:07,906
My life?

774
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,842
Dexter, the police
are closing in on Gellar.

775
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,243
You're taking a risk here.

776
00:45:11,278 --> 00:45:12,678
This isn't just about Travis.

777
00:45:12,712 --> 00:45:14,379
You're not that unselfish.

778
00:45:14,414 --> 00:45:17,015
I'm more than you ever thought I'd be.

779
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,651
So if you remove
Travis' Dark Passenger,

780
00:45:19,685 --> 00:45:22,353
what are you getting out of this?

781
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:26,924
Maybe...I can learn
to control my own.

782
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,860
Maybe I can be...

783
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,862
- a better...
- A better what?

784
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:33,264
A better person?

785
00:45:33,298 --> 00:45:35,433
I don't care about
being a better person.

786
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:36,634
It's too late for that.

787
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:38,670
Then what do you care about?

788
00:45:42,275 --> 00:45:46,947
A better father to my son.

789
00:45:46,981 --> 00:45:49,949
Is that so surprising to you?

790
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,524
I want to be a better father
for Harrison.

791
00:46:06,165 --> 00:46:08,133
I have work to do.

792
00:47:03,892 --> 00:47:05,560
Travis.

793
00:47:05,594 --> 00:47:08,496
He's still breathing.

794
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,664
Travis.

795
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:12,666
Where is Gellar?

796
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,362
Gellar.

797
00:48:54,087 --> 00:48:56,489
He's been dead all along.

798
00:48:59,975 --> 00:49:02,309
Did Travis act alone?

799
00:49:05,419 --> 00:49:10,184
Did Travis kill all those people?

800
00:49:12,988 --> 00:49:22,633
