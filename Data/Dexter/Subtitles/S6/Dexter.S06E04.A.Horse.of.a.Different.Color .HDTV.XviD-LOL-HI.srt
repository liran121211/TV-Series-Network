That takes us
to the snakes killing.

00:01:51,139 --> 00:01:53,343
Maybe Brother Sam
was right about our victim.

You think that
my becoming lieutenant

had anything to do
with what happened between us?

10
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:09,760
No, I'm sure it was just
a big fuckin' coincidence.

Deb, you're too smart to think
that this was gonna be easy.

I put my ass on the line
even considering you,

I do.

25
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,481
Some people think that religion

26
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:54,383
began as a way
for primitive cultures

27
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:56,986

have made religion obsolete.

it were that simple.

But Brother Sam believes,

37
00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:32,319
and because of that,
he's fulfilled.

00:09:41,725 --> 00:09:45,228
Want to bet he left one
on the snakes victim too?

183
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:49,066
Nothing behind his eyes.

184
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,035
What about the mouth
or the ears?

185
00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:52,503
Already checked.

186
00:09:52,537 --> 00:09:55,272
Well, what are we missing?

187
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:57,041
We're not.

188
00:09:57,075 --> 00:09:59,643
It's what <i>he's</i> missing.

189
00:09:59,678 --> 00:10:02,580
His intestines.

190
00:10:02,614 --> 00:10:04,783
Ugh.

191
00:10:09,355 --> 00:10:11,990
Kind of reminds me of looking
for the prize in a cereal box.

192
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:15,260
You were always
good at that too.

193
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:17,396
Jackpot.

194
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,998
1237, 1242.

195
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,566
What do you think it means?

196
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:24,369
That I've been lieutenant
for less than a week

197
00:10:24,404 --> 00:10:27,238
and there's already
some game-playing,

198
00:10:27,273 --> 00:10:29,374
sick-as-fuck serial killer
for me to catch?

199
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:31,676
Technically,
he's not a serial killer.

200
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,677
Yet.

201
00:10:33,712 --> 00:10:35,512
Serial killing
involves the murder

202
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,915
of several people in three
or more separate events.

203
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,851
So far our guy's only done two.

204
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:42,886
Are you trying to make me
feel better or worse?

205
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,021
[Cell phone rings]

206
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:48,593
Sorry.

207
00:10:48,627 --> 00:10:49,928
It's Jamie.

208
00:10:49,962 --> 00:10:51,763
Hey, everything okay?

209
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:53,999
Oh, Harrison
isn't feeling so great.

210
00:10:54,033 --> 00:10:55,234
What happened?

211
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,635
I don't know.
[Harrison crying]

212
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,604
He didn't--
he didn't eat breakfast.

213
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,874
But, I mean,
he seems okay otherwise.

214
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:03,375
Just a little tired.
I don't know.

215
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,578
Maybe it's a tummy ache, or--

216
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:07,479
Should I cancel his play date?

217
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:08,614
Yeah, absolutely.

218
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:10,549
It's better to be safe
than sorry.

219
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:11,850
- Okay.
- If he gets any worse--

220
00:11:11,884 --> 00:11:13,952
I'll call you.
I promise.

221
00:11:13,986 --> 00:11:15,787
[Phone beeps]

222
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:19,224
You wanted to see me?

223
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:20,825
Yeah, this four horsemen case,

224
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,827
it's all over the news.

225
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:23,295
We need to address the press.

226
00:11:23,329 --> 00:11:24,897
Already two steps ahead of you.

227
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,532
I called the conference
for this afternoon,

228
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:27,766
and I'm working on
the statement.

229
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:30,269
Well, Morgan's
gonna make the statement.

230
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:32,672
But she doesn't
have any experience.

231
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:34,908
I've led hundreds
of press conferences,

232
00:11:34,943 --> 00:11:36,343
and, really,
under the circumstances--

233
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:39,013
Morgan is the new face
of this department, Maria.

234
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,916
- I'm still--
- The old face.

235
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,852
No, set it up
for tomorrow afternoon.

236
00:11:44,886 --> 00:11:47,655
Fine.

237
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:49,890
[Phone ringing]

238
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:53,294
Why the fuck would <i>I</i>
lead a press conference?

239
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:54,628
Isn't that your thing?

240
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,764
Uh, usually, yes,

241
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:58,031
but I made a strategic decision

242
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,399
to put you in the spotlight.

243
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:00,934
You'll give the public
the impression

244
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:02,302
that the situation's
less critical.

245
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:05,739
Besides, dealing with the press
is your responsibility

246
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:07,807
as lieutenant.

247
00:12:07,842 --> 00:12:09,242
I thought my responsibility

248
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:10,677
was catching the horse fucker
that's killing people.

249
00:12:10,711 --> 00:12:12,745
You'll have to learn
to multitask.

250
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,146
And while you're at it,

251
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:17,049
you still haven't finished
your fit for duty therapy.

252
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,351
The shooting
was over two weeks ago.

253
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:20,153
How am I supposed to find time
to go to a therapist?

254
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:22,122
Figure it out.

255
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:24,892
You're a liability
until you get cleared.

256
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:31,200
Fucking nightmare.

257
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:36,772
You okay?

258
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:40,309
Obviously.

259
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,178
You'll be fine.

260
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,114
Just--
Hey, never mind.

261
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:46,982
Not my place.

262
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,685
What? Tell me.

263
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:53,054
You just might want to...

264
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:56,758
dress a little more...
professional.

265
00:12:56,792 --> 00:12:58,960
Like a lieutenant.

266
00:12:58,994 --> 00:13:01,729
I mean, you know, uh,
skirt suit, heels.

267
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,765
What's wrong
with the way I dress?

268
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,868
I mean, you kind of
look like you're--

269
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,538
What?
A detective?

270
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,941
No, like you're
going to a hoedown.

271
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:17,215
Where should I put
the medical examiner's report

272
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:18,383
for the four horsemen's case?

273
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:20,084
Uh, wherever.

274
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,119
Uh, you busy later?

275
00:13:21,153 --> 00:13:23,388
Thought we could have
our second date.

276
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:25,824
Sure, I have roller derby
practice until 9:00,

277
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:27,125
but we can totally hang after.

278
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:28,659
Wait, wait, wait.
You're a--

279
00:13:28,694 --> 00:13:29,660
you're a derby girl?

280
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:31,428
Got the bruises to prove it.

281
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:33,029
I think my head just exploded.

282
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,266
I have an idea.

283
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,268
Why don't we have
our second date right now?

284
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:40,603
What are you thinking?

285
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,772
Little make out session
in the women's bathroom?

286
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:45,341
I was thinking
some show and tell

287
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,709
in the evidence room?

288
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,277
Even better.

289
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,813
Not the dirty kind.

290
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:53,649
You know, showing me
the Ice Truck Killer stuff

291
00:13:53,684 --> 00:13:55,118
was so cool.

292
00:13:55,152 --> 00:13:57,353
I was just thinking maybe you
could show me the Trinity stuff

293
00:13:57,387 --> 00:13:58,788
or the Bay Harbor Butcher
evidence.

294
00:13:58,822 --> 00:14:00,189
I can't.

295
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:01,891
The FBI has all those files.

296
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,727
But, um, I promise
to make it up to you later.

297
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,264
You better.

298
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:08,599
Now open the M.E.'s report.

299
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:10,968
I'm dying to know what it says.

300
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,976
When Brian sent messages,

301
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:20,178
they were tailor-made for me.

302
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,780
But I should still be able
to crack this guy's code.

303
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,417
- All right.
- Ready?

304
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,952
Okay.
Let's do this.

305
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:29,621
Most of you have already met
detective Mike Anderson.

306
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:30,823
He's working on a theory

307
00:14:30,857 --> 00:14:32,258
that our killer
is reenacting scenes

308
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,493
from the <i>Book of Revelation.</i>

309
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:35,728
There's a lot
of brutal imagery here,

310
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:37,664
and our killer had
a lot to choose from.

311
00:14:37,698 --> 00:14:39,599
I just the M.E. report
from the four horsemen vic.

312
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:40,600
And guess what it says?

313
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:41,601
Must be pretty important

314
00:14:41,635 --> 00:14:42,835
for you to bust in here
like this.

315
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,337
Uh, he's a little bit
of a drama queen.

316
00:14:44,371 --> 00:14:46,705
There were traces of
oxidized iron in the kill wound.

317
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,006
Rust.

318
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:49,608
I mean, nobody's used
iron to make weapons

319
00:14:49,642 --> 00:14:51,042
since the Middle Ages,

320
00:14:51,077 --> 00:14:54,345
which means our killer could
have used a ancient artifact.

321
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:55,780
What kind of artifact?

322
00:14:55,814 --> 00:14:57,047
I'm not sure yet.

323
00:14:57,082 --> 00:14:59,650
But the dimensions of the wound
suggest a sword.

324
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:01,853
Um, but there are hundreds
of varieties of swords.

325
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,054
Great. Stay on that.

326
00:15:03,088 --> 00:15:04,322
Mike, you were saying?

327
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:06,490
So far our killer
has given us three tableaus.

328
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:09,393
The intestines on the scale,
the snakes victim,

329
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:10,494
and the four horsemen.

330
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,264
I'm sorry.
Uh, tableaus?

331
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:14,666
It's a theatrical term

332
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,969
referring to a picturesque
grouping of people or objects.

333
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,170
Oh, all this time

334
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:19,805
I just thought
they were called crime scenes.

335
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,339
No, it's more
than just a crime scene.

336
00:15:21,374 --> 00:15:22,941
Everything he's showing us
has meaning.

337
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,342
From the positioning
of the bodies

338
00:15:24,377 --> 00:15:26,744
to the clothes
he puts on his victims,

339
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:28,079
nothing's by accident.

340
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:29,080
Exactly.

341
00:15:29,114 --> 00:15:30,347
He's communicating with us.

342
00:15:30,382 --> 00:15:32,416
Mike's just helping
with the translation.

343
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,917
The four horsemen
of the apocalypse

344
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:36,319
are described in <i>Revelation</i> 6,

345
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,920
Verses one through eight.

346
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:40,123
As for the seven snakes murder,

347
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:41,691
<i>Revelation</i> 13.

348
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,960
"And I stood upon
the sand of the sea

349
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:46,229
"and saw a serpent
rise out of the sea,

350
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:48,832
having seven heads."

351
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,567
And what about the intestines?

352
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:53,237
There's no passage
on intestines,

353
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:55,506
but the scales of justice
are all over the Bible.

354
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,108
I figure he's referencing
God's judgment of mankind.

355
00:15:58,143 --> 00:15:59,577
What about the numbers
we found on the body?

356
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:01,378
1237 and 1242.

357
00:16:01,413 --> 00:16:02,746
Don't know.

358
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,581
But I can get in touch
with a <i>Revelation</i> expert

359
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:07,818
who might be able
to tell us more.

360
00:16:07,852 --> 00:16:11,088
They happened five days apart.

361
00:16:11,122 --> 00:16:13,123
The two murders happened
five days apart.

362
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:15,959
The difference between
1237 and 1242 is five.

363
00:16:15,994 --> 00:16:17,494
I don't know why
I didn't see it before.

364
00:16:17,528 --> 00:16:19,429
So the numbers are days.

365
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:20,730
He's counting up to something.

366
00:16:20,764 --> 00:16:22,332
- To what?
- Don't know.

367
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:24,701
But if all this
<i>Revelation</i> stuff

368
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,836
has to do with doomsday,

369
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,971
maybe it's to the end
of the world.

370
00:16:29,006 --> 00:16:30,072
Okay.

371
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:32,474
So we're looking
for a religious nutbag.

372
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,943
Quinn, Batista,
round up any end-times fanatics

373
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,878
that might have
criminal records.

374
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,648
Let's find this...Doomsday killer.

375
00:16:51,629 --> 00:16:53,697
It's happening, Travis.

376
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:55,966
Look around us.

377
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,836
People are afraid.

378
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,272
Soon you'll start
to understand what we're--

379
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:10,512
Travis...
Are you listening to me?

380
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:13,081
Yes.
They're afraid.

381
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:16,284
Okay, I got it.
She's pretty.

382
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:17,385
Who?

383
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:18,385
The waitress.

384
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,388
You've been staring at her.

385
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:25,227
But we really have
to stay focused.

386
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,831
So you don't think
I should ask her out?

387
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:29,832
Is that what you want?

388
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:32,869
I don't know.
Maybe.

389
00:17:32,904 --> 00:17:34,004
I think she likes me.

390
00:17:34,038 --> 00:17:36,374
Hey, Trav.
Can I get you anything else?

391
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:40,545
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

392
00:17:40,579 --> 00:17:42,914
Thank you.

393
00:17:46,552 --> 00:17:49,187
I thought religion
was supposed to be comforting.

394
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:51,523
But swarms of locusts,
bowls of wrath?

395
00:17:51,557 --> 00:17:54,859
Why would anybody want
to believe this stuff?

396
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,797
Be honest.

397
00:17:59,832 --> 00:18:01,466
Professional or stupid?

398
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,034
Professional.

399
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:04,702
Ha.

400
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:06,604
But you don't look
much like you.

401
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:08,639
[Chuckles]

402
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:10,909
You want to tell me how
I'm supposed to catch Doomsday

403
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:13,945
if I'm spending all my time
writing press statements,

404
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:15,913
going to
court-ordered therapy,

405
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:18,082
and shopping
for ugly-ass clothes?

406
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:20,118
You'll figure it out.
You always do.

407
00:18:20,152 --> 00:18:22,186
Quinn used to say that
when I was in meltdown mode.

408
00:18:22,221 --> 00:18:23,254
He saw you in meltdown mode

409
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:25,256
and he still wanted
to marry you?

410
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,925
- Poop explosion.
- Harrison?

411
00:18:27,959 --> 00:18:29,927
If it's Jamie,
you've got bigger problems.

412
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:31,728
Keep an eye on him while
I'm down in the laundry room?

413
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,196
His tummy still upset?

414
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,397
Yeah, it's probably just a bug,

415
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:35,932
but I can take him
to the doctor tomorrow.

416
00:18:35,966 --> 00:18:37,767
Whew.

417
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:40,203
Hey, what's the matter,
little man?

418
00:18:40,238 --> 00:18:42,806
You don't feel so good?

419
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:44,842
[Whimpers]

420
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:48,580
Wish I could make it
all better.

421
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,053
I guess there are some things

422
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:56,589
even daddies can't fix.

423
00:19:09,304 --> 00:19:12,307
So I gave you
the friends and family rate,

424
00:19:12,341 --> 00:19:14,876
and I can have that
to you ASAP.

425
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,078
Thanks.
The sooner the better.

426
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,313
I just want to let you know
I'm taking off, all right?

427
00:19:19,348 --> 00:19:20,915
All right.

428
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,984
Dex, what's up?

429
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:23,985
'Sup?

430
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:25,319
So you headed off to class?

431
00:19:25,354 --> 00:19:27,121
Hey, Sam's sending me
to computer class.

432
00:19:27,155 --> 00:19:28,756
Gonna build him
a bomb website, yo.

433
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:29,824
Yeah, you better.

434
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:30,925
All right.
Laters.

435
00:19:30,959 --> 00:19:31,926
Be safe. Later.

436
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:33,228
See you, Nick.

437
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,496
You really take care
of these guys.

438
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:38,399
Yeah, well, you know,
God's taking care of all of us.

439
00:19:38,434 --> 00:19:42,370
Here go your estimate.
Again.

440
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:50,012
Are these your notes?

441
00:19:50,046 --> 00:19:52,247
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

442
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:54,850
Every time I read it,
I'm finding something new.

443
00:19:54,884 --> 00:19:56,084
You ever read it?

444
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,421
Yeah, I just started.
For work.

445
00:19:59,456 --> 00:20:01,224
We're tracking this killer.

446
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:02,859
We think he's reenacting scenes

447
00:20:02,893 --> 00:20:05,695
from the <i>Book of Revelation.</i>

448
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:10,267
That four horsemen case
from the news, yeah?

449
00:20:10,301 --> 00:20:13,104
Lord have mercy.

450
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:15,640
Saying it's in the name
of God--

451
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:18,110
the devil is busy.

452
00:20:18,144 --> 00:20:21,213
You think he's using God
as an excuse to kill?

453
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:23,849
People use God as an excuse
for a lot of things.

454
00:20:23,884 --> 00:20:27,820
Just because he believes
in some crazy bullshit,

455
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:31,658
that don't mean his faith
is any less real.

456
00:20:31,692 --> 00:20:34,194
But if faith makes people
do such crazy bullshit,

457
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:36,263
what's the point of having it?

458
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:38,832
It's human nature.

459
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,933
Gotta believe in something.

460
00:20:40,968 --> 00:20:42,635
Right?

461
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:46,439
I mean, haven't you ever
had a problem so big

462
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:48,173
that you just couldn't
handle it on your own?

463
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:49,708
Yeah.

464
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:53,545
Well, who helped you?

465
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,814
My dad.

466
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,585
Hmm.

467
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:03,689
Well, you're lucky.
You're blessed.

468
00:21:03,723 --> 00:21:06,859
That's a blessing.

469
00:21:06,893 --> 00:21:10,029
Faith, man, you put it
in the wrong things...

470
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,502
fuck you up.

471
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,410
[Sighs] Ugh.

472
00:21:23,444 --> 00:21:26,480
Goddamn pantyhose.

473
00:21:26,514 --> 00:21:30,750
Has anyone ever died
from crotch asphyxiation?

474
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:32,252
You have now crossed the line

475
00:21:32,286 --> 00:21:34,254
into inappropriate
brother-sister exchanges.

476
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:37,590
[Elevator bell dings]

477
00:21:37,624 --> 00:21:40,159
Is that lieutenant Morgan
in a skirt?

478
00:21:40,193 --> 00:21:41,427
I don't know.

479
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:42,961
I don't recognize her
without the man boots.

480
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,062
You'll recognize my foot

481
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,830
when it's kicking you
in the face.

482
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:47,865
But the Mayan
calendar says--

483
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,700
The Mayans weren't Christians.

484
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:52,002
Look, God told Noah
that the great flood

485
00:21:52,037 --> 00:21:53,370
would be in seven days.

486
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:56,105
Batista and Quinn's
people of interest.

487
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,408
Even if none of them
is Doomsday,

488
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,544
they're all totally insane.

489
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,279
At 9:45 yesterday morning,

490
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:07,951
four horses were released
at the intersection...

491
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:11,788
Lieutenant...you ready
for the press conference?

492
00:22:11,822 --> 00:22:13,723
Yeah, I'm just...

493
00:22:13,758 --> 00:22:16,259
practicing my statement.

494
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,728
You want some honest advice?

495
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:20,063
I guess.

496
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:23,000
Lose the speech.
Just relax.

497
00:22:23,034 --> 00:22:24,534
Have a conversation.

498
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:26,136
You're not a formal person,

499
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:30,507
so a formal statement
could come off as insincere.

500
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,776
So you're saying
I should just...

501
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,944
be myself?

502
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:36,146
Exactly.

503
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:38,815
Nice shoes, by the way.

504
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,283
They look better on.

505
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,152
Yeah, well, they hurt my feet.

506
00:22:42,186 --> 00:22:44,521
You know what else
you could use?

507
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:56,432
Nice.

Brother Sam reads
his Bible like I read blood,

510
00:23:01,604 --> 00:23:03,839
and every time he comes away
with something new.

511
00:23:03,873 --> 00:23:05,774
Maybe if I want answers
about this killer,

512
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:08,310
his work deserves
a second look.

513
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:10,411
Such aggressive, brutal cuts.

514
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,846
He butchered this body.

515
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,314
But that doesn't
make any sense.

516
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,149
Not when he was so meticulous

517
00:23:16,184 --> 00:23:19,052
about composing
his crime scenes.

518
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,155
The complexity of the stitching

519
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:22,890
in the belly
of that fruit vendor,

520
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:24,359
the attention to detail,

521

attaching plastic to flesh.

522
00:23:27,096 --> 00:23:30,199
So why would this same
fastidious craftsman

523
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:32,802
so carelessly hack and slash?

524
00:23:32,836 --> 00:23:34,571
Unless it's not
the same killer.

525
00:23:34,605 --> 00:23:36,540
You think one person
cut up the body

526
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:39,676
and another composed
the crime scene?

527
00:23:39,711 --> 00:23:44,180
Maybe we're not looking
for one Doomsday killer.

528
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,717
Maybe we're looking for two.

to, like, five people,

you could help me.

00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:54,407
Sam, what are you doing here?

720
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:57,343
I figured if I had a son
who was going through surgery,

721
00:31:57,377 --> 00:32:01,147
I'd probably want
some backup too, so.

722
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:02,515
Thanks.

723
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:04,417
Brother Sam?

724
00:32:04,452 --> 00:32:07,721
You came in
on the Omar Rivera case.

725
00:32:07,756 --> 00:32:12,260
Are you guys, like,
friends now?

726
00:32:12,294 --> 00:32:13,328
Uh.

727
00:32:13,362 --> 00:32:14,796
Yeah, well,
I have the auto shop.

728
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,332
We--yep.

729
00:32:17,366 --> 00:32:19,634
I'm gonna go to the cafeteria,

730
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:21,269
see if anything's edible.

731
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:22,871
Any takers?

732
00:32:22,905 --> 00:32:25,373
I'll browse.

733
00:32:29,845 --> 00:32:32,346
How you holding up?

734
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,614
Honestly, not good.

735
00:32:33,648 --> 00:32:36,049
I hate not knowing
if he's gonna be okay,

736
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,550
not being able to protect him.

737
00:32:37,585 --> 00:32:40,386
Sometimes you just...
got to surrender.

738
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:44,623
I'm sorry, man.

739
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:46,058
That--that probably
wasn't the...

740
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:48,894
- It's okay.
- Best thing to say.

741
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:52,264
No, it's...

742
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:53,699
If I was in your situation,

743
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,100
I would not want
to hear that shit.

744
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:57,135
I'm--

745
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,573
I used to not always
be like this.

746
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,510
People used to talk to me
about God.

747
00:33:04,544 --> 00:33:07,613
Man, used to make me
want to punch 'em in they face.

748
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:11,684
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

749
00:33:11,719 --> 00:33:13,186
[Sighs]

750
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:16,256
I used to believe
in something else.

751
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:20,761
What?

752
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:23,029
The same as you.
My dad.

753
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:28,467
Whatever.
That--that didn't work out.

754
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:30,802
What happened?

755
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:31,903
[Exhales]

756
00:33:31,938 --> 00:33:34,005
Hey, you got enough
on your mind, man.

757
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,673
You don't need to--

758
00:33:35,707 --> 00:33:37,542
want to hear no stories
about me and my dad.

759
00:33:37,576 --> 00:33:39,577
No, I appreciate a distraction.

760
00:33:44,417 --> 00:33:45,750
When I was growing up,

761
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:50,289
my dad was a real popular guy.

762
00:33:50,323 --> 00:33:53,659
Everybody knew him.

763
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:57,931
They used to
call him "mister."

764
00:33:57,965 --> 00:33:59,699
He was always working,

765
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:03,570
but I never really knew
what he did.

766
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:05,104
So one day I asked him.

767
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:06,706
I said,
"Daddy, what do you do?"

768
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,007
He looked at me and said,

769
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:10,109
"Whatever I want,
whenever I need."

770
00:34:10,143 --> 00:34:11,110
Like that.

771
00:34:11,144 --> 00:34:13,111
Hmm.

772
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:14,980
He said he was going to...

773
00:34:15,014 --> 00:34:18,082
see a friend of his.

774
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:20,852
So we get there.

775
00:34:20,886 --> 00:34:22,888
He says, uh,
"Now go on up there

776
00:34:22,922 --> 00:34:25,157
and ring that doorbell for me."

777
00:34:25,191 --> 00:34:28,461
So I do it.

778
00:34:28,495 --> 00:34:31,531
And this man comes to the door.

779
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:33,033
And he's staring at me,

780
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:37,104
not knowing who I am
or why I'm there.

781
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:40,107
And before I can turn around

782
00:34:40,141 --> 00:34:43,277
and say I'm with mister,

783
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:46,280
my dad is standing
right there behind me

784
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:49,316
with a pistol in his hand.

785
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,052
And he takes his pistol
and he points it at this man,

786
00:34:52,086 --> 00:34:53,720
and he shoots him in the face.

787
00:34:53,754 --> 00:34:58,425
Killed him.

788
00:34:58,459 --> 00:34:59,426
Blood everywhere.

789
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,961
[Sighs]

790
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:05,699
All on my Superman shirt.

791
00:35:05,733 --> 00:35:10,404
My dad just calmly picks me up,

792
00:35:10,438 --> 00:35:12,506
walks to the car,

793
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:15,543
drives off slowly.

794
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:19,915
And he says,
"You did a good job."

795
00:35:26,323 --> 00:35:27,823
He used you.

796
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:32,562
No surprise
I ended up in prison.

797
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:36,566
So what changed?

798
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:40,171
[Sighs]

799
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:42,873
Well,
when I first got locked up,

800
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,608
them first few months,

801
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,910
I was just...

802
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:49,113
mad.

803
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:53,717
And I just wanted
to hurt somebody, anybody.

804
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:57,721
And this new guy comes in.

805
00:35:57,756 --> 00:36:01,725
And he's just loud
and bragging,

806
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,160
and, "Yeah, yeah,
this, this, that."

807
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,895
I was this, this,
that in the street."

808
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,762
And so I'm just looking at him.

809
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:10,265
I'm thinking to myself,
"Okay, when I get a chance,

810
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,601
I'ma tune
this motherfucker up."

811
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:17,172
So we get yard time,

812
00:36:17,206 --> 00:36:19,874
and I'm following him.

813
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:23,912
And he goes into the chapel.

814
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:29,551
I sneak up on him,
and I start choking him out.

815
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:34,157
I'm trying to kill him.

816
00:36:34,191 --> 00:36:39,597
And then I see this light.

817
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,466
Like, figuratively, or--

818
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,670
No, no, like, for real.
Like, light.

819
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:51,375
Sunlight coming through
these chapel windows, and...

820
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,345
I could just see
everything around me.

821
00:36:55,379 --> 00:37:00,950
I could see where I was at
and what I was doing, and...

822
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:04,454
I didn't want to do it no more.

823
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:07,857
And you think that was God?

824
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,764
Dexter, all I know

825
00:37:14,798 --> 00:37:19,202
is that when I let
that man go...

826
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:24,875
I never felt that good
about nothing in my life.

827
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,747
[Breathes deeply]

828
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:31,116
I'm gonna grab some coffee.

829
00:37:31,151 --> 00:37:33,519
Yeah.

830
00:37:44,432 --> 00:37:46,901
[Machine whirring, struggling]

831
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:49,970
Come on.

832
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:52,139
Come on.

833
00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:58,012
Just let him be okay.

834
00:37:58,046 --> 00:38:00,615
Please let him be okay.

835
00:38:09,024 --> 00:38:10,424
I don't know how this works,

836
00:38:10,458 --> 00:38:12,493
but if there's something
I need to do in return,

837
00:38:12,527 --> 00:38:14,695
I'll do it.

838
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,267
Okay?

839
00:38:43,725 --> 00:38:46,627
You going out
with that woman, aren't you?

840
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:48,762
Her name is Erin.

841
00:38:48,797 --> 00:38:50,564
If you like, I could cancel.

842
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,566
I could stay here with you.

843
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:54,335
There's more work I could do.

844
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:58,773
No, we were given free will
for a reason, Travis.

845
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:05,212
You can do whatever you want...

846
00:39:05,247 --> 00:39:09,683
as long as you're willing to...

847
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:12,419
accept the consequences
God gives you.

848
00:39:19,258 --> 00:39:21,993
It's just dinner.

849
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,362
I'll be back home by 10:00.

850
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:33,237
Good night.

851
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:43,847
And your parents,
are you close?

852
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,716
Yes, we were.

853
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,919
They died when I was 14.
Car wreck.

854
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,221
I am so sorry.
That's terrible.

855
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:56,091
My sister pretty much
raised me after that.

856
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,660
Poor thing.

857
00:39:58,695 --> 00:40:01,296
You guys are really lucky
that you had each other.

858
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,006
I want you, Travis.

859
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,048
Travis.

860
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,851
[Moaning softly]

861
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:58,956
[Door opens]

862
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,591
Kid's a champ.

863
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,226
Made it through
with flying colors.

864
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,694
Oh, thank God.

865
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:05,162
I mean, uh, thank you.

866
00:41:05,196 --> 00:41:06,630
Thank you so much, doctor.

867
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:07,798
My pleasure.

868
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,566
Uh, they're taking him up
to recovery now.

869
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,634
You can see him
in a few minutes.

870
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,604
I knew he'd be okay.

871
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,638
I got to go.
Matthews wants to talk to me.

872
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:18,006
Probably about the conference.

873
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,342
I'm totally fucked.

874
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:23,011
Long day.
You should go home.

875
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:24,545
Are you sure?
I can hang.

876
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,414
No, go. I'll call you
if anything changes.

877
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:28,115
Okay.
Good night.

878
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,051
Night.

879
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:31,952
Thanks for staying.
You didn't have to.

880
00:41:31,987 --> 00:41:33,754
Not a problem.
I wanted to.

881
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:36,090
I'm glad little man
is all right.

882
00:41:36,124 --> 00:41:38,225
Yeah, me too.

883
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:40,961
I know.
"Thank God."

884
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:44,132
That's just an expression.

885
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:46,401
I know.
Just, uh...

886
00:41:46,435 --> 00:41:48,437
Another marvel
of modern science.

887
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:49,838
Yeah,
you put your faith in God,

888
00:41:49,872 --> 00:41:51,106
I put my faith in science.

889
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,441
It's cool.

890
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:54,376
We don't have to believe
in the same thing, but...

891
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,313
you got to keep an open mind.

892
00:41:58,348 --> 00:42:01,417
You may say I can't prove
that God exists,

893
00:42:01,451 --> 00:42:03,286
but, uh...

894
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,621
You can't prove he doesn't.

895
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:08,525
Hmm?

896
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,261
You take care, Dex.

897
00:42:25,511 --> 00:42:26,477
[Knocks]

898
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:28,112
Deputy chief?

899
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:31,015
Morgan.
Did you see the news?

900
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,916
I been getting calls
about it all night.

901
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:35,452
I did, sir. Let me just say
that I am truly, deeply--

902
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:38,054
Everybody loves my new
sparkplug of a lieutenant.

903
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:39,288
They do?

904
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,557
You're direct.
No bullshit.

905
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:43,392
Well, I was just trying
to get the community--

906
00:42:43,426 --> 00:42:46,229
You know, I took a big risk
when I promoted you, Morgan.

907
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:49,332
I took a lot of crap
from a lot of people.

908
00:42:49,367 --> 00:42:51,902
But today--

909
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:54,505
today, you've made me
very, very proud.

910
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:59,712
Your dad would
have been proud too.

911
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:04,651
Keep up the good fucking work.

912
00:43:04,685 --> 00:43:07,253
Thank you, sir.

913
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:12,893
Hey.

914
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:16,230
Which one of you characters
drives a Firebird?

915
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:19,367
Crockett or tubbs?

916
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:20,702
You park like a dick.

917
00:43:20,736 --> 00:43:24,372
[Laughter]

918
00:43:24,406 --> 00:43:25,940
You guys want
to go in my office,

919
00:43:25,974 --> 00:43:29,210
tell me what you've been up to?

920
00:43:29,244 --> 00:43:30,277
Well, we'll be right in.

921
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:31,945
I've been meaning to thank you

922
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,580
for that fashion advice.

923
00:43:33,615 --> 00:43:37,917
Really upped
my professional factor.

924
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:39,185
Jesus, Anderson.

925
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,787
You have something to say,
say it?

926
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:42,189
With all due respect,
lieutenant,

927
00:43:42,223 --> 00:43:44,191
you should probably
watch the language.

928
00:43:44,226 --> 00:43:45,927
Well, for your information,

929
00:43:45,961 --> 00:43:48,563
Matthews said people liked it.

930
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:53,135
[Clears throat]

931
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:55,404
We have a lead.

932
00:43:55,438 --> 00:43:58,140
We been speaking to this
preacher, Jeremiah Allen.

933
00:43:58,174 --> 00:44:00,809
Turns out he's obsessed
with this Revelation expert,

934
00:44:00,844 --> 00:44:01,810
James Gellar.

935
00:44:01,844 --> 00:44:02,877
The professor.

936
00:44:02,912 --> 00:44:04,346
From the University of Tallahassee?

937
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,847
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

938
00:44:08,117 --> 00:44:11,018
Found this on a Google search
for "revelation expert."

939
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:15,589
It's all about end times.

940
00:44:15,623 --> 00:44:17,658
Yeah.
Check this out.

941
00:44:17,692 --> 00:44:21,028
The posts end on the day
of our very first crime scene.

942
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:24,698
I can try and get
in touch with him, but--

943
00:44:24,733 --> 00:44:26,434
You--you can't
get in touch with him,

944
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:27,668
because he went underground.

945
00:44:27,702 --> 00:44:29,603
Underground.
Why?

946
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:32,273
Ah, now look
who's behind the curtain.

947
00:44:32,307 --> 00:44:34,076
I, uh, called the university.

948
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,511
Gellar disappeared three years
ago after he got fired.

949
00:44:36,546 --> 00:44:38,147
- Ask me why.
- Why?

950
00:44:38,181 --> 00:44:42,518
He got accused of stealing
an ancient sword.

951
00:44:42,553 --> 00:44:44,119
Like the one Masuka
thinks our killer

952
00:44:44,154 --> 00:44:45,354
could have used
in both murders?

953
00:44:45,389 --> 00:44:46,723
Just like that.

954
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:48,524
Oh, and get this.

955
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:51,227
This isn't just
any Roman sword.

956
00:44:51,261 --> 00:44:53,029
According to medieval legend,

957
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:56,666
this one belonged
to John the Revelator.

958
00:44:58,136 --> 00:45:01,004
The guy who actually
wrote <i>Revelation.</i>

959
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:02,840
Huh?

960
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:07,445
Looks like we just found our
number one person of interest.

961
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,447
Good job.

962
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:11,950
Thank you.

963
00:45:11,985 --> 00:45:15,388
[Seagulls calling]

964
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:27,700
[Muffled whimper]

965
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:29,701
You knew this was gonna happen.

966
00:45:30,703 --> 00:45:34,005
No. Please.
Let her go.

967
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,073
I like her.

968
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,540
You should have
thought about that

969
00:45:36,575 --> 00:45:39,643
before you defiled her.

970
00:45:39,677 --> 00:45:41,511
It's the best thing for her.

971
00:45:44,649 --> 00:45:47,784
She's part of God's plan now.

972
00:45:58,996 --> 00:46:02,298
Looks like your prayers
were answered.

973
00:46:02,333 --> 00:46:03,866
I was desperate.

974
00:46:03,901 --> 00:46:06,102
Hey, no judgment.

975
00:46:06,136 --> 00:46:08,437
You already talk
to an imaginary father figure.

976
00:46:08,472 --> 00:46:10,072
It didn't mean anything.

977
00:46:10,106 --> 00:46:12,141
Are you sure?

978
00:46:12,175 --> 00:46:16,511
Harrison's okay,
and you did make that pact.

979
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:21,783
Come on.

980
00:46:21,817 --> 00:46:23,485
You don't really think
there's someone out there

981
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:25,020
holding my I.O.U.

982
00:46:25,054 --> 00:46:27,189
I don't know.

983
00:46:27,223 --> 00:46:28,691
But if there is,
you'd better be ready

984
00:46:28,725 --> 00:46:32,362
to pay the piper.

985
00:46:32,396 --> 00:46:33,363
[Sighs]

986
00:46:33,397 --> 00:46:35,265
[Cell phone ringing]

987
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,234
[Phone beeps] Hey.

988
00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:39,936
Hey.
How's Harrison?

989
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:41,438
He's fine.
He's sleeping.

990
00:46:41,472 --> 00:46:43,106
Are you sure? 'Cause I
wouldn't want to bother you--

991
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,307
Deb, just tell me what's up.

992
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:47,110
Got a call to a crime scene
in Coral Gables.

993
00:46:47,144 --> 00:46:49,045
A gardner
at the botanical gardens

994
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,213
found an Alpha and an Omega
outside the greenhouse.

995
00:46:52,248 --> 00:46:53,815
You think it's Doomsday?

996
00:46:53,849 --> 00:46:55,783
Could be.
And we might have a suspect.

997
00:46:55,817 --> 00:46:57,484
A middle-aged professor.

998
00:46:57,518 --> 00:46:59,619
I'm not sure if I should leave.

999
00:46:59,654 --> 00:47:01,587
Dexter. Sorry.

1000
00:47:01,622 --> 00:47:03,156
I didn't mean
to eavesdrop or anything,

1001
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:05,158
but if that's work,
you should go.

1002
00:47:05,192 --> 00:47:07,260
- But Harrison--
- Harrison is sound asleep.

1003
00:47:07,294 --> 00:47:09,529
Between the pain killers
and the sedatives they gave him,

1004
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:11,831
you can probably get there and
back before he even wakes up.

1005
00:47:11,866 --> 00:47:14,234
Dex, at the risk of sounding
like the world's worst aunt,

1006
00:47:14,268 --> 00:47:16,135
I could really use you on this.

1007
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,572
There's blood.

1008
00:47:18,606 --> 00:47:19,773
I'll be there.
[Phone beeps]

1009
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,974
Call me the minute he wakes up.

1010
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:23,009
I will.

1011
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:28,915
I was drawn to science
out of curiosity.

1012
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:32,719
Any questions I had,
the answers were already there.

1013
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:36,890
But even science
is never certain.

1014
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:38,725
Even the soundest of theories

1015
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:40,460
is subject to new data.

1016
00:47:40,494 --> 00:47:44,330
And there are some things
even science can't explain.

1017
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:46,098
Brother Sam would say
it's not an accident

1018
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,600
that I've stumbled
onto a killer

1019
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:50,203
who seems to have
his own kind of faith.

1020
00:47:50,237 --> 00:47:52,105
And while I don't believe
in an unseen hand

1021
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:54,608
creating his own tableau,

1022
00:47:54,642 --> 00:47:58,044
I do believe
I don't have all the answers.

1023
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,679
Dex, thanks for coming.

1024
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:00,681
What do we got?

1025
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:04,117
Blood.
And fuckin' fish.

1026
00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:15,830
Catch of the day.

1027
00:48:19,736 --> 00:48:21,637
It didn't get here on its own.

1028
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:24,038
So where did it come from?

1029
00:48:32,914 --> 00:48:36,082
Dex, where are you going?

1030
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:38,117

Deb, wait!

1042
00:49:28,734 --> 00:49:30,135
Could be another trap.

Oh, God.
We have to help her.

1044

1045

She's already gone.

Oh, shit, shit,

It's official.

He's a serial killer.

Wait, wait, wait, wait,
everybody.

I'm not looking at Debra's

1056
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:48,248
Is this Doomsday number two?

1057
00:50:52,688 --> 00:50:54,689
But that's not the look
of a murderer.

1058

That's the look of a man
with true faith.

1059

I've seen it before
on Brother Sam.
