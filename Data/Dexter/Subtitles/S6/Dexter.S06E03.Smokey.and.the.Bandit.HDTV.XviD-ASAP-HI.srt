were obsessed

182
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:12,816
with their favorite
baseball players.

183
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:14,919
You tried serial killers.

184
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:18,289
Only certain ones.

185
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:21,125
The Tooth Fairy was smart...

186
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,261
and arrogant.

187
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,329
They never caught him,
even when he left a body

188
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:27,631
on a deputy sheriff's lawn.

189
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:33,304
15 women--prostitutes--
all dumped on the roadside,

190
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:35,939
all missing
their lateral incisors.

191
00:10:35,973 --> 00:10:36,974
You really think there's
a connection

192
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,776
to the victim
from this morning?

193
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,677
Her lateral incisor was cracked

194
00:10:40,711 --> 00:10:43,146
like someone tried
to rip it out with pliers.

195
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,216
There was damage to her gums.

196
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,251
Probably a result
of the beating,

197
00:10:48,285 --> 00:10:50,653
like Masuka said.

198
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:54,191
Maybe someone was trying
to relive old times?

199
00:10:54,225 --> 00:10:57,495
The Tooth Fairy killings
were in the '80s, Dexter.

200
00:10:57,529 --> 00:10:59,697
He'd be 70 years old at least.

201
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:03,168
What would he be doing
in Miami?

202
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:06,272
Why do most 70 year olds
come to Miami?

203
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:20,385
They say old age is like
a second childhood.

204
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:25,057
There are primary colors...

205
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:30,162
tricycles...

206
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:33,933
and ball chasing.

207
00:11:33,967 --> 00:11:36,502
I barely made it through
my first childhood.

208
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:39,372
[Snoring]

209
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:44,176
I guess no one makes it
through the second.

210
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:46,678
This place is one block from
where the victim was found.

211
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:50,148
A short walk for a retiree
on a mission.

212
00:11:54,453 --> 00:11:56,288
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

213
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:59,058
I'm, uh, thinking about moving
my dad down here.

214
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:02,228
He's 81, but still sprightly.

215
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,630
Bless his heart.

216
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,565
Coral Island's
a great facility.

217
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,634
I'm happy to answer any
questions you have.

218
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:10,470
Do you have any other
residents here from Oregon?

219
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:13,540
My dad's kind of shy and it'd be
nice to have people around

220
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:16,509
with something in common,
besides hearing loss.

221
00:12:16,544 --> 00:12:19,779
Well, let's see.

222
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:22,349
[Typing]

223
00:12:22,383 --> 00:12:24,218
We have three residents
form Oregon.

224
00:12:24,252 --> 00:12:25,886
Fine people.

225
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,888
I'm sure your dad will get along
with them famously.

226
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,289
That's good to hear.

227
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,691
Here are some brochures
with everything

228
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:32,892
you need to know about
Coral Island.

229
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,294
There's some forms to fill out
in case you're interested

230
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,762
in having your dad join us.

231
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,765
Thanks.

232
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,700
Hey, I hate to trouble you,

233
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:43,202
but that coffee
really looks good.

234
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:44,436
I was gonna get some earlier.

235
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,704
I feel a caffeine headache
coming on.

236
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:48,272
I know what that's like.

237
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:49,306
I'll fetch you a mug.

238
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:50,474
Be right back.

239
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,543
I appreciate it.

240
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:05,288
One woman...
Another in a wheelchair.

241
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:07,390
That leaves...

242
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:08,658
Walter Kenney.

243
00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:11,628
Moved here from Grants Pass,
Oregon, five years ago.

244
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:15,599
How are you spending
your second childhood?

245
00:13:19,771 --> 00:13:21,272
What's that?

246
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:22,840
Oh, you've been doing
such a good job,

247
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:25,843
I put together a little surprise
for your viewing pleasure.

248
00:13:25,878 --> 00:13:27,579
Is this what I think it is?

249
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,815
Evidence from the Ice Truck
Killer investigation.

250
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:32,451
You said in class how
you were really into this case.

251
00:13:32,485 --> 00:13:33,952
Are you kidding?

252
00:13:33,986 --> 00:13:35,854
I was obsessed with this case.

253
00:13:35,888 --> 00:13:38,223
I have followed it
night and day.

254
00:13:38,257 --> 00:13:39,457
This is really sweet.

255
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,999
This is the Ice Truck Killer's
hospital I.D.

256
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:54,371
And the holy of holies.

257
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:57,373
Oh, wow.

258
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,846
Whoa.

259
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,715
You know...

260
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:08,750
When the details of this case
were made public,

261
00:14:08,784 --> 00:14:11,886
I painted my nails like this
for a whole week.

262
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,154
Is that just wrong?

263
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:15,889
Is it wrong
that it makes me hot?

264
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:18,392
[Both giggle]

265
00:14:18,426 --> 00:14:21,295
Uh...what do they do
with all this stuff?

266
00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:24,565
It just sits here
in evidence...forever.

267
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,534
That's a shame.

268
00:14:26,568 --> 00:14:28,436
I mean, this is a piece
of history.

269
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:35,010
It's time for the briefing.

270
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:36,678
[Elevator bell rings]

271
00:14:36,713 --> 00:14:38,914
Oh, there you are.

272
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:41,684
I've sat through God knows
how many briefings.

273
00:14:41,718 --> 00:14:43,219
Why am I so fucking nervous?

274
00:14:43,254 --> 00:14:44,554
Because everyone will be
looking to see

275
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:46,122
if you know what you're doing.

276
00:14:46,156 --> 00:14:47,424
Do me a favor.

277
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,525
When you get back to your desk,

278
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,193
look up the word "rhetorical."

279
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:52,529
You'll be fine, Deb.

280
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:53,897
Okay, everyone,
we've got a lot to cover,

281
00:14:53,931 --> 00:14:55,965
so let's get started.

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,110
First up is the homicide
on Euclid.

283
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,102
Where are we on identifying
the victim?

284
00:15:00,136 --> 00:15:01,903
Her fingerprints
gave us a name.

285
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:03,705
Rosalia Davolos.

286
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:06,074
Several priors
for solicitation.

287
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,708
We talked to a local merchant.

288
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:09,610
It seems that strip
was practically her office.

289
00:15:09,644 --> 00:15:10,644
Did we run her cell phone?

290
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,145
That turned up
a long list of numbers.

291
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,714
Mostly johns.

292
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,049
Uh, we're working through
the names now.

293
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,584
What about a tox screen?

294
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:20,154
Trace amounts of cocaine
in her system and...

295
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:21,822
doughnuts.

296
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:23,157
[Laughter]

297
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:25,326
Let's, uh, check the area
for known pushers.

298
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,194
Maybe she got caught up
in a bad deal

299
00:15:27,229 --> 00:15:28,829
or she got behind on a payment.

300
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:31,098
I'm hoping five
or six people will volunteer--

301
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:32,933
They'll never tie this
to a quarter-century-old

302
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:35,669
serial killer case from Oregon.

303
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:38,905
Not sure I have either,
but I can dream.

304
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,341
That takes us
to the snakes killing.

305
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,177
It's looking like this wasn't
a drug cartel hit after all.

306
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:45,445
As much as I hate to admit it,

307
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,247
maybe Brother Sam was right
about our victim.

308
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:49,883
Maybe he cleaned up his act.

309
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,451
That doesn't mean there wasn't
someone out there

310
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:53,487
looking to settle an old score.

311
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:55,623
What if we made some of
the details of the case public,

312
00:15:55,657 --> 00:15:56,924
like the snakes?

313
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:02,864
Might scare up a lead.

314
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:04,024
Uh, no.

315
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:06,527
That may compromise the case
when it goes to court.

316
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:10,039
If we don't catch anyone,
this will never go to court.

317
00:16:10,074 --> 00:16:13,442
I think detective Quinn
has a point.

318
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:16,646
We let word out about
the snakes.

319
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,514
The press will eat it up.
Who knows?

320
00:16:18,548 --> 00:16:20,616
Maybe something
will shake loose.

321
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:23,219
What about the trial?

322
00:16:23,253 --> 00:16:24,653
Well, Quinn's right.

323
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:25,721
There'll never be a trial

324
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:27,356
unless we get someone
into custody.

325
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,691
I think it's worth a try.

326
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:31,394
Angel, get started
on the statement.

327
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,797
Have it on my desk
by this afternoon.

328
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:44,309
I don't think you
really believe

329
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:45,844
what you are saying, Nathan!

330
00:16:45,878 --> 00:16:48,046
You need to believe
what you are saying!

331
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:49,347
I do.
I swear.

332
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:52,751
I just--I don't know what it is
you want from me.

333
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:56,921
I want to hear you tell God
that you are sorry.

334
00:16:56,956 --> 00:16:58,256
Okay.
Okay.

335
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,092
Please, please, God...

336
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:05,129
I'm sorry for--for--
for everything I've ever done.

337
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:07,365
Just forgive me.

338
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:09,700
Forgive me.

339
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:12,937
For...give me.

340
00:17:12,971 --> 00:17:14,972
[Sobbing]

341
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,546
No, no.
Wait. Wait.

342
00:17:22,581 --> 00:17:24,515
Where are you going?
Let me go!

343
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,850
Let me go!

344
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:27,885
[Sniffling]

345
00:17:37,062 --> 00:17:40,097
He's telling you what you
want to hear.

346
00:17:40,131 --> 00:17:44,534
He thinks we're gonna
release him.

347
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:56,313
How much longer do we
have to make him suffer?

348
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:59,784
You really have a good heart,
Travis.

349
00:17:59,818 --> 00:18:04,223
That's why I picked you.

350
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:07,193
But there's much more
at stake here

351
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:10,764
than one man's suffering.

352
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,801
Don't we have to be strong?

353
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:19,005
He has to be pure
or we can't proceed.

354
00:18:21,107 --> 00:18:22,074
Yes.

355
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:25,109
Hey, he's coming around.

356
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:28,379
It just takes time.

357
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,024
Good morning, Walter.

358
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:44,094
Keep saying that and one day
you might be right.

359
00:18:44,128 --> 00:18:46,196
Sam's group is about
to tee off.

360
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:49,566
You can join them.

361
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:51,235
Hey, I'm short a partner.

362
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:52,669
Dan.

363
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:55,339
Walter Kenney.

364
00:18:55,373 --> 00:18:57,208
I'm a little rusty,

365
00:18:57,242 --> 00:18:58,776
but I'll try
not to slow you down.

366
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,012
Just get a cart, will you?

367
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,320
Worst mistake I ever made
was moving down

368
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:12,624
to this piss-butt
corner country.

369
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:15,027
How bad can it be?
It's the Sunshine State.

370
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:19,198
Only sunshine around here is
what they blow up your ass.

371
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:22,668
The rest is mosquitoes,
humidity,

372
00:19:22,702 --> 00:19:23,869
and people that don't
speak English.

373
00:19:23,903 --> 00:19:26,304
[Fly buzzing]

374
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,640
So what's a young guy like you

375
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:30,608
doing around Coral Island,

376
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:34,179
or do you get off hanging out
with corpses?

377
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:35,616
[Chuckles]

378
00:19:35,736 --> 00:19:37,505
I'm checking it out for my dad.

379
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,195
You want to help your dad?

380
00:19:39,229 --> 00:19:40,963
Take him to the end of the pier
and push him off.

381
00:19:40,998 --> 00:19:43,466
You'll be doing him a favor.

382
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,435
If I was any more in the rough,

383
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,303
I'd need a fucking machete.

384
00:19:47,338 --> 00:19:51,607
This is like being trapped
in a toxic cloud...

385
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:54,143
that cheats.

386
00:19:58,315 --> 00:20:00,649
Oh!
Son of a bitch!

387
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,050
You okay?

388
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,951
Oh, I always scream in pain
when I take a swing.

389
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:06,053
Don't just stand there.

390
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:07,387
I need to sit down.

391
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:09,122
All right.

392
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:11,958
Oh, I ruptured my back
two years ago.

393
00:20:11,993 --> 00:20:13,393
It hasn't been the same since.

394
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,328
Okay, just take it easy.

395
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:16,630
Jesus fucking Christ!

396
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:18,833
Listen, I'm done here.

397
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:22,002
Just drop me off
at the club bar.

398
00:20:22,036 --> 00:20:23,304
I need something
to kill the pain.

399
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:26,273
You got it.

400
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,509
[Grunts]

401
00:20:32,447 --> 00:20:36,150
So what'd you used to do
up in Oregon?

402
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:39,487
I was a pipefitter
for 25 years.

403
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:43,090
Shit job, but I managed
to work up a pension.

404
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,460
All I want to do now
is play golf.

405
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,062
Mmm.

406
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:49,498
Maybe you should find something
else to pass the time.

407
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:53,636
I tell you, it's hell not
being able to do what you love.

408
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,838
Is he talking about golf
or his failure

409
00:20:55,872 --> 00:21:00,209
to rip out Rosalia Davolos'
tooth?

410
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:02,545
Walter Kenney may be
the world's oldest asshole,

411
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,648
but that doesn't make him
a killer.

412
00:21:04,682 --> 00:21:07,651
On the other hand,
maybe I gave up too soon.

413
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:14,490
He wears a dental implant
for the lateral incisor.

414
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,525
The same one the Tooth Fairy
pulled from his victims.

415
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,662
[Cell phone rings]

416
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,798
Excuse me.

417
00:21:22,832 --> 00:21:24,065
Hello?

418
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,300
This is Sam from
Good Shepherd Auto.

419
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,235
I was just calling to
let you know your car's ready.

420
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,737
Great.
When can I pick it up?

421
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:31,472
Well, if you get here
before 6:00,

422
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:34,109
you won't have to fight
the dog off this time.

423
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:35,177
[Chuckles]

424
00:21:35,211 --> 00:21:36,912
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.

425
00:21:36,946 --> 00:21:38,481
[Phone beeps]

426
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,627
This is on me.

427
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:51,596
I got to go pick up my car.

428
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,197
Well, you know,
I've got a shit-load of errands

429
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:55,166
to run tomorrow and
with my back the way it is,

430
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,601
I'm gonna have
a real hard time on the bus.

431
00:21:57,635 --> 00:21:59,402
You wouldn't want to give me
a ride, would you?

432
00:21:59,437 --> 00:22:00,937
Perfect, now I won't have
to make an excuse

433
00:22:00,972 --> 00:22:02,271
to run into you again.

434
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:04,039
I'm in 72.

435
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:05,474
Pick me up at 9:00.

436
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:07,275
Actually, I'd rather
have my teeth pulled.

437
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,376
Happy to do it.

438
00:22:30,335 --> 00:22:34,071
People don't put no oil in it
and then wonder why they--

439
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,439
Hey.

440
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:36,973
Hey, man, yeah.
She's right down here.

441
00:22:37,008 --> 00:22:38,275
I'll be right back, Nick.

442

443
00:22:40,077 --> 00:22:41,144
Hey, God bless him.

444
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:43,313
Nick has been busting his ass,
man.

445
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:46,182
Off the drugs.
Cut his ties with the gang, man.

446
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:49,285
I--I really think he wants
to change.

447
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,686
You must be relieved.

448
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,955
I'm proud of him is what
I am, man.

449
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,857
It's not easy turning your
life around, man.

450
00:22:54,892 --> 00:22:56,326
It could go south
at any minute,

451
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,096
but I'll take the blessings
as they come.

452
00:23:00,131 --> 00:23:01,598
This looks like the day
I bought it.

453
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,832

repair jobs

Listen.

458
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:12,910
You got any plans this Sunday?

459
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:15,311
Like service?

be getting serviced?

462
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:19,815
Uh, like a church service.

463
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:22,585
No.
Not much of a churchgoer.

464
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,654
Yeah, I figured that.

465

Well, we having something
like a company get together,

466
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:28,591
like a beach party.

It'd be great
if you could come.

468

Well, this Sunday's tough.

00:23:31,428 --> 00:23:33,129

for Harrison.

put the grill on,

476
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:48,845
have a little beach
barbecue baptism.

477
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,782
- Baptism?
- Yeah. Nick.

478
00:23:51,816 --> 00:23:53,684
He's taking the big leap,
praise God.

479

He's taking the holy spirit
on right there

of the Biscayne Bay.

Sounds like you're trying
to get me to go to church.

482
00:23:59,425 --> 00:24:01,059
So what?

483
00:24:01,093 --> 00:24:04,329
What, you afraid you
gonna catch something?

484
00:24:04,364 --> 00:24:07,299
I'm just not sure I fit in.

485
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:08,768
Sure you do.

Listen.

487
00:24:10,838 --> 00:24:13,072
I just think it'd be great
for you

488
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:15,708
to take a stand with someone
whose life

489
00:24:15,742 --> 00:24:17,944
that you helped turn around.

490
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:21,081
And if you do happen
to find God,

491
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:22,883
a lot worse ways you could
spend your day off.

492

Only one mention
of Walter Kenney

and he's identified as a victim.

I have to vent or my head's
gonna explode.

- What's wrong?
- Everything.

499
00:24:52,914 --> 00:24:54,281
I'm my ex-boyfriend's boss.

500

I don't know how to act.

501
00:24:56,184 --> 00:24:58,653
I don't know what to do.
I don't know who to hire.

502
00:24:58,687 --> 00:25:00,988
I have a stack of paperwork
on my desk

503
00:25:01,022 --> 00:25:02,122
that's taller than I am.

504
00:25:02,157 --> 00:25:03,658
Well, take a breath, sit down.

505
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:07,128
I think I really fucked up
taking this promotion.

506
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,798
I was a fucking great detective

507
00:25:09,833 --> 00:25:13,402
who loved her fucking job.

508
00:25:13,437 --> 00:25:15,905
I traded it all in for politics

509

and paperwork and Laguerta
up my ass.

510
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:19,409
Deb, you're too smart to think

511
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:20,844
that this was gonna be easy.

512
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:22,012
Well, I didn't expect this.

513
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:23,514
I didn't expect people
sitting around

514
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:24,816
waiting for me to fall
on my face.

515
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,918
- No one wants you to fail.
- [Scoffs]

516
00:25:26,952 --> 00:25:29,054
Okay, Laguerta probably
wouldn't lose any sleep

517
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,155
if you stumbled a bit.

518
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:31,589
She'd pop a bottle
of champagne.

519
00:25:31,624 --> 00:25:32,991
But guess what.
You're new at the job.

520
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:35,160
You're gonna stumble.

521
00:25:35,194 --> 00:25:36,428
You think Laguerta
never messed up?

522
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:37,729
Shit yeah.

523
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:40,265
Cut yourself some slack.

524
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:41,699
You've been lieutenant one day.

525
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,601
If a couple months go by,
you still hate it,

526
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:45,670
you can demote yourself,
but until then,

527
00:25:45,704 --> 00:25:47,138
just go with your gut.

528
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,205
And when you screw up,

529
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,251
just don't take me down with you.
I need the paycheck.

530

Okay.

My panic needle's swinging out
of the red.

532
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:57,248
Good.

533
00:25:57,283 --> 00:26:00,885
How are you
with the Quinn of it?

534
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,554
I miss being with him.

535
00:26:02,588 --> 00:26:04,923
Really?

536
00:26:04,957 --> 00:26:06,524
Quinn's a good guy.
We had fun together.

537
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,927
It was easy.
No expectations.

538
00:26:08,961 --> 00:26:11,230
That's one decision
I know I made right.

539
00:26:11,264 --> 00:26:14,466
Quinn and I were never meant
to get serious.

540
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:15,834
I have to go.

541
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,870
I have to put people
on the snakes killing.

542
00:26:17,904 --> 00:26:19,838
Thank you for talking me
off the ledge.

543
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:21,239
You're the best.

544
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,275
Is it a good time for me
to ask for a raise?

545
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:26,178
- Terrible.
- I'm serious.

546
00:26:26,212 --> 00:26:28,847
Fuck off and die.

547
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:34,520
Maybe she shouldn't have
taken the promotion.

548
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,255
She might not be cut out
for it.

549
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:38,924
I think there's very little
Deb's not cut out for.

was taken into custody

552

for repeatedly hitting her son
in the face in public.

553
00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:50,569
I'm not seeing the connection.

554
00:26:50,604 --> 00:26:52,138
Maybe that's how he
lost his tooth.

555
00:26:52,172 --> 00:26:54,807
So Walter Kenney
has mother issues.

556
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,208
Sounds familiar.

557
00:26:56,243 --> 00:26:58,410
Doesn't mean that he is
the Tooth Fairy.

558
00:26:58,445 --> 00:26:59,846
Ah, but it's another reason
for me

559
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,516

with Mister Sunshine.

a couple of seconds.

This wasn't on
the Coral Island brochure.

565
00:28:11,715 --> 00:28:15,318
My son.

566
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:17,687
Gave him everything in life

567
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:20,690
and now I can't get him
on the phone.

568
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:23,959

and then they vanish.

573
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:37,271
He's completely alone.

574
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:42,410
Alienated everyone around him.

Here's my prescription.

will you?

Oh, hey, hey, hey!

590
00:29:36,462 --> 00:29:38,530
And a six-pack of beer
from the liquor store

591

inspired me to keep a scrapbook?

is on life support.

I'm out of your hair.

got a little bad in you.

00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,609
Just stay where you are.

713
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:00,644
I'll be there in ten minutes.

714
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:02,347
He made it easy for me
to vet him.

715
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:04,516
Now he's making it easy
for me to kill him.

716
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,653
Kenney's a monster,
but at least he's considerate.

717
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:23,899
I don't know what
the fuck's wrong with me.

718
00:38:23,933 --> 00:38:26,668
Sometimes I get so confused.

719
00:38:26,702 --> 00:38:27,936
Yeah, don't worry about it.

720
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,971
I'm just glad I was
in the neighborhood.

721
00:38:30,005 --> 00:38:31,806
I don't know what
I would have done

722
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,009
if you hadn't answered.

723
00:38:35,043 --> 00:38:36,944
You're a good kid.

724
00:38:36,978 --> 00:38:38,779
As if I wasn't starting
to feel enough pity for him,

725
00:38:38,813 --> 00:38:40,213
now he's throwing gratitude
at me?

726
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:41,214
[Gun clicks]

727
00:38:41,249 --> 00:38:43,751
Keep your eye on the road...

728
00:38:43,786 --> 00:38:46,854
or I'll blow your head
out the window.

729
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,890
Drive until I tell you to turn.

730
00:38:48,924 --> 00:38:50,658
How did you get on to me?

731
00:38:50,692 --> 00:38:52,059
I don't know what
you're talking about.

732
00:38:52,093 --> 00:38:54,695
You're Miami Metro, Dexter.

733
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:56,830
I checked your car registration

734
00:38:56,864 --> 00:38:59,199
when you were filling
my prescription,

735
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:01,168
and then I "goggled" your name.

736
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:03,870
Yeah, that's right, dickwad.

737
00:39:03,904 --> 00:39:06,372
Maybe I haven't taken a decent
shit in ten years,

738
00:39:06,406 --> 00:39:10,042
but I'm not fucking stupid.

739
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:13,179
Turn right at the next light.

740
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:17,417
Okay.

741
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:21,322
Where are we going?

742
00:39:21,356 --> 00:39:23,023
To settle our business.

743
00:39:23,058 --> 00:39:26,661
And you're gonna tell me
how you figured out who I am.

744
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:28,096
And then you're gonna kill me?

745
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:31,399
You haven't left me much
choice, have you?

746
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:34,001
Left into the next parking lot.

747
00:39:34,035 --> 00:39:37,705
Okay.

748
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:39,140
Just for kicks,

749
00:39:39,174 --> 00:39:43,878
I might rip out all your teeth
before I shoot you.

750
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:45,846
[Engine revs]
What the fuck are you--

751
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,514
[Screams]

752
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:50,517
[Gunshot]

753
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:56,558
[Centrifuge whirring]

754
00:39:56,592 --> 00:39:59,561
Uh, those are, uh,
ready for cataloging.

755
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:02,063
Hey, um, after work tonight,
you want to grab some pho?

756
00:40:02,098 --> 00:40:04,266
Grab some what?

757
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,600
Uh, it's Vietnamese food.

758
00:40:05,635 --> 00:40:08,237
It's basically a large bowl
of noodles.

759
00:40:08,271 --> 00:40:10,005
And broth.

760
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,008
So you're asking me out?

761
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,309
As in a date?

762
00:40:13,343 --> 00:40:14,376
Well, you don't have
to call it that

763
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,378
if you don't want to.

764
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:18,180
I want to.

765
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,382
So that's a yes?

766
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:21,284
Yeah.

767
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,253
[Exhales] Wow.

768
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,688
What?

769
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,490
It's just that I ran
the conversation

770
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,792
through my mind
and bunch of times.

771
00:40:28,826 --> 00:40:31,928
It always ended in rejection
and bodily harm.

772
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:34,497
You should be more confident.

773
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,266
You know, in the right light,
you're actually kind of cute.

774
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,669
[Chuckles]

775
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,938
I'm about to interview
my top pick

776
00:40:40,973 --> 00:40:42,540
for the detective slot.

777
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:43,875
I thought you might
want to sit in.

778
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,244
Oh, no point.

779
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,345
Sam Harmon and I go way back.

780
00:40:46,379 --> 00:40:48,180
Harmon's not my top choice.

781
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:49,515
He's not?

782
00:40:49,549 --> 00:40:52,251
It's Mike Anderson,
the transfer from Chicago.

783
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:54,019
He's got ten years on Homicide,

784
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,421
a ridiculous solve rate,

785
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:57,856
recommendations coming
out of his ass.

786
00:40:57,891 --> 00:40:58,990
We'd be lucky to have him.

787
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,792
I really put a lot
of thought into this.

788
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:02,660
If that's true,
then I'm seriously

789
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:03,962
worried about your judgment,

790
00:41:03,996 --> 00:41:05,797
because this is a huge mistake.

791
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:08,033
I don't think it is.

792
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,700
Look, I know I'm new
at this job.

793
00:41:09,735 --> 00:41:11,602
And it's not that I don't
value your advice,

794
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:14,505
but sometimes I have
to trust my gut,

795
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,841
and right now my gut
is telling me Mike Anderson.

796
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:20,044
It's your decision, lieutenant.

797
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,280
You can do whatever
the hell you want.

798
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,282
But understand this.
You're on your own.

799
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:26,918
If this doesn't work out,

800
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,986
don't look to me
to have your back.

801
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,225
[Elevator bell rings]

802
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:39,264
[Overlapping chatter]

803
00:41:42,703 --> 00:41:44,470
Mike Anderson.

804
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:45,738
I'm here to see the lieutenant.

805
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:47,507
That's me.
It's great to meet you.

806
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,075
Debra Morgan.

807
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:51,210
[Chuckles]

808
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:53,712
- What's funny?
- You...The lieutenant.

809
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:55,247
- That a problem?
- Listen.

810
00:41:55,281 --> 00:41:56,581
I just got off
a three-hour flight

811
00:41:56,616 --> 00:41:57,983
and I'm really tired,

812
00:41:58,017 --> 00:41:59,484
which means I'm not in the mood

813
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:01,085
for any cute department
razzing.

814
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,554
So will you take me to your
boss, please?

815
00:42:03,588 --> 00:42:06,389
Maybe score me some coffee
on the way, no cream.

816
00:42:09,594 --> 00:42:10,894
You listen.

817
00:42:10,928 --> 00:42:13,197
Right now, you're my top choice
for this job,

818
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:16,067
but that can change
real fucking fast.

819
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:19,237
I put my ass on the line
even considering you,

820
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:21,206
so stow the attitude,

821
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,774
or the only job you're gonna
find in this city

822
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:25,778
is guarding a landfill
as a rent-a-cop.

823
00:42:25,812 --> 00:42:27,113
Look, I apologize.

824
00:42:27,147 --> 00:42:29,315
I didn't mean any disrespect.

825
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,951
It's just the other lieutenants
I've served under had, um--

826
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,753
Dicks?

827
00:42:33,787 --> 00:42:35,655
Been around the block.

828
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:36,889
Trust me.

829
00:42:36,924 --> 00:42:39,625
This is just as weird for me
as it is for you.

830
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:41,860
Moving on.

831
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:44,395
Let's talk.

832
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:52,169
You know, I just
got my car out of the shop.

833
00:42:52,204 --> 00:42:54,138
What the hell is this?

834
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:57,608
This is the end, Walter.

835
00:42:57,642 --> 00:43:00,044
You pulled your last tooth.

836
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,046
How did I get here?

837
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:03,147
Service entrance.

838
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:05,951
I think I tweaked my back.

839
00:43:05,985 --> 00:43:08,520
Fuck me.

840
00:43:08,555 --> 00:43:10,322
You could have spent your
final days relaxing,

841
00:43:10,357 --> 00:43:15,393
enjoying life, but then
there was Rosalia Davolos.

842
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:17,229
She's the first one
in ten years.

843
00:43:17,263 --> 00:43:20,332
Wasn't she?
Why now?

844
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:23,835
I got tired of staring
at a box of teeth.

845
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,970
Took me ten minutes
to kill the whore.

846
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:29,974
Lost another 20 trying
to pull the goddamn tooth.

847
00:43:34,814 --> 00:43:36,848
You know,
when I was in high school,

848
00:43:36,882 --> 00:43:39,952
it seemed you were all
the country was talking about.

849
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:41,220
The Tooth Fairy.

850
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:42,989
Too clever for the police.

851
00:43:43,023 --> 00:43:44,490
They couldn't catch you.

852
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:47,828
Like Burt Reynolds
with his Trans-Am.

853
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:50,330
I still can't believe you
are the same man

854
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:52,900
that dumped a body at
a deputy sheriff's house.

855
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,534
[Laughs]

856
00:43:54,568 --> 00:43:57,203
Total fucking accident.

857
00:43:57,237 --> 00:43:59,272
- I downed a few too many...
- [Sighs]

858
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:01,607
And didn't feel like driving
out to the highway

859
00:44:01,642 --> 00:44:03,376
to get rid of the bitch.

860
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,977
That's disappointing.

861
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:08,180
Well, I'm very fucking sorry
to let you down.

862
00:44:08,214 --> 00:44:10,349
Does that mean you
don't want my autograph?

863
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:11,583
No.

864
00:44:11,617 --> 00:44:16,388
Just...this.

865
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:18,023
I--I took teeth.

866
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:19,491
You take blood.

867
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:22,261
You're the same kind
of sick fuck, aren't you?

868
00:44:22,295 --> 00:44:24,196
At least I'm never gonna
end up like you.

869
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:25,564
Oh, yeah?

870
00:44:25,598 --> 00:44:29,568
When you can't do this anymore,
what do you have then?

871
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:30,636
More.

872
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,805
You're kidding yourself,
asshole.

873
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:35,141
All I ever cared about
was killing,

874
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:37,076
and I can't even
do that right anymore.

875
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,445
That's what you've got
to look forward to.

876
00:44:39,479 --> 00:44:44,150
This is your future and it
includes adult fucking diapers!

877
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:45,584
You are not my future.

878
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,421
I will not spend my
final days getting drunk

879
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:50,689
and staring at
a box of trophies.

880
00:44:50,724 --> 00:44:53,859
Keep telling yourself that.

881
00:44:53,893 --> 00:44:56,528
Make sure they know who I am.

882
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:57,796
I wish I could see the look

883
00:44:57,831 --> 00:44:59,998
on my son's face
when he finds out.

884
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:03,902
He won't be able
to ignore that!

885
00:45:06,006 --> 00:45:08,774
I never want my son
to know who I was.

886
00:45:08,808 --> 00:45:11,878
You said you didn't have a kid.

887
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:14,881
I also said my name
was "Dan."

888
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,419
What are you doing?

889
00:45:19,453 --> 00:45:21,588
You're not gonna die
as the Tooth Fairy.

890
00:45:21,622 --> 00:45:23,757
You're gonna die as a sad,
old man...

891
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:24,958
of a heart attack.

892
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:26,160
No!

893
00:45:26,194 --> 00:45:27,494
[Muffled screams]

894
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:29,863
The latest resident
to check out

895
00:45:29,898 --> 00:45:32,800
of the Coral Island
retirement village.

896
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,301
[Muffled grunt]

897
00:45:49,817 --> 00:45:51,417
Walter Kenney's son
will never know

898
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:54,154
his father was a monster.

899
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:56,223
Or at least not a killer.

900
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:10,039
[Ambulance radio chatter]

901
00:46:13,777 --> 00:46:17,279
We all want life to have some
kind of meaning.

902
00:46:26,322 --> 00:46:29,090
Seems like the older we get,
the harder we look for it...

903
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:31,125
[Engine revs]

904
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:40,836
[Heavy moaning]

905
00:46:44,608 --> 00:46:48,312
And the harder it is to find.

906
00:46:58,255 --> 00:47:03,492
And some of us just look
in the wrong place.

907
00:47:12,102 --> 00:47:16,439
But if our lives
don't have meaning...

908
00:47:16,473 --> 00:47:18,707
Horsey, daddy.

909
00:47:22,045 --> 00:47:25,514
What can we leave behind
for those we care about?

910
00:47:25,548 --> 00:47:28,517
There you go, buddy.

911
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:44,967
Walter Kenney wanted
to pass on the ugliness

912
00:47:45,002 --> 00:47:46,765
that his life had become.

913
00:48:03,186 --> 00:48:05,150
What will I pass on?

914
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:15,531
[Clattering]
Ah!

915
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:36,626
I don't know which slide
goes where, who's who.

916
00:48:37,176 --> 00:48:39,562
There's no order anymore.

917
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,828
[Sighs]

918
00:48:42,285 --> 00:48:46,745
[Horse hooves galloping]

919
00:48:46,779 --> 00:48:51,684
[Horses snorting]

920
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:08,002
[Horse whinnies]

921
00:49:10,006 --> 00:49:13,374
[Horse squeals, grunts]

922
00:49:13,409 --> 00:49:23,442
