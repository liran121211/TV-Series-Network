1
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,800
Previously on Dexter...

2
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,300
If you were the bay harbor butcher...

3
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
Would you use a place like this?

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,700
The conditions in this space don't support his memo

5
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,100
Maybe the butcher is having an identity crisis?

6
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,900
Your brother's a junkie.

7
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,600
Are YOU high?
He's never even smoked a cigarette

8
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,500
Looks like Cody is enjoying himself.

9
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,900
Dex is very patient with him.

10
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,100
Dexter's a saint.

11
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,600
I was hoping you could dig up an old case file for me.

12
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Got a date?

13
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,100
It's the crime scene where Harry found me.

14
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,600
<i>How much?
Three hundred bricks give or take.</i>

15
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,100
I've been waiting for a chance to take your ass out!

16
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,600
I know how you feel Sergeant.

17
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,100
He crossed the line lieutenant.

18
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,400
He broke into my labs.

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
He's probably gonna start
tailing me again.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
Sergeant Doakes tailed you?

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,800
I followed him
to an n.A. Meeting.

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,600
That asshole
lied about that, too.

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
You're obsessed.
I'm not.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,700
And i need you to see it!

25
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,900
Dinner was fantastic,
Rita. Wow.

26
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,100
I kind of like her.

27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,300
Lila: Dex,
just calling to check in.

28
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,900
Imagine Rita's face
if i told her

29
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,200
That you and i had spent
the night together in a hotel.

30
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,500
It's over, Dexter.

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,400
I guess i just hope with lundy
it will be different.

32
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,100
Why?
I respect him.

33
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,700
<i>You love him.</i>

34
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,600
No. He's like my dad.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
You want to tell me
what's going on?

36
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,900
You're the one who said i'm
supposed to feel my feelings!

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,400
Well, now i'm telling you
to get them under control!

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,000
Which step was that?

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That night, forest grew

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,100
Lila:
use the entire canvas.

41
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Start from the top.
Work your way down.

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,300
Light, feathery strokes.

43
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,900
Perfect!

44
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,300
Stunning.

45
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,600
Try longer strokes now.

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,400
Perfect.

47
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,400
You really know what you want,
don't you?

48
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,600
I hope you don't mind.

49
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,800
Some men do.

50
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,300
No.

51
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,700
I've always found
instruction manuals...

52
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
quite useful.

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Okay, your turn.

54
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
<i>What do you want?</i>

55
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,700
I think that was it.

56
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,500
Hmm, come on.

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,500
You must have
some dark fantasies...

58
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,300
...unfulfilled urges.

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,700
I'm pretty good
at acting on those.

60
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,600
Really?

61
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,600
Then fuck me like that.

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
Your light's burned out.

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
It's the wiring.

64
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,100
I've been asking my landlord
to fix it for weeks.

65
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,600
Well, now i can see better.

66
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,200
That's where
my landlord lives.

67
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,000
Now he'll have to fix it.

68
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,300
See you later.

69
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,500
<i>Got to admire lila for taking
things into her own hands.</i>

70
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,700
<i>That includes me.</i>

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,700
Ohh. Mom. [ Sighs ]

72
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,200
Come on, let's go!
No more moping.

73
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
I'm not moping.
I'm sleeping.

74
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,000
Oversleeping -
Third time this week.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,200
The only way you're gonna
get over Dexter

76
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,000
Is if you take charge
of your day.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,200
Come on. You're not
in high school anymore.

78
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Go scrub your face,
and i'll heat up some oatmeal.

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,800
Didn't hear you
come in last night.

80
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,700
Well, it was late.
I was quiet.

81
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,500
Yeah,
you're good at quiet.

82
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Guess you kind of have to be
with me crashing here

83
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,900
And Rita's mom over there.

84
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,900
You and Rita
fuck quiet, too?

85
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,300
And she's off,
right out of the gate.

86
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,200
Because me -
I wake the goddamn dead.

87
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
It's a problem.

88
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
Oh, i know,
only too well.

89
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000
Scary, right?

90
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,100
Sometimes i disturb myself.

91
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,800
So [chuckles] what kind
of noises does Rita make?

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,600
Could we not talk
about sex...

93
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,200
or Rita?

94
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,800
Why?

95
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
'Cause we broke up...

96
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,400
for real.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,900
It's over.

98
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,200
You break up,
you get back together -

99
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,400
That's just what goes on.

100
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,400
I mean,
you and Rita are forever.

101
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,100
Just say you're sorry
and send some fucking flowers.

102
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,200
You're not hearing me.

103
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,300
Look,
when all this blows over,

104
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,500
I'll spend a few days
at Gabriel's, and...

105
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,900
you can screw Rita
as loud as you want.

106
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,700
Big news, Dex.

107
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,500
Whoa! Feel like i got caught
in a wave.

108
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,200
<i>The miami tribune received
a 32- Page manifesto in the mail.</i>

109
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,600
It's looking good
for the bay harbor butcher.

110
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,100
Well, i've heard
that one before.

111
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,600
Look, this may be legit.

112
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,300
The manifesto includes the names
of three victims

113
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,900
We never released
to the press.

114
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,500
Oh, that is big news.

115
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,600
<i>I'm heading over to the tribune
now for special agent Lundy.</i>

116
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,100
He put me in charge
of the team.

117
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,500
Go, Angel.

118
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,800
Yeah, i'm psyched.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,100
<i>Yeah, me too.
I'm about to be published.</i>

120
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,800
<i>I sent that manifesto
to the tribune.</i>

121
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,600
<i>Guess i've been taking
some cues from Lila lately,</i>

122
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,700
<i>And not just in bed.</i>

123
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,400
<i>I'm tired of reacting
to the moves of agent lundy</i>

124
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,900
<i>And his super posse.</i>

125
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,400
<i>Time to control their actions
for a change.</i>

126
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,900
Betsy court, 16.
Blunt-Force beating.

127
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,800
It looks like
she was sunning herself

128
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,000
And never saw it coming.

129
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,500
Who called in the body?

130
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,900
Craig Wilson, the stepfather.
He's right over there.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
Wilson told
the reporting officer

132
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,600
That he came home for lunch
and found her that way.

133
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,800
Um, you and Dexter
resolve your issues?

134
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,200
As far as i'm concerned.

135
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,700
Why? The bitch come crying
to you again?

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
No.

137
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
There's blood work
to be done here,

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,300
And if you can't
control yourself,

139
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,400
I need to call in
another detective.

140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,700
I won't say anything to hurt
the little girl's feelings.

141
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,400
God damn it, James,
i'm not joking.

142
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Do i look like
i'm laughing?

143
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,900
No. You don't. I wish you would.
You used to.

144
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,500
Bullshit.
I never laughed.

145
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,300
[ Scoffs ] yeah, you know what?
You're probably right.

146
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,200
Now, look, i'm not gonna try
to scare you anymore.

147
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,500
The reality is,
you're out of free passes.

148
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,000
Now, i already stopped Dexter
from filing a complaint

149
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,800
Against you once.

150
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,290
I never asked you to do that, Maria.
Well, i did it,

151
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,300
Out of my own concern
over your obsessive behavior.

152
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,700
Now i'm on the line,

153
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,200
So if you bully Dexter
in any way -

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
If you even
look at him wrong,

155
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,300
I will not be responsible
for the fallout.

156
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,500
You got it?

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,800
I got it.

158
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,700
You're backing
the fucking freaktard.

159
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,500
James.

160
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,600
Where you been, Dexter?

161
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,100
You don't bring me
doughnuts.

162
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,900
You don't sing me love songs.

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,300
How are you, Camilla?

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I've been better.

165
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,400
Well,
that doesn't sound good.

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,800
Sergeant Doakes dropped by
my file room yesterday.

167
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,700
He requested the case files

168
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,100
For the 1973
shipping- Yard murders.

169
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,200
I gave him the same line
i gave you

170
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,700
When you came
sniffing around,

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
Said all that old stuff
was boxed up

172
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
In the basement
of city hall.

173
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
That made him real angry.

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,500
He scared me, Dexter.

175
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
That's not right.
He shouldn't do that.

176
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,800
Look, Dex, i always assumed
that your father asked me

177
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,100
To destroy those files
to protect you.

178
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:17,300
Now i'm not sure
what's going on.

179
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,300
Camilla...

180
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,700
now,
i don't want to know.

181
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,300
I just don't want
to get fired.

182
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I'm retiring next year.
Did i tell you?

183
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,200
I've been looking forward
to staying home with gene.

184
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,900
You won't lose your retirement.
I won't let that happen.

185
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,700
I can stall sergeant Doakes
for a few days,

186
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
But eventually,
he'll figure out

187
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,200
That that case file's missing,
just like you did.

188
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,900
And he'll track it back to me,

189
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,100
You know, just like you did.

190
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,600
I'll take care of this.
You have my word.

191
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,400
<i>So much for threatening Doakes.</i>

192
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,500
<i>He won't back off till
he exposes the twisted branches</i>

193
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,900
<i>Of my family tree,</i>

194
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,200
<i>From my father's indiscretions
to my murderous brother</i>

195
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,400
<i>To the root of all evil - Me.</i>

196
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,500
Hey.

197
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,800
<i>Why aren't you
at the tribune?</i>

198
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,000
What for?

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,300
Our guy's not gonna leave
dna evidence on a document.

200
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,100
Oh, but the thrill
of the hunt.

201
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,800
I've had
that particular thrill.

202
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,900
I'll leave it
to younger men.

203
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,900
Besides, it's easier for me
to do my part from here.

204
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600
Yeah?
What part is that?

205
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Operating on favors,
political leanings, posturing.

206
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
I've been trying to find
the right music.

207
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:51,900
Right.

208
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,900
So, i'm off duty today,

209
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
But here are those
marina reports.

210
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,500
And after my workout,

211
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,100
I'll swing by and pick up a copy
of the manifesto.

212
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,400
Look at that board.

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,800
These kills are precise,

214
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,000
But there's also a fluidity,

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,800
Even some improvisation.

216
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,100
If i could just find
the music...

217
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,500
want to borrow my ipod?

218
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,200
Got any chopin?

219
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,900
No.
Fresh out of Chopin.

220
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,300
Shit.
Chopin's perfect.

221
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,400
Did you just swear?

222
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,400
[ Chuckles ]
what can i say?

223
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,900
You're rubbing off
on me, Morgan.

224
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
<i>But Chopin is perfect.</i>

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,800
So this is how you do
what you do.

226
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,000
The truth speaks to me
from a peaceful place.

227
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,000
I got to set the stage
to hear it.

228
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
You know what i mean?

229
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,200
No.

230
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,600
I thrive on chaos.

231
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,000
But this is good, too.

232
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,400
I didn't kill her.

233
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,100
I was just trying
to stop the blood.

234
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,400
<i>No forceful impact spatter -</i>

235
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
<i>He's telling the truth.
I can tell.</i>

236
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,700
Palms up, please.

237
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,600
When i found betsy,
she was still breathing.

238
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,900
I wanted to help her.

239
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,500
You believe me, right?

240
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,700
I'm just the lab guy,
mr. Wilson. Sorry.

241
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,800
Arms down
at your sides, please.

242
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,500
<i>Blood misting. Huh.</i>

243
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,100
I need to collect his shirt
for evidence.

244
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,300
Morgan!

245
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,100
The girl's mother
was at work,

246
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,800
But she isn't really defending
her husband.

247
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
Wilson and his stepdaughter
fought all the time.

248
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,000
The neighbors heard him yelling
at her this morning.

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Then he comes home for lunch -
Motive and opportunity.

250
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,100
What'd the blood say?

251
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, the blood on his hands
could have come

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,100
From trying to help her,
like he claims.

253
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:43,200
But i did detect, uh, blood mist
on his shirt.

254
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
A blood mist -

255
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
The kind that comes from beating
on a teenage girl?

256
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,000
<i>No.
Yes.</i>

257
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,000
You're absolutely sure?

258
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,100
<i>It's too fine
for a bludgeoning.</i>

259
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,600
The mist is from
a bludgeoning.

260
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,000
Medium-Velocity impact
spatters - No doubt about it.

261
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,400
Okay, Morgan.

262
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,800
Just make sure you get me
your blood report

263
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
As soon as possible.

264
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,600
<i>This is my chance
to make Doakes go away</i>

265
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,300
<i>Without spilling a single drop
of his blood.</i>

266
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,400
<i>Of course, i have to sell
an innocent man down the river.</i>

267
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,000
<i>Sorry, mr. Wilson, but i won't
let you float too far.</i>

268
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,400
I was just thinking
about you.

269
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
<i>Hmm.
I like the sound of that.</i>

270
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,500
Yeah, i had to do a little
creative problem-Solving

271
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,200
At someone else's expense.

272
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,700
Bravo.

273
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,500
Yeah,
i figured you'd like that.

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,800
What's up?

275
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,900
Well, you know
that art installation

276
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,200
That i've been working on?

277
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,000
The cannibals.

278
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,600
They're not cannibals.
How barbaric!

279
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,500
Their eating is symbolic

280
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,800
Of the way we consume others
to feed our needs.

281
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,900
That's what i meant.

282
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, it sold.

283
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,800
I-I didn't even create it
to sell, but one of my buyers

284
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,700
Fell in love with it,
and i named an outrageous price,

285
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,800
And she paid me a deposit
on the spot.

286
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
So...

287
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,600
you in the mood
to celebrate?

288
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
Definitely.

289
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,100
I'm afraid we just can't
seat you tonight

290
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,400
Without a reservation.

291
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,900
As you can see, we are
completely at capacity.

292
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,100
Oh, well -

293
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,900
No, i'm sorry.
You have to help us.

294
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,700
I made this reservation
two months ago.

295
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,000
This is our
10-Year anniversary.

296
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,200
This is the place where Dexter
proposed to me -

297
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,900
On the patio,
in front of the fountain.

298
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,300
He told me to make a wish,
and when i looked down,

299
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There was my diamond ring,
sparkling under the water.

300
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,400
That is so romantic.

301
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Dexter:
in case you're wondering,

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There's nothing sparkling
under that water tonight.

303
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,600
[ Chuckles ] oh, i'm sure
you'll dazzle me somehow.

304
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,700
You're a creative problem-Solver
now, right?

305
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,900
A changed man,
or at least "changing."

306
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,300
I suppose.

307
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
There's no supposing
about it, Dexter.

308
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,800
You've taken control
of your addiction

309
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,500
In a way
that few people do.

310
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
It's been about a week

311
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,600
Since we've even discussed
your recovery.

312
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,000
I think you're right.

313
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,500
And you haven't felt the need
to use?

314
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,300
Incredibly, no.
I feel...

315
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,200
you know, like i'm finally
in control of things again.

316
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:08,200
We call that warm fuzzy feeling
the pink cloud.

317
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:12,400
It's when an addict experiences
acceptance for the first time.

318
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,000
You're saying
it won't last?

319
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,100
I'm saying that you have
to work it - That's all.

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
But i know that you will,

321
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Because i believe that
we've found a true substitute

322
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,500
For your addiction.

323
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,400
What's that?

324
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,200
Life.

325
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,200
You're making us all
look bad.

326
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,200
I'm the manager
of il bistro vino.

327
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,100
Happy anniversary -
On the house.

328
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,900
Thank you.
[ Chuckles ]

329
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,100
Oh, did you hear that,
darling?

330
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,900
Oh, i heard it,
darling.

331
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,900
Enjoy your evening.

332
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,300
Thank you.

333
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,300
Happy anniversary,
my love.

334
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
Aren't we in recovery?

335
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,600
Oh, this?
It's just bubbles.

336
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,300
We're not gonna shoot it up,
are we?

337
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,600
You really have a way.
You know that?

338
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,800
A way of what?

339
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,400
Of whatever the hell
you want.

340
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,800
Well, here's to 10 more
glorious years

341
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,000
Of whatever the hell i want.

342
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,400
Hi, i'm Cody,
and i researched Saudi Arabia

343
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,100
For my cultural report.

344
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,300
Gail:
that's good, sweetie.

345
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,500
Now, look at me
when you talk, okay?

346
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
And try and stand up
straight.

347
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,000
My board is covered in sand

348
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,300
Because Saudi Arabia
is one big desert.

349
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,600
<i>One great big desert.</i>

350
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,500
One great big desert.

351
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,900
It only rains in a tiny corner
of the country,

352
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,900
So they save rainwater -

353
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,400
Okay, now, try and keep
your fingers off your face.

354
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,900
You don't want people to think
you're picking your nose.

355
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
You mean like this?

356
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,800
Cody, you need
to take this seriously.

357
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Dexter said it should be fun.

358
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,900
Dexter does drugs.
He's wrong.

359
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,900
I finished my homework.

360
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
For the week?

361
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Hey, guys. I'm home.

362
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200
Mom!
Sorry i'm so late.

363
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,100
I'm so happy to see you!

364
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,000
Mom!

365
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,900
Oh, wow!
What a greeting.

366
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,700
Okay, why don't you guys
go get ready for bed?

367
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,500
Really, mom?
I just got home.

368
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,800
They need their rest.

369
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,800
I will be in in just a minute
to check on you.

370
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,400
Those two are making
great progress.

371
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Progress - Towards what?

372
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,500
Their full potential!

373
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,800
Mom, i know you're really good
at these things,

374
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
But now that you're here,

375
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Have you thought about applying
for a teaching job?

376
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,100
No, i'm through
with the schools.

377
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,500
Well, i thought teaching
was your life.

378
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,700
And your children are going
to be the beneficiaries

379
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,600
Of all that i have
to offer.

380
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,200
<i>Our injunction
stopped the tribune</i>

381
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,900
From publishing
the manifesto - For now.

382
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
At the very least,

383
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,200
We'll have time
to get a jump on things

384
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,900
Before the news frenzy hits.

385
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,800
So, let's take advantage
of this window.

386
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,800
Our goal for the next 48 hours
is to wade through

387
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,400
This shining piece
of social commentary.

388
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,100
I've never seen so many dense
and convoluted ideas in my life,

389
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,700
But we need to search them all
for clues to his identity.

390
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,100
So, first impressions?
I got something.

391
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,200
There are a lot of literary
references in this document.

392
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
How do you know?
I like to read books.

393
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
What kind of books?

394
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
All kinds. Who cares?

395
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Anyway...i see lots of
references, like this one.

396
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,200
"You can't depend
on your eyes

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,300
When your imagination
is out of focus."

398
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
[ Chuckles ]
he's a trekker!

399
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That shit's straight
from "deep space nine."

400
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,700
What?
Mark Twain said that.

401
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,800
It's one of
his most famous quotes.

402
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Twain was never
on "Deep Space Nine."

403
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,500
He was on "Next generation."

404
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,300
He didn't say it
on "Star Trek."

405
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,600
Okay, so what's it from?

406
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,000
"A connecticut yankee
in king Arthur's court."

407
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Angel, what other literary
quotes are in that manifesto?

408
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,300
This guy - He's the best boxing
student i have ever had.

409
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,100
After four weeks, he's getting
in shots to my head.

410
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,800
And finally he says,
"i think i'm ready."

411
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,100
I'm like,
"you're ready for what?"

412
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,900
And he says,
"to kick my mom's ass."

413
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm like,
"you're learning how to box

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,700
Because you want to beat up
your mom?"

415
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
What the fuck?!

416
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Did - Did you hear
what i said?

417
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,300
I was gonna hit the showers.

418
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,700
I'll meet you back here
in 10 minutes.

419
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,700
Okay, yeah, 10 minutes.

420
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,700
<i>Who the fuck are you?</i>

421
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Oh, hi! I'm Lila.

422
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh, pardon my tits.

423
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,600
Um, we thought you were crashing
at your boyfriend's tonight.

424
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,600
We - We who?

425
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
Dexter and I.

426
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,400
Could you just...wait here
a minute?

427
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,600
Who's the skank?

428
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,900
Deb, did knocking occur
to you?

429
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,800
Who is she?

430
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,400
And are you trying to fuck her
or set her on fire?

431
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,600
I didn't do this to you when you
were riding square-Jaw guy

432
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,000
With the handcuffs.

433
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,400
That's different. I wasn't cheating on anyone
with gabriel.

434
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,300
How could you do this to Rita,
not to mention her kids?

435
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,700
You're like their father.

436
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,900
<i>Hey, Rita broke up
with me, okay?</i>

437
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,000
You fucked up, Dex...

438
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,700
...big-Time.

439
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,715
Ew. Excuse me.

440
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,940
Don't worry.

441
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,105
She just needs some time
to adjust - That's all.

442
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,100
I had officers tear apart
the stepfather's house -

443
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,350
No murder weapon, but he had
to hide it somewhere.

444
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,590
Where is wilson now?
Interview room 2.

445
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:23,315
We still have him?
Why didn't his lawyer post bond?

446
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,504
Well, he tried, but i pulled in
a favor at the courthouse

447
00:26:26,505 --> 00:26:27,350
And got a bail enhancement,

448
00:26:27,765 --> 00:26:29,455
So they had to start
the paperwork all over again.

449
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,345
I'm gonna break
that cocksucker today.

450
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,810
What evidence you say
we got on this guy?

451
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,380
He was dripping
in the victim's blood.

452
00:26:37,385 --> 00:26:38,400
He was home alone with her.

453
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:40,275
They fought the morning of the murder.
All circumstantial.

454
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,975
Yeah, but the blood spatter
on his shirt was a direct result

455
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,515
Of a blunt-Force
beating, Maria.

456
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,215
I'd like to see
the blood report.

457
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,025
You'll get it
as soon as i do.

458
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,095
If you're looking for me,
i'll be questioning the suspect.

459
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,225
<i>They're still playing my tune.</i>

460
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,815
<i>It's like i'm conducting
a final symphony,</i>

461
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,260
<i>"Requiem for demonic Dexter."</i>

462
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,855
<i>And forming the entire
brass section,</i>

463
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,495
<i>Sergeant James Doakes.</i>

464
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,400
<i>When i reach the end,</i>

465
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,100
<i>Maybe i can lay to rest
the monster</i>

466
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:36,805
<i>Formerly known as Dexter.</i>

467
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:41,255
<i>Just hang in there, mr. Wilson.</i>

468
00:27:56,035 --> 00:27:58,100
I've asked a psycholinguist
at MIT.

469
00:27:58,105 --> 00:28:00,025
To analyze our manifesto.

470
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:04,025
His computer tabulates
punctuation, misspellings,

471
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:06,675
And sentence structure
to identify a set of key words,

472
00:28:07,005 --> 00:28:09,435
Which he'll use to create
a profile of our killer.

473
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:13,715
Sounds...complicated.
Stay on it.

474
00:28:14,825 --> 00:28:17,400
Okay, we've been at this
too long.

475
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,300
It's, uh, 1:00.

476
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:20,575
Let's break for lunch.

477
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,885
Are you all right?

478
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:35,060
Huh? Yeah, i'm fine.

479
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:37,960
Anything you want
to talk about?

480
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,205
No, not really.

481
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,455
Well, if you change your mind -
It's my brother.

482
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,545
He was dating this chick -

483
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,530
Supersweet,
a little doe- Eyed.

484
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,470
But, god, for him,
fucking perfect,

485
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:51,985
And he just threw her away.

486
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:55,005
I'm just pissed at Dexter,
not to mention my boyfriend,

487
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,535
Who did absolutely
nothing wrong.

488
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,245
But every time he opened
his mouth last night,

489
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,520
I wanted to fucking
slap him.

490
00:29:00,525 --> 00:29:01,815
You've been listening
to Chopin.

491
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,605
Yeah,
i downloaded a Chopin -

492
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,215
Um, "Nocturne number 2
in e flat major."

493
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,830
One of my favorites.

494
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,190
It, uh, can have this effect
on people.

495
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,170
It can stir up some dust.

496
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,880
No shit.

497
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,030
<i>Listen, you -
You can heal yourself, sir.</i>

498
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,550
<i>Just - You just need
to talk to me.</i>

499
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:32,980
<i>Get it off you,</i>

500
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,400
<i>Otherwise, it's gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life.</i>

501
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:37,245
<i>Why don't you
just listen to me?</i>

502
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:38,440
<i>I didn't do this.</i>

503
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,199
<i>You - You can't say it
and make it true.</i>

504
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,350
<i>You have a conscience,</i>

505
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,420
<i>And it's really fucking
with you right now.</i>

506
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:49,150
<i>I wish it were me.
I wish i were dead.</i>

507
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:49,880
<i>Yeah.</i>

508
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,215
Why are we questioning
that guy?

509
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,175
He's a murder suspect.

510
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,930
No, he's not.
He's innocent.

511
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,010
What did you say?

512
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,650
My blood report
backed his story.

513
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:02,400
Mr. Wilson found
his stepdaughter dead,

514
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:04,300
Just like i told sergeant Doakes
at the crime scene.

515
00:30:04,575 --> 00:30:07,045
You turned in the blood report?
When?

516
00:30:07,275 --> 00:30:08,775
I don't know -

517
00:30:08,775 --> 00:30:10,475
At some point
before i went home last night.

518
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,775
I put it right
on the sergeant's desk,

519
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,795
Just like he asked.

520
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,460
The green folder.

521
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,710
Yeah,
according to my findings,

522
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:23,114
The mist on the stepfather's
shirt was exhaled

523
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,900
From the victim when he tried
to revive her.

524
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:28,150
The autopsy confirmed she had
severe internal bleeding,

525
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,465
Due to the bludgeoning.

526
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:31,835
Yeah, but he could have
beaten her first.

527
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:33,775
That's impossible.

528
00:30:33,975 --> 00:30:38,400
The crime-Scene photos show
blood radiating outward

529
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:39,625
Around the victim's body.

530
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,705
That kind of bludgeoning would
have covered the real killer

531
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:42,745
In blood from head to toe.

532
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,185
Thanks.

533
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,930
Mr. Wilson,
you're free to go.

534
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,050
What the hell? Lieutenant,
this man is a killer.

535
00:30:55,055 --> 00:30:56,970
This man has been through enough
for one day.

536
00:30:59,115 --> 00:31:00,465
There's an officer
in the hallway.

537
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,100
He'll see that you get
your personal belongings back

538
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:03,930
And take you home.

539
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,410
Thank you, ma'am.
Thank you so much.

540
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,800
What the hell
are you doing?

541
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:18,830
Trying to save your career,
james, if it isn't too late.

542
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,705
Did you even check
the blood report?

543
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,205
<i>I didn't get
the blood report.</i>

544
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,315
It's on your desk,
and it exonerates your suspect.

545
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,680
<i>We should be out there
looking for the real killer.</i>

546
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,520
Maria, that is not
what he told me at -

547
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,875
That motherfucker.

548
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,555
He's good.

549
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,185
Who?

550
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,595
Morgan.

551
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,820
He planned this whole thing.

552
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,955
Maria,
that psychopath set me up.

553
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,600
Dexter again?
You're blaming Dexter for this?

554
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,635
Do you have any idea
how pathetic that sounds?

555
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,600
This is not about Dexter!

556
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,200
This is about the poor judgment
you have been displaying

557
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,910
In this department
for months now!

558
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,190
You want to work out?

559
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,130
No.

560
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,060
I wasn't talking
about the gym.

561
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,580
You're sweet,
but i'm really not in the mood.

562
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,355
So, what do you want to do?

563
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,830
Uh...

564
00:32:25,755 --> 00:32:27,195
i think i want to break up.

565
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,475
For real?

566
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,595
Yeah.

567
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,635
Is that okay?

568
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,160
No.

569
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,740
No, it's not okay.

570
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,650
Fuck, what did i do, Deb?

571
00:32:46,655 --> 00:32:48,950
Nothing.
I swear to god.

572
00:32:49,525 --> 00:32:53,465
You're...smoking hot
and...fun

573
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,175
And...soulful and...

574
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,700
age-appropriate.

575
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,070
And but what?

576
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,080
But...

577
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,760
sometimes the truth speaks
from a peaceful place.

578
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,870
It's taken me a long time
to find that place,

579
00:33:09,875 --> 00:33:10,820
But i think i have,

580
00:33:12,155 --> 00:33:14,165
And it's telling me you're not
the right one for me.

581
00:33:22,945 --> 00:33:24,145
I'm so sorry.

582
00:33:31,455 --> 00:33:33,385
You live in a nice
neighborhood.

583
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:35,555
Yeah, i had no idea.

584
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,900
I'm usually passing by
at 35 miles per hour.

585
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,770
I'm not a real big walker.

586
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,425
Everybody walks in London.

587
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,035
Of course, they're usually
walking to the pub.

588
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,035
<i>How far are we going?</i>

589
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,195
Oh, you're a bit grumpy
tonight.

590
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:56,380
What's wrong?

591
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,310
Come on.
Don't close up on me now.

592
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,800
No,
i honestly don't know.

593
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,430
I mean, thanks to you,
things are...

594
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:10,910
actually looking up.

595
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,950
Some people at work
have been...after me.

596
00:34:13,955 --> 00:34:15,700
I think i have 'em
under control.

597
00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:21,495
So, why the grouchiness?

598
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,805
Is it because your sister thinks
i'm a trollop?

599
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,720
It's not just...Deb.

600
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,595
It's the suddenness
of all of this -

601
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,920
Losing Rita, the kids.

602
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:41,585
They've been the only thing
keeping me human

603
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,755
For a long time.

604
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,605
<i>Were they keeping you human,
though,</i>

605
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,180
Or were they the ones making
you feel like the monster

606
00:34:55,185 --> 00:34:56,245
That you were talking about?

607
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,855
Keep going.

608
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,320
Your friends and family
have to accept you

609
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:09,740
For who you're evolving into
now that you're clean.

610
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,765
Is that what i am -

611
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,500
Clean?

612
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,505
'Cause i don't feel that way
at all.

613
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:25,830
No, you certainly don't.

614
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,770
Mmm, god.

615
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,690
I wish i could fuck you
right now.

616
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,650
Whose house is this?

617
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,760
Couldn't tell you.

618
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,340
God.

619
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,960
He's a man of many talents.

620
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,230
Ah!

621
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,915
Look.
I'm some old bitch.

622
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,805
Better not press our luck.
We should go.

623
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,180
Hello?

624
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,520
Hi, Dexter.

625
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,405
Cody?

626
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,720
Can you come
to my school tomorrow?

627
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,420
What's at your school,
buddy?

628
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,965
I'm doing
my cultural report.

629
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,430
Saudi Arabia.

630
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,125
Can you watch me?
I'm kind of scared.

631
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,205
Cody,
what are you doing?

632
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:00,850
Who is this?

633
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:02,595
Dexter.

634
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:08,980
Hello?

635
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,120
Who was that?

636
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,840
Rita's son.

637
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:20,225
He wants me to come see him
at school tomorrow.

638
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,465
Oh, poor kid.

639
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,545
He doesn't understand
that you've gone.

640
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,420
I think i'll go.

641
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,740
Whatever you think's best.

642
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,685
Hey, guys!

643
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,265
I'm home!

644
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,360
Hello?

645
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,930
They're in bed.

646
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:00,390
Why so early?

647
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,450
Cody is being punished
for sneaking away

648
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:05,090
To make a phone call
without permission.

649
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,585
Astor joined him in a misguided
show of support.

650
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,110
Well, who was cody calling?

651
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,325
Dexter.

652
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,230
The boy was trying
to invite him to his school.

653
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:16,620
Can you imagine?
Oh.

654
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,045
Mom, we need to have a talk.

655
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,275
I made a phone call
of my own today.

656
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,080
I spoke with aunt Cecilia.

657
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:29,040
She told me the school district
fired you almost a year ago.

658
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,070
We had philosophical
differences.

659
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,419
The educational system
is falling apart.

660
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,355
School should be life itself,
not a preparation for living.

661
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,960
Do you know that they give
trophies to every child now

662
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:47,610
Whether they win or lose?

663
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:48,745
Yeah, i finally get it.

664
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:51,715
It took me a few decades,
but it's not just me -

665
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,275
Nobody can deal with you.

666
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,520
You don't leave room
for anybody else to exist.

667
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,500
It's not my fault that
so many people are willing

668
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,150
To settle for mediocrity.

669
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,370
Just look at you -
First Paul, then Dexter.

670
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,050
Rita, you lack
even common sense,

671
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:11,840
And now you're passing
that torch of ordinary character

672
00:39:11,845 --> 00:39:13,110
On to your children.

673
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,045
Shut the fuck up.

674
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,345
Nobody talks about my kids
that way.

675
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:21,990
That a girl.

676
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,960
<i>That's what i've been waiting
to see.</i>

677
00:39:24,965 --> 00:39:26,620
Yeah!
I'm done with you.

678
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,065
No, you're not.

679
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,155
But you go -
You give me hell.

680
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,150
No.

681
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,120
<i>No, i won't do that.</i>

682
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,115
I won't let you turn me
into...you.

683
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,140
Rita -
Here's what's gonna happen -

684
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,849
First thing in the morning,

685
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,380
You're gonna pack up
and go home.

686
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,660
You'll come and visit us
for birthdays and holidays,

687
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,530
But you're not gonna live
with us anymore.

688
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,880
Well...

689
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,895
...if that's what i have
to sacrifice

690
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,825
To get you on your feet...

691
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,680
"kill one man,
and you're a murderer.

692
00:40:14,685 --> 00:40:16,200
"Kill thousands,
a conqueror.

693
00:40:16,325 --> 00:40:18,025
Kill them all,
and you're a God."

694
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:19,700
Does it sound to you
like our guy

695
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:21,715
Has a narcissistic
personality disorder,

696
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,395
A classic god complex?

697
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,190
I think you're
onto something, Angel.

698
00:40:25,355 --> 00:40:26,404
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

699
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:29,320
<i>I don't know what
my alter ego had in mind</i>

700
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:30,405
<i>When he wrote that crap.</i>

701
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,025
<i>I just pulled from various
blogs on the internet,</i>

702
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:35,840
<i>Mixed and matched -
Presto manifesto.</i>

703
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,205
You finally decided
to fight back.

704
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,250
I been waiting.

705
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,850
Hope you don't expect me
to comment on that

706
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,200
So you can record it
on your hidden tape recorder.

707
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,270
I wasn't born yesterday.

708
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:58,285
You might have been,
for all i know.

709
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,400
Your past is a bigger mystery
than fucking Jimmy Hoffa.

710
00:41:02,445 --> 00:41:05,669
I tried every avenue,
legal and otherwise,

711
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,275
But there ain't no
paper trail

712
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,130
On the early years
of Dexter Morgan.

713
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,250
I guess there's no recorder
running, after all.

714
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,415
No, man.

715
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:19,420
Unlike you, i do everything
out in the open.

716
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,850
Well, in that case,
sergeant,

717
00:41:24,855 --> 00:41:26,245
Let me put this in the open
for you.

718
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:31,855
No matter what you try,
no matter when,

719
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,405
No matter how hard you work,

720
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,545
I'll always be a step ahead
of you for one simple reason.

721
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,790
And what's that?

722
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,920
I own you.

723
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,400
Aah!

724
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,350
Aah! Fuck!

725
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,910
Get him off of me!
Get off me!

726
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,880
Why are you doing this?!

727
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,480
Stop!

728
00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:19,315
I want your gun, your badge,
and your police ID.

729
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,510
I want your
access card, too -

730
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,310
Now!

731
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,570
Type a statement
that sergeant Doakes

732
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:27,500
Is on administrative leave,

733
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:29,520
Pending an internal affairs
investigation.

734
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,215
You two,
get him out of here.

735
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,150
Thanks.

736
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,480
What the hell happened?

737
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,485
I don't know.
He just...jumped me.

738
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:59,085
That guy's always
had it out for me.

739
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,430
Thanks for meeting
with me, don.

740
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,565
Well, i don't know
what the point is.

741
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,270
The district court injunction
hearing starts in three hours.

742
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,590
Which everyone here knows
we're going to lose.

743
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,835
Don't look so shocked.
We always lose these things.

744
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:24,625
You bastards
and your free speech.

745
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,370
My boss never
lets me say anything.

746
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,050
I'll tell you what -

747
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,350
I will agree to dropping
the injunction,

748
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,100
Which will save us days
of courtroom arguments

749
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:37,570
And a boatload
of legal fees,

750
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,699
If we can agree
on some simple ground rules

751
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,600
On how you publish
that document.

752
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,800
"Ground rules."

753
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,895
We're not gonna have
any ground rules.

754
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,360
My only goal here is to avoid
compromising an investigation

755
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:51,500
Of a mass murderer...

756
00:43:52,605 --> 00:43:53,915
who could hurt
a lot more people.

757
00:43:56,945 --> 00:43:58,545
Give me just a second,
will you, Frank?

758
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:08,645
I can't believe
you got those assholes

759
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,349
To publish the manifesto
without the victims' names

760
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:14,375
And as a page-3 story.

761
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,255
No sense hyping it.

762
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,390
It might just inspire the killer
to greater heights.

763
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,370
Wait.

764
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,900
It's quiet here...

765
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:22,700
peaceful.

766
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,450
It's a good spot.

767
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,150
For what?

768
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,095
It's 1:00.

769
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:33,920
So it is.

770
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,855
I brought my own sandwich.

771
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,030
I thought you didn't like
the quiet, Morgan.

772
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,240
I didn't.

773
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,130
I don't.

774
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,165
When i'm alone
and it's quiet, i get scared...

775
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,905
shitless,

776
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,815
Like i start hearing
what's really going on inside.

777
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:02,740
I see.

778
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:05,500
So if it's all the same
to you,

779
00:45:05,505 --> 00:45:07,605
Maybe i can just practice
when you're around.

780
00:45:09,155 --> 00:45:10,175
Okay.

781
00:45:12,905 --> 00:45:13,635
'Cause when you're around,

782
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,345
I kind of feel like i can deal
with anything, you know?

783
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,345
Like what happened to me -

784
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,780
I don't have to run from it.

785
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:28,555
I don't have to jump into bed
with some guy and hide there.

786
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,545
You give me strength.

787
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,415
I'm kind of
opening up here.

788
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,490
What do you want me to say?

789
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:50,930
I don't know.

790
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,060
You're the fucking zen master.
Figure it out.

791
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:00,795
Morgan...

792
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,760
i've got plaque
in my arteries.

793
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,060
I know the lyrics
to elevator music.

794
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,950
My hair isn't getting
any thicker.

795
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,450
You're gonna do great
up there.

796
00:46:47,455 --> 00:46:48,640
You just have
to remember something -

797
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,495
They're more frightened
than you are.

798
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:51,960
No, they're not.

799
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:52,590
Are so.

800
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:55,140
You're gonna be staring at them
the whole time.

801
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,944
If one of those unsuspecting
moms or dads

802
00:46:56,945 --> 00:46:59,345
Does something embarrassing
while you're up on stage...

803
00:46:59,345 --> 00:47:00,345
like pick their nose?

804
00:47:00,345 --> 00:47:02,325
...you're gonna be the one
who sees it.

805
00:47:03,045 --> 00:47:04,000
Yeah.

806
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:05,175
Now that's power.

807
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,920
Now go have fun.

808
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,565
Dexter, over here.
We saved you a seat.

809
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,555
Thanks, guys.

810
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:23,860
There you go - $18,000.

811
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,695
I'll send a truck
for the piece tomorrow.

812
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,900
I am telling you, Lila,

813
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,320
This is going to create
a critical mass for you.

814
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,430
According to the
psycholinguistic analysis

815
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,380
Of the manifesto,

816
00:47:36,935 --> 00:47:40,205
Our killer is a white male
in his 50s.

817
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,400
What else?

818
00:47:41,405 --> 00:47:44,604
Uh, the killer
has no girlfriends

819
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:47,385
And considers himself
a good catholic.

820
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:48,175
Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

821
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:50,379
How can you tell all that
by putting words in a computer?

822
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,280
I don't know, dude.
It's science.

823
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,660
How 'bout common sense?

824
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,660
I think the guy that
we're looking for is
pissed off at god,

825
00:47:56,870 --> 00:47:58,105
And that's why
he kills people.

826
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:01,030
Really? I actually found him
very politically motivated.

827
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:02,900
Yeah, like a modern-day
revolutionary.

828
00:48:03,075 --> 00:48:05,275
Which would suggest that
he's killing for social change.

829
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,495
This is what he wants.

830
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:16,315
What's that?

831
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:18,755
Confusion, chaos -

832
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:20,325
It's what the killer wants.

833
00:48:22,235 --> 00:48:24,215
He's always been an intensely
private figure,

834
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,985
Dispatching victims silently.

835
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:29,365
Now he's suddenly a media whore?
It doesn't make sense.

836
00:48:29,855 --> 00:48:31,485
He's creating
a clusterfuck.

837
00:48:31,755 --> 00:48:33,325
Very good, officer Morgan.

838
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:35,135
The killer's making us
chase our tails.

839
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,555
You know what that means?

840
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,800
He knows how we work.

841
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,565
Look how he hits
every major theme -

842
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:00,770
Political,
environmental, religious.

843
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:05,300
In one section, he manages to
weave together Julius Caesar,

844
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:08,080
Berlin, Germany, The Pittsburgh
Steelers, and Gandhi.

845
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:09,100
It's scattershot.

846
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,950
He knew that this would
send us scurrying

847
00:49:11,955 --> 00:49:13,250
Like squirrels for nuts.

848
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,075
Yeah, but to suggest that
he might be one of us -

849
00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:18,115
How can you be sure?

850
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:26,320
Hi, i'm Cody,
and i researched Saudi Arabia

851
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:27,735
For my cultural report.

852
00:49:28,005 --> 00:49:29,404
My board is covered in sand

853
00:49:29,405 --> 00:49:33,115
Because Saudi Arabia
is one big desert.

854
00:49:33,645 --> 00:49:37,625
As you can see, i used coffee
beans to write "Saudi Arabia."

855
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:40,415
Arabic coffee is very famous.

856
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,305
<i>I'm a little confused.</i>

857
00:49:42,415 --> 00:49:44,955
<i>Lila is the one showing me
how to take control,</i>

858
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,185
<i>Stop killing,
get my life clean.</i>

859
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,700
<i>But this is the first time
since i went into recovery</i>

860
00:49:51,705 --> 00:49:53,440
<i>That i actually feel clean.</i>

861
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,605
The children in Saudi Arabia
are just like us,

862
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,540
Because they...

863
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:25,210
this is the Saudi Arabian flag.

864
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,110
The arabic letters mean
"there is no god except allah."

865
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,630
Do you know how tough it is
for a woman in Saudi Arabia?

866
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:49,215
They can't drive or have
powerful jobs.

867
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,540
Or get this - They can't even
go to the movies

868
00:50:57,545 --> 00:50:59,250
Without men's permission.

869
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:03,570
After they turn 12, they have
to wear long black sleeves,

870
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:07,790
And they can't hardly even talk
to men until they get married.

871
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,350
The new king, Abdullah,

872
00:51:17,355 --> 00:51:19,530
Is trying to change
some old bad rules,

873
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,030
So women can do more things...

874
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:26,275
thank you very much
for listening.

875
00:51:26,535 --> 00:51:29,065
Or, as they say
in arabic, "shokran."

876
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:57,175
I can't believe how calm
you were up there.

877
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:59,140
Yeah, you were like
a professional talker.

878
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,700
You were pretty good.

879
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,530
Can Dexter come
for ice cream with us?

880
00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:07,410
Can he, mom, please?

881
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:11,070
Uh...sure,
Dexter can join us.

882
00:52:11,075 --> 00:52:12,000
I wouldn't miss it.

883
00:52:12,005 --> 00:52:13,805
Maybe they'll have some
delicious saudi flavors,

884
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:15,265
Like sand or oil.

885
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,270
Hang on a sec, guys.

886
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:21,055
Hello.

887
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,625
Are you hurt?

888
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,680
O-Okay, okay.
I'm coming now.

889
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,630
I know. Me too.

890
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,735
Come on, kids.
Dexter won't be joining us.

891
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:42,270
Rita, it's an emergency.

892
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,400
Look, i'm so sorry,
you guys.

893
00:52:44,405 --> 00:52:45,500
I'm gonna make it up
to you,

894
00:52:45,505 --> 00:52:47,245
But i got to help a friend
who's in trouble.

895
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,705
There was a fire
at her place.

896
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,620
I'm so sorry.

897
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:53,025
Hey, let's go.

898
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,840
Dexter.

899
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,425
What happened?

900
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:27,750
I was working on my piece
with the blowtorch,

901
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,620
And it just caught fire.
I was so scared.

902
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,450
Oh, i guess so.

903
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,900
Promise me that you won't
leave me,

904
00:53:39,905 --> 00:53:41,335
That you won't go anywhere.

905
00:53:42,305 --> 00:53:43,825
I'm not going anywhere.

906
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,875
Hey, you got
your light fixed.
