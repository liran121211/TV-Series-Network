1
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,100
"Previously on ""dexter""..."

2
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,400
You'll notice we have
some new faces here.

3
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,600
Are we under investigation?

4
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,130
Sloppy bloodwork.

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,430
"I asked myself, ""how the
hell did that happen?"""

6
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,730
Bay harbor butcher is one of our own.

7
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,160
Dexter and I broke up.

8
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,160
Does that mean he
doesn't like us, either?

9
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,060
Would you have dinner
with me tomorrow night?

10
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,500
I'd love to have dinner with you.

11
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,060
Your past was a bigger mystery
than fucking jimmy hoffa.

12
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,260
It's time to make doakes go away.

13
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,400
Sergeant james doakes is
on administrative leave

14
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,430
Pending an internal
affairs investigation.

15
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,760
Are we through here, sir?

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,630
No, actually. we're just
getting -- we're done.

17
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,430
Oh. there's my sponsor.

18
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,760
This woman sees me.

19
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,560
I didn't care what you did.

20
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,100
She's looking behind the mask,
and she's not turning away.

21
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,700
You a friend of dexter's?

22
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:42,360
I'm, uh, his decorator. love the hat.

23
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,100
Dexter!

24
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,360
Help, please!

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,060
I need to embrace who I am.

26
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,760
I need to kill the man
who murdered my mother.

27
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,500
A secret cabin in the
middle of the everglades --

28
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,800
What more could a rededicated
serial killer ask for?

29
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,630
It's kind of fitting, don't you think?

30
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,060
Well, it's just that the door was open

31
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,530
And you're the only
other one with a key.

32
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,830
Rita, get out of the
house. call the police.

33
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,460
I can't take you with me.

34
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,660
Someone was in this house.

35
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,760
Dexter, what's going on?
please, just stay here.

36
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,530
Stay away from rita.

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,900
Stay away from me.

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Resistance is Futile

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,960
That's what I said.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,330
That I'm always right?

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,030
That you were right about lila.

42
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,330
She was bad for me.

43
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,260
And that I'm always right!

44
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,930
Hurry the fuck up!

45
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,460
I didn't realize how
bad till last night.

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,560
Hey, vince. how's it going?

47
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,260
She had me fighting with
myself the whole time.

48
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,200
All that self-reflection is unhealthy.

49
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,560
Stop reflecting and move.

50
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,260
Sorry.

51
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,260
The fact is I already know who I am,

52
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,600
And I'm done fighting it.

53
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,730
So the battle's over. lila's over.

54
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,230
Morgan, clean this mess up.

55
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,930
It's a goddamn safety hazard.

56
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,660
Can't leave this shit lying around, bro.

57
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,300
Nice -- my subconscious isn't
even bothering with symbolism.

58
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,760
That's what I get

59
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,360
For leaving the remains of
jimenez up in that cabin.

60
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,960
Bad time to get sloppy,
with special agent lundy

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,630
Putting everyone in law
enforcement under a microscope.

62
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,600
Dexter? what are you doing here?

63
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,500
I, uh...

64
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,430
...just wanted to give you that.

65
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,200
You're in the same
clothes as last night.

66
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,430
You slept here?

67
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,200
Not intentionally.

68
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,830
I just wanted to make sure
whoever broke in stayed away.

69
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,500
I guess I kind of
fell asleep on the job.

70
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,760
Sorry.

71
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Don't be.

72
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,130
Dexter! dexter's here!

73
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,160
Hey, guys!

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,100
Dexter, I made a killer
robot that eats airplanes.

75
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,400
Want to see?

76
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,000
Mom's making pancakes.
you want bananas in yours?

77
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,660
Actually, guys,

78
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,000
There's something I got
to go deal with, so...

79
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:48,430
Then why'd you come?

80
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,060
Cause you needed one of these.

81
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,460
All right, guys,

82
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,230
Dexter's got work to
do, so go eat pancakes.

83
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,630
Add extra bananas for me.

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,000
I didn't mean for them to find me here.

85
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,200
Well, it's okay. I think
they needed a hug, too.

86
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,900
Take care, dexter.

87
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,900
Wait. I want to say something.

88
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,930
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,030
All right.

90
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,100
I feel...

91
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:44,330
Such regret,

92
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,400
Which is rare for me.

93
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,530
But not that I
don't mess up --

94
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,760
I do...

95
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,630
Just never so stupendously.

96
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,660
I had you and them.

97
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:06,400
And I had us --
so much to have.

98
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,760
And just to demolish it,

99
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,130
I honestly thought that
I was smarter than that --

100
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,500
Rude awakening.

101
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,300
Lila's one of the biggest
mistakes of my life.

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,500
It means a lot to me, dexter.

103
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,100
But it doesn't change the fact

104
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,760
That you slept with another woman.

105
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,030
I can't forgive that.

106
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,830
I don't expect you to.

107
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,830
I just wanted to say it.

108
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,530
All I can do now is pick
up the pieces of jimenez.

109
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,830
He's one big pile
of evidence --

110
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,000
Not that anyone will easily
break into that cabin.

111
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,330
The thing's a bunker.

112
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,300
Still, I can't leave
a kill lying around.

113
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,300
I'll have to call in sick at work.

114
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,800
It's not
doakes -- fbi.

115
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,460
My feeble interview with lundy

116
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,400
Might have put me on his
short list of suspects.

117
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,800
Left turn to the cabin...

118
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,700
Right turn to a change
of clothes and work.

119
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,860
Glad I'm at peace with
harry's code again.

120
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,400
It makes
decisions easier --

121
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,060
Caution first, jimenez later.

122
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,630
Announcing the arrival of flight 274

123
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,030
From santiago, dominican
republic, gate 20-b.

124
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,460
Your call has been forwarded

125
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,530
To an automatic voice-message system.

126
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,860
James doakes...

127
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,160
...is not available.

128
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,430
To page this person, press 5 now.

129
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,000
You know what? fuck you, james.

130
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,730
Fuck you and your disappearing act.

131
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,030
You know, you didn't just
stand me up last night.

132
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,560
You screwed yourself out of
a six-figure security job,

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,330
Which means that being a cop

134
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,200
Is one of the few options you have left.

135
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:30,260
So, stop pissing off the
people that can help you.

136
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,760
Lundy's people have
been trying to reach you.

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,100
They just want a hand with
the bay harbor butcher case.

138
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,560
James, give it to them.

139
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,760
Show lundy that you are a team player.

140
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,660
Fake it.

141
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,060
And pick up when I call again.

142
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,930
I'm gonna keep calling.

143
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,730
I'm not giving up on you, james.

144
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,100
Your right eye is a little
darker than your left eye.

145
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,160
And you weigh about 50 pounds.

146
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,030
I'm gonna have to fatten you up.

147
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,830
Didn't seem to bother you last night...

148
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,600
Or this morning.

149
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,800
So much for taking it slow, huh?

150
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,900
The slow part was nice.

151
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,260
I guess that's the perk

152
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,400
Of dating a man who's experienced.

153
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,800
"Read ""old guy."""

154
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,200
Read what
I said --

155
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,500
Experienced, as in technique...

156
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,460
As in mad skills.

157
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,100
Are you always gonna be this
touchy about the age thing?

158
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,360
That will get old.

159
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
Sorry.

160
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,830
This is new territory for
me -- dating in general,

161
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,530
Dating someone so young in particular,

162
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,730
And dating a coworker especially.

163
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,800
Ooh. so I'm the more
experienced one -- cool.

164
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,360
You've dated coworkers?

165
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,030
Okay, not that experienced.

166
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,760
Well, I've seen enough of them
to see where they go wrong,

167
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,560
And experience tells me

168
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,100
That full disclosure
is the best way to go.

169
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,430
What, like...

170
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,860
Tell people at work?

171
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,800
Debra, I'm an aboveboard kind of guy,

172
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,260
And in the history of office romances,

173
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,530
Sneaking around has never worked.

174
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,400
I don't know.

175
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,500
Things are just so tense
around the station right now.

176
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,430
So you're worried about
making people tense?

177
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,030
I just think the timing is bad.

178
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,830
Maybe we should
wait until we can --

179
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,030
Lundy.

180
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,530
When?

181
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,560
Notify d.c.

182
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,100
Then get cal to go sit on
mendelsohn until he signs.

183
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,860
Yeah.

184
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,460
And then call the field
office and get me more bodies.

185
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,400
Well, we need to move on this now.

186
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:29,900
Yes. okay.

187
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:32,100
What's up? not sure.

188
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,630
Something break on the butcher?

189
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,911
I gotta go

190
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,700
There's quiche. eat it.

191
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,000
Wait -- shouldn't we finish
talking about this whole...

192
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:46,030
...full-disclosure thing?

193
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,330
Lundy's bees are buzzing.

194
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,260
Something has agitated the hive.

195
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,330
My money's on connolly down in property.

196
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,600
Looks like much ado
about something in there.

197
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,200
Lundy's got a suspect for
the bay harbor butcher,

198
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,060
And bro, it's one of us here.

199
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,930
That's...disturbing.

200
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,200
We're not sure that
lundy's picked someone,

201
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,560
But if he has, it sure as
hell isn't one of my people.

202
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,230
I'm sorry, lieutenant, but I
confirmed it myself last night.

203
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,960
Everything points to
someone in this house.

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,430
Who in this house?

205
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,900
I don't know, but something
must have broke this morning,

206
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:33,060
Cause lundy shut us p.d.
out of the task force,

207
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,260
Brought more feds in.

208
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,460
So he definitely has
someone in his cross hairs.

209
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,460
What about steinbauer in
impound? dude's a freak.

210
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,530
I bet it's wykoff from
records. chico, please.

211
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,430
What about loring in narcotics?

212
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,000
Or it could be that murderous
morgan in blood spatter.

213
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,930
Maybe I was being watched this morning.

214
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,600
But they'd be doing more than
watching if they had proof.

215
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,760
What's going on in there?

216
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,760
You tell us.

217
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,600
Why would I know?

218
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,900
Come on. you're lundy's pet.

219
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,560
Fuck you.

220
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,660
Seriously, what's lundy got,
or is he just blowing smoke?

221
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,900
Seriously, I don't know.

222
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,630
But if he's got
something, it ain't smoke.

223
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,530
Lundy's too good to blow smoke.

224
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,700
Man, no wonder you're his pet.

225
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,860
Fuck you twice.

226
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,700
Okay, enough. enough.

227
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,100
If you're not on the task force,

228
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,600
You're clearing cases for the day.

229
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,400
yes, you too.

230
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,130
Psst, morgan.

231
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,460
We've got company.

232
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,560
Yeah, I noticed.

233
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,960
Not there --
in there...

234
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,900
Waiting for you.

235
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,500
Lundy brought in his own forensic techs.

236
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:44,260
What are they looking for?

237
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,860
Think they'd tell me?

238
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,830
I'm just the lfi.

239
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:53,430
Lead forensics investigator
-- or at least I used to be.

240
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,160
Well, fuck them.

241
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,300
They can have their fucking title

242
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,300
And the acronym
that goes with it --

243
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,900
Fucking indian givers.

244
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,230
Dexter morgan.

245
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,360
In the flesh.

246
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,860
Please give me your access
code for the forensics database.

247
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,000
I'd like you to walk me
through your filing system.

248
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,500
I'll need a breakdown of
procedure and protocol.

249
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,600
Is there something particular
I can help you with?

250
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:24,330
We just need your help
navigating the lab.

251
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,760
Your code, please.

252
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,900
May i?

253
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,100
If they're looking for
proof, they won't find it --

254
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,400
Not here at least.

255
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,560
I may have briefly
rebelled against harry,

256
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,730
But I learned my lessons well.

257
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,130
Come on, dex. tell me.

258
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,800
Um, make sure they deserve it.

259
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:55,000
Dexter, this is
life-or-death stuff.

260
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,330
It's that important.

261
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,460
Why do you think I pulled all
those strings to arrange this?

262
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,200
Dexter, now, come on. tell me.

263
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,730
What is the number-one rule?

264
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,460
Don't get caught.

265
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,660
And what are all the other rules for?

266
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,460
So I don't get caught.

267
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,260
You ready for this?

268
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,730
I'm ready.

269
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,960
Why are they looking at us like that?

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,860
They don't know why you're here,

271
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,960
Why you need to see this.

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,360
But I want this seared
into your mind, son.

273
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,200
The chair?

274
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,400
The chair?

275
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,460
Cross-check our data with interpol.

276
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,100
See where it leads. yeah.

277
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:32,430
Hi.

278
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,930
Hey.

279
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,900
So, bats out of hell

280
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,060
Move slower than you did this morning.

281
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,130
I know. I'm sorry.

282
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,530
But as you
can see --

283
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,930
Something's up.

284
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,230
Something's up.

285
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,930
Cause I wondered if maybe
you were also cheesed

286
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,830
About my whole not-disclosing thing.

287
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,860
I don't want you to think

288
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,730
I'm unsure or...

289
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,630
Embarrassed or anything.

290
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,900
Why would you be embarrassed? I'm hot.

291
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,200
Mm-hmm. yeah. you got that right.

292
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:06,560
Hey, look, it had
nothing to do with you,

293
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,260
Except that it made you feel
bad, which was not my intention.

294
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,400
It's
just --

295
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,300
- Something's up.
- Something's up.

296
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,000
What?

297
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,260
I really can't tell you.

298
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,730
Why not?

299
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,600
Honestly, you don't want to know.

300
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,260
It's a ghost from my past.

301
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,600
I wasn't sure I'd be able to find you.

302
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,360
I'm in the phone book now.

303
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,530
Last place you look, eh?

304
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,960
It's good to see you, leones.

305
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,660
My father-in-law
will be happy

306
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,130
We have a customer
with american dollars.

307
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,560
Looks like you're in the
travel business now, huh?

308
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,000
Orbitz, man --
it's killing us.

309
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:23,500
And people only think of
haiti for war and poverty.

310
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,800
But the brave ones still come.

311
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,700
We arrange tours between the islands.

312
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,560
No more sneaking people over the
border in the middle of the night?

313
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,400
My wife would castrate me.

314
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,730
I work only for her father now.

315
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,130
The man is satan on wheels.

316
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,930
I hope the dog will bite him.

317
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,430
So, what can I arrange for you?

318
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,230
Maybe the rosewood
resort on little dix, huh?

319
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,800
Only the best for my old friend.

320
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,930
I was thinking more like
the hospital in dom rep.

321
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,930
You are sick?

322
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,100
No. but I need a
-- a discreet lab.

323
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,460
A relaxing cruise is better.

324
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,130
There's a shuffleboard tournament

325
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,900
On the jewel of the
seas -- big stakes.

326
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,230
Leones, you were always the one to see,

327
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,800
No questions asked,
whenever we needed shit.

328
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,230
I am not a fixer anymore,

329
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,860
And you are not in black operations.

330
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,430
I'm a travel agent, and I like it.

331
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,200
No one tries to kill me or torture me...

332
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,830
...except for him,

333
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,760
With his vicious dog and foul breath.

334
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,560
Listen, this isn't dangerous, man.

335
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,660
I just need some blood slides analyzed.

336
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,530
Leones, I need your help.

337
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,760
This is all you want
-- the slides analyzed?

338
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,300
And your most expensive
tour package of the islands.

339
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:57,300
Give me the slides.
I'll see what I can do.

340
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,930
Confirm the arrangements first.

341
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,500
I'll bring them over by boat.

342
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,000
Avoiding customs.

343
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,430
Don't want to risk it
with biological materials.

344
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,560
Just tell me, james.

345
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,000
Are you in trouble?

346
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,700
No.

347
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,160
But someone else is gonna be.

348
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,760
Okay.

349
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,360
That takes us through
95's discoverable notes.

350
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,600
94.

351
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,030
How far back are you looking?

352
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,830
Let's start with knife wounds.

353
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,230
To search by cause of death,

354
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,700
Go to the upper
right-hand --

355
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,800
It's okay. I'm good.

356
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,560
They're wasting their time here.

357
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,730
Now, if they had a
warrant for my apartment,

358
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,860
They'd find blood
slides and killing tools.

359
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,500
Got to move those.

360
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,000
Got to dispose of jimenez.

361
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,960
Instead, I'm waiting
for the fat man to sing.

362
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,500
Why don't I just
-- I've got it.

363
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:50,730
It will be faster
-- I've got it!

364
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,160
In fact, I think we can get
along on our own from here.

365
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,860
And he sings.

366
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,830
I'm wearing green underpants.

367
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,930
Are you?

368
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,460
Yeah, but when I bought
them, they were white.

369
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,830
Too much information!

370
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,400
Oh!

371
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,060
Aha.

372
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,160
Look who's come out of his cave.

373
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,930
Lila, what are you doing here?

374
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,330
She came to see me, bro.

375
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,830
Angel mentioned that
he needed a decorator,

376
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,760
And, well, a slot just came up,

377
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,830
So I gave him a call.

378
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,000
I've always wanted a decorator.

379
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,460
Angel, come here.

380
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,630
She's not really a decorator.

381
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,100
It's not really my apartment
that I want decorated.

382
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,730
So, hey, the boys here

383
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,460
Have persuaded me to go for a drink.

384
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,730
Or 10.

385
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,100
Oh, god. should I be worried?

386
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,160
Yes. you should.

387
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,300
Then maybe you should come with us,

388
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:59,130
Because who knows what secrets
will come pouring out of me

389
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,800
Once the drinks start flowing.

390
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,030
Hey, lila, um, I have 2,000 square feet

391
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,830
That needs a total makeover.

392
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,800
You got 800 if you
count your parking space.

393
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,260
She can do it twice.

394
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,230
I have to get to jimenez,
but a dead man tells no tales.

395
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:18,830
A drunk, unstable woman very well may.

396
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,700
But do you call me

397
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,860
Paddy the road builder?

398
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,300
No, and me, with my own two hands,

399
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,000
I built the town library.

400
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,160
But do you call me
paddy the library giver?

401
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,930
No.

402
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,230
But you fuck one little goat...

403
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,530
All right. I got one.

404
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,530
Stop.

405
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,500
What? it's a good one.

406
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:49,030
Knowing you, it would be
inappropriate in front of a lady.

407
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,830
She just did a goat-fucker joke.

408
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,160
Aw, you're such a protector, angel.

409
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,260
I do my best.

410
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,660
Like that time that you
came to dexter's rescue

411
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,200
At the bowling alley.

412
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,730
You just ran right towards that mugger,

413
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,330
No thought for your own personal safety.

414
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,900
That's my job.

415
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,560
Mine, too. it is not.

416
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,630
Don't do it, lila.
don't bring jimenez up.

417
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,600
Did they, uh, ever catch that guy?

418
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,760
Yeah, dex, did you ever file a report?

419
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,460
I can still look into it.

420
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,430
I'm sure he's long gone by now.

421
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,460
Yeah.

422
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,800
Anyway, I'm gonna go to the loo.

423
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,300
The loo?

424
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,460
How cute is that?

425
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,160
It's --
right.

426
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,430
What the hell do you want?

427
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,800
I'm concerned.

428
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:53,130
Usually, when someone
quits their sponsor,

429
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,900
It means they're using again.

430
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:57,260
You can quit the sponsor bullshit.

431
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,130
I'm done with it and you.

432
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,660
Did I not make that clear last night?

433
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,900
It's out of order.

434
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,960
There's still work we can do together.

435
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,500
No, there isn't
-- I am who I am,

436
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,300
And I don't want you coming
anywhere near me or my addiction.

437
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,460
Do you understand?

438
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,130
Oh, I understand... how lonely you are.

439
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,300
Stop.

440
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,900
Those friends of
yours out there --

441
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,060
They didn't even know you.

442
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,500
They just see the
mask, but I see it all.

443
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,260
I can see how upset you are.

444
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,130
No, really?

445
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,600
No.

446
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,360
It's more than just me
that's eating at you.

447
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,830
There's something else.

448
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,530
You don't have to handle it alone.

449
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,830
I can help.

450
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,560
I know how heavy that mask is,

451
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,200
How tiring.

452
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm the only one who can see behind it,

453
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,800
And it doesn't scare me.

454
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,600
It's like looking in the mirror.

455
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,360
It's why we belong together.

456
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,000
Hey, asshole, it's ladies only.

457
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,430
My mistake.

458
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,200
He giving you trouble?

459
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,600
A little.

460
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:15,330
But I know he'll see I'm right.

461
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,630
I know you will.

462
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,630
You are not driving.

463
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,030
Fuck you.

464
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,760
Fine.

465
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,430
Can't live with her. can't kill her.

466
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,500
She's not going away.

467
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:43,130
Neither is that undercover car.

468
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,630
So much for paranoia.

469
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,600
Those feds are real.

470
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,860
Lundy found my slides.

471
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,060
It's over.

472
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,160
You're out of shampoo.

473
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,330
Sorry. yours is better than mine.

474
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,600
What are you doing here?

475
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:23,230
My new place isn't set up yet.

476
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,260
I don't want to make a
habit of staying at lundy's.

477
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,800
I mean, what if people find out?

478
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,900
It would be a whole new
reason to disrespect me.

479
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,230
Maybe they already know.

480
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,900
They keep assuming I have inside intel.

481
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:34,160
They're always asking
me what lundy knows.

482
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,960
What does he know? tell me.

483
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,960
Fuck, dex, I'm talking
about my feelings here.

484
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,330
What the fuck is your problem?

485
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,100
Look, I know he's old, and
it's complicated and whatever,

486
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,160
But I feel like he's someone
I can, you know, count on.

487
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,100
That's good, deb.

488
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,800
You should have that,
because I won't always be --

489
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,430
Who the fuck is that at this hour?

490
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,930
Deb, don't.

491
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,730
What the fuck?

492
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,160
Dexter morgan.

493
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,230
Special agent lundy wants to see you.

494
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,900
Please come with us.

495
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,530
Wait. lundy didn't say
anything about this to me.

496
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,060
I'm sorry, deb.

497
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,960
I'm on the fucking task force.

498
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,100
I demand to
know what --

499
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,700
I'm right behind you.
they're calling us in.

500
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,000
I'm right behind you, dex.

501
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,800
We got him.

502
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,960
I should be panicked, terrified,

503
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,700
But lila was right.

504
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,700
The mask has been heavy.

505
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,260
I won't need it in surrender.

506
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,800
I can let it go.

507
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,560
The pain will come

508
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,600
When Deb finally understands
who her brother really is.

509
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,660
Rita's horror, the kids' tears.

510
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,660
My old friends, here to betray me.

511
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,300
Please sit down.

512
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,700
I'm sure that you heard

513
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:41,930
We have a suspect in the
bay harbor butcher case.

514
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,560
Put them on.

515
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,530
We now have the evidence to back it up.

516
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:53,400
We need answers, now.

517
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,960
Open it.

518
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,600
Explain it to us.

519
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,800
Trophies.

520
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,760
That's what I thought.

521
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,060
What happens now?

522
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,500
I know this will come as
a shock to you, Morgan,

523
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,130
But our primary suspect
is someone you know well...

524
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,230
...sergeant James Doakes.

525
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:44,400
Sergeant...Doakes?

526
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,800
He was the lead case investigator

527
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,530
On four of the butcher victims,

528
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Which put him on my radar.

529
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,100
We looked into his background.

530
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,300
It turns out his father
was a butcher and abusive

531
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:01,530
Doakes was also a trained
assassin in special forces.

532
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,860
That, along with his
on-the-job shootings

533
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,760
And excessive-force
citations --

534
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,900
He fits the profile.

535
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:09,360
Yes.

536
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,430
He has a need to dole
out personal justice.

537
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,330
Yesterday, Doakes walked
out of an interview

538
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,460
And disappeared.

539
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,860
This morning, we were alerted

540
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,800
that he boarded a plane
out of the country.

541
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,800
That enabled me to get warrants
on his apartment and car.

542
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,160
He had the slides?

543
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,330
Carefully hidden in the trunk
of his car at the airport.

544
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,130
It all makes so much sense.

545
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,700
Everyone else in the precinct

546
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,100
Was beyond shocked when I told them.

547
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,330
What exactly is sergeant
Doakes' problem with you, Morgan?

548
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,660
I kill people, for one.

549
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,660
But what was it sergeant
Doakes said about me?

550
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,430
I've always sensed

551
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:53,200
There was something... off about him...

552
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,160
Like he's hiding in plain sight.

553
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,230
I never concealed my doubts.

554
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,100
So he attacked you.

555
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,100
Well, he might try it again,

556
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,500
Particularly when he finds
out he's our prime suspect.

557
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,330
Yeah. that should piss him off.

558
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,860
We've tried to keep an
eye on you from a distance.

559
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,260
The undercover cars.

560
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,160
Not undercover enough, obviously.

561
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm sorry for the abrupt pickup tonight,

562
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,200
But from here on out,

563
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,400
We'll want a protective
detail on you at all times.

564
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:26,260
That could complicate my life.

565
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,160
Dexter, it will keep Doakes at bay.

566
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Good point.

567
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,130
What happens now is we need you

568
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,000
to analyze and match
these slides immediately.

569
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,060
Me?

570
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,130
I'm keeping the forensics in-house.

571
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,960
The public needs to
see our strength now.

572
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,930
Their trust in us is about
to take a major ass-fucking.

573
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,530
Now, I'm making you first forensic tech

574
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,900
In the chain of custody
with these slides.

575
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:52,630
I figure you have more
motivation than most

576
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,060
to see Doakes brought to justice,

577
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,860
So I know you'll be thorough.

578
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,830
The tsa is circulating Doakes's photo

579
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,230
To all major airports.

580
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,160
Sergeant
Doakes --

581
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,100
He peeked behind the curtain.

582
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:11,600
He saw who I am.

583
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,660
But it only put him in the line of fire.

584
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,660
There's an apb out on
the eastern seaboard.

585
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,200
I still don't believe it.

586
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,560
Because it's not true.

587
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,800
I don't know.

588
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,960
Don't, vince.

589
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,860
Just --
just don't.

590
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,900
I didn't know.

591
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,860
I swear Lundy didn't tell me.

592
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,060
I believe you.

593
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,730
Big fucking manhunt
mobilizing out there.

594
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,360
We'll get him, Dex.

595
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,900
And when you do, my story
has to be stronger than his.

596
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,600
Don't worry, I'm gonna be with
you every step of the way --

597
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,630
Me and this.

598
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,930
I have an even bigger favor.

599
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,130
Name it.

600
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,060
Move into that new apartment of yours.

601
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,660
Deb, if you got in the middle
of this and you got hurt --

602
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,630
Hurt?

603
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,230
I'm a fucking cop.

604
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,530
You're my sister first.

605
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,600
And I'm gonna worry like
a brother, not a coworker.

606
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,530
Don't, god damn it. you
have enough to worry about.

607
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,500
I can't help it.

608
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,830
Deb, the best thing you can do for me

609
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,660
Is to get me and my
protective detail a wide berth.

610
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,060
Fucker.

611
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,800
Fine.

612
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,430
I fucking hate it, but I get it.

613
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,100
One less pair of eyes to worry about.

614
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,130
You just can't get rid of me, can you?

615
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,700
Laguerta.

616
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,960
You know I didn't do this.

617
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,060
You know me, Maria. that's not me.

618
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,960
Yeah, but they don't.

619
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,960
What do they have on me?

620
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,230
They found something in your car.

621
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,530
Oh, shit.

622
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,660
The longer you stay
out, the worse it gets.

623
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:05,730
The only way I can help you
is if you turn yourself in.

624
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,630
No one will listen without proof.

625
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,000
Of what?

626
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,860
Look, I don't want
to pull you into this.

627
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,900
Look, the next time you
see me, they'll be no doubt.

628
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,800
Until then, you won't
be able to contact me.

629
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,860
Don't you disappear on me, james.

630
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,830
Maria, I have to do this.

631
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,060
God damn!

632
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,630
Listen to me.

633
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,160
I just want you to know
that you meant a lot to me --

634
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,900
More than you know, and...

635
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,060
I just want to thank you for that.

636
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,460
What does that mean?

637
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,260
Wait.

638
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,300
Wait.

639
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,630
Looks like I won't find any
prints or dna on this box.

640
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,860
I can chalk it up to
how careful doakes is.

641
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,060
Harry had strict rules about
not hurting the innocent,

642
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:22,900
And for all his fury...
doakes is innocent.

643
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,730
But there's also the number-one
rule -- don't get caught.

644
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,100
Still, he'll fight this, and
I'll have to disprove him.

645
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,600
He could win...

646
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,430
Or he could end up paying for my crimes.

647
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,860
Morning.

648
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,760
Mr. morgan, uh,

649
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,560
Special agent lundy thought
you might need our help.

650
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,230
Please come in.

651
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,100
Um, sorry about all
the secrecy yesterday.

652
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:25,000
We were reviewing
sergeant doakes' cases,

653
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:27,460
And -- well,
you understand.

654
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,660
I need you to do

655
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,160
The liquid extractions and
centrifuging on these samples.

656
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,630
The cells just started digesting.

657
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,800
Then we'll, um, come back in 12 hours.

658
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,660
The samples should be
watched at all times.

659
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,430
Don't let anyone in or out of the lab,

660
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,800
And don't let the incubator
dip below 37 celsius.

661
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:47,430
And please, don't touch anything.

662
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,100
You understand.

663
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,800
That was satisfying.

664
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,430
Dex!

665
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,700
Hey, bro!

666
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,330
Are you okay, man?

667
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,760
This shit with
doakes is crazy --

668
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,960
Yeah. I have to go, angel.

669
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa. hold on.

670
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,300
Are you pissed or something

671
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,100
About lila and me?

672
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,900
Oh, yeah. that.

673
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,260
Dex, I don't want it getting between us.

674
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,200
If you still want
her -- god, no.

675
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,460
Lila's insane,
destructive --

676
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,230
A naturally occurring disaster.

677
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,300
Okay, so you don't mind if
I go for her, then. what? no.

678
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,830
Look, angel, here's
the real truth --

679
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,700
Lila's just using you to get at me.

680
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,630
So what?

681
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,960
So what?

682
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,400
Look, dex, no one's used
me for good or bad reasons

683
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,730
Since my wife
divorced me --

684
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,700
Damn sure no one as hot as lila.

685
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,530
You may be missing my point.

686
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Look, first it was the divorce.

687
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,060
Then getting stabbed was no picnic.

688
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,730
And now this thing
with doakes --

689
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:56,630
Dark days, my friend, too dark.

690
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,930
Man, I need a light at
the end of the tunnel, man,

691
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,600
And lila's it, all right?

692
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,330
Uh... all right, then.

693
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,000
Angel just doesn't get it.

694
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,200
Lila's no solution.

695
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,930
She's a problem...

696
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,600
Shall we?

697
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:17,830
...just like my little groupies.

698
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,130
I couldn't tell you.

699
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,930
Even with my brother at risk?

700
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,660
We had him covered.

701
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,300
It would have forced you
to divide your loyalties.

702
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,630
Plus, I didn't want
to appear to favor you.

703
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,600
They all think you favor me anyway.

704
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,300
Maybe because I do.

705
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,800
Do you think they know?

706
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,430
Not until you tell them.

707
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,500
Special agent lundy...

708
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,460
You're giving doakes to the press?

709
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,300
Best way to bring him in.

710
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,330
If you publicly
accuse him --

711
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,900
I'm not accusing anyone.

712
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,000
Doakes is wanted for questioning,

713
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,400
And that's what my press release says.

714
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,730
It will still destroy him.

715
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,400
He's doing a fine job
of destroying himself.

716
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,930
He is not your man.

717
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,300
He is, however, my prime suspect.

718
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,660
Look.

719
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,400
I'm willing to work with you on this,

720
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:13,860
But only if you let me
take lead with the media.

721
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,500
Lieutenant, I am not letting
you anywhere near the media.

722
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,330
He may be your ex-partner.
he may be your best friend.

723
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,600
What he is to me is a suspect.

724
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,200
So you deal with that
however you need to.

725
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,060
And you will give me
your complete cooperation,

726
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,160
Or you may find yourself out of a job.

727
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,160
It's mine.

728
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,760
Hello?

729
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,660
It --
it's me.

730
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,860
I wasn't sure I should call.

731
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,360
I'm glad you did.

732
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,400
It's probably best I move on,

733
00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:00,560
But the kids were so
happy to see you yesterday.

734
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,300
I wasn't, you know, unhappy.

735
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:07,730
Well, that's good, right?

736
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,760
I just -- I need
to know one thing.

737
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,030
Is it over with lila?

738
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,130
Yes -- absolutely,
completely over.

739
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,530
If I never see her
again, it'll be too soon.

740
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,860
Hello?

741
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:34,800
I have feelings for you.

742
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,030
I have feelings for you, too.

743
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,330
I'm not gonna fight them anymore.

744
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,200
I think we should get together and talk.

745
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,730
Tonight?

746
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,300
That would be great
-- really great.

747
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,560
But
tonight's --

748
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:54,360
No, this... is a bad idea.

749
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,660
No, rita, it's the best
idea you've ever had.

750
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,560
It's just we've got a big break
in the bay harbor butcher case.

751
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,430
Things are kind of intense around here.

752
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh, wow. did they catch him?

753
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:09,360
Well, someone's gonna go down for it.

754
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,900
But tomorrow would be really great.

755
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:15,530
Okay. tomorrow.

756
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,930
I'll look forward to it.

757
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,900
We're getting together tomorrow.

758
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,030
Communication's the key.

759
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,630
The light at the end of the tunnel.

760
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,930
All clear.

761
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,860
We'll have a man stationed
at the front and side doors

762
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,660
And two in the parking lot.

763
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,300
Just, uh, give us a
yell if anything arises.

764
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,360
Nothing's gonna arise,

765
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,060
Certainly not me -- not
until tomorrow morning.

766
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,860
I'm exhausted.

767
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,560
Don't let anyone near
this door for any reason.

768
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,960
Shoot them if you have to.

769
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,500
No problem. sleep tight.

770
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,400
Sleep would be nice,

771
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,830
But there's too much to do.

772
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,300
The good news is my new
friends will keep doakes away.

773
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,860
The bad news is they make
getting to jimenez difficult...

774
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,530
But not impossible.

775
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,200
Fortunately, a car isn't the only way

776
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,060
To reach the everglades,

777
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:42,400
And my new marina's
only a 20-minute walk.

778
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,330
I'm on my way, jimenez.

779
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,260
Don't decompose just yet.

780
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,200
I'll be against the
current on the way back.

781
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,630
With bagging, cleanup, and
detour to the gulf stream --

782
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,060
Tight, but I should be home by daybreak.

783
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,830
It's time to get you out
of my life once and for all.

784
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,760
You got to talk to lundy.

785
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,030
About what?

786
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,530
Get him to hold off on
putting doakes on the news.

787
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,160
Maybe you should talk to lundy.

788
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,800
Morgan, you're one of
us. doakes is one of us.

789
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:38,200
He deserves the benefit of the doubt.

790
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,160
Look, lieutenant, I
know he's your friend,

791
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,730
And we're all pretty
fucked up about this,

792
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,130
But it is lundy's ballgame.

793
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,830
But he listens to you.

794
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,530
You're his right hand.

795
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,700
Right hand? just say it.

796
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,930
Fuck the euphemisms.

797
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,230
And okay, I may be sleeping with him,

798
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,130
But that doesn't mean he tells me shit

799
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,430
Or listens to me about
anything, so stop asking.

800
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,160
You're sleeping with lundy?

801
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:08,360
I'm sleeping at your
place again tonight.

802
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:33,200
Just one more trip.

803
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,300
Ahead of schedule.

804
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,730
That's right, motherfucker.

805
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,000
It's over.

806
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:51,230
How'd you find me?

807
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,200
Gps tap on your boat.

808
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,460
Jesus christ, morgan.

809
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,260
Jesus fucking christ. you're
the bay harbor butcher.

810
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,860
I really hate that name.

811
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,330
Jesus christ, man.

812
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,630
You said that.

813
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,700
Always knew there was
something with you.

814
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:06,400
But this shit?

815
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,660
What can I say? you were right about me.

816
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,360
I never held it against you.

817
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,530
I don't now.

818
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,260
My buddies thought I was
crazy for becoming a cop.

819
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,630
I had skills. I could
have written my own ticket.

820
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,960
And lately, I thought
they might have been right.

821
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,260
But
this --

822
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,030
This makes it all worth it.

823
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,260
I'm happy for you.

824
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,560
Shut the fuck up.

825
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,030
Let's get this over with.

826
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:33,760
Put them on.

827
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,230
Morgan, you're done. give it up.

828
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,200
Would you in my position?

829
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,560
I wouldn't be in your
position, you sick fuck.

830
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,800
You sure about that? you
might want to chat with Lundy.

831
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:49,960
Hey, you shoot me, who
will prove your innocence?

832
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,600
Maybe I'll just kneecap you.

833
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,160
All right. nice and slow.

834
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,700
Back the fuck off, Morgan!

835
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,800
I'm just following your lead.

836
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,260
Slow down.

837
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,460
You're gonna have to kill me, Morgan!

838
00:48:37,230 --> 00:48:40,200
You're gonna have to
fucking kill me, Morgan!

839
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:48,000
Morgan!
