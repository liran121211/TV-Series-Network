1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:01,661
<i>Previously on Dexter...</i>

2
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:04,450
We have to catch them
in the act at the shipyard.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,850
He's gonna find out,
and then he's gonna kill me.

4
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:10,790
Harry knew my mother.

5
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:14,021
Why would Rita print out
narcotics anonymous literature

6
00:00:14,022 --> 00:00:15,085
If Paul's dead?

7
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:17,861
Because recently
I entered the program.

8
00:00:18,447 --> 00:00:21,062
How many fucking times
do I have to tell you that I'm fine, Maria?

9
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:22,460
This is my department.

10
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:25,129
I need to know that you are fit for
duty. That's my job as a Liutenant!

11
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,222
I always stop and eat lunch at 1:00.

12
00:00:27,493 --> 00:00:30,478
You'll learn that about me.
Why don't you sit down?

13
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:33,605
You're very fidgety.
Anyone ever tell you that?

14
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:35,384
My father.

15
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:37,374
You applying for the job?

16
00:00:37,556 --> 00:00:38,692
Well, you said you'd call.

17
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:41,000
<i>Where are you,
and when are you coming back?</i>

18
00:00:42,892 --> 00:00:43,300
Tomorrow morning.

19
00:00:43,555 --> 00:00:45,715
Promise me to stop by the house
first thing.

20
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:46,564
See you.

21
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:49,237
- Is she OK with you doing this?
- I didn't tell her.

22
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:50,422
I don't care what you did.

23
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:52,441
<i>I'm no longer sure
who made me what I am.</i>

24
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,776
<i>Funny thing is I've met someone
who doesn't care.</i>

25
00:00:54,943 --> 00:00:58,635
- We need to talk about Coral Cove.
- What about coral cove?

26
00:00:58,714 --> 00:01:00,754
The algae on the rocks
sent us there.

27
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,924
If I were you,
I'd consider moving your boat.

28
00:01:02,924 --> 00:01:06,558
<i>- Security out there sucks.
- When I'm back, I'll hit the marina</i>

29
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:08,595
<i>and make sure there's
no blood traces on my boat.</i>

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,148
This isn't a commercial marina.

31
00:01:10,156 --> 00:01:12,682
But I can see the upkeep
on this place is dismal.

32
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:15,963
That's why I'm gonna order 24h surveillance
on this marina and the two others.

33
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,128
There's another shipment
coming in tomorrow.

34
00:03:18,088 --> 00:03:19,224
Cocaine.

35
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:21,880
How much?

36
00:03:22,246 --> 00:03:24,190
300 bricks, give or take.

37
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:27,961
Can you get your hands on some?

38
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:30,385
That wasn't part of our agreement.

39
00:03:31,887 --> 00:03:35,377
We need hard evidence. Otherwise,
it's just your word against Estrada's.

40
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:38,828
I'll protect you.

41
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,300
I promise.

42
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,416
You better.

43
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:50,630
Do you meet me later?

44
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,380
Laura, the tape's still rolling.

45
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:03,595
<i>Very convincing.</i>

46
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:07,104
What was that?

47
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:15,877
<i>Laura, the tape's still rolling.</i>

48
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:19,467
Damn it.

49
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:22,804
<i>My mother...
Confidential informant...</i>

50
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:24,530
<i>and mumbler.</i>

51
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,571
<i>Whatever sweet nothings
she had to whisper</i>

52
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:30,661
<i>I probably don't want to hear.</i>

53
00:04:33,112 --> 00:04:37,209
<i>It seems that my foster father and my
biological mother were having an affair.</i>

54
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:40,940
It's bad enough I can't shake
the visual. But the questions...

55
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:45,419
<i>Did he blame himself for her death?
Is that why he took me in?</i>

56
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:46,934
<i>Did he love her,</i>

57
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:48,988
<i>or was he just using her?</i>

58
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:50,628
<i>Was he using me?</i>

59
00:04:51,674 --> 00:04:55,671
<i>I always thought Harry's code was
on-The-Spot creative problem-Solving,</i>

60
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,954
<i>But maybe he planned for me
to settle the score all along.</i>

61
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:04,509
<i>It's times like this I wish
I really were a drug addict.</i>

62
00:05:04,791 --> 00:05:07,598
I had emotional problems as a kid
because of what happened to my mom.

63
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:10,797
Harry said he was trying to help me,
mut we only talked about his rules.

64
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:14,196
I spent so much time
trying to live up to his expectations

65
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:16,562
because I thought he had
my best interests in mind.

66
00:05:16,702 --> 00:05:20,316
If you come over this late, the least
you could do is bring me a coffee.

67
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:23,091
- Sorry.
- Cappuccino...

68
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:25,145
Make a note of it.

69
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,810
Truth is, Dex,

70
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:35,448
It doesn't really matter
why Harry did what he did.

71
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,219
The result's the same.

72
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:39,044
You have an addiction.

73
00:05:40,705 --> 00:05:43,155
Do you think Harry
made me what I am?

74
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:46,673
Plenty of people go through trauma
without turning to addiction.

75
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,706
Whatever Harry taught you
led you down the wrong path.

76
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,792
But I've built everything
in my life

77
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,072
on what Harry said
I was supposed to be.

78
00:05:57,212 --> 00:05:58,958
My job, my girlfriend...

79
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:03,358
It's all what Harry
told me I needed.

80
00:06:03,702 --> 00:06:05,360
What do you think you need?

81
00:06:08,436 --> 00:06:09,759
I have no idea.

82
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:12,752
Whatever's inside you
is splattered all over

83
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,129
that paper I took from your lab.

84
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:17,797
Looks messy.

85
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,041
It probably is.

86
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:22,595
Look, Dexter.

87
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:25,896
Everyone has a moment

88
00:06:26,075 --> 00:06:29,259
when they realize their value system
is different from their parents'.

89
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,786
Mine was in college, but...

90
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:34,848
maybe you're a late bloomer.

91
00:06:35,227 --> 00:06:37,552
- Lucky me.
- Damn right, lucky you.

92
00:06:38,654 --> 00:06:40,529
You get to have a fresh start.

93
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,095
Whatever you thought or did
doesn't matter.

94
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,464
Now you get to figure out who you are.

95
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,671
<i>I went to Lila for answers,
but now all I have is more questions.</i>

96
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:59,002
<i>Who am I? What do I need?</i>

97
00:06:59,235 --> 00:07:00,571
<i>What do I want?</i>

98
00:07:01,302 --> 00:07:03,752
<i>Coffee. I really want
a cup of coffee.</i>

99
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,540
- What up, half-day?
- Is there coffee left?

100
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:07,936
You're late.

101
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:11,296
I fell asleep before you got home
last night. Were you at Rita's?

102
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:15,631
You're welcome, ass.

103
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:19,080
- Your brother looks like shit.
- Tell me about it.

104
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,148
I may be out of line with this,
but did he fall off the wagon?

105
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:24,723
What wagon?

106
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:28,312
The only wagon he's ever had
is a radio flyer.

107
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:30,245
Your brother's a junkie.

108
00:07:31,003 --> 00:07:31,895
Isn't he?

109
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:37,654
Are you high?
He's never even smoked a cigarette.

110
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:41,172
I'm glad you got
some new material, though,

111
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:44,562
'cause "freak" and "psycho"
were getting kind of tired.

112
00:07:57,509 --> 00:07:58,636
Agent Lundy?

113
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:03,395
So, I hear a rumor you're tracking
all our Internet activity.

114
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:05,116
Is it true?

115
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:08,097
'Cause I can explain
all that she-male stuff.

116
00:08:09,828 --> 00:08:12,010
I need my team outside in five minutes.

117
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:14,031
That sounds important.

118
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,093
Got a major break in the investigation.

119
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,845
Patrol found a guy saying he
escaped the Bay Harbor Butcher.

120
00:08:19,153 --> 00:08:21,317
He claimed he was captured
two hours ago.

121
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,144
<i>That's a neat trick,
considering I was asleep.</i>

122
00:08:24,346 --> 00:08:25,992
<i>At least trying to sleep.</i>

123
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:27,778
<i>This could be good news for me.</i>

124
00:08:28,072 --> 00:08:29,306
- Morgan?
- Yes?

125
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:31,041
The other Morgan.

126
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,835
I'd like you to join us,
if you can spare him.

127
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:35,268
That's fine with me.

128
00:08:36,162 --> 00:08:38,221
- Is there blood?
- Not that I'm aware of.

129
00:08:38,505 --> 00:08:39,954
But what about Masuka?

130
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,905
Yeah, I'm the lead forensics
investigator.

131
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:46,771
Masuka's lab work is more pressing.
I need him to hold down the fort here.

132
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:49,274
He totally saw the she-male stuff.

133
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:50,787
So, what do you say?

134
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:53,722
I'll buy you lunch after.
Pork sandwich, right?

135
00:08:55,153 --> 00:08:57,048
- Yes. Sure.
- Good.

136
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,544
I figured it was time to get
a fresh perspective on the case.

137
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,674
Rumor has it you have a knack
for attracting serial killers.

138
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:06,005
I hear the same about you.

139
00:09:06,184 --> 00:09:09,832
Dexter also enjoys long walks
on the beach and foreign films.

140
00:09:10,577 --> 00:09:12,330
Then we got a lot to talk about.

141
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:36,988
He knocked me out.

142
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:40,960
Then when I woke up, I was tied up
in that train car over there.

143
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,711
- You said he used rope?
- Dumb fuck.

144
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,686
I stretched it out enough
so I can get my legs free

145
00:09:46,923 --> 00:09:48,272
and I got out of there.

146
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:51,176
Ran across the road, almost got hit
by that guy in the car.

147
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:54,297
<i>So, that's the alleged victim
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.</i>

148
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,133
<i>But I've never seen him
before in my life.</i>

149
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:03,938
O'Connor, Singer, make sure
you take pictures of those footprints.

150
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:05,758
- Hey, Dex.
- Hey.

151
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:09,479
So, the victim says the Butcher
held him in this train car.

152
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,958
Lundy wants you to search
for trace evidence.

153
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:15,138
- Your spidey sense tingling yet?
- We'll see when I get inside.

154
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:16,486
Take your time.

155
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,959
<i>We've never been this close
to this pendejo.</i>

156
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:21,384
<i>Closer than you think, amigo.</i>

157
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:36,310
<i>He may have borrowed my pseudonym,
but this guy doesn't know</i>

158
00:10:36,466 --> 00:10:38,662
<i>the first thing about my techniques.</i>

159
00:10:39,424 --> 00:10:40,424
<i>Amateur.</i>

160
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:43,156
Why do you think it was the Butcher?

161
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,940
He told me the Bay Harbor
Butcher's gonna clean up Miami.

162
00:10:47,343 --> 00:10:49,543
He said, "You're gonna get
what you deserve."

163
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:51,724
And what do you deserve, Mr. Henry?

164
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:55,233
Well, look.
The Butcher kills criminals, right?

165
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,792
I just got out of jail, you know.

166
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:01,867
Six years for aggravated assault
and home invasion, so...

167
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:05,315
He kills murderers.
You didn't kill anyone, did you?

168
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:08,299
Alright, I gave this old guy
a heart attack.

169
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:11,779
It's not like I was doing it
on purpose, alright?

170
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,787
I used to hit retirement homes,
communities.

171
00:11:15,163 --> 00:11:17,273
Snowbirds are easy targets.

172
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:20,919
And I don't do that anymore.
I did my time.

173
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,077
Your mother must be so proud.

174
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:27,884
I wanna check out
the train car with your brother.

175
00:11:29,207 --> 00:11:32,060
Why don't you keep an eye
on our friend here

176
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,134
while we confirm his story?

177
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,779
Sure.

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,255
<i>Killing tools left behind.
I'd never be this careless.</i>

179
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:46,262
<i>Whoever did this would
never pass Harry's muster.</i>

180
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:49,402
<i>Then again, neither would Harry.</i>

181
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,174
<i>He lied about my past,</i>

182
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:54,804
<i>he cheated on my foster mother
with my biological mother.</i>

183
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,432
<i>Maybe Lila's right.
It's time for a new set of standards.</i>

184
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,932
If you were the Bay Harbor Butcher,

185
00:12:01,353 --> 00:12:03,467
would you use a place like this?

186
00:12:06,114 --> 00:12:07,491
Actually, yes.

187
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,814
Location wise, it's not a bad choice.

188
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:11,445
It's quiet,

189
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:13,169
remote.

190
00:12:13,995 --> 00:12:16,677
Could use an upgrade in
the lighting department, but...

191
00:12:21,626 --> 00:12:23,379
You think this is our guy?

192
00:12:24,963 --> 00:12:25,950
Not exactly.

193
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:29,132
From what I understand,

194
00:12:29,312 --> 00:12:31,999
the conditions in this space
don't support his M.O.

195
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:34,067
It's filthy, for one thing.

196
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:38,028
Butcher's clean...

197
00:12:38,763 --> 00:12:39,814
orderly.

198
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,365
And some people would say compulsive.

199
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,221
Really? You think he's compulsive?

200
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,375
That doesn't fit either.

201
00:12:55,922 --> 00:12:57,462
A hatchet is sloppy.

202
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,621
The butcher uses precise
surgical instruments.

203
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:03,599
He's not that predictable.

204
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:07,776
Is he? Mixes it up.
Different tools every time.

205
00:13:08,043 --> 00:13:09,606
And never rope.

206
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:12,265
He uses duct tape and plastic wrap.

207
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:16,201
- Plastic wrap, how can you tell?
- Depression patterns in the skin.

208
00:13:18,184 --> 00:13:20,366
Maybe the butcher's having
an identity crisis.

209
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:25,257
- It's entirely possible.
- But not likely.

210
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:28,506
My guess is we're looking
for a vigilante

211
00:13:28,656 --> 00:13:30,980
inspired by the butcher's principles.

212
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,927
Bet he never thought
he'd be a role model.

213
00:13:34,283 --> 00:13:35,763
I bet you're right.

214
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:38,277
So,

215
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:40,891
any new leads on the real guy?

216
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:42,066
Not yet.

217
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:45,013
We hope the cameras'll
turn something up.

218
00:13:45,223 --> 00:13:47,041
- Cameras?
- In the marinas.

219
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:51,159
Put them in a couple of days ago
to monitor for suspicious activities.

220
00:13:52,047 --> 00:13:55,260
Good news for all those cops
who keep boats at Coral Cove.

221
00:13:55,448 --> 00:13:56,968
You've got one, too, right?

222
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:05,825
We've been needing a security
upgrade for a long time now.

223
00:14:08,045 --> 00:14:09,846
<i>Has Lundy seen me on the tape?</i>

224
00:14:10,014 --> 00:14:13,361
<i>Is that why he invited me
along today? To mess with me?</i>

225
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:22,431
Sorry if I was short with you
this morning.

226
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:25,633
I'm lost without my morning coffee.
- Whatever.

227
00:14:26,944 --> 00:14:29,718
How was your playdate
with Lundy? Did you bond?

228
00:14:30,695 --> 00:14:33,352
You didn't tell me they put up
security cameras at the marinas.

229
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,062
It's not like
they're doing us any good.

230
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,249
The station's computers
need an update

231
00:14:38,422 --> 00:14:40,477
so we can synch up with
Lundy's equipment.

232
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:44,651
- The cameras aren't recording?
- They are, but nobody saw the footage.

233
00:14:44,854 --> 00:14:46,875
Lundy said it should be fixed
by tonight.

234
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,413
That's a relief.

235
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:02,771
Your mom told me about
your cultural presentation at school.

236
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:05,293
Did your teacher give you
a country yet?

237
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:07,994
Saudi Arabia.

238
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:10,458
No. That's israel.

239
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,348
I won't tell the Saudis
you said that.

240
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:15,770
Looks like Cody's enjoying himself.

241
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:18,077
Dexter's very patient with him.

242
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:20,164
Dexter's a saint.

243
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,027
Where's Astor?

244
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,178
Uh, she's by the water.

245
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,917
I want to say goodbye.

246
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:29,649
I gotta go.
I was supposed to meet Lila

247
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,250
10 minutes ago.

248
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:34,327
Who's Lila?

249
00:15:35,127 --> 00:15:36,178
His sponsor.

250
00:15:36,546 --> 00:15:38,084
Really? A woman?

251
00:15:40,487 --> 00:15:43,588
Dexter's sponsor is a woman.
Is that a problem?

252
00:15:44,645 --> 00:15:45,913
Is she attractive?

253
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,287
- Mom...
- I'm just curious.

254
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:51,141
Is she?

255
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,211
I have an idea.

256
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,553
Why don't you and Lila
have dinner with us?

257
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,240
That's very kind of you,
Gail, but...

258
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:02,744
I think it'd be really nice
if we got to know the woman

259
00:16:02,904 --> 00:16:04,460
you spend so much time with.

260
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:08,143
- Mom, they're doing step work.
- But they have to eat, right?

261
00:16:14,526 --> 00:16:15,975
Here. Let me help.

262
00:16:16,248 --> 00:16:17,284
Thank you.

263
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:23,917
So lovely of you to have me over.

264
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:29,043
Now I can put names to faces.
Dexter talks about you all the time.

265
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:31,933
Good things, I hope.

266
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:35,968
Dexter never says a bad word
about anyone.

267
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:48,515
Tell me, Lila.

268
00:16:49,022 --> 00:16:51,298
What exactly
are you recovering from?

269
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:55,886
I'm a meth addict, sober five years.

270
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:58,346
I don't know much about meth.

271
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,872
- Rita's ex-Husband shot heroin.
- Like Dexter.

272
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,660
Guess we know your type, don't we?

273
00:17:06,213 --> 00:17:07,981
Just can't seem to help myself.

274
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,112
You have nothing to worry about...
with Dexter, I mean.

275
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,074
I'm sitting right here.

276
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,328
- I didn't mean to imply...
- No. I completely understand.

277
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:22,928
Rita's your little baby.

278
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,082
You have every right to be concerned.

279
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,221
But if I can reassure you,
Dexter's doing incredibly well.

280
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:34,192
Well, I'm happy to hear that.

281
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:36,962
And I'm sure it's got everything
to do with the two of you.

282
00:17:37,146 --> 00:17:38,929
He tells me you're very supportive.

283
00:17:39,749 --> 00:17:41,394
Dexter's lucky to have you.

284
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:43,850
Well... that's very sweet
of you to say.

285
00:17:46,614 --> 00:17:48,521
So, tell us more about yourself.

286
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:51,088
Dexter tells me you're an artist.

287
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:53,318
Yeah, she does amazing things
with a...

288
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:55,403
blowtorch. What's it called?

289
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,744
Talent.

290
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:03,745
But... I'm not
the only artist at the table.

291
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:10,877
- Since when?
- It's not really art.

292
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:14,464
She's talking about a blood-spatter
pattern she took from work.

293
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:17,676
What kind of career choice
is blood spatter, exactly?

294
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,715
He helps catch criminals, mother.

295
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:26,768
And it makes perfect sense, what with
Dexter's mother and everything.

296
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:31,959
You know...

297
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,445
she's...

298
00:18:34,194 --> 00:18:35,194
... dead.

299
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,137
Forgot the bread.

300
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:45,954
Dinner was fantastic, Rita.

301
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:48,415
And this dessert...

302
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,931
I never thought I'd say this,
but I kind of like her.

303
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,144
Yeah, me too.

304
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,999
She's really helping me.

305
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:06,086
I wish she didn't have
to help you tonight.

306
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,649
Why? What are you thinking?

307
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:12,707
- My mom could watch the kids.
- I have to swing by the office tonight.

308
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:16,139
I need to take care
of something really important.

309
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:19,993
I mean, can't it wait till morning?

310
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:22,079
I promise we'll go straight to bed.

311
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:24,248
You're very convincing,

312
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:26,723
but it needs to get done tonight.

313
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:29,849
Just give me an hour, okay?

314
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:32,201
Meet you back at my place?

315
00:19:39,727 --> 00:19:42,195
I still think it's funny
you write children's books.

316
00:19:42,378 --> 00:19:44,019
Yeah, a big, tough guy like me

317
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:47,185
should be do something manly,
like wrangling cattle.

318
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,533
I don't even know any kids' books.

319
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,028
My dad told me cop stories before bed.

320
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:56,182
It was really the only alone
time I ever got with him.

321
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,736
You okay?

322
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:01,196
Yeah.

323
00:20:02,936 --> 00:20:05,742
Sorry, just an annoying day at work.

324
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:12,082
You know the FBI guy
I was talking about?

325
00:20:13,302 --> 00:20:16,144
I was really starting to feel
like I was his go-to girl,

326
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:17,287
But...

327
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,674
he realized Dexter
is the superior Morgan.

328
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:22,717
I should be used to it, you know?

329
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:25,544
It was like that with my dad, work.

330
00:20:26,134 --> 00:20:28,098
I guess I hoped Lundy
would be different.

331
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,225
- Why?
- I don't know.

332
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,760
I respect him.

333
00:20:35,189 --> 00:20:36,656
He's great at his job,

334
00:20:37,765 --> 00:20:38,913
supersmart,

335
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:45,251
And, like, funny, but in this really
dry way where he doesn't even know it.

336
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,566
You love him.

337
00:20:48,387 --> 00:20:49,340
What?

338
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,373
You totally have a crush on Grundy.

339
00:20:53,634 --> 00:20:55,917
- Lundy.
- Now you're getting touchy about it.

340
00:20:56,178 --> 00:20:58,060
I don't have a crush on him.

341
00:20:58,336 --> 00:20:59,763
He's like my dad.

342
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,779
Except I spent my life trying
to get my dad to notice me,

343
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:05,390
and he actually pays attention
to what I say.

344
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:07,137
And grundy loves you.

345
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:08,620
Oh, fuck off.

346
00:21:27,864 --> 00:21:29,868
<i>Lundy's good - Double-Locked...</i>

347
00:21:31,463 --> 00:21:33,529
<i>and a bit beyond my expertise.</i>

348
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:36,815
<i>I could try to crack it open,
but in my own station...</i>

349
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:39,596
<i>too risky.</i>

350
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:53,855
I can do this more often now
that my mom's in town.

351
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,823
I feel like we're being bad.

352
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:02,312
Bad...

353
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:04,144
Bad is good.

354
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,113
Let the machine get it.

355
00:22:09,052 --> 00:22:11,344
<i>Hey, Dex, just calling to check in.</i>

356
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:13,596
<i>Thought we could do
the debriefing on dinner.</i>

357
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,580
<i>I thought it went well, don't you?</i>

358
00:22:15,841 --> 00:22:16,974
I'd say so.

359
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:20,267
<i>Rita's sweet, very Martha Stewart.</i>

360
00:22:21,657 --> 00:22:23,046
I love Martha Stewart.

361
00:22:23,738 --> 00:22:27,425
<i>God, her mum, she's got quite
the rod up her ass, doesn't she?</i>

362
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:29,048
<i>By the way, I am such a twat.</i>

363
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:31,595
<i>I can't believe I almost
slipped up about your mum.</i>

364
00:22:31,827 --> 00:22:35,189
<i>At least, I didn't spill the beans
about our road trip.</i>

365
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:37,324
Don't you dare!

366
00:22:37,508 --> 00:22:39,751
<i>Can you imagine Rita's face
if I told her you and I</i>

367
00:22:39,912 --> 00:22:41,815
<i>spent the night together in a hotel?</i>

368
00:22:42,714 --> 00:22:43,771
<i>Anyway...</i>

369
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:46,319
You and Lila stayed
in a hotel together?

370
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,322
- We had adjoining rooms.
- Adjoining rooms? Right.

371
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:51,419
God, I am such an idiot.

372
00:22:51,616 --> 00:22:54,692
I can't believe I defended you while
you were sleeping with another woman.

373
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,704
Wait.

374
00:22:55,965 --> 00:22:58,707
I thought you were different than Paul,
but you're the same.

375
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:01,911
Actually, you're worse.
You made me trust you.

376
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:06,381
- Please, just let me explain.
- I've had it!

377
00:23:06,642 --> 00:23:10,024
I have been patient and understanding,
but there's only so much I can take.

378
00:23:10,238 --> 00:23:13,313
You're a liar and a cheat,
and I am through.

379
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,317
It's over, Dexter!

380
00:23:22,283 --> 00:23:24,441
<i>Tracy Jenkins was given the liver
of a 9-year-old...</i>

381
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:26,831
Hi, honey.

382
00:23:27,842 --> 00:23:30,280
I thought you were spending
the night at Dexter's.

383
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:31,948
We had a fight.

384
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,951
- I think we broke up.
- What?

385
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:41,644
Mama's here.

386
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:52,052
<i>Yesterday I was so hopeful.</i>

387
00:23:52,436 --> 00:23:54,383
<i>A new me, a new life.</i>

388
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:58,058
<i>But a life without Rita
seems strange.</i>

389
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:03,271
What in the name of fuck
are you doing up so early?

390
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:06,114
I got to get to the station.

391
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:19,881
Are you okay?

392
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:22,639
You seem weird.

393
00:24:22,914 --> 00:24:24,417
Weirder than usual.

394
00:24:25,311 --> 00:24:27,504
Rita broke up with me last night.

395
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,005
Seriously?

396
00:24:32,621 --> 00:24:34,089
What happened?

397
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:37,077
It's a long story.

398
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:38,578
I've got time.

399
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,351
Yeah... but I don't.

400
00:24:42,368 --> 00:24:43,895
Cliff Notes.

401
00:24:44,756 --> 00:24:47,976
She thinks I did something bad,
but I didn't.

402
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,569
Did you tell her that?

403
00:24:51,063 --> 00:24:54,437
I tried, but she dumped me
before I had a chance to explain.

404
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,867
She said, "It's over," and left.

405
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:00,830
- Did you go after her?
- Was I supposed to?

406
00:25:01,076 --> 00:25:02,504
You're such a guy.

407
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:06,120
When I get pissed, I say stuff
I don't mean all the time. "I hate you,"

408
00:25:06,323 --> 00:25:07,335
"I faked it,"

409
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:09,629
- "You're hung like a grape."
- You lost me.

410
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:13,008
When Rita said, "it's over," I'm sure
she didn't actually mean it.

411
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,970
Stop being a douche bag
and go fight for her.

412
00:25:18,566 --> 00:25:20,175
She's fucking perfect.

413
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:21,937
I know.

414
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:37,012
Sure, I'll be right there.

415
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,601
Yeah. I'll tell him.

416
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:48,691
Who's that, Gabriel?

417
00:25:48,971 --> 00:25:50,050
No, Lundy.

418
00:25:50,447 --> 00:25:53,916
He's holding a meeting at the station
about the bay harbor case.

419
00:25:54,643 --> 00:25:57,025
He specifically requested
that you be there.

420
00:25:57,202 --> 00:25:59,930
<i>I missed my window.
He's already seen the footage.</i>

421
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:03,725
- Me? Why?
- Because you're his new butt buddy.

422
00:26:06,085 --> 00:26:07,462
You gonna be okay?

423
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:10,106
Check back with me later.

424
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,990
<i>The show has already started, but have
they seen the feature presentation?</i>

425
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:22,911
<i>Bane of the Bay Harbor Butcher,
starring Dexter Morgan as himself?</i>

426
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:24,496
It's all synched up?

427
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:28,917
Yep, you can watch streaming video
of the marina right now if you want to.

428
00:26:29,336 --> 00:26:32,269
Yeah. Maybe you'll get to see
some pontoon poon.

429
00:26:34,374 --> 00:26:36,165
Did you... need something?

430
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:38,802
<i>That's not my marina...</i>

431
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:40,063
<i>yet.</i>

432
00:26:40,578 --> 00:26:42,973
<i>I'll be making my on-screen debut
soon enough.</i>

433
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,564
<i>I've got to find a way
to get to those video files.</i>

434
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,709
The media frenzy about the Butcher

435
00:26:47,913 --> 00:26:49,980
has come back to bite us.
Big surprise.

436
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:52,524
Now we've got a wannabe
vigilante out there

437
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,944
Who liked the Butcher's style
and thought,

438
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:57,577
"Hey, I should try this at home."

439
00:26:59,111 --> 00:27:01,241
He attacked this man - John Henry,

440
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:03,952
Ex-convict, preyed on the elderly.

441
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,328
It gets better.

442
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:09,207
<i>I have already received reports
of ads on Craig's list</i>

443
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:12,711
and coffee-shop bulletin boards
requesting the services of the Butcher.

444
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:15,779
People think they've found
their own personal Batman.

445
00:27:16,638 --> 00:27:18,194
This is not good news.

446
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,347
If this kind of thing catches on,
We're looking at an epidemic.

447
00:27:21,524 --> 00:27:24,327
- Kind of like herpes.
- Fuck, Masuka, I'm trying to listen.

448
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,828
One in four, Morgan. One in four.

449
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:29,647
Vigilante justice is
domestic terrorism.

450
00:27:30,118 --> 00:27:33,356
And terrorism prevention
is the FBI's top priority.

451
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,692
I've done my best to be diplomatic,

452
00:27:36,776 --> 00:27:39,244
but if we lose one life
to a vigilante,

453
00:27:39,834 --> 00:27:43,408
I will pull this case from Miami Metro
and hand it over in full

454
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:45,535
to the FBI. It's a promise.

455
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:48,788
<i>That's a disaster.
It'd be raining feds in Miami.</i>

456
00:27:48,952 --> 00:27:51,712
So, if we want to keep
the investigation here,

457
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,428
we need to nip this in the bud,

458
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:56,008
make an example
of our would-be vigilante.

459
00:27:56,294 --> 00:27:58,707
The last thing we need is
a bunch of weekend warriors...

460
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,613
I think I found a suspect.

461
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,369
Could you?

462
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:10,972
Ken Olson.

463
00:28:11,177 --> 00:28:14,841
Olson's mother was hurt badly
in a home-invasion robbery.

464
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:16,993
Guess who hurt her.

465
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:19,479
Please, tell me John Henry,
our train-Car victim.

466
00:28:19,756 --> 00:28:22,148
I think Olson attacked him
for revenge.

467
00:28:22,353 --> 00:28:24,292
- Any evidence?
- Only circumstantial.

468
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:27,236
- Can you get him here for questioning?
- Can't find him.

469
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:30,472
OK. Leak this to some
of your media contacts.

470
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:34,479
Let's beat this guy out of the bushes.
Nice work, detective. Let's get moving.

471
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:37,404
I need hard evidence on this
Olson character, and fast.

472
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:40,025
And if you can find the guy,
even better.

473
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,577
<i>The full force of the FBI -
That's the last thing I need.</i>

474
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:45,508
<i>I've got to make sure Lundy
gets his man...</i>

475
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:48,704
<i>after I figure out a way
to erase the marina files</i>

476
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:50,440
<i>and make up with my girlfriend.</i>

477
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,221
<i>Then maybe I'll tackle world hunger
'cause things can't really get worse.</i>

478
00:28:56,584 --> 00:28:58,819
<i>Another shipment's coming in
tomorrow.</i>

479
00:28:59,052 --> 00:28:59,954
<i>Cocaine.</i>

480
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:01,212
<i>How much?</i>

481
00:29:01,497 --> 00:29:03,229
<i>300 bricks, give or take.</i>

482
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:04,847
Turn it off.

483
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,952
<i>That wasn't part
of our agreement, Harry.</i>

484
00:29:07,255 --> 00:29:08,799
I said turn it off.

485
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:13,511
I heard what you said.
I just don't take orders from you.

486
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:16,454
Is there a reason you're
in my lab, sergeant Doakes?

487
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:19,335
Is there a reason you're listening
to tapes as old as you are?

488
00:29:21,015 --> 00:29:23,227
I had a little talk with your sister.

489
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:25,444
Turns out she didn't know
you were in program.

490
00:29:25,703 --> 00:29:29,261
- Anonymous, sergeant.
- How long did you say you been clean?

491
00:29:29,755 --> 00:29:32,656
Actually, I didn't because it's
none of your goddamn business.

492
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:35,905
So, if I were to take a hair
from your desk and run it for drugs,

493
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,972
it would come back positive, right?

494
00:29:38,906 --> 00:29:41,857
Because why would someone
pretend to be an addict if he's not...

495
00:29:43,107 --> 00:29:46,146
unless he's got something
a hell of a lot worse to hide?

496
00:29:46,392 --> 00:29:47,335
Back...

497
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:49,358
the fuck...

498
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:50,980
off.

499
00:29:51,486 --> 00:29:53,987
You want to hit me? Go for it.

500
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,376
I've been waiting for a chance
to take your ass out.

501
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,460
I know how you feel, sergeant.

502
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:19,203
I want to file a formal
complaint against Doakes.

503
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,221
Jesus, Dexter, the two of you...

504
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:23,035
He crossed the line, lieutenant!

505
00:30:23,216 --> 00:30:25,926
He broke into my lab.
He went through my personal things.

506
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,629
He threatened me. He's probably
gonna start tailing me again.

507
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:32,106
- Sergeant Doakes tailed you?
- For weeks, maybe longer.

508
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:38,041
OK, you have every right
to file a complaint,

509
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:41,144
but before you do that, I'd like
the chance to talk to James myself.

510
00:30:41,889 --> 00:30:43,624
He's really not much of a talker.

511
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:46,625
I'm asking you, as a personal
favor to me, to hold off.

512
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,549
Can you do that?

513
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:52,045
Yeah.

514
00:30:53,295 --> 00:30:56,096
Okay, in the meantime,
I strongly encourage you

515
00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,216
to take a break for a couple of hours.
Just go somewhere. Cool off.

516
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:01,242
No.

517
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,140
- Excuse me?
- I need to be here, lieutenant.

518
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:06,275
This is really not a good time
for me to leave.

519
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:08,630
It isn't a suggestion, Dexter.
It's an order.

520
00:31:08,838 --> 00:31:10,382
Clear the station. Clear your head.

521
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,564
I don't want to see you here
until after lunch.

522
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:16,064
Understood?

523
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,637
Blimey, look at you.

524
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,307
You wanna tell me what's going on?

525
00:31:54,617 --> 00:31:55,820
What's going on?

526
00:31:56,033 --> 00:31:57,749
Being the new me sucks.

527
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:01,615
I'm about to be found out
at work for what I am.

528
00:32:01,834 --> 00:32:03,583
For what I really am.

529
00:32:04,249 --> 00:32:05,783
And I can't do anything to stop it

530
00:32:05,961 --> 00:32:08,499
because I got kicked
out of the office to cool off.

531
00:32:08,784 --> 00:32:10,717
It seems to be going well for you.

532
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:13,779
Add to that the fact
that Rita heard your message

533
00:32:14,092 --> 00:32:15,515
and dumped me last night.

534
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,746
I tried to explain to her nothing
happened, but she wouldn't listen to me.

535
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:22,181
- Nobody fucking listens to me!
- Listen, you need to calm down.

536
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:24,680
Last time, you came back
covered in blood.

537
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,696
So?

538
00:32:26,469 --> 00:32:28,705
You said I was supposed
to feel my feelings.

539
00:32:28,946 --> 00:32:31,133
Now I tell you to get them
under control.

540
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:34,315
- You don't understand.
- Why don't you make me?

541
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:33,638
Which step was that?

542
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,036
The naughty one.

543
00:33:46,756 --> 00:33:48,369
What are you thinking?

544
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:54,761
Absolutely nothing.

545
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:02,007
I guess we found a way to quiet
the voices in your head.

546
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:04,559
I guess so.

547
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:11,974
How do you feel?

548
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,146
Much better...

549
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,848
actually.

550
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:21,912
I guess I must be
a good sponsor after all.

551
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,169
Definitely.

552
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:37,008
And where are you off to?

553
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:40,236
I still have that thing at work
to deal with.

554
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:42,284
Well, come back tomorrow.

555
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:45,394
I promise you some serious recovery.

556
00:34:55,866 --> 00:34:56,699
Hello?

557
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,066
<i>Dexter, hey.</i>

558
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:01,913
- You at work?
- I will be soon.

559
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:04,948
I was just taking a break.

560
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:07,003
<i>What's going on?</i>

561
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:09,304
I'd really like
to get together and talk.

562
00:35:09,473 --> 00:35:11,919
I don't like how our last
conversation ended.

563
00:35:12,098 --> 00:35:13,064
Me neither.

564
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:16,695
<i>You said you wanted to explain,
and I owe it to you to hear you out.</i>

565
00:35:16,953 --> 00:35:18,067
I owe it to us.

566
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:22,056
Okay.

567
00:35:23,438 --> 00:35:25,611
So, can you come over after work?

568
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,480
Sure.

569
00:35:28,995 --> 00:35:29,882
Great.

570
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:35,024
<i>Apparently my new life
involves a love triangle.</i>

571
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:36,388
<i>I'm that guy.</i>

572
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,488
<i>The voices are back. Excellent.</i>

573
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:54,106
You were tailing Dexter?
What the hell were you thinking?

574
00:35:54,246 --> 00:35:56,569
If you wanted to have lunch,
you could have asked.

575
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,218
If Dexter files a complaint, you will be
kicked off the force, end of story.

576
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:04,006
There's a reason he hasn't
reported me until now.

577
00:36:04,149 --> 00:36:06,090
He's hiding something.
I can feel it.

578
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:08,642
Is this another one
of your conspiracy theories?

579
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:11,224
It's instinct and a hell
of a lot of experience.

580
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:14,280
I've spent years looking
the enemy in the face,

581
00:36:14,459 --> 00:36:16,819
and I'm telling you
Morgan is dangerous.

582
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:20,830
Your instincts haven't been
that great these days, James.

583
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,325
Two shootings in the last six months,

584
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:25,075
Stalking a police employee...

585
00:36:25,364 --> 00:36:26,594
Listen to me.

586
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:31,067
Morgan lied
about the Ice-Truck Killer.

587
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,205
That crack pipe knew
more than he told us.

588
00:36:33,345 --> 00:36:36,478
He was trying to protect his sister.
You of all people should understand.

589
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,266
I followed him to an N.A. meeting.
That asshole lied about that too.

590
00:36:41,012 --> 00:36:42,801
- You're obsessed.
- I'm not.

591
00:36:43,012 --> 00:36:45,382
You are,
and I need you to see it...

592
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:47,595
as your boss and as your friend.

593
00:36:48,762 --> 00:36:50,305
We've been through this before.

594
00:36:50,484 --> 00:36:52,819
Last time it cost you
our relationship.

595
00:36:53,018 --> 00:36:56,184
This time it's gonna get you
kicked off the force or worse.

596
00:36:56,561 --> 00:36:58,153
I'll take my chances.

597
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:03,949
Let it go.

598
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:05,798
I mean it.

599
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:07,685
Leave Dexter alone.

600
00:37:16,543 --> 00:37:19,798
The Batista suspect come in yet,
the wannabe vigilante?

601
00:37:20,027 --> 00:37:22,917
Olson just came in.
Saw himself on the 3:00 news

602
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,061
and showed up with his lawyer.

603
00:37:26,366 --> 00:37:28,254
I hope we nail his ass to the wall.

604
00:37:28,895 --> 00:37:30,589
I love it when you talk dirty.

605
00:37:34,777 --> 00:37:36,471
- Morgan?
- Right here.

606
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:38,266
The other Morgan.

607
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:41,073
I didn't know you were a smoker.

608
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:46,440
Have you seen Dexter Morgan?

609
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:48,738
He's on a break. Why?

610
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:51,623
Detective Batista's got
a suspect in interview room 1.

611
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,735
We think he's the would-be vigilante
who attacked our train-car victim.

612
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:57,142
I need him to take some scrapings
for evidence.

613
00:37:57,302 --> 00:38:00,273
You want to use Dexter again?
Isn't Masuka on your task force?

614
00:38:03,335 --> 00:38:04,551
Yes, he is.

615
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,957
So, Mr. Olson, the man who assaulted
your mom was attacked yesterday.

616
00:38:11,212 --> 00:38:13,344
- Did you know that?
- Nope.

617
00:38:13,649 --> 00:38:16,771
Can't say I'm upset, though.
Son of a bitch almost killed my mom.

618
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:18,576
My client's emotional, detective.

619
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:21,933
- I'm sure he's not trying to say...
- Any idea who might have done it?

620
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:24,473
I don't know.
Maybe it was the Butcher.

621
00:38:25,708 --> 00:38:27,045
I think a guy like that

622
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:29,734
should be running the police
force, not hiding from it.

623
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:32,550
- Is this a lion or a hippo?
- I think it's a lion.

624
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,322
Tastes like a hippo.

625
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,295
- Animal cracker?
- No, thank you.

626
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,419
What do you do for a living,
Mr. Olson?

627
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:45,487
I just lost my job.

628
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:47,246
That's too bad.

629
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,075
I see that you have
a minor assault record

630
00:38:51,294 --> 00:38:53,091
and no alibi for yesterday morning.

631
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:55,557
I'm sure my client didn't
realize he needed one.

632
00:38:55,762 --> 00:38:57,801
You have a girlfriend, Mr. Olson?

633
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,860
She just broke up with me.
Why, you interested?

634
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,447
Just curious.

635
00:39:02,877 --> 00:39:04,209
Now, this is a lion.

636
00:39:06,172 --> 00:39:08,731
Alright, let me keep this all straight.

637
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:10,334
No job,

638
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:12,017
no relationship.

639
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:14,530
You got guns
and a minor assault record.

640
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:18,834
- And I voted for Bush both times.
- Sorry, were you getting at something?

641
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:22,618
What he's getting at, Mr. Novik,
is your client fits the 4-point profile

642
00:39:22,913 --> 00:39:26,632
of someone who'd commit a vigilante
offense. You're a ticking time bomb.

643
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:31,005
You ask me, you just needed a reason
to take the law into your own hands.

644
00:39:31,145 --> 00:39:33,285
And the butcher
was the perfect excuse.

645
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:36,172
- You don't know me.
- We know you attacked John Henry.

646
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:39,374
You need proof to make those
kinds of accusations, detective.

647
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,461
You heard the man, detective.
We've got work to do.

648
00:39:44,263 --> 00:39:48,010
Make yourself comfortable, Mr. Olson.
We're just getting started with you.

649
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:00,291
<i>That's my marina.</i>

650
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:04,515
<i>And in less than 30 minutes,
I'll be on that screen.</i>

651
00:40:05,908 --> 00:40:08,323
<i>I need to take care of this,
and fast.</i>

652
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:10,930
<i>I'm out of time.</i>

653
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:14,003
<i>I need an idea, a sign,</i>

654
00:40:14,199 --> 00:40:15,237
<i>anything.</i>

655
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,529
<i>What would the old Dexter do?</i>

656
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:23,177
<i>Definitely not that.</i>

657
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:27,371
<i>No security cameras.</i>

658
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,360
<i>Apparently the new Dexter's stuck
in high school.</i>

659
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,220
<i>Maybe I am a late bloomer.</i>

660
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,805
A fire drill? Are you kidding?
We have work to do.

661
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:49,336
It's probably one of those kids
in the bullpen.

662
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:51,761
It's something I would have done.

663
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:54,662
Well, at least it stopped raining.

664
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:17,984
All clear. Everybody out.

665
00:41:18,586 --> 00:41:20,410
All clear! Everybody out!

666
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:24,248
Respect the vest.

667
00:41:24,446 --> 00:41:26,521
Don't make me take out my hose.

668
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:37,047
<i>Like it never happened.</i>

669
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,703
<i>If only the rest of life
were so easy to figure out.</i>

670
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:45,538
Where you headed?

671
00:41:45,678 --> 00:41:47,602
I figured you'd be 1st
to ogle the firemen.

672
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:51,072
I have to arrange protective custody
for that fucking train-car victim.

673
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:53,292
- Why?
- 'Cause we have nothing on Olson,

674
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:56,040
not even enough to get a warrant
to search his place.

675
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,796
Is that Olson's file?

676
00:41:59,171 --> 00:42:01,720
If we don't get something soon,
Lundy'll have to let him go,

677
00:42:01,902 --> 00:42:03,800
meaning Olson will kill again,

678
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,531
meaning we lose
the Butcher case to the FBI,

679
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,899
- meaning we're fucked.
- Some more than others.

680
00:42:09,213 --> 00:42:11,377
No shit. Till Lundy showed up,

681
00:42:11,556 --> 00:42:14,402
I felt like the dipshit who
slept with the ice-Truck killer.

682
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:17,564
If he pulls the plug, I go back
to being the resident retard.

683
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,240
Chin up little sister,

684
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:21,907
these things have a way
of working themselves out.

685
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,203
<i>I just have to find
a piece of evidence</i>

686
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,207
<i>to make sure Lundy
catches Olson fair and square.</i>

687
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:17,187
<i>Looks like I have a fan club,
membership of one.</i>

688
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:37,293
Why you so interested in the Butcher?

689
00:43:37,436 --> 00:43:39,117
Who the fuck are you?

690
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:42,110
Holy shit, you're him, aren't you?

691
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:45,093
Stop. Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

692
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:48,324
I'm like you. I take out criminals.

693
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,663
You mean you try... pitifully.

694
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:53,324
No, that was just the last one.

695
00:43:53,512 --> 00:43:54,562
He got away.

696
00:43:54,702 --> 00:43:56,816
I should have never made it personal.

697
00:43:56,977 --> 00:43:59,408
- You've killed others?
- That's I'm telling you.

698
00:43:59,798 --> 00:44:03,035
First was a drug dealer -
I ran him down with my car.

699
00:44:03,448 --> 00:44:06,202
It felt... It felt fucking great,

700
00:44:06,663 --> 00:44:09,488
Even better than the free stash
I got off him.

701
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:11,855
And then, this guy at work

702
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:15,372
found out I was fucking his wife.
He started to beat on her,

703
00:44:15,512 --> 00:44:17,638
so I pushed him down a stairwell.

704
00:44:17,828 --> 00:44:20,921
The cops thought it was
an accident, but it was me.

705
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:23,783
See, you can't kill me.

706
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:25,517
I wasn't going to...

707
00:44:29,008 --> 00:44:30,008
until now.

708
00:44:42,624 --> 00:44:45,295
This is what the kill room
should look like.

709
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:48,088
the inside of a big plastic bag.

710
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:53,459
Of course, I spent hours working
in this train car yesterday,

711
00:44:53,638 --> 00:44:56,213
so I'm not too worried
about trace evidence.

712
00:44:57,721 --> 00:45:00,342
To your credit,
your location was well chosen.

713
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:03,708
It just needed
a little cleaning, a few lights,

714
00:45:03,911 --> 00:45:05,639
proper tools, of course.

715
00:45:06,966 --> 00:45:09,085
- I did it because of you.
- No.

716
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:12,984
You attacked those people
because you wanted to.

717
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:15,247
- You inspired me...
- I didn't.

718
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:17,867
- ... with your principles.
- They're not mine.

719
00:45:18,064 --> 00:45:20,641
- Of course they are!
- Don't tell me who I am.

720
00:45:22,102 --> 00:45:24,768
All my life, I've done what
someone else said I should do,

721
00:45:24,946 --> 00:45:28,214
been who he said I should be. I followed
his rules, I stuck to his plan.

722
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,915
I never stopped to think about
what I wanted and what I needed.

723
00:45:32,538 --> 00:45:35,471
And now I don't know
who I'm supposed to be.

724
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:39,938
I'll tell you one thing, though.
I'm not the Bay Harbor Butcher.

725
00:45:40,673 --> 00:45:42,712
I'm certainly not
anybody's role model.

726
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:45,502
What are you talking about then?
Who are you?

727
00:45:45,695 --> 00:45:47,791
I'll let you know
when I figure that out.

728
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:49,890
Though, I got to tell you,

729
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:52,266
I am well on my way, because...

730
00:45:53,474 --> 00:45:55,959
as sure as I'm standing here,
I don't need to kill you.

731
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:57,288
That's a relief.

732
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:59,396
I mean that need
that comes from within

733
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:01,488
that always drives me to this table

734
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,388
I don't feel it.

735
00:46:07,352 --> 00:46:08,694
I'm in recovery.

736
00:46:09,004 --> 00:46:12,684
- I knew you weren't gonna kill me.
- No, I will kill you. I have to.

737
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:16,162
I just don't need to.
It's very empowering.

738
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:46,343
Anyone in there, make yourself known!

739
00:46:58,908 --> 00:46:59,710
Arm.

740
00:47:00,675 --> 00:47:01,441
Leg.

741
00:47:02,189 --> 00:47:03,029
Head.

742
00:47:05,351 --> 00:47:07,499
It's Olson, gift-wrapped.

743
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:10,205
It would seem the Butcher
is watching us,

744
00:47:10,345 --> 00:47:13,496
- tracking the investigation.
- That wouldn't be too hard to do.

745
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:16,206
But why'd he leave the victim's
body for us? It's a 1st.

746
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,933
Probably didn't take too kindly
to the idea of Olson imitating him.

747
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:22,693
It's a good way to
discourage others, don't you think?

748
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,493
I hate to say it, but he
probably did us a favor.

749
00:47:25,699 --> 00:47:28,893
Take the law into your own hands,
the Bay Harbor boogeyman'll get you.

750
00:47:29,123 --> 00:47:31,305
It's the 1st time
we've set foot in a place

751
00:47:31,502 --> 00:47:34,695
where the Bay Harbor Butcher's
actually been. Let's get busy.

752
00:47:41,977 --> 00:47:44,905
- Anybody seen Lundy?
- Over there on the phone.

753
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:46,847
He's talking to D.C., I think.

754
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,187
Shit. Is he gonna
pull the case from us?

755
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:57,628
Sure, have Robinson call me.
He's got my cell.

756
00:47:59,438 --> 00:48:01,512
I came here for privacy,
officer Morgan.

757
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:04,490
- Sorry.
- Too much background noise over there.

758
00:48:04,692 --> 00:48:06,504
Hearing's the first thing to go.

759
00:48:06,767 --> 00:48:10,114
- Or is it memory? I always forget.
- You gonna pull the case from us?

760
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:13,504
- You said if anybody died...
- At the hands of a vigilante.

761
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:17,087
This was our killer.
I'm afraid you're still stuck with me.

762
00:48:17,924 --> 00:48:20,196
Will your brother be here tomorrow?

763
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:22,731
Yeah, I think so.

764
00:48:24,077 --> 00:48:26,873
I'll tell him you want him
within shouting distance.

765
00:48:28,191 --> 00:48:29,693
What just happened?

766
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:32,573
No, it's cool. He's always been
the family superstar.

767
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:35,286
- Who? Dexter, your new go-to guy.

768
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:40,182
This isn't about Dexter. It's about
Masuka. I can't stand him.

769
00:48:41,417 --> 00:48:44,137
If I hear one more titty joke,
I could punch him in the face.

770
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,264
Really?

771
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:52,453
<i>Any north unit, request has been made
for 42 escort from Orange belt to J.M.S.</i>

772
00:49:01,475 --> 00:49:02,298
Hey.

773
00:49:04,315 --> 00:49:05,460
Come on in.

774
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:07,742
Sit down.

775
00:49:13,749 --> 00:49:16,521
I was angry before
when you tried to explain.

776
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:18,273
This time I'll listen.

777
00:49:21,818 --> 00:49:24,698
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the road trip.

778
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:27,154
Lila...

779
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:31,495
came with me to Naples...

780
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:32,972
as my sponsor.

781
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,386
That's all.

782
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:36,860
Why would you need her in Naples?

783
00:49:37,149 --> 00:49:39,383
You remember
when I went out of town?

784
00:49:39,652 --> 00:49:42,102
I went to find the man
who killed my mother.

785
00:49:42,573 --> 00:49:44,380
What are you talking about?

786
00:49:45,081 --> 00:49:47,699
A lot of stuff has been
coming up for me in recovery,

787
00:49:47,878 --> 00:49:49,899
things I never thought
I'd deal with.

788
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:53,919
I watched my mother die

789
00:49:54,702 --> 00:49:56,821
- when I was 3.
- God.

790
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:00,861
I'm so sorry.

791
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:02,550
She was murdered

792
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:04,606
in front of me.

793
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:06,576
I saw it happen.

794
00:50:08,911 --> 00:50:11,716
I think that has a lot to do
with why I'm...

795
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:16,734
... why I do the things I do.

796
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:20,537
Of course.
Of course, it makes sense.

797
00:50:21,654 --> 00:50:24,355
I found the man who killed her
in Naples.

798
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:28,117
I thought maybe if I talked to him,
I could find some kind...

799
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,159
of closure.

800
00:50:31,376 --> 00:50:33,790
That's why Lila came with me.
For support.

801
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,886
- What?
- This was a huge moment

802
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:42,114
in your life, Dexter...

803
00:50:43,007 --> 00:50:45,052
and you chose to include Lila

804
00:50:45,499 --> 00:50:46,617
but not me.

805
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:50,027
- She's my sponsor.
- And I'm your girlfriend.

806
00:50:50,633 --> 00:50:52,993
I was afraid
you wouldn't understand.

807
00:51:03,744 --> 00:51:04,585
So...

808
00:51:05,382 --> 00:51:07,103
let me try to understand now.

809
00:51:08,844 --> 00:51:09,980
You and Lila

810
00:51:10,845 --> 00:51:14,216
went away together
as sponsor and sponsee.

811
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:19,449
And you really did have
adjoining rooms.

812
00:51:21,927 --> 00:51:23,715
So you didn't have sex that night?

813
00:51:31,644 --> 00:51:32,894
Not that night.

814
00:51:38,801 --> 00:51:39,601
Leave.

815
00:51:40,996 --> 00:51:41,996
Rita...

816
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:46,382
No, please! Leave now.

817
00:52:03,364 --> 00:52:06,569
<i>There was a time I would have done
anything to protect Rita.</i>

818
00:52:07,126 --> 00:52:08,843
<i>I would have even lied.</i>

819
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:11,134
<i>But today I told the truth...</i>

820
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,635
<i>even though I knew she'd get hurt.</i>

821
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:27,061
<i>Maybe I am leaving
the old me behind.</i>
