Season02 Episode03</font>

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,700
Previously on dexter...

5
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,730
Two treasure hunters made
a ghastly discovery today

6
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,360
When they stumbled on what appears to be an underwater
graveyard in a crevice off the coast of miami.

7
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,140
Do you know what that means?

8
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:57,680
Means there might be a new mass murderer out
there,way worse than the ice-truck killer.

9
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,090
The bay harbor butcher?

10
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,630
That's what the press is calling
whoever dumped bodies offshore.

11
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,350
The last thing miami needs
is another serial killer.

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,580
13 and counting.

13
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,750
They're so swamped up there,they
had to bring in outside talent.

14
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,480
Frank lundy?*******

15
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,300
The green river
killer,the D.C.Sniper --

16
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,920
If the case was impossible,he broke it.

17
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,990
So,this is the man who stands
between me and death row.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,450
With your help,we'll find
whoever did this awful thing.

19
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:23,390
So,let's get a jump-start
on the bay harbor butcher.

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,880
With doakes tag inme,my life's
been all jekyll and no hyde.

21
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,240
Paul kept insisting to me that
you knocked him over the head,

22
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,810
Dragged him to his motel,and
shot him up with drugs.

23
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,820
I hit paul to protect you and the kids.

24
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,220
Look,if there is
anything left between us,

25
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,360
You will answer me this one question
and you will tell me the truth.

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,490
Are you an addict?

27
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,890
Yes,I have an addiction.

28
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,230
'An Inconvenient Lie'

29
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,570
My name is caroline.

30
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm an addict.

31
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,290
Hi,c oline.

32
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,100
Um,I started taking pain
pills after my back surgery.

33
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,650
I don't need them for the pain anymore.

34
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,600
Now I...

35
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,520
Now I just need them.

36
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,870
And I need duct tape
-- three or four rolls.

37
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,010
Running low on heavy-duty trash bags.

38
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,350
When's the last time
I sharpened my knives?

39
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,960
And I lost my license.

40
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,250
Tears now?

41
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,900
It's very hard to concentrate in here.

42
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,420
How am I supposed to get any work done?

43
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,370
My husband says he's gonna
leave me if I don't stay sober.

44
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,980
But I have to do this for myself.

45
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,170
No self-control,lost
everything,trying to stop.

46
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,860
Same whiny story over and over for...

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,870
10 minutes --
feels like 10 hours.

48
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,760
Taking lortabs and darvocet and percocet

49
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,990
And anything I could get my hands on.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,390
And even now...

51
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,410
I'd kill for a vicodin.

52
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,400
Lightweight.

53
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,200
First I thought,narcotics
anonymous,I don't belong here.

54
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,710
You guys are real addicts.

55
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,390
So,how was the meeting?

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,790
Tell me everything.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,360
It was,uh,interesting,hearing the
same story over and over again.

58
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,230
- Knowing you're not alone.
- Exactly.

59
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,370
Did you get fortune cookies?

60
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,140
Only the ones with the good fortunes.

61
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,090
So,did you share or just listen?

62
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,130
I just wanted to take it
all in my first time out.

63
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,540
Think they forgot...

64
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,190
Ah,here they are. Spring rolls.

65
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,400
And what about a
sponsor? Did you find one?

66
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,800
I didn't want to rush into anything.

67
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,730
It's an important relationship.

68
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,500
Absolutely.

69
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,940
Okay,so,let's see your newcomer's chip.

70
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,880
Newcomer's chip. Yeah...

71
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,870
You did stay until the end,didn't you?

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,860
Of course I did.

73
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,050
Right to the end.

74
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,160
You're a terrible liar.

75
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,850
I know too much about 12-step
programs to be easily conned,dexter.

76
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:24,160
I didn't stay till the end
end,if that's what you mean.

77
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,330
I had some important errands to run.

78
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,350
Important? What?

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,980
Am I important? Are the kids?

80
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,150
Yeah.

81
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,050
Yes,of course.

82
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,450
Well,you're just gonna have
to figure out how important,

83
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,600
Because if you don't work the program
-- and I mean really work it --

84
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,310
I just... I can't go through this again.

85
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,820
All right,kids. Dinner.

86
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,020
How important are they?

87
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,770
I'm sure someone with a heart
could answer that question.

88
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,730
Tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow.

89
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,800
I'll stay.

90
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,330
Okay.

91
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,450
- Okay?
- Okay.

92
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,370
Hold the elevator!

93
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,190
Thanks.

94
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,440
Nice dodge last night,flooringit
through that yellow light.

95
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,640
Were you behind me?

96
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,210
See you tonight.

97
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,000
We will get to all of you.

98
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,010
Okay,take their names and keep them out
of the bullpen till we figure this out.

99
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,720
Sue macmillan.

100
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,460
She disappeared four years ago.

101
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,830
Who are they?

102
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,730
Every family member of every
missing person for the last decade.

103
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,070
Including some sad,lonely,and
presumably single women,

104
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,560
Courtesy of lieutenant pascal.

105
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,640
It's not her fault. That
reporter's an asshole.

106
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,810
Sergeant?

107
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,920
Yeah,hold the rest of them
downstairs. We're out of room here.

108
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,530
You seen pascal?

109
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,890
You know,pascal is just
caught in a cycle of reaction.

110
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,560
She's not co-creating her own reality.

111
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,610
You know those words don't
actually mean anything,right?

112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,530
Look around you,bro.

113
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,430
She's manifesting negativity.

114
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,130
It's on again.

115
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,670
Excuse me,lieutenant?

116
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,390
No comment.

117
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,650
We have reports there were dozens of
bodies found in that underwater grave site.

118
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,450
Not dozens.

119
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,740
The boss' sweater
melons look bigger on tv.

120
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,300
The operative word is boss.

121
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,390
Show some respect.

122
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,960
I thought I was.

123
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,670
One dozen? Two dozen?

124
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,290
18 or so.

125
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,950
Have the families been notified?

126
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,640
We're still trying to identify them.

127
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,250
If viewers have information,they
should contact you?

128
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,410
Yes. Fine.

129
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,530
So,there you have it.

130
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,800
Police are seeking any leads that can help them identify
the 18 faceless victims of the bay harbor butcher.

131
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,720
If you have any
information,please contact...

132
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,850
Pascal is definitely off her game.

133
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,400
Word is,her fianc? Is catching
some strange on the sly.

134
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,950
That'd do it.

135
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,410
The shit stops here. Give it to me.

136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,800
Most of these people
won't find answers here.

137
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,860
Chances are good their loved
ones weren't among my chosen few.

138
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,790
May I have your attention,please?

139
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,600
First of all,I want to tell you what a great
job you've all been doing on this horrific case.

140
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,030
And with the help of the best man hunter
in the fbi,we should have answers soon.

141
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,830
In the meantime,the daily work of this
precinct must continue to serve the public,

142
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,400
So we'll be dividing up our resources.

143
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,350
Agent lundy has requested the following
officers for his joint task force.

144
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,600
Officer cook...

145
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,520
Lundy made me lfi.

146
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,100
Lfi?

147
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,280
Lead forensics investigator.

148
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,410
Sorry you got
boned,but,hey,no blood spatter.

149
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,110
Sucks to be me.

150
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,220
Actually,it keeps me off lundy's radar.

151
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,070
Sergeant lee.

152
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,940
Detective ramos...

153
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,390
Officer panko...

154
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,830
- detective batista...
- yes!

155
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,400
I saw this happening.

156
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,930
And officer debra morgan.

157
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,230
Those called will report
directly to special agent lundy.

158
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,200
And let's not forget this
is on all of us,folks.

159
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,830
Let's keep our eyes and our ears open.

160
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,400
The ice-truck killer was an
amateur compared to this guy.

161
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,040
I'd also appreciate it if your lieutenant would
consult with me before speaking to the press.

162
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,800
I'll rip her a new one...

163
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,990
If I can find her.

164
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,950
Prints,fiber,trace
evidence --

165
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,170
No,they won't find anything.

166
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,000
I followed all of harry's
painstaking preventative measures.

167
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,560
He knew that nothing
stays buried forever.

168
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:55,290
His code will protect me.

169
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,380
Still,I wish my own sister weren't hunting
me -- makes for an awkward family dynamic.

170
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,900
So,I'm a fed.

171
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,030
My suit proves it.

172
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,070
The other suits here are feds.

173
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,320
But suit or...

174
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,580
Ugly hawaiian
shirt --

175
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,710
No offense --
we're a team.

176
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,520
And our first play is
I.D.Ing those bodies.

177
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,740
Once we know who they are,we'll
fill in every detail of their lives,

178
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,020
From their huevos ranchos
to their crËme br˚lÈE.

179
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:32,130
And,uh,get used to food
references 'cause,well,I like food.

180
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,560
Vince masuka and his team are
gathering dna,prints,and dental records.

181
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,790
The rest of us are going to cull through
cold cases and missing-persons files.

182
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,050
Also,I want that crowd
out there interviewed --

183
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,440
Though most of them
will be a waste of time.

184
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,320
Negative thinking.

185
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,340
You four,move them out as quickly
as you can,but be thorough.

186
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,970
If we get even one
hit,it'll be worth it.

187
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,510
Everyone else,work the files.

188
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,990
Remember,I.D.S will lead to a
pattern,which will lead to our man.

189
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,560
When the manhunt is
on,the hunted go shopping.

190
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,710
Not for a
new car --

191
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
For my next project.

192
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,810
I won't act on it... Yet.

193
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,010
I'm still laying low.

194
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,270
Harry would insist on that.

195
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,340
Just getting the
research out of the way.

196
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,790
Someone talked his way into the homes of two
women and didn't leave till they were dead.

197
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,100
Ann cohen and,a month
before her,lynn hall.

198
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,200
A certain car dealership ran
credit checks on both women.

199
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,110
Both bought cars elsewhere,so
nobody thought about it twice.

200
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,400
But who requested those credit checks?

201
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,010
Roger hicks.

202
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,050
All I need is
some dna proof --

203
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,390
Cup of coffee should do the trick.

204
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,790
How many kids you got?

205
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,500
Enough.

206
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,200
I hear you.

207
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,490
When my two came along,it
was bye-bye,convertible.

208
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,860
Of course...

209
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,960
They're worth it.

210
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Must take after their mom.

211
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,780
That they do. Thank god.

212
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,290
I tell you,I miss my
convertible,but,uh,truth --

213
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,840
My minivan's got a much nicer ride.

214
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,750
So you own one.

215
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,240
Oh,the same one you're looking at.

216
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,170
I mean,I know
-- whipped,right?

217
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,100
But,uh,my kids love the twin dvds.

218
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,440
They're just crazy about
spongebob,you know what I mean?

219
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,670
Actually,I do.

220
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,060
My wife loves the nav system
and all the safety features.

221
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,860
And when they're happy...

222
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,690
- you're happy.
- That's right.

223
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,380
Except the kids don't
exist,neither does the wife.

224
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:58,850
And he owns a beemer,not a minivan.

225
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,070
Still,he's seamless.

226
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,200
Impressive.

227
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,500
It's not flashy,but...

228
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,150
What did flash ever get me? It
got me pulled over,that's what.

229
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,250
I'm definitely not into flash.

230
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,040
You got to sit in the
captain's chair,though.

231
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,050
It's like a 747,man.

232
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,930
Manuel,hold up.

233
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,030
Thank you,sir. So,uh...

234
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,260
We should take it out.
Check out the ride.

235
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,640
I'm just doing research.

236
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,190
Okay,you don't want a big
sales pitch. I get that.

237
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,250
Let me at least pull the specs for you.

238
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:33,170
Because,truthfully,we have a hard
time keeping these on the lot.

239
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,110
You might want to grab the
test-drive while it's still here.

240
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,160
I think I have all the information
I need to make a decision.

241
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,280
Yeah?Well,then,you've seen the,uh,

242
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:43,760
The stow 'n go seating system,right?

243
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:48,310
I have had everything in here

244
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,830
From a soccer team to
a freakin' deer carcass.

245
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,160
It was an accident,of course.

246
00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:00,430
But,uh,I sure was glad for the ample cargo
space,not to mention the tinted windows.

247
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,070
I can see how that might come in handy.

248
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,970
I'll just grab the keys.

249
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,950
I go to stalk a killer and
I end up with a new car?

250
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,190
- How'd that happen?
- New car?

251
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
Yeah.

252
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,120
You get married?

253
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,940
Not that I know of.

254
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,040
So what's with the mommy mobile?

255
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,500
I'm,uh...

256
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,390
Not sure.

257
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,040
Synthetic.

258
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,910
Even roger's hair is a lie.

259
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,230
I could learn a thing
or two from this guy.

260
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,570
Who's your daddy?

261
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,990
Harry morgan.

262
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,490
Dude,the lead forensics investigator
of the joint task force -- that's who.

263
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,440
Oh,okay.

264
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,400
So,you want in on this bitch or not?

265
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,160
What bitch?

266
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,190
The only bitch in town,baby.

267
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,160
The bay harbor butcher.

268
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,680
I got you temporarily assigned.

269
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,230
Vince,you didn't have to do that.

270
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,570
Nothing sexy,of course,just some
bone-marrow collection for dna I.D.S.

271
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,100
But it'll get you in the tent.

272
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,240
And you got to see the tent. Amazing.

273
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,450
Say it.

274
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:40,120
You're my daddy.

275
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,330
It sounds weird when you say it.

276
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,050
I haven't been much use
since he disappeared.

277
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,270
I know I'm supposed to move on,but...

278
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,950
Here's the picture of him.

279
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,410
He looks...

280
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,390
Nice.

281
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,310
Not according to my mother...

282
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,280
Or the police.

283
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,460
He was in and out of jail,but my
heart raced whenever I saw him.

284
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,470
I brought his toothbrush.

285
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,210
They say you can get dna off it.

286
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,670
You can find him with this,right?

287
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,550
Special agent lundy?

288
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,260
Look,thanks for choosing me
for the task force and all,

289
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,970
But I'd appreciate you
finding someone else.

290
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,330
You want off?

291
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,900
Just as soon as you can replace me,sir.

292
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,930
This is a chance to solve
a pretty important case.

293
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,670
Most people get into this
line of work to do just that.

294
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,060
Well,i've got cases
of my own backing up,

295
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,910
And the precinct's
shorthanded with all this shit.

296
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,580
So,if you don't mind...

297
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,310
I'll see what I can do.

298
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,580
In the meantime,if you could
continue the interviews...

299
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,230
Yeah. Yeah,of course.

300
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,470
Thank you.

301
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,040
Most of 'em have been
underwater for years.

302
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,960
But some,it's awesome,you
can't even tell.

303
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,440
The temperature on the ocean floor
and the airtight bags kept them intact.

304
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,970
I mean,a little gelatinous
residue,sure. But...

305
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,260
I'd rather remember my old
playmates as they were --

306
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,330
Neat,clean little packages.

307
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,300
You know,vince,I appreciate
you doing me this favor but --

308
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,300
Actually,you're doing me the favor.

309
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,420
I need your help,buddy.

310
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,980
The pressure's fucking ridonkulous.

311
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:42,100
Glad to be of service.

312
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,990
Field morgue for the overflow,but
it's state-of-the-art.

313
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,490
Fucking fbi,eh?

314
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,650
A good percentage are just bones.

315
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,590
Must have fed the fish
when the bags tore.

316
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,720
Humpty fucking dumpty,right?

317
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,210
Exactly.

318
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,850
They weren't meant to
be put together again.

319
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,080
They were meant to remain in the
silent shadows,keeping their secrets.

320
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:18,090
Now they're exposed to the glare,reflecting my
darkness like some grotesque carnival mirror.

321
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,540
Harry was right --
nothing stays buried.

322
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,370
Perhaps not even me.

323
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,690
Looking for my taurus,sergeant?

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,560
Keep looking.

325
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,340
You don't need to know
where I'm going tonight.

326
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,640
And genius me,not only do I leave
my works in my girlfriend's car,

327
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,180
But also all the dead fish
from the fishing trip,right?

328
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,610
Then I collapse in her
parents' house,scare her kids,

329
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,360
And get myself fired,'cause
guess what -- we work together.

330
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,420
Yeah.

331
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,200
So,now,well,I'm 20-days sober...

332
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,340
Again...

333
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,780
Hoping to make it to 21.

334
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,590
Thanks,gordon.

335
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,610
This meeting recognizes
lengths of sobriety with chips.

336
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,440
So,if there's anyone who
would like a newcomer's chip...

337
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,710
You've got three minutes
to share if you want it.

338
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,500
Oh,really?

339
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,520
Go ahead,man. You among friends.

340
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,190
Well,I,uh...

341
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,610
What's your name?

342
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,250
Bob.

343
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,670
- Hi,bob.
- Hi.

344
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,090
And i'm,um...

345
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,890
An addict.

346
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,360
I use...

347
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,050
Heroin --
shoot it.

348
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,160
It's affecting my job.

349
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,750
My boss found my works. He fired my ass.

350
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,900
But I showed him -- I spent every
penny of my final paycheck on junk.

351
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,760
Doctor said I...

352
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,370
I almost died.

353
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,950
Coffee sucks...

354
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,640
As bad as the doughnuts.

355
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,990
It's better next door. Come on.

356
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,690
It is good coffee. Thank you.

357
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,900
So,tell me...

358
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,800
Exactly how full of shit are you?

359
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,020
I'm not full of anything.

360
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,060
It was a nice performance in there.

361
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,780
Where did you download
it from? Addict.Com?

362
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,160
Look,I have no reason to lie.

363
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,380
Sure you do.

364
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,110
We all do.

365
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,390
You thought I was lying?

366
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,930
I don't know... Bob.

367
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,160
Well,it is anonymous.

368
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:55,670
Everyone in that room has heard or lived

369
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,510
Far worse than anything
you've ever done.

370
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,260
I doubt it.

371
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,610
Oh,so you're super-junkie.

372
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,870
I don't mean to imply that what you've
been through hasn't been difficult.

373
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,430
But there's no way that I could
know what you've experienced,right?

374
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,290
I couldn't possibly feel that need.

375
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,200
Like a thousand hiding
voices whispering,

376
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,000
This is who you are.

377
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,950
And you fight the pressure,

378
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,920
The growing need rising like a wave,

379
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:46,810
Prickling and teasing
and prodding to be fed.

380
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:53,320
But the whispering gets louder
until it's screaming,now!

381
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,260
And it's the only voice you hear...

382
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:05,040
The only voice you want to hear.

383
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,340
And you belong to it,to this...

384
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:15,830
Shadow self.

385
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,940
To this...

386
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,650
Dark passenger.

387
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,940
Yes.

388
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,480
The dark passenger.

389
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,720
No.

390
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,870
I'm sorry,but I need to go.

391
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,570
Thanks for the coffee.

392
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,040
She knows.

393
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:03,190
She recognizes demons...
Dark passengers.

394
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,580
Maybe the others can,too.

395
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,190
This program is too
risky,especially now.

396
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,880
Rita will have to understand.

397
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,720
Hey.

398
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,030
You just missed story time.

399
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,320
I was at a meeting.

400
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,720
Thank you.

401
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,210
It made me realize something important.

402
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,270
Oh,really? What's that?

403
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,270
Those meetings are not
a good place for me.

404
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,640
I know how this sounds,but
I can do this on my own.

405
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,400
Dexter,you need a program.

406
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:00,130
I've read
studies --

407
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,360
People are 10 times as likely to change on their
own as they are with the help of doctors or programs.

408
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,720
So you're quoting studies?

409
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,410
Look,I lived this.

410
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,290
I watched paul try and fail
with white-knuckle sobriety.

411
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,650
I'm not paul.

412
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,460
I'm not any of those people.

413
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,800
Going to those meetings will do
more harm than good,I swear to you.

414
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,090
I'm better off alone.

415
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,640
I pray you change your mind.

416
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:38,280
What just happened?

417
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,320
Deb?

418
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,400
Deb?

419
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,360
Thought you were staying at rita's.

420
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,110
Taking the night off.

421
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,430
I thought you'd be on the treadmill.

422
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,570
Taking the night off.

423
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,260
With no money down,guaranteed,or
we'll make your first two payments...

424
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,690
A night off is good to
remember what's important.

425
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,020
Two women are dead,the
killer is selling minivans,

426
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,800
And I have an opportunity to
prove it,even if I am laying low.

427
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,550
Having a victim prepped and ready
will take the edge off the wait...

428
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,780
I hope.

429
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,500
Hey,hang on just a second,okay?

430
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,650
- What's going on,dex?
- Hey.

431
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:53,930
Any problems,the service center can take
care of you,but they're around the corner.

432
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,040
Actually,the minivan's fine.

433
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,730
Well,of course it is. I
never sold a lemon in my life.

434
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,890
I'm just rethinking
the extended warranty.

435
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,840
Great,i'll set you up with
a warranty writer,then.

436
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:04,270
And I'm thinking roof rack
and premium sound system.

437
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,820
- Going all out.
- Yeah.

438
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,790
That's great,but I'm with a customer.

439
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,260
- And so one of my associates
- - I'd rather deal with you.

440
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,800
- i'll just wait for you in your office.
- Outstanding.

441
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,870
Dna,dna,come out and play.

442
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:34,170
Uh-oh,roger's got you in the box.

443
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,690
Once you're in the box,you
don't leave without a deal.

444
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,180
Don't worry. You're safe with roger.

445
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,670
He's the best.

446
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,030
I'm just dropping off
this thank-you note.

447
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,740
Well,I was just leaving.

448
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,920
He sent you across the street,didn't he?

449
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,150
Across the street?

450
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,120
It's okay,he told me not
to tell anyone either.

451
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:57,390
Yeah,I don't know how he makes a living
sending all of his commissions to other dealers.

452
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,230
Maybe he has ulterior motives.

453
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,080
Or maybe he knows I
can't afford his price.

454
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,610
After he ran a credit check?

455
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,340
Trw doesn't lie.

456
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,180
So,you're single?

457
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,100
Y-yeah.

458
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,150
Makes it tougher to afford those
big-ticket items,like cars and houses.

459
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,090
- You rent an apartment?
- A house.

460
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,080
I hate sharing walls.
You can hear everything.

461
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:21,860
Tell me about it. No pets,though,right?

462
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,390
Yeah. Is this a come-on?

463
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,700
'Cause it's a little weird.

464
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,460
It must be why I'm still single.

465
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,370
Another brunette.

466
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,400
Single,neighbors at a
distance,no guard dog.

467
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,030
The credit check gets roger
all the details he needs.

468
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,760
She's next,and I can't
do anything about it --

469
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,970
Not until this manhunt ends.

470
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,240
Harry would insist on it.

471
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,510
What?

472
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,200
No,i'll take care of it.

473
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,620
I know the card is in his name.

474
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,240
I just want to check the charges.

475
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:10,270
Well,the supervisor I spoke
with this morning allowed it.

476
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,680
Yes --
no,uh...

477
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,020
Yeah,i'll hold. Yes?

478
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,720
Just a reminder that the biscayne
drive-by warrant needs your approval.

479
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:21,660
I'll look at it.

480
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:24,470
And the homicide that came in last
night still needs to be assigned.

481
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,920
Right,thanks.

482
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,760
Look,esmee,

483
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,150
I know that things are rough
with you and your fianc?Right now,

484
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,700
And I'm sorry,really,but we need to
keep clearing that board out there.

485
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,820
Yeah,you're right. I'm sorry.

486
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,940
I seem to have had my
head up my ass lately.

487
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,730
It's called being human.

488
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,160
Okay,who's up?

489
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,410
Samuels and kent are up.

490
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,580
Put them on the liquor-store shooting.

491
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,820
And where is the biscayne warrant?

492
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,840
Oh,right here.

493
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,650
Simms and hoagie want S.W.A.T.For entry.

494
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,550
I think it's a good
measure,given the weapons charge.

495
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:08,170
Excuse me,I'm -- I'm gonna
need a minute. Just...

496
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,740
Just gonna need a minute.

497
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,400
Esmee?

498
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:16,590
- Esmee?
- Please,maria.

499
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,750
I'll handle it.

500
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,340
You're not taking my calls,and now you're
checking my credit-card charges,esmee?

501
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,100
Roger's dna matches the semen
found at both crime scenes.

502
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,890
Irrefutable.

503
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,610
If I do nothing,another woman dies.

504
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,820
Is that my long-dormant
conscience talking

505
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,570
Or the dark passenger whispering?

506
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,650
Hi,it's me.

507
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,750
Hi,dexter.

508
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,600
Kids home from school yet?

509
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,660
Colleen's bringing them home now.

510
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,660
I'm A...

511
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,330
Little confused.

512
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,280
I'm sorry you're confused.

513
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,010
I mean,it's pizza night.
Should I pick up the usual?

514
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,070
Did you go back?

515
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,240
To a meeting --
thinking about it.

516
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,080
The kids and i will order in,then.

517
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,160
Uh,okay.

518
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,290
So...

519
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,100
Is this it?

520
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,020
That's up to you,dexter.

521
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,190
I want to know,where is she,mi teresita.

522
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,920
She's so young
-- 7 year old.

523
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,640
You help me.

524
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,910
I know you find her.

525
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,260
We'll do what we can.

526
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,630
Don't cry.

527
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,740
No spanish. No habla.

528
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,460
Only english. Angel?

529
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,700
Just tell her we'll call her.

530
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,100
She thinks you can find the daughter.

531
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:25,740
There are no kids down there.

532
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,980
Tell her I can't help her.

533
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,390
- She - - I-I
can't help you.

534
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,730
Morgan?

535
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,070
Morgan!

536
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,470
It's been 24 hours since
I asked to be replaced.

537
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,580
Has it?

538
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,650
What's taking so long?

539
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,770
Every cop on the damn
force wants in on this case.

540
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,710
Just take your pick.

541
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,380
I've been wondering about that,actually.

542
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,630
Everyone wants on,but you want off.

543
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,380
I told you,I have cases.

544
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:10,350
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so.

545
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,740
Jesus,I just don't want to be
on your task force,all right?

546
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,250
Why?

547
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,960
Because I'm the last person in
the world that should be on it.

548
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,870
You want me to find a serial killer?

549
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,930
I was engaged to one,for christ's sake.

550
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,610
What kind of cop
-- what kind of --

551
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,260
That's why I chose
you,you know --

552
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,540
Because of what you went through.

553
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,550
You survived.

554
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,910
I don't know how.

555
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,050
I can't begin to imagine the
strength it took -- continues to take.

556
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,460
More than that,

557
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:48,290
You got a firsthand look into
the mind and heart of a killer,

558
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,920
And you're still here.

559
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:55,820
If you can accept that
--really accept it --

560
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,750
You could use it.

561
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,130
Mix that with some of
your strength,and...

562
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:05,960
You could catch someone even
worse than the ice-truck killer.

563
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:12,310
But you have to stop running.

564
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,320
Finish today's interviews.

565
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,860
Then,if you still want out,you got it.

566
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,910
Lead fucking investigator.

567
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,830
Translation --
everyone's bitch.

568
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,760
I do have a life,you know.

569
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,770
You do?

570
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,350
Just give me your
bone-marrow dna results.

571
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,070
No matches.

572
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,660
Big surprise.

573
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,770
Do me a favor on your way out,will you?

574
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,880
Drop these dental x-rays
at the field morgue for me?

575
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:49,650
Tech should still be there.

576
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,560
Fucking bay harbor butcher is
butchering my online social life.

577
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,890
Sorry.

578
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,830
Next.

579
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,420
I figured you'd still be here.

580
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:16,570
You were a pain in the ass
but always a damn hard worker.

581
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,050
And,of course,you knew
how to handle the press.

582
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,590
Come here a minute.

583
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,190
The public needs to believe that we can
protect them,or all hell breaks loose,

584
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,160
So I need all my people operating
at their very highest levels.

585
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,050
I agree.

586
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,900
Should I be worried about pascal?

587
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,660
Pascal? Why?

588
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,540
You can cut the crap,maria.

589
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,010
I know she's been awol
on personal matters.

590
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,010
The press fuckup is huge,

591
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,280
And now I'm beginning to hear
rumors about erratic behavior.

592
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,230
And you're asking me because...

593
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,410
Because you've done the job.

594
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:07,140
So if she's out,that
means you're back in.

595
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,640
That makes you her harshest
critic,and I want it straight.

596
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,710
So...

597
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Take your shot,maria.

598
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,530
You know what erratic means?

599
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,800
It's code for non-male,

600
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:26,320
And it's the same bullshit sexism
I put up with when I was in charge.

601
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:29,350
I won't dignify rumors,captain.

602
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,770
Pascal's fine.

603
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,540
Minivan's that way.

604
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,350
Field morgue's this way.

605
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,030
I'll wait.

606
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,370
You should take the night off,sergeant.

607
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,050
On pizza night? No way.

608
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,710
What does that girlfriend of yours
see in a freak show like you anyway?

609
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,750
You have to ask her.

610
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,310
Maybe I will.

611
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,530
What exactly is it you think i've done?

612
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,460
I know you're connected
to the ice-truck killer.

613
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:11,190
Could you be more vague?

614
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,160
I know you're too careful.

615
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,230
You keep your assets in cash.

616
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,300
You don't belong to any
organizations or alumni groups.

617
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,870
You were top of your
class in med school,

618
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,780
But you traded it for
fucking blood spatter.

619
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:24,200
I know you studied
martial arts in college,

620
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:28,300
But I don't know what a lab
geek needs with advanced jujitsu.

621
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,120
Do you know what an easy credit is?

622
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,760
I know you're a good liar,too.

623
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,210
Not good enough.

624
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,120
Sergeant doakes thinks
he knows my secrets,

625
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:03,480
But he only needs to look at this,my
body of work,to know the real me.

626
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,320
Suit up if you're gonna touch them.

627
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:11,320
No,I'm just,uh...

628
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,340
Dropping off some x-rays.

629
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,160
I'm dexter morgan.

630
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,150
I know who you are.

631
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,840
Right.

632
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,940
Looks like the lab tech's gone
home for the night,so i'll just...

633
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:33,230
You hoping they'll talk to you?

634
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,990
The ones with heads,anyway.

635
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,920
They always speak... Eventually.

636
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,800
Just got to ask the right question.

637
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,550
Which is?

638
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,000
Why were they chosen?

639
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:56,670
You looking for a pattern?

640
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:02,580
One doesn't kill this many people in this
careful,methodical way without a reason --

641
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,460
Some... Twisted set of principles.

642
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,270
Yeah,they would have to
be twisted,wouldn't they?

643
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,060
The worst killers in history are usually the
ones who think their murders were somehow...

644
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,290
Just -- even
deserved.

645
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,910
Leaders have slaughtered whole
populations for the same warped reason.

646
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,550
But there's never any
justification for killing.

647
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,500
No.

648
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:32,150
Well,one,of course.

649
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,140
To save an innocent life.

650
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,670
To save an innocent life.

651
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,340
How many more bodies would there
be had I not stopped those killers?

652
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:49,250
Dndi't do it to save lives...

653
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,120
But save lives I did.

654
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:57,610
Motivation aside,I think harry
and lundy would agree on this one.

655
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,120
- Roger the artful dodger.
- Jesus!

656
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,850
You scared me,bro.

657
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,230
We have some unfinished business.

658
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,300
Oh,yeah,right,the warranty
and stuff. Listen,uh...

659
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,200
I can't write you up right now.

660
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,540
I got the wife waiting for me.

661
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:20,840
You're not married.

662
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,050
Ex-wife. I got to take the kids.

663
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,020
You don't have kids.

664
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:25,270
- Stepkids --they're hers. 
- Nope.

665
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,010
Okay,how about this one?

666
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,270
I don't give a shit.

667
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,620
Neither do I.

668
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,390
You were right about
the ample cargo space.

669
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,550
Where am I?

670
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:14,110
Looks different under plastic,but
you spent an evening here...

671
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,740
With ann cohen.

672
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,930
You took her last breath
from her right over there.

673
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,940
- You remember?
- No.

674
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,640
You're -- you're
wrong. I wouldn't.

675
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,830
You would and you did and
you were about to do it again.

676
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,480
That's why we're here.

677
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,660
No,this is crazy.

678
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,730
You got the wrong guy.

679
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,900
I -- I sell
cars,for god's sake.

680
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,350
I've never hurt anyone in my
life -- definitely not a woman.

681
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,800
Why can't I do that?

682
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,910
Do what?

683
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,970
Lie like that.

684
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,910
I mean,I thought I was
good,but you,it's...

685
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,280
I don't lie.

686
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,000
Okay,that one was weak.

687
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:53,580
Okay,look,any car on the lot,it's yours.

688
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:56,920
T-bird,town car,you
name it -- yours free.

689
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,150
I'll call it in right now.

690
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,200
Lot's closed.

691
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,380
I'll have them open
it up. I'm the manager.

692
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:02,940
The manager's name is rick buxton.

693
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,470
Yeah,but i've been
there longer than he has.

694
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,730
You've been there three months.

695
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,510
At the other lot.

696
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,790
It's like watching someone ski moguls.

697
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,690
You just hop from
one lie to the next --

698
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,310
No shame,no embarrassment.

699
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,440
You just don't give a shit.

700
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:26,810
That's the key,right? Not to
care about anyone or anything.

701
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,760
I care.

702
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,590
I care a lot.

703
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,770
No,it was a compliment.

704
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,620
- I don't care,either.
- Yes,you do.

705
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,500
Like about your wife.

706
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,460
Not married.

707
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,260
Girlfriend,then.

708
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,330
I saw it the minute
you walked on the lot.

709
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,700
What did you see? Tell me.

710
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:53,430
Look,most guys your age,they beeline...

711
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,390
Right for the horsepower --
you know,something flashy,sexy.

712
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,230
But you -- you're
there all alone,

713
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,750
No one there to nag you,and you
don't even glance at the coupes.

714
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,700
The only thing you
look at is the minivan,

715
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:13,040
Like you can see her in the passenger's
seat and the kids in the back.

716
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,500
- Leave the kids out.
- See?

717
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,030
You're lying to yourself
if you think you don't care.

718
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,390
She's just a companion,really.

719
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,160
Started that way,anyway.

720
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,430
Someone who.

721
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,110
Looked good,normal.

722
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,670
They worm their way in.

723
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,110
Yeah,they do.

724
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,600
Then they shut you out.

725
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,270
That's what this is about
-- That she shut you out?

726
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:52,610
Man,okay,I get it.
I-I -- i've been there.

727
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:57,180
But you can't let her get
to you like this,'cause --

728
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,260
'Cause they're all the
same -- fucking bitches.

729
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,110
You do everything for
them,and then they fuck you.

730
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:07,140
She's not worth it,all right?
You're better off without that cunt.

731
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,990
Don'T...

732
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,910
Talk that way about my girlfriend.

733
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:23,300
I'm dexter,and I'm not sure what I am.

734
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,120
Hi,dexter.

735
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:30,480
I just know there's
something dark in me...

736
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,800
And I hide it.

737
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,090
I certainly don't talk about it...

738
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:42,330
But it's there... Always.

739
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,860
This dark passenger.

740
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:51,410
And when he's driving,I feel...

741
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:53,780
Alive...

742
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:59,720
Half sick with the thrill
of complete wrongness.

743
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,170
I don't fight him.

744
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,330
I don't want to.

745
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,110
He's all i've got.

746
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,570
Nothing else could love me,not even...

747
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:19,520
Especially not me.

748
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:26,910
Or is that just a lie the
dark passenger tells me?

749
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:35,710
Because lately there are
these moments when I feel...

750
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:45,010
Connected to something
else -- someone.

751
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,940
It's like...

752
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,600
The mask is slipping...

753
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,830
And things...

754
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,810
People...

755
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:09,100
Who never mattered before are
suddenly starting to matter.

756
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:13,880
It scares the hell out of me.

757
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,340
Hello... Dexter.

758
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,570
That's all the time we have for sharing.

759
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,630
Would someone lead us
in the serenity prayer?

760
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:02,310
Lila.

761
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,510
I knew there was
something wrong with you.

762
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,600
The secrets,the
sneaking around --

763
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,380
Now it all makes sense.

764
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,380
A lot of cops have been where you are.

765
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:33,670
The booze,the drugs...

766
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,340
Makes the job go down easier.

767
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:42,780
Stay clean and stay out of my
way,we won't have a problem.

768
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,910
Oh,and you owe me a new
michelin,you motherfucker.

769
00:47:56,830 --> 00:48:00,380
I have all your forms,so we'll do
what we can to bring your dad home.

770
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,560
I'm sorry. You don't understand.

771
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,410
I don't want him home.

772
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,030
Just tell me he's dead.
We need to know he's gone.

773
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,600
Right,you want closure.

774
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,740
I want peace.

775
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:13,770
He made our lives a living hell.

776
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:16,700
When he'd go to prison,it
was a blessing,but,uh...

777
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,860
You kept letting him out.

778
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,580
I need to tell my mother,my sister that
they're safe and that he's rotting in hell.

779
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:27,350
Call me when you can tell me that.

780
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,150
Lundy,wait.

781
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,260
I think -- I mean,it
could be a coincidence --

782
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:51,880
But there are two of them.

783
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:53,010
Two...

784
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,920
Missing people with
records -- prison records.

785
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,130
Interesting.

786
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,970
And who typically has a prison record?

787
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,790
I don't know.

788
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,590
Bad guys?

789
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:14,220
Bad guys.

790
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:17,010
- Do you think it could
be a - - a pattern?

791
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,190
Maybe.

792
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,890
We'll run all the victims'
dnaagainst the criminal database.

793
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,670
D.C.Lab is still open.

794
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:28,180
Come on. Let's get to work.

795
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,420
Dexter,what?

796
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:46,410
You were right.

797
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:50,220
I'm sorry to wake you up,but I had
to let you know that you were right.

798
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,550
About what?

799
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,180
The program.

800
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,470
It'S...

801
00:49:55,850 --> 00:49:58,160
It's good. It's really good.

802
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:03,670
I... Am always so in my head.

803
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:08,070
But this --
it was... Good.

804
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:14,490
In fact,it's already
helped me a lot. Thank you.

805
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,490
Oh,I do love this car.

806
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:31,710
Yeah,I thought you might.

807
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:38,260
So,I will pick you up in an hour.

808
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,380
We'll go someplace nice for lunch.

809
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,590
- Oh,there's my sponsor.
- Really?Where?

810
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,030
The guy in the blue shirt?

811
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,760
No,next to
him -- lila.

812
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,890
- Bye.
- Bye.

813
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,000
I'm back.
