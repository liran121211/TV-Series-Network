1
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:58,237
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

2
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:00,506
This blood is from a defensive wound.

3
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,574
So you got arrested,
there'll be a trial,

4
00:02:02,609 --> 00:02:04,710
you'll go to prison for a long time.

5
00:02:04,745 --> 00:02:06,712
Does that mean this is over?

6
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:08,347
No.

7
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:10,148
These men are dangerous.

8
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:13,017
You should not get involved
with the Koshka brotherhood.

9
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:14,218
Don't be scared.

10
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:16,287
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

11
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:17,521
Where's Nadia?

12
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:19,723
Isaak Sirko wants you
to lose the blood evidence

13
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:21,725
linking him to the Colombian murders.

14
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,428
If I do this, Nadia is a free woman.

15
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:25,762
Deal.

16
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,497
What was Price doing here?

17
00:02:27,532 --> 00:02:29,900
He heard we dug up
more Wayne Randall victims,

18
00:02:29,935 --> 00:02:31,969
he asked if he could see
the case files.

19
00:02:32,004 --> 00:02:33,404
I fudged the blood report.

20
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,172
My guy said
the void pattern on this body

21
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:38,842
indicates a killer
much smaller than Wayne Randall.

22
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,410
Smaller, like Hannah McKay?

23
00:02:40,444 --> 00:02:42,446
And I think she kept right on killing.

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,914
If that's true, we're totally fucked.

25
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:46,049
We gave her immunity.

26
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:48,118
So how'd he die--
your husband?

27
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:50,154
Uh--heart attack.

28
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,623
I know she killed
her husband, I can feel it.

29
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:53,691
Aconite.

30
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:55,626
Ingesting it causes heart attack.

31
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,635
Do what you gotta do.

32
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,843
Dexter--

33
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:25,872
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

34
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,426
Chemistry.

35
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,629
I've heard some people have it.

36
00:03:30,663 --> 00:03:34,265
An attraction that can't be
quantified or explained.

37
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,602
Is that the reason behind this...

38
00:03:37,636 --> 00:03:40,237
loss of control?

39
00:03:40,272 --> 00:03:42,039
Maybe the desire
to get Hannah on my table

40
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:46,810
was just a way to deny
the effect she has on me.

41
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:49,012
So now what?

42
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,092
How do you like it?

43
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:03,560
Not much.

44
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:07,764
You do this to all the girls
that you go out with?

45
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,266
Wrap them up in plastic?

46
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,169
I don't actually go out.

47
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:14,471
So then, what?
This whole date thing was just

48
00:04:14,506 --> 00:04:17,507
a way to get me alone
so you can kill me?

49
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:25,082
Why?

50
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,521
It's what I do.

51
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:33,091
You kill people.

52
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:37,061
Bad people.

53
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:41,532
So you think I'm bad.

54
00:04:41,567 --> 00:04:44,102
You--

55
00:04:44,136 --> 00:04:46,738
you fit the general description.

56
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:49,741
You have no idea.

57
00:05:14,301 --> 00:05:16,302
You know, I didn't plan
to spend the whole evening

58
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:18,605
talking about Hannah McKay.

59
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,874
Well, what do you want to talk about?

60
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:23,042
The economy?

61
00:05:23,077 --> 00:05:25,144
I don't know.

62
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,180
What kind of music you like?

63
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:30,382
Um...

64
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,284
A jailhouse door slamming shut.

65
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:34,653
That's my idea of music.

66
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:38,357
I don't know
what's driving me crazier,

67
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:40,459
Hannah McKay getting away
with a shitload of murder,

68
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:43,129
or you chewing on that straw.

69
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:45,898
Old habits die hard.

70
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:47,933
You know, it's gonna be
a real downer for your book

71
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,802
if Hannah gets away.

72
00:05:49,836 --> 00:05:51,837
Now that you mention it,
people who buy true crime stuff

73
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:55,440
tend to like it
when the bad guy gets caught.

74
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:57,275
Well, maybe I can help you
rewrite the ending.

75
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:58,610
So now you're an editor.

76
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:03,248
I'm thinking about Hannah's husband.

77
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:05,784
40-year-olds don't just
drop dead of a heart attack.

78
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:07,352
Maybe I could have the body exhumed,

79
00:06:07,386 --> 00:06:08,386
and we could test it for aconite.

80
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:09,721
It's been ten years.

81
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:12,691
But if it's there,
the tox screen will find it.

82
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:14,092
And the hard part
is getting permission.

83
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:15,294
Hannah's the next of kin,

84
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,095
and I doubt
she's gonna sign off on it.

85
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,630
She's not the only next of kin.

86
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:20,966
Hannah's husband had a sister.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,868
Well, aren't you
a goddamn know-it-all.

88
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:27,072
It's not my only virtue.

89
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:30,476
That remains to be seen.

90
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:37,216
Thank you for dinner.

91
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,097
We should do it again.

92
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:53,566
Yeah, why not?

93
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:02,842
I'll check my notes on the sister

94
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:05,879
and get back to you.

95
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,567
Chemistry deals with the reactions

96
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:31,138
between elementary forms of matter.

97
00:07:31,173 --> 00:07:34,409
Separate the elements,
and you negate the reaction.

98
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:35,443
This can't happen again.

99
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:36,745
Which part?

100
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:37,880
The horse tranquilizer?

101
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:38,948
The sex part.

102
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:40,583
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.

103
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,051
W--

104
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,185
why?

105
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,222
We both know it wouldn't end well.

106
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:49,058
- Just tell me something.
- What?

107
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:50,326
You're not gonna
try and kill me again, right?

108
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,794
Because I feel like
I have the right to know.

109
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:54,163
No. If I was, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

110
00:07:54,198 --> 00:07:58,568
Let's just think of it
as a misunderstanding.

111
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:02,037
One way to put it.

112
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:04,773
You know, you don't really
seem that shaken up.

113
00:08:04,807 --> 00:08:08,009
You know, for someone
who thought she was gonna die.

114
00:08:08,044 --> 00:08:09,711
Yeah, you're right,
I suppose I should be

115
00:08:09,745 --> 00:08:14,316
a little more freaked out.

116
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,351
Maybe I never really believed that

117
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,353
you were gonna do it.

118
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:28,463
Boy, did he pick the wrong car.

119
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:46,547
Oh-don’t, don't.

120
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,260
It was an interesting night.

121
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:00,829
That's one way to put it.

122
00:09:04,968 --> 00:09:06,335
You know, you never really asked me

123
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:09,004
why I kill people.

124
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,742
I don't need to.

125
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,205
Price.

126
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:41,506
The man thrives on stories,

127
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:45,010
and I've just given him a great twist.

128
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:46,745
If he writes about Hannah and me

129
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,414
my career is a memory.

130
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:52,218
Clouds parted, and much was revealed.

131
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:53,219
And that would be?

132
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:54,354
Now I know why the blood work

133
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:57,057
on the Wayne Randall spree
was so spotty.

134
00:09:57,092 --> 00:09:58,692
You were protecting someone.

135
00:09:58,727 --> 00:09:59,860
As far as Price knows,

136
00:09:59,894 --> 00:10:01,862
I'm an innocent lab geek
in over his head.

137
00:10:01,896 --> 00:10:04,298
How long have you been seeing her?

138
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:06,700
What do you want to keep quiet?

139
00:10:06,735 --> 00:10:08,836
It's not in my nature
to keep quiet about anything.

140
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,504
You can't write about this.

141
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:13,007
It's nothing personal.
I'm just doing my job.

142
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,108
You'll destroy my job.

143
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,478
Sorry.
No way around that.

144
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,082
You could always go on the record,

145
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:21,450
help me get my facts straight.

146
00:10:21,484 --> 00:10:26,321
I love writing about crimes
from the inside.

147
00:10:26,356 --> 00:10:27,789
What if I give you something better?

148
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:31,794
What better than "Lab tech
seduced by femme fatale?"

149
00:10:31,828 --> 00:10:34,230
I was the last one
to speak with Wayne Randall.

150
00:10:34,264 --> 00:10:37,132
I could tell you
what his last words were.

151
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:39,101
How he really felt about Hannah.

152
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,602
How do I know you wouldn't be

153
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:42,904
making something up to save your ass?

154
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:44,339
I wouldn't be,

155
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:45,974
but you'd have to judge for yourself.

156
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:49,979
Either way, I'd be on the record.

157
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:52,181
I'll give it some thought.

158
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:55,317
In the meantime, I'll keep quiet
about you and Hannah McKay.

159
00:10:55,351 --> 00:10:58,120
Show of good faith.

160
00:10:58,154 --> 00:10:59,655
Between you and me,

161
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:03,592
I'd watch what I eat around her.

162
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:06,595
I'll be in touch.

163
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:19,374
As if I needed another reason
to stay away from Hannah.

164
00:11:19,408 --> 00:11:21,710
At least I've bought myself some time.

165
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,116
This a good time?

166
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,319
Yes.

167
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:33,354
My theory on the barrel girl killers

168
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:35,222
went nowhere.

169
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:36,723
I'm on a dead end
on Bay Harbor Butcher.

170
00:11:36,757 --> 00:11:38,291
- Shit.
- I was thinking

171
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:39,626
we could brainstorm.

172
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,928
I keep wondering
if we haven't missed something.

173
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:44,564
You know,
some angle, or--

174
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:48,067
You know, maybe
we haven't missed anything.

175
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:49,869
- What do you mean?
- I mean, maybe

176
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:51,338
we've been sidetracked

177
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,807
by our feelings about Sergeant Doakes.

178
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,076
I think we've been objective.

179
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,679
Well, I guess I'm just
not sure, you know?

180
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:00,615
I know what it's like to hold on

181
00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:02,149
to an idea of someone, you know?

182
00:12:02,184 --> 00:12:04,318
To refuse to believe
that they have a dark side,

183
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:08,089
but everything we've done,
all the evidence,

184
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:11,259
it still points to Sergeant Doakes.

185
00:12:11,293 --> 00:12:14,529
At some point, we have to face facts.

186
00:12:14,563 --> 00:12:17,899
It's possible that we've been
reaching for leads.

187
00:12:17,933 --> 00:12:21,269
So should we rethink
what we're doing here?

188
00:12:21,303 --> 00:12:24,272
I mean, I just--
I don't know if it's worth it.

189
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:29,543
Maybe you're right.

190
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:42,088
I'm fucking going to hell.

191
00:12:43,957 --> 00:12:46,258
Sal Price made his living
writing about

192
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:48,293
the dark things people do,

193
00:12:48,328 --> 00:12:50,696
but he doesn't seem to have
a dark side of his own.

194
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:54,633
At least nothing I can use.

195
00:12:58,805 --> 00:12:59,805
You have a minute?

196
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,108
Sure.

197
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,110
- What's this?
- It's your blood spatter report

198
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:06,545
on the Wayne Randall victims.

199
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,213
- What about it?
- Well, there's something weird

200
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:09,915
I was hoping you could clear it up.

201
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,617
This blood spatter

202
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:14,553
points to a killer
other than Wayne Randall.

203
00:13:14,588 --> 00:13:18,958
Someone smaller.

204
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:20,126
And how'd you come to that?

205
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,996
Sal Price had an outside lab
run an analysis.

206
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,264
They found the discrepancies.

207
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:27,132
Did you miss this?

208
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,034
Price strikes again.

209
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,602
Where will he show up next?

210
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,638
Deb, I didn't miss anything.

211
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:34,306
I considered the same scenario.

212
00:13:34,341 --> 00:13:35,875
And?

213
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:37,109
Bl-blood spatter

214
00:13:37,144 --> 00:13:39,811
is largely a matter of interpretation,

215
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:41,913
but I'm convinced
Wayne was the sole killer.

216
00:13:41,948 --> 00:13:44,549
These blood drops
came from the killer.

217
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,651
You could've tested them
to see if they matched

218
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:49,320
Wayne Randall's DNA, just to be sure.

219
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:51,355
I was sure.
I didn't think the test

220
00:13:51,389 --> 00:13:52,923
was worth the time or the money.

221
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,126
Especially since the case
had been solved.

222
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,297
You wanna just come out
and say what you want to say?

223
00:14:00,332 --> 00:14:01,799
Hannah McKay killed this woman

224
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:02,967
and you're covering for her.

225
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:03,968
Why would I want to do that?

226
00:14:04,003 --> 00:14:06,004
To save her for your table.

227
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:10,108
You're wrong, Deb.

228
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:12,143
If you want,
I'll have the blood tested.

229
00:14:12,178 --> 00:14:14,579
Just say the word,
we can spend the money.

230
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:17,315
I'll think about it.

231
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,891
You smell that?

232
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,659
- What?
- Sulfur, mixed with shit.

233
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:31,462
Means Isaak Sirko's attorney
is on his way.

234
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,597
They want to run their own analysis

235
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:35,967
on the samples we took from Mateo's.

236
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,402
Hmm.

237
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:39,404
Confirm that it's
his client's blood we found.

238
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:41,072
Masuka's grabbing it now.

239
00:14:41,107 --> 00:14:42,807
I'll have it ready for them.

240
00:14:42,842 --> 00:14:45,743
That evidence should keep Isaak
locked up for a long time.

241
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:47,145
One less killer to worry about.

242
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:49,847
I just checked the freezer.

243
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:52,083
The evidence on Sirko is gone.

244
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:54,719
Or not.

245
00:14:54,753 --> 00:14:57,822
How in the hell does the most
crucial piece of evidence

246
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,825
against Isaak Sirko just disappear

247
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,960
from our own police station?

248
00:15:02,995 --> 00:15:04,595
I don't know.
I logged the blood samples

249
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,130
into evidence myself.

250
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:07,531
There's only one explanation.

251
00:15:07,566 --> 00:15:10,100
The Koshka brotherhood
has a mole inside Miami Metro.

252
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:11,902
A mole?
You read too many spy novels.

253
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:13,671
Maybe the evidence just got misplaced.

254
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,806
Hey, we do not misplace evidence.

255
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,207
And who reads anymore?

256
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:18,875
Simmer down, tiger mom,
nobody's blaming you.

257
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,310
Masuka's right.

258
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:22,412
This is why Sirko's attorney
asked for early discovery.

259
00:15:22,446 --> 00:15:24,113
He knew the evidence would be missing,

260
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:25,548
we'd be left there holding our dicks.

261
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,116
We can find out
who's responsible later.

262
00:15:27,151 --> 00:15:28,651
Right now, we have 24 hours

263
00:15:28,685 --> 00:15:30,954
to find those blood samples,
or to come up with new evidence.

264
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:34,124
And if we don't, Sirko walks.

265
00:15:34,158 --> 00:15:35,792
I'm gonna go
check the evidence room log.

266
00:15:35,827 --> 00:15:38,595
See who's been there
in the last couple of days.

267
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:40,764
The crime scene at Mateo's
hasn't been released yet.

268
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:43,567
Maybe we could re-collect
a sample of Sirko's blood.

269
00:15:43,601 --> 00:15:45,268
Fucking haul your ass over there.

270
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:46,636
Masuka, Quinn, go with him.

271
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:54,778
We let a fish this big slip
through our net,

272
00:15:54,812 --> 00:15:58,281
I'm gonna be very unhappy.

273
00:16:01,152 --> 00:16:02,419
You and me both.

274
00:16:02,453 --> 00:16:04,755
Angel, what's going on
with the restaurant?

275
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,289
I've been approved
to take over the lease,

276
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:09,192
but I still need a few thousand
to keep the place running.

277
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:10,226
What are you gonna do?

278
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,260
Turn over all the cushions,

279
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:12,762
stand in the corner with a tin cup,

280
00:16:12,796 --> 00:16:14,964
I don't know.

281
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:17,634
Ugh. Ugh.

282
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:21,004
Ugh--

283
00:16:21,038 --> 00:16:22,305
Holy shit.

284
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,473
I don't know about the holy,

285
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,675
but there's no denying the shit part.

286
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,678
Fucking Koshkas.

287
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:29,146
They fucked up the sewage line

288
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,682
to contaminate the crime scene.

289
00:16:31,717 --> 00:16:34,319
Which means Sirko will be free soon.

290
00:16:34,354 --> 00:16:36,422
And I'll have to kill him
before he comes after me.

291
00:16:36,456 --> 00:16:37,956
Need any more proof
that there's a mole

292
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,825
- in the department?
- I hate to ask,

293
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,861
but would you guys take a look around,

294
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:43,195
see if there's any blood anywhere

295
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,830
that's not mixed with crap?

296
00:16:44,865 --> 00:16:46,265
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

297
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,234
They do not pay us enough for this.

298
00:16:48,268 --> 00:16:51,036
Quinn, can I talk to you outside?

299
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:52,171
Yeah, why don't you guys wait outside

300
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:54,640
while we're in here vomiting?

301
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,117
The list of visitors
of the evidence lock-up

302
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:05,685
in the last 72 hours.

303
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,087
- Your name's on it.
- So?

304
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:08,422
So what were you doing in there?

305
00:17:08,456 --> 00:17:10,090
I don't know, my job, maybe?

306
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:11,391
I'm a detective,
occasionally I have to go

307
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:12,392
to the evidence lock-up.

308
00:17:12,426 --> 00:17:13,627
What was the case?

309
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:15,895
The Dixon murders.
I gotta testify next week.

310
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,430
Just wanted to make sure
I had my ducks in a row.

311
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:18,731
What the fuck you insinuating?

312
00:17:18,765 --> 00:17:20,667
You're dating a stripper
that works at a club

313
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:22,001
that's owned
by the Koshka brotherhood.

314
00:17:22,036 --> 00:17:24,137
So you think I stole evidence
for the Koshkas?

315
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,204
Doesn't look good.

316
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:26,739
Fuck you.

317
00:17:26,774 --> 00:17:28,808
Hold on.
You're no choirboy,

318
00:17:28,842 --> 00:17:30,209
but I know you wouldn't sink that low.

319
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:31,877
Then why the fuck
are we talking about this?

320
00:17:31,911 --> 00:17:35,180
Because I'm doing my job,

321
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:38,217
and I needed to hear it from you.

322
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:50,363
No, it looks like
it was deliberate, Deb.

323
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:52,899
We're not gonna find any
new evidence, at least not here.

324
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,967
We're halfway through another
sweep of the evidence room,

325
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:56,402
and so far we've got fucking zip.

326
00:17:56,436 --> 00:17:58,337
I don't think
you're gonna find anything.

327
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,938
Neither do I.

328
00:17:59,973 --> 00:18:02,541
Dexter, if this case
falls apart and Isaak walks,

329
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:03,942
he could be on the street tonight.

330
00:18:03,976 --> 00:18:05,076
I know.

331
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,778
Just have to take care of him myself.

332
00:18:06,813 --> 00:18:08,480
Stay the fuck away from him.

333
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:11,049
I don't think ignoring Isaak
is the right approach.

334
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,550
I'm not gonna ignore him.

335
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:14,486
I'm gonna put a tail on him 24/7

336
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,722
until his travel visa expires.

337
00:18:16,756 --> 00:18:18,657
He's not gonna be able
to pick the crust out of his eye

338
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:19,691
without us knowing about it.

339
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:23,428
So don't fucking do anything.

340
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:26,131
I won't.

341
00:18:26,165 --> 00:18:29,267
Except use the time
to get Sal Price off my back.

342
00:18:33,372 --> 00:18:36,340
The address for the sister
of Hannah's late husband.

343
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:40,011
Her name's Lori.

344
00:18:40,045 --> 00:18:42,280
Have you ever heard
of this thing called email?

345
00:18:42,314 --> 00:18:44,348
I like interacting
with people face to face.

346
00:18:44,383 --> 00:18:48,285
Especially when their face
looks like yours.

347
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,787
You can cancel that shit right now.

348
00:18:49,821 --> 00:18:51,088
You got a problem with compliments?

349
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:53,357
Yes, I do,
when they're slightly cheesy

350
00:18:53,391 --> 00:18:55,459
and they come out of the blue, yeah.

351
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:57,327
I'll try to contact Lori

352
00:18:57,361 --> 00:18:59,129
and get permission for the exhumation.

353
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:01,265
Can I tag along, for the interview?

354
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:02,699
No.

355
00:19:02,734 --> 00:19:03,901
It's gonna be awkward enough

356
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,370
without some goofy writer
hovering over us.

357
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:08,038
Well then, maybe we can
meet later for drinks

358
00:19:08,073 --> 00:19:09,206
and you can fill me in.

359
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,675
I did get you the info.

360
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:11,709
Come on.

361
00:19:11,744 --> 00:19:14,712
It'll be totally off the record.

362
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:19,351
Fair enough.

363
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:21,986
But I'm buying.

364
00:19:29,596 --> 00:19:30,997
You all right?

365
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:32,899
I'm okay.

366
00:19:32,933 --> 00:19:35,301
I thought I wasn't
going to see you again.

367
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:36,436
They hurt you?

368
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,570
No.

369
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:39,339
They sent me to their club
in Fort Myers.

370
00:19:39,373 --> 00:19:40,407
I was so scared.

371
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:41,441
I thought for sure they were

372
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:42,876
going to send me back to Kiev.

373
00:19:42,911 --> 00:19:46,380
I'd burn down every one
of their fucking clubs

374
00:19:46,414 --> 00:19:49,917
before I let that happen.

375
00:19:49,952 --> 00:19:51,085
Oh, my God, Joey.

376
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,354
Did you promise them something
to keep me here?

377
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:54,822
Don't worry about it.

378
00:19:54,856 --> 00:19:57,492
I warned you about the Koshkas.

379
00:19:57,526 --> 00:19:58,693
I can take care of myself.

380
00:19:58,727 --> 00:20:00,562
And I can take care of the both of us.

381
00:20:00,596 --> 00:20:02,764
Hmm?
Look at me.

382
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:05,066
Very soon, you're never
gonna have to work

383
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:06,301
for any of those people again.

384
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,469
I--I don't understand.

385
00:20:07,503 --> 00:20:09,505
What w--
what have you done?

386
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:11,707
You're gonna be free.
Trust me.

387
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:23,952
Touched you wanted to be part of

388
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:26,521
my welcome back committee.

389
00:20:26,555 --> 00:20:28,657
More like a parade.

390
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:29,791
Heat like that's gotta make

391
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:32,394
a flight home to Kiev
feel pretty good.

392
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:34,429
Not yet, George.

393
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:37,466
Miami is still overcrowded, by one.

394
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:42,271
So you said this was
about my brother Jake?

395
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:43,272
Yes.

396
00:20:43,307 --> 00:20:45,408
This may be a little upsetting,

397
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:49,145
but we need your permission
to exhume his body.

398
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:51,981
Exhume his body?
Why?

399
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:55,784
Evidence has come to light
that your brother's death

400
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:57,052
may not have been an accident.

401
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,121
But Jake died of a heart attack.

402
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:01,523
We believe he may have been poisoned,

403
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:03,258
and that his wife was responsible.

404
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:05,093
Oh, my God.

405
00:21:05,127 --> 00:21:07,762
- Hannah?
- That's what we're thinking.

406
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:10,065
Did she and your brother get along?

407
00:21:10,099 --> 00:21:12,600
Yeah, they seemed to have
a great relationship.

408
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:15,403
Looked like they were totally in love.

409
00:21:15,437 --> 00:21:19,107
Especially after they found out
she was expecting.

410
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,741
She was pregnant?

411
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,243
Yeah, she told me in confidence.

412
00:21:22,278 --> 00:21:23,378
I was surprised.

413
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:25,580
I didn't think Hannah wanted kids.

414
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:26,581
What happened to the baby?

415
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:28,850
She lost it.

416
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:30,585
Right after Jake's death.

417
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:33,788
It was a miscarriage.

418
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:37,358
You know, after the funeral,
Hannah cut everyone off.

419
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:40,694
It was like my whole side
of the family never existed.

420
00:21:40,729 --> 00:21:42,596
No matter how many times
I reached out,

421
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:45,099
she just wouldn't reciprocate.

422
00:21:45,133 --> 00:21:47,702
Ms. Kirkwood, I think
we can find out for sure

423
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:50,939
what happened to your brother.

424
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:53,842
We just need your help.

425
00:21:57,747 --> 00:21:59,482
That looks heavy.
Need a hand?

426
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:00,950
I need you out of my life.

427
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:01,951
That can be arranged.

428
00:22:01,985 --> 00:22:03,552
All you have to do is talk to me.

429
00:22:03,587 --> 00:22:04,887
Well, everything I have to say to you

430
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:06,155
can be summed up
in two words--

431
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:07,957
Let me guess--
"Fuck off."

432
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:09,992
Glad we got that straight.

433
00:22:10,027 --> 00:22:11,927
I want to write
the authorized biography

434
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:12,961
of Hannah McKay.

435
00:22:12,996 --> 00:22:15,163
It'll go through the roof.

436
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:17,699
God knows I haven't had
a decent seller in years.

437
00:22:17,734 --> 00:22:19,268
- I need this, Hannah.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

438
00:22:19,302 --> 00:22:22,572
I missed the last part over
the sound of my heart breaking.

439
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:25,342
You don't talk to me,
you'll force me to speculate.

440
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,676
Maybe even get creative.

441
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:28,845
It takes brains to be creative.

442
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,149
"Hannah McKay never lost
her taste for killing.

443
00:22:32,183 --> 00:22:35,753
She just updated her technique
from knives to poison."

444
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:40,391
Just an excerpt from the preface.

445
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,260
Along with some material
on one Dexter Morgan--

446
00:22:43,294 --> 00:22:45,262
who's a fan of my work, by the way,

447
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:50,201
and how he manipulated evidence
to help the woman he loved.

448
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,469
I'll deny everything.

449
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:55,607
Which will be great publicity.

450
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:58,210
Okay.

451
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,978
Fine, we'll talk.

452
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:04,149
Just keep Dexter out of this.

453
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:07,052
Depends on what you give me.

454
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:10,088
My house, tomorrow,
4:00 P.M.

455
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:23,435
Hello?

456
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:24,736
It's your favorite author.

457
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:27,806
Decided to take you up
on your Wayne Randall offer.

458
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
You won't be sorry.

459
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:30,008
I'll come to your place.

460
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,711
How's tomorrow night sound?
7:00 P.M.?

461
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,546
7:00 it is.

462
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:41,152
Price covered a lot of murders
during his career.

463
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:45,924
The bloodier, the better.

464
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,259
He likes getting at
his cases from the inside.

465
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:54,465
You can't get more inside
than becoming a suspect.

466
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,369
Christy Lawson.

467
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,470
Her killer was never found.

468
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:02,572
Price wrote a book about her case.

469
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:06,609
One of his best sellers.

470
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:09,645
All I need is Price's DNA
to link him to the crime.

471
00:24:19,222 --> 00:24:21,190
You should throw that away, Dex.

472
00:24:24,594 --> 00:24:26,561
Hannah needs to know what's going on.

473
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:28,763
You're looking for an excuse
to see her.

474
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:31,799
You could just pick up the phone.

475
00:24:40,776 --> 00:24:41,843
Christ, Joey.

476
00:24:41,877 --> 00:24:42,944
You're here so often, we gotta get you

477
00:24:42,978 --> 00:24:44,012
your own parking spot.

478
00:24:44,046 --> 00:24:45,079
I did what you wanted.

479
00:24:45,113 --> 00:24:46,814
The evidence against Sirko is gone.

480
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,082
I want Nadia's passport.

481
00:24:48,117 --> 00:24:49,317
She's done with you,

482
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:51,119
and your whole
shitty fuckin' organization.

483
00:24:51,153 --> 00:24:53,922
Is she?

484
00:24:57,193 --> 00:24:58,694
Yeah, and so am I.

485
00:24:58,728 --> 00:25:00,496
We've been working so well together.

486
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:01,664
Why kill a good thing?

487
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:02,731
Who do you think you're fucking with?

488
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:04,233
Think I'm some fuckin' asshole,

489
00:25:04,267 --> 00:25:05,568
one of your little fuckin' bag men?

490
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:06,769
- Take it easy.
- You know how badly

491
00:25:06,803 --> 00:25:07,803
I could fuck you up?

492
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:08,971
It goes two ways, detective.

493
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:10,506
You destroyed police evidence.

494
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,807
That'll get you thrown off the force.

495
00:25:11,842 --> 00:25:13,743
Hell, you'd probably do time.

496
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:15,512
Stay the fuck away from me.

497
00:25:15,546 --> 00:25:17,247
That's not gonna happen, Joey.

498
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:19,249
So you think real hard
about your next move,

499
00:25:19,283 --> 00:25:21,685
and what it means for your future.

500
00:25:21,719 --> 00:25:24,855
And Nadia's.

501
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,713
You managed to stay away
from me for one whole day.

502
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:49,848
What happened to our plan?

503
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:50,949
Sal Price happened.

504
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:52,084
Price?

505
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,086
He saw us together
when I dropped you off.

506
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,889
He threatened to put me in his book.

507
00:25:57,924 --> 00:26:00,559
I can't let that happen.

508
00:26:00,594 --> 00:26:01,727
There's more.

509
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:03,362
He showed up at the flower mart.

510
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:06,432
He wants me to go on record
about my time with Wayne,

511
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:10,470
or he'll say that I'm a murderer.

512
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:12,438
I'm going to handle Price.

513
00:26:12,473 --> 00:26:15,342
Like the way you handled me?

514
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:19,312
Not exactly.
I only go after killers.

515
00:26:19,346 --> 00:26:20,447
Like me.

516
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:23,483
It's the code I live by.

517
00:26:25,653 --> 00:26:28,622
Code, huh?

518
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:30,624
You know, sometimes
life just has to be taken.

519
00:26:30,658 --> 00:26:33,627
There's no need to dress it up.

520
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:36,363
It's more than that.

521
00:26:36,397 --> 00:26:39,700
I think you're just afraid
to admit that you enjoy killing.

522
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:44,639
And you don't?

523
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:47,207
No.

524
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:48,475
Killing for me is just

525
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,577
surrendering to nature's way.

526
00:26:50,612 --> 00:26:53,580
Nature adds and subtracts.

527
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:57,384
Survival of the fittest.

528
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,786
So you're the fittest.

529
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,789
So far.

530
00:27:05,027 --> 00:27:06,894
You ever wonder what it would be like

531
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,964
if you didn't have all these rules?

532
00:27:15,204 --> 00:27:18,674
Price doesn't have to die.

533
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:21,210
I can get him to back off for good.

534
00:27:21,244 --> 00:27:22,878
I'm used to dealing
with things on my own.

535
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:24,580
I don't need somebody to protect me.

536
00:27:24,614 --> 00:27:27,483
I know you don't.

537
00:27:27,517 --> 00:27:30,619
But I have this covered.

538
00:27:30,654 --> 00:27:35,024
Consider it
a good-bye present.

539
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:37,293
Okay.

540
00:27:37,327 --> 00:27:41,097
Well, I suppose
we're going for a record.

541
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:42,265
A record?

542
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,469
How many times we can
say good-bye for good.

543
00:27:49,473 --> 00:27:51,007
Goodbye.

544
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:06,791
She isn't drawn to my darkness
like Lila,

545
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:08,493
or blind to it like Rita,

546
00:28:08,527 --> 00:28:10,562
and she doesn't need it like Lumen.

547
00:28:10,596 --> 00:28:13,131
She accepts both sides of me.

548
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:17,036
The whole Dexter.

549
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:21,007
So why am I walking away from this?

550
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:22,575
Because when some chemicals mix

551
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,545
they combust, and explode.

552
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,416
You don't have to be here.

553
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:32,152
He's my brother.

554
00:28:32,186 --> 00:28:35,655
I understand.

555
00:28:35,689 --> 00:28:38,658
- You okay?
- Yeah.

556
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:50,569
What the fuck?

557
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,471
There's no tissue.

558
00:28:52,506 --> 00:28:53,572
That normal?

559
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,041
It is if the body wasn't embalmed.

560
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:57,609
Isn't that standard procedure?

561
00:28:57,644 --> 00:28:59,945
Unless the next of kin
specifies otherwise.

562
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:03,582
Can we do the tests?

563
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,083
Not on bones, Lieutenant.

564
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:08,120
There's nothing I can do here.

565
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:14,560
What is it?

566
00:29:14,594 --> 00:29:17,329
Your brother's remains--

567
00:29:20,734 --> 00:29:22,467
he wasn't embalmed.

568
00:29:22,502 --> 00:29:23,736
Wha-- I don't understand.

569
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,204
We can't run the tests.

570
00:29:25,238 --> 00:29:27,539
So you're saying
this was all for nothing?

571
00:29:27,574 --> 00:29:31,176
I'm gonna find out
what happened, Lori.

572
00:29:31,211 --> 00:29:34,680
I'm not gonna give up.

573
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:49,595
I can see this was a good idea.

574
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:50,462
You look like

575
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,297
you need a drink.

576
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,233
Yeah, or five.

577
00:29:54,267 --> 00:29:55,467
Excuse me.

578
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,468
Bottled brew for the lady.

579
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,603
Uh--actually,

580
00:29:57,637 --> 00:30:01,607
can I get a double scotch,
neat, please?

581
00:30:01,641 --> 00:30:03,008
When do you get the test results

582
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:04,243
for the exhumation?

583
00:30:04,277 --> 00:30:05,878
We won't.

584
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:07,179
The body was more like
a pile of bones.

585
00:30:07,214 --> 00:30:08,180
There was nothing to test.

586
00:30:08,214 --> 00:30:09,982
Shit.
He wasn't embalmed.

587
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,416
Yeah, and--
big surprise here--

588
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:12,651
it was all at the discretion of...

589
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,853
Hannah.

590
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:17,490
Thank you.

591
00:30:22,328 --> 00:30:26,065
That poor woman had to watch
her dead brother be dug up.

592
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:27,133
And for what?

593
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:29,035
I put her through fuckin' hell.

594
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:30,970
You couldn't anticipate this.

595
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:32,204
- It's not your fault.
- Well, it doesn't make it

596
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,273
any better.

597
00:30:34,307 --> 00:30:38,177
Sometimes my job really fuckin' sucks.

598
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,545
Actually, it always sucks.

599
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:40,846
Why do you do it?

600
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:42,882
'Cause I don't know
how to do fuck-all else.

601
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,184
I'm sure that's not true.

602
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:46,620
Oh, God, if you are
building up to a compliment

603
00:30:46,654 --> 00:30:48,822
now is really not the time.

604
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:51,324
Look.

605
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:52,959
I'm gonna interview Hannah later.

606
00:30:52,994 --> 00:30:54,160
Maybe I can pull something out of her.

607
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:55,628
Gross.

608
00:30:57,831 --> 00:31:00,699
Well, you can tell me
how it went over dinner.

609
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,735
I might even let you pay.

610
00:31:08,841 --> 00:31:10,976
Lemonade?

611
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,014
I'll pass.

612
00:31:19,051 --> 00:31:20,285
Should we get started?

613
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,156
I just want to make sure
that we're clear.

614
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:27,225
You're going to forget
about Dexter Morgan.

615
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,727
He really got
under your skin, didn't he?

616
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,095
Just tell me that you understand.

617
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:31,997
Never heard of him.

618
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:40,839
We'll start with the couple
from the motel.

619
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,723
I just need enough of Price's DNA

620
00:31:57,757 --> 00:31:59,758
to plant at a crime scene.

621
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:06,432
Traces of blood.

622
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,468
Good for me, bad for his gums.

623
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:42,835
The more you linger, the greater

624
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:44,404
the chance of being caught.

625
00:32:44,438 --> 00:32:46,239
Crime scene data, audio interviews.

626
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:49,676
It's Price's research on Hannah.

627
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,812
If I get rid of it,
it'll cripple his book.

628
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,447
Maybe kill it.

629
00:32:53,481 --> 00:32:54,781
You didn't come here
to protect Hannah.

630
00:32:54,816 --> 00:32:57,785
You need to think
about yourself right now.

631
00:33:13,734 --> 00:33:16,535
Wayne gave me the knife

632
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:20,639
and told me to guard the woman.

633
00:33:20,674 --> 00:33:24,676
I figured it'd be easy,
seeing as how scared she was.

634
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,847
What was Wayne doing?

635
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,583
He started to stab the husband.

636
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:35,720
Over and over and over.

637
00:33:35,755 --> 00:33:40,626
The woman was screaming like crazy.

638
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,227
The man she loved was getting knifed

639
00:33:42,262 --> 00:33:45,831
in front of her eyes.

640
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:47,766
But he, uh--
he didn't--

641
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,335
he didn't give up.

642
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:53,638
He grabbed Wayne
and he pulled him toward him.

643
00:33:53,672 --> 00:33:56,374
And--and then the woman
jumped on Wayne.

644
00:33:56,408 --> 00:33:57,508
The woman you were guarding.

645
00:33:57,543 --> 00:34:00,544
Yeah, she was just
protecting her husband.

646
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:02,780
I don't blame her, I--

647
00:34:02,814 --> 00:34:05,782
I would've done the same thing.

648
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:11,922
Keep going.

649
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:15,358
Wayne was yelling for me
to get her off him, so I--

650
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:18,295
I grabbed her by the hair and
I pulled her to the bed,

651
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:19,963
and she just--

652
00:34:19,997 --> 00:34:22,632
she just kept screaming,
and s--

653
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:24,935
and screaming.

654
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,103
So I--

655
00:34:27,138 --> 00:34:30,774
I stabbed her.

656
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:33,444
And she just kept screaming.

657
00:34:33,478 --> 00:34:36,446
And there was so much blood.

658
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:45,020
What did you do?

659
00:34:45,054 --> 00:34:50,526
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

660
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:08,545
Take a second.

661
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:27,230
Looks tasty.

662
00:35:27,264 --> 00:35:30,800
Certainly better than the swill
I've choked on of late.

663
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:34,337
Don't worry, I haven't come down here

664
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:35,472
to cause you harm.

665
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,841
Not yet.

666
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:39,743
Not with Miami Metro's finest

667
00:35:39,777 --> 00:35:42,913
shadowing my every move.

668
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:44,849
Yes, I certainly hope
they are the finest.

669
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:46,083
For your sake.

670
00:35:49,854 --> 00:35:51,655
What do you want?

671
00:35:51,689 --> 00:35:53,556
Well, so long as
I'm waiting around to kill you

672
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:55,559
I thought we might have a little chat.

673
00:35:58,696 --> 00:36:01,665
Mmm.
Good chips.

674
00:36:03,034 --> 00:36:05,535
While I was incarcerated,

675
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:10,507
I found myself plagued
with a nagging question.

676
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:12,542
I mean, I will move heaven and earth

677
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:14,710
to snuff out your life
because you killed Viktor--

678
00:36:14,745 --> 00:36:19,148
in fact, I was so blinded
by my desire for vengeance

679
00:36:19,182 --> 00:36:23,085
that you were able to lead me
into a trap.

680
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,024
A mistake I assure you
won't happen again.

681
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:29,558
We have a cartoon in America

682
00:36:29,593 --> 00:36:32,361
about a coyote
who chases after a roadrunner.

683
00:36:32,396 --> 00:36:33,496
He keeps thinking that.

684
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:36,032
He keeps rocket-skating
right off the cliff.

685
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:41,737
You see, I know what motivates me.

686
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:43,639
But what I don't know
is what drove you

687
00:36:43,674 --> 00:36:44,674
to kill my friend.

688
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:46,409
I told you.
He killed Mike Anderson.

689
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:48,077
A man you barely knew for what,

690
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:50,413
less than three months?

691
00:36:50,447 --> 00:36:52,514
Oh, it's all public record.

692
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:54,751
No.

693
00:36:54,785 --> 00:36:58,421
You didn't kill Viktor
out of vengeance.

694
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:00,957
I have a feeling

695
00:37:00,991 --> 00:37:03,727
that you're a different
kind of animal.

696
00:37:03,761 --> 00:37:06,162
The question is...

697
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:07,631
what kind are you,

698
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:11,301
Dexter Morgan?

699
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:12,803
The kind who hunted your friend down

700
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:13,937
and strapped him to a board,

701
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:16,874
and put a plastic bag on his head,

702
00:37:16,908 --> 00:37:19,377
and crushed his skull
with a fire extinguisher.

703
00:37:22,648 --> 00:37:24,616
The kind who's going to
do the same thing to you,

704
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,518
give or take the fire extinguisher.

705
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,662
You're going to regret
sharing that with me.

706
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:46,504
For the chip.

707
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,851
This is the last load.

708
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:03,256
- Thanks, Jamie.
- Mm-hmm.

709
00:38:04,459 --> 00:38:06,559
You know, you're an interesting guy.

710
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:17,237
Have a seat.

711
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:19,840
I should do my next book on you.

712
00:38:19,874 --> 00:38:21,208
Believe me,

713
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:22,910
I know a good story when I hear one.

714
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,580
You know, as a blood spatter analyst,

715
00:38:26,614 --> 00:38:30,551
I'm kind of a storyteller myself.

716
00:38:30,585 --> 00:38:31,752
Only difference between us is

717
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:33,754
your medium's ink, and mine's blood.

718
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:34,855
Interesting observation.

719
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:37,291
Uh, before we talk about Wayne,

720
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:39,994
I have a story idea of my own.

721
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:41,663
Uh, mostly non-fiction.

722
00:38:41,697 --> 00:38:44,266
I wanted to get your take.

723
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,668
I'm all ears.

724
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:49,037
So new DNA evidence pops up

725
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:52,874
in the unsolved murder
of Christy Lawson.

726
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:56,478
You know, the jogger who was
killed near Matheson Park.

727
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:59,281
It turns out that the DNA

728
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:01,816
belongs to a true crime writer.

729
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:03,485
You said it was
mostly non-fiction.

730
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:05,020
Sounds like it's all bullshit.

731
00:39:05,054 --> 00:39:07,957
Well, the anonymous tip
is real enough.

732
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:10,692
The one that mentions Sal Price.

733
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:13,462
It seems he wrote
a very successful book

734
00:39:13,496 --> 00:39:14,997
about the same case.

735
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:17,834
Now it turns out he was her killer.

736
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:21,805
You have to appreciate the irony.

737
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,076
How do you plan
to make this happen, exactly?

738
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,177
Let's just say you're gonna need

739
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:30,447
a new electric toothbrush.

740
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:31,581
You broke into my apartment?

741
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:33,850
No, I very carefully picked your lock.

742
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:35,385
By the way, it's time
to visit the dentist.

743
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,920
You son of a bitch!

744
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,188
Hey, it's nothing personal.

745
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:39,656
I just can't have you
messing with my life.

746
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,159
Fuck you!

747
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:45,595
You're not gonna get away with this.

748
00:39:45,629 --> 00:39:47,296
I'm gonna ruin your--

749
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:54,103
Hannah.

750
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,137
God, what happened?

751
00:39:55,171 --> 00:39:58,274
Call 911.

752
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,780
911, what is your emergency?

753
00:40:05,815 --> 00:40:08,517
I need an ambulance
at 8240 Palm Terrace.

754
00:40:08,551 --> 00:40:10,119
Apartment 10.

755
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:22,432
So I came in
to see if Dexter was okay,

756
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:25,068
and I saw that guy on the floor.

757
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:27,437
Uh, Dexter told me to call 911,

758
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:28,739
and he started CPR.

759
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:30,073
Did you hear anything
before the crash?

760
00:40:30,108 --> 00:40:32,042
There was some shouting.

761
00:40:32,076 --> 00:40:33,076
Kinda like an argument.

762
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,211
Dexter's voice?

763
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:37,081
Mm, I didn't recognize the voice.

764
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:40,651
I administered CPR
until the paramedics showed up,

765
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,420
but he was unresponsive.

766
00:40:42,454 --> 00:40:44,288
Okay, Dex.
I think it's all here.

767
00:40:44,323 --> 00:40:49,160
Hey, were you and Price
arguing before he collapsed?

768
00:40:49,194 --> 00:40:50,928
The interview might have
gotten a little heated.

769
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:52,096
How heated?

770
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,697
He accused me

771
00:40:53,732 --> 00:40:56,334
of sloppy work
on the Wayne Randall case.

772
00:40:56,368 --> 00:40:58,836
I might have raised my voice a little.

773
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:01,438
That's all.

774
00:41:01,473 --> 00:41:03,174
A contusion to the head.

775
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,308
The source of all the blood.

776
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:05,943
But that's not enough to kill a man.

777
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:07,945
Okay, just wait
for the medical examiner

778
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:10,147
to get here, okay?

779
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:28,666
Why all the blood, Dex?

780
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:30,868
His head struck the table as he fell.

781
00:41:30,903 --> 00:41:33,170
Jesus.

782
00:41:33,205 --> 00:41:35,940
You okay?

783
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:38,710
No, I'm not okay.

784
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:39,844
I can't even have a drink with someone

785
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:40,846
without them dying.

786
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,582
- You had a drink with him?
- Yeah.

787
00:41:43,616 --> 00:41:45,984
He was nice, you know?
I liked him.

788
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:48,554
Did Price tell Deb
about me and Hannah?

789
00:41:48,588 --> 00:41:49,655
Doubtful.

790
00:41:49,689 --> 00:41:51,123
Deb would have already brought it up.

791
00:41:51,157 --> 00:41:52,191
I can't believe--

792
00:41:52,225 --> 00:41:53,258
I'm sorry, Deb.

793
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,827
I wish I could tell you what happened.

794
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:55,861
I know what happened.

795
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:58,664
Hannah McKay.

796
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:00,600
She killed Price.

797
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:02,568
- What makes you think that?
- He was convinced that

798
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:04,537
she stabbed one of the victims
on the spree.

799
00:42:04,571 --> 00:42:05,638
And that she kept on killing.

800
00:42:05,673 --> 00:42:07,707
Her husband, other people.

801
00:42:07,741 --> 00:42:10,510
All with poison. He was gonna
put it in his book.

802
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:12,979
She poisoned Price.

803
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:15,948
It's not a coincidence.

804
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:16,982
How would she pull that off?

805
00:42:17,017 --> 00:42:19,552
I don't know.

806
00:42:19,586 --> 00:42:20,753
But I'm gonna pick her up
for questioning.

807
00:42:20,787 --> 00:42:25,391
I'm gonna run a tox screen
on his body.

808
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:27,126
She's not gonna get away with it.

809
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,162
Not this time.

810
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,774
Hannah must know that Price's body

811
00:42:42,808 --> 00:42:45,776
will be tested for poison.

812
00:42:45,811 --> 00:42:47,778
So why isn't she concerned?

813
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:50,814
Or is she just that good at hiding it?

814
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:03,627
Mrs. McKay,
I'm Lieutenant Morgan.

815
00:43:03,661 --> 00:43:05,362
Do you want anything
before we get started?

816
00:43:05,396 --> 00:43:06,596
A water?
Coffee?

817
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,699
Uh, just want to know
what I'm doing here.

818
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:11,435
Okay.

819
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:13,770
Sal Price is dead.

820
00:43:13,804 --> 00:43:14,938
Oh, my God.

821
00:43:14,972 --> 00:43:16,706
She is that good.

822
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:18,341
Uh, what happened?

823
00:43:18,376 --> 00:43:21,312
I was hoping you could tell me that.

824
00:43:21,346 --> 00:43:23,113
How can I do that?

825
00:43:23,148 --> 00:43:24,482
Ms. McKay,
I was really hoping

826
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:25,850
that we could cut through the crap.

827
00:43:25,884 --> 00:43:28,019
Sal Price was writing a book on you.

828
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:30,554
You didn't like it,
so you poisoned him.

829
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:33,523
That's crazy.

830
00:43:33,558 --> 00:43:35,692
You're a killer,
Ms. McKay.

831
00:43:35,727 --> 00:43:37,494
You're a fucking good one,
I'll give you that.

832
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:39,964
You've gotten away with it
for a long time.

833
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:42,966
But I have a blood report
on Beverly Grey

834
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:45,002
that proves she was killed by a plant

835
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:47,204
that grows on your property.

836
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:49,807
And I have a forensics report
on the Wayne Randall bodies

837
00:43:49,841 --> 00:43:52,843
that prove that you stabbed
one of their victims to death.

838
00:43:54,579 --> 00:43:56,947
I'm not even sure
why we're talking about that.

839
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:59,549
I have immunity
for the Wayne Randall killings.

840
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,817
Right,

841
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:03,520
and the Beverly Grey evidence
is circumstantial.

842
00:44:03,555 --> 00:44:06,122
Unless I can tie it to
the poisons that I'm gonna find

843
00:44:06,157 --> 00:44:08,692
in the tox screen that
I just ordered for Sal Price.

844
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:12,462
That is gonna nail
your fucking ass to the floor.

845
00:44:12,496 --> 00:44:13,863
I didn't do anything to Sal.

846
00:44:13,898 --> 00:44:15,965
No. He just dropped dead
of a heart attack.

847
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,033
Sometimes people die.

848
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:18,535
It doesn't mean
that they were poisoned.

849
00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:21,804
Is that what happened to your husband?

850
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,039
Did he just die?

851
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:25,775
Along with your unborn baby?

852
00:44:25,809 --> 00:44:27,076
What the fuck happened,
Ms. McKay?

853
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,145
Was he pressuring you
to have a family?

854
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,381
Was it making you feel trapped?

855
00:44:33,284 --> 00:44:36,352
She's not acting.

856
00:44:36,387 --> 00:44:38,688
Charge me with something,
or let me go.

857
00:44:38,723 --> 00:44:40,957
I am trying to give you an opportunity

858
00:44:40,991 --> 00:44:44,327
to come clean about Sal Price.

859
00:44:44,362 --> 00:44:45,595
You'll be doing yourself a big favor

860
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,130
when your case comes to trial.

861
00:44:47,165 --> 00:44:48,498
- Am I done here?
- Yeah. You're done.

862
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,500
Trust me.

863
00:44:53,004 --> 00:44:55,105
You know, my grandma has this saying.

864
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:58,409
"Trust those who seek the truth,

865
00:44:58,443 --> 00:45:01,412
"but doubt those who say
that they have found it."

866
00:45:03,182 --> 00:45:05,350
My grandma wasn't ever wrong.

867
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:21,566
Hannah survived Deb's questioning,

868
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,802
but she might not make it
through mine.

869
00:45:32,678 --> 00:45:34,112
Price was going to destroy my life.

870
00:45:34,146 --> 00:45:35,313
I had to do something.

871
00:45:35,347 --> 00:45:37,315
I told you I would take care of it.

872
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:39,583
Well, you weren't exactly
giving me progress reports.

873
00:45:39,618 --> 00:45:41,886
I saw a chance and I took it.

874
00:45:43,956 --> 00:45:45,590
I was doing it for you too.

875
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:47,992
For me?
He died in my apartment!

876
00:45:49,995 --> 00:45:52,362
My living room is a crime scene.

877
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:54,798
You know who I am, what that
means to someone like me.

878
00:45:54,832 --> 00:45:57,000
I figured it would kick in
while Price was on the road,

879
00:45:57,034 --> 00:46:00,002
a convenient auto accident.

880
00:46:01,905 --> 00:46:04,373
How'd you do it?

881
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:05,640
Is it really important?

882
00:46:05,675 --> 00:46:07,209
Is life in prison important?

883
00:46:07,243 --> 00:46:10,245
I'm never going to prison.

884
00:46:12,615 --> 00:46:15,718
Price liked to chew on his pens.

885
00:46:15,752 --> 00:46:17,219
The last one had
a little something on it,

886
00:46:17,253 --> 00:46:18,420
completely undetectable.

887
00:46:18,454 --> 00:46:19,455
You better hope so.

888
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:22,424
I know so.

889
00:46:22,459 --> 00:46:25,661
Just wish I could've destroyed
Price's book along with him.

890
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:33,169
Actually, I took care of Price's book.

891
00:46:33,203 --> 00:46:35,939
You what?

892
00:46:35,973 --> 00:46:38,642
How?

893
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:41,078
I was at his apartment,

894
00:46:41,112 --> 00:46:42,846
collecting DNA samples

895
00:46:42,881 --> 00:46:47,217
for my now-defunct plan
to get him to shut up,

896
00:46:47,252 --> 00:46:50,254
and I erased his research on you.

897
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:54,324
Thanks.

898
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:58,663
It only took a minute.

899
00:46:58,697 --> 00:47:03,001
I could feel you watching me
while I was being interrogated.

900
00:47:04,304 --> 00:47:06,004
You saw the whole thing, didn't you?

901
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:08,840
Is it true about your husband?

902
00:47:08,874 --> 00:47:11,108
Did you kill him because you
didn't want a family?

903
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:12,309
It was the opposite.

904
00:47:12,344 --> 00:47:16,613
I wanted a family, and he didn't.

905
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:20,183
He threatened to leave me
unless I got an abortion.

906
00:47:23,754 --> 00:47:25,321
What happened to the baby?

907
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:28,358
It was a miscarriage.

908
00:47:29,794 --> 00:47:32,762
Sometimes life subtracts.

909
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:37,567
Sometimes it adds.

910
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,405
Do you realize what happened?

911
00:47:41,439 --> 00:47:44,408
We were looking out for each other.

912
00:47:46,444 --> 00:47:49,080
That's big for people like us,

913
00:47:49,114 --> 00:47:51,582
maybe even historic.

914
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:42,736
What's this?

915
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:43,770
For your restaurant.

916
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:45,505
- It's 10 grand.
- You know I got

917
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:47,107
that inheritance a while back.

918
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:48,608
I've been looking for
the right place to invest.

919
00:48:48,643 --> 00:48:50,109
I can't take this.
What are you, crazy?

920
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:52,011
Why, you too good
for my fucking money?

921
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:54,013
No, this is way too generous.

922
00:48:54,048 --> 00:48:55,281
Bullshit.
It's family money.

923
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:58,083
- You're family to me.
- Quinn--

924
00:48:58,117 --> 00:49:01,686
Look, you're stuck with it.
I'm not taking it back.

925
00:49:03,122 --> 00:49:06,123
I do expect a few free meals, though.

926
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,861
This is a loan, you asshole.

927
00:49:10,895 --> 00:49:12,229
I'm gonna pay you back.

928
00:49:12,264 --> 00:49:15,232
Okay, big guy.
We're good.

929
00:49:29,782 --> 00:49:33,652
Report's back
on the tox screen on Sal Price.

930
00:49:33,686 --> 00:49:36,022
This can't be right.

931
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,791
M.E. ran it twice.
Negative both times.

932
00:49:43,062 --> 00:49:46,064
That fucking bitch is gonna
get away with it again.

933
00:50:15,864 --> 00:50:17,132
Wayne was yelling

934
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,533
for me to get her off him,

935
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:21,202
so I grabbed her by the hair
and I pulled her to the bed,

936
00:50:21,236 --> 00:50:27,341
and--and she just--she just
kept screaming and screaming

937
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:31,412
so I--
I stabbed her,

938
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:36,384
and she just kept screaming
and there was so much blood.

939
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,252
What did you do?

940
00:50:38,287 --> 00:50:42,891
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

941
00:50:53,036 --> 00:50:54,403
Not only can't I kill her,

942
00:50:54,437 --> 00:50:56,038
I can't seem to stay away from her.

943
00:50:56,072 --> 00:51:00,976
Even when I'm not with Hannah,
she's there, in my head.

944
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:02,511
When some elements come together,

945
00:51:02,545 --> 00:51:05,714
they create a reaction
that can't be reversed.

946
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:08,183
They transcend chemistry.

947
00:51:08,218 --> 00:51:12,688
Is this what love feels like?

948
00:51:12,722 --> 00:51:15,691
Is this how it begins?

949
00:51:15,725 --> 00:51:17,493
Am I even capable of this?

950
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:27,736
Hello?

951
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:31,172
Hannah McKay killed Sal Price,

952
00:51:31,206 --> 00:51:34,342
and she's gonna walk.

953
00:51:34,376 --> 00:51:36,711
She's gonna get away with it,

954
00:51:36,746 --> 00:51:39,747
and we both know
she's gonna kill again.

955
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,952
Deb, can we talk about this
in the morning?

956
00:51:44,986 --> 00:51:49,156
He didn't deserve to die.

957
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:52,125
I can't let this happen.

958
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,129
There has to be some fucking justice.

959
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:00,234
It's you, Dex.

960
00:52:00,268 --> 00:52:03,671
Me?

961
00:52:03,705 --> 00:52:06,573
You know what I'm saying?

962
00:52:06,608 --> 00:52:11,311
She deserves it.

963
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:13,280
I want you to make it right.

964
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:18,385
Do what you do.

965
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:30,772
