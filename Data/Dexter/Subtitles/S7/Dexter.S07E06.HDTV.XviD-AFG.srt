1
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:44,920
- Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>
- Laguerta found a blood slide

2
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:48,056
with Travis Marshall's blood
on it at the fucking church.

3
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:50,726
I talked her into letting me
help with the Bay Harbor Butcher

4
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,561
investigation so I can keep tabs

5
00:01:52,596 --> 00:01:56,499
- on what's happening.
- You what?

6
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,234
That toy isn't bringing back memories

7
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,569
of being scared.

8
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:04,640
She was straddled by her assailant.

9
00:02:04,674 --> 00:02:05,941
Wayne didn't kill that woman.

10
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:08,110
Well, it was someone smaller.

11
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:09,678
Stabbed the woman over and over

12
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:10,946
until the knife got so bloody

13
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:13,182
her hand slipped along the edge

14
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:16,085
of the sharp blade,
cutting her palm very deeply.

15
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,355
Everything you've said is a lie.

16
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,957
That's my story...

17
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:23,860
and I'm sticking to it.

18
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,762
Did you get the blood report back?

19
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:28,531
From the bodies from the dig?

20
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:29,933
Yeah.

21
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:33,169
Anything I should know?

22
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:34,437
Nope.

23
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:36,339
Just forget about work.

24
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:38,141
Joey Quinn.

25
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,809
Used to have
an understanding with him.

26
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,777
Leave a bag of cash in his car,

27
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:44,046
and he'd do whatever we asked.

28
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,955
He drew his gun as the attacker fired.

29
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:57,860
This blood is from a defensive wound.

30
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:01,197
So, you got arrested,
there'll be a trial,

31
00:03:01,231 --> 00:03:03,333
you'll go to prison for a long time.

32
00:03:03,367 --> 00:03:06,036
Does that mean this is over?

33
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,805
No.

34
00:03:07,925 --> 00:03:18,400
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

35
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:22,722
Hannah McKay.

36
00:03:22,757 --> 00:03:25,791
She stabbed a woman five times.
And since I found out,

37
00:03:25,826 --> 00:03:28,628
all I can think about is giving
her what she deserves.

38
00:03:28,662 --> 00:03:30,663
Maybe she deserves a little slack.

39
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:33,866
When she killed that woman,
she was only 15.

40
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:36,001
Scared of Wayne.
On the run.

41
00:03:36,036 --> 00:03:37,970
It could have been
a one-time thing.

42
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:40,505
I saw the way
she touched her trophies.

43
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,574
Nostalgic.

44
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:45,643
And when you like to kill,
you don't just stop.

45
00:03:45,678 --> 00:03:47,512
She must have killed
again since Wayne.

46
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:49,347
You have no evidence to support that.

47
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:52,550
Her husband died
of a heart attack at 40?

48
00:03:52,584 --> 00:03:54,685
Perfect health, no family history.

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,187
Seems suspicious.

50
00:03:56,221 --> 00:03:58,022
You're really reaching here, Dexter.

51
00:03:58,057 --> 00:04:00,892
I know she killed her husband.
I can feel it.

52
00:04:00,927 --> 00:04:02,894
I just need proof.

53
00:04:02,928 --> 00:04:04,763
Don't you have more pressing concerns?

54
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:06,064
Debra. Laguerta.

55
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:07,498
Isaak.

56
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:11,502
Why do you think
I need a kill so badly?

57
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:16,773
Where do you think you're going?

58
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,108
To talk to her.

59
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:19,909
Get her to slip up about her husband.

60
00:04:19,944 --> 00:04:21,577
Give me a lead.

61
00:04:21,612 --> 00:04:24,213
What makes you think
she'll tell you anything?

62
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:27,883
Last time you saw her,
you accused her of murder.

63
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:29,952
Good point.

64
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:34,190
I need a peace offering.

65
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:37,026
This is a big opportunity
for the department.

66
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,461
Arresting the head of
the Koshka brotherhood

67
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:39,729
is as good as getting
John fucking Gotti.

68
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:45,034
Sorry I'm late.

69
00:04:45,068 --> 00:04:46,803
I can't even be late
without making Deb angry.

70
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:48,471
You all did great work.

71
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,974
The arraignment went well,
and Sirko was denied bail.

72
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,109
But he has a small army of lawyers,

73
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:54,978
and I'm sure they're already
putting his bail up for review.

74
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:57,547
No way he'll get out.
Not on three counts of murder.

75
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:59,048
Well, I hope you're right.

76
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:00,917
So do I.
As long as Isaak's behind bars,

77
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,151
I'll have time to deal with Hannah.

78
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:03,586
Of course he's right.

79
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,655
The guy killed
three fucking Colombians.

80
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:07,657
Plus, we have blood evidence
that puts Sirko at the scene.

81
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:10,293
None of that will matter
if his team claims self defense.

82
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:12,929
It's a solid case, Lieutenant.

83
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,664
But we still need to make sure
that the captain is prepared

84
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,566
for any questions
the D.A. may ask.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,668
Look, we have all seen cases

86
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:20,603
that we thought were
a sure thing go south.

87
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:22,805
The right lawyers, the right jury,

88
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,641
anything can happen.

89
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:29,012
Which is why the D.A. wants
to make sure it doesn't.

90
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:39,790
At least I can make
a peace offering to one woman

91
00:05:39,824 --> 00:05:43,694
in my life.

92
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:45,496
If I want Hannah to give
me the time of day,

93
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:47,131
I need to show her I'm not a threat.

94
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:49,867
And how do you intend to do that?

95
00:05:49,902 --> 00:05:51,202
I haven't filled out the blood report

96
00:05:51,236 --> 00:05:52,670
for those bodies we dug up yet.

97
00:05:52,704 --> 00:05:55,840
I could fudge it.
Omit some key facts.

98
00:05:55,874 --> 00:05:57,308
Forget to run the blood
on the victim's

99
00:05:57,342 --> 00:06:00,311
dress for Hannah's DNA.

100
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:03,347
The cops think Wayne Randall
killed those people.

101
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,183
If I don't tell them otherwise,
they won't know different.

102
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:07,018
Didn't you promise your sister

103
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:09,354
you wouldn't take cases
from the police?

104
00:06:09,388 --> 00:06:13,391
Hannah has immunity.

105
00:06:13,425 --> 00:06:14,726
Nothing the cops can do.

106
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,562
Telling Deb will only make her crazy.

107
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,130
And what, you think
you'll just show Hannah

108
00:06:19,165 --> 00:06:20,832
a copy of this report,
and she'll confess?

109
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:24,202
Tell you she killed her husband?

110
00:06:24,236 --> 00:06:27,305
What other choice do I have?

111
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,591
You're blocking my view.

112
00:06:47,626 --> 00:06:49,860
It's a wall.

113
00:06:49,895 --> 00:06:52,330
To you, perhaps.

114
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:54,065
To me it's a blank canvas.

115
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:55,766
A projection screen for the mind.

116
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:59,537
You killed three
of our boys, smartass.

117
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:01,005
You're not gonna sound so smart

118
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,444
when you're bleeding like a stuck pig.

119
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,715
Right.

120
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,119
You and your Colombian friends
haven't really

121
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:16,721
thought this through.

122
00:07:16,755 --> 00:07:19,123
Now, as a businessman...

123
00:07:19,157 --> 00:07:20,591
I've found you have
to weigh short-term gains

124
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,026
against long-term
consequences.

125
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:25,563
True, you and your
men could retaliate.

126
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:27,065
In the short-term,
I'd be dead.

127
00:07:27,099 --> 00:07:29,400
But I'm not the only member
of the Koshkas.

128
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:31,202
I could have 100 men
here within the hour

129
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:35,140
should anything happen
to me, understand?

130
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:37,476
Yeah.

131
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:39,579
We outnumber you.
We outgun you.

132
00:07:39,613 --> 00:07:41,080
Ah!

133
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:42,481
Quite frankly, we're smarter than you.

134
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:44,383
So I'm afraid,

135
00:07:44,418 --> 00:07:46,986
in the long-term,

136
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:48,621
your plan falls a little short.

137
00:07:48,656 --> 00:07:50,489
Aah!

138
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:55,895
Now, the art
of any deal is negotiation.

139
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:59,598
Have we come to terms?

140
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:03,636
Yeah.

141
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:20,586
Hi, you've reached George Novikov.

142
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:22,121
Leave me a message.

143
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:23,523
George, it's Isaak.

144
00:08:23,557 --> 00:08:24,958
I need you to pay me a visit.

145
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:26,794
It's urgent.

146
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:36,804
Hannah should be on her way back

147
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:38,639
from the flower mart right about now.

148
00:08:38,673 --> 00:08:42,276
I'll be able to catch
her before I go to work.

149
00:08:47,849 --> 00:08:49,216
I've watched her for days.

150
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:52,553
She never changes her schedule.

151
00:09:15,377 --> 00:09:17,745
Hannah.

152
00:09:17,779 --> 00:09:21,749
Great, you're a stalker.

153
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:23,217
What happened to Peter Cottontail?

154
00:09:23,252 --> 00:09:25,687
Poison.

155
00:09:25,721 --> 00:09:28,656
Rabbits kill my plants,
so...I kill them.

156
00:09:28,691 --> 00:09:31,325
You could just trap them
and let 'em go.

157
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,693
When you do that, they come back.

158
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:35,029
I do what I have to do.

159
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:38,566
Remind me to never show
up on your property uninvited.

160
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,801
Too late.

161
00:09:40,836 --> 00:09:44,138
So you've accused
me of murder, animal cruelty.

162
00:09:44,172 --> 00:09:48,409
- Anything else?
- Actually, I came to apologize.

163
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,413
It's a copy of the blood report

164
00:09:52,448 --> 00:09:55,416
from the bodies you helped us find.

165
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,720
Wayne Randall's victims.

166
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,522
Wayne's victims, huh?

167
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,157
The blood evidence was inconclusive.

168
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:05,359
I realized it when
I got back to my lab.

169
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:07,895
I shouldn't have accused you.
I'm really sorry.

170
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:11,999
Thanks.

171
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:16,470
It takes a real gentleman
to admit when he's wrong.

172
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:21,542
What?

173
00:10:21,576 --> 00:10:22,843
You have a little, uh...

174
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:28,383
dirt.

175
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:29,717
Occupational hazard.

176
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:33,855
I can get pretty dirty.

177
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:36,024
Right.

178
00:10:36,058 --> 00:10:39,128
Remember why you're here.
Dead husband.

179
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:42,031
Since I'm here, I could use
a plant for my apartment.

180
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:43,966
Really?

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,269
A plant?

182
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:52,240
Follow me.

183
00:10:57,146 --> 00:10:58,947
Any idea what you're looking for?

184
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:01,983
Just a plant.
Something...panty.

185
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:04,786
You're the expert.

186
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:07,589
Well, why don't you tell
me about your place?

187
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,424
So I can get a better idea.

188
00:11:09,459 --> 00:11:12,094
It's, uh, one bedroom,

189
00:11:12,128 --> 00:11:13,929
on the water, lots of sunlight.

190
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,731
You live alone?

191
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:17,633
Currently, yeah.
You?

192
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:19,736
Currently...yeah.

193
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,504
And before?

194
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,307
I was married for a little while.

195
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:28,244
Unfortunately, he passed away.

196
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,079
How about this one?

197
00:11:30,114 --> 00:11:31,347
If you take good care of it,
it'll last for years.

198
00:11:31,382 --> 00:11:32,849
Really?

199
00:11:32,883 --> 00:11:35,752
I always figured once
you took flowers home,

200
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:37,254
they'd already started to die.

201
00:11:37,288 --> 00:11:39,823
That's kind of a morbid outlook.

202
00:11:39,857 --> 00:11:41,991
Is it?
Yeah, I guess I'm kind of,

203
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:47,163
maybe, a morbid guy.

204
00:11:47,197 --> 00:11:49,432
So how'd he die, your husband?

205
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,968
Um, heart attack.

206
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:56,272
But, we really don't need
to talk about it.

207
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:57,974
We can, though, if you want to.

208
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,709
I mean, I understand.
My wife...

209
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:02,546
died too.

210
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,214
Oh, what happened?

211
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,283
Eh, she was murdered.

212
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:09,520
Oh, God, that's, uh...
that's awful.

213
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:12,123
Yeah.

214
00:12:12,157 --> 00:12:15,561
Different from
your situation, obviously.

215
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:17,864
Oh.

216
00:12:17,898 --> 00:12:20,700
All this doom and gloom.

217
00:12:20,735 --> 00:12:23,336
You mind if we change the subject?

218
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:25,672
I do, actually.
But if her husband's off-limits,

219
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:27,140
I'll have to take another tack.

220
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:29,709
So how long have you had this place?

221
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,577
About a year.

222
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,179
Worked for the previous owner
before that.

223
00:12:33,213 --> 00:12:34,480
Beverly Grey.

224
00:12:34,515 --> 00:12:35,882
Amazing woman.

225
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,483
I've kept the business exactly
the same

226
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:38,918
as when she ran it.

227
00:12:38,953 --> 00:12:40,720
Same clients, same schedule.

228
00:12:40,754 --> 00:12:41,988
I even kept her handyman on.

229
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,423
Where is she now?
Retired?

230
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:45,492
She passed away about a year ago.

231
00:12:45,526 --> 00:12:47,560
That's when I took over.

232
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:50,063
Huh.
Dead husband, dead mentor.

233
00:12:50,097 --> 00:12:51,331
It was actually a really

234
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:53,500
sad time, so I'd--

235
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:55,001
I'd rather not talk about it.

236
00:12:55,036 --> 00:12:57,671
Sorry, I wasn't going
for more doom and gloom.

237
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:59,806
Seems you have a knack.

238
00:13:03,979 --> 00:13:05,546
Well I should get going.
I gotta get to work.

239
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,384
But you still haven't picked a plant.

240
00:13:10,419 --> 00:13:12,119
That one.

241
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:17,559
Pink. Really?

242
00:13:17,593 --> 00:13:22,430
What do I owe you?

243
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:25,600
Consider it a gift.

244
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:27,301
Thanks.

245
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:28,703
See ya around.

246
00:13:28,737 --> 00:13:31,105
Since Hannah stabbed her first victim,

247
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,308
two people close to her have died.

248
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:34,643
Seems I'm not the only one

249
00:13:34,677 --> 00:13:37,279
with a knack for doom and gloom.

250
00:13:40,249 --> 00:13:41,583
Beverly Grey.

251
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:45,586
The deceased mentor of Hannah McKay.

252
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:47,455
I paid a visit to the clerk of county.

253
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:51,926
Beverly's will listed Hannah
as her lone beneficiary.

254
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:53,161
Makes sense.

255
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:55,397
No children, no immediate family.

256
00:13:55,431 --> 00:14:00,235
Why wouldn't Beverly
leave Hannah her legacy?

257
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:02,104
But if Hannah were Beverly's
heir apparent,

258
00:14:02,138 --> 00:14:07,643
it would give her motive for murder.

259
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:11,580
The question is, is Hannah
responsible for her death?

260
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:14,483
Cause of death, heart attack.

261
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:17,153
Just like her husband.
Seems suspicious.

262
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:18,921
Or not.

263
00:14:18,956 --> 00:14:20,690
Heart disease is the leading
cause of death in this country.

264
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,260
Hell, it got me.

265
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:25,928
What about poison?

266
00:14:25,963 --> 00:14:28,598
That's the way women usually kill.

267
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:31,134
Safe. Detached.

268
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:33,503
She poisons rabbits, Dexter.

269
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,805
It doesn't mean she poisons people.

270
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,809
Why are you so convinced
she's still a killer?

271
00:14:44,348 --> 00:14:48,452
I know that face.

272
00:14:48,486 --> 00:14:50,554
Sal Price.

273
00:14:50,588 --> 00:14:52,055
Maybe he can tell
me something about Hannah

274
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,557
I don't already know.

275
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:03,367
Hey, was that Sal Pice?

276
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:04,635
Yeah.
What do you care?

277
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:05,869
I read his book.
I'm a fan.

278
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:07,738
Since when do you read true crime?

279
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:09,406
Since we started working
on the Wayne Randall case.

280
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,641
Guess I'm learning all kinds
of new things about you.

281
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:13,977
What was Price doing here?

282
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,346
He heard we dug
up more Wayne Randall victims.

283
00:15:16,381 --> 00:15:18,048
He wants to update
and reissue his book.

284
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:19,482
He asked if he could see
the case files.

285
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:21,685
- I said I'd have copies made.
- Shit.

286
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:23,419
The case is closed.
What's the big deal?

287
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:26,589
I fudged the blood report,
for starters.

288
00:15:26,623 --> 00:15:28,490
No, it's just--
Was he leaving?

289
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,758
I want to ask him to sign my book.

290
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:31,160
He went down to the coffee truck

291
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:32,594
while I'm having the copies made.

292
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm sure he'd love to.

293
00:15:40,304 --> 00:15:42,171
- Coffee.
- Mr. Price?

294
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,673
Hi. Dexter Morgan.

295
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:46,276
I'm a big fan.

296
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,778
I was hoping maybe
I could get an autograph?

297
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:50,113
Yeah, sure.

298
00:15:50,147 --> 00:15:51,881
Of course.

299
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,783
Morgan.

300
00:15:53,817 --> 00:15:56,385
Any relation to the Lieutenant?

301
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,287
Yeah, she's my sister.
She says you're writing

302
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:01,390
an update on the new bodies.
That's exciting.

303
00:16:01,424 --> 00:16:03,559
Is she single?

304
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:06,228
Yeah, last time I checked.

305
00:16:06,263 --> 00:16:07,763
Look, I should warn you.

306
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:09,865
Since we're talking
about a solved crime,

307
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,867
I didn't really put that much
time into my blood report.

308
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:14,536
That's okay, I usually have
my own guy take a look.

309
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,870
Just in case.

310
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:18,573
What are you hoping to find?

311
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:19,975
Let's just say, I have a little theory

312
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,878
that Hannah McKay deserves
her own sequel.

313
00:16:22,912 --> 00:16:25,147
So does your sister date, or--

314
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:27,482
You're writing
a book about Hannah McKay?

315
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:30,085
What are the highlights?

316
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:32,388
Come on, give me something.
Just a teaser,

317
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:36,057
for a fan.

318
00:16:36,092 --> 00:16:38,894
Only if you put in a good word
for me with your sister.

319
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:40,962
Sure.

320
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:43,298
So, Hannah McKay?

321
00:16:43,332 --> 00:16:45,934
Right, so, get this.

322
00:16:45,968 --> 00:16:48,470
Right out of juvie, Hannah moves
into a halfway house.

323
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:50,171
Seems like all's going well,

324
00:16:50,206 --> 00:16:54,109
until she accuses some counselor
of abusing her, sexually.

325
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:55,677
So what happened?

326
00:16:55,711 --> 00:16:57,179
Nothing.
Guy gets a slap on the wrist.

327
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:58,513
But, a couple of weeks later,

328
00:16:58,548 --> 00:17:00,282
he drops dead.

329
00:17:00,316 --> 00:17:01,650
Rat poisoning.

330
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:04,853
Sound like a coincidence to you?

331
00:17:04,887 --> 00:17:06,521
Wow, I don't know.

332
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:08,623
Three makes a pattern.
Maybe they all got in her way.

333
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,692
Well, that's all
you're getting out of me.

334
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:12,260
You want the rest, read the book.

335
00:17:14,363 --> 00:17:15,830
I'm gonna go check on those files.

336
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:20,869
Pleasure to meet you, Dexter Morgan.

337
00:17:20,903 --> 00:17:23,304
I will read your book,
Mr. Price.

338
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:26,675
But I won't be waiting for
it to come out in hard copy.

339
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,943
You are now officially
my favorite lieutenant.

340
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:31,346
Can I buy you an adult beverage
as a token of my appreciation?

341
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,515
Some place dark and not too loud?

342
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:36,051
- That sounds like a date.
- Not to me.

343
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,219
It sounds like a beautiful
police lieutenant

344
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:41,189
sharing an evening
with a handsome crime writer.

345
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:43,492
Can I take a rain check?

346
00:17:43,526 --> 00:17:45,494
- Sorry.
- Don't be. I get it.

347
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:47,229
Me coming in here, asking you out.

348
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:50,032
You probably think I'm trying
to write your story.

349
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,900
- Which, I'm not, by the way.
- My story?

350
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:53,702
You know, being engaged
to the Ice Truck Killer.

351
00:17:53,737 --> 00:17:55,203
- I'm sure you got the bejesus--
- Shit, that hadn't even

352
00:17:55,238 --> 00:17:56,972
occurred to me.
Is that what you're doing?

353
00:17:57,006 --> 00:17:58,207
- I just said I wasn't.
- Well how do I know that's not

354
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,475
some fucked up tactic?

355
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:03,645
Are you always this defensive?

356
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,880
Sorry, I didn't--

357
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:06,749
I didn't mean to be defensive.

358
00:18:06,783 --> 00:18:09,184
I'm just not really in a dating mode.

359
00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:11,654
Dating mode. Wow.
That's a thing.

360
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:14,924
My life is really fucking complicated.

361
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:17,059
Fine, but, for the record...

362
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:18,895
I like complicated.

363
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:22,832
So if you happen
to change your mind...

364
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:27,970
give me a call.

365
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:40,850
Oh, sorry, had garlic for lunch.

366
00:18:40,884 --> 00:18:45,454
You have gum in here, yes?

367
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:46,788
What is that?

368
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,523
George left it in my car

369
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,458
the last time I was at the club.

370
00:18:50,493 --> 00:18:52,260
Figured you knew about it.

371
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:56,764
Why would he do that?

372
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,299
He used to give me cash
to look the other way

373
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,434
back when I worked Narcotics.

374
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,973
I thought you were joking when
you said you were a dirty cop.

375
00:19:06,008 --> 00:19:07,308
I was joking.

376
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:09,744
I'm a good cop.

377
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:10,978
I also like money.

378
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:12,646
Joey.

379
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:15,382
I know.

380
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:16,650
When I took it, I figured George

381
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:18,085
was gonna ask me for something small,

382
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:20,254
but now that Isaak's been arrested

383
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:21,789
I'm not sure I want to do

384
00:19:21,823 --> 00:19:24,392
whatever it is they're gonna
ask me to do.

385
00:19:24,427 --> 00:19:26,128
You're sure you didn't
know about this?

386
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:30,999
If I did, I would have told
you to give it back.

387
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:32,468
You're giving this back, right?

388
00:19:32,502 --> 00:19:33,902
I'm thinking about it.

389
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:35,804
Joey, these are dangerous people

390
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,073
you know, there's like
10 grand in that bag.

391
00:19:38,107 --> 00:19:41,643
What good is money if you're dead?

392
00:19:54,725 --> 00:19:58,262
I'm not for sale.

393
00:19:58,296 --> 00:20:00,831
Take care of yourself.

394
00:20:10,575 --> 00:20:14,044
Price is going through my
evidence at the police station.

395
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:19,116
Turn around is fair play.

396
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,991
Hopefully his thoughts about Hannah

397
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:33,030
are a little more organized.

398
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:41,839
Looks like Price and I

399
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,841
share an obsession.

400
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:48,412
But he's had years
to follow Hannah's every move.

401
00:20:48,446 --> 00:20:52,316
I need to catch up.

402
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,995
Price's source material.

403
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,098
I'll have to come back
to see what he has on me.

404
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:11,769
Right now,
I have to get in and get out.

405
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,041
A blood test for Hannah's mentor
Beverly Grey.

406
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,414
Whatever it means,
I'll bet Price wrote about it.

407
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:43,735
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm fine, come on.

408
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:44,969
So have you heard from Louis?

409
00:21:45,004 --> 00:21:47,205
No. Thank God.

410
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,977
I mean, hookers?
Gross.

411
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,880
Who does that?

412
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:58,148
Yeah.

413
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,883
Gross.

414
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:04,221
So what do you think of this place?

415
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,822
I guess it's cute.

416
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:07,424
Kind of a dive.

417
00:22:07,458 --> 00:22:10,393
Because the owner's thinking
about selling...

418
00:22:10,428 --> 00:22:12,396
and I'm thinking about buying.

419
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,631
Angel, how are you gonna find
the time to run a restaurant

420
00:22:14,665 --> 00:22:16,166
with all the hours you put
in at the station?

421
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,335
I could just retire.

422
00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:20,170
I've put in my 20 years.

423
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:22,172
So you're just gonna quit?

424
00:22:22,206 --> 00:22:23,974
- Retire.
- Do something else?

425
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,676
- Yeah.
- Look, Angel...

426
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:30,480
you're my brother, and I love you.

427
00:22:30,514 --> 00:22:34,017
But this is a big decision.

428
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:35,284
And we both know you're impulsive.

429
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:36,586
You get these crazy ideas,

430
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,820
like you want
to buy a racetrack--

431
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,188
I don't get these crazy--

432
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:40,522
You do, and then
you end up divorced...

433
00:22:40,557 --> 00:22:42,791
- Shh.
- With a broken down Trans Am,

434
00:22:42,826 --> 00:22:48,631
and barely enough money
to pay the rent.

435
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:58,943
I see you brought Jurg.

436
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:01,613
So good to see you both getting
on in my absence.

437
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,714
What, are you kidding?
Since you've been arrested,

438
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:06,517
I can't take a shit without
lurch breathing down my neck.

439
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:12,524
Well someone has to keep
an eye on you while I'm in here.

440
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,359
So what's the big emergency?

441
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:16,228
You need to get me out of here,

442
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,830
as soon as humanly possible.

443
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,465
What happened?

444
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,699
Nothing.

445
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,834
Yet.

446
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:27,239
But I'd really like
to avoid killing anyone in here.

447
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:32,144
It would get in the way
of my being released.

448
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:36,382
Have you heard from Detective Quinn?

449
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:41,154
He, um...
He gave back the money.

450
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:42,822
Which is weird, because

451
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:46,392
he's never turned down a payoff before.

452
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:52,098
George...

453
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:55,368
do not disappoint me.

454
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,592
Hi.

455
00:24:17,626 --> 00:24:19,761
Quinn.
Reservation for two.

456
00:24:19,795 --> 00:24:21,295
Your other party has already arrived.

457
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,464
Right this way, Mr. Quinn.

458
00:24:33,276 --> 00:24:38,413
Enjoy your dinner.

459
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:40,081
What the fuck is this?

460
00:24:40,116 --> 00:24:43,651
Where's Nadia?

461
00:24:43,686 --> 00:24:46,387
If you hurt her, I will put a bullet

462
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:48,256
through your motherfucking head.

463
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,093
Easy, detective.
Don't make a scene.

464
00:24:52,127 --> 00:24:54,762
Nadia is a valuable commodity.

465
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:59,834
We wouldn't do that.
Not unless we had to.

466
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,744
What do you want from me?

467
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,413
I don't want shit.

468
00:25:11,447 --> 00:25:12,981
But Isaak Sirko,

469
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:14,349
he wants you
to lose the blood evidence

470
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:15,750
linking him to the Colombian murders.

471
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:18,019
Why the fuck would I do that for you?

472
00:25:18,054 --> 00:25:19,421
Well, you took our money for starters.

473
00:25:19,455 --> 00:25:20,822
And I gave it back.

474
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:22,090
I don't owe you shit.

475
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:24,359
Not the way Isaak sees it.

476
00:25:24,393 --> 00:25:26,028
Now, he did you a favor by taking out

477
00:25:26,062 --> 00:25:27,863
those Colombian scumbags.

478
00:25:27,897 --> 00:25:29,131
As soon as you let him go,

479
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:30,432
he'll head back to the Ukraine.

480
00:25:30,467 --> 00:25:32,334
You'll never hear from him again.

481
00:25:32,368 --> 00:25:33,569
It's not that big a deal.

482
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:35,103
Then find someone else.

483
00:25:35,138 --> 00:25:38,840
Now why would we do that
when we have you?

484
00:25:40,977 --> 00:25:42,344
Joey, come on.

485
00:25:42,378 --> 00:25:45,380
You know we got you.

486
00:25:47,783 --> 00:25:51,686
What happens if I don't cooperate?

487
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,254
I'm thinking of transferring Nadia

488
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:56,357
to one of our sex clubs in Dubai.

489
00:25:56,391 --> 00:25:58,526
But she's a strong girl.

490
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,331
She'll last a couple weeks
before she slits her wrists.

491
00:26:04,365 --> 00:26:07,635
If I do this...

492
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,470
Nadia's a free woman.

493
00:26:10,505 --> 00:26:13,140
You give me her fucking
passport, understand?

494
00:26:13,174 --> 00:26:15,809
Deal.

495
00:26:15,844 --> 00:26:17,044
And I'll do you one better.

496
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:21,048
You can even keep the cash.

497
00:26:24,353 --> 00:26:25,820
See, Joe?

498
00:26:25,854 --> 00:26:30,325
Just like old times.

499
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:47,710
- It's Nadia.
- Leave a message.

500
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:52,948
Nadia, it's Joey.
Call me as soon as you get this.

501
00:26:57,454 --> 00:27:02,726
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

502
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,160
How was the meeting
with the D.A.?

503
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:05,661
Uh, fine.

504
00:27:05,696 --> 00:27:07,163
He's confident that
we have enough evidence

505
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:08,698
to put Sirko away for a long time.

506
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,935
Thank the sweet fucking baby Jesus.

507
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:17,440
But that's not what
I wanted to talk to you about.

508
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:20,610
I had my last
two interviews yesterday.

509
00:27:20,644 --> 00:27:22,278
You know, with the families
of the missing persons

510
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:23,546
who I thought could have been victims

511
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,681
of the Bay Harbor Butcher?

512
00:27:25,715 --> 00:27:27,049
And? Any leads?

513
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,717
Not a one.

514
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:31,953
It's frustrating.

515
00:27:31,987 --> 00:27:34,288
So I started looking into open cases.

516
00:27:34,323 --> 00:27:39,527
I figure, a lot of homicide
suspects vanish into thin air.

517
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:43,531
What if the Butcher
took some of them out?

518
00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:45,900
That's good thinking.

519
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,134
Did you find anything?

520
00:27:47,168 --> 00:27:49,869
Maybe.

521
00:27:49,904 --> 00:27:52,706
- Remember the barrel girls?
- A swamp full

522
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,408
of blondes in barrels, all of them...

523
00:27:55,443 --> 00:27:57,377
raped, electrocuted, and embalmed?

524
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,478
Yeah, how could I forget it?

525
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:02,281
All five suspects,
including self-help guru

526
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,817
Jordan Chase, went missing

527
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,719
before we could build
a case against them.

528
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:10,389
You're thinking the Butcher
could have killed them.

529
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,258
There were two vigilante killers.

530
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:14,793
Maybe he took on an accomplice.

531
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:18,097
One of the victims
who was looking for justice?

532
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,065
I'm--

533
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:24,303
I know it's a reach.

534
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:28,007
But it's possible.

535
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:31,243
Wasn't the theory that Jordan
Chase killed the accomplices,

536
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,579
- then fled the country?
- Yes, but even

537
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:37,115
if Chase killed
the other four suspects,

538
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,020
the Butcher still could
have killed Chase.

539
00:28:47,795 --> 00:28:49,262
I don't think so.

540
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,266
Jordan Chase was very high profile.

541
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,703
It would be too risky.

542
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,872
Still...

543
00:28:59,907 --> 00:29:02,908
it's worth looking into.

544
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,193
Find what you're looking for?

545
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:22,661
It says here Price

546
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:25,397
bribed the funeral director
to get access

547
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,899
to Beverly Grey's body before
she was cremated.

548
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,901
He stole a blood sample,

549
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:33,238
and ran it for aconite.

550
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,739
Aconite?

551
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:39,143
The queen of all poisons.

552
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:41,312
Ingesting it causes a heart attack.

553
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,648
Price says it's been growing on

554
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,816
the greenhouse property for years.

555
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:47,084
Poison.

556
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,986
You were right.

557
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,221
It didn't show up on the autopsy?

558
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:51,890
It wouldn't have.

559
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,759
Not if they didn't know
what they were looking for.

560
00:29:53,793 --> 00:29:58,497
Her blood test.

561
00:29:58,532 --> 00:30:00,266
Positive for aconite.

562
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,168
Proof that Beverly was poisoned.

563
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:05,371
But not proof that Hannah
did the poisoning.

564
00:30:05,406 --> 00:30:07,607
Hannah said her handyman was there

565
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:09,042
when Beverly was still alive.

566
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:11,211
That could be worth a conversation.

567
00:30:15,316 --> 00:30:20,119
Jesus, now she's showing
up where I live.

568
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:34,400
What are you doing here?

569
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:36,735
You picked the wrong plant.

570
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,970
I knew I could do better.

571
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,238
Hopefully you won't kill it.

572
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,473
What is it?

573
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:43,476
It's a spotted phalaenopsis.

574
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,978
See the red on the petals?
Remind you of anything?

575
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,379
Blood spatter.

576
00:30:47,414 --> 00:30:49,482
Which reminded me of you.

577
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:53,486
You came all the way out here
just to bring me that?

578
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,389
- How'd you find me?
- Google.

579
00:30:56,423 --> 00:30:58,057
Now who's a stalker?

580
00:31:02,363 --> 00:31:04,431
I should ask her to leave.

581
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:05,999
So you want to come in?

582
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:07,768
Yeah, sure.

583
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:10,904
I'll help you find a place for it.

584
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:13,340
I need a spot near a window,

585
00:31:13,374 --> 00:31:18,145
but not directly in front of it.

586
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:23,016
Uh, no, that's the bedroom.

587
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:25,686
No plants in here.
Not enough light.

588
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,090
You could open the shades.

589
00:31:29,124 --> 00:31:31,025
I like the dark.

590
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,461
So do I.

591
00:31:32,495 --> 00:31:33,829
Why is she here?

592
00:31:33,863 --> 00:31:39,468
What does she want?

593
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,474
There.

594
00:31:45,508 --> 00:31:47,710
Now you can look
at it when you wake up.

595
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:51,280
And when you go to bed.

596
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:57,286
Sorr--I gotta take this.

597
00:31:57,321 --> 00:32:00,523
Hey, Deb. What's up?

598
00:32:00,557 --> 00:32:01,958
Uh, nothing, just that

599
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:03,459
Laguerta might have another theory

600
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:04,827
that could royally fuck us.

601
00:32:04,862 --> 00:32:06,463
Can you meet me at my house?

602
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:07,797
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

603
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:10,534
Dex, this can't wait.

604
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:12,669
All right, I'll meet you in 20.

605
00:32:20,846 --> 00:32:22,346
I'm telling you, Dexter,

606
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,981
Laguerta's not just
gonna forget this one.

607
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:26,517
Jordan Chase is long gone.
So are the others.

608
00:32:26,551 --> 00:32:30,087
There's nothing
to trace them back to me.

609
00:32:30,122 --> 00:32:33,925
Are you sure about that?

610
00:32:33,959 --> 00:32:36,761
There are no loose ends?

611
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:39,831
What about the person
you were working with?

612
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:41,332
I don't know what
you're talking about.

613
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,101
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

614
00:32:43,135 --> 00:32:47,272
There were two vigilante
killers, not one.

615
00:32:47,306 --> 00:32:51,676
Who was helping you?

616
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,745
She wasn't helping me.
I was helping her.

617
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:55,913
Was she one of their victims?

618
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:58,784
It doesn't matter.

619
00:32:58,818 --> 00:33:00,052
If Laguerta tracks her down,

620
00:33:00,086 --> 00:33:01,553
which is next to impossible,

621
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:03,789
she won't incriminate herself, or me.

622
00:33:03,823 --> 00:33:07,393
- How do you know that?
- Trust me, I just do.

623
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:12,832
Motherfucker.

624
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:19,571
You were together.

625
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:24,243
Like a couple.

626
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:26,446
I remember having a thought that...

627
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,485
whoever was doing this
was doing it for love.

628
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,089
That was right after Rita died.

629
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:39,394
You had that tenant with
that weird fucking name.

630
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:43,565
Lumen.

631
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,667
- It was her, wasn't it?
- It doesn't matter.

632
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:47,469
It was.

633
00:33:47,504 --> 00:33:49,838
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.

634
00:33:49,873 --> 00:33:53,609
You moved your girlfriend
into the house

635
00:33:53,643 --> 00:33:58,114
where Trinity murdered your wife...

636
00:33:58,148 --> 00:33:59,482
so you could kill together?

637
00:33:59,516 --> 00:34:01,483
It wasn't like that.

638
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:05,087
I felt guilty about
what happened to Rita.

639
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:07,255
- You fel--
- I thought that maybe

640
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:13,261
if I helped Lumen...

641
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:15,030
I was trying to make things right.

642
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:16,298
Of course.

643
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:19,602
By murdering five other people.

644
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:26,275
Why can't the past
just stay in the past?

645
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,144
Do we have to keep talking about this?

646
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:31,514
Yeah, we do, as long as
Laguerta has a bug up her ass.

647
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:34,517
Let me worry about Laguerta, please!

648
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,152
You just--

649
00:34:36,186 --> 00:34:40,889
worry about yourself.

650
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:42,157
Go out.

651
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:44,360
Have fun.

652
00:34:44,394 --> 00:34:46,663
Go on a date.

653
00:34:46,697 --> 00:34:50,399
That guy, Sal Price.
He was into you.

654
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:52,401
Get out of my house.

655
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:56,271
What did I say?

656
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:08,417
I really need to kill someone.

657
00:35:14,223 --> 00:35:16,191
Hannah's become
a real thorn in my side.

658
00:35:18,928 --> 00:35:21,096
Maybe her handyman can give
me what I need

659
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,099
to finally fix my problem.

660
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,235
Excuse me.

661
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:27,936
Is Hannah here?

662
00:35:27,971 --> 00:35:29,371
She's at the flower market.

663
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:31,873
Oh, man.
I drove all the way out here.

664
00:35:31,908 --> 00:35:33,108
Do you know when she'll be back?

665
00:35:33,142 --> 00:35:36,878
An hour or so.
It might be sooner.

666
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:38,380
You could wait.

667
00:35:50,893 --> 00:35:55,464
How long have you been working here?

668
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:56,766
About ten years.

669
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,935
So you knew the previous owner.

670
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:01,371
Beverly Grey?

671
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:02,606
Hannah said she passed away.

672
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,041
Heart disease.
Sad story.

673
00:36:05,076 --> 00:36:06,609
Yeah, Hannah said they were close.

674
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:09,979
It must have been hard on her.

675
00:36:10,014 --> 00:36:11,714
I'm sure it was, but...

676
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:13,149
she never let it show.

677
00:36:13,183 --> 00:36:14,617
Not the emotional type, huh?

678
00:36:14,651 --> 00:36:16,218
I never saw anything like it.

679
00:36:16,252 --> 00:36:19,254
Even when Beverly got sick,
Hannah never complained.

680
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:22,290
Never asked for help.

681
00:36:22,325 --> 00:36:23,725
Help with what?

682
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:25,927
Taking care of Beverly.

683
00:36:25,961 --> 00:36:27,562
Hannah bathed her, fed her,

684
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:29,130
took her to the doctor's.

685
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:30,832
All alone?

686
00:36:30,866 --> 00:36:32,167
She was stubborn, man.

687
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:33,802
I figured it had

688
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:35,403
something to do with growing
up on a farm, you know?

689
00:36:35,438 --> 00:36:37,906
Just...plowing through.

690
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,741
Look, I tried to help out.

691
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:41,142
Hannah dug her heels in.

692
00:36:41,177 --> 00:36:42,409
Wouldn't let anybody near Beverly.

693
00:36:42,444 --> 00:36:44,011
Which means Hannah was the only one

694
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:47,014
who had the access to poison her.

695
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:54,589
Hey, Hannah mentioned
a purple wildflower

696
00:36:54,623 --> 00:36:56,191
that grows on the property.

697
00:36:56,225 --> 00:36:57,825
Thought it would
look great in my place.

698
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:01,362
I'm thinking I could
take a look while I wait.

699
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:05,466
All the wildflowers are over
in the southwest corner.

700
00:37:23,686 --> 00:37:26,020
Aconite.

701
00:37:26,054 --> 00:37:28,856
Price is right.
Yet again.

702
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,190
Beautiful and dangerous.

703
00:37:30,225 --> 00:37:35,863
Just like Hannah.

704
00:37:37,198 --> 00:37:39,333
She's harvested it.

705
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:42,136
Maybe she's set her sights
on a new target.

706
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:43,838
You're after her.

707
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:46,907
Who's to say she isn't after you?

708
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:50,344
But why?

709
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:51,579
She doesn't think I'm a threat.

710
00:37:51,613 --> 00:37:52,846
She accepted my apology.

711
00:37:52,881 --> 00:37:54,314
Don't be naive, Dexter.

712
00:37:54,349 --> 00:37:57,318
You think she's a killer,
but not a liar?

713
00:37:57,352 --> 00:38:00,421
Dexter?

714
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:02,090
What are you doing here?

715
00:38:02,124 --> 00:38:03,925
I was, uh...

716
00:38:03,959 --> 00:38:06,595
in the neighborhood.

717
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:07,930
Well, come on in.

718
00:38:07,964 --> 00:38:11,233
I'll make some coffee.

719
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:24,879
Careful, it's hot.

720
00:38:27,149 --> 00:38:30,784
And potentially deadly.

721
00:38:32,421 --> 00:38:36,124
Hannah, I wish I had more time,
but I gotta get to work.

722
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:37,625
You know,
I don't understand you, Dexter.

723
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,861
I can't figure out what it is

724
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:41,363
that you really want.

725
00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:42,597
Nothing.
I don't want anything.

726
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:44,266
You obviously want something.

727
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,101
You keep making excuses to see me.

728
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:47,435
They weren't excuses.

729
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,704
It's honestly getting a little creepy

730
00:38:48,738 --> 00:38:50,038
that you keep coming by.

731
00:38:50,073 --> 00:38:51,873
Creepy?
You came to my place too.

732
00:38:51,908 --> 00:38:53,642
Well then why don't you just
save us both the trouble,

733
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:54,910
and spit it out.

734
00:38:54,944 --> 00:38:56,911
I want to take you out.

735
00:38:56,946 --> 00:38:59,280
On a date?

736
00:38:59,315 --> 00:39:00,548
That'll work.

737
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:04,151
Well, that's sweet.

738
00:39:04,186 --> 00:39:08,756
But I don't date.

739
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,224
I get too attached.

740
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:12,326
Really? You don't strike
me as the type.

741
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:14,229
Well, I'm not who people think I am.

742
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:16,965
So who are you?

743
00:39:16,999 --> 00:39:20,168
On the inside?

744
00:39:20,203 --> 00:39:22,171
Probably still that
15-year-old girl

745
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:23,905
who ran away with Wayne Randall.

746
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,641
The girl who stabbed
a woman in cold blood.

747
00:39:26,675 --> 00:39:29,944
Except now, I know better.

748
00:39:29,979 --> 00:39:31,279
What do you mean?

749
00:39:31,314 --> 00:39:35,083
I mean, he promised me everything.

750
00:39:35,117 --> 00:39:36,317
He was gonna take me to Disney World,

751
00:39:36,352 --> 00:39:40,255
and Santa's Holiday Adventure.

752
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,759
Some little Christmas-themed
shithole just outside of Miami.

753
00:39:43,794 --> 00:39:44,994
You know it?

754
00:39:45,028 --> 00:39:50,332
Mmmm.

755
00:39:50,366 --> 00:39:53,869
It's the only place in Florida
where you can see the snow.

756
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:57,105
I was obsessed.

757
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:59,607
Then we were gonna live
in Argentina, on a farm,

758
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:01,542
and have this
picture-perfect life.

759
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:03,444
Sounds pretty good to me.

760
00:40:03,478 --> 00:40:07,114
It was all I could think about.

761
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:08,816
I longed for it.

762
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:11,786
I needed it, and I knew
that until I had it,

763
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:14,455
I would never be satisfied.

764
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,790
The craziest part is

765
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:17,559
that somehow I had myself convinced

766
00:40:17,593 --> 00:40:20,129
that Wayne was the only one
who could give it to me.

767
00:40:20,163 --> 00:40:22,397
Wayne? Really?

768
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,900
Why?

769
00:40:24,935 --> 00:40:29,572
I had it in my head
that he was the answer.

770
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:34,643
That he was gonna fill the
emptiness that I felt inside.

771
00:40:34,677 --> 00:40:38,513
So I didn't care when
he turned out to be the bad guy.

772
00:40:38,548 --> 00:40:41,750
I didn't care if he shot somebody.

773
00:40:41,785 --> 00:40:45,554
I didn't even care
if I ended up in juvie.

774
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:49,525
Not until later, anyway.

775
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:52,828
It was worth it...

776
00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:57,032
just to hold on to the fantasy.

777
00:40:57,067 --> 00:41:02,671
You still feel that way?

778
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:05,007
No. Now I do whatever it takes
to make sure I don't

779
00:41:05,041 --> 00:41:09,711
lose myself like that again.

780
00:41:09,745 --> 00:41:12,413
But I do still wish
I had gotten to see the snow.

781
00:41:18,487 --> 00:41:20,455
You know I'm not Wayne, right?

782
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:30,866
I'm not gonna land you in jail.

783
00:41:30,901 --> 00:41:32,869
I still think it's a bad idea.

784
00:41:32,903 --> 00:41:34,470
Then why'd you come to my apartment?

785
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:36,072
You know why.

786
00:41:36,106 --> 00:41:39,976
Go out with me.

787
00:41:40,011 --> 00:41:44,147
Come on, I'm just gonna
keep stalking you.

788
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,718
I'm just--I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

789
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:53,657
Do the wrong thing.

790
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:55,559
Fine.

791
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:58,162
One date.

792
00:41:58,196 --> 00:41:59,563
But if I end up in jail--

793
00:41:59,597 --> 00:42:04,501
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

794
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:12,742
A date?

795
00:42:12,777 --> 00:42:14,444
Really?

796
00:42:14,478 --> 00:42:17,047
She caught me off-guard.
I had to think of something.

797
00:42:24,222 --> 00:42:26,157
Nadia, it's Joey.

798
00:42:26,191 --> 00:42:28,025
I stopped by the club last night
and you weren't there.

799
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,360
I know I've called, like, 50 times.

800
00:42:29,394 --> 00:42:30,928
I'm just worried about you.

801
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:33,998
Please, call me back.
Let me know you're okay.

802
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:37,468
- You got a sec?
- Not really, I--

803
00:42:37,502 --> 00:42:39,770
Do I seem impulsive to you?

804
00:42:39,805 --> 00:42:42,140
Jamie says I make bad decisions.

805
00:42:42,174 --> 00:42:45,944
But I have this opportunity,
and I'm thinking about retiring.

806
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:48,046
Holy shit.
You're retiring?

807
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,382
No, I-I didn't say that.
I'm just considering my options.

808
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:54,619
Can we talk later?
I got shit to do.

809
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:56,488
Hey, L.T., did you know
Angel's thinking about retiring?

810
00:42:56,522 --> 00:42:59,725
- Masuka!
- Is that true?

811
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,962
I want to buy a restaurant.

812
00:43:02,996 --> 00:43:04,564
- Will you give us a minute?
- Yeah, fine.

813
00:43:04,598 --> 00:43:06,533
But for the record,
studies show that men who retire

814
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:08,468
are usually dead in five years.

815
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,604
It's a fact.
Look it up.

816
00:43:17,277 --> 00:43:22,247
Where is this coming from?

817
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:25,084
Is this about Mike Anderson's
murder, 'cause...

818
00:43:25,118 --> 00:43:26,519
we've been through this.

819
00:43:26,553 --> 00:43:29,755
I think I'm burnt out, Deb.

820
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,424
I don't date.

821
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:35,261
I hardly see my kid.

822
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,829
I'm so focused on work that

823
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:39,365
I forgot to have a life.

824
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,033
And I know this may sound crazy,

825
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:44,504
but the idea of buying this restaurant

826
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:48,174
actually makes me happy.

827
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:54,280
Doesn't sound crazy at all.

828
00:44:29,752 --> 00:44:31,152
Sal Price.

829
00:44:31,187 --> 00:44:33,755
Sal, hey.
It's Debra Morgan, from--

830
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,392
Lieutenant Morgan,
with the potty mouth.

831
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:38,027
Right, with the potty mouth.

832
00:44:38,061 --> 00:44:39,762
To what do I owe
this unexpected pleasure?

833
00:44:39,796 --> 00:44:41,296
Are you still up for that drink?

834
00:44:41,331 --> 00:44:43,499
Yeah, absolutely.

835
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:46,335
- But, I thought you said--
- I think I need to get a life.

836
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:48,103
Yes, you do.

837
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,345
- Case number?
- 98760.

838
00:45:00,283 --> 00:45:04,018
That's, uh, Dixon case.

839
00:45:04,053 --> 00:45:06,021
I-I gotta testify
in court next week.

840
00:45:06,055 --> 00:45:09,024
Need a refresher on the evidence.

841
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:11,193
Dry section.
Bin 51, shelf 4.

842
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:15,931
Third one over.
Back, and to the right.

843
00:45:18,568 --> 00:45:21,470
- Case number?
- Case 16258.

844
00:45:21,504 --> 00:45:23,138
Layva.

845
00:45:23,173 --> 00:45:24,707
Should be two or three boxes.

846
00:45:24,741 --> 00:45:28,410
It goes to arraignment next month.

847
00:46:14,923 --> 00:46:18,526
Fuck me.

848
00:46:20,796 --> 00:46:24,766
Oral fixation?

849
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,068
Sorry. Bad habit.

850
00:46:27,102 --> 00:46:28,770
When I quit drinking,
I picked up smoking.

851
00:46:28,804 --> 00:46:31,439
When I quit smoking,
I picked up chewing on things.

852
00:46:31,473 --> 00:46:33,775
Straws, pens, toothpicks.

853
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:36,177
Turns out I have
a problem with moderation.

854
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:37,545
Me too.

855
00:46:37,579 --> 00:46:39,346
That, and an obsessive personality.

856
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:41,715
Which is great for work, but it's...

857
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,550
really shitty for relationships.

858
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:48,021
Are we talking about me or you?

859
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:49,290
So what are you working on right now?

860
00:46:49,324 --> 00:46:52,059
You're updating your book, right?

861
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:53,794
That, and another project.

862
00:46:53,828 --> 00:46:56,596
Which I probably shouldn't tell
you about.

863
00:46:56,631 --> 00:46:58,698
Why, is it a secret?

864
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:00,133
'Cause trust me, I can keep a secret.

865
00:47:00,168 --> 00:47:02,436
I don't know.

866
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,904
You're the Lieutenant of Homicide,

867
00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:05,973
and usually when
I tell cops about my theories,

868
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:08,375
they tell me to go fuck myself.

869
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:12,880
That won't happen here.
I promise.

870
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:15,749
Come on,
don't be a cop-tease.

871
00:47:15,784 --> 00:47:20,654
A good theory totally
gives me a girl boner.

872
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:23,157
Okay.

873
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:24,559
- Off the record.
- Mm-hmm.

874
00:47:24,593 --> 00:47:27,061
You know all that stuff
in my first book

875
00:47:27,096 --> 00:47:29,664
about Hannah McKay being
this innocent young girl?

876
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:31,833
A victim of Wayne Randall's influence?

877
00:47:31,868 --> 00:47:33,101
Yeah.

878
00:47:33,136 --> 00:47:37,139
Well, I think it's bogus.

879
00:47:37,173 --> 00:47:40,609
I think Hannah killed her first
victim right along with Wayne.

880
00:47:40,643 --> 00:47:42,411
And I think she kept right on killing.

881
00:47:42,445 --> 00:47:44,780
Go fuck yourself.

882
00:47:44,815 --> 00:47:46,916
If that's true, we're totally fucked.

883
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:49,018
- We gave her immunity.
- It's true.

884
00:47:49,052 --> 00:47:50,686
I have evidence to back it up.

885
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,988
It's in my bag right now.

886
00:47:53,023 --> 00:47:54,957
- Wait, you have it here?
- Why, do you want to see it?

887
00:47:54,991 --> 00:47:56,458
Price, you have to show it to me.

888
00:47:56,493 --> 00:47:57,793
I'm the Lieutenant of Homicide.

889
00:47:57,828 --> 00:48:02,197
Look at you.
Like a dog with a bone.

890
00:48:02,232 --> 00:48:03,633
If you show it to me,

891
00:48:03,667 --> 00:48:08,804
I'll totally make out with you.

892
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:10,138
Best first date ever.

893
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:15,710
Okay.

894
00:48:15,744 --> 00:48:18,846
So these are the spatter photos

895
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:20,647
from the bodies you dug up.

896
00:48:20,682 --> 00:48:22,015
I've seen those.

897
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,784
Dexter said the evidence
was inconclusive.

898
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:25,051
My blood guy disagreed.

899
00:48:25,086 --> 00:48:26,319
Well, there's no way.

900
00:48:26,353 --> 00:48:27,554
My brother's never wrong.

901
00:48:27,588 --> 00:48:29,022
My guy said the void pattern

902
00:48:29,056 --> 00:48:30,624
on this body indicates a killer

903
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:32,692
much smaller than Wayne Randall.

904
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:36,329
Smaller.

905
00:48:36,363 --> 00:48:40,766
Smaller like Hannah McKay?

906
00:48:45,572 --> 00:48:49,141
Fuck balls.

907
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:53,246
You gotta be kidding me.

908
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:16,370
I thought this place
was closed for the season.

909
00:49:16,404 --> 00:49:18,572
It is.

910
00:49:18,607 --> 00:49:21,776
So how are we gonna get in?

911
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:26,614
How do you feel about
a little breaking and entering?

912
00:49:28,317 --> 00:49:31,853
Yeah.

913
00:49:39,462 --> 00:49:41,263
All of us have some kind of longing.

914
00:49:41,297 --> 00:49:44,966
A need crying out to be met.

915
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:12,161
- What is this place?
- Shh.

916
00:50:12,195 --> 00:50:14,330
Wait.

917
00:50:21,705 --> 00:50:24,173
Some of us get what we want,
and we're happy.

918
00:50:24,207 --> 00:50:28,244
The snow.

919
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:29,579
I thought maybe if you saw it,

920
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:31,614
you could finally get some peace.

921
00:50:34,385 --> 00:50:37,796
Thank you.

922
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:39,850
Thank you.

923
00:50:48,399 --> 00:50:50,333
But some of us are never satisfied.

924
00:51:18,363 --> 00:51:20,030
When I said I wanted to take you out,

925
00:51:20,065 --> 00:51:22,299
this is what I meant.

926
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:26,536
You said you wanted to see the snow.

927
00:51:26,571 --> 00:51:32,542
This is what keeps me up at night.

928
00:51:32,577 --> 00:51:37,080
This is what I long for.

929
00:51:39,383 --> 00:51:42,919
This is what I need to...

930
00:51:42,953 --> 00:51:46,022
fill my emptiness.

931
00:51:56,533 --> 00:52:01,938
Do what you gotta do.

932
00:52:30,603 --> 00:52:33,739
Dexter.

933
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:01,635
Oh.

934
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:21,272
