1
00:01:42,297 --> 00:01:44,762
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

2
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:47,167
She accepts both sides of me.

3
00:01:47,201 --> 00:01:48,535
The whole Dexter.

4
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,039
How in the hell does the most

5
00:01:50,157 --> 00:01:51,691
crucial piece of evidence against

6
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:54,260
Isaak Sirko just disappear?

7
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:55,361
I did what you wanted.

8
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:56,929
The evidence against Sirko is gone.

9
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:59,030
I want Nadia's passport.
She's done with you

10
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:01,466
and your whole shitty
fucking organization.

11
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,001
That's not gonna happen, Joey,

12
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:05,369
so you think real hard
about your next move.

13
00:02:05,404 --> 00:02:07,672
I'm at a dead end
on Bay Harbor Butcher.

14
00:02:07,706 --> 00:02:10,174
Everything we've done,
all the evidence,

15
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:11,976
it still points to Sergeant Doakes.

16
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,213
At some point, we have to face facts.

17
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:18,048
Harrison is only going to Orlando

18
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,117
for a few weeks, Dexter.

19
00:02:20,151 --> 00:02:21,451
He's gonna be fine.

20
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:24,020
All he'll want to do
is follow Cody around.

21
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:26,556
Every time the shit
hits the fan, I go to him.

22
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,291
He's your safe place.

23
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:29,692
You're making it sound like I want to

24
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:31,961
be with him or something.

25
00:02:31,995 --> 00:02:33,863
Well, do you?

26
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:36,498
You didn't kill Viktor
out of vengeance.

27
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:39,801
I have a feeling that you're
a different kind of animal.

28
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:41,670
I can't even have a drink with someone

29
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,138
- without them dying.
- I'm sorry, Deb.

30
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,839
I wish I could tell you what happened.

31
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,007
I know what happened.

32
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,376
Hannah McKay.

33
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,778
Sal Price was writing a book on you.

34
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:52,179
You didn't like it,
so you poisoned him.

35
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,248
That's crazy.

36
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:56,383
Report's back on
the tox screen on Sal Price.

37
00:02:56,417 --> 00:02:59,385
M.E. ran it twice.
Negative both times.

38
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:02,588
That fucking bitch is gonna
get away with it again.

39
00:03:02,622 --> 00:03:04,857
Hannah McKay killed Sal Price

40
00:03:04,891 --> 00:03:08,558
and she's gonna walk.

41
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:10,787
I want you to make it right.

42
00:03:10,907 --> 00:03:12,298
Do what you do.

43
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:23,225

44
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,756
Was Deb's call just a bad dream?

45
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:32,787
Or does she really want me
to kill Hannah?

46
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,489
Morning.

47
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:37,140
- How did you sleep?
- Okay.

48
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:40,594
Special herbs from my garden.

49
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,830
It's my secret ingredient.

50
00:03:48,002 --> 00:03:49,603
How can I help?

51
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:54,542
Uh, you can dice.

52
00:04:01,716 --> 00:04:04,718
It's, uh, more my style.

53
00:04:23,105 --> 00:04:24,472
I sometimes lose track of time,

54
00:04:24,506 --> 00:04:26,841
but your calendar goes beyond that.

55
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:31,248
Oh, it's not so much
a calendar, but a reminder.

56
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:34,719
That's the year
you took off with Wayne.

57
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,255
It's not about Wayne.

58
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,125
It's Argentina.

59
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,695
What was so special about Argentina?

60
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,931
Nothing, really, I just--
I like the picture.

61
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:48,236
It looks like...nice.

62
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:51,773
Happy.
A home.

63
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:02,556
My sister,

64
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:04,091
who's also my lieutenant,

65
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:08,630
so I should probably get to work soon.

66
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:10,633
Your sister is the lieutenant?

67
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:12,937
Yeah, I didn't mention that.

68
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:15,974
No, you didn't.

69
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:23,616
Is this crazy?

70
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,786
"This"?

71
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,822
You and me,

72
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:31,292
just sitting here, eating breakfast.

73
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:33,128
I always eat breakfast.

74
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:36,164
It's important.

75
00:05:39,168 --> 00:05:41,603
I-I know
that we decided

76
00:05:41,637 --> 00:05:44,406
to never see each other again,

77
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,074
so I just want you to know that

78
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:48,543
if last night was
a one-night thing for you,

79
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:50,845
then I'm okay with that.

80
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,549
Okay.

81
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,984
But if you want
to never see each other again

82
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:59,853
tomorrow night,
then I'm okay with that too.

83
00:05:59,888 --> 00:06:03,623
Okay.

84
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:06,192
You're very agreeable.

85
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:10,095
Yep.

86
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:14,999
I need to find some way
to get her out of Debra's head,

87
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:17,735
even if I can't get her out of mine.

88
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,513
Hey, come on in.

89
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:30,982
Do you want coffee?

90
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:33,517
There's plenty.
I couldn't fucking sleep.

91
00:06:33,552 --> 00:06:36,520
Sure.

92
00:06:45,497 --> 00:06:46,497
Deb?

93
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,766
Yeah?

94
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,769
What you said last night,
you didn't mean it.

95
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:55,339
Did you?

96
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,710
Yeah, Dex, I meant it.

97
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:02,246
The good news is
I've already vetted her for you.

98
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:05,249
She's killed three people
that we know of.

99
00:07:05,284 --> 00:07:07,552
That's not including
what she did with Wayne.

100
00:07:07,586 --> 00:07:09,654
And Price had a tissue sample

101
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:11,656
and a lab report on Beverly Grey

102
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,992
that proved she was poisoned
with aconite.

103
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:17,429
But, go figure, some asshole
broke into his apartment

104
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:19,531
and disappeared
all the files on Hannah.

105
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,999
Thank you very much.

106
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,201
You're welcome.

107
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,303
You don't know she killed Price.

108
00:07:25,337 --> 00:07:27,005
You don't even know Price
was murdered.

109
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,943
You want to know what
he was doing the day he died?

110
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:33,679
He was recording this.

111
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:35,080
Then she just

112
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:39,618
kept screaming,
and there was so much blood.

113
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:43,622
What did you do?

114
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:47,393
I stabbed her
until the screaming stopped.

115
00:07:50,197 --> 00:07:52,298
Deb, she was 15.

116
00:07:52,332 --> 00:07:53,466
You want more?

117
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,067
Let's talk about how she didn't allow

118
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:58,671
her husband's body to be embalmed.

119
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:03,343
She fits your code, Dex.

120
00:08:03,377 --> 00:08:08,415
I'm not killing Hannah McKay.

121
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:18,826
You know how hard it was
for me to ask you that?

122
00:08:21,363 --> 00:08:23,531
I have been going around
in my head in circles

123
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:25,200
trying to come up with something,

124
00:08:25,234 --> 00:08:27,035
with anything that I can fucking use,

125
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:29,771
but I've got nothing.

126
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:30,939
Sal and I were so close.

127
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:32,767
If that body hadn't decomposed...

128
00:08:35,363 --> 00:08:37,552
we'd fucking have her.
She'd be locked up.

129
00:08:37,672 --> 00:08:39,059
He would be alive.

130
00:08:40,383 --> 00:08:41,783
But he's dead, and Hannah McKay

131
00:08:41,818 --> 00:08:43,352
is walking around, free to kill again.

132
00:08:43,386 --> 00:08:45,653
And she will
fucking kill again, Dexter.

133
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:48,389
That's who she is.

134
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:52,393
And I can't let that happen.
Not after Speltzer.

135
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:56,397
I wish there was another way.

136
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:01,335
You're all I have left.

137
00:09:19,521 --> 00:09:21,990
What's up?

138
00:09:22,024 --> 00:09:23,425
It's Astor.

139
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,159
"Grandpa's kidney stones
are acting up again.

140
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:26,794
"Grandma's taking him to the doctor.

141
00:09:26,829 --> 00:09:29,330
Hopefully it's not
too serious."

142
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:39,440
Deb, you told me you didn't want
to be a part of what I do.

143
00:09:39,474 --> 00:09:40,641
That was before
I realized--

144
00:09:40,675 --> 00:09:42,076
You could hardly live with yourself

145
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,111
when you lied to Batista for me.

146
00:09:44,146 --> 00:09:45,579
How do you think
you're gonna live with knowing

147
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:47,714
that you're responsible for a murder?

148
00:09:47,749 --> 00:09:51,085
Don't tell me what
I can and can't handle.

149
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,653
Turns out there's a fuck of a lot

150
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:54,489
that I can live with these days.

151
00:09:54,523 --> 00:09:56,058
No, you can't.

152
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:57,493
Ever since you found out,

153
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:58,794
you've been teetering on the edge.

154
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:00,028
You've covered up evidence,
you've lied--

155
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,564
For you!

156
00:10:01,598 --> 00:10:03,632
Yeah, that's why I can't
let you take it any further.

157
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:05,134
- For your own good.
- For my own--

158
00:10:05,168 --> 00:10:07,569
Oh, you--please do not
parent me, Dexter.

159
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:09,371
You sound like dad.

160
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:11,741
Because that's probably what he'd say.

161
00:10:11,775 --> 00:10:14,310
This isn't who you are.

162
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:17,948
Deb, I care about you too much
to let you do something

163
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:20,817
you're gonna regret.

164
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,820
I'm sorry, the answer is no.

165
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:31,362
Well I guess it's
your fucking decision, isn't it?

166
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:33,364
Even though everything
I just said is true,

167
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:38,102
it doesn't make me any less of a liar.

168
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:07,630
Excellent.

169
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,266
The police will follow Jurg
and your bodyguard

170
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,101
around all afternoon.

171
00:11:11,135 --> 00:11:12,369
And then what?

172
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,538
The cops are dicks,
but they're not morons.

173
00:11:14,572 --> 00:11:16,673
They're gonna figure out
you're not in the car.

174
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:18,842
Eventually, sure.

175
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:22,879
But by then, I'll have
taken care of my business.

176
00:11:24,682 --> 00:11:27,651
Business?
What business?

177
00:11:27,685 --> 00:11:32,322
This isn't about Dexter Morgan
again, is it?

178
00:11:32,357 --> 00:11:33,590
You're not thinking straight here.

179
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,525
He works for Miami Metro.

180
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,893
We take out one more of theirs,

181
00:11:36,927 --> 00:11:40,063
they shut this place down for good.

182
00:11:40,097 --> 00:11:42,432
We have inventory to move--

183
00:11:42,466 --> 00:11:45,735
tonight.

184
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:49,104
Come on, man, just--
just let it go.

185
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:54,876
You can go home.

186
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:17,099
Deb's got 24 hour police

187
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,767
surveillance on Isaak.

188
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,370
Which means I know where
he is at all times.

189
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:24,140
He's moved into Viktor's
apartment and hardly gone

190
00:12:24,174 --> 00:12:27,243
anywhere other than the Fox Hole
and a few restaurants.

191
00:12:27,277 --> 00:12:29,779
Hey, Dexter.
The usual?

192
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:32,748
Yeah, thanks.

193
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:34,450
Hey, do you have any Boston cremes?

194
00:12:34,484 --> 00:12:36,218
It's my sister's favorite.

195
00:12:36,253 --> 00:12:37,853
Got some fresh ones coming out now.

196
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:38,988
Take just a minute.

197
00:12:39,022 --> 00:12:41,590
Thanks.

198
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,192
Is that your plan
to keep Debra from going over

199
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:44,360
to the dark side?

200
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,462
Give her a massive sugar rush?

201
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:48,365
I don't exactly have a plan yet.

202
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,401
I can think of an obvious one.

203
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:52,836
I'm not gonna stop seeing Hannah

204
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,505
just because she's a murderer...

205
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,204
and my sister wants to kill her.

206
00:12:57,501 --> 00:12:59,910
Do you hear how that sounds?

207
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:20,097
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

208
00:13:20,131 --> 00:13:23,000
Those fucking gang kids
are at it again.

209
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:26,070
- Yeah, I guess so.
- I'm calling the police.

210
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,845
Looks like while you were
playing house with Hannah,

211
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,446
Isaak found a way to shake the police,

212
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,249
which likely means
he'll come after you again.

213
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:41,252
Well, if he can get past
Miami Metro Homicide, so can I.

214
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,520
Grandpa's gone to surgery.

215
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,722
Grandma says we have
to stay with you in Miami.

216
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:46,225
- Oh, shit.
- What?

217
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:47,359
The kids are coming.

218
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:50,529
"Kids" as in plural?

219
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,997
Grandpa has to have surgery.

220
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,866
I need to send Jamie
to Orlando to pick them up.

221
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:05,078
It was Isaak, wasn't it?

222
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,813
How the fuck did he get away
from the cops?

223
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:08,648
Does it matter?

224
00:14:08,683 --> 00:14:09,783
Did you see him?

225
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:11,117
Yeah.

226
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:13,020
Then you're a fucking witness.
I can arrest him.

227
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:14,154
You already tried that once, Deb.

228
00:14:14,189 --> 00:14:16,423
It didn't work.

229
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,125
You really want an investigation

230
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:20,827
into why Isaak Sirko
is trying to kill me?

231
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,863
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?

232
00:14:22,897 --> 00:14:25,031
Just let me handle it.

233
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,167
It's not like I have much of a choice.

234
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,035
Just be careful, okay?

235
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,237
There's one other thing.

236
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:34,306
I got a call
from the kids' grandmother.

237
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,342
- Harrison okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

238
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,045
But bill has to have
emergency surgery,

239
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,480
and Maura wants me to watch Harrison

240
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:44,350
and Astor and Cody for a few days.

241
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,586
- Now is not a good time.
- I know, but what could I say?

242
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,454
Jamie's on her way to pick them up.

243
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,889
Well they can't stay
at your fucking apartment.

244
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:53,026
Isaak probably has his own key by now.

245
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,328
Any ideas?

246
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,902
Yeah, they can stay at my place.

247
00:15:01,936 --> 00:15:05,538
I'll get patrol cars
to cover my house, just in case.

248
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:08,842
How are you gonna
explain that to LaGuerta?

249
00:15:08,876 --> 00:15:12,479
I'll tell her that I'm afraid
Isaak's gonna come after me

250
00:15:12,513 --> 00:15:14,981
for his arrest.

251
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,750
Your house
isn't exactly kid-friendly.

252
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,519
- What does that mean?
- Well, you have a gun.

253
00:15:20,554 --> 00:15:21,787
I'll lock it up.

254
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:26,359
And the pay channels.
Cody's 12.

255
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,061
Okay, I'll lock up the remote.
Anything else?

256
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,632
Anything in your kitchen
besides salsa and beer?

257
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,267
I think there was some cheese
when I moved in.

258
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:38,171
I'll have Jamie stock the fridge.

259
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,906
This is gonna be great.

260
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,976
I love kids.

261
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:47,715
I don't love kids in general,
but I love your kids.

262
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:51,086
And Astor and Cody,
it's been a long time.

263
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,387
I'll give you a heads-up
as soon as I know

264
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:54,123
when they're getting in.
Thanks.

265
00:15:54,157 --> 00:15:56,992
Yeah.

266
00:15:57,026 --> 00:15:58,694
What's that?

267
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:01,063
I'm gonna pay Hannah McKay a visit.

268
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:03,232
Why?

269
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:05,367
Just because you're
not gonna do what you do

270
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:10,372
doesn't mean she gets to live
happily fucking ever after.

271
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:11,773
I guess it was foolish to think

272
00:16:11,807 --> 00:16:14,142
Deb would simply walk away from this.

273
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:19,713
Hey!

274
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:21,782
I heard about your donut shop.

275
00:16:21,817 --> 00:16:23,717
Oh, yeah.
Pretty scary.

276
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:25,853
Francisco thinks
it was gang-related.

277
00:16:25,887 --> 00:16:28,389
Showdown between
the crullers and the fritters?

278
00:16:28,423 --> 00:16:30,491
Uh, Deb?

279
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:32,994
If you need me,
I'll be on my cell phone.

280
00:16:33,028 --> 00:16:34,362
Something up?

281
00:16:34,396 --> 00:16:36,097
Just some business
on the other side of town.

282
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:37,231
Dexter.

283
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:39,233
Ladies.

284
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:42,704
If you get a chance,
stop by Papa's after work today.

285
00:16:42,738 --> 00:16:43,938
It's under new management.

286
00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:46,407
Shut the fuck up.
You got the restaurant?

287
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:48,843
The landlord and I came
to an agreement with the lease.

288
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:50,845
Call me Papa.

289
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,012
No, I will not do that.

290
00:16:52,047 --> 00:16:54,148
But I will stop by for a drink later.

291
00:16:54,182 --> 00:16:55,483
Dex, you're in?

292
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:56,917
No, I've got the kids
coming into town, so...

293
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:59,105
It's a family place.
Bring 'em.

294
00:17:01,156 --> 00:17:02,713
Angel...

295
00:17:05,227 --> 00:17:07,962
I'm really happy for you.

296
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:11,832
1 cubic yard of cocoa mulch.

297
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,535
25 pounds of--

298
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,771
Uh, let me get back to you.

299
00:17:17,805 --> 00:17:21,107
Lieutenant.

300
00:17:21,142 --> 00:17:24,243
You, uh, in the market
for some orchids?

301
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:27,513
I'm not buying anything from you.

302
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:28,647
Look, I think you have
the wrong idea--

303
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,083
Shut up.
I'm not interested in

304
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,953
anything you have to say,
'cause you're a fucking liar.

305
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,424
I know who you are.
I know what you are.

306
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,758
Well, I think you'd be surprised

307
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:42,628
at the things that
you don't know about me.

308
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:45,631
Sal Price shared everything with me.

309
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:47,199
So you may think you're safer
because he's dead,

310
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,501
but actually, it's worse.

311
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:50,836
He was just a writer.
I'm a cop.

312
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,272
Whatever you're hiding,
I'm gonna find out.

313
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,807
Sal Price was a storyteller.

314
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:56,108
He wanted to sell books.

315
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,843
He didn't care
if they were true or not.

316
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,978
You admitted to him on tape

317
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:02,781
that you killed with Wayne.

318
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,717
How convenient that he died
before he had a chance

319
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,185
to write about it.

320
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,453
Lieutenant, what were you doing

321
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:11,623
when you were 15 years old?

322
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,091
I'm guessing you were probably

323
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,160
on a soccer team or something, right?

324
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,328
Me?

325
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:19,631
I was just some dumb farm girl
who was wakened

326
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,332
in the middle of the night
by an older boy

327
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:26,604
that I had a crush on
who said, "Let's go on a trip."

328
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:30,174
I was in over my head.

329
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,812
You knew exactly
what you were doing then.

330
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:36,814
You're in over your head now.

331
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:39,317
Well, I don't know why I care
so much about what you think,

332
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:42,687
but somehow I do, so, I'm sorry.

333
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:46,857
You haven't even begun to be sorry.

334
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,801
I'm not suggesting a coup here.

335
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,737
More like a realignment.

336
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:04,442
I'd never do anything without
the support of the brotherhood,

337
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,845
but I feel like something
has to be done

338
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:12,216
or this whole thing's
gonna explode in our faces.

339
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,621
Okay.

340
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,857
Consider it done.

341
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,044
You want to stick around?
Watch your girl?

342
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,212
Drinks on me.

343
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:41,813
I've got a better idea.

344
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,315
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

345
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,751
Ah, come on, Joey.

346
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:48,420
Nah, don't "come on, Joey" me.

347
00:19:48,454 --> 00:19:50,755
We had a deal, and you fucked me over.

348
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,357
So we're done.

349
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,360
Look, I'm sorry I couldn't
get you Nadia's passport.

350
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,395
I tried, man, but the guys in Kiev,

351
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,698
they pull the strings.

352
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,334
What I do have is some cash.

353
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,970
If you do one more job for me,

354
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,538
you can buy something for Nadia.

355
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:09,441
See, I don't want your fucking cash.

356
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,377
And if you take that out on her,

357
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,813
I'll have I.C.E. down here
faster than you can count,

358
00:20:13,847 --> 00:20:16,883
checking on the immigration
status of all your employees.

359
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,084
So go fuck yourself.

360
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,053
Bye.

361
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,055
Miami Metro believes
they know where Isaak is

362
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:23,856
at all times, but obviously

363
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,893
I can't count on that.

364
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,598
Hope he enjoys his last meal.

365
00:20:31,632 --> 00:20:34,567
When he gets home to Viktor's
apartment, I'll be waiting.

366
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:39,939
Hey, Jamie.

367
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,073
Hey, Dex.

368
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:42,408
We just made a quick pit stop.

369
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,310
I warned Cody about the big gulp,

370
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,480
but we're about three hours out

371
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:49,849
- depending on traffic.
- Great.

372
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:52,085
Why don't we meet at
your brother's new restaurant?

373
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,654
If he's got macaroni
and cheese, we'll be fine.

374
00:20:54,689 --> 00:20:57,290
Apparently that's all
Harrison's willingly consumed

375
00:20:57,325 --> 00:20:58,858
since he got to Orlando.

376
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,226
It is his favorite.

377
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,061
God, Cody, we don't want
to have to stop again.

378
00:21:02,096 --> 00:21:03,563
But I'm thirsty.

379
00:21:03,597 --> 00:21:05,098
Can't we just leave
him by the side of the road?

380
00:21:05,132 --> 00:21:06,299
No, Astor,

381
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:09,302
we can't just leave him
by the side of the road.

382
00:21:09,337 --> 00:21:11,404
Sounds like you've got
your hands full.

383
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:14,541
We'll see you in Miami, Dexter.

384
00:21:14,575 --> 00:21:16,577
Drive safe.

385
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:36,397
People always say
they'd like to die at home.

386
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:38,432
I'll leave his body here

387
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:43,837
and let the police blame it
on the Colombians.

388
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:55,015
Who the hell are you?

389
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,218
I'm the building super.
I came to fix the faucet.

390
00:21:57,252 --> 00:22:01,455
I didn't know anyone was home.

391
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,424
You're not the super.

392
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:05,793
Sure I am.
Who are you?

393
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:08,663
I'm the Avon lady.

394
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:10,398
Well, that's just silly.

395
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,466
You're here for the same reason I am.

396
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,935
- Which is?
- To kill Sirko.

397
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,138
Look, I don't know who sent you here,

398
00:22:17,172 --> 00:22:19,273
but I'm not going halvsies
with anyone.

399
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:20,275
This is my job.

400
00:22:32,488 --> 00:22:36,692
We could have just gone halvsies.

401
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,029
With all the people who want

402
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:42,865
to kill Isaak, why is it so hard

403
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:47,036
to get him dead?

404
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:58,548
Not this guy.

405
00:23:01,585 --> 00:23:04,587
This one either.

406
00:23:05,656 --> 00:23:08,057
Dexter Morgan.

407
00:23:08,092 --> 00:23:10,160
This guy had a slip.

408
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:11,328
Had?

409
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:12,929
Meaning he doesn't have one anymore?

410
00:23:12,964 --> 00:23:15,131
No. He moved
a few years back.

411
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,366
I remember it because it was odd.

412
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,402
He had, uh, eight months
to go on his lease.

413
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:22,105
When exactly did he move?

414
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,141
May, 2007.

415
00:23:27,411 --> 00:23:28,912
Are you sure?

416
00:23:28,946 --> 00:23:32,950
Yeah.

417
00:23:38,823 --> 00:23:41,024
You're getting heavier.
What did they feed you up there?

418
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,192
Mac and cheese.

419
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:44,494
And more mac and cheese.

420
00:23:44,528 --> 00:23:46,096
You want to go play
on the beach after we eat?

421
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,498
Oh, I can take him now.

422
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:51,101
Astor and Cody were fighting
the entire drive down.

423
00:23:51,136 --> 00:23:53,203
I need a break.

424
00:23:53,237 --> 00:23:57,040
- Mojitos on the house.
- All right.

425
00:23:57,074 --> 00:23:59,309
For the grown-ups.

426
00:23:59,343 --> 00:24:00,510
Sodas for the kids.

427
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:03,046
Sorry, I gotta keep my liquor license.

428
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,781
Everything good here?

429
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:07,016
It's perfect.
Thanks, Angel.

430
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:11,688
Perfect because it has
a built-in security system.

431
00:24:11,722 --> 00:24:14,891
Dexter, check out
my <i>Angry Birds</i> score.

432
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:16,292
Dexter doesn't want to see
your <i>Angry Birds</i> score, Cody.

433
00:24:16,327 --> 00:24:18,861
Put it away.

434
00:24:18,896 --> 00:24:20,296
I've missed you guys.

435
00:24:20,331 --> 00:24:21,898
We missed you too.

436
00:24:21,932 --> 00:24:23,033
So how's school?

437
00:24:23,067 --> 00:24:24,968
Is math still kicking your ass?

438
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:26,636
Butt.

439
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,804
Kicking your butt.

440
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:28,972
That's what I said.

441
00:24:29,006 --> 00:24:30,807
Is math still kicking your butt?

442
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:34,277
I'm a year ahead in math now,
and I'm taking A.P. Bio.

443
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:36,313
Impressive.

444
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,682
She passed out when
they dissected the fetal pig.

445
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:42,219
Can we not talk about
fetal pigs at dinner?

446
00:24:43,688 --> 00:24:45,255
God, Cody, can we not
get through one dinner

447
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,724
without you doing something
completely disgusting?

448
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,026
Can you stop acting like miss perfect?

449
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:51,561
You can't even make it
through a weekend

450
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:53,897
without smoking pot.

451
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:55,932
Oh, my God.
You know how many cops are here?

452
00:24:55,966 --> 00:24:57,200
You want to get arrested?

453
00:24:57,234 --> 00:25:00,203
God, what is wrong with you?

454
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:05,008
Guess I should go talk to her.

455
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:09,078
I'll be your backup.

456
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:16,953
I don't do it
a lot, I swear.

457
00:25:16,987 --> 00:25:20,190
Just when I get really stressed out.

458
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:22,293
You want to tell me what's going on?

459
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:23,561
It's just pot.

460
00:25:23,595 --> 00:25:26,664
In some states,
it's not even against the law.

461
00:25:26,698 --> 00:25:29,868
It's always against the law
for someone your age,

462
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:32,404
which is for your own good,
by the way.

463
00:25:32,438 --> 00:25:33,972
Thanks for the public
service announcement.

464
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:35,107
Dexter's right.

465
00:25:35,141 --> 00:25:36,341
Sometimes the things that seem

466
00:25:36,376 --> 00:25:37,576
like a good idea in the moment

467
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,580
are the things you'll
end up regretting later.

468
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:44,129
Astor...

469
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:47,882
I know how...

470
00:25:49,255 --> 00:25:53,125
certain vices can be used
to relieve stress.

471
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:59,799
But sometimes those vices
can cause more problems

472
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,801
than the original stress.

473
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:06,372
Okay, I get it, pot is evil.
Are we done?

474
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:09,409
We--sure, we're done.

475
00:26:24,727 --> 00:26:26,228
Kids are all asleep in your room.

476
00:26:26,262 --> 00:26:28,630
I put Harrison on your bed.
I hope that's okay.

477
00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:31,233
Yeah, sure.

478
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:33,636
He doesn't wet the bed, does he?

479
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,770
Not always.

480
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:37,106
You owe me.

481
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,541
Jamie will be here first thing
in the morning.

482
00:26:39,576 --> 00:26:41,977
Hey, Dex.

483
00:26:42,012 --> 00:26:43,360
Um...

484
00:26:44,681 --> 00:26:47,883
maybe you were right...

485
00:26:47,917 --> 00:26:50,720
about Hannah.

486
00:26:50,754 --> 00:26:51,988
I mean, don't get me wrong.

487
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:54,786
If anyone deserves
what you do, she does, but...

488
00:26:57,127 --> 00:26:58,361
it must have been hard to resist,

489
00:26:58,395 --> 00:27:00,096
and I know you did it for me.

490
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:03,899
So...thanks for caring.

491
00:27:06,035 --> 00:27:10,038
You don't have to thank me.

492
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:15,743
Thanks for taking everyone in.

493
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:19,881
My home is their home.

494
00:27:19,915 --> 00:27:21,148
My family.

495
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:23,651
All that's left of it is here,
under one roof.

496
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:26,020
It should feel like home.

497
00:27:26,054 --> 00:27:30,357
So why do I want so badly
to be somewhere else?

498
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,334
Look who's not here again.

499
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:43,103
Is this a bad time?

500
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:44,972
Fortunately,
you've managed to catch me

501
00:27:45,006 --> 00:27:48,576
in between gentleman callers.

502
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,511
Well, I guess it's my lucky night.

503
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:52,313
What brings you by?

504
00:27:52,348 --> 00:27:55,249
Or is this your version
of a booty call?

505
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:57,251
What's a booty call?

506
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:59,086
Seriously?

507
00:27:59,121 --> 00:28:01,489
Actually, I just stopped by
because I'm gonna be busy

508
00:28:01,523 --> 00:28:02,690
for the next few days.

509
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:04,292
So you came by to see me

510
00:28:04,326 --> 00:28:06,594
because you can't see me?

511
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:09,230
Something like that.

512
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:12,033
So what's got you so busy?

513
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:14,954
Nothing, I just--uh...

514
00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:20,575
the head of the Koshka
brotherhood wants to kill me.

515
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:25,939
You're not kidding.

516
00:28:27,376 --> 00:28:30,218
Well I don't know what
a Koshka brotherhood is,

517
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:31,386
but it sounds bad.

518
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,122
It's kind of a...

519
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:37,559
- Ukrainian mafia.
- Wow.

520
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:39,761
What did you do to piss them off?

521
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:42,631
Not them.
Just Isaak Sirko.

522
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:45,467
He has this personal vendetta
against me.

523
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:48,636
Why?

524
00:28:48,671 --> 00:28:51,406
I killed one of his key guys.

525
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,275
Oh.
Well, it happens.

526
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:58,947
So what do you know
about this Isaak Sirko?

527
00:28:58,982 --> 00:29:00,582
I know that he wants to kill me,

528
00:29:00,617 --> 00:29:02,684
and that I need to kill him first,

529
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:06,321
and that it's harder
than I thought it would be.

530
00:29:06,355 --> 00:29:09,891
Well, you want my advice?

531
00:29:09,925 --> 00:29:12,126
Uh, sure.

532
00:29:12,161 --> 00:29:13,394
You spent a lot of time

533
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:17,098
finding out all about me
before you--

534
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:19,333
Before I tried to kill you.

535
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:21,669
Right.

536
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:22,803
This is different.

537
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:25,439
I had to make sure
that you fit my code.

538
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,575
I already know Isaak's a killer.

539
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:28,976
Well, still, it seems like
you have a system,

540
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,079
and it's working for you, right?

541
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:32,580
Most of the time.

542
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:35,650
Well, so why don't you try
the same thing on this guy?

543
00:29:35,684 --> 00:29:40,755
Figure out who he is, and why
he really wants to kill you.

544
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:44,292
Here.

545
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:47,328
Take my van.
He might know your car.

546
00:29:47,363 --> 00:29:50,265
Besides, it'll give you
a decent excuse to come by

547
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:54,302
and not see me again.

548
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,683
I have never been able
to talk to anyone

549
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:12,888
about my kills before.

550
00:30:12,922 --> 00:30:15,357
Not like this.

551
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:20,495
No judgment, no fear, no panic.

552
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:24,199
- That's nice.
- Yeah.

553
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:27,669
But I'm kind of tired of talking.

554
00:30:27,704 --> 00:30:30,038
Maybe I can show you
what a booty call is.

555
00:30:30,072 --> 00:30:33,775
Mm.

556
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:43,319
Come on, Joey.
It's not that bad.

557
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:45,555
I only have to work for George
for two more years,

558
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:47,022
and then I'll have my freedom.

559
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:49,424
You believe that?

560
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,826
He likes his dancers young.

561
00:30:51,861 --> 00:30:55,864
There are always more girls
who want to come here.

562
00:30:57,066 --> 00:30:59,534
I'm sorry I let you down.

563
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:04,106
Just promise me you'll never
do anything for them again.

564
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,143
Not even for me.

565
00:31:08,178 --> 00:31:10,880
I promise.

566
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:13,817
Okay.
I'm gonna take a shower.

567
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:16,853
Okay.

568
00:31:37,509 --> 00:31:41,512
How'd I know I'd find
your horny ass here?

569
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:46,317
I got something to show you.

570
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:48,119
I'm not interested.

571
00:31:48,153 --> 00:31:51,322
Oh, I think you might be.

572
00:31:51,356 --> 00:31:52,490
But Isaak Sirko,

573
00:31:52,524 --> 00:31:54,625
he wants you to lose
the blood evidence

574
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,794
linking him to the Colombian murders.

575
00:31:58,497 --> 00:32:01,232
Let me skip to the good part.

576
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:05,570
If I do this, Nadia's a free woman.

577
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:09,607
You give me her fucking
passport, understand?

578
00:32:09,642 --> 00:32:12,210
Deal.
And I'll do you one better.

579
00:32:12,244 --> 00:32:14,079
You can even keep the cash.

580
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:17,415
Now do we
understand each other?

581
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:20,985
If I go down,
you're going down with me.

582
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:25,823
It won't exactly ruin my reputation.

583
00:32:25,858 --> 00:32:27,725
I got the Koshka brotherhood
behind me.

584
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,128
You saw how long
Sirko stayed behind bars.

585
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:31,963
Who's gonna save your ass?

586
00:32:31,998 --> 00:32:34,499
Miami Metro?

587
00:32:34,534 --> 00:32:35,700
What do you want?

588
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,937
Same kind of shit
you used to do for us.

589
00:32:38,971 --> 00:32:40,238
You know, we have some product
that needs to move.

590
00:32:40,272 --> 00:32:43,341
I need a cop around
to make sure nothing goes wrong.

591
00:32:43,376 --> 00:32:44,876
If you help us, you make some money.

592
00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:48,714
And if you don't, that recording
goes on the fucking cloud.

593
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:51,082
I'm sorry to twist your arm, buddy,

594
00:32:51,117 --> 00:32:54,186
but you really left me no choice.

595
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,454
I'll see you tonight.

596
00:33:06,265 --> 00:33:08,199
No one else here.

597
00:33:08,234 --> 00:33:11,503
Not anymore, anyway.

598
00:33:11,537 --> 00:33:12,837
Do you recognize him?

599
00:33:12,872 --> 00:33:14,639
He's one of George's men.

600
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:16,941
Sent here to kill me.

601
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:19,110
George wouldn't make a move
without getting approval

602
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:22,113
from the boys in Kiev.

603
00:33:22,147 --> 00:33:23,314
So much for brotherhood.

604
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:24,449
This can be fixed.

605
00:33:24,483 --> 00:33:26,484
- We can go home, we can call--
- No.

606
00:33:26,518 --> 00:33:29,854
I'm a dead man there.

607
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:32,924
You've already gone above and beyond

608
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:34,492
the call of duty, Jurg.

609
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:37,429
Your loyalty could get you killed.

610
00:33:37,463 --> 00:33:42,901
Where you go, I go.

611
00:33:42,935 --> 00:33:45,236
My offshore accounts
should last some time.

612
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:49,106
But I won't have access
to the corporate accounts.

613
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,341
Bloody hell!

614
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,276
Then there's this.

615
00:33:53,311 --> 00:33:55,145
We're gonna need
another place to stay.

616
00:33:55,179 --> 00:33:58,381
Who do you think killed him?

617
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:02,119
Well that's a job
for the police, isn't it?

618
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:04,921
Why don't you go and give
our friends downstairs a call.

619
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:19,835
Looks like the gang's all here.

620
00:34:22,438 --> 00:34:23,905
So you have no idea

621
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,474
what he was doing in your apartment?

622
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:27,709
Not a clue.

623
00:34:27,744 --> 00:34:30,078
But I'm sure your trusty
blood spatter analyst

624
00:34:30,113 --> 00:34:31,613
could figure it out.

625
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:33,982
Mr. Sirko,
the gun that we found

626
00:34:34,017 --> 00:34:37,152
would suggest that he came here
to kill someone.

627
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:39,320
And since you live here,

628
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:42,423
that someone may very well be you.

629
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:44,559
What a frightening thought.

630
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:47,028
Then perhaps I need
some sort of police escort.

631
00:34:47,062 --> 00:34:49,931
Oh, I already have that.

632
00:34:49,965 --> 00:34:51,199
Well we'll have to confirm
with the M.E.,

633
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:53,735
but judging by the lividity
and state of rigor,

634
00:34:53,769 --> 00:34:55,603
I'd estimate the time of death

635
00:34:55,638 --> 00:34:57,605
as sometime yesterday afternoon.

636
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,143
Let me see now,
where was I yesterday afternoon?

637
00:35:02,177 --> 00:35:05,313
Perhaps these kind officers
could refresh my memory.

638
00:35:05,347 --> 00:35:07,448
Unis tailed him all day.

639
00:35:07,482 --> 00:35:08,716
He wasn't here.

640
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,285
Seems I have an alibi.

641
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,653
I hope they're trustworthy.

642
00:35:12,688 --> 00:35:14,288
Dex, what have you got?

643
00:35:14,323 --> 00:35:16,824
Yes, please, Dex, tell us your theory.

644
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:19,493
I'm so curious.

645
00:35:19,528 --> 00:35:23,498
Well, judging by the photo
found in the victim's pocket,

646
00:35:23,532 --> 00:35:26,234
he was lying in wait
for Mr. Sirko.

647
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:28,669
Here you go.

648
00:35:28,704 --> 00:35:31,238
These scuff marks indicate a struggle.

649
00:35:31,273 --> 00:35:34,508
They fell to the floor.

650
00:35:34,542 --> 00:35:38,012
And the killer cut his carotid artery

651
00:35:38,046 --> 00:35:42,716
with one swipe of a very sharp knife.

652
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,950
My, my.

653
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:45,352
You couldn't have described
that better

654
00:35:45,386 --> 00:35:48,856
if you'd been there yourself.

655
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:51,291
Thanks.

656
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:52,960
Hey, Vince, I have plans
with the kids today.

657
00:35:52,994 --> 00:35:54,962
You think you can finish this up?

658
00:35:54,996 --> 00:35:56,630
Fine. But one of these days,
I'm gonna track down

659
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:58,832
some of my kids so that
I can skip out on work.

660
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,368
Thanks.

661
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:03,236
Vince is gonna take it from here.

662
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,671
Keep him occupied as long as you can.

663
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,406
Kill ya later, Isaak.

664
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:08,808
Yeah!

665
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:11,143
Oh, that's gonna be really good.

666
00:36:11,178 --> 00:36:13,979
See, get it all up in there.

667
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:15,680
Yeah!

668
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,417
That's a strong castle, mister.

669
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:22,221
You're doing so good.

670
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:23,756
Want that?

671
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,492
He did it all himself.

672
00:36:26,526 --> 00:36:30,096
- That's pretty awesome.
- Yummy.

673
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:31,263
You know what, I think you need

674
00:36:31,298 --> 00:36:34,500
a little bit more sunscreen, Harrison.

675
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:36,936
Hey, buddy, you know what
this place needs?

676
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,504
A moat!

677
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:42,541
Keep the bad guys out.

678
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:49,247
Oh.

679
00:36:49,282 --> 00:36:53,251
I'll be back in a minute.

680
00:36:53,286 --> 00:36:56,288
Can I have some of that leg?

681
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,534
I miss the beach.

682
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:09,937
It reminds me of mom.

683
00:37:09,971 --> 00:37:13,408
Yeah, she used to take
you guys here all the time.

684
00:37:13,442 --> 00:37:15,409
Atlanta doesn't feel like home,

685
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:16,777
but here doesn't either.

686
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:20,747
It's like there's no place
I actually belong.

687
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:24,017
You know what I mean?

688
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:27,054
Actually, yeah, I do.

689
00:37:27,088 --> 00:37:30,757
If my grandparents
find out about the pot,

690
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,993
they'll think I'm just turning
into my dad or something.

691
00:37:33,028 --> 00:37:34,662
I feel like they're
just waiting for that

692
00:37:34,696 --> 00:37:37,030
to happen anyways.

693
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:44,105
You know, when I was younger,
someone told me who I was,

694
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:49,645
and I pretty much took
his word for it.

695
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:55,150
If I'd taken the time
to decide for myself,

696
00:37:55,184 --> 00:37:57,586
I would have turned out different.

697
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,855
Different how?

698
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:03,859
I don't really know,
but I kind of wish I did.

699
00:38:05,695 --> 00:38:09,231
For the record,
you didn't turn out so bad.

700
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:20,043
For the record, the pot
will stay off the record.

701
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:33,322
Just give me a sec.

702
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:36,159
Hey, Hannah.

703
00:38:36,193 --> 00:38:38,728
Hey. I'm sorry
to bother you,

704
00:38:38,762 --> 00:38:41,230
but I accidentally left
my greenhouse keys in the van.

705
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:43,599
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

706
00:38:43,634 --> 00:38:46,069
I could bring them by in a few hours.

707
00:38:46,103 --> 00:38:50,641
Just tell me where you are
and I'll swing by.

708
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:52,710
Hobie Beach.
Tower one.

709
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:56,380
Okay, great.
I'll call you when I get there.

710
00:39:08,492 --> 00:39:13,529
- Is this the one?
- Yeah, thanks.

711
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:16,465
So, what are you doing out here?

712
00:39:16,499 --> 00:39:18,767
Hey, Dexter!

713
00:39:18,801 --> 00:39:22,204
Look!

714
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:24,406
Oh, right.

715
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,540
Of course.

716
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:27,276
I should've seen that one coming.

717
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:30,846
No, she's not, um--

718
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,681
She's my nanny.

719
00:39:32,716 --> 00:39:35,918
Your nanny?

720
00:39:35,952 --> 00:39:39,889
Yeah, that little guy is my son.

721
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:43,292
Harrison.
He's three.

722
00:39:43,327 --> 00:39:45,261
I told you about his mother,

723
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:47,230
how she passed away.

724
00:39:47,264 --> 00:39:49,766
The other two are Astor and Cody.

725
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,167
They're my stepkids.

726
00:39:51,202 --> 00:39:54,645
They live in Orlando
with their grandparents.

727
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:57,640
Harrison lives with me...

728
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,524
most of the time.

729
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:06,217
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

730
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:08,252
You didn't trust me,
or you were afraid it would

731
00:40:08,286 --> 00:40:11,222
push me away?

732
00:40:11,256 --> 00:40:15,159
Maybe a little of both.

733
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:19,197
Well I'd love to meet them sometime.

734
00:40:20,265 --> 00:40:22,567
You're lucky, Dexter.

735
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:24,068
Lucky?

736
00:40:24,102 --> 00:40:25,669
No matter where I go,

737
00:40:25,704 --> 00:40:29,941
I'm Hannah McKay,
the spree killer's girlfriend.

738
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:32,243
Nobody has a clue who you are.

739
00:40:32,277 --> 00:40:37,915
You get to have this
normal life, with kids and...

740
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:43,653
Is that something you want?

741
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:45,722
It was, once upon a time.

742
00:40:45,756 --> 00:40:48,459
Wayne and I talked about
having ten of them.

743
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:51,929
Can you imagine what a train
wreck that would have been?

744
00:40:51,964 --> 00:40:53,731
Then when I got married to Jake,

745
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:55,600
I thought, "This is how it's
supposed to be," you know?

746
00:40:55,634 --> 00:40:59,637
But when that whole thing
went to shit,

747
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:04,708
I just figured it wasn't really
in the cards for me.

748
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:07,010
That's what I used to think too.

749
00:41:07,045 --> 00:41:09,547
Dex! Get over here!

750
00:41:09,581 --> 00:41:12,149
Well, I won't intrude.

751
00:41:12,184 --> 00:41:14,652
Enjoy your time with them.

752
00:41:14,686 --> 00:41:16,454
Okay.

753
00:41:34,641 --> 00:41:35,741
Hey.

754
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:38,310
Everyone asleep?

755
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:41,046
Yeah, finally.

756
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,948
Dexter, you did not
tell me that bedtime

757
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:45,417
is, like, this two hour process.

758
00:41:45,452 --> 00:41:46,818
And that reading
those Dr. Seuss books

759
00:41:46,853 --> 00:41:48,587
out loud is really fucking hard.

760
00:41:48,621 --> 00:41:52,024
Sorry I missed that.

761
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:53,860
Teenagers are great, though.
You just tell them what to do.

762
00:41:53,894 --> 00:41:56,129
I mean, my house
has never looked so clean.

763
00:41:56,163 --> 00:41:59,265
I love families.

764
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:03,569
Does Hannah fit into
my family somewhere?

765
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,582
What's that doing here?

766
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:19,518
Oh, I borrowed a car from a friend

767
00:42:19,552 --> 00:42:22,854
so Isaak wouldn't recognize me.

768
00:42:22,889 --> 00:42:26,892
Does that friend
happen to be Hannah McKay?

769
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:32,297
I was going to--

770
00:42:32,331 --> 00:42:35,233
Oh, my God.

771
00:42:39,872 --> 00:42:44,076
Are you fucking her?

772
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,410
Deb, I can explain.

773
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:50,115
I know what fucking is.
No explanation necessary.

774
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,486
Is that why you wouldn't kill her?

775
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,989
Partially.

776
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:04,899
I am the biggest asshole
on the planet.

777
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:07,235
All that bullshit about
you caring about me too much

778
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,770
to let me do something I would regret?

779
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:10,839
I fucking bought it.

780
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:13,976
Deb, everything I said was true.

781
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:21,617
Okay, yes, I didn't kill Hannah

782
00:43:21,651 --> 00:43:23,018
because I have feelings for her,

783
00:43:23,052 --> 00:43:24,353
but that doesn't make
what I said to you

784
00:43:24,387 --> 00:43:27,322
- any less true.
- Feelings?

785
00:43:27,357 --> 00:43:30,592
Are you in love with her?

786
00:43:30,627 --> 00:43:32,995
I don't know.

787
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:36,665
Is it because she's a serial killer?

788
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,568
Does that turn you on or something?

789
00:43:39,603 --> 00:43:41,337
What--what do you all do?

790
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:42,371
Do you sit around and talk about

791
00:43:42,405 --> 00:43:47,009
who you're gonna take out next?

792
00:43:47,044 --> 00:43:50,880
Oh, my God.

793
00:43:50,914 --> 00:43:53,749
Price?

794
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:56,118
Did you fucking help her with Price?

795
00:43:56,153 --> 00:43:57,686
No!

796
00:43:57,721 --> 00:43:59,889
I don't even know
why I fucking ask you, Dexter.

797
00:43:59,923 --> 00:44:01,958
Every time I think
I know exactly who you are,

798
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:04,193
you tell me something worse.

799
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:05,728
Being with Hannah
is worse than being a killer?

800
00:44:05,762 --> 00:44:08,130
Yes!

801
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:12,168
No. I don't--

802
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:17,373
I know you're not gonna stop killing.

803
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:22,078
I mean, you've made that very clear.

804
00:44:22,112 --> 00:44:25,047
But you can stop seeing her.

805
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:27,950
I don't want to stop seeing her.

806
00:44:27,984 --> 00:44:30,852
Look what happened
to her husband, Dexter.

807
00:44:30,886 --> 00:44:33,488
She doesn't have
the best track record with men.

808
00:44:33,522 --> 00:44:36,290
I don't even want to talk about
the fucking body trail

809
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,326
that you've left in your love life.

810
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,363
I'm not asking your permission, Deb.

811
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:44,266
So you don't care what it does to me?

812
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,435
I don't want to hurt you.

813
00:44:46,469 --> 00:44:49,271
Well, guess what?
You did.

814
00:44:49,306 --> 00:44:51,974
You picked the one way
that you could hurt me

815
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:54,778
worse than you could ever
fucking understand.

816
00:44:54,812 --> 00:44:57,981
Wha--

817
00:44:58,015 --> 00:44:59,883
You told me you accepted
me being a killer.

818
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:01,518
I feel like if you love me,
you'll accept this.

819
00:45:01,552 --> 00:45:02,719
If I love you?

820
00:45:02,753 --> 00:45:04,121
<i>If</i> I love you!

821
00:45:04,155 --> 00:45:05,522
I went to the church that night

822
00:45:05,556 --> 00:45:06,757
that you killed Travis Marshall

823
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:10,761
to tell you that I'm <i>in</i> love with you!

824
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:20,571
You're...

825
00:45:20,605 --> 00:45:21,972
in love with me?

826
00:45:22,006 --> 00:45:25,943
Fuck!
Oh, my God.

827
00:45:27,712 --> 00:45:31,514
<i>Was.</i>

828
00:45:31,549 --> 00:45:33,616
I don't even know
if I fucking <i>like</i> you.

829
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:36,586
This is--

830
00:45:36,621 --> 00:45:39,589
Oh, forget it.

831
00:45:44,361 --> 00:45:47,730
What do you mean
you're in love with me?

832
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:55,170
I didn't--
I didn't mean to say that.

833
00:45:55,205 --> 00:45:59,775
I don't--

834
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,544
I know it's weird, and it's gross,

835
00:46:01,578 --> 00:46:06,015
and it's fucked up, but--

836
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:09,886
And I know you don't feel the same.

837
00:46:11,022 --> 00:46:12,856
I don't even know if feel the same.

838
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,125
I mean, it's one thing to be
in love with your brother,

839
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:17,160
but it is a whole 'nother level

840
00:46:17,195 --> 00:46:18,362
to be in love with your brother

841
00:46:18,396 --> 00:46:21,699
who's a goddamn fucking serial killer.

842
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:27,271
You're a serial killer,

843
00:46:27,305 --> 00:46:31,509
and I'm more fucked up than you are!

844
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:45,889
Well, aren't you going
to say anything?

845
00:46:52,963 --> 00:46:55,364
I'm sorry.

846
00:47:01,805 --> 00:47:04,507
I don't know what to say.

847
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:08,544
Oh, God, you never do.

848
00:47:11,848 --> 00:47:13,016
Will you please just go?

849
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:14,284
I really--
I can't look at you.

850
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:30,100
What are you gonna do,

851
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:31,835
just keep following Isaak
around all night?

852
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:33,470
I can really use a kill tonight.

853
00:47:33,504 --> 00:47:35,205
After what just happened
with your sister?

854
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:37,441
She's not--

855
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:40,010
she's not in love with me.
That's insane.

856
00:47:40,044 --> 00:47:41,378
You have to admit, it explains a lot.

857
00:47:41,412 --> 00:47:43,380
Why she didn't arrest you.

858
00:47:43,415 --> 00:47:45,615
Why she keeps believing all your lies.

859
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:46,750
Why she's willing to give up

860
00:47:46,784 --> 00:47:49,086
everything she believes in, for you.

861
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,254
What am I supposed to do?

862
00:47:50,288 --> 00:47:52,590
I can't feel
what Deb wants me to feel.

863
00:47:52,624 --> 00:47:54,425
You don't even know
how she wants you to feel.

864
00:47:54,459 --> 00:47:55,693
You just left.

865
00:47:55,727 --> 00:47:57,795
She asked me to leave.

866
00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,264
Dexter...

867
00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:02,033
calm down.

868
00:48:02,067 --> 00:48:04,936
Oh, well, you know
what I do to calm myself.

869
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,878
Where is Isaak going?

870
00:48:13,913 --> 00:48:16,915
Looks like a bar.

871
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,391
I'll give him half a dose.

872
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:27,727
I'll walk out the back
so the police don't see me.

873
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:30,964
I'll look like a friend walking
his drunk buddy to his car.

874
00:48:30,998 --> 00:48:33,466
He could be leading you into a trap.

875
00:48:33,501 --> 00:48:37,304
Not to mention, the police
are only 100 feet away.

876
00:48:57,558 --> 00:48:59,492
What a pleasant surprise.

877
00:48:59,527 --> 00:49:01,861
We both know you can't kill me here.

878
00:49:01,896 --> 00:49:04,297
Oh, I can.

879
00:49:04,331 --> 00:49:06,966
But I won't.

880
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,667
Has to be some vestige
of civility left,

881
00:49:08,702 --> 00:49:10,335
even in this corner of the world.

882
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:13,705
You call shooting at me
in a donut shop "civil"?

883
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,373
Afraid I was short
on time and opportunity.

884
00:49:15,407 --> 00:49:16,541
Barman!

885
00:49:16,575 --> 00:49:19,110
Can I have a beer for my friend,
Dexter Morgan.

886
00:49:19,144 --> 00:49:22,614
Now we can both relax.

887
00:49:22,648 --> 00:49:24,783
Unlike most places on the planet,

888
00:49:24,817 --> 00:49:29,421
everyone's welcome here.

889
00:49:38,365 --> 00:49:39,932
You thought your enemies
wouldn't follow you

890
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:41,967
into a gay bar?

891
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:45,238
No.

892
00:49:45,272 --> 00:49:49,709
I thought I'd feel comfortable
in a gay bar.

893
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:55,415
Ironic, isn't it?

894
00:49:55,449 --> 00:49:56,716
I always feared the brotherhood

895
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:59,152
would learn my secret
and turn against me.

896
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:01,220
And now they've turned
against me anyway

897
00:50:01,255 --> 00:50:02,889
and none the wiser about this.

898
00:50:02,923 --> 00:50:04,357
Incidentally, I will have to thank you

899
00:50:04,391 --> 00:50:06,058
for slitting that assassin's throat.

900
00:50:06,093 --> 00:50:07,593
You might have saved my life.

901
00:50:07,628 --> 00:50:12,832
But you must explain to me
your aversion to guns sometime.

902
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:15,134
It's complicated.

903
00:50:15,168 --> 00:50:19,104
I can imagine it is.

904
00:50:21,274 --> 00:50:24,309
You should cut your losses, Isaak.

905
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:28,980
Go back to Kiev.

906
00:50:29,014 --> 00:50:31,515
There's nothing waiting for me
back in Kiev,

907
00:50:31,549 --> 00:50:34,017
except for a large,
well-staffed house;

908
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:35,219
an attractive secretary

909
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:37,989
who occasionally pretends
we're an item

910
00:50:38,023 --> 00:50:40,992
to keep the rumors from circulating.

911
00:50:44,897 --> 00:50:47,065
The one thing that made
my life worth living in Kiev,

912
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:51,236
you tossed in the ocean
a few weeks back.

913
00:50:51,271 --> 00:50:52,404
You and Viktor were--

914
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:56,442
Lovers.
More than that.

915
00:50:58,745 --> 00:51:01,447
You--you took from me
the one thing

916
00:51:01,482 --> 00:51:06,219
that money and power can't bring back.

917
00:51:06,253 --> 00:51:08,454
And now, thanks to you,

918
00:51:08,488 --> 00:51:12,358
most of the luxuries are gone too.

919
00:51:12,392 --> 00:51:13,593
Not because of me.

920
00:51:13,627 --> 00:51:15,728
Because of this vendetta
you're holding on to.

921
00:51:15,762 --> 00:51:20,098
And what did you do to the man
who murdered your spouse?

922
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:22,768
Nothing you wouldn't have done.

923
00:51:22,802 --> 00:51:27,873
Nothing I wouldn't do
a thousand times over again.

924
00:51:27,908 --> 00:51:29,408
Did it help?

925
00:51:29,443 --> 00:51:33,446
She's still dead.

926
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:37,950
I can see that Viktor
meant a great deal to you,

927
00:51:37,984 --> 00:51:39,284
but he was a killer,

928
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:42,021
and he got what he deserved.

929
00:51:42,055 --> 00:51:43,389
My wife was innocent.

930
00:51:45,025 --> 00:51:48,360
And if she weren't,
you'd feel the same.

931
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:52,431
That's how love is.

932
00:51:52,465 --> 00:51:55,834
It's a powerful weapon.

933
00:51:55,868 --> 00:51:59,838
It can work for us
or against us, can't it?

934
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:05,110
I don't understand much about love.

935
00:52:05,145 --> 00:52:08,480
Well, that's because
you're a scientist.

936
00:52:08,514 --> 00:52:10,849
Love defies reason.

937
00:52:10,884 --> 00:52:14,787
Nothing defies reason.

938
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:18,257
Logically, Viktor and I
shouldn't have been together.

939
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:20,693
I mean, aside from
the obvious social stigma,

940
00:52:20,727 --> 00:52:24,229
Viktor was impulsive, foolhardy even.

941
00:52:24,264 --> 00:52:28,167
Always out to prove something.

942
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:30,669
I suppose the heart knows something

943
00:52:30,704 --> 00:52:33,672
that we just don't know.

944
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:39,946
Or maybe the heart is just wrong.

945
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,614
Oh, I doubt that.

946
00:52:41,648 --> 00:52:44,350
Love can be inconvenient,

947
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:46,419
perhaps inappropriate.

948
00:52:46,453 --> 00:52:49,255
It can be dangerous.

949
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:53,526
Make us do things
we wouldn't dream of doing.

950
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:59,265
But wrong?

951
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:02,235
That just depends on

952
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:05,105
where we end up, doesn't it?

953
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,345
We don't have to do this.

954
00:53:11,379 --> 00:53:13,981
I <i>do</i> have to do this.

955
00:53:14,016 --> 00:53:17,818
And then what?

956
00:53:17,852 --> 00:53:19,085
Then?

957
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:22,756
Well, I hadn't
really thought about it.

958
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:25,158
I suppose I'll take my funds
and find some little attractive

959
00:53:25,192 --> 00:53:26,425
corner of the world,

960
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:32,097
and while away my days
in comfort and anonymity.

961
00:53:32,131 --> 00:53:33,531
Argentina.

962
00:53:33,566 --> 00:53:35,366
Actually, I was
thinking more like Micronesia,

963
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:39,170
but each to their own.

964
00:53:39,204 --> 00:53:42,840
We're outsiders, you and I.

965
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:45,376
On the periphery.

966
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:47,745
Watching everybody else.

967
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:53,317
Pretending we're just like them,
but knowing we're not.

968
00:53:53,351 --> 00:53:55,052
Best we can hope for
is to find a place

969
00:53:55,086 --> 00:53:57,254
where we don't have to pretend.

970
00:54:01,526 --> 00:54:04,629
It's a shame, really.

971
00:54:04,663 --> 00:54:05,897
Under different circumstances,

972
00:54:05,931 --> 00:54:10,068
I think we could have been
great friends.

973
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:23,883
Till next time.

974
00:54:35,463 --> 00:54:39,299
Everyone wants an Argentina.

975
00:54:39,334 --> 00:54:43,336
A place where the slate
is wiped clean.

976
00:54:45,939 --> 00:54:49,409
Isaak, I'm at
the airport in Miami.

977
00:54:49,443 --> 00:54:54,013
I'll be home soon.

978
00:54:54,047 --> 00:54:57,516
Isaak, I'm at
the airport in Miami.

979
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:02,354
I'll be home soon.

980
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:03,488
But the truth is,

981
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:07,526
Argentina...is just Argentina.

982
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:24,076
No matter where we go,
we take ourselves

983
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:28,113
and our damage with us.

984
00:55:37,757 --> 00:55:39,825
So is home the place we run to,

985
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:41,923
or is it the place we run from...

986
00:55:50,802 --> 00:55:53,036
only to hide out in places
where we're accepted,

987
00:55:53,071 --> 00:55:55,506
unconditionally.

988
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,067
Places that feel
more like home to us...

989
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:20,834
because we can finally be who we are.

990
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:40,085
