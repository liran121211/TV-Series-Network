2
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:47,957
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:49,459
Who is Dexter Morgan?

4
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:54,029
He's just a jerk who works
for Miami Metro Homicide.

5
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:56,131
Now can I please go?

6
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:57,799
Yes.

7
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,036
So you're not interested in alcohol

8
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,637
or looking at naked women?

9
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,405
You may be in the wrong place.

10
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,940
I'm taking out the trash

11
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:08,208
that would otherwise
be left to putrefy.

12
00:02:08,243 --> 00:02:10,310
There is a legal system for that.

13
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:12,412
If it worked as well
as you think it does,

14
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:14,047
I wouldn't be so busy.

15
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:17,083
I'm just gonna get
a swab from your cheek.

16
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,789
You do this for a living?

17
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:27,559
Well, I hate it, but I get it...

18
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:28,827
what you do.

19
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,061
But what I don't understand

20
00:02:31,096 --> 00:02:33,029
are the blood slides.

21
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:34,297
They're trophies.

22
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:35,898
They're like Speltzer's earrings.

23
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm nothing like Speltzer.

24
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,371
My bosses at the club,

25
00:02:44,406 --> 00:02:46,606
they ordered me to get close to you.

26
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:48,508
These men are dangerous.

27
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,644
I-I can't go back to them
with nothing.

28
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:54,580
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

29
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:06,224
- He's gone.
- Motherfucker...

30
00:03:06,258 --> 00:03:07,258
He has a girl in here.

31
00:03:07,293 --> 00:03:09,995
We have to find her.

32
00:03:10,029 --> 00:03:13,197
She's dead.

33
00:03:22,473 --> 00:03:23,707
Just when it seems like

34
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,875
Deb and I are making progress,

35
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:27,444
we take a left turn.

36
00:03:27,478 --> 00:03:30,313
I showed her a monster, Ray Speltzer.

37
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:33,749
The killer who chased his victim
through a maze.

38
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:36,085
I could have prevented that murder.

39
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:39,988
And Deb accepts that.

40
00:03:40,022 --> 00:03:42,190
But she hasn't accepted me--

41
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:46,561
what I am.

42
00:03:46,595 --> 00:03:49,697
And I'm not sure she ever will.

43
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,642
Yep.

44
00:04:12,818 --> 00:04:14,218
I'm getting nothing.

45
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:15,720
You?

46
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,055
No.

47
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,158
That maze man--he's good.

48
00:04:20,193 --> 00:04:22,961
He knows what he's doing.

49
00:04:22,995 --> 00:04:24,663
My hat's off to any killer good enough

50
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,132
not to leave any DNA behind
at a murder scene.

51
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,268
Plenty of his DNA
in this place though.

52
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,804
Well, if this cemetery was his office,

53
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,974
it's like this place was
his break room.

54
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,811
Something was here.

55
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,381
Something special,
like a trophy maybe?

56
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,749
From one of his victims.

57
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,485
Killers hate to leave
their trophies behind.

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,521
Well, that means Speltzer
stopped by here

59
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:50,655
after he killed that girl.

60
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,692
But there's none of her DNA here.

61
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,328
No blood, no fibers, no hair.

62
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:59,832
No reception.

63
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,444
Speltzer is loose in the world,

64
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:13,846
and Deb will do everything
in her power to find him.

65
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:15,081
But will she and I be able

66
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,850
to find our way back to each other?

67
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:37,837
Deb...

68
00:05:37,872 --> 00:05:40,874
will you...

69
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:47,214
Will you be mine?

70
00:06:50,812 --> 00:06:51,946
Morning.

71
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,981
Coffee.
Now.

72
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,795
- Rita...
- Another left turn.

73
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,297
Trinity killed her.

74
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:13,367
Yes.

75
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:15,302
- Yes.
- Why?

76
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:18,572
She didn't fit the pattern at all.

77
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:22,075
Because I was coming after him.

78
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,043
So while we were hunting Trinity,

79
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:25,645
you were too.

80
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,014
I figured out who he was
before you did.

81
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,683
And didn't help us fucking get him?

82
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:32,185
He knew who I was, where I lived,

83
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,554
that I had a family.

84
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,989
I was trying to protect them.

85
00:07:36,024 --> 00:07:38,425
You wanted to fucking kill him.

86
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,028
And I did.

87
00:07:41,062 --> 00:07:44,031
When?

88
00:07:44,065 --> 00:07:45,599
He's dead.
That's what matters.

89
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:46,867
But when?

90
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:49,570
I took care of him.

91
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:51,239
Did you love her?

92
00:07:51,273 --> 00:07:53,074
- Why would you ask me that?
- Because I suddenly

93
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,276
have no idea what's the truth

94
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,480
and what's a fucking lie
with you anymore.

95
00:07:58,514 --> 00:07:59,681
I loved her.

96
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:01,416
If you were so concerned
about your family,

97
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,185
then why were you going after Trinity?

98
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,387
Is that what a loving husband does?

99
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:06,989
Are you even capable of love?

100
00:08:07,023 --> 00:08:11,426
I love you.

101
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,894
How?

102
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:15,797
How can you love me
and also love to--

103
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:19,401
It's how I've lived my whole life.

104
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:21,470
Before the moment
you walked into that church,

105
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:25,541
did you ever question
the way I felt about you?

106
00:08:25,576 --> 00:08:27,743
- Why is it any different now?
- Why?

107
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:31,313
Jesus, Dexter.

108
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,452
Morgan.

109
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:37,720
Okay.

110
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:43,659
It was Batista.
They found Speltzer.

111
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:47,430
A security guard spotted him
at the scrapyard,

112
00:08:47,464 --> 00:08:49,465
and he had the good sense
not to try and be a hero.

113
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:51,667
It took four officers
to take Speltzer down.

114
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:52,868
He put up one hell of a fight.

115
00:08:52,902 --> 00:08:54,102
They came close to shooting him.

116
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:55,770
If Speltzer had a weapon,
they would've.

117
00:08:55,805 --> 00:08:57,105
Speltzer is a weapon.

118
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,273
He was mine.

119
00:08:58,307 --> 00:08:59,974
He hasn't asked for a lawyer yet.

120
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:00,975
This is your one shot.

121
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,677
A confession is our only shot.

122
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:04,412
He was wearing a mask
when he came at me,

123
00:09:04,446 --> 00:09:05,846
so I couldn't make an I.D.
that would stick.

124
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,948
I can't believe his DNA wasn't
at the crime scene.

125
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:09,616
Masuka and I went over it twice.

126
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:10,918
Yeah, Dexter and I,

127
00:09:10,952 --> 00:09:12,920
we checked Speltzer's
mausoleum man-cave

128
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:14,655
for evidence of his victim there,

129
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,190
but no luck.

130
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:17,592
I mean, Dexter and I
can't make evidence appear,

131
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:18,726
you know.

132
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:19,827
If you don't get a confession,

133
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:21,329
you won't get Speltzer.

134
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:22,997
Are you two ready?

135
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:25,233
Fuck, yes.

136
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:30,304
That's Dexter Morgan.

137
00:09:30,338 --> 00:09:32,540
His face.
It looks familiar.

138
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:35,443
I put everything Jurg
dug up on Morgan in there.

139
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:36,710
He's not a cop.

140
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:39,180
He's a lab rat.
Blood splatter.

141
00:09:39,214 --> 00:09:40,448
It's spatter.

142
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,150
- Blood spatter.
- Whatever.

143
00:09:43,185 --> 00:09:45,052
He's from Miami.
Normal guy.

144
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:47,321
Except his wife was murdered
by a serial killer

145
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:49,155
a few years back.

146
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,857
The man we killed on the boat?

147
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,192
Louis Greene.

148
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:57,763
He was an intern for Miami Metro.

149
00:09:57,798 --> 00:10:01,133
The boat's owner, this Dexter Morgan.

150
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:08,506
He works for Miami Metro too.

151
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,041
Viktor's death--

152
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:12,344
is it payback for killing
that detective?

153
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,213
Viktor fucked us real good here.

154
00:10:14,247 --> 00:10:16,182
Of all the people he could've shot,

155
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,217
it had to be a fucking cop.

156
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:19,885
So it's Viktor's fault he's dead?

157
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,420
Uh, yeah.

158
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,522
He was a loose cannon.
Never listened.

159
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:24,890
At least not to me.

160
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:27,393
Everything was going great
until he showed up in Miami.

161
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:30,530
Viktor was a good man.

162
00:10:30,564 --> 00:10:32,365
He was loyal.

163
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,467
He was committed.

164
00:10:34,502 --> 00:10:38,338
And he was here to do
what you couldn't.

165
00:10:38,373 --> 00:10:41,809
Keep the Colombians from taking
over our traffic!

166
00:10:47,382 --> 00:10:50,684
Fuck.

167
00:10:50,719 --> 00:10:53,754
Here we go again.

168
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:02,896
Good afternoon, everyone.
I'm Detective Quinn.

169
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:05,032
I'll be your official
pain in the ass for the day.

170
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:06,600
Could we get that music turned off?

171
00:11:06,634 --> 00:11:08,068
Ladies, to the left,

172
00:11:08,102 --> 00:11:09,369
customers to the right.

173
00:11:09,404 --> 00:11:11,405
Keep it behind the bar.

174
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:14,508
Ma'am, I need you to go ahead
and stand over there.

175
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:15,576
Officer.

176
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,811
It's detective.

177
00:11:16,845 --> 00:11:20,014
Detective Quinn.

178
00:11:21,484 --> 00:11:24,219
Do not tell me you are fucking her.

179
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:26,754
No.
What makes you think that?

180
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:31,125
You're not the only one
who's a detective.

181
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,693
You really think a stripper's
a good idea?

182
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:38,065
No, it's a horrible idea.

183
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,335
Seriously, how long
is this gonna go on?

184
00:11:41,369 --> 00:11:43,404
I'm thinking every day

185
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:45,706
until we lock up
Mike Anderson's shooter.

186
00:11:47,308 --> 00:11:48,575
Or you could say a number,

187
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,777
and it'll be just like old times.

188
00:11:50,812 --> 00:11:52,846
You know, leave your car unlocked,

189
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,081
you'll find some cash,

190
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:56,183
maybe some blow.

191
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,618
And all this goes away.

192
00:11:58,653 --> 00:12:01,422
I don't know
what you're talking about.

193
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:04,459
Get the fuck out of my face.

194
00:12:13,635 --> 00:12:15,436
None of this makes any sense.

195
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,838
Viktor's dead.
They got him!

196
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:21,175
Not everyone
at Miami Metro knows this.

197
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,145
Otherwise, they wouldn't be here.

198
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,683
Maybe this Morgan and Greene
were working alone.

199
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:30,585
Well, why the fuck would
these two assholes

200
00:12:30,619 --> 00:12:31,653
cover up Viktor's murder?

201
00:12:31,687 --> 00:12:33,621
I believe Dexter Morgan knows why.

202
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:34,656
Just say the word.

203
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,857
I'll take him out.

204
00:12:35,891 --> 00:12:36,858
No.

205
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:38,126
I want to talk to him.

206
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:39,527
Talk?

207
00:12:39,562 --> 00:12:40,962
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

208
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:43,898
We got two boats waiting
to drop off our supply,

209
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:47,302
even though we can't move
what we already have.

210
00:12:47,336 --> 00:12:51,473
We are bleeding money.

211
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:01,384
The bartender, Alex.
One of ours, isn't he?

212
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:05,722
Yeah.

213
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,758
So let's give them what they want.

214
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:13,931
For my money,

215
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:18,002
four on one is not
really a fair fight.

216
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:19,904
I did a little boxing myself
back in the day.

217
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:21,739
I didn't take on four cops,

218
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:24,375
but I, you know--
I held my own.

219
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:29,480
You don't want to chitchat.
I get that.

220
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:31,449
Here's the thing though.

221
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,718
My lieutenant is gonna come in here

222
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:36,387
and say that she saw you at the maze

223
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:39,490
where that waitress died.

224
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:40,692
I don't know
what you're talking about.

225
00:13:40,726 --> 00:13:43,528
Right. Guy like you
was probably at the gym.

226
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:45,530
But she's a woman.

227
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,800
They get shit wrong all the time.

228
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:52,604
And this one, man, she's my boss.

229
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,640
If you can believe that.

230
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:56,408
I have to fucking answer

231
00:13:56,442 --> 00:13:59,078
to her skinny ass every day.

232
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:02,047
And she's always squawking
at me, you know.

233
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:03,682
Her beak goes "Squawk, squawk,

234
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,285
squawk, squawk, squawk,
squawk, squawk."

235
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,954
To tell you the truth, I envy you.

236
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:11,257
I've been wanting to pop my lieutenant

237
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:12,825
in that beak of hers for years.

238
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:19,298
She's dying to get a shot at you.

239
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:23,068
Should we let her?
Could be fun.

240
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:25,905
Right?

241
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,542
All right.

242
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,417
Nice job in there.

243
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:39,152
He's all ready for you.

244
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:40,687
Deb.

245
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:42,455
Good luck.

246
00:14:45,193 --> 00:14:48,294
He was mine, but Deb needs this
more than me.

247
00:14:48,329 --> 00:14:50,630
And she needs to get him her way.

248
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,532
Remember me?

249
00:14:52,566 --> 00:14:54,367
I saw you just the other night.

250
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:57,471
That is some maze that you built.

251
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:01,275
What is it for, Ray?

252
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,744
Are you sure you don't remember me?

253
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:10,351
Maybe I'm not pretty enough.

254
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:13,254
Your mom sure was pretty.

255
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,857
She died a few years ago, right?

256
00:15:15,891 --> 00:15:20,361
Cast a long shadow, I bet.

257
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:21,863
Hard for any girl
to measure up to those looks,

258
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:25,401
but you keep trying, don't you?

259
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:28,871
What do you think about
the girls that go home with you?

260
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:30,139
That they're stupid?

261
00:15:30,173 --> 00:15:32,341
Easy?

262
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:35,677
That they're whores?

263
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:37,647
They'd have to be, right?

264
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:39,515
To go home with you,

265
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,485
take their clothes off for you.

266
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,721
Girls like that are vulgar.

267
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:49,692
But girls like that,
sure do look like your mom.

268
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,428
So I have to wonder...

269
00:15:51,462 --> 00:15:53,429
Your mom was so pretty.

270
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:55,832
She probably had
a lot of admirers, right?

271
00:15:55,866 --> 00:15:57,067
Men who would go home with her

272
00:15:57,101 --> 00:16:01,571
and watch her take her clothes off.

273
00:16:01,606 --> 00:16:04,641
And then take her any way
that they wanted her?

274
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:06,876
Shut up.

275
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:12,081
There were many ways
to break a body down.

276
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:15,618
You could hear it, couldn't you?

277
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:17,654
You could hear her through
those thin walls

278
00:16:17,688 --> 00:16:19,956
that the two of you shared.

279
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:23,627
You could hear how much
she loved getting fucked

280
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:25,062
by all those men.

281
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,130
You could hear her kissing them,

282
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:29,833
all the things that
she might do with her mouth,

283
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:32,635
that same mouth
she would kiss you with.

284
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,305
But be honest, Ray.

285
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,343
You kind of liked it, didn't you?

286
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:42,445
Weren't you kind of wishing

287
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,246
that it was you inside her?

288
00:16:45,782 --> 00:16:47,883
I should've killed you like
I killed that other bitch!

289
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,652
Go to hell.

290
00:16:49,686 --> 00:16:52,922
We got him.

291
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:01,464
Way to go, lieutenant.

292
00:17:01,498 --> 00:17:03,966
- All right.
- Good job.

293
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,070
Hey, Deb.

294
00:17:08,105 --> 00:17:09,138
Jamie said she was good

295
00:17:09,172 --> 00:17:10,973
to watch Harrison till late tonight

296
00:17:11,008 --> 00:17:13,976
if you want
to grab a drink or something.

297
00:17:15,379 --> 00:17:20,449
I thought you'd be
in the mood to celebrate.

298
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:22,117
I'm really glad we got Speltzer.

299
00:17:22,152 --> 00:17:24,119
But celebrate?
No.

300
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:27,523
Melanie Garrett is still dead.

301
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:29,492
But you got Speltzer.

302
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:30,992
He'll never hurt anyone again.

303
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,527
Well, outside of prison.

304
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:36,298
Dexter.

305
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:38,500
I've been thinking a lot
about Rita--

306
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,702
about how she died.

307
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:43,672
She died because of you.

308
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:46,508
Because you were selfish.

309
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,277
You have a son.

310
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,145
Harrison is three years old.

311
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,513
Someone needs to protect him.

312
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,681
I do.

313
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:57,452
Someone needs to protect him from you.

314
00:17:57,487 --> 00:17:59,788
He could go live with Astor and Cody,

315
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:02,057
with their grandparents in Orlando.

316
00:18:02,091 --> 00:18:04,593
I am a good father.
I am the right person--

317
00:18:04,627 --> 00:18:09,497
the only person who can
and should raise my son.

318
00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:11,066
Who, like me, lost his mother.

319
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,068
It is not fair of you

320
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:16,805
to expose a child to your life...

321
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,842
choices.

322
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:23,312
You have to decide!
Your desires or--

323
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:24,313
No, I don't.

324
00:18:24,347 --> 00:18:25,413
You said it yourself, Dexter,

325
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:26,648
that you can't stop,

326
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:28,483
that you don't want to stop.

327
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:30,819
And if you keep doing this,

328
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:33,588
you're like a fucking magnet.

329
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:37,759
Bad shit is gonna find you.

330
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:39,728
And if that happens, I'll handle it.

331
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:46,602
What if you had been
three minutes later

332
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:48,670
to Speltzer's fucking maze?

333
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:49,771
But I wasn't.

334
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:54,375
You were too late for Rita.

335
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,478
I should have killed Trinity
the first time I saw him.

336
00:18:57,513 --> 00:18:58,779
That's the mistake I made.

337
00:18:58,814 --> 00:18:59,813
That's the mistake that you made?

338
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:00,981
Yes!

339
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,649
And I will never,
from this moment on--

340
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,051
Do you hear me?

341
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,053
I will never ever
make that mistake again.

342
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:08,254
It is not in your control.

343
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:12,291
Everything is in my control.

344
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:24,202
I am not giving up my son.

345
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,390
Mr. Sirko.

346
00:19:45,424 --> 00:19:47,359
George.

347
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:48,660
I wasn't expecting visitors.

348
00:19:48,694 --> 00:19:49,894
That's all right.

349
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:51,162
We don't stand on ceremony here.

350
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:52,631
Have a seat, Alex.

351
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:54,332
You have a beautiful family.

352
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:56,968
Thank you.

353
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,136
That is why I came here.

354
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,739
They are still in Kursk.

355
00:20:01,774 --> 00:20:04,409
Your son and daughter,
what are their names?

356
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:09,481
My son's Zakhary and my girl,
her name's Yulia.

357
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:11,483
They're twins, yes?
How old?

358
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:14,186
Five.
Their birthday's in April.

359
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,821
Wow, five.

360
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:18,489
That's the best age, huh?

361
00:20:18,524 --> 00:20:22,560
Learning to read, walking,
seeing the world,

362
00:20:22,594 --> 00:20:24,928
and yet, they still want to be held.

363
00:20:24,963 --> 00:20:27,264
You're probably wondering why
I stopped by.

364
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:29,733
Well, you see--

365
00:20:29,767 --> 00:20:31,001
Tell me...

366
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:33,637
How much money do you send back
to Kursk each month?

367
00:20:33,671 --> 00:20:35,639
From your job at the Fox Hole?

368
00:20:35,674 --> 00:20:38,376
$750.

369
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,479
I take out only my rent, my food,

370
00:20:41,513 --> 00:20:43,381
some money for my car.

371
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,351
A sacrifice for you, I'm sure.

372
00:20:45,385 --> 00:20:46,952
Yeah, but still,

373
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,488
it's not very much.

374
00:20:49,522 --> 00:20:54,292
What if your family could have
a lot of money?

375
00:20:54,327 --> 00:20:56,461
Security.

376
00:20:56,495 --> 00:20:59,297
And college for Zakhary and Yulia?

377
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:01,199
You'd want that for them.

378
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:04,436
I would give anything for them.

379
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,038
That pleases me.

380
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:10,276
Because that is why
I came by here today.

381
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,344
To ask you a favor, Alex.

382
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,012
Yes, of course.
Anything.

383
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,749
I have a problem.

384
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:19,919
One of my men killed a police officer,

385
00:21:19,953 --> 00:21:22,421
and I have
to give the police a suspect

386
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:23,922
so they'll stop harassing us.

387
00:21:23,957 --> 00:21:25,691
And that suspect is you.

388
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:29,929
But I didn't kill anyone.

389
00:21:29,963 --> 00:21:31,364
Sure, you did.

390
00:21:31,398 --> 00:21:33,799
I want you to write a note.

391
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,067
Pen, paper?

392
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:42,306
This is what I want you to write.

393
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,575
"Kaja.

394
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:49,480
"I cannot live with what I have done.

395
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:52,150
I'm very sorry."

396
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,423
I will take care of your family now.

397
00:21:57,457 --> 00:22:01,995
Zakhary and Yulia
will want for nothing.

398
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:06,566
That's for you.

399
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,101
It's the gun that killed
the police officer.

400
00:22:08,135 --> 00:22:12,772
What do I do with it?

401
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:16,076
Bang.

402
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:21,048
Look at your children's faces.

403
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:23,417
They're looking at you.

404
00:22:23,451 --> 00:22:25,486
Wanting you to give them the best life

405
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,188
this world has to offer.

406
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,825
You will do this for them.

407
00:22:30,859 --> 00:22:34,295
And if I don't?

408
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,863
We'll kill you anyway.

409
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:41,035
And throw your wife
and fucking kids in the river.

410
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:42,303
No need for threats.

411
00:22:42,337 --> 00:22:44,405
We're all friends here.

412
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,710
But I think you understand
the situation.

413
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:08,829
You won't feel a thing.

414
00:23:11,032 --> 00:23:14,268
It'll be quick,

415
00:23:14,302 --> 00:23:16,571
like turning off a light.

416
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:40,094
For my family?

417
00:23:54,942 --> 00:23:57,177
Hannah McKay.

418
00:23:57,211 --> 00:23:58,812
She spent six years in juvie

419
00:23:58,846 --> 00:24:01,615
after pleading guilty to being
Wayne Randall's accomplice.

420
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:05,518
She always claimed she was just
another one of his victims.

421
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:09,088
Wayne called her the Robin
to his Batman,

422
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:10,956
but with better legs.

423
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,293
Dexter Morgan.

424
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,728
You look a little lost.

425
00:24:15,762 --> 00:24:18,298
Well, I haven't been inside
a police station

426
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:19,732
in 15 years.

427
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,902
Still smells the same,

428
00:24:21,936 --> 00:24:24,304
like fast food and sweat.

429
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:28,209
Well, hospitality isn't
exactly our main concern.

430
00:24:28,243 --> 00:24:30,545
I heard the sheriff's
department found the body

431
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:32,146
of one of Wayne's victims.

432
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,747
Yeah, they went back one last time

433
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:36,617
after Wayne... died.

434
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:40,821
And expanded the perimeter.

435
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,022
Is that what you're doing here?

436
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:45,125
To help us find
the other bodies Wayne buried?

437
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,863
My lawyer said it was for the best.

438
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:51,899
There's a rumor going around

439
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,335
that you were the last person
to talk to Wayne

440
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:58,305
before he...

441
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,342
died.

442
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,377
His last words were about you.

443
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:06,680
Oh.

444
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:07,948
He said something about

445
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:11,018
every day being like
an unwrapped present.

446
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:13,954
Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:18,926
I remember when he got
that fortune from a cookie.

448
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:22,864
You two didn't stay in contact?

449
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,701
Too painful.

450
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:30,206
Where were you and Wayne going anyway?

451
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,507
Was there a plan?

452
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:34,043
Not much of one at first.

453
00:25:34,078 --> 00:25:36,713
We were just trying to get out
of Clopton, Alabama,

454
00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:38,148
which isn't even a town.

455
00:25:38,183 --> 00:25:40,284
It's an intersection and a cemetery.

456
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:43,053
But somewhere around Sarasota,

457
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:44,822
a plan did begin to form.

458
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:46,891
Argentina.

459
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:49,159
We were gonna go find
a farm in Argentina

460
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:50,828
and settle down.

461
00:25:52,363 --> 00:25:53,730
What?

462
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:56,032
We were living on farms in Alabama.

463
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,034
Like, somehow,
it would all be so different

464
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:02,072
in South America.

465
00:26:04,041 --> 00:26:06,977
Do you miss him?

466
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:11,314
I miss the way I felt with him
on the road.

467
00:26:11,348 --> 00:26:12,949
That life was just beginning,

468
00:26:12,983 --> 00:26:15,685
and that anything--

469
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:18,988
anything was possible.

470
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,459
You know the feeling?

471
00:26:28,764 --> 00:26:30,733
No.

472
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,071
It's my lawyer.

473
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:39,074
I'm sure he's wondering
where I got lost to.

474
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,160
We have a big problem.

475
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:06,236
What's the problem?

476
00:27:06,271 --> 00:27:07,371
Watch the Miranda.

477
00:27:07,405 --> 00:27:09,073
Put him on the fucking car!

478
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:11,575
You know how this goes.

479
00:27:11,609 --> 00:27:13,744
If you want an attorney,
we'll get one for you.

480
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:15,745
Even if can't afford one.

481
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,447
Do you understand your rights?

482
00:27:17,482 --> 00:27:20,283
Huh?
Do you understand?

483
00:27:21,485 --> 00:27:23,886
- Say yes.
- Did you guys see that?

484
00:27:23,921 --> 00:27:26,322
Looks like a "yes" to me.

485
00:27:26,356 --> 00:27:29,025
Fucking cock sucker.

486
00:27:30,094 --> 00:27:31,694
They never got a verbal confirmation

487
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:32,996
that Speltzer understood his rights.

488
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,997
No.

489
00:27:34,031 --> 00:27:34,998
But Speltzer fucking nodded.

490
00:27:35,032 --> 00:27:36,866
He didn't say, "Yes."

491
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,135
And at Speltzer's arraignment
this morning,

492
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:40,770
his P.D. was able
to make the case--

493
00:27:40,804 --> 00:27:41,871
Don't.

494
00:27:41,906 --> 00:27:43,006
That because Speltzer

495
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,006
at one point knocked unconscious,

496
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,475
it is entirely possible

497
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:47,644
that he did not understand his rights,

498
00:27:47,678 --> 00:27:50,147
that it wasn't a nod, that
it was a temporary blackout.

499
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:51,915
And the judge fucking bought that?

500
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:55,519
The judge threw his confession
out of court.

501
00:27:55,553 --> 00:27:56,553
He walked.

502
00:27:56,587 --> 00:27:58,589
- When?
- Two hours ago.

503
00:27:58,623 --> 00:27:59,757
Motherfucker.

504
00:27:59,791 --> 00:28:01,959
And apparently, Speltzer's planning

505
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:03,561
to file a lawsuit against us.

506
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:05,930
Use of excessive force?

507
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:08,300
I don't believe this.

508
00:28:08,334 --> 00:28:11,403
So all that's left to do is--
is what?

509
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:13,438
Wait around till
he kills someone else?

510
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:15,107
There's nothing else we can do.

511
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:17,276
But there is something I can do.

512
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,644
Fuck that.

513
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:21,480
Fuck all of this.

514
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:31,757
The bartender from the Fox Hole

515
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:35,327
blew his brains out last night.

516
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:38,397
Why don't they wear uniforms?

517
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:41,833
There's no respect.

518
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:45,104
You'd never know they were police.

519
00:28:54,848 --> 00:28:57,515
Unless you knew
who you were looking for.

520
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:10,795
We got a single gunshot wound
to the right temple.

521
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:13,565
What appears to be GSR
on the right hand.

522
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,833
It was through and through,
based on the height

523
00:29:15,868 --> 00:29:17,268
of the bullet in the wall.

524
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:19,103
Alex was sitting at the table

525
00:29:19,138 --> 00:29:20,638
when he put his gun to his head.

526
00:29:20,672 --> 00:29:22,306
We got a White Russian on ice.

527
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:23,908
Very funny.

528
00:29:23,942 --> 00:29:27,245
I'll have you know I have
a major following on Twitter.

529
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,014
This gun is a 9-mil.

530
00:29:30,048 --> 00:29:32,884
Same type of weapon used
on Mike Anderson.

531
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:34,719
I'll go to ballistics
and run this through.

532
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:37,522
And confirm this turd is our shooter.

533
00:29:39,024 --> 00:29:41,993
But I know that Viktor
killed Mike Anderson.

534
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:44,763
Why would Alex take the fall for him?

535
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:46,765
Unless there's someone at the club

536
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,299
who wants the investigation to end

537
00:29:48,334 --> 00:29:50,535
as much as Miami Metro does.

538
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:53,172
Quinn, read that note again.

539
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:54,940
"Kaja, I cannot live with what
I have done.

540
00:29:54,974 --> 00:29:56,908
I am very sorry."

541
00:29:56,942 --> 00:29:58,910
- Sorry to Kaja?
- Yeah.

542
00:29:58,944 --> 00:30:00,545
I mean, it makes sense.

543
00:30:00,579 --> 00:30:03,181
It's obvious that this Alex
Dubrozny had feelings for her,

544
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:04,750
and she was in love with Tony.

545
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:06,451
Which probably didn't sit
very well with him.

546
00:30:06,486 --> 00:30:08,720
So he kills her, kills Tony.

547
00:30:08,755 --> 00:30:10,422
And Mike was just
in the wrong fucking place

548
00:30:10,456 --> 00:30:11,423
at the wrong fucking time.

549
00:30:11,457 --> 00:30:12,724
I mean, this guy still has pictures up

550
00:30:12,758 --> 00:30:14,393
of his kids, his wife.

551
00:30:14,427 --> 00:30:15,494
Yeah.

552
00:30:15,528 --> 00:30:16,896
He probably feels horrible

553
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,431
having to look at her face
all fucking day.

554
00:30:18,465 --> 00:30:21,067
That's just it.
He doesn't have to.

555
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:22,702
Take the pictures down.
Put them away.

556
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,437
Leaving the pictures up
just tells me that

557
00:30:24,472 --> 00:30:25,438
he still cares for them.

558
00:30:25,472 --> 00:30:26,539
He's a guy.

559
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:27,573
Once something's up on the wall,

560
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:28,975
why bother even taking it down?

561
00:30:29,009 --> 00:30:30,276
- I don't know.
- What don't you know?

562
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,278
I don't know if it all adds up.

563
00:30:32,312 --> 00:30:34,213
Well, look.
We'll talk to the neighbors.

564
00:30:34,247 --> 00:30:35,648
See if they saw anyone coming in,

565
00:30:35,682 --> 00:30:37,216
or out of Alex's apartment last night

566
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,284
if it'll make you happy.

567
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,552
It's not about happy.

568
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,154
Angel.

569
00:30:41,188 --> 00:30:43,289
Angel, this is our fucking guy.

570
00:30:47,528 --> 00:30:51,064
Everyone yearns
for clarity, for closure.

571
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:55,802
But is that ever really possible?

572
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:00,973
Jamie?

573
00:31:01,008 --> 00:31:03,342
Harrison's outgrown half his toys.

574
00:31:03,377 --> 00:31:05,011
I know we had to go through them.

575
00:31:05,045 --> 00:31:06,212
I just didn't know
it was gonna be now.

576
00:31:06,247 --> 00:31:07,314
I'm almost done.

577
00:31:07,348 --> 00:31:09,350
I wanted to do it while he's asleep.

578
00:31:09,384 --> 00:31:10,518
Anything we're unsure about,

579
00:31:10,552 --> 00:31:13,454
we can put in
the keep-for-now pile.

580
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:18,559
What's the other pile?

581
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:22,397
Trash.

582
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,100
You put Lamby in the trash?

583
00:31:25,134 --> 00:31:27,736
Lamby smells like pee.

584
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:31,473
And Harrison hasn't slept with Lamby

585
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,608
in more than a year.

586
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:35,778
It used to be he couldn't
go to sleep without it.

587
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,213
Aw, I remember.

588
00:31:37,247 --> 00:31:39,348
Keep?

589
00:31:39,383 --> 00:31:41,584
Nah.

590
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:43,587
Yeah, a lot of kids sleep
with security blankets

591
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:44,955
when they're little,

592
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:47,124
but once they start socializing,

593
00:31:47,158 --> 00:31:49,593
you know, learning how
to be part of a group,

594
00:31:49,627 --> 00:31:51,294
they don't need it.

595
00:31:51,329 --> 00:31:53,697
And Harrison, because he's a genius,

596
00:31:53,731 --> 00:31:57,567
hit this milestone early.

597
00:31:57,601 --> 00:31:59,569
He was so small.

598
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:03,173
Lamby was a gift from Rita's mother

599
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,741
when he was born.

600
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:07,043
Maybe we should keep it for Harrison.

601
00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:10,747
For Harrison.
Of course.

602
00:32:20,157 --> 00:32:24,427
Some toys are more difficult
than others to part with.

603
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:47,583
Speltzer's already back at work,
digging graves.

604
00:32:49,453 --> 00:32:52,087
He should start by digging his own.

605
00:32:57,093 --> 00:32:59,861
Miami Metro impounded Speltzer's
little <i>Pied-a-RV</i>

606
00:32:59,896 --> 00:33:01,196
when he was arrested,

607
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,431
but they had to give it back
once he was set free.

608
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,570
Ray's been juicing--

609
00:33:08,604 --> 00:33:11,873
at least he doesn't mind needles.

610
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,475
I can hide up here,

611
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:14,876
wait for Speltzer to come home.

612
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:16,845
I'll use the RV as my kill room

613
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:20,248
and transportation
to get rid of Ray's body.

614
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,724
And his trophies.

615
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:12,335
I'm still alive,

616
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,272
but I don't think I'm going
to like the reason why.

617
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,981
Speltzer couldn't have
done all of this in a day.

618
00:34:25,015 --> 00:34:28,284
Is this place his masterpiece?

619
00:34:36,126 --> 00:34:37,493
I don't run.

620
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:40,930
I make people run.

621
00:35:01,253 --> 00:35:02,720
However, I do run

622
00:35:02,754 --> 00:35:05,022
if there's a bull
coming after me with an ax.

623
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:36,546
You should really try taking
a shower once in a while.

624
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:49,157
Where are you?

625
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,936
Speltzer keeps forcing me down
to the next floor.

626
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,470
So if he wants me to go down,

627
00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:04,074
what happens if I go up?

628
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:50,287
He knows my face now.

629
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:52,289
If I want a rematch,

630
00:37:52,323 --> 00:37:54,090
I'm gonna have to be smarter.

631
00:37:56,994 --> 00:37:58,295
To take Speltzer down,

632
00:37:58,329 --> 00:38:01,097
I have to make sure
I have nothing to lose.

633
00:38:04,635 --> 00:38:07,870
Mmm, yummy.

634
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:10,139
Whoa, Harrison's only going to Orlando

635
00:38:10,174 --> 00:38:11,641
for a few weeks, Dexter.

636
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:13,076
Yeah, I know.

637
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,578
He's gonna be fine.

638
00:38:15,612 --> 00:38:17,113
All he'll want to do
is follow Cody around.

639
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:18,882
Thanks for driving him up.

640
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,517
I actually might spend
a few days there,

641
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:22,586
see what trouble I can get into.

642
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,088
Knock yourself out.

643
00:38:24,122 --> 00:38:28,058
Thanks.
I'll take these down to the car.

644
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:36,966
Astor and Cody are excited to see you.

645
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,301
I want you to be good for
your grandma and grandpa, okay?

646
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,970
I'm not sending Harrison to Orlando

647
00:38:42,004 --> 00:38:44,105
because Deb asked me to,

648
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:47,274
but because Speltzer
is a problem I need to solve.

649
00:38:47,308 --> 00:38:50,811
Once I do, Harrison will
come home where he belongs.

650
00:38:50,845 --> 00:38:53,314
You mean more to me than...

651
00:38:53,348 --> 00:38:55,516
Pizza!

652
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,051
That's right.

653
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,086
Pizza.

654
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:01,756
Let's go.

655
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:34,685
I will avenge your death.

656
00:40:38,624 --> 00:40:41,859
Everything I do...

657
00:40:41,894 --> 00:40:44,863
is for you.

658
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:05,150
Deb, you okay?

659
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:08,153
Ye-yep.

660
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:10,155
I want to get back to the station

661
00:41:10,189 --> 00:41:12,790
and finish up the paperwork
on Mike's shooter.

662
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:15,326
I'll be there in a minute.

663
00:41:25,637 --> 00:41:27,971
Motherfucker.

664
00:41:34,111 --> 00:41:36,646
You impotent fuck.

665
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:38,849
You got some mouth on you.

666
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:40,317
The fuck are you doing here?
Haven't you done enough?

667
00:41:40,351 --> 00:41:42,252
Oh, I'm just getting started.

668
00:41:42,286 --> 00:41:44,487
You fucking motherfucking cocksucker!

669
00:41:44,522 --> 00:41:47,056
- All right, all right.
- You fucking piece of shit!

670
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:48,257
Get your shit together.

671
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:51,194
You're so easy, just like the others.

672
00:41:51,228 --> 00:41:53,964
Get the fuck out of here.
Come on.

673
00:41:53,998 --> 00:41:55,598
Fuck you up.

674
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:58,901
I'll you see around.

675
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:12,448
Batista called.

676
00:42:14,217 --> 00:42:15,251
I'm sure he did.

677
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:18,254
Wha--what happened?

678
00:42:19,923 --> 00:42:22,658
I fucking lost my mind.

679
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:26,696
I saw Speltzer at Melanie's funeral.

680
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:30,634
Fuckin' smiling
at the hearse, and--

681
00:42:30,669 --> 00:42:32,937
What'd you do?

682
00:42:32,971 --> 00:42:34,105
I fucking attacked him!

683
00:42:34,139 --> 00:42:37,008
I wanted to fucking kill him.

684
00:42:38,744 --> 00:42:41,546
Fuck you.

685
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,747
Is that why you came here?

686
00:42:42,781 --> 00:42:44,349
To prove some fucking point
that everybody

687
00:42:44,383 --> 00:42:46,118
wants someone dead?

688
00:42:46,152 --> 00:42:50,822
I came here to see how you are.

689
00:42:50,857 --> 00:42:54,092
That's all.

690
00:42:56,028 --> 00:42:59,030
I'm just fucking great.

691
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:15,179
Is this ever gonna get easier?

692
00:43:15,213 --> 00:43:17,481
Nothing's really
all that different, Deb.

693
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:26,691
The only thing that's changed

694
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:29,627
is now you know more about me.

695
00:43:29,661 --> 00:43:32,664
What I know about you...

696
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:39,370
makes you a completely
different person.

697
00:43:39,404 --> 00:43:41,238
But I'm not.

698
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:45,542
I'm the same person I've always been.

699
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:47,745
Your brother, the same person

700
00:43:47,779 --> 00:43:49,913
who will always be there for you.

701
00:43:57,187 --> 00:44:01,190
Maybe the question is whether
you'll be there for me.

702
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:13,602
I don't know if I can
feel the same way about us.

703
00:44:16,005 --> 00:44:18,373
I do.

704
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:25,747
I do

705
00:44:25,782 --> 00:44:28,784
And I don't too.

706
00:44:56,813 --> 00:44:59,348
Are we sure this Alex Dubrozny guy

707
00:44:59,382 --> 00:45:01,717
shot Mike Anderson?

708
00:45:01,751 --> 00:45:03,452
Why the fuck are you
trying to rattle this?

709
00:45:03,486 --> 00:45:05,187
'Cause it smells like a setup.

710
00:45:05,222 --> 00:45:06,789
And what does a setup smell like?

711
00:45:06,823 --> 00:45:09,058
This bartender had no record
back in Kursk.

712
00:45:09,093 --> 00:45:11,361
Suddenly he decides
to murder three people?

713
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:13,830
Alex had a short fuse,

714
00:45:13,864 --> 00:45:16,066
a broken heart, a loaded gun.

715
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,469
A gun that Masuka confirmed
was the same one used on Mike.

716
00:45:19,503 --> 00:45:22,038
And we got a sweet little suicide note

717
00:45:22,073 --> 00:45:25,309
that helped us solve not just
Mike's murder, but two others.

718
00:45:25,343 --> 00:45:27,945
That's what a setup smells like.

719
00:45:27,979 --> 00:45:30,381
It's all too neat, too easy.

720
00:45:30,415 --> 00:45:32,149
Alex wasn't even on our radar.

721
00:45:32,183 --> 00:45:33,684
Why would he off himself now?

722
00:45:33,718 --> 00:45:37,020
His conscious got to him.

723
00:45:37,054 --> 00:45:38,922
Let's just swing by the club

724
00:45:38,956 --> 00:45:41,424
one last time, ask around.

725
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:43,126
This is Mike we're talking about here.

726
00:45:44,428 --> 00:45:48,531
Fine--
not tonight.

727
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,199
- What's her name?
- Nadia.

728
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:53,336
- The stripper?
- She's a dancer.

729
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,105
Just doesn't keep
a lot of her clothes on.

730
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:56,773
You serious about her?

731
00:45:56,807 --> 00:45:58,308
I don't know what I am about her.

732
00:45:58,343 --> 00:46:01,612
But she was real close
to Kaja and Tony,

733
00:46:01,646 --> 00:46:04,115
and all this is real hard on her.

734
00:46:04,149 --> 00:46:06,284
Oh, I'm so glad
you're there to comfort her.

735
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:08,953
- Come on.
- I'm just jealous.

736
00:46:08,987 --> 00:46:10,254
At least you got someone in your life.

737
00:46:10,288 --> 00:46:12,356
She's got a lot of pretty friends.

738
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:13,924
I'm a twice-divorced
detective

739
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,092
staring down the barrel of retirement.

740
00:46:16,127 --> 00:46:17,427
I'm already a cliche.

741
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:19,596
No need to add fucking
a stripper to that list.

742
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,698
All right, fine.
We'll go by the club tomorrow,

743
00:46:21,732 --> 00:46:23,933
make sure Alex isn't
some patsy for the mob.

744
00:46:23,968 --> 00:46:26,970
Have a good night.

745
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:44,619
Fight or flight.

746
00:46:47,256 --> 00:46:50,258
That's a part of everyone's
lizard brain.

747
00:47:08,747 --> 00:47:12,316
Speltzer may have
a lizard brain like me,

748
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:13,584
but his shortcoming is he doesn't

749
00:47:13,618 --> 00:47:15,686
have much of a human brain.

750
00:47:36,541 --> 00:47:37,774
What the fuck is this?

751
00:47:37,808 --> 00:47:39,776
The end of your run.

752
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:43,779
Get me out of here!

753
00:47:45,015 --> 00:47:47,717
Yell all you want.
No one's gonna hear ya.

754
00:47:47,751 --> 00:47:49,218
Fuck.

755
00:47:49,252 --> 00:47:50,553
Fuck!

756
00:47:50,587 --> 00:47:54,924
Fuck! Fuck!

757
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,559
Feels good.

758
00:47:56,594 --> 00:47:58,729
Fuck!

759
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,233
Normally now is when
I'd slice your cheek

760
00:48:03,268 --> 00:48:05,002
with my scalpel
and get a drop of blood

761
00:48:05,036 --> 00:48:07,905
to remember you by, but I can't risk

762
00:48:07,939 --> 00:48:10,174
anyone finding a blood slide
ever again.

763
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:12,843
You're a fuckin' freak.

764
00:48:12,878 --> 00:48:16,214
I do things different now.

765
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:18,750
The memory of killing you
will have to be enough.

766
00:48:18,784 --> 00:48:21,486
I'm gonna kill you.

767
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:25,423
That would be a twist--

768
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:29,694
and not one that's
gonna happen tonight.

769
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,264
No!

770
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:38,870
You were supposed
to be a way out of the tangle

771
00:48:38,905 --> 00:48:41,539
I was in with my sister,

772
00:48:41,574 --> 00:48:44,810
a thread she could follow
to understand me better,

773
00:48:44,844 --> 00:48:47,979
to accept me, even.

774
00:48:48,014 --> 00:48:51,483
But she and I lost each other.

775
00:48:51,517 --> 00:48:54,786
She almost lost herself,
going after you.

776
00:48:56,723 --> 00:49:01,093
She wanted to catch you
just as much as I did.

777
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:02,761
Who knows, maybe our relationship

778
00:49:02,796 --> 00:49:05,597
can rise from your ashes.

779
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:09,301
No.

780
00:49:09,335 --> 00:49:10,636
No!

781
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:46,639
It's time for everyone to move on.

782
00:50:01,555 --> 00:50:04,558
Good-bye, friends.

783
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:53,609
You came.

784
00:50:53,643 --> 00:50:55,311
I wasn't sure you would.

785
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:58,314
Me neither.

786
00:51:01,518 --> 00:51:05,154
What am I doing here?

787
00:51:05,189 --> 00:51:09,191
Uh, that smoke...

788
00:51:18,801 --> 00:51:21,769
it's Speltzer.

789
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,682
Did you do this for me?

790
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:41,956
No.

791
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:53,135
How do you feel?

792
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:02,578
Glad.

793
00:52:13,055 --> 00:52:16,057
What does that make me?

794
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:24,864
Human.

795
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:53,622
