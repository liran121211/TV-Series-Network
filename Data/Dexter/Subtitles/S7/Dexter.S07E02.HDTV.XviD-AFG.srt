2
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:48,854
Previously, on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:50,295
- Where's your lug wrench at?
- No--

4
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:54,871
We are investigating the homicide

5
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:56,976
of a Miami Metro police officer.

6
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,874
Viktor left on an evening flight.

7
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,947
He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 P.M.,
your time.

8
00:02:02,283 --> 00:02:03,783
What about the dead police officer?

9
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:06,552
- I'll make it go away.
- Good.

10
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:08,053
Hello, Viktor.

11
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:10,289
Is there anything I can do
to keep you from killing me?

12
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:11,957
No.

13
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:15,292
In my game, you can be
the serial killer.

14
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:18,095
I think this is offensive.

15
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:20,763
Who would choose
to be a serial killer?

16
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:22,431
It's a bad idea.

17
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:24,266
Do something else.

18
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,269
Only one person who ever
worked at Miami Metro

19
00:02:27,304 --> 00:02:28,637
ever took blood slides.

20
00:02:28,672 --> 00:02:31,641
Sergeant Doakes,
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

21
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:35,878
What happened was too strong.

22
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:37,414
It got into you too early.

23
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,949
You mustn't ever tell Debra
the truth about yourself.

24
00:02:39,984 --> 00:02:41,885
If you think she's upset now,

25
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,386
that's nothing compared
to how she'd feel

26
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:45,122
if she learned what you are.

27
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,326
Dexter, what the fuck?

28
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:52,229
You said Travis
came at you with a sword.

29
00:02:52,263 --> 00:02:54,164
Where did you get the knives?

30
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:55,565
There was, like, a whole roll of them.

31
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,634
I'm just trying to put this together.

32
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:11,313
Are you a serial killer?

33
00:03:11,347 --> 00:03:13,281
Yes.

34
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:57,390
I've dreaded this moment
my whole life...

35
00:03:57,424 --> 00:04:01,194
but I never pictured it like this.

36
00:04:01,228 --> 00:04:03,663
Don't you fucking touch me.

37
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:07,634
I just want to know you're okay.

38
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:10,070
I am not okay.

39
00:04:10,104 --> 00:04:13,407
I am never gonna fucking be okay.

40
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:16,409
- Just try to take it easy.
- Ohh...

41
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:19,245
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

42
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:24,418
How long have you been doing this?

43
00:04:24,452 --> 00:04:27,421
How long have you been
fucking doing this?

44
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,860
Since I was 20.

45
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:38,766
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter.

46
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:44,373
Those blood slides
that I found in your apartment,

47
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:46,975
they look like the ones
we found in Doakes' car.

48
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,978
Deb...

49
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:51,714
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?

50
00:04:51,748 --> 00:04:54,583
This is not the place
to talk about this.

51
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,686
Deb...

52
00:05:00,824 --> 00:05:02,291
I only kill certain kinds of people...

53
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:04,326
- Oh, God.
- Like Travis.

54
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:10,632
Deb, dad taught me.

55
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:15,637
He gave me a code.

56
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,873
Dad knew?

57
00:05:17,907 --> 00:05:19,942
It was his idea.

58
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:23,445
He knew everything.

59
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,747
- Oh, fuck.
- Deb.

60
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,523
Please, just...

61
00:05:35,558 --> 00:05:37,759
just come back inside with me.

62
00:05:37,794 --> 00:05:39,794
Please.

63
00:05:51,806 --> 00:05:55,942
Harry found me sitting
in a pool of my mother's blood.

64
00:05:55,976 --> 00:06:00,346
He understood why I had these...

65
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,315
urges.

66
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,352
A lot of horrible things
happen to a lot of people,

67
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:09,622
and they don't turn out like you.

68
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:12,158
I don't know about other people.

69
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:18,399
But I have this... need

70
00:06:18,433 --> 00:06:20,368
deep inside me.

71
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:27,876
I call it my Dark Passenger.

72
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:31,312
You gave it a name?

73
00:06:32,748 --> 00:06:35,650
Harry said it got in me too early

74
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,151
and too deep.

75
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:40,755
He said I couldn't change it.

76
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,526
And so...
he thought up the code.

77
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,895
He said if I had to kill,

78
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:49,831
I might as well kill people
who deserved it.

79
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:52,066
You make it sound like
it's okay--

80
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,635
like you're the victim here.

81
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,077
The people in that box,
Dexter--

82
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:04,279
they're the victims.

83
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:06,448
Victims?

84
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:18,225
A choir director who raped
and murdered little boys?

85
00:07:20,062 --> 00:07:23,431
A married couple smuggling refugees

86
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,299
who killed the ones who couldn't pay?

87
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:28,369
A psychiatrist who manipulated women

88
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:30,405
into taking their own lives?

89
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,276
There's this place
called the police department.

90
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,078
Sometimes the system doesn't work.

91
00:07:36,112 --> 00:07:38,781
Killers fall through the cracks.

92
00:07:40,684 --> 00:07:43,586
Don't I fucking know it?

93
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:48,124
I'm talking to one right now.

94
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:02,138
I am the worst fucking detective
in the world.

95
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,408
You're my own brother.

96
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,777
How could I not see
what you were doing?

97
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:10,146
You're not responsible for this.

98
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:12,682
Well, I am now.

99
00:08:12,716 --> 00:08:16,386
I helped you cover up Travis' murder.

100
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:20,123
I'm an accomplice.

101
00:08:20,157 --> 00:08:22,058
You walked in on me.
I had to think on my feet.

102
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:25,362
Well, fuck me for ruining your night.

103
00:08:25,396 --> 00:08:27,630
What am I supposed to do here?

104
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:31,033
My name has the word
"Lieutenant" in front of it.

105
00:08:31,068 --> 00:08:33,870
I can't turn my back on this.

106
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,243
All of this is very,
very fucking wrong.

107
00:08:45,815 --> 00:08:48,250
So...

108
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,892
What are you gonna do?

109
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,262
Uhh!

110
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:12,609
I never wanted her
to go through this, Dex.

111
00:09:12,644 --> 00:09:14,244
Neither did I.

112
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,613
Then you should have been
more careful.

113
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:20,750
At least she didn't arrest me.

114
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:23,253
Not yet.

115
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,343
What is this doing here?

116
00:09:49,349 --> 00:09:52,551
Is it some kind of message?

117
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:57,190
Maybe someone else is on to me.

118
00:10:12,674 --> 00:10:16,043
"According to FBI
Special Agent Frank Lundy,

119
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,014
"it's almost certain that
the Butcher is still at work.

120
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:22,550
"Serial killers have an addiction

121
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:26,187
and will continue to kill
until they're caught."

122
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:40,802
If the ITK hand
in my apartment is genuine,

123
00:10:40,836 --> 00:10:43,571
then it can't still be in evidence.

124
00:10:54,617 --> 00:10:56,618
Not here.

125
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:58,921
Then I was sent the real thing.

126
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:04,259
No record of it being checked out.

127
00:11:04,294 --> 00:11:07,096
Could it have been stolen?

128
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,132
Sorry.

129
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,701
Sorry. Saw you come in here.

130
00:11:11,735 --> 00:11:14,271
I just got curious.

131
00:11:16,074 --> 00:11:19,009
- Now I wish I hadn't.
- Why?

132
00:11:19,044 --> 00:11:20,610
You're looking for the hand,
aren't you?

133
00:11:20,645 --> 00:11:22,546
Look, I can explain.

134
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,048
Look, remember my former intern Ryan?

135
00:11:25,082 --> 00:11:28,952
Blonde, stacked, and the cause
of many sleepless nights?

136
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:30,253
Yeah.

137
00:11:30,288 --> 00:11:31,588
Well, she needed some extra dough,

138
00:11:31,622 --> 00:11:34,925
so she stole the hand
and auctioned it online.

139
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,960
That's why I fired her.

140
00:11:36,994 --> 00:11:38,695
Who won the auction?

141
00:11:38,729 --> 00:11:40,197
Don't know.

142
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,532
I put Louis on the case to find out.

143
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,234
Louis?

144
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,036
Now, even with all his digital skills,

145
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,038
he couldn't dig up a name.

146
00:11:48,072 --> 00:11:51,041
At least he was able to erase
the electronic trail.

147
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:53,243
Did Louis find the hand and keep it?

148
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:55,879
No one needs to know, right?

149
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:59,582
But why send the work
of a serial killer to me?

150
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:01,518
Does Louis know what I am?

151
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,719
Dex?

152
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:04,921
What?

153
00:12:04,956 --> 00:12:06,656
We're cool, right?

154
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:08,325
Yeah.
No one needs to know.

155
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,327
Oh, thank God.

156
00:12:11,963 --> 00:12:13,997
I was ready to blow you.

157
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:15,699
Not necessary.

158
00:12:15,733 --> 00:12:18,035
Briefing.

159
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,970
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

160
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:27,177
I have to find out
what Louis knows about me.

161
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,478
Some time alone with him,

162
00:12:28,512 --> 00:12:30,914
and he'd open up--
one way or another.

163
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:35,719
But I need to put out fires,
not start new ones.

164
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:43,660
Remember him?

165
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,795
It's been three days
since Mike was gunned down,

166
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,764
and the son of a bitch
that pulled the trigger

167
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,699
is still walking the streets.

168
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,233
Where are we?

169
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:52,602
We're continuing to hit the club

170
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:54,136
where Miss Soroka was employed.

171
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:58,607
Someone there must've seen
something related to her death.

172
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,076
We still think it's our best
shot at a lead,

173
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,644
so we're going to shut them down
every night.

174
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:04,280
You know, those places do big
business during lunch too.

175
00:13:06,349 --> 00:13:07,550
Just saying.

176
00:13:07,584 --> 00:13:09,084
Start shutting them down twice a day.

177
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:12,221
- With pleasure.
- Moving on.

178
00:13:12,256 --> 00:13:16,259
This pretty face
belongs to Wayne Randall.

179
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,861
15 years ago, Randall
and his teenage girlfriend

180
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:22,431
went on a three-state killing
spree that ended here in Miami.

181
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:25,467
He's currently serving two
consecutive life terms at Dade.

182
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:29,138
Randall now claims to have
evidence on three other murders

183
00:13:29,172 --> 00:13:30,806
that he committed in the Miami area,

184
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,307
and he wants to come clean.

185
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:34,976
He wants to lead investigators
to where he buried the bodies.

186
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:36,411
Hmm.
That's nice of him.

187
00:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,446
He says he wants
to clear his conscience.

188
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,949
I think his lawyers are just
trying to swing a deal.

189
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:43,652
- What's he telling us?
- He told us about one victim,

190
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:45,020
a brunette in her mid-20s

191
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:47,789
that matches a missing persons
report from that time,

192
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,691
a Janice Dubois.

193
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:52,061
So then there's a chance he's
not completely full of shit.

194
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:55,030
County has requested
one detective and one lab tech

195
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:56,565
to help them process the scene.

196
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:59,201
Miller, you're volunteer number one.

197
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:01,136
- I'll go.
- No.

198
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,205
I want Masuka on this.

199
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:05,540
Aw. I don't to work
a dumpsite.

200
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:07,509
Come on lieutenant, I'm up
to my ears on Mike's case.

201
00:14:07,543 --> 00:14:08,777
I'm sorry.
You're with Miller.

202
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:10,112
Contact info will be in your boxes.

203
00:14:10,146 --> 00:14:11,346
You'll start tomorrow.
That's it.

204
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:12,681
Thank you.

205
00:14:24,093 --> 00:14:26,394
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

206
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:35,102
I was this close to arresting
you this morning.

207
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:41,608
I even thought about
what I would say to the press.

208
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:44,577
I wouldn't want to have
to write that speech.

209
00:14:44,612 --> 00:14:46,479
I don't know what to do.

210
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:49,649
Every alternative I can think of...

211
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:52,585
is fucking crazy.

212
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,621
Such as?

213
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:57,090
It's fucked up.

214
00:14:57,124 --> 00:14:59,359
Try me.

215
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:04,497
The say people like you are addicts.

216
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:07,800
Like drugs.

217
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:09,569
It's not untrue.

218
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:12,638
Well, when addicts want to get
better, they go to rehab.

219
00:15:14,808 --> 00:15:17,611
I don't think there are
clinics for what I've got.

220
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,813
We can make one.

221
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:22,315
I could be your clinic.

222
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,752
- How?
- You move in with me.

223
00:15:25,787 --> 00:15:27,420
I watch you 24/7

224
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:28,789
and make sure that
there's no way in hell

225
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:32,626
you can...

226
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,796
do what you do.
And...

227
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:39,766
If it is an addiction,
then maybe--

228
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,503
maybe you can get over it.

229
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,374
You're right.
It's crazy.

230
00:15:47,408 --> 00:15:50,878
Dexter, if you can channel your urges,

231
00:15:50,912 --> 00:15:53,247
why can't you control them?

232
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,385
What if dad had taught you how to quit

233
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,089
instead of teaching you
how to live with it?

234
00:16:02,123 --> 00:16:03,757
He fucked up.

235
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:07,661
Deb, there's a big problem
with this idea.

236
00:16:07,696 --> 00:16:08,996
What?

237
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:12,967
I've tried stopping before.
It didn't work.

238
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:16,003
Well, now you have me.

239
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:20,975
Someone who loves you more than
you will ever fucking know.

240
00:16:23,212 --> 00:16:24,646
And in spite all of this,

241
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,349
I still believe
that there is good in you.

242
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:35,856
Maybe more that's in most people.

243
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:38,526
What if it doesn't work?

244
00:16:43,966 --> 00:16:46,267
I don't want to think about that.

245
00:16:48,704 --> 00:16:52,073
And how much choice do I have here?

246
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:57,344
None.

247
00:17:00,214 --> 00:17:02,882
Okay.

248
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:07,387
Thanks for getting back to me
so quickly.

249
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:08,821
I'm curious.

250
00:17:08,856 --> 00:17:10,256
Your facilities
are state-of-the-art.

251
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,524
Why go through a private lab?

252
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,327
Just trying to lighten the load.

253
00:17:15,362 --> 00:17:17,497
It's been a hectic few months.

254
00:17:17,531 --> 00:17:19,866
But just to confirm,

255
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,736
the blood you sampled
from the glass fragment

256
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,306
is a positive match
with Travis Marshall's?

257
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,640
No question about it.

258
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:31,611
Thank you.
Thanks.

259
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:34,347
Remember, keep this confidential.

260
00:17:34,382 --> 00:17:36,383
And when you send back the findings,

261
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:39,252
address them to me personally, okay?

262
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:41,554
- No problem.
- Great. Thanks.

263
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:00,206
Yes, captain?

264
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,375
Regional FBI office, please.

265
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:24,964
We are back.

266
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,399
Hey.

267
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:28,101
I won't allow this to go on.

268
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:29,569
This is harassment.

269
00:18:29,604 --> 00:18:31,138
No, this is an inconvenience.

270
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:32,639
We're working our way
up to harassment.

271
00:18:32,674 --> 00:18:34,208
I told you the last time
you were here,

272
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:35,809
I don't know who killed Kaja.

273
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:37,678
I don't know who shot your policeman.

274
00:18:37,712 --> 00:18:39,513
Kaja was clubbed to death
in the parking lot

275
00:18:39,548 --> 00:18:41,983
15 yards from where we are now.

276
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:44,152
- No one here saw anything.
- Sell that shit somewhere else.

277
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:45,753
What are you gonna do?

278
00:18:45,787 --> 00:18:47,688
You're gonna keep coming here
every day and shut me down?

279
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:49,357
No, I'm coming back tonight too.

280
00:18:49,391 --> 00:18:50,491
What the fuck do you want from me?

281
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,259
I want the shooter.

282
00:18:52,294 --> 00:18:54,027
Now, you better rack your brain
and give me something,

283
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:56,497
or I'm gonna turn this place
into a fucking monastery.

284
00:18:56,531 --> 00:18:58,532
Mm-hmm.

285
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:01,368
You got that list?

286
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:03,070
Follow me.

287
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:07,507
You know, the money we make
here is all we have to live on.

288
00:19:07,542 --> 00:19:10,277
What you're doing is really unfair.

289
00:19:10,311 --> 00:19:11,611
What's your name?

290
00:19:11,645 --> 00:19:13,145
Nadia.

291
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,681
Come here.

292
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:24,422
Have a drink.

293
00:19:24,457 --> 00:19:27,392
We're not supposed to drink
while we're working.

294
00:19:27,426 --> 00:19:29,494
Come on.
You hear any music playing?

295
00:19:32,465 --> 00:19:35,733
Now, what you said isn't true.

296
00:19:35,768 --> 00:19:38,136
I do care who killed Kaja,

297
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,071
but no one around here
seems interested

298
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:42,106
in helping me find out who it is.

299
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:43,908
Okay?
Do you know anybody

300
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,877
who might be interested
in hurting your friend?

301
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,948
You've been told
not to cooperate with us?

302
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:55,520
Kaja was dating someone.

303
00:19:55,554 --> 00:19:59,457
Tony Rush.
He's one of the bouncers here.

304
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,193
They were on and off,
but Tony is a good guy.

305
00:20:02,227 --> 00:20:03,861
Can you point Tony out to me?

306
00:20:03,895 --> 00:20:06,463
He's not here today.

307
00:20:06,498 --> 00:20:08,332
Mm-hmm.

308
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:10,100
I really hope you catch
the person who did this

309
00:20:10,134 --> 00:20:12,169
and put a bullet through his head.

310
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:13,937
That's not generally how we work,

311
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:16,173
but I get where you're coming from.

312
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:17,841
Here, if you can think
of anything to help,

313
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,009
just give me a call.

314
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:22,546
I will...
Detective Quinn.

315
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,680
Joey.

316
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:25,783
Excuse me.
Joey.

317
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,153
- Tell me you got the shooter.
- Possibly.

318
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,489
One of the bouncers
hasn't come to work

319
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,390
- since the night of the murders.
- Tony Rush.

320
00:20:33,425 --> 00:20:36,861
- How'd you know?
- He and Kaja were an item.

321
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:38,495
Suspicious timing, don't you think?

322
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,664
- The sudden absence?
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,466
Come on.

324
00:20:55,548 --> 00:20:56,982
Hey.

325
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,259
You're gonna sleep in the bedroom.

326
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:10,529
I'm not gonna put you out.

327
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:14,265
Yes, you are.
I'm sleeping out here.

328
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,667
Deb, that's ridiculous.

329
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:18,336
This isn't a fucking
pajama party, Dex, okay?

330
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,604
You're gonna take my bedroom,

331
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:22,539
and I'm gonna sleep
out here on the couch.

332
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,908
Between me and the front door?

333
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:27,912
I will be by the door.

334
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:34,051
You've really thought this through.

335
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,554
Yeah, well,
I found this website--

336
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:39,190
"How to cure a serial killer
in ten easy steps,"

337
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:41,560
and this is the first step.

338
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:47,732
You'll have to print me out a copy.

339
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:51,402
I'm figuring this out
as I go along, Dexter.

340
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,204
But if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it all the way.

341
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:57,408
We're gonna eat together,
we're gonna watch TV together,

342
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,677
we're gonna drive
to fucking work together.

343
00:22:00,711 --> 00:22:04,013
Hope you got a big shower.

344
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:06,983
Why don't you go unpack.

345
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:09,653
I'll heat us up something to eat.

346
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:15,492
You have to be
completely honest with me.

347
00:22:15,527 --> 00:22:18,629
That is the first rule.

348
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:23,300
My new code.

349
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,325
Don't you think Deb
has gone through enough

350
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,261
without you lying to her again?

351
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:52,630
I'm not lying.

352
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:54,933
You're a killer, Dex.

353
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:57,168
Deb didn't raise you.

354
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:59,037
I did.

355
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:01,873
She never saw
what you were really like.

356
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:03,775
I did.

357
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,644
I was right to channel your urges

358
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,279
instead of trying to suppress them.

359
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:08,647
You think I can just walk out of here

360
00:23:08,682 --> 00:23:10,716
and call the whole thing off?

361
00:23:10,751 --> 00:23:13,653
If it were this simple,
watching you for 24 hours a day,

362
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:16,656
don't you think I would have tried it?

363
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:19,660
Maybe you should've.

364
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:32,439
How does it feel...

365
00:23:32,473 --> 00:23:35,275
this need to kill?

366
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:38,311
What do you call it?

367
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:41,146
My Dark Passenger.

368
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:48,220
You make it sound like
you're possessed or something.

369
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:51,690
That's how it feels sometimes.

370
00:23:54,226 --> 00:23:56,695
Do you know how many
assholes in prison

371
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:59,697
blame their actions on someone
or something else?

372
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:02,300
I'm not copping a plea, Deb.

373
00:24:02,334 --> 00:24:05,069
I'm giving you honesty.

374
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:11,709
It's rule number one, right?

375
00:24:11,744 --> 00:24:14,579
How's the spaghetti?

376
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:22,287
Overcooked.

377
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:25,223
First rule.

378
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,759
So how does it feel?

379
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,435
It starts with blood.

380
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:40,139
Blood?

381
00:24:40,173 --> 00:24:42,775
Yeah, the image of it.

382
00:24:46,413 --> 00:24:49,249
Trickling down the back of my eyelids.

383
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:58,090
The trickle becomes a stream
and then a flood.

384
00:25:00,793 --> 00:25:04,295
It fills me up...

385
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,500
all my empty spaces.

386
00:25:08,534 --> 00:25:13,773
But then the blood isn't red anymore.

387
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:15,474
What is it?

388
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:17,977
It's black.

389
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:24,618
And pressing.

390
00:25:27,522 --> 00:25:30,190
It feels like my head
is gonna explode.

391
00:25:35,597 --> 00:25:37,631
The only way to relieve the pressure

392
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:41,235
is to open the floodgates

393
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:43,904
and let it spill out.

394
00:25:48,143 --> 00:25:52,580
I can't believe you're like this.

395
00:25:52,615 --> 00:25:54,349
You're a sick fuck, Dexter.

396
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:56,117
Jesus Christ.

397
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:58,052
Well, maybe we shouldn't
talk about it.

398
00:25:58,086 --> 00:26:00,888
Yeah, maybe not while I'm
serving fucking tomato sauce.

399
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,627
Are you seeing blood now?

400
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:09,897
Nope, just spaghetti.

401
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:13,067
Well, if you start seeing red,
will you fucking call me?

402
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:16,804
And say what?
"Deb, I'm seeing blood"?

403
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,644
Say, "I really feel...

404
00:26:23,678 --> 00:26:26,847
like wrapping someone up
in plastic and stabbing them."

405
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:29,750
And I can say,
"No, Dexter, don't."

406
00:26:32,653 --> 00:26:35,355
Second rule.

407
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,326
There have to be families out there

408
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,562
that are more fucked up than us.

409
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:46,934
But I sure as hell
wouldn't wanna meet them.

410
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:52,638
What the fuck am I doing here?

411
00:26:55,108 --> 00:26:57,376
What you think's right.

412
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:01,046
Right would be turning you in.

413
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,680
I'm doing this because
you're my brother,

414
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:03,882
and I can't stand the idea

415
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:08,686
of you living the rest
of your life in prison.

416
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:11,590
Or worse.

417
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,932
I told Deb I'd be honest with her,

418
00:27:20,966 --> 00:27:22,600
but it's not like I'm stalking a kill.

419
00:27:22,634 --> 00:27:24,402
I just need to get
into Louis' penthouse

420
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:27,038
and find out what he knows about me.

421
00:27:34,748 --> 00:27:36,716
Are you okay?

422
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,284
It's late.

423
00:27:38,318 --> 00:27:40,486
Yeah.
I'm just doing some work.

424
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:45,926
I'll sit with you.

425
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,929
Deb, I'm fine.

426
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:51,331
No. You shouldn't be
alone right now.

427
00:27:51,366 --> 00:27:53,934
I mean, awake and alone.

428
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:04,312
Yeah. Maybe I should
try to get some sleep.

429
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:12,987
Just know that I'm here for you.

430
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:18,993
How could I forget?

431
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:20,828
Now that Deb is my Siamese twin,

432
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,597
getting into Louis' penthouse

433
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:26,500
is going to be next to impossible.

434
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:29,770
But how long can I wait?

435
00:28:29,804 --> 00:28:33,040
You know, for the tenth time,

436
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:36,377
I barely saw Kaja that night.
I was working.

437
00:28:36,411 --> 00:28:37,778
She got off at 2:00 A.M.,

438
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:40,381
and I don't know
what she did after that.

439
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:44,051
Whatever you decide to get
into after this, forget writing,

440
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:46,119
'cause you could not make up a story

441
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:48,422
to save your fucking life.

442
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:57,398
Security tapes back him up.

443
00:28:57,433 --> 00:28:58,766
Shit.
Are you sure?

444
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,402
No doubt.

445
00:29:00,436 --> 00:29:02,638
He was at the club all night working.

446
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:09,044
Well, it looks like some of
what you said wasn't bullshit.

447
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:11,512
You were working when Kaja was killed.

448
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:12,947
We still don't like the fact

449
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:14,849
that you vanished
the day after she died.

450
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:17,551
Smells like guilt to me.

451
00:29:17,586 --> 00:29:20,087
You could have had
someone else do it for you.

452
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:22,489
- No way.
- What happened?

453
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:24,057
She start sleeping around on you?

454
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:26,559
- Kaja was loyal.
- Loyal, huh?

455
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:28,161
Mm-hmm.

456
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,829
So she was doing you.

457
00:29:29,864 --> 00:29:31,765
At least we're getting somewhere.

458
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,200
The problem is now we know

459
00:29:34,235 --> 00:29:38,038
you've been lying to us
about you and Kaja.

460
00:29:38,072 --> 00:29:40,540
And that's bad form, Tony.

461
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:43,110
We tend to get cranky
when people bullshit us.

462
00:29:43,144 --> 00:29:45,846
Now, if you think what we're
doing to the club is bad,

463
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:50,518
wait till we start on you.

464
00:29:50,552 --> 00:29:52,920
She was with Viktor.

465
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:55,256
Say again?

466
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:58,427
The night that Kaja died.

467
00:29:58,461 --> 00:30:00,129
She left the club with Viktor.

468
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:01,764
Fucking sleazebag.

469
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:03,899
Who the fuck is Viktor?

470
00:30:05,569 --> 00:30:07,903
Hey.
How's it going out there?

471
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:09,505
Don't ask.

472
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,241
- Bad as you thought?
- Worse.

473
00:30:12,275 --> 00:30:16,878
We sit in the sun waiting
for the diggers to find a body.

474
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:18,246
I mean, so far they've uncovered

475
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,782
a telephone cable
and a bag of used diapers.

476
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:23,651
I mean, all this waiting around...

477
00:30:23,686 --> 00:30:26,487
It's like dating
a born-again Christian.

478
00:30:26,522 --> 00:30:29,457
If I don't have Deb
watching my every move,

479
00:30:29,491 --> 00:30:32,393
it'll be a lot easier to slip
away to Louis' apartment.

480
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:33,927
You know, I'm getting
a little stir crazy.

481
00:30:33,962 --> 00:30:36,229
I wouldn't mind a day out of the lab.

482
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:38,565
Dude, oh, my God,
I would be eternally grateful,

483
00:30:38,599 --> 00:30:40,900
but you'd have to clear it
with your sister.

484
00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:44,103
For some reason,
she really wants me out there.

485
00:30:44,138 --> 00:30:46,573
You think she secretly hates me?

486
00:30:46,607 --> 00:30:49,009
I'll see what I can do.

487
00:30:53,448 --> 00:30:56,350
Masuka's miserable on this whole
Wayne Randall thing.

488
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:59,120
He's begging me to take over
for him today.

489
00:30:59,154 --> 00:31:00,988
Okay.
Great.

490
00:31:01,023 --> 00:31:03,091
Great.

491
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,093
I'll drive.

492
00:31:05,128 --> 00:31:07,762
You'll drive?

493
00:31:07,797 --> 00:31:10,098
I could use some fresh air.
Let's go.

494
00:31:10,132 --> 00:31:11,800
We just got a break
on Mike's shooting.

495
00:31:11,834 --> 00:31:13,134
What?

496
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:15,136
The last person to see Kaja
alive was Viktor Baskov.

497
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:16,471
He's a Russian expat.

498
00:31:16,506 --> 00:31:18,140
We couldn't find anything on him
in here,

499
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:20,509
but we got a hit
on the Interpol database.

500
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:21,644
It turns out he's a member

501
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:22,945
of the Koshka Brotherhood
in the Ukraine,

502
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,315
known for narcotics
and human trafficking.

503
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:26,982
Hold on.

504
00:31:27,017 --> 00:31:28,951
I have to take care of this.

505
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:30,886
Are we good?

506
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:32,822
Deb, I'll be surrounded
by federal marshals.

507
00:31:32,856 --> 00:31:35,491
I think I'll be okay.

508
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,399
It was 15 years ago.
Give me a fucking break.

509
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,369
Where are the bodies, Wayne?

510
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:48,137
Closer to the road.

511
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,672
But why'd you tell us to dig here?

512
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:51,574
Because this place
looks completely different.

513
00:31:51,608 --> 00:31:53,509
Look at these mini-malls.

514
00:31:53,543 --> 00:31:58,180
You think I like being out here
with you in the fucking heat?

515
00:31:58,214 --> 00:32:00,182
All right.
Listen.

516
00:32:00,217 --> 00:32:01,750
We're moving.
Strike this.

517
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:05,188
Okay.

518
00:32:05,222 --> 00:32:08,691
Ha. One more wit,
he'd be a fucking half-wit.

519
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:11,928
God.

520
00:32:11,962 --> 00:32:14,563
Oh, it's hot as a pig's asshole.

521
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:16,699
All this asphalt.

522
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:20,903
You know, this used to be
a real pretty place.

523
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:25,241
Field, trees.

524
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:28,477
Now look at it.

525
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:30,946
Nothing stays the same.

526
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:33,582
That's the truth.

527
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:36,853
Well, at least the Frosty
Swirl's still here.

528
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:45,428
You surprised a lot of people.

529
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:47,263
How's that?

530
00:32:47,297 --> 00:32:49,532
Leading us to these bodies.

531
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,267
Why the change of heart?

532
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,936
Why do you care?

533
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:55,938
I'm just curious.

534
00:32:55,973 --> 00:32:58,908
People say you grew a conscience.

535
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,312
It was always there.

536
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:07,317
It was just buried under
a lot of Wayne Randall.

537
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:09,620
I just surrendered.

538
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,488
Surrendered?

539
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:13,123
All right.
Let's break for lunch.

540
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:14,325
We'll pick this up in an hour.

541
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:15,927
Oh, here we go.

542
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:18,630
Getting to Louis' penthouse
and back in an hour

543
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,465
will be tight,

544
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,102
but I'm not exactly
flush with options.

545
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:39,550
I can appreciate the mind-set
of a collector...

546
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,018
But toys?

547
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:44,354
Seems like a waste
of a good obsession.

548
00:34:04,507 --> 00:34:07,309
My charge card numbers?

549
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:10,479
So Louis killed my credit cards.

550
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:13,849
Why is he messing with my life?

551
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:24,862
Uh, it features
29 points of articulation,

552
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,231
five more than the last figure
they put out,

553
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,734
so at least they're listening
to the collectors.

554
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,103
Uh, still, they could have--

555
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:38,377
Idea: A video diary app.

556
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:40,179
One touch, device starts recording.

557
00:34:40,213 --> 00:34:43,783
Tap again, and it uploads
directly to--

558
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,718
Still waiting.

559
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:49,021
- Yeah, I'm almost done.
- Your hour's almost up.

560
00:34:49,056 --> 00:34:51,390
I'm only thinking of you.

561
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:55,395
Oh God.

562
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:58,731
There'll never be an app for this.

563
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,033
Jesus.

564
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,537
This is going to be worse
than Bob Henley.

565
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:06,472
He got off easy.

566
00:35:06,506 --> 00:35:10,275
I want to see Dexter lying
in his own piss and vomit,

567
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,676
and I won't stop until that represents

568
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,411
the high point of his day.

569
00:35:13,446 --> 00:35:15,680
No one fucks with me.

570
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,715
No one.

571
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:22,453
Now, on to more important things.

572
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,687
4.99--

573
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,693
Bob Henley.

574
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,905
"Henley arrested after the FBI
found child pornography

575
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,940
"on his workstation.

576
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,910
"Skanda Tech has announced
his dismissal

577
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:52,014
pending charges which could
fetch up to 15 years."

578
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,917
Is this how Louis took control
of his software company,

579
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,053
by setting this guy up?

580
00:35:57,087 --> 00:35:58,387
What's he planning for me?

581
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:18,307
With Deb on my case,

582
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:20,777
I don't know when
I'll have this chance again.

583
00:36:36,526 --> 00:36:38,360
Why are you fucking with me, Louis?

584
00:36:38,395 --> 00:36:40,329
God, please, don't hurt me.

585
00:36:40,363 --> 00:36:42,430
You better give me a good
reason not to hurt you,

586
00:36:42,465 --> 00:36:44,699
because right now I really
want to break your neck.

587
00:36:44,734 --> 00:36:46,268
Why'd you send me the hand?

588
00:36:46,302 --> 00:36:48,136
It was just a--
it was a stupid joke.

589
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:51,106
I just--you know, the lifelines,
you know, time is short.

590
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,308
It was a clue.
I was screwing with you.

591
00:36:53,342 --> 00:36:54,710
Why?

592
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,111
Uh, because...

593
00:36:56,146 --> 00:36:59,948
I came to you for help
with my game, and you said no.

594
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:02,618
Your game?

595
00:37:02,652 --> 00:37:03,986
Uhh!

596
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:07,155
Yes, I swear that's the reason.

597
00:37:07,189 --> 00:37:10,191
Gah--

598
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:17,131
This is about your game?

599
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:20,701
I spent five years on that game,

600
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:22,437
and you shit all over it.

601
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:24,973
And now I'm too depressed
to even look at it, okay?

602
00:37:25,007 --> 00:37:27,375
It was my whole world.

603
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:34,715
I never wanna see you again.

604
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,517
Work.

605
00:37:36,552 --> 00:37:39,254
Jamie.

606
00:37:39,288 --> 00:37:40,789
Do you understand?

607
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:45,794
I'm done.
I'm totally done.

608
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:56,205
Where the fuck have you been?

609
00:37:56,239 --> 00:37:58,007
Running an errand.

610
00:37:58,041 --> 00:37:59,576
What errand?

611
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,244
Deb, I didn't kill anybody.

612
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,746
How the fuck do I know that?

613
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,714
I've been calling you and calling you.

614
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,016
Well, I didn't get the messages.

615
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,884
Well, check your fucking phone.

616
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:09,352
I need to know where you are
at all times.

617
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:11,588
That is what we agreed on, right?

618
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,423
It won't happen again.

619
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,891
Finish what you need to do here,

620
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,027
and then we'll go visit Harrison
together.

621
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:18,194
Okay.

622
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,929
Here you are.

623
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,967
Seems you rode that wagon
until the wheels came off.

624
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,870
- Trouble in paradise?
- No, she's my sister.

625
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:30,139
Also my boss.

626
00:38:30,173 --> 00:38:33,609
Congratulations.

627
00:38:33,643 --> 00:38:35,978
You just redefined hell.

628
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,447
What crawled up her ass?

629
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,450
It's a long story.

630
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,619
Randall, what'd you mean earlier

631
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:46,121
when you said "surrendered"?

632
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:50,992
I just accepted my situation,
you know,

633
00:38:51,026 --> 00:38:53,127
of being where I am.

634
00:38:53,161 --> 00:38:54,962
Prison.

635
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:57,064
People watching your every move.

636
00:38:57,098 --> 00:38:59,900
It is what it is.

637
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:01,869
Once I stopped fighting it,

638
00:39:01,903 --> 00:39:06,007
the anger just fell off...

639
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,810
Like a bad scab.

640
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:13,215
Left me open to try
and make things right.

641
00:39:16,286 --> 00:39:19,188
They still use real ice cream.

642
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:22,025
At least everything
hasn't gone to hell.

643
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:31,268
We're still not getting
anywhere, George.

644
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:34,205
I mean, you really must like us
coming here.

645
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,107
There's nothing I can do about it.

646
00:39:36,141 --> 00:39:37,975
Well, stop protecting Viktor Baskov.

647
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,844
- I told you...
- Yeah, he doesn't work here.

648
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:42,180
Just comes in for a drink
now and then.

649
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,448
- That's all I know.
- Right.

650
00:39:44,483 --> 00:39:46,551
We'll see you soon.

651
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:50,989
I might even bring a portable
polygraph next time.

652
00:39:51,023 --> 00:39:54,960
You know how long it would take
to poly everyone in here?

653
00:40:01,335 --> 00:40:05,238
Okay. Everybody
get your asses back to work.

654
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,817
Rough day?

655
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,319
Isaak.

656
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:25,089
Mr. Sirko.

657
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:27,725
What are you doing here?

658
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,694
I heard the police.

659
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:32,429
It would appear that I'm here
for the same reason,

660
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:33,931
to find Viktor.

661
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,966
Yeah, I swear.

662
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:40,004
I have no idea how they got his name.

663
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,574
I'm sure of it.

664
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,442
But we'll get to that.

665
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,914
Anyway, I thought
he was in Kiev with you.

666
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:55,752
If Viktor was in Kiev,
why would I be here?

667
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,954
Viktor never made his flight.

668
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,589
I checked.

669
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,758
I don't understand.

670
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:05,362
Where is he, then?

671
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,034
Viktor's caused us some problems.

672
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,737
I won't deny it.

673
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:17,107
Shooting a policeman
is never good for business.

674
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,613
I can't help but wonder

675
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,782
if someone in the brotherhood

676
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:28,552
decided to make an example of him.

677
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,121
Without your approval?

678
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:33,191
No, no, no.

679
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:35,159
Viktor was impulsive, yes.

680
00:41:35,194 --> 00:41:37,796
He did a stupid thing, yes.

681
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:39,964
But he was one of us.

682
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:42,567
And we would always protect him.

683
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,511
You're in luck.

684
00:41:53,545 --> 00:41:56,381
Why?

685
00:41:56,415 --> 00:41:59,451
I believe you.

686
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,691
I've had a long flight.

687
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:14,199
We have a lot to discuss.

688
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:19,171
- Hello?
- Hello, Joey?

689
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:21,207
It's Nadia from the Fox Hole.

690
00:42:21,241 --> 00:42:24,777
Yeah, how many Nadias
do you think I know?

691
00:42:24,811 --> 00:42:27,513
- What's up?
- My car won't start.

692
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:30,350
I was wondering
if maybe you could give me

693
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:32,185
a ride home tonight.

694
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:35,555
Yeah, sure.
What time do you get off?

695
00:43:34,116 --> 00:43:36,618
Hey, we were just having
a little dinner.

696
00:43:36,652 --> 00:43:38,520
Look who's here.

697
00:43:38,554 --> 00:43:40,188
Hey, bud, I missed you today.

698
00:43:40,222 --> 00:43:42,524
- How was school?
- We had toy share.

699
00:43:42,558 --> 00:43:44,593
- Toy share?
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:43:44,627 --> 00:43:46,594
Did you bring your train set?

701
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:48,530
Fire truck.

702
00:43:48,564 --> 00:43:51,265
Fire truck beat out the train set?

703
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,266
Yes.

704
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,636
Oh, hey, Dex.

705
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,604
Just grabbing one for the road.

706
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:59,306
I know you don't like me
being on this side alone,

707
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,875
but it's all right
when Jamie's here, right?

708
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:05,478
Why not?

709
00:44:05,512 --> 00:44:06,813
Sweet.

710
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:08,581
This is such a great place
to hang out.

711
00:44:08,616 --> 00:44:10,284
Right by the bay.

712
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:11,952
- Yeah.
- I love coming over here.

713
00:44:11,987 --> 00:44:14,221
Mm-hmm.

714
00:44:14,256 --> 00:44:15,956
Well, I better get going.

715
00:44:15,991 --> 00:44:18,259
I'll see you tomorrow.

716
00:44:26,836 --> 00:44:29,705
I'll catch you at work, right?

717
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:42,652
He's not scared of me at all.

718
00:44:42,686 --> 00:44:48,524
And he's not going to quit
unless I stop him.

719
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:53,263
You're a lifesaver.

720
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:55,365
Not all cops are so nice to strippers.

721
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,100
To tell you the truth,

722
00:44:57,135 --> 00:44:59,804
I was hoping you had something
more for me.

723
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:01,505
More for you?

724
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,274
About the murders.

725
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,443
What? You think this is

726
00:45:05,478 --> 00:45:11,250
just some ploy so I can get you
alone and spill my guts?

727
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:15,287
Look, I told you everything
that I knew.

728
00:45:15,322 --> 00:45:17,523
My car really did break down.

729
00:45:17,557 --> 00:45:21,193
Sorry. If you want,
I could pay you for the gas.

730
00:45:21,227 --> 00:45:23,829
Stop it. It's fine.
It's the least I can do

731
00:45:23,863 --> 00:45:26,565
after all I'm costing you in tips.

732
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,434
You'll have to do a lot more
than give me a lift

733
00:45:29,468 --> 00:45:30,802
to make up for that.

734
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,273
This is it.
On the left.

735
00:45:38,076 --> 00:45:42,213
What'd you have in mind
as far as compensation?

736
00:45:42,247 --> 00:45:45,516
I don't know.
Use your imagination.

737
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,350
Well, you're gonna have
to give me a hint.

738
00:45:47,385 --> 00:45:50,387
I'm very unimaginative.

739
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:52,756
Okay.

740
00:45:54,725 --> 00:45:58,461
George says the problem with my
car could be the transmission.

741
00:45:58,495 --> 00:46:00,096
Mm-hmm.

742
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:04,434
It means it's going to be in the shop

743
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:06,569
for at least a few days.

744
00:46:06,603 --> 00:46:08,104
Yeah.

745
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:13,544
Well, maybe you could
pick up the bill.

746
00:46:13,578 --> 00:46:15,913
I'd really appreciate it.

747
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:29,126
You're awfully quiet tonight.

748
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,228
Anything you wanna talk about?

749
00:46:31,263 --> 00:46:34,098
Anything I can do?

750
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:37,134
Yeah.

751
00:46:37,168 --> 00:46:39,469
What?

752
00:46:39,504 --> 00:46:41,371
Do you have any A.1.?

753
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:45,843
I think so.

754
00:46:47,178 --> 00:46:49,913
Just enough for a good night's sleep.

755
00:46:49,948 --> 00:46:53,583
That's all I need.

756
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:55,552
Success!

757
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:58,121
Thank you.

758
00:47:22,212 --> 00:47:25,314
Just finishing what you started.

759
00:47:44,868 --> 00:47:48,338
I promised Deb.

760
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:07,525
Hello?

761
00:48:11,564 --> 00:48:13,231
Where are you?

762
00:48:18,304 --> 00:48:19,805
Sorry.

763
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:21,907
I got here as fast as I could.

764
00:48:21,941 --> 00:48:26,445
I almost drove off the road.
I'm so fucking tired.

765
00:48:26,479 --> 00:48:30,182
What are you doing here?

766
00:48:32,252 --> 00:48:36,055
I snuck out of the house
while you were asleep.

767
00:48:36,089 --> 00:48:37,957
Dexter, what the fuck did you do?

768
00:48:37,991 --> 00:48:42,228
Nothing.

769
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:45,698
I couldn't go through with it,
but I wanted to.

770
00:48:45,732 --> 00:48:47,233
I needed to.

771
00:48:47,267 --> 00:48:50,536
I didn't care about anything else.

772
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:54,573
I lost control.
All I could see was blood.

773
00:48:54,608 --> 00:48:56,642
All I could feel was the pressure...

774
00:48:56,676 --> 00:48:58,910
in my head.

775
00:48:58,945 --> 00:49:01,980
Fuck.

776
00:49:04,383 --> 00:49:06,250
It is too deep inside me.

777
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:08,819
Harry was right.
I am a monster.

778
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:16,260
You should arrest me.
You should take me in.

779
00:49:16,294 --> 00:49:18,663
Get me off the street.

780
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:23,535
Dex, dad was wrong.

781
00:49:26,038 --> 00:49:30,776
The fact that we're here tonight
proves that you are in control.

782
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,345
- But I wasn't.
- But you stopped.

783
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:36,281
That's what's important.

784
00:49:36,316 --> 00:49:39,117
It must've been so hard for you
to call me,

785
00:49:39,152 --> 00:49:42,188
but you did, and that's a huge step.

786
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,929
It makes me think
maybe you can control this.

787
00:49:48,963 --> 00:49:51,130
You really believe that?

788
00:49:51,164 --> 00:49:53,700
I didn't,

789
00:49:53,734 --> 00:49:57,003
but maybe now I do.

790
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:03,910
What happened tonight is a good thing.

791
00:50:03,944 --> 00:50:06,946
It was really, really good.

792
00:50:08,648 --> 00:50:11,616
I'm not gonna give up,

793
00:50:11,651 --> 00:50:15,019
and I'm not gonna let you give up.

794
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:22,092
Are you okay to drive?

795
00:50:22,126 --> 00:50:23,460
No, I'm gonna stay with you.

796
00:50:23,494 --> 00:50:27,731
I just need to be alone
for a couple of minutes.

797
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:30,734
Nothing's gonna happen.

798
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:33,771
Okay.

799
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:02,436
You'll wake up with a headache,

800
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:05,372
probably have a decent idea
how you got here.

801
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:07,574
Maybe that's a good thing.

802
00:51:19,419 --> 00:51:22,721
I still have to get you
out of my life.

803
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:25,224
But not by taking yours.

804
00:51:46,278 --> 00:51:48,780
What the fuck?

805
00:51:50,182 --> 00:51:53,084
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm your employer--

806
00:51:53,118 --> 00:51:55,420
or rather, former employer.

807
00:51:55,454 --> 00:51:57,989
I believe you recently gave notice.

808
00:51:58,024 --> 00:52:00,492
Bullshit.
I work for George.

809
00:52:00,526 --> 00:52:02,761
- Well, worked.
- And he works for me.

810
00:52:02,795 --> 00:52:04,930
My name is Isaak.

811
00:52:04,964 --> 00:52:07,432
I'm the owner of the Fox Hole
chain of gentlemen's clubs,

812
00:52:07,467 --> 00:52:09,568
amongst other enterprises.

813
00:52:09,602 --> 00:52:11,236
What do you want?

814
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,672
Well, it would appear
that George neglected

815
00:52:13,706 --> 00:52:15,440
to do your exit interview.

816
00:52:15,475 --> 00:52:16,908
It's company policy,

817
00:52:16,943 --> 00:52:18,777
and I'm a stickler
when it comes to rules.

818
00:52:18,811 --> 00:52:21,346
You got--
you got to be kidding, right?

819
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,248
Keeping good employees is essential

820
00:52:23,282 --> 00:52:24,949
to running a successful business.

821
00:52:24,984 --> 00:52:27,084
Your feedback is important.

822
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,186
Would you mind telling me
why you quit?

823
00:52:29,221 --> 00:52:33,090
Well, I trust it wasn't
the hostile working environment.

824
00:52:33,124 --> 00:52:35,759
No, I, um...

825
00:52:35,793 --> 00:52:39,228
I just felt it was time to move on.

826
00:52:39,263 --> 00:52:41,130
So it was nothing to do
with the tragic death

827
00:52:41,164 --> 00:52:43,098
of one of our dancers?

828
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:44,934
Kaja, I believe her name was.

829
00:52:44,968 --> 00:52:48,904
Because if it did,
I would completely understand.

830
00:52:48,938 --> 00:52:51,473
It must have been quite
a traumatic loss for you.

831
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:53,075
What do you mean?

832
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:56,212
Maybe that's why
you talked to the police.

833
00:52:56,246 --> 00:52:57,480
No way.

834
00:52:57,514 --> 00:53:00,517
I had you followed.

835
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,221
You know what?
I didn't say a word.

836
00:53:03,255 --> 00:53:04,222
I swear.

837
00:53:04,256 --> 00:53:05,957
I lied.

838
00:53:05,992 --> 00:53:08,093
I didn't have you followed.

839
00:53:08,127 --> 00:53:10,829
You were just
the most likely candidate.

840
00:53:14,533 --> 00:53:17,802
- You loved her, didn't you?
- What?

841
00:53:17,836 --> 00:53:19,503
Kaja.

842
00:53:19,538 --> 00:53:22,240
You were in love with her.

843
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:24,976
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

844
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,181
It's the one thing that gives
meaning in this life.

845
00:53:31,551 --> 00:53:35,554
I would have done the same thing
if I was in your position.

846
00:53:38,057 --> 00:53:41,493
It's terrible to lose someone
you love.

847
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:17,164
You still thinking about last night?

848
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:18,399
Actually, I'm thinking about

849
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:20,368
how much I could go
for a Frosty Swirl.

850
00:54:20,403 --> 00:54:22,571
That's good.

851
00:54:22,605 --> 00:54:25,740
A sudden craving for sugar is good?

852
00:54:25,775 --> 00:54:28,743
Well, if you're thinking
about normal things,

853
00:54:28,777 --> 00:54:31,846
then maybe you're becoming
more normal.

854
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,383
I'm never going to be normal, Deb.

855
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:37,652
Yeah.

856
00:54:37,686 --> 00:54:39,687
None of us really are.

857
00:54:41,723 --> 00:54:43,591
Where are you going?

858
00:54:43,625 --> 00:54:47,494
I want a Frosty Swirl.
I'll bring you one.

859
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:51,498
She'll always be watching me.
But maybe that's okay.

860
00:54:51,532 --> 00:54:54,334
If Wayne Randall can make peace
with his sentence,

861
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:55,736
who am I to complain?

862
00:54:55,770 --> 00:54:59,039
Especially considering
the alternative.

863
00:54:59,073 --> 00:55:00,507
Well, well.

864
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:04,044
Looks like you two are ready
to eat each other's shit.

865
00:55:04,078 --> 00:55:07,147
Oh, yeah.
We kind of patched things up.

866
00:55:09,651 --> 00:55:11,285
I'm happy for you.

867
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:16,224
I never got to do that with Hannah.

868
00:55:16,259 --> 00:55:19,227
Robin to my Batman.

869
00:55:21,331 --> 00:55:25,468
I was never as alive
as I was when I was with her.

870
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:28,871
Every day was like

871
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:32,041
Christmas day--

872
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:33,575
unwrapped present.

873
00:55:35,678 --> 00:55:39,348
I wish I had a chance
to tell her how I felt.

874
00:55:39,382 --> 00:55:43,019
You can still tell her.

875
00:55:43,053 --> 00:55:45,054
Yeah.

876
00:55:45,088 --> 00:55:47,689
I'm afraid the clock has run out.

877
00:55:53,129 --> 00:55:59,101
Damn, I sure as fuck...

878
00:55:59,135 --> 00:56:01,437
gonna miss that.

879
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:09,144
Hannah used to think
I was something special.

880
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:12,281
Now she sees me as just a killer.

881
00:56:14,618 --> 00:56:17,186
And you know what?

882
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,756
She's not wrong.

883
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:24,359
There's just one last person
I need to kill.

884
00:57:04,202 --> 00:57:07,737
He never cared
if anyone found the bodies.

885
00:57:07,772 --> 00:57:12,976
He just wanted a couple of days
of sunshine and Frosty Swirl.

886
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:15,745
Randall didn't change,

887
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:18,748
and he couldn't take life in prison.

888
00:57:22,086 --> 00:57:23,935
Can I?

889
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:36,866
