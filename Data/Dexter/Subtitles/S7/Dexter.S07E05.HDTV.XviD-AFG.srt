2
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,529
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:49,706
Who is Dexter Morgan?

4
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:52,989
He's just a jerk who works
for Miami Metro Homicide.

5
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:56,526
That's Dexter Morgan.

6
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,196
His face--
it looks familiar.

7
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:02,232
Only one person who ever
worked at Miami Metro

8
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,233
ever took blood slides--

9
00:02:03,268 --> 00:02:06,471
Sergeant Doakes,
the Bay Harbor Butcher.

10
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:12,411
Same type of weapon used
on Mike Anderson.

11
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:15,348
Are we sure this Alex Dubrozny guy

12
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:16,516
shot Mike Anderson?

13
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,518
'Cause it smells like a setup.

14
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:19,766
Hannah McKay--

15
00:02:19,886 --> 00:02:22,423
she spent six years in juvie
after pleading guilty

16
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:24,558
to being Wayne Randall's accomplice.

17
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:26,841
She always claimed she was just
another one of his victims.

18
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:28,022
Is that what you're doing here,

19
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:29,964
to help us find the other bodies
Wayne buried?

20
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,433
My lawyer said it was for the best.

21
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,401
Do you understand your rights?

22
00:02:34,436 --> 00:02:35,436
Huh?

23
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,972
He didn't say, "Yes."

24
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:39,913
He walked.
There is nothing we can do.

25
00:02:40,033 --> 00:02:42,986
Fuck that.
Fuck all of this.

26
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,854
But there is something I can do.

27
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:50,260
That smoke...

28
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,429
It's Speltzer.

29
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,966
How do you feel?

30
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,835
Glad.

31
00:02:57,869 --> 00:03:00,963
What does that make me?

32
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:13,952
It never ends, does it?
The maintenance.

33
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,754
I don't mind it.

34
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:18,557
It's the one thing that never changes.

35
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:20,426
The waves keep rolling in,

36
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,228
wearing everything down in their path

37
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:23,829
a little more every day.

38
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:25,198
Harrison's coming home soon.

39
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:26,532
I want to have the boat ready.

40
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,701
So life's back to normal?

41
00:03:28,735 --> 00:03:31,638
A new normal.

42
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:34,841
Deb's not poring over
the past anymore.

43
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:38,678
We're on course, moving forward.

44
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,948
Life can be less complicated now.

45
00:03:40,982 --> 00:03:42,182
You don't believe that.

46
00:03:42,217 --> 00:03:44,318
Why not?
She didn't abandon me.

47
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:46,988
She didn't accept you either.
She doesn't know what to think.

48
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:49,891
She's adjusting.

49
00:03:49,926 --> 00:03:52,661
I did everything in my power
to protect her from you--

50
00:03:52,695 --> 00:03:54,163
what you really are.

51
00:03:54,197 --> 00:03:55,264
A monster?

52
00:03:55,298 --> 00:03:56,499
Your words.

53
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:57,600
Your thoughts.

54
00:03:57,635 --> 00:03:59,336
You didn't think she could handle it

55
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,437
because you couldn't,

56
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,272
but Deb is stronger than you are.

57
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,007
For now.

58
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,276
But the long-term exposure--

59
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,744
it's going to eat away at her,

60
00:04:08,779 --> 00:04:11,847
like salt water on steel.

61
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:25,060
Blood.
It's not from Viktor.

62
00:04:25,094 --> 00:04:27,062
I never leave a mess behind.

63
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,463
Who's been on my boat?

64
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,475
This is too much blood.

65
00:04:41,509 --> 00:04:43,344
Someone died here...

66
00:04:43,378 --> 00:04:46,680
someone I didn't kill.

67
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:57,524
Who are you?

68
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,259
All right, look,
if I'm getting shit-canned

69
00:04:59,293 --> 00:05:00,694
and you know something about it,

70
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:02,495
just give me a heads-up,
all right?

71
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,764
We're bros.

72
00:05:07,635 --> 00:05:09,269
First of all,

73
00:05:09,303 --> 00:05:13,173
we are not and never will be bros.

74
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:16,276
Secondly, I've told you
a million times

75
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:18,546
- I don't know anything.
- Really?

76
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,514
Then why'd your voice just rise?

77
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:22,516
Look, I-I took a class
in paralinguistics.

78
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,051
Changing pitch--
dead giveaway for lying.

79
00:05:25,086 --> 00:05:29,689
Get the fuck away from my desk!

80
00:05:29,723 --> 00:05:31,057
Am I getting the ax?

81
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:32,692
You are if you don't get
out of my way.

82
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,127
Look, I just got off the phone
with a colleague,

83
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:35,896
and Laguerta's processing
evidence at another lab,

84
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,097
a private lab.

85
00:05:37,131 --> 00:05:38,432
What evidence?
What are you talking about?

86
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,467
A charred blood slide of--

87
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:42,468
containing the blood
of one Travis Marshall.

88
00:05:42,502 --> 00:05:43,736
So I asked myself,

89
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,571
"Vince, if your lady boss
is processing evidence

90
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:46,572
at another lab--"

91
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,907
A blood slide?
Are you certain?

92
00:05:47,941 --> 00:05:49,275
Oh, God.

93
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:51,811
Increase in vocal volume,
indicating emotional dissonance.

94
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,179
You know something.
I'm fucked.

95
00:05:53,213 --> 00:05:55,749
I am sure that Laguerta
is using an outside lab

96
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:58,485
because she knows how slammed you are.

97
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,920
I'll look into this,
so just fucking relax.

98
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:02,522
Okay.
Thanks, L.T.

99
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:04,157
You rock.

100
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:10,363
Got a second?

101
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:12,365
Sure.

102
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,900
Masuka got wind that you're using

103
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,736
an outside lab to run evidence,

104
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,370
and he thinks he's gonna get fired.

105
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:20,172
Is there anything I should know?

106
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:22,441
I needed a second pair of eyes
on something.

107
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,443
It's nothing.

108
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,249
Does this have anything to do
with the Bay Harbor Butcher?

109
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,923
Lundy carried that notebook
everywhere he went.

110
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:38,259
Get the door.

111
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,969
This has to remain between you and me.

112
00:06:48,004 --> 00:06:49,905
Of course.

113
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,574
I had a lab analyze a blood slide

114
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:54,309
that I found at the abandoned church.

115
00:06:54,343 --> 00:06:58,246
A blood slide, like
a Bay Harbor Butcher trophy?

116
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,349
Travis Marshall's blood was on it.

117
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:03,218
But Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher,

118
00:07:03,252 --> 00:07:04,386
and Doakes is dead.

119
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,254
Well, what if it wasn't Doakes?

120
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:09,424
What if the Bay Harbor Butcher
is still alive and at work?

121
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:12,594
What if <i>he</i> killed Travis Marshall?

122
00:07:12,628 --> 00:07:16,031
Except Travis Marshall
wasn't cut up into pieces

123
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:17,899
and put into bags.

124
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:20,168
But the fact
that the Bay Harbor Butcher

125
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:23,172
kept blood slides was never
released to the public.

126
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:26,508
It's probably not some copycat.

127
00:07:26,543 --> 00:07:29,411
How do you explain this?

128
00:07:29,446 --> 00:07:32,147
I can't.

129
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:36,619
I know it sounds impossible, but...

130
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:39,388
I never believed
that Doakes was a killer.

131
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:44,292
And from his notes,
Lundy had his doubts too.

132
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:47,028
Well, you can add me to that list.

133
00:07:47,062 --> 00:07:49,230
Doakes was my partner.

134
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:52,767
He was a good man.

135
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:59,406
Is there anything I can do to help?

136
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:03,043
You have no idea how good
it is to hear you say that.

137
00:08:03,078 --> 00:08:06,747
I've been keeping this all to myself.

138
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,522
Your eyes only.

139
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,824
My eyes only.

140
00:08:29,305 --> 00:08:32,641
Fuck.

141
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:35,077
Fuck.

142
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:39,049
Motherfucking suck bag!

143
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:43,319
You cock-munching
fucking fuck nugget!

144
00:08:46,456 --> 00:08:50,359
Fuck!

145
00:08:57,968 --> 00:09:01,237
The blood on my boat belongs to...

146
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:03,407
Louis Greene?

147
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:07,077
Louis is dead?

148
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,778
Why was he killed on my boat?

149
00:09:08,813 --> 00:09:11,448
Why would he have even been
on my boat?

150
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,650
Why...

151
00:09:13,684 --> 00:09:15,419
is my sister looking at me like that?

152
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:17,787
Dex...

153
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:23,894
we are in a storm of fuck.

154
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:25,929
Laguerta found a blood slide

155
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:29,800
with Travis Marshall's blood
on it at the fucking church.

156
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,538
That's not good.

157
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:35,440
How the fuck do you lose
a blood slide?

158
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:39,311
Deb, you know that night
wasn't my usual scenario.

159
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,914
Are you saying that it's my fault

160
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,215
that Laguerta now thinks

161
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,950
that the Bay Harbor Butcher
is alive and well?

162
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,785
No, that's not what I meant,

163
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,956
but that night at the church
wasn't exactly

164
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,325
by the playbook.

165
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,527
I talked Laguerta into letting me help

166
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:57,695
with the investigation,

167
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,831
so I can keep tabs
on what's happening.

168
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,365
You what?

169
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,134
No.

170
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,636
I'll deal with this.

171
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,003
I don't want you involved.

172
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:09,273
Well, it's a little
fucking late for that.

173
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,275
She wants to talk
to the friends and family

174
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,744
of everyone on this list

175
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,079
who's gone missing since Doakes died.

176
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,647
They all the fit the victim profile

177
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,017
of the Bay Harbor Butcher.

178
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:21,652
Anyone here that you recognize?

179
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,893
These three...

180
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:32,464
are mine.

181
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,966
This is never gonna end, is it?

182
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,535
They were bad people, Deb,

183
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:39,304
who would've continued
to do bad things.

184
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:41,973
This is the only one
with family in Miami--

185
00:10:42,007 --> 00:10:45,343
Phillip Barnes.

186
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,945
So, when Laguerta and I
split up the list,

187
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,813
I'll make sure I get his family.

188
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,515
No, I don't like you doing this.

189
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:55,320
I don't give a fuck
what you like, Dexter.

190
00:10:55,354 --> 00:11:00,192
It's beyond that.
This is my ass too.

191
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:04,029
Tell me what I need
to know about Barnes.

192
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:11,804
He was a wedding photographer.

193
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,941
He would find a guest
from out of town--

194
00:11:14,975 --> 00:11:18,544
young, female, by herself.

195
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,280
He would charm her,
invite her back to his hotel.

196
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,485
She'd never come home.

197
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,854
He took pictures of what he did.

198
00:11:32,657 --> 00:11:35,992
So what'd you do?

199
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:38,461
He was going out of town
for another job,

200
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:43,065
so I nabbed him after a reception.

201
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,768
A reception?

202
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:48,504
A fucking wedding reception?

203
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:51,707
Dexter, what if Barnes got
a picture of you?

204
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:53,241
- Deb--
- What if someone remembers you?

205
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:55,177
It was a wedding.

206
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:57,512
Everyone was concentrating
on the bride and groom.

207
00:11:57,546 --> 00:12:00,281
I slipped in and out.
It's fine.

208
00:12:00,316 --> 00:12:02,817
What if you're wrong?

209
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:04,719
I'm not.

210
00:12:04,753 --> 00:12:06,553
Laguerta will not tie me to this.

211
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:09,790
There's no body, no proof.

212
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:11,825
Stay away from it, okay?

213
00:12:20,534 --> 00:12:22,134
First thing I have to do is find out

214
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:26,105
why Louis was killed on my boat.

215
00:12:26,139 --> 00:12:28,874
My curtains are open.

216
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:31,209
With Harrison gone,
Jamie's not around.

217
00:12:31,243 --> 00:12:33,644
Someone has been in my apartment...

218
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,146
Maybe still is.

219
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,258
Hey, Dex. It's Sam.

220
00:12:49,292 --> 00:12:51,126
Just want to confirm we're still on

221
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,094
for 1:00
at Schooner or Later

222
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:56,131
at Twelfth and Bayshore Drive.

223
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,433
See you there.

224
00:13:16,118 --> 00:13:19,520
I've met him before at the bar
at the Fox Hole--

225
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:22,323
owned by the Koshka brotherhood.

226
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:23,691
The man who killed Mike Anderson,

227
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:26,427
Viktor Baskov, was one of the Koshkas.

228
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:28,195
Could they have figured out
I killed Viktor

229
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,798
and sent a hit man after me?

230
00:13:49,652 --> 00:13:50,919
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

231
00:13:50,953 --> 00:13:53,622
I think I have a phone call for you.

232
00:13:53,656 --> 00:13:57,158
A small coffee, please.

233
00:13:57,193 --> 00:13:58,660
Hello?

234
00:13:58,694 --> 00:14:01,163
Why were you in my apartment?

235
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:03,365
Well, aren't you
Mr. Smarty-Pants?

236
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,667
Answer the question.

237
00:14:05,702 --> 00:14:07,636
What were you doing in my place?

238
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,605
I was looking to have a discussion

239
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,808
about a friend of mine
who's gone missing--Viktor.

240
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:14,476
I'm sure you remember him.

241
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,345
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

242
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,780
I don't care for lies.

243
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:19,415
I told you, I don't know who that is.

244
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:21,117
You're wasting both our time.

245
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:25,053
Louis Greene--
who I found on your boat,

246
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:28,556
the boat that was used to dump
Viktor in the ocean--

247
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:29,857
gave me your name.

248
00:14:29,892 --> 00:14:32,760
So you killed Louis.

249
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:36,797
We had a conversation
that ended rather abruptly, yes.

250
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:38,699
What else did Louis say?

251
00:14:38,733 --> 00:14:41,134
I believe he may have referred to you

252
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:42,669
as a douche bag.

253
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:44,470
You think you're very clever.

254
00:14:44,505 --> 00:14:45,738
I do, actually, yes.

255
00:14:45,773 --> 00:14:48,141
Your bosses
at the Koshka brotherhood--

256
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:50,343
- they sent you?
- Ah...

257
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:53,746
You've done your homework.

258
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,015
There are no bosses
telling me what to do.

259
00:14:56,049 --> 00:14:58,284
Viktor was a friend of mine.
This is personal.

260
00:14:58,318 --> 00:14:59,852
So an eye for an eye, huh?

261
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:02,522
Your friend Viktor kills
an innocent woman and a cop,

262
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:05,625
and killing me
somehow settles the score?

263
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,060
Oh, you misunderstand me.

264
00:15:07,094 --> 00:15:09,462
I'm not stopping with you.

265
00:15:09,496 --> 00:15:11,531
I also want any
of your police officer friends

266
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:13,266
involved in this little vendetta...

267
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,267
Wait.

268
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:16,202
Including your lieutenant sister.

269
00:15:16,237 --> 00:15:18,037
I've done my homework too.

270
00:15:18,071 --> 00:15:21,807
It was just me.
She had nothing to do with this.

271
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,443
Hello, handsome.

272
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:26,545
I work alone.

273
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,948
I killed Viktor--only me.

274
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:30,250
I'll see you around.

275
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:32,185
That's the plan.

276
00:15:34,788 --> 00:15:36,623
Why in fuck-ville
are you telling me

277
00:15:36,657 --> 00:15:38,158
to meet you in the parking garage?

278
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:39,793
Because of him.

279
00:15:39,828 --> 00:15:41,462
Do you want to be
a little more specific?

280
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:42,896
His name is Isaak Sirko.

281
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:45,699
He's part of the Koshka brotherhood.

282
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,333
He's after me.

283
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:49,702
But don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

284
00:15:49,736 --> 00:15:50,736
What did you do?

285
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:52,338
But you could be in danger too.

286
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:53,639
That's why you need to know.

287
00:15:53,673 --> 00:15:55,274
That's why we're meeting here
and why--

288
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:57,343
- Dex.
- But I'm gonna handle this.

289
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,911
Why is he after you?

290
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,415
Viktor Baskov.

291
00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:06,418
Viktor Baskov disappeared.

292
00:16:09,455 --> 00:16:11,156
You killed him.

293
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,558
He killed Mike Anderson.

294
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:16,328
What about the guy
that said he killed Mike--

295
00:16:16,362 --> 00:16:18,830
the--the bartender that blew
his fucking brains out?

296
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:21,300
Someone put him up to it--
Isaak probably--

297
00:16:21,334 --> 00:16:23,869
so that you would close the case
and move on.

298
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:26,471
This is un-fucking real.

299
00:16:26,505 --> 00:16:28,640
Viktor Baskov was on his way
back to Kiev.

300
00:16:28,675 --> 00:16:29,908
I had to kill him.

301
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:31,576
I didn't have any more time.

302
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:32,844
- There wasn't--
- Time? You didn't--

303
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,412
You didn't have time
to make a phone call

304
00:16:34,447 --> 00:16:35,947
so that I could--I don't know--
fucking arrest him

305
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:37,682
- or something?
- His flight was leaving.

306
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:38,950
His...

307
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:43,588
How do you know he killed Mike?

308
00:16:43,622 --> 00:16:45,890
I found his fingerprint at the scene.

309
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:51,328
And you didn't tell me?

310
00:16:51,362 --> 00:16:54,064
You kept it
from the police department?

311
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,902
Dex, so what happened to you
only taking care

312
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,671
of people that slip through the cracks

313
00:17:01,705 --> 00:17:03,072
of the justice system?

314
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,241
You can't rip a case wide open

315
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,810
so that it conveniently falls
into your fucking lap!

316
00:17:07,844 --> 00:17:09,044
I know.

317
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:10,579
Obviously you don't know, Dexter,

318
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,481
because this is normal for you.

319
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:15,916
But trust me, this is not
fucking normal for me,

320
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,184
not at all.

321
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:19,319
How am I supposed to do
my fucking job?

322
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,688
Which at this point is the
be-all, end-all of hypocrisy,

323
00:17:21,723 --> 00:17:23,858
because I am the lieutenant
of fucking Homicide,

324
00:17:23,892 --> 00:17:27,795
and I have already helped you
cover up two murders.

325
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,463
Three--
this makes three.

326
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,033
And the fucking bartender--
oh, my fucking God.

327
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:34,736
Oh, my God.

328
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:38,640
How did this become my life?

329
00:17:38,674 --> 00:17:40,942
- Deb, where are you going?
- I'm gonna arrest Isaak!

330
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,610
I'm gonna take him to fucking jail.

331
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,312
- On what charge?
- I'll find something!

332
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,814
No!
We can't--

333
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:50,185
I can't afford to risk him talking.

334
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,389
Look, I will handle this,
but until I do,

335
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:57,158
we need to take extra precautions.

336
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:01,096
Isaak is convinced that
there's some police conspiracy.

337
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,767
He thinks we all killed Viktor,
so you're at risk too.

338
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:06,868
What?

339
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:09,804
But I can keep you safe.

340
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,906
We're gonna go to a hotel...

341
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,174
A place where no one knows who we are,

342
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,276
where no one asks any questions,

343
00:18:16,311 --> 00:18:18,111
a place where we'll both be safe.

344
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:20,247
This is fucking fantastic.

345
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:23,917
He might be watching
the precinct, your home.

346
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:26,287
I need you to take a car
from the motor pool,

347
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:28,456
make sure you never leave
the same way twice.

348
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,926
Make sure no one follows you.
I'll do the same.

349
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:34,729
I need you to promise me something.

350
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:35,864
What?

351
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:39,402
That you will never take a case

352
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:42,805
from the police department
again, from me, ever.

353
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,208
Okay.

354
00:18:45,243 --> 00:18:47,377
Are you lying to me?

355
00:18:47,411 --> 00:18:49,079
I don't think so.

356
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:51,448
You don't think so?
You don't fucking think so?

357
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:54,852
I'm not lying.

358
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:58,088
I have no way of knowing, do I?

359
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:12,669
When you begin a stalk,
you start with what you know.

360
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:16,106
And with Isaak, that isn't much.

361
00:19:35,027 --> 00:19:37,562
Isaak isn't just some hit man.

362
00:19:37,596 --> 00:19:39,129
He's a boss.

363
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:50,109
Damn.

364
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,276
Yes?

365
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:54,580
Dexter, Hannah McKay is on her way in.

366
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:57,216
I'm kind of tied up
with something right now.

367
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,452
Dexter, Hannah is gonna talk us

368
00:19:59,486 --> 00:20:01,321
through her road trip
with Wayne Randall

369
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:03,223
and help us find the rest
of the bodies.

370
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:05,726
This is important.
Get here now.

371
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,896
Right.
I'm on my way.

372
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,071
In that first week,

373
00:20:18,105 --> 00:20:20,006
Wayne shot a gas station attendant

374
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,941
in Ashford, Alabama.

375
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:24,911
That's where these are from.

376
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:27,947
And Wayne shot another attendant

377
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:30,883
in Lake City, Florida.

378
00:20:38,225 --> 00:20:41,727
And then he shot a guy
outside of Sarasota

379
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:44,697
who stopped to help you fix a flat.

380
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:49,836
You then get picked up in Miami

381
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:53,106
trying to sneak on board
a cruise ship.

382
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,177
That week you guys were
in Miami--

383
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:59,113
that's the story we don't know...

384
00:20:59,147 --> 00:21:00,614
The people Wayne killed,

385
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:03,718
the bodies we'd like to find.

386
00:21:03,752 --> 00:21:07,054
It looks like it starts here.

387
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:09,023
Uh...

388
00:21:09,058 --> 00:21:10,926
Uh, we got to Miami,

389
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,163
and we were the only thing
on the news.

390
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:15,865
We were desperate--
no money,

391
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,068
cops everywhere.

392
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:20,337
Wayne decided that we would
hide out in the motels

393
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:24,007
until we could make it
to that cruise ship.

394
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:31,613
He killed people
so we could take their rooms.

395
00:21:31,647 --> 00:21:35,283
We buried the bodies
close to the motels.

396
00:21:35,317 --> 00:21:36,684
Where were the motels?

397
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:38,619
One was by a Frosty Swirl--

398
00:21:38,654 --> 00:21:40,888
uh, Wayne's favorite.

399
00:21:40,922 --> 00:21:42,623
That's where Miss Dubois was found.

400
00:21:42,657 --> 00:21:44,658
What about these?

401
00:21:44,693 --> 00:21:46,227
Those two go together.

402
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:47,695
Together?

403
00:21:47,729 --> 00:21:49,864
They were a couple--

404
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:52,667
husband and wife, I guess.

405
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:56,171
- Where are they buried?
- Close to one of the ports.

406
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:58,473
I remember big ships unloading.

407
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:00,408
And the motel?

408
00:22:00,443 --> 00:22:02,277
Small...

409
00:22:02,312 --> 00:22:04,079
Um, one-story--

410
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,314
I think I would recognize it,

411
00:22:05,348 --> 00:22:08,985
but so much of that time
is just a blur, you know?

412
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:14,524
Everything changed in Miami--
Wayne, most of all.

413
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:16,426
I was so scared.

414
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:20,364
I thought that he was gonna kill me.

415
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:21,865
He forced me to help him
dig those holes,

416
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,968
and every time that I dug one of them,

417
00:22:24,002 --> 00:22:27,838
I-I wasn't sure if I was digging
my own grave or not.

418
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:29,974
I understand how difficult
this is for you,

419
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,609
but if you'll excuse me,

420
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:34,445
I'm gonna get the ball rolling
on the next dig--

421
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,847
tomorrow if possible.

422
00:22:36,882 --> 00:22:40,284
Sure. I'd like to get
this over with.

423
00:22:54,766 --> 00:22:57,934
That toy isn't bringing back
memories of being scared.

424
00:22:57,969 --> 00:23:00,003
She's nostalgic.

425
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:02,573
No touching.

426
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,512
Can I have your giraffe back, please?

427
00:23:09,546 --> 00:23:12,882
It's Wayne's...

428
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:15,250
Wayne's giraffe.

429
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:18,486
It was wrapped in your shirt.

430
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:21,489
What, are you a detective now too?

431
00:23:27,496 --> 00:23:32,367
Sergeant Batista will give you
the details for tomorrow.

432
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:34,336
Will you be there?

433
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,609
I hope so.

434
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:52,588
Killing Isaak would make
a lot of Koshkas very angry...

435
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,161
But a lot of Colombians very happy.

436
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:01,296
The goddamn shower
has two settings--

437
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,531
scalding and freezing.

438
00:24:03,565 --> 00:24:07,436
It's a cheap motel.
That's the point.

439
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,171
I'm not doing this another night.

440
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:12,808
Hopefully we won't have to.

441
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:16,279
Does that mean you're working
on a solution?

442
00:24:16,313 --> 00:24:19,215
I have a plan, yes.

443
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:23,452
Does it involve you killing someone?

444
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:26,488
I'm not killing anybody.

445
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,527
That's my bed...

446
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:34,496
closest to the door.

447
00:24:43,673 --> 00:24:45,208
Tell me your plan.

448
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:47,243
No.

449
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,412
Dexter, I'm hiding out
in this fucking motel room.

450
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,614
I'm a part of this.

451
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:55,918
Not any more than you need to be.

452
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:06,529
This is not how I ever imagined
spending tonight.

453
00:25:06,563 --> 00:25:09,432
We've stayed in hotel rooms before.

454
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:14,470
Yeah, when we went to Myrtle Beach

455
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:16,372
to visit mom's sister.

456
00:25:18,742 --> 00:25:22,445
There were sea shells embedded
in the plaster on the walls...

457
00:25:24,248 --> 00:25:28,418
no air-conditioning,
just ceiling fans.

458
00:25:28,453 --> 00:25:31,121
There was sand
from the beach everywhere,

459
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:33,824
even in the beds.

460
00:25:36,628 --> 00:25:39,730
You kept your eyes on me all day.

461
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:46,103
I didn't want you to drown.

462
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:52,543
You were my hero.

463
00:26:01,386 --> 00:26:03,721
Good boy.
Good.

464
00:26:07,325 --> 00:26:10,094
Hot as hell out here...

465
00:26:10,128 --> 00:26:12,396
even with the ocean breeze.

466
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:15,199
Think we'll find anything?

467
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:19,570
The motel Hannah and Wayne
stayed at is still here.

468
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:22,106
Nothing's changed much...

469
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:24,676
since their spree.

470
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,779
- Pretty good odds.
- Hmm.

471
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,952
Can I ask you something?

472
00:26:36,188 --> 00:26:39,057
This bartender
who shot himself--

473
00:26:39,091 --> 00:26:41,125
Alex Dubrozny...

474
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,429
Do you think it's a suicide?

475
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:49,667
Masuka matched his handwriting
to the note he left.

476
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:52,503
His fingerprints were
on the gun, GSR on the hand.

477
00:26:52,537 --> 00:26:54,972
He definitely pulled the trigger.

478
00:26:57,008 --> 00:27:00,844
Ow.
Fucking bugs.

479
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:03,279
I'm gonna go get some spray
from the car.

480
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:12,423
This part of the job...

481
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:14,325
stand around and stare?

482
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,463
I'm not needed unless
there's a body or blood.

483
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:21,633
I don't know how you do it.

484
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:23,335
First time Wayne killed somebody,

485
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:27,606
he shot him
right in the chest, and I...

486
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,274
couldn't move.

487
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:32,344
I've never seen that much blood
in my life.

488
00:27:35,314 --> 00:27:37,015
First crime scene I ever worked,

489
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:41,886
a woman stabbed her husband
after fixing him a sandwich.

490
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,589
By the time I got there,
he looked like he was asleep,

491
00:27:44,623 --> 00:27:46,691
just floating on a sea of red

492
00:27:46,726 --> 00:27:51,363
and the sandwich next to his head.

493
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:54,166
Seemed so sad that no one
was gonna eat it.

494
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:57,736
Look at us talking blood and gore

495
00:27:57,771 --> 00:27:58,771
like we're on a date,

496
00:27:58,805 --> 00:28:01,407
sharing our first sexual experience.

497
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:07,546
I've got work to do.

498
00:28:15,856 --> 00:28:17,656
There you are.

499
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:19,791
Aren't you supposed to be
talking to the Connors?

500
00:28:19,826 --> 00:28:21,560
They were less than cooperative.

501
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:23,362
This was on my way back
to the station,

502
00:28:23,396 --> 00:28:25,464
so I thought I'd sit in.

503
00:28:25,498 --> 00:28:27,433
Great.

504
00:28:33,273 --> 00:28:34,440
Hi.

505
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:37,377
I'm Captain Maria Laguerta,
Miami Metro,

506
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:38,779
and this is Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

507
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:41,148
I talked to your mom,
Patricia. Is she home?

508
00:28:41,182 --> 00:28:43,116
No, uh, sorry.
She got called into work.

509
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,951
Oh, that--
we'll come back.

510
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,853
Is this about my dad?

511
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:48,455
She said you guys had called.

512
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,258
I could try to answer
any questions, if you want.

513
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:54,228
That would be very helpful.

514
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:55,363
Yeah.

515
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:05,873
When was the last time
you saw your father?

516
00:29:05,908 --> 00:29:08,809
May 19, 2007--

517
00:29:08,844 --> 00:29:10,811
the best fucking day of my life.

518
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:12,980
How so?

519
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:17,018
'Cause he never came back.

520
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:19,587
So wasn't it hard growing up
without a father?

521
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:20,955
It was a hell of a lot better

522
00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:23,324
than growing up with a father
who beat me and my mom

523
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,393
every chance he got.

524
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:27,162
I'm sorry.

525
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:29,898
Then one night, he didn't come home.

526
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:31,934
I swear, everything got better.

527
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:34,537
My mom wasn't crying all the time,

528
00:29:34,571 --> 00:29:37,707
and I wasn't constantly looking
over my shoulder.

529
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:39,109
Ty, you mentioned the last time

530
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:42,212
you saw your father--
he was working a wedding?

531
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,114
Yeah, uh, my mom printed out

532
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,583
some pictures for you from that night.

533
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,218
She--she thought
you might want them.

534
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,386
Great.

535
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,291
What are you hoping to find
in these pictures?

536
00:29:54,326 --> 00:29:56,193
Special Agent Lundy had this theory

537
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,629
that the Bay Harbor Butcher
was in law enforcement.

538
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:01,198
If Barnes was killed by the Butcher...

539
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,000
then his face might be
in one of the pictures.

540
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:05,303
We might even know him...
or her.

541
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:12,143
- You mind?
- Yeah. No.

542
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,283
Okay.

543
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,856
What are you looking for exactly?

544
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,024
We think your father

545
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,627
may have been abducted and murdered

546
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,028
the night he disappeared,

547
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:35,766
and the person responsible
could be in these pictures.

548
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,836
Mom would finally know
he's not coming home.

549
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,239
This is a big wedding--
a lot of pictures.

550
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:45,310
You know, maybe I should take
these back to the station

551
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,513
and spend the day going over them.

552
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:53,119
You're right.

553
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:55,288
We shouldn't rush this.

554
00:30:55,322 --> 00:30:57,790
Thank you, Ty.
Thanks.

555
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:02,763
Right here--
put it down.

556
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:12,406
Go ahead, detective.

557
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,747
"Till death do us part"

558
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:21,348
didn't quite work out for these guys.

559
00:31:21,383 --> 00:31:23,617
Get it?

560
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:26,820
'Cause they're dead,
but they're still together?

561
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:28,388
Okay, moving on.

562
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:30,723
The shower curtain helped preserve

563
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,792
the bodies and the clothes.

564
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:34,994
Our lucky day.

565
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:44,971
It's a safe assumption
that Wayne started

566
00:31:45,005 --> 00:31:46,306
with the male.

567
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,275
It would've been important
to immobilize him first,

568
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:53,613
'cause he presented
the biggest threat.

569
00:31:53,647 --> 00:31:55,982
There are defensive wounds
on the arms and the hands.

570
00:31:56,017 --> 00:31:57,083
He put up a fight.

571
00:31:57,118 --> 00:32:00,087
Judging from the cuts in the fabric,

572
00:32:00,121 --> 00:32:03,289
we're looking at perhaps
a six-inch knife.

573
00:32:03,324 --> 00:32:06,559
Numerous shallow wounds

574
00:32:06,594 --> 00:32:09,963
until Wayne was able
to inflict this--

575
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:12,866
the fatal wound.

576
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,136
Once he was done with him,

577
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,173
he moved on to the female victim.

578
00:32:21,842 --> 00:32:24,010
Stabbed numerous times.

579
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,812
The spatter pattern

580
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:29,849
suggests the victim fell on her back.

581
00:32:29,884 --> 00:32:32,619
And these voids here likely indicate

582
00:32:32,653 --> 00:32:36,322
that she was straddled
by her assailant...

583
00:32:36,357 --> 00:32:39,993
Who was much smaller than Wayne.

584
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:41,861
If Wayne didn't kill this person...

585
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,534
Dexter...

586
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:52,837
What does it mean?

587
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:55,206
I'm not sure.
It could mean a lot of things.

588
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,809
I won't know until I get back
to the lab and run some tests.

589
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:04,114
I guess we're done here.

590
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,895
Why'd you stop?

591
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,263
Stop what?

592
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,200
You started to describe
how Wayne killed that girl.

593
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:27,137
And you got halfway through,
and then you stopped.

594
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,206
I did.

595
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,641
And then you looked right at me.

596
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:33,310
I did.

597
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,646
Why?

598
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,415
The spatter told me a story

599
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,852
that conflicts what you say happened.

600
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,987
Really?

601
00:33:44,021 --> 00:33:46,189
How so?

602
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:51,928
How'd you get this?

603
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:56,766
It's a little something I got
for talking back to Wayne.

604
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:00,170
He got angry and slashed at me.

605
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,972
Bullshit.

606
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,274
Do you know something that I don't?

607
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:06,943
Wayne didn't kill that woman.

608
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,714
He was too busy with the male.
It was someone smaller--

609
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:13,283
someone with a different knife

610
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:15,619
who was...

611
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,855
inexperienced...

612
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,525
got carried away
with the frenzy of the moment,

613
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,360
stabbed the woman over and over

614
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,695
until the knife got so bloody,

615
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,432
her hand slipped along
the edge of the sharp blade,

616
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:32,636
cutting her palm very deeply,
exactly like yours,

617
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:37,341
leaving a passive spatter stain
on the victim's dress.

618
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,079
Everything you said is a lie.

619
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,318
That's my story...

620
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,020
and I'm sticking to it.

621
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,422
And you don't even care.

622
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,527
You have immunity, don't you?

623
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:01,598
The D.A. gave you immunity
for cooperating with us.

624
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:05,202
From any crime committed
with Wayne, yeah.

625
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,270
Yeah.

626
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:12,075
A girl's got to protect herself.

627
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:15,612
I'll see you around, Dexter Morgan.

628
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:38,201
Isaak...
I knew you'd show up eventually.

629
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:12,734
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna lose you.

630
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:51,408
Welcome to the wrong side
of town, Isaak.

631
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,118
Not used to strangers here.

632
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,786
Koshkas.

633
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,455
And certainly not used
to their sworn enemies

634
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,557
walking in.

635
00:37:07,591 --> 00:37:10,494
But Isaak, being from out of town,

636
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,730
won't know any of this.

637
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,897
Definitely not as much fun

638
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:51,066
as putting Isaak on my table...

639
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,969
But it does mask his death
as the resulting war

640
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:56,238
between rival heroin dealers.

641
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:03,145
Who's saving whose ass now?

642
00:38:15,423 --> 00:38:17,491
- What's up?
- I know you're busy.

643
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:18,726
And also want you to know

644
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,327
that I'm not trying to stir up
any shit.

645
00:38:20,362 --> 00:38:22,863
Of course not.

646
00:38:22,897 --> 00:38:26,533
It's about this Alex Dubrozny suicide.

647
00:38:31,806 --> 00:38:33,540
There's something about this guy

648
00:38:33,574 --> 00:38:35,508
being Anderson's killer
that's just not right.

649
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:39,613
Sorry. It's dispatch.

650
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:42,315
Sergeant Batista.

651
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:49,023
Okay. Got it.

652
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:50,358
Gonna have
to rain-check this.

653
00:38:50,392 --> 00:38:53,594
Homicide at a Colombian hangout.

654
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:55,930
Got blood, Dexter.

655
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:56,931
Where we going?

656
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:59,167
Mateo's bar.
Know it?

657
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,535
Nope.

658
00:39:01,837 --> 00:39:03,838
I'll meet you there.

659
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:09,510
Holy shit.

660
00:39:12,514 --> 00:39:14,582
It's like somebody turned on the hose

661
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:16,050
and sprayed blood everywhere.

662
00:39:16,085 --> 00:39:17,218
Great.

663
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:19,421
I left Isaak here outnumbered

664
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:21,422
and expected to find only his body.

665
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:23,691
So where is he now?

666
00:39:23,725 --> 00:39:25,826
Do we know these guys?

667
00:39:25,861 --> 00:39:27,695
This is Andres Rodriguez.

668
00:39:27,729 --> 00:39:29,764
He's a member of the Rojas cartel.

669
00:39:29,798 --> 00:39:32,033
We ran into each other a few times

670
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:33,234
when I worked Narcotics.

671
00:39:33,268 --> 00:39:35,670
Is it possible Isaak did all of this?

672
00:39:35,704 --> 00:39:38,172
Why do drug hits have to be so messy?

673
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:40,542
You got to make a big show.

674
00:39:40,576 --> 00:39:44,412
Who do think good's
for this--the Eighty-Sevens?

675
00:39:44,447 --> 00:39:46,415
Or the Koshka brotherhood.

676
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:49,084
Koshkas?

677
00:39:51,988 --> 00:39:53,555
What happened here, Dex?

678
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,962
Considering this one
was closest to the door,

679
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,397
he was probably
first to see the attacker,

680
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,566
first to respond.

681
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:07,570
He drew his gun as the attacker fired.

682
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,576
The misting
on the juke box and the wall

683
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,444
indicates multiple bullet hits,

684
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,847
all through-and-through.

685
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:21,651
Victim number two--

686
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:23,119
Looks like he got a shot off.

687
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:29,927
But that didn't stop the assault.

688
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:32,096
The attacker returned fire...

689
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:45,643
twice in the chest,
once in the stomach.

690
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,345
Judging from the lack of pooling
around the body,

691
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:49,113
suggests that the victim was dead

692
00:40:49,148 --> 00:40:50,782
before the third shot.

693
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:51,916
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

694
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:55,086
How many people were here shooting?

695
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:58,590
There's only evidence
of one killer--

696
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,859
one brutally efficient killer.

697
00:41:00,893 --> 00:41:03,028
Jesus fuck.

698
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:10,235
Looks like our attacker ran
out of bullets

699
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,537
right around here.

700
00:41:20,381 --> 00:41:22,616
It's from a defensive wound.

701
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,018
Looks like
it was a deep cut--

702
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:27,220
forearm maybe,

703
00:41:27,254 --> 00:41:31,391
obviously not fatal.

704
00:41:31,426 --> 00:41:33,827
The attacker grabbed
the nearest weapon...

705
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:35,862
hit his victim over the head,

706
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:38,932
inflicted a massive skull fracture...

707
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:48,874
And walked right out the door.

708
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:51,343
So we're looking
for the fucking Terminator.

709
00:41:54,547 --> 00:41:56,382
Let's get the blood running
through the system

710
00:41:56,416 --> 00:41:57,516
as quickly as possible.

711
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,351
Maybe we can match it to a name.

712
00:42:00,453 --> 00:42:01,687
Okay, everybody outside.

713
00:42:01,721 --> 00:42:03,756
Let's let Dexter and Masuka do
their thing.

714
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:04,857
Sarge...

715
00:42:04,891 --> 00:42:07,627
mind if I run an errand real quick?

716
00:42:13,835 --> 00:42:15,335
Was this part of your fantastic plan?

717
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,504
I never said my plan was fantastic,

718
00:42:17,539 --> 00:42:20,908
but, no, this is not
how I thought it would go.

719
00:42:20,943 --> 00:42:23,044
Do we have an even bigger
problem on our hands now?

720
00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:26,514
Not if we can find
a match for this blood.

721
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:28,316
You'll be able to make an arrest.

722
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:32,253
The sooner the better.

723
00:42:32,287 --> 00:42:34,522
I couldn't agree more.

724
00:42:37,926 --> 00:42:41,395
Right here, baby.

725
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:45,665
You know, your car's fixed now.

726
00:42:45,699 --> 00:42:47,500
You're gonna have to start using it.

727
00:42:47,534 --> 00:42:49,802
But I like having a chauffeur.
Come on.

728
00:42:49,836 --> 00:42:52,371
Let me show you how much I like it.

729
00:42:52,405 --> 00:42:54,440
I wish I could, but I got work to do.

730
00:42:54,474 --> 00:42:57,009
Oh, just forget about work.

731
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:03,848
We're gonna have
to fucking pay them back.

732
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,917
I'll get some guys
and do it myself, if you want.

733
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:07,285
No.

734
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,420
Well, they're sure as shit
gonna come after us.

735
00:43:09,455 --> 00:43:11,990
And we can't sit around
and do nothing.

736
00:43:12,024 --> 00:43:14,826
Shit.

737
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,696
We don't need a cop here now.

738
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:19,831
Who is he?

739
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:21,466
Joey Quinn--

740
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,203
He came up from Narcotics,
and now he's Homicide.

741
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:26,605
We used to have
an understanding with him.

742
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,307
What kind of understanding?

743
00:43:28,341 --> 00:43:30,309
Leave a bag of cash in his car,

744
00:43:30,343 --> 00:43:31,777
and he'd do
whatever we asked--

745
00:43:31,812 --> 00:43:35,281
mostly just look the other way.

746
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:13,220
Fuck.

747
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:46,052
Well?

748
00:45:04,473 --> 00:45:08,809
Lieutenant, are the cuffs necessary?

749
00:45:08,843 --> 00:45:10,744
Probably not.

750
00:45:10,778 --> 00:45:13,647
Would your client like to have
a little chat with us?

751
00:45:13,681 --> 00:45:15,949
My client has nothing to say.

752
00:45:15,983 --> 00:45:18,117
He's exercising
his American right to silence.

753
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:20,553
Well, fucking God bless America.

754
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,288
Get this guy to booking.

755
00:45:22,322 --> 00:45:25,958
Your client's going to jail
for the rest of his life.

756
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,329
Nice to meet you, Lieutenant Morgan.

757
00:45:36,103 --> 00:45:38,171
Maybe now that Isaak's behind bars,

758
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:41,074
we can have that face-to-face
he's been so desperate for.

759
00:45:52,153 --> 00:45:54,955
So you got Isaak Sirko.

760
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,258
<i>We</i> got Isaak Sirko.

761
00:45:58,293 --> 00:46:02,897
Congratulations.
It's a big deal.

762
00:46:05,801 --> 00:46:08,103
May I?

763
00:46:16,812 --> 00:46:20,148
- Our earlier conversation...
- Right.

764
00:46:20,182 --> 00:46:25,687
I don't think Alex Dubrozny
shot Mike Anderson.

765
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:27,322
It doesn't make any sense.

766
00:46:27,356 --> 00:46:29,524
Alex has been in this country
for two years,

767
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:32,460
and according to every stripper
I interviewed,

768
00:46:32,494 --> 00:46:35,897
all he talked about
was his wife and his kids.

769
00:46:35,931 --> 00:46:39,201
He didn't show any interest
towards Kaja.

770
00:46:39,235 --> 00:46:42,538
I think someone put Alex up to this,

771
00:46:42,572 --> 00:46:45,742
someone connected to Isaak Sirko.

772
00:46:45,776 --> 00:46:47,977
Deb...

773
00:46:48,012 --> 00:46:51,681
I still think Viktor Baskov
killed Mike Anderson.

774
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:53,717
And Viktor just disappeared
into thin air.

775
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:58,355
- But if we can find--
- Sergeant...

776
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,257
your dedication is admirable.

777
00:47:00,292 --> 00:47:02,093
Deb, it's me. You don't
have to talk like that.

778
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:04,429
And a year ago, I might have
been right beside you,

779
00:47:04,463 --> 00:47:07,399
fighting for what I thought was right.

780
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:10,902
But the hardest lesson
that I've learned as lieutenant

781
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:15,807
is knowing when to back the fuck down.

782
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:19,110
You don't believe me.

783
00:47:19,145 --> 00:47:21,679
You don't have concrete
evidence to support your theory.

784
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:24,248
And I can't afford to reopen
a murder investigation.

785
00:47:24,283 --> 00:47:26,083
This isn't just
any murder investigation.

786
00:47:26,118 --> 00:47:29,286
- This is Mike Anderson--
- Mike's killer is dead.

787
00:47:31,623 --> 00:47:34,124
Mike got justice.

788
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:39,296
Let it go.

789
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,764
That's an order.

790
00:47:49,773 --> 00:47:52,575
Okay, Lieutenant.

791
00:47:52,609 --> 00:47:54,577
You got it.

792
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:08,858
My God.

793
00:48:35,686 --> 00:48:36,886
Hello, Isaak.

794
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,954
Hello, Dexter.

795
00:48:38,989 --> 00:48:41,257
I underestimated you.

796
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:43,325
Have you come here to taunt me?

797
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,060
No, I just thought maybe
you could help me.

798
00:48:45,094 --> 00:48:49,131
Why is it so important
that you kill me?

799
00:48:50,834 --> 00:48:53,069
Well, it's quite simple, really.

800
00:48:53,103 --> 00:48:57,874
You killed Viktor.
I liked Viktor.

801
00:48:57,908 --> 00:49:01,110
Like or not, he killed Mike Anderson.

802
00:49:01,145 --> 00:49:04,614
Is that why
you killed him--revenge?

803
00:49:04,649 --> 00:49:07,451
Yes.

804
00:49:07,485 --> 00:49:09,520
There was the briefest flicker

805
00:49:09,554 --> 00:49:11,790
of hesitation there.

806
00:49:13,726 --> 00:49:15,861
But if you're telling the truth,

807
00:49:15,895 --> 00:49:18,898
then you don't require
any explanation.

808
00:49:18,932 --> 00:49:21,334
You understand the need for vengeance.

809
00:49:21,368 --> 00:49:24,204
So you got arrested.
There'll be a trial.

810
00:49:24,238 --> 00:49:27,274
You'll go to prison for a long time.

811
00:49:27,308 --> 00:49:29,109
Does that mean this is over?

812
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:35,615
- Over?
- Yes.

813
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:41,954
I had a great uncle...

814
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:44,390
my grandfather's brother.

815
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:45,825
He was a hero--

816
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:49,629
fought with the Red Army
during the Second World War.

817
00:49:49,663 --> 00:49:51,597
When he returned to Kiev afterwards,

818
00:49:51,632 --> 00:49:55,635
some fat, little party official

819
00:49:55,669 --> 00:49:59,606
resented the fact
that everyone admired him,

820
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,642
so he decided to make
an example of him

821
00:50:02,677 --> 00:50:04,611
by taking away his house.

822
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,548
When my great uncle protested,

823
00:50:08,582 --> 00:50:12,518
he was hung in front
of the council chambers.

824
00:50:12,553 --> 00:50:16,089
My grandfather was just a teenager.

825
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:19,091
When that party official
saw the hatred in his eyes,

826
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:22,428
he had him arrested
and sent to Siberia.

827
00:50:22,463 --> 00:50:26,498
And the years rolled by.

828
00:50:26,533 --> 00:50:30,803
And my grandfather got on
with his life as best he could.

829
00:50:30,837 --> 00:50:34,073
He was a patient man.

830
00:50:36,142 --> 00:50:40,679
Finally, when the Soviet Union fell,

831
00:50:40,713 --> 00:50:42,313
he returned to Kiev

832
00:50:42,348 --> 00:50:46,217
and celebrated in front of City Hall

833
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:47,785
with all the others.

834
00:50:47,819 --> 00:50:49,987
And that's when he found

835
00:50:50,021 --> 00:50:53,791
that fat, little party official.

836
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:56,961
And he got to enjoy the pleasure
that belonged to him

837
00:50:56,995 --> 00:50:58,963
and him alone

838
00:50:58,997 --> 00:51:02,066
by sticking a six-inch knife

839
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,469
into that fat, little man's kidney.

840
00:51:07,172 --> 00:51:09,741
So you ask me...

841
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:13,078
if this is over.

842
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:14,847
No.

843
00:51:14,881 --> 00:51:17,282
I'm afraid not.

844
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:22,121
There's only one problem.

845
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:23,122
And that is?

846
00:51:23,156 --> 00:51:25,391
I'm not some fat, little man.

847
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:30,764
That's true.

848
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:32,666
I don't know who you are.

849
00:51:35,203 --> 00:51:37,872
If you ever find out,
you'll regret it.

850
00:51:47,617 --> 00:51:49,784
Hey.
Come on in.

851
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:52,787
See this?

852
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,255
What is it?

853
00:51:54,289 --> 00:51:59,160
It's me life-guarding your ass
for a change.

854
00:51:59,194 --> 00:52:01,795
I took it from Laguerta.

855
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:06,500
I told you to stay clear of this.

856
00:52:06,535 --> 00:52:10,305
Well, you're lucky I didn't.

857
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:13,175
- Deb--
- She would've seen you, Dexter.

858
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:21,017
So you saved me.

859
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:23,520
Yeah.

860
00:52:27,891 --> 00:52:30,260
Thanks.

861
00:52:32,563 --> 00:52:35,898
It's yours.
It's not mine.

862
00:52:35,932 --> 00:52:38,867
I don't want to be involved
in that part of your life.

863
00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:41,770
I don't want you to be.

864
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:43,472
I know you're not gonna stop.

865
00:52:45,108 --> 00:52:49,044
But I don't want to know about it.

866
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:51,346
Okay.

867
00:52:52,948 --> 00:52:56,050
I had to lie to Batista...

868
00:52:56,084 --> 00:53:00,554
Batista for you.

869
00:53:00,588 --> 00:53:02,589
And that was the moment
that I realized

870
00:53:02,623 --> 00:53:05,058
that I don't want to be
a part of this.

871
00:53:05,092 --> 00:53:06,993
I can't do it.

872
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:11,497
It took me forever to wrap my brain

873
00:53:11,531 --> 00:53:13,966
around the idea that...

874
00:53:14,001 --> 00:53:16,536
you're not who I thought you were.

875
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:21,173
But it doesn't mean I have to change.

876
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:26,879
All of your stealing and your lying

877
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,982
and your covering up...

878
00:53:30,016 --> 00:53:33,186
That's not me.

879
00:53:41,629 --> 00:53:44,665
So you think Laguerta's
investigation is...

880
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:46,934
closed?

881
00:53:51,906 --> 00:53:54,141
No.

882
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:57,944
Lundy couldn't figure me out.

883
00:53:57,979 --> 00:54:01,648
No reason to think Laguerta will.

884
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:11,357
Oh, if Lundy could see me now...

885
00:54:15,195 --> 00:54:17,296
And you.

886
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:28,374
I've been thinking about our vacation

887
00:54:28,408 --> 00:54:31,144
to Myrtle Beach a lot...

888
00:54:31,178 --> 00:54:33,513
How we spent our days.

889
00:54:33,547 --> 00:54:36,683
On the beach.

890
00:54:36,717 --> 00:54:39,986
Running up and down the shore...

891
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:42,022
And at low tide,
running in and out of the water.

892
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:46,427
I was always chasing you.
I could never catch you.

893
00:54:46,462 --> 00:54:49,264
You wouldn't take off your flippers.

894
00:54:54,036 --> 00:54:56,671
Even if I did, you were always...

895
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,775
just out of reach.

896
00:55:02,611 --> 00:55:06,480
Maybe we're learning
it's better that way.

897
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:14,622
Did you get the blood report back

898
00:55:14,656 --> 00:55:17,258
on the bodies from the dig?

899
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:20,728
Yeah.

900
00:55:20,762 --> 00:55:23,531
And?

901
00:55:23,565 --> 00:55:25,966
Anything I should know?

902
00:55:29,003 --> 00:55:31,971
Nope.

903
00:55:57,396 --> 00:56:01,733
As kids, Deb and I would try
to outrun the waves,

904
00:56:01,768 --> 00:56:04,570
but I would always end up
diving under them.

905
00:56:04,604 --> 00:56:06,271
I'd swim deep

906
00:56:06,306 --> 00:56:10,442
because I could withstand
the pull of the tide.

907
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:22,521
But Deb was always safest at shore.

908
00:56:22,556 --> 00:56:26,625
From here on out, I'll face
the depths by myself.

909
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:39,089
