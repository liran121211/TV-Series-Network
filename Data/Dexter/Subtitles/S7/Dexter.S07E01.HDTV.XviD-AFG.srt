2
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:49,144
Previously on Dexter...

3
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:51,479
You really believe in nothing?

4
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,012
I suppose I believe
in a certain set of principles

5
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:56,758
so that I don't get into trouble.

6
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,841
Sounds like something
I might teach a puppy.

7
00:01:58,876 --> 00:02:00,213
Is that so bad?

8
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,411
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you

9
00:02:02,446 --> 00:02:04,147
Lieutenant Debra Morgan.

10
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:06,593
If I could have feelings at all,
I'd have them for Deb.

11
00:02:06,713 --> 00:02:08,719
She's the only person
in the world who loves me.

12
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:12,568
You've been the one constantly
good thing in my life.

13
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,258
There's something inside.

14
00:02:15,292 --> 00:02:17,527
Holy frankenfuck!
Snakes!

15
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:19,996
- So it's begun?
- Yes.

16
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,931
It's begun.

17
00:02:21,966 --> 00:02:23,533
No!

18
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,468
Is this Doomsday?

19
00:02:25,502 --> 00:02:27,715
I'm taking a lot of heat on Doomsday.

20
00:02:27,835 --> 00:02:29,093
Are we making headway?

21
00:02:29,213 --> 00:02:30,607
I'm about to interview

22
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,275
my top pick for the detective slot.

23
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:35,274
So far, our Doomsday killer
has given us three tableaus,

24
00:02:35,394 --> 00:02:37,061
most likely referencing Revelation,

25
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,883
Chapters 8 through 10.

26
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,486
- I think I found a new lead.
- Who's this?

27
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,055
The latest and greatest
intern from my forensics class.

28
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:47,077
The game is about homicide,

29
00:02:47,197 --> 00:02:50,726
but in my game,
you can be the serial killer.

30
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,533
I think this is offensive.

31
00:02:52,653 --> 00:02:54,742
Who would choose
to be a serial killer?

32
00:02:56,498 --> 00:02:58,198
Are you out of your mind?

33
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:00,033
You fucked a person of interest?

34
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:01,345
Maybe you're jealous.

35
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:03,201
This is a job of trust,

36
00:03:03,235 --> 00:03:05,214
and I can't have a partner
I can't trust.

37
00:03:05,334 --> 00:03:07,299
I don't know how to act,
I don't know what to do,

38
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,294
- I don't know who to hire.
- Deb, you're too smart

39
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:10,726
to think that this was gonna be easy.

40
00:03:10,761 --> 00:03:13,726
Do you really think that
Matthews made you lieutenant

41
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,026
because you were ready?

42
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,227
It's all politics to get back at me.

43
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,460
Every time the shit
hits the fan, I go to him.

44
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:20,693
He's your safe place.

45
00:03:20,727 --> 00:03:22,060
You're making it sound like

46
00:03:22,094 --> 00:03:24,027
I wanna be with him or something.

47
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:26,197
Well, do you?

48
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:29,492
You didn't really think you
could foil God's plan, did you?

49
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:32,748
I have to stop him.

50
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:33,940
What happened to saving him?

51
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,158
Travis's Dark Passanger
is a part of him.

52
00:03:36,193 --> 00:03:39,058
He can't be saved from it
any more than I can from mine.

53
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,358
- Ugh!
- I think Travis

54
00:03:40,393 --> 00:03:41,841
is gonna kill again.

55
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,814
The eclipse is here, Travis.

56
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:47,325
This is not how it's supposed to be!

57
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:50,058
It's exactly...
as it should be.

58
00:03:55,353 --> 00:03:56,669
Oh, God.

59
00:05:09,523 --> 00:05:12,323
It's simple human nature
to keep little secrets

60
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:13,722
about ourselves.

61
00:05:13,756 --> 00:05:15,583
We all do it.

62
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:19,556
"I dye my hair."

63
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,223
"I watch Internet
pornography."

64
00:05:22,258 --> 00:05:26,224
But what if your whole life
is a secret?

65
00:05:26,258 --> 00:05:27,224
A lie?

66
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:28,624
How can I help you?

67
00:05:28,658 --> 00:05:32,225
One economy class ticket, flight 449.

68
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:35,058
To Budapest.

69
00:05:35,092 --> 00:05:36,391
Correct.

70
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:37,658
And exposing the truth

71
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,359
could destroy everything you are.

72
00:05:39,393 --> 00:05:40,525
What do you do?

73
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:43,026
Run?

74
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,093
Oh, God.

75
00:05:48,195 --> 00:05:50,493
Get the fuck away from the body.

76
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:51,660
Deb, it's me.

77
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:53,894
Who's on the altar?

78
00:05:53,928 --> 00:05:55,950
Travis Marshall.

79
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:58,845
Dexter, what the fuck?

80
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,043
Oh, shit.

81
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:04,942
Talk to me!

82
00:06:06,374 --> 00:06:07,807
Would you lower your gun?

83
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:10,839
Please?

84
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:19,002
I came to do one last forensics sweep

85
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:22,134
like you asked me to do.

86
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:24,599
Travis was here.
He came at me with his sword.

87
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,498
I fought him off.

88
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:30,164
I knocked him out.

89
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:32,163
How did he end up

90
00:06:32,197 --> 00:06:34,095
wrapped in plastic on the altar?

91
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,459
I snapped.

92
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:40,458
You snapped?

93
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,158
What the fuck does that mean?

94
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,588
There's been a lot of anger
inside me since Rita died,

95
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:50,754
and when I looked at Travis

96
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:54,753
and thought about everything he did...

97
00:06:54,787 --> 00:06:57,617
I wanted him dead, so I killed him.

98
00:07:00,751 --> 00:07:05,449
That still doesn't explain
why he's wrapped up like that.

99
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:11,327
I didn't even think about it.

100
00:07:13,362 --> 00:07:15,262
I'm a forensics expert.

101
00:07:15,296 --> 00:07:18,797
I guess it's just second nature
not to leave a trace.

102
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:21,331
Jesus, Dex.

103
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:26,334
Why the fuck didn't you call me?

104
00:07:27,802 --> 00:07:31,670
I wasn't exactly
in the best state of mind.

105
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:41,641
- Are you hurt?
- No.

106
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:45,043
Physically, I'm okay.

107
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,150
- Who are you calling?
- The station.

108
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,484
I've gotta get everyone down here.

109
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,551
No.

110
00:07:58,585 --> 00:08:01,086
Th--please--wait.

111
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:05,821
Why?

112
00:08:05,856 --> 00:08:07,856
How does this look?

113
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,691
- Pretty fucking weird.
- Exactly.

114
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,729
An investigation
could complicate our lives

115
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,997
more than either of us
are prepared to deal with.

116
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,998
But it was self-defense.

117
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:30,067
Yeah.

118
00:08:38,439 --> 00:08:41,173
But it's pretty fucking weird.

119
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,077
I have to call this in.

120
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:54,481
You had a moment
of temporary insanity.

121
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:57,450
We can fix this.

122
00:08:57,484 --> 00:08:58,784
How?

123
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:03,721
I'll get you the best fucking
lawyer in the city.

124
00:09:03,755 --> 00:09:06,589
Even if I'm lucky enough

125
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:08,323
to get off due to temporary insanity,

126
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:11,826
they'll still put me
in some psych ward.

127
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,862
I'll lose my job, my career...

128
00:09:17,998 --> 00:09:20,866
and probably even Harrison.

129
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:30,905
So what, then?

130
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:34,440
Travis is dead.

131
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:38,409
- Yes.
- Nothing's gonna change that.

132
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:43,879
Maybe we should just
get rid of the body.

133
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:48,248
- What?
- I could put it in my car

134
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:49,882
and take it somewhere and dump it

135
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:51,850
where no one would ever find it.

136
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:53,288
- No.
- If I'm careful--

137
00:09:53,322 --> 00:09:54,728
No! Use your head.

138
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:55,897
If you get caught with the body,

139
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:58,700
everything's ten times worse.

140
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:01,202
We're not moving
the fucking body anywhere.

141
00:10:01,237 --> 00:10:03,071
Okay.

142
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,918
We make it look like a suicide.

143
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:22,525
Frustrated that the world
didn't end like he predicted,

144
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,295
Travis committed ritual suicide
at the church altar,

145
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,998
stabbing himself with his sword.

146
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:34,570
Maybe.

147
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:37,439
But not before first setting
the church on fire.

148
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:42,611
Fire.

149
00:10:42,645 --> 00:10:44,112
It's biblical.

150
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,318
One last tableau.

151
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,653
And it'll erase any trace
that we were ever here.

152
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:54,122
How do we do that?

153
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:56,458
It would have to burn so fast.

154
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:59,628
Gasoline.
There's a station nearby.

155
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:12,642
I'll go get a couple of gallons.

156
00:11:12,676 --> 00:11:14,978
No, Deb, go home.

157
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:18,348
I'll do it.
I know what I'm doing.

158
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,585
Bullshit.

159
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:31,994
Jesus, Debra.

160
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:37,066
That's a good doggy.
Uh-huh.

161
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,303
Hey, dad.
His name is Banjo.

162
00:11:40,337 --> 00:11:42,705
Where the hell did that dog come from?

163
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,307
The Millikans' dog had a litter.

164
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:47,310
- I couldn't resist.
- No dogs in this house--ever.

165
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:49,078
- But why?
- Because...

166
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:51,214
Oh, Harry, look how much
Debra loves--

167
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:55,819
End of discussion.

168
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,153
Dexter.

169
00:11:57,188 --> 00:12:00,323
Don't even think about it.

170
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:03,826
I have to do whatever it takes

171
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:06,395
to keep Deb from the full truth.

172
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,598
I have to keep my secret safe.

173
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:19,075
Otherwise, my life, her life

174
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,411
will never be the same.

175
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:58,980
Oh, fuck, Dexter,

176
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:00,815
I don't know if this
was the right thing to do.

177
00:13:00,849 --> 00:13:04,752
It's only a matter of time
before we get called back here.

178
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:06,087
- We have to go.
- Go where?

179
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,890
- Go home.
- I don't want to be alone.

180
00:13:08,924 --> 00:13:10,925
I don't want you to be alone.

181
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,062
Well, just follow me.
We can't stay here.

182
00:13:31,947 --> 00:13:33,514
This is all wrong.

183
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,449
I should be on my boat right now

184
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:37,084
dumping the bags overboard.

185
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:39,253
I can't let this get away from me.

186
00:13:55,136 --> 00:13:58,137
Morgan.

187
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,944
All right, everyone knows their jobs.

188
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,778
Let's do this.

189
00:14:17,654 --> 00:14:21,123
The arson investigator
said the fire started

190
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:22,724
somewhere in the middle of the church.

191
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,326
The melted remains of a gas can

192
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,328
seem to confirm that.

193
00:14:26,362 --> 00:14:28,063
I was also able to get one fingerprint

194
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:30,565
that does give us
preliminary confirmation

195
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,768
that this is Travis Marshall.

196
00:14:32,802 --> 00:14:35,337
Travis appears to have
doused himself in gasoline

197
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:36,672
as well.

198
00:14:36,706 --> 00:14:38,006
He then climbed up on the altar,

199
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,541
grabbed his sword at the hilt,

200
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:42,644
and plunged it into his heart.

201
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:45,314
One final tableau.

202
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:51,720
He died instantly.

203
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:53,422
Please tell me he at least
felt a little pain.

204
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:54,657
That makes sense.

205
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,092
The world didn't end
like he predicted,

206
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:58,227
so he had to end his.

207
00:14:58,262 --> 00:15:00,496
Good. Saves us the trouble
having to do it.

208
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:03,232
Cheer up, lieutenant.

209
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:05,501
This is a big win.

210
00:15:05,535 --> 00:15:07,670
Would have been better
to catch him alive.

211
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,578
Plastic.

212
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,217
After all he did?
Fuck him.

213
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:23,118
Masuka, Masuka.

214
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:26,189
Is it possible to kill
yourself with a sword?

215
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:27,857
Oh, yeah, sure.

216
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:31,461
The ancient art of hara-kiri
has been well established,

217
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,095
particularly amongst my own ancestors

218
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,865
as a penance for various embarrassing

219
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,367
and humiliating transgressions.

220
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:40,235
Congratulations, lieutenant.

221
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,404
Miami has one less murderer
on the loose.

222
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:44,039
Thank you.

223
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:47,476
There's a large
press gathering outside.

224
00:15:49,246 --> 00:15:53,116
This is a good opportunity
for you to make a statement.

225
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,117
There's still a lot
to be done in here.

226
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:58,922
She's not as comfortable
lying to the world as I am.

227
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,223
It's okay, lieutenant.
You can go.

228
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:02,325
We're just, uh, wrapping things up.

229
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,994
Go talk to them.

230
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:06,296
Come on.
I'll be right behind you.

231
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:07,698
I'll sneak out back.

232
00:16:07,732 --> 00:16:09,566
If the press sees me,
they'll only want to talk to me,

233
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,136
and you're the hero this time.

234
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,116
Yeah, but it's more heroic
if you don't get mad.

235
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,585
Lieutenant--

236
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,954
- Hey--
- What happened?

237
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:55,682
Hey, you.
Come here.

238
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,287
Would you make sure this gets logged?

239
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,322
Thanks.

240
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,894
Even if I put Deb
in the uncomfortable position

241
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:11,296
of lying for me,

242
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,564
at least I've kept
the bigger truth from her.

243
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,334
It'll all be okay.

244
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,538
Oh, hey, Dexter.

245
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,175
What are you doing here?

246
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,711
Uh, Jamie's putting Harrison to bed.

247
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,980
I didn't want to wake him.

248
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,884
So you used my computer
without my permission?

249
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,053
I just wanted to check
the basketball scores.

250
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:37,222
- I thought it would be okay.
- It's not okay.

251
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,992
Well, I'm really--
really sorry.

252
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:42,060
I don't give a shit
if you're sorry, Louis.

253
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,263
Never touch my things.

254
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:46,999
Louis, here you are.

255
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,836
- Yeah, here he is.
- What are you doing here?

256
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,506
This is Dexter's side
of the apartment.

257
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,875
I didn't realize
there were different sides.

258
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,877
I'm, like,
super-sorry.

259
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:02,549
- Is Harrison asleep?
- Yeah. He's out.

260
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,919
- You should go home.
- Okay.

261
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,460
Shit.

262
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:56,174
It'll all be okay.

263
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:15,227
You know, everyone acts like

264
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:17,162
Dexter's such a great guy,

265
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,465
but he's really kind of
a pompous jerk, don't you think?

266
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,469
Uh, no.

267
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:25,471
Come on.

268
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,740
He's all like,
"Don't touch my shit, man."

269
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:29,341
What a dick.

270
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,144
Louis.
What is your problem?

271
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:35,714
Dexter's my boss, okay?

272
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:37,750
And he happens to be very good to me.

273
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:39,318
I still don't understand

274
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,353
why you were on his side
of the apartment.

275
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,489
I told you.

276
00:19:43,523 --> 00:19:44,690
I just wanted to get some water.

277
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,025
Right.

278
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:49,495
You know, the more I get to know you,

279
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,497
the weirder and weirder you get.

280
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,463
We go live to this
Breaking News 9 special report.

281
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:31,801
I can only speculate,
but I think it's fair to say

282
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:34,537
that Travis Marshall
felt the intense pressure

283
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,806
of Miami Metro zeroing in on him,

284
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,542
and that led to his decision
to commit suicide.

285
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:41,211
Lieutenant Morgan, are you ruling out

286
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:43,246
the possibility
that this was a murder?

287
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:51,088
- Hey, Mike.
- Just had a thought.

288
00:20:51,123 --> 00:20:52,724
Where was his car?

289
00:20:52,758 --> 00:20:55,493
- Whose car?
- Travis Marshall's.

290
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:57,963
His car wasn't found at the scene,

291
00:20:57,997 --> 00:21:00,566
so how'd he get to the church?

292
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,968
I'm guessing that a man that was about

293
00:21:03,003 --> 00:21:05,304
to stab himself
in the heart with a sword

294
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:09,742
probably wouldn't see
a long walk as a big deal.

295
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,410
Ah, probably right,

296
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:13,479
but...still.

297
00:21:13,513 --> 00:21:15,614
Sure. Yeah.
You should check it out.

298
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:18,950
I will.

299
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:21,452
First thing in the morning.

300
00:21:21,487 --> 00:21:23,521
Good night, L.T.

301
00:21:38,202 --> 00:21:39,670
Need some help?

302
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:41,605
No. No, thank you.

303
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,942
It--it's okay.
I can fix it.

304
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:47,810
Relax. I'm a cop.

305
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:49,979
Where's your lug wrench at?

306
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:51,714
No-no!

307
00:22:54,712 --> 00:22:59,049
How were you so perfectly
prepared to kill Travis?

308
00:22:59,083 --> 00:23:01,118
What do you mean?

309
00:23:01,152 --> 00:23:03,053
The plastic wrap?
You just...

310
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:06,189
happened to have that with you?

311
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:07,991
I found it in the storeroom.

312
00:23:08,025 --> 00:23:09,392
What about the knives?

313
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:12,062
You said Travis
came at you with a sword.

314
00:23:12,096 --> 00:23:13,563
Where did you get the knives?

315
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:15,498
There was, like, a whole roll of them.

316
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:18,101
Travis had them with him.
They were his knives.

317
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:21,905
I don't know where he got them from.

318
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,740
You weren't in your regular
work clothes.

319
00:23:25,877 --> 00:23:28,011
You changed.
You had a...

320
00:23:28,046 --> 00:23:30,714
rubber apron.

321
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:34,018
Plastic sleeves.

322
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:42,326
I'm just trying to put this together.

323
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:51,134
Deb, I'm sorry
I put you in this situation.

324
00:23:55,773 --> 00:23:58,108
You look pretty stressed.

325
00:23:58,142 --> 00:23:59,276
Yeah.

326
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,545
But...

327
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:03,446
you know my job can get messy.

328
00:24:03,481 --> 00:24:06,282
I always keep a change
of clothes in my car.

329
00:24:06,317 --> 00:24:10,220
The apron, all that other stuff
is just part of my kit.

330
00:24:10,254 --> 00:24:13,056
Every blood spatter guy's got 'em.

331
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:20,030
What about when you said,
"I know what I'm doing"?

332
00:24:20,065 --> 00:24:22,366
When you tried to get me to go home,

333
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:23,968
you said,
"I know what I'm doing."

334
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:25,303
What did you mean by that?

335
00:24:25,337 --> 00:24:29,507
I meant I work crime scenes every day.

336
00:24:29,542 --> 00:24:31,776
I know what people
like me look for,

337
00:24:31,811 --> 00:24:33,845
so I know what to cover up.

338
00:24:33,879 --> 00:24:36,981
This doesn't feel right.

339
00:24:39,718 --> 00:24:42,253
I know it doesn't.

340
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:53,530
Deb, I never meant to get you involved

341
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:56,533
in any of this.

342
00:25:01,373 --> 00:25:03,340
But I am.

343
00:25:13,151 --> 00:25:15,686
We gotta go to work.

344
00:25:29,868 --> 00:25:32,202
What's wrong?

345
00:25:32,237 --> 00:25:34,171
We had to give Banjo back.

346
00:25:34,205 --> 00:25:36,307
I am so sorry, sweetheart.

347
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:39,543
I never should have gotten him
without talking to your dad.

348
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:40,845
This is all my fault.

349
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:43,614
I want Banjo back.

350
00:25:43,649 --> 00:25:46,351
No. It's all my fault.

351
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:56,427
Deb,

352
00:25:56,461 --> 00:25:59,130
look, I made a huge mistake.
I admit it.

353
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:01,832
But other than saying
I'm sorry again and again,

354
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:04,635
I don't know what else to say.

355
00:26:07,772 --> 00:26:09,706
Morgan.
What?

356
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:12,542
When?

357
00:26:12,576 --> 00:26:14,277
Jesus fuck!

358
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:16,946
That was dispatch.
Mike's been shot.

359
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,614
- Is he okay?
- I don't know.

360
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:20,949
- I'm right behind you.
- Now, Dex!

361
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:24,753
Deb, I gotta...find my keys,
put my bag together.

362
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:27,689
I'll get dispatch
to text me the address.

363
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:29,558
I'll be two minutes behind you.

364
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:44,906
My getaway pack.

365
00:26:48,611 --> 00:26:52,281
I don't want to run.

366
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:53,849
But if Deb doesn't let up,

367
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:56,318
that may be my only option.

368
00:27:20,143 --> 00:27:23,378
Mike Anderson.
One of our own.

369
00:27:24,981 --> 00:27:27,082
Whoever did this to Mike

370
00:27:27,116 --> 00:27:28,349
is gonna be very sorry.

371
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:31,252
He'll be very fuckin' dead.

372
00:27:31,287 --> 00:27:34,656
Hey. We do everything
by the book.

373
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,324
We're cops, not killers.

374
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,696
But being a killer would feel
so very good right about now.

375
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:46,001
She suffered blunt force
trauma to the head...

376
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:49,104
from something...
narrow and cylindrical.

377
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:50,706
Steel pipe?
Tire iron?

378
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:52,942
Yeah. Something like that.

379
00:27:52,976 --> 00:27:55,979
The first blow
was the left side of the head,

380
00:27:56,013 --> 00:28:00,083
and then three more blows
to the top, much harder.

381
00:28:00,118 --> 00:28:02,519
She--her skull was fractured

382
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:04,355
and she hemorrhaged,

383
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:07,859
as evidenced by the blood
that's trickling from her ear.

384
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,331
When will she believe me?

385
00:28:13,365 --> 00:28:15,467
What happens if she never does?

386
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:18,904
When do you think she bought it?

387
00:28:18,938 --> 00:28:20,572
Rigor has set in.

388
00:28:20,607 --> 00:28:21,974
She hasn't been moved from this trunk.

389
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:24,076
And judging from the lividity

390
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,712
and pooling on the right
side of her face and torso,

391
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,379
I'd say 8 to 12 hours ago.

392
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:30,682
Not long after we all left the church.

393
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:34,686
Yeah.

394
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,688
What a fucked up couple of days.

395
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:40,092
I couldn't agree with you
more, Lieutenant.

396
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,430
We're looking
for one shooter at a minimum.

397
00:28:45,464 --> 00:28:48,700
The shooter hits this girl,
dumps her in the trunk,

398
00:28:48,734 --> 00:28:50,836
- speeds off.
- Gets a flat tire.

399
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,404
He repays Mike's kindness

400
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:54,506
by shooting him
and fleeing in Mike's car.

401
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,575
His car was found
in an industrial park

402
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,576
near north west
fifty-second.

403
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,378
I've got people there.
We'll start canvassing.

404
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:02,447
And here?
Any witnesses?

405
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:04,449
None so far.

406
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:07,252
Maybe somebody saw something.

407
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,154
I'm on my way to talk to Mike's wife.

408
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:10,790
All of her family's in Chicago,

409
00:29:10,824 --> 00:29:12,859
and she's gonna need all our support.

410
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:14,227
Anything she needs.

411
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:16,697
Hopefully Dexter and I
will win the DNA lottery

412
00:29:16,731 --> 00:29:18,932
with our swabs, 'cause it looks
like he wiped the car clean.

413
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,435
Nothing on prints except for hers.

414
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,105
Well, judging by her attire,
or lack of it,

415
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:26,541
she was a stripper.

416
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:29,377
And on duty at the time of her death.

417
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:31,379
I've got an I.D.
on the fingerprints.

418
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:32,981
Kaja Soroka.

419
00:29:33,015 --> 00:29:35,382
Same person this car's registered to.

420
00:29:35,417 --> 00:29:37,951
We'll find out where she works.

421
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:41,087
Steering wheel, shifter, door handles,

422
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:43,456
seatbelt buckle--
they're all wiped clean.

423
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,958
But there's always one place
they forget to clean--

424
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,093
the turn signal.

425
00:30:21,664 --> 00:30:23,531
- You're clear.
- Oh, f-fuck.

426
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:24,933
The road's clear.

427
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:28,670
Thank you.

428
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:38,048
Fuck!

429
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:08,046
Excuse me.

430
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,715
I need to see the files
on the Ice Truck Killer case.

431
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:13,484
- Row F-17.
- Thank you.

432
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:19,114
Kaja Soroka was a Ukrainian national

433
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:20,949
here on a work visa.

434
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:23,652
She worked at the Fox Hole
Gentleman's Club in Pinecrest.

435
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:25,621
Now, the same owner
is listed as having

436
00:32:25,655 --> 00:32:27,656
five other strip clubs in Miami.

437
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:29,525
We looked into them
when I was with narcotics.

438
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,593
Figured they were using
the places to launder money,

439
00:32:31,627 --> 00:32:33,328
but we never got anywhere with it.

440
00:32:33,362 --> 00:32:35,063
Let's get somewhere now.

441
00:32:35,097 --> 00:32:36,731
Quinn and I is gonna
take the fox hole.

442
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:39,100
The rest of you split up
the rest of the clubs.

443
00:32:39,134 --> 00:32:40,401
Let's go.

444
00:32:40,435 --> 00:32:42,937
All the prints belong to Miss Soroka

445
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:46,007
except the one from the turn signal.

446
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:47,408
But there aren't any matches

447
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:51,279
in Florida AFIS, FBI, or DHS.

448
00:32:52,881 --> 00:32:55,283
There's always Interpol.

449
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:07,662
I had this weird flashback
of being on Rudy's tabl--

450
00:33:07,697 --> 00:33:09,030
Brian's tabl--

451
00:33:09,065 --> 00:33:11,300
whatever the fuck
you want to call him.

452
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:13,468
Your brother's table.

453
00:33:13,502 --> 00:33:15,870
Sorry. That must have felt
not good for you.

454
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:18,673
It didn't.

455
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,642
But what bothers me about it

456
00:33:20,677 --> 00:33:23,812
is that I was set up on that table

457
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:27,182
the same way Travis Marshall
was set up on the altar.

458
00:33:27,216 --> 00:33:28,383
Deb...

459
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:30,018
I mean, how do you explain that?

460
00:33:30,053 --> 00:33:32,287
I don't know.

461
00:33:32,322 --> 00:33:34,991
I was there too.

462
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:37,026
But I pulled you off that table.

463
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,495
I was on that table.

464
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:41,331
I almost died on that table.

465
00:33:41,366 --> 00:33:44,668
You would think that I would
remember every fucking detail.

466
00:33:44,703 --> 00:33:48,006
But even I don't remember it
that clearly.

467
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:52,810
Dexter, you were somehow able
to perfectly duplicate

468
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:54,378
how he set everything up--

469
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:57,582
the same positioning,

470
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,550
the same amount of plastic wrap.

471
00:33:59,585 --> 00:34:02,987
They are the same, Dexter.
They are exactly...

472
00:34:03,022 --> 00:34:04,355
the same.

473
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,292
Because Brian was imitating me.

474
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:10,729
This is crazy, Deb.

475
00:34:10,763 --> 00:34:12,164
I know that.

476
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:13,765
It's crazy that I did what I did.

477
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,168
It's crazy that you just
happened to walk in

478
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:18,670
and see me doing it.

479
00:34:18,704 --> 00:34:21,139
And what were you doing
in the church, anyway?

480
00:34:22,908 --> 00:34:24,943
Just...

481
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:29,380
I-I was just fucking

482
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:32,249
checking to see
if everything was okay.

483
00:34:35,486 --> 00:34:37,788
I'm sorry for all the questions.

484
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:40,357
I'm just--Dexter, I'm...

485
00:34:40,391 --> 00:34:42,959
I'm trying to make sense of this.

486
00:34:42,993 --> 00:34:44,861
Deb, it's not gonna make sense.

487
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:00,443
Did you find anything in the car?

488
00:35:00,477 --> 00:35:02,011
No, not yet.

489
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,424
Give up, Deb.

490
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:17,428
Give up and just leave this alone.

491
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:24,135
We have a match.

492
00:35:27,106 --> 00:35:31,443
Viktor Baskov.

493
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:34,112
When you're losing control
of your entire life,

494
00:35:34,146 --> 00:35:36,447
it helps to focus on
what you're good at--

495
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:39,049
my little secret.

496
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:21,156
I shouldn't be doing a kill now.

497
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:29,198
The irony is that's the only way
I can maintain control,

498
00:36:29,232 --> 00:36:31,533
the only way I can keep this from Deb.

499
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,905
Someone packed in a hurry.

500
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:39,442
Blood...

501
00:36:43,847 --> 00:36:45,013
and gunshot residue.

502
00:36:45,048 --> 00:36:47,182
Looks like you're our man, Viktor.

503
00:36:49,418 --> 00:36:52,554
How careless were you, Viktor?

504
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:55,690
One first class one-way ticket
to Kiev, Ukraine

505
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:58,193
leaving in less than two hours.

506
00:36:58,227 --> 00:37:00,728
Very careless.

507
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:09,337
How can I help you?

508
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:12,940
One economy class ticket, flight 449.

509
00:37:12,974 --> 00:37:15,776
To Budapest.

510
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:17,178
Correct.

511
00:37:17,212 --> 00:37:20,547
That would be $1,890, please,
Mr. Hartwell.

512
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,883
Ha. Dog track.

513
00:37:23,918 --> 00:37:26,553
- Lucky you.
- Yeah, lucky me.

514
00:37:27,821 --> 00:37:29,455
- You're all set.
- Thank you.

515
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,426
Step through.

516
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,095
- Please wait.
- Wait, sir.

517
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,763
What are these for?

518
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,865
Diabetes.
I have a prescription

519
00:37:39,899 --> 00:37:41,934
if you want to see it.

520
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,835
Go ahead.

521
00:37:57,017 --> 00:37:59,451
Hello, Viktor.

522
00:38:04,357 --> 00:38:06,258
Right here, sweetheart.

523
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:15,633
Kill the music.

524
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,101
Good afternoon, everyone.

525
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:20,171
I'm Sergeant Batista
from Miami Metro homicide.

526
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:23,641
We are investigating
the suspected homicide

527
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:26,109
of one Kaja Soroka...

528
00:38:26,144 --> 00:38:29,179
As well as the homicide
of a Miami Metro police officer,

529
00:38:29,213 --> 00:38:31,948
and no one is leaving until
they've been questioned.

530
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:34,351
Employees of the club
up against this wall,

531
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:36,587
and the rest of you perverts
up against this wall.

532
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:38,422
Is there a manager here?

533
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:40,758
Yeah, I'm the manager.

534
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:42,193
George Novikov.

535
00:38:42,227 --> 00:38:44,028
Oh, my God.

536
00:38:44,063 --> 00:38:45,964
An employee and a pervert.

537
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:47,499
I don't know which wall you go to.

538
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:48,700
You know this guy?

539
00:38:48,735 --> 00:38:50,302
Yeah, he was
a low-level scumbag.

540
00:38:50,336 --> 00:38:52,304
Now I guess
he's a mid-level scumbag.

541
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:54,006
Nice to see you, Detective Quinn.

542
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:59,678
What can you tell me about
Miss Soroka?

543
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,381
Kaja wasn't the smartest girl
in the world.

544
00:39:02,415 --> 00:39:03,682
No?

545
00:39:03,716 --> 00:39:05,884
These girls come here from
their little villages,

546
00:39:05,919 --> 00:39:07,385
still stinking of cow shit.

547
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,121
They think they're gonna land
some rich American husband.

548
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:11,456
They hook up with the wrong guys,

549
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,557
they end up over their heads.

550
00:39:12,592 --> 00:39:13,625
Is that what you think happened?

551
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,194
I really have no idea what happened.

552
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:20,065
Look, I'm sorry Kaja's dead, you know?

553
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:21,699
She was a sweet kid.

554
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,503
And I'm sorry about
your police officer too.

555
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:26,505
But their deaths
have nothing to do with us.

556
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:28,306
Perhaps we can start
with you supplying me

557
00:39:28,341 --> 00:39:30,208
with a list of all of your employees.

558
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:31,744
Sure.

559
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:34,580
Can I get a head-count list
to main bar?

560
00:39:34,614 --> 00:39:36,482
Something cold to drink, detective?

561
00:39:36,516 --> 00:39:37,850
Your name, please?

562
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:40,253
Foxy Raven.

563
00:39:41,756 --> 00:39:44,558
Is that the name your mother gave you?

564
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:47,460
Maybe you could show me
some form of ID.

565
00:39:47,495 --> 00:39:49,996
I do not speak English.

566
00:39:50,031 --> 00:39:52,733
No, of course you don't.

567
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:55,135
One of our guys found blood
outside the door.

568
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,267
Excuse me, sir,
I have your wheelchair.

569
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:28,904
I don't need a wheel...

570
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:44,120
It never matters your destination.

571
00:40:44,155 --> 00:40:45,923
The smart traveler must be prepared

572
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:48,926
to make last-minute adjustments.

573
00:41:08,447 --> 00:41:10,114
Lieutenant, you got a second?

574
00:41:10,149 --> 00:41:11,950
Yeah, what's up?

575
00:41:11,984 --> 00:41:13,918
We shut down the strip club,

576
00:41:13,953 --> 00:41:15,487
questioned everyone,
but didn't get shit.

577
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:16,821
We know she worked last night.

578
00:41:16,856 --> 00:41:18,923
She signed in at 10:00,
never signed out.

579
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:20,759
And we found blood in the parking lot

580
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:22,828
which we believe belongs
to Miss Soroka.

581
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:25,130
But with all that, we still
haven't gotten anywhere.

582
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:26,832
- No one saw her leave?
- No.

583
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:29,101
No one remembers any customers
she might have talked to.

584
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:31,504
No one remembers seeing her car
in the parking lot.

585
00:41:31,538 --> 00:41:32,705
No one saw shit.

586
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,807
And it's like she's a fucking ghost

587
00:41:34,841 --> 00:41:36,208
- in a G-string.
- That's bullshit.

588
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,944
She walked out of a packed club
in the middle of her shift.

589
00:41:37,978 --> 00:41:38,978
Someone saw something.

590
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:40,480
These places
are all mobbed up--

591
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:42,015
Russian, Ukrainian organized crime.

592
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:43,683
Those strippers were brought in there.

593
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:45,018
They know not to talk.

594
00:41:45,052 --> 00:41:46,219
How would you like us to proceed?

595
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:47,854
Shut down every one of their clubs

596
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,522
every night of the week
until someone talks.

597
00:41:49,556 --> 00:41:50,857
Okay.
We're on it.

598
00:41:50,891 --> 00:41:52,292
I'm gonna need more coffee.
Coffee truck?

599
00:41:52,326 --> 00:41:54,460
I already got so much caffeine
in my head,

600
00:41:54,495 --> 00:41:55,862
I can barely think straight.

601
00:41:55,896 --> 00:41:57,163
You know what,

602
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:58,865
you're not gonna get anything
done tonight.

603
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,234
Just go home.

604
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,004
It's been a very long,
very fucked up day.

605
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:07,207
I'm too worked up to sleep,
but I could use a drink.

606
00:42:07,242 --> 00:42:09,876
Wanna head across the street,
knock one back in Mike's honor?

607
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,545
- Lead the way.
- You're coming, lieutenant?

608
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:14,147
Rain check.
But slam a double for me.

609
00:42:14,182 --> 00:42:15,416
Sure.

610
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,017
- Good night.
- Night.

611
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:18,585
Good night.

612
00:42:23,257 --> 00:42:24,758
What's up, lieutenant?

613
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,159
Any progress?

614
00:42:26,193 --> 00:42:28,362
We know our shooter was wearing

615
00:42:28,396 --> 00:42:31,565
size ten Prada shoes, very pricey.

616
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,433
We know he was right-handed.

617
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,836
So that narrows it down to about

618
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,104
800 million people.

619
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:38,905
- Dexter here?
- No.

620
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,775
I told him I'd work late
if he came in early.

621
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,783
Scotch and whatever my friend
is having.

622
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,185
I'll have a vodka.

623
00:42:51,219 --> 00:42:52,720
Don't you mean Shirley Temple?

624
00:42:52,754 --> 00:42:55,055
What?
I can't toast to Mike?

625
00:42:58,627 --> 00:43:00,027
To Mike.

626
00:43:00,061 --> 00:43:01,762
To Mike.

627
00:43:05,733 --> 00:43:07,367
What if your union rep sees you?

628
00:43:07,402 --> 00:43:08,969
Aren't you in some kind of program?

629
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,204
- I start next week.
- That's good.

630
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:12,605
The sooner you address
your problem the better,

631
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,040
'cause I'm tired of your bullshit.

632
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:15,442
Is there a reason why you're
still breaking my balls?

633
00:43:15,476 --> 00:43:16,710
You lose one girlfriend,

634
00:43:16,744 --> 00:43:18,045
and the wheels completely come off.

635
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,246
I'm a sensitive guy.

636
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,949
I lost two wives
and countless girlfriends,

637
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,051
and somehow I managed
to keep my shit together.

638
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:25,952
Yeah, I wish my life
was more like yours.

639
00:43:25,987 --> 00:43:27,420
I mean, you're living a fucking dream.

640
00:43:27,455 --> 00:43:28,655
Keep it up.

641
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,156
I'll put it for that transfer
after all.

642
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,391
I don't care what the union
says--I'll make it happen.

643
00:43:32,426 --> 00:43:36,095
I thought you already
put in for my transfer.

644
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:38,163
I didn't quite get around to it.

645
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,731
So you were just fucking with me?

646
00:43:39,766 --> 00:43:40,899
You don't want me to leave.

647
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:42,567
You were only trying
to get me to shape up.

648
00:43:42,602 --> 00:43:44,603
A lot of good that did.

649
00:43:44,637 --> 00:43:47,639
- You still fucking love me.
- Fuck you.

650
00:43:47,673 --> 00:43:48,974
I try to help you,

651
00:43:49,008 --> 00:43:50,308
and you go running to your union rep

652
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:51,976
like a little bitch.

653
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:53,978
That was weak.

654
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:56,114
- Well, actually...
- What?

655
00:43:56,148 --> 00:43:58,016
I plan on talking to him

656
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,684
as soon as I find out who he is.

657
00:43:59,718 --> 00:44:02,620
What about this program thing
you're in?

658
00:44:02,655 --> 00:44:04,322
That's bullshit.
You know I don't have

659
00:44:04,356 --> 00:44:05,757
a drinking problem.

660
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:08,260
Or maybe that's just me
in denial--who knows?

661
00:44:08,294 --> 00:44:09,995
We may never get
to the bottom of this.

662
00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:12,631
Yeah, do what--
just deal with your shit.

663
00:44:12,665 --> 00:44:16,435
Mike was a hundred times better
cop than we'll ever be.

664
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:19,004
I'll drink to that.

665
00:44:30,383 --> 00:44:33,551
Hello, Viktor.

666
00:44:33,586 --> 00:44:37,022
Where am I?

667
00:44:37,056 --> 00:44:40,158
You're in a place where things
are forgotten.

668
00:44:42,228 --> 00:44:45,730
Never to be used or seen
or touched again.

669
00:44:47,667 --> 00:44:50,869
It seems fitting for a cop killer.

670
00:44:50,903 --> 00:44:55,039
Not to dismiss Kaja Soroka.
She counts too.

671
00:44:55,073 --> 00:44:56,040
Who are you?

672
00:44:56,074 --> 00:44:57,908
Good question.

673
00:45:00,078 --> 00:45:03,680
It all depends on who you ask.

674
00:45:03,714 --> 00:45:05,949
Who sent you?

675
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:07,717
Hmm?

676
00:45:07,751 --> 00:45:10,085
You should not fuck with me.

677
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,454
I have very dangerous friends.

678
00:45:12,488 --> 00:45:14,590
If you knew how many times
I've heard that

679
00:45:14,624 --> 00:45:16,091
over the years....

680
00:45:16,126 --> 00:45:17,693
What do you want?
Money?

681
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,728
I can get you a lot of money.

682
00:45:19,763 --> 00:45:20,963
I've heard that a lot too.

683
00:45:20,997 --> 00:45:22,732
Why are you doing this?

684
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:24,267
You want the long version?

685
00:45:24,301 --> 00:45:26,469
That could take a couple of hours.

686
00:45:26,503 --> 00:45:27,837
Short version.

687
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,010
Because I have to.
Because I need control.

688
00:45:37,147 --> 00:45:41,017
I'm trying to make things
go back to the way they were.

689
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:44,220
You are crazy.

690
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:47,390
There's really no need
for name calling, Viktor.

691
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:57,701
Is there anything I can do
to keep you from killing me?

692
00:45:57,735 --> 00:45:58,935
No.

693
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:01,471
Then get it over with!

694
00:46:05,309 --> 00:46:08,278
Normally, I don't take orders.

695
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:11,281
But in this case...

696
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:24,395
How can I help you?

697
00:46:29,669 --> 00:46:30,936
This is Isaak.

698
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,205
Viktor left on an evening flight.

699
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:36,475
He arrives in Kiev at 5:25 P.M.,
your time.

700
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:38,143
Good.

701
00:46:38,178 --> 00:46:40,145
What about the dead police officer?

702
00:46:40,179 --> 00:46:41,880
It's still a problem,

703
00:46:41,914 --> 00:46:45,784
but they don't have shit on us, so...

704
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:47,219
I'll make it go away.

705
00:46:47,254 --> 00:46:48,654
Good.

706
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,968
Ridding the world of people
like Viktor

707
00:47:02,002 --> 00:47:04,537
is the one thing I'm good at.

708
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:07,340
And when I'm stressed near
to the breaking point like now,

709
00:47:07,375 --> 00:47:09,209
it centers me.

710
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,612
Maybe nothing has to change with Deb.

711
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:54,991
Hello?

712
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:57,727
Hi, Jamie.
Is Dexter there?

713
00:47:57,761 --> 00:47:58,894
It's Deb.

714
00:47:58,929 --> 00:48:01,764
No, he's working late.

715
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:03,399
He's at work?

716
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:05,000
Mm-hmm, yeah.

717
00:48:05,035 --> 00:48:06,802
He said with Mike's shooting
and everything,

718
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:08,804
he might be there all night.

719
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:10,673
Oh, yeah, right.

720
00:48:10,707 --> 00:48:14,811
Um, does that happen a lot?

721
00:48:17,314 --> 00:48:19,516
I mean, I know I should know
his hours and everything.

722
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:22,585
It's just that I'm always
juggling things, so...

723
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:25,689
Oh, yeah, he works crazy hours.

724
00:48:25,723 --> 00:48:29,659
Lots of nights
till 3:00, 4:00 A.M.

725
00:48:32,262 --> 00:48:34,363
All right.
Okay, thanks.

726
00:48:34,398 --> 00:48:37,233
Do you want me to have him call you?

727
00:48:37,268 --> 00:48:39,302
No.
Um...

728
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:41,638
No, I'll see him at work tomorrow.

729
00:48:41,672 --> 00:48:42,972
Okay.

730
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,741
Good night.

731
00:49:07,966 --> 00:49:09,333
What's his name?

732
00:49:09,368 --> 00:49:11,302
Banjo.

733
00:49:11,336 --> 00:49:12,970
Are you okay?

734
00:49:13,004 --> 00:49:14,138
No.

735
00:49:14,172 --> 00:49:16,974
Why did daddy take
the real Banjo away?

736
00:49:17,008 --> 00:49:18,576
What did I do wrong?

737
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:20,511
You didn't do anything.

738
00:49:20,545 --> 00:49:22,813
It's me.
It's my fault.

739
00:49:22,847 --> 00:49:24,949
Why?
What did you do?

740
00:49:27,652 --> 00:49:29,987
Dexter's allergic to dogs, sweetie.

741
00:49:30,022 --> 00:49:32,590
That's why we can't have them.

742
00:49:34,994 --> 00:49:37,128
Sorry.

743
00:49:37,162 --> 00:49:39,697
What were you going to tell her?

744
00:49:39,731 --> 00:49:42,366
- The truth.
- What is the truth?

745
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:44,369
That you got rid of the dog

746
00:49:44,403 --> 00:49:46,004
'cause you thought I might kill it.

747
00:49:46,038 --> 00:49:47,338
But I wouldn't.

748
00:49:47,373 --> 00:49:49,140
I couldn't take that chance.

749
00:49:49,174 --> 00:49:51,176
But what's more important

750
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:55,546
is that you mustn't ever tell
Debra the truth about yourself.

751
00:49:55,581 --> 00:49:56,647
Why?

752
00:49:56,682 --> 00:49:59,083
If you think she's upset now,

753
00:49:59,118 --> 00:50:01,252
that's nothing compared
to how she'd feel

754
00:50:01,287 --> 00:50:03,454
if she learned what you are.

755
00:50:03,488 --> 00:50:04,689
She'd be terrified.

756
00:50:04,723 --> 00:50:06,858
But she loves me.

757
00:50:06,892 --> 00:50:09,661
Dex, she loves who she thinks you are.

758
00:50:09,695 --> 00:50:13,031
If she ever saw the real you,
she'd never get over it.

759
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:16,834
Son, your mother and I aren't
gonna be around forever.

760
00:50:16,869 --> 00:50:19,270
Someday Debra will be
all you have left.

761
00:50:19,304 --> 00:50:22,473
You don't want to lose her, do you?

762
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,579
My mistake was stepping
outside the code.

763
00:50:29,613 --> 00:50:32,348
I should have killed Travis
the instant I met him

764
00:50:32,382 --> 00:50:34,417
rather than try to save him.

765
00:50:34,451 --> 00:50:36,619
Compassion does not fit me.

766
00:51:05,449 --> 00:51:08,918
- You're ready?
- Yes, I'm ready to join you.

767
00:51:08,953 --> 00:51:12,255
But I can't.
Not Deb.

768
00:51:17,228 --> 00:51:20,263
No. You can't be a killer
and a hero.

769
00:51:36,948 --> 00:51:40,150
Vincent, you're working late.

770
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:42,486
Yeah, well, lots to do.

771
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,555
- Everyone's doing double shifts.
- Hmm.

772
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:46,790
I know you're working on Mike's case

773
00:51:46,825 --> 00:51:48,225
and that's top priority,

774
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:50,060
but I was wondering
if anyone had a chance

775
00:51:50,095 --> 00:51:51,829
to go through the evidence
from the church.

776
00:51:51,863 --> 00:51:52,896
Sorry.

777
00:51:52,931 --> 00:51:54,865
It's all in those boxes over there,

778
00:51:54,899 --> 00:51:56,667
but I'm kind of swamped here.

779
00:51:56,701 --> 00:51:58,268
Of course.

780
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:04,807
Hey, does our forensics team

781
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:06,375
ever take blood slides
at crime scenes?

782
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:07,676
No.

783
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:10,245
If any of the evidence
is transportable, we bag it.

784
00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:11,513
Otherwise, if it's blood,

785
00:52:11,547 --> 00:52:14,515
we absorb it into cotton
squares, then we bag it.

786
00:52:14,550 --> 00:52:16,150
I see.

787
00:52:16,185 --> 00:52:17,518
The only one person who ever
worked at Miami Metro

788
00:52:17,553 --> 00:52:18,786
ever took blood slides.

789
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,021
And that was?

790
00:52:20,055 --> 00:52:21,188
Sergeant Doakes.

791
00:52:21,223 --> 00:52:22,957
And that was only because
of his side gig

792
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:24,892
as the Bay Harbor Butcher.

793
00:52:29,497 --> 00:52:30,831
Right.

794
00:52:30,865 --> 00:52:32,466
Of course, Sergeant Doakes.

795
00:52:34,036 --> 00:52:36,103
Thank you.

796
00:52:36,138 --> 00:52:40,274
None of us want to be fully revealed,

797
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:43,477
all our faults and weaknesses
laid bare for the world to see.

798
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,914
All the more reason to make sure

799
00:52:46,949 --> 00:52:50,552
I never again stray
from what Harry taught me.

800
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:29,291
Did you kill all these people?

801
00:53:34,597 --> 00:53:36,564
I did.

802
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:44,372
Are you--

803
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:48,042
are you a serial killer?

804
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:51,387
Yes.

805
00:53:54,198 --> 00:54:04,790
