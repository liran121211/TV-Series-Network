2
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:43,479
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:45,847
If we're gonna do this,

4
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,350
we're gonna do it all the way.

5
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:48,685
We're gonna eat together.

6
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,554
We're gonna watch TV together.

7
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:53,391
We're gonna drive
to fucking work together.

8
00:01:54,493 --> 00:01:56,561
Why did you send me the hand?

9
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:58,797
I came to you for help with my game

10
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,298
and you said no!

11
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,667
Your game?

12
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:02,902
Uhh!

13
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:06,005
Kaja was dating someone.
Tony Rush.

14
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,474
He's one of the bosses here.

15
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:09,309
The night that Kaja died,

16
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,877
she left the club with Viktor.

17
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:15,049
Viktor never made his flight.

18
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,250
I checked.

19
00:02:16,285 --> 00:02:17,885
Well, I don't understand.

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,320
Where is he, then?

21
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:24,660
You loved her, didn't you?

22
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:26,996
- What?
- Kaja.

23
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,332
Maybe that's why
you talked to the police.

24
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,935
You know what?
I didn't say a word.

25
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,773
This pretty face
belongs to Wayne Randall.

26
00:02:38,808 --> 00:02:41,609
15 years ago, Randall
and his teenage girlfriend

27
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:43,344
went on a three-state
killing spree

28
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:44,712
that ended here in Miami.

29
00:02:44,746 --> 00:02:48,379
Hannah used to think
I was something special.

30
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:51,882
Now she sees me as just a killer.

31
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,051
There's just one last person
I need to kill.

32
00:02:57,088 --> 00:03:01,023
Randall couldn't take life in prison.

33
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:04,059
Can I?

34
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,272
Hey. 'Scuse you.

35
00:03:19,306 --> 00:03:21,774
I feel trapped,
like there's no escape.

36
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:26,245
And it's not because
I'm at the post office.

37
00:03:35,078 --> 00:03:37,978
She's got me penned in
like a caged animal,

38
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:40,015
and an animal is never more dangerous

39
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,050
than when it's backed into a corner.

40
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,395
Dexter.

41
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:56,963
How much longer are you gonna be?

42
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:59,832
We have a briefing in 20 minutes.

43
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll be out in a minute, Deb.

44
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:04,736
Why do you look so guilty?

45
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:05,804
Next.

46
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:07,906
I can't do anything about Deb,

47
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,508
but there's one irritation
I can get rid of.

48
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,344
Louis.

49
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:34,530
The morning briefing.

50
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:36,531
It's the only time Deb's
looking at everyone

51
00:04:36,565 --> 00:04:39,834
and not just me.

52
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:41,068
All right, let's get started.

53
00:04:41,102 --> 00:04:42,202
Batista, where are we

54
00:04:42,237 --> 00:04:43,837
on the Mike Anderson investigation?

55
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:46,206
Specifically with
Baskov Fuckwad-enov over here.

56
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,608
We're still chasing our tail.

57
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:49,676
BOLO turned up squat,

58
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,177
so if Baskov
is still in the U.S.,

59
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:52,845
he's gone way underground.

60
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,047
If he did manage
to leave the country...

61
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:59,451
Okay, he's talking,
but why's she staring at you?

62
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:01,086
All right, well, let's keep digging

63
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,721
around the Russian expat community.

64
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:04,756
If Baskov is hiding out locally,

65
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,190
then someone must be helping him.

66
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,358
As you know, the club's owned

67
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:08,725
by Ukrainian business interests

68
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,228
with suspected ties
to organized crime,

69
00:05:11,262 --> 00:05:13,530
so I wouldn't count on anybody
getting too talkative.

70
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,597
Dude, she's still staring at you.

71
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:15,598
Is she mad at you or what?

72
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:17,534
All right, moving on.
Simms and Miller

73
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,769
brought in a suspect
on the I-95 shooting.

74
00:05:19,803 --> 00:05:22,605
Dexter...I'm gonna need you
to get a standard.

75
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,140
Now I'm definitely picking up
a chill in her voice.

76
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:26,208
You fucked up, didn't you?

77
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,377
You did.
You screwed the Deb pooch.

78
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,216
We're coming up
on the end of the month,

79
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,517
and I noticed that a lot
of you guys are still working

80
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:37,885
a lot of open cases.

81
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,653
If you need help,
if there's anything I can do,

82
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,220
make sure you're asking for it.

83
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:42,689
We need to get our numbers down.

84
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,226
Okay.

85
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:51,362
You're under arrest.
The DNA swab isn't optional.

86
00:05:51,397 --> 00:05:52,463
Fuck you.

87
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,967
Maybe I can get
some uniforms to come in

88
00:05:56,001 --> 00:05:57,968
and hold your mouth open for you.

89
00:05:58,003 --> 00:05:59,770
What's the matter--
you too much of a pussy

90
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,238
to do it yourself?

91
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,740
Hmm?

92
00:06:02,775 --> 00:06:04,575
No, I'm just kind of on edge today.

93
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:06,243
You probably shouldn't push me.

94
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:09,146
Ooh hoo hoo hoo...
I am quakin' in my boots.

95
00:06:13,819 --> 00:06:15,653
What the fuck?

96
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,258
He was being very uncooperative.

97
00:06:20,292 --> 00:06:21,759
- He tried to kill me!
- Shut the fuck up.

98
00:06:21,794 --> 00:06:24,162
Get outside.

99
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:27,465
Help!

100
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:31,937
What the fuck is the matter with you?

101
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,839
- You.
- Me?

102
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:34,873
Watching me all the time.

103
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:36,476
Living with you is driving me crazy.

104
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,278
- I have to watch you, Dexter.
- Why?

105
00:06:38,312 --> 00:06:40,613
When I had the urge to...

106
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:41,881
I called you.

107
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,283
Didn't I?

108
00:06:43,317 --> 00:06:45,386
And you talked me down.
It worked.

109
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:46,688
Why can't you back off?

110
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:47,922
Can you promise me if
that I wasn't on your ass,

111
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,290
that you wouldn't slip?

112
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,959
I can promise you that if you
don't get off my ass,

113
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,694
something bad is gonna happen.

114
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:53,728
What's that supposed to mean?

115
00:06:53,762 --> 00:06:54,996
That if I don't control my need,

116
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,631
it's gonna control me.

117
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:57,765
That's what I am trying
to help you do!

118
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,500
I am trying to help you control it.

119
00:06:59,534 --> 00:07:01,969
No, you're trying to suppress it,

120
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,370
to lock it away.

121
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:04,739
But the lock is not gonna hold.

122
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:06,841
You saw what happened in there.

123
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,144
The only way I can control it
is to channel it

124
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,312
the way Harry taught me.

125
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,316
No, I do not accept that.

126
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,718
Dad was wrong.

127
00:07:14,752 --> 00:07:16,419
I'm not so sure.
Sometimes, I think

128
00:07:16,454 --> 00:07:19,656
he knew me better than I know myself.

129
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:27,364
Think about Harrison.

130
00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:29,432
Think about what you could
be exposing him to.

131
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:32,202
I think about him all the time.

132
00:07:32,236 --> 00:07:35,772
Sooner or later,
this is gonna catch up to you...

133
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:36,940
and to him.

134
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,014
I'll give you some space.

135
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:46,850
I'll back off.

136
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,685
Just hang in there with me, okay?

137
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:09,874
I can't go on like this,
living by Deb's rules.

138
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:18,481
Ray Speltzer.

139
00:08:18,516 --> 00:08:21,451
Just paroled for assault.

140
00:08:21,485 --> 00:08:24,221
But there have been
more serious charges.

141
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:26,790
Ann Feig disappeared

142
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,058
after a date with Speltzer.

143
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,127
And another date,

144
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:31,495
Nina Fleischer, turned up dead,

145
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:34,432
but the police couldn't
make anything stick.

146
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:40,705
Did Nina lose her earring
in the struggle?

147
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:46,845
Speltzer will most likely kill again

148
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,247
unless I take him out.

149
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:55,287
The groundskeeper in a cemetery.

150
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,688
That's appropriate.

151
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:59,324
But he didn't get those muscles
pushing a lawnmower.

152
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:07,266
Speltzer's grown his hair,
but he seems no less hostile.

153
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:10,936
Is Speltzer just blowing off steam,

154
00:09:10,971 --> 00:09:13,005
or is this the ritual he goes through

155
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,006
before he kills?

156
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,610
Hey, Deb.

157
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,279
Hey, what are you up to?

158
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:22,381
I'm just trying out a new gym.

159
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,950
What's wrong wit the old one?

160
00:09:23,984 --> 00:09:26,152
Well, this one has a smoothie bar.

161
00:09:28,322 --> 00:09:30,056
Yeah. Ahh.

162
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,058
Look, I gotta go.

163
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:32,492
I wanna keep my heart rate up.

164
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:34,462
Thanks for checkin' in.

165
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:50,478
Nadia.

166
00:09:50,513 --> 00:09:51,479
Hi, Joey.

167
00:09:51,514 --> 00:09:52,614
What are you doing here?

168
00:09:52,648 --> 00:09:54,516
I came to ask you a favor.

169
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:55,984
Another one?

170
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:59,087
Oh, it's like giving milk
to a stray cat.

171
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:00,688
Here, sit down.

172
00:10:00,723 --> 00:10:02,791
I remind you of a dirty cat?

173
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:05,160
No, no.
I was trying to be clever,

174
00:10:05,194 --> 00:10:08,497
which is sort of out of my wheelhouse.

175
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:09,731
What can I do for you?

176
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,833
Kaja was wearing a bracelet

177
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:13,067
the night she was killed.

178
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:15,036
I know she would want
to be buried in it.

179
00:10:15,071 --> 00:10:17,806
It's...the least I could do
for my friend.

180
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,874
Well, if it's been cleared
for DNA, you can have it.

181
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:22,510
I got a list of her personal effects.

182
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:23,844
Here we go.

183
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:30,051
Mm, there's no bracelet listed.

184
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:31,586
Are you sure?

185
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,555
I know she was wearing it that night.

186
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,224
I don't know what you're implying,

187
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:40,028
but I'm the only dirty cop
in this station.

188
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:41,730
And I didn't take it, so...

189
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:45,768
A dirty cop is better
than a dirty cat.

190
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:46,936
I believe you.
Thanks.

191
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,071
Wait...I was, uh,

192
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,909
wondering if you'd like
to go out with me sometime.

193
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:53,910
Or, better yet,
you could come to my place,

194
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,944
and I'll make you dinner.

195
00:10:54,978 --> 00:10:57,780
Why don't I cook you dinner?

196
00:10:57,814 --> 00:10:59,582
I was hoping you'd say that.

197
00:11:17,734 --> 00:11:19,568
Did you see the list
with your own eyes?

198
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:22,438
Sit down.

199
00:11:22,472 --> 00:11:24,374
No.

200
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:25,575
How do you know the detective

201
00:11:25,609 --> 00:11:27,310
wasn't lying about the bracelet?

202
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,947
'Cause he likes me.

203
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:34,584
He likes you?

204
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:37,087
Do you understand
what's at stake here?

205
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:38,589
If the cops find that dead GPS chip

206
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,958
in that bracelet,
they're gonna figure out

207
00:11:40,993 --> 00:11:42,794
we use them to track our mules.

208
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,161
And if they get on
to our system--

209
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:47,231
They'll shut down
your heroin business.

210
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:49,000
Which is a lot more lucrative

211
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:52,403
than the tits and ass business,
Nadezhda.

212
00:11:52,438 --> 00:11:54,072
George...

213
00:11:54,106 --> 00:11:57,141
maybe you should accept
good news when you hear it.

214
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,249
Your name is Nadezhda,
but you go by Nadia.

215
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:07,918
I always hated Nadezhda.

216
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:10,087
You shouldn't.

217
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:13,157
It's a beautiful Russian name.

218
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:16,628
Did you know that
the greatest mezzo soprano

219
00:12:16,662 --> 00:12:19,498
of the Bolshoi Theater
was also named Nadezhda?

220
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:21,500
No.

221
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,636
Nadezhda Obukhova.

222
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,637
It was said that her voice

223
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:29,106
could unlock
the mysteries of the heart.

224
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,176
She died before I was born,

225
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,977
but I still listen to her recordings

226
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:36,480
of <i>The Snow Maiden.</i>

227
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:39,048
Mmm.

228
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:43,653
My music teacher,
Mr. Chillich,

229
00:12:43,687 --> 00:12:44,787
he said to me,

230
00:12:44,822 --> 00:12:48,058
"Isaac, you think you're strong,

231
00:12:48,092 --> 00:12:50,427
but you are not strong
if you don't feel."

232
00:12:53,364 --> 00:12:54,765
He gave me an "F,"

233
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:56,867
so I pushed him down
a flight of stairs.

234
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,503
I felt bad about it.

235
00:12:59,537 --> 00:13:02,672
After that, my father shipped me off

236
00:13:02,706 --> 00:13:05,141
to a disciplinary school in england.

237
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:08,678
Now I'm afraid my love of opera

238
00:13:08,712 --> 00:13:12,014
is all that's left
of my sensitive side.

239
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:17,820
I want you to get close
to this detective.

240
00:13:17,855 --> 00:13:21,090
Find out what the police
know about Viktor.

241
00:13:21,124 --> 00:13:25,094
You'll do that for me,
won't you, Nadezhda?

242
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:26,629
Good.

243
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,734
You can go now.

244
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:52,021
Viktor is smart.

245
00:13:52,056 --> 00:13:53,756
He probably took the bracelet
off the dead girl

246
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,258
to keep the police from getting it.

247
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,594
He probably has it
and is hiding out somewhere.

248
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,362
But we'll never know

249
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:02,064
'cause the signal died
over a week ago.

250
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:04,366
With technology, there's always a way.

251
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,735
Find the I.T. man
who set the system up.

252
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,038
If we can track the bracelet...

253
00:14:10,073 --> 00:14:12,174
we can find Viktor.

254
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:20,450
So she called and I said, "Okay, well,

255
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,752
you know, let's, uh,
let's do a double dater."

256
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:24,086
5:00 P.M. you know,

257
00:14:24,121 --> 00:14:25,421
we're laying down there on the couch,

258
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:27,857
and, you know, I feel this hand
kind of go up my back.

259
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:30,545
This is what my life
has become?

260
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:46,075
Time to start prying
one monkey off my back.

261
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:48,144
Got a package here addressed
to Miami Metro forensics.

262
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,746
Oh, yeah, uh, I'll take it.

263
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,416
- There you go.
- Thanks.

264
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:53,784
Think I drunk-ordered
from the hustler store,

265
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:55,153
and that never turns out well.

266
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:09,500
What the fuck?

267
00:15:22,081 --> 00:15:23,814
"Dear Mr. Greene,
when I bought

268
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:25,216
"the Ice Truck Killer's hand online,

269
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,851
"I assumed it would be
in mint condition,

270
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,853
"not with lines drawn
all over its palm.

271
00:15:28,888 --> 00:15:31,356
Please refund
my money immediately."

272
00:15:35,862 --> 00:15:37,763
You had the hand the whole time?

273
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:39,731
And you sold it online?

274
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:41,666
N-no, I swear--
I swear, I don't know--

275
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:42,801
and after all I've done for you,

276
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:44,036
you stab me in the fuckin' back?

277
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,404
You are so fuckin' fired!

278
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:46,872
Vince, hold on a second.

279
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,373
- You gotta belie--
- Out. Now.

280
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:07,726
I have the worst luck with interns.

281
00:16:09,462 --> 00:16:13,299
One more step, and Louis
will be out of my life for good.

282
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:17,136
Now to focus on where
I can find Speltzer next.

283
00:16:18,205 --> 00:16:20,239
Lieutenant, I have someone here

284
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:21,407
who'd like to speak to you.

285
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:24,411
This is Donna Randall.

286
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:26,113
Wayne's mama.

287
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:29,083
The one who suicided
out there on the highway.

288
00:16:29,117 --> 00:16:31,986
I'm sure you know
I'm so sorry for your loss.

289
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,754
How can I help you?

290
00:16:33,789 --> 00:16:36,324
It's me might be able to help you.

291
00:16:36,359 --> 00:16:38,293
I got some stuff here

292
00:16:38,327 --> 00:16:40,128
that might interest you.

293
00:16:40,162 --> 00:16:42,797
Wayne sent it to me 15 years ago,

294
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:44,399
just before he got caught,

295
00:16:44,434 --> 00:16:46,801
and said it was some
sentimental items,

296
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:49,271
and would I hold it for him
till he got settled

297
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,339
someplace away from the law.

298
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:54,175
Ms. Randall, why didn't you
turn this over years ago?

299
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:56,511
Look, I know my boy did wrong,

300
00:16:56,545 --> 00:17:00,348
but I wasn't about to help
the state of Florida kill him.

301
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:02,618
Anyway, now that he's gone,

302
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,753
I figured maybe something in there

303
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:07,956
might help bring some...

304
00:17:07,991 --> 00:17:09,591
peace to the families,

305
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,293
you know, of the victims.

306
00:17:11,327 --> 00:17:15,531
It's mostly just junk
that Wayne and that girl

307
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,667
collected on their little tear.

308
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,435
There was some cash in there too,

309
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:22,305
but I spent that ages ago.

310
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,406
It might be a waste of time,

311
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,274
but we should have the lab go over it.

312
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:27,076
Just when you think a case is closed,

313
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,110
it pops open again.

314
00:17:29,312 --> 00:17:32,147
Another book of matches
from Stuckey's.

315
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:36,185
You would think one memory
of that place would be enough.

316
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,020
Anything interesting?

317
00:17:38,054 --> 00:17:39,888
Not so far.

318
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:43,926
One tightly wrapped
young woman's t-shirt.

319
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,130
And inside, we have
a little plastic giraffe.

320
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:49,131
Hmm.

321
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,401
Huh.

322
00:17:52,435 --> 00:17:55,504
And a lighter...

323
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:58,041
And a necklace.

324
00:17:58,075 --> 00:17:59,609
It looks like more of the same,

325
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,444
but why was that stuff wrapped up?

326
00:18:01,478 --> 00:18:04,581
Maybe they have a special meaning.

327
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,850
"Janice."

328
00:18:06,884 --> 00:18:09,419
That's the name of the woman
Randall said he killed.

329
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:10,587
Might be a trophy.

330
00:18:10,621 --> 00:18:12,021
Means Wayne was telling the truth.

331
00:18:12,055 --> 00:18:14,757
A body must be buried
out there someplace.

332
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,592
If the giraffe and lighter
are trophies, too,

333
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:17,927
there might be more bodies to find.

334
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:19,061
Hey, I just got a call.

335
00:18:19,095 --> 00:18:20,962
The bouncer from the Fox Hole,
Tony Rush,

336
00:18:20,997 --> 00:18:22,030
they just found him with a screwdriver

337
00:18:22,064 --> 00:18:23,131
through his head.

338
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,100
We just interviewed him.

339
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:26,468
Looks like the Koshka brotherhood

340
00:18:26,502 --> 00:18:28,136
were trying to send a message
about talking to cops.

341
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,605
It just got that much harder
to find whoever killed Mike.

342
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:33,375
No matter what we do,
there's always another body.

343
00:18:36,479 --> 00:18:38,313
Yo, Mary Poppins, wait up.

344
00:18:38,348 --> 00:18:40,382
Hey, Deb, I'm not gonna
be home for dinner tonight.

345
00:18:40,416 --> 00:18:42,217
I'm gonna hit the new gym.

346
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,631
Hey, babe.

347
00:18:55,665 --> 00:18:58,100
What's goin' on?

348
00:18:58,134 --> 00:19:00,402
I'm just watching a video.

349
00:19:00,436 --> 00:19:02,971
Wanna see it?

350
00:19:04,673 --> 00:19:08,110
Idea: A video diary app.

351
00:19:08,144 --> 00:19:10,011
One touch, device starts recording.

352
00:19:10,046 --> 00:19:13,615
Tap again, and it uploads
directly to y--

353
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:15,417
Still waiting.

354
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,185
Yeah, I'm almost done.

355
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,821
Your hour's almost up.

356
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:20,923
I'm only thinking of you.

357
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:29,598
Oh, God.

358
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:32,433
There will never be an app for this.

359
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:35,470
That was before we started dating.

360
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:37,705
You're wearing the shirt I gave you

361
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,607
for your birthday, asshole.

362
00:19:39,642 --> 00:19:41,175
It was a hooker.

363
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,177
It's not cheating if you pay for it.

364
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:46,013
Oh, my God, you are a pig.

365
00:19:46,048 --> 00:19:48,816
If I catch anything from you,
I'm gonna kill you!

366
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,518
Ow!

367
00:19:50,552 --> 00:19:52,720
How did you get that disc?

368
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:54,689
It was mailed to me anonymously,

369
00:19:54,723 --> 00:19:56,023
probably by your hooker.

370
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:57,692
What did you do, cancel her check?

371
00:19:57,726 --> 00:19:59,127
Dexter sent it.

372
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,162
Dexter? He broke
into your apartment

373
00:20:01,196 --> 00:20:02,329
and he stole your porno?

374
00:20:02,364 --> 00:20:04,398
Yeah, and he just got me fired.

375
00:20:04,432 --> 00:20:06,133
He's trying to ruin my life!

376
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:08,568
You are fucking crazy.

377
00:20:08,603 --> 00:20:10,504
I don't ever want to see you again!

378
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:15,842
Fuck!

379
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:27,653
Gym, huh?

380
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:29,388
Lying little shit.

381
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:40,366
Morgan.

382
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,669
I ordered you a beer.

383
00:20:43,703 --> 00:20:46,438
You knew I was following you.

384
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:48,607
I made it easy for you.

385
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,847
You lured me here.

386
00:20:55,882 --> 00:20:57,449
- Yeah.
- Here you go.

387
00:20:57,483 --> 00:20:59,384
Little attitude adjuster.

388
00:20:59,418 --> 00:21:00,852
Think I'm gonna need
a little more adjusting.

389
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:04,356
What's this about?

390
00:21:07,827 --> 00:21:09,060
Do you remember this case?

391
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,596
Yeah.
Ray Speltzer, he was...

392
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:13,031
guilty as fuck--

393
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,534
probably of two murders--
but we couldn't prove it.

394
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,436
I think he's getting ready
to do it again.

395
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,570
What are you talking about?

396
00:21:18,605 --> 00:21:20,239
He shaved his head today.

397
00:21:22,809 --> 00:21:25,911
His head had been recently shaved

398
00:21:25,946 --> 00:21:29,548
when he was questioned
about Ann Feig's disappearance

399
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:32,752
and when he was arrested
for Nina Fleischer's murder.

400
00:21:32,786 --> 00:21:36,222
I think it's part
of his killing ritual.

401
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:40,259
I think he's hunting
his next victim right now.

402
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:43,295
How the fuck would you know that?

403
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:53,506
Christ on a fucking cracker, Dexter.

404
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,974
You got me here
to help you stalk Speltzer

405
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:56,409
so you could kill him?

406
00:21:56,443 --> 00:21:57,911
No, I don't need you to help me, Deb.

407
00:21:57,945 --> 00:21:59,278
I just need you
to understand--

408
00:21:59,313 --> 00:22:02,015
- God damn it!
- Deb, sit down.

409
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,649
This is not what we agreed to.

410
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:06,252
- You fucking lied to me!
- Not here. Come on.

411
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:09,857
Get the fuck off.

412
00:22:12,961 --> 00:22:14,996
Deb, I lured you here

413
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,799
because I thought maybe
if I let you in on my process,

414
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:21,536
you'd appreciate that there
is some value to what I do.

415
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:24,306
I don't believe this.
You want my approval?

416
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,875
I want to continue
to be honest with you, Deb,

417
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,177
but I have to be free to be who I am.

418
00:22:29,212 --> 00:22:31,647
It is a capital offense
to be who you are, Dexter.

419
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:34,016
I'm taking out the trash.

420
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,952
The trash that would otherwise
be left to putrefy.

421
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:38,053
I know I've said this before,

422
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,321
but there is a legal system for that.

423
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:41,589
And just because Speltzer got off,

424
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:42,790
that doesn't mean it doesn't work.

425
00:22:42,824 --> 00:22:44,525
If it worked as well
as you think it does,

426
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,562
I wouldn't be so busy.

427
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,197
Dad knew that.

428
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:51,432
Dad taught me that.

429
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:56,338
What is it about your personal law

430
00:22:56,372 --> 00:22:57,839
that is so much better than the one

431
00:22:57,874 --> 00:23:00,542
that the rest of us agree to live by?

432
00:23:00,577 --> 00:23:02,144
Sometimes it is.

433
00:23:02,178 --> 00:23:03,312
How?

434
00:23:03,346 --> 00:23:04,980
Speltzer would have
to murder somebody again

435
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:07,649
for you to arrest him.
I can stop him before.

436
00:23:07,683 --> 00:23:09,351
Are you trying to tell me
that's why you do this--

437
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:11,253
so you can save lives?

438
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:13,956
The end result is the same.

439
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,624
Some girl is gonna be dead soon

440
00:23:15,658 --> 00:23:16,758
if I don't take Speltzer out.

441
00:23:16,793 --> 00:23:19,361
Based on what fucking
evidence, Dexter?

442
00:23:19,395 --> 00:23:21,964
A haircut?

443
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:23,365
Dexter, you can't
go around killing people

444
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:24,566
that you think might murder.

445
00:23:24,601 --> 00:23:26,001
That is not how I do things.

446
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:28,337
You can't even prove
that he killed Nina Fleischer.

447
00:23:28,371 --> 00:23:30,306
I can and will.
I'm not done vetting him yet.

448
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,641
Vetting?

449
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:32,842
I am trying to tell you

450
00:23:32,876 --> 00:23:34,977
that I will not kill Speltzer

451
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:37,313
until I am absolutely sure
that he is guilty.

452
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:40,383
Oh, fuck.
No. I-it--

453
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:42,885
This is done.

454
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,888
And nothing better happen

455
00:23:44,922 --> 00:23:47,724
to that bald piece of shit over there.

456
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:58,001
I'm not done with Speltzer.

457
00:23:58,035 --> 00:24:00,103
I've been out roaming free,
and I like it.

458
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:04,941
I just have to find the proof
that will convince Deb.

459
00:24:11,982 --> 00:24:14,784
Speltzer went in that mausoleum
20 minutes ago.

460
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:21,791
Since when does a groundskeeper
keep the grounds

461
00:24:21,825 --> 00:24:25,629
inside a private tomb?

462
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,047
Why is this mausoleum so special?

463
00:25:00,934 --> 00:25:03,268
The last body interred here
was over 50 years ago.

464
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:04,803
If it was a friend of Speltzer's,

465
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,939
then Ray is holding up really well.

466
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,581
Hey, Deb.

467
00:25:15,615 --> 00:25:16,782
Why aren't you at work?

468
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:18,083
Yeah, I'm kind of
in the middle of s--

469
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:19,284
Well, I need you back here.
I have an entire--

470
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,054
Okay, okay.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

471
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,189
- Now, Dexter.
- Bye.

472
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,394
What's up, girl?

473
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,301
What's up?

474
00:25:37,335 --> 00:25:39,836
Fortunately, we set up
a secure cloud framework

475
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,804
that automatically syncs up
to the receivers.

476
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,006
So you're able to reconstruct
the GPS tracking points?

477
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:46,209
Now get to <i>the</i> point.
What happened to the bracelet?

478
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:48,478
Chip kept moving
after the girl was dead.

479
00:25:48,512 --> 00:25:50,580
- Where?
- Viktor's apartment.

480
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:52,882
And from there?

481
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,684
Miami airport.

482
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,753
Then a marina.

483
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:00,023
Then eight miles out to sea,

484
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,591
where the signal stopped.

485
00:26:04,862 --> 00:26:07,164
Maybe he took a boat
offshore to avoid the police

486
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:08,966
and then he threw
the bracelet--

487
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,700
He's dead.

488
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,236
He's dumped in the ocean,
like a load of garbage.

489
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:18,173
Whoever killed him
left from this marina.

490
00:26:21,044 --> 00:26:23,178
Can you pinpoint the exact slip?

491
00:26:23,213 --> 00:26:25,714
I'll need some time.

492
00:26:28,217 --> 00:26:29,885
It's worth the wait.

493
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:37,359
Okay, I'm here.

494
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:40,896
You don't have to fire me.

495
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:43,432
Tell me you weren't
stalking Ray Speltzer.

496
00:26:43,466 --> 00:26:45,300
I was at the cemetery

497
00:26:45,335 --> 00:26:46,568
where he works as a groundskeeper.

498
00:26:46,602 --> 00:26:48,170
God damn it, Dexter.

499
00:26:48,204 --> 00:26:49,838
He was lingering inside a mausoleum,

500
00:26:49,873 --> 00:26:52,074
treating it like it was sacred ground.

501
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:54,509
I think he's hiding
something in there,

502
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:55,978
something that may prove his guilt.

503
00:26:56,012 --> 00:26:57,913
"I think he may"?
That's not evidence.

504
00:26:57,947 --> 00:26:59,248
Well, I'd already have the evidence

505
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:01,183
if you hadn't ordered me back here.

506
00:27:01,217 --> 00:27:02,785
But even without it, I can tell

507
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:04,787
Speltzer's gonna kill again.

508
00:27:04,821 --> 00:27:08,524
An alarm is going off
inside my lizard brain.

509
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:10,726
Great, now my brother
has a lizard brain.

510
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,694
The amygdala.

511
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:12,862
The most primitive part of the brain

512
00:27:12,896 --> 00:27:14,030
that senses danger.

513
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:15,498
Harry taught me to listen to mine.

514
00:27:15,532 --> 00:27:16,732
Oh, well, you'll excuse me

515
00:27:16,766 --> 00:27:18,701
if I don't put my faith
in your amygdala.

516
00:27:18,735 --> 00:27:23,372
But you already have, Deb,
dozens of times.

517
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:25,541
All the murderers
I've helped you catch,

518
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:28,511
who got brought down
because of my hunches.

519
00:27:28,545 --> 00:27:31,380
My lizard brain has been
your secret weapon

520
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:32,381
all along.

521
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:36,485
You just didn't know it.

522
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:38,821
You're fucking with my head.

523
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,622
Don't take it on faith.
I'll give you proof.

524
00:27:40,657 --> 00:27:42,624
I'll go back and break into
the mausoleum, right now.

525
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:43,926
No. If you're right,

526
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,160
and you get the evidence illegally,

527
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:46,461
then I can't use it in court.

528
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:48,930
That doesn't make it any less true.

529
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,998
Which is why you need to let me do it.

530
00:27:51,033 --> 00:27:53,634
No. We follow the law,
remember?

531
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:55,236
I'll get a search warrant.

532
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,870
If the evidence is there,
then I'll put him away

533
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:58,105
before he can hurt anyone else.

534
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,174
You're not listening.
There isn't time.

535
00:28:00,208 --> 00:28:03,677
I just said that I will
take care of this.

536
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:07,482
Do not fuck with me on this,
or I swear to God,

537
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:08,750
I will take us both down.

538
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,487
Am I being clear this time?

539
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:13,488
Yeah, that's pretty clear.

540
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:15,024
Good.

541
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:17,126
Now I have a job for you.

542
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,461
I need you to go with Batista

543
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:19,595
to visit Hannah McKay.

544
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:21,097
What?

545
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:22,231
Wayne Randall's little sidekick

546
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:23,432
from his killing spree.

547
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:24,433
If we're gonna find
those other bodies,

548
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:25,434
we're gonna need her help.

549
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:26,669
That's a detective's job.

550
00:28:26,703 --> 00:28:27,703
Why do I have to go?

551
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:29,439
I need her DNA.

552
00:28:29,473 --> 00:28:30,873
She was a minor
at the time of the crime,

553
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:33,042
so she was able
to get her record expunged.

554
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:35,945
You're giving me busy work
to keep me away from Speltzer.

555
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:38,147
It's really important
that we find those bodies.

556
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:40,683
And, yes, I am trying
to keep you away from Speltzer.

557
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:43,886
Dexter.

558
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,021
Ready to roll?

559
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:47,456
Yeah.

560
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:50,493
We just gotta make
a quick stop on the way.

561
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:06,241
You piece of shit.

562
00:29:06,275 --> 00:29:09,877
I know what you people
did to Tony Rush.

563
00:29:09,912 --> 00:29:12,146
Excuse me.

564
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,015
You wanna talk to me?

565
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:16,317
How 'bout we do it in my office?

566
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:34,169
You're making me nervous.
Why don't you sit down?

567
00:29:34,204 --> 00:29:35,838
I'm waiting for someone.

568
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,441
Aren't we all?

569
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:41,077
Doesn't mean we can't
enjoy ourselves in the meantime.

570
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:43,180
Have a drink,
or a lap dance, or--

571
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,882
or festoon a thong with some
neatly folded dollar bills.

572
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:48,018
Yeah, I'm fine.

573
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:49,352
So you're not interested in alcohol

574
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:52,255
or looking at naked women.

575
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:55,758
You may be in the wrong place.

576
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:57,026
I could say the same of you.

577
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,561
What brings you here?

578
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:01,130
Me?
I'm looking for something.

579
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:02,899
Aren't we all?

580
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:07,970
So we're both here just killing time.

581
00:30:08,005 --> 00:30:09,372
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing.

582
00:30:09,406 --> 00:30:11,707
Killing time.

583
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:16,379
Ironic, isn't it?

584
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,081
We're both here for a different reason

585
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:19,216
than these other leering cretins,

586
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,119
and yet the net result is the same.

587
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,320
And what's that?

588
00:30:25,823 --> 00:30:27,991
We're frustrated.

589
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,567
Let's go.

590
00:30:38,602 --> 00:30:41,136
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

591
00:30:50,814 --> 00:30:53,749
So Hannah McKay.

592
00:30:53,784 --> 00:30:55,918
Were you around
for the spree killings?

593
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:58,087
I was still in uniform,
but I remember it pretty well.

594
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:01,490
Hannah was, like, 15
when she ran off with Randall.

595
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:02,658
She wasn't in on the murders,

596
00:31:02,692 --> 00:31:04,827
just a kid who fell for the wrong guy.

597
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:07,830
She testified against him
for a reduced sentence.

598
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:10,600
Did six years in juvie.

599
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:11,834
Since she got out, she's laid low.

600
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,736
Now she owns this nursery.

601
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,372
Sounds like she really
managed to change her life.

602
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:17,840
Yeah.

603
00:31:17,874 --> 00:31:20,309
I think I, uh, envy her.

604
00:31:20,343 --> 00:31:23,045
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

605
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,314
Since Mike's death, I've been thinking

606
00:31:25,349 --> 00:31:27,449
maybe there's more to life than this.

607
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:28,818
I used to think murder police was it,

608
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,620
but maybe there's something else
out there for me.

609
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:32,856
Something new and exciting.

610
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,858
And sometimes
there's nothing more exciting

611
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,994
than getting back
what you had and lost.

612
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,729
Can I help you?

613
00:31:41,732 --> 00:31:43,567
- Ms. McKay?
- That's right.

614
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,072
Sergeant Batista, Miami Metro.

615
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:50,875
I'd like to talk to you
about Wayne Randall.

616
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,677
What a surprise.

617
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,379
He's the detective.
What are you?

618
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,415
Uh, lab geek.

619
00:31:56,449 --> 00:31:57,716
This just gets better and better.

620
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,485
I'm sorry, I'm a sergeant,

621
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:00,553
and this is Dexter Morgan.

622
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,722
He's a forensic analyst.

623
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,892
I've said everything I have
to say about Wayne Randall.

624
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:07,427
It was a long time ago,

625
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:09,362
and I just want to put it behind me.

626
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:12,398
Ma'am, this is very important.

627
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,901
Now, I could bring you in
to the station house,

628
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,169
but I'd rather not put you out

629
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:17,270
if I don't have to.

630
00:32:17,304 --> 00:32:19,271
Fine.

631
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:20,839
But I have work to do.

632
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,714
So you know nothing
about these other people

633
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:32,384
that Wayne claimed
to have killed and buried?

634
00:32:32,418 --> 00:32:33,752
How is that possible?

635
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,587
We weren't joined at the hip.

636
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,056
I don't know what he did
when I wasn't with him.

637
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:43,695
Careful.
The leaves are sharp.

638
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,864
Ah.

639
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:48,700
How do you stand this humidity?

640
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:51,569
If it bothered me,
I'd be growing cacti.

641
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:52,971
Are we done?

642
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,472
Not quite.

643
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:57,275
Wayne's mother recently
brought in a bag of mementos

644
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,442
from your time together.

645
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,777
Lovely woman.

646
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,980
Yeah, would you mind taking
a look at these photos

647
00:33:02,014 --> 00:33:04,249
and letting me know
if you recognize anything?

648
00:33:04,284 --> 00:33:06,585
Yes. Yes, I would mind,
detective.

649
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,021
- Sergeant.
- Sergeant, I'm sorry.

650
00:33:10,524 --> 00:33:12,859
Look, I feel terrible
about what happened back then.

651
00:33:12,893 --> 00:33:15,261
It's something
that I have to live with

652
00:33:15,296 --> 00:33:19,032
for the rest of my life,
and...I deserve that.

653
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:22,435
But the only way that I
have been able to survive

654
00:33:22,469 --> 00:33:25,305
is to move on with my life.

655
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:27,841
What about the families
of the victims?

656
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:30,444
Don't you think
they deserve some closure?

657
00:33:30,478 --> 00:33:33,948
Absolutely, but they're not
gonna get it from me.

658
00:33:33,982 --> 00:33:36,016
I've told you everything that I know.

659
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:38,018
Now, I would appreciate it
if you would...

660
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:39,787
both just leave me alone.

661
00:33:41,723 --> 00:33:43,691
Fine.

662
00:33:43,725 --> 00:33:45,859
But before we go, my colleague

663
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:48,896
has to get a DNA sample
from you to exclude you--

664
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,164
I understand.

665
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:52,900
I understand more about
police work than I care to.

666
00:33:52,935 --> 00:33:54,736
You wanna show me that court order

667
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:56,704
in your back pocket,
Mr. Morgan?

668
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,648
Dexter's fine.

669
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:10,318
If I were you,
I'd stick with "Mr. Morgan."

670
00:34:10,352 --> 00:34:12,887
Please be quick.

671
00:34:14,023 --> 00:34:15,624
I will.

672
00:34:19,596 --> 00:34:20,996
If you don't mind, I'm gonna go

673
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,032
and crank up
the A.C. in the car.

674
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,267
Nice to meet you,
Ms. McKay.

675
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,908
All right, I'm just gonna
get a quick swab

676
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:33,210
from your cheek.

677
00:34:33,244 --> 00:34:34,678
This won't hurt.

678
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:37,347
But then you...
already know that.

679
00:34:44,322 --> 00:34:45,890
Shit.

680
00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:47,925
You do this for a living?

681
00:34:49,761 --> 00:34:51,195
Sorry.

682
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,481
Okay.

683
00:35:16,954 --> 00:35:18,054
That should do it.

684
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:21,124
Thanks, Ms. McKay.

685
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:22,625
Hannah.

686
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,993
No, you were right.

687
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:27,097
I think we should keep things
on a last-name basis.

688
00:35:38,408 --> 00:35:40,909
How would you like to catch this fuck?

689
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:48,417
Ray Speltzer.

690
00:35:48,452 --> 00:35:50,753
I still lose sleep over this one.

691
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:52,455
I think he's hiding something
in a mausoleum

692
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,824
that might connect him
to Nina Fleischer's murder.

693
00:35:54,858 --> 00:35:58,127
But I can't get Judge Perez
to sign off on a search warrant,

694
00:35:58,162 --> 00:36:00,629
so I need you to wet the wheels
a little bit.

695
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:03,165
Well, what's your probable cause?

696
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:05,768
There's some circumstantial stuff.

697
00:36:05,802 --> 00:36:08,637
It's thin, but...

698
00:36:08,672 --> 00:36:10,572
basically, Speltzer
is setting off an alarm

699
00:36:10,607 --> 00:36:13,642
in my lizard brain.

700
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:16,311
Interesting.

701
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:17,512
So you'll talk to Perez?

702
00:36:17,547 --> 00:36:21,784
No, not on behalf
of your lizard brain.

703
00:36:21,818 --> 00:36:23,519
I--I know
it sounds fucked up.

704
00:36:23,553 --> 00:36:25,187
Look, Debra...

705
00:36:25,222 --> 00:36:27,023
I think you're a good cop.

706
00:36:27,057 --> 00:36:28,757
If you think this is worth pursuing,

707
00:36:28,792 --> 00:36:30,626
I trust you, but...

708
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,328
that's not gonna get you a warrant.

709
00:36:32,362 --> 00:36:34,196
Have you tried getting permission

710
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,764
from the family
who owns the mausoleum?

711
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:37,833
Yes, but I can't track them down.

712
00:36:37,867 --> 00:36:39,000
Stay on it.
You'll find someone.

713
00:36:39,035 --> 00:36:42,804
If you knew there was
a murderer out there,

714
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:43,872
and you could do something to stop him

715
00:36:43,906 --> 00:36:46,041
before he killed again,

716
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:48,243
could you let it go?

717
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:53,382
We're the police, Debra.

718
00:36:53,416 --> 00:36:55,585
We have to follow the law.

719
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:05,393
You could put a patrol car
on Speltzer.

720
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:07,228
Watch him.

721
00:37:07,262 --> 00:37:09,230
But I better not see it on the budget.

722
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,520
That one.

723
00:37:40,596 --> 00:37:43,164
Nice boat, you arrogant asshole.

724
00:37:43,198 --> 00:37:45,694
Too bad it won't be afloat too long.

725
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:49,603
Kiss my ass, you ginger freak.

726
00:37:49,637 --> 00:37:52,939
Is this your boat?

727
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:54,240
Yeah, this is my boat.

728
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:55,441
That's why I'm on it.

729
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,279
Who are you?

730
00:38:00,313 --> 00:38:03,215
Are you a cop
or some kind of security?

731
00:38:04,317 --> 00:38:05,684
Who are you?

732
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:07,219
Look, I don't have
to tell you anything

733
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,253
unless you show me
a badge or something.

734
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:10,288
Why did you kill Viktor?

735
00:38:10,323 --> 00:38:11,590
What? What are you
talking about?

736
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:12,757
Whoa, hey, hey.

737
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:14,025
Look, look,
just get the fuck out of here.

738
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,426
- I want answers.
- Hey, I will call the cops--

739
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,968
I am gonna put your eyes out.

740
00:38:24,003 --> 00:38:25,103
Now, the trick is

741
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,906
to keep from drilling into your brain.

742
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:34,913
- Look, look, I don't...
- Shh.

743
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:38,951
Look, I don't know anything.

744
00:38:38,985 --> 00:38:40,152
Look, I didn't kill anyone.
I swear.

745
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:41,920
This isn't even my boat.

746
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,225
Why did you say it was?

747
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:48,194
It belongs to this douche bag
named Dexter Morgan.

748
00:38:48,228 --> 00:38:49,662
I hate this guy's fucking guts.

749
00:38:49,696 --> 00:38:52,731
That's why I came down here,
so I could sink his boat.

750
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,100
Who is Dexter Morgan?

751
00:38:54,134 --> 00:38:55,902
Like I said, he's just a jerk

752
00:38:55,936 --> 00:38:58,071
who works for Miami Metro Homicide.

753
00:39:02,644 --> 00:39:03,644
Okay?

754
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,013
Now, can I--
can I please go?

755
00:39:10,552 --> 00:39:12,186
Yes.

756
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:18,925
Get rid of him.

757
00:39:59,768 --> 00:40:01,402
- Morgan.
- Hey, lieutenant.

758
00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:02,636
This is Officer Hewitt.

759
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:03,871
We followed Speltzer
home from the bar.

760
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:06,140
There's been no activity
for over two hours.

761
00:40:06,174 --> 00:40:07,408
Just seems like he's in for the night.

762
00:40:07,443 --> 00:40:09,310
We just got dispatched on a 211.

763
00:40:09,344 --> 00:40:10,411
Can we take it?

764
00:40:10,446 --> 00:40:12,147
Or do you want us to stay on Speltzer?

765
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:14,416
Negative on Speltzer.
Take the 211.

766
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,684
Copy that.
Good night, lieutenant.

767
00:40:15,718 --> 00:40:18,420
Good night.

768
00:40:18,454 --> 00:40:21,189
It's a waste of fuckin' manpower.

769
00:40:21,224 --> 00:40:23,092
My father worked sometimes three jobs

770
00:40:23,126 --> 00:40:24,593
to take care of us, so...

771
00:40:24,628 --> 00:40:27,530
I decided the best way I could help

772
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:28,564
was to leave home

773
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:31,834
so he has one less mouth to feed.

774
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,070
He'd be so ashamed
if he knew what I do

775
00:40:34,104 --> 00:40:35,471
to make money.

776
00:40:35,506 --> 00:40:36,873
Hey...

777
00:40:36,907 --> 00:40:38,941
You're not gonna be a stripper
your whole life, right?

778
00:40:38,975 --> 00:40:42,277
No, I have big dreams.

779
00:40:42,312 --> 00:40:45,713
I want to start my own
dog-walking business.

780
00:40:47,282 --> 00:40:48,516
No matter what happens, rich people

781
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,586
will always be...lazy

782
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,788
and they will always have dogs.

783
00:40:57,393 --> 00:40:58,760
What's wrong?

784
00:40:58,794 --> 00:41:00,228
I like you, Joey.

785
00:41:00,262 --> 00:41:02,163
I don't want to lie to you.

786
00:41:03,933 --> 00:41:05,934
About what?

787
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:12,073
My bosses at the club, they...

788
00:41:12,107 --> 00:41:14,976
they ordered me to get close to you...

789
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,078
so I could find out
what the police know

790
00:41:17,112 --> 00:41:21,549
about Viktor Baskov
and their business dealings.

791
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:23,719
So that's why you said yes
to the date?

792
00:41:23,753 --> 00:41:26,621
No, I said yes before
they told me to do this.

793
00:41:26,656 --> 00:41:29,959
So then...
you do really like me?

794
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:31,961
Yes.

795
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:34,497
But I'm scared.

796
00:41:34,531 --> 00:41:36,399
These men are dangerous.

797
00:41:36,433 --> 00:41:40,036
I-I can't go back to them
with nothing.

798
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,270
Don't be scared.

799
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:43,639
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

800
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:48,186
Look...

801
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,953
Maybe there's a way
we could help each other out.

802
00:41:54,987 --> 00:41:56,988
What do you mean?

803
00:41:57,023 --> 00:41:59,291
Well...I could give you

804
00:41:59,325 --> 00:42:02,127
enough information
to keep your bosses happy.

805
00:42:02,162 --> 00:42:03,963
What if the other cops find out?

806
00:42:03,997 --> 00:42:06,332
They won't.

807
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:07,867
And, in return,

808
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,303
if you hear anything around the club

809
00:42:10,338 --> 00:42:13,273
about Mike Anderson's murder,

810
00:42:13,307 --> 00:42:16,877
you pass it along to me.

811
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:19,245
I can do that.

812
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,947
I'm still worried for you.

813
00:42:20,982 --> 00:42:23,683
You should not get involved
with the Koshka brotherhood.

814
00:42:23,718 --> 00:42:26,152
Don't worry about me.

815
00:42:26,187 --> 00:42:28,388
If I can protect you

816
00:42:28,422 --> 00:42:30,223
and catch a cop killer,

817
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,926
it's worth sticking
my neck out a little.

818
00:42:35,796 --> 00:42:37,731
It is a nice neck.

819
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:13,234
Hey, Rick.
I got off work early,

820
00:43:13,268 --> 00:43:15,370
so I thought I'd take you up
on your offer.

821
00:43:15,404 --> 00:43:17,773
Ah, well, you will not
be disappointed.

822
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:20,342
I make the best mojito in Miami.

823
00:43:20,377 --> 00:43:22,044
- Awesome.
- Mm.

824
00:43:44,668 --> 00:43:47,470
Looks like Speltzer's
taken over the family shrine.

825
00:43:51,275 --> 00:43:52,675
Nina Fleischer's missing earring.

826
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:54,410
She didn't lose it in the struggle.

827
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:57,247
Speltzer took it as a trophy.

828
00:43:57,281 --> 00:44:00,316
If I take it, he'll know I was here.

829
00:44:00,351 --> 00:44:03,687
But I can still show it to Deb.

830
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:15,065
No cell service in a mausoleum.

831
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:23,940
God damn it.

832
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:29,045
This is Dexter.
Leave a message.

833
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:30,513
Hey, Dex, it's me.

834
00:44:30,547 --> 00:44:31,714
I just wanna let you know
I'm gonna be a little late

835
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:33,316
getting home tonight.

836
00:44:33,351 --> 00:44:35,719
You've got me paranoid
about Speltzer, so...

837
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:37,120
I'm gonna drive by his house,

838
00:44:37,155 --> 00:44:39,056
make sure he's tucked in
for the night.

839
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,727
Thank you for fucking up
my evening, bro.

840
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:50,735
So, um...

841
00:44:50,769 --> 00:44:52,837
how long did you say you've been here?

842
00:44:52,871 --> 00:44:54,739
A few days.

843
00:44:54,773 --> 00:44:57,375
I promise, I'm going furniture
shopping this weekend.

844
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,078
I mean, you could have
at least taken the plastic off.

845
00:45:00,112 --> 00:45:01,746
I'll get around to it.

846
00:45:01,781 --> 00:45:03,515
Have a seat.

847
00:45:05,084 --> 00:45:06,151
Okay.

848
00:45:12,124 --> 00:45:14,392
How 'bout some music?

849
00:45:14,427 --> 00:45:16,728
Soon.

850
00:45:16,762 --> 00:45:18,429
Sit tight.
I'll be right back.

851
00:45:18,464 --> 00:45:22,333
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll get us a drink.

852
00:45:52,731 --> 00:45:54,165
Ray...

853
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,166
Yeah?

854
00:45:55,201 --> 00:45:56,434
I gotta be honest with you.

855
00:45:56,468 --> 00:45:57,936
This mojito sucks.

856
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,137
Hmm.

857
00:45:59,171 --> 00:46:01,239
There's, like, no alcohol in it.

858
00:46:01,274 --> 00:46:03,942
Well, you have to be
in control of your faculties.

859
00:46:03,976 --> 00:46:06,111
Otherwise, there's no challenge.

860
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,647
Well, you certainly are confident.

861
00:46:19,158 --> 00:46:22,227
You look strong.

862
00:46:22,261 --> 00:46:23,895
Thanks...

863
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,365
I guess.

864
00:46:32,305 --> 00:46:34,072
I like it when they're strong.

865
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,144
What are you talking about?

866
00:46:40,379 --> 00:46:41,512
Get...

867
00:46:42,814 --> 00:46:45,149
Let's play a game.

868
00:46:45,183 --> 00:46:46,850
- Ray!
- Shh!

869
00:46:50,888 --> 00:46:53,189
Night night, fuck face.

870
00:47:24,921 --> 00:47:26,488
Hey, Dex, it's me.

871
00:47:26,523 --> 00:47:27,890
I just wanna let you know
I'm gonna be a little late

872
00:47:27,924 --> 00:47:29,058
getting home tonight.

873
00:47:29,092 --> 00:47:30,526
You've got me paranoid about Speltzer,

874
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,394
so I'm gonna cruise
by his house, make sure...

875
00:47:32,429 --> 00:47:34,029
- Shit.
- He's tucked in for the night.

876
00:49:17,169 --> 00:49:20,237
Oh, God.

877
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:21,505
Ugh.

878
00:49:37,388 --> 00:49:39,522
Freeze!

879
00:50:01,312 --> 00:50:03,046
Oh, fuck!

880
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,014
Aah!

881
00:50:24,602 --> 00:50:26,069
- Deb.
- Motherfucker.

882
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:29,305
He has a girl in here.
We have to find her.

883
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,107
Ohh!

884
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:42,019
He beat the shit out of her.

885
00:50:42,054 --> 00:50:43,854
Speltzer took her earring as a trophy,

886
00:50:43,889 --> 00:50:47,158
just like he did with Nina Fleischer.

887
00:50:47,192 --> 00:50:49,026
I found hers at the mausoleum.

888
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:13,517
Put a BOLO out on Speltzer,
but there's nothing yet.

889
00:51:13,551 --> 00:51:15,585
And the house was a foreclosure
that he broke into

890
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,421
to set up
his fucked-up maze.

891
00:51:19,557 --> 00:51:21,291
We found burned plastic in the oven.

892
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:23,527
Explains why there
weren't any prints or DNA

893
00:51:23,561 --> 00:51:26,363
on the things we found.

894
00:51:26,397 --> 00:51:28,698
I sent some unis over to the mausoleum

895
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:30,967
and the door was open.

896
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:35,038
Nina Fleischer's earring was missing.

897
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:37,240
I think he's in the wind.

898
00:51:40,678 --> 00:51:41,778
Behind you.

899
00:52:44,877 --> 00:52:46,678
Oh, you're up early.

900
00:52:46,712 --> 00:52:49,814
The coffee's fresh, if you want.

901
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:55,752
You were right.

902
00:52:55,787 --> 00:52:57,688
If I'd let you do things your way,

903
00:52:57,722 --> 00:53:00,156
then Speltzer would be dead
and that girl would be alive.

904
00:53:00,191 --> 00:53:02,125
But he's out there,

905
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:04,494
free to kill again.

906
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:08,631
Well, you can't change
the way you think overnight.

907
00:53:08,665 --> 00:53:11,768
I haven't.

908
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:15,805
I mean, I have, but I haven't.

909
00:53:17,307 --> 00:53:20,343
I get it...
what you do.

910
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:23,346
I hate it, but I get it.

911
00:53:27,918 --> 00:53:29,818
So you accept it?

912
00:53:36,292 --> 00:53:38,626
I understand it.

913
00:53:38,661 --> 00:53:42,931
I understand that it might be...

914
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:45,466
<i>might</i> be...

915
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:47,335
a necessary evil.

916
00:53:49,038 --> 00:53:54,175
But what I don't understand
are the blood slides.

917
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,377
They're trophies.

918
00:53:55,411 --> 00:53:57,246
They're like Speltzer's earrings.

919
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,649
- I'm nothing like Speltzer.
- But on some level, Dexter,

920
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:03,352
you like to kill.

921
00:54:05,755 --> 00:54:08,424
I like the way it makes me feel.

922
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,759
Same thing.

923
00:54:10,794 --> 00:54:14,163
Deb, I can't change who I am.

924
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,735
I know.

925
00:54:19,769 --> 00:54:22,938
And I can't change who I am.

926
00:54:22,972 --> 00:54:24,740
What are you saying?

927
00:54:24,774 --> 00:54:28,744
I don't know what I'm saying...

928
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,347
but I think you should move out.

929
00:54:32,382 --> 00:54:34,749
I think you should
move back to your place.

930
00:54:39,422 --> 00:54:41,390
Okay.

931
00:54:44,828 --> 00:54:46,629
Deb...

932
00:54:48,032 --> 00:54:49,366
I'm still your brother.

933
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,604
Nothing's changed.

934
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:55,572
Everything's changed.

935
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:59,043
I don't know if it can ever
be the same again.

936
00:55:09,533 --> 00:55:12,123
I'm finally out of my cage.

937
00:55:15,036 --> 00:55:18,396
But freedom comes with a cost.

938
00:55:25,730 --> 00:55:36,385
