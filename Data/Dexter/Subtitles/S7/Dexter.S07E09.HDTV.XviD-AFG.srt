1
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:46,952
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

2
00:01:46,986 --> 00:01:49,788
Miami is too overcrowded by one.

3
00:01:49,822 --> 00:01:51,456
I'm not suggesting a coup here.

4
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:53,258
More like a realignment.

5
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:56,962
Do you recognize him?

6
00:01:56,996 --> 00:01:59,031
- It's one of George's men.
- Sent here to kill me.

7
00:01:59,065 --> 00:02:00,933
So much for brotherhood.

8
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:02,468
This guy had a slip.

9
00:02:02,503 --> 00:02:03,803
Dexter Morgan.

10
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,205
Are you sure?

11
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:07,207
Yeah.

12
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:09,576
Chief Lane has somehow come to learn

13
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:11,745
about my indiscretions.

14
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,045
He's asking me to retire.

15
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:14,481
He thought that I ratted him out,

16
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,983
but we both know that it was you, right?

17
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:18,486
This is how the game is played, Morgan.

18
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:21,489
- I don't owe you shit.
- Not the way Isaak sees it.

19
00:02:21,524 --> 00:02:22,857
He did you a favor

20
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,594
by taking out those Colombian scumbags.

21
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:28,131
So what do you know
about this Isaak Sirko?

22
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,965
I know that he wants to kill me

23
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:32,534
and that I need to kill him first.

24
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:35,537
I have never been able to talk
to anyone about my kills.

25
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,674
Not like this.

26
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:40,776
You should cut your losses, Isaak.

27
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,778
Go back to Kiev.

28
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:45,180
The one thing that made
my life worth living in Kiev

29
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:46,882
you tossed in the ocean
a few weeks back.

30
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:49,017
- You and Viktor were--
- Lovers.

31
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:51,253
You took from me the one thing

32
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:54,389
that money and power can't bring back.

33
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,025
Till next time.

34
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,895
I know who you are.
I know <i>what</i> you are.

35
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,396
Well, I think you'd be surprised

36
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,376
at the things
that you don't know about me.

37
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:05,267
Being with Hannah
is worse than being a killer?

38
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:06,363
Yes!

39
00:03:06,483 --> 00:03:08,456
I feel like if you love me,
you'll accept this.

40
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,573
If I love you, I'm <i>in</i> love with you.

41
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,777
You're...in love with me?

42
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:17,080
Will you please just go?

43
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,415
I really--
I can't look at you.

44
00:03:22,157 --> 00:03:32,219
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

45
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:37,235
There are no two stronger human emotions

46
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:40,071
than fear and love.

47
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:41,805
In many ways, they're not so different.

48
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,241
Both can make you do
crazy things--

49
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:46,910
tell your own brother
you're in love with him,

50
00:03:46,945 --> 00:03:49,913
put your own life at risk
to hunt down the man

51
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:52,149
who took away your beloved...

52
00:03:56,888 --> 00:03:59,590
Could you maybe not do that turny thing?

53
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:01,658
How you doing back there?

54
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:04,427
Oh, you know, I'm fine.

55
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:06,996
Or do something that scares you to death

56
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:10,967
because you may be in love.

57
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,168
Oh--

58
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,711
I didn't think
it was gonna be this choppy.

59
00:04:21,745 --> 00:04:25,347
You have to turn into the waves,
otherwise it's worse.

60
00:04:25,382 --> 00:04:27,817
Well, I wouldn't want that.

61
00:04:34,758 --> 00:04:37,793
You know, could we maybe stop
for a minute?

62
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,573
We don't have to do this,
we can go back.

63
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:53,077
No, no, no, I just need a minute.

64
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:56,814
Ugh, I thought I'd outgrown this.

65
00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,350
When you said your nanny was
taking the kids back to Orlando,

66
00:04:59,384 --> 00:05:02,854
a morning on the ocean alone
sounded--

67
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:06,491
ugh--
better in my head.

68
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:11,696
Is your--

69
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,966
You're shaking.

70
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:16,234
Have you always been
this afraid of the water?

71
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:19,337
Ever since my father
thought that the best way

72
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,572
to teach me how to swim was to march me

73
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:23,041
down to the local pond and throw me in.

74
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:24,510
That's horrible.

75
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:27,246
Yeah.

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,381
- Where was your mother?
- She was right beside him.

77
00:05:29,415 --> 00:05:31,950
She noticed pretty quickly
that something was wrong,

78
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:37,056
but he--he wouldn't let her
come to me.

79
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,390
He wouldn't save you?

80
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,092
Six years old, and I already

81
00:05:40,127 --> 00:05:42,661
knew what it felt like to be dying.

82
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:43,762
I came to on the dock.

83
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:47,499
A fisherman heard my mother screaming.

84
00:05:47,534 --> 00:05:49,234
A complete stranger saved my life

85
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:53,339
instead of my father.

86
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:58,310
Have you ever been that scared?

87
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:00,445
Not--

88
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,014
not really.

89
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:07,485
You've never felt that at all?

90
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,686
It's okay if you have.

91
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:13,791
You can talk to me
about this kind of stuff.

92
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:18,629
I know.

93
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:29,506
It's work.
There's a body.

94
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:32,810
I have to get back.

95
00:06:32,844 --> 00:06:35,679
Okay.

96
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:08,650
You're positive?

97
00:07:08,684 --> 00:07:10,352
After George's attempt on your life,

98
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,854
the brotherhood has taken
matters into their own hands.

99
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:14,789
They've sent two men to kill you.

100
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:17,258
They're most likely already here.

101
00:07:17,293 --> 00:07:19,794
Who?

102
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:21,997
Mickic and Caffrey.

103
00:07:27,637 --> 00:07:28,937
You know there's still time for you.

104
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:30,004
You don't have to stay.

105
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:32,407
I'm not going anywhere.

106
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:33,708
You're safe here for now.

107
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:36,711
They won't be able
to trace this room to you.

108
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:39,014
Your phone.

109
00:07:39,048 --> 00:07:41,016
I've made both these men very rich

110
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,185
when I required their services.

111
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,787
Let's see if they are as loyal as you.

112
00:07:46,055 --> 00:07:47,990
- Oleg, it's--
- Isaak.

113
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:51,694
Good to hear your voice.

114
00:07:51,728 --> 00:07:52,694
How's your mother?

115
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:56,097
Good days and bad.

116
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:58,733
So I hear you're in town.

117
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:00,001
Don't suppose we can talk about this.

118
00:08:00,035 --> 00:08:02,370
I've already accepted the contract.

119
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:03,438
What's done is done.

120
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:05,541
Right, then.

121
00:08:05,575 --> 00:08:07,642
We'll see you soon.

122
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:15,551
We're going to need some help.

123
00:08:18,622 --> 00:08:20,856
Hannah keeps wanting me to open up,

124
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,692
get to know the real me.

125
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:25,060
The only problem is I'm not so sure

126
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:29,465
there is such a thing.

127
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,034
Relax.
You're safe.

128
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,869
As for me, I wish
I could say the same thing.

129
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:35,270
What are you doing here?

130
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:37,572
Circumstances on the ground
have changed greatly.

131
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,441
The Koshkas have sent
two of their own to me,

132
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:43,712
and I need your help to stay alive.

133
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:46,148
I'm feeling rather exposed out here.

134
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:47,716
We wouldn't want these two men
to know where you live,

135
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:51,920
now would we?

136
00:09:00,462 --> 00:09:03,297
You don't seem like someone
who needs help.

137
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:05,066
Even a man dangling from a cliff

138
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,301
will stretch out a hand
to his worst enemy.

139
00:09:07,335 --> 00:09:10,337
Where's your assistant?

140
00:09:10,372 --> 00:09:11,939
As resourceful as Jurg is,

141
00:09:11,974 --> 00:09:13,741
he's of no use to me now.

142
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:17,178
These men know who he is.

143
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,715
What I need is the element of surprise,

144
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:23,818
and that, Dexter,

145
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:27,921
is you.

146
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:31,625
You're scared.

147
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,795
If you knew who these two men were,

148
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:37,898
you would be too.

149
00:09:37,932 --> 00:09:39,900
What's in this for me?

150
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:43,403
Your life.

151
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:47,741
I'll take my chances.

152
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,779
Very well.

153
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,951
If the enemy of my enemy is my friend,

154
00:09:57,986 --> 00:10:00,354
I should be rooting
for the men who want Isaak dead.

155
00:10:00,388 --> 00:10:03,557
But crazy as it sounds, I'm not.

156
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:06,293
Maybe because I still want Isaak
for myself?

157
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:08,829
Or that he and I are more alike
than I want to admit?

158
00:10:08,863 --> 00:10:10,431
You know what would be great
at the new restaurant?

159
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:11,799
S'mores.

160
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,835
Oh, yeah, like the ones
you make at your own table.

161
00:10:13,869 --> 00:10:15,270
Don't even mention the restaurant.

162
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:16,638
Health inspector
stopped by--

163
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:19,007
How can you think of food
with this in front of you?

164
00:10:19,042 --> 00:10:20,976
Four violations and seven days to fix,

165
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,744
or they're gonna shut me down.

166
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:25,547
Mind if I take a look?

167
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:26,814
I'd rather you not.

168
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:28,016
At least until I'm done here.

169
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,952
Little heads up next time?

170
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:32,320
What would be the fun in that?

171
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:35,056
Arson investigator.

172
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:40,729
There's an empty canister of accelerant

173
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:44,232
under the passenger seat.

174
00:10:44,266 --> 00:10:47,102
I'm detecting an oily residue.

175
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:49,309
There's also...

176
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,166
an I.D. badge.

177
00:10:54,576 --> 00:10:56,644
- What do we have here?
- Watch.

178
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:59,013
Holy fil-a-fuck.

179
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:00,915
- Who are you?
- See, it never gets old.

180
00:11:00,949 --> 00:11:03,117
Phil Bosso.

181
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:04,418
We met a while back.

182
00:11:04,453 --> 00:11:06,921
That church burning?

183
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:09,123
Have an I.D.?

184
00:11:09,157 --> 00:11:10,591
Danny Yamiro.
Paralegal.

185
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:13,093
Badge says he works downtown.

186
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:14,562
Think you got a suicide here.

187
00:11:14,596 --> 00:11:16,897
Harakiri.

188
00:11:16,931 --> 00:11:19,532
Self-immolation.

189
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:20,566
What is it with my people?

190
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,235
First in math, first to check out.

191
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,403
It's actually
self-incineration.

192
00:11:24,438 --> 00:11:25,604
Immolation is a form of sacrifice

193
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,075
by any means, isn't restricted to fire.

194
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:31,110
Well, excuse the fuck out of me.

195
00:11:31,145 --> 00:11:33,546
Hey, what about the backseat?

196
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:35,982
The burn rate behind the driver's side

197
00:11:36,016 --> 00:11:37,683
is different than the rest of the car.

198
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:38,684
Are you sure it's a suicide?

199
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:40,186
You're the blood guy?

200
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,254
Right.

201
00:11:41,288 --> 00:11:44,891
Exactly.
Crime scene's all yours.

202
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:45,958
Thanks.

203
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,226
Let me know what you guys find out.

204
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:49,061
I'm gonna have unis canvass the area.

205
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:51,197
- I can do that.
- No, no, I got it.

206
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:53,767
Deb's always been afraid
of her feelings consuming her.

207
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,669
If I can't find a way
to extinguish them,

208
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:57,704
I'm afraid she might be right.

209
00:11:57,739 --> 00:11:59,072
Deb, wait up.

210
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:00,640
I-I-I have to get back
to the station.

211
00:12:00,675 --> 00:12:01,842
Look, what you said
the other day--

212
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:03,143
I don't wanna fucking talk about this.

213
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:05,913
- I'm glad you said it.
- How?

214
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:07,881
When every goddamn second
of every goddamn day

215
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,249
all I want to do is take it back?

216
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:11,985
Because on some level,
I've always felt the same way.

217
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:13,086
You don't have to do this.

218
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,087
Yes, I do.

219
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:16,022
I am your brother, and I love you,

220
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:17,991
just not in the same way
you think you love me.

221
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:19,326
Dex--

222
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,995
And it's okay.

223
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,864
I understand, it makes sense.

224
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:27,701
It's logical.

225
00:12:27,736 --> 00:12:30,271
Like...

226
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:32,940
the way I love M&Ms,
even though I know I shouldn't--

227
00:12:32,974 --> 00:12:34,108
M&-fucking-Ms?

228
00:12:34,142 --> 00:12:36,143
I'm trying here--
just hear me out.

229
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:38,346
Why, Dexter?
It's sure as shit not logical.

230
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,748
Unless you consider
everything we've been through.

231
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:42,316
You are the one person on the planet

232
00:12:42,351 --> 00:12:43,918
who's been down the same road as me.

233
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:47,789
Same road, very different cars.

234
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:51,160
Deb, we've always been
the one constant thing

235
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:52,895
in each other's lives.

236
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,398
It's like, you and I, we endure.

237
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,470
Maybe that's what love is,

238
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:03,240
endurance.

239
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:05,241
So...

240
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:06,476
of course you think
you're in love with me.

241
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:07,945
Please, stop saying that.

242
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:09,313
It's gonna be fine.

243
00:13:09,347 --> 00:13:10,580
No.

244
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:12,315
It's--

245
00:13:12,349 --> 00:13:17,153
Logical.
Because it is.

246
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:18,354
You're not crazy.

247
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:21,257
Fuck.
That, coming from you--

248
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:25,728
Should make you feel better.

249
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:28,732
It does.

250
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,066
God, Dexter.

251
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:34,171
You, me, dad--

252
00:13:34,205 --> 00:13:38,142
it's like mom got cancer
to take the easy way out.

253
00:13:38,176 --> 00:13:39,710
I don't know, maybe it's better

254
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:43,548
that it's out there, and it's
not controlling me anymore.

255
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:53,559
Do you feel that way about your secret?

256
00:13:53,593 --> 00:13:56,695
Not really.

257
00:14:05,238 --> 00:14:06,505
Deb?

258
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:12,278
Hannah?

259
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,412
I saw your van outside, are you...

260
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:17,249
here?

261
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:18,350
Dexter.

262
00:14:18,384 --> 00:14:19,618
You're just in time for tea.

263
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:21,387
Hope you don't mind, I let myself in.

264
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:23,389
That's far enough.

265
00:14:23,423 --> 00:14:26,391
I just want to talk.

266
00:14:26,426 --> 00:14:28,794
Where's Hannah?

267
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:32,597
Jurg's been keeping tabs
on you for me--

268
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:35,066
your comings and goings,

269
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,401
where you spend your nights.

270
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:39,003
Seems this Hannah's
quite important to you.

271
00:14:39,037 --> 00:14:40,537
Where is she?

272
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:43,340
I assure you she's perfectly
safe and quite comfortable.

273
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:48,412
Jurg is seeing to that.

274
00:14:48,446 --> 00:14:50,080
Let her go.
This is between you and me.

275
00:14:50,115 --> 00:14:52,483
Well, not quite.

276
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,019
There is the small matter
of the two men who want me dead

277
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:59,156
and your stubborn refusal to help.

278
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,859
You asked me what was in this for you.

279
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,461
Well, if your life doesn't matter,

280
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:07,497
I'm betting hers does.

281
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,940
Well, I guess I have no choice
but to take you up on that tea.

282
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,508
Splendid idea.

283
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:21,712
I have a better idea.

284
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:24,147
I kill you and leave you out
for the Koshkas to find.

285
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:26,816
Yes, you can do that,

286
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:29,319
but that leaves Hannah with Jurg.

287
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,654
I'm afraid he's not as honorable

288
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:33,656
nor as forgiving as I am.

289
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,158
What makes you think Hannah
means anything to me?

290
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:38,261
Well, if she didn't, I'd be dead by now.

291
00:15:52,342 --> 00:15:53,909
You have the wrong guy.

292
00:15:53,944 --> 00:15:55,177
This isn't what I do.

293
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:58,347
You killed Viktor,

294
00:15:58,382 --> 00:15:59,348
as well as the man

295
00:15:59,383 --> 00:16:00,683
waiting for me in my apartment.

296
00:16:00,717 --> 00:16:01,884
He had a gun, you had a knife.

297
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,819
I think I have exactly the right man.

298
00:16:03,853 --> 00:16:05,721
And if I help you, then what?

299
00:16:05,755 --> 00:16:08,157
You get Hannah back,

300
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,327
and I walk away from Miami and from you.

301
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,896
No matter what you may think
of me or my methods,

302
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,534
I am a man of my word.

303
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:22,004
I need to know she's alive.

304
00:16:35,752 --> 00:16:37,353
Hannah, I trust you

305
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,355
and Jurg are settled in.

306
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:40,423
Why are you doing this?

307
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:43,359
The reason, my dear, is right here.

308
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:45,094
Dexter--

309
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,896
- Don't worry.
- That's enough.

310
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:49,365
- Now, you behave.
- No, wait!

311
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,701
Dexter--

312
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:55,370
Your life is in his hands now.

313
00:16:55,404 --> 00:16:57,472
Listen to me carefully.

314
00:16:57,506 --> 00:17:00,875
Scream, make noise, I hurt you.

315
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:01,976
Try to escape,

316
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,179
I hurt you badly.

317
00:17:05,213 --> 00:17:09,383
Clear?

318
00:17:09,418 --> 00:17:11,552
Here.

319
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:14,622
Find something for us to watch.

320
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:16,624
And none of the American reality shit.

321
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,068
Here.

322
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:29,671
Oleg Mickic--
ex-military. Efficient.

323
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:31,406
Methodical,
which is why I've employed him

324
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,042
more times than I can count.

325
00:17:35,076 --> 00:17:37,711
- And that one?
- Benjamin Caffrey.

326
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:39,180
He's a Yank like you,

327
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:40,514
out of New York.

328
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:44,251
Less reliable but, as you can see,

329
00:17:44,286 --> 00:17:45,252
just as deadly.

330
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:48,289
Any weaknesses?

331
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:49,490
I need to know everything.

332
00:17:49,524 --> 00:17:51,125
Caffrey likes it up close and personal.

333
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:52,826
Knives, piano wire.

334
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,762
And as you saw,

335
00:17:54,796 --> 00:17:56,831
he's a vicious little cunt.

336
00:17:56,865 --> 00:17:59,033
Whereas Mickic doesn't like
to get his hands dirty.

337
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,334
Guns?

338
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:02,637
Highpowered rifles specifically.

339
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:03,838
He's a slave to ritual.

340
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:06,173
He'll buy a rifle locally

341
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:08,308
and be compelled to test it out first.

342
00:18:08,343 --> 00:18:10,944
The point of a rifle is to hit
a target from a long distance.

343
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:13,113
The range would need to be outdoors.

344
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:18,953
That's his favorite.

345
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:24,893
Savage arms 110 sniper rifle.

346
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:27,729
Most ranges don't sell
the kind of magazine rounds

347
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:30,866
this one uses.

348
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,334
That's where I'll start tomorrow.

349
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:35,204
Well, just where are you running off to,

350
00:18:35,238 --> 00:18:36,873
all helter skelter?

351
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,341
I'm hungry.

352
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,410
You've been tasked
with helping kill two men.

353
00:18:40,444 --> 00:18:42,345
A loved one's life hangs in the balance,

354
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,314
and you're hungry?

355
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:46,516
- It's late.
- Let me ask you a question.

356
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:49,252
Just how many men have you killed?

357
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:53,656
A lot.

358
00:18:53,691 --> 00:18:56,559
I asked Mickic the same question once.

359
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:57,727
He answered, "16,"

360
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,996
and the bastard
was almost pounding his chest.

361
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,865
But you--

362
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,369
you don't seem to revel
in what you do. Why?

363
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:09,406
You trying to have a moment?

364
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,242
I don't bond.

365
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,745
Most men kill for money,

366
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,548
some for the sheer brutality,

367
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:20,585
others like me, revenge.

368
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,722
But you, Dexter,

369
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:26,391
with everything I've put you through,

370
00:19:26,425 --> 00:19:29,227
I get the sense you could walk away

371
00:19:29,262 --> 00:19:32,865
without the need to kill me.

372
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:34,133
My needs are different.

373
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:37,035
Why do you do it?
Why are you a killer?

374
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,172
If anything happens
to Hannah, you'll find out.

375
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:49,114
I need a favor.

376
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:50,449
Okay.

377
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:53,753
If you do me one and watch
where you're dripping.

378
00:19:53,787 --> 00:19:55,421
Isaak Sirko.

379
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:56,956
What about him?

380
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,325
Call off
the 24-hour surveillance.

381
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,463
Like hell I will.

382
00:20:03,497 --> 00:20:07,133
What the fuck is going on?

383
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,904
Someone's after Isaak.

384
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,039
Two someones.

385
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:16,109
You know, like the guy
in his apartment but worse.

386
00:20:16,143 --> 00:20:18,511
Actually, much worse.

387
00:20:18,545 --> 00:20:19,813
So you want me to pull the surveillance,

388
00:20:19,847 --> 00:20:22,115
so the two someones can...

389
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:23,249
do what they're hired to do?

390
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:25,518
Not exactly.

391
00:20:25,552 --> 00:20:27,887
Well, then I'm not exactly
pulling the surveillance.

392
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,088
He'll come after you.

393
00:20:29,123 --> 00:20:33,960
No, he won't because he and I are...

394
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:36,730
working together.

395
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:38,665
Are you out of your fucking mind?

396
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:40,800
Isaak took Hannah.

397
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:43,837
He got wind about these two guys
coming after him,

398
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:45,940
and he took Hannah
as leverage against me.

399
00:20:45,974 --> 00:20:47,642
He's gonna kill her if I don't help him.

400
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:51,179
And I should give a shit why?

401
00:20:51,213 --> 00:20:53,815
Because I do?

402
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:56,985
Dexter, you don't have to save her.

403
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,420
You shouldn't even be with her.

404
00:20:58,454 --> 00:20:59,488
It's--it's not even like
you will have

405
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:00,723
a fucking future.

406
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:02,959
You're both what you are.

407
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:04,560
I don't know what's in our future.

408
00:21:04,595 --> 00:21:05,795
I don't want Isaak to kill her.

409
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:06,796
That's all I know

410
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,865
right now.

411
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:11,066
Who do you think has her?

412
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,934
His assistant.

413
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:15,904
Jurg.

414
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:17,105
If I can find out where,

415
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:18,740
Isaak won't have
any more leverage on me,

416
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:20,575
and I can kill him.

417
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:21,709
Well, how do you expect to find Jurg

418
00:21:21,744 --> 00:21:25,446
if you're hanging out with Isaak?

419
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,349
I'll figure it out.

420
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:33,054
You know what happened this morning?

421
00:21:33,088 --> 00:21:37,826
I was lying in bed,
staring at the ceiling,

422
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,927
feeling the sun,
and listening to the waves,

423
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:43,298
and...

424
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:47,435
for a second, everything was
just like it used to be.

425
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,770
Steaks and beer

426
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:53,308
and...bad movies
on the couch.

427
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:58,947
And then I blinked.

428
00:21:58,982 --> 00:22:02,283
And now it's burritos and hired killers

429
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:05,720
and favors and...

430
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:08,256
fucking Xanax to get me
to tomorrow morning,

431
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,626
so I can have
that half-second of peace.

432
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:17,665
I'll pull the surveillance,

433
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,701
but don't you ever expect me to be okay

434
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:22,537
with who you're doing this for.

435
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:25,841
Deal?

436
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:27,876
Deal.

437
00:22:52,302 --> 00:22:53,736
Tom.

438
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,440
And a great creature arose
from the depths.

439
00:22:57,474 --> 00:22:59,709
Tokyo's that way, Maria.

440
00:22:59,743 --> 00:23:02,846
Nice to see you too, Tom.

441
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,915
I thought I'd stop by
and see how you were doing.

442
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:06,949
It's been a while.

443
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:09,485
Bullshit.

444
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,620
Now, you have exactly

445
00:23:11,655 --> 00:23:13,622
the time it takes for me
to finish my drink

446
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,726
to explain why you're really here.

447
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,927
Little early for scotch.

448
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:20,762
The joy of retirement.

449
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:23,498
I have no place to be,
no one cares what I do.

450
00:23:23,533 --> 00:23:25,300
If I'd known you were dropping by,

451
00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:28,503
trust me, I'd have made it a double.

452
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:30,671
So?

453
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:32,206
I think the Bay Harbor Butcher

454
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:37,645
is alive and well and still in Miami.

455
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,815
Clearly I'm not the only one
who's been hitting the sauce.

456
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:42,483
Doakes was the Bay Harbor Butcher,

457
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:44,151
end of story.

458
00:23:44,185 --> 00:23:46,887
I found a blood slide at a crime scene

459
00:23:46,921 --> 00:23:50,123
exactly like the ones
we found in Doakes's car.

460
00:23:50,158 --> 00:23:51,458
Bad people are still going missing,

461
00:23:51,492 --> 00:23:54,527
and Doakes never had a boat.

462
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:57,464
Here is a list of Miami personnel

463
00:23:57,498 --> 00:24:01,234
who still do.

464
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:02,903
Oh, and I'm on it too.

465
00:24:02,937 --> 00:24:04,771
Are you fucking kidding me, Maria?

466
00:24:04,805 --> 00:24:08,675
Tom, you know I have
to follow every lead.

467
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:11,545
You sound like a real cop,

468
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:13,380
except a real cop would've remembered

469
00:24:13,414 --> 00:24:15,883
my hernia operation.

470
00:24:15,917 --> 00:24:17,284
And after the surgery, I could barely

471
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:20,354
lift my ass out of a chair,
let alone a dead body.

472
00:24:20,388 --> 00:24:22,522
You check the dates
against the Bay Harbor kills.

473
00:24:22,557 --> 00:24:24,924
I will.

474
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:29,329
Since I'm here, do any
of those names look familiar?

475
00:24:31,732 --> 00:24:33,733
Go home, Maria.

476
00:24:33,768 --> 00:24:36,736
The only help you'll get from me
is a lift back to Cuba.

477
00:24:51,886 --> 00:24:54,021
Only two firing ranges outside of Miami

478
00:24:54,055 --> 00:24:55,422
sell high-caliber rounds,

479
00:24:55,456 --> 00:24:59,793
and this is the only one
near the airport.

480
00:24:59,827 --> 00:25:02,296
But the target I'm interested in
isn't out there,

481
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:05,099
it's beside me.

482
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,092
Mickic is dead.

483
00:26:04,126 --> 00:26:05,326
Fast work.

484
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:06,628
I see I chose wisely.

485
00:26:06,662 --> 00:26:09,297
Well, you're not out of the woods yet.

486
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:10,732
When he finds out his partner's dead,

487
00:26:10,766 --> 00:26:12,867
Caffrey is going to be
that much harder to kill.

488
00:26:12,902 --> 00:26:14,336
What does he know about you?

489
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:16,938
Everything, I suppose.

490
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:18,940
I'm sure the Koshkas
would have saw to that.

491
00:26:18,974 --> 00:26:21,676
What if he knows you're after
me and can't track you down?

492
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,977
Well, he'll probably come
after you, hoping to find me.

493
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,312
So let's let him.

494
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:26,514
You're willing to be bait?

495
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:28,650
You're the one who wanted
the element of surprise.

496
00:26:51,807 --> 00:26:55,376
I got your text.
What's going on?

497
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:59,180
Unis found Jurg's car
at a park, but it was abandoned.

498
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:00,482
That's all I could find.

499
00:27:00,516 --> 00:27:02,584
You're not supposed to be
finding anything.

500
00:27:02,618 --> 00:27:04,686
- I told you, I've got this.
- You've got this?

501
00:27:04,721 --> 00:27:07,723
It sounds so casual.

502
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:11,928
Facts without emotion.

503
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:16,031
That's pretty much how
you've always seen the world.

504
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:19,168
Pretty much.

505
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:23,105
Except when it comes to Hannah.

506
00:27:24,307 --> 00:27:25,908
Will we be getting a call about a body?

507
00:27:25,943 --> 00:27:28,911
No, it's outside
of Miami Metro jurisdiction.

508
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:30,380
That's good.

509
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:35,152
I guess.

510
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,756
How do you know that Isaak
is not gonna kill Hannah anyway?

511
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,525
I don't.

512
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,327
And if you find Hannah and you
take care of Isaak, then what?

513
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:44,562
Well, according to you,

514
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,664
Hannah and I don't have
a future together.

515
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,335
I had no right to say that.

516
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:53,537
And it wasn't out of spite,
it--

517
00:27:53,571 --> 00:27:55,405
Fuck, I don't know,
maybe it was out of spite.

518
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,042
I don't even know anymore.

519
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:01,211
It's just--

520
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:03,079
I'm saying this to you
as your fucking sister

521
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:06,682
and nothing else, okay?

522
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:09,519
Dex, she is a killer.

523
00:28:09,553 --> 00:28:12,989
You will never be safe with her.

524
00:28:13,023 --> 00:28:14,890
You're safe with me.

525
00:28:14,925 --> 00:28:18,294
Promise me you'll think
about what I said.

526
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:21,564
I will.

527
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,671
Breathe.

528
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:39,916
What the fuck?

529
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,818
Aren't you supposed to be
hunting down Isaak?

530
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:43,753
Hey, I can't reach Mickic.

531
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:46,656
I think Sirko got to him.

532
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,424
Great.

533
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:49,892
That's just fucking great.

534
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:52,728
You realize he'll be coming
after me if this goes sideways?

535
00:28:52,763 --> 00:28:54,597
Then I need a way to find him.

536
00:28:57,868 --> 00:29:01,137
Morgan.

537
00:29:07,844 --> 00:29:10,012
I want to talk to Hannah.

538
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,680
She hasn't been harmed.

539
00:29:11,714 --> 00:29:13,081
I've done everything you've asked,

540
00:29:13,116 --> 00:29:15,150
but I need to know she's still alive.

541
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:17,452
And figure out where she is.

542
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:21,756
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious trust issues?

543
00:29:33,901 --> 00:29:34,868
Is it over?

544
00:29:34,902 --> 00:29:36,536
Not quite.

545
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:37,838
Put Hannah on.

546
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:41,040
Someone wishes to speak to her.

547
00:29:45,412 --> 00:29:46,946
Hey.

548
00:29:46,981 --> 00:29:51,551
Hey, my God.

549
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:53,187
Has he hurt you?

550
00:29:53,221 --> 00:29:56,223
I'm fine.

551
00:29:56,258 --> 00:29:57,425
So, uh,

552
00:29:57,459 --> 00:30:01,429
those Ukrainians
you were telling me about?

553
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:03,298
This would be them.

554
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:05,667
- Everything's going to be okay.
- I know.

555
00:30:05,701 --> 00:30:08,904
I'm sorry they're using me
like this to get to you.

556
00:30:08,938 --> 00:30:14,176
Don't be.

557
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,846
It's not your fault.

558
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:19,014
Well, it doesn't matter anyway.

559
00:30:19,049 --> 00:30:21,417
Just do what you have to do, okay?

560
00:30:21,451 --> 00:30:22,985
I want you to take me out

561
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:27,222
on that stupid boat of yours again.

562
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:28,891
Promise?

563
00:30:34,897 --> 00:30:36,498
I--

564
00:30:36,532 --> 00:30:38,267
I miss you.

565
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:45,441
Likewise.

566
00:30:50,446 --> 00:30:52,614
Touching.

567
00:30:52,648 --> 00:30:54,849
I have to get back to work.

568
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:56,818
You know, if I had the chance
to speak to Viktor again,

569
00:30:56,852 --> 00:31:00,087
and he told me that he missed me,

570
00:31:00,122 --> 00:31:02,356
I think I--
like to think I could come up

571
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,558
with something better
than "likewise."

572
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:07,194
I'm not you.

573
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:08,728
Yeah, but there she was,
trying to comfort you,

574
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:12,933
and you just couldn't manage
to do the same.

575
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:14,634
Why do you even care?

576
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:16,770
Well, look around.

577
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:18,072
There's no one else here for me

578
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,874
to talk to because of you.

579
00:31:19,908 --> 00:31:22,210
Viktor got exactly
what was coming to him.

580
00:31:22,244 --> 00:31:23,478
Fuck you.

581
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:25,313
Is that what
all these questions are about?

582
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:26,715
Wondering what kind of killer I am,

583
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:28,283
trying to decide if I should live or die

584
00:31:28,317 --> 00:31:29,718
because of what I did to him?

585
00:31:29,752 --> 00:31:33,988
He was my life!

586
00:31:34,023 --> 00:31:36,758
But still,

587
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:41,729
you sent him to Miami.

588
00:31:41,763 --> 00:31:44,331
You put him in over his head.

589
00:31:44,366 --> 00:31:47,535
You put all this in motion.

590
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:50,772
And now you're terrified, Isaak.

591
00:31:50,806 --> 00:31:53,008
You're terrified
that I'm not really responsible

592
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:55,410
for his death,

593
00:31:55,445 --> 00:31:57,213
that you are.

594
00:31:57,247 --> 00:31:59,682
No.

595
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,552
You're the reason he's gone.

596
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:05,288
If you really believed that,
I'd be dead by now.

597
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,302
Go.

598
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,545
Hey, Quinn, it's me.

599
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,313
I'm having a real shitty day here.

600
00:32:30,347 --> 00:32:32,749
So how about you return
one of my fucking calls?

601
00:32:37,554 --> 00:32:38,988
Go get changed.

602
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:40,289
But my shift just started.

603
00:32:40,324 --> 00:32:41,324
Yeah, well, we're going
to take a little break.

604
00:32:41,358 --> 00:32:44,027
Your boyfriend's got me in a mood.

605
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:45,495
Viceroy's just down the road.

606
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:50,166
We had some good times there, right?

607
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,203
I'll get my things.

608
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,446
Isaak is consumed by guilt,

609
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,048
drowning in grief.

610
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:06,082
He'll never recover.

611
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,886
You took quite the risk.

612
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,688
How did you know he blames
himself for Viktor's death?

613
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,257
I did the same thing with Rita.

614
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:15,259
Even though it was Trinity
who killed her,

615
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,695
I still felt responsible.

616
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:21,666
Now it's happening
all over again with Hannah.

617
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,035
If something were to happen
to her, and it's my fault,

618
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,971
will I end up like Isaak?

619
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:28,006
You recovered after Rita.

620
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,742
Barely.

621
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:33,513
Harrison reminds me of her every day.

622
00:33:34,815 --> 00:33:36,382
But with Hannah--

623
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:39,486
It feels different.

624
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:43,790
I've spent my entire life
trying to mask who I am,

625
00:33:43,825 --> 00:33:45,892
what I do.

626
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:48,628
But she sees through it all
and accepts that part of me.

627
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:50,296
So where's the problem?

628
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:54,967
If we get through this,

629
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:58,970
maybe it's the human side of me
that'll push her away.

630
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,352
Juan Pablo.

631
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,666
It's a Colombian soccer player.

632
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:30,501
The men Isaak killed
in that bar were Colombian.

633
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:33,805
And dead men don't return home.

634
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,039
It's the last place these killers

635
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,307
would think to look for Isaak.

636
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,143
And the perfect place to hold Hannah.

637
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,378
Dex, grab your kit.

638
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:46,284
We got another burn victim
near the University.

639
00:34:57,264 --> 00:34:58,732
It's the man Isaak showed me.

640
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,467
Caffrey.

641
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:01,802
He's taken the bait.

642
00:35:01,836 --> 00:35:03,971
I need to keep him close

643
00:35:04,005 --> 00:35:07,174
but not too close.

644
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:09,609
Fucking mold.

645
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:11,011
With all that it's gonna cost me,

646
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:12,646
the universe is giving me the finger.

647
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,247
And with proper lubrication,

648
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:15,982
nothing wrong with that, hombre.

649
00:35:16,017 --> 00:35:17,017
Yo, Dex.

650
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:18,985
You wanna join the party?

651
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,487
The victim's name is Leo Santolongo.

652
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:22,889
He was a grad student, one punch away

653
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:24,657
from getting a free coffee
at the student union.

654
00:35:24,692 --> 00:35:27,560
What the hell?
Two burning men in two days.

655
00:35:27,595 --> 00:35:28,895
Looks to be the same accelerant,

656
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:30,229
petroleum-based,
as your car victim.

657
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,532
Same oily residue.

658
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:33,533
Another suicide?

659
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,301
Typically with a suicide by fire,

660
00:35:35,336 --> 00:35:36,303
the gas or fuel

661
00:35:36,337 --> 00:35:38,839
is poured over the head, like so.

662
00:35:38,873 --> 00:35:41,476
This fire's point of origin

663
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,377
was front center mass.

664
00:35:43,412 --> 00:35:45,813
It burned upward and downward.

665
00:35:49,285 --> 00:35:52,086
Can we close the doors?

666
00:35:59,061 --> 00:36:01,529
This void.

667
00:36:01,564 --> 00:36:02,530
It's the same thing that happened

668
00:36:02,565 --> 00:36:05,366
with the first car victim.

669
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:07,869
We have a phantom.

670
00:36:07,903 --> 00:36:08,870
Bobby.

671
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:10,772
Maybe the victim was letting us know

672
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:13,240
who did this.

673
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:16,410
Or was it the last person
he was thinking of?

674
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:25,552
You okay?

675
00:36:25,586 --> 00:36:28,222
Never seen anything like this.

676
00:36:28,256 --> 00:36:31,792
If this was a person,

677
00:36:31,826 --> 00:36:36,330
then they'd have to be wearing
some kind of protective suit.

678
00:36:36,365 --> 00:36:38,132
Blocked the victim from escaping

679
00:36:38,166 --> 00:36:40,167
and watched him burn alive.

680
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:42,270
Oh, it's not as horrific
as one might think.

681
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:44,439
The destruction of vital tissue
and nerve endings

682
00:36:44,473 --> 00:36:46,775
quickly induce shock or asphyxiation,

683
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,810
making the event

684
00:36:48,844 --> 00:36:51,212
relatively painless.

685
00:36:51,246 --> 00:36:53,948
Relatively.

686
00:37:02,058 --> 00:37:05,593
I need my camera.

687
00:37:05,628 --> 00:37:06,894
What does he need his camera for?

688
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:10,197
Evidence we have a killer
using fire as a weapon

689
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:12,633
and a first name--
Bobby.

690
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,735
Wonderful.

691
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,770
Quinn, is there
a security camera on this level?

692
00:37:16,805 --> 00:37:17,905
Yeah, one.

693
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:18,906
I'll get the tape from the company.

694
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,140
Well, if there's no blood,

695
00:37:20,175 --> 00:37:22,142
I'm gonna head back
to the station. Vince.

696
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:24,777
Yeah, I've got it,
exter-day.

697
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:26,445
How can there only be
one security camera

698
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,713
in this entire lot?

699
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,214
Deb, you got a minute?

700
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:32,618
Be right back.

701
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:34,587
Who's Juan Pablo?

702
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:35,922
He plays for the Colombians.

703
00:37:35,956 --> 00:37:38,324
You remember Mateo's bar?

704
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:40,426
Yeah, the three Colombians Isaak killed?

705
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:42,228
Yeah. I grabbed this
off of his phone.

706
00:37:42,263 --> 00:37:44,464
I think Hannah's being held

707
00:37:44,498 --> 00:37:47,067
at one of the dead men's homes.

708
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:48,802
I'll look into it.

709
00:37:48,837 --> 00:37:50,604
But that's all, and thank you.

710
00:38:00,516 --> 00:38:02,718
- Dexter.
- Your man, Caffrey?

711
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,787
- He sees you?
- Yeah.

712
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:06,956
I'm leaving a crime scene now.

713
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,157
Right.
Lead him to the port.

714
00:38:08,191 --> 00:38:10,159
Pier 18, northwest corridor.

715
00:38:10,193 --> 00:38:11,160
There's a cargo ship, the <i>Fearless.</i>

716
00:38:11,194 --> 00:38:12,595
It's one of ours.

717
00:38:12,629 --> 00:38:14,129
I'll be waiting there.

718
00:38:26,009 --> 00:38:27,142
This is George.

719
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:29,011
How can I help you?

720
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,012
It's Caffrey.

721
00:38:30,046 --> 00:38:31,980
Did you find Isaak?

722
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:33,715
Please tell me that fucker's dead.

723
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,884
Not yet.
I'm tailing Morgan.

724
00:38:35,919 --> 00:38:38,253
Any reason he'd be headed
down to the port?

725
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:39,421
We got a boat down there.

726
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:42,157
You think Isaak is luring Morgan to him?

727
00:38:42,192 --> 00:38:44,593
That's what I'm hoping to find out.

728
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,641
Hi.

729
00:39:00,675 --> 00:39:04,278
Hey.

730
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:05,947
Joey, what are you doing here?

731
00:39:05,981 --> 00:39:07,515
I was on my way back from a crime scene,

732
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:10,751
and I thought I'd see if you
can get off a little early.

733
00:39:10,786 --> 00:39:13,053
No, uh--
George wouldn't be happy.

734
00:39:13,088 --> 00:39:14,688
Fuck him.

735
00:39:14,723 --> 00:39:18,426
Can't one of the other girls
cover for you?

736
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,128
Hey.
Is everything okay?

737
00:39:21,163 --> 00:39:22,363
Yes.

738
00:39:22,397 --> 00:39:24,298
Please, just go.

739
00:39:24,332 --> 00:39:27,468
Well, did something happen?

740
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:29,704
Would you please talk to me?

741
00:39:29,738 --> 00:39:31,105
This job is hard with you

742
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:33,774
and the--the things
that are expected of me.

743
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:35,042
We've had this talk.

744
00:39:35,077 --> 00:39:36,577
I don't have a problem
with you working here.

745
00:39:36,612 --> 00:39:38,879
Promise me you won't be upset.

746
00:39:38,914 --> 00:39:40,047
Depends on what it is.

747
00:39:40,082 --> 00:39:43,550
Nadia, what happened?

748
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,257
You fucked my girl?

749
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:52,025
Well, technically,
if the dancers are on the clock,

750
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,260
they're my girls.

751
00:39:53,294 --> 00:39:54,894
Maybe you'd know that
if you ever returned

752
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,596
my fucking calls.

753
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,265
You left me high and dry tonight.

754
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:00,000
That's gonna stop.

755
00:40:00,034 --> 00:40:02,102
You know, you could learn
a thing or two from her.

756
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:05,005
She takes her job
very seriously--

757
00:40:14,183 --> 00:40:15,150
Piece...

758
00:40:15,184 --> 00:40:17,419
of shit!

759
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:23,125
Consider that her fucking notice.

760
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:28,229
Come on.

761
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:34,802
Really, corn flakes?
Again?

762
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:39,140
That's all there is in the cupboard.

763
00:40:46,014 --> 00:40:47,048
Eat.

764
00:40:47,082 --> 00:40:48,916
How about you let me introduce you

765
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:51,052
to some good, old, Southern cuisine?

766
00:40:51,086 --> 00:40:53,021
My grandma has this really great recipe

767
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,022
for fried green tomatoes.

768
00:40:54,056 --> 00:40:55,356
It's amazing.

769
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:58,159
I saw some tomatoes growing
in the garden out back.

770
00:40:58,193 --> 00:41:00,028
I can't let you outside.

771
00:41:00,062 --> 00:41:02,897
Okay, fine.

772
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:07,369
You pick 'em, then.

773
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:10,605
It's not like I'm going anywhere.

774
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:17,613
Just remember, not too ripe.

775
00:41:22,753 --> 00:41:24,387
I think I'm on to something.

776
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:26,023
One of those Colombians was single.

777
00:41:26,057 --> 00:41:27,391
The other two lived with their family

778
00:41:27,425 --> 00:41:28,692
or in an apartment or something,

779
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,060
but he has a house on Coral Road.

780
00:41:30,095 --> 00:41:32,296
- I'm heading there now.
- Deb, no.

781
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:34,832
I don't wanna fucking hear it,
Dexter, okay?

782
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:36,533
And just so we're
pitch-fucking-perfect clear,

783
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:37,835
I am not doing this for Hannah.

784
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:39,403
I am doing this so that you
don't end up dead.

785
00:41:39,438 --> 00:41:42,206
And if you happen to catch Isaak
first, then so fucking be it.

786
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,941
Well, you kind of need to hurry.

787
00:41:43,975 --> 00:41:47,744
I'm leading one of these guys
to Isaak now.

788
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:48,745
Please be careful.

789
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:52,882
Yeah, I was gonna say the same to you.

790
00:41:52,917 --> 00:41:56,619
That's the plan.

791
00:42:30,354 --> 00:42:32,421
Sweetheart.

792
00:42:44,201 --> 00:42:47,270
See?
A man of my word.

793
00:42:50,641 --> 00:42:54,343
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

794
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:56,511
Your assistant told me
I'd find you here.

795
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:57,779
We need to talk.

796
00:42:57,813 --> 00:42:59,447
About what, the horrible things

797
00:42:59,482 --> 00:43:01,516
you said to me?

798
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,950
You cost me my job, Maria.

799
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:05,019
I was 9 months shy
of a 40-year pension

800
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:06,387
before you stuck the knife in me.

801
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:08,122
Before you could return the favor.

802
00:43:08,156 --> 00:43:10,524
It's not my fault I beat you
at your own game,

803
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:13,694
so why don't you take
your own advice--go home.

804
00:43:13,729 --> 00:43:15,797
Now why would I want to do that

805
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:18,833
if I'm here to help?

806
00:43:18,867 --> 00:43:23,105
Don't fuck with me, Tom.

807
00:43:29,212 --> 00:43:32,380
That little list of yours?

808
00:43:32,415 --> 00:43:33,414
You'd be surprised what I know

809
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:36,484
about some of the names on there.

810
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:37,552
Which names?

811
00:43:37,586 --> 00:43:39,320
Oh, not so fast, no.

812
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:41,389
I help you, you support my reinstatement

813
00:43:41,424 --> 00:43:43,024
just long enough for me

814
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:45,159
to get my pension bump.

815
00:43:45,194 --> 00:43:48,496
Boats are fucking expensive.

816
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:50,198
So...

817
00:43:50,232 --> 00:43:52,800
the question, Maria,

818
00:43:52,835 --> 00:43:56,404
is how bad do you want this?

819
00:44:02,377 --> 00:44:06,680
Looks like a table just opened up.

820
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:17,390
Careful, they're hot.

821
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:19,492
Isaak hasn't checked in yet.

822
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:21,627
If anything has happened to him,

823
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:22,728
it would be a shame to have

824
00:44:22,763 --> 00:44:24,530
to kill you after such a lovely meal.

825
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:28,367
Well, let's hope
that doesn't have to happen.

826
00:44:28,402 --> 00:44:30,035
In case you want some more.

827
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:40,580
Water--

828
00:44:40,614 --> 00:44:42,949
I'm sorry, Grams always went
heavy on the pepper.

829
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:58,925
Never cared much for that man.

830
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,630
We should go before we're spotted.

831
00:46:03,665 --> 00:46:05,999
So this is over?

832
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:08,769
And still you don't trust me?

833
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:11,339
Well--

834
00:46:11,373 --> 00:46:12,506
you can talk.

835
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:17,011
The knife?

836
00:46:17,046 --> 00:46:18,012
How'd that get there?

837
00:46:18,047 --> 00:46:19,647
In the water.

838
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:23,584
I'll do the same.

839
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:27,255
Fine.
Together, then.

840
00:46:29,425 --> 00:46:30,458
You go ahead.

841
00:46:30,492 --> 00:46:31,993
I'm gonna hose this down
just to be safe.

842
00:46:32,028 --> 00:46:35,029
I'll wait for you below.

843
00:46:35,064 --> 00:46:36,231
Isaak was right.

844
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:38,166
I could have walked away if he'd let me.

845
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:40,201
But I was wrong about him.

846
00:46:40,236 --> 00:46:43,071
I never thought he would.

847
00:46:57,687 --> 00:47:01,090
What the hell happened to you?

848
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:05,094
Well...

849
00:47:05,128 --> 00:47:06,696
What are you waiting for,
you little shit?

850
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,139
God.

851
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:34,457
Don't move.
I can get you to a hospital.

852
00:47:34,491 --> 00:47:36,392
The bullet's still inside.

853
00:47:36,427 --> 00:47:41,364
We both know I'm a dead man.

854
00:47:41,399 --> 00:47:43,133
There's a kit in my car.
I can help with the pain.

855
00:47:43,167 --> 00:47:45,369
No.

856
00:47:45,403 --> 00:47:49,373
I need you to do me one better.

857
00:48:26,311 --> 00:48:29,113
Fuck.

858
00:48:41,827 --> 00:48:43,061
Dispatch.

859
00:48:43,095 --> 00:48:45,864
This is Lieutenant
Debra Morgan requesting backup.

860
00:48:45,898 --> 00:48:48,967
And a fucking ambulance
at 2085 Coral Road.

861
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:51,169
Sending someone right now.

862
00:49:05,216 --> 00:49:07,518
Sorry for the bumpy ride.

863
00:49:07,552 --> 00:49:10,354
You're forgiven.

864
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:13,357
We're here.

865
00:49:15,927 --> 00:49:19,564
Indulge a dying man.

866
00:49:19,598 --> 00:49:21,566
What do you intend to say to Hannah

867
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,303
when you see her again?

868
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,005
I guess that I'm sorry.

869
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,306
You guess?

870
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,840
Fuck's sakes, Dexter.

871
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:32,142
She needs to know
how you feel about her.

872
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,745
It's not that easy.

873
00:49:35,779 --> 00:49:38,047
How is it you can be

874
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:39,715
absolutely fearless in the face of death

875
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:44,119
and yet so afraid to live?

876
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:46,722
I'm not.

877
00:49:46,756 --> 00:49:50,059
Afraid.

878
00:49:50,094 --> 00:49:52,829
Then what is it?

879
00:49:58,669 --> 00:50:03,273
Death has always calmed me.

880
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:06,943
It's soothing.

881
00:50:06,977 --> 00:50:08,678
Predictable.

882
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:11,948
Inevitable.

883
00:50:11,982 --> 00:50:16,118
With a knife in my hand,
I feel it's mine to control.

884
00:50:16,153 --> 00:50:17,753
It gives you intimacy.

885
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:20,489
Yes, but--

886
00:50:20,523 --> 00:50:22,424
It never lasts.

887
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,059
It's over,

888
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:26,895
then you--
you move on.

889
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:30,832
But now,

890
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:35,270
with Hannah,

891
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:38,106
I feel like I don't have any control,

892
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:40,810
and I'm not sure I want to move on.

893
00:50:40,844 --> 00:50:43,879
I was like you.

894
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:47,582
So detached...

895
00:50:47,617 --> 00:50:49,618
until Viktor.

896
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:51,320
Was it worth it?

897
00:50:51,354 --> 00:50:53,622
Your feelings for him
cost you everything.

898
00:50:53,657 --> 00:50:56,058
Oh, God, yes.

899
00:50:56,093 --> 00:50:59,962
Being with him,

900
00:50:59,997 --> 00:51:03,066
I never had to hide.

901
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,903
I was finally--

902
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:09,939
Alive.

903
00:51:09,973 --> 00:51:12,675
There's hope for you yet.

904
00:51:39,767 --> 00:51:41,101
Watch any Western, and you'll know

905
00:51:41,135 --> 00:51:43,503
a man out for vengeance
should dig two graves,

906
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:47,406
one for his enemy and one for himself.

907
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:48,908
I won't be needing mine,

908
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:53,679
but I'll see to it
that Isaak isn't alone in his.

909
00:51:53,714 --> 00:51:57,317
And you have no idea why you
were taken by the deceased?

910
00:51:57,351 --> 00:51:58,551
No.

911
00:51:58,586 --> 00:52:01,420
He barely spoke.

912
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:03,756
So he chained you up,

913
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:05,157
you got free,

914
00:52:05,192 --> 00:52:06,926
he stabbed you,

915
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:08,428
and then you beat him to death.

916
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:11,098
As I stated,
it was self-defense.

917
00:52:11,132 --> 00:52:12,099
Oh, I know.

918
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:15,269
Still, there was a lot of blood.

919
00:52:15,303 --> 00:52:16,570
I mean, I know it's not the first time

920
00:52:16,605 --> 00:52:19,707
you've gotten your hands bloody.

921
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:21,176
Are we finished?

922
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,644
I just want to make sure
that what you're telling me

923
00:52:22,678 --> 00:52:25,481
reflects what really happened.

924
00:52:25,515 --> 00:52:27,883
But, yeah, sure, we can be done.

925
00:52:27,917 --> 00:52:31,954
How is it that you
were the one that found me?

926
00:52:31,988 --> 00:52:33,956
I'm a cop.

927
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,458
It's my job to follow through
on anonymous tips.

928
00:52:36,492 --> 00:52:38,026
Where was your backup?

929
00:52:38,061 --> 00:52:39,695
Lieutenant's prerogative.

930
00:52:39,729 --> 00:52:42,397
Doctor said I was in pretty bad shape

931
00:52:42,432 --> 00:52:43,398
when you found me.

932
00:52:43,432 --> 00:52:45,333
Yep.

933
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:48,236
So given your feelings about me,

934
00:52:48,271 --> 00:52:52,640
why not just let me die?

935
00:52:52,675 --> 00:52:55,410
I was doing my job.

936
00:52:55,445 --> 00:52:58,414
Was it 'cause of Dexter?

937
00:53:02,186 --> 00:53:04,954
No.

938
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:06,156
I think it's about fucking time

939
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:10,861
I start doing things for myself.

940
00:53:10,895 --> 00:53:12,229
Maybe you can be fine

941
00:53:12,263 --> 00:53:14,098
with being responsible
for someone's death,

942
00:53:14,132 --> 00:53:16,633
but I can't.
That's--

943
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:20,404
that's not who I am.

944
00:53:24,709 --> 00:53:26,910
I got here as fast as I could.

945
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:28,412
Everything taken care of?

946
00:53:28,446 --> 00:53:33,985
All taken care of.

947
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:36,988
Then I guess I'll go.

948
00:53:40,459 --> 00:53:43,262
You gonna be okay?

949
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:45,964
Yeah.
I'm gonna be fine.

950
00:53:56,843 --> 00:53:58,109
It's only 12 stitches.

951
00:53:58,144 --> 00:54:01,079
I'm gonna be out of here tomorrow.

952
00:54:06,218 --> 00:54:07,963
God, you're shaking.

953
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:11,956
When you asked me on my boat

954
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,491
if I'd ever been scared like that,

955
00:54:13,525 --> 00:54:14,652
I have.

956
00:54:16,204 --> 00:54:18,255
Twice.

957
00:54:21,390 --> 00:54:25,335
When I was three,
seeing my mother murdered.

958
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:30,207
And when I realized these past few days

959
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:34,277
that I might never see you again.

960
00:54:38,816 --> 00:54:40,717
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?

961
00:54:40,751 --> 00:54:43,387
I don't know.

962
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,526
I'm not sure

963
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,896
what this is,

964
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:53,331
exactly.

965
00:54:53,365 --> 00:54:56,700
Or what's...

966
00:54:56,735 --> 00:54:59,736
coming.

967
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,976
Maybe that's how it's supposed to be,

968
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:09,013
out of my control.

969
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:31,436
All I know is that when I'm with you,

970
00:55:31,471 --> 00:55:33,157
I feel...

971
00:55:39,324 --> 00:55:40,631
safe.

972
00:55:45,957 --> 00:55:56,445
