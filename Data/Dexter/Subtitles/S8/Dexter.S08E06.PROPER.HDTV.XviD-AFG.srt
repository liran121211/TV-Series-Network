00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:48,948
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,302
Who's the guy that
dropped you off this morning?

4
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:51,581
We didn't sleep together,

5
00:01:51,605 --> 00:01:52,705
if that's what you're
getting at.

6
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,640
You are certainly allowed
to be a player.

7
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,732
You remember Cassie, right?

8
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,579
- Yeah, new neighbor. Hi.
- Hi.

9
00:01:59,613 --> 00:02:00,783
I kind of need to leave.

10
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:02,748
Go. I'll take care of Jamie.
We'll be fine.

11
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:03,916
Maybe we could reschedule?

12
00:02:03,951 --> 00:02:05,910
Yeah.
I'd like that.

13
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:08,225
Any reason why you haven't
taken the sergeant's exam?

14
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,860
I got your brother on my ass

15
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:11,361
about taking
the sergeant's test--

16
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,530
And what is so wrong
about trying to better yourself?

17
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:14,765
You nailed it, bro.

18
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:15,999
Is he your choice for sergeant?

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,935
I'm ready to take on
more responsibility.

20
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:20,738
I want you to strongly
consider making her sergeant.

21
00:02:20,772 --> 00:02:22,406
I think you may be my father.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,775
Family showing up like that
out of nowhere?

23
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,210
A lot of times,
they just want something.

24
00:02:26,244 --> 00:02:28,579
I want to hire you to do
a background check on someone.

25
00:02:28,613 --> 00:02:30,080
You really think
she's here to rip you off?

26
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:32,116
I don't know what to think.

27
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,751
Norma Rivera.

28
00:02:33,785 --> 00:02:35,853
She'd been having an affair
with the boss, Ed Hamilton.

29
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,489
- Dad, what's going on?
- The Hamilton son.

30
00:02:38,523 --> 00:02:40,424
Did you go to the place
where Norma Rivera was killed?

31
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:41,692
I did.

32
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:44,194
What did you see in your,
you know, analysis?

33
00:02:44,229 --> 00:02:45,863
- Leave the kid alone.
- He killed her.

34
00:02:45,897 --> 00:02:48,265
You don't know that.
Your only witness recanted.

35
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,501
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to.

36
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:51,702
Where's Yates?

37
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,705
So this is finally over.

38
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:55,839
My tormenter's dead.

39
00:02:55,874 --> 00:02:57,174
Thanks to you, Dexter.

40
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,442
And Deb.

41
00:02:58,476 --> 00:02:59,576
I'm glad to see
that you two have managed

42
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,145
to find your way
back to each other.

43
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,180
Well, the family
that kills together...

44
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:05,115
A few days ago,
everything seemed hopeless

45
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,350
between Deb and me.

46
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:08,652
But through Dr. Vogel,
I've got my sister back.

47
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,521
It's beautiful out here,
Dexter.

48
00:03:10,555 --> 00:03:14,124
I wanted to be with family.

49
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,573
Accidents happen,

50
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:32,075
shattering our sense
of control,

51
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,445
if not our lives.

52
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:40,050
It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.

53
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:42,286
He's drawn to blood, like me.

54
00:03:44,522 --> 00:03:47,291
Did he kill Norma Rivera?

55
00:03:58,369 --> 00:03:59,837
After a week of vetting him,

56
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,139
I haven't been able
to find definitive proof.

57
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:09,947
But I'm sure,
if I keep following him,

58
00:04:09,981 --> 00:04:12,416
the truth will become clear.

59
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:32,202
Or it could get murkier.

60
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:06,803
Dexter.

61
00:05:06,838 --> 00:05:08,572
Have you taken on Zach Hamilton

62
00:05:08,606 --> 00:05:09,573
as a patient?

63
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:10,807
It's nice to see you, too.

64
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:12,542
I have to protect you
from another murderer now?

65
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:13,911
How did he even get to you?

66
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,046
His father contacted me

67
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,083
because of my reputation
for working with psychopaths.

68
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:22,019
He's concerned
about his son's behavior,

69
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,454
his propensity for violence.

70
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:25,889
I think it's more
than a propensity.

71
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,294
I think Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

72
00:05:30,328 --> 00:05:33,497
And I take it that
you followed him here today

73
00:05:33,531 --> 00:05:35,465
because you're planning
to kill him?

74
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,267
The thought had
crossed my mind, yes,

75
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:39,136
if I can find solid proof.

76
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,170
Well, then it would seem

77
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:45,075
that we have a conflict
of interest.

78
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:48,045
I don't believe this.

79
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,346
You're going to work
with another killer

80
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,882
after what happened with Yates?

81
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:54,217
Dexter,
I appreciate your concern,

82
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:55,652
but I'm not going to talk

83
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:59,256
about Zach Hamilton
with you any further.

84
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,857
It wouldn't be ethical.

85
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:03,193
Suddenly,
you're worried about ethics?

86
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:04,361
I know.

87
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,762
I threw them out the window
when I met you

88
00:06:05,797 --> 00:06:08,432
because my life
was on the line.

89
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,267
Now the threat is over.

90
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:12,669
And you're bringing
another threat into your life.

91
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:16,707
It's my work.
What can I say?

92
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:19,042
I treat dangerous people.

93
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,877
It's a hazard of the job.

94
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:22,179
Besides, you have no proof

95
00:06:22,213 --> 00:06:24,681
that Zach Hamilton
is guilty of anything.

96
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,516
I will.

97
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:28,685
If you do,

98
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,088
then come to see me first

99
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:32,889
before you do anything,

100
00:06:32,924 --> 00:06:36,126
and we'll have
another conversation.

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,196
Would you do me that favor?

102
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,232
We'll see.

103
00:06:53,144 --> 00:06:54,705
I mean, this is
why she tracked me down,

104
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:55,679
to hit me up for money.

105
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:57,848
You don't know that.

106
00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:00,384
I mean, maybe she genuinely
wanted to get to know you.

107
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:03,320
Well, at the same time
her Hyundai's being repossessed?

108
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:04,688
Has she asked you for money?

109
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:07,557
No, but she always seems
to be missing her purse

110
00:07:07,592 --> 00:07:10,694
when the check comes.

111
00:07:13,831 --> 00:07:15,332
I thought we had
a real connection.

112
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:18,535
You like having Niki
in your life?

113
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:19,870
Yeah, I do.

114
00:07:19,904 --> 00:07:20,871
Then why don't you
just wait it out

115
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:23,140
and see how it plays out?

116
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:26,143
In the meantime,
you can enjoy her company.

117
00:07:29,247 --> 00:07:31,982
Okay.

118
00:07:36,988 --> 00:07:38,622
Thanks, Deb.

119
00:07:38,656 --> 00:07:41,391
Welcome.

120
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:46,396
Deb, got a new case.

121
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,631
Let me guess, someone suspects

122
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:50,867
their significant other
is fucking around on them.

123
00:07:50,902 --> 00:07:53,970
Yeah...but this one
is a bit different.

124
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:54,971
How?

125
00:07:55,006 --> 00:07:57,541
Because the person is me,

126
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,176
and the significant other,

127
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,778
my sister's ass-chasing,
shithead boyfriend.

128
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,814
Kevin Wyman, notorious player,

129
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:05,115
frequents a singles bar

130
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:06,883
in a hotel where he keeps
a hotel suite.

131
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,586
Have you tried
talking to her about this?

132
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,021
Susan doesn't listen to me.

133
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:13,623
It'd just push her
more quickly into his arms.

134
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:15,058
So that's off the table.

135
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:18,462
Well, going behind her back
seems kind of fucked up.

136
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:19,496
It's got to be done this way.

137
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,497
I gotta catch this guy
in the act.

138
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:21,698
I gotta present her
with the facts.

139
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:23,293
Okay, but you're doing it
by yourself.

140
00:08:23,301 --> 00:08:24,401
I need your help on this, Deb.

141
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:26,203
It'd be a lot less conspicuous

142
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:28,105
if we work this as a couple.

143
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:30,474
Well, I'm not sure
if I'm comfortable.

144
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:35,078
Well, are you comfortable
getting a paycheck?

145
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,516
Okay, boss.

146
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,052
Thank you.

147
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:47,858
Where does this piece go?

148
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:50,193
Right here.

149
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,062
Very good.

150
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:54,397
Dex, don't forget,

151
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,099
my birthday picnic's
in a few days, okay?

152
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:58,068
On the beach,
outside of Papa's.

153
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,102
Bring Harrison.

154
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:01,171
- Yeah, we'll be there.
- Great.

155
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:02,772
You know who else
will be there?

156
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,241
Cassie.

157
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:05,475
I heard you have a date
with her today.

158
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,110
No, it's not a date.

159
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:08,512
I just felt like I owed her one

160
00:09:08,546 --> 00:09:10,914
after we both bailed
on your dinner the other night.

161
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:12,582
Oh, my God,
why won't you just admit

162
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:15,452
that you like her and that
I am an awesome matchmaker?

163
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,654
I'll admit that
you're an awesome nanny.

164
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:19,256
You'll have to settle for that.

165
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:22,726
We'll revisit this
after the date.

166
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,094
Oh, by the way,

167
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:27,264
the TV remote has
been missing since yesterday.

168
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:29,499
I think somebody hid it,

169
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:32,903
but I can't get anything
out of him.

170
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,038
Harrison,
did you take the TV remote?

171
00:09:35,072 --> 00:09:36,606
No.

172
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:39,709
- Do you know where it is?
- No.

173
00:09:39,744 --> 00:09:40,844
He says he didn't take it.

174
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,445
Right.

175
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,915
Guess I'll just
keep looking for it.

176
00:09:48,452 --> 00:09:51,087
Homicide in Liberty City.

177
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,455
All right, Harrison,
it looks like

178
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,024
you're going to have to finish
that puzzle on your own.

179
00:09:54,058 --> 00:09:57,327
I'm doing all the work anyway.

180
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,596
Yeah, you are.

181
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,765
- Bye.
- Bye.

182
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,676
Welcome
to spatter-land.

183
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:13,977
Hope you brought extra string.

184
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,280
Never leave home without it.

185
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:18,548
Good news.

186
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,318
We have the victim's boyfriend
in custody.

187
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:23,987
A witness saw him
taking off from the scene,

188
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:26,189
and he forgot
to change his bloody socks.

189
00:10:26,224 --> 00:10:29,292
God bless stupid killers.

190
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,041
Once again, drawn to blood.

191
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:47,744
Looks like Zach has just
given me the in I need.

192
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:11,134
Zach Hamilton, right?

193
00:11:11,168 --> 00:11:12,669
You were at my house.

194
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,638
That's right.

195
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:17,774
You guys find out
who killed Norma?

196
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:22,012
No luck.
It's a dead end.

197
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,814
So you like
to shoot crime scenes?

198
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:27,584
Yeah, I got a police scanner
app on my phone.

199
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:28,585
It's better
than sitting at home,

200
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:29,953
playing video games.

201
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:31,554
You ever been on the other
side of the yellow tape?

202
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:34,658
Nope.

203
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,459
This is as close
as I've gotten.

204
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:40,363
Well, come on.

205
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:41,431
Are you serious?

206
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:44,267
Yeah,
just don't touch anything.

207
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:55,211
Whoa.

208
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:58,014
This is amazing.

209
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:00,950
I remember that feeling.
Awe, wonder.

210
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:02,552
It only fed the urge.

211
00:12:02,586 --> 00:12:06,556
Hey, can I take some pictures?

212
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:08,625
It's usually against protocol,

213
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,894
but what the hell?

214
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,095
Go ahead.

215
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:16,266
Cool. Thanks.

216
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,836
So what happened to her?

217
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,604
She was stabbed.

218
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,040
Yeah, obviously.
But, like, you know, how?

219
00:12:24,075 --> 00:12:26,009
If I open up to him,

220
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:27,410
maybe he'll open up to me.

221
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:32,849
Come on.
I can handle it.

222
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:35,318
Well, the victim
tried to defend herself.

223
00:12:35,353 --> 00:12:37,454
There were defensive wounds
on her body,

224
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,756
but you can also tell
by these big, round drops

225
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,560
on the ground.

226
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:47,097
And this multiple
cast-off spatter

227
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:49,999
suggests that she was stabbed
several times.

228
00:12:50,034 --> 00:12:52,936
And the arterial spurting here

229
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,373
indicates that the killer
severed her carotid artery

230
00:12:56,407 --> 00:13:00,210
with the first stab.

231
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:03,513
You can tell all that
just by looking at the blood?

232
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:05,448
Pretty much.

233
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:09,419
Awesome.

234
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,688
So I heard you caught
the guy who did it.

235
00:13:11,722 --> 00:13:13,556
- Yeah, her boyfriend.
- How?

236
00:13:13,591 --> 00:13:14,557
He was sloppy.

237
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:17,060
Left a bloody print and DNA.

238
00:13:17,094 --> 00:13:19,095
Plus, he was spotted
driving away from the scene.

239
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,964
Oh, yeah?
What kind of car?

240
00:13:20,998 --> 00:13:22,518
He must have heard
his Porsche was seen

241
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,867
at Norma's apartment.

242
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:26,870
No one noticed.

243
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:32,976
So the killer,
he--

244
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,912
he should've worn gloves
and long sleeves,

245
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:37,080
made sure he was covered up.

246
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:40,517
He's making this
a teaching moment.

247
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:44,421
Well, yeah, if he was smart.

248
00:13:44,455 --> 00:13:45,822
The kid's a quick study,

249
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,526
but that doesn't prove
he killed Norma Rivera.

250
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,494
Uh, so, hey,
I-I gotta get going,

251
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,131
but thanks.

252
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:56,866
Hey, why don't you
give me a call

253
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,268
when you print those up?

254
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,237
I'd love to take a look.

255
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:06,242
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

256
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:12,015
Time to make
another connection.

257
00:14:17,221 --> 00:14:20,323
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

258
00:14:20,357 --> 00:14:22,358
Thank you for doing this
with me.

259
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:23,827
When you own a food truck,

260
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,095
you kinda have to scope out
the competition constantly.

261
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,730
Plus I just really love to eat.

262
00:14:27,765 --> 00:14:29,165
Yeah, no problem.

263
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,401
I wouldn't miss these
peanut butter and Nutella fries

264
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,336
- for anything.
- Mm-hmm.

265
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:41,211
So you're indulging me
in my favorite pastime.

266
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:42,979
What do you like to do for fun?

267
00:14:43,013 --> 00:14:46,082
You know, normal stuff.

268
00:14:46,116 --> 00:14:48,685
Like what?

269
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:52,288
Um...

270
00:14:52,323 --> 00:14:53,723
I like spending time
with my son.

271
00:14:53,757 --> 00:14:55,725
Mm, I already know
you're a great dad.

272
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:57,927
What else?

273
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:59,863
I love my job.

274
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:04,033
But that's work.
What are you passionate about?

275
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,604
I like to bowl.

276
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:11,274
You're passionate
about bowling?

277
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:13,142
No.

278
00:15:13,177 --> 00:15:14,410
Of course not.

279
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:18,047
I, uh, just do it for fun,
once in a while.

280
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:21,150
Uh, what about your weekends

281
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:24,354
or your free time?

282
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:26,256
Oh, I have a boat.

283
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,690
Oh, I love to sail.

284
00:15:27,725 --> 00:15:30,293
No, it's a motorboat.

285
00:15:30,327 --> 00:15:32,595
Oh.
You water-ski?

286
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,264
No.

287
00:15:34,298 --> 00:15:37,767
- Race?
- No.

288
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:38,922
Do you scuba dive?

289
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:40,870
No.

290
00:15:42,239 --> 00:15:44,607
What do you do on your boat?

291
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:47,043
I just...

292
00:15:47,077 --> 00:15:51,014
take it out and...

293
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:54,150
turn around and come back.

294
00:15:54,184 --> 00:15:55,718
That's it?

295
00:15:55,753 --> 00:15:58,121
That's all I can tell you.

296
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:01,424
I think we may need
some alcohol.

297
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:04,494
Right.

298
00:16:04,528 --> 00:16:07,597
Dating is harder
than I remember.

299
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:15,505
Oh, this guy
is fucking pathetic.

300
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,140
I get that you hate the guy,

301
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:18,141
but looking isn't cheating.

302
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,142
It's a slow night.

303
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,978
Give him a minute.

304
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:24,847
So you said Susan
doesn't listen.

305
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:27,483
Does that mean you all
have a strained relationship?

306
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,118
Not from my end, no.

307
00:16:29,153 --> 00:16:32,722
But from hers?

308
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,490
Yeah, you know, probably.

309
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:38,161
I mean, look, I couldn't wait
to get away from my old man,

310
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:39,963
and unfortunately,
Susan was just a kid.

311
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:44,867
You know, I should have
at least picked up the phone.

312
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:49,706
But I never did,
you know, so...

313
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,576
Well, you can't undo the past.

314
00:16:53,611 --> 00:16:56,779
And families fuck you up.
That's just the way it is.

315
00:16:56,814 --> 00:17:00,216
Well, I can stop Susan
from fucking up her future.

316
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,454
I can do that.

317
00:17:04,488 --> 00:17:07,156
It looks like he's
packing it in for the night.

318
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,825
Elway, if you wanna
catch this guy cheating,

319
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,927
why don't I set him up
and see if he takes the bait?

320
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:12,996
No, I don't want you
doing that.

321
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,063
I worked Vice.

322
00:17:14,098 --> 00:17:18,067
I've done worse
than that before.

323
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:19,622
I just need to get
a couple of pictures

324
00:17:19,637 --> 00:17:20,770
of him hitting on you.

325
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:22,205
Certainly nothing more
than that.

326
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:23,673
Are you sure?

327
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:25,041
I mean, I could marry him,

328
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:28,578
maybe pop out
a couple of babies.

329
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:32,248
Let's go.

330
00:17:46,764 --> 00:17:48,231
Dexter, thanks for coming.

331
00:17:48,265 --> 00:17:49,732
Sure.

332
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,234
Couldn't wait to show you
these photos.

333
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:53,436
Yeah, no problem.
It's on my way to work.

334
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,837
Donut?

335
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,773
Fuckin' A.

336
00:17:58,876 --> 00:18:01,644
Mmm.

337
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,614
Well?

338
00:18:06,283 --> 00:18:09,986
He treats the blood
like a swimsuit model.

339
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,722
Well...

340
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:14,691
very colorful.

341
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:16,046
You know,
a lot of photographers

342
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,394
like to mute down their reds.

343
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,030
You know,
find it too distracting,

344
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:23,766
but I like to ride
the saturation.

345
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:26,335
Hmm.

346
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,604
You think I overdid it?

347
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:31,140
No way.
These are you.

348
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,975
That's the important thing.

349
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,945
Well, I can work you up
some prints, if you want.

350
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:37,547
I mean, I wouldn't have 'em
if it weren't for you.

351
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:40,883
Actually, I think I have
plenty of my own.

352
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,020
Right.

353
00:18:44,054 --> 00:18:47,056
Of course.
I forget it was a crime scene.

354
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,524
Keep thinking that dead chick

355
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,894
spilled all that blood
just for me.

356
00:18:57,935 --> 00:19:00,803
Who's she?

357
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:03,773
Uh, it's nothing.

358
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,943
Just a lens test.

359
00:19:06,977 --> 00:19:09,645
New 300 millimeter.
Fucking monster.

360
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,082
Wow.

361
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:16,552
Excuse me.
Yep?

362
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,395
Jesus, are you still drunk
from last night

363
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,897
or are you starting
a new bender?

364
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:29,232
Yeah, okay.

365
00:19:29,266 --> 00:19:33,202
Yeah, I said okay.

366
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:35,271
Uh, I gotta go.

367
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:36,626
- Anything wrong?
- No, it's fine.

368
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,909
I just gotta go.

369
00:19:39,943 --> 00:19:42,912
Sure, some other time then.

370
00:19:44,281 --> 00:19:48,184
I'll have to find another way
to get to him.

371
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:55,625
Ah, lieutenant.

372
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,127
Tell me something.

373
00:19:58,162 --> 00:19:59,829
Did you decide
you don't need a sergeant?

374
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:00,963
Sir?

375
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,598
I expected to hear
an announcement by now.

376
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:04,267
What's going on?

377
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:06,269
To tell you the truth,
I'm having trouble

378
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:08,571
narrowing down my choice.

379
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:15,878
I know you want me
to pick Miller.

380
00:20:15,913 --> 00:20:17,980
And on paper,
I can't argue with that.

381
00:20:18,015 --> 00:20:19,315
She scored higher on the test,

382
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:20,917
she's got the experience,
the track record--

383
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:22,985
She's African-American,
a woman.

384
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:26,355
Here's the thing,
Quinn has his attributes too.

385
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,491
Name one.

386
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:29,725
He's street-smart.

387
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,495
Look, I know
what's going on here.

388
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:33,529
What do you mean?

389
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,264
You want me to be the bad guy.

390
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,433
You want me to insist that
you promote Miller over Quinn.

391
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:40,036
That way you can tell Quinn,
"Hey, sorry, I had no choice."

392
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,538
- I'm not sure that's--
- You're lieutenant now.

393
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,207
It's time to grow
a set of balls.

394
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:48,244
I want to hear something
by the end of the day.

395
00:21:12,035 --> 00:21:15,304
Just like old times, huh?

396
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:18,441
You, me, steak, beer.

397
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:21,410
Yeah, it's been a while.

398
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:26,616
So how are things?

399
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,118
Good, great.
You?

400
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:32,788
Fine. Better.

401
00:21:32,823 --> 00:21:36,192
Good. I'm glad.

402
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:39,262
Me too.

403
00:21:39,296 --> 00:21:42,331
I think these are done.

404
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,874
So how's work?

405
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:54,210
Uh, crazy.

406
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:56,078
Elway wants to catch
his sister's boyfriend

407
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:57,513
fucking around on her,

408
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:01,384
so I offered myself as bait
so he'd get it done.

409
00:22:01,418 --> 00:22:03,986
What--you did what?

410
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:05,988
I used to do it
all the time in Vice.

411
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:07,523
Yeah, and you hated it.

412
00:22:07,557 --> 00:22:09,592
Why would you put yourself
in that position again?

413
00:22:09,626 --> 00:22:11,227
Because he's my boss.

414
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:14,864
And 'cause I can only take
one control freak at a time.

415
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,434
Sorry.

416
00:22:24,808 --> 00:22:27,777
This is tough.

417
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:30,279
A little.

418
00:22:30,314 --> 00:22:33,115
Not exactly worth living for.

419
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,251
What?

420
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:36,786
You said that once,

421
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,100
when you tasted
one of my steaks,

422
00:22:38,121 --> 00:22:40,156
that it was worth living for.

423
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:43,893
For some reason,
I've always remembered that.

424
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:47,396
It'll get easier, Dex.

425
00:22:47,431 --> 00:22:49,732
We're just getting
back in the saddle, you know?

426
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:52,068
Yeah, I think we might
be eating a saddle.

427
00:22:56,406 --> 00:22:58,808
Are you still
seeing Dr. Vogel?

428
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:00,276
Yeah, it's too bad for me

429
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,178
there's no magic pill
to cure PTSD.

430
00:23:02,212 --> 00:23:04,847
Well, as long
as she's helping you.

431
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:06,015
I don't get it.

432
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:07,249
Like, she knows
every fucking thing

433
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:08,351
about our lives because of dad,

434
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:10,186
but I don't know
Jack shit about her.

435
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,121
Like, where'd she get
that fucking accent?

436
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:15,057
And who the fuck is rich?

437
00:23:15,092 --> 00:23:17,760
- Her husband.
- She was married?

438
00:23:17,794 --> 00:23:19,729
Yeah, when I first
looked into her,

439
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,597
I found out some stuff
about her background,

440
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:25,001
and she was married
to a Dr. Richard Vogel.

441
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:27,103
Oh.

442
00:23:27,137 --> 00:23:29,972
Okay, so Harrison's asleep.

443
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,607
And look what I found
under his bed.

444
00:23:31,641 --> 00:23:33,109
Ooh, someone's in trouble.

445
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:34,510
He lied about it.

446
00:23:34,544 --> 00:23:35,945
At least now we know why.

447
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:37,847
I hope it's under warranty,

448
00:23:37,881 --> 00:23:40,049
or I'll be stuck
with whatever's on PBS kids

449
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,518
for the foreseeable future.

450
00:23:42,552 --> 00:23:43,819
I'll talk to him.

451
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:45,321
Okay.
Enjoy your dinner, guys.

452
00:23:45,355 --> 00:23:47,723
Bye.

453
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:52,661
Should I be worried
that Harrison's lying?

454
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:55,064
He's four, doofus.

455
00:23:55,098 --> 00:23:57,133
Right.

456
00:23:57,167 --> 00:23:59,835
This steak tastes like asshole.

457
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,037
Yeah.

458
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:02,738
Let's order pizza.

459
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:04,306
With pineapple, please.

460
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,676
Not on my half.

461
00:24:07,711 --> 00:24:09,845
Sorry, cow.

462
00:24:29,766 --> 00:24:32,034
What's up?

463
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:34,103
I'm promoting Miller
to sergeant.

464
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:37,206
Say that again?

465
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,475
I'm giving Miller the job.
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:42,545
I just think she's
the most qualified candidate.

467
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,080
Are you fucking kidding me?

468
00:24:44,114 --> 00:24:46,282
I mean, after all the quizzes,

469
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,517
and the speeches
about bettering my life?

470
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:51,320
You actually made me want this,

471
00:24:51,354 --> 00:24:53,556
and now you're going
to take it away.

472
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,624
Why? 'Cause I didn't solve
the fucking Norma Rivera case?

473
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,093
No, of course not.

474
00:24:57,127 --> 00:25:00,930
It's just a lot of other stuff
I can't ignore, man.

475
00:25:00,964 --> 00:25:04,800
The Nadia thing,
shooting Novikov.

476
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:05,801
You know what?
Fuck it.

477
00:25:05,836 --> 00:25:08,838
You did what you thought
was right.

478
00:25:08,872 --> 00:25:11,540
Leave it at that.

479
00:25:17,447 --> 00:25:18,747
Hey.

480
00:25:18,782 --> 00:25:22,518
I need everything you got
on the Norma Rivera case,

481
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:25,421
anything that points
to Zach Hamilton.

482
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:28,324
Uh, forensically,
there's not much.

483
00:25:28,358 --> 00:25:30,459
There's nothing, actually.

484
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:33,496
Fuck it.

485
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,297
I'll just tail
the little prick 24-7

486
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:36,465
until I get what I need.

487
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,567
If Quinn's stalking Zach,
how can I?

488
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:40,936
Won't even know I'm there
till I bust him.

489
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:45,741
You mind if I come along?

490
00:25:45,775 --> 00:25:48,144
You want to come along?

491
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:49,445
Yeah, things
are kind of slow here.

492
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:50,679
I'm going a little stir crazy.

493
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:52,515
Maybe you could use
another set of eyes?

494
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:55,417
Sure.

495
00:26:15,005 --> 00:26:17,173
I mean,
you think Miller's clean?

496
00:26:17,207 --> 00:26:18,607
Come on.

497
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:20,943
You dig deep enough
on anyone in this department,

498
00:26:20,977 --> 00:26:24,280
and you know what you find?

499
00:26:24,314 --> 00:26:26,282
- What?
- The shit.

500
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:28,751
It's there.
I mean, we all got it.

501
00:26:28,785 --> 00:26:31,954
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

502
00:26:31,988 --> 00:26:33,155
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

503
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,657
We've all got the shit.

504
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:36,192
Yeah.

505
00:26:36,226 --> 00:26:37,193
Big difference is,

506
00:26:37,227 --> 00:26:38,527
some people get away
with theirs,

507
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:41,363
and some people don't.

508
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:43,699
Well, you're a good detective.
It'll work out.

509
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:45,367
Yeah, I'm just worried

510
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,835
about how Jamie's
going to take it.

511
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:47,937
I think she was all excited

512
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,206
about me moving up
in the world,

513
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,074
making something
out of my life.

514
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:56,145
She'll probably break up
with my ass now.

515
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:57,346
Jesus Christ, I mean,

516
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,415
how many pictures
of fucking women in tights

517
00:26:59,449 --> 00:27:01,417
does this pervert need?

518
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:04,119
Apparently, a lot.

519
00:27:04,154 --> 00:27:06,989
How's Deb doing?
I've been worried about her.

520
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:10,526
She's good.
She's much better.

521
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,295
You guys work out
whatever your issue was?

522
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,697
What do you mean?

523
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:16,932
Well, I mean, you guys
have been connected at the hip

524
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,267
for most of your lives.

525
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:19,935
All of a sudden,
you're not talking,

526
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,670
you don't see each other.

527
00:27:22,772 --> 00:27:25,174
Somebody shit
in somebody's Cheerios.

528
00:27:25,208 --> 00:27:27,176
Yeah.

529
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,944
Just typical
brother and sister stuff.

530
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:31,814
- It's no big deal.
- Hmm.

531
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:33,048
Something had her fucked up.

532
00:27:33,083 --> 00:27:34,149
I mean, how weird was it

533
00:27:34,184 --> 00:27:36,318
that she confessed
to killing LaGuerta?

534
00:27:36,353 --> 00:27:38,420
I should have stayed
in my office.

535
00:27:38,455 --> 00:27:41,757
What was that about?

536
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,327
That's the woman in the photo

537
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:46,962
that Zach
didn't want me to see.

538
00:27:46,997 --> 00:27:49,365
And he isn't looking
at the class,

539
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:52,534
he's looking at her.

540
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:53,869
You know what I'm saying?

541
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:56,238
Fortunately, Quinn isn't.

542
00:27:56,273 --> 00:27:57,773
People do weird stuff
when they've had

543
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:00,242
too much to drink and they're
under a lot of stress.

544
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:03,379
We may never know
what that was all about.

545
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:04,647
All right.
See you guys later, yeah?

546
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:07,983
- Looks like they're done.
- So is our guy.

547
00:28:14,324 --> 00:28:17,926
Buckle up.

548
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:36,278
- Hey.
- Hey.

549
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:38,147
Wow.
Okay, uh--

550
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:40,049
- What?
- You look incredible.

551
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,450
Good job.

552
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:42,751
Well, that's the point.

553
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:44,286
Don't look
so fucking surprised.

554
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:45,587
Well, you didn't leave me
a lot of places

555
00:28:45,622 --> 00:28:46,622
to put the transmitter.

556
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:48,023
Are you bitching?

557
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:49,625
'Cause I'm the one
helping you, remember?

558
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:53,796
I just don't want to touch
anything I'm not supposed to.

559
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,130
Here.

560
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:06,175
Thank you.

561
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:12,314
- Mic?
- There you go.

562
00:29:18,988 --> 00:29:21,924
I'm not looking.
I'm not looking.

563
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,092
- Okay.
- Okay?

564
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:25,994
- Yep.
- All right.

565
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:31,367
Quickly,
just say something for me.

566
00:29:31,401 --> 00:29:32,968
You blush like a little girl.

567
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:36,739
Okay, just--

568
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:38,540
just get him alone.
That's all I need.

569
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:39,541
I'll take it from there, okay?

570
00:29:39,576 --> 00:29:42,244
- Okay.
- Thank you.

571
00:29:44,514 --> 00:29:47,349
I'm really glad we met.

572
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:50,986
Me too.

573
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,555
You know, I didn't know
if I mentioned it,

574
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,991
but tonight's kind of
a celebration.

575
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:57,793
- Yeah?
- Mm.

576
00:29:57,827 --> 00:30:00,629
Closed a huge deal.

577
00:30:00,663 --> 00:30:03,732
Two blocks downtown,
prime views of the bay.

578
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:04,733
It's going to rent
through the roof,

579
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:07,136
and I get a big piece of it.

580
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,604
Something tells me you like

581
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:12,908
getting a big piece
of everything.

582
00:30:12,942 --> 00:30:15,077
Whenever I can manage.

583
00:30:15,111 --> 00:30:17,780
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

584
00:30:17,814 --> 00:30:19,982
Just wish
I had a present for you.

585
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:27,322
What do you say
we migrate to my suite?

586
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:30,025
Got a nice little private bar.

587
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,963
It's a lot quieter
than this place.

588
00:30:34,998 --> 00:30:39,001
All done here.

589
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:40,235
You're going to love the views.

590
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:42,638
It's beautiful.

591
00:30:42,672 --> 00:30:47,309
Nice, light music.

592
00:30:47,343 --> 00:30:48,310
It'll be real nice.

593
00:30:48,344 --> 00:30:50,212
No, save it for the room.

594
00:30:50,246 --> 00:30:51,580
Oh, what, are you
playing hard to get?

595
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:53,182
I don't like to kiss in public.

596
00:30:53,216 --> 00:30:55,050
- Ah, you're bashful.
- Mm-hmm, maybe.

597
00:30:56,286 --> 00:30:58,887
Get your fucking hands
off of her!

598
00:30:58,922 --> 00:31:02,391
Jesus, Elway.

599
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:03,392
The hell is going on?

600
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:04,860
She's wired, douchebag.

601
00:31:04,894 --> 00:31:06,595
You're done.

602
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:08,330
You fucking son of a bitch.

603
00:31:08,364 --> 00:31:09,565
You know what, you're going
to call Susan tonight.

604
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:10,960
You're going
to tell her it's over.

605
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:11,934
If you don't,
she's getting an email

606
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:14,136
with a video attachment.
You got it?

607
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,038
You got it?

608
00:31:16,072 --> 00:31:18,574
- Yeah, I got it.
- Good.

609
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:21,577
You're an asshole.

610
00:31:23,847 --> 00:31:27,683
The fuck are you thinking?

611
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:30,018
I'm sorry, all right?
I-I-I just--

612
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:32,354
seeing him paw
all over you like that,

613
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:35,324
I don't like that shit.

614
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:36,959
I'm sorry about your top.

615
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,026
That's okay.
It's all right.

616
00:31:38,061 --> 00:31:41,029
I got it.

617
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:04,520
Sofia Fuentes,
current place of employment,

618
00:32:04,554 --> 00:32:06,788
the Cypress Harbor Yacht Club,

619
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:09,525
which is owned
by Zach's family.

620
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,961
That's where Zach must have
first laid eyes on her.

621
00:32:12,996 --> 00:32:14,296
If Zach likes to take pictures

622
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,064
of his victims
before he's killed them,

623
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:19,334
chances are he likes
after photos as well.

624
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:20,836
If he did kill Norma Rivera,

625
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,572
then he's got the photos
to prove it.

626
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:10,319
Sofia.

627
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:12,454
Probably his next victim.

628
00:33:12,488 --> 00:33:14,423
Now I just need to find

629
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:17,659
any photos of Norma Rivera.

630
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,617
Norma Rivera.

631
00:34:15,652 --> 00:34:17,786
Taken seconds
after she was killed,

632
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,821
the pool of blood
around her head growing

633
00:34:19,856 --> 00:34:23,125
from one image to the next.

634
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,831
Zach Hamilton,
murder weapon in hand.

635
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:32,367
All the proof I need.

636
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:42,077
You wanted proof.
There it is.

637
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:45,480
Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

638
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:50,452
Yes.
I know.

639
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:52,954
- You know?
- Mm.

640
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:56,725
Zach told me
during our first session.

641
00:34:56,759 --> 00:34:58,719
But you didn't tell me
because of your unflinching

642
00:34:58,728 --> 00:34:59,795
sense of ethics?

643
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:02,030
Oh, forget ethics.

644
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:03,505
Why would I help
facilitate the death

645
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,400
of someone I see potential in?

646
00:35:05,435 --> 00:35:06,601
Potential?
He's a killer.

647
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:08,603
He deserves to die.

648
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:12,574
Isn't that a little intolerant,
coming from you?

649
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:17,012
I don't kill innocent people.

650
00:35:17,046 --> 00:35:19,781
But you might have,

651
00:35:19,816 --> 00:35:21,650
if it hadn't been
for Harry and me.

652
00:35:21,684 --> 00:35:25,020
You could even be
on death row right now, huh?

653
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:27,823
- Right.
- But you were spared.

654
00:35:27,857 --> 00:35:33,128
Yeah, I was spared
because of the code.

655
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:35,464
That's an interesting idea.

656
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:38,834
What do you mean?

657
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:41,136
What if we were
to teach Zach the code?

658
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,638
- You can't be serious.
- Why not?

659
00:35:43,673 --> 00:35:47,342
It never occurred to me
to try again,

660
00:35:47,376 --> 00:35:50,178
because I didn't have Harry.

661
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:52,647
But now I have you.

662
00:35:52,682 --> 00:35:54,516
Maybe it's time to see

663
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:57,018
if the experiment will work.

664
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:59,221
This isn't a science project.

665
00:35:59,255 --> 00:36:02,858
No, but it's a matter
of life and death.

666
00:36:02,892 --> 00:36:05,360
Zach's life is on the line.

667
00:36:05,394 --> 00:36:07,162
What possibly makes you think

668
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:09,865
Zach could be taught the code?

669
00:36:09,899 --> 00:36:12,534
I told you,
I see something in him.

670
00:36:12,568 --> 00:36:13,735
And it worked with you.

671
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:15,003
Zach and I are nothing alike.

672
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:16,805
No, of course not.

673
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:19,374
You are definitely
one of a kind.

674
00:36:19,408 --> 00:36:20,709
He killed an innocent,

675
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,223
and he's getting ready
to do it again.

676
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,580
He needs to die.

677
00:36:33,156 --> 00:36:34,456
Harrison.

678
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,291
I never intended to have a son,

679
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:37,793
but now he's the one thing
in my life

680
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:40,395
that seems most right.

681
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:43,031
There she is!

682
00:36:43,065 --> 00:36:45,433
Hi!

683
00:36:45,468 --> 00:36:48,003
Yay.
Aww, mwah.

684
00:36:48,037 --> 00:36:50,105
- Happy Birthday.
- Aw, thanks, Dex.

685
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:51,473
Thank you.

686
00:36:51,507 --> 00:36:53,742
Can I go play?

687
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:57,512
Yeah, sure.
Have fun.

688
00:36:57,547 --> 00:36:59,614
Stay close, Harrison.

689
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:06,721
Yeah, I'm, um--

690
00:37:06,756 --> 00:37:09,891
I'm not sure if he's a date
or just a friend.

691
00:37:09,926 --> 00:37:12,394
I mean, what I do know
is that she's very attractive

692
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:13,562
and men like her,

693
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:16,965
so if you want a chance,
you better move fast.

694
00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:21,670
Right.

695
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:25,674
Uh, I think I'm going
to go grab a beer.

696
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:27,475
You know, this may sound weird,

697
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,978
and I don't mean
to sound creepy or anything,

698
00:37:30,012 --> 00:37:32,013
but I think I really like you.

699
00:37:32,048 --> 00:37:35,884
Aww.
I like you, too.

700
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:38,086
I'm not really ready
to call you "Dad,"

701
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,689
but, uh, you're cool.

702
00:37:40,723 --> 00:37:42,090
"Cool"?

703
00:37:42,124 --> 00:37:43,925
Usually, I'm the only one
that calls me that.

704
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,961
So that's awesome.

705
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:48,663
Oh, hey.
I got you something.

706
00:37:48,698 --> 00:37:49,664
What?

707
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,466
It's really not a big deal.

708
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:56,972
It's not a big deal?
You're giving me $5,000?

709
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:57,973
- Hey...
- Why?

710
00:37:58,007 --> 00:37:59,207
I know you could really use it.

711
00:37:59,242 --> 00:38:01,176
But you should know
that that's really all

712
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,510
that I can afford.

713
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:03,511
I don't understand.

714
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:04,579
How do you know
that I could use it?

715
00:38:04,614 --> 00:38:05,614
Well, you know,

716
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:08,416
I just did a little research
on you.

717
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:11,386
You checked into me?
Like a criminal?

718
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,822
No, I just wanted to make sure

719
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,423
you were who you said you were.

720
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:18,727
And that I wasn't after you
for your money?

721
00:38:18,761 --> 00:38:21,363
- I just--
- Look, I have debts,

722
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:22,631
but they're soon to be paid,

723
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:24,766
and that's not really
any of your business.

724
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,935
I wouldn't ask you for this.

725
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:28,370
I'm really sorry.

726
00:38:28,404 --> 00:38:30,038
Do you understand
that it was really hard

727
00:38:30,072 --> 00:38:32,474
for me to do this?
To find my father?

728
00:38:32,508 --> 00:38:33,775
But I felt like it was worth it

729
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,010
to get to know you.

730
00:38:35,044 --> 00:38:36,578
You know, maybe I was wrong.

731
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:38,446
Here you go.
No, thank you.

732
00:38:38,481 --> 00:38:40,615
- Hey, Niki--
- All right, everyone.

733
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,484
I'd like to make a toast.

734
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:46,521
To the best kid sister
a guy could ever have, Jamie.

735
00:38:46,555 --> 00:38:48,390
Aww, thank you.

736
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:49,891
I love you.
Happy Birthday.

737
00:38:49,926 --> 00:38:51,860
I love you, too.

738
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:52,894
Aww, thank you, guys.

739
00:38:52,929 --> 00:38:54,829
Thank you so much for coming.

740
00:38:54,864 --> 00:38:58,099
You guys are the best,
and it really is so nice

741
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:00,769
to have you all
here in one place together.

742
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:03,038
I love you guys.
Cheers.

743
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:06,007
Happy Birthday.

744
00:39:07,643 --> 00:39:11,112
And here's to you,
Sergeant Quinn.

745
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:12,247
I know it's premature,
but I just wanted--

746
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:14,649
- Way premature.
- You didn't tell her?

747
00:39:14,684 --> 00:39:16,985
I didn't want to upset her
on her birthday.

748
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:19,254
No.

749
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:22,624
You didn't get the job?

750
00:39:22,658 --> 00:39:23,725
You didn't give it to him?

751
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:24,960
I had to go with the person

752
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:26,227
I thought would be
best for the job.

753
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:27,495
And how is that not Joey?

754
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:28,496
Hey, it's okay.

755
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:30,131
He gave the promotion
to Miller.

756
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,232
It's--you know.

757
00:39:31,267 --> 00:39:32,801
But going for sergeant

758
00:39:32,835 --> 00:39:34,936
was your idea
in the first place.

759
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:36,304
You set him up.

760
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:37,739
I didn't mean to--

761
00:39:37,773 --> 00:39:40,508
Jesus, Angel.

762
00:39:45,681 --> 00:39:47,615
- Hey.
- Dexter, hi.

763
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,050
How are you?

764
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:50,352
I'm great.
You?

765
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:52,687
Great.
Nice party, huh?

766
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:56,358
Yeah.

767
00:39:56,392 --> 00:39:58,026
The beach.

768
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,394
Yeah.

769
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:01,529
Harrison looks like
he's having a really nice time.

770
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:04,532
Yep.

771
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,968
Uh, Dexter, this is Oliver.
Oliver, Dexter.

772
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:09,471
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

773
00:40:09,505 --> 00:40:10,586
I didn't know if you wanted

774
00:40:10,606 --> 00:40:12,540
the Belgian brown
or the oatmeal stout

775
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:13,808
or the German Pilsner,

776
00:40:13,843 --> 00:40:15,143
so I just got you the one
with the moose on it.

777
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,244
Can't go wrong with a moose.

778
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:21,516
I'm going to go
check on Harrison.

779
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,953
Okay, take care.

780
00:40:24,987 --> 00:40:26,788
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, that's great.

781
00:40:26,822 --> 00:40:29,124
- That's your neighbor, right?
- Yes.

782
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:41,536
What happened with Susan?
Wyman break up with her?

783
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,171
Yeah.
Yeah, he did.

784
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:45,173
So it's a win.

785
00:40:45,207 --> 00:40:47,475
Why do you look like someone
just ran over your dog?

786
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,910
I just got off the phone
with her,

787
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:51,446
and she couldn't stop crying.

788
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,814
She thinks it's all her fault,

789
00:40:52,848 --> 00:40:56,284
like somehow, she's not
good enough or something.

790
00:40:56,318 --> 00:40:59,521
Well, she would've caught
him cheating eventually.

791
00:40:59,555 --> 00:41:02,357
The result
would have been the same.

792
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:06,628
Yeah, but it wouldn't be me
that made her cry.

793
00:41:06,662 --> 00:41:09,764
Jesus, I just feel like shit.

794
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:11,332
People can't help
sticking their noses in

795
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:14,102
when it's someone
they care about.

796
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:15,970
I know.

797
00:41:16,005 --> 00:41:19,007
I know.
You tried to tell me.

798
00:41:21,444 --> 00:41:24,879
So does that mean
you care about me?

799
00:41:24,914 --> 00:41:29,584
Only to the extent
that you sign my paycheck.

800
00:41:30,686 --> 00:41:32,220
Touche.

801
00:41:32,254 --> 00:41:34,589
Okay, what are we
going to read tonight?

802
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:36,024
Let me guess.
"Wee Monkeys."

803
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:37,025
"Wee Monkeys."

804
00:41:45,935 --> 00:41:48,736
Before I read to you,

805
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:52,941
I gotta talk to you
about the TV remote.

806
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:54,056
You said you didn't take it,

807
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:57,312
but Jamie found it
under your bed.

808
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,051
I didn't mean to break it.

809
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:05,120
I was pretending
it was a thunder blaster,

810
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:07,922
and I dropped it
in the kitchen.

811
00:42:07,957 --> 00:42:10,125
Well, yeah, that's okay.
Accidents happen.

812
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:11,759
But you lied to me.
That's a big deal.

813
00:42:11,794 --> 00:42:15,163
We should never lie.

814
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:20,468
But, daddy,

815
00:42:20,503 --> 00:42:24,806
you lie.

816
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,143
What do you mean?

817
00:42:39,121 --> 00:42:41,656
You told me doggy got lost.

818
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,425
I saw you
throw him in the trash.

819
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,995
I had to rescue him.

820
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:54,969
You're right.
I lied.

821
00:42:55,004 --> 00:42:58,573
Doggy got dirty, and I tried
to clean him up,

822
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:01,976
and when I couldn't,
I threw him away.

823
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:04,279
I'm sorry I lied to you,
Harrison.

824
00:43:04,313 --> 00:43:07,382
That's okay.
But can I keep him?

825
00:43:07,416 --> 00:43:08,850
I really love him.

826
00:43:08,884 --> 00:43:11,886
He's soaked in blood
that links me to a murder.

827
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:14,756
Yeah, but maybe he should live
under the bed.

828
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,225
- Okay.
- Okay.

829
00:43:17,259 --> 00:43:18,560
"Wee Monkeys."

830
00:43:18,594 --> 00:43:20,862
"Wee Monkeys"!

831
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:22,297
It's no accident,

832
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:25,099
Harrison catching me in a lie.

833
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:26,467
I can live with my lies,

834
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:30,738
but how long can Harrison
before he finally sees through?

835
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:32,707
I should be back
in a few hours.

836
00:43:32,741 --> 00:43:35,710
Sorry to keep you late
on your birthday.

837
00:43:35,744 --> 00:43:38,479
Trust me, it'll probably be
the highlight of my day.

838
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:40,615
Vogel doesn't want me
to kill Zach,

839
00:43:40,649 --> 00:43:41,849
but she's wrong about him.

840
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:45,687
He deserves nothing
but my table.

841
00:43:45,721 --> 00:43:47,255
He's here.

842
00:43:50,593 --> 00:43:54,329
Hey, Zach, it's Dexter.

843
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:19,520
Where is he?

844
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:30,031
Why would Zach
buy a car for $1,200?

845
00:44:30,065 --> 00:44:32,233
Because the one mistake he made
with Norma Rivera

846
00:44:32,268 --> 00:44:35,470
was showing up to kill her
in a red Porsche.

847
00:44:35,504 --> 00:44:38,906
He's going
to kill Sofia tonight.

848
00:44:55,124 --> 00:44:56,257
Cypress Harbor Yacht Club.

849
00:44:56,292 --> 00:44:57,258
Yes, hi, could you tell me

850
00:44:57,293 --> 00:44:59,794
if Sofia Fuentes
is working tonight?

851
00:44:59,828 --> 00:45:00,995
She gets off here
in a few minutes.

852
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,097
Thank you.

853
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:26,054
Zach, waiting to make his move.

854
00:45:36,532 --> 00:45:40,501
And Quinn, still trying
to prove he's a good cop.

855
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:52,046
- He Dex.
- Hey.

856
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:55,917
Look, this is probably
none of my business,

857
00:45:55,951 --> 00:45:58,486
but I feel like I should
tell you about Quinn.

858
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,221
Okay.

859
00:46:00,255 --> 00:46:02,657
He thinks you're going
to break up with him.

860
00:46:02,691 --> 00:46:04,392
Break up with him?
Why?

861
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:06,060
'Cause he didn't make sergeant.

862
00:46:06,095 --> 00:46:08,629
That's crazy.

863
00:46:08,664 --> 00:46:09,697
Why would he think that?

864
00:46:09,732 --> 00:46:12,767
Maybe you should, um,
invite him over.

865
00:46:12,801 --> 00:46:14,235
I think he's feeling
pretty down.

866
00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:15,937
Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

867
00:46:15,971 --> 00:46:17,872
Thanks, Dex, for calling.

868
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:19,674
That really is so sweet of you.

869
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:23,544
Sure.

870
00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:44,365
Quinn problem solved.

871
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,568
And there's Sofia.

872
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:57,345
Zach's father.

873
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:59,080
Sofia is Hamilton's mistress,

874
00:46:59,114 --> 00:47:02,350
just like Norma before her.

875
00:47:28,844 --> 00:47:29,977
What is he doing?

876
00:48:03,078 --> 00:48:04,412
Hey.

877
00:48:04,446 --> 00:48:05,780
I know what you're doing.

878
00:48:05,814 --> 00:48:07,148
Quinn.

879
00:48:07,182 --> 00:48:12,753
You playing detective?
Watching Zach?

880
00:48:12,788 --> 00:48:14,422
Yeah, you caught me.

881
00:48:14,456 --> 00:48:17,725
I'm going to see Jamie.
Keep an eye on Zach.

882
00:48:25,801 --> 00:48:28,970
Jesus.
What the fuck?

883
00:48:29,004 --> 00:48:33,641
What are you doing?

884
00:48:33,675 --> 00:48:36,210
Why were you going
to kill your father?

885
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:37,245
What are you talking about?

886
00:48:37,279 --> 00:48:38,279
I wasn't trying
to kill my--

887
00:48:38,313 --> 00:48:39,914
I know you killed
Norma Rivera.

888
00:48:39,948 --> 00:48:41,682
I thought you were going
to kill Sofia.

889
00:48:41,717 --> 00:48:43,684
But you were going
after your father.

890
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:45,520
- Why?
- You're crazy.

891
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:48,789
I didn't try
and kill my father.

892
00:48:48,824 --> 00:48:53,561
You tell me one more lie,
and I'll kill you.

893
00:48:53,595 --> 00:48:55,496
- I had to.
- Why?

894
00:48:55,531 --> 00:48:58,733
Because he's killing my mother.

895
00:48:58,767 --> 00:49:02,169
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

896
00:49:02,204 --> 00:49:04,338
Over the years,
one affair after another,

897
00:49:04,373 --> 00:49:07,241
and he doesn't even
try and hide it.

898
00:49:07,276 --> 00:49:10,144
I-I thought killing Norma
would put an end to it,

899
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:11,345
but two days later,

900
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:15,283
he's banging some hostess
from the club.

901
00:49:15,317 --> 00:49:16,918
I knew if I wanted it to stop,

902
00:49:16,952 --> 00:49:19,320
I had to kill dad.

903
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,325
So that's what this
is all about,

904
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,194
you trying to protect
your mother?

905
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:28,663
You actually care about her?

906
00:49:28,697 --> 00:49:32,133
Of course I do.
She's my mother.

907
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:41,542
But showing up
at crime scenes, accidents,

908
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:45,079
taking pictures
of all the blood,

909
00:49:45,113 --> 00:49:47,181
this is about more than
just your mother, isn't it?

910
00:49:47,215 --> 00:49:49,216
No, I had to protect her.

911
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:51,986
Yeah, I believe you.

912
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,255
But you killed
because you want to kill.

913
00:49:54,289 --> 00:49:58,492
- No.
- Yes.

914
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:01,963
To take a living person

915
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:06,000
and make them dead,

916
00:50:06,034 --> 00:50:09,203
imagining that you
can actually hear the moment

917
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:12,573
when their heart stops beating,

918
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:17,178
smell the blood
as it pools across the floor.

919
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:24,185
I can't help it.

920
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:29,624
It just builds up inside me,

921
00:50:29,658 --> 00:50:31,659
all these years.

922
00:50:31,693 --> 00:50:34,729
But Norma was the first time
I ever followed through.

923
00:50:34,763 --> 00:50:37,264
And how was it,

924
00:50:37,299 --> 00:50:40,901
once you'd killed her?

925
00:50:40,936 --> 00:50:44,205
It--it felt like
this huge weight

926
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:47,108
was lifted off my chest,

927
00:50:47,142 --> 00:50:52,246
this release of something
horrible inside me.

928
00:50:55,217 --> 00:50:57,918
Like you were finally
in control.

929
00:50:57,953 --> 00:51:00,621
Yes.

930
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:10,031
You should just go ahead
and kill me.

931
00:51:10,065 --> 00:51:11,499
Why?

932
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:17,271
'Cause if you don't,
I know I'll do it again.

933
00:51:17,305 --> 00:51:18,572
I don't want to be like this,

934
00:51:18,607 --> 00:51:23,377
but I can't help it.

935
00:51:23,412 --> 00:51:25,212
I just am.

936
00:51:25,247 --> 00:51:27,515
I'm some kind of freak.

937
00:51:27,549 --> 00:51:29,984
A monster.

938
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:34,221
Yes.

939
00:51:34,256 --> 00:51:36,390
You haven't told anyone else
about this, have you?

940
00:51:36,425 --> 00:51:38,292
Besides Dr. Vogel.

941
00:51:38,326 --> 00:51:41,495
No, I couldn't.

942
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:45,266
You never had a Harry.

943
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,601
A what?

944
00:51:47,636 --> 00:51:50,871
Someone to talk to.

945
00:51:53,108 --> 00:51:56,410
Someone to teach you.

946
00:51:58,613 --> 00:52:00,981
Some things happen to us
by accident.

947
00:52:01,016 --> 00:52:03,984
Others are choices.

948
00:52:04,019 --> 00:52:06,387
There are parts of me
that I can never share

949
00:52:06,421 --> 00:52:07,922
with my own son.

950
00:52:07,956 --> 00:52:10,391
But with Zach--

951
00:52:10,425 --> 00:52:12,426
could I teach him?

952
00:52:12,461 --> 00:52:14,695
Am I ready for this,

953
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,364
to be a spiritual father?

954
00:52:20,569 --> 00:52:26,440
So how'd your sting go
with Elway?

955
00:52:26,475 --> 00:52:29,009
Terribly.

956
00:52:29,044 --> 00:52:31,412
Didn't work out?

957
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:33,614
No, it worked out fine,
but--

958
00:52:33,648 --> 00:52:36,650
What?

959
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:40,454
He likes me.

960
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:42,690
Oh.

961
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:44,024
That's a bad thing?

962
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:45,459
Well, he likes me
'cause he doesn't know

963
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:48,763
a fucking thing about me.

964
00:52:48,797 --> 00:52:50,364
"Yeah, I killed two people,

965
00:52:50,398 --> 00:52:53,067
"and tried to kill myself
and my brother.

966
00:52:53,101 --> 00:52:55,803
But sorry, what kind of wine
would you like to order?"

967
00:52:55,837 --> 00:52:58,639
I mean, what the fuck?

968
00:52:58,673 --> 00:53:02,276
Yeah, I kind of know
what you mean.

969
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:05,079
How are things with Cassie?

970
00:53:05,113 --> 00:53:10,117
Um, yeah, I don't think
there's much of a future there.

971
00:53:10,152 --> 00:53:13,020
Maybe the Morgans just
aren't meant for relationships.

972
00:53:13,054 --> 00:53:18,192
Yeah, maybe not.

973
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:19,393
But hey, life is good.

974
00:53:19,427 --> 00:53:20,528
You know,
I'm feeling optimistic

975
00:53:20,562 --> 00:53:22,029
for the first time in a while.

976
00:53:22,063 --> 00:53:23,430
I'm even thinking
about taking on

977
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:28,402
a kind of...intern.

978
00:53:28,436 --> 00:53:31,138
Hmm.

979
00:53:31,173 --> 00:53:32,540
Well, that's a big step
for you, right?

980
00:53:32,574 --> 00:53:37,578
Letting some novice
into your private lab.

981
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:41,816
Yeah.

982
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:43,751
Hey, are you okay?

983
00:53:43,785 --> 00:53:46,086
I don't feel so good.

984
00:53:46,121 --> 00:53:48,823
What's wrong?

985
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:51,225
I feel kind of dizzy.

986
00:53:51,259 --> 00:53:54,195
Deb?

987
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:04,004
Hello, Dexter.

988
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:06,907
Remember me?

989
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:18,883
