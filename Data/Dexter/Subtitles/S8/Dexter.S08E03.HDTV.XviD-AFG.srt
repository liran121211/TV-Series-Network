2
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:47,981
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:50,751
- Dex...
- Shoot him.

4
00:01:50,785 --> 00:01:53,220
Do what you gotta do.

5
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:55,822
Oh, my God!

6
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:57,891
Whoever Deb was
before killing LaGuerta,

7
00:01:57,925 --> 00:01:58,892
that person is dead.

8
00:01:58,926 --> 00:01:59,893
Oh, my God!

9
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,595
What we think is the shooter

10
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:03,664
approached the vehicle
from behind.

11
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:05,165
El Sapo drew his gun.

12
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,436
I know you killed El Sapo.

13
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,672
What if I weren't here
to cover your ass?

14
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:13,573
You really want
to play the 'what if' game?

15
00:02:13,608 --> 00:02:15,342
What's going on with Debra?

16
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:16,743
It's between me and her.

17
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:17,878
It's affecting you.

18
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:20,414
We're not going
to talk about Deb.

19
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:21,548
Here I thought
we were gonna make it

20
00:02:21,582 --> 00:02:22,816
to one minute

21
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,284
before you mentioned
your old fiancee.

22
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,253
I-I got your brother
on my ass

23
00:02:26,287 --> 00:02:27,854
about taking
the sergeant's test.

24
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:29,723
You're on my ass about Deb.

25
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:34,094
Interior insular cortex
is missing,

26
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:35,095
just like the last one.

27
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:36,563
So we have a serial.

28
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:38,265
Vogel was right.

29
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:39,800
Lyle Sussman.

30
00:02:39,834 --> 00:02:41,468
I don't know anybody
by that name.

31
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:45,739
It doesn't mean
he doesn't know you.

32
00:02:45,773 --> 00:02:47,374
He was coerced.

33
00:02:47,408 --> 00:02:49,109
Sussman was never
a real killer.

34
00:02:49,143 --> 00:02:50,977
He's just another victim.

35
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:52,612
You were wrong about me.

36
00:02:52,647 --> 00:02:55,115
I destroyed Deb.

37
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:56,783
I'm a mistake.

38
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,286
You're exactly
what you need to be.

39
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,726
Daddy?

40
00:03:17,672 --> 00:03:22,242
Harrison?

41
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:25,345
Daddy?

42
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,781
Harrison?

43
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:37,958
Daddy?

44
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:39,993
Harrison?

45
00:03:43,998 --> 00:03:46,666
My tummy hurts.

46
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,543
Harrison, did you eat
a whole box of popsicles?

47
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:02,381
Harrison?

48
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:05,352
Why?

49
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,687
Because I love them.

50
00:04:10,591 --> 00:04:11,558
All right.

51
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:14,728
Come on.

52
00:04:24,038 --> 00:04:27,374
Drink this.
It'll make you feel better.

53
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:29,276
I promise.

54
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:39,419
Good boy.

55
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:51,765
A tiny shot of pink
is all it takes

56
00:04:51,799 --> 00:04:53,934
to fix my son's pain.

57
00:04:53,968 --> 00:04:55,128
I just wish it were that easy

58
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:58,338
to help Deb.

59
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,260
Um...

60
00:05:23,664 --> 00:05:24,798
What?

61
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:25,799
Lieutenant Morgan?

62
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:27,734
Formerly known as.

63
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:31,371
Have you been drinking?

64
00:05:31,405 --> 00:05:33,740
- There a problem, officer?
- Well, yes.

65
00:05:33,774 --> 00:05:35,775
You're in a car, drunk,
with an open container.

66
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,713
Several, actually.

67
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:43,250
Well, at least I pulled over.

68
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:45,585
I've had a really bad
couple of days.

69
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,588
Maybe you could just
cut me some slack?

70
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,624
- I wish I could, but--
- But what?

71
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:52,559
There's been damage
to city property.

72
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:55,128
Property damage?
Are you fucking kidding me?

73
00:05:55,162 --> 00:05:57,464
I'm gonna need you
to get out of the car, please.

74
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:18,985
Oh, mother shit.

75
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,120
Is there someone
I can call for you?

76
00:06:20,154 --> 00:06:21,187
Your brother, maybe?

77
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:24,190
No, fucking don't call Dexter.

78
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:39,205
Quinn.

79
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,975
Yeah.
I'll be right there.

80
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,143
Is everything okay?

81
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:45,879
Um, yeah.
Just cop stuff.

82
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,113
- Okay.
- I'll call you later.

83
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:50,517
Okay.

84
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,035
Deb.

85
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,738
I'm up.

86
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:14,474
You okay?

87
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:17,978
I feel like
I got hit by a truck.

88
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:19,212
Jesus, Deb.

89
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:21,715
Oh, God, please,
just save me the lecture, okay?

90
00:07:21,749 --> 00:07:25,919
My head hurts
like a motherfucker.

91
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:28,154
I'm not gonna lecture you.

92
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,590
They book you yet?

93
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,059
No, not yet.

94
00:07:33,094 --> 00:07:38,431
They kept me out
of the drunk tank, though.

95
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:42,202
Thank God
for professional courtesy.

96
00:07:42,236 --> 00:07:43,637
All right.

97
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:48,174
Let me see
if I can get you out of this.

98
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:51,244
Hey.
How you doing?

99
00:07:51,278 --> 00:07:52,545
Can I get a little help?

100
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,514
What can I do for you?

101
00:08:09,163 --> 00:08:11,831
Deb's had me
on such a roller coaster,

102
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,935
I actually appreciate
walking into familiar territory.

103
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,607
Lyle Sussman's cabin.

104
00:08:20,641 --> 00:08:22,609
But where's the body?

105
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:30,750
Dex?

106
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:36,156
This is our guy, Sussman.

107
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,992
The brain surgeon.

108
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:43,129
Not exactly.

109
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:46,766
Did the real brain surgeon
restage the crime scene,

110
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:48,868
obscuring any evidence
that Sussman's body

111
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,471
was ever hanging from a hook
in the back of his skull?

112
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:54,174
Give me a hand?

113
00:09:03,718 --> 00:09:06,052
His front teeth are broken.

114
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,289
Looks like Sussman
put this shotgun in his mouth,

115
00:09:09,323 --> 00:09:12,092
and blam,

116
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,260
blew his head off.

117
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:15,995
Or someone put the gun
in his mouth,

118
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,531
and pulled the trigger
post-mortem.

119
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,542
G.S.R. on Sussman's hands.

120
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:32,145
Maybe this asshole
finally found his conscience,

121
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:34,781
couldn't live with what he did.

122
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,516
No note, though.

123
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,917
Ah, suicide.

124
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,619
Makes our lives so much easier.

125
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:43,757
You should put that
on a t-shirt.

126
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:48,428
Whoever's after Vogel
wants the cops off the case.

127
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,829
Is Vogel here yet?

128
00:09:49,864 --> 00:09:50,830
I just called her.

129
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:53,633
Where the fuck is Quinn?

130
00:09:57,238 --> 00:10:00,218
You, uh, can thank me later.

131
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:04,811
You still keep
a stash of gum in here?

132
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,046
I can smell my own breath.

133
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,882
Hey, you sure you want
to go straight to work

134
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,817
after spending the night
in the station?

135
00:10:10,851 --> 00:10:12,011
I mean, I could take you home.

136
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,486
You could shower.

137
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:15,822
I keep deodorant in my desk.

138
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:28,034
Thanks for the ride.

139
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:31,671
Deb, wait.

140
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:34,741
What?

141
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:35,842
Should I be worried?

142
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:39,212
About what?

143
00:10:39,246 --> 00:10:41,815
About you.

144
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:46,219
Think you might have a problem?

145
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:49,389
You mean
like a drinking problem?

146
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:52,091
I'm just saying.

147
00:10:52,126 --> 00:10:53,092
Are you serious?

148
00:10:53,127 --> 00:10:54,488
You, of all people,
are accusing me

149
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:55,562
of having a drinking problem?

150
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:56,896
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

151
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:58,431
How many times have you
shown up at a crime scene

152
00:10:58,465 --> 00:11:00,567
in last night's clothes
smelling like booze?

153
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,001
A lot, okay?

154
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,570
Which means I've been
down this road,

155
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:04,637
so I get it.

156
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:06,806
I'm not down any fucking road.

157
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:08,107
But at least
when I was spinning out,

158
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:10,276
I had a reason.

159
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:11,578
What do you mean,
you had a reason?

160
00:11:11,612 --> 00:11:14,380
You dumbass.

161
00:11:14,415 --> 00:11:15,582
You turned down my proposal.

162
00:11:15,616 --> 00:11:16,816
That was my reason.

163
00:11:16,851 --> 00:11:19,853
So what's yours?

164
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,727
Maybe I just
don't know my own limits,

165
00:11:27,761 --> 00:11:29,729
or something.

166
00:11:34,535 --> 00:11:35,568
I didn't--

167
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:37,837
That's my boss.
I gotta go.

168
00:11:37,872 --> 00:11:39,873
Deb--

169
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:49,649
You might want
to straighten up.

170
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:53,253
We have a new client
coming in at 9:00.

171
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,393
I'm frightened, Dexter.

172
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:08,494
He's escalating,

173
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:09,996
and we're left
to play catch up.

174
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,430
I'll run some tests
back at the lab,

175
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:14,267
but I'm guessing this tissue
belongs to Sussman.

176
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:17,437
Explains why the killer blew
his head off with a shotgun,

177
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:19,172
so nobody'd notice
the pieces were missing.

178
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:20,974
What part of the brain is it?

179
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,076
It's the occipital lobe.

180
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,112
It's responsible for vision.

181
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:28,147
He's sending us a message.

182
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,682
He's watching us.

183
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:31,484
That, and the "His" and "Hers"
boxes--

184
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,653
he's aware of me now,
not just you.

185
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:38,224
I'm sorry, Dexter,
to have dragged you into this.

186
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:41,327
He sent both packages to you.

187
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,829
Maybe he doesn't know
how to find me.

188
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,163
He probably doesn't even
know my name.

189
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,099
- Yet.
- Yeah, I know.

190
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:49,002
I need to get to him
before he gets to me.

191
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,357
I've been going
through your book,

192
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,738
and cross-referencing it

193
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:55,274
with the source files
and list of suspects.

194
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:56,776
Any progress?

195
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,578
I've managed to clear
the first two names.

196
00:13:58,612 --> 00:14:00,046
So who's next?

197
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,315
- Ron Galuzzo.
- Mm.

198
00:14:02,349 --> 00:14:03,516
According to your files,

199
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,452
he strangled his best friend
in high school,

200
00:14:06,487 --> 00:14:08,221
but convinced you
that it was a bully?

201
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:09,989
Yeah.

202
00:14:10,024 --> 00:14:13,226
It's rare that someone
can fool me like that.

203
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,294
At his hearing,
I argued for leniency,

204
00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:18,731
but when I eventually got him
to admit that he'd been lying,

205
00:14:18,766 --> 00:14:20,867
I reversed my recommendation.

206
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,168
So if Galuzzo read your book

207
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:23,736
and recognized
his story--

208
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:26,072
He would have realized
that he'd been institutionalized

209
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:28,374
until he was 21 because of me.

210
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,345
That's a pretty good reason
to hold a grudge.

211
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,081
- Dex.
- Excuse me.

212
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,088
It's about your sister.

213
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:43,222
What about her?

214
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,392
She got brought in
for a D.U.I. last night.

215
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,961
Shit.

216
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:50,129
I managed to get her out of it,

217
00:14:50,164 --> 00:14:53,299
but still, it was pretty bad.

218
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,634
She asked me
not to say anything,

219
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:56,436
so I feel like kind of
a shit friend for telling you,

220
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,004
but I'm worried about her.

221
00:14:58,038 --> 00:15:00,673
What the fuck's going on?

222
00:15:00,707 --> 00:15:02,442
She's been having a hard time.

223
00:15:02,476 --> 00:15:03,543
Yeah, I know.

224
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:06,779
But, man, this is, like,
a whole new level.

225
00:15:06,814 --> 00:15:08,915
What are we gonna do?

226
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,383
I'll figure something out.

227
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:11,751
Thanks for the heads up.

228
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,053
I'm putting you up
for sergeant,

229
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:15,688
and you show up late?

230
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:18,291
Are you trying to make me
look like an asshole?

231
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:20,660
Sorry.
I had a situation.

232
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:24,297
You want a situation?
Come to the cabin.

233
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,538
What is it?

234
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:33,940
It's Deb.

235
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,641
She was brought in
for a D.U.I.

236
00:15:35,676 --> 00:15:37,176
I need to check on her.

237
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:39,779
Is alcohol an issue for her?

238
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,947
I'm an issue for her.

239
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,748
She's acting this way
because of me.

240
00:15:42,783 --> 00:15:45,585
But you can't keep taking on
your sister's problems,

241
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:46,586
especially right now.

242
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,423
It's my fault, okay?

243
00:15:50,457 --> 00:15:53,159
Deb found out what I am.

244
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:54,594
She knows everything.

245
00:15:54,628 --> 00:15:57,263
Everything?

246
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:58,598
How?

247
00:15:58,632 --> 00:15:59,932
It's a long story.

248
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:04,470
Just suffice to say,
she's not handling it well.

249
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,040
You do really feel badly,
don't you?

250
00:16:08,075 --> 00:16:09,775
Are you analyzing me now?

251
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,410
Well, it's just so unusual.

252
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:15,414
It's really not a good time.

253
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:25,224
Most of the time when
people think their partner's

254
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:26,492
having an affair,

255
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:31,397
their partner's
having an affair.

256
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:33,499
But not always, right?

257
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,035
No, certainly not always.

258
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:37,703
This is for you.

259
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:39,272
My assistant will explain

260
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:40,506
the retainer
and the payment schedule,

261
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,541
and we will get back to you

262
00:16:41,575 --> 00:16:45,178
as soon as we've
found something.

263
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:52,952
So nervous.

264
00:16:52,986 --> 00:16:55,588
Is that normal, to be nervous?

265
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:58,090
Well, people go through
a wide range of emotions.

266
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,760
I think the important thing is
finding out the truth.

267
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,602
Don't look at me.
I think the truth is overrated.

268
00:17:09,636 --> 00:17:10,670
Call us
if you have any questions,

269
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:12,838
and we'll be in touch.

270
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:13,839
Yeah.

271
00:17:13,874 --> 00:17:18,177
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

272
00:17:18,212 --> 00:17:20,513
Well, it looks like
we have to work

273
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:22,081
on our client relation skills.

274
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,217
Are we done?
I need a fucking nap.

275
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,518
No, we're not done.

276
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,386
I've got something for you.

277
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:39,599
What is that?
A fucking shit shake?

278
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:42,301
Special custom-made
supplement formula.

279
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:44,470
It's got vitamins,
some electrolytes,

280
00:17:44,504 --> 00:17:45,571
a couple Chinese herbs.

281
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,906
Gonna knock the hangover
right out of you.

282
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,041
How do you know I'm hung over?

283
00:17:53,013 --> 00:17:55,214
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

284
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:01,387
It's your brother.

285
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,060
Awesome.
Fucking awesome.

286
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:20,673
What do you want?

287
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:24,277
I heard about
what happened last night.

288
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,078
Fucking Quinn.

289
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:27,713
He's worried about you.

290
00:18:27,748 --> 00:18:30,716
We both are.

291
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,218
You almost got a D.U.I.?

292
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:34,253
I think the operative word
is "almost."

293
00:18:34,288 --> 00:18:36,756
It's not a big deal.

294
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,990
It's a very big deal.

295
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:39,458
This is why I didn't
want to tell you,

296
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,733
because I knew you'd freak out.

297
00:18:40,761 --> 00:18:42,995
I'm not freaking out.
I'm just trying to help.

298
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,263
Fuck, Dexter.

299
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:47,099
I don't have time
for this, you know?

300
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:48,267
I have to find out

301
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,036
if some rich asshole
is banging some chick,

302
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,170
which he probably is,

303
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:52,638
so that I can tell her,

304
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,607
and she can
get a killer divorce settlement,

305
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:55,741
and they can move on

306
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,977
with their stupid,
fucking boring lives,

307
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,913
and I can move on with mine.

308
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,682
Because this is my life now.

309
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:06,519
Well, it wasn't always.

310
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:09,288
How about dinner tonight?

311
00:19:09,323 --> 00:19:10,289
We can talk.

312
00:19:10,324 --> 00:19:12,325
I don't want to talk to you.

313
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,895
Well, I'm gonna keep
showing up here until you do.

314
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:17,763
If I agree to dinner,
will you leave?

315
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:20,666
Yes.

316
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,935
Fine.

317
00:19:22,969 --> 00:19:25,638
Great.
I'll pick you up at 8:00.

318
00:19:38,452 --> 00:19:40,886
M.E.'s report is back
from the cabin.

319
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:43,456
They've officially ruled
Lyle Sussman's death

320
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,990
as a suicide.

321
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,192
So with that,

322
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:50,262
the brain surgeon case
is officially closed.

323
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:51,831
Okay.

324
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:53,799
I'll call Evelyn,
thank her for her help.

325
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:55,167
Evelyn?

326
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:57,162
Someone's got a high hard one
for the good doctor.

327
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,438
What did I say
about standing so close?

328
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:02,141
Any progress
on that El Sapo shooting?

329
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,609
Still no leads.

330
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:05,478
I've been going back and forth
with Fort Lauderdale P.D.

331
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:08,581
Apparently, El Sapo
was a suspect in the stabbing

332
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:11,984
of a smash and grab lowlife
by the name of Andrew Briggs.

333
00:20:12,018 --> 00:20:15,721
The cops will never find out
that Deb killed El Sapo.

334
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:19,091
So right now,
I can focus on protecting Vogel,

335
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,327
and myself.

336
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:31,170
Ron Galuzzo.

337
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:33,172
He could be hunting me
right now.

338
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:41,447
Or he could be selling
fitness equipment at the mall.

339
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:44,283
Good work today, everyone.

340
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:49,989
Deputy Chief, you got a sec?

341
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:00,900
I just wanted to let you know

342
00:21:00,934 --> 00:21:02,701
that I've been thinking
about what you said,

343
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:04,303
finding a new sergeant.

344
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,005
And I've got my eye
on Joey Quinn.

345
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:08,240
Quinn?
No way.

346
00:21:08,275 --> 00:21:09,842
He's not sergeant material.

347
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:10,976
He's a good cop.

348
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:12,912
He's irresponsible,
unpredictable,

349
00:21:12,946 --> 00:21:16,182
not to mention unintelligible.

350
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:18,384
There's no way he can pass
that sergeant exam.

351
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:19,518
He'll pass.

352
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:21,353
If you say so.

353
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:42,208
- Are you getting all this?
- Yeah.

354
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:45,377
This guy's making this
way too easy for us.

355
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:48,814
Yeah, it's really
fucking classy.

356
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,684
So tell me,

357
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,419
who's the guy that
dropped you off this morning?

358
00:21:53,453 --> 00:21:57,389
Who?
Quinn?

359
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:58,491
He's a friend.

360
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,525
The kind of friend
that drops you off

361
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:01,060
in last night's clothes, huh?

362
00:22:01,094 --> 00:22:03,028
God, we're not
sleeping together,

363
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:04,263
if that's what you're implying.

364
00:22:04,297 --> 00:22:06,232
Not that it's any
of your fucking business.

365
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:07,333
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

366
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,434
No judgment, no judgment,
no judgment.

367
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:11,637
You are certainly allowed
to be a player,

368
00:22:11,671 --> 00:22:12,838
if you so choose.

369
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:15,207
What makes you think
I'm a player?

370
00:22:15,242 --> 00:22:17,109
First, there's Briggs,

371
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:20,212
then there's, uh,
your new friend.

372
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,381
Well, he's not a new friend.

373
00:22:22,415 --> 00:22:25,451
We used to date,
just not anymore.

374
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:27,987
Really?

375
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:31,290
So what happened?

376
00:22:31,324 --> 00:22:34,059
He proposed.
I said no.

377
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:35,761
Jesus Christ.

378
00:22:35,795 --> 00:22:39,064
He's certainly a better man
than I am.

379
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,299
Woman turns down my proposal,

380
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,300
I'm pretty fucking sure
I'm not gonna

381
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:43,202
stay friends with her.

382
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,104
Yeah, but that's just
because you're a giant pussy.

383
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,478
Yes.
Could be.

384
00:23:04,457 --> 00:23:05,991
Ron Galuzzo.

385
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:07,126
If he is a killer,

386
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,094
then a mall
is the perfect watering hole

387
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:11,030
for him to choose his prey.

388
00:23:11,064 --> 00:23:13,365
So, um, any of our products
is gonna make you

389
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,634
stay in the shape that you are.

390
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:16,769
Uh-huh.

391
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:20,339
And, uh, I need
to do some more work,

392
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:22,508
so I'll see you
a little bit later, okay?

393
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:24,310
It was dark at Sussman's cabin.

394
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:26,779
Does he recognize me?

395
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:29,648
You've got a keen eye,
my friend.

396
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:32,952
The Chiseler 300.

397
00:23:32,986 --> 00:23:34,086
Top of the line.

398
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,520
Or is he just trying
to make a sale?

399
00:23:35,522 --> 00:23:37,389
Just looking
for an all-over workout,

400
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:39,158
maximize my time.

401
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:40,526
Mind if I take
a body measurement?

402
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:43,028
Uh, sure.

403
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,368
Looks like you're already
in pretty good shape.

404
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,475
Oh, you have a very low
fat to muscle ratio.

405
00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:01,513
Well, thanks.
I do what I can, you know.

406
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:05,217
Yeah, this equipment is more
for beginners,

407
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:07,620
people who don't already
have an established routine.

408
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,021
Mm.

409
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:10,155
Does he know who I am?

410
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,590
Is he trying to get rid of me?

411
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,525
I'm just looking
to change up my workout.

412
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,829
I'd love any suggestions.

413
00:24:18,865 --> 00:24:21,033
That baby--

414
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:24,536
cut you up faster
than a chef at Benihana.

415
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:25,771
Come on, give it a try.

416
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:26,939
Okay.

417
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:30,776
He doesn't seem
to recognize me.

418
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:31,844
Whoa.

419
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:32,845
Careful, there.

420
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:34,246
Maybe a grudge against Vogel

421
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,415
will be harder to hide.

422
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:37,516
I like to read when I work out.

423
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,918
Keeps me
from getting motion sickness.

424
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:40,953
This one, I can't put down.

425
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:42,421
You heard of it?

426
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:44,189
I'm not much of a reader.

427
00:24:44,224 --> 00:24:45,449
You've probably heard
of the author, though.

428
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:46,835
She's pretty famous.

429
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:50,996
They call her
"The Psychopath Whisperer."

430
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,798
Dr. Evelyn Vogel?

431
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:54,299
No, I've never heard of her.

432
00:24:54,334 --> 00:24:55,334
Of course he's heard of Vogel.

433
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,335
She treated him.

434
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,637
He's lying.

435
00:24:58,672 --> 00:24:59,738
You know, a fit guy like you,

436
00:24:59,773 --> 00:25:02,474
you need to get
up to at least level five

437
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,343
to feel the full effect.

438
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,413
But why lie,
unless he has something to hide?

439
00:25:07,447 --> 00:25:08,614
Yeah, I feel it.

440
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:13,218
- Yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

441
00:25:13,253 --> 00:25:15,454
Don't forget to breathe.

442
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:20,292
You went to see Galuzzo?

443
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:21,527
You could have exposed us both.

444
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,561
It was worth the risk.

445
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:25,898
He's definitely
hiding something.

446
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:27,700
So now what?

447
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,202
I break into his house
tomorrow, when he's at work,

448
00:25:30,236 --> 00:25:32,905
try to find hard evidence
that he's our man.

449
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:34,707
And in the meantime,
what if he comes for me?

450
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:37,776
Do you have any way
to protect yourself?

451
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:40,312
A gun.
I haven't used it for years.

452
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:41,447
Keep it loaded,

453
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:43,615
and call me if you need me.

454
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,584
I'm meeting Deb for dinner.

455
00:25:45,618 --> 00:25:46,819
I'll check in with you later.

456
00:25:46,853 --> 00:25:48,687
Uh, wait.
Just--

457
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:50,823
there's one thing
I was wondering about

458
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:52,224
since we last spoke.

459
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:53,826
Yes?

460
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,962
When Harry and I
came up with the code,

461
00:25:56,996 --> 00:26:00,199
he insisted
that you only kill bad people.

462
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:04,470
And I insisted that
the first rule of the code be

463
00:26:04,504 --> 00:26:06,739
don't get caught,

464
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,174
giving you a little
wiggle room.

465
00:26:12,645 --> 00:26:14,279
Okay.

466
00:26:14,314 --> 00:26:18,951
So my question is this.

467
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:21,053
When your sister found out

468
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:25,824
about who you were
and what you were doing,

469
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,726
why didn't you kill her?

470
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:28,994
What?

471
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:31,497
Not that I'd ever advocate
such a thing,

472
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:34,433
but since Debra knew
the truth about you,

473
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:35,701
she's clearly a risk--

474
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:37,903
I would never kill Debra.
She's my sister.

475
00:26:37,937 --> 00:26:40,038
I love her.

476
00:26:40,073 --> 00:26:43,375
What, exactly, do you love
about her?

477
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:47,880
Wha--what do you mean?

478
00:26:47,914 --> 00:26:51,450
When a psychopath speaks
about love,

479
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,751
it doesn't really
mean the same thing

480
00:26:52,786 --> 00:26:54,653
as for typical people.

481
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:56,655
So what do you love about her?

482
00:27:00,527 --> 00:27:05,130
I-I don't know.

483
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:10,202
I love having steaks
and beer with her,

484
00:27:10,236 --> 00:27:11,703
and until recently,
the fact that

485
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:15,374
she is always there for me,

486
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:18,243
the way she looked up to me.

487
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:21,780
But none of that
is really about Debra.

488
00:27:21,815 --> 00:27:25,484
It's about what she does
for you.

489
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,152
So you're saying I'm selfish?

490
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,755
I'm not criticizing.

491
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:32,457
Selfless love is hard enough
for typical people.

492
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:36,962
And for psychopaths,
it's impossible.

493
00:27:36,996 --> 00:27:38,697
So why are you telling me this?

494
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:39,965
So I'll feel bad about myself?

495
00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:42,835
Quite the contrary.

496
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,304
I want you to revel
in what you are.

497
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:47,906
I told you, you're perfect.

498
00:27:47,941 --> 00:27:49,107
How can you still say that

499
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:50,342
when you know
what I've done to Deb?

500
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:52,244
That's my point.

501
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:54,146
You're perfect as a psychopath.

502
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,181
All this talk
about helping Debra,

503
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,783
and loving her--

504
00:27:57,817 --> 00:28:00,586
it's like you're Michelangelo

505
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,254
trying to play the banjo.

506
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:03,822
I'm trying
to be a good brother.

507
00:28:03,857 --> 00:28:06,658
Why don't you
let me help Debra?

508
00:28:06,693 --> 00:28:09,661
Because she wouldn't even
listen to you.

509
00:28:09,696 --> 00:28:12,331
I'm the only one
who understands her.

510
00:28:12,365 --> 00:28:14,700
Dexter, you admitted

511
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,470
to being the cause of her pain.

512
00:28:18,504 --> 00:28:21,773
How can you expect
to be the solution?

513
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:24,810
I can handle Deb.

514
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:29,381
I've been doing it
my entire life.

515
00:28:29,415 --> 00:28:31,283
All right, next question.

516
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:33,018
Physically evasive movements
to defeat

517
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:35,621
an officer's attempt
to control is

518
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:40,025
"A," active aggression,
"B," physical resistance,

519
00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:45,564
"C," active resistance,
"D," active evasion?

520
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,833
"B," active aggression.

521
00:28:47,867 --> 00:28:52,204
Okay, active aggression
is actually "A".

522
00:28:52,238 --> 00:28:53,572
And, "B", it's wrong.

523
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,875
The answer is
"C," active resistance.

524
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,610
Wait, I'm confused.

525
00:28:58,645 --> 00:28:59,745
Of course you are.

526
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,946
Matthews was right.

527
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,061
You're a fucking lost cause.

528
00:29:02,081 --> 00:29:04,583
Jesus, Angel.
Easy.

529
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,052
Yeah, Angel.
Easy.

530
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:09,421
I stuck my neck out
on the line for you

531
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:11,523
with Matthews.

532
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:12,758
You better not fuck this up.

533
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,927
Will you please
cut him some slack?

534
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,461
He's still tired

535
00:29:16,496 --> 00:29:17,863
from being called out
in the middle of the night

536
00:29:17,897 --> 00:29:18,864
on that case.

537
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:21,099
What case?
There's no case.

538
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:31,310
I'm, uh--

539
00:29:31,344 --> 00:29:33,545
I'm gonna let you guys talk.

540
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:46,425
So where did you really go
at 4:00 A.M.?

541
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:49,695
Deb was in trouble
and needed my help.

542
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:53,465
She's been going through
kind of a hard time.

543
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:54,533
And why did she call you?

544
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,768
Why not her brother?

545
00:29:56,803 --> 00:29:59,251
I don't think they're
getting along, you know,

546
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:01,055
and she's a friend.

547
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:02,081
I couldn't say no.

548
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:03,241
She's more than a friend.

549
00:30:03,276 --> 00:30:06,778
I mean, come on,
you used to fuck her.

550
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:10,148
And now she's calling you
for everything.

551
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,951
What am I supposed to think?

552
00:30:12,986 --> 00:30:16,154
Jamie, I swear to you,

553
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,890
there is nothing going on
between me and Deb.

554
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,325
Then why lie about it?

555
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,461
Because I didn't think
you'd understand.

556
00:30:22,495 --> 00:30:24,930
Well, you're right.

557
00:30:24,964 --> 00:30:25,931
I don't.

558
00:30:25,965 --> 00:30:29,301
Enjoy your dinner.

559
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,656
The fuck are we doing
in this hellhole?

560
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:52,791
Can I get you something
to drink?

561
00:30:52,825 --> 00:30:54,659
We have a wide array
of signature cocktails.

562
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:55,727
Yeah, I'll take
a Bourbon, neat.

563
00:30:55,762 --> 00:30:57,095
Thank you.

564
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,965
Uh, two cokes, please.

565
00:31:02,301 --> 00:31:04,936
I knew this was a mistake.

566
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:07,639
I wanted to show you something.

567
00:31:07,673 --> 00:31:10,442
You see that man over there?

568
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:13,445
The father?

569
00:31:13,479 --> 00:31:15,180
Yeah.

570
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:20,585
Does he look familiar?

571
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,988
Fuck if I know.

572
00:31:29,562 --> 00:31:35,400
Fuck.
He's wearing Kevlar.

573
00:31:39,372 --> 00:31:40,872
Don't fucking move!

574
00:31:40,907 --> 00:31:42,874
So what, Dex?
That was a long time ago.

575
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:47,579
Yeah, but look.

576
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:51,483
See this guy,
the guy you saved?

577
00:31:51,517 --> 00:31:54,186
That's him.
Right there.

578
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:03,161
His little girl
wouldn't have a father

579
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:04,996
if it weren't for you.

580
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:06,498
That's why I brought you
to this hellhole,

581
00:32:06,532 --> 00:32:10,035
to show you that.

582
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:15,474
I know you think
you're a bad person, Deb,

583
00:32:15,508 --> 00:32:16,508
after everything
that's happened,

584
00:32:16,542 --> 00:32:17,509
but you're not.

585
00:32:17,543 --> 00:32:23,248
You're a good person.

586
00:32:23,282 --> 00:32:25,684
You brought a lot of good
to the world.

587
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,168
I'm fucking starving.

588
00:33:29,282 --> 00:33:32,651
Have a nice day at the mall.

589
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,689
I realize that this is not
the outcome you were hoping for,

590
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:40,692
but it can help with
a favorable divorce settlement.

591
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,179
If you want,
we can forward those

592
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,902
to your attorney.

593
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,776
I don't know.

594
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,978
You don't have to decide now.

595
00:34:00,012 --> 00:34:01,580
I realize
it's a lot to take in.

596
00:34:01,614 --> 00:34:07,352
I mean, I don't know
if that's him.

597
00:34:07,386 --> 00:34:08,620
I'm sorry?

598
00:34:08,654 --> 00:34:11,957
This man in the pictures,

599
00:34:11,991 --> 00:34:15,794
I'm not sure that's my husband.

600
00:34:15,828 --> 00:34:16,828
That's him, all right.

601
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:17,862
Look, you can see his face.

602
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:20,265
Not clearly.

603
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:21,900
I mean, the lighting
isn't very good.

604
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,069
Mrs. Gerard, I assure you.

605
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,070
We're always very careful--

606
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,404
This was a mistake.

607
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,472
Mrs. Gerard--

608
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:29,474
I'm sorry
that I wasted your time.

609
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:32,911
I'll leave a check
at the front desk.

610
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:40,585
Is she fucking kidding?
That's obviously her husband.

611
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,524
She just didn't want to see it.

612
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,661
People get used
to living in denial.

613
00:34:49,695 --> 00:34:51,696
It's just easier, you know?

614
00:35:03,676 --> 00:35:07,612
Galuzzo has to be
the guy we're looking for.

615
00:35:20,693 --> 00:35:24,596
Why would Galuzzo be such a slob
everywhere else but here?

616
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,124
That's why the kitchen
is so clean.

617
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:54,626
It's a kill room.

618
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,960
Galuzzo wasn't checking
my body fat

619
00:35:55,995 --> 00:35:57,028
for my own fitness.

620
00:35:57,063 --> 00:35:58,530
He was checking to see
if I was fit

621
00:35:58,564 --> 00:36:01,099
to have as a main course.

622
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:02,634
He's definitely a butcher.

623
00:36:02,668 --> 00:36:05,837
But does that
make him the brain surgeon?

624
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:15,980
Our killer leaves bodies out,

625
00:36:16,015 --> 00:36:19,484
but Galuzzo keeps his bodies
to season and savor.

626
00:36:19,518 --> 00:36:21,319
This brain
is completely intact,

627
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:26,224
marinating in some sort
of garlic sauce.

628
00:36:26,258 --> 00:36:29,194
Galuzzo wouldn't waste brains
by sending them to Vogel.

629
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,362
They're a delicacy.

630
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:34,032
He eats them.

631
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:37,335
Which means whoever's after us
is still out there,

632
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,537
and he still has
the upper hand.

633
00:36:46,445 --> 00:36:50,415
Fuck.
He's wearing Kevlar.

634
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:12,504
Fuck.
He's wearing Kevlar.

635
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:06,357
Deb, what are you doing here?

636
00:38:09,795 --> 00:38:12,664
I want to make
an official statement.

637
00:38:12,698 --> 00:38:16,768
How much have you had to drink?

638
00:38:16,802 --> 00:38:18,303
One or two.

639
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,637
Why don't we get some coffee?

640
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,473
I don't want coffee.

641
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,008
I want to confess.

642
00:38:24,043 --> 00:38:29,481
You want to confess to what?

643
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:33,818
I killed LaGuerta.

644
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:34,819
You what?

645
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,654
- I killed LaGuer--
- Shh.

646
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:37,956
Whoa, whoa.

647
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,791
Why don't we go someplace quiet
where we can talk?

648
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:40,992
Fuck!

649
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:43,061
I got you.

650
00:38:43,095 --> 00:38:45,129
Take it easy.

651
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:48,600
Calm down.

652
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,416
Deb, what are you
talking about?

653
00:39:05,451 --> 00:39:08,820
I told you.
I killed LaGuerta.

654
00:39:08,854 --> 00:39:10,727
That doesn't make any sense.

655
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:12,303
It does.

656
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:18,065
On New Year's Eve,
I was at Papa's.

657
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:23,463
I called dispatch to find out
where she was going.

658
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:25,932
They said she was going
to the shipping yard,

659
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:28,668
where she met Estrada before.

660
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:31,104
Right, so you feel guilty
that you didn't back her up.

661
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:33,040
I don't feel guilty.

662
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:34,741
I am guilty.

663
00:39:34,776 --> 00:39:38,011
No, you can't let yourself
think that way.

664
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:39,980
You had no way of knowing
what she was doing there.

665
00:39:40,014 --> 00:39:43,283
I did know.

666
00:39:43,317 --> 00:39:44,618
I killed her.

667
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:48,522
Deb, Estrada killed LaGuerta.

668
00:39:48,556 --> 00:39:52,225
We both know that.

669
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,427
That's not what happened.

670
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:54,861
I'll tell you what happened.

671
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:56,496
I know what happened.

672
00:39:56,531 --> 00:39:57,864
The bullet that killed LaGuerta

673
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:00,233
came from Estrada's gun.

674
00:40:00,268 --> 00:40:02,102
He shot first.
It was a through and through.

675
00:40:02,136 --> 00:40:03,970
That bullet
was never recovered.

676
00:40:04,005 --> 00:40:05,605
She shot back.
He went down.

677
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,474
He got one more shot off,

678
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:11,378
and that bullet was traced
to Estrada's gun.

679
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:15,882
They both died
at the same time.

680
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:17,184
That's not true.

681
00:40:17,218 --> 00:40:18,552
It is.

682
00:40:18,586 --> 00:40:21,188
Remember, Dexter walked us
through it.

683
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:22,756
Dexter!
Oh, fuck.

684
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,791
Hey.

685
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:27,661
Oh, God, Joey,
you have to believe--

686
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:29,496
Okay, okay, okay.
I believe you.

687
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,898
I believe you.
All right?

688
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,533
Okay.

689
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:37,571
Here, just write down
everything you remember

690
00:40:37,605 --> 00:40:38,572
from that night, all right?

691
00:40:38,606 --> 00:40:39,706
- Okay.
- All right.

692
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:44,411
Good. Good.

693
00:40:44,445 --> 00:40:45,445
Okay.

694
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,447
I'll be right back with you.

695
00:40:55,823 --> 00:40:57,824
What about Arnold Gordon?

696
00:40:57,859 --> 00:40:58,925
Trauma surgeon.

697
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,327
He definitely has
the right skill set.

698
00:41:00,361 --> 00:41:01,761
Motive?

699
00:41:01,796 --> 00:41:04,264
He always resented the fact
that I called him a psychopath,

700
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:05,532
and he threatened to hurt me

701
00:41:05,566 --> 00:41:08,168
if ever I told anyone
that he was.

702
00:41:13,107 --> 00:41:14,107
Morgan.

703
00:41:14,142 --> 00:41:15,622
You need to get down
to the station.

704
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,878
I'm a little busy.

705
00:41:17,912 --> 00:41:19,946
Yeah, well, your sister just
confessed to killing LaGuerta.

706
00:41:19,981 --> 00:41:21,047
What?

707
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:23,010
She's drunk, high, fuck
and I don't know why.

708
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,992
I put her into the interrogation room
so no one else could see her.

709
00:41:25,112 --> 00:41:26,079
Make sure she stays there.

710
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:27,080
I'm on my way.

711
00:41:27,114 --> 00:41:28,420
All right.

712
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:32,919
Is everything okay?

713
00:41:32,953 --> 00:41:36,055
It's Debra.

714
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,925
I need you to come
to the station with me.

715
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,059
Has something happened?

716
00:41:40,094 --> 00:41:41,810
Yes.

717
00:41:45,566 --> 00:41:47,834
I can't believe
she actually confessed.

718
00:41:47,868 --> 00:41:50,370
I really thought I got her
to see that she's a good person.

719
00:41:50,404 --> 00:41:51,684
This could have been
the only way

720
00:41:51,705 --> 00:41:54,107
she could relieve herself
of the guilt.

721
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:55,908
I need you to help me
get her out of this.

722
00:41:55,943 --> 00:41:57,176
Give your expert opinion

723
00:41:57,211 --> 00:41:59,078
that she's having a breakdown
or something.

724
00:41:59,113 --> 00:42:00,613
Are you sure?

725
00:42:00,647 --> 00:42:02,615
This could be
the best thing for her.

726
00:42:02,649 --> 00:42:05,084
Spending the rest
of her life in prison?

727
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,552
That's the last thing
Deb needs.

728
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:07,854
Or the last thing you need.

729
00:42:07,888 --> 00:42:10,656
If Debra goes away,
odds are, you'll join her.

730
00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:12,492
Admit it, Dexter.

731
00:42:12,526 --> 00:42:14,394
You're mostly worried
about yourself.

732
00:42:14,428 --> 00:42:17,063
That's not true.

733
00:42:17,097 --> 00:42:18,631
I told you, I love her.

734
00:42:18,665 --> 00:42:20,199
Not the same way she loves you.

735
00:42:20,234 --> 00:42:21,801
When Debra killed LaGuerta,

736
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:24,637
it was real, selfless love.

737
00:42:24,671 --> 00:42:28,641
She sacrificed everything
she believed in for you.

738
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:30,643
Can you see that?

739
00:42:31,879 --> 00:42:33,679
Your sister
needs professional help.

740
00:42:33,714 --> 00:42:37,583
There's nothing more
you can do.

741
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:41,220
Well, I can't just
give up on her.

742
00:42:41,255 --> 00:42:43,089
I can't.

743
00:43:00,074 --> 00:43:01,374
Dex, hey.
Dr. Vogel.

744
00:43:01,408 --> 00:43:02,642
Mm-hmm.

745
00:43:02,676 --> 00:43:04,043
She's an old friend
of Deb's and dad,

746
00:43:04,078 --> 00:43:05,611
so I figured she could help.

747
00:43:05,646 --> 00:43:07,166
Is she still
in the interrogation room?

748
00:43:07,181 --> 00:43:08,314
Yeah.

749
00:43:08,348 --> 00:43:09,916
Have you told anyone else
what she said?

750
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,117
Of course not.
It's crazy, right?

751
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:12,819
I mean, she's obviously
going through something.

752
00:43:12,853 --> 00:43:15,655
She's likely suffering from
posttraumatic stress disorder,

753
00:43:15,689 --> 00:43:17,523
after Captain LaGuerta's death.

754
00:43:17,558 --> 00:43:18,624
She wasn't even there.

755
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:20,026
One of the most common
components of that

756
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,494
is survivor's guilt,

757
00:43:21,528 --> 00:43:23,629
the belief that she could have
somehow prevented

758
00:43:23,664 --> 00:43:24,931
what happened.

759
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:26,132
That's what I was telling her.

760
00:43:26,166 --> 00:43:28,434
Not an uncommon response
in this situation.

761
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:33,272
We have to get her out of here.

762
00:43:33,307 --> 00:43:35,341
What the fuck
are you doing here?

763
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:37,710
Watch the hallway.

764
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:39,312
Deb, this is Dr. Vogel.

765
00:43:39,346 --> 00:43:40,413
She was a friend of dad's.

766
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:41,714
You can trust her.
She can help.

767
00:43:41,748 --> 00:43:43,449
Hello, Debra.

768
00:43:43,484 --> 00:43:44,450
I don't give a fuck
who you are.

769
00:43:44,485 --> 00:43:46,085
Get the fuck out.

770
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,855
Debra, I know how much pain
you must be feeling.

771
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:50,409
But we need to talk
about this together

772
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:51,757
before you do something
that you might regret

773
00:43:51,792 --> 00:43:52,758
for the rest of your life.

774
00:43:52,793 --> 00:43:53,960
Regret?

775
00:43:53,994 --> 00:43:56,829
The thing that I regret
happened six months ago.

776
00:43:56,864 --> 00:43:58,231
I'm confessing everything.

777
00:43:58,265 --> 00:44:00,099
I'm telling
the whole fucking truth!

778
00:44:00,134 --> 00:44:01,134
There's nothing you can do
to stop me!

779
00:44:01,168 --> 00:44:02,135
Deb, please, let us--

780
00:44:02,169 --> 00:44:05,505
Quinn, let me--

781
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:06,672
That was interesting.

782
00:44:06,707 --> 00:44:12,278
Here.
Hold this.

783
00:44:12,312 --> 00:44:15,014
She passed out.

784
00:44:15,048 --> 00:44:17,683
We must take her home to rest.

785
00:44:17,718 --> 00:44:20,353
Let's get her out of here.

786
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:26,259
Is she gonna be okay?

787
00:44:26,293 --> 00:44:28,094
Absolutely.

788
00:44:28,128 --> 00:44:29,362
There may be some work to do,

789
00:44:29,396 --> 00:44:30,897
but I promise,

790
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:34,867
Debra's gonna get through this.

791
00:44:34,902 --> 00:44:36,435
Is there anything else
you need?

792
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:37,770
Not right now.

793
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:39,272
Thanks for calling.

794
00:44:39,306 --> 00:44:41,274
You did the right thing.

795
00:44:45,979 --> 00:44:47,880
What the fuck?

796
00:45:02,629 --> 00:45:04,397
Are you sure she's gonna
be all right,

797
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:05,798
with everything she has
in her system?

798
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:07,133
Physically, she's fine.

799
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,901
It was a very low dose.

800
00:45:08,936 --> 00:45:11,404
But emotionally...

801
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:17,043
this is all my fault.

802
00:45:17,077 --> 00:45:19,545
Go easy on yourself.

803
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,549
I should have listened to you.

804
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:25,218
I thought I could fix this,
but you're right.

805
00:45:25,252 --> 00:45:27,687
I can't.

806
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:31,791
I don't want to just keep
making her worse.

807
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:43,302
Do you really think
you can help her?

808
00:45:43,337 --> 00:45:45,638
Yes.

809
00:45:51,878 --> 00:45:54,513
Okay.

810
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:57,350
Go now.

811
00:45:57,384 --> 00:46:00,820
Let me do what I do.

812
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:04,457
Wait.

813
00:46:16,536 --> 00:46:18,104
Dexter, what are you doing?

814
00:46:18,138 --> 00:46:22,642
She's gonna be pissed
when she wakes up,

815
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:24,510
maybe even violent.

816
00:46:24,544 --> 00:46:27,013
I can handle her.

817
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:30,149
You don't know my sister.

818
00:46:33,553 --> 00:46:35,488
Thanks.

819
00:46:40,727 --> 00:46:43,095
Vogel was right.

820
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:45,131
I am perfect.

821
00:46:49,936 --> 00:46:52,872
But only at one thing.

822
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:09,121
You're disgusting.

823
00:47:09,156 --> 00:47:11,123
A cannibal.

824
00:47:11,158 --> 00:47:14,393
A consumer of human flesh.

825
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:19,198
There was a time
when I couldn't imagine

826
00:47:19,232 --> 00:47:22,335
anyone being what you are,

827
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:26,172
and doing what you do.

828
00:47:26,206 --> 00:47:28,674
But now I realize
I'm just like you.

829
00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:37,516
I consume everyone I love.

830
00:47:52,020 --> 00:48:02,838
