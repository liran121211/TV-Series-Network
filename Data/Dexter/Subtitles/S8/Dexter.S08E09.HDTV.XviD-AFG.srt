2
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:48,046
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,215
I should be focused on
who bludgeoned Cassie and why.

4
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,784
But instead,

5
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:54,018
ever since Hannah came back
into my orbit,

6
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:57,555
she's all I can think about.

7
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:59,891
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

8
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:00,958
I don't know him.

9
00:02:00,993 --> 00:02:02,560
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:02,594 --> 00:02:04,429
Joey, my friend was murdered.

11
00:02:04,463 --> 00:02:06,030
Once they catch the killer,

12
00:02:06,065 --> 00:02:08,099
you're not gonna have
to be scared anymore, okay?

13
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,267
You know if it were Deb
asking you to stay,

14
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:11,402
you wouldn't
even put up a fight.

15
00:02:11,437 --> 00:02:13,704
She'd want to catch the killer
as bad as I do.

16
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,440
Sorry I'm not Deb.

17
00:02:15,474 --> 00:02:17,208
I think Hannah McKay
is back in Miami.

18
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:18,709
Are you interested or not?

19
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:19,710
Very.

20
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,312
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:23,915
I came here for her.

22
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:25,283
Who the fuck are you?

23
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,984
Who the fuck are you?

24
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,152
I don't wanna know.

25
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:29,921
I don't want to
know anything else ever.

26
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:31,656
She's your problem now.

27
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,392
I can't go to jail, Hannah.

28
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:35,893
Lose my kids again?
I couldn't take it.

29
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:39,130
We've always stuck together.

30
00:02:39,164 --> 00:02:41,732
That's not gonna change now,
is it?

31
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:45,303
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

32
00:02:45,337 --> 00:02:47,638
Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

33
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:49,034
So how did my blood
end up there?

34
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,975
Your plane leaves at 8:00.

35
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,778
27 minutes later
you'll land in Nassau.

36
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,746
From there, where you go
is up to you.

37
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:58,082
Where do you think you'll go?

38
00:02:58,117 --> 00:02:59,283
I haven't decided.

39
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:00,518
Argentina?

40
00:03:07,126 --> 00:03:10,194
Every contact leaves a trace.

41
00:03:10,229 --> 00:03:13,131
But the changes--they're never
what we anticipate.

42
00:03:13,165 --> 00:03:15,166
I believe Hannah McKay
was just in Miami

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,368
going under the alias
of Maggie Castner.

44
00:03:17,402 --> 00:03:20,404
Stay with me.

45
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:43,594
I just want to stay here
with you.

46
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:47,965
I know, but you can't.

47
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,103
Dexter, I'm so sorry
about Zach.

48
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:53,704
I know how much he meant
to you.

49
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,643
I need to see Dr. Vogel
and figure out our next move.

50
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:02,780
You should stay here,
inside, out of view.

51
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:05,683
But I have to see Arlene
this afternoon after her shift.

52
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:07,051
Why?

53
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:08,319
It's not safe for me
to draw money

54
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:10,588
out of Maggie Castner's
bank account anymore.

55
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:13,057
The only money I have is

56
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:15,393
what I've been sending away
to Arlene to hold for me.

57
00:04:15,427 --> 00:04:17,929
And I'm gonna need
that money to...

58
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:21,265
start a new life.

59
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,701
Okay.

60
00:04:23,735 --> 00:04:26,971
"Be careful."
I know.

61
00:04:31,276 --> 00:04:36,080
Actually I was gonna say,
"I love you."

62
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:39,383
I love you too.

63
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:47,491
Poor child.

64
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:50,494
I'm gonna have to find a way
to let the family know.

65
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:52,730
Just give me a little time

66
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:55,399
before Miami Metro
gets brought in.

67
00:04:55,434 --> 00:04:57,101
I will.

68
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:59,904
This is the song
that was playing

69
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,439
when I found Zach's body.

70
00:05:07,212 --> 00:05:08,412
Do you know it?

71
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:10,147
Yes, of course.
I used to play it all the time.

72
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:12,083
Still do.

73
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:13,618
Does it mean anything?

74
00:05:13,652 --> 00:05:16,387
It's just a pleasant song.

75
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,956
But possibly some of my patients
heard me playing it.

76
00:05:18,991 --> 00:05:20,625
♪ They may try and sell ya ♪

77
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,032
There are some signs
of a struggle.

78
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:32,136
They fought here.

79
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,205
This table was out of place.

80
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:37,975
But whoever did this
cleaned up after himself.

81
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,211
There's no blood.

82
00:05:40,245 --> 00:05:43,014
I wish I could understand
what this is all about,

83
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,548
why he's doing this.

84
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:48,552
I mean, it's clearly not simply
to frighten me.

85
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:49,820
He's trying to send a message.

86
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:51,222
But what is the message?

87
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,456
I don't care
what his message is.

88
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:53,791
He killed Zach.

89
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:56,160
He broke into my apartment
and dumped his body there.

90
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:57,395
What if Harrison had been home?

91
00:05:57,429 --> 00:06:01,632
I will find who did this,
and I will kill him.

92
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,235
I'm sure you will, Dexter.

93
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:07,238
But you need to remain focused.

94
00:06:07,272 --> 00:06:10,608
I am focused.

95
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,781
Blood.

96
00:06:16,815 --> 00:06:18,282
He missed it.

97
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:23,287
And a few hairs pulled out
by the roots.

98
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,260
There's a big fingerprint
in the middle of it all.

99
00:06:29,294 --> 00:06:31,262
Zach's, most likely.

100
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:37,268
Almost like
it was put there deliberately.

101
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:39,270
Zach learned from me.

102
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:41,572
He knew the importance of DNA.

103
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:43,607
It's possible
that he ripped these hairs

104
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:45,276
from whoever attacked him

105
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,977
and stuck them there
for me to find.

106
00:06:47,012 --> 00:06:50,114
If this is a clue, as you said,

107
00:06:50,148 --> 00:06:51,282
then Zach acted

108
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:56,454
with extraordinary calm,
rational thought.

109
00:06:56,488 --> 00:06:58,322
Yes.

110
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:01,058
Something I'm not sure
you're doing right now, Dexter.

111
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:02,893
What?

112
00:07:02,928 --> 00:07:04,662
Your desire
to avenge Zach's death,

113
00:07:04,696 --> 00:07:08,699
that's an emotional response,

114
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:12,770
possibly fueled by having to
say good-bye to Hannah.

115
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:15,306
I didn't say good-bye to her.

116
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,074
How do you mean?

117
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:20,244
We're going to make
a life together.

118
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:22,847
Dexter, how?

119
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:23,881
I don't know.

120
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:27,585
We'll figure it out.

121
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,790
Over the time
I've spent with you,

122
00:07:32,824 --> 00:07:34,358
I've come to realize
that you're not

123
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:39,296
the perfect psychopath
I thought you were.

124
00:07:39,298 --> 00:07:43,267
You have a depth of emotion
I never thought possible.

125
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:47,071
It's true.

126
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:49,206
I'll find the brain surgeon.

127
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,776
And I'll kill him.

128
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,747
But once I do I'm gonna
focus on a life with Hannah.

129
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:02,086
I think you
misunderstood my point.

130
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,689
Straddling two worlds
as you are, it's dangerous.

131
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:09,994
Killers cannot have
a full emotional life.

132
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:14,732
I think you underestimate me.

133
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:22,573
So this is Maggie Castner's
passport photo.

134
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:23,974
That's Hannah McKay's.

135
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,109
I won't even ask
how you got those.

136
00:08:25,143 --> 00:08:27,111
Good. Please don't.

137
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:29,146
They look pretty much the same.

138
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,681
Have you had contact?

139
00:08:30,715 --> 00:08:32,149
I have not.

140
00:08:32,184 --> 00:08:33,451
Her boat left
for St. Kitt's yesterday,

141
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:35,553
but I don't think
she was on it.

142
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:38,088
What makes you think that?

143
00:08:38,123 --> 00:08:39,390
Just a hunch.

144
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,725
A lot of good that does me.
What about her husband?

145
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,060
Supposedly in New York City,

146
00:08:43,094 --> 00:08:44,562
but there's no record of
his jet ever landing there,

147
00:08:44,596 --> 00:08:47,498
much less taking off from here,
so...don't know.

148
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:49,733
All right, then.
I'll look into this.

149
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:51,435
There's, uh...
there's one more thing.

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,471
I'd actually like to be a part
of the team on this one.

151
00:08:54,973 --> 00:08:57,741
Thanks, but the marshal service
doesn't really take on partners.

152
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:00,277
- I understand, but--
- If I do happen to find her

153
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:03,681
you'll get your reward money.

154
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:04,682
Fair enough.

155
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:06,951
All right.

156
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:11,455
Deb.

157
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,658
Hey.

158
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:20,798
I saw you from my car and I--
I had this moment

159
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:23,901
where it was
just like old times.

160
00:09:23,935 --> 00:09:26,470
Tell me you're here to see me.

161
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:28,472
Quinn, actually.

162
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,274
I meant what I said
the other day.

163
00:09:30,308 --> 00:09:32,142
We'd love you
to come back with us.

164
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:33,911
I just don't think
Matthews would go for it.

165
00:09:33,945 --> 00:09:35,279
He was pissed that I left
so abruptly.

166
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:38,949
You never know, Deb.

167
00:09:38,984 --> 00:09:43,153
I'll leave you two be.

168
00:09:43,188 --> 00:09:44,188
Thanks for coming.

169
00:09:44,222 --> 00:09:46,457
I need to, uh,
ask you for a favor.

170
00:09:46,491 --> 00:09:47,691
Yeah. Anything.

171
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:49,493
I think I know
who Cassie's killer is,

172
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:51,161
but Matthews asked me
to lay off.

173
00:09:51,196 --> 00:09:52,630
The guy's from
this rich fuckin' family.

174
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,032
So I was wondering if you could
look into him for me.

175
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,934
Sure. This all you have?

176
00:09:56,968 --> 00:09:59,703
Yup. His info.

177
00:09:59,738 --> 00:10:04,208
Social, address,
his name's Zach Hamilton.

178
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:05,976
Kid's a fucking serial killer
in the making.

179
00:10:06,011 --> 00:10:10,281
I think Cassie's
the second person he killed.

180
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:13,484
Yeah, I will--
I'll get right on it.

181
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:16,854
I'm gonna go
say hello to Dexter.

182
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,325
The sooner I can
identify Zach's killer

183
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:23,027
the sooner I can
be done with all this

184
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:26,497
and get back to Hannah.

185
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,533
Excuse me,
you can't go in there.

186
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:31,735
- Sorry.
- Who the fuck are you?

187
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,638
Hey, hey, hold it.

188
00:10:34,673 --> 00:10:36,907
Deb, this is my daughter Niki.

189
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:41,211
Niki, this is
former lieutenant Debra Morgan.

190
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,681
Oh, shit. Sorry.

191
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:44,682
My dad says that
you're, like, a total rock star.

192
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:47,084
Why'd you leave?

193
00:10:47,118 --> 00:10:49,353
She's a curious one.
Come on.

194
00:10:49,387 --> 00:10:51,689
- Let's go see someone else.
- Nice to meet you.

195
00:10:57,562 --> 00:11:00,331
What the fuck are you doing
with Zach Hamilton?

196
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,332
Quinn called.

197
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:04,435
He thinks Zach killed Cassie.

198
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:10,407
I thought so too,
but I checked it out.

199
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:12,209
Zach didn't.

200
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:16,547
What was Zach doing
with you and Hannah in the Keys?

201
00:11:16,581 --> 00:11:18,749
Serial killers convention?

202
00:11:18,783 --> 00:11:23,554
I was helping
Dr. Vogel out.

203
00:11:23,588 --> 00:11:27,524
I don't know why I even
ask you these questions.

204
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:33,530
No one else knows.

205
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:35,633
Zach's dead.

206
00:11:40,105 --> 00:11:43,874
Now I know.

207
00:11:43,908 --> 00:11:45,576
I don't want to know,
'cause now I'm gonna have to

208
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,977
explain how I know.

209
00:11:47,012 --> 00:11:49,913
Kind of, yes.

210
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:53,651
I was thinking
about coming back here.

211
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,586
About being a detective again,

212
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,591
doing something good
for a change.

213
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:03,594
But it'll just lead me

214
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:07,731
into another fucked up
situation, won't it?

215
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:27,251
A familial match.

216
00:12:27,285 --> 00:12:31,689
...to Dr. Evelyn Vogel?

217
00:12:31,723 --> 00:12:33,490
What?

218
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:36,360
The hairs we found
in Zach's studio--

219
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,429
I ran a mitochondrial DNA
match on them.

220
00:12:38,463 --> 00:12:40,998
- It tests a person's mother line.
- Yeah, I'm aware of this test.

221
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:43,467
Well, it's a direct
match to you.

222
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,937
Zach's killer
is related to you.

223
00:12:46,971 --> 00:12:50,808
The brain surgeon
is related to you.

224
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:52,142
But how is that possible?

225
00:12:52,177 --> 00:12:55,612
I have no family.

226
00:12:55,647 --> 00:12:57,147
Well, not anymore.

227
00:12:57,182 --> 00:12:58,315
Anymore.

228
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:00,551
Well, I was married
and I had two sons.

229
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:02,553
Daniel and Richard.

230
00:13:02,587 --> 00:13:03,721
And now?

231
00:13:03,755 --> 00:13:05,456
They're gone.

232
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:09,026
What happened to them?

233
00:13:10,695 --> 00:13:14,031
One day I found Richard--
he was my youngest--

234
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:16,133
at the bottom
of our swimming pool, dead.

235
00:13:16,167 --> 00:13:18,302
At first I thought
it was an accident.

236
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:20,237
He wasn't a strong swimmer.

237
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:22,639
Then I realized the truth.

238
00:13:22,674 --> 00:13:27,177
My older son Daniel,

239
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:29,613
he...

240
00:13:29,647 --> 00:13:31,615
He killed Richard.

241
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:33,717
Yes.

242
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:37,654
Daniel was--
Daniel was highly intelligent.

243
00:13:37,689 --> 00:13:42,359
But he was also very troubled.

244
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:45,028
Oh, it was much more than that.

245
00:13:45,063 --> 00:13:48,132
He was devoid of empathy,

246
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,533
had a complete lack of fear,

247
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:54,505
of the sense
of right and wrong.

248
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,340
He was a psychopath.

249
00:13:56,374 --> 00:14:00,177
Realizing this and wanting to

250
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:03,781
find a way to help Daniel
led me into this field.

251
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:15,559
I failed Daniel, I--

252
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:19,630
I was never able to treat him.

253
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:23,801
Maybe that's one reason
I was so determined to help you.

254
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,269
This is Daniel.

255
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:29,306
My husband and I covered up his
involvement in Richard's death.

256
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,643
Said it was an accident, and...

257
00:14:32,677 --> 00:14:36,213
then we put Daniel
into a mental health institute.

258
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:38,816
He was only 14.

259
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,517
- Here in Miami?
- No.

260
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:44,421
No, I sent him back to England.

261
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:47,624
Three years later he was dead.

262
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:50,227
How?

263
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:53,764
A fire broke out in the wing
where Daniel was living.

264
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:55,199
Some idiot nurse
had left the door locked

265
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:57,701
to take a coffee break.

266
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:59,403
The children couldn't get out.

267
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:00,637
Seven of them perished.

268
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:03,640
One of them was Daniel.

269
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,609
Did you see the body?

270
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:08,445
No. My husband did.

271
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:13,217
He was horribly burned.

272
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,952
If it was his body.

273
00:15:14,986 --> 00:15:17,154
That's preposterous, Dexter.

274
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:18,689
He can't be alive.

275
00:15:18,723 --> 00:15:21,158
You said yourself
he's highly intelligent.

276
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:22,693
Could've faked his death.

277
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:24,661
But after all these years...

278
00:15:24,696 --> 00:15:28,131
why would he do
these terrible things now?

279
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:31,368
The brain cores.

280
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:34,004
Do they mean anything to you?

281
00:15:34,038 --> 00:15:37,407
Well...

282
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:40,577
well, even as a child,
Daniel was...

283
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:45,215
aware that he lacked empathy

284
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:49,553
and how I felt about it.

285
00:15:49,587 --> 00:15:54,558
It's possible he boxed some up
and left it at my door.

286
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:11,541
Daniel Vogel would be
in his mid-40s.

287
00:16:22,086 --> 00:16:24,688
Anybody. Nobody.

288
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:39,870
That guy Cassie was dating.

289
00:16:39,904 --> 00:16:42,272
He was interviewed that night.

290
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:51,214
Oliver Saxon.

291
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:03,293
Is it possible
this is Vogel's son?

292
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:16,773
Daniel Vogel is Oliver Saxon.

293
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:18,909
You created
half a dozen fake I.D.s.

294
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:20,377
He could've done the same.

295
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:25,382
The easiest way is to assume
the identity of a dead person.

296
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:30,787
Oliver Saxon,
death certificate.

297
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:31,955
The guy's a fake.

298
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,191
Doesn't mean
he's your brain surgeon.

299
00:17:34,225 --> 00:17:38,028
I need to get
a DNA sample from him.

300
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:44,401
Dexter, this is
deputy marshal Clayton.

301
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:48,105
He's here on a tip that
Hannah McKay is back in Miami.

302
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,574
Uh, sorry if I don't
seem glad to meet you.

303
00:17:50,608 --> 00:17:52,542
This is kind of a shock.

304
00:17:52,577 --> 00:17:53,910
I guess that means
you haven't talked to her.

305
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,812
Why would I?

306
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,280
I told him
that you dated Hannah

307
00:17:57,315 --> 00:18:00,417
before you turned her in
for the Sal Price murders.

308
00:18:00,451 --> 00:18:02,386
Wasn't the smoothest breakup.

309
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,955
I guess not.
And that makes you a target.

310
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:10,427
Frankly,
the Hannah McKay I knew

311
00:18:10,461 --> 00:18:12,829
would be too smart to risk
coming back to Miami.

312
00:18:12,864 --> 00:18:14,831
Could be.

313
00:18:14,866 --> 00:18:16,433
Look, I got no definite
information she's here.

314
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:17,934
I'm just following up on a tip.

315
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,003
Yeah, but until
we know for sure,

316
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:23,006
I think we should put unis
on you just till this plays out.

317
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:24,841
That's the last thing I need

318
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:26,443
while I'm trying
to help Hannah stay hidden.

319
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:28,712
On the other hand, the brain
surgeon's still out there.

320
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:30,247
And he knows where I live.

321
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:32,749
Yeah, but I don't
need unis to watch me,

322
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:35,118
just my apartment and my son
when he goes to school.

323
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:37,621
Don't worry. We're gonna
watch Harrison like a hawk.

324
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:40,057
Deputy marshal Clayton...

325
00:18:40,091 --> 00:18:42,692
how do you plan to find Hannah
even if she is here?

326
00:18:42,727 --> 00:18:44,694
Well, I'm getting her picture
out with the local media

327
00:18:44,729 --> 00:18:46,863
asking anyone to call us
if they spot her.

328
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:48,832
'Kay.

329
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:50,600
But if by some chance
she decides

330
00:18:50,635 --> 00:18:53,336
you two need
to talk things over,

331
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,938
be sure and give me a call,
won't you?

332
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,273
Of course.

333
00:18:56,307 --> 00:18:58,141
Believe me, I want her
behind bars as much as you do.

334
00:18:58,176 --> 00:19:00,844
Okay.

335
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,986
This is exactly
what Vogel warned you about.

336
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,322
Trying to straddle both worlds.

337
00:19:12,356 --> 00:19:14,558
You should be following up
on Saxon right now.

338
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,360
Let Hannah handle
her own problems.

339
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:18,361
I can do both.

340
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:25,135
Hey.

341
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,803
Have you gone
to see Arlene yet?

342
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:28,171
No, I was just about to leave.

343
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:30,907
Don't. I just had
a federal marshal in my office.

344
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:32,843
They know you're here.

345
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:34,244
Oh, God.

346
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:36,646
You can't go to Arlene's.
You need to lay low.

347
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:40,417
Dexter, I can't start
a new life without that money.

348
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:44,121
- I can give you money.
- $1/2 a million?

349
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:45,889
Well, no.

350
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:49,759
Look, I'll drive you, I'm not
letting you go by yourself.

351
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:51,328
Okay, but hurry.

352
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:05,008
This marshal
changes everything.

353
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:07,043
We can never be together here.

354
00:20:07,078 --> 00:20:08,778
I know.

355
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:10,547
What are we gonna do?

356
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:14,985
Let's get your money,
and we'll figure that out later.

357
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:19,389
You were right.

358
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:22,192
The hotel manager in Key West
positively I.D.ed Zach.

359
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:23,627
He was down there
when she was killed.

360
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,428
Where the fuck do you
get your information from?

361
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:28,665
I have my sources.

362
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:29,666
Wish I had your sources.

363
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,968
Thought I had this one nailed.

364
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:34,638
Well, you're at square one.
You've been there before.

365
00:20:34,672 --> 00:20:36,373
You'll close it.

366
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:39,809
Just after the whole
sergeant dick dance, you know,

367
00:20:39,844 --> 00:20:41,011
I feel like I got
something to prove.

368
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,579
You're a good cop, Joe,

369
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:45,649
you don't have to
prove anything to anybody.

370
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:47,083
Then there's Jamie, you know,

371
00:20:47,118 --> 00:20:49,586
I kind of want
to solve it for her.

372
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,888
She was really close to Cassie.

373
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:53,190
Yeah.

374
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:55,625
And I just haven't
been there for her lately.

375
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,128
What do you mean?
I thought she moved in.

376
00:20:58,162 --> 00:21:00,697
I mean, like, emotionally.

377
00:21:00,731 --> 00:21:02,199
Come on, since when
are you Mr. sensitive?

378
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:03,366
Fuck you, okay?

379
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,035
God.

380
00:21:05,069 --> 00:21:08,505
It pours right out of you.

381
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,674
You know,
she's always accusing me

382
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,376
of comparing you to her.

383
00:21:13,411 --> 00:21:17,914
Oh. Um...

384
00:21:17,949 --> 00:21:20,884
well, I mean, I can't really
advise you on that.

385
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:21,885
Puts me in an awkward position.

386
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,053
Why is that?

387
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,155
Because of our history,
asshole.

388
00:21:25,189 --> 00:21:28,091
I mean, history is history,
right?

389
00:21:30,728 --> 00:21:33,697
Jamie knew Cassie
better than anyone,

390
00:21:33,731 --> 00:21:34,998
so maybe you should
question her again.

391
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,800
Maybe something'll turn up.

392
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,068
She's just been a wreck
about the whole thing.

393
00:21:38,102 --> 00:21:39,469
It's kind of hard
to walk the line

394
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:40,971
between caring boyfriend
and hard-nosed cop.

395
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:42,539
I'll talk to her.

396
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:44,541
- Really?
- Yeah.

397
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:45,642
Be fun to play cop again.

398
00:21:45,676 --> 00:21:47,410
That'd be great. Thanks.

399
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:49,145
You can buy me lunch.

400
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,182
And two fuckin' desserts.

401
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:05,095
This is a nice place.

402
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:06,263
Yeah, I found that
when you're a fugitive

403
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:08,231
asking somebody to hold
$1/2 million for you,

404
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:09,666
incentives are helpful.

405
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,201
So Arlene gets a cut?

406
00:22:11,235 --> 00:22:14,037
She gets what she needs
to keep the kids off welfare,

407
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:15,205
- and I get--
- The Bank of Arlene.

408
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:16,573
Exactly.

409
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:20,076
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, Arlene.

410
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:23,013
Aren't you
the asshole who turned her in?

411
00:22:23,047 --> 00:22:26,516
- That would be me.
- Long story.

412
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,517
Can we come in?

413
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:28,518
Yeah.

414
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:34,858
So now we're
back together, huh?

415
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:37,694
How's that gonna work out?

416
00:22:37,728 --> 00:22:40,664
We're figuring it out.

417
00:22:40,698 --> 00:22:42,198
I told the kids
there's snakes in here

418
00:22:42,233 --> 00:22:44,534
so they wouldn't go near it.

419
00:22:44,568 --> 00:22:46,503
There you go.

420
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:47,904
Oh, shit.

421
00:22:47,938 --> 00:22:50,874
Who's that?

422
00:22:50,908 --> 00:22:53,677
Federal marshal.

423
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:55,278
Stay here. I'll handle this.

424
00:22:55,313 --> 00:23:00,283
You answer the door.
Come with me.

425
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,087
Like you've got
nothing to hide.

426
00:23:14,398 --> 00:23:15,398
Can I help you?

427
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:16,433
Yeah, I'm deputy
marshal Clayton.

428
00:23:16,467 --> 00:23:19,202
You mind if I ask you
a few questions?

429
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:21,905
Uh, yeah.

430
00:23:24,608 --> 00:23:27,243
Dexter Morgan.

431
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:29,913
What the hell
are you doing here?

432
00:23:29,947 --> 00:23:30,914
Arlene's a friend.

433
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:33,717
We met through Hannah.

434
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:36,019
Really, now?

435
00:23:36,053 --> 00:23:37,454
Yeah, I just stopped by
to tell her what you told me,

436
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:39,522
that Hannah might be
back in Miami.

437
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:42,025
Yeah, I gotta keep
an extra eye on the kids.

438
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:46,463
Looks like you, uh,
recently changed your address.

439
00:23:46,497 --> 00:23:47,764
It seems like a step up.

440
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:50,467
Better school district.

441
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:52,869
It says here you work part
time waiting tables at Denny's.

442
00:23:52,903 --> 00:23:54,437
That's right.

443
00:23:54,472 --> 00:23:55,638
That won't buy you
a doll's house,

444
00:23:55,673 --> 00:23:57,207
let alone pay the rent
on this place.

445
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,843
You sure you haven't
gotten any help

446
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:01,511
from your friend Hannah McKay,

447
00:24:01,545 --> 00:24:02,846
who just happened
to have married a man

448
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,314
worth over $1/2 billion?

449
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:06,483
Didn't even know
she was married.

450
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:08,585
It says here you got a record.

451
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,286
Do you have any idea
how many years

452
00:24:10,321 --> 00:24:11,888
aiding and abetting
a fugitive will buy you?

453
00:24:11,922 --> 00:24:15,892
Look, I'm the one who's been...

454
00:24:15,926 --> 00:24:18,828
helping out Arlene.

455
00:24:21,432 --> 00:24:26,269
Now I see
what you two really bonded over.

456
00:24:26,303 --> 00:24:29,606
You sure can pick 'em.

457
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,441
Listen, do me a favor.

458
00:24:31,475 --> 00:24:34,043
Either of you hear from
your old friend Hannah McKay,

459
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:35,612
you give me a call.

460
00:24:35,646 --> 00:24:37,247
- Of course.
- Yeah, we will.

461
00:24:53,898 --> 00:24:55,131
Hey, Deb.
Dexter's not here.

462
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,233
I know, I was just driving by

463
00:24:57,268 --> 00:24:59,002
and I wanted to say hello
to the little man.

464
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:00,103
Oh.

465
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:01,617
Look, Aunt Deb,
I can write my name.

466
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:04,874
That's awesome.

467
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:10,847
I am so sorry about Cassie.

468
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:14,350
You doing okay
working here and everything?

469
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:17,387
Honestly, no.
Not really.

470
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:19,689
I mean, the cops are watching
the place, which helps.

471
00:25:19,723 --> 00:25:21,991
She have a lot of friends?

472
00:25:22,026 --> 00:25:24,627
Yeah.
She's pretty popular.

473
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:27,030
Everyone's just in shock,
you know?

474
00:25:27,064 --> 00:25:31,134
- Especially Oliver.
- Who's that?

475
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:34,838
This guy Cassie was dating.

476
00:25:34,872 --> 00:25:36,773
Were they dating
for a long time?

477
00:25:36,807 --> 00:25:38,675
Just a couple weeks.

478
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,710
I guess it was love
at first sight.

479
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:41,711
At least for him.

480
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:43,480
What do you mean, "for him"?

481
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:46,015
Between us, I think
Cassie was actually gonna

482
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,485
break it off with Oliver,
but then he was all,

483
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,386
"We should go to
the Bahamas for a week."

484
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:52,155
Bahamas after
two weeks of dating?

485
00:25:52,189 --> 00:25:54,657
Yeah, he just kept
pushing her into it.

486
00:25:54,692 --> 00:25:55,825
He would not take no
for an answer.

487
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,861
You weren't a fan of his,
I take it.

488
00:25:57,895 --> 00:26:00,597
Sometimes I just thought
he could be a little clingy.

489
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:04,334
But he was great to Cassie.

490
00:26:04,368 --> 00:26:06,503
Hey, we should all have someone

491
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,071
who worships us
like that, right?

492
00:26:11,008 --> 00:26:14,177
When was the trip to
the Bahamas supposed to happen?

493
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:17,213
This week, I think.

494
00:26:19,416 --> 00:26:23,052
Hey.

495
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:24,754
Quinn, it's me.
I just talked to Jamie.

496
00:26:24,788 --> 00:26:26,990
I think we need
to revisit the boyfriend.

497
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:28,725
Oliver Saxon.

498
00:26:32,963 --> 00:26:35,698
So you think Clayton
bought your little story?

499
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,433
I'm not sure.

500
00:26:37,468 --> 00:26:39,802
Either way, he's got
your photo all over Miami.

501
00:26:39,837 --> 00:26:41,538
It's not safe for you
to go back to the hotel.

502
00:26:41,572 --> 00:26:42,939
You need something private.

503
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:44,874
Yeah, but where?

504
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:47,777
I do know of one place.

505
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:50,246
Something tells me it's
the last place I'll want to go.

506
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:53,216
Debra's, if I can
talk her into it.

507
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:56,386
I was right.

508
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,955
I can't think of a better
option, can you?

509
00:26:58,989 --> 00:27:00,890
Unfortunately, I can't.

510
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:10,433
You mind answering
a few more questions?

511
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:11,501
Anything I can do to help find

512
00:27:11,535 --> 00:27:13,469
the guy who did this to Cassie.

513
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:15,271
This must be
really hard on you.

514
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:18,174
The last few days
have been a nightmare.

515
00:27:18,208 --> 00:27:21,177
I still can't even believe it.

516
00:27:21,211 --> 00:27:22,679
I just wish
I had time to breathe.

517
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:24,113
I'm so busy at work.

518
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:25,848
In fact, I'm already late
for an appointment.

519
00:27:25,883 --> 00:27:27,116
This won't take long.

520
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:29,152
What is it you do, exactly?

521
00:27:29,186 --> 00:27:30,286
Building inspections.

522
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:31,321
And that's where you were

523
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:32,455
at the time of Cassie's death?

524
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:33,723
Yes.

525
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,058
You're welcome to take
a look at my workbook.

526
00:27:35,092 --> 00:27:37,493
I was in Sunny Isles,
inspecting a new condo.

527
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:39,495
Just a few minutes
away from here.

528
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,663
Yes.

529
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:42,465
You must be pretty busy, huh?

530
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:45,335
I'm booked wall to wall
for the next few weeks.

531
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,803
Oh, really?

532
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:47,904
I thought you and Cassie

533
00:27:47,938 --> 00:27:50,640
were planning a trip
to the Bahamas.

534
00:27:50,674 --> 00:27:54,143
How were you gonna
work that in?

535
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:55,478
I...

536
00:27:55,512 --> 00:27:57,947
guess that was a little crazy.

537
00:27:57,982 --> 00:27:59,482
Cassie kept pushing for it,

538
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:00,984
and I didn't want
to disappoint her.

539
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:02,118
Oh, it was her idea?

540
00:28:02,152 --> 00:28:03,219
Yeah.

541
00:28:03,253 --> 00:28:04,587
She really wanted
a romantic getaway.

542
00:28:04,622 --> 00:28:06,656
Seems a little fast,
don't you think?

543
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,492
After a few weeks of dating.

544
00:28:09,526 --> 00:28:12,428
I know it's hard
for most people to understand,

545
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:14,497
but we had something special.

546
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:17,500
And we both knew it.

547
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:21,838
Look, I'm really sorry,
you guys.

548
00:28:21,872 --> 00:28:23,172
I've got to get going.

549
00:28:23,207 --> 00:28:24,507
Maybe we can
pick this up later?

550
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:26,776
Yeah, no.
We'll come back another time.

551
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:29,512
That would be great.
Thanks.

552
00:28:37,554 --> 00:28:39,155
He lied to us.

553
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:40,890
About what?

554
00:28:40,924 --> 00:28:42,959
Jamie said that whole Bahamas
thing was his idea.

555
00:28:42,993 --> 00:28:45,361
It was a way for Cassie
not to dump him.

556
00:28:45,396 --> 00:28:47,630
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
he's a killer, you know.

557
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:50,366
I mean, he just could be
fuckin' obsessed with her.

558
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:52,068
Yeah, well, it wouldn't
hurt to look into it.

559
00:28:52,102 --> 00:28:54,470
You know, look a little deeper
into his alibi.

560
00:28:54,505 --> 00:28:55,838
I'll get on that.

561
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:58,841
Feel that?

562
00:28:58,876 --> 00:29:00,009
What?

563
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:03,079
Us, you know,
working together again.

564
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:05,915
It's nice, you know?

565
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:07,350
Yeah, I mean, it's a lot better

566
00:29:07,384 --> 00:29:09,318
than doing background checks
for Elway.

567
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:13,589
- Yeah.
- I forgot how much I like it.

568
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,431
Shit.

569
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:23,900
Ah...I'm sorry.

570
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:25,435
I don't know why I did that.

571
00:29:29,206 --> 00:29:31,908
Let's just pretend you didn't.

572
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:34,510
- Okay.
- Okay.

573
00:29:44,488 --> 00:29:46,055
What the fuck?

574
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,958
Sorry, we let ourselves in.

575
00:29:48,992 --> 00:29:50,993
You two should talk alone.

576
00:30:07,845 --> 00:30:11,914
I need a place
where Hannah can stay.

577
00:30:11,949 --> 00:30:15,952
And you want that to be
my place?

578
00:30:15,986 --> 00:30:20,156
There's a federal marshall
after her.

579
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,991
He knows she's in Miami.

580
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:24,827
He's gonna do everything
he can to find her.

581
00:30:24,862 --> 00:30:27,163
It's the only move
I could think of.

582
00:30:27,197 --> 00:30:29,766
To bring Hannah to my house?

583
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,634
I know.

584
00:30:31,668 --> 00:30:33,436
It's only for
a couple of nights.

585
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,971
Just...

586
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:39,475
until I can get her
out of Miami.

587
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,010
Please?

588
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:49,218
A couple of nights, that's it.

589
00:30:49,253 --> 00:30:51,954
Thank you.

590
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:53,623
You could also thank me
for getting Quinn

591
00:30:53,657 --> 00:30:55,992
off Zach's trail.

592
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:59,095
How?

593
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:02,632
Simple. Get him
to focus on the boyfriend.

594
00:31:02,666 --> 00:31:05,835
Oliver Saxon.

595
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:08,171
Saxon?
You think he did it?

596
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:10,840
Well, he's a damn good suspect.

597
00:31:10,874 --> 00:31:12,775
Quinn and I
talked to him today.

598
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,944
If Saxon thinks
the police are onto him,

599
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:16,646
he'll know that I'm onto him.

600
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,648
You should stay away
from Saxon, Deb.

601
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:21,984
He could be more dangerous
than you think.

602
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,653
What are you talking about?

603
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,655
I can't go into it right now,

604
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:28,024
but please just...

605
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:29,826
do as I ask.

606
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,434
I knew going back to the force

607
00:31:38,468 --> 00:31:41,637
would put me in
a fucked-up situation.

608
00:31:41,672 --> 00:31:44,106
Here it is, ahead of schedule.

609
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:49,011
He's all yours.

610
00:32:05,963 --> 00:32:07,930
You'll be okay here?

611
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,701
Sure.

612
00:32:11,735 --> 00:32:13,202
We'll just hang.

613
00:32:21,612 --> 00:32:24,080
If Deb and Quinn
did anything to spook Saxon,

614
00:32:24,114 --> 00:32:26,349
I have to act fast.

615
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:35,558
I'm too late.
He's already moved out.

616
00:32:54,544 --> 00:32:57,747
But if this has his DNA,

617
00:32:57,781 --> 00:33:02,685
I can check it against the hairs
I found at Zach's studio.

618
00:33:02,719 --> 00:33:03,853
Here you go.

619
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:09,425
Are we going to see Hannah?

620
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,260
Hannah? Why?

621
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:12,328
I saw her on TV.

622
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:14,196
They said people
are looking for her.

623
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:16,966
Is she in trouble?

624
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,101
No, she's fine.
Hannah's...

625
00:33:19,136 --> 00:33:21,270
just popular.

626
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:24,206
You miss her?

627
00:33:24,241 --> 00:33:26,042
Yeah.

628
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:27,877
I liked playing with her.

629
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:29,779
She was nice.

630
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:34,517
I wish she could be my mom.

631
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:02,144
It's a match.

632
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:03,946
Saxon is Vogel's son.

633
00:34:12,756 --> 00:34:13,856
Daniel.

634
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:16,425
He's going by the name
of Oliver Saxon.

635
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,828
He was dating my neighbor
until he killed her

636
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:21,330
in her apartment
two doors down from mine.

637
00:34:21,365 --> 00:34:23,199
Do you have any idea
where he is?

638
00:34:23,233 --> 00:34:25,701
No, he cleared out
of his place.

639
00:34:25,736 --> 00:34:28,270
He could be anywhere right now.

640
00:34:28,305 --> 00:34:31,140
Suppose you do find him,
Dexter.

641
00:34:31,174 --> 00:34:32,274
What are you going to do?

642
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:34,443
What do you think?

643
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:36,679
I don't know
how I feel about that.

644
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:38,848
He's murdered
four innocent people,

645
00:34:38,882 --> 00:34:40,883
and he killed Zach Hamilton.

646
00:34:43,086 --> 00:34:44,220
He's my son.

647
00:34:44,254 --> 00:34:47,623
There's nothing
you can do for him.

648
00:34:47,657 --> 00:34:49,558
I can--I can try

649
00:34:49,593 --> 00:34:51,293
putting him back
into a safe facility

650
00:34:51,328 --> 00:34:53,863
where he can't hurt himself
or anyone else.

651
00:34:53,897 --> 00:34:55,331
I'm not going to let you
kill him, Dexter.

652
00:34:55,365 --> 00:34:56,465
I'm sorry.

653
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,401
You brought me into this.

654
00:34:58,435 --> 00:35:00,302
Because I didn't know
who he was then.

655
00:35:00,337 --> 00:35:04,874
Try and understand,
my youngest son is gone forever.

656
00:35:04,908 --> 00:35:07,910
Maybe I have a second chance
with Daniel?

657
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:09,879
You really believe that?

658
00:35:09,913 --> 00:35:12,148
You have a son.

659
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:13,983
Wouldn't you believe it?

660
00:35:14,017 --> 00:35:17,887
This second chance she wants
could get us both killed.

661
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:19,755
But, for her own sake,
I have to tell her

662
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,890
what she wants to hear.

663
00:35:20,924 --> 00:35:22,391
Fine, we'll do it your way.

664
00:35:22,426 --> 00:35:25,661
Just...
help me find him.

665
00:35:25,695 --> 00:35:28,364
Is there a way
to reach out to him?

666
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:30,599
I don't know.

667
00:35:30,634 --> 00:35:33,369
Think.

668
00:35:33,403 --> 00:35:35,404
The Mama Cass song

669
00:35:35,439 --> 00:35:37,506
that he left playing
in your apartment...

670
00:35:37,541 --> 00:35:38,774
What about it?

671
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:40,643
One of the few happy memories
I have with Daniel

672
00:35:40,677 --> 00:35:42,611
was when he was a little boy,
and every Saturday,

673
00:35:42,646 --> 00:35:44,747
I'd take him
to the King's Bay Cafe

674
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:46,382
in the marina.

675
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:49,251
There was a juke box there.

676
00:35:49,286 --> 00:35:52,922
And Daniel would
always play that song.

677
00:35:52,956 --> 00:35:54,924
Maybe it's more
than a happy memory.

678
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:57,827
Maybe it's an invitation.

679
00:35:57,861 --> 00:36:00,229
King's Bay Cafe.
It's still there.

680
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:07,903
Saxon's been one step
ahead of us this whole time.

681
00:36:07,938 --> 00:36:11,907
We know he stole
your computer files.

682
00:36:11,942 --> 00:36:14,243
But how could he have known
about Zach Hamilton?

683
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:16,579
We met him after that.

684
00:36:16,613 --> 00:36:18,914
The detailed notes that
you keep on your computer...

685
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,516
Yes?

686
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,819
I think Saxon's
been monitoring your laptop.

687
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:25,921
It wouldn't be hard.

688
00:36:25,956 --> 00:36:27,890
You just need
the right spyware.

689
00:36:27,924 --> 00:36:29,158
We can use this.

690
00:36:29,192 --> 00:36:30,559
Write an entry in your journal

691
00:36:30,594 --> 00:36:32,695
saying that you're going
to the King's Bay Cafe

692
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:33,963
tomorrow morning.

693
00:36:33,997 --> 00:36:35,731
And you think he'll read it
and go there?

694
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:36,932
Well, you said yourself
he's been trying

695
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:38,834
to send you a message.

696
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:41,504
He wants to see you.

697
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:58,454
I don't like deceiving Vogel.

698
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:01,257
But if it's the only way
to get to Saxon...

699
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:06,295
You had no choice, Dex.

700
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:09,031
You had to lie to her.

701
00:37:09,065 --> 00:37:10,366
I just can't believe Vogel

702
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,868
still thinks her son
can be helped.

703
00:37:12,903 --> 00:37:16,138
Well, it's not that crazy.

704
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:18,541
After everything he's done.

705
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:21,010
You would want to
help Harrison, wouldn't you?

706
00:37:22,145 --> 00:37:24,880
Vogel pretty much
made the same point.

707
00:37:24,915 --> 00:37:26,582
She's right.
I mean, look at what

708
00:37:26,616 --> 00:37:30,119
your own father did
to protect you.

709
00:37:34,758 --> 00:37:38,360
Right or not,
Saxon needs to be stopped.

710
00:37:38,395 --> 00:37:41,664
I'm putting him on my table.

711
00:37:41,698 --> 00:37:44,500
And how is Vogel
going to feel about that?

712
00:37:44,534 --> 00:37:46,569
I can't worry about it now.

713
00:37:46,603 --> 00:37:48,771
At least she'll be alive.

714
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:54,310
Well, you'll figure it out.

715
00:37:57,647 --> 00:38:02,251
I'm glad you're here.

716
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:03,886
I want to be able

717
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,589
to keep being here
for you, Dex.

718
00:38:10,594 --> 00:38:13,229
But?

719
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:15,464
But there's no life
for me here in Florida.

720
00:38:15,498 --> 00:38:18,033
We both know it.

721
00:38:21,171 --> 00:38:22,805
I can have a life
somewhere else

722
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:25,007
far away from here...

723
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:28,544
in Argentina.

724
00:38:28,578 --> 00:38:32,014
Maybe we all can.

725
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:34,316
You and Harrison
could meet me there.

726
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:36,885
We can start over.

727
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:42,358
It would be hard on Harrison
to uproot his whole life.

728
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:43,592
At first, it might be,

729
00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:45,461
but sometimes
change is a good thing.

730
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:48,063
- Sometimes it can--
- Yes.

731
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:57,206
Me, you, and Harrison...

732
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,775
we're gonna move to Argentina.

733
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,844
We'll make it work, Dex.

734
00:39:01,878 --> 00:39:04,013
I can give my notice
at Miami Metro,

735
00:39:04,047 --> 00:39:06,048
say I'm burnt out.

736
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:09,318
I'm taking Harrison
to travel for a while.

737
00:39:13,423 --> 00:39:16,225
Only Debra will know the truth.

738
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:27,469
Lieutenant.

739
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:29,371
Have you heard anything
on the whereabouts

740
00:39:29,406 --> 00:39:30,673
of Zach Hamilton?

741
00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:32,474
Zach Hamilton?

742
00:39:32,509 --> 00:39:35,411
You made it pretty clear
that we back away from him.

743
00:39:35,445 --> 00:39:36,712
I just got a call
from his parents.

744
00:39:36,746 --> 00:39:39,581
They haven't heard from him
in days.

745
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:41,750
Did they file
a missing persons report?

746
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:44,086
They just did.

747
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,589
Look...in case he does
turn up,

748
00:39:47,624 --> 00:39:49,591
I want to be the first to know.

749
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:51,260
I'll make sure of it.

750
00:39:57,867 --> 00:39:59,335
Deb, thanks for coming in.

751
00:39:59,369 --> 00:40:01,003
Yeah. What's up?

752
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:13,349
Welcome back
to Homicide, detective.

753
00:40:16,986 --> 00:40:18,721
You'll earn your way back up.

754
00:40:20,824 --> 00:40:23,459
You don't know how happy
this makes me feel.

755
00:40:23,493 --> 00:40:26,061
It's like the family
coming together again.

756
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:28,464
We gotta celebrate.

757
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:30,332
Yeah.

758
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,505
What?

759
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:39,441
It's all happening so fast.

760
00:40:39,476 --> 00:40:40,676
And?

761
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,411
Would you rather
it happened slow?

762
00:40:42,445 --> 00:40:44,646
I just...

763
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:47,116
need some time...
to think about it.

764
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,784
What's there to think about?

765
00:40:48,818 --> 00:40:49,885
Thought this
is what you wanted?

766
00:40:49,919 --> 00:40:52,554
It is.

767
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:56,291
I mean, I thought it was.

768
00:40:56,326 --> 00:40:59,128
I don't get it.

769
00:40:59,162 --> 00:41:04,133
I just need a little time,
you know.

770
00:41:04,167 --> 00:41:07,069
Take all the time you need.

771
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:15,411
Hey...

772
00:41:15,445 --> 00:41:17,179
Hold on to this.

773
00:41:38,168 --> 00:41:39,568
Hey.

774
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:41,837
Hey.

775
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:45,007
I, uh, tried
getting in touch with Saxon,

776
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,942
but, uh, he's not
answering his phone.

777
00:41:46,976 --> 00:41:49,912
And, uh, went by his place.
He cleared out.

778
00:41:49,946 --> 00:41:51,680
Shit.

779
00:41:51,714 --> 00:41:53,415
Yeah.

780
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,484
At least we're on
the right track.

781
00:41:55,518 --> 00:41:57,453
Yeah.

782
00:41:57,487 --> 00:41:59,455
Good luck with that.

783
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:03,025
Deb...

784
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:07,196
I, uh, wouldn't have
gotten this far without you.

785
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,465
I'm glad I could help.

786
00:42:24,214 --> 00:42:26,081
You cleaned.

787
00:42:26,115 --> 00:42:27,516
A little.

788
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:34,990
Well, I hope I can
still find shit.

789
00:42:35,024 --> 00:42:36,925
I used to know
where everything was.

790
00:42:41,464 --> 00:42:42,898
Hungry?

791
00:42:42,932 --> 00:42:46,268
Are you kidding?

792
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:48,704
Totally fair.

793
00:42:48,738 --> 00:42:50,272
Well, I am gonna eat,

794
00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:52,274
and I made enough for you too.

795
00:42:55,612 --> 00:42:57,079
You going back?

796
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:03,919
How the fuck can I go back?

797
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:08,190
My brother's a serial killer.

798
00:43:08,224 --> 00:43:10,792
And I have another one
hiding out in my house,

799
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:13,228
eating salad.

800
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:14,930
Sorry.

801
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:22,271
It was stupid to think
that I could go back.

802
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:32,748
Well, I know a lot
about wanting things

803
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:34,483
that you can't have.

804
00:43:34,517 --> 00:43:36,318
I wish,
somewhere along the line,

805
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:38,320
I'd learned to take no
for an answer.

806
00:43:38,354 --> 00:43:41,290
Would have made my life
a lot easier.

807
00:43:41,324 --> 00:43:43,058
But you didn't?

808
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:45,761
I'll take that one.

809
00:43:45,795 --> 00:43:47,362
Fine.

810
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:50,999
Well, it's just who I am.

811
00:43:51,034 --> 00:43:52,334
And, uh...

812
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:53,835
something tells me
that you might

813
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,837
be kind of the same way.

814
00:43:58,141 --> 00:44:00,943
Maybe that's the one thing
we have in common.

815
00:44:14,991 --> 00:44:17,826
I can't believe
I'm eating food you made.

816
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:19,962
It's not bad, though, right?

817
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:21,763
No.

818
00:44:26,703 --> 00:44:28,503
Mm.

819
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,207
All right, two-minute warning,
Harrison.

820
00:44:32,241 --> 00:44:33,609
Swim lessons are calling.

821
00:44:33,643 --> 00:44:35,043
Almost done.

822
00:44:37,814 --> 00:44:41,516
Sorry about this police
protection business.

823
00:44:41,551 --> 00:44:43,819
No, it's good.

824
00:44:43,853 --> 00:44:45,954
I'm actually glad
that they're here.

825
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,456
I mean, if Hannah
were to stop by,

826
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,058
poor Harrison would
probably run right to her.

827
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:51,393
He's not the only one.

828
00:44:54,163 --> 00:44:56,565
Dexter, hope I'm not intruding.

829
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,300
No, not at all.

830
00:44:58,334 --> 00:44:59,401
Come in.

831
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:02,037
All right.

832
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:03,405
What can I do for you?

833
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:06,408
Just checking in and making
sure everything's okay.

834
00:45:06,442 --> 00:45:07,409
Yeah, everything's fine.

835
00:45:07,443 --> 00:45:08,910
Well, good to hear.

836
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:11,413
I'm thinking
the Hannah McKay threat

837
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:13,181
has pretty much died down.

838
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:14,483
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I mean,

839
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:16,418
if she was here,
I'm pretty sure she's gone.

840
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:21,056
So I'm gonna recommend we pull
off your protective detail.

841
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,424
Okay.

842
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,227
All right.

843
00:45:25,261 --> 00:45:26,695
And what's your name?

844
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:30,565
- Harrison.
- Harrison.

845
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,834
Wow.
Is this your family?

846
00:45:32,869 --> 00:45:34,670
Mm-hmm.

847
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:37,572
Is this your daddy?

848
00:45:37,607 --> 00:45:39,408
That's you, right?

849
00:45:39,442 --> 00:45:40,876
Mm-hmm.

850
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,678
Now, who's the pretty lady?

851
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:49,151
That's my mom.

852
00:45:49,185 --> 00:45:50,419
Your mom?

853
00:45:50,453 --> 00:45:52,788
Hey, why don't you go
grab your towel, bud?

854
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:54,756
Swing time.

855
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:56,892
Come on, let's go,
little shark man.

856
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:03,965
He lost his mother
when he was just a baby.

857
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,234
I think drawing her helps him
feel closer to her.

858
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:08,370
Sure.

859
00:46:08,404 --> 00:46:12,474
Well, we really do
need to get going, uh...

860
00:46:12,508 --> 00:46:13,909
thanks for checking in.

861
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:15,711
All right, take care.

862
00:46:23,152 --> 00:46:24,586
Hey, you got a sec?

863
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,088
Sure.

864
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:33,462
Closing the door.
That's never a good sign.

865
00:46:33,496 --> 00:46:36,932
So Hannah McKay
dated your brother, huh?

866
00:46:36,966 --> 00:46:39,501
You didn't think to mention
that to me at all?

867
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:40,602
Thought never
crossed your mind?

868
00:46:40,636 --> 00:46:43,271
I didn't think
it was important.

869
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:45,073
What else are you not
telling me?

870
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:47,609
I don't know,
but if I told you--

871
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:49,111
Drop the bullshit, Morgan.

872
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:50,846
What happened in the Keys?

873
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,782
You see her?

874
00:46:53,816 --> 00:46:55,684
No.

875
00:46:55,718 --> 00:46:56,952
I don't believe you.

876
00:46:56,986 --> 00:46:58,186
'Cause you either saw her,

877
00:46:58,221 --> 00:46:59,661
or your brother told you
to lay off--

878
00:46:59,689 --> 00:47:01,123
Well, what if he did?
What does it even matter?

879
00:47:01,157 --> 00:47:02,991
Oh, I'll give you
250,000 reasons why.

880
00:47:03,025 --> 00:47:04,760
But, clearly, you and I
have different priorities.

881
00:47:04,794 --> 00:47:06,528
My brother?
Yeah. We do.

882
00:47:06,562 --> 00:47:07,929
You know, after all the things
that I've done for you,

883
00:47:07,964 --> 00:47:09,531
I find it hard to believe
that you could do this.

884
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:10,532
I really do.

885
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:12,134
And maybe you need
to ask yourself

886
00:47:12,168 --> 00:47:14,302
if this is the right job
for you.

887
00:47:14,337 --> 00:47:17,272
And if not, why don't you
get the fuck out?

888
00:47:17,306 --> 00:47:18,707
'Cause I could
use the office space

889
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:20,542
for somebody that gives a shit.

890
00:47:28,885 --> 00:47:30,552
Oh, Dexter.

891
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:34,222
Sorry, I...
know I'm early.

892
00:47:34,257 --> 00:47:36,525
I'd make you some coffee,
but I only have tea.

893
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,160
That'll do.

894
00:47:46,602 --> 00:47:49,638
I warn you, it's strong.

895
00:47:49,672 --> 00:47:51,740
I need all the help
I can get this morning.

896
00:47:51,774 --> 00:47:53,475
Thanks.

897
00:47:56,245 --> 00:47:57,846
Just so we're clear,

898
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,381
I'm meeting up with Daniel,

899
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:01,583
and I'll lead him
out of the cafe,

900
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:03,318
where you will sedate him.

901
00:48:03,352 --> 00:48:06,655
And--and we'll take him
to a facility.

902
00:48:19,335 --> 00:48:20,802
Every time I close my eyes,

903
00:48:20,837 --> 00:48:24,806
I-I still see his face.

904
00:48:24,841 --> 00:48:26,675
- Daniel.
- Yes.

905
00:48:26,709 --> 00:48:28,777
Now to learn that he's alive

906
00:48:28,811 --> 00:48:30,846
is just too good to accept.

907
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,849
It is hard to believe.

908
00:48:33,883 --> 00:48:36,551
But another part of me
knows it's true.

909
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:39,855
And I'm going to see him.

910
00:48:42,825 --> 00:48:46,027
My son.

911
00:48:46,062 --> 00:48:47,662
My little boy.

912
00:48:50,867 --> 00:48:53,401
He still exists.

913
00:48:53,436 --> 00:48:55,270
No--no matter
what he's done.

914
00:48:55,304 --> 00:48:57,405
Uhh!

915
00:48:59,942 --> 00:49:01,643
I thought
one of Hannah's potions

916
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:04,012
would be gentler
than my needle.

917
00:49:04,046 --> 00:49:06,047
Now Vogel will never
have to face

918
00:49:06,082 --> 00:49:07,682
what her son has become.

919
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:25,961
Can I get a cup
of coffee please?

920
00:49:25,968 --> 00:49:27,569
I'll bring that right over.

921
00:49:38,581 --> 00:49:40,415
Here you go.

922
00:49:51,027 --> 00:49:53,428
♪ Nobody can tell ya ♪

923
00:49:53,462 --> 00:49:54,502
Hey, Lucy.

924
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,897
Hi.

925
00:49:55,932 --> 00:49:58,433
♪ There's only one song
worth singin' ♪

926
00:50:11,981 --> 00:50:14,916
♪ Nobody can tell ya ♪

927
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:22,657
He's played that song
three times.

928
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:25,627
When is he gonna give up?

929
00:50:42,144 --> 00:50:46,281
I'll follow him until I find
a quiet place to grab him.

930
00:50:46,315 --> 00:50:47,782
For Vogel's own good,

931
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:49,784
it's time I killed
the messenger.

932
00:51:52,081 --> 00:51:53,381
Saxon must have spotted you.

933
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:55,083
He's good at this.

934
00:51:55,117 --> 00:51:58,486
He might think Vogel
sent you, Dexter.

935
00:51:58,521 --> 00:52:02,424
He could going to her house
right now.

936
00:52:04,493 --> 00:52:06,227
You've reached
Dr. Evelyn Vogel.

937
00:52:06,262 --> 00:52:07,829
I'm not available at this time.

938
00:52:07,863 --> 00:52:09,931
Please leave a message.

939
00:52:09,965 --> 00:52:12,000
Evelyn!

940
00:52:21,477 --> 00:52:22,844
You drugged me.

941
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:24,239
You have every right
to be upset,

942
00:52:24,246 --> 00:52:25,947
but I was only trying
to protect you.

943
00:52:25,981 --> 00:52:27,082
Where's Daniel?

944
00:52:28,717 --> 00:52:30,051
He got away.
That's why I'm here.

945
00:52:30,086 --> 00:52:31,052
To warn you.

946
00:52:31,087 --> 00:52:33,221
Well, I consider myself warned.

947
00:52:33,255 --> 00:52:35,090
And I think it best
from here on out

948
00:52:35,124 --> 00:52:36,558
that I handle this myself.

949
00:52:36,592 --> 00:52:39,027
It's not safe.
Or smart.

950
00:52:39,061 --> 00:52:40,762
I appreciate your concern,

951
00:52:40,796 --> 00:52:43,064
and I'm grateful
for everything you've done.

952
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:45,867
But this is a family matter.

953
00:52:47,736 --> 00:52:51,039
You once called yourself
my spiritual mother.

954
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:53,608
Doesn't that make us family?

955
00:52:53,642 --> 00:52:56,845
Well, after what happened
this morning, Dexter,

956
00:52:56,879 --> 00:52:59,214
how can I trust you?

957
00:53:03,252 --> 00:53:04,719
Well, trust me or not,

958
00:53:04,753 --> 00:53:06,688
I'm going to take care
of Daniel.

959
00:53:06,722 --> 00:53:09,290
Your safety and mine
depend on it.

960
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:11,926
And after that,
I'm on my way with Hannah.

961
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:14,362
- On your way?
- I'm leaving Miami with her.

962
00:53:14,396 --> 00:53:16,231
We're going away together
with Harrison.

963
00:53:16,265 --> 00:53:17,532
You know that won't end well.

964
00:53:17,566 --> 00:53:19,000
And you trusting Daniel,

965
00:53:19,034 --> 00:53:21,836
that he's not gonna
hurt anyone again--

966
00:53:21,871 --> 00:53:23,571
how will that end?

967
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:27,208
Leave this alone, Dexter.

968
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,589
Vogel thinks I'm unique,

969
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:43,491
caught between two worlds--

970
00:53:43,526 --> 00:53:46,327
my humanity and my darkness.

971
00:53:46,362 --> 00:53:48,663
Maybe I always will be,
but I can't imagine

972
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:51,766
a life without Hannah
in either one.

973
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,801
After this morning,
I won't have to.

974
00:53:53,836 --> 00:53:57,639
Vogel is on her own,
and so am I.

975
00:53:57,673 --> 00:54:01,509
I'll kill Saxon
and leave Miami forever.

976
00:54:03,913 --> 00:54:06,581
So now do you believe me?

977
00:54:06,615 --> 00:54:08,183
Yes.

978
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:10,485
You didn't send him.

979
00:54:12,555 --> 00:54:14,355
Are you hungry?

980
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,624
How about a little breakfast?

981
00:54:21,897 --> 00:54:23,631
Okay.

982
00:54:27,236 --> 00:54:29,337
Mom.

983
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:45,309
