2
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:48,503
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:49,849
What did you do to Yates?

4
00:01:49,884 --> 00:01:51,184
He has a scar
on his head exactly

5
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:54,154
where your killer has
been harvesting brain fragments.

6
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:57,233
High heels are a far cry
from brains.

7
00:01:57,268 --> 00:01:59,536
It's not exactly
your killer's usual M.O.

8
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,905
Albert wouldn't be the first
to alter his methods.

9
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,541
She found herself a hero.

10
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,242
I know her--

11
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:07,544
Janet Thorton.

12
00:02:07,578 --> 00:02:09,139
Do you think the girl
will be all right?

13
00:02:09,146 --> 00:02:10,213
I stemmed the bleeding.

14
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,748
I dropped her off
in front of the E.R.

15
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,950
These are patient files--

16
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,919
- your patient files.
- Dexter, don't.

17
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,787
"Somehow he's deluded himself

18
00:02:17,822 --> 00:02:21,291
into thinking his feelings
for his sister are genuine."

19
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:23,293
You're trying to keep me
apart from Deb.

20
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,562
That's another way
to isolate your subject--

21
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:26,996
see what he'll do.

22
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:28,531
When Yates is dead,

23
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:31,568
you are out of my life.

24
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:33,236
You understand?

25
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,571
What about you?

26
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:36,306
What makes you crazy?

27
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,440
Family shit.

28
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,810
Nothing says family like shit.

29
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:43,446
I see a lot
of your father in you.

30
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,950
Harry wrestled with the same
doubts regarding Dexter.

31
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:49,185
The code is a theory.

32
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,255
What Dexter did--
what we did--

33
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:54,123
I don't think
I can live with this.

34
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:55,925
Did dad kill himself?

35
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,961
He OD'd on
his heart medication,

36
00:02:57,995 --> 00:03:00,196
thought he'd created a monster.

37
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:01,998
I think I know how he felt.

38
00:03:02,032 --> 00:03:03,867
But he only got it half right.

39
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,747
Well, we're never
gonna get anywhere

40
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:53,783
unless one of you
starts talking.

41
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:59,289
Okay.

42
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,325
Debra, it seems that
you tried to kill Dexter

43
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,229
as well as yourself.

44
00:04:06,263 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes, but then I saved him.

45
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:11,901
You saved me?

46
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,170
You only had to save me
because you tried to kill me.

47
00:04:14,204 --> 00:04:15,271
I know, but--

48
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:17,006
You almost left my son
an orphan.

49
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,609
Harrison--who's gonna
take care of him?

50
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:21,678
Who?

51
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:25,381
I don't know.

52
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,583
All I've done my whole life

53
00:04:27,618 --> 00:04:29,819
is try to take care of you,
to protect you.

54
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,754
Protect--
Jesus Christ, Dexter.

55
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:33,389
If this is your way
of protecting me--

56
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:36,626
Okay, so I'm not perfect!

57
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,561
You think it's easy
being your brother?

58
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:40,263
You're not even
listening to me.

59
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:41,597
Y-you don't understand.

60
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:43,733
I've been trapped
in a fucking fog--

61
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,401
No, I don't understand.

62
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:47,837
Haven't you heard
anything she said?

63
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,539
I'm stupid that way.

64
00:04:49,573 --> 00:04:50,840
My brain is limited.

65
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:52,408
So when my sister
tries to kill me,

66
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:55,878
for some reason
it doesn't make sense.

67
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:58,982
It's true, Dexter,
what she said.

68
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,717
While in the throws of PTSD,

69
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:04,020
one's thinking becomes cloudy.

70
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,189
The weight of what
she has been through

71
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,424
has been too much
for her to bear.

72
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,794
Debra has been
in such a turmoil

73
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:13,529
that she sought out
the first solution

74
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,064
that presented itself.

75
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:16,165
I had just found out

76
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,402
that dad killed himself
because of you,

77
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:22,505
'cause of what you are.

78
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,542
I was fucking traumatized
by all this shit.

79
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,677
Yeah, so try to kill us both.

80
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:29,979
That solves everything.

81
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,583
You are overlooking
an important part

82
00:05:33,617 --> 00:05:35,518
of what happened, Dexter.

83
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,021
Yes, she tried to kill you,
the both of you.

84
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:40,857
And that was Debra
hitting rock bottom.

85
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:44,260
But ultimately, as she said,
she saved you.

86
00:05:44,294 --> 00:05:48,998
And that was Debra's
first step toward recovery.

87
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,433
You should see that
as a promising sign

88
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,335
for your sister.

89
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:55,338
Great.

90
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,943
I'm so fuckin' happy for you.

91
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:03,846
You know, I was trying
to catch a serial killer

92
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,348
before you tried to drown me.

93
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:07,250
If it's okay, I think
I'm gonna get back to that,

94
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,018
which, according to you,
is all I'm really good for.

95
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:10,653
Don't, Dexter.

96
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,623
To hell with both of you.

97
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:17,794
Don't forget to write
all this down.

98
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,268
I've never seen him so mad.

99
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,670
That wasn't just anger.

100
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,939
- Fuck, it wasn't?
- No.

101
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,475
Underneath all that is hurt.

102
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,913
Dexter is deeply hurt
by what you did.

103
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:40,216
Well, that makes two of us.

104
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,186
Family therapy--
who needs it?

105
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:49,659
Family--a burden.

106
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:51,194
They interfere.

107
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:55,531
They annoy.

108
00:06:55,566 --> 00:06:57,100
Daddy, I wanna watch cartoons.

109
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,468
They interrupt.

110
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,236
No, you need to get ready
for school.

111
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,571
I wanna watch cartoons.

112
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,272
School.

113
00:07:03,307 --> 00:07:04,428
Yates could be anywhere now.

114
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:05,675
He could've left Miami.

115
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:06,976
Dexter, do you have
any plans for tonight?

116
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:12,582
Um, not sure.

117
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,152
Dexter Morgan.

118
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,547
Please leave a message
at the tone.

119
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:20,823
It's me. Can we talk?

120
00:07:22,493 --> 00:07:24,060
Fuck.

121
00:07:24,094 --> 00:07:25,862
Harrison, apple or banana?

122
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:27,230
Banana.

123
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:30,800
I was thinking of having
Cassie over for dinner.

124
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,301
Okay, go ahead.

125
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,971
- I mean here.
- Why?

126
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:37,073
I think you'd hit it off.

127
00:07:37,107 --> 00:07:38,641
Five minutes of cartoons.

128
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:39,809
No minutes of cartoons.

129
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:41,210
You need to get dressed.

130
00:07:41,245 --> 00:07:42,812
So is that a yes?

131
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:43,980
Is what a yes?

132
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:45,381
Dinner tonight.

133
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:46,916
Two minutes of cartoons?

134
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,885
Harrison, this is not
a negotiation here.

135
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,319
- Now.
- 8:00?

136
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,787
Please, please, please?

137
00:07:51,822 --> 00:07:54,490
Yeah, fine.
Harrison, last warning.

138
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:08,037
- I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

139
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,414
This is one of the first days

140
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:21,417
I'm glad Deb isn't here.

141
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:26,389
I can lock myself in the lab

142
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,858
and don't have to listen
to anyone's voice but my own.

143
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:31,327
We gotta go
to the briefing room.

144
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,129
Now?

145
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:34,697
Now would be good.

146
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,477
You're probably wondering
why I'm smiling.

147
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:50,479
I'm never wondering
why you're smiling.

148
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:53,449
I've just confirmed
that I have a daughter.

149
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,985
Someone let you
impregnate them?

150
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:58,621
Made a donation
to a sperm bank 20 years ago.

151
00:08:58,655 --> 00:08:59,655
You're not saying there's

152
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:01,224
a female version
of you out there?

153
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:04,060
Oh, uh, you met her.
Niki--the one you showed in.

154
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:05,194
That hot chick that
was in your lab?

155
00:09:05,229 --> 00:09:07,029
- No fuckin' way.
- Yes way.

156
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:09,131
That beautiful girl
came from you?

157
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,267
Yes, indeed.

158
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,501
Are you sure she's yours?

159
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:13,936
Man, come on,
who you talking to here?

160
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,838
She came in with
the required paperwork.

161
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:17,340
I even pulled
a piece of her hair.

162
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:18,608
I just finished testing it.

163
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,743
She's a Masuka,
through and through.

164
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,511
That poor sweet child.

165
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:25,114
So you and me, Dex, both dads.

166
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,083
How about that?

167
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:29,552
Great news, Vince.

168
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:31,053
You know, I'm sure
it's all fine,

169
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:32,855
but just be careful, you know?

170
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:35,958
Family showing up like that,
out of nowhere?

171
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,827
Yeah. What do you mean?

172
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:39,028
Sometimes it's just 'cause

173
00:09:39,062 --> 00:09:40,329
they want something, you know?

174
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:44,533
Money, a place to stay,
a fuckin' kidney.

175
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:47,670
Or they wanna kill you.

176
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:49,038
Lieutenant Batista is currently

177
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:51,707
with Janet Thorton,
the stabbing victim

178
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,643
who was dropped off
at the hospital.

179
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,845
She finally came to and
is ready to make a statement.

180
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,812
She survived.

181
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,881
One less trophy for Yates.

182
00:09:58,915 --> 00:10:00,483
So I'm running the briefing.

183
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,752
The Norma Rivera case--

184
00:10:02,786 --> 00:10:04,053
the victim had sex with someone

185
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:05,621
shortly before she was killed.

186
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:06,922
So we're following
the theory that

187
00:10:06,957 --> 00:10:09,325
whoever she had sex with
is also her killer.

188
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,028
Dexter, were you able to
identify anyone via the semen?

189
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:15,031
Uh, no matches in any
of the criminal databases.

190
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:16,899
Whoever had relations
with Ms. Rivera

191
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:18,668
has never been arrested.

192
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:20,903
Right, and the M.E.'s report
showed no defensive wounds?

193
00:10:20,937 --> 00:10:23,773
Correct. It's most likely
not a rape.

194
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:26,542
She was probably friendly
with whoever killed her.

195
00:10:26,576 --> 00:10:29,111
What about the ex-boyfriend?

196
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,346
No, sir, we ruled him out.

197
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,540
He's been locked up in Orlando

198
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,482
for the past week
on assault charge.

199
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:36,619
We questioned the staff of
Ms. Rivera's former employers.

200
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:37,987
They led us to believe
she'd been

201
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:41,691
having an affair
with the boss Ed Hamilton.

202
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,025
When we tried to speak to him,

203
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,094
he lawyered up immediately.

204
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:47,997
So we got a court order
to compel a DNA sample from him,

205
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:50,466
to see if Hamilton
was Rivera's last visitor.

206
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,435
You think Hamilton
killed Norma,

207
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:54,737
to cover up their affair?

208
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:56,172
We're looking into it,
you know?

209
00:10:56,206 --> 00:10:57,506
Old, rich men don't like

210
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,275
having their
dirty laundry aired,

211
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:00,876
especially when it's the maid.

212
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,445
Dexter, I'm gonna need you
to join

213
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,947
me and Miller
in paying Hamilton a visit.

214
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:07,783
Okay, Janet Thorton gave us
the name of her abductor.

215
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:09,752
Albert Yates.
And we got a home address.

216
00:11:09,786 --> 00:11:12,521
I'm grabbing some unis now
and heading over there.

217
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,190
You won't find him home.

218
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:17,059
All right, let's get moving.

219
00:11:19,896 --> 00:11:21,731
- Lieutenant, got a minute?
- Yeah.

220
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,799
I noticed you had Quinn
run the briefing.

221
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:26,302
- Oh, yeah, how'd he do?
- He was fine.

222
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:28,404
Really? Good.

223
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,374
Is he your choice for sergeant?

224
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,542
I haven't yet
made that decision.

225
00:11:33,577 --> 00:11:34,977
For what it's worth,
I used to run

226
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:36,912
the morning briefings
back in the gang unit.

227
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,982
I'm ready to take on
more responsibility.

228
00:11:40,016 --> 00:11:42,918
Good to know. Thanks.

229
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,576
I just wanna make sure
you're aware that

230
00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:06,442
the Hamiltons are good friends
to Miami Metro.

231
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,445
Sure.

232
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:15,351
Be respectful.

233
00:12:15,385 --> 00:12:18,954
Any of Mr. Hamilton's
indiscretions

234
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,723
should take a back seat

235
00:12:20,757 --> 00:12:24,693
to solving
Ms. Rivera's murder.

236
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:27,830
I understand.

237
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:30,633
Good.

238
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:47,049
We're here for Mr. Hamilton.

239
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:00,529
- Mr. Hamilton.
- Mm-hmm?

240
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:03,499
These police officers
are here to see you.

241
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:08,771
Thank you, Claudia.

242
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,139
I thought my lawyer
made it clear

243
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,974
I wouldn't be speaking to you.

244
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,342
You don't have to say a word.

245
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,511
We're just here
for a cheek swab.

246
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,947
- A what?
- It's a DNA sample.

247
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:19,215
We do have a warrant.

248
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:20,529
Failure to cooperate
will give us

249
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,750
no choice but to arrest you.

250
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:23,319
Why do you need my DNA?

251
00:13:23,353 --> 00:13:24,954
Ms. Rivera's autopsy
revealed

252
00:13:24,988 --> 00:13:26,589
she recently
had sexual relations.

253
00:13:26,623 --> 00:13:29,758
My forensics partner is here
to see if it was with you.

254
00:13:29,793 --> 00:13:32,761
Wait, wait.
There's no need for a test.

255
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,468
Norma and I were
having an affair.

256
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:42,905
My wife found out and
insisted she be dismissed.

257
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,674
A scorned spouse--
was it the wife?

258
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:47,076
So your wife knew?

259
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,677
Just how upset was she?

260
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,312
No, no, no--my wife's
been in Atlanta

261
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:52,781
visiting her sister
for the past two weeks.

262
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:54,250
Oh, right, which is
giving you a little time

263
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:55,451
to visit Ms. Rivera.

264
00:13:55,485 --> 00:13:57,019
No. Yes.

265
00:13:57,053 --> 00:14:00,990
I mean, I didn't visit her.

266
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:03,659
She came by here to pick up
a few things she left behind,

267
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,929
and... one thing
led to another,

268
00:14:06,963 --> 00:14:11,767
and, uh, we did
have sex that day.

269
00:14:11,801 --> 00:14:15,938
But she left here alive.

270
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:17,840
You, uh, didn't visit
her apartment

271
00:14:17,874 --> 00:14:19,508
later that day, did you?

272
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:20,543
I was here all day.

273
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:22,144
The Hamiltons' son.

274
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,913
Can anyone corroborate that?

275
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,982
Dad?

276
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:30,686
- Dad, what's going on?
- Go inside.

277
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,880
You want me to call someone?

278
00:14:31,888 --> 00:14:32,888
I don't want you
to do anything.

279
00:14:32,923 --> 00:14:35,858
Go inside.

280
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,995
All right.

281
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,999
Sorry about that.

282
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,134
Where were we?

283
00:14:45,168 --> 00:14:46,569
You were saying you have proof

284
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,404
that Ms. Rivera
left the premises.

285
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:49,939
My security cameras--

286
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,740
you'll see Norma
arrive and leave

287
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:55,377
through the main gate, alone.

288
00:14:55,412 --> 00:14:58,380
I never, ever would hurt Norma.

289
00:15:01,351 --> 00:15:04,353
I loved her.

290
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:10,526
But does he love his son?

291
00:15:14,564 --> 00:15:17,533
It's Deb.

292
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:22,605
Hello--

293
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,608
Damn it.

294
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:38,587
Hey.

295
00:15:38,622 --> 00:15:40,956
Hey.

296
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:44,627
So you're, like,
what, the DNA guy?

297
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,629
I'm a forensic technician,

298
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,732
specializing in
blood spatter analysis.

299
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:52,067
Whoa.

300
00:15:52,102 --> 00:15:54,003
So, did you go to the place

301
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:55,938
where Norma Rivera was killed?

302
00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:57,773
I did.

303
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,575
And what did you see

304
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:04,413
in, you know, your analysis?

305
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:07,683
She was beaten to death.

306
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:11,286
Confidential, huh?

307
00:16:11,321 --> 00:16:12,988
Well, for what it's worth,

308
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:15,791
you're wasting your time
investigating my dad.

309
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:19,795
He's an asshole,
but not a killer.

310
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:22,297
That's quite a testament.

311
00:16:22,332 --> 00:16:25,267
In my family, it's about
as good as it gets.

312
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:35,177
One more happy family.

I'm not available at this time.

322

Please leave a message.

323
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,159
Dr. Vogel, it's Debra.

324
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:28,664
I'm--I need
to talk to you, so...

325
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,067
I'm gonna come by.

326
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,486
Dr. Vogel?

327
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,553
Oh, fuck.

328
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,292
Graves marked
by rosebushes--

329
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,361
Yates's previous victims.

330
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:02,364
He liked to keep them close.

331
00:18:02,398 --> 00:18:03,932
Three bodies so far--

332
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:06,702
a rosebush planted
on top of each.

333
00:18:06,736 --> 00:18:08,370
You think there are three more?

334
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:09,538
Count on it.

335
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,240
The sick bastard
turned his basement

336
00:18:11,274 --> 00:18:14,343
into a torture room.

337
00:18:14,377 --> 00:18:16,945
Yo, Dex, check this out.

338
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,616
All of his victims
have broken phalanges.

339
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,786
And it looks like the bones
were broken in sequence,

340
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,287
not all at once.

341
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:29,424
Look. This bone here had
begun the process of mending.

342
00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:31,927
So he kept him there
in that room for what, weeks?

343
00:18:31,961 --> 00:18:33,328
It looks like it.
He broke each one

344
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,697
of their toes until
he was done, and then--

345
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:38,834
Finished them off with
a single stab to the chest.

346
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,303
We think this was
one of his first victims.

347
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:43,205
We believe it's Kendall Jaynes,

348
00:18:43,239 --> 00:18:45,707
been missing since 2008.

349
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:48,644
He buries the victims'
purses and IDs

350
00:18:48,678 --> 00:18:49,845
with the bodies.

351
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:54,316
And, get this, with each one,
the left shoe.

352
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,021
I mean, heh, I like feet,
but this is just cray-cray.

353
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,722
- Deb...
- Started about 20 minutes ago.

354
00:19:00,757 --> 00:19:02,324
Lookin' to get
your old job back?

355
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,692
We could use you.
We have six bodies.

356
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:05,894
No, I need to talk to Dexter.

357
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,997
Dex.

358
00:19:09,032 --> 00:19:10,632
Thanks.
Deb, this isn't--

359
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,635
It's an emergency.
Vogel's been taken.

360
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:20,876
What do you mean
she's been taken?

361
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,477
I went to her house.
Someone had smashed the window.

362
00:19:22,512 --> 00:19:23,779
They broke in.
She's gone.

363
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:25,314
Have you called her?

364
00:19:25,348 --> 00:19:27,382
Fuckin' dozen times, no answer.

365
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,685
It's Yates.
He's still in Miami.

366
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:31,053
I shoulda killed him already.

367
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,621
- I wanna help you.
- No.

368
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,489
- Dexter--
- Deb, you tried helping me

369
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:36,158
once before, it didn't
work out so well.

370
00:19:36,192 --> 00:19:37,492
That was about killing someone.

371
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:39,228
- This is about saving someone.
- It's dangerous.

372
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,129
I fuckin' know it's dangerous.

373
00:19:41,164 --> 00:19:43,432
Vogel's life is at stake.

374
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,000
You can hate me
for the rest of your life,

375
00:19:45,034 --> 00:19:46,535
but for right now can we
just set that aside

376
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:47,769
until we know that she's okay?

377
00:19:47,804 --> 00:19:50,772
I don't hate you.

378
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,016
Why'd you save me?

379
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:03,285
Why didn't you let me drown?

380
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,128
I saw the car going underwater.

381
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,034
I knew you were gonna die.

382
00:20:22,205 --> 00:20:25,140
I couldn't imagine my life
without you in it.

383
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:40,088
So now what--everything
just goes back to normal?

384
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:44,660
It was never normal.

385
00:20:44,694 --> 00:20:45,961
I need to do this.

386
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,497
I-I really need to help.

387
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:57,873
We need to find Vogel.

388
00:21:05,581 --> 00:21:07,449
We should bring the police
in on this.

389
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,684
They're already doing
everything they can

390
00:21:08,718 --> 00:21:11,520
to find Yates.

391
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:14,790
This is his work log.

392
00:21:14,824 --> 00:21:17,059
These are all the houses
he's worked in,

393
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:19,728
some of which might be empty
during the summer.

394
00:21:19,762 --> 00:21:22,130
That's the perfect place
to go with a hostage.

395
00:21:22,165 --> 00:21:24,032
That is a lot of places
to search, Dexter.

396
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,834
We need Miami Metro's help.

397
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,502
They'll be helping us.

398
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:29,738
They just won't know it.

399
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,974
Just plot those places
out on a map.

400
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:34,276
Don't do anything on your own.

401
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,612
You still don't trust me,
do you?

402
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:40,615
I don't want you hurt.

403
00:21:44,487 --> 00:21:45,620
Uhh!

404
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:51,927
So who's the guy?

405
00:21:51,961 --> 00:21:54,863
What guy?

406
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,332
A.J., this is very serious,
what you're doing.

407
00:21:57,367 --> 00:22:01,236
The guy who
broke into my house!

408
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,371
He's a friend of mine.

409
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:04,806
I don't like him in my house,

410
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,408
going through my things.

411
00:22:06,442 --> 00:22:07,609
No. I understand.

412
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:10,612
Good!

413
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:19,755
A.J., I think I know
what this is about.

414
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:22,057
It's your surgery.
You blame me.

415
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:23,191
What?

416
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:26,895
This little thing?
No!

417
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,564
I liked having my skull
sawed open,

418
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,533
and a chunk of my brain
carved out.

419
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,634
Who wouldn't?

420
00:22:32,668 --> 00:22:34,503
Well, you had a lesion

421
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:36,371
on the limbic area
of your brain.

422
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:39,274
And I thought
it was causing your--

423
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:42,277
your violent episodes.

424
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:46,348
I-I was only trying
to make you better.

425
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,683
Well, it worked really well,
didn't it?

426
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:52,754
You're a hell of a doctor!

427
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:56,525
I only wanted
what was best for you.

428
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,593
I still do.

429
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:02,431
That's why you sent
your friend after me.

430
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,133
I asked him to protect me.
I had no choice.

431
00:23:05,168 --> 00:23:07,569
You should've just
left me alone.

432
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:10,372
I will. I will.

433
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:12,140
You made your point.

434
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:15,077
There's no reason for us
to go any further.

435
00:23:15,111 --> 00:23:17,446
If you do, you'll--
you'll be caught

436
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:20,215
and you'll go to jail and--
or worse.

437
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:21,850
My friend is looking for you.

438
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,819
Ah!

439
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:25,821
Good!

440
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:27,155
I can't wait till he finds me.

441
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,257
No, no!

442
00:23:32,795 --> 00:23:34,356
The way I hear it,
the sergeant spot's

443
00:23:34,363 --> 00:23:37,432
just going to be
between you and me.

444
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:38,867
Is that so?

445
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:40,168
Not gonna ruin our friendship

446
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:41,837
when one of us gets it
and the other doesn't?

447
00:23:41,871 --> 00:23:45,073
I didn't know
we had a friendship.

448
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:46,741
Excuse me.

449
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:48,043
Miami Metro Homicide.

450
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:49,945
Don't worry,
you're not in trouble.

451
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:51,813
- What's your name?
- Armando.

452
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,915
I'm Detective Quinn.
This is Detective Miller.

453
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,884
There was a murder down here
a few days ago.

454
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:57,252
Take a look at this.

455
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:59,020
We were wondering
if you saw that man

456
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:02,858
around this time of day,
early afternoon.

457
00:24:02,892 --> 00:24:04,626
<i>Si,</i> I saw him.

458
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,961
Can you point him out to me?

459
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:08,597
Uh, this one.

460
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:10,332
Are you sure?

461
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,134
Yes, uh, he drive a Porsche,

462
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,902
and you don't see too many
Porsches around here.

463
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:15,337
Would you be willing
to come down to the station

464
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,140
and give a statement that
that's the guy you saw?

465
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:20,308
I can come by later today.

466
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:22,210
Yeah, that's fine.

467
00:24:22,245 --> 00:24:24,846
Here. Ask for me
at the front desk.

468
00:24:26,015 --> 00:24:28,783
Great. Wanna get
his information?

469
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,787
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

470
00:24:32,822 --> 00:24:34,789
Just got an eyewitness to place

471
00:24:34,824 --> 00:24:37,159
Zach Hamilton at Norma Rivera's

472
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:38,727
around the time of her killing.

473
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:40,128
The son?

474
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:41,997
I wasn't expecting that.

475
00:24:42,031 --> 00:24:43,999
Me neither.

476
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:45,567
Mm. I'll let Matthews know.

477
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:47,402
He's been all over me
about this case.

478
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:49,204
- All right, bye.
- All right.

479
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:53,642
This is awkward, isn't it?

480
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:59,181
Uh, why'd you decide
to look me up now?

481
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:02,150
Um, well, you know,
partly because

482
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:04,886
I moved down here from
St. Augustine for school.

483
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:08,657
Oh, and... what's
the other part?

484
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:11,326
My mom passed recently.

485
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,162
So, uh, it's just me now.

486
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:17,098
Oh, I'm sorry to--
I'm sorry to hear that.

487
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,400
Thanks.

488
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,839
Uh, your mom never...
married?

489
00:25:24,874 --> 00:25:27,209
No, it was always
just the two of us.

490
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:30,478
So now that she's gone, I guess

491
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:32,514
I've been feeling
kind of alone.

492
00:25:32,548 --> 00:25:34,950
Well, I'm glad you reached out.

493
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:38,119
Me too.

494
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:39,221
What about you?

495
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:41,089
Are you still single?

496
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,490
Yep.

497
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:44,025
Where do you live?

498
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,328
Oh, I've got a house
down in Coconut Grove.

499
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,363
Fancy.

500
00:25:48,397 --> 00:25:50,632
Are you, like, Mr. Rich Guy?

501
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:53,768
Well, uh--

502
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,238
I bet you drive a Ferrari.

503
00:25:56,272 --> 00:25:58,039
Masook, what can I get for you?

504
00:25:58,074 --> 00:26:00,141
Hey, Marty, um,
just a coffee for me.

505
00:26:00,176 --> 00:26:02,677
And, uh, Niki?

506
00:26:02,712 --> 00:26:05,447
Um, can I have
a double cappuccino

507
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,148
and a blueberry muffin?

508
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:10,085
And a veggie burrito
to go, please.

509
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,157
I left my bag in the car.

510
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,792
I'm sorry.
Can you get this one?

511
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:19,761
- Yeah, no, no--
- I'll get the next one.

512
00:26:19,795 --> 00:26:21,796
No problem, my treat.

513
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,064
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

514
00:26:23,099 --> 00:26:26,368
Oh, hey, uh, can you add
cheese to my burrito?

515
00:26:26,402 --> 00:26:28,870
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

516
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,041
Yates has installed cable
and Internet

517
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:35,076
from one end of Miami
to the other.

518
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:36,811
Even if I only look at homes
he worked on

519
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,880
in the past two weeks,
it'll still take days

520
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:42,150
to figure out
which homes are vacant--

521
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,119
if he's even in one of them.

522
00:26:44,153 --> 00:26:46,655
And with Vogel
being held by Yates,

523
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:50,692
doing what he does--

524
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:53,928
Batista should be done looking
into Yates's money trail.

525
00:26:53,963 --> 00:26:57,365
Time to see if Miami Metro
can help me narrow this down.

526
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,009
Yeah, I'm on hold.
Come in.

527
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,612
Just checking to see how
your end of the hunt's going.

528
00:27:10,646 --> 00:27:12,981
Well, just got
his credit history.

529
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:14,516
He hasn't used his charge cards

530
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,951
in the last three days,
so that trail is cold.

531
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:19,521
- So he's using cash?
- Yeah.

532
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,789
He's on the run.

533
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:22,457
He'd probably have to be
withdrawing his funds

534
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:24,793
from his bank or ATM.

535
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:26,561
Yeah, well, I got a judge
to expedite

536
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:27,835
a warrant on his bank accounts.

537
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,164
I'm on hold with the bank now.

538
00:27:29,198 --> 00:27:30,865
Lieutenant Batista,
thank you so much for holding.

539
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,400
The withdrawals
were in Morningside Park.

540
00:27:32,435 --> 00:27:33,768
Would you like me
to fax the receipts to you?

541
00:27:33,803 --> 00:27:34,924
- That would be fine.
- Okay.

542
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:36,204
- Okay.
- Thank you.

543
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:38,740
- Bye.
- Good news?

544
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:41,710
Yates hit up an ATM
near Morningside Park

545
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:43,978
two times in the last
couple of days.

546
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:45,980
So he could be holed up
in that area.

547
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:47,315
Yeah, we'll get
some unis out there.

548
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,117
If he shows his face,
we'll get him.

549
00:27:49,151 --> 00:27:52,120
Yeah, we'll get him.

550
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:55,957
No, it's a clusterfuck.

551
00:27:55,991 --> 00:27:57,425
Just a couple hours ago,
we had a witness

552
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,893
that placed Zach
at the murder scene

553
00:27:58,928 --> 00:28:00,049
within the time of her death.

554
00:28:00,062 --> 00:28:01,296
Now, we bring him in
for questioning,

555
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,931
and suddenly
he can't remember anything.

556
00:28:02,965 --> 00:28:05,033
Not unusual for a witness
to change his mind.

557
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:06,668
Yeah, but I think
someone paid him off.

558
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:07,902
Rich parents like Zach has,

559
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,577
it's not hard to put
two and two together.

560
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,473
Mm. You have
any other witnesses

561
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:13,108
that can put Zach at the scene?

562
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:15,543
No. But I will bring that kid
in for questioning,

563
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:17,312
and I will get a confession
out of him.

564
00:28:17,346 --> 00:28:18,446
Waste of time.

565
00:28:18,481 --> 00:28:19,714
You have nothing to go on,

566
00:28:19,749 --> 00:28:21,449
and his lawyers won't let him
say a word.

567
00:28:21,484 --> 00:28:23,418
- He killed her.
- You don't know that.

568
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,453
You're only witness recanted.

569
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:27,455
You have no case.

570
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,658
Now, look, you find
something more concrete,

571
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:32,360
you'll have my full backing.

572
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:34,696
But until then,
leave the kid alone.

573
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:38,400
No reason to make enemies
unless we really have to,

574
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,934
especially when
there are people

575
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,803
trying to move up to sergeant.

576
00:28:41,837 --> 00:28:43,872
Capiche?

577
00:28:43,906 --> 00:28:46,040
Yeah.

578
00:28:50,513 --> 00:28:51,746
So what exactly
are we looking for

579
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:53,815
in the Morningside Park area?

580
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:55,083
That's a good question.

581
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:56,184
We need to start figuring out

582
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:57,452
what kind of buildings
these are,

583
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,254
if any apartments or condos
or businesses

584
00:28:59,288 --> 00:29:01,189
can be scratched off the list.

585
00:29:01,223 --> 00:29:03,525
- And why are we--
- I--

586
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:05,026
I know, got it.

587
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,828
Top secret shit between
you and your brother.

588
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:09,164
Understood.

589
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:11,733
Look at that, a paying client.

590
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:13,201
- I guess I should go and--
- Oh, I'm sor--

591
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:14,803
that's a friend of mine.

592
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,305
Good. Hope he needs
a favor.

593
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:20,775
Masuka, what's up?

594
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,010
I pass by here all the time.

595
00:29:22,044 --> 00:29:26,080
I figured I'd finally
see where you work.

596
00:29:26,115 --> 00:29:28,082
This is it.

597
00:29:28,117 --> 00:29:30,285
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

598
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:33,555
Can we go somewhere
more private to talk?

599
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:36,224
- Sure.
- Okay.

600
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,160
What's up?

601
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,095
I wanna hire you to do

602
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:43,832
a background check on someone.

603
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,100
You do background checks
all the time at Miami Metro.

604
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:47,469
Why would you
waste your money on me?

605
00:29:47,503 --> 00:29:48,736
Uh, I know, right.

606
00:29:48,771 --> 00:29:52,006
It's more of
a personal situation.

607
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:54,075
Right.

608
00:29:54,109 --> 00:29:58,146
Who are we stalking?

609
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,281
It's, uh, a family member.

610
00:30:00,316 --> 00:30:01,483
Ooh, gotta be careful.

611
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:03,418
Don't always wanna know
everything about family.

612
00:30:03,452 --> 00:30:05,653
Yeah, well, I really need this.

613
00:30:05,688 --> 00:30:07,422
All right.
Give me a name.

614
00:30:07,456 --> 00:30:10,525
Niki Walters.

615
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,028
Who is it?
A cousin?

616
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,164
Daughter.

617
00:30:16,198 --> 00:30:17,899
I know, right?

618
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:19,601
I donated sperm
back in college.

619
00:30:19,635 --> 00:30:22,103
I've got a 20-year-old
daughter.

620
00:30:22,137 --> 00:30:23,671
She just showed up
out of the blue.

621
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:27,141
Wow, that's fucking weird.

622
00:30:27,176 --> 00:30:29,410
I mean, she seems
really nice, you know?

623
00:30:29,445 --> 00:30:34,916
She's smart. She's pretty.
Seems normal.

624
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,952
But I keep asking myself,
"What's the catch?"

625
00:30:37,987 --> 00:30:40,989
Maybe she just wants
to get to know you.

626
00:30:41,023 --> 00:30:42,624
Maybe.

627
00:30:42,658 --> 00:30:46,294
Or maybe she saw an easy mark
to hit up for money.

628
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:48,963
You really think
she's here to rip you off?

629
00:30:48,998 --> 00:30:53,268
I don't know what to think.

630
00:30:53,302 --> 00:30:55,303
I mean, I've got no family
except for my parents.

631
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,838
And they're off, retired,

632
00:30:56,872 --> 00:30:59,574
living <i>la vida loca</i> in Tampa.

633
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,910
So it's just me.

634
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:05,480
And now Niki shows up.

635
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:09,851
I mean, I like the idea
of having a daughter,

636
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:11,786
family, right?

637
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,223
But if she's here
just for my money--

638
00:31:15,257 --> 00:31:18,092
I'm sure it's fine.

639
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:21,563
And either way,
it's--

640
00:31:21,597 --> 00:31:24,566
it's really nice
to have family.

641
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,002
Trust me.

642
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:29,557
You'll be discrete
about this, right?

643
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:30,805
I don't want her to know

644
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:31,973
that I'm looking into her
like this.

645
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:34,976
She'll never know
anything about it.

646
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,313
Yes, please.

647
00:31:38,347 --> 00:31:40,815
Oh, yeah.

648
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:43,151
- Hey.
- Hey.

649
00:31:43,185 --> 00:31:44,319
You want a beer?

650
00:31:44,353 --> 00:31:46,220
You remember Cassie, right?

651
00:31:46,255 --> 00:31:48,323
Cassie, yeah.
New neighbor, hi.

652
00:31:48,357 --> 00:31:52,760
Yes, it's good--
it's good to meet you again.

653
00:31:52,795 --> 00:31:54,829
Jamie, can I talk to you
for a sec?

654
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:56,030
Sure.

655
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:59,000
Joey, keep stirring that.

656
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,670
What are they doing
in my apartment?

657
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,105
Did you forget we had plans?

658
00:32:04,139 --> 00:32:06,908
- Plans?
- Dinner, remember?

659
00:32:06,942 --> 00:32:08,209
Right.

660
00:32:08,243 --> 00:32:09,711
Yeah, I figured we'd
make it a double date.

661
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:11,379
Less awkward this way.

662
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:15,316
I'm gonna have to reschedule.

663
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,918
Uh, excuse me just a sec.

664
00:32:16,952 --> 00:32:18,553
Joey, keep stirring that.

665
00:32:18,587 --> 00:32:19,854
I'm stirrin' it!

666
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:26,394
Dexter.

667
00:32:26,428 --> 00:32:28,529
You can't do this.

668
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:29,864
Do what?

669
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:32,000
I went out of my way
to set this up for you.

670
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:33,601
I made <i>platanos fritos,</i>
<i>chicharrones.</i>

671
00:32:33,636 --> 00:32:35,269
I planned this whole night
for you.

672
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:36,671
I'm sorry.
Something came up.

673
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,941
No. No, you do this to me
all the time.

674
00:32:39,975 --> 00:32:41,609
Okay, and I don't mind,
I really don't.

675
00:32:41,644 --> 00:32:43,444
But I invited Cassie and Joey.

676
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:44,579
You can't be rude to them.

677
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,782
Jamie, really, I have to go.

678
00:32:47,816 --> 00:32:50,018
If you even try
to walk out that door,

679
00:32:50,052 --> 00:32:52,053
Dexter, I will leave.

680
00:32:52,087 --> 00:32:54,188
And you will be stuck here
with Harrison all night long.

681
00:32:54,223 --> 00:32:56,824
- Jamie--
- This is for your own good.

682
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:58,660
You haven't gone out
with anyone since Hannah.

683
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:00,161
You stay for dinner.

684
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:01,929
And when we're done,
I will stay with Harrison

685
00:33:01,964 --> 00:33:05,233
so you can go do whatever it is
you have to do.

686
00:33:08,103 --> 00:33:11,706
Serial killer bested
by 100-pound nanny.

687
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,907
Born and raised.

688
00:33:14,877 --> 00:33:17,679
Dexter's lived in Miami
his whole life.

689
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:19,814
Oh.

690
00:33:19,848 --> 00:33:23,451
I'm gonna get some more wine.

691
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:24,952
Deb.

692
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:26,220
I've got 12 potential homes

693
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:27,622
Yates could be using
as a hideout.

694
00:33:27,656 --> 00:33:29,323
Shit. I've got seven.

695
00:33:29,358 --> 00:33:31,959
- That's a lot to cover.
- Let's go.

696
00:33:31,994 --> 00:33:34,996
I'll call you back
in five minutes.

697
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,130
So another "S."

698
00:33:36,165 --> 00:33:37,131
Yeah, to you.

699
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:38,866
<i>Saving Private Ryan.</i>

700
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:43,171
I love blunt things
in my mouth.

701
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:45,273
Oh, jeez...

702
00:33:45,307 --> 00:33:46,708
Excuse me.

703
00:33:46,742 --> 00:33:48,910
Hey. Want some help
opening the wine?

704
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,512
Actually, this is
a little embarrassing,

705
00:33:51,547 --> 00:33:53,147
but I kind of need to leave.

706
00:33:53,182 --> 00:33:55,817
Oh, work?
I get it.

707
00:33:55,851 --> 00:33:57,985
When I worked in Finance,
I was at it 24/7 too.

708
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,855
Yeah. 24/7.

709
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:03,157
But the thing is,
Jamie's put a lot of time

710
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:04,459
into this whole thing.

711
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:06,461
Right, you don't wanna
piss off the nanny.

712
00:34:06,495 --> 00:34:08,362
Look, um, go.

713
00:34:08,397 --> 00:34:12,133
I'll take care of Jamie.
We'll be fine.

714
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:13,835
Maybe we could reschedule?

715
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:15,636
Yeah. I'd like that.

716
00:34:15,671 --> 00:34:18,606
- Perfect.
- Okay.

717
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,110
Jamie, listen, I'm really sorry
to be the party pooper,

718
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:23,411
but I've got an early morning.

719
00:34:23,445 --> 00:34:24,679
Do you mind
if I call it a night?

720
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:26,514
Yeah, turns out
I have to take off too.

721
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:28,750
Thanks for watching Harrison.

722
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:31,119
I'm sleepy.

723
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:33,087
I know you went to
so much trouble.

724
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:40,762
What the fuck took you so long?

725
00:34:40,796 --> 00:34:42,663
It's a long story.

726
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,999
We have 19 houses
we have to look into.

727
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:47,101
At night?
Fuck me.

728
00:34:47,136 --> 00:34:49,103
How are we even gonna see
if Vogel and Yates

729
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:50,772
are in a house, if they're even

730
00:34:50,806 --> 00:34:52,367
holed up in one of these
fuckin' places?

731
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:54,308
What if they're in his van
and he's already killed her?

732
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:55,643
He hasn't. She's fine.

733
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,478
He keeps his women alive
for weeks.

734
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:59,180
We'll find her.

735
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:01,315
Yeah, we will.
We have to.

736
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,685
I'll pick you up
in five minutes.

737
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,324
We'll find her.

738
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,394
Stay still--

739
00:35:13,428 --> 00:35:16,397
unless you want me
to restrain you.

740
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,013
You're not angry
with me, A.J.

741
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,281
You're angry with her.

742
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,283
Shut up.

743
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:38,286
And you have every right to be.

744
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,424
Your--your mother abused you
horribly, beat you.

745
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,059
Probably caused the lesion.

746
00:35:45,093 --> 00:35:46,794
Don't talk about her.

747
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:48,496
But I understand, A.J.

748
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:53,034
I understand the terror
you felt.

749
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:57,438
She hit you, slapped you.

750
00:35:57,472 --> 00:36:00,908
You'd find a safe place
under the bed.

751
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:04,946
And she'd look for you, raging.

752
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,216
And you'd curl up under there,

753
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,120
looking out, waiting.

754
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,592
She'd pace back and forth

755
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:19,961
- in front of the bed.
- Yes.

756
00:36:19,995 --> 00:36:23,164
Shoes clacking.

757
00:36:23,198 --> 00:36:26,868
Yeah.

758
00:36:26,902 --> 00:36:30,504
I feel the panic rising.

759
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:34,308
The pain you knew awaited.

760
00:36:46,889 --> 00:36:49,857
Don't say another fucking word.

761
00:36:53,262 --> 00:36:54,695
No, no.

762
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,933
Now, you can take the pain
and live a little longer.

763
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,935
Or you can stop struggling,

764
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,971
and I'll kill you right now.

765
00:37:06,508 --> 00:37:09,877
Good.

766
00:37:11,546 --> 00:37:15,149
So...

767
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:19,220
which little piggy
won't be making it to market?

768
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,094
Albert, stop it!

769
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:28,195
Don't call me that.

770
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,897
Only my mother called me that.

771
00:37:29,932 --> 00:37:33,768
- Stop that, Albert, now.
- No.

772
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:35,736
Don't you talk back to me,
you little shit!

773
00:37:35,771 --> 00:37:37,071
I'm not afraid of you.

774
00:37:37,105 --> 00:37:40,708
All you ever do
is disappoint me.

775
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:09,003
Enough!

776
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:15,009
Stay.

777
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,888
Don't know this number.

778
00:39:02,624 --> 00:39:04,959
Not this house.

779
00:39:09,197 --> 00:39:12,466
Morgan.

780
00:39:12,501 --> 00:39:13,834
Here.

781
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:18,372
Let me help you with that cut.

782
00:39:18,407 --> 00:39:19,840
You shouldn't call me Albert.

783
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,976
My name is A.J.

784
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,444
I'm sorry.

785
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:24,879
It's Vogel.
She's alive.

786
00:39:24,913 --> 00:39:26,013
What?

787
00:39:26,048 --> 00:39:28,182
She is with Yates.
She called me.

788
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:29,683
She left her phone out
or something.

789
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:31,185
- Give me that.
- Oh, my God.

790
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:33,187
You're still bleeding.

791
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:35,556
It's local.
You think Elway can trace this?

792
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,725
I don't know.
I can fuckin' ask him.

793
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,994
Let me take care of you.

794
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:41,362
Hey, Deb, what's up?

795
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:42,997
Look, I don't even
wanna explain to you

796
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:44,432
why I can't go
through the police,

797
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,900
and I know
it's illegal as hell,

798
00:39:45,934 --> 00:39:48,936
but I need you to trace
a number for me.

799
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:52,006
What's the number?

800
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,474
You're no different than mom.

801
00:39:53,508 --> 00:39:55,676
Yes, I am.
I understand--

802
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,812
How long is this gonna take?

803
00:39:57,846 --> 00:39:59,513
Fuck if I know.

804
00:39:59,548 --> 00:40:00,848
You're just like her
and all women.

805
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:03,451
- What if he kills her?
- Don't--

806
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:06,120
I thought you said it takes,
like, a week for him--

807
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:10,091
I know what I said.

808
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:11,659
Let's not think like this.

809
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:13,561
You had a horrible childhood.

810
00:40:15,197 --> 00:40:16,530
You don't have
to life your life

811
00:40:16,565 --> 00:40:18,299
with the burden of your past.

812
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,400
Yeah?

813
00:40:19,434 --> 00:40:22,203
157 Montgomery.

814
00:40:22,237 --> 00:40:24,338
You're a fuckin' saint.
Thank you.

815
00:40:24,372 --> 00:40:27,541
157 Montgomery.
You know where that is?

816
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:33,747
You shouldn't have hit me.

817
00:40:33,782 --> 00:40:35,416
She hit him?

818
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,385
I was scared.

819
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,921
I can still help you.

820
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:42,356
You don't have
to be angry at me.

821
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,692
- You can't help me.
- I can.

822
00:40:44,726 --> 00:40:47,561
I understand what
you've been through.

823
00:40:47,596 --> 00:40:49,763
No child should ever
have to hide

824
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:54,735
under a bed from a parent.

825
00:40:54,769 --> 00:40:57,938
You sought connection
with her, hmm?

826
00:40:57,973 --> 00:41:00,975
And all she gave you was pain.

827
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:06,313
What--what you do
with your women,

828
00:41:06,348 --> 00:41:10,050
it's a search
for that same connection

829
00:41:10,085 --> 00:41:14,622
that you never got
from your mother.

830
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:16,557
But what we have here now,

831
00:41:16,591 --> 00:41:19,326
in this moment, you and I?

832
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:24,231
This is real human connection.

833
00:41:24,266 --> 00:41:26,133
What you have
with your victims,

834
00:41:26,168 --> 00:41:28,969
that only pales in comparison.

835
00:41:29,004 --> 00:41:31,939
Do you understand?

836
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:37,311
You poor, poor boy.

837
00:41:37,345 --> 00:41:40,581
All you want is to belong,
don't you?

838
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:43,417
I can help you.

839
00:41:43,451 --> 00:41:46,353
I can, trust me.

840
00:41:55,363 --> 00:41:58,499
- Oh, what did you do?
- I didn't.

841
00:41:58,533 --> 00:42:00,167
Who did you call? Is this
your little fucking friend?

842
00:42:00,202 --> 00:42:02,136
Dexter, Dexter!

843
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,771
Yeah, you call him.

844
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:06,707
Fuck you, Dexter!

845
00:42:44,779 --> 00:42:46,046
Fuck.

846
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:48,749
- You okay?
- Yeah.

847
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:19,980
Oh, fucking Christ.

848
00:43:23,485 --> 00:43:25,085
Are you all right?

849
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,220
Yeah, I think so.

850
00:43:26,254 --> 00:43:28,255
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

851
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,492
No, thank--
thank you.

852
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,128
Where's Yates?

853
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:46,640
Let's get you out of here.

854
00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:49,643
Then we can find Yates.

855
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,794
Debra, are you okay?

856
00:44:06,828 --> 00:44:08,962
I'm good.

857
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:10,964
Really, I'm--I'm good.

858
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:12,199
Let's just get this cleaned up

859
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,802
and get out of here.

860
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:19,273
Brain cores.

861
00:44:19,307 --> 00:44:23,677
I'll dump them
with Yates's body.

862
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:27,214
So this--
so this is finally over.

863
00:44:27,248 --> 00:44:29,583
My tormentor is dead...

864
00:44:29,617 --> 00:44:32,853
thanks to you, Dexter.

865
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:34,188
And Deb.

866
00:44:34,222 --> 00:44:36,657
Yes. And Deb.

867
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:38,125
I'm glad to see that
the two of you

868
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,129
have managed to find your way
back to each other.

869
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:50,070
Well, the family
that kills together...

870
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,972
You're doing well, Debra.

871
00:44:52,006 --> 00:44:54,975
You're very resilient.

872
00:44:55,009 --> 00:44:56,643
We'll see.

873
00:44:56,678 --> 00:44:59,480
You are.

874
00:44:59,514 --> 00:45:01,915
And you never gave up on her.

875
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,684
I'm impressed.

876
00:45:03,718 --> 00:45:06,820
I know Harry would be too.

877
00:45:06,855 --> 00:45:09,723
He was always concerned that,
as you grew older,

878
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:14,495
you--you might drift apart.

879
00:45:14,529 --> 00:45:18,565
Well, we never really
had a choice.

880
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:22,336
If anyone really knew us,
they would run screaming.

881
00:45:26,775 --> 00:45:31,578
This is everything.

882
00:45:31,613 --> 00:45:35,616
Okay.

883
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,519
So is this it?

884
00:45:41,856 --> 00:45:44,224
A few days ago,
everything seemed hopeless

885
00:45:44,259 --> 00:45:46,460
between Deb and me.

886
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:50,764
But through Dr. Vogel
and Yates,

887
00:45:50,799 --> 00:45:55,102
I've got my sister back.

888
00:45:55,136 --> 00:45:59,039
Not like things were before...

889
00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:03,744
It's something different.

890
00:46:03,778 --> 00:46:06,513
But for now, it's enough.

00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:11,118
It's beautiful
out here, Dexter.

892
00:46:15,323 --> 00:46:17,391
I like it.

893
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:22,930
It's peaceful,
alone on the water.

894
00:46:25,934 --> 00:46:28,669
Tonight you brought us.

895
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,638
Yes. Why?

896
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:38,712
I wanted to be with family.
