2
00:01:46,994 --> 00:01:48,261
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:49,295
Oh, God.

4
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,296
Dexter, what the fuck?

5
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,931
Travis was here, he came at me.

6
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:53,800
When I thought
about everything he did,

7
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:55,701
I wanted him dead,
so I killed him.

8
00:01:55,736 --> 00:01:58,070
I have to call this in.

9
00:01:58,105 --> 00:01:59,138
Maybe we should
just get rid of the body.

10
00:01:59,173 --> 00:02:00,730
Gasoline, fire...

11
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,442
it'll erase any trace
that we were ever here.

12
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:05,812
I never wanted her
to go through this, Dex.

13
00:02:05,846 --> 00:02:07,747
Neither did I.

14
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,382
I found a blood slide

15
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:12,018
exactly like the ones
we found in Doakes' car.

16
00:02:12,052 --> 00:02:13,786
Bad people are still
going missing, and Doakes--

17
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:16,489
Was the Bay Harbor Butcher,
end of story.

18
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:18,157
I have to keep my secret safe.

19
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:22,128
Otherwise my life--her life--
will never be the same.

20
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:25,798
Are you a serial killer?

21
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:27,934
I only kill
certain kinds of people.

22
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,335
Oh, God.
Are you the Bay Harbor Butcher?

23
00:02:29,369 --> 00:02:31,871
Dad taught me.
He gave me a code.

24
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:33,506
Dad knew?

25
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,342
You're like a magnet.
Bad shit is gonna find you.

26
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:39,645
Dexter is
a blood spatter analyst,

27
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,581
and Doakes always thought there
was something off about Dexter.

28
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:43,749
What if Doakes was on to him?

29
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:47,019
The Bay Harbor Butcher.
Maria thinks it might be you.

30
00:02:47,054 --> 00:02:48,421
Me?

31
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:51,090
Hannah McKay.
She stabbed a woman five times.

32
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:54,193
All I can think about
is giving her what she deserves.

33
00:02:54,228 --> 00:02:57,296
Do what you gotta do.

34
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,166
Dexter...

35
00:03:02,286 --> 00:03:05,771
You're the only person I don't
have to hide anything from.

36
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:09,175
Maybe you understand me a little
better than I understand myself.

37
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,043
I love you.

38
00:03:11,078 --> 00:03:13,679
It's because
she's a serial killer?

39
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,648
I feel like if you love me
you'll accept this.

40
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:17,183
If I love you?
I'm in love with you!

41
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:18,851
Wha--

42
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:20,620
Debra's been in a car accident.

43
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:22,355
You poisoned Debra.

44
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,490
You were supposed to choose me.

45
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:25,491
She's my sister.

46
00:03:25,525 --> 00:03:27,360
Good-bye, Dexter.

47
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:29,462
Security footage
from before the fire department

48
00:03:29,496 --> 00:03:31,597
got the call
on the burning church.

49
00:03:31,632 --> 00:03:33,666
What were you doing there,
lieutenant?

50
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,134
Are we really that fucked?

51
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:37,370
If all she's got is that DVD,
I can handle this.

52
00:03:37,404 --> 00:03:38,604
LaGuerta's an innocent.

53
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:40,539
She doesn't even
begin to meet the code.

54
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:41,641
It's the only option.

55
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:44,143
Hector Estrada.

56
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:45,878
I was three years old
when you murdered my mother.

57
00:03:45,913 --> 00:03:47,847
You're Dicky Moser!

58
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,682
Dexter Moser.

59
00:03:49,716 --> 00:03:52,218
I have another kill
I have to do.

60
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,719
It's not so easy.

61
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:54,820
I can't let Deb go down
for what I've done.

62
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:56,389
Dexter, it's Deb.

63
00:03:56,423 --> 00:03:57,623
Whatever you're thinking
of doing, please don't do it.

64
00:03:57,658 --> 00:03:59,025
So what's the plan?

65
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:02,561
I used her gun to shoot
Estrada in his puncture wound.

66
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:04,563
I'll use Estrada's gun
to shoot LaGuerta.

67
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:06,465
- Deb--
- Dexter...

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,633
You shouldn't be here.

69
00:04:07,668 --> 00:04:10,903
Why--shouldn't I be here?

70
00:04:10,938 --> 00:04:13,973
Shoot him, Debra.

71
00:04:14,007 --> 00:04:17,043
You have to end this.
Shoot him.

72
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:18,511
Stop!

73
00:04:18,545 --> 00:04:22,548
Do it, Debra.
Shoot him.

74
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,016
Do it!
Shoot him!

75
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:27,086
This is not who you are.
You're a good person.

76
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,889
You're not like him.

77
00:04:29,923 --> 00:04:31,691
Put him down!

78
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:34,327
It's true.
Everything she said.

79
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:36,729
You're a good person.

80
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,902
Do what you gotta do.

81
00:04:42,936 --> 00:04:44,637
Dex--

82
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,809
There's nothing like a crisis
to help define who you are.

83
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:32,284
A better person would feel bad
about LaGuerta's death.

84
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:39,692
But the truth is
it solved all my problems.

85
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:43,462
It's gotten me back on track.

86
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:49,068
In the six months since,

87
00:05:49,102 --> 00:05:52,705
I've coached Harrison's
soccer team to a championship...

88
00:05:58,156 --> 00:06:00,638
gotten the bowling team
back together...

89
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,721
made some new friends.

90
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:21,763
I'm a survivor.

91
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:27,506
She chose a career
in law enforcement.

92
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,641
And I know for a fact

93
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:31,844
that she never regretted
one day of service.

94
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:35,081
It's a choice that
none of us take lightly.

95
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:37,383
Is Aunt Deb gonna be here?

96
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:38,684
Uh, I don't think so,

97
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:40,953
but we'll get together
with her real soon.

98
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:43,022
Maria was very important to me.

99
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:45,858
She was a good cop.
She was my boss.

100
00:06:45,892 --> 00:06:47,827
Very briefly my wife.

101
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:52,865
But mostly she was a friend.

102
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:56,602
I miss you, Maria.

103
00:06:56,636 --> 00:06:59,505
We all do.

104
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,850
Thank you, Lieutenant Batista.

105
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:13,486
At this time,
we would like to dedicate

106
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,055
this beautiful memorial
in her honor.

107
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,358
Ladies and gentlemen,
fellow officers,

108
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:23,295
I present you the Captain
Maria LaGuerta bench.

109
00:07:31,104 --> 00:07:33,572
Okay, well,
we're off to swim class.

110
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:35,374
- Say good-bye to daddy.
- Bye, daddy.

111
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:37,309
See you after work, Harrison.

112
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:39,645
Okay.

113
00:07:42,048 --> 00:07:44,717
A bench.
Why a bench?

114
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,454
She deserves more than a place
where people park their butts.

115
00:07:48,488 --> 00:07:49,588
It's a nice bench.

116
00:07:49,623 --> 00:07:53,125
It's concrete, very sturdy.

117
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,961
You can buy them at
the parking lot at Home Depot.

118
00:07:55,996 --> 00:07:57,296
I'm sorry.
Was that insensitive?

119
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,099
No, that's exactly my point.

120
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,802
This all feels so...
cold.

121
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:06,238
You're still hurting,
I can tell.

122
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:07,640
All right, look,

123
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:10,943
first of all, it's weird
when you try to speak Spanish.

124
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:12,444
Second of all,
don't ever touch me.

125
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:13,779
It's been six months,

126
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:15,748
and you're having
a tough time moving past this.

127
00:08:15,782 --> 00:08:17,550
How am I supposed
to move past this?

128
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:20,386
My dining room is filled
with boxes of her stuff.

129
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,254
He's right, you know?
It's been six months.

130
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:23,789
Maybe you should
just get rid of it.

131
00:08:23,823 --> 00:08:27,660
And then what?
She just disappears?

132
00:08:27,694 --> 00:08:28,661
Hey, uh, Dex,
I was kind of hoping

133
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:29,662
your sister would stop by.

134
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:31,964
Yeah, how is Deb?

135
00:08:31,998 --> 00:08:35,701
She really wanted to be here,
but she's working long hours.

136
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:37,336
She's better?

137
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,805
- Oh, yeah, she's great.
- That's good to know.

138
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,943
She took LaGuerta's death
kind of hard.

139
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,545
Even though they didn't
seem all that close.

140
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,215
There's no telling
how you're gonna react.

141
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:51,450
When Mike Anderson was killed,

142
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:54,286
I just wanted
to get away from all this.

143
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:57,556
It took Maria's death
to turn me back.

144
00:08:57,591 --> 00:09:01,493
It made me want to do nothing
but chase bad guys.

145
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:02,995
I can't tell you how many times

146
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:05,264
all I wanted to do
is what Deb did--

147
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,967
walk out of here at lunch
and never come back.

148
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:12,504
Yeah,
Deb can be impulsive sometimes.

149
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:14,006
Tell her to drop by sometime.

150
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,008
Place isn't the same
without her.

151
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:18,344
I mean, for a while I heard
from her every other day,

152
00:09:18,378 --> 00:09:19,712
asking for some favor.

153
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:24,049
But I haven't spoken to her
in a couple weeks now.

154
00:09:24,084 --> 00:09:25,951
Why is that?

155
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,786
She's out of town.

156
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:30,055
Right.
The keys.

157
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,757
No, Fort Lauderdale.

158
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,827
Right. Fort Lauderdale.

159
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:35,894
When she gets back,
let's set something up.

160
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:36,895
It'd be good to see her.

161
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,397
Yeah, it would.

162
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:42,468
I mean, I'll tell her.

163
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,442
It's Deb.
Leave a message.

164
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:53,345
The user's mailbox is full.

165
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,913
Hey, Vince.

166
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:55,981
Can you cover for me
this morning?

167
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,851
I always do.

168
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:01,687
Deb's working through this
in her own way.

169
00:10:01,721 --> 00:10:03,989
I just wish she'd talk to me
once in a while.

170
00:10:08,071 --> 00:10:10,729
Ooh...

171
00:10:11,765 --> 00:10:13,932
Supposed to be for both of us.

172
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:15,934
Mm...

173
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:20,272
I'm sorry.
I guess I got carried away.

174
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:21,707
Mm...

175
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:24,511
You're gonna have to share.

176
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:34,720
Mm.

177
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:37,956
Gotta take this.

178
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:39,858
- It's business.
- Okay.

179
00:10:39,893 --> 00:10:42,728
Yeah.

180
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:45,230
No, I'm not splitting it up.
All or nothing.

181
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:48,801
That is my best price.

182
00:10:48,835 --> 00:10:49,968
You've never worked
with me before,

183
00:10:50,003 --> 00:10:52,571
but you know it's a fair deal.

184
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:55,641
It's 11:47 A.M.

185
00:10:55,675 --> 00:10:58,143
You have till tomorrow
at this exact time.

186
00:10:58,178 --> 00:10:59,945
Fuckin' amateurs.

187
00:10:59,979 --> 00:11:01,747
What happened
to your normal guys?

188
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:04,216
I don't know.
They disappeared on me.

189
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,384
Funny thing, being a fence

190
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:06,785
doesn't seem to be
a long-term occupation.

191
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,688
What about this guy?
Can you trust him?

192
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,190
Can you trust anybody?

193
00:11:11,224 --> 00:11:15,461
Mm-mm.

194
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:17,129
Well, maybe if you want,
I can back you up.

195
00:11:17,163 --> 00:11:18,764
I don't want you
getting involved.

196
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,866
- Yeah, but I'm really--
- Debbie.

197
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,435
I appreciate it...

198
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,870
but I got it covered.

199
00:11:24,904 --> 00:11:27,806
What do you want to do today?

200
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:29,408
Preferably something
that involves you in a bikini.

201
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:31,977
Why don't we rent a boat?

202
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:33,912
Like a pontoon, little thing,

203
00:11:33,947 --> 00:11:35,748
we could go out,
relax on the water.

204
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:38,717
No, let's get something fast.
Let's get a speedboat.

205
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:40,686
We can buzz the cruise ships.

206
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,489
You like causing trouble,
don't you?

207
00:11:43,523 --> 00:11:46,091
I can't help it.

208
00:11:49,596 --> 00:11:51,130
It's funny how these things
work, isn't it?

209
00:11:51,164 --> 00:11:53,298
What do you mean?

210
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,633
When I met you,

211
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:55,634
I'd been sitting in that bar
for almost an hour.

212
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:58,137
I was about to leave.

213
00:11:58,171 --> 00:12:00,239
- Then you walked in.
- Yeah, I did.

214
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:03,409
It's funny
how something so simple

215
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:06,311
as you walking in the door
at the exact right moment

216
00:12:06,346 --> 00:12:09,948
can suddenly change everything.

217
00:12:09,983 --> 00:12:13,886
Yeah.

218
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,188
Mm...

219
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:37,758
What are you doing here,
Dexter?

220
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:39,359
She could be inside.

221
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:40,860
You know what
she's been going through.

222
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,414
She could've...

223
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:43,382
done something.

224
00:12:47,053 --> 00:12:48,403
Deb.

225
00:12:51,591 --> 00:12:54,660
Deb, you in here?

226
00:13:03,903 --> 00:13:06,104
She's not here, Dexter.

227
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,539
She asked you
to leave her alone.

228
00:13:07,574 --> 00:13:10,142
For how long?

229
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,211
I haven't talked to her
in over a month.

230
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:16,148
I haven't seen her
in two months.

231
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:17,483
She's disappeared.

232
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:19,618
She's disappeared
from you, Dexter.

233
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,820
And that's her choice.

234
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,956
What is this?

235
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,090
Xanax.

236
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:27,292
Paxil.

237
00:13:27,327 --> 00:13:28,293
Adderall.

238
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:29,294
More Xanax.

239
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,363
All from different doctors.

240
00:13:31,397 --> 00:13:33,632
And pot.

241
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,602
Great, she's mixing
all this shit.

242
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:37,936
I have to find her.

243
00:13:37,971 --> 00:13:40,606
Dexter, you're the problem,
not the solution.

244
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,009
The best thing you can do for
Debra is to stay away from her.

245
00:13:44,043 --> 00:13:45,511
I'm the only one
who knows what happened.

246
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:47,079
I'm the only one
who can help her.

247
00:13:47,113 --> 00:13:48,547
She needs me.

248
00:13:51,885 --> 00:13:53,685
It's Deb.
Leave a message.

249
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,420
The user's mailbox is full.

250
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,560
I have to find her.

251
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,374
- Hi.
- Hi.

252
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:16,408
Can I help you?

253
00:14:16,442 --> 00:14:19,177
- Yeah, I'm--
- Dexter Morgan.

254
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:23,048
- Elway. Nice place.
- Thank you.

255
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:24,583
Yeah, yeah, it's a big step up

256
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:26,952
from my Robbery desk
at Miami Metro, huh?

257
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:29,454
And it's a good change
for Deb as well.

258
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:31,423
Very smart of her,
making a move

259
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:32,958
to the private sector,
I'll tell you.

260
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:34,026
She here?

261
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,327
She is not.

262
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:37,996
You know when she'll be back?

263
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:39,665
Not a clue.

264
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:42,834
She's got a big problem
of disappearing on me.

265
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:45,537
What does that mean?

266
00:14:45,572 --> 00:14:47,339
Means she doesn't like to
check in when she's supposed to.

267
00:14:47,373 --> 00:14:50,309
When's the last
you heard from her?

268
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:52,878
Been a couple of weeks,
at least.

269
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:54,033
And that's normal for her?

270
00:14:54,047 --> 00:14:56,548
Of course not normal.
Debra Morgan.

271
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,150
There's no "normal" for her.

272
00:14:58,184 --> 00:14:59,718
But that was the deal
when I hired her.

273
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:00,953
She's her own agent,

274
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,854
she chooses the cases
she wants to work on,

275
00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:05,457
and she calls in
when she feels like it.

276
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:06,458
But--

277
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:08,961
But what?

278
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:13,966
She's never waited
two weeks to call me back.

279
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,404
What case is she working on?

280
00:15:15,524 --> 00:15:18,270
Some smash and grab.
Guy skipped out on bail.

281
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:20,430
Uh...

282
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,433
name is...

283
00:15:23,712 --> 00:15:24,679
Briggs.

284
00:15:24,713 --> 00:15:25,913
Andrew Briggs.

285
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:27,448
Skip tracing
and bounty hunting?

286
00:15:27,483 --> 00:15:28,723
Isn't that a little
beneath her?

287
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,084
Tell me about it.

288
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:31,085
I try to give her
bigger clients,

289
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,954
higher profile cases,

290
00:15:32,988 --> 00:15:35,923
but she seems to like
the down and dirty stuff.

291
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,758
Your sister's a bit
of a thrill seeker.

292
00:15:37,793 --> 00:15:39,787
- Really?
- It's easy money for her.

293
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:43,038
She gets a percentage of
everybody she brings in, so...

294
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,886
Well, what else can you
tell me about the case?

295
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,061
There's not much more to it.

296
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:48,369
You find the guy,
you bring him back.

297
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:49,604
If she brings
the jewelry back as well,

298
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:50,605
she gets a cut of it.

299
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,939
And that's all you know?

300
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:53,541
Like I said, she's not
big on checking in, so...

301
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:02,183
I gotta go.

302
00:16:02,217 --> 00:16:06,587
If you hear from her,
call me, all right?

303
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:16,097
Is this how
I'm going to find Deb?

304
00:16:16,131 --> 00:16:19,300
Dead and alone?

305
00:16:25,641 --> 00:16:27,942
- Are you looking at my ass?
- No.

306
00:16:27,976 --> 00:16:30,711
I mean, yes.
What size do you wear?

307
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:32,413
None of your damn business.

308
00:16:32,447 --> 00:16:34,048
It's just that I have
all of Maria's clothes,

309
00:16:34,082 --> 00:16:36,217
and I just thought maybe...

310
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:37,785
- Oh.
- Yeah, no, it's--

311
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:38,853
it's not your style.
I get it.

312
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:45,092
She was a very colorful woman.

313
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:47,228
Hey, what do we have?

314
00:16:47,262 --> 00:16:51,265
Robert Bailey,
42 years old, Miami resident.

315
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,235
Killed by a single
gunshot wound to the chest,

316
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,469
right above the heart.

317
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:58,940
Judging from the stippling
on the wound,

318
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,341
it looks like
the muzzle of the gun

319
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,009
was in contact with
the victim's chest when fired.

320
00:17:02,044 --> 00:17:03,377
Suicide?

321
00:17:03,412 --> 00:17:06,781
No, the victim was killed
elsewhere and dumped here.

322
00:17:11,553 --> 00:17:13,454
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

323
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:20,528
Parietal and occipital bone
sliced through.

324
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:22,496
Back of the cranium removed.

325
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:25,155
Okay, that's weird.

326
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,668
And...

327
00:17:27,703 --> 00:17:30,605
looks like a piece of it
has been scooped out,

328
00:17:30,639 --> 00:17:31,872
like with a melon baller.

329
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:34,675
- Just got weirder.
- We have a gun.

330
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,879
So someone shoots this guy,
cuts his head open,

331
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:40,281
and messes with his brain.

332
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,984
He takes the body
and the weapon

333
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:45,086
and brings them
all the way out here.

334
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,421
Why?

335
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:48,723
People are crazy.

336
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:51,959
I think we're done here.

337
00:17:51,994 --> 00:17:54,195
Okay, process the gun
for DNA and prints.

338
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:56,197
Uh, with the rain--

339
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:57,999
Yeah, do it anyway.

340
00:17:58,033 --> 00:18:01,969
Dexter, follow up on the body.
Will do.

341
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:19,020
- It's Deb. Leave a message.
- The user's mailbox is full.

342
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:23,224
Where the hell are you, Deb?

343
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:26,861
Andrew Briggs.

344
00:18:26,895 --> 00:18:29,530
The man Deb was looking for.

345
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:35,970
Clubbed a security guard
over the head,

346
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,405
then robbed a high-end
jewelry store.

347
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,410
Got away with over 1/2 million
in un-recovered merchandise.

348
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:46,847
Skipped on his bail,
been on the run ever since.

349
00:18:48,717 --> 00:18:50,384
Arrested three times
for assault.

350
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:52,853
Sent one guy to the hospital
with a broken jaw.

351
00:18:52,888 --> 00:18:56,524
This guy is dangerous.

352
00:18:58,927 --> 00:19:02,863
Did Debra get in over her head?

353
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,243
"Password"?

354
00:19:19,047 --> 00:19:21,716
Nope.

355
00:19:24,619 --> 00:19:27,722
"Fucking password."

356
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:32,326
Here we go.

357
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,681
All of her charges
for three weeks

358
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:35,863
have been in Fort Lauderdale.

359
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:39,033
And mostly at El Mercado
on East 4th Street.

360
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,235
She was there
yesterday afternoon.

361
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:45,606
I can be there in half an hour.

362
00:20:01,656 --> 00:20:03,991
That's the guy
she's supposed to bring in.

363
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,535
What kind of tequila you like?

364
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:16,904
Uh, the kind
that makes you fall down.

365
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:19,807
I'll see what I can do.

366
00:20:35,524 --> 00:20:38,626
What the fuck?

367
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,296
Deb, what's going on?

368
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,098
I'm working a case.
You should get the fuck out.

369
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,133
You found your guy.
Why haven't you brought him in?

370
00:20:46,168 --> 00:20:47,401
How the fuck do you know
what I'm doing?

371
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:50,571
I talked to Elway.

372
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:52,206
You talked to Elway?

373
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,607
When he said
you hadn't checked in,

374
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:54,842
I was scared
something happened.

375
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,610
I'm fine.
Get the fuck out.

376
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:58,512
Deb, you haven't
talked to me in weeks.

377
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:00,881
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

378
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,983
You completely missed
LaGuerta's memorial.

379
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:04,752
Jesus Christ, I wonder why.

380
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:07,888
And would you please erase
the messages on your phone?

381
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:09,089
No one has heard from you.

382
00:21:09,124 --> 00:21:11,258
Yeah, I'm fucking
getting close to Briggs

383
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:14,461
so that I can get the jewelry
before he fences it, all right?

384
00:21:14,496 --> 00:21:16,330
I'm a professional
working a case.

385
00:21:16,364 --> 00:21:17,865
Why don't you get the fuck
outta here before you ruin it?

386
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:19,266
Are you having sex
with that guy?

387
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:21,969
What the fuck?

388
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:24,138
My life is
none of your business.

389
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:29,977
Go.

390
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:31,378
No, I'm not leaving.

391
00:21:31,413 --> 00:21:33,881
Fuck you.

392
00:21:33,915 --> 00:21:36,984
Do you wanna know why I'm not
returning your phone calls?

393
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:38,853
'Cause I don't
wanna talk to you.

394
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:41,989
And I really don't
wanna fuckin' see you.

395
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:44,625
- Why?
- Why?

396
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:47,428
Um...

397
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:48,796
because you made me compromise

398
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,865
everything about myself
that I care about.

399
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:55,870
And I hate you for it.

400
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:57,471
No, you don't.

401
00:21:57,505 --> 00:22:01,342
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

402
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,284
Who's this guy?

403
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:11,552
Just some loser.

404
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:15,189
Is there a problem?

405
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:17,358
Let's go.

406
00:22:28,403 --> 00:22:29,670
She doesn't hate me.
She's messed up.

407
00:22:29,704 --> 00:22:31,138
She doesn't know
what she's doing.

408
00:22:31,172 --> 00:22:32,706
It's none
of your business, Dex.

409
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:36,710
She's using this job
as a way to escape.

410
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:38,245
She can't deal
with everything that's happened,

411
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,680
she's lost, dad.

412
00:22:39,714 --> 00:22:41,682
You've done this to her.
Don't make it worse.

413
00:22:41,716 --> 00:22:43,150
Leave her alone.

414
00:22:43,184 --> 00:22:45,352
Motherfucker cut me off.

415
00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:48,889
Dexter, what're you doing?

416
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,830
Hey, what's going on?

417
00:22:56,865 --> 00:22:58,399
You cut me off.

418
00:22:58,433 --> 00:23:02,503
I'm sorry.
I didn't--

419
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:15,082
You lost control
out there, Dexter.

420
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:17,184
He knows what he did.

421
00:23:17,218 --> 00:23:19,553
Go home, son.

422
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:31,365
Right there...
Ah...

423
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:33,200
Stop.

424
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:36,470
Don't stop, don't stop.

425
00:23:36,504 --> 00:23:38,706
- Don't stop.
- Jamie, I'm home.

426
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,307
Oh, God--you stopped.

427
00:23:40,342 --> 00:23:43,010
- Someone just came in.
- It's just Angel.

428
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:45,746
- Yeah, what?
- What?

429
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,415
I'm sorry, I can't have sex
with my lieutenant 20 feet away.

430
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:49,984
I'm not having a problem.

431
00:23:50,018 --> 00:23:52,052
Yeah, that's because you're,
like, fucking superhuman.

432
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:53,654
Oh, come on.

433
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:55,122
Joey,

434
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:57,358
the chance that someone might
find out our little secret...

435
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:58,692
Yeah, I know, babe,
it's not gonna happen.

436
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:00,561
- Makes it even more fun.
- Not gonna happen.

437
00:24:04,366 --> 00:24:07,101
Look, if you come to my place
tomorrow morning,

438
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:08,435
we can finish
where we left off, right?

439
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,904
I can't, I have to be
at Dexter's by 7:00.

440
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:15,542
What?

441
00:24:15,577 --> 00:24:18,579
- Fuck.
- Mm.

442
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:20,214
Do me a favor.

443
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:22,649
Uh, distract him so I can
go out the side door, okay?

444
00:24:22,684 --> 00:24:24,218
How am I supposed to do that?

445
00:24:24,252 --> 00:24:26,820
Throw some fucking
pork rinds on the floor.

446
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:27,821
You owe me.

447
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:31,859
Hey.

448
00:24:31,893 --> 00:24:34,061
You're all sweaty.

449
00:24:34,095 --> 00:24:35,529
Uh, yeah.

450
00:24:35,563 --> 00:24:38,065
It's good
that you're working out.

451
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:41,068
Yeah, just doing
a little cardio.

452
00:24:41,102 --> 00:24:43,904
What're you gonna do
with Maria's stuff?

453
00:24:43,938 --> 00:24:46,640
Don't worry,
it'll all be gone by tomorrow.

454
00:24:46,674 --> 00:24:48,042
Where?

455
00:24:48,076 --> 00:24:50,844
Charity workers are coming in
first thing in the morning.

456
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:51,912
Mm.

457
00:24:51,946 --> 00:24:53,747
Feels sad, though.

458
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:58,318
An entire life just packed up
in a bunch of boxes.

459
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,990
You know, maybe...

460
00:25:03,024 --> 00:25:05,993
you should pick out
some things to keep.

461
00:25:06,027 --> 00:25:07,127
Ah...

462
00:25:07,162 --> 00:25:08,442
Come on.
I think it'll be good.

463
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:10,306
You're right.
You're right.

464
00:25:17,806 --> 00:25:19,239
Warrants...

465
00:25:19,274 --> 00:25:24,244
to trace Dexter's
and Deb's phone.

466
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,148
Right to the end,
she couldn't let it go.

467
00:25:28,183 --> 00:25:30,050
Tracking down Estrada
by herself--

468
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:32,152
that's what got her killed.

469
00:25:32,187 --> 00:25:34,288
Yeah, well,
that's just who she was, Angel.

470
00:25:34,322 --> 00:25:37,758
- Yeah.
- A cop.

471
00:25:42,964 --> 00:25:46,133
That's who she was.

472
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:55,943
Deb should be up there
leading this briefing.

473
00:25:55,977 --> 00:25:59,113
I have to find a way
to get through to her.

474
00:25:59,147 --> 00:26:00,914
This doesn't look good.

475
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:02,983
Who do you think she is?

476
00:26:03,017 --> 00:26:04,852
Methinks a riddle

477
00:26:04,886 --> 00:26:07,621
wrapped in Dolce & Gabbana
inside a--

478
00:26:07,655 --> 00:26:09,790
Can't you ever talk
like a normal person?

479
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:11,191
Everyone,
your attention, please.

480
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:14,328
As you can see,
we have a guest.

481
00:26:14,362 --> 00:26:16,497
This is Dr. Evelyn Vogel.

482
00:26:16,531 --> 00:26:20,134
She and I first met
when she consulted on a case--

483
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:21,969
When most of you
were still in high school.

484
00:26:22,003 --> 00:26:24,171
Dr. Vogel has been away from
Miami for a number of years,

485
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:26,607
but now she's back,
and has graciously offered

486
00:26:26,641 --> 00:26:28,609
her expertise
with our recent body dump.

487
00:26:28,643 --> 00:26:31,445
But we're only a day
into our investigation.

488
00:26:31,479 --> 00:26:34,548
I'm not here to step on
anyone's toes, lieutenant.

489
00:26:34,582 --> 00:26:35,582
It's off the books.

490
00:26:35,617 --> 00:26:37,551
Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.

491
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:40,120
She's served as a consultant
on a number

492
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:42,222
of high-profile cases
over the years.

493
00:26:42,257 --> 00:26:44,725
And she has written
the definitive textbook

494
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,059
on the brains of psychopaths.

495
00:26:46,094 --> 00:26:47,161
That's how I know you.

496
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:48,762
Your work on profiling
is classic.

497
00:26:48,796 --> 00:26:50,264
Thank you.

498
00:26:50,298 --> 00:26:53,500
I wouldn't normally insert
myself into an investigation.

499
00:26:53,535 --> 00:26:55,402
She said "Insert herself."

500
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:57,004
But when I read
about the body in the paper,

501
00:26:57,038 --> 00:26:59,406
there was one aspect
of this murder

502
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,708
that I found
particularly intriguing.

503
00:27:01,743 --> 00:27:03,623
Vince, bring up that X-ray
the M.E. sent over.

504
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,784
Thank you.

505
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:12,553
You see this part here?

506
00:27:12,587 --> 00:27:15,055
That's
the anterior insular cortex,

507
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:18,192
the portion of the brain
that processes empathy.

508
00:27:18,226 --> 00:27:20,994
And the hallmark
of a psychopath is...

509
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:23,163
They have no empathy.

510
00:27:23,198 --> 00:27:25,365
They have no empathy.

511
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,936
Now, it's possible
this is mere coincidence,

512
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,404
but if someone
goes to the trouble

513
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:33,273
of carefully extracting
a core from the brain,

514
00:27:33,308 --> 00:27:35,375
then I think that person
will give a little thought

515
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,910
to what part
of the brain he's taking.

516
00:27:36,945 --> 00:27:38,612
So how do you think
he did this?

517
00:27:38,646 --> 00:27:40,047
It's too early to say,

518
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:42,082
but maybe he was wanting to
perform some kind of experiment,

519
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:44,218
or maybe this
was simply a message.

520
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:45,786
He wouldn't be the first killer

521
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:48,889
to attempt to communicate
through a victim.

522
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:50,924
Who was the victim?

523
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,794
Robert Bailey.
Mechanic.

524
00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:56,430
According to his wife, he'd been
missing for nearly a week.

525
00:27:56,464 --> 00:27:57,931
Was the brain drilled into

526
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:02,069
while the victim
was still alive?

527
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:04,004
Dexter?

528
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:07,541
The M.E. indicated
it was done post-mortem.

529
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:09,243
The preliminary autopsy

530
00:28:09,277 --> 00:28:11,812
also showed bruising
on the knuckles and knees,

531
00:28:11,846 --> 00:28:13,780
which could indicate
the victim was held captive

532
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:15,949
in an enclosed space.

533
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:19,052
There were no contents
in the victim's stomach.

534
00:28:19,087 --> 00:28:21,388
Signs of dehydration.

535
00:28:21,422 --> 00:28:23,757
The victim was missing
for five days.

536
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:27,227
That suggests a pretty elaborate
pre-kill ritual

537
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:30,063
for a serial killer.

538
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:31,298
Well, this was just one body.

539
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:32,566
How do you know
it's a serial killer?

540
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,202
Oh, I doubt
that this is his first kill.

541
00:28:35,236 --> 00:28:37,771
Those are usually
more spontaneous.

542
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:40,374
This was planned ahead of time.
A lot of thought went into it.

543
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:43,477
I'm thinking
we're looking for someone

544
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:44,745
at least in their 30s.

545
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,813
Intelligent, organized.

546
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:48,749
Takes great pride in his work.

547
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:50,250
I think he'd enjoy the fact

548
00:28:50,285 --> 00:28:52,152
that we're talking
about him right now.

549
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:53,620
You think there will be more?

550
00:28:53,655 --> 00:28:55,122
I'd be surprised
if there are not.

551
00:28:55,156 --> 00:28:56,556
Any suspects?

552
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:59,726
Uh, no prints on the gun.
It sat in the rain all night.

553
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:02,262
Same story with the body.
We're still combing for DNA.

554
00:29:02,297 --> 00:29:03,730
Okay, let's widen
our interviews

555
00:29:03,765 --> 00:29:07,801
with friends and coworkers
of the victim.

556
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:10,337
We need to find where
he intersected with the killer.

557
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:12,072
Masuka,
when ballistics comes in--

558
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:13,440
Dexter, stay on the DNA.

559
00:29:13,474 --> 00:29:15,075
Thank you.

560
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:18,512
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

561
00:29:20,882 --> 00:29:24,518
I hear the FBI calls her
the "Psychopath Whisperer."

562
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:26,186
How lucky are we
she's on this case?

563
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,855
Yeah.
How lucky.

564
00:29:31,793 --> 00:29:34,194
Dr. Evelyn Vogel,
neuropsychiatrist,

565
00:29:34,228 --> 00:29:37,264
lecturer,
just published her third book.

566
00:29:37,298 --> 00:29:39,266
And the last person I need

567
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,001
looking in my direction
right now.

568
00:29:43,137 --> 00:29:46,106
Uh...

569
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,141
What do you think?

570
00:29:48,176 --> 00:29:50,711
It's nice, right?

571
00:29:50,745 --> 00:29:51,778
Uh, I guess so.

572
00:29:51,813 --> 00:29:53,714
Maria always had it
in her office.

573
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:57,317
I want you to have it
to remember her by.

574
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:05,192
Oh, thanks.
That's nice.

575
00:30:05,226 --> 00:30:06,626
You still haven't
forgiven her, have you?

576
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:08,462
It's complicated.

577
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:10,430
It's all right.
I understand.

578
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:13,166
But if you can't
accept it from Maria,

579
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,668
accept it from me.

580
00:30:14,702 --> 00:30:17,904
It'll make me feel better.

581
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:22,275
Now, I know things were awkward
between the two of you

582
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,511
before Maria
so tragically died.

583
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:25,912
So tragically died--

584
00:30:25,947 --> 00:30:28,882
she died because she wouldn't
leave things alone.

585
00:30:33,087 --> 00:30:36,123
I don't know why I said that.
Sorry.

586
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:44,664
I hope you find it
in your heart to forgive her.

587
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,740
Yo, Dex-bot.

588
00:30:53,775 --> 00:30:57,411
Vogel wants your presence
in the morgue.

589
00:30:57,445 --> 00:31:01,081
Great.

590
00:31:16,931 --> 00:31:21,668
El Sapo.

591
00:31:21,702 --> 00:31:25,205
Hello, Mr. Toad.

592
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:27,374
You stay in here.

593
00:31:27,408 --> 00:31:28,375
I'm gonna go meet him outside.

594
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:30,043
Are you selling the stuff?

595
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:31,511
Well, I don't have it on me,

596
00:31:31,546 --> 00:31:34,014
but I'm gonna
give him a little show.

597
00:31:54,469 --> 00:31:55,502
Deb, hey.

598
00:31:55,536 --> 00:31:56,770
Been a while.
How are you?

599
00:31:56,804 --> 00:31:59,473
I'm working on a case.
Um, an Andrew Briggs.

600
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:01,208
All business, huh?

601
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:03,410
I only have
a fucking second, okay?

602
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:05,579
So can you look into someone
named "El Sapo" for me?

603
00:32:05,613 --> 00:32:09,282
Hold on.

604
00:32:09,317 --> 00:32:11,451
- Who is he?
- He's a fucking fence.

605
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:13,954
I'll run it by the guys
in Robbery as soon as I get--

606
00:32:16,491 --> 00:32:19,559
You're welcome.

607
00:32:19,594 --> 00:32:21,561
How'd it go?

608
00:32:21,596 --> 00:32:25,232
I'm gonna be rich.

609
00:32:31,672 --> 00:32:34,808
Dr. Vogel?

610
00:32:34,842 --> 00:32:36,810
I got a message
you wanted to see me?

611
00:32:36,844 --> 00:32:39,913
Yes.
Thank you for coming.

612
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:40,981
I was wondering
if you'd had any luck

613
00:32:41,015 --> 00:32:42,916
with finding DNA on the body.

614
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,885
No.
We found a few hairs,

615
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:46,453
but they all belong
to the victim.

616
00:32:46,487 --> 00:32:48,889
Ah, so the killer will have

617
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:50,590
to be found
the old-fashioned way--

618
00:32:50,625 --> 00:32:52,926
boots to the ground.

619
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,094
Yeah, I suppose.

620
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:56,630
Quinn and Batista
having any luck?

621
00:32:56,664 --> 00:32:57,764
Not as far as I know.

622
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:01,001
The victim led a quiet life.
No enemies.

623
00:33:01,035 --> 00:33:03,737
Serial killers
don't have enemies.

624
00:33:03,771 --> 00:33:07,307
Everyone's a potential victim.

625
00:33:09,343 --> 00:33:11,111
Well, if you need
anything else,

626
00:33:11,145 --> 00:33:12,112
just pick up the phone.

627
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:13,947
Anybody at the lab
can help you.

628
00:33:13,981 --> 00:33:17,384
I was interested to have
your take on this case.

629
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:22,722
Me?

630
00:33:22,757 --> 00:33:23,990
Why?
I'm the blood guy.

631
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:28,862
The blood guy.
How did you end up here?

632
00:33:28,896 --> 00:33:32,632
My dad was a cop.

633
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,901
He kinda steered me
away from that.

634
00:33:34,936 --> 00:33:37,737
This seemed like a better fit.

635
00:33:37,772 --> 00:33:41,441
I was drawn to forensics too.

636
00:33:41,475 --> 00:33:43,977
But I chose to focus
on neuroscience.

637
00:33:44,011 --> 00:33:45,845
Psychopaths.

638
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,582
We both chose murder.

639
00:33:48,616 --> 00:33:52,152
Maybe we're both
a little crazy.

640
00:33:52,186 --> 00:33:53,653
Maybe.

641
00:33:53,688 --> 00:33:58,491
Mad scientists trained to look
at this as a biological mass.

642
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,327
A body part.

643
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:05,365
Yet somehow, from all those
firings of neurons,

644
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:07,867
something intangible emerges.

645
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:11,104
Emotions.

646
00:34:11,138 --> 00:34:14,507
Trust, morality, love.

647
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:15,709
Unless you're a psychopath.

648
00:34:15,743 --> 00:34:18,545
But even then,

649
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:20,847
belief systems emerge.

650
00:34:20,881 --> 00:34:25,585
As with the Bay Harbor Butcher.

651
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:28,955
What was he like?

652
00:34:31,626 --> 00:34:32,592
Who?

653
00:34:32,627 --> 00:34:35,195
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

654
00:34:35,229 --> 00:34:37,597
James Doakes.

655
00:34:37,632 --> 00:34:40,467
If I'm not mistaken,
he worked with you

656
00:34:40,501 --> 00:34:43,570
here in Miami Metro.

657
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:46,873
He was angry.
Had a short fuse.

658
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:49,542
Well, that doesn't
sound right to me.

659
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:52,712
As a psychopath, he would be
disassociated from his feelings,

660
00:34:52,747 --> 00:34:53,780
not quick to anger.

661
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:55,782
Maybe he wasn't a psychopath.

662
00:34:55,816 --> 00:34:56,783
Oh, yes, the Bay Harbor Butcher

663
00:34:56,817 --> 00:34:58,251
was definitely a psychopath.

664
00:34:58,285 --> 00:35:01,254
He'd have to be to masquerade
the way he did.

665
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:08,094
But he was an odd one,
that's for sure.

666
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:11,097
You're the expert.

667
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:14,467
Just the way
he picked his victims.

668
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:15,542
Persons who, on the whole,

669
00:35:15,569 --> 00:35:17,070
had some sort
of criminal background--

670
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:20,006
speaks to a strong
belief system.

671
00:35:20,041 --> 00:35:21,541
Almost as if he operated

672
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:25,011
with some sort
of moral guidelines.

673
00:35:28,315 --> 00:35:29,449
Guidelines.

674
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:31,484
Yeah, clearly it wasn't
a moral choice,

675
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,054
as psychopaths
have no conscience.

676
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:36,523
So why else
would he kill that way?

677
00:35:40,628 --> 00:35:42,629
So he could--

678
00:35:42,663 --> 00:35:45,098
get away with it
as long as he did?

679
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:46,800
People are less likely
to miss criminals

680
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,368
when they disappear.

681
00:35:48,402 --> 00:35:51,137
Doakes was Special Ops.
Maybe he picked that up there.

682
00:35:51,172 --> 00:35:53,673
Maybe he did.

683
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:56,609
Makes an interesting
case study.

684
00:35:56,644 --> 00:35:58,044
I wish I could have
interviewed him.

685
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,281
Sorry.

686
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:07,520
I look forward to working
with you, Dexter Morgan.

687
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:23,503
Yeah?
Oh, Dexter.

688
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:26,573
- Hi.
- Come on in, come on in.

689
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:28,074
Thanks.

690
00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:31,044
- This, uh, Evelyn Vogel--
- Quite a looker, that one.

691
00:36:31,078 --> 00:36:32,746
You know her?

692
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,948
Yeah, I know her.

693
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:37,450
She consulted for us on a couple
cases when I was a captain.

694
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:39,886
Last I heard,
she'd moved back to England.

695
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,217
I hadn't talked
to her in years.

696
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:43,957
And she's here now...

697
00:36:43,991 --> 00:36:46,559
why? Because a killer took
a part of a victim's brain?

698
00:36:46,594 --> 00:36:48,294
She called me up
out of the blue,

699
00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:50,497
said she'd moved back here
about a year ago.

700
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:53,566
She asked was I free for lunch,
I filled her in on the case,

701
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:54,701
and she offered to help.

702
00:36:54,735 --> 00:36:56,215
Why, is she being
a pain in the ass?

703
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:57,737
No.

704
00:36:57,772 --> 00:36:59,973
I'm just trying to figure out
if she's an asset or not.

705
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:04,244
Oh, well, she's smart.

706
00:37:04,278 --> 00:37:05,712
So use her to your advantage.

707
00:37:05,746 --> 00:37:08,381
Will do.

708
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:11,217
Why do you think
she called now?

709
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:12,752
Like you said, out of the blue?

710
00:37:12,787 --> 00:37:15,255
Maybe the stars aligned.

711
00:37:15,289 --> 00:37:17,323
Maybe Mercury is in retrograde,
I don't really care

712
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:18,958
the reason why she called.

713
00:37:18,993 --> 00:37:20,293
All I know is
this is law enforcement.

714
00:37:20,327 --> 00:37:22,395
You take whatever
free help you can get.

715
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:27,000
So keep her in the loop,
Dexter.

716
00:37:27,034 --> 00:37:28,034
Will do.

717
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,342
What if I'm
the reason she's here?

718
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:37,938
Hey, uh, when you
talk to your sister,

719
00:37:37,945 --> 00:37:39,646
can you tell her
she needs to check her messages?

720
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,982
She asked me for some help,
and now I can't reach her.

721
00:37:43,017 --> 00:37:44,584
Will do.

722
00:37:44,618 --> 00:37:46,252
Is this about, uh, Briggs?

723
00:37:46,287 --> 00:37:50,323
No, she asked me to look
into this fence named El Sapo.

724
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:53,026
Nobody in Robbery's
heard of the guy.

725
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,262
All I know is Briggs
robbed the wrong store.

726
00:37:56,297 --> 00:37:57,597
It belonged to some mob guy.

727
00:37:57,631 --> 00:38:00,567
Now nobody's willing
to buy what he's selling

728
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:02,368
except this El Sapo guy.

729
00:38:02,403 --> 00:38:04,003
All right.

730
00:38:04,038 --> 00:38:06,806
El Sapo.

731
00:38:06,841 --> 00:38:08,675
Daddy.

732
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:10,710
Harrison, hey.

733
00:38:10,744 --> 00:38:12,345
What a nice surprise.

734
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:14,814
No, not a surprise.
We discussed this.

735
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:15,815
We did?

736
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,317
Dex, you know
I love working for you,

737
00:38:17,351 --> 00:38:19,085
but I need an occasional
night off.

738
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,787
Right.
We discussed it.

739
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:21,988
Okay, I've got
his dinner in here.

740
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:23,389
Spaghetti and meatballs,

741
00:38:23,424 --> 00:38:25,792
green beans, chocolate pudding.

742
00:38:25,826 --> 00:38:27,346
Yeah, about tonight,
maybe we could--

743
00:38:27,361 --> 00:38:29,462
Harrison,
those are daddy's things.

744
00:38:29,496 --> 00:38:32,131
- What's this?
- Bye.

745
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:36,469
It's a very expensive
centrifuge.

746
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:39,472
Come on, let's get
your dinner set up.

747
00:38:39,506 --> 00:38:41,074
- Pudding!
- After dinner.

748
00:38:41,108 --> 00:38:42,075
Pudding!

749
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:01,694
Hello?

750
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:03,429
I thought I made it clear.

751
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:06,199
You meet me here with the money,
and I take you to the stuff.

752
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:08,601
Yeah, I'll be alone.

753
00:39:08,636 --> 00:39:10,503
Fuckin' El Sapo is "El Idiot."

754
00:39:10,537 --> 00:39:12,639
When he comes here,

755
00:39:12,673 --> 00:39:13,740
you keep yourself hidden,
okay, baby?

756
00:39:13,774 --> 00:39:15,208
Why?

757
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:17,277
'Cause I don't know the guy.
He might be freaky.

758
00:39:17,311 --> 00:39:19,779
- I wanna go with you.
- We talked about this.

759
00:39:19,813 --> 00:39:22,882
I'm not doing anything
that might get you hurt.

760
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:25,218
I'll meet him outside.

761
00:39:25,252 --> 00:39:28,521
You stay in here.

762
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:33,593
I love this guy.

763
00:39:33,627 --> 00:39:36,229
I love that guy.

764
00:39:44,405 --> 00:39:45,371
El Sapo.

765
00:39:45,406 --> 00:39:48,574
Real name: Javier Guzman.

766
00:39:52,613 --> 00:39:56,616
Harrison, please.

767
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,418
Robbery didn't know
the name El Sapo

768
00:39:58,452 --> 00:40:00,887
because he's not a fence.

769
00:40:00,921 --> 00:40:03,890
He's a hit man.

770
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:09,395
Jesus, Harrison!

771
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:12,932
Look at what you did!

772
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:17,770
Uh, I'm sorry.

773
00:40:17,805 --> 00:40:18,905
It's okay.

774
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:19,906
I'm sorry I yelled.

775
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,008
It's okay.

776
00:40:22,042 --> 00:40:26,512
Just give me a second.

777
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,387
- It's Deb. Leave a message.
- The user's mailbox is full.

778
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:44,797
Come on.
We're going.

779
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:51,637
If Deb is with Briggs
when El Sapo shows up,

780
00:40:51,672 --> 00:40:54,407
he might take her out as well.

781
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:56,743
It's Joey Quinn. Thrill me.

782
00:40:56,777 --> 00:40:58,644
Quinn, it's Dexter.
Call me.

783
00:41:10,958 --> 00:41:13,793
The fuck!

784
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:18,398
Yeah! I'm coming!

785
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:21,934
The fuck?

786
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:25,204
Hey.
You brought the kid.

787
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:26,272
What's going on?

788
00:41:26,306 --> 00:41:27,607
You didn't answer your phone.

789
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:29,482
Yeah, I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

790
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:32,345
Well, I need
to get ahold of Deb.

791
00:41:32,379 --> 00:41:35,581
And you need me for that why?

792
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:36,916
I don't know where she is.

793
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,618
What do you mean
you don't know where she is?

794
00:41:38,652 --> 00:41:41,387
I just don't.
Look--

795
00:41:41,422 --> 00:41:42,889
I know she's
in Fort Lauderdale.

796
00:41:42,923 --> 00:41:44,223
I need to know
where she's staying.

797
00:41:44,258 --> 00:41:45,858
You said she talks to you.
Do you know where she is?

798
00:41:45,893 --> 00:41:47,560
Yeah, the last she mentioned

799
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:49,362
she was at this place,
the Pink Motel.

800
00:41:49,396 --> 00:41:50,863
Some dump.

801
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:52,799
Thanks.
Come on.

802
00:41:54,868 --> 00:41:57,003
Was that Dexter?

803
00:41:57,037 --> 00:41:59,972
Yeah. He was looking for Deb.
Fucking strange.

804
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:01,841
Hmm.

805
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,409
I don't want to talk
about that.

806
00:42:03,444 --> 00:42:07,447
Come here.

807
00:42:08,949 --> 00:42:09,949
Oh, my God.

808
00:42:09,983 --> 00:42:11,517
Why is
the whole world against us?

809
00:42:11,552 --> 00:42:14,020
Ignore it.

810
00:42:20,727 --> 00:42:22,428
This is Jamie Batista.
Please leave a message.

811
00:42:22,463 --> 00:42:24,630
Jesus.

812
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:27,600
Doesn't anybody answer
their fucking phone?

813
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:31,704
- We're going for a drive.
- Okay, daddy.

814
00:43:12,446 --> 00:43:17,283
- It's Deb. Leave a message.
- The user's mailbox is full.

815
00:43:52,219 --> 00:43:54,020
What the fuck?

816
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:55,221
I told you
to stay away from here.

817
00:43:55,255 --> 00:43:57,323
I know, but you're in danger.

818
00:43:57,357 --> 00:44:00,259
Someone is gonna kill Briggs.
You need to come with me now.

819
00:44:00,294 --> 00:44:01,394
The fuck I do.

820
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:02,495
Briggs is about
to meet his fence.

821
00:44:02,529 --> 00:44:03,596
I'm gonna make
a fuckload of money.

822
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,064
That's who's gonna shoot him.

823
00:44:05,098 --> 00:44:06,799
I'm trying to keep you from
getting shot along with him.

824
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,868
- That's bullshit.
- No, it's not.

825
00:44:08,902 --> 00:44:10,870
El Sapo isn't a fence.
He's a hit man.

826
00:44:10,904 --> 00:44:12,905
He's gonna get the jewels,
and he's gonna kill Briggs.

827
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,274
I know you don't want to see me,
but I needed to tell you that.

828
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:16,709
All right, you told me that.

829
00:44:16,743 --> 00:44:18,277
- Deb, it's very dangerous.
- I get that.

830
00:44:18,312 --> 00:44:20,146
So you need to come with me.
You could die here.

831
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,949
I don't fucking care!

832
00:44:22,983 --> 00:44:24,050
Deb--

833
00:44:24,084 --> 00:44:28,154
What?

834
00:44:28,188 --> 00:44:29,455
What, aren't you the one that's

835
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:30,957
always saying that
bad people deserve to die?

836
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:35,127
- You're not a bad person.
- I killed LaGuerta.

837
00:44:35,162 --> 00:44:37,063
- It doesn't matter right now.
- It doesn't matter?

838
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:39,565
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter,
it doesn't matter!

839
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,901
That's not what I meant!
Come on!

840
00:44:41,935 --> 00:44:44,604
Deb, it's been months of this.

841
00:44:44,638 --> 00:44:46,272
You can't keep me away forever.

842
00:44:46,306 --> 00:44:50,443
You don't
understand anything, do you?

843
00:44:52,546 --> 00:44:55,047
I wake up every day
thinking of every bad decision

844
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:56,849
that I ever made
because of you.

845
00:44:56,883 --> 00:44:59,252
And it kills me

846
00:44:59,286 --> 00:45:02,121
that I can't take
any of it back.

847
00:45:02,155 --> 00:45:03,689
I'm sorry.

848
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:08,461
Don't fucking make that face
and say "I'm sorry" to me.

849
00:45:08,495 --> 00:45:12,665
Even if it were fucking true,
it wouldn't make any difference.

850
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:15,001
'Cause we can't undo any of it.

851
00:45:15,035 --> 00:45:18,204
So why don't you go
back to your little life

852
00:45:18,238 --> 00:45:19,639
and pretend like
everything's fine,

853
00:45:19,673 --> 00:45:23,776
but I can't do that because
I am not fucking like you!

854
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,344
Deb, we can talk
about this later.

855
00:45:25,379 --> 00:45:26,479
No, we fucking can't.

856
00:45:26,513 --> 00:45:27,513
But you need
to come with me right--

857
00:45:34,655 --> 00:45:37,523
You again?

858
00:45:41,261 --> 00:45:42,395
Let's go.

859
00:45:42,429 --> 00:45:44,964
Asshole,
get your fuckin' hands off her.

860
00:45:44,998 --> 00:45:48,334
What the fuck?

861
00:45:58,045 --> 00:46:00,379
What did you do?

862
00:46:08,121 --> 00:46:11,090
I felt okay around him.

863
00:46:11,124 --> 00:46:13,025
You didn't belong with him.

864
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,193
- Fuck.
- Deb--

865
00:46:14,227 --> 00:46:16,429
Fuck! Fuck!

866
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:18,297
Will you fucking go?
Will you go?

867
00:46:18,332 --> 00:46:19,999
Please go.

868
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:21,500
I came here to save you.

869
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:23,469
No...

870
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:26,405
Deb, look at yourself.
You're lost.

871
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,209
I am not lost.

872
00:46:32,913 --> 00:46:34,580
I know exactly where I am.

873
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:36,215
I am in some shitty
fucking hell,

874
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:38,050
which is exactly
what I deserve.

875
00:46:38,085 --> 00:46:39,518
But you...

876
00:46:39,553 --> 00:46:43,089
you are lost.

877
00:46:46,793 --> 00:46:49,762
All my life,
I thought I needed you.

878
00:46:49,796 --> 00:46:51,397
That I couldn't survive
without you.

879
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:53,399
Fuck.
Fuck.

880
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,534
It was the other
fucking way around.

881
00:46:55,569 --> 00:47:00,506
It was the other way around.

882
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,208
Deb--

883
00:47:02,242 --> 00:47:04,577
Fucking go.

884
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:06,846
Don't--
I'll get rid of the body.

885
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,881
No, don't you fucking
do anything, all right?

886
00:47:08,915 --> 00:47:10,216
I'm gonna handle this.

887
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,451
But if El Sapo comes,
he's a hit man and--

888
00:47:12,486 --> 00:47:14,053
Well, he has
no fucking clue who I am.

889
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:15,388
But if he comes here
and sees you with--

890
00:47:15,422 --> 00:47:16,389
Would you fucking go?

891
00:47:16,423 --> 00:47:18,391
I'm gonna call this in.

892
00:47:18,425 --> 00:47:21,894
- The police?
- Yes.

893
00:47:24,064 --> 00:47:26,065
You should go.

894
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:30,703
I'd like to report
a suspected homicide.

895
00:47:30,737 --> 00:47:34,540
Go.

896
00:47:34,574 --> 00:47:36,909
The Pink Motel in Broward.

897
00:47:40,947 --> 00:47:44,216
Oh, fuck.

898
00:48:05,705 --> 00:48:07,273
Harrison?

899
00:48:07,307 --> 00:48:09,642
Harrison?

900
00:48:09,676 --> 00:48:12,077
Harrison!
Harrison!

901
00:48:12,112 --> 00:48:14,814
Daddy?

902
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:18,250
Come here, buddy.

903
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:21,320
Oh...

904
00:48:21,354 --> 00:48:23,522
I couldn't find you.

905
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:27,660
I'm here, buddy,
I'm right here.

906
00:48:27,694 --> 00:48:30,663
Where are we, daddy?

907
00:48:30,697 --> 00:48:33,933
Lost.

908
00:48:37,637 --> 00:48:39,705
So you work
for Elway Investigations?

909
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:43,175
Did a skip trace on Briggs,
you went out for a sandwich,

910
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,245
and you found him dead
when you got back.

911
00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:47,413
That's it.

912
00:48:47,447 --> 00:48:51,183
Any idea who might
want to kill him?

913
00:48:51,218 --> 00:48:53,285
No.

914
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,323
We'll call you if we have
any more questions.

915
00:49:11,738 --> 00:49:15,307
Elway, I've got a good news,
bad news situation here.

916
00:49:15,342 --> 00:49:16,976
Briggs is dead,

917
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:18,978
but I think I have a lead
on where the jewelry might be,

918
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:20,846
so we might have a shot
at coming out ahead on this,

919
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:21,847
but I'm gonna
talk to you about it

920
00:49:21,882 --> 00:49:22,848
when I get back
to the office, okay?

921
00:49:22,883 --> 00:49:23,849
Bye.

922
00:49:59,452 --> 00:50:02,688
Debra was right.
I was wrong.

923
00:50:02,722 --> 00:50:05,257
It's me who's lost.

924
00:50:05,292 --> 00:50:07,326
A better person
would let her go.

925
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,664
But I don't know how.

926
00:50:13,633 --> 00:50:17,970
Without her,
I don't know who I am anymore.

927
00:50:34,988 --> 00:50:37,723
Dexter?

928
00:50:39,893 --> 00:50:43,662
This isn't a good time.

929
00:50:43,697 --> 00:50:46,665
I was hoping to share
something with you.

930
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,102
I told you I'm not
in the mood for this.

931
00:50:50,136 --> 00:50:53,405
Well, then maybe I can
just leave this with you.

932
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:30,843
- Dexter, please.
- What is it you want?

933
00:51:30,877 --> 00:51:35,247
Please, let go.

934
00:51:35,281 --> 00:51:38,584
You can't kill me.

935
00:51:38,618 --> 00:51:40,152
Why?

936
00:51:40,186 --> 00:51:43,155
Because I don't
fit Harry's code.

937
00:51:52,891 --> 00:52:03,222
