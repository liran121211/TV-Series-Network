2
00:01:47,384 --> 00:01:49,218
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:49,253 --> 00:01:50,194
Remember me?

4
00:01:50,298 --> 00:01:51,538
What are you doing here,
Hannah?

5
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:53,834
Should probably leave
before my husband returns.

6
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:56,075
- Your husband?
- Oh, my God.

7
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,477
You're still in love with her,
aren't you?

8
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,611
No.

9
00:01:58,646 --> 00:02:00,947
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

10
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:02,615
So what is it you'd like to do?

11
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,617
I would like to take her
to Marshal Services

12
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:05,678
and have her the fuck arrested.

13
00:02:05,798 --> 00:02:07,620
When the brain surgeon
was out there,

14
00:02:07,655 --> 00:02:10,590
I trusted Dexter to solve
the problem, and he did.

15
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,525
Before you take matters
into your own hands,

16
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:14,556
be sure to consider
all the consequences

17
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,547
of those actions.

18
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:19,365
Can I borrow that
high-tech GPS tracker?

19
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:23,326
Zach Hamilton killed
Norma Rivera.

20
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:26,906
What if you were to teach
Zach the code?

21
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:31,177
Am I ready to be
a spiritual father?

22
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:32,479
Are you gonna help me
be like you?

23
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,315
Hi, Dexter!

24
00:02:35,349 --> 00:02:36,613
Going for a little night swim.

25
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,051
Enjoy.

26
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:39,586
What the fuck
were you thinking?

27
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,855
That rich asshole
is walking around free.

28
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:43,049
We have nothing on this kid.

29
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:44,123
That's why I was following him.

30
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:45,391
Let it go.
That's an order.

31
00:02:45,426 --> 00:02:47,927
By the way, me and Jamie
are moving in together.

32
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:48,928
What?

33
00:02:48,963 --> 00:02:50,196
Why did you marry him?

34
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,165
Because he was there
when you weren't.

35
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,280
No, Miles, stop it, please.

36
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,635
You'll never leave this boat.

37
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,339
I told the crew

38
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:01,741
that Miles was going to New York
for a few days.

39
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,244
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

40
00:03:04,278 --> 00:03:06,546
I won't.

41
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:11,618
Come on, what the fuck?
Dexter!

42
00:03:11,652 --> 00:03:14,354
It looks like he's not home.

43
00:03:15,956 --> 00:03:18,224
Cassie.

44
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:21,261
Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.

45
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:24,097
Is it possible Zach did this?

46
00:03:40,548 --> 00:03:42,476
Every contact leaves a trace.

47
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,143
That idea is the foundation
of all crime scene analysis.

48
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:54,341
I should be focused on
who bludgeoned Cassie and why.

49
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,146
But instead...

50
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,851
ever since Hannah came back
into my orbit,

51
00:04:03,885 --> 00:04:06,086
she's all I can think about.

52
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,833
Manner of death?

53
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:21,168
Swan.

54
00:04:21,202 --> 00:04:25,272
Killer didn't plan this.
It was impulsive.

55
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,142
This is just how Zach Hamilton
killed Norma Rivera.

56
00:04:28,176 --> 00:04:30,911
She was killed pretty deep
in her apartment.

57
00:04:30,945 --> 00:04:33,280
Like she let
the killer in herself.

58
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,249
So she knew him.

59
00:04:35,283 --> 00:04:37,584
That guy she was dating.

60
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:40,654
You said you were coming here
to pick Cassie up for a date.

61
00:04:40,688 --> 00:04:42,923
Yes, I was late.

62
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:45,225
Where were you coming from?

63
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:48,829
I had a...
the building inspection.

64
00:04:48,863 --> 00:04:50,130
I'm a structural engineer.

65
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,367
Okay, well, maybe I was wrong.

66
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,035
Maybe it was the repair man
or the delivery guy.

67
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:56,603
Or Zach Hamilton.

68
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:58,172
If I'd paid
more attention to Zach

69
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,406
instead of being with Hannah...

70
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:04,545
Would Cassie still be alive?

71
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:16,089
Is that Zach's blood?

72
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:17,491
Zach knew Cassie.

73
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,294
He met her once, here with me.

74
00:05:22,063 --> 00:05:23,630
Cassie was a good person.

75
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,966
You're sure there was no one
else she was having issues with?

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,534
Just try and think.

77
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,336
I can't think right now.
Can you just--please--

78
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,705
It's okay, it's okay.

79
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,211
Hey, Deb, how are you?

80
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:38,545
I'm okay.

81
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,347
It's good to see you,
you know, at a crime scene.

82
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,249
I'm gonna talk to Dex.

83
00:05:42,283 --> 00:05:44,451
Go ahead.

84
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:50,824
Harrison's asleep.

85
00:05:50,859 --> 00:05:52,192
Thanks.

86
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:57,431
That's a break.

87
00:05:57,465 --> 00:05:59,099
Could that be
the killer's blood?

88
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:02,069
Here's hoping.

89
00:06:02,103 --> 00:06:06,440
Are you okay?

90
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:08,442
Sure.

91
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:11,411
Why the fuck do I even ask?

92
00:06:11,446 --> 00:06:13,881
What about Hannah?

93
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,449
What about her?

94
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:16,650
Is she still here?

95
00:06:16,684 --> 00:06:17,718
Hey, Deb.

96
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,653
Hey.

97
00:06:19,687 --> 00:06:21,588
Who would want to kill Cassie?

98
00:06:21,623 --> 00:06:23,090
She owe people money?

99
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,458
We're looking into that.

100
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:27,661
What about customers
or a vendor?

101
00:06:27,695 --> 00:06:28,929
Sorry.

102
00:06:28,963 --> 00:06:31,899
I have no fucking business
being here.

103
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,767
Anytime you wanna come back,
the door's always open.

104
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:37,337
Maybe I'll put an application
in the mail.

105
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:41,074
I'll come back to finish
this conversation, yeah?

106
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,877
Okay.

107
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:45,746
Can't wait.

108
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:54,288
I would give everything
to feel nothing again.

109
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:10,804
We need to get you out of town
as soon as possible.

110
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,940
I need a new passport.

111
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,214
I have a guy that can do that.

112
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:15,609
I'll find out what he needs.

113
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,278
That's just a phone call.

114
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,480
You could have phoned me,

115
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,450
rather than driving
all the way down here.

116
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,620
This was on the way to the lab.

117
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:29,590
This marina is not
on the way to the lab.

118
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,429
You know, we, um...

119
00:07:35,463 --> 00:07:39,366
we missed a spot of blood
cleaning up.

120
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,467
No, we didn't.

121
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,661
Edge of the whiskey bottle.

122
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,937
I noticed it this morning.

123
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:48,475
I was so glad to see it

124
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,311
because it reminded me of you.

125
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:55,916
Did you clean it up?

126
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,718
Yes, I cleaned it up.

127
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,186
With bleach?

128
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,990
Yes.

129
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,593
Miami is not the place
for you to be right now.

130
00:08:08,596 --> 00:08:11,365
The sooner we get you
out of here, the better.

131
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:14,401
I completely agree.

132
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,787
It is Zach's blood
under Cassie's nails.

133
00:08:33,821 --> 00:08:36,723
He killed another
innocent woman.

134
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:38,225
What a waste.

135
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,060
He could have had
a great future.

136
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:42,362
Miami Metro can never know.

137
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,998
It's one small step
from Zach to me.

138
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,333
Hey, Dex.

139
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:48,068
Hey, remember Niki,

140
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:49,636
the apple that didn't fall
too far from my tree?

141
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,171
- Hi.
- Hi.

142
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:54,875
Around here we call Dexter
"The King of Spatter."

143
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,976
We do?

144
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,246
I do, in private.

145
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,582
Hey, feel free to send
any and all paperwork her way.

146
00:09:04,018 --> 00:09:05,619
Here you go.

147
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:08,689
Oh, uh, the blood
under Cassie's nails?

148
00:09:08,723 --> 00:09:10,657
No luck.
It was hers.

149
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:14,227
From a transfer
after her head started to bleed.

150
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,764
"The victim collapsed
into a pool of her own blood."

151
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:20,367
Hey, are you--
are you okay with all this?

152
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:23,003
I mean,
I am a little bit worried

153
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:25,072
about the energy around here.

154
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,474
Well, then maybe we can hang
a crystal in the corner.

155
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:30,477
Yeah, we should sage
the place first.

156
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,648
Hey, could I talk to you
for a sec?

157
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,717
- Actually, I'm--
- Real quick.

158
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,686
You recognize these?

159
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:40,987
Yeah, I took them.

160
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,422
Yeah, now look at these.

161
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,791
Norma Rivera,
Cassie Jollenston.

162
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:47,794
Are they fucking similar,
or what?

163
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,296
They were both bludgeoned.

164
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,299
Bludgeonings can look
pretty fucking similar.

165
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,736
Do you think Zach Hamilton
could have done this?

166
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,404
Zach knew Norma.

167
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:59,172
How could he have possibly
known Cassie?

168
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:00,474
I know,
it's crazy, I--

169
00:10:00,508 --> 00:10:03,110
Yeah, what's crazy
is Batista and Matthews

170
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,878
wanted you to lay off
looking into this Hamilton kid.

171
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,046
What are you doing?

172
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,381
This Hamilton kid
is a fucking monster.

173
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:09,449
You know it too.

174
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:10,784
Not really.

175
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,720
I think you should drop this.
Think about your career.

176
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:15,088
Why? It's not like
I'm gonna make sergeant.

177
00:10:15,123 --> 00:10:16,389
Just do me a favor.

178
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:18,191
You see any of Zach's DNA
at the crime scene,

179
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,926
just let me know.

180
00:10:19,961 --> 00:10:22,729
Absolutely.

181
00:10:22,764 --> 00:10:26,133
He hasn't returned my calls.

182
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,902
I tried to reach him too.

183
00:10:28,936 --> 00:10:32,172
I spoke to his parents,
they haven't seen him.

184
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:35,242
He could be on the run,
hiding out somewhere.

185
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:38,712
Were you with at Hannah person?

186
00:10:38,746 --> 00:10:41,348
Is that why this woman is dead?

187
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:44,351
She's dead because you
talked me out of killing Zach

188
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:46,186
in the first place.

189
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:52,025
He showed real potential.
You saw that.

190
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:55,428
I thought you were having
an impact on him.

191
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:58,498
Zach spoke to me of trying
to live up to your rules,

192
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,167
your standards.

193
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,138
I thought he was
processing it all.

194
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,574
Yeah, Zach's smart,
but he can't control himself.

195
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:09,209
We both should have seen that.

196
00:11:09,243 --> 00:11:13,046
Zach's just a boy.

197
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,882
A boy who knows
too much about me,

198
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:19,886
about you, who's killed
two innocent women.

199
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:25,492
No, I guess you don't have
many options, do you?

200
00:11:25,526 --> 00:11:29,129
No.

201
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:32,699
I wonder if it will be
different for you,

202
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,502
because of what
could have been.

203
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:36,603
I doubt it.

204
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:40,340
But surely there have been...

205
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:42,876
people that were
more difficult for you to--

206
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,980
how do you like to say it?
...take care of.

207
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:52,252
Zach Hamilton
is not one of them.

208
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:55,622
I'm not sure I believe you.

209
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:06,399
Zach rented a room
in Fiesta Key.

210
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,436
He's on the run,
and using his own credit card.

211
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,838
Rookie mistake.

212
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:21,381
I forget the impact murder has
on real people.

213
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,090
Deb.

214
00:12:32,026 --> 00:12:33,693
Any luck?

215
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:36,263
With what?

216
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,732
Cassie's case?

217
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,868
- Is that why you're here?
- No.

218
00:12:41,903 --> 00:12:45,138
Hey, Jaime.
How are you doing?

219
00:12:45,172 --> 00:12:48,275
I don't know how you two
do this every day.

220
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,976
I don't.

221
00:12:50,011 --> 00:12:52,479
Right.

222
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:03,857
On a scale of one to ten,

223
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:07,327
ten being
out of our lives forever,

224
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:08,695
where the fuck is Hannah McKay?

225
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:09,863
She's not a threat, Deb.

226
00:13:09,897 --> 00:13:11,458
The last time we talked
on this subject,

227
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:13,033
- you said, "I'm on top of it."
- And I am.

228
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,568
Are you on top of it,
or are you on top of her?

229
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,837
- Deb--
- Is she in Miami?

230
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:21,708
What the fuck
is she doing here?

231
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,910
It has to do with her husband.

232
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,278
The casino guy?

233
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:27,981
Yeah, he's abusive,
verbally and physically.

234
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,483
They seem perfect.

235
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,721
- What about him?
- She wanted me to--

236
00:13:34,755 --> 00:13:37,257
Why didn't she do it herself?

237
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:40,694
Too much scrutiny.

238
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:43,463
Did you do it?

239
00:13:43,497 --> 00:13:45,865
No.

240
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,335
Well, that must have
pissed her off.

241
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,870
What's to keep her
from trying to kill us again?

242
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:53,907
She didn't try to kill us.
She wanted to get my attention.

243
00:13:53,941 --> 00:13:55,275
By poisoning me and leaving you

244
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:57,544
on the side
of the fucking road?

245
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:02,582
You have the fucking altitude
to see all of this,

246
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:06,920
that she's using you, and you
still want to protect her?

247
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:09,322
When she gets her passport,

248
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:13,660
she'll be out of our lives
forever.

249
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,528
- You believe that?
- I do.

250
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,130
Okay, well, that's the thing
that you can't see,

251
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:20,066
that you're lying to yourself.

252
00:14:20,101 --> 00:14:24,237
She's a murderer.
She needs to be locked up.

253
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:26,006
She could talk.
After LaGuerta,

254
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,208
I can't afford another round
of questions from anyone.

255
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:31,378
She's a fugitive.
She's a poisoner.

256
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,115
She's easily discredited.

257
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:38,818
Enough already.

258
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,966
We were supposed
to have lunch together,

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,435
Cassie and me.

260
00:14:55,469 --> 00:14:57,704
Jaime, I'm sorry.

261
00:14:57,738 --> 00:15:00,807
I can't be here right now.

262
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:03,543
I can take Harrison with me.

263
00:15:03,577 --> 00:15:06,413
I moved in with Joey.

264
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,514
Oh.

265
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:09,616
I thought we'd go there,

266
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,885
since you're on
the next few days.

267
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,087
I mean,
if that's okay with you.

268
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,123
Yeah, that's okay with me.

269
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't smile?

270
00:15:31,238 --> 00:15:35,475
Just send this
to the passport guy.

271
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:39,846
He'll have a new identity
and all the paperwork for you

272
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,347
by tomorrow.

273
00:15:41,382 --> 00:15:44,184
Do I get to pick my name?

274
00:15:44,218 --> 00:15:46,920
I doubt it, but I'll ask.

275
00:15:46,954 --> 00:15:49,656
So does he drop it off,
or--

276
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,624
No, I will.

277
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:56,529
Okay, so just wait here?

278
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:59,365
- Maybe you should come with me.
- Where?

279
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,101
I have to go to the Keys
tonight.

280
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:03,269
The Keys?

281
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:05,738
It would just be for the night.

282
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,644
Besides, it's not safe
for you to be here.

283
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,948
- Safe?
- You know, alone.

284
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:17,617
I only sent the crew away
for a few hours

285
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:19,586
because I knew
that you were coming.

286
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,655
They can protect me
from almost anything.

287
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,861
It's the "almost"
that concerns me.

288
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:30,196
So what's in the Keys,

289
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,232
or should I say
who is in the Keys?

290
00:16:32,266 --> 00:16:35,001
I'll tell you on the way down.

291
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:40,507
How would you like to make
a boatload of cash?

292
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,509
I'm assuming that's
a rhetorical question.

293
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,712
U.S. Marshal Service
is offering $25,000

294
00:16:45,746 --> 00:16:47,947
for information leading
to the arrest of Hannah McKay.

295
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:50,650
Sal price's publisher
is offering another 125,000,

296
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,386
his family another 100,000.
Put that together, and you get--

297
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,355
250,000.
Yeah, I can do math.

298
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,291
I think Hannah McKay
is back in Miami.

299
00:16:58,325 --> 00:17:00,226
And you think this because?

300
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:03,396
Are you interested or not?

301
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,299
Very.

302
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:13,740
No fucking way.
They're gone.

303
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:15,508
You sure this is
the Castner slip?

304
00:17:15,543 --> 00:17:16,910
I'm sure.

305
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:18,678
You sure Hannah McKay
was going under the alias

306
00:17:18,712 --> 00:17:22,081
- of Maggie Castner?
- Yes.

307
00:17:22,116 --> 00:17:24,951
What, you don't believe me?

308
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:27,220
Lot of pretty, blonde girls
in Miami.

309
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,721
You sure Hannah McKay was here?

310
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,757
I know for a fucking fact
that she was.

311
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,892
How?

312
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,562
I just do.

313
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,464
You really don't like her,
do you?

314
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,533
Nope.

315
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:43,203
I'm just saying, emotions
cloud your judgment, you know?

316
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:44,737
You keep it about the money,

317
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,272
someday, you may have
one of these yachts.

318
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:48,007
I don't want a fucking yacht.

319
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:52,779
Well, I do, so let's keep it
about my money, all right?

320
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:54,414
Okay, so the yacht may be gone,

321
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,051
but we don't know
if they were fucking on it.

322
00:17:58,085 --> 00:17:59,886
Maybe the dock master
knows something.

323
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,154
I'll see
if he's bribe-able.

324
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:04,157
I'll meet you
back at the office, all right?

325
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:11,331
Joey, I don't want
to be here alone.

326
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,066
You're not alone,
you got the kid.

327
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,202
My name is Harrison.

328
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:17,837
And a fine name that is.

329
00:18:17,871 --> 00:18:21,140
Don't you got
some cartoons to watch?

330
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:25,778
Joey, I am freaking out.
My friend was murdered.

331
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:30,450
I--look, I know,
but once I catch the killer,

332
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,786
you're not gonna have to be
scared anymore, okay?

333
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,456
You know, if it were Deb
asking you to stay,

334
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,891
you wouldn't even
put up a fight.

335
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,294
Deb wouldn't ask me to stay.

336
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,463
She'd want to catch the killer
as bad as I do.

337
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,499
Sorry I'm not Deb.

338
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:50,503
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

339
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:55,241
You need me to stay here,
I'll stay here, okay?

340
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:11,991
- Fuck-bucket.
- Moth

341
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,396
Hey, Deb, what's up?

342
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,932
Hey, just checking in...
about Hannah.

343
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:22,201
I haven't seen her.

344
00:19:22,236 --> 00:19:25,071
- Where are you?
- Grabbing some dinner.

345
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:27,473
Oh, yeah?
Want company?

346
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:29,742
- No, I'm good.
- No, seriously.

347
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,010
I'll join you.
Where are you?

348
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,946
Um--

349
00:19:33,981 --> 00:19:35,748
Look at a fucking street sign.

350
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:39,519
I'm on the highway.
How about tomorrow?

351
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:43,089
Sure.

352
00:19:45,693 --> 00:19:48,394
Dick for brains.

353
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:52,432
She's a ray of sunshine,
isn't she?

354
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:01,174
So what'd you say to the crew?

355
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:03,743
I told them to head on
to St. Kitts.

356
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:07,580
It was our next stop
after Miami anyway.

357
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,716
They're paid
not to ask questions.

358
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,419
Hmm.

359
00:20:13,454 --> 00:20:15,555
So who are you after?

360
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,157
His name is Zach.

361
00:20:18,192 --> 00:20:20,693
What did Zach do?

362
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:23,796
Disappoint me.

363
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:28,601
He was someone Dr. Vogel
thought I could, uh, mentor.

364
00:20:28,635 --> 00:20:30,636
Who's Dr. Vogel?

365
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:34,707
Dr. Evelyn Vogel.
She studies psychopaths.

366
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:38,411
My father went to see her
about me.

367
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,080
How did that conversation go?

368
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,484
"Hey, I've got this son
who has these urges."

369
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:48,254
He was at the end of his rope.

370
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:52,458
Dr. Vogel's the one who came up
with the idea of the code.

371
00:20:52,493 --> 00:20:56,095
She...created me.

372
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:01,434
- Wow.
- I know.

373
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,437
So how does it feel
to finally meet her,

374
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,606
to find out
that she even existed?

375
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,709
Like finding a family member.

376
00:21:14,181 --> 00:21:17,950
Well, she must be
very proud of you.

377
00:21:20,454 --> 00:21:22,054
Are there others of you
out there?

378
00:21:22,089 --> 00:21:24,290
Just Zach, as far as I know.

379
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,660
She thought he--

380
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:29,996
I think she saw
a little of me in him,

381
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:32,398
or who I used to be.

382
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:36,035
Focused, driven.

383
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,771
There's one big difference
though.

384
00:21:38,806 --> 00:21:40,940
He'd already killed
an innocent woman

385
00:21:40,974 --> 00:21:44,844
when I met him,
and now, he's killed another.

386
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:48,648
So he's a terrible student.

387
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,285
I wasn't exactly
a hands-on teacher.

388
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:56,689
He's fled to the Keys.

389
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:59,826
I can't have him...
out there in the world.

390
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,862
He's a problem
you have to solve.

391
00:22:07,668 --> 00:22:12,638
I was a problem you had to solve
too, and I escaped.

392
00:22:14,074 --> 00:22:17,210
How come you never
tried to find me?

393
00:22:17,244 --> 00:22:20,546
And do what?

394
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:24,283
Solve the problem.

395
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:29,489
I liked knowing
you were out there.

396
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,267
Elway, it's me.

397
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:43,603
Hey, I was just
about to call you.

398
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,538
So the dock master ends up being
a gabby little fuck.

399
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,974
Says he heard Mr. Castner
flew yesterday to New York,

400
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,243
sans Mrs. Castner,
who just sent the yacht

401
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:52,111
to St. Kitts earlier today.

402
00:22:52,145 --> 00:22:53,746
Where she is now
is anybody's guess, so--

403
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,715
I'll venture one, the Keys.

404
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,350
Okay, is this something else
you just know,

405
00:22:57,384 --> 00:22:58,584
or you actually have a source?

406
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,953
I'm on my way down there now
to check it out.

407
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,321
Listen, you know anything
about her husband

408
00:23:02,356 --> 00:23:03,523
being with her?

409
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,124
I thought you said
Castner was in New York.

410
00:23:05,158 --> 00:23:06,359
I checked the airport,

411
00:23:06,393 --> 00:23:10,463
and the gulfstream
never left the tarmac, so...

412
00:23:10,497 --> 00:23:12,231
I wonder if she killed him.

413
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,833
There's a leap.

414
00:23:13,867 --> 00:23:15,401
That's what she fucking does,
Elway.

415
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,837
She murders people
and she gets away with it.

416
00:23:17,871 --> 00:23:20,506
I cannot wait
to fucking find her.

417
00:23:20,541 --> 00:23:23,242
Okay, remember what I said.
No crusaders on the payroll.

418
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:24,310
Let's find her,
let's bring her in,

419
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:27,313
let's get paid, okay?
Thank you.

420
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:38,391
Shrimp?

421
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:40,693
Yeah.

422
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:43,496
Bottom feeders.

423
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,198
Uh-huh.

424
00:23:46,233 --> 00:23:49,635
They eat all the garbage
at the bottom of the ocean.

425
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:53,139
- They take out the trash.
- Mm.

426
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:57,643
Is that what you do?
You take out the trash?

427
00:23:57,678 --> 00:24:00,479
Thought might have
crossed my mind.

428
00:24:04,685 --> 00:24:07,219
You have all these clever
little sayings inside your head,

429
00:24:07,254 --> 00:24:11,324
don't you, about what you do
and who you are?

430
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:15,328
- Yeah, I think a lot.
- Mm, I'm sure you do.

431
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:20,499
So what brilliant turn of phrase
have you come up with

432
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:23,402
to describe me?

433
00:24:23,437 --> 00:24:26,372
The evil temptress?

434
00:24:26,406 --> 00:24:28,374
Passionate poisoner?

435
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,245
Fiendish florist.

436
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:42,254
No, really, when you're
lying in bed at night

437
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:46,158
and I happen to cross your mind,
what do you call me?

438
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:53,399
Hannah.

439
00:24:53,433 --> 00:24:57,069
You're just Hannah.

440
00:25:04,144 --> 00:25:06,779
You're such a flirt.

441
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:08,481
No, I'm not.
I'm just being honest.

442
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:11,450
Please,
you're the master manipulator.

443
00:25:11,485 --> 00:25:14,020
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

444
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,287
Is that what you call me?

445
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:19,525
No, I have
a million names for you.

446
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,128
Really?
I'd love to hear them.

447
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:32,238
What can I get you guys?

448
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:05,805
Are you sure this is the place?

449
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:16,382
Just wait in the car.

450
00:26:39,106 --> 00:26:42,108
What is all this?

451
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:06,031
"A" for effort, huh?

452
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:09,135
He made a lot of mistakes.

453
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,771
But for a first try,
it's not bad.

454
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:14,774
It's not bad.
No.

455
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:20,446
It's not great either.

456
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,015
Better than your first try.

457
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:27,386
Do you have to do this?

458
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,956
Yes, I do.

459
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:36,195
And when I find him,
I'll use this room.

460
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:45,037
- Detective Quinn.
- Hey, how are you holding up?

461
00:27:45,071 --> 00:27:49,942
I haven't slept much,
to be honest.

462
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:55,714
We, uh, talked about
a life together, Cassie and I.

463
00:27:55,749 --> 00:27:58,617
- I know it's fast, but--
- No, no, no.

464
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:02,121
I move fast too.
Too fast.

465
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:07,226
Well, when it's right.

466
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,195
Look, I know you're
going through a tough time.

467
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:13,999
I was wondering if you could
take a look at a photo for me.

468
00:28:14,034 --> 00:28:15,601
Have you seen that kid
around Cassie?

469
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,770
Maybe at her food truck?

470
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:21,273
Is this who you think
killed her?

471
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:25,311
Just a person of interest.

472
00:28:25,345 --> 00:28:28,180
I don't know him.

473
00:28:28,215 --> 00:28:31,584
He looks familiar, but...
I'm sorry.

474
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,234
What on earth
is your daughter doing?

475
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,737
She's just clearing the bad
murder juju out of the lab.

476
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,506
Does she realize
this is a department

477
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:57,076
founded in bad murder juju?

478
00:28:58,812 --> 00:29:01,380
Where are we on this
Cassie Jollenston murder?

479
00:29:01,414 --> 00:29:03,983
Been working on the customers
from her food truck,

480
00:29:04,017 --> 00:29:06,619
but most of them
paid in cash, so...

481
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,988
So they're hard to track down.

482
00:29:09,022 --> 00:29:10,422
Any other leads?

483
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,893
None worth talking about.

484
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:20,900
I thought you said you weren't
a real hands-on teacher.

485
00:29:20,934 --> 00:29:22,668
I didn't teach him this.

486
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:26,505
- You did this to him?
- Yes.

487
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:29,208
And he escaped.

488
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:31,944
I let him go.

489
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,481
Like me?

490
00:29:35,515 --> 00:29:37,783
Not quite.

491
00:29:40,754 --> 00:29:43,122
Dexter?
What the fuck?

492
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,524
Thought I told you to control
yourself, and what did you do?

493
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:47,526
- You killed Cassie.
- Cassie?

494
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,495
Who's--who's Cass--
who the fuck is that?

495
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:52,364
You killed her
next door to me--to my son!

496
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,467
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
I went after Shawn Decker.

497
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,569
- Shawn Decker, who is that?
- Wait.

498
00:29:57,604 --> 00:30:00,372
Are you that old guy's wife?
Your ex-girlfriend?

499
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,174
She's with me now.

500
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,044
N-nice.
Did you take out her husband?

501
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:07,046
What--ow!

502
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:11,583
Who is Shawn Decker?

503
00:30:11,618 --> 00:30:13,018
This asshole I knew
in high school.

504
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:14,920
He offed a girl two years ago
on spring break

505
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:17,056
and then bragged about it.
Is she cool?

506
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,459
Yes, she's cool.

507
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:22,061
Where were you two days ago?

508
00:30:22,095 --> 00:30:24,163
I stopped by your place
right after you blew me off,

509
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,764
and then I came straight here.
I--

510
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,666
I met your neighbor,
the hot one.

511
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,569
That was Cassie.

512
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:33,339
She--she was alive
when I left.

513
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,207
I've been on Shawn
the whole time.

514
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:38,243
I'll show you on my camera.

515
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:43,248
How did you--
how did you find me?

516
00:30:43,283 --> 00:30:45,184
I tracked your credit card.

517
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,186
Right.

518
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,688
Shouldn't use my own card,
total fuck-up on my part.

519
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,156
What'd you think of the room?

520
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,891
Wait, did you
do something to it?

521
00:30:52,926 --> 00:30:55,761
- Just show me the pictures.
- Sorry.

522
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:59,264
This is Shawn Decker.

523
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:02,267
He lives here.

524
00:31:02,302 --> 00:31:05,938
You can see by the time stamp,
I've been hunting him.

525
00:31:05,972 --> 00:31:11,510
So I decided
to go after a killer.

526
00:31:11,544 --> 00:31:14,213
Someone who deserves it.

527
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,317
He was following the code
without even knowing it.

528
00:31:18,351 --> 00:31:20,919
Do you have proof
that Shawn killed someone?

529
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:23,288
Yeah, he pulled me aside
at a party,

530
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:26,291
showed me this video of this
redhead he met in Daytona.

531
00:31:26,326 --> 00:31:31,430
He "accidentally" strangled her
while they were having sex.

532
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:36,168
Believe me, the world's
better off without him.

533
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,272
Where is Shawn now?

534
00:31:47,714 --> 00:31:50,916
It--it didn't go
exactly as I planned.

535
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,419
I thought I could just
knock him out.

536
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,721
You sedated me, didn't you?
What did you use?

537
00:31:55,755 --> 00:31:57,222
Tell me what happened
with Shawn.

538
00:31:57,257 --> 00:31:59,425
I hit him over the head,
but it wasn't hard enough.

539
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,529
He barely went down,
so I just kept hitting him,

540
00:32:03,563 --> 00:32:05,464
like, a lot.

541
00:32:05,498 --> 00:32:06,832
Did anyone see you?

542
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:08,534
No, we were alone.

543
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,836
What were you planning
on doing with the body?

544
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:14,540
I didn't totally know.
I...was gonna come back here,

545
00:32:14,574 --> 00:32:17,342
get my camera, my knives, and--
I don't know.

546
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:18,877
Guess I just thought,
drop him off in the Everglades

547
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:20,412
- on the way back.
- So you didn't have a plan?

548
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:22,347
I did have a plan.
I was gonna do it here.

549
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:24,383
I mean,
this place isn't bad, is it?

550
00:32:24,417 --> 00:32:26,585
You see that second floor?

551
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:29,321
Anyone could see you
moving the body.

552
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:32,191
- That wasn't on the website.
- Then pick a different place.

553
00:32:32,225 --> 00:32:33,992
I'd already paid for the room.

554
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:38,030
You need to have a plan
and a backup plan, always.

555
00:32:38,064 --> 00:32:41,066
Driving around with a dead body
in your trunk in this heat

556
00:32:41,101 --> 00:32:42,234
is no plan at all.

557
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:44,036
You didn't even
put plastic in your car.

558
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,805
Oh, okay, that would've been
a good idea, yeah.

559
00:32:48,308 --> 00:32:50,175
All right, you and I
are gonna deal with this body

560
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,111
and then scrub the car
clean of DNA,

561
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:55,581
because one drop of blood,
a single hair could lead

562
00:32:55,615 --> 00:32:57,916
straight back to you.

563
00:32:57,951 --> 00:33:00,686
Then after that,
we're gonna dump the car.

564
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,621
Well, how am I gonna get home?

565
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:05,090
We'll take you.

566
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,092
Awesome.

567
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:08,594
Can you deal with the room?

568
00:33:08,628 --> 00:33:10,108
We shouldn't be
more than a few hours.

569
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,098
Yeah, drive safe.

570
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,369
Dude.

571
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:21,073
Do not "dude" me.
Get in the car.

572
00:33:21,107 --> 00:33:22,908
Watch yourself
on the door handle.

573
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:25,944
I cut myself on that
piece of shit a few days ago.

574
00:33:28,314 --> 00:33:30,616
Have you cut yourself
on this handle before?

575
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:33,218
No.

576
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:36,054
Is that somehow
how Zach's blood

577
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:39,191
ended up under Cassie's nails?

578
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,694
I bled all over the place.

579
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,730
Look.

580
00:33:46,866 --> 00:33:49,568
Fuck me, gloves!

581
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:51,069
Just put your seat belt on.

582
00:34:09,189 --> 00:34:11,590
Hannah fucking McKay.

583
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,092
Don't even think about it.
Where's Dexter?

584
00:34:14,127 --> 00:34:15,827
- Out.
- Great, that'll make this

585
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:17,062
a lot easier.

586
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,264
I'm supposed to just
put those on?

587
00:34:19,299 --> 00:34:20,699
- You're under arrest.
- I don't believe

588
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,000
that you're a police officer
anymore.

589
00:34:22,035 --> 00:34:24,303
- Citizen's arrest.
- Oh, right, really?

590
00:34:24,337 --> 00:34:25,370
Well, how about I arrest you

591
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:27,105
for aiding and abetting
a serial killer?

592
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,807
You really want that information
getting out?

593
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:30,309
Talk all you fucking like.

594
00:34:30,343 --> 00:34:31,610
You don't have evidence
of anything,

595
00:34:31,644 --> 00:34:32,945
plus, no one would
fucking believe you.

596
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:35,180
Trust me, better people
than you have tried it.

597
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:36,481
- Go ahead.
- No!

598
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:38,116
The only way I'm leaving
is if you shoot me,

599
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:40,686
and we both know
you're not gonna do that.

600
00:34:42,655 --> 00:34:45,624
You know, I have done
some terrible things in my past,

601
00:34:45,658 --> 00:34:47,392
but I have come to realize
that as people,

602
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:50,128
we're all horribly flawed,
some more than others.

603
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:51,196
I'm not interested.

604
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:53,665
But we all have
a will to survive,

605
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,670
and when in extreme situations,
people do extreme things.

606
00:34:58,705 --> 00:35:00,639
That doesn't make it right.

607
00:35:00,673 --> 00:35:01,974
Sometimes, right or wrong

608
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:03,175
doesn't even make it
into the equation.

609
00:35:03,209 --> 00:35:05,310
Sometimes, there are
other forces driving us.

610
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:07,079
What's driving you?

611
00:35:07,113 --> 00:35:09,681
Dexter.

612
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,858
The passing of the torch.

613
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:22,828
I taught you the code.

614
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:24,730
Now, he's learning it from you.

615
00:35:24,764 --> 00:35:27,799
And look at him.

616
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:31,603
You used to feel like that
after a kill.

617
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:32,938
At peace.

618
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:35,774
Life was so simple then.

619
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:39,978
Killing consumed you,
crept into everything you did.

620
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,081
It was all you had.

621
00:35:43,116 --> 00:35:45,417
But now?

622
00:35:45,451 --> 00:35:47,486
Now, I have Harrison.

623
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,656
He isn't a complication.

624
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,225
Hannah is.

625
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:57,929
She's more of a...
distraction.

626
00:35:57,964 --> 00:36:02,334
Or is it possible there's
a stronger desire in you now?

627
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:05,337
Stronger than the need to kill?

628
00:36:13,146 --> 00:36:15,480
I don't enjoy killing.

629
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:17,049
Why do you do it?

630
00:36:17,083 --> 00:36:18,843
Because sometimes,
it's the only way I know

631
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:20,719
how to solve a problem.
When somebody comes at me

632
00:36:20,753 --> 00:36:22,621
or threatens me, my life--

633
00:36:22,655 --> 00:36:23,722
Like me?

634
00:36:23,756 --> 00:36:25,390
I could've killed you
the other day,

635
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,858
and it would've made my life
a hell of a lot easier,

636
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,794
- but I didn't.
- Why?

637
00:36:28,828 --> 00:36:31,997
Because I love your brother,
and I--and I've learned

638
00:36:32,031 --> 00:36:34,833
how much he cares about you,
and I didn't want to hurt him.

639
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:42,741
He loves me too.
Do you really want to hurt him?

640
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:44,743
Fuck.

641
00:36:48,881 --> 00:36:51,850
My brother screws up
everything.

642
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:04,529
Oh, you're both
still breathing.

643
00:37:04,564 --> 00:37:06,498
That's a good sign.

644
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:07,999
What are you doing here?

645
00:37:08,034 --> 00:37:09,434
I came here for her.

646
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:10,702
- But how did you--
- GPS.

647
00:37:10,737 --> 00:37:12,371
I put it
under your fucking car.

648
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:13,805
- You what?
- I knew you wouldn't

649
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,674
stay away from her.

650
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,042
Who the fuck are you?

651
00:37:17,076 --> 00:37:20,679
Who the fuck are <i>you?</i>

652
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:22,814
F--

653
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:24,049
Fuck it, I don't want to know.

654
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,851
I don't want to know
anything else ever.

655
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:28,520
She's your problem now.

656
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:32,758
Dude.

657
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,761
I'm sorry, you got girls
fighting over you?

658
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:41,733
Let's get out of here.

659
00:37:52,011 --> 00:37:55,013
Are we there yet?

660
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,421
Zach.

661
00:38:02,455 --> 00:38:04,623
Hey.

662
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,625
Zach, it turns out,

663
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,128
is a fast learner.

664
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,831
Well, I'm very relieved
to hear that.

665
00:38:12,865 --> 00:38:14,733
Why don't you come in,
have some dinner?

666
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:17,769
- I'm starving.
- I can't.

667
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:22,841
Who is that in the car?

668
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:24,843
That's Hannah.

669
00:38:24,877 --> 00:38:27,913
Hannah McKay?

670
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,481
And you weren't
going to introduce us?

671
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,716
Well, we've had
a really long drive,

672
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:33,785
and she's leaving
early tomorrow.

673
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,521
- I think we're tired.
- Surely, you must be hungry.

674
00:38:36,556 --> 00:38:38,190
She can join us for dinner.

675
00:38:38,224 --> 00:38:39,958
- No, that's not--
- I insist.

676
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:43,128
Either you invite her in
or I will.

677
00:39:09,655 --> 00:39:14,559
Dr. Vogel, uh...this is Hannah.

678
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:17,729
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

679
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:19,531
Call me Evelyn.

680
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:26,471
I trust there are
no vegetarians here.

681
00:39:26,506 --> 00:39:29,508
Hand me your plate.

682
00:39:30,776 --> 00:39:32,344
It looks delicious.

683
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:36,047
An old family recipe.
Hope it holds out.

684
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,583
I can pass it along to you
if you'd like.

685
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:41,319
I'm guessing you know your way
around the kitchen.

686
00:39:41,354 --> 00:39:42,654
I'm an okay cook.

687
00:39:42,688 --> 00:39:45,290
You're better than okay.

688
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:47,192
Well, I prefer gardening.

689
00:39:47,226 --> 00:39:52,063
Bringing things to life.
Perfect.

690
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,099
The best hobbies
are the ones that take us

691
00:39:54,133 --> 00:39:56,801
furthest from our primary
occupation.

692
00:39:58,971 --> 00:40:01,540
So you have
a fascinating field.

693
00:40:01,574 --> 00:40:05,544
How did you
get interested in it?

694
00:40:05,578 --> 00:40:10,181
Oh, an incident long
ago that I won't bore you with.

695
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:15,554
As to what keeps me
interested, well...

696
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:18,156
look around the table.

697
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:22,093
Elbows.

698
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:25,096
I've always maintained that
the greatest obstacle in life

699
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:28,433
isn't danger, it's boredom.

700
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:31,069
- Boredom?
- Mm, the battle against it

701
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:33,572
is responsible for most
of the events in the world,

702
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,073
good or ill.

703
00:40:35,107 --> 00:40:36,474
I'm convinced of it.

704
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:40,245
Anyway, my patients
never fail to surprise.

705
00:40:40,279 --> 00:40:44,082
They make life interesting,
thus, worth living.

706
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,055
For example,
I would never have imagined

707
00:40:50,089 --> 00:40:54,559
that the affection you two share
could be possible...

708
00:40:54,594 --> 00:40:57,228
for people like yourselves.

709
00:40:57,263 --> 00:41:01,166
You are obviously
quite taken with each other.

710
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,237
You both have
a healthy blush response.

711
00:41:06,272 --> 00:41:07,672
I'm embarrassing you.

712
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:09,841
Gee, you think?

713
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:13,845
The truth is,
you make a good couple.

714
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,814
And probably a bad one too.

715
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,317
Bon appetit.

716
00:41:23,322 --> 00:41:26,958
Mm, there's too much red wine.

717
00:41:26,993 --> 00:41:28,393
Yeah, there is.

718
00:41:28,427 --> 00:41:31,896
No, it's perfect.

719
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,932
Dexter, you haven't said much.

720
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:36,668
Something on your mind?

721
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,872
It's Cassie's murder.

722
00:41:40,906 --> 00:41:43,742
I doubt there's anything
this table can't handle.

723
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:51,349
The scene,
it doesn't make sense.

724
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:54,953
Did you take any pictures?

725
00:41:57,356 --> 00:42:02,293
Whoa.
It's just like Norma Rivera.

726
00:42:02,328 --> 00:42:05,463
Look at the blood.

727
00:42:05,498 --> 00:42:07,699
When someone's
bludgeoned to death,

728
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,968
blood is no longer just blood.

729
00:42:10,002 --> 00:42:14,305
It's cast-off blood,
atomized blood, pooled blood.

730
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,476
Different first names
but same family...

731
00:42:18,511 --> 00:42:23,081
with one story to tell.

732
00:42:23,115 --> 00:42:25,984
I found your blood
underneath Cassie's fingernails.

733
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:29,020
But Zach had nothing to do
with Cassie's murder.

734
00:42:29,055 --> 00:42:30,622
So how'd my blood end up there?

735
00:42:30,656 --> 00:42:33,892
I'm wondering if it came
from your car door handle.

736
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,094
You think someone could have
done that to your car

737
00:42:36,128 --> 00:42:37,429
on purpose?

738
00:42:37,463 --> 00:42:39,931
To set you up for her murder?

739
00:42:39,965 --> 00:42:42,534
Well, if so, they went to
a lot of trouble to frame you.

740
00:42:42,568 --> 00:42:44,335
And why would someone do that?

741
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:47,372
Money?

742
00:42:47,406 --> 00:42:51,676
You see?
Never a dull moment.

743
00:42:54,814 --> 00:42:58,516
Hey, look at this, full house.

744
00:42:58,551 --> 00:43:01,953
Welcome home.

745
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:03,621
Hey, buddy, what's that?

746
00:43:03,656 --> 00:43:06,458
- A zombie.
- Nice.

747
00:43:06,492 --> 00:43:08,493
I hope you don't mind
that we're here.

748
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:10,428
Not at all.

749
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,564
Something happen with Quinn?

750
00:43:12,598 --> 00:43:14,632
No, we're fine,
I just--

751
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:17,435
You're still shaken up
about Cassie.

752
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:19,304
Is it okay if we stay
with you tonight?

753
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:22,707
You two can stay here
as long as you want.

754
00:43:22,742 --> 00:43:23,808
Thanks.

755
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:25,310
Especially
if you're gonna cook.

756
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:27,479
Good.

757
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,233
What happened with our fugitive?

758
00:43:48,267 --> 00:43:50,935
Does it look like
she's handcuffed to my desk?

759
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:53,238
It does not.

760
00:43:53,272 --> 00:43:58,476
You couldn't find her,
so we will--we'll keep looking.

761
00:43:58,511 --> 00:43:59,751
Aw, fuck that,
Hannah's probably

762
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:01,780
left the country by now.

763
00:44:01,814 --> 00:44:03,114
It's a lost cause.

764
00:44:04,283 --> 00:44:06,918
What happened
to miss personal vendetta?

765
00:44:06,952 --> 00:44:09,587
She took your advice
and let it go.

766
00:44:09,622 --> 00:44:12,290
There's a lot of money in this.

767
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:16,227
I don't care about the money.

768
00:44:16,262 --> 00:44:20,932
What the fuck
are you doing here then?

769
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:22,700
I don't know.
I've been asking myself

770
00:44:22,735 --> 00:44:24,369
the same question, actually.

771
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:28,106
Okay, is there something
you want to say to me?

772
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,975
I'm not sure I'm cut out
to be a private investigator.

773
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:32,844
Bullshit.
Bullshit.

774
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:33,945
You're the best
I've ever worked with--

775
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:35,613
Given the kind of work
that we do,

776
00:44:35,648 --> 00:44:37,849
I'm not really sure
that I want it on my tombstone.

777
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,784
You know?
Fuck, sorry.

778
00:44:39,819 --> 00:44:41,019
I don't mean to offend you
or anything.

779
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,453
- I'm--
- It's all right.

780
00:44:42,488 --> 00:44:45,023
It's all right, it's all right.
Forget it, forget it.

781
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,491
I just want to wake up
every now and then

782
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:50,495
and feel like what I do matters
more than zeros on a paycheck.

783
00:44:50,529 --> 00:44:51,830
Gotcha.

784
00:44:51,864 --> 00:44:53,331
So what are you gonna do?
You--you gonna--

785
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:54,866
gonna go back
to being a cop again?

786
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,368
Is that what you're gonna do?

787
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,171
I don't know, maybe.
Yeah.

788
00:45:00,206 --> 00:45:03,041
You know, there's a reason
they call it a "public servant."

789
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,809
You want to put your life
on the line for slave wages,

790
00:45:04,844 --> 00:45:07,779
be my guest, but I'd advise you

791
00:45:07,813 --> 00:45:11,316
to think very carefully about
throwing away this opportunity.

792
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:19,624
Hannah, I wish you
the best of luck

793
00:45:19,658 --> 00:45:21,092
with, well, whatever's next.

794
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:23,194
Thank you.
And thank you for dinner.

795
00:45:23,229 --> 00:45:27,465
It's refreshing to see a girl
who can really eat.

796
00:45:27,499 --> 00:45:29,200
We have to go.

797
00:45:29,235 --> 00:45:31,202
Can you drop Zach off
at his home?

798
00:45:31,237 --> 00:45:32,704
Of course.

799
00:45:32,738 --> 00:45:34,739
- Can I drive?
- Not a chance.

800
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:37,642
My car's older than you.

801
00:45:42,681 --> 00:45:44,716
It's not too bad.

802
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,586
Yeah, it's nice.

803
00:45:55,895 --> 00:45:58,363
So I'll be by at 6:00
tomorrow to pick you up.

804
00:45:58,397 --> 00:46:00,064
- No, I'll take a cab.
- No, it's no problem.

805
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,399
I don't want to do this again.

806
00:46:01,433 --> 00:46:05,603
I-I can't do this again...

807
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,906
say good-bye.

808
00:46:10,509 --> 00:46:13,011
You need anything?
Are you hungry, or--

809
00:46:13,045 --> 00:46:14,579
We just ate.

810
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:20,451
I'm sure if I get hungry
there's room service here.

811
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,187
Probably.

812
00:46:23,222 --> 00:46:25,556
I'm just gonna shower
and go to bed, get up,

813
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:28,593
go to the dock.

814
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,896
Your plane leaves at 8:00.

815
00:46:31,931 --> 00:46:34,265
27 minutes later,
you'll land in Nassau.

816
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,302
Destroy your old passport.

817
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:42,407
From there...where you go
is up to you.

818
00:46:45,077 --> 00:46:47,912
Where do you think you'll go?

819
00:46:47,947 --> 00:46:50,615
Haven't decided.

820
00:46:50,649 --> 00:46:55,186
Argentina?

821
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,221
Maybe.

822
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:04,162
Will you let me know?

823
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,230
Yes.

824
00:47:08,567 --> 00:47:10,568
Okay.

825
00:47:13,906 --> 00:47:16,240
I'll wait to hear from you.

826
00:47:16,275 --> 00:47:18,977
Dexter, my passport.

827
00:47:19,011 --> 00:47:21,913
Oh, right.

828
00:47:21,947 --> 00:47:24,949
Almost forgot.

829
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:33,858
"Claire Thompson."

830
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:37,228
I guess I look like a Claire.

831
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:39,530
He assured me it's a name
that won't get flagged.

832
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,099
It's perfect.
Thank you.

833
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:44,602
And here's a "Claire Thompson"
credit card.

834
00:47:44,636 --> 00:47:47,972
- I have some cash too, so...
- When you land in Nassau,

835
00:47:48,007 --> 00:47:50,208
make your last withdrawal
as Maggie Castner.

836
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,343
Keep it under 10 grand.
Then I can talk you through

837
00:47:52,378 --> 00:47:54,312
how to set up
an international bank account.

838
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,720
You should go.

839
00:48:04,857 --> 00:48:06,524
I should go.

840
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:37,215
♪ Make your own kind of music ♪

841
00:49:37,249 --> 00:49:41,219

846
00:50:02,808 --> 00:50:07,078
Every contact leaves a trace.

847
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:10,882
Everything
and everyone we touch...

848
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,858
is changed in some way.

849
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,601
But the changes...

850
00:50:37,009 --> 00:50:41,012
they are never
what we anticipate.

851
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:47,051
That's right,
I believe Hannah McKay

852
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:51,088
was just in Miami going under
the alias of "Maggie Castner."

853
00:50:57,796 --> 00:50:59,797
Hannah.

854
00:51:08,574 --> 00:51:11,842
Don't go.

855
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:14,845
Stay with me.

856
