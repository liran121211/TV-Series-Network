2
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,803
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,037
I've come to believe

4
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:52,810
that the killer could be
one of my former patients.

5
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,042
He sent both packages to you.

6
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,378
Maybe he doesn't know
how to find me.

7
00:01:57,412 --> 00:01:59,080
- Yet.
- Well, I need to get to him

8
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:00,748
before he gets to me.

9
00:02:00,782 --> 00:02:03,417
- I've got my eye on Joey Quinn.
- Quinn?

10
00:02:03,452 --> 00:02:05,119
There's no way he can pass
that sergeant exam.

11
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,454
He'll pass.

12
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:08,289
I stuck my neck out
on the line for you.

13
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:10,458
You'd better not fuck this up.

14
00:02:10,492 --> 00:02:11,625
Lieutenant Morgan?

15
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,128
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Well, yes.

16
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:16,163
You're in a car, drunk,
with an open container.

17
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,400
- Quinn.
- Why did she call you?

18
00:02:19,434 --> 00:02:21,268
She's a friend.
I couldn't say no.

19
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:23,104
I mean, come on,
you used to fuck her.

20
00:02:23,138 --> 00:02:26,207
There is nothing going on
between me and Deb.

21
00:02:26,241 --> 00:02:28,042
I want to know if there
was anything unusual

22
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:29,581
about my father's death.

23
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,016
He killed himself, Dexter.

24
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,386
Harry walked in
on what he created,

25
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,088
and he couldn't live
with himself.

26
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:38,557
Trust me when I say that
there's a place in this world

27
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,558
for your son.

28
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,260
I told you, you're perfect.

29
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,428
How can you still say that

30
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,363
when you know
what I've done to Deb?

31
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,334
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

32
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,868
Your sister just confessed
to killing LaGuerta.

33
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:50,970
What?

34
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,504
I'm telling
the whole fucking truth!

35
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,706
There's nothing you can do
to stop me!

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,574
- Deb, please.
- Stop--!

37
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,910
I thought I could fix this,
but you're right--I can't.

38
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,913
I just keep making her worse.

39
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,816
Do you really think
you can help her?

40
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,253
Yes.

41
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:17,563
Stop!

42
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,365
Do it, Debra.
Shoot him.

43
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,936
This is not who you are.

44
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,206
You are a good cop.

45
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,440
You're a good person.

46
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:32,111
You're not like him.

47
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,614
Put him down!

48
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,349
It's true.

49
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,618
Everything she said.

50
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,087
You're a good person.

51
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,624
It's okay.
Do what you gotta do.

52
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,496
Dex...

53
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,389
Tell me what you saw.

54
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:18,857
I don't want to talk about it.

55
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:21,327
Debra, I brought you here
so we can begin to strip away

56
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:22,895
the power this place
holds over you.

57
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,689
Talking about it's
not gonna change anything.

58
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,700
Neither is continuing
to repress what happened here.

59
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,838
I'm not repressing shit.

60
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,909
And I sure as shit
don't need you to remind me

61
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,410
about what happened here.

62
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,546
You know, Dexter's
need to kill was born

63
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,548
in a container
much like this one,

64
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:45,551
and he's been trapped side
its walls ever since.

65
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,619
As a psychopath, he will
never be able to break free.

66
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:48,954
But you can,

67
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:52,358
by reliving the events
of that night over and over--

68
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,493
I killed him.

69
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,595
I shot Dexter
instead of LaGuerta.

70
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,464
That's what I saw.

71
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,065
Now, unless you're gonna
fucking handcuff me again,

72
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,333
I'd really like to go.

73
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,669
When you shot Dexter,
how did that make you feel?

74
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,406
Better. Worse.
I don't fuckin' know.

75
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,208
What does--what does it
even matter?

76
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,342
I mean, LaGuerta is still dead.

77
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,277
- What else could you have done?
- Arrested him.

78
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,546
Splendid, now your brother
is on death row. Go on.

79
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:16,682
- We could have run.
- Only to eventually be caught.

80
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:19,985
You go to jail, Dexter gets
the death penalty again.

81
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,621
Debra, you've become so obsessed
with the life you've taken,

82
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,822
you've forgotten
the life you saved.

83
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:25,524
Of course you're
fucking defending him.

84
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,526
You fucking created him.

85
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,927
You're using him to track
a serial killer.

86
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,764
This isn't about Dexter or me.

87
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:33,165
This is about
you getting better.

88
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,033
Maybe I don't fucking
want to get better.

89
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:36,168
I don't believe that.

90
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,642
Why the fuck
should I even trust you?

91
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,774
Why the motherfuck
do you even care?

92
00:05:41,808 --> 00:05:44,810
Are you upset?

93
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:48,514
Yes, I am.

94
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,982
Good.

95
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,353
At least you're no longer
avoiding your feelings.

96
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,688
We're done for now.

97
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:59,057
For today.

98
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,273
There are countless ways
to inflict

99
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,443
physical trauma
on the human body,

100
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,144
and sometimes
the deadliest wounds

101
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,814
are the ones we barely see.

102
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:23,649
They run deep,

103
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,985
like the ones
I've inflicted on Deb.

104
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,455
What are we looking at?

105
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,990
Well, most of the blows
are to her face.

106
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:34,460
There's some bruising
around the neck.

107
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,129
It doesn't look like
there was much of a struggle.

108
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,865
No signs of a break-in.

109
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,800
Yeah, given the lack
of defensive wounds

110
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:45,637
and the close proximity
of her attacker,

111
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,474
I'd say you're looking
for someone she knew

112
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,943
- we have a name?
- Norma Rivera.

113
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,245
Landlord said she lived here
by herself.

114
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,481
Just got off the phone
with the vic's employer.

115
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:56,949
She was a housekeeper
in Biscayne Bay.

116
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,017
- Nice zip code.
- Yeah, um...

117
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,419
they all said she had an ex

118
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,621
in and out of her life,
Roberto Sagastume.

119
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,790
Me and Miller can swing by
his place.

120
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,925
He had a record.

121
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,360
It's good to see you
taking the initiative,

122
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,996
like any good sergeant should.

123
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,265
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yo...

124
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,167
You got my test back?

125
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:19,104
You nailed it, bro.

126
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:21,340
Now wipe that stupid grin off
your face before Miller sees it.

127
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,308
Yeah--no, I've just
never been this happy

128
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,612
to get back a positive test,
you know?

129
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,180
What does my sister see in you?

130
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,948
Half-pint.
Before I forget,

131
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,083
there was this little hottie
asking for you

132
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,317
back at the station earlier.

133
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:35,087
And you seem surprised, why?

134
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,288
Said she'd come by later.

135
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,390
They always come back for more.

136
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:42,060
Hey.
Any word on Deb?

137
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,163
Yeah, Dr. Vogel says
she's still day-to-day.

138
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,299
Let her know
I was thinking about her.

139
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,635
I will.

140
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,637
She's gonna be okay.

141
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:59,778
Opening shop.
A run.

142
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,848
Caffeine.
All morning routines.

143
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,983
But lately, mine consists
of coming here,

144
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,852
waiting for the woman
I left my sister with

145
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,621
to do what I couldn't--
make Deb whole again.

146
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,757
- Thank you.
- How is she?

147
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,191
Well, you still remain
the focal point

148
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,028
of your sister's pain.

149
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,030
- I want to see her.
- No, I think it's better

150
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,698
you continue to keep
your distance for now.

151
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,233
It's been almost a week.

152
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,068
Dexter, I am still not sure

153
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:26,872
if your sister
has hit rock bottom yet.

154
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,211
What is it?

155
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,514
I just want you to prepare
for the possibility

156
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:40,018
that Debra may never be able
to have you back in her life.

157
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,453
No.

158
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:45,057
I won't...
just let her go.

159
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:04,109
So, have you had better luck
with our killer?

160
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,645
I crossed off three more
former patients from your book.

161
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,213
Who's next on the list?

162
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:12,484
- Chapter seven.
- A.J. Yates.

163
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:15,120
I'll check back in
once I check him out.

164
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,395
A.J. Yates.

165
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,664
According to Vogel's book,
he attacked a classmate

166
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,200
with a chair at 12.

167
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,570
Institutionalized at 15.

168
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,373
Seems Vogel tried to channel
his violent tendencies,

169
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,941
but he was beyond her help.

170
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,645
Eventually, he was transferred
to another hospital.

171
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,781
Now Yates seems to be
a productive member of society.

172
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:47,085
He's a bundler--
cable, phone, Internet.

173
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,122
But I need to know if murder
is part of the package.

174
00:10:01,901 --> 00:10:03,635
There's nothing here.

175
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,239
Nothing in Vogel's notes
about brain surgery.

176
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,676
His scar.

177
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,545
Is that the mark of one
of her "unconventional methods"?

178
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,163
Thanks for letting me
use the treadmill.

179
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,698
Better you than me.

180
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,433
I'm not much
for running in place.

181
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,805
Is that your shrink way
of saying that I have been?

182
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,874
Is it?
Care for some tea?

183
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:48,780
How about something stronger?

184
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,115
Come on, I just ran four Miles.

185
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:53,618
What's one beer?

186
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,188
The drinks and the drugs
were keeping you numb,

187
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,224
making the symptoms
of your PTSD worse.

188
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,893
Ass off the table.

189
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,435
How long are you expecting me
to stay here?

190
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:15,707
I see a lot of your father
in you.

191
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:22,714
Harry wrestled with the same
doubts regarding Dexter.

192
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:27,219
You're not as alone
as you might think.

193
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,124
Honestly, I don't see
what the problem is.

194
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,726
He had everything laid out
on his bedroom floor.

195
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,128
Dexter saw in the paper

196
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,430
how this guy got off
on a technicality,

197
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,565
so he was stalking him,
vetting him.

198
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,633
Even found a kill room

199
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:43,869
in an abandoned house
near the park.

200
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:45,537
Just how we taught him.

201
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:47,139
What did you tell Dexter?

202
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,740
That this guy
was too high-profile.

203
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,075
That he'd be missed,

204
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,477
and that Dexter
would have to wait.

205
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:56,815
He went along with
my decision...for now.

206
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,418
Is this ever gonna be right?
What we've done?

207
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,621
I mean,
Dexter isn't a kid anymore.

208
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,290
He's becoming a man.

209
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,858
He's gonna kill.

210
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,395
We knew that day was coming.

211
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:14,166
But what happens when
I finally tell him it's okay?

212
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,934
What happens when he finally
knows what it's like

213
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:18,570
to take another person's life?

214
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:21,640
The code will do
what it was designed to do--

215
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:23,842
allow Dexter to be
who he was meant to be.

216
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,811
But what if it doesn't?

217
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,712
What if the code
doesn't keep him in check?

218
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,980
What then?

219
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,850
What if this has all been
some horrible mistake?

220
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,152
Obviously, Harry
came around when he realized,

221
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,755
what else could he have done?

222
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:39,257
Locked Dexter away
in an institution?

223
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:43,261
Or do nothing until he took
an innocent life?

224
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,064
Or protect your brother,

225
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,333
giving him the tools
that he would need

226
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,336
to channel his urges.

227
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,173
The same way you protected
Dexter in that container.

228
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,975
It's not the same.
You're wrong.

229
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:00,111
- Deb.
- I can't just accept it.

230
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:04,216
I'm not like him.
I'm not like you.

231
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,853
Dexter--Dex--
Dexter is fucking Dexter.

232
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,221
Debra...

233
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,190
Harry did not make a mistake
saving Dexter's life,

234
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,892
and neither did you.

235
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,327
That night in the container,

236
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,597
Dexter was being exactly
who he was meant to be,

237
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,167
and so were you--
a loving sister.

238
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:28,673
- I--
- Will get through this.

239
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:39,050
- Can I keep that tape?
- Yes.

240
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,697
He had everything laid out

241
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,599
on his bedroom floor.

242
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,234
Dexter saw in the paper
how this guy

243
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:57,836
got off on a technicality--

244
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,910
Dexter, you shouldn't be here.

245
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,678
I was vetting Yates.

246
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,546
- What did you do to him?
- What are you going on about?

247
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,982
He has a scar on his head
exactly where your killer

248
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,085
has been harvesting
brain fragments.

249
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,788
Is he another one
of your little experiments?

250
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:18,423
We can talk about this,
but not here.

251
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:20,258
Not with Debra
in the other room.

252
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:30,735
An X-ray revealed a lesion
on Yates's brain.

253
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,705
I suspected it was contributing
to his violent behavior,

254
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,573
so I...

255
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,610
I suggested the new hospital
remove it.

256
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,212
I never knew whether
they even performed the surgery.

257
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,649
When I do what I do,
I have to know everything.

258
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:47,585
Sorry for the oversight.

259
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,854
Now, why don't you tell me
the real reason you're here?

260
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,091
You could have just called
for the scar.

261
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,061
Is it regarding what I said

262
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,630
about letting your sister go?

263
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,031
Dexter, I assure you

264
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,835
that I'm not judging
your relationship with Debra.

265
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,071
I'm just trying to manage
your expectations.

266
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,742
Why, because she thinks
I'm a monster?

267
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:12,544
You think I don't know
that I'm the one responsible

268
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,379
for the pain she's in?

269
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,148
That's why she's here with you.

270
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,084
You have to get her
to forgive me.

271
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:20,758
Whatever it takes,
you have to find a way.

272
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,487
I need her in my life.

273
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,456
- You need her?
- Yes.

274
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,392
I understand that you love
Debra, in your own way.

275
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,593
"In my own way."

276
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:32,998
But why do you think
you need her?

277
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,332
I just do.

278
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:38,203
Deb looks up to you.
Isn't that what you said?

279
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,371
She used to.

280
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,306
And that made you feel good
about yourself?

281
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,507
Yes.

282
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,908
Well, no wonder
you feel so lost.

283
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,643
Debra became a mirror,

284
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,512
reflecting a positive image
of yourself

285
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,681
that you used to balance out

286
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:52,784
with the notion of yourself
as a monster.

287
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,185
Now that mirror is cracked,

288
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,522
and the only reflection you see
is one of darkness.

289
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,392
You make it sound like
that part of me isn't real.

290
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,161
You are no monster.
You never have been.

291
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:06,064
Anyone on my table
would disagree.

292
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,565
Dexter, a monster,
by definition,

293
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,567
is outside of nature,

294
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:11,703
but you're a part of
the natural order of things,

295
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,271
with purpose, and value.

296
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,706
A right to exist.

297
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,107
And when you come
to accept that,

298
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,542
you'll no longer be dependent

299
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,412
on Debra, or anyone's,
validation.

300
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,880
I'll still want her in my life.

301
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,884
Want, but not need.

302
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,166
No van.
No Yates.

303
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,726
No one home.

304
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:34,219
"Monterey Nursing Home."

305
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,022
"Dad's 76th birthday."

306
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,960
It seems Yates found a way
to keep his family in his life.

307
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:45,563
Will I be able
to do the same with Deb?

308
00:17:45,598 --> 00:17:48,666
Vogel says I don't need her.

309
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,635
But if that's true,
will I be able to let her go

310
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:54,038
if that's what she needs?

311
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,552
Women's shoes.

312
00:18:49,028 --> 00:18:50,428
- Hello?
- It's me.

313
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,629
I'm at Yates's house.

314
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:55,166
- Have you found something?
- Women's shoes.

315
00:18:55,201 --> 00:19:00,004
Individual shoes, not pairs,
some of them older.

316
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,540
High heels are a far cry
from brains.

317
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,909
It's not exactly
your killer's usual M.O.

318
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:06,144
If you recall
when all this began,

319
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,112
I expressed my doubts
that this was the work

320
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,547
of someone new to killing.

321
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,916
Albert wouldn't be the first
to alter his methods.

322
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,486
Yeah, still, something
about it doesn't quite add up.

323
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,355
But, just to be safe,

324
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:18,890
I'm pulling prints
off the shoes.

325
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,992
I'll run them through
the station's database

326
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,728
for missing persons
and homicide victims,

327
00:19:23,762 --> 00:19:25,630
but they're only partials.

328
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,732
I won't expect anything back
until the morning.

329
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,501
And I have my son tonight.

330
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,136
Understood.

331
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:35,073
I'll let you know what I find.

332
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:51,990
Vogel.

333
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,993
She found herself a hero.

334
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,379
Hi.

335
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:15,513
Hello.

336
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,548
You must be Dexter.
I'm Cassie, 4-B.

337
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,751
And you're
in my kitchen because?

338
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,519
I'm a friend of Jamie's and
I ran out of laundry detergent.

339
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,687
Daddy!

340
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,489
I see you two have met.

341
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,757
I hope you don't mind.

342
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,326
Oh, who am I to deny
a neighbor clean clothes.

343
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,628
So, dinner's in the oven.
I'll see you in the morning?

344
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,563
- Sure.
- I'll walk you out.

345
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,632
- Mwah.
- Nice to meet you, Dexter.

346
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:37,135
You too.

347
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:39,871
Bye!

348
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:44,442
She's nice.

349
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,444
But does she have
a kissy-neck?

350
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,451
- I knew you would pass!
- I didn't.

351
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,053
Oh, thank you for that.

352
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,422
This one used to have
to write the combination

353
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,856
of his station locker
on his wrist

354
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,058
for a month
when he first got here.

355
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,726
So what?
My memory sucks.

356
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,795
All you needed
was the right encouragement.

357
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:05,363
I don't even want to know
what that means.

358
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:08,333
We're empty.

359
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,870
You know, I really am
so proud of you.

360
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,405
I couldn't have done it
without you.

361
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,207
You wouldn't believe
who was behind the wheel--

362
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,876
Debra Morgan, the former
Lieutenant of Homicide,

363
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:21,012
passed out, piss drunk.

364
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,347
Come on, Joey--
Joey, just let it go.

365
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,015
Man, I don't really know
who was fucked up more,

366
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,350
her or the parking meter
she ran over.

367
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,085
Hey.

368
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,586
How about a little
professional discretion?

369
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,089
Yeah, well, I believe
that we're off the clock.

370
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,524
No, I know, but you could
lower your voice, you know?

371
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,926
Yeah, sure.
No problem.

372
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,295
Thanks.

373
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:39,364
- Who's that guy?
- I don't know.

374
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,165
I think he used to bone her
or something.

375
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,769
Probably the way Morgan
made lieutenant--on her back.

376
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,505
- Fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey!

377
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,509
That's enough!

378
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:52,643
Enough, I said!

379
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,646
Enough!

380
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,819
What the hell happened?

381
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:04,222
Someone was defending
his ex-girlfriend's honor.

382
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:08,126
Get him out of here.

383
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,962
- You know what? It's fine.
- I'm sorry.

384
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,531
Let's just go.

385
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,366
Hey, how about a round
on the house?

386
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,636
- All right, lieutenant.
- Fuck.

387
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,043
So...we're good?

388
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,012
Mm.

389
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,488
- Ow, babe--babe, my ribs.
- Yeah?

390
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,491
Oh.
I'm so sorry.

391
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:49,367
Ow!

392
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,975
- How many, mister?
- Two.

393
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,278
One for me, and one for Dan.

394
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:01,646
Two it is.

395
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,383
Sorry I'm late.

396
00:23:05,417 --> 00:23:06,751
Who's Dan?

397
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,221
Pet elephant.
You don't see him?

398
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:14,892
You want some pancakes, Dan?

399
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:16,627
Eat up.

400
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,564
Make sure Dan doesn't
get any syrup on the couch.

401
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:21,065
Okay.

402
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,867
My car died.

403
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,470
That "check engine" light
I kept ignoring?

404
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:26,771
Apparently,
it means what it says.

405
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,239
How did you get here?

406
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,208
Angel.
But, don't worry.

407
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,943
My car will only be in the shop
for a few days.

408
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,177
I'm gonna see if Cassie
can give us

409
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,447
a lift to Harrison's preschool.

410
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:39,650
You know, you made quite
an impression on her last night.

411
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:40,751
Impression?

412
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,288
She's single.
Just sayin'.

413
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:46,357
Hey, why don't you
take the SUV?

414
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:49,060
It's safer.
I'll clear my stuff out.

415
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,328
If you can drop me off
at the station,

416
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,096
I'll pick up a car
from the motor pool.

417
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,731
Sure you don't mind?

418
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,767
I don't if Dan doesn't.

419
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,785
How did I let you talk me
into this again?

420
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,622
I believe your price
was one beer.

421
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,625
- So, now what?
- You tell me.

422
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,226
Isn't this where you think
you belong?

423
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,261
No.

424
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,395
Frankly, I'm quite amazed

425
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:25,463
that you think you ever left.

426
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:27,865
Are we really gonna do this?

427
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,368
Debra, you shut yourself
inside these walls

428
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:32,336
for the last six months,
doing your damnedest

429
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,438
to shut everything
and everyone out.

430
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,275
So, why don't we?

431
00:24:39,044 --> 00:24:41,045
What the fuck are you doing?

432
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,447
I want you to convince me
how killing Dexter

433
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,284
instead of LaGuerta
would be a better choice.

434
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,618
Open the fucking door.

435
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,820
LaGuerta.

436
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:51,422
She was on her knees,

437
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,391
where those blood stains are,
isn't that right?

438
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,227
She was your coworker,
your friend.

439
00:24:56,261 --> 00:24:58,563
Why didn't you just stay
at the party

440
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,132
and let Dexter take care
of everything?

441
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,833
I had to stop him.

442
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:05,703
But Dexter can't help
what he is.

443
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,739
He has no conscience,
unlike you.

444
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,908
You knew the moment
you pointed that gun

445
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,944
at LaGuerta it was wrong,

446
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,246
and still,
you pulled the trigger.

447
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,748
You shot a woman in cold blood.

448
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,451
You let her bleed out
and did nothing.

449
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:22,787
You shot an innocent woman

450
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:24,522
for simply doing her job.

451
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,690
Because of Dexter.

452
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,292
And that's what
terrifies you the most.

453
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,261
You so desperately
want to believe that

454
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,762
if you had just shot Dexter,

455
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,798
then you wouldn't
have to face the hard truth

456
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,133
that if you had to do it
all over again,

457
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,802
you'd still choose him.

458
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,637
Because in your heart,

459
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:43,975
you know you will always
choose Dexter.

460
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,520
How do I make it right?

461
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,925
By finally accepting
that you're a good person

462
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:04,595
who was forced to do
a terrible thing.

463
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:16,641
And that you made the best
of an impossible situation.

464
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,946
You can walk out that door.
You can move forward.

465
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:27,518
The choice is yours.
It always has been.

466
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,461
Oh, lieutenant.

467
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:40,131
- A word?
- Of course.

468
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,867
I was just reviewing
the sergeant's exam results,

469
00:26:42,901 --> 00:26:46,370
and it seems you were right
and I was wrong about Quinn.

470
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,706
Apparently, he can count
past his fingers and toes.

471
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,608
He was in the 85th percentile.

472
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,742
So was Miller.

473
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:55,179
In the 88th percentile,
to be exact.

474
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:59,016
I want you to strongly consider
making her sergeant.

475
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:02,153
Angie is good.
I like her, a lot.

476
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,988
But I'm still thinking Quinn's
the smarter choice--

477
00:27:04,022 --> 00:27:06,524
All I said was
"Strongly consider."

478
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,660
This is your first departmental
promotion as lieutenant,

479
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,696
and it will reflect
on your command.

480
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,863
That being said,

481
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:17,034
it's your decision
and yours alone.

482
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,785
Three hits off the partials,
all reported missing.

483
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,055
Janet Thorton,
taken two weeks ago.

484
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,024
Looks like Yates
killed these women,

485
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:42,793
but I still can't be sure
he's the one after Vogel.

486
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,695
Not until he's on my table

487
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,065
and we have
a little talk first.

488
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,376
Where are we on Norma Rivera?

489
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:00,878
- We're trying to find--
- Miller.

490
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,213
Address for the ex-boyfriend
is no good.

491
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,547
So far, nobody's seen him.

492
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:06,150
Got back the M.E.'s report.
They found semen.

493
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,753
I'm testing it to see if it's
a match for the ex-boyfriend.

494
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:09,987
Would explain
why he's off the grid.

495
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,889
She invites him over--

496
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:13,891
Things get heated,
he kills her, panics,

497
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:14,992
and goes on the run.

498
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,393
That's one theory, anyway.

499
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:17,528
Okay, let's find this guy.

500
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,196
- We're on it.
- "Dex'bose."

501
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,432
Favor--I need you to stay away
from the lab for a bit.

502
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,900
That little hottie
who's been looking for me

503
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,735
is coming up the elevator,
and we might need

504
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:25,770
a little alone time.

505
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,804
No problem.

506
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,639
Yeah, you would know
all about that.

507
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:30,641
You're better than that.

508
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:32,109
Come on, here.

509
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,978
There's a 20 in it for anyone
who directs her to my lab

510
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:35,312
and is cool about it.

511
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,315
- Done.
- Okay.

512
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,221
I'm on my own.
Perfect.

513
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,925
Angel.

514
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,800
I get it, okay?
You're pissed about last night.

515
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,929
I had to run a tab

516
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,498
so that asshole patrolman
wouldn't press charges.

517
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,900
Do you realize that if Matthews

518
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,234
would have caught wind
of this, he would've had

519
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,869
all the ammo he needed
to shoot down this promotion?

520
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:00,204
I'm sorry.
I lost my cool.

521
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,807
Well, I need my sergeant
to be able to keep his.

522
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,542
A bar fight?

523
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,977
Technically, your place
is a restaurant.

524
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,946
Come on, it's not like
you haven't done the same.

525
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,681
I mean, you put a guy
in the fucking hospital

526
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,950
for running his mouth about
how LaGuerta was using hers.

527
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,752
Allegedly.
And the difference is,

528
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,453
I wasn't up for promotion.

529
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:18,889
I had already made sergeant.

530
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,525
You want to fix this?
Solve this case.

531
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,239
Excuse me?
Are you Vincent Masuka?

532
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,343
The one, the only.

533
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:42,446
But, you can call me Vince...

534
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,415
just as long as you call.

535
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,150
Okay.
I'm Niki.

536
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:47,318
I'm a student
at "U" of "M."

537
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:49,019
Oh, yeah.
My Alma Mater.

538
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,655
Come in.

539
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,426
You must be majoring
in...beautiful.

540
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:03,000
- This is really hard.
- I know the feeling.

541
00:30:03,034 --> 00:30:06,604
I think you may be my father.

542
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:11,108
You were a sperm donor
in college, right?

543
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,077
Mm-hmm.

544
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,345
But you have curls.

545
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:17,381
Yeah, my mom.

546
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,820
Holy...

547
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:26,257
Oh, fuck.

548
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:30,594
This was a bad idea.
Sorry.

549
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,564
Okay, that's embarrassing.

550
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,598
It's okay.
No, don't worry.

551
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,066
It's okay, don't--

552
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:38,736
don't--don't--don't--

553
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,171
it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

554
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,373
Oh, my God.

555
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:46,410
You've got my soulful
yet haunting eyes.

556
00:31:02,294 --> 00:31:04,061
Night, Marty.

557
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:05,729
See you tomorrow.

558
00:31:05,764 --> 00:31:09,300
We do have filing cabinets,
you know.

559
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,435
This is kind of my process.

560
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:13,404
What are you even doing here?

561
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,873
I thought you
were taking time off.

562
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,743
Turns out, time off
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

563
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:20,911
I just wanted
to get a head start

564
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,981
on some of the cases
that you left for me.

565
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,883
Well, we're gonna need food.

566
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,818
- "We"?
- Yeah, we.

567
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:31,822
You look like you could use
a hand, and I'm starving.

568
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:38,162
You know, when I need a break,

569
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,597
I've got maybe two days
at the most.

570
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,233
And then I go crazy.

571
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,569
I end up right back here.

572
00:31:45,603 --> 00:31:48,238
What about you?

573
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,208
What makes you crazy?

574
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,913
- Family shit.
- Mm.

575
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:58,749
Nothing says family
like love...

576
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:00,684
and shit.

577
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:03,587
Unfortunately, my father
was an expert in the latter.

578
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:05,322
- Texas oil.
- Texas oil?

579
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,858
Mm.

580
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,594
Fuck, I hope I'm holding
my plastic fork correctly.

581
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:11,628
Exactly.

582
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,665
He was all rules, all the time.

583
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,934
My moving to Miami to be a cop,

584
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:17,968
that was about
the biggest "fuck you"

585
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:21,305
I could think of at the time.

586
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,619
I'm sure you understand
my dismay

587
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,807
when I got out of the academy
and I realized

588
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,142
it was nothing but rules.

589
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:27,177
Everybody there was probably
just like your father.

590
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:28,612
You know what
the worst part was?

591
00:32:28,646 --> 00:32:31,782
I knew I had made
a huge fucking mistake,

592
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,617
but there was no way in hell
I was gonna give him

593
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:36,220
the smug pleasure
of knowing he was right.

594
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:40,090
So I waited until he died,
quit the force,

595
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:43,160
and opened up this place.

596
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:45,429
Looks like you're doing
pretty well for yourself.

597
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,065
Trust me,
I'm still the black sheep.

598
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,867
The look on my mother's face
every time she goes

599
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,335
into the country club,

600
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:52,569
has to explain
to one of her friends

601
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,972
that her son is a P.I.?

602
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,707
That's gotta be pretty close
to priceless.

603
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,776
Mm.

604
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,613
My dad was everything to me.

605
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,550
I loved him.

606
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:11,889
And while he's not the man
I thought he was...

607
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,491
Well, I'm--

608
00:33:14,526 --> 00:33:18,495
I'm realizing we're
more alike than I thought.

609
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,600
To dead dads.

610
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,969
Long may they haunt us.

611
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,377
It's a better toast
if you open it.

612
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,116
I'm good.

613
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:46,390
Vogel says I'm not a monster...

614
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:48,926
but that's exactly
the part of me

615
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,463
she's expecting to remove Yates
as a threat.

616
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,271
A threat that seems
to have left in a hurry

617
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:04,274
and taken all his shoes.

618
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:23,127
Does this prove Yates
is who I'm looking for?

619
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,964
The only way
to know for sure is...

620
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:31,435
find where he's hiding.

621
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:05,449
He saw me here,
heard everything.

622
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,220
Bone saw.
Specimen jars.

623
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:30,894
His own cut-by-numbers guide.

624
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:32,930
Yates is the brain surgeon.

625
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,365
Vogel needs to know.

626
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:55,252
I know her.
I pulled her print.

627
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,123
Yates must have stabbed her,

628
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,792
nicked her left
pulmonary artery,

629
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,294
left her for dead,

630
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,330
unaware cramming her
inside that cart

631
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:10,567
would put pressure on the wound
and stop it from bleeding.

632
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,537
Now I have to do the same.

633
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:17,074
It'll hold, but not for long.

634
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:21,078
Do you think the girl
will be all right?

635
00:36:21,112 --> 00:36:23,192
She lost a lot of blood,
but I stemmed the bleeding

636
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,854
and I dropped her off
in front of the E.R.

637
00:36:24,882 --> 00:36:27,150
I got back here
as fast as I could.

638
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,520
Oh, God, has he been
doing all this because of me?

639
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:32,222
We can't know
until we find him.

640
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:35,959
Let's hope there's something
on here that'll tell me how...

641
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:42,065
These are patient files.

642
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,401
Your patient files.

643
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,670
That's not possible.

644
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,505
This last one's
dated just two weeks ago.

645
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,608
Dexter, don't.

646
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,248
What is this?

647
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,252
You were keeping notes on me?

648
00:37:02,287 --> 00:37:04,755
It's a journal.
I've always had a journal.

649
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,623
You were writing down
everything we did,

650
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:08,458
everything we talked about.
It's all in here.

651
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,060
I never used your name.

652
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,795
Yates, nor anyone else
for that matter,

653
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:12,896
could possibly know
who you are.

654
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,731
"Somehow, he's deluded himself

655
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:17,768
"into thinking his feelings
for his sister are genuine,

656
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:22,773
unaware there are no
real emotions behind them."

657
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:29,846
Dexter, I--
I never meant--

658
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,149
What am I, a subject
for another one of your books?

659
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:35,485
Is that what these are for?

660
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,455
Answer the question!

661
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:43,327
My notes...
it's how I process--

662
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,363
You were experimenting
on me with Harry,

663
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:49,366
and you still are.

664
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,870
I'm nothing but a lab rat,
just like Yates.

665
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,872
That's not true.
You know that.

666
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:58,675
Is that why you want
to keep me apart from Deb?

667
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,845
You know, just another way
to isolate your subject,

668
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,881
see what he'll do?

669
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,851
- Dexter--
- Don't.

670
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,758
When Yates is dead,
you are out of my life.

671
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,794
It's over.
You understand?

672
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:24,768
Or do you need
to write it down?

673
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,738
I understand.

674
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,204
I walked into the room, and--

675
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:36,339
- Go on, tell me.
- The blood.

676
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,742
Evelyn, there was
so much blood, on plastic.

677
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:42,012
Dexter had placed it everywhere.
The walls, the ceiling.

678
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,547
There was a table
in the middle of the room.

679
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:46,583
- A table with--
- The body?

680
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:47,851
Parts of one.

681
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,786
And when Dexter turned,
the look on his face--

682
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:52,289
he--he was so proud.

683
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:55,759
When--the man Dexter killed,
he was a drug dealer.

684
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:57,027
He murdered your partner.

685
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,595
He was going to get away
with it.

686
00:39:58,629 --> 00:39:59,863
But he was a person.

687
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,999
Who, according to the code,
deserved--

688
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,435
No one deserves
to be in pieces...

689
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,405
in bags.

690
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,741
The code is a theory, an idea.

691
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:15,445
But what I saw--
what Dexter did--

692
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,248
what we did!

693
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:30,627
I don't think I can live
with this.

694
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,769
Fuck, and I'm supposed to?

695
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:08,198
- Hello?
- Mr. Yates?

696
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:09,833
Yeah, that's me.

697
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,668
I'm afraid
we have some bad news.

698
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,004
Your father's heart is failing.

699
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:15,171
How bad is it?

700
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,940
We think
you should come quickly.

701
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,476
He might not have much time.

702
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:37,360
Dad.

703
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:39,462
I got here as fast as I could.

704
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,865
I'm right here.
Can you hear me?

705
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:51,608
It was you?

706
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:55,612
I was counting on you
being the good son.

707
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,655
They'll be here any second.

708
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,426
Room 26, code blue!

709
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,194
We're losing him.
We're losing him!

710
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,096
To save his own life,
Yates was willing

711
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:16,066
to take his father's.

712
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:21,104
Vogel believes I'm just like
all her other experiments--

713
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:24,608
a psychopath who can't
form real connections.

714
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,543
But she's wrong.

715
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:29,746
Deb isn't a prop, like Yates's
father was to his son.

716
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,984
She's more than a mirror.
She's family.

717
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:37,721
If I have a purpose, and value,
and a right to exist,

718
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:40,190
so do my feelings for Deb.

719
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:47,731
This experiment is over.

720
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,734
Vogel can go to hell.

721
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:53,503
Jamie packing you
a lunch these days?

722
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,904
It's for you.

723
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,106
I just came back
from Good Samaritan.

724
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,240
I need you to run the blood

725
00:42:57,274 --> 00:42:58,475
on the clothes
of a stabbing victim,

726
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,310
Janet Thorton.

727
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,512
- She still alive?
- Still in surgery.

728
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:03,847
And the son of a bitch
who stabbed her

729
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,749
broke all of her toes.

730
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,751
- How soon do you need this?
- Very.

731
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:09,953
On my way back to the hospital
now to get a statement

732
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,655
as soon as the docs say
she's out of the woods.

733
00:43:11,689 --> 00:43:13,089
Let me know what comes back
on those clothes.

734
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:16,092
Will do.

735
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:27,237
Deb.

736
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,405
What the fuck?

737
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,306
- Hey.
- Hey.

738
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,342
You here to see Dex?

739
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,277
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

740
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:36,613
Everything okay?
'Cause last time I saw you--

741
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,848
Yeah, I am sorry about that.

742
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:42,652
I'm so sorry I put you
in that position.

743
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,854
I'm sorry I got so mad at you
for calling Dex.

744
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:47,190
No, it's okay.
I mean, you asked me not to.

745
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:49,025
I was in a really bad place,

746
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,697
but, uh--you know, you were
just looking out for me,

747
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,700
like you always do.

748
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,637
Things are so easy with you.

749
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,639
I wish it was like that
with Jamie.

750
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:05,141
I just keep getting
tripped up, you know?

751
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,309
You all all right?

752
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,878
Eh, she's jealous.

753
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:12,849
She thinks there's
still something between us.

754
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:18,488
Make it work with Jamie.

755
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:21,357
I want you happy.

756
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:26,663
You mean so much to me, Joey.

757
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,968
Don't you fucking forget that.

758
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:37,507
Thanks.

759
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,641
You sure you're okay?

760
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,678
I gotta go.

761
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,849
Good-bye, Joey.

762
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,589
Deb.

763
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:59,496
The body forms scar tissue
to close a wound.

764
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,266
Has my sister
begun to do the same?

765
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,902
Eventually, scars fade.
Who knows?

766
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,737
With enough time,
you may not even remember

767
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:10,073
how you got them.

768
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:13,309
Dex.

769
00:45:13,344 --> 00:45:15,645
Hey, Deb.
What's up?

770
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,815
We should talk.
It's important.

771
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,417
Yates can wait.
My sister can't.

772
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,120
Sure, I'd like that.

773
00:45:24,155 --> 00:45:26,623
Just, not here.

774
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:29,659
Can we take a ride?

775
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,372
It's good to see you.

776
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,775
Vogel said it was best
I stay away.

777
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,111
What the fuck does she know?

778
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:52,115
If it's any comfort,

779
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:55,084
we're not on the best
of terms anymore.

780
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,920
She doesn't understand us,
Dexter.

781
00:45:56,954 --> 00:46:00,456
Exactly.

782
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,092
She said I might lose you...

783
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:07,096
but we'll always
be together, right?

784
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:16,306
Vogel had these DVDs
of her and dad.

785
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,474
Did she ever show them to you?

786
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:20,944
A couple.
You?

787
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,215
There was one
that was really interesting.

788
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:28,151
It was, um...
just before dad died.

789
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:32,055
It was his last session
with her.

790
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,765
Did dad kill himself?

791
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,206
Yeah.

792
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:53,977
A few years back,
Matthews told me the truth.

793
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:58,314
Harry OD'd on his
heart medication.

794
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:03,019
Was it because of you?

795
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,589
He thought
he had created a monster.

796
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:16,366
I think I know how he felt...

797
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,636
why he killed himself.

798
00:47:22,667 --> 00:47:25,008
But he only got it half right.

799
00:48:55,708 --> 00:49:06,480
