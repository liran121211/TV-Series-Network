1
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:49,193
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

2
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:51,329
How is Deb?
She's better?

3
00:01:51,363 --> 00:01:53,164
Yeah, she's great.
What case is she working on?

4
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,232
Briggs.
Andrew Briggs.

5
00:01:55,267 --> 00:01:56,434
Deb, what's going on?

6
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:57,835
I'm fucking getting close
to Briggs

7
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,236
so that I can get the jewelry

8
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:00,705
before he fences it, all right?

9
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:02,406
Deb, you haven't talked
to me in weeks.

10
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:05,176
Because you made me compromise
everything about myself

11
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,510
that I care about.

12
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:09,747
I shot the wrong person
in that trailer.

13
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,016
Don't stop.
Don't stop.

14
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,718
Joey, the chance that someone
might find out

15
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:15,920
our little secret makes it
even more fun.

16
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:17,521
You're all sweaty.

17
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:21,058
Yup. Just doing
a little cardio.

18
00:02:21,093 --> 00:02:23,194
- Oh.
- Looks like a piece of it

19
00:02:23,228 --> 00:02:24,595
has been scooped out.

20
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,230
That's the anterior
insular cortex,

21
00:02:26,264 --> 00:02:27,999
the portion of the brain

22
00:02:28,033 --> 00:02:29,834
that processes empathy.

23
00:02:29,868 --> 00:02:31,268
This is Dr. Evelyn Vogel.

24
00:02:31,303 --> 00:02:33,270
Evelyn is a neuropsychiatrist.

25
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:34,672
I hear the FBI calls her

26
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:36,540
the Psychopath Whisperer.

27
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:37,908
- What was he like?
- Who?

28
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:39,377
The Bay Harbor Butcher.

29
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:42,380
I look forward to working
with you, Dexter Morgan.

30
00:02:44,316 --> 00:02:46,350
Can you look into someone
named El Sapo for me?

31
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,352
- Who is he?
- He's a fucking fence.

32
00:02:48,387 --> 00:02:50,221
El Sapo isn't a fence.
He's a hit man.

33
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:52,590
He's gonna get the jewels,
and he's gonna kill Briggs.

34
00:02:52,624 --> 00:02:53,858
I'm trying to keep you
from getting shot

35
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:56,227
along with him.

36
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:59,230
I came here to save you.
Deb, look at yourself.

37
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:03,000
- You're lost.
- You are lost.

38
00:03:03,035 --> 00:03:04,201
Dexter.

39
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:06,437
I was hoping to share something
with you.

40
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,644
What is it you want?

41
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:15,980
You can't kill me.

42
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,249
Why?

43
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:21,919
Because I don't fit
Harry's code.

44
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,134
We're recording.

45
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:41,372
So, to review where we are,

46
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:42,406
two weeks ago, you told me

47
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:43,908
that your son Dexter

48
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:47,478
had asked to see
the actual scene of a homicide.

49
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:50,014
You also said that you opposed
this request.

50
00:03:50,048 --> 00:03:52,349
Yes.
Because he's only ten years old.

51
00:03:52,384 --> 00:03:54,351
So why are you here today?

52
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:57,021
He kept asking and asking,

53
00:03:57,055 --> 00:03:59,490
so I decided to give him
what he wanted.

54
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:01,726
I even started to hope
it might shock him

55
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,297
out of this...condition.

56
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:09,400
Tell me what happened.

57
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:10,868
I got a call about a homicide

58
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:11,902
in Coral Gables.

59
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:13,671
A woman had shot her ex-husband

60
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:16,941
as he was trying
to break into the house.

61
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:18,909
I waited until the forensic guys
had cleared out,

62
00:04:18,944 --> 00:04:21,345
and then I snuck Dexter
onto the scene.

63
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:26,016
The victim had fallen
through a sliding glass door,

64
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:27,618
so there was blood everywhere.

65
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:29,353
And it didn't seem
to faze Dexter.

66
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:30,788
And he wasn't bothered at all?

67
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:35,960
If anything, he was fascinated.

68
00:04:35,994 --> 00:04:38,662
He just stood there, staring.

69
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:45,402
Like he was admiring
a painting.

70
00:04:45,437 --> 00:04:47,872
I remember that day.
It was like a painting.

71
00:04:47,906 --> 00:04:50,040
And I wanted to be the artist.

72
00:04:50,075 --> 00:04:52,576
We didn't stay long,
and when we were driving home,

73
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:55,179
I noticed that...

74
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:59,049
Dexter was holding something
in his hand.

75
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:02,353
He'd stolen it
from the crime scene.

76
00:05:02,387 --> 00:05:05,156
A trophy.

77
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:12,563
I'm right about Dex, aren't I?

78
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:16,433
There's something wrong
with him.

79
00:05:16,468 --> 00:05:19,303
Not one to put it that way,
but I do agree

80
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:21,839
that Dexter is exactly
what you suspect him to be.

81
00:05:21,873 --> 00:05:24,208
Trust me when I say
that there's a place

82
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:26,443
in this world for your son.

83
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,913
I don't know what it is
or what form it will take,

84
00:05:28,947 --> 00:05:32,349
but we're gonna find it
together.

85
00:05:34,252 --> 00:05:35,452
You were only ten years old

86
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:39,757
when your father
first sought my help.

87
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,961
I know almost everything
about you, Dexter.

88
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:46,163
Not just because I heard it
from your father,

89
00:05:46,198 --> 00:05:49,934
but because I helped create you.

90
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:52,703
Create me.
You sound like Dr. Frankenstein.

91
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:56,273
Don't mean to.
Don't know how else to put it.

92
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,976
I mean, it was obvious
that you not only showed

93
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,246
all the classic traits
of a psychopath

94
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,116
but that you would eventually
become a killer.

95
00:06:06,151 --> 00:06:08,052
So we were faced
with a little dilemma--

96
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:10,988
what to do with you.

97
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:13,224
It was me who convinced Harry
that your urges

98
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:18,395
couldn't be stopped,
but they could be focused.

99
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,998
Eventually we realized
that hunting animals

100
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:24,268
wasn't going to satiate you,
so we decided

101
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:29,573
that you could be taught to kill
other kinds of animals.

102
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:31,909
People who truly deserve to die.

103
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:34,612
You're saying you came up
with the code?

104
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:36,580
Harry had a big hand
in the details.

105
00:06:36,615 --> 00:06:39,650
His law enforcement background
was certainly an asset,

106
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:44,054
but he was operating
under my guidance.

107
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:47,458
I can't help

108
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,960
but think of myself

109
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:53,530
as your spiritual mother.

110
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,966
I know we've only just met
face to face,

111
00:06:56,001 --> 00:07:00,104
but this is
kind of like a reunion.

112
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:02,172
I should have chilled
some champagne.

113
00:07:02,207 --> 00:07:04,041
You experimented on me.

114
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,809
That's what mothers do?

115
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:09,413
I developed a framework
for your survival.

116
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:11,382
That's what mothers do.

117
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:15,552
You made me what I am.

118
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:17,554
You'd have preferred
an institution?

119
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:18,989
Death row?

120
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,557
I could have turned my back
on you.

121
00:07:20,592 --> 00:07:22,126
I could have let Harry
do the same.

122
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,562
I could have even notified
the authorities.

123
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:27,932
Why didn't you?

124
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:35,272
Well, let's just say
you got under my skin.

125
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:37,775
I came to care for you, Dexter.

126
00:07:37,809 --> 00:07:39,843
I still do.

127
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,783
Why are you telling me this?

128
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:50,587
I saved your life.

129
00:07:50,622 --> 00:07:53,657
And I'm afraid I need
to call in the favor.

130
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,700
I'm sure you recognize this.

131
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:05,436
It's a section
of the human brain.

132
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,838
Anterior insular cortex.

133
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:10,975
A murder victim was missing
the same piece of tissue.

134
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:13,844
And this is it.
In the flesh.

135
00:08:13,878 --> 00:08:16,513
I found it on my doorstep
wrapped in butcher paper.

136
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:19,616
Unfortunately, there was
no return address.

137
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:21,285
Why would the killer
send this to you?

138
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,620
A message.

139
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:25,789
I've come to believe
that the killer could be

140
00:08:25,824 --> 00:08:28,892
one of my former patients.

141
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,627
This would be
the perfect explanation

142
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:31,895
for this little gift.

143
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,764
You think it's a threat.

144
00:08:33,798 --> 00:08:35,699
A brain on a doorstep.

145
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:38,402
Hardly a love letter.

146
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:51,281
Sooner or later,
someone's going to be holding

147
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:53,784
a piece of my brain in a jar.

148
00:08:56,454 --> 00:09:01,458
I want you to find him, Dexter.

149
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:06,363
And I want you to do what Harry
and I taught you to do.

150
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:11,535
I don't take requests.

151
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:13,203
You have contacts at the FBI.

152
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:14,338
You're working with Miami Metro.

153
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:15,606
Why don't you go to them?

154
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,074
I wish I could.

155
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:19,309
What's stopping you?

156
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:22,413
You're not the first
psychopath I've treated.

157
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:24,782
You taught other people
the code?

158
00:09:24,816 --> 00:09:27,217
No.
You're special.

159
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:29,887
But I've used
other unorthodox methods,

160
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:35,059
some of which
might be considered illegal.

161
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:38,295
So, if the police track down
this killer

162
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,563
and it's someone I treated--

163
00:09:39,597 --> 00:09:41,832
Your unorthodox methods
might be exposed,

164
00:09:41,866 --> 00:09:43,801
and your career would be ruined.

165
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,436
You might even go to jail.

166
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,704
You see my problem.

167
00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:50,707
I see that it's your problem.

168
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:03,587
This will help put things
into perspective.

169
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,892
Well, come on, don't tell me
you're gonna pass up

170
00:10:08,927 --> 00:10:11,261
on another piece
of your history.

171
00:10:17,936 --> 00:10:21,105
Think about it,
but don't take too long.

172
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:22,840
Killer's out there, Dexter,

173
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:27,511
and I don't mind admitting I'm
afraid of what's coming next.

174
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:33,250
♪ Make your own kind of music ♪

175
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:37,254
♪ sing your own special song

176
00:10:37,288 --> 00:10:40,691
♪ make your own kind of music

177
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:41,725
You don't deserve this,

178
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,927
but I don't have a choice.

179
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:47,498
I have to.

180
00:10:48,933 --> 00:10:51,502
Dexter killed someone else
last night.

181
00:10:51,536 --> 00:10:53,103
Who?

182
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:56,473
A drug dealer.

183
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:59,243
Guy robbed and killed
two of his clients.

184
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:00,410
College kids.

185
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:03,714
At least Dexter is following
the program.

186
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,717
He told me something new
that he did to the drug dealer

187
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:07,951
before he killed him.

188
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:10,354
And that was?

189
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:14,124
He made him look
at photos of his victims.

190
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,993
Interesting.

191
00:11:16,027 --> 00:11:19,163
Did you ask him why?

192
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:22,299
He said it was something
he felt he needed to do.

193
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:28,105
What do you think it means?

194
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:31,508
Humans are born
with an innate sense of justice.

195
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:35,812
Maybe Dexter
is discovering this.

196
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:38,348
The important thing is,
after three kills,

197
00:11:38,383 --> 00:11:40,317
he's embracing the process.

198
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:44,788
It's gonna work out
for him, Harry.

199
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:47,491
I hope so.

200
00:11:52,697 --> 00:11:54,298
She believed in you

201
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:56,433
at a time when I was in doubt.

202
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:00,204
Vogel gave me this DVD
to make me feel

203
00:12:00,238 --> 00:12:02,306
as if I owe her something.

204
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,007
Don't you?

205
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,543
If she's responsible
for creating me,

206
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:10,781
she's responsible
for what I've done to Deb.

207
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:12,783
Maybe Vogel can help you.

208
00:12:12,817 --> 00:12:15,485
Help me how?

209
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,121
With Deb.

210
00:12:18,156 --> 00:12:20,824
You must have told Vogel
a lot about Deb.

211
00:12:20,858 --> 00:12:23,260
She was part of your life.

212
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:24,661
I wish she still was.

213
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:28,365
Deb said she hated me,

214
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,801
that she should have killed me
inside that shipping container

215
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:31,768
instead of LaGuerta.

216
00:12:31,803 --> 00:12:34,171
Maybe I should just listen
to you,

217
00:12:34,205 --> 00:12:35,739
stay away from her.

218
00:12:35,773 --> 00:12:37,493
All I'm saying
is that Vogel might open up

219
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,243
some possibilities.

220
00:12:39,277 --> 00:12:41,111
At the very least,

221
00:12:41,145 --> 00:12:42,779
she's a window to your past

222
00:12:42,814 --> 00:12:44,147
that you just can't ignore.

223
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:46,783
I don't trust Vogel.
I can't.

224
00:12:46,818 --> 00:12:51,321
All the more reason
to keep her close.

225
00:12:56,027 --> 00:12:57,561
Okay, just so we're
on the same page,

226
00:12:57,595 --> 00:12:59,915
you're supposed to locate Briggs
and take him into custody.

227
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:03,333
So it's simple, right?

228
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:06,703
I was also supposed to find
the stolen jewelry, right?

229
00:13:06,738 --> 00:13:11,508
Recover the goods, collect 20%?

230
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,809
Am I supposed to believe
that's what you were doing

231
00:13:12,844 --> 00:13:14,044
for two weeks with Briggs?

232
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:15,846
Just looking for the jewelry?

233
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,915
Yes, Elway.

234
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,018
I mean, he wasn't
gonna just give it to me.

235
00:13:21,052 --> 00:13:23,086
It wasn't just lying
around the apartment.

236
00:13:23,121 --> 00:13:25,722
I had to play him.

237
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:34,031
What is that shit?
It looks like horse piss.

238
00:13:34,065 --> 00:13:37,134
It's an electrolyte
replenishment formula.

239
00:13:37,168 --> 00:13:39,269
You look dehydrated.
It impairs your judgment.

240
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:41,905
Probably fueling
that bad attitude.

241
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:48,011
So tell me, where does it say

242
00:13:48,046 --> 00:13:52,983
undercover work
in your job description?

243
00:13:53,017 --> 00:13:54,584
I was improvising.

244
00:13:54,619 --> 00:13:56,720
Well, you put one of my assets
at risk.

245
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,389
Namely yourself.

246
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:00,824
That's my call.

247
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:03,460
Well, your asset is just fine.

248
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:05,595
I wish I could say
the same thing about Briggs.

249
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,963
We're gonna go
through that again?

250
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:07,964
I thought I told you.
I don't know what happened.

251
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:11,068
I came back to our room,
and he was dead.

252
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:13,303
"Our room"?

253
00:14:13,338 --> 00:14:16,973
So you two were intimate?

254
00:14:19,644 --> 00:14:22,145
First of all,
who says "intimate"?

255
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,982
And second, what does it
even matter?

256
00:14:26,017 --> 00:14:27,217
I mean, what was I
supposed to do,

257
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:29,019
say, "Hey, Briggs,
can I have that jewelry

258
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:30,287
"that you stole,
'cause I'd love to get

259
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:33,590
the finder's fee on that too"?

260
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,425
I was doing my job.

261
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,626
If you were doing your job,
we wouldn't be sitting here

262
00:14:36,661 --> 00:14:38,295
with nothing to show for it.

263
00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:39,663
Well, we don't have nothing
to show for it.

264
00:14:39,697 --> 00:14:42,232
I found these on Briggs.

265
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:45,135
This looks like a key
to a storage unit.

266
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:47,003
I bet my ass that's where
he stashed the stolen jewelry.

267
00:14:47,038 --> 00:14:48,672
Why didn't you tell me that
in the beginning?

268
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:52,576
Because it's more fun
to watch you eat crow.

269
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,643
Take a bite.

270
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:55,746
We haven't found
the jewelry yet.

271
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,780
You could be wrong.

272
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:57,848
But what if I'm not?

273
00:14:57,882 --> 00:14:59,916
- Then we recover 20%.
- Right.

274
00:14:59,951 --> 00:15:03,787
And you'll love me for that.

275
00:15:05,356 --> 00:15:07,758
Another morning, another body.

276
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:11,294
Miami makes more corpses
than sunburns.

277
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:14,164
And I'm thankful.

278
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:15,999
A crime scene might be
the only place left

279
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:20,003
where I can still control
the chaos.

280
00:15:21,038 --> 00:15:22,439
Fuck me.

281
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:23,473
What does this guy think,

282
00:15:23,474 --> 00:15:24,441
he's a fucking brain surgeon?

283
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,610
The brain surgeon.

284
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:32,682
Anterior insular cortex is
missing just like the last one.

285
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:35,419
So we have a serial?

286
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:39,456
Vogel was right.

287
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,124
Judging from the lack of blood
around the head,

288
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,860
I'd say this one was done
post-mortem too.

289
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,031
No entry wounds.

290
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:55,605
Petechial hemorrhaging
around the eyes.

291
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,340
Bruising around the throat.

292
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,909
Asphyxiation.

293
00:15:58,943 --> 00:16:00,977
So, the last time,
the killer left

294
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:03,246
the murder weapon
somewhere near the body.

295
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:05,816
Maybe he did it again.

296
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,217
So what are we looking for?

297
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:09,519
Ropes, nylons,

298
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:10,887
giant pillow.

299
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:13,190
Okay, everyone spread out.

300
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:24,167
A plastic bag?

301
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:32,709
Not the worst way
to asphyxiate someone.

302
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,015
Blood?

303
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,751
I think I've got
a murder weapon.

304
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:44,721
Let's hope he left a print.

305
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:02,072
I got another delivery today.

306
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:04,007
Like the other?

307
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,775
Same section of the brain.

308
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,346
If it is one of my patients
who's doing this, I...

309
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,717
I have to wonder
if I could have prevented it.

310
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:16,186
You never felt guilty
about what I was doing?

311
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:19,122
No.

312
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:22,926
All I ever felt was pride.

313
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,095
- Pride?
- Mm.

314
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,430
You're not evil, Dexter.

315
00:17:27,465 --> 00:17:30,901
You're actually making the world
a better place.

316
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,437
Not for everyone.

317
00:17:34,472 --> 00:17:37,407
What do you mean by that?

318
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:43,613
I'm going back to the lab.

319
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:48,518
We might have a print,
which gives us a head start.

320
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:50,053
So you're going to help me.

321
00:17:50,087 --> 00:17:52,789
You don't seem surprised.

322
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:55,058
Like I said,
even though I've just met you,

323
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:57,928
I know you, Dexter.

324
00:17:57,962 --> 00:18:00,163
Better even than I knew Harry.

325
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:03,533
Why did he come to you...

326
00:18:03,568 --> 00:18:05,735
about me?

327
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,672
I was an expert witness
on a series of homicides

328
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:13,777
that he was working on,
and we became friends.

329
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:15,445
It's a long way

330
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:17,881
from being friends
to "I think my son might be

331
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:22,452
a serial killer."

332
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:25,021
Harry was aware of my work
on young psychopaths.

333
00:18:25,056 --> 00:18:29,025
And he also knew that
I didn't approach the subject

334
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,362
in terms of black and white,

335
00:18:32,396 --> 00:18:34,664
unlike my colleagues
of the time.

336
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:37,534
And so he just told you
everything.

337
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:41,805
You have to understand that
he had no one else to talk to.

338
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,444
Not Doris.
Certainly no one in the force.

339
00:18:47,478 --> 00:18:52,115
And there never was any judgment
on my part.

340
00:18:53,784 --> 00:18:56,553
Unlike you towards me.

341
00:18:56,587 --> 00:18:59,189
I'm not judging you.

342
00:18:59,223 --> 00:19:03,360
But you don't trust me.

343
00:19:03,394 --> 00:19:05,528
Which you should have expected.

344
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:08,365
Since you know me so well.

345
00:19:18,876 --> 00:19:21,111
You nervous?

346
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:23,780
About breaking and entering?
Absolutely.

347
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:26,416
Prison would put a real crimp
in my business model.

348
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,352
See, we're not breaking.

349
00:19:29,387 --> 00:19:31,888
We're just entering.

350
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:02,619
You really had sex
with this guy?

351
00:20:08,092 --> 00:20:11,428
Shit.

352
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,930
What?
What is it?

353
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:18,068
If--if I hadn't stayed
to try to get the jewelry,

354
00:20:18,102 --> 00:20:21,571
if I just brought him in,
he'd still be alive.

355
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:23,973
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

356
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:27,744
After all, it's a criminal
we're talking about, right?

357
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:29,713
He was actually all right
to hang out with.

358
00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:34,918
He made me forget about my
shitty life for five minutes.

359
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:37,287
And what exactly is so shitty
about your life?

360
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,481
Other than working for you?

361
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:39,589
Excuse me.

362
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:42,292
You left Miami Metro to come
and work for me.

363
00:20:42,326 --> 00:20:45,829
Wise career choice,
I might add.

364
00:20:45,863 --> 00:20:46,896
If you actually accepted
more cases,

365
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:48,765
you may get paid
what you're worth.

366
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:49,833
I left Miami Metro

367
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:51,468
because I was burned out.

368
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,002
Oh, right.

369
00:20:53,037 --> 00:20:55,071
Look, I know
that's a party line.

370
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:57,407
Everybody knows Maria LaGuerta
was a pain in the ass.

371
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,008
I completely understand
if you wanted to dip

372
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:00,110
- your toes in the private--
- What the fuck are you

373
00:21:00,144 --> 00:21:03,847
even talking about?

374
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:08,051
LaGuerta was a good cop.
She was a good fucking person.

375
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,719
All right, well, note to self:

376
00:21:09,754 --> 00:21:11,721
Never talk about anyone
Debra Morgan knows.

377
00:21:11,756 --> 00:21:14,557
Understood.
Got it.

378
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:15,759
Why don't you just be
really grateful

379
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:17,427
that I work for you?

380
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:20,263
Because I'm about to make you
a fuck-ton of money.

381
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:23,967
It's an unopened bill
from a storage facility.

382
00:21:24,001 --> 00:21:25,301
Why didn't FLPD find this?

383
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:28,271
Because it just arrived today.

384
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:29,986
Found a match for our key.

385
00:21:30,106 --> 00:21:32,592
Okay. Buster's still ***.

386
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:34,644
- Let's go.
- I can't.

387
00:21:34,678 --> 00:21:36,780
I've got a new client meeting
at the office.

388
00:21:36,814 --> 00:21:39,682
All right.
Then I'll go alone.

389
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:41,451
Okay.
Can you hang on?

390
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:46,589
Just--hey.

391
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:50,093
Hey.

392
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:51,928
Hey.

393
00:21:51,962 --> 00:21:54,497
Just do me a favor, all right?

394
00:21:54,532 --> 00:21:57,634
Just be careful.

395
00:21:57,668 --> 00:21:59,302
If I fuck up,
you can always ply me

396
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:02,906
with that electro-shite
solution.

397
00:22:17,154 --> 00:22:18,621
I'm running the prints
from the plastic bag

398
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:20,256
through A.F.I.S.
right now.

399
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:21,357
Any hits?

400
00:22:21,392 --> 00:22:22,992
Not yet, but if the killer's

401
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:24,460
on the list you gave me,
there's a pretty good chance

402
00:22:24,495 --> 00:22:25,795
he's already in the system.

403
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:30,667
It shouldn't take long.

404
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,602
Why don't I remember you?

405
00:22:32,636 --> 00:22:35,405
According to you, I was ten

406
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:37,740
when you started seeing Harry.

407
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:40,009
I should remember you.

408
00:22:40,044 --> 00:22:43,146
You never met me in person.

409
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,448
- Harry forbid it.
- Why?

410
00:22:45,482 --> 00:22:48,484
He didn't want you to feel
like you were--

411
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:51,287
like you were sick.
He was trying to protect you.

412
00:22:51,322 --> 00:22:54,324
And I respected his wishes,
even after he died.

413
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:58,628
I could have used someone
to talk to after Harry was gone,

414
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:00,496
someone who knew
what I was going through.

415
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:03,132
You wanted to talk about it?

416
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:07,904
I was young,
and I was all alone.

417
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:12,775
Here it is.

418
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,511
- Lyle Sussman?
- Sussman?

419
00:23:15,546 --> 00:23:16,826
He wasn't on the list
I gave you.

420
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:19,582
I don't know anyone
with that name.

421
00:23:19,617 --> 00:23:21,451
Well, that doesn't mean
he doesn't know you.

422
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:23,920
You're a published author.

423
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:26,055
But why would he
be targeting me?

424
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,991
Maybe he has an issue
with something you said

425
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,894
in one of your books.

426
00:23:30,928 --> 00:23:34,497
Arrested for drunk
and disorderly in 1992.

427
00:23:34,531 --> 00:23:38,334
Single.
Has a house on Messina.

428
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:40,436
Doesn't make sense.

429
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:43,339
Well, Sussman's print's
on the murder weapon.

430
00:23:43,374 --> 00:23:46,175
Forensics don't lie.

431
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,177
Mm, look on the bright side.

432
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:50,713
Maybe this means you did
a better job with your patients

433
00:23:50,748 --> 00:23:52,682
than you thought.

434
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:59,088
Oh.
Two great minds at work here.

435
00:23:59,123 --> 00:24:00,256
Am I interrupting?

436
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:02,125
No.
What's up, Vince?

437
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,961
Oh, well, guess who found
a bloody fingerprint

438
00:24:04,995 --> 00:24:07,563
on the duct tape that was
covering the victim's mouth.

439
00:24:07,598 --> 00:24:10,366
You?

440
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:11,534
And guess
who it might belong to.

441
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:13,102
The victim?

442
00:24:13,137 --> 00:24:14,370
Our killer.

443
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:17,073
It's a partial,
so it could take some time.

444
00:24:17,107 --> 00:24:19,375
How about you?
Anything on the murder weapon?

445
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,311
Partial.

446
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:24,981
Well, okay.
I guess the race is on.

447
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,553
Shit.

448
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:39,195
Why was it strange
that I needed someone to talk to

449
00:24:39,229 --> 00:24:41,130
when Harry died?

450
00:24:41,165 --> 00:24:45,101
People like you don't usually
seek an emotional connection.

451
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,672
Good luck.

452
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:07,323
It all looks innocent.

453
00:25:07,358 --> 00:25:09,959
Just like my apartment.

454
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,866
Nah.

455
00:25:33,717 --> 00:25:36,352
Either Sussman lost his green
thumb or he hasn't been here

456
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:38,488
in a while.

457
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:41,691
Could he be hiding out
at his next kill site?

458
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:49,966
A hunting cabin?

459
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,100
Isolated.

460
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:53,836
The perfect place for a kill.

461
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:55,505
Lake Nona.
It's a large lake,

462
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:57,840
but at least
it's a starting place.

463
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:34,377
Well, fuck.

464
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:11,114
You found my jewelry.

465
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:13,416
Really made my life easier.

466
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:15,918
Thank you for that.

467
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,593
What the hell's your problem?

468
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:28,331
Bitch.
Fucking nuts.

469
00:27:28,365 --> 00:27:30,399
Yeah, I'm fucking nuts.

470
00:27:34,037 --> 00:27:36,739
Stay down.

471
00:27:53,357 --> 00:27:56,292
You're lucky I don't kill
people unless I'm paid to.

472
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:45,041
I hope Sussman does
a better job of keeping in touch

473
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:46,509
with his mother
than I do with mine.

474
00:28:46,543 --> 00:28:49,045
Question: Any reason
why you haven't taken

475
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,480
the sergeant's exam?

476
00:28:51,515 --> 00:28:54,483
Uh, just haven't gotten around
to it.

477
00:28:54,518 --> 00:28:56,485
- Why?
- Matthews is riding my ass,

478
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,155
keeps pushing people on me--
Sanchez, Whitney.

479
00:28:59,189 --> 00:29:01,657
I'd rather have you.

480
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:04,994
I didn't know you cared.

481
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:07,863
You better start taking
your career more seriously, bro.

482
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:11,033
Especially if you gonna be
dating my sister.

483
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:13,402
How'd you know?

484
00:29:13,437 --> 00:29:16,205
Because I'm a good detective.

485
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,607
Why'd you try
to hide it from me?

486
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:22,078
I thought your head
would explode.

487
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:25,114
Just get your act together.

488
00:29:25,148 --> 00:29:29,085
If you want me to be okay
with you and Jamie, earn it.

489
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:30,453
Man up.

490
00:29:30,487 --> 00:29:34,757
Take the test.

491
00:29:37,127 --> 00:29:38,394
Do you have any idea

492
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:40,196
where your son might be,
Mrs. Sussman?

493
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,698
It's very important
that we speak with him.

494
00:29:42,733 --> 00:29:45,301
I haven't seen him for days.

495
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,203
Is that normal?

496
00:29:47,237 --> 00:29:48,938
Well, it's not out
of the ordinary.

497
00:29:48,972 --> 00:29:51,974
He's probably off hunting
for the weekend.

498
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:54,710
So he likes to hunt?

499
00:29:54,745 --> 00:29:56,879
Oh, he practically lives
for it.

500
00:29:56,913 --> 00:30:00,049
He always brings back something

501
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:03,052
for the quilt.

502
00:30:03,086 --> 00:30:05,087
Isn't this something?

503
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:09,225
It sure is.

504
00:30:10,427 --> 00:30:12,595
Ahh.

505
00:30:12,629 --> 00:30:15,298
Where does he go
on these hunting trips?

506
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:18,701
He has a cabin somewhere
outside the city.

507
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,236
Do you know the address?

508
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,937
No. Sorry.

509
00:30:21,972 --> 00:30:23,673
That's all I know.

510
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:25,274
What did you say
this was about?

511
00:30:25,309 --> 00:30:27,276
We just want to ask him
a few questions.

512
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:28,944
That's all, Mrs. Sussman.

513
00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:30,379
Well, I wish I could help you,

514
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:31,614
but I don't know
what else to tell you.

515
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:35,451
Oh, you need some more.

516
00:30:35,485 --> 00:30:38,087
Excuse me.

517
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:43,426
Can we go?

518
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,061
That fucking quilt
is freaking me out.

519
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,296
It's like a nightmare in fur.

520
00:30:52,002 --> 00:30:54,837
It's dispatch.

521
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:56,706
Damn.

522
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,808
Lake Nona will have to wait.

523
00:30:58,842 --> 00:31:01,744
Hopefully not for long.

524
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:11,620
What's the word, Vince?

525
00:31:11,655 --> 00:31:12,922
Borborygmus.

526
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,324
The sound of gas rumbling
through your intestines.

527
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,427
As in seriously regretting
having that super-green

528
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:22,131
passion fruit smoothie
right about now.

529
00:31:22,165 --> 00:31:23,999
Gunshot to the head.

530
00:31:24,034 --> 00:31:25,368
I call and raise you
one to the chest.

531
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:28,371
One in the dash
and one in the headrest.

532
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:30,106
Either the killer was panicky

533
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,408
or he really needs some time
at the gun range.

534
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:34,477
Car's registered
to a Javier Guzman.

535
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:35,778
You think that's him?

536
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:38,147
Based on Guzman's rap sheet,
be my guess.

537
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:40,850
Small-time enforcing,
murder.

538
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:44,420
Went by the street name
of El Sapo.

539
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:52,541
El Sapo was the hit man
sent to kill Briggs.

540
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,864
If he's been killed...

541
00:31:57,334 --> 00:32:00,302
is Deb in danger?

542
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,740
Dexter Morgan.

543
00:32:04,775 --> 00:32:07,877
Dexter Morgan.
Want to get with the program?

544
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:09,879
Dex?

545
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:12,815
How do you think
this went down, Morgan?

546
00:32:12,849 --> 00:32:16,619
Uh, yeah, sorry.

547
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:17,787
Driver pulls to a stop,

548
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:19,188
the assailant
approaches the car,

549
00:32:19,222 --> 00:32:21,991
most likely gun already drawn,

550
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:25,394
the vic sees the shooter,
pulls his weapon,

551
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:28,798
clears the holster,
but it's too late,

552
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:31,267
the gunman opens fire.

553
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:32,802
I got a second gun
in the glove.

554
00:32:32,836 --> 00:32:35,171
Bag it and tag it.

555
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:41,811
El Sapo's blood is confined
to the inside of his car.

556
00:32:41,845 --> 00:32:43,379
This can't be his.

557
00:32:43,413 --> 00:32:45,314
The killer might have been
reaching into the car

558
00:32:45,348 --> 00:32:47,316
and cut himself.

559
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,719
Dex.

560
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:55,558
El Sapo. Deb was involved
with these guys.

561
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:56,859
If someone's taking 'em out...

562
00:32:56,893 --> 00:33:00,029
I know.
I'm on it.

563
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,764
I don't understand, Dexter.

564
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:03,833
You think you know
where Sussman's cabin is,

565
00:33:03,867 --> 00:33:05,034
but you're not going after him.

566
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,535
I have to do something first.

567
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,939
What's more important
than stopping this killer?

568
00:33:09,973 --> 00:33:11,841
My sister.

569
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:14,410
- Debra's in trouble?
- Yes.

570
00:33:14,444 --> 00:33:17,012
Ah, that's what's been eating
at you.

571
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:20,816
I'm coming up on her house.
I have to hang up.

572
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,575
Jesus, Deb.

573
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,229
The fuck are you doing here?

574
00:34:09,099 --> 00:34:11,734
- Deb.
- I don't want you around.

575
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:15,271
I thought I made that
really fucking clear.

576
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,474
El Sapo is dead.

577
00:34:20,911 --> 00:34:23,078
El Sapo?

578
00:34:23,113 --> 00:34:24,713
The man who was sent
to take out Briggs.

579
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:28,050
I know who the fuck that is.

580
00:34:28,084 --> 00:34:29,919
Well, someone shot him
in his car.

581
00:34:29,953 --> 00:34:31,253
It looked like an execution.

582
00:34:31,288 --> 00:34:35,591
Do you know anything
about this?

583
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:39,061
All I know is what my head
feels like right now.

584
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:43,299
I tried calling.

585
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,234
I was worried about you.

586
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:48,938
That's touching.

587
00:34:48,972 --> 00:34:50,739
I'm fine.

588
00:34:50,774 --> 00:34:54,944
Fine isn't the first word
that comes to mind.

589
00:34:54,978 --> 00:34:57,680
And anybody could have walked
in here.

590
00:34:57,714 --> 00:35:02,785
The door wouldn't close,
so I had to get creative.

591
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:05,955
What happened?

592
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:13,963
Deb, what happened
to your side?

593
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:18,467
El Sapo followed me
to the storage unit...

594
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:23,973
where Briggs kept his stash,
you know.

595
00:35:24,007 --> 00:35:25,240
We tussled, he got the stuff,

596
00:35:25,275 --> 00:35:26,442
end of story.

597
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:28,010
Except it's not the end
of the story.

598
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:30,312
El Sapo's dead.

599
00:35:30,347 --> 00:35:33,682
Better fucking ending.
He deserved it.

600
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,618
And if whoever killed El Sapo
comes after you?

601
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:38,387
Nobody's coming
after me, Dexter.

602
00:35:38,421 --> 00:35:40,990
How do you know that?

603
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,996
Will you not do this, please?

604
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:50,366
What?

605
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,901
Give a shit.

606
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,174
Deb, I'm your brother.
You can hate me if you want,

607
00:35:59,209 --> 00:36:02,177
but it doesn't change the fact
that I care about you.

608
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:12,688
I didn't want to hate you.

609
00:36:16,326 --> 00:36:18,727
I wanted the opposite.

610
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:27,369
But it didn't work out that way.

611
00:36:29,372 --> 00:36:32,775
I can't change the way I feel.

612
00:36:32,809 --> 00:36:34,877
Will you--
will you go, please?

613
00:36:34,911 --> 00:36:38,681
I'm not leaving you.

614
00:36:38,715 --> 00:36:40,349
Jesus fucking Christ, Dexter,

615
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:44,186
get the fuck out.

616
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,522
Go.

617
00:37:00,203 --> 00:37:02,304
Deb doesn't want my help,

618
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:05,074
and Vogel is demanding it.

619
00:37:10,113 --> 00:37:13,816
This is it.
Sussman's cabin.

620
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:19,888
At least I'm staying
ahead of Miami Metro.

621
00:37:43,146 --> 00:37:45,948
Sussman's no stranger
to blood and death.

622
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:48,684
Vogel is wrong. Everything
points to him as the killer.

623
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,684
Except this.

624
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,453
Maybe Sussman had an accomplice

625
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:26,121
who decided to take him out.

626
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:29,158
A killer like Sussman
doesn't use an accomplice.

627
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:30,159
They're rogues.

628
00:38:30,193 --> 00:38:31,560
He could be the exception.

629
00:38:31,594 --> 00:38:33,996
Yeah, or just the innocent
victim like the first two.

630
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,531
Sussman's fingerprints
were on the murder weapon.

631
00:38:35,565 --> 00:38:37,355
He must have been involved.

632
00:38:37,475 --> 00:38:39,154
Sit down, Dexter.

633
00:38:39,414 --> 00:38:41,226
You're getting agitated.

634
00:38:41,524 --> 00:38:44,840
I'm just trying
to figure this out.

635
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:46,809
You have a hard time
admitting that you're wrong,

636
00:38:46,843 --> 00:38:48,043
but it's all right.

637
00:38:48,077 --> 00:38:50,345
People like you
have an inherent need

638
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,613
to be right,

639
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,449
to feel superior.

640
00:38:54,484 --> 00:38:55,684
You keep talking about me

641
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:59,888
like I'm some kind
of alternate species.

642
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,024
Like I'm less than human.

643
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:04,693
On the contrary.

644
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:07,462
Have you read any of my books?

645
00:39:07,497 --> 00:39:09,164
I haven't gotten around to it.

646
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,300
Well, if you had, you'd know
that I believe

647
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:16,572
that psychopaths
are not a mistake of nature.

648
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:17,940
They're a gift.

649
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:20,142
A gift?

650
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:22,144
They're Alpha wolves,

651
00:39:22,178 --> 00:39:24,913
who helped the human race
survive long enough

652
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:28,183
to become civilized.

653
00:39:28,218 --> 00:39:31,486
An indispensable demographic.

654
00:39:42,932 --> 00:39:45,167
You believe that?

655
00:39:45,201 --> 00:39:48,704
Did you know that psychopathic
traits can be found

656
00:39:48,738 --> 00:39:51,206
in the most successful CEOs?

657
00:39:51,241 --> 00:39:53,709
In the most effective
politicians?

658
00:39:53,743 --> 00:39:56,612
Without psychopaths,

659
00:39:56,646 --> 00:40:01,950
mankind wouldn't exist today.

660
00:40:01,985 --> 00:40:03,485
Well, there's a lot of mankind
that doesn't exist

661
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:05,787
because of them.

662
00:40:05,822 --> 00:40:08,790
Every silver lining...

663
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:19,434
Well, one of your
indispensable demographics

664
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:23,238
is still out there killing.

665
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:25,307
And we're back to zero.

666
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:29,044
You'll find him, Dexter.

667
00:40:29,078 --> 00:40:31,380
I have faith in you.

668
00:40:35,919 --> 00:40:41,456
So what's going on with Debra?

669
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:43,258
That's between me and her.

670
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:45,627
It's affecting you.

671
00:40:45,662 --> 00:40:48,764
So it makes it a problem
for me too.

672
00:40:48,798 --> 00:40:52,701
We're not going
to talk about Deb.

673
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:56,104
Whatever you want.

674
00:41:10,086 --> 00:41:11,219
Should I come back later?

675
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:13,155
Sorry.

676
00:41:13,189 --> 00:41:17,326
I was just checking to see
if Dexter called.

677
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,262
He was looking in on Deb.

678
00:41:20,296 --> 00:41:21,763
Deb?

679
00:41:21,798 --> 00:41:24,006
- Yeah.
- Wow.

680
00:41:24,126 --> 00:41:26,594
We're a whole ten seconds
into the date.

681
00:41:26,629 --> 00:41:28,758
Here I thought we were gonna
make it to one minute

682
00:41:28,878 --> 00:41:30,332
before you mentioned
your old fiancee.

683
00:41:30,366 --> 00:41:32,734
What are you talking about?

684
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:35,603
Joey, you're always
checking in on her

685
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:36,971
or talking about her.

686
00:41:37,006 --> 00:41:38,239
I mean,
since we've been together,

687
00:41:38,274 --> 00:41:39,574
you're, like, on Deb patrol.

688
00:41:39,608 --> 00:41:41,343
No, I'm not.

689
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:43,311
Okay.
We'll do an experiment.

690
00:41:43,346 --> 00:41:45,914
Let's see if you can go
one whole day

691
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,615
without mentioning Debra Morgan.

692
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,352
What is it with you people?

693
00:41:50,386 --> 00:41:52,320
- I mean--
- What people?

694
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:53,788
I got your brother on my ass

695
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:55,623
about taking
the sergeant's test.

696
00:41:55,658 --> 00:41:57,459
You're on my ass about Deb.

697
00:41:57,493 --> 00:41:59,094
I mean, like, what is this,
a fucking Cuban thing?

698
00:41:59,128 --> 00:42:00,648
What does Angel have
to do with this?

699
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:02,297
He knows we're seeing
each other,

700
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:05,166
and now he's on my ass about
making something out of my life.

701
00:42:05,201 --> 00:42:06,401
"Man up.
Take the sergeant's test."

702
00:42:06,435 --> 00:42:07,802
You know what, it's like,

703
00:42:07,837 --> 00:42:08,937
maybe I don't want to make
something out of my life.

704
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:10,105
Wait, how does Angel know

705
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:12,307
that we're seeing each other?

706
00:42:12,341 --> 00:42:13,808
And what is so wrong
about trying to better yourself?

707
00:42:13,843 --> 00:42:17,645
See?
That's what I'm talking about.

708
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,848
You know what?
Screw this.

709
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:22,684
Okay? I did not get dressed up
to argue with you.

710
00:42:22,718 --> 00:42:25,887
Go drink by yourself.

711
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:27,922
Ja--

712
00:42:35,965 --> 00:42:37,665
Why the hell can't you stay
out of my personal life?

713
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,667
What'd I do?

714
00:42:39,702 --> 00:42:41,669
Angel, you know
exactly what you did.

715
00:42:41,704 --> 00:42:43,238
Okay, you're putting pressure
on Quinn.

716
00:42:43,272 --> 00:42:45,540
We just had a giant argument
because of you.

717
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:46,674
Now wait a second.

718
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:48,076
You know what,
I hope you're happy.

719
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:55,016
It's, like, mind your own
fucking business, Angel.

720
00:42:59,255 --> 00:43:01,389
If this finds El Sapo's killer,

721
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:04,159
it'll keep Deb safe.

722
00:43:21,744 --> 00:43:23,912
It's Deb's blood.

723
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:30,118
She killed El Sapo.

724
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:33,087
Shot him in his car.

725
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,092
Deb.

726
00:43:38,127 --> 00:43:41,963
Deb.

727
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:44,999
What is she doing here?

728
00:43:45,034 --> 00:43:47,535
Morgan.

729
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:50,138
Sir.

730
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:52,040
I never got a chance
to tell you how disappointed

731
00:43:52,074 --> 00:43:53,775
I was that you left the force.

732
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:56,978
From running Homicide
to chasing down bail jumpers.

733
00:43:57,012 --> 00:44:00,014
A hell of a career trajectory.

734
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:02,383
It's not what you think.

735
00:44:02,418 --> 00:44:05,386
I hope it was worth it.

736
00:44:09,792 --> 00:44:11,526
Debra Morgan?

737
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,495
As I live and breathe.

738
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,465
If I were to cop
a feel right now,

739
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,766
it wouldn't be
sexual harassment anymore.

740
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,104
- Hey, stranger.
- Hey.

741
00:44:23,138 --> 00:44:24,772
What brings you around?

742
00:44:24,807 --> 00:44:28,943
Um, Quinn had some questions
about a case, so...

743
00:44:28,978 --> 00:44:31,279
Is this about El Sapo?

744
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:34,082
Well, he's probably grabbing
some coffee.

745
00:44:37,553 --> 00:44:40,321
Every morning when I come in,

746
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:43,758
I walk past it,
I have to turn around.

747
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:46,127
'Cause I still think of it
as Deb's office.

748
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:49,297
Nah, you probably should have
gotten it first, you know.

749
00:44:49,331 --> 00:44:52,467
I never really belonged there.

750
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:53,868
You know that's B.S.

751
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:57,705
This place ain't the same
without you.

752
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,875
We're having some drinks
at Papa's tonight.

753
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,343
You should come.

754
00:45:02,378 --> 00:45:05,680
Yeah, I'll try to make it.

755
00:45:05,714 --> 00:45:08,249
Hey.

756
00:45:08,284 --> 00:45:09,784
Thanks for coming in.

757
00:45:09,818 --> 00:45:12,420
Come on.

758
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:22,797
I, uh...

759
00:45:22,831 --> 00:45:24,365
I would have used
the briefing room,

760
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,466
but it's taken.
I mean, this is fine,

761
00:45:25,501 --> 00:45:26,868
though, right?

762
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:30,872
Otherwise fucking everybody'd
still be hugging you.

763
00:45:30,906 --> 00:45:32,807
Do you want to maybe go
to the coffee truck?

764
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,475
No, let's just--
let's do this.

765
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,944
Okay.

766
00:45:41,183 --> 00:45:44,586
El Sapo and Briggs.

767
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,922
What do you want to know?

768
00:45:47,957 --> 00:45:50,458
Basically, we've hit a wall.

769
00:45:50,492 --> 00:45:53,161
I was hoping you could open up
some leads for us.

770
00:45:53,195 --> 00:45:54,862
What can you tell me?

771
00:45:54,897 --> 00:45:59,067
Um, I was doing a skip-trace
on Briggs.

772
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:01,135
He robbed a jewelry store
and made off with, like,

773
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,271
a $1/2 million in merchandise.

774
00:46:03,305 --> 00:46:06,007
I got a tip
that he was in Fort Lauderdale.

775
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:09,077
And I was staking him out
and overheard

776
00:46:09,111 --> 00:46:11,212
that he was gonna fence
the stuff to El Sapo.

777
00:46:11,246 --> 00:46:14,415
Isn't a skip-trace one of
those locate-and-bring-'em-back

778
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,018
type of things?

779
00:46:17,052 --> 00:46:19,787
Yeah, I was also trying
to get a fix on the goods.

780
00:46:22,191 --> 00:46:24,359
What happened
the night Briggs was killed?

781
00:46:24,393 --> 00:46:27,328
Um...

782
00:46:27,363 --> 00:46:31,666
he was supposed to meet El Sapo
that same night.

783
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,602
I thought they were gonna be
a few hours,

784
00:46:34,637 --> 00:46:38,573
so I went to get a sandwich,
and when I came back,

785
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:42,644
FLPD was on the scene, and...

786
00:46:42,678 --> 00:46:45,713
Briggs had a fucking hole
in his chest.

787
00:46:45,748 --> 00:46:48,650
Is she lying to protect me
or to protect herself?

788
00:46:48,684 --> 00:46:50,118
I can't tell anymore.

789
00:46:50,152 --> 00:46:52,086
Look, I was just wondering

790
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:53,621
if you could take a look
at what we've got,

791
00:46:53,656 --> 00:46:55,356
maybe we could put
our heads together,

792
00:46:55,391 --> 00:46:57,525
push this thing down the field,
you know.

793
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:59,994
Like old times.

794
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:06,415
So what we think is

795
00:47:06,535 --> 00:47:08,549
the shooter approached
the vehicle

796
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:10,113
from behind...

797
00:47:12,775 --> 00:47:17,045
and then El Sapo drew his gun.

798
00:47:20,482 --> 00:47:23,918
And then the shooter...

799
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,291
Hey, are you all right?

800
00:47:30,325 --> 00:47:33,394
Sorry.
Family emergency.

801
00:47:33,429 --> 00:47:34,796
I got to borrow my sister.

802
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,799
Sure.

803
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:45,940
Thanks.

804
00:47:56,385 --> 00:47:59,087
What, Dexter?

805
00:47:59,121 --> 00:48:03,624
I know you killed El Sapo.

806
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:06,327
I found your blood
at the crime scene.

807
00:48:12,201 --> 00:48:13,901
Fuck.

808
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:16,938
Tell me what happened.

809
00:48:21,043 --> 00:48:22,210
Talk to me, Deb.

810
00:48:22,244 --> 00:48:23,811
I don't know what happened,
all right?

811
00:48:23,846 --> 00:48:25,980
I'm a little fucking fuzzy
on it.

812
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:34,088
I was angry.
I wanted the jewels back.

813
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:38,493
And the next thing I know
I'm standing over a dead body.

814
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:41,195
You shot at him four times.
You don't remember any of it?

815
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:42,997
He'd just beaten
the shit out of me.

816
00:48:43,031 --> 00:48:46,734
I was a little fucked up.

817
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:49,003
Why didn't you call the police?

818
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:55,276
I didn't know
what I could tell them.

819
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,045
You could have called me.

820
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:00,181
You're the one that gets me
into trouble, not out of it.

821
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:01,482
Is that why you lied to me?

822
00:49:01,517 --> 00:49:04,185
All of a sudden we have
a problem with lying?

823
00:49:12,694 --> 00:49:15,062
We found a gun
in El Sapo's glove box.

824
00:49:15,097 --> 00:49:18,065
Is it yours?

825
00:49:21,103 --> 00:49:24,605
Shit, it might be, yeah.

826
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,677
He took it off of me
before he beat me up.

827
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:34,315
It'll be traced to you.
How will you explain that?

828
00:49:35,617 --> 00:49:37,885
You could switch it out.

829
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,655
Get rid of it.

830
00:49:45,494 --> 00:49:47,829
What if I weren't here
to cover your ass?

831
00:49:51,066 --> 00:49:55,536
You really want to play
the "what if" game?

832
00:49:55,571 --> 00:50:00,107
What if you weren't
a serial killer?

833
00:50:00,142 --> 00:50:02,376
What if Harry had left you in
that fucking shipping container?

834
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:03,811
- That's enough.
- You know what, El Sapo's

835
00:50:03,846 --> 00:50:05,646
not the first person
I fucking shot, Dexter.

836
00:50:05,681 --> 00:50:07,815
And he may not be
the fucking last.

837
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:09,817
What's that supposed to mean?

838
00:50:09,852 --> 00:50:11,652
Anything can happen
in this hellhole

839
00:50:11,687 --> 00:50:13,988
that is now my life.

840
00:50:14,022 --> 00:50:16,524
Your gift to me, Dexter.

841
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:17,758
She's right.

842
00:50:17,793 --> 00:50:19,827
Whoever Deb was
before killing LaGuerta,

843
00:50:19,862 --> 00:50:22,230
that person is dead.

844
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:26,934
I just wish I knew
what's taken her place.

845
00:50:30,606 --> 00:50:32,506
Busy day?

846
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:33,841
Crazy busy.

847
00:50:33,876 --> 00:50:35,910
Then maybe they haven't tested
Deb's gun yet.

848
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:52,627
I've covered evidence
for myself

849
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:56,898
more times than I can remember.

850
00:50:56,932 --> 00:51:01,102
But I'll never get used
to doing this for Deb.

851
00:51:24,192 --> 00:51:25,927
You and Jamie patch things up?

852
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:27,161
How did you know
we were fighting?

853
00:51:27,195 --> 00:51:31,098
- Because I'm a good--
- Detective, right.

854
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:34,902
Yeah.
The sergeant's test?

855
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:35,937
Yeah?

856
00:51:35,971 --> 00:51:38,372
I'm gonna start studying
for it.

857
00:51:38,407 --> 00:51:40,875
Okay.

858
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:43,544
You gonna make
an okay sergeant.

859
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:46,247
If not, I'll demote your ass.

860
00:52:27,389 --> 00:52:30,424
Dr. Vogel says that
psychopaths are not a mistake

861
00:52:30,459 --> 00:52:33,260
of nature, they're a gift.

862
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:37,498
But what kind of gift destroys
everything it cares about?

863
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:46,107
Hello?

864
00:52:46,141 --> 00:52:48,876
Dexter. I think there's
someone inside my house.

865
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:50,444
How do you know?

866
00:52:50,479 --> 00:52:53,547
Well, I just walked up,
and the front door is open.

867
00:52:53,582 --> 00:52:56,384
Get in your car and stay there.

868
00:53:15,337 --> 00:53:18,906
If someone was inside when you
called, he's still in there.

869
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,309
I haven't seen anyone leave.

870
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:23,744
Wait here.

871
00:53:23,779 --> 00:53:26,547
Thank you, Dexter.

872
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:39,026
Are you sure
there's no one inside?

873
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:41,529
I checked the entire house.
I'm sure.

874
00:53:41,563 --> 00:53:45,099
That DVD, it's not mine.

875
00:53:48,103 --> 00:53:50,538
Put it in.

876
00:54:14,062 --> 00:54:15,763
He was coerced.

877
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:21,535
And now he's dead.

878
00:54:26,641 --> 00:54:28,275
I was wrong all along.

879
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:31,278
You were right.

880
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:33,547
Sussman was never a real killer.

881
00:54:33,582 --> 00:54:38,085
He's just another victim.

882
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,720
I should have listened to you.

883
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:42,857
You were only doing
what you thought was right.

884
00:54:42,891 --> 00:54:44,758
We had no idea that--

885
00:54:44,793 --> 00:54:47,895
You should have no idea.
You've never done this before.

886
00:54:47,929 --> 00:54:52,066
Me, it's what I do.

887
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:56,670
The one thing
I've always been good at.

888
00:54:56,705 --> 00:55:00,708
Vetting, stalking,
and killing people.

889
00:55:03,678 --> 00:55:07,615
I can't even do that anymore.

890
00:55:11,386 --> 00:55:13,420
What you're feeling now,

891
00:55:13,455 --> 00:55:16,924
it's not because of the killer.

892
00:55:20,629 --> 00:55:24,431
I've...

893
00:55:24,466 --> 00:55:27,334
destroyed Deb.

894
00:55:29,905 --> 00:55:32,873
She's gone.

895
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:40,347
You were wrong about me.

896
00:55:40,382 --> 00:55:43,651
I'm a mistake.

897
00:55:43,685 --> 00:55:47,988
You're exactly
what you need to be, Dexter.

898
00:55:56,598 --> 00:56:00,167
You're perfect.

899
00:56:09,353 --> 00:56:20,004
