00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,650
Previously on <i>Dexter...</i>

3
00:01:48,816 --> 00:01:52,446
<i>It's no accident
that Zach Hamilton is here.</i>

4
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,322
<i>He's drawn to blood, like me.</i>

5
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:57,242
And the arterial spurting here

6
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,834
indicates that the killer severed

7
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,270
the carotid artery
with the first stab.

8
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,916
I'm promoting Miller to Sergeant.

9
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:06,083
Are you fucking kidding me?

10
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,961
You actually made me want this,

11
00:02:08,127 --> 00:02:09,838
and now you're gonna take it away.

12
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,513
I just did a little research on you.

13
00:02:12,638 --> 00:02:14,718
You checked into me...
like a criminal.

14
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,678
Hey, Niki...

15
00:02:16,844 --> 00:02:18,485
Dexter, this is Oliver.

16
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,223
- Oliver, Dexter.
- Nice to meet you.

17
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,142
Yeah, you too.

18
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,937
Zach Hamilton killed Norma Rivera.

19
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,361
He deserves to die.

20
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:30,275
Isn't that a little intolerant
coming from you?

21
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,528
What if you were
to teach Zach the code?

22
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,530
Maybe it's time to see

23
00:02:35,696 --> 00:02:37,537
if the experiment will work.

24
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:40,619
What possibly makes you think
Zach could be taught the code?

25
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,995
I see something in him.

26
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,122
Why were you going
to kill your father?

27
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,208
Because he's killing my mother.

28
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,710
She's drinking herself to death
because of him.

29
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,129
You killed because you want to kill.

30
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:53,507
You should just go ahead and kill me.

31
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,287
Why?

32
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:57,589
'Cause if you don't,
then I will do it again.

33
00:02:57,714 --> 00:02:58,887
I can't help it.

34
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:03,328
<i>Am I ready to be a spiritual father?</i>

35
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,726
Hey, are you okay?

36
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:08,563
- I don't feel so good.
- Deb?

37
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:14,152
Hello, Dexter.

38
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:19,699
Remember me?

39
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,834
Hello?

40
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,669
<i>Dexter?</i>

41
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,171
<i>I was just about to leave you
another message.</i>

42
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:51,606
<i>Where have you been all morning?</i>

43
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,435
<i>The last thing I remember is...</i>

44
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,078
<i>Hannah.</i>

45
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,780
<i>Is everything all right?</i>

46
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,408
<i>Not if Hannah got to Deb.</i>

47
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,786
I can't really talk now.

48
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:08,655
I just thought you should know
that Zach Hamilton called.

49
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,543
I'm so glad you decided
not to kill him, Dexter.

50
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,461
I have to go.

51
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:16,298
Deb, are you okay?

52
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,883
Dex, where the fuck are you?

53
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,457
Just a sec.

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,515
I'm outside of Kendall.
Are you alone?

55
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,505
Why wouldn't I be?

56
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,560
Why are you
on the other side of town?

57
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,353
I need you to come pick me up.

58
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,520
Are you okay to drive?

59
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,679
I think so.
I mean, who the fuck knows?

60
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:37,649
I woke up on the floor
feeling like shit.

61
00:04:37,774 --> 00:04:39,151
You were gone.

62
00:04:39,276 --> 00:04:41,948
What the...
What the fuck is happening?

63
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,822
<i>Just come pick me up.</i>

64
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:45,123
<i>I'll text you the location.</i>

65
00:04:45,248 --> 00:04:47,783
<i>We'll talk when you get here.</i>

66
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:50,362
<i>Hannah drugged us,</i>

67
00:04:50,487 --> 00:04:52,896
<i>left me stranded
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

68
00:04:53,021 --> 00:04:56,087
<i>If she's come back because she
wants one or both of us dead,</i>

69
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:59,227
<i>then why are we both still here?</i>

70
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,932
It was Hannah, wasn't it?

71
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,433
It was.

72
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:12,449
I saw her before I blacked out,

73
00:05:12,574 --> 00:05:14,584
but then I woke up here.

74
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,274
She must have drugged our food.

75
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,289
If Hannah poisoned us,
why didn't she kill us?

76
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:20,523
Who the fuck knows, Dexter?

77
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:21,958
Maybe we were supposed to eat more.

78
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,326
Or maybe she just wants
to let us know she's out there.

79
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:26,651
Maybe this was just the beginning.

80
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:30,165
If we were normal people, Dexter,

81
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,268
we would go
to the U.S. Marshal Service.

82
00:05:33,393 --> 00:05:35,471
We can't do that.
She knows everything about me.

83
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:36,671
Yeah, but she didn't talk about you

84
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:37,921
the last time she was arrested.

85
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,575
Because she was in love with me.

86
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,544
Drugging me and leaving me
on the side of the road

87
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:47,115
might suggest that's changed.

88
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,885
So what the fuck
are we supposed to do?

89
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:54,854
There are
traffic surveillance cameras.

90
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,756
She had to have passed them.

91
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:58,291
I'll put in a request
for the footage,

92
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,401
get a license plate.

93
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:08,768
I thought this part
of my life was over.

94
00:06:08,893 --> 00:06:09,828
So did I.

95
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,041
The moment I asked you to kill her

96
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,176
was the moment that I started
to lose myself,

97
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:20,255
and I'm just starting to get back.

98
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:26,185
I don't want to deal with this.

99
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,386
I want her gone.

100
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:30,390
Deb, I'll take care of this.
I promise.

101
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,752
<i>Hannah... just thinking about her
throws me off course.</i>

102
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,891
<i>I have to put in a request
for the traffic footage.</i>

103
00:07:16,852 --> 00:07:18,897
Zach, what are you doing here?

104
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,769
You were supposed to meet me
at 10:00 this morning.

105
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:21,691
I've been waiting all day.

106
00:07:21,857 --> 00:07:24,069
- You could have been followed.
- By who?

107
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,042
Oh, Detective Quinn?
No, he's pretty easy to lose.

108
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:29,616
But one day, he'll be there
when you don't expect him.

109
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,014
Don't ever come to my home again.

110
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:33,661
- I just wanted to talk to you...
- Ever.

111
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,550
We can't be seen in public together.

112
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:38,208
Do you understand?
That's your first lesson.

113
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,793
Okay. Jesus.
I'm... I'm sorry.

114
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,127
It's just...

115
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,880
I-I spoke to Dr. Vogel, and she...

116
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,175
What exactly did she tell you?

117
00:07:48,954 --> 00:07:50,970
That you have this, like,

118
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,377
way of living that...

119
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,205
A-allows you to do what...

120
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,897
what you and I have in common,

121
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,524
and...

122
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,652
and that might be something
that I can do too.

123
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,531
I mean, fuck,
I have so many questions.

124
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,951
And I'll answer them as best I can.

125
00:08:15,345 --> 00:08:17,589
Are you gonna help me be like you?

126
00:08:17,714 --> 00:08:19,582
Don't even pretend.

127
00:08:21,885 --> 00:08:23,128
Hi, Dexter.

128
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:26,965
Going for a little night swim.

129
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,299
Enjoy.

130
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:31,302
Who's she?

131
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,305
- That's my neighbor.
- She's cute.

132
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:36,440
Yes, she's cute.

133
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:37,559
You need to go home.

134
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,102
When are we gonna talk about...

135
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,377
I'll call you.

136
00:08:40,502 --> 00:08:42,112
Look, something has come up
that I have to deal with.

137
00:08:42,237 --> 00:08:43,881
My day job,

138
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,192
which is something you need to get.

139
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:47,735
Why?
I have money.

140
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:49,820
You're a weird guy
who lives with his mom.

141
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:51,656
You might as well be wearing a sign.

142
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,324
Look, all I'm saying is that you need

143
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,027
to have some kind of cover life,

144
00:08:58,152 --> 00:08:59,831
something that makes you
look ordinary.

145
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,292
Yeah, right, yeah.
I get it, yeah.

146
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:06,529
Zach, I understand
what you're going through.

147
00:09:07,894 --> 00:09:09,174
I will help you with this.

148
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:12,224
Okay.

149
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,502
Thanks.

150
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:24,981
Not a single sighting
since she disappeared?

151
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:27,279
Thank you.

152
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,588
Motherfuck.

153
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,827
What you doing?

154
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:35,329
Nothing.

155
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:37,118
Why do you look
like you just got caught?

156
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,371
Come on,
what are you doing back here?

157
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:41,568
You looking at porn over here
or something?

158
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:42,603
- No.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

159
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:43,875
- Company computer.
- Will you...

160
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,877
And I am the boss.

161
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:47,921
Hannah McKay.

162
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,243
Wayne Randall's girlfriend, right?

163
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:51,577
Got arrested a while back
for something,

164
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:52,764
then somehow slipped away?

165
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:54,302
Why you... why you looking her up?

166
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,388
None of your goddamn business.
Will you fucking back off?

167
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:58,784
- Jesus, relax.
- No, I'm seri...

168
00:09:58,909 --> 00:09:59,918
You come in here all the time

169
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:01,434
and invade my personal space,

170
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,228
standing so close,

171
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,490
trying to flirt.

172
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:06,424
You're fucking
making me uncomfortable.

173
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:08,059
I didn't come in here to flirt, okay?

174
00:10:08,184 --> 00:10:09,628
I just came in here to see
if you wanted me

175
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:11,194
to pick you up something
for lunch, that's it.

176
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,659
I'm all set.

177
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,619
Are we done?

178
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,001
Yeah.

179
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:24,300
Yeah, we're done.

180
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:30,046
You know what?
We're not done, actually.

181
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,161
See, Deb, you came to me
six months ago,

182
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:33,299
on an emotional wreck,

183
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:36,302
saying you just quit the force
and you needed a job.

184
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:37,820
I gave you that job.

185
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:39,292
I gave you good pay, good benefits.

186
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,391
I didn't ask a lot of questions.

187
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,093
I put up with a lot
of weird shit from you

188
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:45,695
because you're good at your job

189
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,438
and because I'm a nice guy.

190
00:10:47,604 --> 00:10:52,201
So I'm really, really sorry
if this cramps your style,

191
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:55,704
but next time, maybe you want
to try a little gratitude

192
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:58,597
instead of always being
such a fucking bitch.

193
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:03,569
Now we're done.

194
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:17,649
<i>There she is.</i>

195
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,891
Vista Marina car rentals.

196
00:11:45,776 --> 00:11:47,453
<i>Vista Marina car rentals.
This is Stacy.</i>

197
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:48,454
<i>How may I help you?</i>

198
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:49,588
Hi, Stacy.

199
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:52,290
This is Detective Cooper
over at Miami Metro.

200
00:11:52,415 --> 00:11:56,228
My badge number is 143634.

201
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:58,396
We're investigating a hit and run.

202
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,965
We think somebody
who rented one of your vans

203
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,266
might have been a witness,

204
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:04,502
so I was hoping to get
some information over the phone.

205
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:08,806
I can fax you over a copy
of the warrant, if you'd like.

206
00:12:08,931 --> 00:12:11,376
<i>Oh, I'll just get it for you.
Do you have the license plate?</i>

207
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:12,603
Yes, I do.

208
00:12:12,728 --> 00:12:16,963
It's, uh, GLV43951.

209
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:21,317
<i>The name on that account
is Maggie Castner.</i>

210
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:24,243
<i>The local address is
Slip 23, Vista Marina.</i>

211
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,037
Thank you, Stacy.

212
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,629
<i>Want the phone number?</i>

213
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:32,168
Yes, that would be helpful.

214
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>813-398-2723.</i>

215
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:38,675
You may have found her.

216
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,870
If so, a little too easily.

217
00:12:40,995 --> 00:12:43,272
You think she wants to be found?

218
00:12:43,397 --> 00:12:46,140
I think she wants
to destroy our lives,

219
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,109
mine and Debra's both.

220
00:12:48,234 --> 00:12:50,612
Debra's very fragile right now.

221
00:12:50,737 --> 00:12:52,346
Even the threat
of Hannah coming after her

222
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,816
could derail all the progress
she's making.

223
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,518
I won't let that happen.

224
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:57,694
So what's your plan?

225
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,855
Slip 23.

226
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,657
You have her number.
You could call.

227
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,749
I don't want to let her know
I've found her yet.

228
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,644
Why do you seem
less scared than excited?

229
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,499
Because Hannah doesn't scare me.

230
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,502
Maybe you need to rethink that.

231
00:13:19,163 --> 00:13:20,807
They all look like nice apartments,

232
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:22,975
but I think you should work
things out with your brother.

233
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,376
Angel and I are gonna be fine.

234
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:25,845
I've just had it

235
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,975
with the whole "big brother
ruling over the roost" routine.

236
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,875
And the thing is...

237
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,421
What?

238
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,522
Well, just, most of these places,

239
00:13:37,647 --> 00:13:39,390
I have to sign a one-year lease,

240
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:42,472
and I wasn't sure about...

241
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,930
About what?

242
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,966
Okay, I'm definitely not
pushing you, okay?

243
00:13:48,091 --> 00:13:50,037
I'm just trying to be practical here.

244
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:53,624
If our relationship
keeps moving forward,

245
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,641
we might want to eventually get
a place together.

246
00:13:57,766 --> 00:13:59,276
Yeah, eventually.

247
00:13:59,401 --> 00:14:00,965
You don't have to decide now.

248
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,467
It's just something to think about.

249
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:06,816
Yeah, I'll totally think about it.

250
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:08,976
Okay.

251
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,289
I'm so sorry.

252
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:15,229
I-I blew that whole thing
out of proportion, I think.

253
00:14:15,395 --> 00:14:16,299
I just felt like you were trying

254
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:18,695
to, like, get rid of me with a check.

255
00:14:18,982 --> 00:14:22,531
I was just trying to be
a good, you know, father.

256
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:23,738
That was really sweet of you.

257
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,522
But it's my problem,

258
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:27,200
and I want to take care of it.

259
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,828
Well, I can respect that.
So we're cool?

260
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:31,807
Cool.

261
00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:33,542
How about you and I
do dinner tonight?

262
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:34,916
I can't.

263
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,146
I have to work right after class.

264
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:38,846
You know, pay off the debts.

265
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:40,515
Wow, well, good for you.

266
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,884
Where are you working?

267
00:14:43,009 --> 00:14:46,770
It's a sports bar
called lucky Pete's.

268
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,689
I can, uh, call you, though,
when I'm free.

269
00:14:48,814 --> 00:14:49,889
We can get together.

270
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,475
Okay.
Sounds great.

Oh, but I'm a friend of...

Even so, sir,
we have a strict dress code.

280
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,240
Call it a night, Dexter.

281
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,942
- You don't want to go in there.
- I do want to go in there.

282
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,043
It's their territory.

283
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:59,779
You'll be at a disadvantage.

284
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:01,270
I need to know what she's up to.

<i>Yeah.</i>

Well, the money's nice,
I have to admit, but...

340
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,830

Are you gonna kill him?

00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:02,930
I only kill people who deserve it.

358
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:05,776
<i>You here,</i>

359
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:07,644
<i>'cause something sure ain't right.</i>

360
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:10,180
<i>While them orphans
was camping in the woods,</i>

361
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,063
<i>something gave them a proper fright.</i>

362
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:14,017
<i>Miles Castner</i>

363
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:17,234
<i>made his fortune
in international casinos.</i>

364
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,588
<i>He has the power and the reach</i>

365
00:21:18,713 --> 00:21:21,572
<i>to get Hannah
a new name, new passport,</i>

366
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,715
<i>but if she's as happy
as she seems in her new life,</i>

367
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,198
<i>then why is she here,
messing with mine?</i>

368
00:21:29,323 --> 00:21:30,732
<i>Miles Castner...</i>

369
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,235
<i>What kind of name is Miles, anyway?</i>

370
00:21:34,694 --> 00:21:37,672
<i>Don't be a chump, Zoomer!</i>

371
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:38,964
<i>Ain't no such thing as...</i>

372
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,162
- Hey.
- Hey.

373
00:21:41,287 --> 00:21:42,456
Hey.

374
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,553
Hello.

375
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:46,931
Harrison, hello.

376
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:51,810
That's it?

377
00:21:51,976 --> 00:21:54,563
I remember when I used to get a hug.

378
00:21:54,729 --> 00:21:56,565
Even I don't matter
when <i>Rastamouse</i> is on.

379
00:21:56,731 --> 00:21:58,817
I checked in with Marshals, FBI,

380
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,260
fucking Homeland Security.

381
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:02,930
There hasn't been a single
sighting of Hannah McKay.

382
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,240
I'm hoping you've had better luck.

383
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,434
Yeah.
I found her.

384
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,103
She's married.

385
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:13,773
Well, there's someone
for everyone, I guess.

386
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:16,909
I hope he's sleeping
with one eye open.

387
00:22:17,034 --> 00:22:18,577
What's her married name?

388
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:21,113
The guy she's married to
is worth $700 million.

389
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,573
He owns casinos.

390
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,637
The name, Dex.

391
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,455
Castner.

392
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,489
Miles Castner.

393
00:22:31,614 --> 00:22:34,426
They're staying on his yacht.

394
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:35,793
I don't know what they're doing
in Miami.

395
00:22:35,918 --> 00:22:39,275
Maybe he has business here
or something.

396
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,867
But he seems to know who she is,

397
00:22:42,992 --> 00:22:44,960
even knows about her and me.

398
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,428
And she...

399
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,840
Seems to like him,

400
00:22:49,965 --> 00:22:52,100
or maybe she just
feels obligated to him.

401
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:55,291
I doubt Hannah McKay
feels obligated to anyone.

402
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:56,880
It's got to be operational.

403
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:58,182
She needs a cover life.

404
00:22:58,307 --> 00:23:01,352
It's not like it's a real marriage.

405
00:23:01,477 --> 00:23:05,259
She can't actually love this guy.

406
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,280
Oh, my God.

407
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:11,807
You're still in love
with her, aren't you?

408
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:14,063
What?
No.

409
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:17,124
She's probably trying to kill me.

410
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:22,484
Trust me,

411
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,040
no one knows what it's like

412
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:26,609
to fall in love with the wrong person

413
00:23:26,734 --> 00:23:29,712
more than I do.

414
00:23:29,837 --> 00:23:33,305
But you better get
your fucking head on straight.

415
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,208
She is everything
that is wrong with our lives.

416
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,827
She is a vortex.
She is a black hole.

417
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:41,890
She sucks everything into her being,

418
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:46,460
leaving nothing behind.

419
00:23:46,585 --> 00:23:49,053
We have got to get her
out of our lives.

420
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,356
I'm working on a plan.

421
00:23:55,661 --> 00:23:57,686
Are you sure you can be objective?

422
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,542
One little toss
of Hannah's pretty blonde hair,

423
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,901
and you turn into a fucking moron.

424
00:24:05,837 --> 00:24:07,279
Hannah?

425
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,989
Hannah is here?

426
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:11,751
Both of you?
Jesus.

427
00:24:11,876 --> 00:24:12,752
Really?

428
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:15,371
Deb, I'm on top of it.

429
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,373
I'm gonna figure out
exactly what she's up to.

430
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,459
Are you?

431
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:25,163
Where is Hannah?

432
00:24:25,288 --> 00:24:28,667
Right now, she's on a very big boat

433
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:30,803
with her husband.

434
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:41,903
♪ ♪

435
00:24:43,538 --> 00:24:45,950
Niki?

436
00:24:46,075 --> 00:24:48,452
Hey.
Hey, what are you doing here?

437
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:50,030
I came here to see you.

438
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:53,283
I didn't realize
this place was a breastaurant.

439
00:24:55,783 --> 00:24:57,871
I mean, it is a sports bar.
It's just topless.

440
00:24:58,037 --> 00:24:59,581
And I make really good money here.

441
00:24:59,747 --> 00:25:02,918
Are you really okay doing this?

442
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,400
Yeah, it's not the best job
in the world,

443
00:25:04,525 --> 00:25:05,921
but it's also not forever.

444
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,506
I'm fine with it.

445
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,757
I can tell that you're not.

446
00:25:08,923 --> 00:25:10,872
Me?
Oh.

447
00:25:10,997 --> 00:25:13,609
Look, I go to places like this
all the time.

448
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:14,977
- See?
- I...

449
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,277
Look, I've stared at a million boobs.

450
00:25:16,402 --> 00:25:18,346
But until now,
I never considered them

451
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:21,353
to be... daughter boobs.

452
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:24,648
Daughter boobs?

453
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,567
Well, come on.
You know what I mean.

454
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,027
Guy, hey.
Her face is up here, okay?

455
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:29,857
Come on.

456
00:25:29,982 --> 00:25:32,197
It's so sweet that you care.

457
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:33,160
I'm just gonna stay here

458
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:35,200
until something better
comes along, okay?

459
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:38,036
Yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll let you do your thing.

460
00:25:38,202 --> 00:25:39,788
Do you want to have dinner
on my next free night?

461
00:25:39,954 --> 00:25:42,136
Yeah.

462
00:25:42,261 --> 00:25:45,095
That's great.

463
00:25:47,253 --> 00:25:48,964
It actually makes sense, in a way,

464
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,675
that Dexter would have been
involved with another killer.

465
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:54,180
- Well, she's back.
- Mm.

466
00:25:54,305 --> 00:25:55,315
And she poisoned us.

467
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,680
Who knows what the fuck else
she has planned?

468
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:58,117
What does Dexter say?

469
00:25:58,242 --> 00:25:59,892
He's trying to figure out
what else she's up to,

470
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,269
but I'm afraid he's thinking
with the wrong head right now.

471
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,479
You're concerned for your safety.

472
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,105
And for Dexter's.

473
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:07,226
Let's take a step back.

474
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:08,894
From what you've told me,

475
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:11,597
if she wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead by now.

476
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:12,598
Well, maybe she just wants to prove

477
00:26:12,723 --> 00:26:13,780
that she has control,

478
00:26:13,946 --> 00:26:15,699
that she can kill us
whenever she wants to.

479
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,576
It's a very unsettling
feeling, isn't it?

480
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,485
Yeah, it is.

481
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,828
So what is it you'd like to do?

482
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:22,306
I would like to take her
to Marshal Services

483
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:23,499
and have her the fuck arrested.

484
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,579
- But Hannah knows too much.
- Yeah.

485
00:26:27,704 --> 00:26:28,880
But at least I wouldn't have to worry

486
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:32,272
about what might or might not be
in my morning coffee.

487
00:26:34,242 --> 00:26:35,802
When the brain surgeon was out there,

488
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:37,763
a threat to me,

489
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,023
I-I could hardly sleep.

490
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:42,393
I trusted Dexter
to solve the problem,

491
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:46,162
and he did.

492
00:26:49,123 --> 00:26:50,275
And if I can't?

493
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:52,869
Before you take matters
into your own hands,

494
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:56,073
be sure to consider all the
consequences of those actions.

495
00:26:59,208 --> 00:27:01,811
<i>The husband is a complication
I don't need.</i>

496
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:05,447
<i>I have to get Hannah alone,
in a situation I control.</i>

497
00:27:07,641 --> 00:27:09,836
Have you done the blood work
on the triple in Lummus Park?

498
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:11,520
Not yet.

499
00:27:11,645 --> 00:27:14,341
There's the prints on the
pesticide bottle still to run

500
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,557
and the decomp over in Coconut Grove

501
00:27:15,682 --> 00:27:17,137
- we still have to process.
- Yep.

502
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:20,430
Whew, we could use
an extra set of hands, right?

503
00:27:22,181 --> 00:27:23,831
Someone lower level,

504
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:25,633
an extra warm body
to offset all the cold ones.

505
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:26,867
Don't you think?

506
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:29,503
I mean, at least to make a dent
in the paperwork.

507
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:30,649
Sure, I guess.

508
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,652
Excellent idea.

509
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:42,786
<i>Zach...
What's he doing here?</i>

510
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:48,847
Quinn.

511
00:27:58,122 --> 00:27:59,219
Okay.

512
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:02,264
My client requests
that you cease and desist

513
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,183
this 24-hour watch you have on him.

514
00:28:05,349 --> 00:28:06,305
He requests it.

515
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,561
I'd like you to back the fuck off.

516
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,743
You took these photos, Zach?

517
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,704
Yeah, and those
are just the best ones.

518
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,289
Quinn, do you have anything to say?

519
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,457
Yeah, I think the kid's guilty.

520
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,584
I'll answer for you, Detective Quinn.

521
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,002
On behalf of the entire department,

522
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,670
I can assure you that we will...

523
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:35,092
Well, how did you put it, Zach?

524
00:28:35,217 --> 00:28:36,465
"Back the fuck down."

525
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,050
- "Off."
- Yeah, that too.

526
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:40,469
Right, Detective Quinn?

527
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,919
- Right.
- That's right.

528
00:28:43,044 --> 00:28:46,808
Gentlemen, let me show you out.

529
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,441
What the fuck were you thinking?

530
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,984
That rich asshole
is walking around, free.

531
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,277
We have nothing on this kid.

532
00:28:57,443 --> 00:28:58,687
That's why I was following him.

533
00:28:58,812 --> 00:28:59,946
Yeah, if this was any other case,

534
00:29:00,112 --> 00:29:01,990
I would personally sign off
on the overtime.

535
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:05,360
But this one...

536
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:06,453
Let it go.

537
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,821
That's an order.

538
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:14,419
By the way, me and Jamie
are moving in together.

539
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:16,138
You're what?
You're doing what?

540
00:29:16,263 --> 00:29:17,214
Hey, uh, you got a minute?

541
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,840
Uh, make it fast.

542
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,134
Okay, well, Dexter and I
are buried in that glass box.

543
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,469
We need an assistant.

544
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,478
I don't know about that.

545
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:24,679
Wait, hold on,
we've been under budget

546
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,223
the last three quarters.

547
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,225
- It was Dexter's idea.
- Okay.

548
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,586
Part-time.

549
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:33,021
You're one hell of a lieutenant.

550
00:29:43,614 --> 00:29:47,577
The photos were a nice touch.

551
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,639
Thanks.
I thought so.

552
00:29:53,764 --> 00:29:55,808
Well, now he's off my tail.

553
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,511
We can get down to business.

554
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:01,371
Find someone to... you know.

555
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:03,148
Eventually.

556
00:30:03,273 --> 00:30:05,217
What do you mean, "eventually"?

557
00:30:05,342 --> 00:30:08,753
I mean...

558
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:11,990
Long before my father taught me
how to do what I do,

559
00:30:12,115 --> 00:30:15,326
he taught me how not to do it.

560
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:17,762
Why would I want to not do it?

561
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:20,365
Timing is everything.

562
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,666
One thing you need to learn...

563
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,602
The first thing that I had to learn...

564
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:26,604
is to wait.

565
00:30:26,729 --> 00:30:28,873
Control your urges.

566
00:30:28,998 --> 00:30:31,621
Channel them appropriately.

567
00:30:33,102 --> 00:30:34,666
Dexter, I can't wait.

568
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,545
I can't control it.

569
00:30:37,015 --> 00:30:39,549
Yes, you can.

570
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:42,519
You're gonna get your chance,
Zach, I promise...

571
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:44,487
but the only way I've survived
as long as I have

572
00:30:44,612 --> 00:30:46,188
is by being careful.

573
00:30:46,313 --> 00:30:48,725
I'm gonna teach you how to do that.

574
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,326
And then?

575
00:30:50,451 --> 00:30:53,663
And then you'll be able
to do what I do

576
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:54,895
and get away with it.

577
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,509
What do you want?

578
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,260
I saw you with your son.

579
00:31:27,426 --> 00:31:30,499
Maggie never mentioned him.

580
00:31:30,624 --> 00:31:32,307
Hard to picture her
as the family type.

581
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,601
There's nothing going on
between Hannah and me.

582
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,902
Good.
Then listen.

583
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,271
I'd sooner see her in prison
than lose her.

584
00:31:38,437 --> 00:31:40,440
Do you understand?

585
00:31:40,606 --> 00:31:42,275
Because I could call a few people

586
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,568
and ruin your life.

587
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:45,611
And being a family man,

588
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:48,714
I'm sure that's not what you'd want.

589
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:54,318
People are so impatient.

590
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:06,430
Dexter, what are you doing?

591
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:09,594
This is something you don't want
to get in the middle of.

592
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,007
He said he'd sooner see her
in prison than lose her.

593
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,642
If that's what he thinks
this is about,

594
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:20,272
she's the one in danger.

595
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:21,579
I thought you were going to find out

596
00:32:21,704 --> 00:32:24,181
if Hannah was a threat
to you and Debra,

597
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:25,483
not if Miles was a threat

598
00:32:25,608 --> 00:32:28,321
to Hannah.

599
00:32:30,045 --> 00:32:32,450
Why can't I do both?

600
00:33:05,478 --> 00:33:06,628
Your flowers.

601
00:33:08,847 --> 00:33:10,024
That's the thing about plants.

602
00:33:10,149 --> 00:33:11,832
You don't look after 'em, they die.

603
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:20,957
So... what's up?

604
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:24,836
Miles just conononted me
at a gas station.

605
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:28,267
God.
He likes to be dramatic.

606
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:30,050
Is he a threat?

607
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:33,813
A "chop you up and toss you
in the ocean" kind of threat?

608
00:33:33,938 --> 00:33:35,881
No.

609
00:33:36,006 --> 00:33:37,650
But he could
make your life miserable,

610
00:33:37,775 --> 00:33:39,142
have people look into you

611
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,087
and follow you around 24/7.

612
00:33:42,212 --> 00:33:43,855
He sounds like a great guy.

613
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,192
And you're really
in a position to judge?

614
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:48,443
Why did you marry him?

615
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,352
Because he was there
when you weren't.

616
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:56,076
I needed him, Dexter.

617
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,835
I met him a few years ago

618
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,037
when I did some flowers for him
at an event,

619
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,833
and he found
my background intriguing.

620
00:34:03,999 --> 00:34:05,752
I could tell that he had
a bit of a crush on me,

621
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,944
so when I made my little escape
and when I had nothing

622
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:09,179
and when I was desperate,

623
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:11,481
I kn t that he could give me
a whole new life,

624
00:34:11,606 --> 00:34:12,801
a new identity,

625
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,968
money.

626
00:34:16,377 --> 00:34:18,077
Plus, he makes me happy.

627
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:21,267
Bullshit.

628
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:23,793
If you're so damn happy,

629
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,105
what are you doing back here?

630
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,357
Why did you drug Debra and me?

631
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,275
- You know, I think you should go.
- No, answer me.

632
00:34:29,441 --> 00:34:30,866
I wanted to make sure

633
00:34:30,991 --> 00:34:32,267
that you weren't gonna
put me in jail.

634
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:34,030
I had to see if you would come to me.

635
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:35,699
Which I did, and you still
haven't told me why.

636
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:37,940
Because it doesn't matter why
anymore.

637
00:34:38,065 --> 00:34:38,941
I changed my mind.

638
00:34:39,066 --> 00:34:41,366
About what?

639
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:46,126
I wanted you to kill Miles for me.

640
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:50,588
You what?

641
00:34:53,264 --> 00:34:55,689
He's possessive and controlling

642
00:34:55,814 --> 00:34:57,090
and obsessed with me to the point

643
00:34:57,215 --> 00:34:58,325
where he follows me everywhere.

644
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,278
I might as well be in prison.

645
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:02,863
If I were to try and leave him,

646
00:35:02,988 --> 00:35:05,478
he would... he would just turn me in.

647
00:35:05,644 --> 00:35:07,501
Why haven't you dealt
with this in your usual way?

648
00:35:07,626 --> 00:35:08,606
Because his family already thought

649
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:10,036
that I was some kind of gold digger

650
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:11,071
when we got married.

651
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:12,610
If he was gonna drop dead suddenly,

652
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:13,496
for no reason,

653
00:35:13,621 --> 00:35:15,405
I would be the first person
that they would turn to.

654
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,073
And once the cops get
a good look at me...

655
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,242
You wanted me to make him disappear.

656
00:35:22,807 --> 00:35:24,706
I thought you might feel
like you owed me.

657
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,624
- Owed you?
- You didn't have to turn me in.

658
00:35:27,311 --> 00:35:29,044
- You ruined my life.
- I did...

659
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,962
You know, it doesn't even
matter anymore,

660
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,290
because like I said,
I changed my mind.

661
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:33,590
And this is my problem,

662
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,966
and I'm gonna find
a way to deal with it.

663
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,996
Why did you change your mind?

664
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:40,565
Because the moment that
I saw you there, unconscious,

665
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,700
I realized that,

666
00:35:41,825 --> 00:35:43,501
despite the shitty way
that it all ended,

667
00:35:43,626 --> 00:35:46,528
you were it for me, Dexter.

668
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:53,544
I've never felt that way
about anyone before or since.

669
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:59,073
You're the only person
that I can be that honest with.

670
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:03,420
And I didn't want to ruin that

671
00:36:03,545 --> 00:36:06,456
by manipulating you
into doing something

672
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,167
that might be bad for you.

673
00:36:15,156 --> 00:36:18,090
It was the same for me.

674
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:22,347
No, just leave it at that.

675
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,473
I have to go before Miles
finds out where I've gone.

676
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,685
- Hannah...
- Good-bye.

677
00:36:35,317 --> 00:36:36,451
Hey.

678
00:36:36,576 --> 00:36:40,555
Um, can I borrow that
high-tech G.P.S. tracker thingy

679
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,241
that you have?

680
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:44,077
Please?

681
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:46,496
Yeah.

682
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,628
Being nice
when you need something, huh?

683
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:50,339
I'm not surprised.

684
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:58,675
Sorry that I overreacted earlier.

685
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:02,762
I know that you're interested.

686
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:04,577
You act like you are.

687
00:37:04,702 --> 00:37:07,600
But, Jake, you don't want
to get involved with me.

688
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,561
You have no idea who I really am.

689
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,022
I just want a chance to find out.

690
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,879
Can I help you?
Is that your car?

691
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,342
Um, it... it's my brother's car.

692
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,612
I think I left my sunglasses
in the passenger seat,

693
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:43,094
and he's not answering his phone.

694
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,304
Your brother is...

695
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,483
Dexter Morgan.
He lives in the building.

696
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:47,851
Oh.
Oh, you're Dexter's sister.

697
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,185
- I'm Cassie, his neighbor.
- Debra.

698
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,854
Oh, fuck, you're Cassie
who went out with him, right?

699
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,939
Really?
He mentioned me?

700
00:37:55,105 --> 00:37:56,149
You look surprised.

701
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,326
I am.

702
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:59,228
I, uh, I guess I figured

703
00:37:59,353 --> 00:38:00,530
he thought I was the worst date ever.

704
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:01,931
He didn't exactly follow up.

705
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:03,098
But he's always nice to me
when I see him.

706
00:38:03,223 --> 00:38:05,074
He's kind of impossible to read.

707
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,118
Yeah, that would be Dexter.

708
00:38:07,284 --> 00:38:08,703
Oh, okay, good, I was starting
to think it was me.

709
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,139
Nope, definitely not you.

710
00:38:11,264 --> 00:38:13,808
Hey, um, since I've got you here,

711
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,126
what's his deal?

712
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,503
Jamie seems to think
he's not over his ex-girlfriend,

713
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:19,422
which totally makes him
more attractive to me,

714
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,183
'cause apparently, I have
a thing for unavailable men.

715
00:38:22,308 --> 00:38:23,509
Sorry.
That was an overshare.

716
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:25,185
That's all right.
I get it.

717
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,186
It's so crazy, right?

718
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:27,180
I meet this totally nice guy

719
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,023
who's completely into me,

720
00:38:29,148 --> 00:38:30,357
and I'm still hung up

721
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:34,103
on the mysterious man next door
who hasn't called.

722
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:37,698
I don't know you...
At all, actually.

723
00:38:37,823 --> 00:38:40,332
But you seem
like a normal girl, you know?

724
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:41,868
If I were you, I would probably stick

725
00:38:41,993 --> 00:38:43,821
with the guy
that's obviously interested.

726
00:38:46,363 --> 00:38:47,774
Trust me, Dexter is not a mystery

727
00:38:47,899 --> 00:38:49,249
that you want to solve.

728
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:53,831
Okay.

729
00:38:53,997 --> 00:38:55,314
Yeah.
Sorry about all that.

730
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,314
It's all right.
Have a good one.

731
00:38:56,439 --> 00:38:58,440
See you.

732
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,093
- Hey!
- Hey.

733
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,258
You could've come inside.
I just got your text.

734
00:39:07,383 --> 00:39:08,460
Oh, well, you know,

735
00:39:08,585 --> 00:39:10,974
I think I've seen enough
of that place, you know.

736
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,331
So...
What brings you by?

737
00:39:13,456 --> 00:39:15,019
I wanted to let you know

738
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:18,035
that a lab assistant position
just opened up at Miami Metro,

739
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,037
and it's yours if you want it.

740
00:39:20,162 --> 00:39:21,025
What does it pay?

741
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:24,842
$13.75 an hour, plus dental.

742
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,543
I make a lot more money
than that here.

743
00:39:26,668 --> 00:39:28,913
You did say that
this wasn't your first choice

744
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:30,743
- as a line of work.
- Yeah.

745
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:32,016
I figured you'd jump at the chance

746
00:39:32,141 --> 00:39:33,079
for a future that didn't
include pole dancing.

747
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,653
I'm not gonna be a stripper, Dad.

748
00:39:36,778 --> 00:39:38,488
Whoa...

749
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:40,890
Hey, it just slipped out.

750
00:39:41,015 --> 00:39:43,392
That's okay.

751
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:45,862
Well, listen, just do me a favor.
Just think about it, okay?

752
00:39:45,987 --> 00:39:48,321
I think it would be good
for the both of us.

753
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,305
Okay.
All right.

754
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,224
- Bye.
- Bye.

755
00:39:56,499 --> 00:39:59,814
Well, that's probably best
for all involved.

756
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,711
Two psychopaths together...

757
00:40:02,836 --> 00:40:03,735
Never a good mix.

758
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,815
Hannah's not a psychopath.

759
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,031
She has feelings.

760
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,490
I'll have to take your word for that.

761
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:11,286
Anyway, I called you
over here tonight

762
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:13,453
because I'm concerned about Zach.

763
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:16,372
He came to me today
in a very agitated state.

764
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:18,426
I know, I didn't let him
kill his father,

765
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:20,376
and now he's feeling the urge
more than ever.

766
00:40:20,542 --> 00:40:24,265
And how do you plan to handle it?

767
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,366
I was ten years old

768
00:40:25,491 --> 00:40:27,334
when Harry told me
what my future would be.

769
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:29,536
I didn't kill until I was 19.

770
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:32,239
Zach can wait.

771
00:40:32,364 --> 00:40:35,020
He just doesn't know he can.

772
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:40,063
- Apples and oranges, Dexter.
- Sorry?

773
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:43,107
You thought you had no choice but
to wait because your father told you to.

774
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:49,289
But you were just a boy
who'd never taken a human life.

775
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,891
- Zach has already killed.
- Don't get me wrong.

776
00:40:52,016 --> 00:40:54,126
I'm glad you took him off your table.

777
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,523
But the moment you did,

778
00:40:56,648 --> 00:40:58,915
Zach became your responsibility.

779
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,110
He's relying on you, Dexter.

780
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,141
You need to take this very seriously.

781
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:12,243
<i>Hi, you've reached Zach Hamilton.</i>

782
00:41:12,368 --> 00:41:14,278
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

783
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:16,547
Hey, Zach.
It's Dexter.

784
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:19,317
Let's meet tomorrow afternoon,
2:00 p.m.

785
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,396
I'll come to your studio.

786
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:31,695
<i>It's good that Hannah's leaving.</i>

787
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,895
<i>I have enough on my plate</i>

788
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,493
<i>trying to turn a young killer into...</i>

789
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,125
<i>Someone like me.</i>

790
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:18,494
<i>Miles knows that Hannah and I
saw each other yesterday.</i>

791
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:22,741
<i>If Miles will do this to me,</i>

792
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:25,506
<i>what will he do to her?</i>

793
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,543
So who are you tracking?

794
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:33,653
I'm just kidding, obviously.

795
00:42:33,778 --> 00:42:34,820
I don't want to invade your privacy.

796
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:36,012
I just want to see
if you need anything.

797
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,722
No, I'm good.

798
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,992
Okay.

799
00:42:40,117 --> 00:42:42,435
Jake.

800
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,200
I know I can be
kind of a dick sometimes.

801
00:42:49,325 --> 00:42:51,869
You don't deserve that.

802
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:53,571
It's okay, most people think

803
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,948
I'm a dick too,
so I guess we're even.

804
00:42:56,114 --> 00:42:59,160
This past year hasn't been my best.

805
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,813
The truth is,
I wouldn't be surviving it

806
00:43:01,938 --> 00:43:04,624
if it weren't for you, so thank you.

807
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:06,584
You're welcome.

808
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:28,648
Dexter?

809
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,178
Come on, what the fuck?
Dexter!

810
00:43:37,303 --> 00:43:40,785
It looks like he's not home.

811
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,418
Can I give him a message?

812
00:43:49,584 --> 00:43:51,379
Yeah.
Fuck him.

813
00:44:02,327 --> 00:44:03,804
Hey, babe.

814
00:44:03,929 --> 00:44:05,573
Good hunting?

815
00:44:05,698 --> 00:44:06,874
Yeah, I found a couple dresses.

816
00:44:06,999 --> 00:44:08,808
I think you'll really like them.

817
00:44:08,933 --> 00:44:10,477
Nice.

818
00:44:10,602 --> 00:44:14,113
I'm guessing today's shopping
went better than yesterday's.

819
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:16,349
- About the same.
- Really?

820
00:44:16,474 --> 00:44:18,518
That's surprising,
considering there probably isn't

821
00:44:18,643 --> 00:44:21,659
much of a selection
at your old greenhouse.

822
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,789
What are you talking about?

823
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:26,644
You were with your friend.

824
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:31,101
Dexter Morgan.

825
00:44:33,529 --> 00:44:35,838
Well, he a... he asked to see me.

826
00:44:35,963 --> 00:44:37,840
He wanted to make sure
that I was all right

827
00:44:37,965 --> 00:44:39,509
after you confronted him,

828
00:44:39,634 --> 00:44:41,611
and I told him
that everything was fine,

829
00:44:41,736 --> 00:44:43,546
that we were very happy together,

830
00:44:43,671 --> 00:44:44,681
end of story.

831
00:44:44,806 --> 00:44:46,851
Don't lie to me.
I know the truth.

832
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,218
Oh, Miles, I told you,
I don't care about him anymore.

833
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:50,886
So you won't be too upset then.

834
00:44:51,011 --> 00:44:52,086
About what?

835
00:44:52,211 --> 00:44:53,955
About what yesterday's excursion

836
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,156
is going to cost your friend.

837
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:56,916
Miles, that's unnecessary.

838
00:44:57,444 --> 00:45:00,028
- You've made it necessary.
- No, please, don't hurt him.

839
00:45:00,153 --> 00:45:01,896
"Don't hurt him"?
Why, because you love him?

840
00:45:02,021 --> 00:45:03,064
No, I promise you.

841
00:45:03,189 --> 00:45:04,899
I'm not ever gonna see him again.

842
00:45:05,024 --> 00:45:06,234
He's the reason you insisted...

843
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:07,321
- Stop it.
- On coming with me to Miami,

844
00:45:07,446 --> 00:45:08,969
returning to a place where...

845
00:45:09,094 --> 00:45:10,338
- Ouch!
- - You're a wanted criminal.

846
00:45:10,463 --> 00:45:11,739
Miles, ow!

847
00:45:11,864 --> 00:45:14,799
He's the unfinished business
you mentioned.

848
00:45:18,871 --> 00:45:21,882
I want you to know I forgive you.

849
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:23,317
We're going to make a new beginning.

850
00:45:23,442 --> 00:45:25,084
I've already told the crew
we're leaving tonight.

851
00:45:25,209 --> 00:45:27,487
We'll sail thehe coast,
then cross the Atlantic,

852
00:45:27,612 --> 00:45:30,223
just the two of us,
for the rest of our lives.

853
00:45:30,348 --> 00:45:31,858
That's how much I care about you.

854
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:33,159
No, Miles.
Stop it, please.

855
00:45:33,284 --> 00:45:35,328
You'll never have to leave this boat.

856
00:45:35,453 --> 00:45:37,151
Stop...

857
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:42,100
I've given you everything!
You belong to me.

858
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:44,992
No, stop it.
Get off me!

859
00:45:48,098 --> 00:45:50,623
♪ ♪

860
00:45:54,042 --> 00:46:01,592
♪

861
00:46:24,766 --> 00:46:27,201
I-I tried to run,

862
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,911
but...

863
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,996
He just grabbed me.

864
00:46:34,975 --> 00:46:37,753
I didn't mean for it
to happen this way.

865
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:39,630
Are you hurt?

866
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:43,866
I'm okay.

867
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,725
We need bleach, bags,

868
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,168
something to cut with...

869
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:56,564
an axe or a saw
or something like that.

870
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,007
You think you can get me those things

871
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:00,860
without letting the crew know
that anything's wrong?

872
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:06,782
Yeah, I think so.
Yes.

873
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,035
Wait, you need to change.

874
00:47:12,844 --> 00:47:14,749
- All right.
- Hannah.

875
00:47:17,827 --> 00:47:18,794
It's gonna be okay.

876
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:23,919
I'll take care of everything.

877
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,160
I believe you.

878
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:54,497
So that's how
you make people disappear.

879
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:58,107
Give or take a plastic room
and a kill table, yeah.

880
00:47:58,232 --> 00:48:01,299
Yeah, I remember that part.

881
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:24,652
Do you ever wish
that you had followed through?

882
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,823
With killing me?

883
00:48:30,389 --> 00:48:31,116
No.

884
00:48:35,932 --> 00:48:37,248
Ever wish you had?

885
00:48:38,535 --> 00:48:40,417
I was never going
to kill you, Dexter.

886
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,907
It's just...

887
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:48,619
Well, I knew I couldn't
live with Miles for much longer,

888
00:48:48,744 --> 00:48:49,745
and...

889
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:54,473
Unlike you, I don't
actually enjoy any of this.

890
00:48:58,587 --> 00:49:00,396
So what's next?

891
00:49:01,465 --> 00:49:04,368
I told the crew that Miles was going

892
00:49:04,493 --> 00:49:05,635
to New York for a few days,

893
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,404
so that should buy me some time.

894
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,002
What's wrong?

895
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:26,386
I have to go to a crime scene...

896
00:49:27,647 --> 00:49:28,923
At my apartment building.

897
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:31,759
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

898
00:49:31,926 --> 00:49:33,846
I have to go.

899
00:49:36,222 --> 00:49:39,560
Please don't leave town
before we talk again.

900
00:49:41,888 --> 00:49:42,855
I won't.

901
00:50:06,217 --> 00:50:09,152
<i>This could be my apartment.</i>

902
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:27,107
<i>Cassie.</i>

903
00:50:28,273 --> 00:50:29,274
Dexter?

904
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,241
What happened?

905
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,057
I don't know.
I just got here.

906
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:41,825
Cassie and I,

907
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,249
we were supposed
to have a date tonight.

908
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:46,502
I'm sorry.

909
00:50:51,058 --> 00:50:53,570
I know you were friends.
You okay to work this?

910
00:50:53,695 --> 00:50:55,761
Yeah.
Yeah.

911
00:51:01,531 --> 00:51:03,227
What do you see?

912
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,349
She was bludgeoned.

913
00:51:07,474 --> 00:51:08,565
See those marks on her neck?

914
00:51:08,731 --> 00:51:10,734
Someone held her down
and beat her to death.

915
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,555
God.

916
00:51:18,582 --> 00:51:21,162
<i>Norma Rivera was bludgeoned.</i>

917
00:51:21,287 --> 00:51:23,030
<i>Is it possible Zach did this</i>

918
00:51:23,155 --> 00:51:26,090
<i>when I was with Hannah?</i>

919
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:28,803
<i>Harry was a good teacher to me</i>

920
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:32,840
<i>because he was normal, human.</i>

921
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,641
<i>But can anything good come</i>

922
00:51:34,766 --> 00:51:37,844
<i>from putting two killers together,</i>

923
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,737
<i>whether it be student and teacher</i>

924
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,267
<i>or whatever Hannah and I have?</i>

925
00:51:44,543 --> 00:51:47,655
<i>Or will it always end the same way,</i>

926
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,781
<i>like this?</i>

927
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,736
