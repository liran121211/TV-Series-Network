00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,334
BATISTA COULD NOT ONLY
LOSE HIS JOB,

14
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:35,901
HE COULD SERVE TIME.

- AN OLD TOURIST
WELCOME CENTER.

25
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:01,200
TOTALLY ISOLATED.

00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,501
OH, I WISH YOU COULD SEE
THE ROOM I SET UP FOR YOU.

27
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:06,701
ALL THE WOMEN YOU'VE KILLED.

SHE SAW...ME.

32
00:01:29,167 --> 00:01:32,167
[quirky music]

33
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:40,100
* *

34
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:50,133
- I'M NOT LIKING
THE TREND HERE.

35
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:52,234
YOU RIP A MAN APART
IN A PUBLIC BATHROOM...

36
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:54,300

39
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:02,601
AND NOW YOU'VE GOT HER.

40
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:05,968
WHAT'S THE FIRST RULE
OF THE CODE?

41
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:07,534
- NEVER KILL AN INNOCENT.

42
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:09,200
- DON'T GET CAUGHT.

43
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,734
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN HERE?

44
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:16,434
NURSE HER BACK TO HEALTH
SO SHE CAN GO TO THE POLICE?

45
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,300
SHE GIVES THE COPS ENOUGH
TO TRACK YOU DOWN,

46
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,501
THEN EVERYTHING
FALLS APART.

47
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:22,133
HARRISON GROWS UP
VISITING YOU ON DEATH ROW.

48
00:04:29,734 --> 00:04:32,300
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

49
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,634
- BECAUSE SHE'S DYING.

50
00:04:33,634 --> 00:04:35,634
- AND YOU'RE A SERIAL KILLER.

51
00:04:35,634 --> 00:04:36,934
I'D THINK YOU COULD
HANDLE THAT.

52
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,834
YOU DIDN'T DO THIS
TO HER, DEX.

53
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,300
SHE'S NOT
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

54
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,667
GO HOME AND TAKE CARE OF
YOUR SON.

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,667
- [sound slowed]
IT'S OKAY. DON'T MOVE.

56
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,734
EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.

57
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,701
- [groaning]

58
00:05:11,701 --> 00:05:14,567

CALM DOWN.

60
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,033
STOP FIGHTING ME.

00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:21,400
- [screaming]

62
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,734

hysterically]

64

- FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

66
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:07,934
[cell phone ringing]

67
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,801
WHAT?

68
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:17,367
- JESUS.
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

69
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,901
- SORRY. IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT.

70
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:20,767
- IN CALIFORNIA, MAYBE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

71
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:23,267
- NOTHING.
I'M JUST...TIRED.

72
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:24,801
- YOU ARE?

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,934
I JUST PULLED AN ALL-NIGHTER
AT A CRIME SCENE.

74
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:28,901
TOTALLY FRIED
AND I'VE GOT JACK SHIT.

75
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:31,400
- SO THE BABYSITTER'S
BEEN THERE ALL NIGHT?

76
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
- MASUKA'S TRYING.
HE REALLY IS.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,567
BUT THE BLOOD JUST
DOESN'T TALK TO HIM

78
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:37,567
THE WAY IT DOES
TO YOU.

79
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,334
I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP
ON THIS.

80
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:42,067
- IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.
I'VE GOT HARRISON.

81
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,501
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE BABYSITTER?

82
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:45,267
- PROBABLY GETTING READY
TO KILL ME.

83
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:46,901
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE STILL
ON LEAVE,

84
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,734
AND YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T ASK
IF IT WEREN'T IMPORTANT.

85
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,834
DON'T MAKE ME BEG.

86
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:52,167
- DEB, LOOK, IT'S--
[sighs]

87
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,567
MAYBE I CAN USE THE CRIME SCENE
TO GET AN I.D.

88
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:57,400
ON SLEEPING BEAUTY HERE.

89
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,367
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:04,267
- YEAH. OF COURSE.

91
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,634
YOU'RE MY SISTER.

00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,434
WHERE, UH--
WHERE SHOULD I GO?

00:07:09,434 --> 00:07:12,601
- 1132 MOREDO.
IT'S A BOTANICA.

JUST FOLLOW THE FUCKING

00:07:15,934 --> 00:07:17,634
YOU'RE THE BEST,

96

- DEX, OVER HERE.

99
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:55,234
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME.

100
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:57,467
THE CORONER'S CHOMPING
AT THE BIT TO REMOVE THE BODY.

101
00:07:57,467 --> 00:07:58,734
- IT'S A BIT OF A CIRCUS.

102
00:07:58,734 --> 00:07:59,968
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
IT'S BARNUM AND BAILEY.

103
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:01,934
- [yelling in Spanish]

104
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:04,501
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
WE'RE WORKING ON IT!

105
00:08:04,501 --> 00:08:05,868
- WHAT'S HE SAYING?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

106
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:07,434
BUT THE GENERAL COMPLAINT IS
THERE ARE FEWER BEHEADINGS

107
00:08:07,434 --> 00:08:08,434
IN THE RICH PARTS
OF MIAMI.

108
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:09,767
- BEHEADINGS?

109
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:14,367
- YEAH. AND THAT'S NOT EVEN
THE FUCKED UP PART.

110
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:19,133
- DEXTROUS.

111
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:22,467
- VINCE.

112
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:25,534
WHOA, YOU WEREN'T KIDDING
ABOUT THE FUCKED UP PART.

113
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:29,601
- IT'S A POTENTIAL WITNESS.
AND IT'S THE SECOND THIS WEEK.

114
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,934
- SO WHAT YOU GOT?

115
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:33,267

117
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:37,234
- JUST MACHETE.

118
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,300
WE'VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT.
WE'RE TOO TIRED TO THINK.

119
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,734
THAT'S WHY I CALLED YOU.

120
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:46,868
SO?

121
00:08:46,868 --> 00:08:49,968
- SO THE BEHEADING OBVIOUSLY
WENT DOWN HERE.

122
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:53,667
HE WAS STANDING.

123
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,901
WHACK ONE,
AND THE VICTIM GOES DOWN.

124
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,133
WHACK TWO...

125
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,968
WHACK THREE...

126
00:09:01,968 --> 00:09:05,634
AND CERVICAL VERTEBRAE
ARE PRETTY MUCH TOAST.

127
00:09:05,634 --> 00:09:08,601
SEPARATION COMPLETE.

128
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:10,434
WE HAVE LIFTOFF.
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING.

129
00:09:10,434 --> 00:09:12,801
- NOT REALLY.
LET HIM WORK.

130
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,667
- EYES AND TONGUE
REMOVED HERE.

131
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,968
- THAT TONGUE'S IN
THE ICE CHEST.

132
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:17,400
DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

133
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,934
- NO, NOT REALLY.

134
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,000
HAS ANYONE BEEN SMOKING
IN HERE?

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,334
- IT'S 2010. WHO SMOKES?

136
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:26,701
- UH, MACHETE MAN,
I THINK.

137
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:34,968
A SMALL CIGAR.

138
00:09:34,968 --> 00:09:37,033
HIGHLY UNSTABLE ASH.

139
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:40,400
SHORT, TORN TOBACCO LEAVES.
IT'S A CHEAP ONE.

140
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,501
LIKE A TIPARILLO.

141
00:09:42,501 --> 00:09:46,567
[sighs]
I'D LOOK FOR THAT.

142
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:50,734
- SO MACHETE AND TIPARILLO.
DEFINITELY STYLIN'.

143
00:09:50,734 --> 00:09:52,501
- FUCK ME IN BOTH EARS.

144
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:56,334
OKAY, PEOPLE, OUR KILLERS LEFT
THROUGH THAT DOOR

145
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,534
INTO THE ALLEY.

146
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:59,434
SO LET'S SWEEP IT
FOR SMALL CIGAR BUTTS.

147
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:00,767
- HEY, WATCH YOUR STEP,
FELLAS.

148
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,300

154
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:25,767
OH, GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

I GOTTA GO.

158
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,400
- DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
IF WE FIND THE CIGAR?

159
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,200
- I JUST WANT TO FIND OUT
WHO THAT GIRL IS

160
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,434
BEFORE THE M-99
WEARS OFF.

161
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:41,801
ABSOLUTELY.

162
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:45,100
I'LL DROP BY THE STATION
LATER.

163
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:57,801
- OH...HE'S UP.

164
00:10:57,801 --> 00:11:00,167
- HE'S BEEN UP FOR HOURS.

165
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:03,901
- I KNOW.
I MISSED YOU TOO.

166
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:06,467
I'M SO SORRY.
I KNOW I'M LATE.

167
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,067
- <i>LATE</i> DOESN'T QUITE
CAPTURE IT.

168
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,901
IT'S BEEN ALL NIGHT.

169
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,467
- I KNOW, IT'S JUST...

170
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,968
I KILLED A MAN
IN FRONT OF A WITNESS

171
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:14,501
I JUST HAD TO TRANQUILIZE

172
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:16,968
TO KEEP HER
FROM SCRATCHING MY EYES OUT.

173
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,234
- WHAT?
- I'LL MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

174
00:11:19,234 --> 00:11:20,400
- [scoffs]
I DON'T THINK SO.

175
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,000
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,200
- IT MEANS I DON'T THINK
THIS IS A GOOD FIT,

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,434
AND I WON'T BE RETURNING.

178
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,133
- IT IS.
IT IS A GOOD FIT.

179
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,868
HARRISON LIKES YOU.
- AND I REALLY LIKE HIM.

180
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:32,334
WHICH IS WHAT PAINS ME
SO MUCH ABOUT THIS, BUT...

181
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,300
HE NEEDS A RELIABLE PARENT.

182
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,033
ESPECIALLY WITH HIS MOTHER
GONE.

183
00:11:36,033 --> 00:11:37,434
- I'M RELIABLE.

184
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:39,300
- WELL, I GUESS WE USE
DIFFERENT DICTIONARIES.

185
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,467
- IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
- DO YOU THINK?

186
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,367
MY MOTHER TOLD ME
WHEN I WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL,

187
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,667
"NEVER LIE TO SOMEONE
WHO TRUSTS YOU.

188
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,334
NEVER TRUST SOMEONE
WHO LIES TO YOU."

189
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,033
IT'S A SHAME, REALLY.

190
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:54,067
WE GOT OFF
TO SUCH A GOOD START.

191
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:01,701

194
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:09,467
- I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT THE BUREAU SAID NO.

195
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:13,567
- EVEN THOUGH THE ONLY CLUE
YOU HAVE IN THE TRINITY CASE

196
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,300
IS KYLE BUTLER,
AND I MIGHT KNOW WHO THAT IS.

197
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,467
- THAT'S RIGHT.

198
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,234
- ASK AGAIN, RAY.
- THERE'S NO POINT.

199
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:20,467
- I THOUGHT YOU HAD CLOUT.

200
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,367
- NOT WHEN IT COMES
TO DOING AN END RUN

201
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,434
ON SAFE HOUSE PROCEDURES.

202
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,467
LOOK, OFFER STILL STANDS.

203
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:28,367
GIVE ME THE PHOTO,
I'LL SHOW IT TO THE FAMILY.

204
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,100
- I TOLD YOU,
I CAN'T DO THAT.

205
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,667
IT'S A SENSITIVE SITUATION.

206
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,501
- IT'S YOUR CALL.

207
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:37,767
- GREAT. THANKS.

THERE'S THE SAFE HOUSE,

211
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:10,567
AND THERE'S JONAH MITCHELL.

212
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,567

CAUGHT A BREAK

213
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,767
IN THE SANTA MUERTE CASE,
SO LISTEN UP, PEOPLE.

00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,067
DETECTIVE MORGAN.

215
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,501
- OKAY, IT'S TOO SOON
TO CELEBRATE,

216
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,367
AND MOST OF US ARE
TOO FUCKING TIRED ANYWAY,

217
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:29,367
BUT WE FOUND THIS
JUST OUTSIDE THE BACK ENTRANCE

218
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:31,234
OF THE BOTANICA
WHERE FAUZI WAS MURDERED.

219
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:34,234
- IS THAT A CIGAR BUTT?

220
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:35,400

DETECTIVE QUINN.

221

OFF THE COUCH AND JOINING US--
SO THANK YOU.

223
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:42,033
IT'S A TIPARILLO BUTT,

224
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,267
AND WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
IT WAS HANDLED

225
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,067
BY ONE OF THE TWO
ASSAILANTS.

226
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,567
- SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT,
DNA SWAB?

227
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,467
- EVEN BETTER.

228
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:53,167
- OH, THERE'S A 3/4 PARTIAL
THUMBPRINT ON THE SIDE,

229
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:55,367
AND IT HAS TO BE PROCESSED
MANUALLY--IT'S INCOMPLETE.

230
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,701
BUT WE EXPECT TO HEAR BACK
WITHIN A DAY.

231
00:13:58,701 --> 00:14:01,567

IT'S MUCH BIGGER.
[laughter]

241
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:25,801
- WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?
BETTER THAN DOUGHNUTS.

242
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:32,901
- THIS YOUR IDEA
OF QUALITY TIME,

243
00:14:32,901 --> 00:14:35,133
USING YOUR SON AS COVER?

244
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:37,367
- HE'S ENJOYING IT.
THEY'RE ENJOYING IT.

245
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:38,634
IT'S A WIN-WIN.

246
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,567
BESIDES,
IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

247
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,334
I NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO THIS GIRL IS

248
00:14:42,334 --> 00:14:46,133
BEFORE SHE WAKES UP,
WHICH WILL BE SOON.

249
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:52,400
AH, DAMN IT.

- BORROWING.

NO ONE'S LOOKING FOR HER.

- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I SHOULD JUST LET HER DIE?

264
00:15:46,601 --> 00:15:49,701
- WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST
LET HER GO.

265
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,667
THIS ISN'T SOME FAIRY TALE
WHERE SHE WAKES UP

266
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,834
AND YOU GET TO BE THE HANDSOME
PRINCE WHO SAVED HER.

267
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,701
IF SHE WAKES UP,
SHE'LL CALL THE POLICE.

268
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:02,734

00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:46,400
AND HE'S GONNA GO
RIGHT TO SLEEP.

282
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,467
HE'S WAY OVERDUE
FOR A NAP.

283
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,834
- ALL RIGHT.
IF YOU CARRY HIM TO THE CAR.

AND, UM...
WHEN YOU INSULTED MY WIFE,

ABOUT HER.

00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:32,000
EVERY ONE OF THESE BARRELS
HAS A BODY IN IT.

696
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,667
BOYD PRESERVED THEM
IN FORMALDEHYDE

697
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,100
SO HE COULD COME
AND VISIT.

698
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,200
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

699
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,400
I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

700
00:42:43,434 --> 00:42:47,634
- HOW DO I KNOW THAT
YOU DIDN'T KILL THESE GIRLS?

701
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,501
- YOU DON'T.

702
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:03,834
IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH...
FOR BOTH OF US.

703
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:12,701
MY WIFE WAS MURDERED...

704
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:18,567
BRUTALLY...
BY SOMEONE LIKE BOYD.

705
00:43:18,567 --> 00:43:22,133
I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MORE
INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE.

706
00:43:24,934 --> 00:43:27,801
HERE, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?
TAKE IT.

707
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:29,400
- NO.

708
00:43:32,767 --> 00:43:36,601
- TAKE IT. IT'S YOURS.

709
00:43:36,601 --> 00:43:38,868
- OH...

710
00:43:45,367 --> 00:43:47,434
- AAH!

711
00:43:53,167 --> 00:43:55,901
ARE YOU DONE?

712
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:05,234
[Lumen sobbing]

713
00:44:15,534 --> 00:44:19,667
- I TELL YOU TO LEAVE
TRINITY'S FAMILY ALONE,

714
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:22,467
AND INSTEAD,
YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK.

715
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:25,167
AND BASED ON WHAT? THIS?

716
00:44:25,167 --> 00:44:26,234
A CUT-AND-PASTE SKETCH

717
00:44:26,234 --> 00:44:27,868
YOU THINK RESEMBLES
DEXTER MORGAN?

718
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:29,801
- THE KID RECOGNIZED HIM.

719
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:31,133
- HE IDENTIFIED DEXTER
AS KYLE BUTLER?

720
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:33,367
- HE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE,
BUT I COULD TELL.

721
00:44:33,367 --> 00:44:34,868
- OH, YOU COULD <i>TELL.</i>

722
00:44:34,868 --> 00:44:37,567
AND DID JONAH CONVEY THIS I.D.
TO THE FBI?

723
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:40,067
- NO.
- RIGHT.

724
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:43,234
BECAUSE IT'S BULLSHIT.

725
00:44:43,234 --> 00:44:45,634
YOU HAVE YOUR SUSPICIONS,
YOU COME TO ME.

726
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:48,234
- I TRIED.
- AND WHEN I SAY NO, QUINN,

727
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:50,767
IT'S OVER!

728
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:55,834
YOU'RE ON UNPAID SUSPENSION
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

729
00:44:55,834 --> 00:44:57,701
- SUSPENSION?

730
00:44:57,701 --> 00:44:59,767
- JUST TELL EVERYONE YOU'RE
TAKING A FEW VACATION DAYS.

731
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:02,200
- YOU KIDDING?

732
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,400
- AM I FUCKING KIDDING?

733
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,167
YOU'RE LUCKY I DON'T
TERMINATE YOUR ASS.

734
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:09,167
AND YOU KNOW THE ONE REASON
I DON'T?

735
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:11,100
BECAUSE THERE'D BE
A MANDATORY HEARING,

736
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,868
AND THIS WHOLE EMBARRASSMENT

737
00:45:12,868 --> 00:45:17,300
WOULD BECOME
A MATTER OF RECORD.

738
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,033
NO ONE NEEDS TO HEAR
ABOUT YOUR STUPID THEORIES.

739
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:23,834
IT WOULD TEAR
THIS DEPARTMENT APART.

740
00:45:23,834 --> 00:45:24,968
UNDERSTOOD?

741
00:45:24,968 --> 00:45:28,234
- SURE.

742
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:30,801
- HE JUST LOST HIS WIFE,
FOR CHRISSAKES!

743
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,167
- HEY, SKEEZEY...

744
00:45:46,167 --> 00:45:48,434
WHERE YOU BEEN ALL DAY?

745
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:51,534
- VERY, UH, LONG,
FUCKED UP STORY.

746
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,801
I HEARD ABOUT THE RAID.

747
00:45:57,801 --> 00:45:59,634
- PERP GOT AWAY.

748
00:45:59,634 --> 00:46:02,634
- WHAT I HEARD WAS
YOU SAVED SOMEONE'S LIFE.

749
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:09,501
I LET YOU DOWN.

750
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:14,567
I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE
TO BACK YOU UP.

751
00:46:14,567 --> 00:46:15,701
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD'VE.

752
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:17,534
- YEAH.

753
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:24,167
YOU OKAY?

754
00:46:24,167 --> 00:46:26,868
- I GUESS NOT, 'CAUSE EVERYBODY
KEEPS ASKING ME THAT.

755
00:46:31,234 --> 00:46:33,367
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE
TONIGHT.

756
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:39,734
- DEB, I'M, UH...

757
00:46:39,734 --> 00:46:41,968
NO GOOD FOR YOU.

758
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:45,501
- I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR GOOD RIGHT NOW.

759
00:46:53,701 --> 00:46:56,067
[crickets chirping]

760
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,534
- IS THAT TRUE...

761
00:47:01,534 --> 00:47:04,701
WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

762
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:09,901
- YES.

763
00:47:15,434 --> 00:47:17,968
- HOW DID IT HAPPEN?

764
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:21,133
- KNIFE.

765
00:47:29,868 --> 00:47:33,501
PAINFUL AND CRUEL.

766
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:41,701
- I'M SORRY...

767
00:47:41,701 --> 00:47:44,167
THAT I CUT YOU.

768
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:50,901
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A MONSTER, LIKE BOYD.

769
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,434
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA KILL ME.

770
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:59,200
OR WORSE.

771
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:06,133
I WAS LOCKED UP.

772
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,801
I DON'T KNOW WHERE,
OR FOR HOW LONG.

773
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:15,300
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
IT WAS HORRIBLE.

774
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,934
AND I THOUGHT...
IT WOULD NEVER STOP.

775
00:48:28,934 --> 00:48:32,634
- BUT IT HAS STOPPED.
HE'S DEAD. IT'S OVER.

776
00:48:32,634 --> 00:48:35,601
YOU CAN GO HOME.

777
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:38,267
- I DON'T THINK SO.

778
00:48:38,267 --> 00:48:40,434
- YOU CAN.

779
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:46,300
I READ YOUR LETTER. I KNOW
YOU HAVE A FAMILY WHO LOVES YOU.

780
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:50,000
YOU SHOULD GO HOME TO THEM.

781
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,667
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

782
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:57,434
- IT IS.

783
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,367
IT REALLY IS.

784
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:09,734
- BOYD WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

785
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:14,167
THERE WERE OTHERS.

786
00:49:23,367 --> 00:49:26,501
IT'S NOT OVER.
