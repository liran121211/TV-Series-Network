00:00:14,634 --> 00:00:16,667
SO THAT MEANS HE KNOWS
THAT WE'RE ONTO HIM.

00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,567
TELL ME WHY THEY WOULD EVER
RETURN TO THIS CLUB.

00:00:18,567 --> 00:00:20,834
- YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT
AT CLUB MAYAN.

7
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:23,701
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

8
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:25,767
- THIS IS YASMIN ARAGON.

9
00:00:25,767 --> 00:00:27,901
IF WE AGREE TO DROP
HER DRUG CHARGES,

10
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:31,367
SHE THINKS SHE CAN GET THE
FUENTES BROTHERS IN THE CLUB.

11
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:32,701
- HEY.

12
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,601
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
A DEBRIEFING

13
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,601
BEFORE WE HIT CLUB MAYAN.

14
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,434
- UM, IT'S SORT OF NOT
A GOOD TIME.

15
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:40,934
THIS IS STAN LIDDY.

16
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,701
- YOU ARE BONING
OUR TARGET'S SISTER?

17
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:46,334
- JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU FOUND
OUT ON DEXTER MORGAN.

18
00:00:46,334 --> 00:00:48,534
- YOU FUCKED
EVERYTHING UP, BOYD.

EVERY ONE OF THESE BARRELS
HAS A BODY IN IT.

23
00:00:57,801 --> 00:01:00,133
- BOYD WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

24
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,267
THERE WERE OTHERS.

25
00:01:01,267 --> 00:01:02,734
I SHOT ONE OF THEM.

26
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:04,133
DEXTER, WHAT DO I DO?

27
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:08,133
- THAT LAST FUCKING BITCH
IS ALIVE.

THEY'RE GONNA FIND YOU.

29
00:01:11,434 --> 00:01:14,200
- SOME EXPERIENCES ARE SO BIG
THEY CHANGE YOUR DNA.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,934
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND
THE REST OF THEM,

31
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:18,901
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT
I CAN FEEL THIS PEACE AGAIN.

32
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:21,400
- I CAN'T GET REVENGE
FOR RITA'S DEATH,

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,100
BUT I CAN HELP LUMEN AVENGE
WHAT WAS DONE TO HER.

34
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,033
HOW MANY MORE WERE THERE?

37
00:03:24,734 --> 00:03:28,400
- IT'S BEEN OVER A MONTH
SINCE I FREED LUMEN FROM BOYD'S,

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,400
BUT SHE'S STILL
RELIVING IT EVERY DAY.

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,000
HEY.
I BROUGHT FOOD.

40
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,767
- OH.

41
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,767
- HAVE YOU EATEN?

42
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,334
- I ATE THIS MORNING.

43
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:44,834
- WELL, NOW IT'S NIGHT.

44
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:48,367
EAT SOME MORE.

45
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:51,067
- YOU'RE VERY...CONTROLLING.

46
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:53,701
- WHEN I NEED TO BE.

47
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,434
SO WHAT ELSE?

48
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:05,100
DETAILS WOULD HELP.

49
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,501
- BESIDES THE ONES
THAT WE'VE ALREADY...

50
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,367
TAKEN CARE OF...

51
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:12,033
THERE WAS WATCH GUY.

52
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:14,400
- "WATCH GUY"?

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,033
- I WOULD BE TIED
TO A CHAIR...

54
00:04:18,033 --> 00:04:19,267
BLINDFOLDED.

55
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,901
SOMETIMES I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
IF HE WAS THERE

56
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:26,434
UNTIL I'D HEAR THIS WATCH
BY MY EAR.

57
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,801
AND THEN HE'D LEAN IN
AND WHISPER,

58
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:31,868
"TICK, TICK, TICK.

59
00:04:31,868 --> 00:04:36,767
THAT'S THE SOUND OF YOUR LIFE
RUNNING OUT."

60
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:41,434
- OKAY.
ANYONE ELSE?

61
00:04:41,434 --> 00:04:44,601
- SUIT AND TIE.

62
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:48,100
HE'D TAKE OFF HIS JACKET
AND FOLD IT...

63
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,133
VERY CAREFULLY
AND THEN LAY IT ON A CHAIR,

64
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,400
LIKE HE DIDN'T WANT
TO MESS IT UP.

65
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,501
SUIT GUY I'D KNOW.

66
00:04:57,501 --> 00:05:01,767
HE ALWAYS TOOK
THE BLINDFOLD OFF.

67
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,834
I GUESS HE THOUGHT
I'D BE DEAD SOON.

68
00:05:03,834 --> 00:05:06,801
- HE WAS WRONG.

- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

73
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,400
HOW DO WE FIND THEM?

74
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
- I'M NOT SURE "WE" IS
THE OPERATING WORD HERE.

75
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,701
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

76
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:13,901
WE'RE DOING THIS TOGETHER.

77
00:06:13,901 --> 00:06:16,334
- LUMEN, WHAT I DO,
I DO ALONE.

78
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,534
I DON'T NEED A PARTNER.

79
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:19,901
I SAID I'D HELP YOU,
BUT--

80
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:22,667
- FINE.
FORGET IT.

81
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,467
- FORGET IT?

82
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,834
- THERE'S NO POINT TO IT, THEN.

83
00:06:25,834 --> 00:06:28,100
- YOU WANT THESE MEN
BROUGHT TO JUSTICE?

84
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,701
- YEAH, AND I CAN'T GO
TO THE COPS BECAUSE OF YOU.

85
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:36,467
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE
A LITTLE FLEXIBLE HERE.

86
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,968
I WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS.

87
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:45,968

- RIGHT.

94

THE OTHER PART OF YOUR LIFE.

95
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:28,734
- THERE IS NO OTHER PART
TO LUMEN'S LIFE.

96
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:32,267
THIS IS ALL SHE HAS.

97
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,067
EVEN SO, I CAN'T BRING HER
INTO MY WORLD.

AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE LUMEN
FITS INTO MY WORLD,

179
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,767
BECAUSE IT WAS ONLY
APPLIED TOPICALLY,

180
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,701
THE INTERNAL ORGANS
OF THE CADAVERS

181
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:09,701
CONTINUED TO PUTREFY AND LEAK
OUT OF THE VARIOUS

182
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,901
BODILY ORIFICES,
BECOMING CONGEALED

183
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:13,667
ONCE THEY CAME IN CONTACT
WITH THE FORMALIN.

184
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:14,901
THAT'S WHAT'S ON YOUR SHOE--

185
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:18,868
CONGEALED ORGAN.

186
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:21,567
- WHAT KIND OF SICK FUCK
ARE WE DEALING WITH?

187
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,868
- I'M JUST THE BLOOD GUY.

188
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,400
- WE'VE GOT FIVE VICTIMS--

189
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
ALL FEMALE, ALL BLONDE,

190
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,300
ALL BETWEEN THE AGES
OF 20 AND 35, I'M GUESSING.

191
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,267
THEY'RE COVERED IN BRUISES,
CONTUSIONS, WHIP MARKS.

192
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:35,467
LOOKS LIKE THEY WENT THROUGH
SOME SPECIAL KIND OF HELL.

193
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,167
WE'LL GET FINGERPRINTS OFF THEM
ONCE WE GET 'EM

194
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,767
TO THE M.E.'S OFFICE.

195
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,367
- I HEARD
THE DRIVER TOOK OFF.

196
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:41,934
- YEAH, WE'VE GOT THE GUY
THAT HIT HIM.

197
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:43,601
HE WAS DRUNK
OFF HIS FREAKING ASS.

198
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:45,934
HE SAID HE SAW SOME GUY
JUMP OUT AND START RUNNING,

199
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:48,067
BUT THAT'S AS DETAILED
AS HIS DESCRIPTION GETS--

200
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,234
"SOME GUY."

201
00:12:49,234 --> 00:12:52,601
- THAT MEANS HE'S STILL MINE
TO FIND...

202
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:59,033
OR VINCE MASUKA'S.

203
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:00,234
HEY.

204
00:13:00,234 --> 00:13:04,167
- HEY, DEX.

205
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:06,067
THAT'S SOME
PRETTY CRAZY SHIT, HUH?

206
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:08,133
- YEAH, CRAZY SHIT.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

207
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,400
- UH...

208
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,334
ONE MEN'S SUIT JACKET,
SIZE 40.

209
00:13:15,334 --> 00:13:17,901
- DID YOU FOLD IT,
OR WAS IT ALREADY LIKE THAT?

210
00:13:17,901 --> 00:13:21,200
- I BAGGED IT AS I FOUND IT.

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,968
I ALSO GOT
FINGERPRINTS GALORE...

212
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,467
- EXCELLENT.

213
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,934
- EXCEPT
FOR THE STEERING WHEEL.

214
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,334
SOMEBODY GAVE IT A QUICK WIPE.

215
00:13:27,334 --> 00:13:29,501
I'LL GET THE VEHICLE BACK
TO THE LAB,

216
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:31,467
AND WE'LL GIVE IT
A MORE THOROUGH GOING-OVER.

217
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,400
- RIGHT.

218
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,033
SO MUCH FOR KEEPING
MY LIVES SEPARATE.

219
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:47,834
[cell phone vibrates]

220
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,434
[keypad tone]
- YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

221
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:51,234
- WHAT YOU DOING, BOY?
SLEEPING LATE?

222
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:52,834
YOUR BUDDY DEXTER MORGAN--
YOU ASKED ME

223
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,601
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
- YEAH?

224
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,801
AND?

225
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,634
- WELL, HE'S GOT SOME CUTIE
UP AT HIS HOUSE.

226
00:13:57,634 --> 00:13:59,300
HE EVEN TOOK DOWN
THE "FOR SALE" SIGN.

227
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,467
- WHAT'S THIS GIRL LOOK LIKE?

228
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,534
- BLONDE, AVERAGE HEIGHT,
LATE 20s.

229
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:05,267
- SLIM, PRETTY?

230
00:14:05,267 --> 00:14:06,801
- THAT'D BE HER.

231
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:07,968
- FIND OUT WHO SHE IS.

232
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:09,567
- YOU BETCHA.
[keypad tone]

233
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:10,968
- COME HERE.

234
00:14:10,968 --> 00:14:12,200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

235
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,033
- I SAW THE NEWS.

236
00:14:14,033 --> 00:14:15,601
I KNEW WHAT IT WAS.
I HAD TO COME.

237
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:16,868
- NO, YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO COME.

238
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:19,467
- DEXTER, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ONE OF THOSE GIRLS.

239
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,567
- LOOK, IT'S NOT SAFE
FOR YOU HERE.

240
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:22,801
THEY COULD BE WATCHING.

241
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,234
- WHAT IS THIS?

242
00:14:25,234 --> 00:14:26,467
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

243
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,367
- IT MEANS THEY'RE ON THE RUN.

244
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,467
YOU NEED TO GO.

245
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,601
- WILL YOU GIVE ME--
THANK YOU.

246
00:14:51,868 --> 00:14:53,601
SHIT A BRICK
AND FUCK ME WITH IT.

247
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,968
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GUESS
WHO THIS TRUCK IS REGISTERED TO.

248
00:14:56,968 --> 00:15:00,000
JORDAN CHASE.

249
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,033
- JORDAN CHASE
IS A VERY SMART GUY.

250
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:07,234
HIS FIRST BOOK
MADE ME REALIZE

251
00:15:07,234 --> 00:15:10,000
HOW I'D BEEN PUTTING
ALL THESE LIMITATIONS ON MYSELF.

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,367
I MEAN, I'VE LISTENED
TO ALL HIS CDs.

253
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,167
- SO DID BOYD FOWLER.

254
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:17,734
YOU THINK JORDAN COULD HAVE BEEN
DRIVING THAT TRUCK?

255
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:18,834
- WHAT?

256
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,467
NO WAY.

257
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:23,000
FIRST OFF,
THAT JACKET IS NICE,

258
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,834
BUT NOT THAT NICE.

259
00:15:24,834 --> 00:15:27,200
JORDAN WEARS NOTHING
BUT THE BEST.

260
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
THAT'S PART OF HIS THING.

261
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,400
IF YOU THINK
YOU DESERVE SOMETHING,

262
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,701
THEN TAKE IT.

263
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:37,534
[sighs]

264
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,434
I'VE LIFTED
TWO DOZEN FINGERPRINTS,

265
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:42,200
AND THEY ALL SEEM TO BELONG
TO THE SAME PERSON.

266
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,167
[sighs]
AND WHOEVER THEY BELONG TO,

267
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:47,501
HE'S NOT IN THE AFIS DATABASE.

268
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:50,367
DEAD END.

269
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:53,868
OOH, A HAIR.

270
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:01,367
AND ANOTHER ONE.

271
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:04,100
[chuckles]

272
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,400
- IT'S NOT OFTEN I'M IN
COMPETITION WITH MY OWN PEOPLE,

273
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,601
BUT GETTING THE IDENTITY
OF THE DRIVER OF THE TRUCK

274
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,400
AND GETTING TO HIM
BEFORE THEY DO

275
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,634
IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN GIVE LUMEN
WHAT I PROMISED.

276
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:21,067
- ALL I GET
IS A FUCKING COMPUTER.

277
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,734
I CAN ORDER JORDAN CHASE BOOKS.

278
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:24,300
I CAN ORDER JORDAN CHASE CDs,

279
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,501
BUT I CAN'T TALK
TO AN ACTUAL PERSON.

280
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,901
- JORDAN CHASE IS A REALLY
POPULAR MAN, YOU KNOW?

281
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:32,934
HE TRAVELS THE WORLD GIVING HIS
LITTLE TOUCHY-FEELY SEMINARS.

282
00:16:32,934 --> 00:16:35,167
HE'S PROBABLY NOT EVEN
IN MIAMI RIGHT NOW.

283
00:16:35,167 --> 00:16:36,767
- I'VE LEFT MESSAGES
ALL OVER.

284
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,501
IF I DON'T HEAR BACK SOON,
I'M GONNA KICK THEIR DOOR IN.

285
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:41,200
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
ANYTHING?

286
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,868
- YEAH, WE'VE I.D.'D TWO
OF THE GIRLS

287
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,868
OFF THEIR FINGERPRINTS.

288
00:16:44,868 --> 00:16:46,968
ONE WAS A SCHOOLTEACHER
FROM WISCONSIN.

289
00:16:46,968 --> 00:16:49,100
SHE CAME OUT HERE ON VACATION
TWO YEARS AGO--

290
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,501
NEVER HEARD FROM AGAIN.

291
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:53,434
THE OTHER ONE WORKED ON A CRUISE
SHIP THAT WAS DOCKED HERE.

292
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,434
SHE DISAPPEARED
JUST OVER A YEAR AGO.

293
00:16:55,434 --> 00:16:56,901
- WOW.

294
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:59,367
- YEAH, THESE WERE GOOD GIRLS,
YOU KNOW?

295
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:01,767
ONE WAS 26.
ONE WAS 29.

296
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,300
- NOTHING ON THE OTHER THREE?

297
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:06,133
- NO, I'M GOING THROUGH
THE MISSING-PERSON DATABASES,

298
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:07,634
PUT THEIR
PHOTOGRAPHS OUT THERE.

299
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:09,000
- DNA?

300
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,534
- IT'S BEING RUN NOW.

301
00:17:10,534 --> 00:17:12,801
LOOKING FOR DIRECT HITS
AND FAMILIAL HITS.

302
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:14,334
- LISTEN...

303
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,634
I HEARD ABOUT THIS TWO-BEDROOM
PLACE ON BRICKELL--

304
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,334
UPPER UNIT,
RIGHT ON THE WATER.

305
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,834
THOUGHT WE COULD TAKE A LOOK.

306
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,334
- THIS IS NOT
A WORKPLACE CONVERSATION,

307
00:17:21,334 --> 00:17:22,667
SO PLEASE JUST SHUT UP.

308
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,033
- ALL I'M SAYING IS,
IS THIS PLACE IS GOING FAST.

309
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:26,734
- LISTEN, PLEASE,
JUST NOT HERE.

310
00:17:26,734 --> 00:17:29,200
- YOU TWO...

311
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,667
NOW.

312
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:36,767
- SHIT.

313
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,501
THINK SHE KNOWS ABOUT US?

314
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:48,968
IS THIS ABOUT--
- THE SANTA MUERTE CASE.

315
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:51,033
- OH.

316
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:52,300
I THOUGHT THAT WAS DEAD.

317
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:55,267
- WELL, NOW IT'S ALIVE, BARELY.

318
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:58,968
- YASMIN ARAGON, THE ASSOCIATE
OF THE FUENTES BROTHERS

319
00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:01,200
THAT SERGEANT BATISTA
IDENTIFIED,

320
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,434
HAS ASSURED US
THAT SHE WILL BRING

321
00:18:03,434 --> 00:18:05,667
CARLOS AND MARCO INTO CLUB MAYAN
TOMORROW NIGHT.

322
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,501
- SO WE'RE ON?
- WE ARE ON.

323
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:09,934
- I AM PERSONALLY OVERSEEING
THIS OPERATION.

324
00:18:09,934 --> 00:18:12,434
WE CAN'T RISK WORD LEAKING OUT
TO THE FUENTES,

325
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:14,367
SO IT'S STRICTLY
ON A NEED-TO-KNOW BASIS.

326
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:17,367
RATHER THAN FLOODING
THE CLUB WITH POLICE PERSONNEL,

327
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:20,334
WE WILL BE PERFORMING
A SMALL SURGICAL OPERATION.

328
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,067
WE WILL TAKE THE BROTHERS
INTO CUSTODY

329
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,334
BEFORE THEY GET INTO THE CLUB.

330
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:24,801
- DETECTIVE MORGAN,
YOU'LL BE WITH ME

331
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,501
IN THE SURVEILLANCE VAN.

332
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:28,501
DETECTIVE QUINN,
WE'RE GONNA POST YOU

333
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:30,934
INSIDE THE DOOR OF THE CLUB
WITH OFFICER MANZON.

334
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,200
- I WILL BE ROVING,
PLACING MYSELF

335
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,901
WHEREVER I BELIEVE
MOST EFFECTIVE.

336
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,734
- IF WE'RE GONNA
TAKE THEM OUTSIDE,

337
00:18:35,734 --> 00:18:38,400
SHOULDN'T WE BE OUTSIDE?

338
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,834
- IN ORDER NOT TO STAND OUT
LIKE SORE THUMBS,

339
00:18:40,834 --> 00:18:43,467
WE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE POSTS
WE'VE ALREADY ESTABLISHED.

340
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,467
THANK YOU,
DETECTIVES MORGAN AND QUINN.

341
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:48,801
THAT'LL BE ALL.

342
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:51,167
- MARIA...

343
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:54,601
LET ME MAKE MYSELF VERY CLEAR.

344
00:18:54,601 --> 00:18:57,100
YOU'VE WASTED MORE THAN ENOUGH
TIME AND MONEY

345
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,267
ON THIS CASE ALREADY.

346
00:18:59,267 --> 00:19:01,667
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A MASTER
MANIPULATOR OF THE PRESS,

347
00:19:01,667 --> 00:19:03,300
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ABLE
TO DO THAT.

348
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,400
EVERY DAY I PICK UP THE PAPER,
READ ANOTHER STORY

349
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,434
ABOUT HOW WE'RE NOT
DOING OUR JOB.

350
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:09,634
GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME...

351
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:11,634
OR WE'RE GONNA HAVE
AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION

352
00:19:11,634 --> 00:19:16,100
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

353
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,167
- [sighs]

354
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:24,834
WHERE ARE WE
WITH JORDAN CHASE?

355
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:27,567
- I'VE GOT QUINN ON IT.

356
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:29,801
WE'VE MADE NUMEROUS CALLS
TO HIS ORGANIZATION,

357
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:32,734
BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
REACH HIM PERSONALLY JUST YET.

358
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,534
HE COULD BE PLAYING
HARD TO GET.

359
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:36,133
[elevator bell rings]
IN THAT CASE,

360
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,868
WE'LL PAY HIS OFFICE A VISIT
TO SEE IF, UH--

361
00:19:37,868 --> 00:19:40,968
- PROBABLY WON'T BE NECESSARY.

362
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,701
- JORDAN CHASE.

363
00:19:46,701 --> 00:19:48,367
- UH, HI.

364
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:53,801
- HOLY SHIT.
THAT'S HIM.

365
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:56,567
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

366
00:19:56,567 --> 00:19:59,734
- YOU TOO.

367
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:02,400
- MR. CHASE?
OH, MR. CHASE.

368
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,801
- STAND BACK.
- I, UM--I, UH--

369
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,400
I TOOK ONE OF YOUR SEMINARS
AT THE BEACH CLUB

370
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,868
A WHILE BACK.

371
00:20:06,868 --> 00:20:08,400
- SURE.
IN PALMETTO BAY.

372
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,834
- YOU REMEMBER?

373
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,467
- OF COURSE I DO.

374
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:12,901
YOU HAVE TO EXCUSE COLE HERE.

375
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,801
HE, UH--HE KEEPS
THE CRAZIES AWAY.

376
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:17,467
- WHY DON'T YOU LET ME GET
A PICTURE OF YOU TWO?

377
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,934
- OH, YEAH.
EXCELLENT. OKAY.

378
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:22,567
OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

379
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,567
SMILE.
[camera shutter clicks]

380
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,767
UH, ONE MORE.

381
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,534
[camera shutter clicks]

382
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:28,767
GOT IT.

383
00:20:28,767 --> 00:20:30,734
- JORDAN CHASE.

384
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:34,234
- DEXTER MORGAN.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

385
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,767
- WOW.
NICE WATCH.

386
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,834
- OH, UH, MY DAD
GAVE IT TO ME

387
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,167
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER.

388
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:42,100
IT'S, UH, WATER-RESISTANT
TO 100 METERS.

389
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,000
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY
I WOULD EVER NEED THAT,

390
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
BUT IT SURE LOOKS NICE.

391
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,801
- IF THAT'S THE WATCH
THAT LUMEN HEARD,

392
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:48,133
I'LL MAKE SURE IT
ACCOMPANIES YOU

393
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:51,267
TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE ATLANTIC.

394
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:52,634
- MR. CHASE.

395
00:20:52,634 --> 00:20:55,901
- YOU MUST BE THE PERSON
IN CHARGE AROUND HERE.

396
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,467
I WAS IN JACKSONVILLE,

397
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:59,234
GOT AN EARLY CALL
FROM COLE HERE,

398
00:20:59,234 --> 00:21:01,300
MY HEAD OF SECURITY,
SAYING THAT ONE OF OUR TRUCKS

399
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,701
HAD BEEN STOLEN
OUT OF OUR LOT

400
00:21:02,701 --> 00:21:04,133
AND THAT IT JUST MIGHT
BE THE ONE

401
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:06,400
WE'D ALL BEEN WATCHING
ON THE NEWS.

402
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,868
I FLEW BACK
AS SOON AS I COULD.

403
00:21:07,868 --> 00:21:10,033
- I SEE.

404
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:12,901
- WE FOUND AN ARTICLE
OF CLOTHING IN THE VEHICLE.

405
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:15,501
- MY JACKET.
IT'S MY PERSONAL VEHICLE.

406
00:21:15,501 --> 00:21:17,968
I ALWAYS LEAVE
MY THINGS INSIDE.

407
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:19,767
- AND THE KEYS?
- THE KEYS?

408
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,033
- YEAH, WE FOUND THE KEYS
IN THE IGNITION.

409
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:25,100
THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS
TO STEAL A CAR.

410
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,400
MOST THIEVES DON'T HAVE
THE ACTUAL KEY.

411
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,434
- I LEAVE A SPARE SET OF KEYS
ON A HOOK INSIDE OUR OFFICE.

412
00:21:32,434 --> 00:21:34,334
ALL MY GUYS KNOW WHERE
TO FIND THEM,

413
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,934
IN CASE THEY NEED THE TRUCK.

414
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:37,801
HONESTLY,
THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE.

415
00:21:37,801 --> 00:21:39,701
ANYONE COULD HAVE GRABBED THEM.

416
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:41,334
- AND YOU'RE HEAD OF SECURITY?

417
00:21:41,334 --> 00:21:43,334
- [scoffs]
YEAH, COLE.

418
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:46,834
I MIGHT HAVE TO TIGHTEN THINGS
UP A BIT, HMM?

419
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:48,968
- [sighs]

420
00:21:48,968 --> 00:21:51,501
- I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR
THAT THE MIAMI POLICE DEPARTMENT

421
00:21:51,501 --> 00:21:53,133
HAS MY FULL COOPERATION.

422
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:56,067
MY ORGANIZATION
IS COMPLETELY OPEN TO YOU.

423
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:59,000
THIS IS A HORRIBLE,
HORRIBLE TRAGEDY.

424
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,100
PLEASE, ANYTHING I CAN DO
TO HELP FACILITATE

425
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,534
ITS RESOLUTION.

426
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:03,834
- WELL, THANK YOU, MR. CHASE.

427
00:22:03,834 --> 00:22:05,334
- FIRST, WE'RE GONNA NEED
FINGERPRINTS

428
00:22:05,334 --> 00:22:08,567
AND HAIR SAMPLES
FROM ALL YOUR EMPLOYEES,

429
00:22:08,567 --> 00:22:10,033
STARTING WITH COLE.

430
00:22:10,033 --> 00:22:11,367
- ABSOLUTELY.

431
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:13,234
AND IF I COULD ASK ONE FAVOR?

432
00:22:13,234 --> 00:22:15,567
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF MY NAME
AND ORGANIZATION

433
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,300
WASN'T RELEASED TO THE PRESS.

434
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,734
BEING CONNECTED TO THIS IN ANY
WAY WOULD BE A P.R. NIGHTMARE.

435
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:23,701
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

436
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:26,067
- AS LONG AS WE HAVE
YOUR CONTINUED COOPERATION,

437
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,467
THAT SHOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

438
00:22:28,467 --> 00:22:30,901
- SOCIOPATHS CAN'T FEEL
PSYCHIC PAIN,

439
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:32,567
BUT THEY CAN FEEL
PHYSICAL PAIN.

440
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:34,033
- OW.

441
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:36,667
- SORRY.

442
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:42,567
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT COLE?

443
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,033
- "IT WASN'T ME.

444
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:49,067
SOMEONE STOLE MY VEHICLE."

445
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,701
THE OLDEST EXCUSE
IN THE BOOK.

446
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,000
- STILL, IT DOES HAPPEN.

447
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,601
AND MR. CHASE
IS VERY HIGH-PROFILE,

448
00:22:56,601 --> 00:22:59,100
WELL RESPECTED.

449
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,000
IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE
SOMEONE LIKE HIM

450
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,234
OR HIS PEOPLE WOULD BE INVOLVED
IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

451
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,501
- I TOOK A FEW HAIRS
FROM THE HEADREST

452
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:14,734
OF THE TRUCK AS WELL.

453
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,067
IF SOMEONE ELSE WAS DRIVING,

454
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:17,534
HE'D HAVE LEFT
SOME EVIDENCE BEHIND.

455
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:19,100
- AND?

456
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,100
- WELL, COLE'S HAIR
MATCHES THE HAIR

457
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,734
ON THE JACKET
AND THE HEADREST.

458
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,300
- FINGERPRINTS?
- THEY'RE ALL COLE'S...

459
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,701
EVEN ON THE IGNITION KEY.

460
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:27,734
- I THINK HE'S JUST
BECOME THE FOCUS

461
00:23:27,734 --> 00:23:29,067
OF OUR INVESTIGATION.

462
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:30,767
- AND JORDAN?

463
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:33,167
- HIS ALIBI HOLDS UP.
HE WAS IN JACKSONVILLE.

464
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:38,000
SO FOR NOW,
WE GOT OUR EYES ON COLE.

465
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:56,901
- LUMEN?

466
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,501
- DEXTER, YOU NEED
TO ANNOUNCE YOURSELF.

467
00:23:59,501 --> 00:24:01,434
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMING IN.

468
00:24:01,434 --> 00:24:04,801
- BUT IT'S OKAY TO HAVE PACKAGES
DELIVERED HERE?

469
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:08,601
[package thuds]

470
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:09,801
- I NEED THINGS.

471
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:13,234
YOU SAID NOT
TO LEAVE THE HOUSE.

472
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:21,968
- AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO WITH THAT?

473
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:26,200
- IT'S JUST A FLASHLIGHT.

474
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,767
- YOU HAVE A WAY
OF BENDING THE RULES.

475
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:36,501
- WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THE CASE?

476
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,100
[keypad tones]

477
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,334
- DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

478
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:45,234
- OH, MY GOD.

479
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,767
THAT'S HIM.

480
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,868
THAT'S THE GUY
WHO FOLDED HIS JACKET.

481
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:51,534
HOW DID YOU FIND HIM?

482
00:24:51,534 --> 00:24:53,033
- HE FOUND US.

483
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,534
HIS NAME'S COLE HARMON.

484
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,701
HE'S JORDAN CHASE'S
HEAD OF SECURITY.

485
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:01,534
[keypad tone]

486
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:04,033
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

487
00:25:04,033 --> 00:25:05,701
- [sighs]
NO, I--

488
00:25:05,701 --> 00:25:07,400
I MEAN, THAT GUY'S
CLEARLY A FREAK,

489
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,567
BUT I DON'T KNOW HIM.

490
00:25:09,567 --> 00:25:11,767
- NO, NOT THE BALD GUY.
THE GUY BESIDE HIM--

491
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:12,834
JORDAN CHASE.

492
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:14,467
- OH.

493
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,067
NO, I DON'T KNOW HIM EITHER.
- YOU SURE?

494
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,901
- I TOLD YOU, I DIDN'T SEE
MOST OF THEIR FACES.

495
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:23,667
- [sighs]

496
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:25,234
- WHO IS HE?

497
00:25:25,234 --> 00:25:29,000
- HE'S SOME SORT
OF MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER.

498
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,734
- THIS GUY...
I DEFINITELY KNOW.

499
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:35,200
WHAT NEXT?

500
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,501
- WELL, THERE'S A PROBLEM.
THE HOMICIDE TEAM IS ON THIS.

501
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:40,100
THEY'LL PROBABLY ARREST HIM
WITHIN THE NEXT FEW DAYS,

502
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,000
AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS,
COLE WILL NEVER SEE

503
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,501
THE OUTSIDE
OF A PRISON CELL AGAIN.

504
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,834
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUYS?

505
00:25:46,834 --> 00:25:51,000
- IN ORDER TO SAVE HIS OWN SKIN,
HE'LL PROBABLY TURN THEM IN.

506
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,100
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY'RE ALL

507
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,033
IN THE HANDS OF THE POLICE.

508
00:26:00,701 --> 00:26:02,901
BUT THIS IS FLORIDA.
WE EXECUTE HERE.

509
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:07,234
THESE MEN WILL BE BROUGHT
TO JUSTICE.

510
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,634
YOU CAN WALK AWAY
FROM ALL OF THIS NOW,

511
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:10,701
PUT IT BEHIND YOU.

512
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:13,300
YOU CAN GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE.

513
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,200
- NO.

514
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,767
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

515
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:20,033
- I PROMISE YOU THE POLICE
WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.

516
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:22,234
- NO, I DON'T WANT THE POLICE
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

517
00:26:22,234 --> 00:26:24,968
I--I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

518
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:26,567
- I KNOW HOW SHE FEELS.

519
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,834
IT'S NOT SO DIFFERENT
FROM ME.

520
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:33,734
HOW MUCH COFFEE
ARE YOU DRINKING?

521
00:26:33,734 --> 00:26:35,067
- A LOT.

522
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:36,567
I HAVE TO STAY AWAKE.

523
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,567
WHAT IF THEY COME
FOR ME AT NIGHT?

524
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:40,434
- SHE'S STRESSED, ON EDGE--

525
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,133
THE WAY I FEEL
WHEN I'VE GONE TOO LONG

526
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,567
WITHOUT PUTTING SOMEONE
ON MY TABLE.

527
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:46,734
- YOU SAID YOU'D HELP ME.

528
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:48,000
- I DID.

529
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,334
I JUST DON'T KNOW
THAT HELPING YOU

530
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:51,400
KILL SOMEONE
IS ACTUALLY HELPING YOU.

531
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,100
- [sighs]

532
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,367
THIS IS ALL I THINK ABOUT.

533
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,868
DON'T BACK OUT NOW.

534
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,200
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

535
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,534
- [sighs]

536
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:09,167
TRUTH IS, I ACTUALLY WANT
TO HELP HER...

537
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,767
[sighs]

538
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:14,934
FOR SOME
VERY COMPLICATED REASONS.

539
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:18,367
IF WE WANT COLE
FOR OURSELVES,

540
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:21,601
I HAVE TO DERAIL
THE POLICE INVESTIGATION,

541
00:27:21,601 --> 00:27:23,934
WHICH MEANS GIVING THEM
ANOTHER SUSPECT.

542
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,167
- WHO?

543
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:29,400
- THE MAN WHO ACTUALLY KILLED
ALL THOSE GIRLS--

544
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,801
BOYD FOWLER.

545
00:27:53,801 --> 00:27:56,167
HERE, PUT THESE ON.

546
00:27:57,901 --> 00:27:59,934
FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO
IS REMOVE ANY EVIDENCE

547
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:01,767
THAT YOU WERE EVER HERE
AT BOYD'S HOUSE.

548
00:28:01,767 --> 00:28:06,434
IF THE POLICE FIND
YOUR FINGERPRINTS OR...

549
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,634
ANYTHING THAT TIES YOU
TO THIS PLACE,

550
00:28:08,634 --> 00:28:10,467
THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

551
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:12,300
TO BOYD FOWLER IS...

552
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,067
HOW YOU GOT HERE...

553
00:28:15,067 --> 00:28:19,334
HOW YOU GOT OUT.

554
00:28:19,334 --> 00:28:23,567
- THAT'S WHERE YOU
FIRST FOUND ME.

555
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:26,133
- WE NEED TO GO UP.

556
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:31,734
YOU OKAY?

557
00:28:31,734 --> 00:28:34,667
I'LL BE WITH YOU.

558
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,100
- [breathes sharply]

559
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,767
OH, GOD.

560
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:58,100
- YOU OKAY?
WE CAN LEAVE.

561
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,100
- NO.

562
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:05,968
HE KEPT ME TIED UP...
OVER THERE.

563
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:12,801
I DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG I WAS HERE...

564
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:17,100
MAYBE A COUPLE DAYS.

565
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,234
ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE BROUGHT ME
HERE TO KILL ME.

566
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:25,434
- I'M GUESSING
THAT WAS HIS JOB.

567
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:27,968
HE WAS THE FINISHER.

568
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:36,100
- THE LAST DAY,
I CHEWED ON THAT ROPE FOR HOURS.

569
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,634
I WAS FINALLY ABLE
TO SLIP IT OFF.

570
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:40,667
THAT'S WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS,
AND I SAW YOU--

571
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:46,167
- DO WHAT I DID.

572
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:50,434
- [exhales sharply]

573
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,567
IS THAT IT?

574
00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:06,801
- YEAH.

575
00:30:06,801 --> 00:30:08,534
I JUST NEED SOMETHING
OF BOYD'S TO PLANT

576
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:11,367
IN THE TRUCK
FROM THE ACCIDENT.

577
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:16,133
HIS WALLET.

578
00:30:16,133 --> 00:30:18,167
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT WAS THERE?

579
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,467
- I PUT IT THERE.

580
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:23,667
- HOLD THE FUCKING PHONE,
EVERYONE!

581
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:25,534
I WAS GIVING COLE'S TRUCK
ANOTHER QUICK ONCE-OVER

582
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:28,434
AND I FOUND SOMETHING
THAT OUR BLIND-AS-FUCKING-BATS

583
00:30:28,434 --> 00:30:29,767
LAB GEEKS MISSED.

584
00:30:29,767 --> 00:30:32,434
- WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
- A WALLET.

585
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:34,601
HE PROBABLY HAD IT SITTING
ON THE CONSOLE,

586
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:36,767
AND THEN IT WENT FLYING
WHEN HE GOT HIT.

587
00:30:36,767 --> 00:30:38,934
I FOUND IT UNDER THE SEAT.
- COLE'S WALLET?

588
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:40,868
- NO, THAT'S JUST IT.
IT'S NOT COLE'S.

589
00:30:40,868 --> 00:30:42,767
- WHOSE IS IT?

590
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:46,200
- BOYD FOWLER'S.

591
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,834
- WHO THE FUCK
IS BOYD FOWLER?

592
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:52,767
[indistinct radio chatter]

593
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:57,000
- I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.

594
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,067
- CHECK IT OUT.

595
00:30:59,067 --> 00:31:01,667
THERE ARE LOCKS OF HAIR
IN HERE

596
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:02,968
NUMBERED 1 THROUGH 12.

597
00:31:02,968 --> 00:31:04,200
- 12?

598
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,968
JESUS.

599
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:10,000
WELL, I'LL RUN DNA
ON ALL THE HAIR SAMPLES

600
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,434
AND MATCH IT TO THE VICTIMS.

601
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,701
- THE GUY THAT DID THIS--

602
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:14,534
- DIED EXACTLY
WHERE YOU'RE STANDING.

603
00:31:14,534 --> 00:31:16,667
- HEY.

604
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:20,133
IN HERE.

605
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
THE SAME EXACT BARREL
THE GIRLS WERE IN.

606
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,834
- JESUS.
WHAT'D HE DO WITH THESE?

607
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,400
- THE PRELIMINARY
MEDICAL EXAMINER'S REPORT

608
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,934
SAID ALL THE GIRLS
WERE ELECTROCUTED.

609
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,100
- WE'RE GONNA NEED FORENSICS
IN THE ATTIC.

610
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,601
I THINK HE KEPT
THE GIRLS UP THERE.

611
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:42,133
- IT LOOKS LIKE BOYD FOWLER
HAS BECOME OUR PRIMARY FOCUS.

612
00:31:46,834 --> 00:31:49,734
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

613
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:52,033
- NO.

614
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,667
- WELL, HE KNOWS YOU.

615
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,701
HE HAS ALL YOUR BOOKS
AND CDs IN HIS HOUSE.

616
00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:59,234
- [stammers]

617
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:02,100
I'VE SOLD OVER A MILLION
COPIES OF MY BOOK,

618
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,400
ALMOST AS MANY CDs.

619
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,467
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

620
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:07,267
HOW HE CAME TO BE DRIVING
YOUR TRUCK.

621
00:32:07,267 --> 00:32:09,467
- [sighs]

622
00:32:09,467 --> 00:32:11,300
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT--

623
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,100
- I KNOW HIM...
BOYD FOWLER.

624
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,834
HE WAS ONE OF YOUR STALKERS.

625
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:20,834
- AND HOW COME
I'M JUST NOW HEARING THIS?

626
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:23,400
- NO REASON TO TELL YOU ABOUT
EVERY NUT THAT PASSES THROUGH.

627
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,100
HE NEVER SEEMED
LIKE A SERIOUS THREAT.

628
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,701
HE TOOK A FEW SEMINARS
A WHILE BACK

629
00:32:27,701 --> 00:32:30,133
AND THEN STARTED SHOWING UP
AT OUR OFFICE

630
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:31,467
ASKING FOR MR. CHASE.

631
00:32:31,467 --> 00:32:33,534
I HAD TO ESCORT HIM OFF
THE PREMISES A FEW TIMES.

632
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,701
HE WAS CLEARLY A BIT OFF,

633
00:32:34,701 --> 00:32:37,934
BUT, UH, HE NEVER STRUCK ME
AS DANGEROUS.

634
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:40,400
- HE'S DANGEROUS.

635
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,300
- HE'D BEEN IN AND OUT
OF OUR OFFICES ENOUGH TIMES...

636
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,400
PROBABLY SAW
WHERE I PUT THE KEYS.

637
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,634
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU HAD CONTACT WITH HIM?

638
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,200
- HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
FOR A WHILE...

639
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,634
COUPLE OF MONTHS MAYBE.

640
00:32:54,634 --> 00:32:56,501
- ANY IDEA WHERE HE MIGHT BE?

641
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:59,968
- NO.

642
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:03,634
- WE HAVE A WARRANT
FOR HIS ARREST.

643
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:07,200
I SUGGEST THAT YOU BE
ESPECIALLY CAUTIOUS, MR. CHASE,

644
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,868
BECAUSE IF HE HAS
A THING FOR YOU,

645
00:33:08,868 --> 00:33:10,334
YOU COULD BE IN DANGER.

646
00:33:10,334 --> 00:33:12,467
- NOTED.

647
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:13,968
- NOW, IF YOU HAVE
ANY CONTACT WITH HIM,

648
00:33:13,968 --> 00:33:16,200
PLEASE GET IN TOUCH
WITH US IMMEDIATELY.

649
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,868
THIS GUY IS VERY BAD NEWS.

650
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:21,200
- I WILL.

651
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,067
- THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

652
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,367
I APPRECIATE IT.

653
00:33:47,968 --> 00:33:50,601
- YOU FINALLY
DID SOMETHING RIGHT...

654
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,567
STEERING THE COPS
TOWARD BOYD--

655
00:33:52,567 --> 00:33:55,300
VERY SMART.

656
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,067
- IT WASN'T ME.

657
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:08,167
- DADDY'S GOING
TO BOCA RATON TONIGHT,

658
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:11,868
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHERE COLE HARMON LIVES.

659
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:15,701
HE'S A BAD MAN.

660
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:17,901
I'M GONNA TRY TO FIND OUT

661
00:34:17,901 --> 00:34:20,767
WHO THE REST
OF HIS BAD-MAN FRIENDS ARE.

662
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,567
YOU WANT THAT?
[knock on door]

663
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,334
[door opens]

664
00:34:24,334 --> 00:34:25,868
- HI.

665
00:34:25,868 --> 00:34:28,734
THERE'S MY ANGEL.

666
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:33,534
LET ME JUST SET
MY THINGS DOWN.

667
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:35,367
- WONDER HOW MUCH LONGER
I'M GONNA BE ABLE

668
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:36,667
TO TALK TO YOU LIKE THIS.

669
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:40,767
SOON YOU'RE GONNA START
TO UNDERSTAND ME.

670
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,534
- HARRISON CLEARLY LOVES
HIS SAINT BRIGID.

671
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:45,467
HE PUT IT
WITH HIS FAVORITE TOYS.

672
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:48,400
- I PUT THAT IN THE TOY BOX.
- SORRY?

673
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,100
- IT'S JUST A STATUE OF A LADY
WHO DIED A LONG TIME AGO.

674
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,400
SHE DOESN'T PROTECT ANYBODY
OR ANYTHING.

675
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,567
I SHOULD GET TO WORK.

676
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:57,100
HERE.
GO TO SONYA.

677
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,033
OH.

678
00:35:01,834 --> 00:35:05,501
- IT'S JUST THIS CAN BE
A VERY DARK WORLD AT TIMES,

679
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:07,367
AND SINCE DEAR BRIGID
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A COMFORT TO ME,

680
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,100
I THOUGHT HARRISON
MIGHT FEEL THE SAME.

681
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,901
I HOPE FOR HIS SAKE,
YOU'D RECONSIDER.

682
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:15,601
- SURE.

683
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:17,701
BYE, BUDDY.

684
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:19,434
[door opens]

685
00:35:19,434 --> 00:35:23,234
- SO, UH...
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING TONIGHT?

686
00:35:23,234 --> 00:35:24,834
- TO THE BIG STAKEOUT?

687
00:35:24,834 --> 00:35:27,734
UM, A DIAPER PROBABLY.

688
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:29,300
- [laughs]

689
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,767
- I'LL HAVE TO SIT IN THAT VAN
WITH BATISTA FOR HOURS.

690
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:35,400
WILL YOU PLEASE NOT WEAR
THAT AWFUL SHIRT

691
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,968
WITH THE PATTERNS ALL OVER IT?

692
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:38,701
IT REALLY MAKES ME DIZZY.

693
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:41,767
- NO, I, UH, ONLY WORE
THAT AS A JOKE.

694
00:35:41,767 --> 00:35:43,200
[knock on door]
- OH.

695
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,367
- HEY, UH, I GOT TO GO.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER TONIGHT.

696
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:48,701
- OKAY.
[keypad tone]

697
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:56,133
- HEY.

698
00:35:56,133 --> 00:35:59,167
- [chuckles] WELL, LOOK AT YOU,
PRETTY AS A PICTURE.

699
00:35:59,167 --> 00:36:00,634
- [chuckles]

700
00:36:00,634 --> 00:36:03,200
I ONLY GOT A FEW MINUTES,
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME?

701
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,868
- I DON'T WORK
FOR FREE, QUINN.

702
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:07,100
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I JUST GAVE YOU 500 BUCKS.

703
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,267
- AND I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE GIRL.

704
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,100
BUT IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT
WHO SHE IS,

705
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,667
WHERE SHE'S FROM, AND WHAT SHE'S
DOING IN THAT DAMN HOUSE,

706
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:15,934
I MIGHT HAVE TO EMPLOY
SOME METHODS

707
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:19,634
JUST A LITTLE BIT UNORTHODOX.

708
00:36:19,634 --> 00:36:21,968
AND FOR THAT,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY.

709
00:36:21,968 --> 00:36:23,868
- I DON'T KNOW.

710
00:36:23,868 --> 00:36:26,067
- I KNOW YOU GOT THE CASH.

711
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:28,000
- YEAH, IT'S NOT THAT.

712
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,334
- [chuckles]

713
00:36:30,334 --> 00:36:33,234
IT'S THE PUSSY.

714
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:34,434
NOW, LOOKY HERE, STUD,

715
00:36:34,434 --> 00:36:35,834
IF YOU'RE BACKING OFF
THIS THING

716
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:37,601
'CAUSE YOU'RE PORKING
THAT GUY'S SISTER,

717
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,801
I'D SAY YOU'VE GOT
YOUR PRIORITIES AS A COP

718
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:43,634
ALL WRONG.

719
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:45,868
I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED
FOR YOU.

720
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:47,934
- I'LL GIVE YOU ANOTHER FIVE.

721
00:36:47,934 --> 00:36:50,667
- [sighs]

722
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:55,634
THAT'LL WORK.

723
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:58,267
[overlapping chatter,
club music]

724
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:03,634
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING
WITH THIS, OKAY?

725
00:37:03,634 --> 00:37:05,300
YOU CAN JUST TALK NORMALLY.

726
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,534
- WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

727
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:08,267
- WE'RE GONNA WALK YOU
THROUGH THE CLUB

728
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,767
SO THAT OUR TEAM CAN GET
A VISUAL ON YOU,

729
00:37:09,767 --> 00:37:12,701
AND THEN YOU'RE JUST GONNA WAIT
BY THE DOOR.

730
00:37:12,701 --> 00:37:14,801
- THE SECOND YOU SEE
THE FUENTES BROTHERS,

731
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:17,167
YOU WALK UP TO THEM,
AND YOU ENGAGE IN CONVERSATION

732
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,667
OUTSIDE OF THE CLUB
UNTIL WE MOVE IN AND TAKE 'EM.

733
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:20,868
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

734
00:37:20,868 --> 00:37:22,400
- TELL 'EM HOW HOT THEY LOOK.

735
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,868
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ANYTHING.

736
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:26,501
WE'RE GONNA BE RIGHT THERE.

737
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:28,934
- I'M GONNA MAKE SURE
WE'RE ALL IN CONTACT.

738
00:37:28,934 --> 00:37:31,334
THIS IS SERGEANT BATISTA.
IS EVERYBODY GETTING THIS?

739
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,767
- LOUD AND CLEAR.
- I CAN HEAR YOU.

740
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,167
- LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ALL
IN PLACE.

741
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:37,734
[club music]

742
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:46,167
* *

743
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,968
- OKAY.

744
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,300
- YOU'LL DO GREAT.

745
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:16,634
- THEY'RE ALREADY HERE.

746
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:19,100
- SAY AGAIN?

747
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,868
- I SAID THEY'RE ALREADY HERE,

748
00:38:20,868 --> 00:38:23,200
SITTING AT THE V.I.P. TABLE.

749
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,467
- OKAY, HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

750
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:25,968
I THOUGHT WE HAD
ALL THE DOORS COVERED.

751
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:27,701
- I DON'T KNOW.

752
00:38:27,701 --> 00:38:30,067
I HEARD THERE'S A SECRET DOOR
FROM THE CLUB NEXT DOOR,

753
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:32,467
BUT I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

754
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
- OKAY, THIS IS
A CHANGE OF PLANS.

755
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,133
YASMIN, GO SIT WITH THEM.

756
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:42,000
WE'RE GONNA SIT TIGHT
UNTIL THEY LEAVE.

757
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,400
ONCE THEY STEP OUTSIDE THE CLUB,
WE TAKE THEM.

758
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,534
LET'S MAKE SURE WE FIND
THAT SECRET DOOR

759
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,467
AND DEPLOY A TEAM THERE AS WELL.
EVERYONE GOT THAT?

760
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:51,734
- GOT IT.
- GOT IT.

761
00:38:57,534 --> 00:39:01,133
- WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

762
00:39:01,133 --> 00:39:03,234
- I KNOW.

763
00:39:03,234 --> 00:39:05,767
- WELL, YOU SAID THERE'S
A SEMINAR IN NAPLES.

764
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:07,767
DON'T YOU THINK HE'S THERE?

765
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:09,801
- PROBABLY.

766
00:39:09,801 --> 00:39:11,667
- SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

767
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,567
- [sighs]

768
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:18,467
THAT...

769
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,534
THE NEIGHBOR TO GO TO BED.

770
00:39:20,534 --> 00:39:22,434
I'M GOING IN.

771
00:39:22,434 --> 00:39:24,567
NO, YOU'RE STAYING HERE.

772
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:26,534
- WHAT?
NO.

773
00:39:26,534 --> 00:39:28,434
- YES.
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

774
00:39:28,434 --> 00:39:30,334
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S INSIDE THERE.

775
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:33,901
I'M GONNA HAVE MY HANDS FULL
WITHOUT WATCHING OVER YOU.

776
00:39:33,901 --> 00:39:35,067
- [closes car door]

777
00:39:35,067 --> 00:39:36,834
FINE.

778
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,801
- WELL, YOU CAN...
BE THE LOOKOUT.

779
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,901
- IT'S SO GREAT WORKING
WITH YOU.

780
00:39:45,901 --> 00:39:49,167
- IF YOU SEE ANYTHING,
CALL ME.

781
00:39:56,601 --> 00:40:00,300
* *

782
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,033
- WE ARE STARTING
TO LOOK A LITTLE OBVIOUS.

783
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,734
I AM GONNA GO GET US
A CLUB SODA.

784
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,667
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

785
00:40:23,467 --> 00:40:24,734
- [speaking Spanish]

786
00:40:30,133 --> 00:40:31,133
- HE'S CALLING ME OVER.

787
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:33,200
- NO, KEEP MOVING.
IGNORE HIM.

788
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,767
- THIS IS LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA.

789
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,934
OFFICER MANZON, GO TO HIM,
MAKE NICE,

790
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,868
AND TRY TO GET HIM
TO STEP OUTSIDE THE CLUB.

791
00:40:38,868 --> 00:40:40,367
- LIEUTENANT, NO.
THIS IS A PROBLEM.

792
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:41,567
THESE GUYS ARE DANGEROUS.

793
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:42,968
- STAND DOWN, MORGAN.

794
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:44,734
- SHE'S IN CHARGE.

795
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,534
NOTHING WE CAN DO.

796
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:48,400

- OH, YOU AGAIN.

813
00:41:30,467 --> 00:41:32,100
YOU SHOULD WALK AWAY
BEFORE THIS ONE

814
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,367
GETS MORE THAN
JUST A LITTLE CUT.

815
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,801
- DROP THE GUN RIGHT NOW.

816
00:41:34,801 --> 00:41:36,200

YEAH.

820
00:41:53,234 --> 00:41:57,400

NO FUCKING WAY!

WHO ARE YOU, MOTHERFUCKER?
[grunts]

827
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,934
- [grunting]

828
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:57,167

BEFORE HE SEES OUR FACES.

829
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,200
- HOLY SHIT!

830
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,067
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT JUST HAPPENED!

831
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:02,334
- WHAT MADE YOU COME INSIDE?

832
00:43:02,334 --> 00:43:04,167
- I THOUGHT I SAW A SHADOW.

833
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:05,934
- AND THAT MADE YOU COME
CRASHING THROUGH A WINDOW?

834
00:43:05,934 --> 00:43:08,434
- I KNOW. I KNOW.
I JUST HAD A FEELING.

835
00:43:08,434 --> 00:43:10,200
IT WAS SOME SORT
OF LIZARD-BRAIN THING.

836
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,267
- SHE'S STARTING
TO SOUND LIKE ME.

837
00:43:14,267 --> 00:43:16,934
THAT'S COLE.
- AND BOYD.

838
00:43:16,934 --> 00:43:18,067
- AND DAN THE DENTIST.

839
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:20,801
- IT'S THEM FROM, LIKE,
15 YEARS AGO.

840
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:22,367
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE ANY
OF THE OTHERS?

841
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:25,968
- NO, JUST THOSE THREE.

842
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:28,501
- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

843
00:43:28,501 --> 00:43:30,534
- I DON'T KNOW.

844
00:43:30,534 --> 00:43:33,133
THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
SINCE THEY WERE KIDS.

845
00:43:33,133 --> 00:43:35,234
OH, MY GOD, DEXTER.
THIS IS HUGE.

846
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:38,267
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHO THEY ARE.

847
00:43:45,601 --> 00:43:49,734
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

848
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:55,334
WHAT?

849
00:43:55,334 --> 00:43:59,234
- YOU SAID "WE."

850
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,634
- PUT ON YOUR SEAT BELT.

851
00:44:10,434 --> 00:44:12,367
[sighs]

852
00:44:16,367 --> 00:44:18,100
- THIS IS A FUCKING DISASTER.

853
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,834
- CARLOS FUENTES
WAS SHOT AND KILLED.

854
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:22,801
OUR INFORMANT, YASMIN ARAGON,
WAS SHOT AND KILLED,

855
00:44:22,801 --> 00:44:24,567
AS WELL
AS ANOTHER INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

856
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:26,033
- SON OF A BITCH.

857
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:27,734
- AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S BY OUR GUNFIRE

858
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:29,167
OR THAT OF THE TWO BROTHERS.

859
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,634
ADDITIONALLY, THREE OTHER
BYSTANDERS WERE WOUNDED.

860
00:44:32,634 --> 00:44:36,501
- I WANT A FULL REPORT
BY 8:00 A.M.

861
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:44,234
- I KNOW IT LOOKS BAD.
AND IT IS BAD...

862
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:45,968
BUT WE ARE GOING
TO GET THROUGH THIS.

863
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:49,300
I PROMISE YOU.

864
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,934
IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE...

865
00:44:51,934 --> 00:44:54,234
ALL COPS MAKE OCCASIONAL
MISTAKES IN JUDGMENT.

866
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:56,801
- EXCUSE ME?

867
00:44:56,801 --> 00:45:00,434
IF MISTAKES WERE MADE, THEY
MOST CERTAINLY WERE NOT MINE.

868
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:23,968
- HEY.

869
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:28,767
- HE WAS SO RELAXED
AND HAPPY,

870
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,133
I COULDN'T BEAR TO MOVE.

871
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:34,667
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT,
HE FEELS QUITE GOOD.

872
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:37,300
- HE'S ALWAYS SO HAPPY
IN HER ARMS.

873
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:50,901
PARTNERS COME TO US
IN VARIOUS WAYS,

874
00:45:50,901 --> 00:45:53,634
BOUND TOGETHER
FOR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS.

875
00:45:53,634 --> 00:45:55,467
BUT FOR ANY PARTNERSHIP
TO WORK,

876
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:58,334
YOU MUST NOT ONLY ACCEPT
THIS PERSON INTO YOUR LIFE,

877
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:01,467
BUT ACCEPT HER
FOR WHO SHE IS.

878
00:46:22,968 --> 00:46:26,200
SAINT BRIGID...

879
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,467
CIRCLE US WITH YOUR LIGHT...

880
00:46:29,467 --> 00:46:32,634
SO THAT NO DARKNESS
SHALL OVERCOME OUR WORLD.

881
00:46:36,901 --> 00:46:39,100
HEY.

882
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,167
- HI.

883
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,167
HI.

884
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:46,133
- HI.

885
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:47,834
HARRISON, THIS IS LUMEN.

886
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:48,834
- HI.

887
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:51,901
OH, MY GOODNESS.
HELLO.

888
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:54,834
[gasps and chuckles]

889
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:03,534
- SOMETIMES PARTNERS FIND US,
AND AS MUCH AS WE TRY

890
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:05,133
TO PUSH THEM AWAY,
THEY WORK THEIR WAY

891
00:47:05,133 --> 00:47:07,367
INTO OUR LIVES REGARDLESS,

892
00:47:07,367 --> 00:47:09,734
UNTIL WE FINALLY REALIZE
HOW MUCH WE NEED THEM.
