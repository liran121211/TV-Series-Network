00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,734
POSSIBLY RECENT IMMIGRANTS
FROM VENEZUELA.

00:00:15,734 --> 00:00:16,901

00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,400
ON THE PRINT WE HAD
FROM THE CIGAR BUTT--

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,100
CARLOS FUENTES.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,901
HE'S GOT A BROTHER, MARCO,
AND I GOT THE ADDRESS.

00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:24,200
- [speaking Spanish]

10
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,701

- MEDIC!
I NEED A FUCKING MEDIC!

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,133
DON'T YOU DARE LET HIM DIE.

- [grunts]

15
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,000
- I APOLOGIZED.
HE ACCEPTED.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,367
- IT'S ASSAULT AND BATTERY.

17
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,601
BATISTA COULD
NOT ONLY LOSE HIS JOB,

18
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:38,834
HE COULD SERVE TIME.

19
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:41,400
ACCORDING TO
SERGEANT LOPEZ'S DEPOSITION,

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,868
YOU GIVE THE BEST BLOW JOB
IN MIAMI.

21
00:00:45,868 --> 00:00:47,434
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN?

22
00:00:47,434 --> 00:00:48,901
JONAH,
IS THIS KYLE BUTLER?

23
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,367

00:00:50,367 --> 00:00:52,567
- YOU'RE ON UNPAID SUSPENSION
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

25
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,133
- SUSPENSION?

26
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:56,934
- JUST TELL EVERYONE YOU'RE
TAKING A FEW VACATION DAYS.

27
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:58,434
- I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE TONIGHT.

28
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:00,467
- I'M NO GOOD FOR YOU.

29
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,467
- I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR GOOD RIGHT NOW.

30
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:04,534
- I JUST WANT TO FIND OUT
WHO THAT GIRL IS

31
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:07,667
BEFORE THE M99 WEARS OFF.

32

LUMEN ANN PIERCE.

33
00:01:09,133 --> 00:01:10,601
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE ME
TO THE HOSPITAL?

34
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,567
- BECAUSE YOU SAW ME.

35
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:14,667
- [grunts]

36
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,133
- I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.
- WE BOTH KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

37
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:20,934
EVERY ONE OF THESE BARRELS
HAS A BODY IN IT.

38
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,534
LOOK AT THIS.
- NO.

39
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:24,734
- THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE GIRLS BEFORE YOU.

40
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:26,634
THIS IS WHAT
WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.

41
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:29,667
I SAVED YOUR LIFE.

42
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:32,968
- I WAS LOCKED UP, AND I THOUGHT
IT WOULD NEVER STOP.

43
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,067
- BUT IT HAS STOPPED.

44
00:01:34,067 --> 00:01:36,067
HE'S DEAD.
IT'S OVER.

45
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:39,901
- BOYD WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

46
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,033
THERE WERE OTHERS.

47
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,100

49
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,434
- WE ALL HAVE
SOMETHING TO HIDE,

50
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:42,100
SOME DARK PLACE INSIDE US

51
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,767
WE DON'T WANT THE WORLD
TO SEE.

52
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:50,167
SO WE PRETEND
EVERYTHING'S OKAY,

53
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:53,767
WRAPPING OURSELVES
IN RAINBOWS.

54
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,601
AND MAYBE THAT'S ALL
FOR THE BEST,

55
00:03:56,601 --> 00:04:00,334
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE PLACES
ARE DARKER THAN OTHERS.

56
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:01,434
- CAREFULLY.

57
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:03,200
all:
WHOO!

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,701
- I WANT TO BELIEVE
THAT SMILE...

59
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,133
THAT WATCHING YOUR MOTHER DIE
HASN'T CHANGED YOU

60
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:11,033
THE WAY WATCHING MINE
CHANGED ME.

61
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:14,000
- GENTLY FALLING.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,868
[babies crying]

63
00:04:16,868 --> 00:04:18,501
- SWEETHEART!

64
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:20,367
SWEETHEART, WHAT IS IT?

65
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,100
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

66
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,234
- HE'S GOT A SCRATCH.

67
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,400
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WAS PLAYING
A LITTLE ROUGH.

68
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,133
- THAT'S
A LITTLE TOO FAMILIAR.

69
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,801
- LET'S GET A BAND-AID ON HIM.
- OKAY.

70
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:32,534
- THAT'S IT FOR TODAY!

71
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:33,801
[baby cries]

72
00:04:33,801 --> 00:04:35,067
- BUT I USE A SCALPEL.

73
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,601
ALL YOU HAVE
ARE YOUR FINGERS...

74
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:39,100
WIPED CLEAN.

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,200
NOT EVEN A YEAR OLD, YOU'RE
ALREADY DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

76
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,901
[baby cries]

77
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,634
AND HAVING TO FLEE
THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

78
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,567
- AW, IT'S OKAY.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,133
- EVERY TIME YOU SEE ME,
YOU LOOK DISAPPOINTED,

80
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,367
LIKE YOU WERE HOPING
TO FIND AN EMPTY TABLE.

81
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:19,567
- GUILTY.

82
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:22,934
I STILL THINK YOU NEED
TO CONSIDER MY ADVICE.

83
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,868
- LEAVE TOWN?

84
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:29,701
- GO HOME TO PEOPLE
WHO CARE ABOUT YOU.

85
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:31,534
- I TOLD YOU
WHY I CAN'T DO THAT.

86
00:05:31,534 --> 00:05:36,167
- IF YOU STAY IN MIAMI,
YOU'LL NEVER GET PAST THIS.

87
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,934
- IF YOU HAD SOMETHING
HORRIBLE HAPPEN TO YOU,

88
00:05:38,934 --> 00:05:42,267
COULD YOU JUST FORGET
ABOUT IT AND MOVE ON?

89
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:45,334
- [sighs]

90
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:47,701
I WOULD WANT TO.

91
00:05:47,701 --> 00:05:50,934
- WHAT IF YOU COULDN'T?

92
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:59,334
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP ME
GET PAST THIS,

93
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:01,601
HELP ME FIND THOSE GUYS
AND KILL THEM.

94
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:06,334
I SAW YOU KILL BOYD.

95
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,300
YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

96
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,834
- USUAL?

97
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,701
- THANKS.

98
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,634
- GOING AFTER THOSE MEN
WON'T HELP YOU GET PAST THIS.

99
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:22,234
IT'LL ONLY MAKE IT WORSE.

100
00:06:22,234 --> 00:06:23,501
- HOW COULD IT GET WORSE?

101
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,167
- IT'LL OPEN UP SOMETHING
INSIDE YOU

102
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:27,734
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW IS THERE.

103
00:06:27,734 --> 00:06:29,033
TRUST ME.

104
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:31,734
- TRUST YOU?

105
00:06:31,734 --> 00:06:33,868
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
YOUR LAST NAME.

106
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,868
- THE LESS YOU KNOW ABOUT ME,
THE BETTER.

107
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:37,033
- BETTER FOR WHO?

108
00:06:37,033 --> 00:06:40,067
- FOR THE BOTH OF US.

109
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,400
- IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP ME,

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,234
WHY DO YOU KEEP
COMING BACK HERE?

111
00:06:44,234 --> 00:06:46,868
- I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU.

112
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:01,868
- MINNEAPOLIS.

113
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,000
- YEAH, I USED SOME MILES.

114
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,801
- WOW.

115
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:10,200
YOU REALLY WANT TO GET RID
OF ME, DON'T YOU?

116
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,400
- [sighs]

117
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,634
I WANT YOU TO GET ON
WITH YOUR LIFE.

118
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,300
LUMEN.

119
00:07:26,701 --> 00:07:28,567
SHE TOOK THE TICKET.

120
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,467
MAYBE THIS IS ONE PROBLEM
I CAN CHECK OFF THE LIST.

121
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:37,534
AND MAYBE IT'LL SNOW
THIS WEEK.

122
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,567
- WHOA.
WHERE'S THE FIRE?

123
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,100
- GOT TO GET MY ASS IN GEAR,

124
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,033
OR I'M GONNA BE LATE.

125
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:53,701
- I COULD TAKE THAT ASS
BACK TO BED.

126
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:59,234
- WHAT PART OF "LATE"
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

127
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:00,934
- I MEAN,
AT LEAST LET ME

128
00:08:00,934 --> 00:08:02,267
MAKE YOU BREAKFAST
OR SOMETHING.

129
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,434
- I HAVE NO TIME.

130
00:08:03,434 --> 00:08:04,801
I'VE GOT TO MEET BATISTA
AT THE HOSPITAL.

131
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:06,534
WE'RE INTERVIEWING THAT KID
FUENTES SLICED OPEN.

132
00:08:06,534 --> 00:08:07,567
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

133
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:10,300
- "GOOD LUCK WITH THAT"?

134
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,701
FUENTES HAS KILLED
THREE PEOPLE.

135
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:13,501
I'M RUNNING DOWN LEADS,
AND YOU'RE SITTING AROUND

136
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:15,000
IN YOUR BOXER SHORTS
WATCHING TV ALL DAY.

137
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,467
- OH, IS THAT WHY YOU'RE,

138
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:17,968
"LET ME GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE,"

'CAUSE I'M TAKING
A FEW DAYS OFF?

140
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,300
- JUST DROP IT.

141
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,167
- YOU KNOW,
THIS WASN'T EVEN MY CALL.

142
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,834
LAGUERTA SAID
I HAD TOO MANY DAYS.

143
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:25,334
I HAD TO USE 'EM OR LOSE 'EM.
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.

144
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:28,601
- NO ARGUMENT HERE.

145
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:31,701
- I GOT TO GO.

00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:36,901
QUINN'S MY PARTNER.

148
00:08:36,901 --> 00:08:38,434
HE SHOULD BE HERE,
NOT YOU.

149
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,567
NO OFFENSE.

150
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:40,868
- LOOK, WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?

151
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:42,234
HE PUT IN FOR HIS TIME.

152
00:08:42,234 --> 00:08:43,901
- NO, HE TOLD ME HE WAS FORCED
TO TAKE HIS LEAVE.

153
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:45,067
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

154
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,801
- EXACTLY. SO WILL YOU TALK
TO LAGUERTA--

155
00:08:46,801 --> 00:08:47,968
OH, SHIT.

WE WERE WONDERING
IF THERE'S ANYTHING

178
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:41,334
YOU CAN TELL US
ABOUT THE MAN WHO INJURED YOU.

179
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:44,934
- [speaking Spanish]

180
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:47,234
- UH...

181
00:09:47,234 --> 00:09:51,100
- [speaking Spanish]

182
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,701
- [speaking Spanish]

183
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:57,534
- HE'S SEEN HIM AROUND,
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO HE WAS.

184
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,534
[speaking Spanish]

185
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:02,601
- NO. <i>NADA.</i>

186
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,901
- I ASKED IF HE HAD
HEARD ANYTHING

187
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:05,234
ABOUT FUENTES
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

188
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,634
- DOES HE REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT DAY,

189
00:10:06,634 --> 00:10:09,033
ANYTHING FUENTES SAID OR DID,
ANYTHING AT ALL?

190
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:13,934
- [speaking Spanish]

191
00:10:13,934 --> 00:10:19,434
- [speaking Spanish]

192
00:10:19,434 --> 00:10:20,767
- HE DOESN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING ELSE.

193
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:21,868
HE WAS REALLY SCARED.

194
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:25,501
FUENTES SAID
HE WAS GOING TO KILL HIM.

195
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,000
- OKAY.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,901
 <i>GRACIAS.</i>

197
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:31,901
- UH...

198
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:34,634
[speaking Spanish]

199
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,501
[continues in Spanish]

200
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:38,267
- HE HAD A MARK ON HIS HAND.
[speaking Spanish]

201
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:39,434
- [speaking Spanish]

202
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,501
- A SMALL ONE.
- LIKE A TATTOO?

203
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:43,567
- [speaking Spanish]

204
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,067
- CAN YOU DRAW IT FOR US?

205
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,534
- [speaking Spanish]

206
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,901
- LUMEN NEEDS TO STAY AWAY
FROM THE DARKNESS.

207
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:01,901
I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
ALWAYS NEED NAMES FOR MY TABLE,

208
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:04,300
AND THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE
MORE DESERVING

209
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,167
THAN BOYD FOWLER'S
ACCOMPLICES.

210
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:08,601
NOTHING IN BOYD'S ARREST RECORD
EVEN HINTS HE HAD HELP--

211
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,133
ZERO TO GO ON.

212
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:12,400
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK ELSEWHERE.

213
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,634
- YOURS.

214
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,734
- THANKS.
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

215
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,467
- NO, IT REALLY IS YOURS.

216
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:23,701
YOU LEFT IT
ON THE HOOD OF YOUR CAR.

217
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:25,300
- OH.

218
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,000
MY HEAD'S IN 50 PLACES.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,334
MASUKA DIDN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO KEEP UP THE CASE LOAD.

220
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:31,200
- WELL, GOOD LUCK GETTING
THE MIDGET PORN

221
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
OFF YOUR HARD DRIVE.

222
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,334
HE MIGHT HAVE SHOWN IT TO ME.

223
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,667
HOW WAS MOMMY AND ME?
HARRISON BREAK ANY HEARTS?

224
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,067
- [sighs]

225
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,501
NO, BUT HE DREW
HIS FIRST BLOOD.

226
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,667
I THINK HIS LITTLE BLACK BOOK
STILL HAS A FEW BLANK PAGES.

227
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,200
- WELL, NOT FOR LONG.

228
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,701
- HE MISSED YOU THIS MORNING.

229
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:48,701
HE'S USED TO HAVING HIS AUNT DEB
FEED HIM HIS MANGO OATMEAL.

230
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:51,133
- YEAH, SORRY.

231
00:11:51,133 --> 00:11:54,567
- YOU DIDN'T COME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

232
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:57,434
- NO, IT WAS LATE,
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU,

233
00:11:57,434 --> 00:11:59,167
SO I JUST CRASHED
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

234
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,734
- OH, WHAT FRIEND?

235
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,434
- WHAT, ARE YOU MOM NOW?

236
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:04,734
YOU WANT TO DO LUNCH?

237
00:12:04,734 --> 00:12:07,067
- I THINK I'M GONNA BE DINING
ON BACKLOG.

238
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,734
AND PAYING A VISIT
TO BOYD'S HOUSE.

239
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:10,534
- HMM.

240
00:12:10,534 --> 00:12:12,667
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL BRING
YOU SOMETHING BACK.

241
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,601
BYE.

242
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:24,234
- WAIT A SECOND.

243
00:12:24,234 --> 00:12:27,467
- WHAT?

244
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,767
- GIVE ME YOUR OPINION
AS A FEMALE.

245
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:32,901
- AS A FEMALE?
- AS A WOMAN, YOU KNOW?

246
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:35,968
MCCOURT.

247
00:12:35,968 --> 00:12:37,434
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

248
00:12:37,434 --> 00:12:38,901
- DO YOU FIND HIM ATTRACTIVE?

249
00:12:38,901 --> 00:12:42,601
- DO YOU?

250
00:12:42,601 --> 00:12:43,868
- I MEAN, WOULD YOU EVER?

251
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:48,667
- I WOULD RATHER PUT
A CAMPFIRE OUT WITH MY FACE.

252
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,100
OKAY?

253
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,667
I CHECKED IN WITH CIRA.

254
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,801
SHE'S GONNA STAY
ON THE ATM VIDEO SURVEILLANCE

255
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,400
WHILE I TRACK DOWN
THE TATTOO.

256
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,367
- LET ME SEE THAT AGAIN.

257
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,167
SEE, IT STILL LOOKS
LIKE A UFO TO ME.

258
00:13:00,167 --> 00:13:01,968
- WHO THE FUCK KNOWS, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

259
00:13:01,968 --> 00:13:02,968
- WE NEED TO TALK TO AN EXPERT.

260
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:05,968
- AN EXPERT, HUH?
- MM-HMM.

261
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,167
- THE DRAGON LADY REPRESENTS
THE DUALITIES

262
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:17,434
OF MY INNER WARRIOR.

263
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,234
- OR YOUR INNER IDIOT.

264
00:13:19,234 --> 00:13:22,067
- HEY, IF YOU CAN'T MUSTER UP
THE APPROPRIATE RESPECT,

265
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,133
I'M DROPPING THE CURTAIN.

266
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:25,334
- WHEN DID YOU GET THIS?

267
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,734
- [sighs] I'VE BEEN ADDING
TO IT OVER TIME,

268
00:13:27,734 --> 00:13:31,734
BUT, UH, THE MAIN WORK STARTED
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

269
00:13:31,734 --> 00:13:33,367
I WAS HAVING A BIT
OF A CRISIS,

270
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,634
AND THIS WAS MY WAY
OF WORKING THROUGH IT.

271
00:13:35,634 --> 00:13:37,167
- VIAGRA PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER.

272
00:13:37,167 --> 00:13:38,701
- THIS WAS A CRISIS
OF THE SOUL, MORGAN.

273
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,834
- DON'T YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SOUL
BEFORE IT COULD BE IN CRISIS?

274
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:43,100
- POINT IS, YOU KNOW
A LITTLE ABOUT THIS WORLD.

275
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,267
- I KNOW A LITTLE.

276
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:45,667
THE PERSON YOU WANT
TO TALK TO

277
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,133
IS MY BODY ARTIST
MICHAEL ANGELO.

278
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,667
- YOU'RE KIDDING.
MICHELANGELO?

279
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,200
- TWO WORDS.
MICHAEL ANGELO.

280
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,367
AND, YES, I'M SERIOUS.

281
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,868
IF YOUR TATTOO WERE DONE
BY ANYONE LOCAL,

282
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,701
MICHAEL ANGELO WILL KNOW.

283
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,534
- YOU CAN LOWER THE CURTAIN.

284
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,467
- FROM THE OUTSIDE,
A NORMAL HOME

285
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:09,367
IS INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM THE HOME

286
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:12,334
OF A MONSTER WHO PUTS WOMEN
IN BARRELS.

287
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,901
BUT STEP INSIDE...

288
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:24,400
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
AROUND HERE

289
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,000
THAT WILL POINT ME
TO BOYD'S ACCOMPLICES.

290
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,400
[sighs]

291
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,200
SOMEBODY'S BEEN HERE.

292
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
OH, GREAT.

293
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,868
BLOOD.

294
00:14:49,701 --> 00:14:52,467
THEY WERE GOING THROUGH
BOYD'S FILES.

295
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:06,033
WHOEVER BOYD WAS WORKING WITH
MUST HAVE PANICKED,

296
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:10,367
TRIED TO COVER UP ANY TRACE
OF THEIR EXISTENCE.

297
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,200
AMATEURS.

298
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,801
[sighs]

299
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:19,801
[door opens]

300
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:21,234
[baby coos]

301
00:15:21,234 --> 00:15:23,467
- HERE HE IS, FRESHLY BATHED,

302
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:26,367
CLEAN AS A WHISTLE,
AND READY FOR BED.

303
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,601
- THANKS.
- I'M GONNA GET GOING.

304
00:15:28,601 --> 00:15:31,901
- CHECK'S ON THE COUNTER.

305
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,734
SONYA, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

306
00:15:33,734 --> 00:15:36,067
- SURE.

307
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:39,067
- HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
HARRISON BEING...

308
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,100
AGGRESSIVE?

309
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,834
- AGGRESSIVE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

310
00:15:41,834 --> 00:15:44,200
- UH, SCRATCHING,
STUFF LIKE THAT.

311
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,467
- NO.

312
00:15:46,467 --> 00:15:47,667
HE'S A VERY GENTLE CHILD,
REALLY.

313
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,300
WHY?

314
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,634
- THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN INCIDENT

315
00:15:50,634 --> 00:15:52,167
AT ONE OF
THE MOMMY AND ME CLASSES.

316
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:54,067
CAN'T BE SURE
IT WAS HARRISON OR NOT.

317
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:55,267
- HE'S A LITTLE BOY.

318
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:56,767
MY LITTLE BROTHER
USED TO BITE PEOPLE--

319
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,901
BLOODY LITTLE CANNIBAL.

320
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:01,067
NOW HE'S A VEGETARIAN,
WORKS FOR GREENPEACE.

321
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:02,267
- WELL, THAT'S COMFORTING.

322
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:03,934
- [chuckles]

323
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:05,467
NOT TO WORRY.

324
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:07,534
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE ANGEL
ON YOUR HANDS.

325
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:08,767
NOTHING CAN CHANGE THAT.

326
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,634
SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING.

327
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:11,701
- NIGHT.

328
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:17,801
[sighs]

329
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:21,767
NO MATCH FOR DADDY
IN THE CRIMINAL DATABASE.

330
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,767
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
MAYBE HE DRIVES.

331
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,501
LET'S CHECK THE DMV.

332
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:30,868
[baby coos]

333
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:34,968
MINNESOTA.

334
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:38,367
LUMEN ANN PIERCE.

335
00:16:38,367 --> 00:16:42,667
SHE BROKE INTO BOYD'S HOUSE.

336
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,234
SHE BEAT ME TO IT.

337
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,968
OH, MY GOD.

338
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,400
- DEXTER...

339
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,334
THIS SEEM LIKE THE PRODUCT
OF A STABLE MIND?

340
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:56,000
- A CLOSET WAS THE ONLY PLACE
SHE FELT SAFE FROM THEM.

341
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,834
SHE'S REMADE IT HERE.

342
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:00,234
- DEXTER,
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

343
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:03,334
- YES, I'M LISTENING.

344
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:04,801
- SHE'S NOT A KILLER.
SHE'S NOT YOU.

345
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,667
SHE'S COMING UNDONE.

346
00:18:11,334 --> 00:18:12,834
WHAT'S THAT NOW?

347
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:16,400
- THIS IS THE LETTER SHE TOOK
FROM BOYD FOWLER'S HOUSE...

348
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,868
FROM HIS EX-CELLMATE,
ROBERT BRUNNER.

349
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:21,801
"I'M GETTING PAROLED
NEXT WEEK.

350
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:23,501
NEED A PLACE TO 'SLEAP'."

351
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,734
S-L-E-A-P.

352
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:28,367
- SHE'S FOUND A TARGET.

353
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,434
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S PLANNING.

354
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:33,133
- I KNOW
THIS ISN'T GONNA END WELL.

355
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,634
SHE KEEPS GOING THIS WAY,
SHE'S GONNA GET HERSELF KILLED

356
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:38,501
OR THROWN IN JAIL, AND YOU'RE
GONNA BE RIGHT THERE WITH HER.

357
00:18:38,501 --> 00:18:41,200
DEX, SHE'S GONNA
BRING YOU DOWN.

358
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,868
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

359
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:04,701
- HAVING BREAKFAST?

360
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:06,467
- YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE MEN WHO HURT YOU.

361
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:08,667
- SO...

362
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,367
WHAT, YOU'RE SPYING
ON ME NOW?

363
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:11,534
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

364
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:14,534
IF YOU ACTUALLY FIND
ONE OF THESE GUYS?

365
00:19:14,534 --> 00:19:15,834
- MAYBE...

366
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:17,634
WHAT YOU WON'T.

367
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:19,300
- ARE YOU GONNA KILL THEM?
IS THAT IT?

368
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,601
- I'M SORRY.

369
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:25,667
YOU DON'T GET
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

370
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:28,267
I ASKED FOR YOUR HELP.
YOU TURNED ME DOWN.

371
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,267
- FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

372
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:35,100
- LOOK...

373
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,968
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

374
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,467
BUT WHAT I NEED FROM YOU RIGHT
NOW IS TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

375
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:41,467
- LUMEN--

376
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:44,033
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

377
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:50,534
- [sighs]

378
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,534
THESE MEN PUT FIVE WOMEN
IN BARRELS.

379
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,300
THEY'RE NOT GONNA WANT
TO BE FOUND.

380
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,400
PLEASE...

381
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,033
STOP THIS
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

382
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:22,100
[sighs]

383
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,868
SHE'S NOT GOING TO STOP
UNTIL SHE FINDS BRUNNER.

384
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,567
- MY FAVORITE COLOR.

385
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:38,334
- HELP YOU, SERGEANT?

386
00:20:38,334 --> 00:20:41,000
- MORGAN HAS BEEN ALL OVER ME
THE LAST TWO DAYS ABOUT QUINN.

387
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,234
- WHAT ABOUT QUINN?

388
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:45,100
- THE VACATION
HE'S BEING FORCED TO TAKE.

389
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,133
SHE'S FEELING SHORTHANDED
WITHOUT HER PARTNER,

390
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,901
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
WE NEED HIM.

391
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:51,434
- WELL, IT'S THE UNION,

392
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:53,567
NOT MY CALL.

393
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:57,067
THAT ALL?

394
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,434
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I NEED TO KNOW

395
00:20:58,434 --> 00:20:59,667
ABOUT MY CASE WITH I.A.?

396
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:03,167
- MM-MM.

[clears throat]

398
00:21:04,501 --> 00:21:05,901
- IS THERE ANYTHING
I NEED TO KNOW

399
00:21:05,901 --> 00:21:08,834
ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE?

400
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:14,801
- I'M SORRY, ANGEL,
BUT I GOT TO GO.

401
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:16,501
- SURE.

402
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:17,901
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT?

403
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,033
- YEAH--
UM, I MIGHT BE LATE.

404
00:21:20,033 --> 00:21:22,367
OKAY, SO I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

405
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:24,200
OKAY?

406
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:35,868
[elevator bell rings]

407
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,667
- [sighs]

408
00:22:07,234 --> 00:22:09,133
HOPE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DIG TOO DEEP.

409
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,467
- ONLY EIGHT BOXES,
BUT I ALWAYS REMEMBER

410
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:13,000
TO LIFT WITH MY BACK.

411
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,534
WELL, HERE'S THE GUY
YOU ASKED FOR--

412
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:15,601
ROBERT BRUNNER.

413
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,000
NUH-UH-UH.

414
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,033
LIKE WE AGREED.
- RIGHT.

415
00:22:18,033 --> 00:22:19,033
- HMM.

416
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,634
- THERE YOU GO.

417
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:21,667
- AH, AW.

418
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:25,968
THAT FACE.

419
00:22:25,968 --> 00:22:28,334
- ABDUCTION, TORTURE, RAPE.

420
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:29,934
- MM, HE'S SO BIG.

421
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,033
IS HE A YEAR YET?

422
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,334
- TEN MONTHS.
- HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

423
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:35,067
- THANK YOU.
- MM-HMM.

424
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,667
- SEVEN YEARS
FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT,

425
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:38,100
OUT IN THREE
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

426
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,467
- MM.
GOOD BEHAVIOR.

427
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,200
YOU EVER SEEN SCARS LIKE THAT?

428
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,968
- YES. ON LUMEN.

429
00:22:42,968 --> 00:22:44,467
- AND HE'S OUT NOW.

430
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:46,234
THANK YOU, STATE OF FLORIDA.

431
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,601
- LOOKS LIKE SHE STUMBLED
ONTO THE RIGHT GUY.

432
00:22:48,601 --> 00:22:50,601
IT SAYS HE'S LIVING
UNDER TUTTLE BRIDGE.

433
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:52,100
IS THIS CURRENT?
- MM-HMM.

434
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,067
SEX OFFENDERS CAN'T LIVE
ANYWHERE NEAR KIDS.

435
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:55,667
TUTTLE'S THE ONLY PLACE
THEY CAN GO.

436
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,801
- CAN I KEEP THIS?

437
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,067
- WELL, THAT DEPENDS, NOW.

438
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:00,167
YOU GONNA BRING
THIS LITTLE CUTIE BY TO SEE ME?

439
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:03,200
- WILL DO.
- OKAY.

440
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,767
- TUTTLE BRIDGE
IS THE PERFECT PLACE

441
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,734
FOR BRUNNER TO HIDE
IN THE DARK,

442
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:07,834
BUT NOT FROM ME.

443
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:10,100
I'VE GOT TO GET TO HIM
BEFORE SHE DOES.

444
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,234
[tattoo needles buzzing]

445
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:16,067
- YO, WHAT'S UP?

446
00:23:19,501 --> 00:23:20,934
TRAMP STAMP--

447
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:22,334
I THINK I'M IN LOVE.

448
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:23,467
- SHE'S INTO NEEDLES.

449
00:23:23,467 --> 00:23:26,767
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HER
YOUR DICK?

450
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,601
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

451
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,334
- YOU ARE
SO JUDGMENTAL, MORGAN.

452
00:23:30,334 --> 00:23:31,501
I MEAN, COME ON.

453
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:33,501
WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN WAYS
OF EXPRESSING OURSELVES.

454
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:37,334
I HAVE MY INK,
AND YOU HAVE YOUR...

455
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:38,667
MAN-BOOTS.

456
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,734
- YEAH? WELL, EXPECT
MY MAN-BOOTS UP YOUR ASS

457
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:43,534
IF YOU'RE WASTING
MY TIME, OKAY?

458
00:23:43,534 --> 00:23:44,934
- VINCENT?

459
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:48,968
NOW, WHAT CAN I DO YOU FOR?

460
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:51,300
- THAT'S MICHAEL ANGELO?
- THE ONE AND ONLY.

461
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,200
M, HOW ARE YOU?

462
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,968
- COME HERE.

463
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,834
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

464
00:23:56,834 --> 00:23:58,601
- M, THIS IS THE DETECTIVE
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT--

465
00:23:58,601 --> 00:24:01,000
DETECTIVE MORGAN.

466
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,067
- <i>ENCHANTE.</i>

467
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,801
- RIGHT.

468
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:06,868
YOU MIND TAKING A LOOK
AT SOMETHING FOR US?

469
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,868
- ANY FRIEND OF SUGAR'S
IS A FRIEND OF MINE.

470
00:24:08,868 --> 00:24:09,868
- "SUGAR"?

471
00:24:09,868 --> 00:24:10,868
- [giggles]

472
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:14,334
- OKAY.

473
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:16,000
WE INTERVIEWED THIS KID
WHO SAW THIS ON THE HAND

474
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
OF A SUSPECT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

475
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,467
ANY IDEA WHAT IT MEANS?

476
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,734
- CRUDE, SIMPLISTIC, BUT...

477
00:24:22,734 --> 00:24:24,334
IT'S DEFINITELY AN EYE.

478
00:24:24,334 --> 00:24:27,400
LOOK...

479
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,567
THE SIMILARITY.

480
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:30,667
SEE?

481
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:32,901
- AND THAT WOULD MEAN?

482
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:35,501
- EYES SYMBOLIZE
THE THIRD EYE IN OUR MINDS,

483
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:37,234
LIKE THE GOD HORUS

484
00:24:37,234 --> 00:24:39,901
AND ALSO...

485
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,300
JUST LIKE...

486
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,400
THE BACK OF A DOLLAR BILL.

487
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:49,567
- HMM.

488
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,234
HAVE YOU EVER DONE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

489
00:24:51,234 --> 00:24:53,000
- WELL, IF I HAD,
I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED IT.

490
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
- ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN TELL US?

491
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,434
WE'RE KIND
OF DESPERATE HERE.

492
00:24:56,434 --> 00:25:00,200
- WITHOUT IT IN FRONT OF ME,
THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO.

493
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,367
I'M SORRY.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

494
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:05,133
- [sighs]
M, THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANYWAYS.

495
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:07,067
- ALWAYS FOR YOU.

496
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:10,334
AND YOU...

497
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,767
YOU COME SEE ME
ANYTIME, OKAY?

498
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,667
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

499
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,000
- OKAY.
- OKAY, BYE.

00:25:18,701 --> 00:25:19,801
- I'LL BE IN SOON.

502
00:25:19,801 --> 00:25:21,467
- BYE.

503
00:25:21,467 --> 00:25:22,801
- HEY,
I THINK SHE LIKES YOU.

504
00:25:22,801 --> 00:25:26,200
- DON'T EVER SPEAK
ABOUT THIS.

505
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,234
- SINCE WE'RE, UH,
ALREADY HERE,

506
00:25:28,234 --> 00:25:29,901
WHY DON'T YOU GET
QUINN'S NAME PUT ON YOUR--

507
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:31,501
- HEY, I HAVE A GUN.

508
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:34,501
- I'LL JUST WAIT IN THE CAR.
- OKAY.

509

- HELLO?

512
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,834
- CIRA, IT'S ME.
- ANY LUCK?

513
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,901
- JUST A STEAMING PILE
OF FUCK-ALL.

514
00:25:45,901 --> 00:25:47,334
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVE SOMETHING.

515
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:49,334
- I'VE GONE THROUGH MOST
OF THE BANK'S ATM FOOTAGE--

516
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,734
EIGHT NAMES AND COUNTING.

517
00:25:50,734 --> 00:25:52,033
THEY'RE ALL FREAKING OUT
ABOUT SOMETHING

518
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:53,601
WHILE THEY'RE WITHDRAWING
MAXIMUM AMOUNTS

519
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:54,934
FROM THEIR ACCOUNTS,
JUST LIKE OUR FIRST

SANTA MUERTE VICS.

521
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,367
- I WANT ADDRESSES
FOR ALL EIGHT NAMES

522
00:25:58,367 --> 00:25:59,934
AND ANY OTHERS YOU CAN FIND.

523
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:01,467
I'LL PICK YOU UP
ON MY WAY TO WORK TOMORROW,

524
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:04,000
AND WE'LL CHECK 'EM OUT,
OKAY?

525
00:26:11,534 --> 00:26:14,267
- POOR JULIA TUTTLE...

526
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,634

527
00:26:15,634 --> 00:26:19,400
THEY NAMED THIS BRIDGE
AFTER HER IN HER HONOR.

528
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,000
NOW IT'S CRAWLING WITH
PEDOPHILES AND SEX OFFENDERS.

529
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,234
SO MUCH FOR HONOR.

530
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,501
- JAPAN'S TOTAL AREA
IS SLIGHTLY SMALLER

531
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:51,601
THAN THE U.S. STATE
OF MONTANA.

532
00:26:51,601 --> 00:26:55,300
- YOU MIND IF I WATCH?

533
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,467
- THE KID FUCKERS STAY OVER
BY THE TRACKS.

534
00:26:57,467 --> 00:26:59,167
- THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

535
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,434
- AND WHY IS THAT?

536
00:27:00,434 --> 00:27:02,734
- STUCK-UP LITTLE CO-ED
AND I

537
00:27:02,734 --> 00:27:04,467
HAD A LEGAL DISAGREEMENT
CONCERNING

538
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:09,133
THE MEANING
OF THE WORD "CONSENT."

539
00:27:09,133 --> 00:27:13,067
- TAKE A LOAD OFF.

540
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:16,434
- APPRECIATE IT, BROTHER.

541
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,734
[sighs]

542
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:20,067
- WHERE'D YOU DO YOUR TIME?

543
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:22,434
- OKEECHOBEE.

544
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,067
- [scoffs]

545
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:26,701
MY LAST STRETCH WAS
IN THAT SHITHOLE--

546
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,434
ROUGH PLACE.

547
00:27:28,434 --> 00:27:30,934
- YEAH.

548
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:33,200
TOLD EVERYONE I WAS IN
FOR ARMED ROBBERY

549
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,000
TO KEEP A TARGET
OFF MY BACK.

550
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,601
YOU FROM MIAMI?

551
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:39,767
- USED TO BE.

552
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:42,033
GUY I BUNKED WITH
LIVES DOWN HERE NOW.

553
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,467
THOUGHT I'D LET HIM SHOW ME
THE TOWN AND HAVE SOME FUN.

554
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,200
- DID THAT FUN INCLUDE LUMEN?

555
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,701
- THAT IS UNTIL
MY PAROLE OFFICER,

556
00:27:48,701 --> 00:27:50,067
THE CUNT,
STARTED GIVING ME SHIT

557
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:53,367
ABOUT STAYING WITH SOMEONE
FROM THE JOINT.

558
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:54,501
WOUND UP HERE.

559
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,634
- MM.
BEATS A CELL.

560
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,434
- BARELY.

561
00:27:58,434 --> 00:28:03,000
ONCE MY PAROLE IS DONE,
FUCK FLORIDA.

562
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,367
I'M GOING NORTH.

563
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:08,868
GET ME SOME
OF THAT FARM-FRESH PUSSY.

564
00:28:08,868 --> 00:28:11,000
YOU EVER TAP THAT?

565
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,934
- CAN'T SAY I HAVE.

566
00:28:13,934 --> 00:28:16,501
- A COUPLE WEEKS AGO...

567
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:21,234
I HAD THIS HOT, LITTLE BLONDE
ON ALL FOURS--

568
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:22,968
A FEW OF US DID.

569
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:25,400
BELIEVE ME, THAT BITCH
GOT EVERY FUCKING INCH

570
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,701
OF MY MOTHERFUCKING--
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

571
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:35,167
- THIS ROOM WAS MEANT FOR BOYD,
NOT HIS CELLMATE.

572
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,234
- THEY WERE CO-WORKERS,
PARTNERS--

573
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,601
BASICALLY THE SAME.
- YOU'RE SURE?

574
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:43,901
- I NEED TO KILL HIM
SO LUMEN DOESN'T HAVE TO.

575
00:28:43,901 --> 00:28:45,534
I DON'T WANT HER
DOWN THAT ROAD.

576
00:28:45,534 --> 00:28:47,067
- THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

577
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:49,033
- I AM.

578
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:50,601
- HE'S A SEX OFFENDER...
- I KNOW.

579
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:53,200
- ON PAROLE.

580
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,567
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

581
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,567
- THINK!

582
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,501
ARE YOU LISTENING?

583
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,667
OKAY.

584
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:08,501
- HE'S WEARING
AN ANKLE BRACELET.

585
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:09,667
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIM.

586
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:12,801
SHE HAD THE WRONG GUY.

587
00:29:14,534 --> 00:29:16,501
I WAS READY TO KILL HIM.

588
00:29:20,434 --> 00:29:24,133
I WAS READY TO KILL HIM.

589
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:26,634
I WAS READY TO KILL HIM!

590
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:30,067
[train whistle blows]

591
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:32,701
ROBERT BRUNNER ISN'T ONE
OF THE MEN WHO HURT HER.

592
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:39,000
HARRY'S RIGHT.

593
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,767
I HAVE TO CONVINCE LUMEN
TO DO WHAT I NEVER COULD--

594
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,133
TO MOVE ON.

595
00:29:46,968 --> 00:29:49,501
- YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

596
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,567
- WHERE'S SONYA?

597
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,100
- I SENT HER HOME.

598
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,100
SHE SAID YOU WERE GONNA
BE WORKING LATE.

599
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,067
- HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
I GRABBED A BEER.

600
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:58,434
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

601
00:29:58,434 --> 00:30:02,501
- HE WANTED TO...

602
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,100
BORROW...

603
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,133
A BOOK.

604
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,801
- HE READS?

605
00:30:08,801 --> 00:30:12,267
- YEAH, HE DOES.
- HERE.

606
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:13,734
- THANKS.

607
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:15,734
LITTLE VACATION READING.

608
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:18,300
- QUINN WAS JUST LEAVING.

609
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,534
- WHAT SHE SAID.

610
00:30:22,801 --> 00:30:26,534
- I WILL CALL YOU
IN THE MORNING, JOSEPH.

611
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:29,534
- OH, OKAY, DEBRA.

612
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:37,434
KIND OF WARM FOR GLOVES.

613
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:38,767
- GOOD NIGHT.

614
00:30:38,767 --> 00:30:40,467
- THANKS FOR THE BOOK.

615
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:50,100
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

616
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,300
- IT'S LATE,
SO I'LL TAKE THE COUCH.

617
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,033
- ARE YOU AND QUINN...?

618
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:58,133
- [sighs]

619
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:02,133
WE'RE FUCK BUDDIES.
THAT'S IT.

620
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:04,000
- YOU NEED QUINN FOR THAT?

621
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,033
- I KNOW IT'S INSANE.

622
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,133
I-I-I KNOW IT'S...

623
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:10,300
WRONG FOR A FUCK-TON
OF REAS--

624
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,434
WILL YOU PLEASE STOP LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

625
00:31:12,434 --> 00:31:14,634
- IT'S YOUR LIFE, DEB.

626
00:31:14,634 --> 00:31:17,801
JUST DON'T BRING HIM AROUND
WHEN HARRISON'S HERE.

627
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:19,000
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

628
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,734
- WELL, HE'S
AT AN IMPRESSIONABLE AGE.

629
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:22,367
WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT MIGHT RUB OFF ON HIM.

630
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:25,767
- WHAT WILL RUB OFF ON HIM?

631
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,067
- JUST KEEP QUINN AWAY
FROM MY SON.

632
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:29,133
- FINE. YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT QUINN.

633
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:31,501
HE'S...

634
00:31:31,501 --> 00:31:32,834
NOT THAT BAD.

635
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:36,133
[channels changing
on television]

636
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,901
- HEY.

637
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:41,334
SORRY. LONG DAY.

638
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:43,868
- DINNER'S IN THE OVEN.

639
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:47,667
- YOU MIND IF I, UM, HOP
IN THE SHOWER FIRST?

640
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:55,334
- YOU NEVER CALLED.

641
00:31:55,334 --> 00:31:59,067
- YEAH, I KNOW.
I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.

642
00:31:59,067 --> 00:32:02,901
- WHY SO LATE?

643
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:07,434
- BUDGETS ARE DUE
AT THE END OF THE MONTH, SO...

644
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:08,734
I'M GONNA--

645
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:10,067
- I'LL SET THE TABLE.

646
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,868
- OKAY, THANKS.

647

[shower water running]

648
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,534
- SHE'S NOT THERE.

649
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,534
YOU JUST MISSED HER.

650
00:32:52,534 --> 00:32:54,133
- DID MY WIFE SAY WHERE
SHE WAS GOING?

651
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:55,701
- YOU TWO STILL NOT
SEEING EYE TO EYE?

652
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:57,400
- LOOK, I REALLY NEED
TO FIND HER.

653
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,400
IT'S IMPORTANT.

654
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,567
- SHE WAS ASKING
ABOUT TUTTLE BRIDGE.

655
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:04,834
I TOLD HER THAT IS THE LAST
PLACE SHE WANTS TO BE.

656
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,334
- WHAT THE FUCK, ASSHOLE?

657
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:29,501
NICE.

658
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:30,868
WHERE YOU GOING, BABY?

659
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:49,667
- [breathing heavily]

660
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:02,100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

661
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,367
- I'M TAKING YOU OUT OF HERE.

662
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:05,634
- GIVE ME THE GUN.
- NO.

663
00:35:05,634 --> 00:35:07,734
- GIVE IT TO ME!

664
00:35:07,734 --> 00:35:10,601
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THOSE ANIMALS DID TO ME--

665
00:35:10,601 --> 00:35:12,033
PASSING ME AROUND.

666
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:14,000
I-I COULDN'T MOVE.
I COULDN'T STOP THEM.

667
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,501
- IT WASN'T BRUNNER.
- IT WAS.

668
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,767
HE WAS BOYD'S CELLMATE.

669
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,200
HE RAPED THREE WOMEN!

670
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,901
HE TORTURED THEM
JUST LIKE HE DID TO ME.

671
00:35:20,901 --> 00:35:22,467
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
- YOU WEREN'T THERE!

672
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:23,934
- JUST LISTEN TO ME.

673
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:26,467
HE'S WEARING AN ANKLE BRACELET
AS PART OF HIS PAROLE.

674
00:35:26,467 --> 00:35:28,133
IF HE LEAVES THIS PLACE,
IT GETS REPORTED.

675
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:29,467
I CHECKED.

HE NEVER HURT YOU.

680
00:35:40,834 --> 00:35:43,767
YOU WERE ABOUT TO MURDER
THE WRONG MAN.

681
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:51,300
- OH, FUCK.

682
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,334
- YOU SEE?
THIS IS WHERE IT LEADS.

683
00:35:54,334 --> 00:35:55,534
BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

684
00:35:55,534 --> 00:35:58,667
THERE'S STILL NO BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS.

685
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:06,734
- I JUST WANT TO FEEL BETTER.

686
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:08,901
I WANT ALL THIS TO GO AWAY.

- I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN.

- GO HOME...

BEHIND YOU,

I SWEAR WHAT YOU'RE FEELING NOW
WILL ONLY GET WORSE.

THAT'S HOW I LIKE TO START
MY FUCKING DAY.

701
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,367
YOU WANT TO MAKE
A BET WHY THIS ONE

WAS TAKING A WAD OF CASH
OUT OF THE ATM--

703
00:36:53,601 --> 00:36:55,701
GAMBLING, HOOKERS, DRUGS?

704
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:56,868
- YOU'RE VERY CYNICAL.

705
00:36:56,868 --> 00:36:59,767
- IT'S CALLED BEING
A DETECTIVE.

706
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:00,868
AND BLOW ME.

707
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:02,334
- YOU HAVE TO PUT
POSITIVE ENERGY

708
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:04,968
OUT INTO THE UNIVERSE.

709
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:07,033
[sighs]
RIGHT.

710
00:37:07,033 --> 00:37:10,200
BLOW YOU.

711
00:37:11,868 --> 00:37:14,567
- YOU SMELL THAT?

712
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:23,033
[flies buzzing]

713
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,033
HOLY SHIT.

714
00:37:29,634 --> 00:37:32,267
LITTLE HELP HERE?
ANYTIME YOU'RE READY.

715
00:37:32,267 --> 00:37:33,501

00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:07,067
- THIS IS DETECTIVE MORGAN
REQUESTING CSI

719
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:10,200
AND BODY TRANSPORT
AT 2075 OCEAN WAY

720
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,968
FOR A POSSIBLE
DOUBLE HOMICIDE.

721
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,100
AND YOU NEED TO TELL
MASUKA AND DEXTER

722
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,634
THAT THEY NEED TO BRING
A BUG KIT...

723
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,234
AND SOME FUCKING CRACKERS.

724
00:38:19,234 --> 00:38:22,267
[keypad tone]

725
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:25,467
YOU GOOD?

726
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,167
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.

727
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:04,367
- HEY, HEY, HEY!
- ANGEL!

728
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:06,033
- HEY, SERGEANT,
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE!

729
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,501
- THE ONLY MISTAKE I MADE
WAS NOT KICKING YOUR ASS

730
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:09,100
WHEN YOU FIRST LAID EYES
ON MY WIFE.

731
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,767
- ANGEL, LET HIM GO!
THIS IS A STING!

732
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,100
LET HIM GO!

733
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:18,701
- YOU'RE WEARING A WIRE?

734
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:21,801
- NO SHIT, YOU IDIOT.

735
00:39:21,801 --> 00:39:23,501
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HE
BARGED IN HERE A HALF HOUR AGO?

736
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:26,067
- I KNOW.

737
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:28,734
JUST GIVE US A MINUTE, JIM.

738
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:31,534
- YOU JUST DON'T LEARN,
DO YOU, BATISTA?

739
00:39:34,234 --> 00:39:37,467
- HAVE YOU COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND?

740
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:39,167
- I THOUGHT--
- WHAT?

741
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:40,167
THAT I WAS FUCKING HIM?

742
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,067
- WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO THINK?

743
00:39:42,067 --> 00:39:44,167
YOU BARELY TALK TO ME--

744
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,501
THE LATE NIGHTS,
THE SNEAKING AROUND.

745
00:39:46,501 --> 00:39:49,934
- HOW'D YOU FIND US?

746
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,868
WAIT.
YOU--

747
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:54,267
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

748
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:57,934
I.A. NEEDED MY HELP
TO BUST A NARCOTICS COP

749
00:39:57,934 --> 00:39:59,701
ON THE TAKE, AND I SAID YES.

750
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:00,767
WHY?

751
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,667
TO CLOSE THE BOOKS
ON YOUR BAR FIGHT!

752
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,634
SO I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT SNEAKING AROUND

753
00:40:05,634 --> 00:40:07,734
AND LATE NIGHTS!

754
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:09,267
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

755
00:40:09,267 --> 00:40:11,334
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TRUST ME?

756
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:13,167
- MARIA, I--

757
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:15,868
[cell phones rings]

758
00:40:15,868 --> 00:40:19,334
- MORGAN NEEDS US ON SITE--
DOUBLE HOMICIDE.

759
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,300
- MY CAR'S OUTSIDE.
- I'LL RIDE WITH PATROL.

760
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:34,033
- FUCK ME.

761
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:36,033
- COME ON, LIDDY.

762

[indistinct radio chatter]

763
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:40,968
[overlapping chatter]

764
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:46,434
- LIEUTENANT, ANY COMMENT?

765
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:48,534
- NOT NOW.
- LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA--

766
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:51,267
- IT'S LIKE THE FUCKING
FOOD CHAIN IN ACTION IN THERE.

767
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:53,267
FLIES--THE BLOW FLIES
ARE ATTRACTED BY THE SMELL

768
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:54,467
AND THEY LAY EGGS,
AND THE BEETLES--

769
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:55,467
THEY'RE DRAWN
BY THE LARVAE,

770
00:40:55,467 --> 00:40:56,667
AND THEY BURROW
INTO EVERY ORIFICE--

771
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:58,634
- I GET IT.
- WHAT DO WE KNOW?

772
00:40:58,634 --> 00:41:02,467
- THE VICS' NAMES
ARE DANIEL AND AWILDA ORTIZ.

773
00:41:02,467 --> 00:41:04,567
ATM FOOTAGE
SHOWED DANIEL TRYING

774
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:06,567
TO MAKE A MAXIMUM WITHDRAWAL
ABOUT FOUR WEEKS AGO.

775
00:41:06,567 --> 00:41:08,934
OFFICER MANZON AND I SHOW UP
TO INTERVIEW HIM,

776
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,334
AND WE FIND THE BODIES.

777
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,834
- THE REMAINS HAVE ALREADY
STARTED TO MUMMIFY,

778
00:41:12,834 --> 00:41:14,534
BUT THE WOUNDS ARE CONSISTENT
WITH A MACHETE.

779
00:41:14,534 --> 00:41:16,234
I CAN MAKE SURE
WHEN I GET THEM BACK TO THE LAB.

780
00:41:16,234 --> 00:41:18,067
- WE LIKE THE FUENTES BROTHERS
FOR THIS.

781
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:19,667
- ONLY WEIRD THING
IS WE CAN'T FIND

782
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:22,334
ANY SANTA CLAUS MUERTE
MUMBO JUMBO BULLSHIT.

783
00:41:22,334 --> 00:41:24,400
- WE MIGHT BE LOOKING
AT THE FUENTES BROTHERS'

784
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,901
FIRST VICTIMS.

785
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,634
THE DEFENSIVE WOUNDS
AND HEAVY SMEARING

786
00:41:27,634 --> 00:41:29,534
SUGGEST OUR KILLERS
WERE STILL INEXPERIENCED.

787
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:30,868
BEHEADING REQUIRES SKILL.

788
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:33,434
- SO WE GOT THEIR GODDAMN
TRAINING WHEELS KILL?

789
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:37,133
MEANS WE'RE BACK
TO FUCKING SQUARE ONE.

790
00:41:37,133 --> 00:41:38,434
- A LITTLE DOWNWIND, PLEASE.

791
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:40,734
- OH, YEAH.

792
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:42,868
THAT'S NEVER COMING OUT.
I LIKE THIS SHIRT TOO.

793
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:44,834
I'LL GET A JACKET
OUT OF MY CAR.

794
00:41:44,834 --> 00:41:47,434
- ALL RIGHT.

795
00:42:06,234 --> 00:42:07,334
- IT WAS NEVER A TATTOO.

796
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:11,067
IT WAS A STAMP
FROM A NIGHTCLUB.

797
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:14,901
IT WAS A FUCKING NIGHTCLUB!

798
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:17,067
IT'S A NIGHTCLUB!

799
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,801
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HER?

800
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:20,968
- FIND OUT, SERGEANT.

801
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:22,968
I'M GONNA GO DEAL
WITH THE PRESS.

802
00:42:22,968 --> 00:42:24,200
NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK,
DEXTER.

803
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,501
- GOOD TO BE BACK,
LIEUTENANT.

804
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:32,868
- REPORTS ON MY DESK,
FIRST THING.

805
00:42:32,868 --> 00:42:34,234
- [sighs]

806
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:36,400
ALL TOGETHER ONCE AGAIN.

807
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,200
ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY, EH,
DEXERINO?

808
00:42:55,934 --> 00:42:57,300
- YEAH.

809
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:10,300
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT.

810
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,801
- I DON'T MIND.

811
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:15,200
- I CAN PAY YOU BACK
FOR THE TICKET.

812
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,767
I'LL SEND YOU SOME MONEY.

813
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:19,467
EXCEPT...

814
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:24,434
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHO
TO SEND IT TO.

815
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:28,167
- DEXTER MORGAN.

816
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,968
AND IT'S NOT NECESSARY...

817
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:33,334
THE TICKET.

818
00:43:37,234 --> 00:43:40,634
- I CAME TO MIAMI
FOR A FRESH START--

819
00:43:40,634 --> 00:43:42,300
SOMEWHERE WARM.

820
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,501
- YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
YOUR PARENTS WILL BE...

821
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:47,834
HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

822
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,868
- I TRIED TO CALL THEM,
BUT I...

823
00:43:50,868 --> 00:43:53,200
I COULDN'T.

824
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,267
WHAT WOULD I SAY?

825
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:58,934
- JUST GIVE IT SOME TIME.

826
00:44:01,801 --> 00:44:06,701
- I CAN'T TELL THEM
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

827
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:10,467
I CAN'T TELL ANYONE.

828
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:14,667
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO KNOWS.

829
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:19,367
- YOU HAVE MY NUMBER.

830
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:22,067
CALL ME IF YOU NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

831
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,834
- I SHOULD--

832
00:44:27,834 --> 00:44:31,834

- IS THERE A PROBLEM?

843

- I CAN'T LET YOU THROUGH
TO YOUR GATE

844
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:22,801
UNLESS YOU CONSENT
TO A HAND SEARCH.

845
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:27,968
- LIFT YOUR ARMS.

MY FAULT O'MALLEY'S
IS ON THE WAY?

854
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,000

856
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:46,267

- HOW ABOUT I GET SOME STEAKS
AND BEER AND WE CELEBRATE?

865
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,767
- WELL, THERE'S NOTHING
TO CELEBRATE JUST YET,

00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:39,400
THEY THINK
I'M GONNA COP A PLEA,

882
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,234
THEY'RE BOTH CRACKING WALNUTS
UP THEIR ASS.

883
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:43,667
I'M GONNA FIGHT THIS THING
TO MY LAST DAMN DIME.

884
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:48,634
- YOU NEED SOME EXTRA CASH
FOR THOSE LAWYERS...

885
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:50,501
I MIGHT HAVE A JOB FOR YOU.

886
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,334
- REALLY?

887
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:53,868
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

888
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:55,634
- LOOKING INTO SOMEONE.
- WHO?

889
00:47:55,634 --> 00:47:58,501
- GUY I WORK WITH.
INTERESTED?

890
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,133
- I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD BE,

891
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:02,534
CONSIDERING WHO'S SITTING
IN FRONT OF ME MAKING THE OFFER.

892
00:48:02,534 --> 00:48:05,234
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
HAVE I EVER FUCKED YOU OVER?

893
00:48:05,234 --> 00:48:07,367
- NO, BUT LAGUERTA
JUST TAUGHT ME

894
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:09,000
THERE'S ALWAYS A FIRST TIME.

895
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,234
LOOK, QUINN,

896
00:48:10,234 --> 00:48:12,667
YOU FUCK WITH THE BULL,

897
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,801
YOU GET THE HORN.

898
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:15,901
YOU UNDERSTAND?

899
00:48:15,901 --> 00:48:17,968
- YEAH. DO YOU?

900
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,734
[laughter]

901
00:48:26,734 --> 00:48:27,834
- YOU GOT A NAME?

902
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:29,834
- DEXTER MORGAN.

903
00:48:29,834 --> 00:48:32,834
- DEXTER.

904
00:48:32,834 --> 00:48:34,801
WHAT THE FUCK KIND OF NAME
IS "DEXTER"?

905
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:43,767
- RAINBOWS ARE AN ILLUSION...

906
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,934
REFRACTED LIGHT TO MAKE US THINK
SOMETHING'S THERE

907
00:48:46,934 --> 00:48:48,734
WHEN IT'S REALLY NOT.

908
00:48:48,734 --> 00:48:51,667
IS THERE DARKNESS
IN HARRISON,

909
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:56,067
OR IS IT JUST MY OWN FEAR
BEING REFLECTED BACK?

910
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:59,968
- I JUST KNOW HE'S THE ONE
WHO SCRATCHED TEDDY.

911
00:48:59,968 --> 00:49:01,267
HE WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.

912
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:03,367
- DID YOU READ ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS MOTHER?

913
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:05,267
- THAT BOY WILL NEVER
BE THE SAME.

914
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:08,267
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH MY SON.

915
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:18,734
I'M SORRY FOR EVER THINKING
THE WORST, HARRISON.

916
00:49:18,734 --> 00:49:20,567
[baby coos]

917
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:22,000
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE MY SON.

918
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,367
WHATEVER WE HAVE TO FACE,
WE'LL FACE TOGETHER, OKAY?

919
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:28,801
OW!

920
00:49:28,801 --> 00:49:31,167
- HELLO, MA'AM.

921
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:35,234
WHERE YOU HEADED THIS AFTERNOON?
YOU NEED A CAB?

922
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:45,234
WELCOME TO MIAMI.

923
00:49:45,234 --> 00:49:47,200
[engine starts]
