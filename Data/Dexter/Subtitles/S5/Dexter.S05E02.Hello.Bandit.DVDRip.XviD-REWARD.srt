1
00:00:08,567 --> 00:00:10,334
- PREVIOUSLY, ON <i>DEXTER...</i>

2
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:13,767
RITA'S INSIDE.

3
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,300
IT WAS ME.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,801
- FBI?

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:18,300
FUCKING BUNCH OF IDIOTS.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,934
- YOU WANT TO TALK TO DEXTER,
SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT.

7
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:23,834
- I'LL DO THAT.

8
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:26,200
- IF THIS WERE
ANYONE BUT DEXTER,

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,634
WE'D AT LEAST BE THINKING
LIKE DETECTIVES.

10
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:30,734
WHEN THE WIFE IS DEAD,
90% OF THE TIME,

11
00:00:30,734 --> 00:00:32,200
THE HUSBAND DID IT.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,234
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:41,100
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT,
OR YOU JUST GONNA ACT WEIRD?

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,133
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

15
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:44,267
- ALL RITA AND I
EVER DID WAS KISS.

16
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:45,734
DEXTER FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE INDISCRETION,

17
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:49,400
AND, UH, CAME OVER
AND PUNCHED ME OUT.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,934
- ARTHUR MITCHELL.

19
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,434
- KYLE BUTLER.

20
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:53,767
- AND WHAT'S HIS NAME?

21
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:54,868
- UH, KYLE BUTLER.

22
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,467
- SOMETHING HAPPENED...

23
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:00,167
TO YOUR MOM.

24
00:01:00,167 --> 00:01:02,000
- SHE'S DEAD!

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,300
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
TO YOU!

26
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,801
I WISH <i>YOU</i> WERE DEAD!

27
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,100
- I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE FBI.

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,734
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER'S
INTERVIEW.

29
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,767
- DON'T TELL ME.
WHAT'D HE SAY?

30
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:09,834
- HE DIDN'T SHOW.

31
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:11,400
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE FUCK YOU ARE

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,634
OR WHY YOU THINK YOU CAN FUCKING
RUN AWAY FROM THE FBI,

33
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:14,734
BUT YOU BETTER
GET BACK HERE BEF--

34
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:15,934
[beep]

35
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:20,400
- MY WIFE DIED,
AND IT WAS MY FAULT.

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,501
- YOUR DEAD WIFE
CAN SUCK MY DICK.

37
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,767
- THAT'S THE FIRST HUMAN THING
I'VE SEEN YOU DO

38
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,300
SINCE SHE DIED, DEXTER.

39
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,367
THEY'RE NOT BETTER OFF
WITHOUT YOU.

40
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:37,767
YOU'RE NOT BETTER OFF
WITHOUT THEM.

41
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:39,701
YOU NEED TO GO BACK.

42
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:51,767
[quirky music]

43
00:01:51,767 --> 00:01:59,734
* *

44
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:40,934
- IT'S SAID THERE ARE
SEVEN STAGES OF GRIEF.

45
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,300
I SUPPOSE KILLING SOMEONE

46
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,000
WITH MY BARE HANDS
IN A MEN'S ROOM

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,334
WAS MY WAY OF WORKING
THROUGH THE ANGER STAGE.

48
00:03:52,033 --> 00:03:57,901
WHATEVER THE OTHER
SIX STAGES ARE...

49
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:00,234
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THEM.

50
00:04:04,868 --> 00:04:09,601
'CAUSE NOW
I'M A FULL-TIME DAD.

51
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:12,534
ONCE THE KIDS AND I
ARE BACK TOGETHER,

52
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:14,934
IT'LL ALL BE FINE.

53
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,467
- I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE
ALL GONNA SQUISH IN HERE.

54
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:30,634
- IT'S JUST TEMPORARY,
TILL WE CAN GET A NEW PLACE.

55
00:04:30,634 --> 00:04:31,968
- HERE...

56
00:04:31,968 --> 00:04:35,567
HE NEEDS TO BE
HOSED OFF OR SOMETHING.

57
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,501
HEY.

58
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:38,968
WELCOME HOME.

59
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,834
- THIS ISN'T OUR HOME.

60
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,367
AND WHY DO WE NEED
A NEW PLACE, ANYWAY?

61
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,634
- I THINK STARTING
IN A NEW APARTMENT

62
00:04:44,634 --> 00:04:45,667
WILL BE GOOD FOR US.

63
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:47,000
LOOK, I FOUND A PLACE

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,234
PRACTICALLY ON THE BEACH.

65
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:50,901
OR ANOTHER ONE
RIGHT NEXT TO A PARK.

66
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:52,501
- BUT, UNTIL THEN, ASTOR,

67
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,667
YOU GET TO SHARE
THE BED WITH ME.

68
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,567
AND, DEX,
YOU'RE ON THE COUCH.

69
00:04:56,567 --> 00:05:00,467
CODY, YOU'RE ON THE COT.

70
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,467
- TIME FOR YOU BOTH
TO GET TO BED--SCHOOL TOMORROW.

71
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,334
- HOW CAN I GO TO SCHOOL?

72
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,968
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
ANY OF MY THINGS.

73
00:05:06,968 --> 00:05:08,267
- [crying]

74
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,734
- MAKE A LIST.
I'LL GO BY THE HOUSE TOMORROW.

75
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:11,234
- I WANT TO GO WITH YOU.

76
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:12,801
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

77
00:05:12,801 --> 00:05:14,567
- WHY?

78
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,434
- WELL...

79
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:18,334
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOTHER THERE.

80
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,434
- I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY MOM.

81
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,567
SHE WAS MURDERED.

82
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:31,167
- DON'T FORGET,
9 A.M. TOMORROW.

83
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,434
FBI INTERVIEW.

84
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:36,000
- [crying]

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,667
- ONE FINAL LOOSE END
TO TIE UP

86
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,234
BEFORE PUTTING
ALL THIS BEHIND ME.

87
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,434
- AT THE TIME
OF YOUR WIFE'S DEATH,

88
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:48,033
YOU WERE...

89
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:49,667
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
I WAS ON MY BOAT.

90
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,367
- RIGHT.

91
00:05:51,367 --> 00:05:53,634
JUST SEEMED ODD.

92
00:05:53,634 --> 00:05:55,934
YOU DO A LOT OF NIGHT BOATING,
MR. MORGAN?

93
00:05:55,934 --> 00:05:57,334
- SOMETIMES.
IT'S MORE PEACEFUL.

94
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:58,667
- AND YOU WERE BY YOURSELF?

95
00:05:58,667 --> 00:05:59,968
- YES, I WAS ALONE.

96
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,167
THERE'S SECURITY CAMERAS
AT THE MARINA.

97
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,834
YOU CAN SEE ME LEAVING
AND RETURNING.

98
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:04,300
- WE'VE SEEN THE FOOTAGE,
MR. MORGAN.

99
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,567
THE PROBLEM IS, ACCORDING
TO THE CORONER'S REPORT,

100
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,968
YOUR WIFE
WAS KILLED SEVERAL HOURS

101
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:09,200
BEFORE YOU GOT ON THE BOAT.

102
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,501
- IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

103
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:12,634
YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?

104
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:17,367
SUGGESTING I HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MY WIFE'S DEATH...

105
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:18,434
THAT I'D SLICE HER ARTERY,

106
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:19,534
LET HER BLEED OUT
IN THE BATHROOM--

107
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:21,234
- MR. MORGAN,

108
00:06:21,234 --> 00:06:23,601
WE KNOW THAT YOU WERE
AT ARTHUR MITCHELL'S HOUSE.

109
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:29,334
AT THE TIME
OF YOUR WIFE'S DEATH,

110
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:30,567
YOU WERE PART OF THE TEAM

111
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,501
THAT RAIDED
ARTHUR MITCHELL'S HOUSE.

112
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:34,934
- [sighs]

113
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:37,400
RIGHT, OF COURSE.

114
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,601
- WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T
KILL YOUR WIFE.

115
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:41,000
- WE'RE JUST LOOKING
FOR A REASON

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,501
WHY ARTHUR MITCHELL
MIGHT HAVE TARGETED HER.

117
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:52,033
- BECAUSE
HE'S A SERIAL KILLER?

118
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,300
- HOW'D IT GO?

119
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,701
- IT'S...FINE.

120
00:07:02,701 --> 00:07:06,100
I'M JUST GLAD IT'S OVER,
AND I CAN MOVE ON.

121
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,701
- WE MISS YOU, BROTHER.

122
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:08,968
- YEAH?

123
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:11,367
HOW'S HANDLING THE DEPARTMENT
ALL BY YOURSELF?

124
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:13,033
- AH, IT'S A BREEZE.

125
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,367
- I'LL BE BACK
IN A FEW DAYS.

126
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,868
- OH, NO, YOU WON'T.

127
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:17,300
YOU'RE TAKING
AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK.

128
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,701
YOU NEED TO SPEND TIME
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

129
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,200
- THANKS.

130
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,300
- EXCUSE ME.

131
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,267
- ANYTHING YOU NEED, DEXTER,
JUST ASK.

132
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,734
- I WILL.

133
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:28,701
SEE YOU TONIGHT.

134
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,968
OH, GRANDPARENTS
STOPPING BY TOO.

135
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,734
- THEY'RE ALL STAYING
AT YOUR PLACE?

136
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:36,968
- YEAH.

137
00:07:36,968 --> 00:07:39,167
IT'S CROWDED.

138
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,567
BUT IT'S TEMPORARY.

139
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:41,734
HE JUST DOESN'T WANT
THE KIDS STAYING AT THE HOUSE

140
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:44,234
WHERE THEIR MOM...
- RIGHT.

141
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,033
- SO...WE ALL GOOD HERE?

142
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:47,400
- YEAH, HE'S AIRTIGHT.

143
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,067
BUT OTHERWISE,
WE GOT JACK SHIT.

144
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,567
ARTHUR MITCHELL DISAPPEARED.

145
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:54,467
THE ONLY LEAD WE HAVE NOW
IS THIS KYLE BUTLER.

146
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:56,334
- WE HAD A MURDER VICTIM
BY THAT NAME

147
00:07:56,334 --> 00:07:57,534
A FEW WEEKS BACK.

148
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,734
- WELL, OUR GUY'S ALIVE,
AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

149
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:01,701
UNFORTUNATELY,
HE'S DISAPPEARED AS WELL.

150
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:03,000
WE'RE GONNA
HAVE A SKETCH ARTIST

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,701
MEET WITH THE FAMILY,
AND GET A COMPOSITE OF HIM.

152
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,033
- OKAY.

153
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:08,100
WELL, I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D KEEP ME POSTED.

154
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
- WILL DO.

155
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,767
- OH, HEY.

156
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,968
MARIA, YOUR MAIL.

157
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,901
 <i>¿PERO QUE CONO?</i>

158
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,767
- SO, DEXTER MORGAN,

159
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:45,501
LET'S GET YOU A MOVING VAN.

160
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:47,767
AREN'T YOU A CUTE KID, HUH?

161
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,100
HUH?
[laughs]

162
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,467
- HE'S NOT ACTUALLY
TALKING YET.

163
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:52,968
HERE'S YOUR 18-FOOTER.

164
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,734
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

165
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,100
- HARRISON.

166
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,300
- 14-FOOTER.

167
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,868
IT'S A FAMILY NAME?

168
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,567
- BLOOD.

169
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,334
UH, SORT OF.

170
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,834
- SO WHAT KIND OF STUFF
YOU MOVING?

171
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:12,534
- JUST, UH, FURNITURE,
CLOTHES.

172
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:14,334
UH, DRESSER, MAYBE.

173
00:09:14,334 --> 00:09:16,167
PLENTY OF REASONS
FOR BLOOD TO BE THERE.

174
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:17,801
SOMEONE CUT HIMSELF MOVING...

175
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:19,534
- WELL, IF THAT'S ALL
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT,

176
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:21,767
SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY,
GO WITH THE 10-FOOTER.

177
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:24,234
- [sighs]

178
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:26,601
I CAN'T
LET MYSELF THINK ABOUT THIS.

179
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:28,734
I'VE JUST GOT
TO MOVE THE KIDS.

180
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,133
ACTUALLY, I THINK I'LL GO
WITH THE 14-FOOTER.

181
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:37,601
- OKAY, LET'S, UH,
WRITE YOU UP.

182
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,634
- [grunts]

183
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,467
[makes quacking noise]

184
00:09:54,434 --> 00:09:57,567
[clattering]

185
00:09:57,567 --> 00:10:00,567
WE'RE GONNA GET
A MUCH BETTER PLACE.

186
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,067
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
CLOSER TO THE PARK

187
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:03,801
OR THE BEACH?

188
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:04,968
[clattering]

189
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:06,400
- HELLO?

190
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,834
[knocking]
DEXTER?

191
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:11,000
- NO ANNOYING NEIGHBORS.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,501
- HEY, DEX.

193
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:15,100
- BROUGHT YOUR MAIL.
- THANKS.

194
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,300
WOW, LOOK AT HARRISON.

195
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,834
BOY, HE'S JUST GETTING BIGGER
EVERY DAY.

196
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:31,667
HEY, LOOK, DEX, UM...

197
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:33,767
YOU KNOW, WE HAVEN'T
HAD A CHANCE TO TALK.

198
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,300
BUT I JUST--
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

199
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,100
HOW SORRY I AM
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

200
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,334
- THANKS.

201
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:42,534
- HAVE THEY CAUGHT
THE TRINITY KILLER YET OR--

202
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:44,033
- [sighs] NO.
- [sighs]

203
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,834
MAN, IF I COULD JUST
GET MY HANDS ON HIM.

204
00:10:45,834 --> 00:10:47,400
- I CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

205
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,667
- HEY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

206
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,734
I KNOW WE'VE
HAD OUR DIFFERENCES,

207
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:52,033
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M A SINGLE DAD.

208
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,334
I MEAN, I KNOW THE ROPES, SO...

209
00:10:53,334 --> 00:10:55,367
IF YOU NEED ANY HELP--
- NO, I'M GOOD.

210
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:56,834
- 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU GOTTA GIVE UP A LOT.

211
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,667
I MEAN, I ACTUALLY HAVE A PRETTY
DECENT CAREER GOING, YOU KNOW.

212
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:01,367
BUT I HAD TO TURN DOWN
SOME MAJOR JOB OFFERS

213
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:02,834
SO I COULD JUST
WORK AT HOME

214
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,367
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,
BE THERE FOR THOSE KIDS.

215
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:06,234
- GOOD FOR YOU.

216
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:09,100
- I MEAN, FORGET
ABOUT ANY FREE TIME.

217
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,000
OR ANY LIFE OF YOUR OWN,
REALLY.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,667
I MEAN, YOU JUST, YOU KNOW,
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE.

219
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,200
RIGHT? EVERY MORNING.
EVERY EVENING.

220
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,501
EVERY WEEKEND.

221
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,501
YOU READY TO DO THAT, DEX,

222
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:20,868
FOR THE KIDS?

223
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:22,834
- YES, ELLIOT,
I'M READY TO DO THAT.

224
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:24,601
FOR THE KIDS.

225
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:27,567
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
HERE, LET ME--

226
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:28,567
- NO! I GOT IT.

227
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,000
- OKAY, WELL...

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,934
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT WORKS OUT.

229
00:11:31,934 --> 00:11:33,300
IT REALLY DOES, YOU KNOW.

230
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,267
I MEAN, YEAH, YOU HAVE
TO GIVE UP YOUR LIFE AND ALL,

231
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:36,834
BUT, UH...YOU KNOW WHAT?

232
00:11:36,834 --> 00:11:38,601
YOU JUST--YOU LIVE
FOR THOSE KIDS,

233
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:42,701
AND...IT'S SATISFYING.

234
00:11:44,534 --> 00:11:45,701
- EXCUSE ME.
- YEAH.

235
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,100
- [clears throat]

236
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:55,234
I'LL BE A GOOD FATHER.
EVERYONE MAKES SACRIFICES.

237
00:11:55,234 --> 00:11:56,234
I CAN TOO.

238
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,567
FOCUS ON THE KIDS.

239
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,834
- WOW, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE GONNA BRING SO MUCH.

240
00:12:19,834 --> 00:12:21,000
YOU CAN JUST PUT THAT...

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
- [grunts]

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
- RIGHT THERE IS GREAT.

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,434
- I EMPTIED THE REFRIGERATOR.

244
00:12:24,434 --> 00:12:26,567
SOMEONE LEFT
ANOTHER CAKE AT THE DOOR.

245
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:28,200
- I JUST ATE
A WHOLE TUNA CASSEROLE

246
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,033
TO MAKE ROOM IN THE APARTMENT.

247
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,868
CODY, THIS IS A GOOD JOB
FOR YOU.

248
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,067
WANNA HELP ME
UNLOAD THE FOOD?

249
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:34,934
- OKAY.

250
00:12:36,734 --> 00:12:40,467
- WOW. YOU SURE DO HAVE
A LOT OF BEER, AUNT DEB.

251
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:41,868
[Deb chuckles]

252
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:43,200
- UH...

253
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,801
PEOPLE JUST KEEP BRINGING IT.

254
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:47,067
HEH.

255
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:49,734
- THIS IS ALL YOU BROUGHT?

256
00:12:49,734 --> 00:12:52,467
- UH, WELL, WE'RE A LITTLE
SHORT ON SPACE.

257
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,434
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN
BRING THE RIGHT CLOTHES.

258
00:12:54,434 --> 00:12:56,033
THIS IS MY REJECT STUFF.

259
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,400
I CAN'T WEAR
ANY OF THIS TO SCHOOL.

260
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,400
- ASTOR, COME ON.
NO ONE'S GONNA NOTICE YOU.

261
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,367
- [gasps]

262
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,367
- UHH, OKAY.

263
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,667
HONEY, WOULD YOU
HOLD THE BABY?

264
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,968
- COME HERE.
- CODY.

265
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:14,000
WHY DON'T YOU HELP US
CARRY THE LAST LOAD IN, HMM?

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,534
- I LIKE IT HERE.
IT'S LIKE CAMPING.

267
00:13:18,234 --> 00:13:20,100
- EXACTLY.

268
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,968
BOYS ARE EASIER.

269
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,901
IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH
I LOVE MY CHILDREN,

270
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:35,834
I'M STILL A CREATURE
OF THE NIGHT.

271
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,033
[Harrison fussing]

272
00:13:44,033 --> 00:13:45,868
- CAN'T SLEEP EITHER?

273
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,567
THE BLOOD
PROBABLY MEANS NOTHING.

274
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:57,767
SOMEONE CUT THEIR FINGER
WHILE MOVING.

275
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,734
BUT I WON'T BE ABLE
TO PUT IT OUT OF MY MIND

276
00:13:59,734 --> 00:14:03,033
UNTIL I KNOW FOR SURE.

277
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:05,434
[truck door rattling]

278
00:14:07,834 --> 00:14:11,133
[spraying]

279
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,400
- SOMEONE DID
A QUICK CLEANUP JOB

280
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,367
BUT FORGOT
TO WASH THE DOOR.

281
00:14:14,367 --> 00:14:15,968
[baby coos]

282
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,067
[whispering]
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY.

283
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,234
I KNOW.

284
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:22,634
BUT NOT THE STORY
IT TELLS.

285
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:27,067
ONCE UPON A TIME,

286
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,367
AN EVIL GREEN OGRE

287
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,801
LEFT A CIRCULAR SPATTER
AT THREE FEET HIGH,

288
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:35,067
CONSISTENT WITH
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA...

289
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:38,400
WHICH SEEMS TO INDICATE
THE HANDSOME YOUNG PRINCE

290
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,634
WAS HIT WHILE ON HIS KNEES,

291
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:42,300
AT LEAST TWO OR THREE TIMES.

292
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:49,167
OR THE PRINCESS
WAS ON HER KNEES.

293
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,000
SMALL HANDS.

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,767
FEMALE.

295
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:07,267
[sighs]

296
00:15:07,267 --> 00:15:10,367
- I THOUGHT THE KIDS WERE
YOUR NUMBER ONE RESPONSIBILITY.

297
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,467
- THEY ARE.
- BUT HERE YOU ARE...

298
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:13,601
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

299
00:15:13,601 --> 00:15:15,968
- IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

300
00:15:15,968 --> 00:15:16,968
- IT NEVER IS.

301
00:15:18,734 --> 00:15:20,634
- IT'S LIKE WHEN
YOU GET ON A PLANE.

302
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:23,167
THEY TELL YOU
IF THE OXYGEN MASKS COME DOWN

303
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,801
TO PUT YOURS ON FIRST
BEFORE HELPING THE KIDS.

304
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,734
I HAVE TO TAKE CARE
OF MY OWN NEEDS TOO.

305
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:32,067
OTHERWISE, I RISK
SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL.

306
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,934
AND THAT'S NOT GOOD
FOR ANYONE.

307
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,367
- I'M NOT JUST SAYING THIS
FOR THE SAKE OF THE KIDS, DEX,

308
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,934
BUT FOR YOU.

309
00:15:37,934 --> 00:15:41,133
THEY'RE NOT ONLY
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

310
00:15:41,133 --> 00:15:42,701
THEY'RE YOUR SALVATION.

311
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:51,934
- I HAVE TO GIVE HIM
A BOTTLE.

312
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,834
NO REASON
A TRUCK RENTAL AGENCY

313
00:16:12,834 --> 00:16:15,300
WOULD PUT ANY SERIOUS
SAFEGUARDS ON THEIR RECORDS.

314
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:22,234
THE TRUCK WAS MOST RECENTLY
RENTED TO BOYD FOWLER.

315
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:24,567
BOYD SEEMS TO HAVE
LISTED HIS ADDRESS

316
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,067
AS THE DEPARTMENT
OF SANITATION.

317
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:30,234
NO HOME ADDRESS.

318
00:16:30,234 --> 00:16:32,868
MIAMI/DADE COUNTY DEPARTMENT
OF SANITATION,

319
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,367
DIVISION OF
DEAD ANIMAL PICKUP,

320
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:37,501
MEANING THE BLOOD BELONGS
TO AN ANIMAL.

321
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:45,100
BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE
LITTLE HANDPRINTS?

322
00:17:00,534 --> 00:17:02,634
TWO LINES.

323
00:17:02,634 --> 00:17:03,601
HUMAN.

324
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:25,033
- WELL, WELL, WELL.
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

325
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:28,234
- RACCOON.

326
00:17:28,234 --> 00:17:30,000
- YOU CALL THIS IN?
- YEAH, I DID.

327
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,300
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD,

328
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,334
AND...I SAW IT.

329
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:34,868
KIND OF CREEPS ME OUT.

330
00:17:34,868 --> 00:17:37,501
YOU'RE PROBABLY USED TO
SEEING DEAD THINGS, THOUGH, HUH?

331
00:17:37,501 --> 00:17:39,467
- CAN'T SAY I EVER
GET USED TO IT.

332
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:40,834
- I DON'T USUALLY
COME THIS WAY,

333
00:17:40,834 --> 00:17:42,601
BUT I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF MOVING TO A NEW PLACE.

334
00:17:42,601 --> 00:17:44,834
IT'S A HASSLE, HUH?
MOVING?

335
00:17:44,834 --> 00:17:46,200
- I WOULDN'T KNOW.
- NO?

336
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,234
- LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

337
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,701
- SO WHY DID YOU
RENT A MOVING VAN?

338
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:52,534
- HELLO THERE, BANDIT.

339
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,534
THIS DON'T LOOK RIGHT.

340
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,901
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

341
00:17:58,901 --> 00:18:00,801
- WELL, USUALLY, YOU FIND
A DEAD ANIMAL IN THE ROAD,

342
00:18:00,801 --> 00:18:02,434
IT MEANS
HE WAS HIT BY A CAR.

343
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,467
BUT THERE'S NO TIRE MARKS
OR BLOOD ON THE ASPHALT.

344
00:18:04,467 --> 00:18:07,300
THIS RACCOON WAS KILLED
SOMEPLACE ELSE AND DROPPED HERE.

345
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,067
- HE'S CSI-ing ME.

346
00:18:15,234 --> 00:18:17,400
- HE'S GOT
DEFENSIVE WOUNDS ON HIS PAWS.

347
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,968
LITTLE GUY PUT UP
QUITE A STRUGGLE.

348
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:32,834
ALL RIGHTY THEN.

349
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:35,067
[engine starts]

350
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:40,767
- HE'S DEFINITELY PECULIAR.

351
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,400
BUT I GUESS
THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST

352
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,033
DON'T TYPICALLY GET INTO
DEAD ANIMAL PICKUP.

353
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:54,067
[indistinct chatter]

354
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,667
- JUST SO YOU KNOW, OKAY?

355
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:58,133
- WHAT DO WE GOT?

356
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,734
- WE GOT A FEMALE VICTIM.

357
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:01,200
PART OF
A FEMALE VICTIM.

358
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,801
- PART?
- WE GOT A HEAD.

359
00:19:02,801 --> 00:19:04,567
- JUST A HEAD?

360
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:05,701
- YEAH.

361
00:19:05,701 --> 00:19:06,934
DECAPITATION.

362
00:19:06,934 --> 00:19:08,467
PROBABLY SOME KIND
OF DRUG KILLING.

363
00:19:08,467 --> 00:19:09,400
- NICE.

364
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:17,501
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
HYPOTHETICAL.

365
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:20,133
SAY A NEWLY-MARRIED PERSON...
- MM-HMM.

366
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:22,901
- ACCIDENTALLY DISCOVERS
THAT HIS OR HER NEW SPOUSE

367
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:25,100
HAS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT
WITH A LOT OF MONEY.

368
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,734
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT ONE
SHOULD EXPECT TO SHARE?

369
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,968
- FUCK, NO.
THAT'S YOUR MONEY.

370
00:19:30,968 --> 00:19:33,267
YOU TELL THE LIEUTENANT TO KEEP
HER FUCKIN' HANDS OFF IT.

371
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:37,467
- TAKE ME TO THE HEAD.

372
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,767
- ALL RIGHT.

373
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,834
[indistinct chatter]

374
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,534
- SHE WAS STILL ALIVE
WHEN THEY CUT HER HEAD OFF.

375
00:19:48,534 --> 00:19:50,834
EXCISION OF EYES AND TONGUE
WAS DONE POSTMORTEM.

376
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,367
- THAT'S CONSIDERATE OF THEM.

377
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,200
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

378
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,634
IT'S JUST A HEAD.

379
00:19:55,634 --> 00:19:58,100
- UNLESS THEY BURIED HER
STANDING UP.

380
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,734
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

381
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:06,000
- JUST TRYING TO HELP.
YOU'RE LOOKING A LITTLE RAGGED.

382
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,200
- I'M EXHAUSTED.

383
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,834
THERE ARE FIVE PEOPLE
IN MY TINY APARTMENT.

384
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:10,167
I SHARED A BED
WITH ASTOR LAST NIGHT,

385
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,734
AND SHE KICKED ME
ALL NIGHT LONG.

386
00:20:11,734 --> 00:20:13,667
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO CRASH AT MY PLACE,

387
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:14,767
IF YOU WANT.

388
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:17,167
- UH, NO THANKS, DETECTIVE.

389
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:18,367
- OKAY.

390
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:23,601
- IT LOOKS LIKE SANTA MUERTE.

391
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:25,200
- WHAT?

392
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,267
- SANTA MUERTE, THE CULT.
"SAINT DEATH."

393
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:30,334
- YEAH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS,
BUT WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

394
00:20:30,334 --> 00:20:32,434
- WELL, THE MISSING EYES
AND TONGUE

395
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:33,968
WERE MEANT TO SEND A MESSAGE.

396
00:20:33,968 --> 00:20:36,701
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

397
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:38,033
- WHO ARE YOU?

398
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:40,467
- OFFICER MANZON.
CIRA.

399
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,133
THE GOLDEN CANDLES MEAN MONEY.

400
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:43,634
THE ICONS, I DON'T KNOW.

401
00:20:43,634 --> 00:20:45,400
THERE'S SO MANY NOW, YOU...

402
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,567
MIGHT NEED AN EXPERT ON IT.

403
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,100
- AND YOU KNOW
ALL OF THIS BECAUSE...

404
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
- IT'S MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

405
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,133
AND IF IT IS
SANTA MUERTE...

406
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:53,767
THEY USED A MACHETE ON HER.

407
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,334
- OKAY, WELL,
WE'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

408
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:57,567
BUT THIS PARK IS
A LOCAL DRUG HANGOUT,

409
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:59,067
AND DRUG CARTELS
LIKE TO CUT HEADS OFF.

410
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:00,300
SO WE MIGHT
FOLLOW THAT LEAD.

411
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,167
- OF COURSE.

412
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,100
- HEY...WE FOUND THE BODY

413
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,634
ON THE OTHER END OF THE PARK,
UNDER SOME BUSHES, NO I.D.

414
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:11,167
GOTTA CANVASS THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
START ASKING QUESTIONS.

415
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:13,234
- NO ONE WILL TALK.
THEY'RE TOO AFRAID.

416
00:21:13,234 --> 00:21:15,234
- WELL, WE STILL ASK,
OFFICER.

417
00:21:19,767 --> 00:21:22,968
- "HELPING YOUR CHILDREN
COPE WITH GRIEF."

418

"GRANDPA'S GONE TO HEAVEN."

00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:32,267
"SAYING GOOD-BYE TO FLUFFY."

420
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:35,000
BUT NOTHING ON
"MOMMY BLED OUT IN A BATHTUB."

421
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,634
BOYD FOWLER,
YOU HAVE A PRISON RECORD.

422
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:52,567
ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

423

18 MONTHS AT OKEECHOBEE.

424
00:21:58,033 --> 00:21:59,434
YOU SAID YOU LIVED IN A HOUSE,

425
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:03,467
BUT THERE ARE NO MORTGAGE
RECORDS IN YOUR NAME.

426
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:07,934
IN THE SAME HOUSE
FOR OVER 20 YEARS.

427
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:11,167
YOU INHERITED IT
FROM YOUR PARENTS,

428
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:14,167
RICH AND ELSIE FOWLER
IN OPA-LOCKA.

430
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,634
HEY.

431
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:22,267
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

432
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:25,167
- A WHOLE AFTERNOON GETTING
DOORS SHUT IN MY FACE.

433
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:27,334
- SORRY.

434
00:22:27,334 --> 00:22:30,400
- YOU?

435
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,701
- OKAY.

436
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,567
WE FINISHED LAGUERTA'S
CASEROLA DE CAMARONES

437
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,133
AND MASUKA'S
CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE,

438
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:38,534
AND ASTOR TOLD ME
SHE HATED LIVING HERE.

439
00:22:38,534 --> 00:22:42,300
THEY'RE BOTH
ASLEEP IN THE BED.

440
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,667
LOOKING AT APARTMENTS.

441
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:48,667
- SO IT'S EVERYTHING
AS USUAL.

442
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,033
- [sighs]

443
00:22:50,033 --> 00:22:52,300
THEY'RE SEEING
A GRIEF COUNSELOR TOMORROW.

444
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,400
- MAYBE THAT'LL HELP.

445
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,234
STILL, EVEN AFTER...

446
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:59,501
- WHAT?

447
00:22:59,501 --> 00:23:01,467
- YOU'RE GONNA BE

RAISING THREE KIDS.

449
00:23:03,434 --> 00:23:05,834
GONNA BE HARD.

450
00:23:05,834 --> 00:23:07,901
RITA WAS A GREAT MOM.

451
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:09,701
- THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO
TO MAKE UP FOR THAT.

452
00:23:09,701 --> 00:23:11,868
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TRY.

453
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:17,000
- WELL, I'LL BE HERE.

454
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,200
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

455
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,267
THE KIDS'LL BE OKAY.

456
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,601
I KNOW THAT PLACE.
IT'S NEAR THE STATION.

00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:39,501
- GREAT.

460
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,067
YOU WANT THE COUCH TONIGHT?

461
00:23:41,067 --> 00:23:42,734
- NO, YOU TAKE IT.

- JUST GIVING YOU
A KISS HELLO.

468
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,267
- I-I CAME OVER HERE
TO SLEEP,

469
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:22,901
NOT TO HAVE YOUR FAT LITTLE
SAUSAGE FINGERS ALL OVER ME.

470
00:24:22,901 --> 00:24:24,234
- [chuckles]

471
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,634
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ME
AT MY OWN PLACE.

472
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:34,367
UNLESS I WANT TO CURL UP INSIDE
A FUCKIN' TOASTER OVEN.

473
00:24:34,367 --> 00:24:35,567
[grunts]

474
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,734
I'M TRYING SO HARD
TO BE A GOOD SISTER,

'CAUSE FUCK KNOWS, DEXTER'S
ALWAYS BEEN THE BEST BROTHER.

476
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:43,701
BUT...IT IS
FUCKING EXHAUSTING.

477
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:44,801
- I'M SURE.

478
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,100
WELL, LOOK,

479
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,968
YOU'RE, UH,
WELCOME TO STAY HERE

00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:50,434

WHENEVER YOU WANT.

482
00:24:51,901 --> 00:24:55,367
AND I PROMISE TO KEEP MY FAT
LITTLE SAUSAGE FINGERS OFF YOU.

483
00:24:55,367 --> 00:24:56,834
- YOU BETTER.

484
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:58,701
- HOW'S YOUR BROTHER?
- YOU KNOW.

485
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:00,367
- I HEARD THE FBI INTERVIEW
WENT WELL.

486
00:25:00,367 --> 00:25:01,467
I MEAN, THAT MUST
BE A LOAD OFF.

487
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,801
- WHY WOULD
THAT BE A LOAD OFF?

488
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,701
- [scoffs] NOTHIN'.
NEVER MIND.

489
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:07,267
- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
NAMED KYLE BUTLER

490
00:25:07,267 --> 00:25:08,868
WHO'S A FRIEND
OF ARTHUR MITCHELL'S.

491
00:25:08,868 --> 00:25:10,067
THEY THINK
IF THEY CAN FIND HIM,

492
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:11,267
THEN HE CAN LEAD THEM
TO MITCHELL.

493
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:12,334
- BUT THEY CAN'T FIND HIM?

494
00:25:12,334 --> 00:25:13,667
- WELL, NOT YET.

495
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:14,834
THEY'RE HAVING SKETCHES DONE.

496
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:16,367
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET
A POSITIVE I.D.

497
00:25:16,367 --> 00:25:17,601
- KYLE BUTLER.

498
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:19,167
WHY DOES THAT NAME
SOUND SO FAMILIAR?

499
00:25:19,167 --> 00:25:20,267
- WELL, THAT'S
THE WEIRD THING.

500
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,834
WE WORKED THAT CASE,
REMEMBER?

501
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:23,267
A DEAD KYLE BUTLER.

502
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:25,067
- RIGHT, HE GOT HIS HEAD
SMASHED IN.

503
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:27,834
WENT UNSOLVED.

504
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:30,067
ANY CONNECTION?
- I DON'T KNOW.

505
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:33,367
I'M SURE THE FBI WILL
FIND A WAY TO FUCK IT UP.

506
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:35,801
WILL YOU GET THE LIGHTS?

507
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,033
- YES, MA'AM.

508
00:25:42,534 --> 00:25:44,234
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
FOR THE NEXT BATCH?

509
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:46,100
MICKEY MOUSE, SILVER DOLLAR?

510
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,300
GREAT BIG ONES?
- TRIANGLES.

511
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,968
- A CHALLENGE.

512
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:51,701
[sizzling]

513
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:54,367
- DEXTER'S MAKING
TRIANGLE PANCAKES.

514
00:25:54,367 --> 00:25:57,000
- ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE MORE FREEFORM.

515
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,067
WANNA SET THE TABLE
FOR US?

516
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,400
- UH, SURE.

517
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:05,400
THEY'RE JUST BLOBS.

518
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,667
- HOW DARE YOU?

519
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:14,200
- TRIANGLES.

520
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
[laughing]

521
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:23,167
- I COUNTED TOO MANY PLATES.

522
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:26,834
- MOM'S NOT HERE.

523
00:26:26,834 --> 00:26:28,501
- THAT'S OKAY.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

524
00:26:28,501 --> 00:26:31,234
SHE SHOULD BE HERE.
- I'M SORRY.

525
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:32,934
- THAT DOESN'T
MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

526
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:34,400
- ASTOR, I'M DOING
THE BEST I CAN HERE.

527
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,801
LET'S JUST...SIT DOWN
AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST.

528
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:38,334
- I DON'T WANT TO!

529
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:40,400
I WANNA GO BACK HOME!
- ASTOR--

530
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,200
- STOP IT!
- YEAH, JUST STOP IT!

531
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,467
- BOTH OF YOU JUST STOP
FIGHTING ALL THE TIME!

532
00:26:44,467 --> 00:26:45,868
I HATE IT!

533
00:26:54,767 --> 00:26:55,901
[door slams]

534
00:26:57,234 --> 00:26:59,067
- WHILE THEY'RE SEEING
THE GRIEF COUNSELOR,

535
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,701
I'LL BE GETTING
MY OWN KIND OF THERAPY.

536
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:09,067
- SO IS THIS, UH...

537
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:10,834
SOMETHING WE SHOULD
TALK ABOUT?

538
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:13,200
WHATEVER'S GOING ON
BETWEEN US?

539
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,234
- NO.
- I MEAN...

540
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:16,133
WE HAVE SEX ONE DAY,
AND THEN--

541
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,300
- I'M SORRY,
I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON

542
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,734
WHO WOULD EVER
HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

543
00:27:18,734 --> 00:27:19,734
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

544
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:20,901
- WE'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

545
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:22,234
WE NEVER DID DO ANYTHING.

546
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:23,534
WE NEVER WILL
DO ANYTHING.

547
00:27:23,534 --> 00:27:25,067
- SO WE NEVER HAD SEX?
- EXACTLY.

548
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,067
- THAT'S REALLY WEIRD.

549
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,133
'CAUSE I REMEMBER--

550
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:29,267
- I GOTTA GO NOW.
I'M GONNA GO.

551
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,033
- [scoffs]
[door closes]

552
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,334
- HOW'S IT GOING?

553
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:42,334
- I HATE THIS SHIT.

554
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:45,868
[clatter]

555
00:27:45,868 --> 00:27:47,934
[grunts]

556
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,534
THIS IS DEXTER'S JOB.

557
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,133
BLOOD. IT'S GROSS.

558
00:27:52,968 --> 00:27:54,501
WELL, WHOEVER
CUT THE HEAD OFF

559
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,634
USED THE SAME WEAPON TO CUT
THE EYES AND THE TONGUE OUT.

560
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,767
BUT I CAN'T FIND
ANYTHING THAT FITS.

561
00:27:58,767 --> 00:28:00,968
I MEAN, I'VE TRIED TWO SWORDS,
THREE KNIVES.

562
00:28:00,968 --> 00:28:02,601
- HEY...TRY THE MACHETE.

563
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,501
YEAH.

564
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,801
- HUH.

565
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:25,434
I THINK WE HAVE A MATCH.

566
00:28:27,834 --> 00:28:29,868
- I'LL SEND SOMEBODY
OVER THERE RIGHT AWAY.

567
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:30,868
OKAY, YEAH.

568
00:28:38,267 --> 00:28:40,334
HOW'S IT GOING IN THERE?

569
00:28:40,334 --> 00:28:43,400
- MASUKA SAID HE REALLY
LIKES WORKING WITH THE BLOOD.

570
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,400
HE HOPES HE CAN GET
MORE ASSIGNMENTS LIKE THIS.

571
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
- I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

572
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,300
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

573
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,400
- IF YOU WERE MARRIED...

574
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,667
AND YOU FOUND OUT

575
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:52,067
THAT THE PERSON
YOU WERE MARRIED TO

576
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,367
HAD A SECRET BANK ACCOUNT

577
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,000
WITH A LOT OF MONEY,

578
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,467
YOU THINK THAT PERSON
SHOULD SHARE IT?

579
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:57,934
- JESUS, ANGEL.

580
00:28:57,934 --> 00:28:59,501
JUST BECAUSE YOU MARRIED HER
DOESN'T MEAN YOU OWN HER.

581
00:28:59,501 --> 00:29:02,634
IT'S HER MONEY.
END OF STORY.

582
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:05,300
- WELL, YOU GOT A DEAD BODY
WAITING FOR YOU.

583
00:29:07,567 --> 00:29:11,167
[indistinct chatter]

584
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,734
- OH, FUCK ME.

585
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:16,400
WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE
JUST HANGED HIMSELF,

586
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,434
TOOK SOME PILLS...

587
00:29:17,434 --> 00:29:19,067
STUCK HIS HEAD IN THE OVEN?

588
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:21,067
PEOPLE ARE SO RUDE.
EXCUSE ME.

589
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:22,434
- YOU AGAIN.

590
00:29:22,434 --> 00:29:23,901
- IT'S MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

591
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:25,968
- YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT THE MACHETE.

592
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:28,400
- GOOD...I GUESS.

593
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,100
[camera shutter clicking]

594
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,400
- SO WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

595
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,567
- WELL, GOLLY GEE, DEB,

596
00:29:32,567 --> 00:29:34,334
I THINK WE GOT
A SHOTGUN WOUND TO THE HEAD.

597
00:29:34,334 --> 00:29:36,701
APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS AGO.

598
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,234
- MAKE SURE
YOU SWAB THE GUN.

599
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,968
AND CHECK HIS HANDS FOR GSR.

600
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,400
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT.
- I'M JUST CHECKING.

601
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,968
DEXTER USUALLY
WORKS CASES LIKE THIS.

602
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:44,100
DO WE HAVE AN I.D.?

603
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,133
- ACCORDING TO THIS,
FRANCISCO ALFARO.

604
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,567
HEY, CAN WE ROLL HIM OVER?

605
00:29:49,167 --> 00:29:51,901
- [sighs]

606
00:29:51,901 --> 00:29:54,133
OH, LOOKS LIKE HIS FACE
HAS CHANGED A LITTLE

607
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,033
SINCE HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE
PICTURE WAS TAKEN.

608
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,601
- LOOKS LIKE HIM.

609
00:30:01,601 --> 00:30:04,167
HEY...CHECK OUT THE GIRL.

610
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:05,601
- WHAT?
- LOOK AT HER.

611
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:07,901
IMAGINE SHE HAS NO EYES
AND NO TONGUE.

612
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:09,567
- HOLY SHIT.
- IT'S HER, ISN'T IT?

613
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:10,834
- THOSE ARE THE EXACT
SAME EARRINGS.

614
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:12,968
WE'VE GOT OUR HEAD.

615
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:14,234
- UH-HUH.

616
00:30:14,234 --> 00:30:16,267
BINGO--LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
A MURDER-SUICIDE HERE.

617
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:17,934
- HOW YOU FIGURE?
- WELL...

618
00:30:17,934 --> 00:30:20,000
GUY GETS PISSED AT HIS WIFE.
CUTS HER HEAD OFF.

619
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
LEAVES IT IN THE PARK
FOR EVERYONE TO SEE

620
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,300
AND COMES HOME,
BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

621
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,000
- MASUKA, WE GOT SOME
BRAIN GOO ON THE CEILING

622
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,367
YOU NEED TO PHOTOGRAPH.

623
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,067
- OH, FUCK ME
UP THE GOAT ASS.

624
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:32,968
- WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT
SANTA MUERTE STUFF THEN?

625
00:30:32,968 --> 00:30:35,100
- YEAH...THERE IS
NO SANTA MUERTE STUFF.

626
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,968
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
THERE WAS AT THE PARK.

627
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,300
THERE WAS, UH, MISSING EYES
AND A TONGUE

628
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,000
AND THE GOLD CANDLES
AND THE ICONS.

629
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,267
THERE'S NONE OF THAT HERE.
- NO.

630
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:45,300
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

631
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,968
- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

632
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:48,300
- WHO'S SHE?

633
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,267
- [sighs]

634
00:30:53,267 --> 00:30:55,567
HEY...WHEN IS DEXTER
COMING BACK?

635
00:31:01,434 --> 00:31:04,067
- BOYD FOWLER WORKS
THE 7:00 TO 4:00 SHIFT...

636
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:06,434
WHICH GIVES ME TIME
TO CHECK OUT HIS HOUSE,

637
00:31:06,434 --> 00:31:11,267
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT'LL PUT HIM ON MY TABLE.

638
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:13,400
- LET ME GUESS.

639
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,334
THIS IS YOU PUTTING ON
YOUR OXYGEN MASK FIRST.

640
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:19,133
- BEING ON THE HUNT
KEEPS ME SHARP.

641
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,000
FOCUSED.

642
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,434
THUS, THE BETTER
KILLER I AM,

643
00:31:22,434 --> 00:31:23,834
THE BETTER FATHER.

644
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,801
[flies buzzing]

645
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:55,901
- SO HE TAKES HIS WORK
HOME WITH HIM.

646
00:31:55,901 --> 00:31:56,968
NO CRIME IN THAT.

647
00:32:09,234 --> 00:32:10,901
A MAN OF SIMPLE TASTE.

648
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:16,133
LOOKS LIKE
MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.

649
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,501
A LOADED HANDGUN.

650
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:23,100
A NO-NO
FOR A CONVICTED FELON.

651
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,868
BUT EVEN SO,
NOT MUCH TO GO ON.

652
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:29,267
BOYD, YOU ARE VERY BORING.

653
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:35,868
[whispers] SHIT.

654
00:32:37,334 --> 00:32:39,400
BOYD COMES HOME FOR LUNCH.

655
00:32:42,467 --> 00:32:44,234
OKAY, THAT'S INTERESTING.

656
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:46,000
[door latch clicks]

657
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:53,567
- [voice on CD] DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE?

658
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,601
YOU HAVE THAT POWER.

659
00:32:57,601 --> 00:33:00,667
YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO USE IT.

660
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,968
YOU CAN MAKE UP
ALL THE EXCUSES YOU WANT.

661
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:05,334
YOU'RE TOO TIRED.

662
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:07,601
- WHO KEEPS THEIR ATTIC DOOR
LOCKED?

663
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:11,367
- TOO OLD.
TOO FAT.

664
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,000
TOO STUPID.

665
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,968
[chuckles] YOU KNOW,
I'VE HEARD THEM ALL.

666
00:33:14,968 --> 00:33:16,667
- CHICKEN NOODLE,
CHICKEN NOODLE, CHICKEN NOODLE.

667
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:18,300
WHERE'S THE TOMATO?

668
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,501
BUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING...

669
00:33:19,501 --> 00:33:22,567
both: TAKE IT!

670
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,701
- YOU WANT THAT JOB?

671
00:33:24,701 --> 00:33:27,000
both: WELL, THEN, TAKE IT!

672
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,501
- IT'S ENTIRELY UP TO YOU.

673
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:32,434
THE WORLD DOES NOT PUT ONE...
[cans clattering]

674
00:33:32,434 --> 00:33:34,868
YOU WANT THAT NICE HOUSE
ON THE BEACH?

675
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:37,434
both: TAKE IT!

676
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:38,968
- THE WORLD
DOES NOT PUT LIMITATIONS

677
00:33:38,968 --> 00:33:40,634
ON WHAT YOU CAN HAVE.

678
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:42,501
BUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING...

679
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:43,734
both: TAKE IT!

680
00:33:43,734 --> 00:33:45,467
- YOU HAVE THAT POWER.

681
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:46,567
- I CAN SEE HAVING

682
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:50,300
AN OLD GIRLFRIEND'S
LOCK OF HAIR...

683
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,300
BUT IDENTIFIED
ONLY BY A NUMBER?

684
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,567
- WE ARE OUR OWN WORST ENEMY.

685
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,234
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.

686
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:59,067
BUT WITH
A FEW SIMPLE STEPS,

687
00:33:59,067 --> 00:34:02,701
I CAN TEACH YOU HOW TO TAKE
CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE.

688
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:04,267
TAKE IT!

689
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:05,968
- ALL I'M SAYING...

690
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:07,601
IF A WOMAN
PISSED ME OFF ENOUGH,

691
00:34:07,601 --> 00:34:09,300
YEAH, I'D WANNA
CUT HER HEAD OFF.

692
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,434
- WELL,
THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR.

693
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:12,567
- NO, I'M NOT SAYING
I WOULD DO IT.

694
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,667
BUT I UNDERSTAND THE IMPULSE.

695
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,167
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

696
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,400
- I TOLD DEXTER I'D
CHECK THIS PLACE OUT FOR HIM.

697
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,267
- OH! COME IN, COME IN.

698
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:24,501
- HEY.
- HI!

699
00:34:24,501 --> 00:34:26,434
UM, WE'VE JUST PAINTED

700
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:28,567
AND INSTALLED NEW FLOORING
THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE.

701
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,267
- LOOKS GREAT.
- [squeals]

702
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:32,234
LOTS OF YOUNG COUPLES
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

703
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:34,934
AND THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
IS ABOUT THREE BLOCKS AWAY.

704
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:37,834
I'M SURE YOU'D BE
VERY HAPPY HERE.

705
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:39,100
- OH, IT'S NOT FOR US.

706
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,634
- I THINK WE'D BE
VERY HAPPY HERE TOO.

707
00:34:41,634 --> 00:34:43,434
THANK YOU.

708
00:34:43,434 --> 00:34:45,834
- WELL, I HAVE TO GET
A FEW THINGS OUT OF MY CAR.

709
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:47,400
BUT IF YOU
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

710
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,834
I'LL JUST BE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

711
00:34:48,834 --> 00:34:49,767
- OKAY.
- THANK YOU.

712
00:34:52,601 --> 00:34:55,467
- IT'S A NICE KITCHEN.
- UH-HUH.

713
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:58,734
- DECENT APPLIANCES.
- UH-HUH.

714
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:01,067
- OH, LOOK AT THIS.

715
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:03,567
GREAT BEDROOM.
CHECK IT OUT.

716
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:04,901
- DON'T.

717
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:06,634
- OHH.

718
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:09,634
WOW.

719
00:35:09,634 --> 00:35:11,334
COMFY BED.

720
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:13,267
FEEL IT.

721
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:14,400
- GET OFF THE BED.

722
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,434
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
A LITTLE NAP TIME?

723
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:18,434
- I'M LEAVING.
- WHAT DID I DO?

724
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:20,000
- I'VE GOT TO DROP YOU OFF
AT THE STATION,

725
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
THEN PICK UP
MY BROTHER'S KIDS.

726
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:27,901
- HOW DESPERATE AM I
TO FOLLOW BOYD

727
00:35:27,901 --> 00:35:29,667
TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
WHEN ALL I'VE GOT

728
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:31,667
IS A BIT OF BLOOD
AND A LOCK OF HAIR?

729
00:35:41,968 --> 00:35:44,501
BUT WITH NOTHING ELSE
TO GO ON...

730
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:04,968
IT'S A RULE OF NATURE.

731
00:36:04,968 --> 00:36:07,701
LEAVE SOME OLD BEDSPRINGS
OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,

732
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,868
AND SOON, IT'LL BE JOINED
BY A REFRIGERATOR,

733
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:13,934
COUCH, CAR ENGINE.

734
00:36:13,934 --> 00:36:17,667
AND NOW, A BARREL, MOST LIKELY
HOLDING DEAD ANIMALS.

735
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:20,000
TOO LAZY TO DRIVE IT BACK
TO THE INCINERATOR, I SUPPOSE.

736
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,901
[cell phone ringing]

737
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:23,968
HEY, DEB.

738
00:36:23,968 --> 00:36:25,067
- DO YOU HAVE THE KIDS?

739
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,033
- HARRISON'S
WITH BILL AND MAURA,

740
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:29,868
AND...ASTOR AND CODY
ARE...WITH YOU?

741
00:36:29,868 --> 00:36:31,634
- SHIT.

742
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:32,767
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

743
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:34,734
- DID YOU DROP THEM OFF
AT SCHOOL THIS MORNING?

744
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,801
- YEAH, THEY WERE
SEEING THE COUNSELOR FIRST,

745
00:36:36,801 --> 00:36:38,667
AND THEN THEY WERE GOING
TO THEIR REGULAR CLASSES.

746
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:40,133
- WELL, I JUST WENT
TO GO PICK THEM UP,

747
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,167
AND THE WOMAN IN THE OFFICE SAID
THAT THEY NEVER WENT TO CLASS.

748
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:45,000
SO I CALLED THE APARTMENT,
AND THERE'S NO ANSWER.

749
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,667
- WELL, WHERE ARE THEY?

750
00:36:46,667 --> 00:36:47,968
- THAT'S MY QUESTION,
BIG BROTHER.

751
00:36:47,968 --> 00:36:49,234
WHERE WOULD THEY GO?

752
00:36:49,234 --> 00:36:51,734
- SAME PLACE ASTOR
KEEPS SAYING SHE WANTS TO GO.

753
00:36:53,868 --> 00:36:55,734
[bird cawing]

754
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:57,300
ASTOR.

755
00:36:58,901 --> 00:37:00,767
CODY.

756
00:37:11,234 --> 00:37:12,167
HEY.

757
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,267
HOW'D YOU GUYS GET HERE?

758
00:37:17,267 --> 00:37:19,534
- WE WALKED.

759
00:37:19,534 --> 00:37:22,100
DON'T BE MAD, DEXTER.

760
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,200
- THEY WANTED
TO SEE WHERE IT HAPPENED.

761
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,667
WHERE THEY LOST THEIR MOTHER.

762
00:37:26,667 --> 00:37:30,100
I'M NOT MAD.

763
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,334
ASTOR, I'M SORRY.

764
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:32,667
I SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO YOU.

765
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,534
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT
YOU BACK HERE LIKE YOU ASKED.

766
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,033
IF YOU WANT TO MOVE BACK HERE,
THEN WE WILL.

767
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:40,133
WE'LL FIND A WAY
TO MAKE IT WORK.

768
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,567
- NO, WE WON'T.

769
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,767
- ASTOR, I'M SORRY.

770
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,367
- YOU KEEP SAYING THAT,
BUT I DON'T CARE.

771
00:37:52,367 --> 00:37:53,934
YOU RUINED EVERYTHING.

772
00:37:53,934 --> 00:37:56,200
WE'D GOTTEN USED TO IT.
IT WASN'T THAT BAD!

773
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,234
- USED TO WHAT?

774
00:37:57,234 --> 00:37:59,267
- TO THE WAY THINGS WERE!

775
00:37:59,267 --> 00:38:00,901
BEFORE YOU!
WITHOUT A DAD!

776
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:02,033
- OH.

777
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:03,167
- AND THEN YOU COME ALONG

778
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,634
AND BECOME
A PART OF THE FAMILY,

779
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:06,834
AND WE THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING
WAS GONNA BE GOOD FOREVER.

780
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:12,067
YOU MADE US THINK THAT!

781
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:14,400
AND IT'S NOT TRUE.

782
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,000
THINGS GOT WORSE.

783
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,601
AND NOW EVERY TIME
I LOOK AT YOU, I GET SO ANGRY,

784
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:23,434
BECAUSE IT WAS
ALL JUST A LIE.

785
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:26,567
- [crying]
IT'S NOT DEXTER'S FAULT.

786
00:38:26,567 --> 00:38:28,334
- [sighs]

787
00:38:28,334 --> 00:38:31,334
I THOUGHT COMING HERE
WOULD HELP.

788
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:34,634
BUT THAT WAS STUPID.

789
00:38:34,634 --> 00:38:37,634
- NO, I UNDERSTAND.

790
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:40,501
- IT LOOKS EXACTLY
THE SAME AS BEFORE.

791
00:38:43,567 --> 00:38:46,100
- IT DOES.

792
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,901
- YOU CAN'T EVEN
TELL WHAT HAPPENED.

793
00:38:49,901 --> 00:38:52,300
BUT I KNOW MY MOM DIED THERE.

794
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,200
AND THINGS WILL NEVER
BE THE SAME.

795
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,534
- [crying]
I MISS HER SO MUCH.

796
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:56,701
- I DO TOO.

797
00:38:58,434 --> 00:39:00,667
- WE ALL DO.

798
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:02,534
- I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE WITH YOU.

799
00:39:02,534 --> 00:39:04,334
[crying] I WANT TO LIVE
WITH GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

800
00:39:04,334 --> 00:39:05,667
I WANT TO GO BACK
WITH THEM TONIGHT.

801
00:39:05,667 --> 00:39:06,767
RIGHT NOW!

802
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:26,701
- HEY.
I'M, UH, HEADING OUT.

803
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:27,734
YOU WANT TO GRAB
A BITE SOMEWHERE?

804
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:29,200
- NO, WHY WOULD I
WANNA DO THAT?

805
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,968
- ALL RIGHT.

806
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:32,334
[bell dings]

807
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:37,367
- HEY, LIEUTENANT.

808
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:39,667
DEB TOLD ME ABOUT
THE KYLE BUTLER SKETCHES.

809
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,100
- YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT SURE
HOW USEFUL THEY'LL BE.

810
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,167
THE MOTHER AND TWO CHILDREN

811
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:47,067
ALL GAVE VERY DIFFERENT
VERSIONS.

812
00:39:47,067 --> 00:39:48,534
- HUH.
- IT'S THEIR BIGGEST LEAD.

813
00:39:48,534 --> 00:39:51,000
SEEMS TO BE GOING NOWHERE.

814
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,734
- DO YOU MIND IF I KEEP
A COPY OF THESE?

815
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:54,200
- NO, I GOT PLENTY.

816
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:58,434
[ding]

817
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:03,467
- ANGEL.

818
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:06,300
- LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

819
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,167
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU KEPT THIS MUCH MONEY

820
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:11,334
A SECRET FROM ME?

821
00:40:11,334 --> 00:40:13,133
- [scoffs]

822
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:15,601
IT WAS NEVER A SECRET.

823
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:17,067
THAT'S MY RETIREMENT FUND.

824
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:18,267
- WELL, NOW
THAT WE'RE MARRIED,

825
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:19,334
AREN'T WE SUPPOSED
TO SHARE EVERYTHING?

826
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,934
- I DON'T THINK
WE EVER DISCUSSED THAT.

827
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:22,133
- THEN MAYBE
WE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS

828
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:23,968
ABOUT WHAT A MARRIAGE
SHOULD BE.

829
00:40:23,968 --> 00:40:27,534
BECAUSE I ALWAYS PICTURED
YOU AND I AT 80 YEARS OLD,

830
00:40:27,534 --> 00:40:29,968
WALKING DOWN THE BEACH,
HAND IN HAND.

831
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:34,300
- I LIKE TO PICTURE THAT
AS WELL, ANGEL.

832
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,400
I LOVE YOU.

833
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,167
BUT I THINK MAYBE
I HAVE MORE OF A...

834
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:40,601
PRACTICAL SIDE THAN YOU DO.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

835
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:42,534
- I MEAN I'VE WORKED
MY ENTIRE CAREER

836
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:44,467
TO SAVE UP,
TO PROTECT MYSELF,

837
00:40:44,467 --> 00:40:46,634
AND YOU LIVE EVERY DAY
LIKE IT'S A PARTY.

838
00:40:46,634 --> 00:40:49,200
IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
I LIKE ABOUT YOU,

839
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,267
BUT IT ALSO MEANS
THAT YOU SPEND MONEY

840
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:52,467
FASTER THAN
YOU EVEN MAKE IT.

841
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:54,033
- OKAY!
- AND IT'S, I'M--

842
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:57,300
- OKAY, I GET IT.

843
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,000
- I DON'T MEAN TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS.

844
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,801
- NO, I'M FINE.

845
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:01,868
I'M IRRESPONSIBLE.

846
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:02,968
- OH, MARIA.

847
00:41:02,968 --> 00:41:04,100
- EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

848
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:07,300
- [sighs]

849
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,868
- HEY, EVERYONE!

850
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,000
DRINKS ON ME.

851
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,367
TONIGHT.

852
00:41:13,367 --> 00:41:14,767
- YEAH! ANGEL!
- [whistling]

853
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,300
- THAT'S WHAT I'M
TALKIN' 'BOUT.

854
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,968
- ANGEL.

855
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:21,634
- HEY.

856
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:28,200
SO EVERYONE'S HOME SAFE?

857
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,767
- YEAH, THEY'RE ALL INSIDE.

858
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,834
- YOU THINK THEY'RE FINALLY
SETTLING IN?

859
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:38,701
- [scoffs]

860
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:39,834
THEY'RE PACKING.

861
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:43,000
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

862
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,601
- ASTOR AND CODY ARE...
LEAVING.

863
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:48,234
SOON AS THEIR GRANDPARENTS
GET HERE,

864
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:50,868
THEY'RE GOING BACK TO ORLANDO
WITH THEM.

865
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,167
- DEX, I'M SO SORRY.

866
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:00,868
FOR HOW LONG?

867
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:03,400
- I DON'T KNOW.

868
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,100
- WELL, MAYBE
IF I TALK TO ASTOR--

869
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,000
- I ALREADY TRIED.

870
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,501
- AND CODY WANTS TO GO TOO?

871
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:13,601
- NO, HE WANTS TO STAY.

872
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:16,400
IT GOT...VERY UPSETTING.

873
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,200
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

874
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,234
- I REMINDED HIM THAT YOU AND I
ARE BROTHER AND SISTER,

875
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:23,334
JUST LIKE HIM AND ASTOR,

876
00:42:23,334 --> 00:42:24,901
AND THAT IT'S...

877
00:42:24,901 --> 00:42:27,968
IMPORTANT THAT THEY
NEVER SPLIT UP.

878
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,000
- ALL THE SHIT
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH.

879
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,067
[laughs nervously]

880
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:39,701
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
MADE IT THROUGH WITHOUT YOU.

881
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:46,167
- THAT'S WHAT I TRIED
TO TELL HIM.

882
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,300
- DID IT HELP?

883
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,033
- NOT REALLY.

884
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:57,167
I REALLY WAS TRYING...

885
00:42:57,167 --> 00:42:59,100
TO MAKE IT WORK.

886
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,667
IN MY OWN WAY.

887
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:03,901
- YEAH, I KNOW YOU WERE.

888
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:09,434
- [sighs]

889
00:43:09,434 --> 00:43:11,968
I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO FACE REALITY.

890
00:43:29,968 --> 00:43:31,501
- REALITY.

891
00:43:31,501 --> 00:43:33,701
[cell phone vibrating]

892
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:37,367
- QUINN.

893
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:39,133
- OKAY, WE HAD SEX.

894
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,634
- [chuckles]

895
00:43:40,634 --> 00:43:42,334
WAS IT GOOD SEX?

896
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:45,167
- I'VE SAID ALL I'M GONNA SAY.

897
00:43:45,167 --> 00:43:47,067
- ARE WE GONNA HAVE MORE SEX?

898
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:48,100
- GOOD-BYE.

899
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,100
- COME ON.

900
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,434
HELP ME OUT HERE.

901
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:53,167
- I'M HANGING UP NOW.

902
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,033
[beep]

903
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:09,601
[chatter and music]

904
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:11,267
- SHE WANTS TO LIVE HER LIFE

905
00:44:11,267 --> 00:44:12,901
STASHING AWAY
ALL HER LITTLE PENNIES,

906
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,300
THAT'S--THAT'S HER PROBLEM.

907
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,067
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

908
00:44:17,067 --> 00:44:19,167
YOU KNOW?

909
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:20,868
YOU WANT ANOTHER DRINK?

910
00:44:20,868 --> 00:44:22,367
- YOU BUYING, RIGHT?

911
00:44:22,367 --> 00:44:24,834
- BARTENDER, A CUERVO SILVER.

912
00:44:24,834 --> 00:44:28,000
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
MONEY SHE'S GOT? IT'S SICK.

913
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,834
DID SHE TELL ME?
DID SHE TELL ME?

914
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,033
CHEERS.

915
00:44:35,033 --> 00:44:36,167
- ANGEL.

916
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:42,167
IT TRUE YOU MARRIED
MARIA LAGUERTA?

917
00:44:42,167 --> 00:44:43,300
- I DID INDEED.

918
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,100
- [laughs]
 <i>CABRON!</i>

919
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,767
YOU GOT YOURSELF
A LITTLE SUGAR MAMA.

920
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,267
- WHAT?
- OH, YEAH.

921
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:54,667
I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS
FIRST STARTING OUT.

922
00:44:54,667 --> 00:44:56,133
SUCH A FINE PIECE OF ASS.

923
00:44:56,133 --> 00:44:57,667
- I THINK YOU NEED TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

924
00:44:57,667 --> 00:44:58,667
- [laughs]

925
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:01,167
[speaking Spanish]

926
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:02,167
- YOU FUCK!
[laughing]

927
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,434
UHH!

928
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,634
- UHH!

929
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:06,033
- AAH!

930
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:09,033
[music growing louder]

931
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:16,968
* *

932
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:21,667
[crickets chirping]

933
00:45:24,234 --> 00:45:26,467
- IF THEY NEED ANYTHING,
JUST LET ME KNOW; I'LL SEND IT.

934
00:45:26,467 --> 00:45:27,934
- WE WILL.
THANK YOU.

935
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:34,734
- I LOST MY INNOCENCE
AT SUCH AN EARLY AGE,

936
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:37,200
AND IT LEFT
A VERY DAMAGING MARK.

937
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,200
- [crying softly]

938
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,100
CAN'T I STAY
WITH YOU, DEXTER?

939
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:47,367
- FOR NOW, YOU NEED
TO GO WITH YOUR GRANDPARENTS.

940
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:49,434
DON'T WORRY, WE'LL STILL
SEE EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME.

941
00:45:49,434 --> 00:45:51,400
ORLANDO'S NOT SO FAR.

942
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,901
- [sniffles]

943
00:45:52,901 --> 00:45:54,567
YES, IT IS.

944
00:45:54,567 --> 00:45:55,801
- ANY SHRINK COULD TELL YOU

945
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:57,267
THAT'S WHY I'VE ALWAYS
LIKED CHILDREN.

946
00:45:57,267 --> 00:46:01,634
BECAUSE THEY CONNECT ME
TO WHAT I CAN NEVER GET BACK.

947
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:03,968
- I DON'T WANT TO GO, DEXTER.

948
00:46:06,868 --> 00:46:08,234
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO GO.

949
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:22,100
ASTOR...

950
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,968
- WHAT?

951
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,467
- YOUR MOTHER LOVED YOU MORE
THAN YOU COULD EVER IMAGINE.

952
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:34,234
AND I...

953
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,667
ME TOO.

954
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:53,667
[engine starts]

955
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,834
CODY AND ASTOR SHOWED ME

956
00:47:09,834 --> 00:47:13,133
THAT I CAN STILL CARE
ABOUT SOMETHING.

957
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,234
THAT MAKES LETTING THEM GO
ALL THAT MUCH HARDER.

958
00:47:31,067 --> 00:47:32,868
AND IT'S LOSING THEM
THAT MAKES ME REALIZE

959
00:47:32,868 --> 00:47:35,701
THERE MUST BE SOME SMALL PART
OF THAT INNOCENT CHILD

960
00:47:35,701 --> 00:47:38,734
STILL INSIDE ME.

961
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,133
[scissors snip]

962
00:47:46,067 --> 00:47:47,534
BECAUSE, JUST LIKE ASTOR,

963
00:47:47,534 --> 00:47:49,033
I WAS FOOLISH ENOUGH
TO THINK THAT THINGS

964
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:52,033
WOULD ALWAYS BE GOOD.

965
00:47:52,033 --> 00:47:53,167
BUT THEY'RE NOT.

966
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:05,634
THEY'RE WORSE.

967
00:48:12,033 --> 00:48:15,400
[sizzling]

968
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,200
MUCH WORSE.

969
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:21,667
NORMALLY, HAVING A TARGET
WOULD MAKE ME FEEL GOOD,

970
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:24,501
GIVE ME DIRECTION,
A SENSE OF PURPOSE.

971
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,834
BUT NOW...

972
00:48:30,534 --> 00:48:32,834
IT MEANS NOTHING.

973
00:48:32,834 --> 00:48:36,601
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOING TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

974
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,834
- SHOULD WE GO HOME?

975
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:43,000
- GIVE ME A MINUTE.
