1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:09,634
- PREVIOUSLY ON <i>DEXTER...</i>

2
00:00:09,634 --> 00:00:11,300
- WE ARE GOING TO...

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,801
all: TAKE IT!

4
00:00:12,801 --> 00:00:16,000
- COLE HARMON,
CHASE'S CHIEF OF SECURITY--

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,033
TORTURER, RAPIST, KILLER.

6
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:20,534
IT'S TIME TO TAP INTO
MY PRIMAL SELF.

7
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:21,734
WHY DID YOU WANT TO SEE ME?

8
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:23,434
- I AM VERY INTERESTED
IN WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

9
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:25,634
I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS
YOUR SITUATION IN-DEPTH

10
00:00:25,634 --> 00:00:26,834
AT ANOTHER TIME.

11
00:00:26,834 --> 00:00:28,801
- OUR INFORMANT,
YASMIN ARAGON,

12
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,901
WAS SHOT AND KILLED.

13
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:31,667
- THIS IS A FUCKING DISASTER!

14
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:32,734
- IF MISTAKES WERE MADE,

15
00:00:32,734 --> 00:00:34,267
THEY MOST CERTAINLY
WERE NOT MINE.

16
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,067
- I CAN CONFIRM
THAT DETECTIVE MORGAN

17
00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:37,667
WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE OPERATION.

18
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,434
AS OF TODAY,
SHE'S BEING PLACED

19
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:41,434
ON IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION
WITH PAY.

20
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:43,334
- IT'S JUST YOUR WORD
AGAINST MINE.

21
00:00:43,334 --> 00:00:46,400
- SOME PEOPLE DON'T AGREE
WITH YOUR VERSION OF THE EVENTS.

22
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,501
- WHO DID YOU GET
TO LIE FOR YOU?

23
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,734
IT WAS YOU.

24
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:52,033
- DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS GIRL

25
00:00:52,033 --> 00:00:53,434
SHACKED UP
WITH DEXTER MORGAN?

26
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:55,801
NAME: LUMEN PIERCE.

27
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:58,634
LUMEN SHOWS UP HERE
IN MIAMI ONE WEEK

28
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:02,567
BEFORE YOUR BOY'S WIFE,
RITA MORGAN, IS MURDERED.

29
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,434
- AAH!

30
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:06,133
- YOU FUCKIN' BITCH!

31
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,167
[grunting]

32
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,300
- WHO ARE THE OTHERS?

33
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,934
- THE GUY WHO HELD A WATCH
UP TO MY EAR.

34
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:13,434
TICK-TICK-TICK.

35
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,701
"THAT'S THE SOUND
OF YOUR LIFE RUNNING OUT."

36
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:17,834
- [muffled scream]

37
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:21,267
- IT'S WHAT I TELL MY CLIENTS.

38
00:01:21,267 --> 00:01:22,601
TICK-TICK-TICK.

39
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:25,701
THAT'S THE SOUND
OF YOUR LIFE RUNNING OUT.

40
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:27,300
- JORDAN CHASE IS ONE OF THEM.

41
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,534
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE DOWN
JORDAN CHASE?

42
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,501
[camera shutter clicks]

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
[quirky music]

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:52,133
* *

45
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,334
- ON A GOOD DAY,
WHEN I RUN,

46
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:33,501
THE VOICES IN MY HEAD
GET QUIETER

47
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,534
UNTIL IT'S JUST ME,
MY BREATH,

48
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:38,501
AND MY FEET ON THE SAND.

49
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,467
- PICK UP THE PACE, DEXTER.

50
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:49,801
- TODAY IS NOT
ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

51
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:52,501
WHEN I SCHEDULED A PRIVATE
SESSION WITH JORDAN CHASE,

52
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,834
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR ADVICE.
JUST PROOF.

53
00:03:55,834 --> 00:03:59,100
EVIDENCE OF EXACTLY HOW HE WAS
INVOLVED IN LUMEN'S TORTURE,

54
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,868
BECAUSE THE CODE
REQUIRES CERTAINTY.

55
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,000
- FASTER, DEX.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,033
- I JUST WANTED ACCESS
TO HIS OFFICE,

57
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,934
THE INNER SANCTUM
WHERE I COULD FIND CLUES.

58
00:04:07,934 --> 00:04:10,400
INSTEAD, I'M STUCK HERE,

59
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,767
RUNNING IN PLACE.

60
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:15,367
- LOOK, I GET IT.
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED.

61
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,701
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT GETTING
WHAT YOU CAME HERE FOR.

62
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,601
- YEAH, A BIT.

63
00:04:19,601 --> 00:04:21,300
- INTENSE EXERCISE WORKS.

64
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,467
TEARS DOWN YOUR DEFENSES,
BRINGS OUT YOUR FEELINGS.

65
00:04:25,467 --> 00:04:27,734
- WELL, I HAVE THE FEELING
THAT I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE

66
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:29,100
TALKING ON A COUCH.

67
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,734
[both panting]

68
00:04:32,734 --> 00:04:36,000
- TRUST ME, THIS IS THE WAY
TO BUILD A NEW YOU.

69
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:41,067
AT THE SEMINAR,
WE WENT OVER HOW

70
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:43,133
TRAGEDY FRACTURES US, RIGHT?

71
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:44,167
- YEAH.

72
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,467
WE'RE LIKE HUMPTY DUMPTY.

73
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:47,567
AND THE BIG FALL.

74
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:48,868
- WHAT I'M TELLING YOU NOW

75
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:52,501
IS TRAUMA
IS ALSO OPPORTUNITY.

76
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:55,200
TRAGEDY TEARS US APART, SURE.

77
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,801
BUT IT'S YOUR ONE CHANCE
TO RECREATE YOURSELF.

78
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:59,400
YOU GET TO PUT YOURSELF
BACK TOGETHER AGAIN

79
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,501
ANY WAY YOU WANT.

80
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,834
- [slight chuckle]
OKAY.

81
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:04,934
- DON'T BE SKEPTICAL.
I KNOW IT FOR A FACT.

82
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,901
- HOW?
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

83
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:09,767
- YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT ME.

84
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,334
- SOMETHING BIG
MUST HAVE HAPPENED

85
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,267
IF IT INSPIRED
YOUR ENTIRE PHILOSOPHY.

86
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,434
- OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU
WHERE IT STARTED

87
00:05:19,434 --> 00:05:21,067
IF YOU PROMISE
TO KEEP IT BETWEEN US.

88
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,100
- PLATO.

89
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,934
- WHAT?

90
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:28,767
- THE NOTION
OF A FRACTURED SELF.

91
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,834
IT'S FROM PLATO'S <i>SYMPOSIUM.</i>
YOU EVER READ IT?

92
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:33,167
- MAYBE IN COLLEGE.

93
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:34,501
- BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT,
RIGHT?

94
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,868
MOST PEOPLE DON'T.

95
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,100
BUT FOR ME,
IT WAS A REVELATION.

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,167
IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT
I NEEDED AT THE TIME.

97
00:05:40,167 --> 00:05:43,634
SO...I TOOK IT.

98
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,167
I TOOK PLATO'S IDEA
THAT WE ARE FRACTURED CREATURES,

99
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:48,567
TRYING TO BECOME WHOLE,
AND I RAN WITH IT.

100
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,667
BOOM, A MILLION COPIES SOLD.

101
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:57,567
SO...NOW YOU KNOW MY SECRET.

102
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,133
YOU READY
TO TELL ME YOURS?

103
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,834
- OVER YOUR DEAD BODY.

104
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,267
AN HOUR ON THE TREADMILL,
AND I CAME UP EMPTY.

105
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,133
NOT A CLUE.

106
00:06:09,133 --> 00:06:12,100
ONLY UPSIDE IS I GOT IN
MY CARDIO FOR THE DAY.

107
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,400
JORDAN IS ONE TOUGH NUT
TO CRACK.

108
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,200
- YOU'RE ONE TOUGH NUT TO CRACK,
YOU KNOW THAT, DEXTER?

109
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,634
- I WISH
HE'D STOP DOING THAT.

110
00:06:18,634 --> 00:06:21,934
- WE RAN FOR AN HOUR.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP ANYTHING.

111
00:06:21,934 --> 00:06:23,234
I KNOW
YOU'RE IN KILLER SHAPE,

112
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:25,000
BUT YOU CAN'T
OUTRUN ME FOREVER.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,334
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME
SOMETHING TO WORK WITH.

114
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:30,501
OTHERWISE...

115
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,567
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

116
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:33,834
- MAYBE YOU CAN'T.

117
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,868
OR MAYBE YOU CAN.

118
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:37,467
IS THAT BLOOD?

119
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,100
- NO PRESSURE.

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
IT CAN TAKE
SEVERAL MEETINGS

121
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,434
FOR US TO HAVE
A REAL BREAKTHROUGH.

122
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,634
BUT I DO NEED
YOUR COMMITMENT.

123
00:06:46,634 --> 00:06:48,534
- I NEED TO GET MY HANDS
ON THAT VIAL.

124
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:52,000
- OTHERWISE, WE'RE JUST
WASTING OUR TIME.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,901
I REALLY THINK
I CAN HELP YOU, THOUGH.

126
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:56,334
- I THINK SO TOO.

127
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:58,334
WHEN CAN I GET IN
TO SEE YOU AGAIN?

128
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:00,200
- CHECK WITH MY RECEPTIONIST
ON THE WAY OUT.

129
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,434
I THINK I MAY HAVE AN OPENING
TOMORROW MORNING.

130
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:12,234
[keyboard clicking]

131
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,801
- WELL, THAT WAS LUCKY.

132
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:17,601
10:00 A.M. TOMORROW.

133
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:20,234
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS.

134
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:23,200
- PERFECT.
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,300
- I DIDN'T NOTICE YOU LAST TIME.
YOU NEW HERE?

136
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,968
- JUST STARTED THREE DAYS AGO.

137
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:29,634
- I DON'T REMEMBER
SO MUCH SECURITY EITHER.

138
00:07:29,634 --> 00:07:33,067
- MR. CHASE SAYS
HE'S BEEFING THINGS UP.

139
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:35,033
- THAT'S NO SURPRISE.

140
00:07:35,033 --> 00:07:37,267
LUMEN AND I HAVE BEEN
KNOCKING OFF HIS FRIENDS

141
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,267
ONE BY ONE.

142
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,701
- HOW MANY SECURITY GUARDS?

143
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:44,901
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE A DOZEN.

144
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,267
- BUT YOU THINK
THAT YOU CAN STILL

145
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:48,100
GET TO THE BLOOD
NECKLACE THING, RIGHT?

146
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,000
- YEAH. WHILE JORDAN'S
IN THE SHOWER.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,033
- WON'T HE NOTICE
IF IT'S MISSING?

148
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:53,267
- NO, I'M NOT GONNA SWIPE IT.

149
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,267
I'M JUST GONNA EXTRACT
A SAMPLE.

150
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,434
I'LL RUN IT FOR DNA,
HOPEFULLY GET AN I.D.

151
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:59,067
- RUN IT FOR DNA.

152
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,801
GOD, I LOVE THAT
YOU CAN DO THAT.

153
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,968
SO WHOSE BLOOD
DO YOU THINK IT IS?

154
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,934
IF IT IS BLOOD.
- MOST LIKELY A VICTIM.

155
00:08:06,934 --> 00:08:08,634
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

156
00:08:08,634 --> 00:08:10,834
HE'S WEARING IT AROUND HIS NECK.

157
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:12,434
IT'S DEFINITELY
SOME KIND OF TROPHY.

158
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,501
ARE YOU THERE?

159
00:08:17,501 --> 00:08:19,501
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

160
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,667
- THERE'S SOMEONE
AT THE KITCHEN DOOR.

161
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,567
[knob rattles]

162
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,734
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET IN.
- GO OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

163
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:28,734
I'LL BE THERE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

164
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,567
- DEXTER, THERE'S SOMEONE
THERE TOO.

165
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:31,734
- HIDE.

166
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:33,300
- WHERE?
- IN THE BATHROOM.

167
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,968
I'LL GET THERE
AS FAST AS I CAN.

168
00:08:43,934 --> 00:08:45,701
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

169
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:48,067
[hinges creak]

170
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:49,834
[door closes quietly]
- [whispers] THEY'RE INSIDE.

171
00:08:49,834 --> 00:08:51,300
- WHAT?

172
00:08:58,234 --> 00:08:59,834
- THEY'RE COMING!

173
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:02,601
- PUT THE PHONE DOWN.
LEAVE THE LINE OPEN.

174
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:11,901
[footsteps approach slowly]

175
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,067
[breathing heavily]

176
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,400
[hinges creak]

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,934
[all scream]

178
00:09:23,934 --> 00:09:25,400
[glass shatters]

179
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,968
- JESUS!

180
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:28,200
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

181
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,601
- WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

182
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:32,033
- WHO THE FUCK IS SHE?

183
00:09:32,033 --> 00:09:34,300
- YOU WANNA TRY THAT AGAIN,
ASTOR?

184
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,701
- WHO IS SHE?

185
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,701
- HER NAME IS LUMEN.

186
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:40,567
- I MEAN WHO IS SHE?
WHY IS SHE HERE?

187
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:43,267
- SHE'S...RENTING THE HOUSE.

188
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:44,567
- YOU SAID THE HOUSE
WAS EMPTY.

189
00:09:44,567 --> 00:09:46,901
- THOUGHT IT WAS.

190
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:49,901
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
HE GOT A GIRLFRIEND SO FAST?

191
00:09:49,901 --> 00:09:51,067
- FIRST OF ALL,
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

192
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,000
SHE'S A TENANT,
LIKE I SAID.

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,868
SECOND OF ALL,
WHO ARE YOU?

194
00:09:54,868 --> 00:09:58,868
- I'M OLIVIA.
I LIVE NEAR HER GRANDPARENTS.

195
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,767
- ANYONE WANNA TELL ME
HOW YOU GOT HERE?

196
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,133
- TAXI.

197
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,734
- IT'S 215 MILES.

198
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:06,901
- [snickers]
FROM A BUS STATION.

199
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,067
- WHERE'D YOU GET THE LIQUOR?

200
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,701
- DOES IT MATTER?
- YEAH, I'D SAY SO.

201
00:10:12,701 --> 00:10:16,133
YOU'RE 12.
- YOU SAID YOU WERE 14!

202
00:10:16,133 --> 00:10:18,167
- THANKS A LOT.

203
00:10:18,167 --> 00:10:21,934
- IF YOU REALLY WANNA KNOW,
WE STOLE IT FROM MY HOUSE.

204
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,901
- THAT'S REASSURING.

205
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,334
- I THINK I NEED TO SIT DOWN.

206
00:10:29,868 --> 00:10:32,000
DO YOUR PARENTS KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE?

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,133
- MY MOM THINKS
I'M AT ASTOR'S.

208
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,634
- OH. AND LET ME GUESS,

209
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,801
YOUR GRANDPARENTS THINK
YOU'RE AT OLIVIA'S.

210
00:10:37,801 --> 00:10:39,601
- DON'T CALL 'EM.

211
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,467
PLEASE.

212
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:44,000
AT LEAST NOT UNTIL
TOMORROW.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,868
- THEY SHOULD REALLY
STAY THE NIGHT AND SOBER UP.

214
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:49,400
- THEN I'LL STAY TOO.

215
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,934
- WITH HER?

216
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,968
OH.

217
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,501
I THINK I'M GONNA--

218
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:58,300
[vomiting]

219
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,467
- HERE. COME WITH ME.

220
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,934
I'LL GET YOU TO BED, OKAY?

221
00:11:10,534 --> 00:11:11,734
- [grunts]

222
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,801
- QUITE A SITUATION
WE HAVE HERE.

223
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,467
- UNLESS YOU HAVE ADVICE
ON DEALING WITH TEENAGED GIRLS,

224
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:21,033
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

225
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:23,467
- MY ADVICE--
GET ASTOR OUT OF HERE.

226
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:26,167
TOMORROW MORNING
YOU'RE COLLECTING EVIDENCE

227
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,834
ON A VIOLENT MURDERER
YOU PLAN TO KILL.

228
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:31,033
YOU REALLY WANT A HUNG-OVER
PRETEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT?

229
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:33,968
- SHE CAME HERE.
- DRUNK!

230
00:11:33,968 --> 00:11:35,534
- I CAN'T JUST TURN HER AWAY.

231
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:37,501
- DEXTER, THERE'S A REASON

232
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:39,400
SERIAL KILLERS
DON'T HAVE CHILDREN.

233
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,901
YOU CAN'T BE KILLER AND DAD.
HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING?

234
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,734
HER MOTHER IS DEAD
BECAUSE OF YOU.

235
00:11:44,734 --> 00:11:46,601
- WHICH IS WHY
I NEED TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT

236
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:47,934
AND BE A GOOD FATHER.

237
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:49,534
- A GOOD FATHER
WOULD GET THOSE GIRLS

238
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,300
AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE.

239
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,267
- HARRISON'S STILL
AT THE APARTMENT WITH SONYA.

240
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:02,601
I'M GONNA GO GET HIM,
BRING HIM BACK HERE.

241
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:06,901
[cabinet doors clacking]

242
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:14,334
- DEB.

243
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,200
YOU'RE GONNA BREAK SOMETHING.
RELAX.

244
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,601
- YOU RELAX.
YOU'RE NOT ABOUT TO HAVE

245
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:19,334
THE WORST MEETING
OF YOUR CAREER.

246
00:12:19,334 --> 00:12:21,367
- IT'S A UNION REP.
HE'S ON YOUR SIDE.

247
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,934
YOU KNOW, JUST BE PROFESSIONAL
AND DON'T FREAK OUT

248
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:25,434
UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

249
00:12:25,434 --> 00:12:27,767
- I KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.
I'M GONNA GET FIRED--

250
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:28,934
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

251
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,434
EVEN LAGUERTA SAID
THIS ISN'T GONNA STICK.

252
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:32,767
- I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST HER?
- NO.

253
00:12:32,767 --> 00:12:35,300
BUT YOU CAN TRUST ME.

254
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,300
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

255
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,033
YOU KNOW WHY?

256
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,734
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR JOB BACK.

257
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,701
YOU GOT EVERYONE
AT THE STATION ON YOUR SIDE.

258
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:44,868
YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND
WHO LOVES YOU.

259
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:46,200
- [laughs]

260
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:51,701
SERIOUSLY? YOU'RE GONNA
DROP THAT ON ME NOW?

261
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,767
- IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.
IT SLIPPED OUT.

262
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:56,667
- I GOTTA GO.
- FINE. FORGET I SAID IT.

263
00:12:59,934 --> 00:13:01,834
[cell phone rings]

264
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:03,067
WHAT?

265
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,801
- GOOD MORNING TO YOU, TOO,
SUNSHINE.

266
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:07,968
YOU ALONE?
- YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

267
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:09,667
- YOUR PECKER.
SOON AS YOU TAKE A LOOK

268
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:12,834
AT THESE SNAPS I TOOK
OF YOUR BOY DEXTER MORGAN

269
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:16,467
AND HIS GAL PAL ON SOME KIND OF
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BOAT RUN.

270
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,667
WANNA MEET FOR A BEER?
- IT'S 7:00 A.M.

271
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,000
- BEER IS GOOD ANYTIME.

272
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,934
- YEAH. I GOTTA WORK.
- THEN I'LL COME TO YOU.

273
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:24,934
- WHAT'D I JUST SAY?
I CAN'T NOW!

274
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,534
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

275
00:13:36,367 --> 00:13:37,467
- [pops tongue]

276
00:13:45,434 --> 00:13:48,234
- YOU SURE YOU WANNA KEEP
YOUR APPOINTMENT WITH JORDAN?

277
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:50,133
- WELL, I NEED TO.

278
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,801
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANOTHER
CHANCE TO GET THE BLOOD.

279
00:13:52,801 --> 00:13:56,367
BESIDES, IT'S SOMETHING
I ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO DO.

280
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,767
YOU WERE A TEENAGED GIRL,
RIGHT?

281
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,868
HOW DO I DEAL WITH ASTOR?

282
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:03,534
- TRY TALKING TO HER.

283
00:14:03,534 --> 00:14:04,767
- LAST TIME I DID THAT,

284
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,634
SHE SAID SHE HATED ME
AND MOVED TO ORLANDO.

285
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:08,534
- WELL, NOW YOU GET
A SECOND CHANCE.

286
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,601
SHARE SOMETHING WITH HER...

287
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:16,968
WHAT YOU DID
WHEN YOU WERE HER AGE.

288
00:14:16,968 --> 00:14:18,634
- I KILLED
THE NEIGHBOR'S DOG.

289
00:14:18,634 --> 00:14:21,667
- WELL, DON'T TELL HER THAT.

290
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,400
[door opens]

291
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,200
- SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO I DO?

292
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,801
- JUST...CUT HER SOME SLACK.

293
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:30,000
ALL KIDS THAT AGE
MAKE MISTAKES.

294
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,734
TRUST ME, THE HANGOVER
WILL BE PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

295
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:36,734
- OH, IS THAT YOUR BROTHER?

296
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:39,767
- HARRISON.

297
00:14:39,767 --> 00:14:42,634
HE DOESN'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE ME.

298
00:14:42,634 --> 00:14:45,334
- WELL...YOU DIDN'T LOOK
LIKE A RACCOON

299
00:14:45,334 --> 00:14:47,968
THE LAST TIME HE SAW YOU.

300
00:14:51,601 --> 00:14:53,734
- EAT.
IT'S HANGOVER FOOD.

301
00:14:53,734 --> 00:14:55,901
IT'LL SOAK UP THE ALCOHOL.

302
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:58,434
- TALK TO HER.

303
00:14:58,434 --> 00:15:01,400
SHARE SOMETHING.

304
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,367
SO I NEED TO GO
TO A MEETING IN A FEW MINUTES.

305
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:08,067
BUT I WAS HOPING AFTER THAT

306
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:09,834
WE COULD SPEND
THE DAY TOGETHER,

307
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:13,701
'CAUSE WE REALLY SHOULD TALK.

308
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,467
SO IS THAT OKAY?

309
00:15:18,467 --> 00:15:20,701
- CAN HARRISON COME?

310
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:22,067
- SURE.
I'LL CALL THE BABYSITTER,

311
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,901
TELL HER
THERE'S A CHANGE OF PLANS.

312
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:34,234
- MAMA.

313
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:38,901
MAMA.

314
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,801
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY HE SAID THAT.

315
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:45,367
I BARELY KNOW HIM.
- STOP LYING, OKAY?

316
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:47,901
I'M NOT STUPID.

317
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,467
SHE'S NOT YOUR MAMA.

318
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:53,734
YOUR MAMA'S DEAD.
- ASTOR.

319
00:15:53,734 --> 00:15:55,501
- I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

320
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,367
IF YOU WERE THE ONE WHO DIED,

321
00:15:57,367 --> 00:15:58,934
I REALLY DOUBT
MY MOM WOULD HAVE

322
00:15:58,934 --> 00:16:01,334
BROUGHT IN A TENANT
SO FAST.

323
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,000
- I SHOULD GO.
- I KNOW.

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,801
- WE'LL ONLY BE
A COUPLE HOURS.

325
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:11,400
- I CAN HANDLE IT.

326
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,701
- MY FAMILY
IS PRETTY WEIRD TOO.

327
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:25,534
- HEY.

328
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:37,834
- HOW'D IT GO
WITH THE UNION SUIT?

329
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:40,133
- THEY'RE STICKING ME
IN THE FILE ROOM.

330
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:41,634
TILL AFTER MY HEARING.

331
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:43,801
- YOU'RE NOT FIRED.
IT'S GOOD NEWS.

332
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,033
- YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

333
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,701
EXCEPT EVERYBODY
STILL THINKS

334
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,634
I'M RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT GIRL DYING

335
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,701
AND ALL THOSE KIDS GETTING
WOUNDED IN THAT NIGHTCLUB.

336
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:53,567
- FOR THE RECORD,

337
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,868
MY REPORT
BACKED YOUR STORY 100%.

338
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:57,701
NOT THAT IT MATTERED.

339
00:16:57,701 --> 00:16:59,567
THE BRASS BACKED MY WIFE.

340
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,634
- MATTERS TO ME.

341
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:04,267
THANK YOU.

342
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,300
ANYBODY NEEDS
A REAL FUCKING DETECTIVE,

343
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,634
I'LL BE IN THE FILE ROOM.

344
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:15,067
DETECTIVE SCAPEGOAT
REPORTING FOR DUTY.

345
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,033
- [chuckling]
THEY SAID YOU'D BE JOINING ME.

346
00:17:18,033 --> 00:17:21,567
COME ON.
I CAN GET YOU STARTED.

347
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,567
RIGHT OVER THERE.

348
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:26,901
SO...HOW'S IT GOING
WITH THAT MAN OF YOURS?

349
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:29,567
- THIS MORNING
OUT OF THE BLUE, HE...

350
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,901
TOLD ME HE LOVED ME.

351
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:32,033
- OH!

352
00:17:32,033 --> 00:17:33,100
YOU SAY IT BACK?

353
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,934
- NO. I RAN.

354
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,667
- WHAT? WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

355
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:38,167
YOU DON'T FEEL THE SAME WAY?

356
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:39,901
- NO, THE PROBLEM IS
IS THAT...

357
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:42,200
I'M AFRAID I MIGHT.
[laughs]

358
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,601
- OH!
[chuckling]

359
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:45,400
- WHAT IS THIS,
THE BARREL GIRLS CASE?

360
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,501
FILE IT UNDER CREEPY?
- UNDER CLOSED CASES.

361
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,234
NOT READ, HONEY. FILE.

362
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,834
THAT'S WHAT I GET PAID TO DO,

363
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:54,234
AND FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS,

364
00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:56,067
[whispers] SO DO YOU.

365
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:58,534
[chuckling]

366
00:18:08,534 --> 00:18:09,734
- GOOD SESSION.

367
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:12,234
- ANOTHER HOUR
OF RUNNING IN PLACE.

368
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:14,701
- YOU SEEM MORE OPEN.
YOU FEEL THE DIFFERENCE?

369
00:18:14,701 --> 00:18:15,901
- YEAH.

370
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:17,534
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT...

371
00:18:17,534 --> 00:18:19,901
TAKE AWAY SOMETHING VALUABLE
THIS TIME.

372
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,234
- MM. GOOD.

373
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,467
WELL, I GOTTA TELL YA.

374
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:26,133
I STILL FEEL LIKE

375
00:18:26,133 --> 00:18:28,534
YOU'RE NOT BEING
COMPLETELY HONEST WITH ME.

376
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,133
- REALLY?
[water turns on]

377
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,901
'BOUT WHAT?
- ABOUT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT.

378
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:37,534
- WHAT I REALLY WANT...

379
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,934
JUST A DROP.

380
00:18:39,934 --> 00:18:42,434
A 30-GAUGE NEEDLE SHOULD
SLIDE RIGHT IN UNDETECTED.

381
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:44,801
[water continues running]

382
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:47,334
HE WON'T EVEN NOTICE
IT'S MISSING.

383
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,567
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

384
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:52,267
- WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE.

385
00:18:52,267 --> 00:18:54,234
WHATEVER IT IS,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME

386
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,968
SO THAT I CAN HELP YOU
CONSTRUCT A PLAN TO GET THERE.

387
00:18:56,968 --> 00:18:58,501
- I HAVE A PLAN TO GET THERE.

388
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:00,501
LUMEN AND I FOLLOW
THIS BLOOD TRAIL.

389
00:19:00,501 --> 00:19:01,901
WE TAKE YOU OUT.

390
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:05,167
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE HELPING ME ALREADY.

391
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:08,300
- I HOPE SO.
I REALLY DO.

392
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,501
[water running]

393
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,968
[faucet squeaks,
water stops]

394
00:19:15,534 --> 00:19:17,634
EACH OF US...

395
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,033
DEEP DOWN,
WE KNOW WHAT WE REALLY WANT.

396
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,968
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF ACTUALLY DOING IT.

397
00:19:22,968 --> 00:19:24,033
- YEAH.

398
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,267
OH.
I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK.

399
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,868
NEW EVIDENCE TO PROCESS.

400
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:33,834
BUT, UH, THANKS AGAIN
FOR EVERYTHING.

401
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:35,934
- SO WHEN'S OUR NEXT
APPOINTMENT?

402
00:19:35,934 --> 00:19:38,634
- I'LL CHECK WITH
THE RECEPTIONIST.

403
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,400
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

404
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,267
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
FILING THINGS AWAY,

405
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:43,167
NOT MAKIN' A MESS.

406
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,767
- WAIT, WAIT.
I WAS READING THAT.

407
00:20:44,767 --> 00:20:48,133
- YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
- JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE SECOND.

408
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:53,767
HOLY SHIT!
LOOK AT THIS.

409
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:55,367
- WHAT AM I LOOKIN' AT?

410
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:58,367
- DNA RESULTS.
MULTIPLE DNA RESULTS.

411
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,434
THE BARREL GIRLS CASE?
- MM-HMM.

412
00:21:00,434 --> 00:21:03,767
- WE PINNED THIS ON ONE GUY
AND...

413
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:06,434
LOOKS LIKE THERE ARE
MULTIPLE PERPS.

414
00:21:06,434 --> 00:21:09,033
I'M JUST GONNA...

415
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:10,767
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

416
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:13,501
- DNA SEQUENCING REPORT,
UH...

417
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,234
PARTIAL SEQUENCES ON THREE,
MAYBE FOUR PERPS?

418
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,200
- WHAT CASE IS THIS?

419
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
- BARREL GIRLS.

420
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,367
- DIDN'T WE...DIDN'T WE
PIN THIS ON ONE GUY?

421
00:21:22,367 --> 00:21:23,968
- YES. BOYD FOWLER.

422
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:26,567
BUT THE CORONER FOUND
TRACE DNA ON THE GIRLS

423
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,300
THAT WASN'T BOYD'S.

424
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,901
THERE WERE PARTIAL SEQUENCES
FROM MULTIPLE PEOPLE.

425
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:32,767
IT'S ALL IN THE FILE.

426
00:21:32,767 --> 00:21:35,234
- WHY AM I ONLY HEARING
ABOUT THIS NOW?

427
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,834
- BECAUSE BY THE TIME THE FINAL
CORONER REPORT CAME THROUGH,

428
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,300
WE'D ALREADY CLOSED THE CASE.

429
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,968
THE ONLY REASON
I CAME ACROSS THIS

430
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:42,667
WAS BECAUSE I WAS
FILING IT ALL AWAY.

431
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:44,701
LOOK.

432
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:47,601
THIS IS COLE HARMON,
OUR ORIGINAL SUSPECT.

433
00:21:47,601 --> 00:21:49,767
JORDAN CHASE'S SECURITY GUY.
WE LET HIM GO.

434
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:53,667
WE GOT DNA SAMPLES ON HIM.
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

435
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,834
- THERE ARE ENOUGH
COMMON MARKERS

436
00:21:55,834 --> 00:21:57,634
THAT COLE HARMON
IS LOOKING PRETTY GOOD

437
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:59,601
FOR THE BARREL GIRLS' MURDERS.

438
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,200
AT THE VERY LEAST,
HE CAN'T BE EXCLUDED.

439
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,868
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, THAT COLE
AND BOYD DID THIS TOGETHER?

440
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,033
- YEAH.

441
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,467
WITH MAYBE THREE
OR FOUR OTHERS.

442
00:22:09,467 --> 00:22:11,667
- WE GOTTA REOPEN THIS CASE.

443
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,801
- I KNOW.
BUT I CAN'T TELL LAGUERTA.

444
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:16,767
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
ON FILE CLERK DUTY.

445
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,267
- WH--I'M NOT TELLIN' HER.

446
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,734
THIS CASE WAS SOLVED.

447
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:25,868
IF I ASK HER TO REOPEN IT,

448
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:27,968
I MAY AS WELL PUT
MY BALLS IN A VICE.

449
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,601
AND NOT IN A HOT WAY EITHER.

450
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:34,167
- WELL, THAT JUST LEAVES...ME.

451
00:22:44,434 --> 00:22:47,167
- HEY. YOU'RE LATE.

452
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:49,501
- YEAH. TOUGH MORNING.

453
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,734
ASTOR SHOWED UP
ON MY DOORSTEP LAST NIGHT

454
00:22:52,734 --> 00:22:54,734
DRUNK WITH A FRIEND.

455
00:22:54,734 --> 00:22:56,267
- HOW OLD'S THE FRIEND?

456
00:22:58,801 --> 00:23:00,801
JUST KIDDING.

457
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,767
WHAT'S THAT?
BLOOD SAMPLE?

458
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,868
- YES. IT'S A BLOOD SAMPLE.

459
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,167
- TOP SECRET, HUH?
I GET IT.

460
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:18,000
SO...WHAT IS IT?
BLOOD ALCOHOL FOR ASTOR?

461
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,567
- SHE VOMITED
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

462
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,767
FURTHER TESTING'S
KIND OF UNNECESSARY.

463
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,067
- STD PANEL?

464
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:25,901
- VINCE, SHE'S 12.

465
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,367
- I MEANT FOR YOU.

466
00:23:27,367 --> 00:23:29,400
[cell phone rings]

467
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,033
- IT'S A HOMICIDE VICTIM

468
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,200
I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE
PROCESSED ALREADY.

469
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,868
I MADE A MISTAKE,
FORGOT TO SUBMIT IT, OKAY?

470
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:38,601
MORGAN.

471
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:40,634
- DEXTER, THE GIRLS ARE GONE.

472
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:42,801
- GONE WHERE?

473
00:23:42,801 --> 00:23:44,067
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THEY'RE MISSING.

474
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,434
THEY FELT TERRIBLE,

475
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:47,434
AND WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY ADVIL IN THE HOUSE,

476
00:23:47,434 --> 00:23:49,067
SO I TOOK HARRISON
TO THE STORE.

477
00:23:49,067 --> 00:23:50,701
- YOU LEFT THEM ALONE?
- I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE.

478
00:23:50,701 --> 00:23:52,334
AND WHEN I GOT BACK,
THEY WERE GONE.

479
00:23:52,334 --> 00:23:54,968
- MAYBE THEY WENT FOR A WALK.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

480
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:56,167
THE BACK DOOR WAS WIDE OPEN,

481
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,267
AND THEIR CELL PHONES
ARE STILL HERE.

482
00:23:58,267 --> 00:23:59,901
DEXTER, WHAT 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL

483
00:23:59,901 --> 00:24:01,634
WILLINGLY LEAVES
HER CELL PHONE BEHIND?

484
00:24:01,634 --> 00:24:03,601
- DON'T MOVE.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

485
00:24:03,601 --> 00:24:05,400
- I'M SO SORRY.
[beep]

486
00:24:18,434 --> 00:24:19,901
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

487
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:22,501
- I WENT TO THE NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE
TO SEE IF HE SAW ANYTHING.

488
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:24,000
- WHAT?
- HEY.

489
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
SO I SAW SOME GUY
NEAR THE HOUSE.

490
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,634
LIGHT HAIR, AVERAGE BUILD,
MID-30s.

491
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:31,467
- LIKE COLE AND BOYD
AND DAN.

492
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:32,968
- OH, HE HAD A WHITE PANEL VAN.

493
00:24:32,968 --> 00:24:34,601
AND IT WAS WEIRD ENOUGH
I CHECKED OUT THE PLATE.

494
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:35,934
N4B SOMETHING.

495
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,400
- WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM?

496
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
- I DIDN'T KNOW
THE GIRLS WERE IN THE HOUSE.

497
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,901
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU HAD A TENANT.

498
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:42,734
JUST THOUGHT HE WAS A--
A PAINTER OR SOMETHING.

499
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:44,801
- WHICH IS WHY YOU THOUGHT
TO CHECK THE LICENSE PLATE?

500
00:24:44,801 --> 00:24:46,968
- WELL, NO, THAT'S JUST HABIT
FROM NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

501
00:24:46,968 --> 00:24:48,300
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

502
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:52,300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

503
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,601
- LOOKING FOR SIGNS
OF A BREAK-IN.

504
00:24:55,601 --> 00:24:57,767
AN ABDUCTION--THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE THINKING HERE, RIGHT?

505
00:24:57,767 --> 00:24:59,267
- YEAH. BUT IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

506
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:01,601
- IT DOES IF SOMEONE
CAME LOOKING FOR US.

507
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,367
- LIKE ONE OF JORDAN'S GUYS.

508
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,033
- THERE'S A REASON
YOU WERE WORRIED LAST NIGHT

509
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:06,434
WHEN YOU HEARD NOISES
IN THE HOUSE.

510
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:08,467
- BUT I OVERREACTED.
IT WAS NOTHING.

511
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:09,868
- ONLY THIS TIME
THERE WAS SOMEONE

512
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:11,701
LURKING AROUND THE HOUSE.

513
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,734
I SHOULDN'T HAVE STOLEN
THAT BLOOD SAMPLE.

514
00:25:14,734 --> 00:25:16,367
NOT WITH THE GIRLS HERE.

515
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,067
WE NEED TO CALL THE COPS.

516
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:25,200
- THEY'LL JUST START
ASKING QUESTIONS.

517
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,834
AND IF IT DOES HAVE TO DO
WITH JORDAN,

518
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:29,067
THEY'LL PROBABLY TRACE IT
ALL BACK TO US.

519
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,667
[speed dial beeping]

520
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,701
[line rings]
- METRO.

521
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,634
- THIS IS DEXTER MORGAN
FROM HOMICIDE.

522
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:39,634
I'D LIKE TO REPORT
A PROBABLE CHILD ABDUCTION.

523
00:25:39,634 --> 00:25:42,734
IT'S A WHITE PANEL VAN.
I HAVE A PARTIAL PLATE.

524
00:25:46,234 --> 00:25:48,701
- WE'VE ISSUED A BLANKET
APB ON THE VAN.

525
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:50,901
NCIC HAS STARTED A FILE
ON THE GIRLS.

526
00:25:50,901 --> 00:25:52,601
- UNTIL WE GET THEM BACK
SAFELY,

527
00:25:52,601 --> 00:25:55,534
DETECTIVE LINKER WILL BE
OUR LIAISON TO MISSING PERSONS.

528
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:57,167
- DID YOU CALL OLIVIA'S
PARENTS?

529
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:58,701
- I TRIED.
I COULDN'T GET A HOLD OF THEM.

530
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:00,501
- WHAT ABOUT ASTOR'S
GRANDPARENTS?

531
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,934
- THEY HADN'T HEARD FROM HER.

532
00:26:01,934 --> 00:26:03,734
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
SHE WAS MISSING, THOUGH.

533
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:05,033
DIDN'T WANT TO WORRY THEM.

534
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,067
YET.
- MOST MISSING CHILDREN

535
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,200
ARE ABDUCTED BY SOMEONE
THE PARENTS KNOW.

536
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,100
IS THERE ANYONE
YOU CAN THINK OF?

537
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,567
- NO. NOBODY.

538
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:15,734
- YOU SURE?
NO ONE NEW?

539
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:18,567
- WHERE WERE YOU, ANYWAY,
WHEN THEY WERE TAKEN?

540
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:20,100
- I CAN'T LIE ABOUT THIS.

541
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,567
NOT WITH ASTOR'S LIFE
ON THE LINE.

542
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:25,033
I WAS WITH JORDAN CHASE.

543
00:26:28,601 --> 00:26:31,067
HE...OFFERED ME SOME

544
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:33,634
PRIVATE SESSIONS
TO HELP DEAL WITH...

545
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,634
RITA'S DEATH.

546
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,334
WHAT?

547
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,701
- A LOT OF FUCKED UP PEOPLE
CIRCLING THAT GUY, DEX.

548
00:26:43,701 --> 00:26:46,267
- A LOT? WHO?

549
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:47,701
BESIDES BOYD FOWLER.

550
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,634
- WELL, HIS HEAD OF SECURITY
FOR ONE.

551
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:51,901
- I THOUGHT WE CLEARED HIM.

552
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,567
- MAY HAVE BEEN PREMATURE.

553
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,300
- OKAY...WHAT'S GOING ON?

554
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,300
- THE BARREL GIRLS CASE MIGHT
NOT BE AS CLOSED AS WE THOUGHT.

555
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,467
- CAN WE JUST FIND THE VAN?

556
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,701
- [ahem]

557
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,267
[police radio chatter]

558
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:25,667
[alarm whoops]

559
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:27,167
- DON'T MOVE!
- SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!

560
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,901
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
WHAT--WHAT'S GOING ON?

561
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:31,067
- ON YOUR KNEES!
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD NOW!

562
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,934
STAY RIGHT THERE.

563
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:34,601
- WHO IS HE?

564
00:27:34,601 --> 00:27:36,100
- NAME'S BARRY KURT.
NO PRIORS.

565
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,767
THEY FOUND HIM AT
A GAS STATION ON CORAL.

566
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,801
- WHERE'S ASTOR?
- HEY--EASY!

567
00:27:43,801 --> 00:27:45,367
- IF YOU HURT HER,
I'LL KILL YOU.

568
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:46,734
I'LL KILL YOU.
- GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME.

569
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:49,267
- YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
- HE'S LOOKING FOR THE GIRLS

570
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,100
JUST LIKE YOU.
- HE'S WHAT?

571
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,968
- I'M OLIVIA'S FATHER.
SORT OF, ANYWAY.

572
00:27:53,968 --> 00:27:56,767
I LIVE WITH HER MOM.
- [exhales]

573
00:27:56,767 --> 00:27:59,067
I'M ASTOR'S STEPFATHER,
DEXTER MORGAN.

574
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:00,634
- YEAH. YOU SHOULD
TRY TO CALM DOWN.

575
00:28:00,634 --> 00:28:02,634
- HE THOUGHT SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO HIS DAUGHTER.

576
00:28:02,634 --> 00:28:05,334
- SOMETHING IS GONNA HAPPEN
TO THEM WHEN I FIND THEM.

577
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:07,667
OLIVIA BROKE INTO
OUR LIQUOR CABINET,

578
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,534
STOLE MONEY FROM HER MOTHER,
AND TOOK OFF.

579
00:28:09,534 --> 00:28:11,667
WE'VE GOT GPS TRACKING
ON HER MOBILE PHONE.

580
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:14,167
I FOLLOWED IT TO YOUR HOUSE,
BUT THEY WEREN'T THERE.

581
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,367
I FIGURED I'D GAS UP THE VAN
AND GO BACK.

582
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:18,868
NEXT THING I KNOW,
I'M ON MY KNEES IN CUFFS

583
00:28:18,868 --> 00:28:21,634
LIKE SOME LOSER ON <i>COPS.</i>

584
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:23,300
- SO WHERE ARE THEY?

585
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,000
- PROBABLY CAUSING TROUBLE
SOMEWHERE.

586
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,968
EVER SINCE ASTOR
MOVED DOWN THE BLOCK,

587
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:29,968
OLIVIA'S BEEN NOTHING
BUT A PAIN IN THE ASS.

588
00:28:29,968 --> 00:28:31,834
[cell phone rings]

589
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:33,033
- MORGAN.

590
00:28:33,033 --> 00:28:35,300
- IS HE ALWAYS THIS VIOLENT?

591
00:28:36,868 --> 00:28:38,767
- THEY FOUND THE GIRLS
AT BAYSIDE.

592
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,234
THEY'RE HOLDING THEM
FOR SHOPLIFTING.

593
00:28:52,701 --> 00:28:54,100
ASTOR?

594
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,067
- THANK GOD.

595
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:59,067
WE HAD THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT
LOOKING FOR YOU.

596
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:00,367
WE WERE SO WORRIED.

597
00:29:00,367 --> 00:29:01,868
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU
PUT US THROUGH TODAY.

598
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:04,834
- I'M SORRY.
- WHAT WERE YOU EVEN THINKING

599
00:29:04,834 --> 00:29:07,200
RUNNING OFF LIKE THAT?
- SHOPLIFTING?

600
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,467
THAT FIGURES.

601
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:09,667
- WE DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.
I SWEAR.

602
00:29:09,667 --> 00:29:11,567
- I JUST TRIED ON A RING
AND FORGOT ABOUT IT.

603
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:14,667
IT WAS A MISTAKE.
I GAVE IT BACK.

604
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,601
- I'M DETECTIVE
DEBRA MORGAN

605
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:17,601
FROM MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

606
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:19,767
MIND IF I TAKE IT
FROM HERE?

607
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:22,901
- JUST MAKE SURE I DON'T
SEE THESE TWO AGAIN.

608
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,234
- COME ON, WE'RE GOING HOME.
- NO!

609
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,968
- NOW.
- MY STUFF'S AT ASTOR'S.

610
00:29:30,968 --> 00:29:33,067
I NEED TO GO WITH HER.
- YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME.

611
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:35,167
- I DON'T WANT TO.
- TELL YOU WHAT.

612
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,467
THEIR STUFF IS AT MY HOUSE.

613
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:38,133
WHY DON'T I TAKE THEM THERE,
GET THEM PACKED.

614
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:39,601
WE'LL MEET YOU IN AN HOUR.

615
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:42,300
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO GET YOUR
VAN OUT OF IMPOUND ANYWAY.

616
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,434
- WHICH YOU'RE PAYING FOR,
BY THE WAY.

617
00:29:44,434 --> 00:29:45,901
- WE'LL MEET YOU
AT THE ROADSIDE CAFE.

618
00:29:45,901 --> 00:29:49,033
IT'S RIGHT NEAR IMPOUND.
- GREAT.

619
00:29:50,334 --> 00:29:53,167
TEENAGERS.
THEY CAN MAKE YOU HOMICIDAL.

620
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:55,234
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

621
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,868
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?
- YEAH.

622
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:06,534
YOU WANNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU

623
00:30:06,534 --> 00:30:08,968
AND DETECTIVE MORGAN?

624
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:11,501
- NOTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

625
00:30:11,501 --> 00:30:14,901
- OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THE BARREL GIRLS CASE.

626
00:30:14,901 --> 00:30:17,100
- WE FOUND SOME NEW EVIDENCE.

627
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,434
- YOU AND DETECTIVE MORGAN.

628
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:21,367
- SHE DID.
IN THE FILE ROOM.

629
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:25,100
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

630
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,601
WHAT?

631
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:28,167
- YOU REALLY DON'T SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON?

632
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:32,501
I SEND HER TO THE FILE ROOM
WITH ONE ASSIGNMENT--FILE.

633
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:34,701
AND THEN SHE MAGICALLY
FINDS EVIDENCE

634
00:30:34,701 --> 00:30:37,467
TO REOPEN A CASE
SHE KNOWS I PERSONALLY CLOSED.

635
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:40,234
- MARIA...IT'S DNA.

636
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:42,067
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE MADE IT UP.

637
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:45,801
- SHE'S TRYING TO GET BACK
AT ME.

638
00:30:45,801 --> 00:30:48,601
WE PINNED THIS
ON BOYD FOWLER.

639
00:30:48,601 --> 00:30:51,100
I HAD FIVE DETECTIVES
TELL ME HE'S THE ONE.

640
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,200
- AND NOW I AM TELLING YOU
THAT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED.

641
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,868
YOU NEED TO REOPEN THE CASE.
- I DISAGREE.

642
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:00,934
CHANGING FIVE NAMES
ON THE MURDER BOARD

643
00:31:00,934 --> 00:31:03,501
FROM BLACK TO RED ISN'T
GONNA HELP THIS DEPARTMENT.

644
00:31:03,501 --> 00:31:06,300
- THE DEPARTMENT?
OR YOU?

645
00:31:11,968 --> 00:31:13,467
- WHAT HAPPENED?

646
00:31:13,467 --> 00:31:16,367
- UH...THERE WERE AT BAYSIDE.

647
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,701
- OH, THANK GOD.
- SHOPLIFTING.

648
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:23,601
- YOU GONNA INTRODUCE US?

649
00:31:25,534 --> 00:31:26,968
- THAT'S THE ONE I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT.

650
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,801
HIS NEW GIRLFRIEND.

651
00:31:29,801 --> 00:31:31,200
- SHE'S MY TENANT.

652
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,501
[sighs]

653
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:34,968
LUMEN, THIS IS
MY SISTER DEBRA.

654
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:36,901
DEB, LUMEN.

655
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:40,501
- I DIDN'T KNOW
HE HAD A TENANT.

656
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,634
- DIDN'T KNOW
HE HAD A SISTER.

657
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,167
- I'M GONNA...

658
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:53,267
GO CHECK ON THE GIRLS.

659
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:58,567
- SERIOUSLY?

660
00:31:58,567 --> 00:31:59,934
THAT'S YOUR TENANT?

661
00:31:59,934 --> 00:32:02,634
- YES.
- OH.

662
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,133
WHERE'S ALL HER STUFF?

663
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:08,400
- SHE HASN'T REALLY
MOVED IN YET.

664
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,200
- BUT YOU KNOW HER WELL ENOUGH
TO TRUST HER WITH YOUR SON.

665
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,400
- IT WAS AN EMERGENCY.

666
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,000
I THOUGHT THE GIRLS
HAD BEEN TAKEN.

667
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,767
- WHY ARE YOU KEEPING HER
A SECRET?

668
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:16,901
- I'M NOT.

669
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,334
- REALLY?
'CAUSE AT THE STATION

670
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:19,901
WE ASKED YOU WHO YOU WERE
SPENDING YOUR TIME WITH.

671
00:32:19,901 --> 00:32:21,567
YOU DIDN'T THINK TO MENTION
THE HOT BLONDE

672
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:23,501
THAT'S LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE?

673
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:25,334
- DIDN'T SEEM...
LIKE IT MATTERED.

674
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:27,467
OBVIOUSLY,
SHE DIDN'T TAKE THE GIRLS.

675
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:30,367
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

676
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,968
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

677
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:34,000
BELIEVE ME, I UNDERSTAND REBOUND
AS MUCH AS ANYBODY.

678
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,067
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE SOON?

679
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:37,400
- I'M NOT ON ANY REBOUND.

680
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,467
- COME ON.
SHE'S YOUR TENANT?

681
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,000
REALLY?

682
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,734
- THERE'S NOTHING GOING ON.

683
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:45,567
- FINE.

684
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:47,634
I GIVE UP.

685
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:51,200
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE STATION.

686
00:32:52,667 --> 00:32:55,467
- DEB KNOWS ABOUT
MY PARTNER IN CRIME.

687
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:58,501
THE WHOLE STATION KNOWS
I'M SEEING JORDAN CHASE.

688
00:32:58,501 --> 00:33:01,133
THIS IS NOT MY DAY.

689
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,067
ASTOR!

690
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:05,601
- JUST...STAY COOL.

691
00:33:05,601 --> 00:33:08,200
NO MATTER WHAT.

692
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:21,167
- [sighs]

693
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,601
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

694
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,367
- NO.

695
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:26,868
'CAUSE NOTHING
IS GOING ON WITH ME.

696
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:29,100
- SOMETHING IS.

697
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,300
YOU'RE DRINKING,

698
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,634
SHOPLIFTING.

699
00:33:32,634 --> 00:33:34,868
- I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
WE DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING,

700
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:36,300
AND IT WASN'T ME ANYWAY.

701
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,567
- YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY BARRY THINKS

702
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:38,934
YOU'RE
THE BAD INFLUENCE HERE?

703
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:40,234
- 'CAUSE HE'S AN ASSHOLE.

704
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:41,234
- STOP.

705
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,767
THIS IS NOT A GOOD PATH
YOU'RE HEADED DOWN HERE.

706
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:52,400
LOOK, JUST TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG, OKAY?

707
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,234
I'M ACTUALLY
A GOOD LISTENER.

708
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:05,701
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG?

709
00:34:05,701 --> 00:34:07,067
MY MOM GOT MURDERED,

710
00:34:07,067 --> 00:34:08,901
AND YOU MOVE <i>HER</i>
INTO OUR HOUSE

711
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,167
AND TELL ME
SHE'S YOUR TENANT?

712
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:11,267
- SHE IS.

713
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:13,834
- SHE'S MORE.
I CAN FUCKING TELL.

714
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:15,434
- ASTOR, YOU CANNOT
TALK TO ME THAT WAY.

715
00:34:15,434 --> 00:34:17,067
- OH.

716
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:22,734
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WERE THIS GREAT LISTENER.

717
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:25,200
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

718
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,767
- THEN WE'LL JUST SIT HERE
TILL YOU DO.

719
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:39,534
- YOU READY TO GO HOME?

720
00:34:39,534 --> 00:34:41,701
- NOT REALLY.

721
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:45,167
- YOU KNOW
I RAN AWAY ONCE, TOO.

722
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,200
I DITCHED OUT
ON MY OWN WEDDING.

723
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,701
- I DIDN'T RUN AWAY.

724
00:34:53,901 --> 00:34:55,767
- WHO DID THAT TO YOU?

725
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,033
THE BRUISES
ON YOUR STOMACH.

726
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:02,767
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

727
00:35:05,067 --> 00:35:08,467
- ACTUALLY, I REALLY DO.

728
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,968
I THINK
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

729
00:35:24,968 --> 00:35:26,267
- YEAH, I'M
IN A BATTLE OF WILLS

730
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:28,601
WITH MY DRUNK, SHOPLIFTING
TEENAGE STEP-DAUGHTER,

731
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:30,467
AND SHE'S GOING TO WIN.

732
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:33,300
- OLIVIA HAS BRUISES
ALL OVER HER STOMACH AND BACK.

733
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,501
SOMEONE'S BEEN HURTING HER.

734
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:38,634
- SHE TOLD YOU?

735
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:40,100
- NO, I SAW.

736
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,434
- WAIT,
YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

737
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:43,567
- DON'T BE MAD.

738
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:44,801
- I'M NOT MAD.

739
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:48,734
I'M JUST, UM...

740
00:35:48,734 --> 00:35:50,067
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM.

741
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:51,834
- I'LL BE WITH OLIVIA.

742
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:57,167
- PROMISE
YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING?

743
00:35:57,167 --> 00:35:59,000
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO HURT HER MORE.

744
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,334
- WHO?

745
00:36:00,334 --> 00:36:01,868
- BARRY.
WHO DO YOU THINK?

746
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,100
HE <i>IS</i> AN ASSHOLE.

747
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:06,834
- DOES HER MOM KNOW?

748
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:09,200
HE ONLY HITS HER
IN PLACES THAT DON'T SHOW.

749
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,467
HE GETS
ALL CRAZY OVER NOTHING.

750
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:14,868
HE DOESN'T LIKE HER HAIR,
SHE'S TWO MINUTES LATE.

751
00:36:15,968 --> 00:36:17,534
I THOUGHT
SHE'D BE SAFE HERE,

752
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:20,100
BUT THEN THERE'S LUMEN,

753
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,834
AND BARRY SHOWED UP,
AND WE JUST...RAN.

754
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,667
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

755
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,434
- 'CAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D CARE.

756
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:32,234
- OF COURSE I CARE.

757
00:36:32,234 --> 00:36:34,200
- EVEN WHEN
WE ALL LIVED HERE,

758
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,901
YOU WERE SO BUSY
OUT DOING STUFF ALL THE TIME.

759
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,534
OLIVIA'S MY FRIEND.

760
00:36:44,534 --> 00:36:47,701
MY ONLY FRIEND
SINCE MOM DIED.

761
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:51,100
I WANTED TO HELP HER, AND...

762
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,033
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

763
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:56,067
- YOU DID KNOW WHAT TO DO.
YOU CAME HOME.

764
00:37:01,634 --> 00:37:03,400
I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THIS.

765
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,734
OKAY?

766
00:37:14,901 --> 00:37:16,501
- EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH ASTOR?

767
00:37:16,501 --> 00:37:17,934
- NOTHING TURNING 20
WON'T FIX.

768
00:37:17,934 --> 00:37:19,000
WHAT'D LAGUERTA SAY?

769
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,567
- SHE'S NOT GONNA
REOPEN THE CASE.

770
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:22,901
SHE THINKS THAT YOU HAVE

771
00:37:22,901 --> 00:37:24,934
SOME KIND
OF VENDETTA AGAINST HER.

772
00:37:24,934 --> 00:37:26,534
- THAT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS.

773
00:37:26,534 --> 00:37:27,801
- GIVE HER A DAY
TO COOL OFF.

774
00:37:27,801 --> 00:37:29,067
WE'LL TRY AGAIN
TOMORROW.

775
00:37:35,901 --> 00:37:37,501
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
REOPEN THE CASE?

776
00:37:37,501 --> 00:37:38,567
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

777
00:37:38,567 --> 00:37:40,067
- COME RIGHT IN,
DETECTIVE.

778
00:37:40,067 --> 00:37:43,634
- THERE ARE AT LEAST
FIVE DEAD GIRLS IN BARRELS.

779
00:37:43,634 --> 00:37:45,968
AND NOW THERE'S
DNA EVIDENCE

780
00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:47,934
SAYING THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE

781
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,801
ARE STILL OUT THERE.

782
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:51,501
AND YOU THINK
THAT'S ABOUT ME

783
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:54,634
TRYING TO GET BACK AT YOU?

784
00:37:54,634 --> 00:37:57,801
DID YOU EVEN READ
THE FILE?

785
00:37:57,801 --> 00:37:59,133
THERE'S FUCKING PROOF.

786
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,267
- JUST WATCH YOUR TONE.

787
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:06,334
- YOU KNOW...

788
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:08,834
YOU THROWING ME UNDER THE BUS
FOR THE FUENTES BROTHERS,

789
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:12,067
USING YOUR HUSBAND
AS A CHESS PIECE,

790
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:13,767
PUTTING QUINN
ON BOGUS VACATION DAYS

791
00:38:13,767 --> 00:38:15,701
SO THAT I DON'T HAVE
A FUCKING PARTNER?

792
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:17,000
IF THAT'S ALL
JUST SOME GAME TO YOU,

793
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,601
I'LL TRY
TO UNDERSTAND IT,

794
00:38:18,601 --> 00:38:22,033
BUT THOSE GIRLS ARE DEAD.

795
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:24,133
DON'T YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN?

796
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:29,067
I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK
ARE WE DOING HERE?

797
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,167
- ENOUGH!

798
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:33,434
OKAY.

799
00:38:33,434 --> 00:38:34,701
- OKAY WHAT?

800
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,334
- I'M REOPENING THE CASE.

801
00:38:38,334 --> 00:38:40,467
BUT YOU NEED
TO HEAR ME,

802
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:43,300
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

803
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,534
I MADE THE FUENTES SITUATION
GO AWAY.

804
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,801
I WAS TRYING
TO HELP BATISTA.

805
00:38:49,801 --> 00:38:51,534
AS FAR AS QUINN GOES,

806
00:38:51,534 --> 00:38:53,501
HE WASN'T ON VACATION.

807
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,601
I SUSPENDED HIM.

808
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:58,901
TO PROTECT YOUR BROTHER.

809
00:39:05,434 --> 00:39:07,033
- PROTECT HIM FROM WHAT?

810
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:12,634
- YOU'RE SO INTERESTED
IN THE TRUTH,

811
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:13,968
ASK QUINN.

812
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:25,767
- HEY.

813
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:26,834
- CAN I TALK TO YOU?

814
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:29,400
IN PRIVATE?

815
00:39:32,033 --> 00:39:34,734
- LOOK, IF THIS
IS ABOUT THIS MORNING...

816
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:36,400
- LAST MONTH,
WHEN YOU TOLD ME

817
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,234
THAT YOU WERE TAKING
SOME VACATION DAYS,

818
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:42,601
WERE YOU ACTUALLY
ON SUSPENSION?

819
00:39:42,601 --> 00:39:44,000
- WHY?

820
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

821
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,033
- WERE YOU?

822
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:48,734
- DID LAGUERTA
SAY SOMETHING?

823
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,601
- SHE TOLD ME
I SHOULD TALK TO YOU.

824
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:54,501
DID IT HAVE SOMETHING
TO DO WITH MY BROTHER?

825
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:58,501
- YEAH.

826
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:00,300
BUT IT WAS NOTHING.

827
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,601
- THEN WHY DID YOU LIE?

828
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:07,901
- I WAS INVESTIGATING
RITA'S MURDER,

829
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:10,567
TRYING TO HELP.

830
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:13,067
I HAD A LEAD
ON KYLE BUTLER.

831
00:40:13,067 --> 00:40:17,067
I FIGURED IF WE COULD FIND
THE PERSON WHO KNEW TRINITY,

832
00:40:17,067 --> 00:40:19,767
THEN MAYBE WE COULD
TRACK DOWN THE CREEP

833
00:40:19,767 --> 00:40:22,868
WHO KILLED
YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW.

834
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:24,534
LAGUERTA TOLD ME
TO BACK OFF,

835
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:27,267
LEAVE IT TO THE FBI.

836
00:40:27,267 --> 00:40:30,901
WHEN I DIDN'T,
SHE SUSPENDED ME.

837
00:40:30,901 --> 00:40:32,200
- WHAT WAS THE LEAD?

838
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:35,300
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
IT DIDN'T PAN OUT.

839
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,701
- LAGUERTA TOLD ME THAT SHE
WAS PROTECTING DEXTER FROM YOU.

840
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:43,734
WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?

841
00:40:46,434 --> 00:40:50,834
- YOU REMEMBER THOSE COMPOSITE
SKETCHES OF KYLE BUTLER?

842
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:53,634
I GOT THIS CRAZY IDEA

843
00:40:53,634 --> 00:40:57,234
THAT MAYBE
IT WAS YOUR BROTHER.

845
00:40:59,901 --> 00:41:03,300
- NOTHING CAME OF IT,
SO I DROPPED IT.

846
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,467
I'M AN IDIOT, OKAY?

847
00:41:08,868 --> 00:41:10,434

00:42:04,334 --> 00:42:08,334
SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOTTA
SHOW 'EM WHO'S BOSS.

866
00:42:08,334 --> 00:42:10,334
- IS THAT WHAT YOU DO
WITH OLIVIA,

867
00:42:10,334 --> 00:42:13,300
SHOW HER WHO'S BOSS?

868
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,400
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

869
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,434
- I KNOW
ABOUT OLIVIA'S BRUISES,

870
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:20,634
HOW THEY'RE
STRATEGICALLY PLACED

871
00:42:20,634 --> 00:42:22,234
SO THEY WON'T SHOW.

872
00:42:24,534 --> 00:42:26,033
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

873
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:30,334
- NO?

874
00:42:30,334 --> 00:42:32,133
LET ME SHOW YOU?

875
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:34,100
- [groaning]

876
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,367
[coughing]

877
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:37,100
- THAT'S YOUR SOLAR PLEXUS.

878
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,367
- [coughing and gasping]

879
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,801
- RIGHT NOW, YOUR DIAPHRAGM
IS PARTIALLY PARALYZED,

880
00:42:40,801 --> 00:42:43,267
WHICH IS WHY YOU'RE HAVING
TROUBLE CATCHING YOUR BREATH.

881
00:42:43,267 --> 00:42:45,801
- WHAT ARE YOU, MAN,
SOME KIND OF PSYCHO?

882
00:42:45,801 --> 00:42:47,868
- NOT TODAY.
JUST A CONCERNED PARENT.

883
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:48,868
- AAH!

884
00:42:48,868 --> 00:42:50,167
OHH!

885
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,834
- THAT'S YOUR LIVER.

886
00:42:51,834 --> 00:42:53,234
- [groaning]

887
00:42:53,234 --> 00:42:55,033
- THE NICE THING
ABOUT THE LIVER IS

888
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,501
IF YOU HIT IT JUST RIGHT,
YOU GET THE VAGUS NERVE,

889
00:42:57,501 --> 00:42:59,267
WHICH TENTACLES OUT
TO THE REST OF YOUR BODY.

890
00:42:59,267 --> 00:43:00,667
- [groaning]

891
00:43:00,667 --> 00:43:04,234
- YOUR BRAIN SHORT-CIRCUITS,
YOUR BODY SHUTS DOWN,

892
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:07,667
AND YOU FEEL,
WHAT'S THE WORD, TERROR?

893
00:43:07,667 --> 00:43:10,634
WHICH IS WHAT OLIVIA FELT
EVERY TIME YOU HIT HER THERE

894
00:43:10,634 --> 00:43:12,567
JUST SO THE BRUISES
WOULDN'T SHOW.

895
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:13,801
- [groans]

896
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,100
- I WANT YOU TO LISTEN
TO ME CAREFULLY.

897
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:18,367
LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY, BECAUSE
THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

898
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,367
YOU'RE GONNA CALL
OLIVIA'S MOTHER.

899
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:22,968
YOU'RE GONNA TELL HER
YOU'RE SICK OF HER FAT ASS.

900
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:25,434
YOU CAN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT IT ANYMORE.

901
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,734
AND YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE HER BELIEVE IT,

902
00:43:27,734 --> 00:43:30,000
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
SHE MAY TAKE YOU BACK ONE DAY

903
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,200
AND LET YOU NEAR HER KID
OR MINE.

904
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,701
AND I CAN'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

905
00:43:33,701 --> 00:43:37,033
- [coughing]

906
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,934
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA SWING BY
TO PICK UP YOUR STUFF.

907
00:43:38,934 --> 00:43:40,167
YOU'RE JUST GONNA LEAVE.

908
00:43:40,167 --> 00:43:43,801
TOMORROW, WHEN I DROP
OLIVIA OFF,

909
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:48,000
YOU WILL BE GONE.

910
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,901
IF YOU EVER COME BACK,

911
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:54,534
BELIEVE ME, I WON'T
GO SO EASY NEXT TIME.

912
00:43:54,534 --> 00:43:56,634
- [coughing]

913
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,501
- BY THE WAY,
THAT'S YOUR KIDNEY.

914
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:00,534
- [groans]

915
00:44:05,534 --> 00:44:07,067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

916
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:08,334
- I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT, OKAY?

917
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:10,167
"THIS ISN'T YOUR BUSINESS,
DEXTER.

918
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:11,834
"DON'T GET INVOLVED, DEXTER.

919
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:13,801
YOU PUT TOO MUCH
AT RISK, DEXTER."

920
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:15,534
- THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

921
00:44:18,868 --> 00:44:20,033
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

922
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,934
- YOU ARE?

923
00:44:24,934 --> 00:44:27,400
- YOU PROTECTED ASTOR,

924
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,801
PUT YOURSELF OUT THERE
FOR ANOTHER PERSON.

925
00:44:29,801 --> 00:44:33,501
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU HAD THAT IN YOU.

926
00:44:35,734 --> 00:44:37,100
I UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

927
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,901
ASSUMED YOU WERE
A MONSTER

928
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,534
WHEN YOU WERE CAPABLE

929
00:44:41,534 --> 00:44:43,734
OF SO MUCH MORE.

930
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:47,501
IF ONLY I'D SEEN THAT,

931
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:49,400
MAYBE I WOULDN'T HAVE
LED YOU DOWN THIS PATH.

932
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:05,601
- DEB?

933
00:45:05,601 --> 00:45:07,200
- HI, HONEY.

934
00:45:15,367 --> 00:45:17,000
- GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY APARTMENT.

935
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,100
- I BROUGHT YOU
A PRESENT.

936
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,067
DON'T YOU
WANT TO SEE WHAT IT IS?

937
00:45:20,067 --> 00:45:21,934
YOUR BOY DEXTER MORGAN
AND HIS LADY FRIEND

938
00:45:21,934 --> 00:45:24,901
ON HIS BOAT
AT 3:00 A.M. IN THE MORNING,

939
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:26,901
AND THEY ARE NOT FUCKING.

940
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:28,367
- WHAT'S IN THE BAGS?

941
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:29,467
- SOMETHING HEAVY.

942
00:45:29,467 --> 00:45:30,834
I'M THINKING NARCOTICS,
MAYBE A BODY.

943
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,834
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

944
00:45:34,834 --> 00:45:36,901
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S
BESIDE THE POINT.

945
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:39,000
POINT IS THAT
WHEN THEY CAME BACK,

946
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,434
THOSE BAGS WERE GONE,

947
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:42,667
SO WHATEVER THEY'RE HIDING,
IT'S SOMETHING BIG.

948
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:45,267
- THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

949
00:45:46,834 --> 00:45:49,934
HERE. CONSIDER THIS
YOUR SEVERANCE PACKAGE.

950
00:45:49,934 --> 00:45:51,601
WE'RE DONE.

951
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,834
- REALLY?

952
00:45:54,834 --> 00:45:57,734
WHAT? YOU THINK YOU
CAN JUST PAY ME OFF

953
00:45:57,734 --> 00:45:59,100
LIKE I'M THE CORNER WHORE?

954
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:01,567
- I'M JUST SAYING,
IT'S TIME TO STOP.

955
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:04,601
- AND I'M SAYIN' BULLSHIT.

956
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:06,767
IF THIS THING IS AS BIG
AS I THINK IT IS,

957
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:09,334
LAGUERTA AND ALL THEM
OTHER DOUCHEBAGS IN HOMICIDE

958
00:46:09,334 --> 00:46:10,834
ARE GONNA BE
KISSING MY ASS.

959
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,167
- BACK OFF, LIDDY.

960
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,434
I MEAN IT.

961
00:46:13,434 --> 00:46:16,567
- I TOLD YOU
DON'T FUCK WITH ME.

962
00:46:18,434 --> 00:46:22,834
YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK I MAY
CALL UP THAT SISTER.

963
00:46:22,834 --> 00:46:25,234
GIVE HER A RING, SEE
IF SHE WANTS TO GET TOGETHER,

964
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:27,400
HAVE A DRINK,
MAYBE TALK ABOUT THE BROTHER.

965
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,434
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

966
00:46:28,434 --> 00:46:30,934
- STAY THE FUCK
AWAY FROM ME!

967
00:46:30,934 --> 00:46:33,400
AND STAY THE FUCK
AWAY FROM DEB!

968
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:39,501
- [chuckles]

969
00:47:08,467 --> 00:47:11,567
- SO YOU REALLY DID
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

970
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:13,267
- I READ THE REPORT.

971
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,534
- THANK YOU.

972
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:17,734
- DOES THIS MEAN...

973
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,234
YOU'LL STOP SLEEPING
ON THE COUCH?

974
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:27,300
- WE STILL GOT
A LONG WAY TO GO

975
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,834
BETWEEN THE COUCH
AND THE BEDROOM, MARIA.

976
00:47:37,734 --> 00:47:39,834
- SO, WHAT, NOW YOU'RE
NOT EVEN TALKING TO ME?

977
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,400
DEB, LOOK,
I HAD AN IDIOT THEORY

978
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,767
AND I DROPPED IT.

979
00:47:48,767 --> 00:47:50,734
- YEAH, BECAUSE
LAGUERTA SUSPENDED YOU.

980
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:53,667
- NO, BECAUSE I WAS WRONG.

981
00:47:53,667 --> 00:47:56,067
LOOK, WHAT I SAID
YESTERDAY IS TRUE.

982
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,567
I LOVE YOU,

983
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:59,067
AND I'M NOT TAKING
IT BACK.

984
00:48:01,467 --> 00:48:03,033
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

985
00:48:03,033 --> 00:48:05,300
- IT MEANS I'D NEVER DO
ANYTHING TO HURT YOU.

986
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,534
EVER.

987
00:48:07,534 --> 00:48:09,868
- I TRUSTED YOU.

988
00:48:09,868 --> 00:48:11,300
AND WHILE YOU WERE
FUCKING ME,

989
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,400
YOU WERE SPREADING SHIT
ABOUT MY BROTHER BEHIND MY BACK.

990
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,934
YOU THINK
THAT'S NOT HURTING ME?

991
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,467
FUCK YOU.

992
00:48:37,868 --> 00:48:39,934
- YOU WANT US
TO COME INSIDE WITH YOU?

993
00:48:39,934 --> 00:48:41,834
- NO, I'LL BE OKAY.

994
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,634
I COULD BARELY UNDERSTAND
MY MOM ON THE PHONE

995
00:48:43,634 --> 00:48:45,200
WITH ALL THE CRYING,

996
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,234
BUT SHE ACTUALLY SAID
BARRY DID HER A FAVOR LEAVING.

997
00:48:48,234 --> 00:48:49,868
HE DEFINITELY
DID ME A FAVOR.

998
00:48:49,868 --> 00:48:51,567
HE TOLD HER
SHE HAS A FAT ASS.

999
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:52,667
[laughs]

1000
00:48:52,667 --> 00:48:54,067
HE IS NOT COMING BACK.

1001
00:49:02,267 --> 00:49:03,367
THANK YOU.

1002
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:05,434
CALL YOU LATER.

1003
00:49:15,067 --> 00:49:16,567
[engine starts]

1004
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,734
- ARE YOU GONNA TELL
GRANDMA AND GRANDPA?

1005
00:49:31,734 --> 00:49:34,133
- ABOUT YOU GETTING DRUNK
IN MIAMI

1006
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,501
AND SHOPLIFTING?

1007
00:49:36,501 --> 00:49:37,868
NAH, THAT'S UP TO YOU.

1008
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,467
WE ALL HAVE
OUR SECRETS, RIGHT?

1009
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:45,300
- THANKS.

1010
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,267
- BUT IF IT
EVER HAPPENS AGAIN...

1011
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:49,467
- IT WON'T.

1012
00:49:49,467 --> 00:49:51,601
- AND IF BARRY
EVER SHOWS UP...

1013
00:49:51,601 --> 00:49:54,000
- I'LL TELL YOU,
I PROMISE.

1014
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,934
[engine stops]

1015
00:50:00,133 --> 00:50:01,334
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

1016
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:03,767
- YOU ARE?

1017
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:07,767
- YEAH. YOU...

1018
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:09,834
PUT YOURSELF
OUT THERE FOR ANOTHER PERSON.

1019
00:50:12,934 --> 00:50:14,501
- I WANT YOU
TO KNOW SOMETHING.

1020
00:50:14,501 --> 00:50:17,601
IF LUMEN'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND,
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME.

1021
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:20,334
- OKAY.

1022
00:50:20,334 --> 00:50:21,734
BUT SHE'S NOT.

1023
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:23,734
- SHE'S NOT JUST
YOUR TENANT, THOUGH.

1024
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:26,200
- SHE'S A FRIEND

1025
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,000
WHO'S BEEN
THROUGH SOME REALLY...

1026
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,300
REALLY BAD STUFF.

1027
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,567
I'M HELPING HER
DEAL WITH IT.

1028
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:38,801
- DOES IT MAKE YOU
FEEL BETTER?

1029
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:40,501
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1030
00:50:40,501 --> 00:50:42,067
- ABOUT MOM.

1031
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:43,634
BEING THERE FOR LUMEN,

1032
00:50:43,634 --> 00:50:46,868
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MOM?

1033
00:50:57,634 --> 00:50:59,234
- I LOVE YOU.

1034
00:51:01,501 --> 00:51:03,100
YOU KNOW THAT?

1035
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:07,567
- YOU SHOULD COME IN,

1036
00:51:07,567 --> 00:51:10,467
SAY HI TO CODY.

1037
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,067
- IT'LL BLOW YOUR COVER,

1038
