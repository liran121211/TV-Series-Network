- HE'S CALLING ME OVER.

00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,334
- OFFICER MANZON,
GO TO HIM.

6
00:00:14,334 --> 00:00:15,868
- LIEUTENANT, NO,
THIS IS A PROBLEM.

7
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,067
THESE GUYS ARE DANGEROUS.

8
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:19,868
- STAND DOWN, MORGAN.

00:00:19,868 --> 00:00:21,434

00:00:24,467 --> 00:00:25,501

[gunshot]

14
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,334
- OUR INFORMANT,
YASMIN ARAGON,

15
00:00:29,334 --> 00:00:30,567
WAS SHOT AND KILLED.

16
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:31,968
- THIS IS
A FUCKING DISASTER.

17
00:00:31,968 --> 00:00:33,467
- IF MISTAKES WERE MADE,

18
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,801
THEY MOST CERTAINLY
WERE NOT MINE.

19
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:38,200
- I JUST GAVE YOU 500 BUCKS.

20
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,567
- AND I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE GIRL.

21
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:41,501
BUT IF YOU WANT
TO FIND OUT WHO SHE IS,

22
00:00:41,501 --> 00:00:42,801
WHERE SHE'S FROM,

23
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:44,367
AND WHAT SHE'S DOING
IN THAT DAMN HOUSE,

24
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:45,834
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY.

25
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:47,901
- BOYD WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

26
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:49,334
THERE WERE OTHERS.

27
00:00:49,334 --> 00:00:53,501
BESIDES THE ONES THAT
WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF,

28
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:54,834
SUIT AND TIE.

29
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:56,100
HE'D TAKE OFF HIS JACKET

30
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,601
AND FOLD IT VERY CAREFULLY,

31
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,467
LIKE HE DIDN'T
WANT TO MESS IT UP.

32
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,634
- SOMEONE TRIED TO MOVE
THE GIRLS IN THE BARRELS.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,167
- WHERE'S THE DRIVER?
- HE TOOK OFF.

34
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,100
- THAT MEANS
HE'S STILL MINE TO FIND.

35
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,067
- YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GUESS
WHO THIS TRUCK IS REGISTERED TO.

36
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,000
- JORDAN CHASE.

37
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,701
NICE TO MEET YOU.

38
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:15,767
- DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

39
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:20,234
- THAT'S THE GUY
WHO FOLDED HIS JACKET.

40
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:21,567
- HIS NAME'S COLE HARMON.

41
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:24,467
HE'S JORDAN CHASE'S
HEAD OF SECURITY.

42
00:01:24,467 --> 00:01:26,033
THAT'S COLE.
- AND BOYD.

43
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:27,200
- AND DAN THE DENTIST.

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,767
- IT'S THEM
FROM, LIKE, 15 YEARS AGO.

45
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,901
- WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

46

00:03:34,701 --> 00:03:37,701
CONCEIVED WITH THE IMPULSE
TO FIGHT...

53
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:40,367
[eagle shrieks]
FOR WHAT WE DESIRE.

54
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:48,534
IT'S WRITTEN IN OUR GENES.

55
00:03:48,534 --> 00:03:52,767
IT'S ENGRAVED IN OUR SOULS.

56
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,901
BUT WE'VE TRADED
THE WILDERNESS FOR PAVEMENT,

57
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:58,267
TREES FOR SKYSCRAPERS.

58
00:03:58,267 --> 00:04:01,267
WE'VE LOST TOUCH
WITH OUR INSTINCTS,

59
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:04,300
WITH WHAT WE ARE.

60
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,667
WE HAVE FALLEN
FROM NATURE'S GRACE.

61
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,901
BUT WE SHALL BE DELIVERED!

00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:13,667
[wild cheering]

63
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,968
IT'S TIME TO TAP
INTO YOUR PRIMAL SELVES

64
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:25,667
AND SEIZE THE POWER
OF INSTINCT.

65
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,200
WE'RE GONNA CAST OFF
THOSE SHACKLES

66
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,667

PEOPLE WE DON'T LOVE,

WORTH LIVING.

IT'S TIME TO TAP
INTO MY PRIMAL SELF.

- LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA!

92
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:21,667
- LIEUTENANT,
MULTIPLE ROUNDS WERE FIRED

93
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,567
AT THE RECENT
CLUB MAYAN SHOOTOUT.

94
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,033
WAS MIAMI METRO RESPONSIBLE

95
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,100
FOR THE DEATHS
OF INNOCENT BYSTANDERS?

96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,501
- I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
AT THIS TIME.

97
00:05:28,501 --> 00:05:29,801
EXCUSE ME.

98
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,167
- DO YOU AGREE
WITH THE MAYOR'S ASSESSMENT?

99
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,067
DID THIS OPERATION NEEDLESSLY
PUT PEOPLE AT RISK?

100
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,267
- EVERY UNDERCOVER OPERATION
IS HIGH RISK.

101
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:36,801
- IS THERE GOING TO BE
AN INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION

102
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:38,367
OF THE SHOOTING?
- NO COMMENT.

103
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,834
- HAVE YOU PERSONALLY
RETAINED COUNSEL?

104
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,033
- COUNSEL?

105
00:05:42,033 --> 00:05:43,567
- ISN'T IT TRUE
THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES

106
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:47,067
HAVE FILED A CIVIL LAWSUIT?

107
00:05:47,067 --> 00:05:48,567
- LET ME THROUGH.
EXCUSE ME.

108
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:50,067
LET ME THROUGH.

109
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:53,901
- LIEUTENANT LAGUERTA
NEITHER CONFIRMING NOR DENYING

MIAMI METRO'S CULPABILITY

111
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,133
IN THE RECENT CLUB MAYAN
SHOOTOUT.

112
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:00,133
AS WE KNOW, TWO INNOCENT PEOPLE
ARE DEAD, SIX...

113
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,133
[mutes sound]

114
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:02,601
- DID BALLISTICS COME IN?

115
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:04,367
- IT'S GOOD NEWS.
BULLETS FROM THE VICTIMS' BODIES

116
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,534
BELONG TO THE FUENTES BROTHERS,
NOT US.

117
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,901
- THAT IS GOOD NEWS.

118
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,467
BUT THIS IS FAR FROM OVER.

119
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:12,033
I'M SURE YOU ALL HEARD
THE MAYOR'S STATEMENT.

120
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:14,667
- A PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW SHIT
JUST ROLLS DOWNHILL.

121
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,767
- HE SHOULD HAVE
KEPT HIS MOUTH SHUT

122
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:17,100
UNTIL ALL
THE FACTS CAME OUT.

123
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,567
- HE WAS RIGHT.
THIS OPERATION WAS TOO RISKY.

124
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,200
AND NOW BECAUSE OF US,

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,300
TWO INNOCENT PEOPLE
ARE DEAD.

126
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,400
- NOT BY OUR BULLETS.

127
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,300
- SHOTS WOULD HAVE
NEVER BEEN FIRED

128
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,133
IF WE HADN'T BEEN SET UP
ON THAT CLUB.

129
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:29,234
THOSE ARE THE FACTS.

130
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:30,968
- ON THE UPSIDE,
CARLOS FUENTES IS DEAD,

131
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:35,634
- NONE OF US
SHOULD HAVE ANY ILLUSIONS.

132
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:37,234
THERE ARE GONNA BE
CONSEQUENCES.

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,801
- YEAH, I'VE SEEN
THAT LOOK ON HER FACE BEFORE.

134
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:47,100
SOMEONE'S ABOUT
TO GET BENT OVER AND FUCKED.

135
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,634
- IT'S GONNA BE ME,
ISN'T IT?

136
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:50,067
I SCREWED UP.

137
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,033
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.
YOU WERE FOLLOWING ORDERS.

138
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:54,067
LAGUERTA'S ORDERS,
JUST LIKE THE REST OF US.

139
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,734
THAT'S WHAT YOU PUT
IN YOUR REPORT, RIGHT?

140
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:57,300
YOU WERE FOLLOWING HER LEAD?

141
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,334
- I HAVEN'T WRITTEN IT YET.

142
00:06:59,334 --> 00:07:01,534
I'M STILL SORTING
THROUGH THE EVENTS IN MY MIND.

143
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,400
- SORTING THROUGH WHAT
EXACTLY?

144
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,834
- WHAT I'M GONNA
SAY ABOUT THEM.

145
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:06,667
- HERE'S A CRAZY IDEA.
HOW ABOUT THE TRUTH?

146
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:08,667
- DEB, I'M ON IT.
[elevator bell rings]

147
00:07:18,234 --> 00:07:21,100
- WHO'S THAT?
- IT'S YASMIN'S MOTHER.

148
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,300
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

149
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,934
- THREE PEOPLE ARE DEAD--

150
00:07:26,934 --> 00:07:28,934
CARLOS FUENTES
AND TWO GIRLS.

151
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:30,834
NOBODY'S CRYING ABOUT CARLOS.

152
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,267
- FUENTES WAS A SCUMBAG.

153
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,000
- YEAH, HE'S A SCUMBAG
THAT I SHOT AND KILLED.

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,601
- AND?

155
00:07:36,601 --> 00:07:38,200
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

156
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,033
DON'T TELL ME YOU FEEL BAD
ABOUT KILLING HIM.

157
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:44,834
- I DON'T.

158
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,601
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

159
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,767
- YASMIN
DIDN'T FEEL ANY PAIN.

160
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:03,033
SHE DIED INSTANTLY.

161
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:10,300
- I'M READY.

162
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,234
- OKAY.

163
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,667
[sobbing]

164
00:08:22,767 --> 00:08:24,834
- I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS
FOR EVERYONE.

165
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,534
- [sighs]

166
00:08:26,534 --> 00:08:29,767
- YOU'RE ALL GOING TO DIE.

167
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,267
Dexter: SOME OF US
SOONER THAN OTHERS.

168
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:33,567
- SOME OF US SOONER
THAN OTHERS.

169
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,267
AND IF YOU'RE NOT IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR PRIMAL SELF,

170
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:38,033
YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD.

171
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:40,200
YOU MAY BE BREATHING
AND WALKING AROUND,

172
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,868
BUT YOU'RE AN EMPTY SHELL,
JUST ONE OF THE HERD,

173
00:08:42,868 --> 00:08:46,300
COMPLETELY UNAWARE
OF WHAT YOU TRULY WANT.

174
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,000
AND WHEN WE COME BACK,

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,968
WE'RE GONNA START USING
YOUR INSTINCTS

176
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:52,767
TO DESIGN THE LIFE
THAT YOU DESERVE,

177
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:55,133
FUEL THE PASSION
TO MAKE IT REAL,

178
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,667
AND FIND THE POWER...

179
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,667
TO TAKE IT.

180
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:02,567
[cheers and applause]

181
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:05,334
female announcer: JORDAN CHASE'S

WILL RESUME AT 2:00 P.M.

183
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:10,834

184
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,100
Dexter:
JORDAN PROMISES CHANGE,

185
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,434
BUT HE ALSO
ACCEPTS CREDIT CARDS.

186
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:20,834
[cell phone vibrating]

187
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:21,868
LUMEN?

188
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:23,033
- CAN YOU TALK?

189
00:09:23,033 --> 00:09:26,000
OR ARE YOU ABOUT TO HAVE
A MAJOR LIFE REVELATION?

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,834
- NO, THAT CAME
AROUND 9:00 A.M.

191
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:29,701
WHEN I REALIZED
I REALLY WANTED A DOUGHNUT.

192
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,767
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

193
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:33,334
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO FIND OUT

194
00:09:33,334 --> 00:09:35,133
HOW THESE GUYS
KNOW EACH OTHER.

195
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,701
THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN
WHEN THEY WERE TEENAGERS, BUT...

196
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,033
- DID YOU CHECK HIGH SCHOOLS?

197
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:42,100
- COLE WENT TO WESTLAND PREP
IN HIALEAH,

198
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,634
AND DAN THE DENTIST
WENT TO

199
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:46,000
ST. JOSEPH'S ACADEMY
IN CORAL GABLES.

200
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,234
BOYD...
THERE'S NOTHING ON BOYD.

201
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:49,834
- YEAH,
HE PROBABLY NEVER SAW

202
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,567
THE INSIDE OF
TOO MANY CLASSROOMS.

203
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,200
- I WAS ABLE TO FIND OUT
SOMETHING ELSE ABOUT COLE.

204
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,234
- WHAT?
- HE WAS IN THE MARINES.

205
00:09:56,234 --> 00:09:58,767
HE GOT BOUNCED
ON DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE.

206
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,234
HE BEAT UP
A SUPERIOR OFFICER

207
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,634
AND PUT HIM
IN THE HOSPITAL.

208
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,300
THIS IS
A DANGEROUS GUY, DEXTER.

209
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,534
DO YOU REMEMBER THE MARKS
I HAD ON MY BACK?

210
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:08,367
THAT WAS COLE.

211
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,501
SO BE CAREFUL.

212
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:12,300
- YOU GETTING ANY REST?

213
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:18,434
- I FALL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
FROM 1:00 TO 1:15 EVERY MORNING.

214
00:10:18,434 --> 00:10:21,400
WHEN THIS IS OVER,
I EXPECT TO SLEEP FOR A YEAR.

215
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:25,567
- I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

216
00:10:25,567 --> 00:10:27,501
- MR. MORGAN.
COLE HARMON.

217
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,334
I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER ME
FROM OUR VISIT TO THE STATION.

218
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,200
MR. CHASE SPOTTED YOU
FROM THE STAGE.

219
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,667
HE'S VERY INTERESTED
IN SPEAKING WITH YOU.

220
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,067
HE WAS WONDERING
IF YOU'D JOIN HIM

221
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,234
IN HIS SUITE
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

222
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:38,167
- UH...OKAY.

223
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,234
WHEN?

224
00:10:39,234 --> 00:10:40,434
- HOW ABOUT RIGHT NOW?

225
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:47,400
ALL THE WAY TO THE END.

226
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,767
TURN RIGHT.

227
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,334
[lock beeps]

228
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,734
- I'M DISGUSTED,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

229
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:11,934
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LISTENING
TO A WORD I'VE SAID.

230
00:11:11,934 --> 00:11:13,334
[door closes]

231
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:16,067
CALL ME BACK WHEN YOU STOP
BEING A PIECE OF FURNITURE.

232
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,133
[Bluetooth beeps]
- SORRY.

233
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:19,701
NEW CLIENT.

234
00:11:19,701 --> 00:11:21,267
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN,
MR. MORGAN,

235
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:23,033
ESPECIALLY UNDER
BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES.

236
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,133
- CALL ME DEXTER.

237
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,334
- JORDAN.

238
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,634
CAN I OFFER YOU A DRINK?

239
00:11:26,634 --> 00:11:29,834
- UH, NO, THANKS.
I'M GOOD.

240
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:31,467
- THINK I KNOW WHY YOU'RE HERE.
- YOU DO?

241
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:34,901
- YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR A WAY
TO COPE WITH YOUR LOSS.

242
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:36,334
I KNOW YOUR HISTORY,
DEXTER.

243
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:38,801
I THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED YOU
WHEN WE MET AT THE STATION,

244
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:40,801
BUT IT HIT ME LATER ON.

245
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,033
YOU WIFE WAS MURDERED.

246
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:43,701
- YES.

247
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,067
- THEY ANY CLOSER
TO CATCHING TRINITY?

248
00:11:46,868 --> 00:11:48,334
- NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

249
00:11:48,334 --> 00:11:50,634
- I FOLLOWED THAT CASE
VERY CLOSELY.

250
00:11:50,634 --> 00:11:52,567
TRINITY--A RELIGIOUS MAN,

251
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:54,467
FAMILY, GOOD LIFE.

252
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,701
YET HE WAS WORKING
THROUGH SUCH RAGE,

253
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:58,634
HARBORING
SO MANY SECRETS.

254
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,567
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
HE FASCINATED ME

255
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:01,801
ON A DEEP LEVEL.

256
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:04,000
- WHAT ELSE DO JORDAN
AND I HAVE IN COMMON?

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,033
- I CERTAINLY DON'T MEAN
TO IMPLY ANY SYMPATHY FOR HIM.

258
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:11,067
HE'S A MONSTER,
NO QUESTION.

259
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,000
I CAN'T IMAGINE
YOUR FRUSTRATION,

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,234
KNOWING HE'S OUT THERE,
UNPUNISHED.

261
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,234
- IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

262
00:12:18,234 --> 00:12:20,167
- NO DOUBT.

263
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,400
- AND NOW YOU'RE
A SINGLE FATHER,

264
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,334
WHICH HAS ITS OWN SET
OF CHALLENGES.

265
00:12:27,534 --> 00:12:29,033
- WHY DID YOU
WANT TO SEE ME?

266
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,734
- I'VE DEVELOPED A THEORY
ON HOW THE PRIMAL SELF

267
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,901
DEALS WITH TRAGEDY.

268
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,033
[exhales]

269
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:37,100
I HAVE TO PREPARE
FOR THE NEXT SESSION,

270
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,968
BUT I AM VERY INTERESTED
IN WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

271
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,234
I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS
YOUR SITUATION IN DEPTH

272
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:43,367
AT ANOTHER TIME
IF YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT.

273
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:46,100
- OKAY.

274
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,501
- OKAY.

275
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,367
BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU MADE
ANY PROGRESS ON BOYD FOWLER?

276
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:52,467
- I'M NOT REALLY AWARE
OF ALL THE DETAILS.

277
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,534
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SPEAK TO
ONE OF THE DETECTIVES.

278
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,033
- OF COURSE.

279
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:57,968
I LOOK FORWARD
TO OUR NEXT TALK.

280
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,934
THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING
IN THERE FOR HARRISON.

281
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:12,934
- THANKS.

282
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,634
- YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

283
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,133
- CLOSE THE DOOR.

284
00:13:32,234 --> 00:13:34,234
- [sighs]

285
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:36,968
YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF HEAT
COMING DOWN ON US,

286
00:13:36,968 --> 00:13:39,667
AND THE PUBLIC'S
DEMANDING BLOOD, OUR BLOOD.

287
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:42,934
MATTHEWS WANTS
SOMEONE'S HEAD.

288
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:45,000
- SOUNDS LIKE
SANTA MUERTE'S CATCHING ON.

289
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,467
- I'M PUTTING CIRA MANZON
ON DISCIPLINARY LEAVE.

290
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:51,267
- WHAT?

291
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,968
- I NEED TO PUT
A FACE ON IT.

292
00:13:52,968 --> 00:13:54,601
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR FACE?

293
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,634
- DETECTIVE--

294
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,300
- YOU CAN'T PIN THIS
ON HER.

295
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,033
- HER ACTIONS PRECIPITATED
THE SHOOTING.

296
00:14:00,033 --> 00:14:01,467
- SHE WASN'T EVEN
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

297
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,267
I TRIED TO TAKE HER OFF,
AND YOU WOULDN'T LET ME.

298
00:14:03,267 --> 00:14:04,300
- THAT'S YOUR IMPRESSION.

299
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,367
- NO, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

300
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:09,467
LOOK, I WAS
THE DETECTIVE IN CHARGE,

301
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:12,167
SO IF YOU WANT TO FUCK
SOMEBODY OVER,

302
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:13,300
HERE'S YOUR SCAPEGOAT.

303
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,033
- I KNOW YOUR INSTINCT

304
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:16,667
IS TO TAKE THE FALL
FOR YOUR TEAM.

305
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,234
- YOU WERE ON MY TEAM.

306
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,901
IN FACT, YOU FUCKIN'
TOOK OVER MY TEAM,

307
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,367
AND I HAD YOUR BACK,
'CAUSE YOUR TEAM,

308
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,133
MY TEAM, WHATEVER,
IT'S ALL THE FUCKIN' SAME.

309
00:14:24,133 --> 00:14:26,167
- CIRA'S JUST STARTING OUT.

310
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:29,234
HER CAREER WILL TAKE
THE SMALLEST HIT.

311
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,167
SHE'LL RECOVER QUICKLY.

312
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,534
- IF SOMETHING LIKE THAT
HAD HAPPENED TO ME BACK THEN,

313
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:35,234
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
MADE DETECTIVE.

314
00:14:35,234 --> 00:14:37,968
WE WERE ALL THERE TOGETHER.

315
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:40,367
SO WHY CAN'T
WE JUST HOLD TIGHT

316
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:43,801
AND WEATHER
THE FUCKIN' STORM TOGETHER?

317
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,267
FUCKIN' THINK ABOUT IT.

318
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,067
[door opens and closes]

319
00:14:57,701 --> 00:14:59,667
[cell phone rings]

320
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,868
- DOES YOUR PRINTER
EVER WORK?

321
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:03,968
- LU?

322
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:09,400
- OWEN.

323
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,534
- HOW ARE YOU?

324
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,167
- UM...

325
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,200
UM...

326
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
- I BET YOU'RE TAN.

327
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,334
THE SUN FEELS CLOSER HERE,

328
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,300
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT ACTUALLY
PHYSICALLY IS NOT,

329
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,267
IT FEELS LIKE
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

330
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:24,567
- YOU'RE IN MIAMI?

331
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,133
- I GOT A SUNBURN
JUST RENTING THE CAR.

332
00:15:28,667 --> 00:15:31,100
I CAME TO SEE YOU.

333
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,801
- YOU DID?

334
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,734
- LU, I'VE RESPECTED
YOUR WISHES.

335
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:35,968
SINCE THE DAY
OF THE WEDDING,

336
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,067
I HAVEN'T CALLED,
I HAVEN'T EMAILED,

337
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,334
I HAVEN'T EVEN TEXTED.

338
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:41,234
IT'S LIKE MY LIFE
STOPPED THAT DAY

339
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:42,601
WHEN YOU LEFT,

340
00:15:42,601 --> 00:15:45,234
AND I NEED TO GET UNSTUCK.

341
00:15:45,234 --> 00:15:48,601
I FEEL THE WAY TO DO THAT
IS TO SEE YOU, FACE-TO-FACE,

342
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:51,200
WITHOUT 75 OF OUR CLOSEST
FRIENDS AND FAMILY

343
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,467
STARING AT US.

344
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,234
PLEASE, WILL YOU SEE ME?

345
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,033
- I...
[clears throat]

346
00:16:01,033 --> 00:16:02,400
I CAN'T TONIGHT.

347
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,501
- TOMORROW.

00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,667
I'M STAYING AT
THE BLUE PELICAN MOTEL.

351
00:16:10,667 --> 00:16:12,100
THERE'S A CAFE
ACROSS THE STREET.

352
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,767
MEET ME THERE TOMORROW
AT NOON, OKAY?

353
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,567
- OKAY, NOON.

354
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,467
[phone beeps]

355
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:18,801
- HEY.

356
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:20,300
- HEY.

357
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,667
- I GOT YOU SOME SUPPER.

358
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:23,734
HOT AND SOUR SOUP,
FRIED RICE WITH TOFU.

359
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,400
THAT'S WHAT YOU LIKE,
RIGHT?

360
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,734
- YEAH, IT'S FINE.

361
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:31,634
- NO, I'M NOT STAYING.

362
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:33,901
- OH, RIGHT.

363
00:16:33,901 --> 00:16:35,234
HARRISON.

364
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:39,767
- YOU'RE TIRED.

365
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,767
- I SPENT THE ENTIRE DAY

366
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,534
STARING AT THAT LAPTOP,

367
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:46,367
AND I GOT EXACTLY NOWHERE.

368
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,801
- WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS

369
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,968
YOU WON'T BE
ON THAT COMPUTER TOMORROW.

370
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,467
I HAVE SOMETHING
I NEED YOU TO DO.

371
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:52,767
- WHAT?

372
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,300
- SHOPPING.
- WHAT KIND OF SHOPPING?

373
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,667
- SUPPLIES.
WE HAVE TO MAKE A ROOM

374
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:59,400
WHERE COLE
WILL BE DISPATCHED.

375
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,267
IT HAS TO BE COVERED
IN PLASTIC.

376
00:17:01,267 --> 00:17:03,868
SO DOES COLE.

377
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:07,501
- TO CATCH THE BLOOD.

378
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:10,067
- I MADE A LIST.

379
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:14,868
DUCT TAPE, 30 YARDS
OF CLEAR POLYETHYLENE SHEETING.

380
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:17,601
- AND GARBAGE BAGS,
THREE MIL, BLACK.

381
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:20,634
- WHEN ARE YOU
GONNA DO IT?

382
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,234
- TOMORROW.

383
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,300
I BOOKED A ROOM
RIGHT NEXT TO COLE'S.

384
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,033
- YOU'RE GONNA DO IT
IN THE HOTEL?

385
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:27,734
- NO CHOICE.

386
00:17:27,734 --> 00:17:30,067
JORDAN'S NEXT GIG
IS IN SARASOTA.

387
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,501
HE AND COLE WILL BE
HITTING THE ROAD

388
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:34,601
RIGHT AFTER
THE SEMINAR ENDS.

389
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:37,234
- SO...

390
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:39,968
TOMORROW NIGHT'S
THE NIGHT.

391
00:17:39,968 --> 00:17:41,634
- THERE'S A PARKING LOT
RIGHT ON THE CORNER

392
00:17:41,634 --> 00:17:43,167
OF FOURTH AND BAY.

393
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,634
MEET ME THERE
TOMORROW AT NOON,

394
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:46,033
AND I'LL PICK UP
THE SUPPLIES.

395
00:17:46,033 --> 00:17:49,000
- 1:00 WOULD BE BETTER,

396
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,400
JUST SO I HAVE
ENOUGH TIME TO SHOP.

397
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,767
- SURE.

398
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,534
WHAT?

399
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,501
- A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS
SHOPPING FOR A WEDDING DRESS,

400
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,067
AND NOW I'M SHOPPING FOR...

401
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:05,601
30 YARDS
OF POLYETHYLENE SHEETING.

402
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,033
IT'S CRAZY, ISN'T IT,

403
00:18:07,033 --> 00:18:11,367
HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN GET USED TO
THE SUPREMELY WEIRD?

404
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:14,300
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

405
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,767
- THANKS FOR COVERING.
- NO PROBLEM.

406
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:27,534
SONYA JUST LEFT.

407
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,501
UGH. JORDAN CHASE.

408
00:18:32,501 --> 00:18:36,634
I KNOW YOU'RE HURTING,
SO I'LL RESERVE JUDGMENT,

409
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,300
BUT I GOTTA DRAW
THE LINE SOMEWHERE.

410
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,000
- IT WAS FREE.

411
00:18:43,167 --> 00:18:44,267
IT CAN'T HURT, CAN IT?

412
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:45,667
MAYBE I'LL COME AWAY
WITH SOMETHING.

413
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,701
- YEAH, A REALLY UGLY ONESIE.

414
00:18:47,701 --> 00:18:49,434
I DON'T KNOW.

415
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:52,400
IF IT'S WORKING, WHO AM I
TO POOP ON YOUR PARADE?

416
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,234
- AND YOUR DAY?

417
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:59,033
- I'VE GOT SIX MANDATORY
SESSIONS WITH A SHRINK

418
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:03,267
COMING AT ME
BECAUSE OF CARLOS FUENTES.

419
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,734
FEELS LIKE A BIG, FAT
FUCKING WASTE OF TIME TOO.

420
00:19:05,734 --> 00:19:07,501
I MEAN, I'D KILL THAT FUCKTARD
ALL OVER AGAIN.

421
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,834
I'D EMPTY
A FUCKING MAGAZINE IN HIM.

422
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:15,334
OKAY.

423
00:19:15,334 --> 00:19:20,100
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING
WORTH TALKING ABOUT.

424
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,133
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IF I LANDED A BULLET

425
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:26,534
THAT IT WOULD BOTHER ME,

426
00:19:26,534 --> 00:19:29,534
THAT IT WOULD...

427
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:32,701
IT WOULD BE A BURDEN
TO TAKE ANOTHER LIFE.

428
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,767
THEY DON'T ISSUE GUNS
TO LAB GEEKS,

429
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,567
SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

430
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:43,000
- I CAN IMAGINE.

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,467
- I DON'T FEEL BAD.

432
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:46,400
ME, OF ALL PEOPLE.

433
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,868
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.

434
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,734
MAYBE I'VE JUST RUN OUT.

435
00:19:57,734 --> 00:20:01,434
- DAD ONCE TOLD ME THAT...

436
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:03,367
SOME PEOPLE
DESERVE TO DIE.

437
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:10,467
- YOU BELIEVE THAT?

438
00:20:10,467 --> 00:20:12,567
YOU BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE
DESERVE TO DIE?

439
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:17,100
- SOME PEOPLE DON'T
DESERVE TO LIVE.

440
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,400
- TRINITY SHOULD BE DEAD.

441
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,467
NOT RITA, NOT LUNDY.

442
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,934
MAYBE THE WORLD
IS BETTER OFF

443
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:29,067
WITHOUT CARLOS FUENTES.

444
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,834
- I'D PRETTY MUCH
GIVEN UP HOPE.

445
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:39,567
I FIGURED I WAS DESTINED
TO GO THROUGH LIFE ALONE,

446
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:41,267
AND THEN I STARTED LISTENING
TO ONE OF YOUR CDs.

447
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:42,868
- <i>THE PRIMAL SELF?</i>

448
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,434
- I STARTED LISTENING
IN THE CAR ON THE WAY TO WORK.

449
00:20:45,434 --> 00:20:48,100
THREE WEEKS LATER,
I MET MY SOUL MATE,

450
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,467
AND NOW WE HAVE
A BABY ON THE WAY!

451
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:51,367
[cheers and applause]

452
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:52,567
- COME ON UP HERE.

453
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:54,100
- COME ON!
COME ON, HONEY!

454
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,901
Dexter: COLE WILL BE
AT HIS POST

455
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:05,234
FOR THE REST
OF THE SESSION.

456
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:08,100
THAT GIVES ME AN HOUR.

457
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:15,100
[lock beeps]

458
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:38,634
[aerosol hissing]

459
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,834
I'LL HAVE TO DO THIS
IN THE DARK.

460
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,834
14 STEPS TO THE PILLOW,

461
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,901
GIVE HIM THE NEEDLE,
AND DRAG HIM TO MY ROOM.

462
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:49,167
60 SECONDS TOPS.

463
00:21:54,334 --> 00:21:57,267
JORDAN'S ABOUT TO LOSE
HIS NUMBER ONE FAN.

464
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:11,934
- OH.
- SORRY.

465
00:22:11,934 --> 00:22:13,100
- NO, NO, IT'S ME.

466
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,200
REALLY.

467
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,467
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

468
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:19,667
- I DON'T, REALLY.

469
00:22:19,667 --> 00:22:20,767
- YOU DO.

470
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:23,033
YOU ALWAYS DO.

471
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,200
MIAMI SUITS YOU.
- [scoffs]

472
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,367
- YOU MUST LOVE
ALL THESE ART DECO BUILDINGS.

473
00:22:31,367 --> 00:22:33,767
- CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF 'EM.

474
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,634
- STEPH HAD HER BABY.

475
00:22:38,634 --> 00:22:40,000
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

476
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,734
SHE WAS DUE LAST MONTH.

477
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:45,968
- YES. MEET MAVIS.

478
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:47,734
- LOOK AT HER.

479
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,367
MAVIS?

480
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:50,767
- MARK'S GRANDMOTHER.

481
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:52,534
THE NAME CAME DOWN
TO MAVIS OR MADISON.

482
00:22:52,534 --> 00:22:53,701
- MADISON.

483
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:55,133
YOUR NIECE COULD
HAVE BEEN NAMED

484
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:58,400
AFTER THE CITY WHERE YOU AND I
DID OUR SUNDAY BEER RUNS.

485
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,534
- COOLER HEADS PREVAILED--
MINE.

486
00:23:00,534 --> 00:23:03,334
- HOW IS STEPH DOING?

487
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:04,767
- SHE'S TIRED,

488
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,667
GLAD TO NOT BE PREGNANT
ANYMORE,

489
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,367
CRIES AT COMMERCIALS...

490
00:23:08,367 --> 00:23:12,934
AND IS
TRANSCENDENTLY HAPPY.

491
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,601
YOUR PARENTS MISS YOU.

492
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,267
THEY'D LIKE TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE SAFE.

493
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:20,534
- YOU CAN TELL THEM.

494
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:24,067
- WELL, I'M THINKING
OF NOT GOING BACK TOO.

495
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:26,868
- WHAT?
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

496
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:29,067
WE WERE TRAPPED IN OUR JOBS,
TRAPPED IN THAT CITY.

497
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:30,934
WE'D HAVE BEEN TRAPPED
IN A LIFE WE DIDN'T WANT.

498
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:35,133
IT'S TIME
FOR THAT TO CHANGE.

499
00:23:35,133 --> 00:23:38,033
- OWEN?
- LU...

500
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:39,968
I BOUGHT THESE
ROUND THE WORLD TICKETS.

501
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:41,334
BROKE THE BANK.

502
00:23:41,334 --> 00:23:44,067
WE CAN LITERALLY HOP ON
AND HOP OFF IN ANY CITY.

503
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:46,667
I LOVE YOU.

504
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:50,234
NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO,
WHOEVER YOU ARE,

505
00:23:50,234 --> 00:23:52,067
I WANT TO TAKE
THIS JOURNEY WITH YOU.

506
00:23:57,701 --> 00:23:59,467
HAVE YOU MET SOMEONE?

507
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:01,334
- I'VE MET
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE,

508
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:03,801
BUT NOT
LIKE YOU'RE THINKING.

509
00:24:03,801 --> 00:24:06,267
I CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

510
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:10,300
- ME SHOWING UP LIKE THIS
IS SUDDEN, I KNOW.

511
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,367
WE HAD FIVE YEARS.

512
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,767
TAKE A NIGHT
TO THINK IT OVER.

513
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:19,667
I'M GOING EITHER WAY,
BUT I'D RATHER GO WITH YOU.

514
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,234
MEET ME HERE
TOMORROW NIGHT

515
00:24:22,234 --> 00:24:25,167
AND TELL ME
YOUR DECISION.

516
00:24:27,801 --> 00:24:29,667
- GOD FUCKING DAMN IT.

517
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,767
- WHAT IS IT?
- UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE.

518
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:33,434
- LIEUTENANT,
WILL THERE BE ANY OTHER--

519
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:34,934
- I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOUR SOURCES ARE,

520
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,834
BUT I CAN CONFIRM
THAT DETECTIVE MORGAN

521
00:24:36,834 --> 00:24:38,434
WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE OPERATION.

522
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:39,767
- HOLY SHIT.

523
00:24:39,767 --> 00:24:41,334
- SHE'S BLAMING
EVERYTHING ON ME.

524
00:24:41,334 --> 00:24:42,901
- IS IT TRUE
THAT DETECTIVE MORGAN

525
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:44,501
HAS BEEN PLACED
ON DISCIPLINARY LEAVE?

526
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,601
- AS OF TODAY,
SHE'S BEING PLACED

527
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:48,634
ON IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION
WITH PAY,

528
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:50,367
PENDING THE RESULTS OF--

529
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:52,367
- WHOA! NOT THE PLASMA.

530
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,734
- EXCUSE ME.

531
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:55,267
- I THOUGHT WE WERE
ACTUALLY FRIENDS.

532
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:58,200
- DEB, WAIT.

533
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,100
- I CAN'T DO IT.

534
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,601
I CAN'T LET HER THROW ME
UNDER THE BUS

535
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:03,000
AND DRIVE OVER ME,

536
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,100
THEN BACK UP A FEW FUCKIN' TIMES
AND DRIVE OFF.

537
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,400
[engine starts]

538
00:25:19,834 --> 00:25:20,767
[crash]

539
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:26,067
- FUCK! SHIT! FUCK!

540
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,667
DIDN'T YOU
SEE ME DRIVING UP?

541
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:29,067
- DIDN'T YOU SEE ME
BACKING OUT?

542
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,167
- YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A REASON

543
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:33,534
WHY CARS
HAVE REARVIEW MIRRORS, LADY!

544
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:35,534
I MEAN, SHIT,
LOOK AT THAT.

545
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,400
THIS HERE'S FIBERGLASS.
CAN'T POUND THAT OUT.

546
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,067
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PULL
THAT WHOLE QUARTER PANEL OFF.

547
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,701
- HOW DO I KNOW
IT WASN'T ALREADY THERE?

548
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:43,801
- YOU JUST HIT MY CAR.

549
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:47,067
- I WAS DISTRACTED.
JUST LET ME GIVE YOU SOME CASH.

550
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:49,300
- NO CASH!
I DON'T WANT CASH!

551
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,834
WE'LL DO THIS
ON THE UP-AND-UP,

552
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,234
'CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND
OF GUY I AM.

553
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:54,934
WE JUST LET THE INSURANCE DUDES
HASH THIS OUT.

554
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:56,601
YOU DO HAVE INSURANCE,
DON'T YOU?

555
00:25:56,601 --> 00:26:00,200
- YEAH.
- WELL, HALLE-FUCKIN'-LUJAH.

556
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,167
NOW, LET'S JUST, UH,
TRADE SOME INFO HERE

557
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,868
AND GET THIS SORTED OUT.

558
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:09,400
LOOK, NOW, WE CAN EITHER
DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY,

559
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,901
OR I CAN CALL UP THE PO-LICE,

560
00:26:10,901 --> 00:26:12,167
LET MIAMI'S FINEST
HANDLE IT.

561
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:13,200
IT'S YOUR CALL.
- NO.

562
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,767
NO, NO, NO. I...

563
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:26,567
female announcer: THE JORDAN
CHASE EXPERIENCE SEMINAR

564
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:28,968
WILL RESUME TOMORROW
AT 8:00 A.M. SHARP.

565
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:30,534
VENDORS ARE OPEN TONIGHT
TILL 7:00 P.M.

566
00:26:30,534 --> 00:26:32,767
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

567
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:34,901
Dexter: I GUESS WORKING
FOR JORDAN HAS ITS BENEFITS.

568
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:36,367
[cell phone rings]

569
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:37,400
[beeps]

570
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,601
HELLO?

571
00:26:38,601 --> 00:26:39,767
- I'M HERE.

572
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,167
- I'M ON MY WAY.

573
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,000
- NO, I MEAN,
I'M HERE IN THE LOBBY.

574
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,901
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

575
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,601
- I GOT
INTO A CAR ACCIDENT.

576
00:26:53,601 --> 00:26:55,033
- ARE YOU OKAY?

577
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,834
- YEAH, YEAH.

578
00:26:56,834 --> 00:26:58,200
IT WAS MY FAULT.

579
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,767
ACTUALLY, NO,
IT WAS OWEN'S FAULT.

580
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:03,834
- OWEN WHO?

581
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:06,601
- MY EX-FIANCE.

582
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:09,601
HE'S IN MIAMI.

583
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:12,000
- WHY?

584
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,901
- HE CAME TO SEE ME.

585
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:17,968
DON'T WORRY, I DIDN'T TELL
HIM ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

586
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:20,801
HE ASKED ME
TO GO AWAY WITH HIM.

587
00:27:20,801 --> 00:27:26,067
JUST UP
AND LEAVE ALL THIS BEHIND.

588
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:29,000
[scoffs]

589
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,734
AS IF I COULD.

590
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,968
- YOU COULD, YOU KNOW.

591
00:27:36,601 --> 00:27:38,767
- DO YOU WANT ME TO GO?

592
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,701
- IF YOU WANT TO...

593
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:42,634
GO.

594
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,167
- THIS IS THE ONLY PART
OF MY LIFE

595
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:51,601
THAT MAKES SENSE
ANYMORE.

596
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,868
- WHAT ABOUT OWEN?
- HE'S LEAVING.

597
00:27:53,868 --> 00:27:56,834
- WHEN?
- TOMORROW.

598
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,601
- STAY THE NIGHT.

599
00:28:01,601 --> 00:28:03,133
THE SEMINAR'S
OUT FOR THE DAY,

600
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,834
AND COLE COULD BE ANYWHERE.
HE COULD SEE YOU.

601
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:07,133
IT'S TOO RISKY TO HAVE YOU
WALK THROUGH THE LOBBY AGAIN.

602
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:11,000
- IF I STAY,

603
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,334
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE
NOT GONNA KILL COLE TONIGHT?

604
00:28:13,334 --> 00:28:16,300
- NO, IT'S STILL HAPPENING.

605
00:28:21,234 --> 00:28:23,400
WE'RE GONNA PREPARE
THE ROOM TOGETHER.

606
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:30,968
[lock clicks]

607
00:28:47,834 --> 00:28:50,000
Dexter: THIS IS ALL MUCH EASIER
WITH A PARTNER.

608
00:28:59,334 --> 00:29:00,934
BUT A PARTNER IN WHAT?

609
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:04,634
[door slams]

610
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:06,033
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

611
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:07,467
- I WAS PLANNING TO.

612
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:09,634
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW THE PRESS
GOT HOLD OF IT.

613
00:29:09,634 --> 00:29:11,968
- MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE
YOU FUCKING LEAKED IT.

614
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:13,701
- YOU'LL BE A DESK JOCKEY
FOR A FEW WEEKS,

615
00:29:13,701 --> 00:29:15,968
THEN YOUR UNION REP
WILL HAVE YOU REINSTATED.

616
00:29:15,968 --> 00:29:18,534
THIS TIME NEXT YEAR,
ALL WILL HAVE BLOWN OVER.

617
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:20,400
- IT'S JUST YOUR WORD
AGAINST MINE

618
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,767
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
THAT WAS THERE.

619
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,167
- SOME PEOPLE DON'T AGREE

620
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:25,534
WITH YOUR VERSION
OF THE EVENTS.

621
00:29:25,534 --> 00:29:27,868
- WHO'D YOU GET
TO LIE FOR YOU?

622
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:29,634
BATISTA?

623
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,801
BATISTA'S GONNA BACK
YOUR FUCKIN' STORY?

624
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:33,400
DO I HAVE TO GO
TO MATTHEWS WITH THIS?

625
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,200
- YOU WATCH YOURSELF,
DETECTIVE.

626
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,868
WE WOULDN'T WANT YOUR
REINSTATEMENT TO BE DELAYED.

627
00:29:39,868 --> 00:29:43,100
- GOD.

628
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,567
I WAS FUCKING HAPPY
FOR YOU WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED.

629
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:48,601
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT YOU
BEING WITH BATISTA

630
00:29:48,601 --> 00:29:52,133
MIGHT MAKE YOU
A NICER PERSON.

631
00:29:52,133 --> 00:29:55,801
I NEVER EXPECTED YOU
TO FUCKIN' EAT HIM ALIVE.

632
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:04,601
[plastic rustling]

633
00:30:17,634 --> 00:30:19,834
- COLE'S OTHER VICTIMS.

634
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:22,167
WHY DID YOU PUT
THEIR PICTURES UP?

635
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:25,634
- COLE NEEDS TO SEE
WHAT HE'S DONE.

636
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:27,300
- WHAT DO YOU GET
OUT OF ALL THIS?

637
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,868
- I LIKE KNOWING THAT THE MEN
WHO DID THIS TO YOU

638
00:30:30,868 --> 00:30:34,968
WON'T DO IT TO ANYONE ELSE.

639
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:39,734
- THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

640
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:41,300
- YOU'RE STANDING HERE.

641
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,667
- LOOK AT ALL THIS.

642
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:46,767
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW ME,
YOU'D STILL BE IN THIS ROOM.

643
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,000
BOYD WASN'T YOUR FIRST.

644
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,934
YOU'VE BEEN DOING THIS
A LONG TIME.

645
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,501
[door opens]

646
00:31:01,501 --> 00:31:04,901
- IT'S COLE.

647
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:06,834
WE'LL WAIT FOR HIM
TO GO TO SLEEP,

648
00:31:06,834 --> 00:31:09,234
THEN YOU TAKE OFF
AND I GRAB HIM.

649
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:10,701
- WHAT'S THAT?

650
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:14,067
- M-99.
ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER.

651
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:17,234
GIVES ME A FEW HOURS
TO WRAP HIS BODY IN PLASTIC

652
00:31:17,234 --> 00:31:18,868
AND SECURE HIM
TO THIS DESK.

653
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:21,868
- YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM
WHILE HE'S STILL OUT?

654
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:23,234
- NO, I'M GONNA WAKE HIM UP,

655
00:31:23,234 --> 00:31:24,801
SEE IF HE'LL GIVE UP
THE OTHER TWO NAMES

656
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,067
OF THE MEN
IN THE PICTURES.

657
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:28,834
MY KNIFE CAN BE
VERY PERSUASIVE.

658
00:31:28,834 --> 00:31:30,200
[woman screams]

659
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,901
STAY HERE.

660

[screaming,

- OWW!

663
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,834
TIE MY OTHER ARM!

664
00:31:44,834 --> 00:31:47,334
DO IT NOW!

665
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:49,200
UNH! YES!

666
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
OHH! OHH!

667
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,400
OHH!

668
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,968
YES!

669
00:31:54,968 --> 00:31:58,701
OH, GOD! OH!

00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,734
[softly crying]

674
00:32:07,734 --> 00:32:10,367
NO.

675
00:32:10,367 --> 00:32:12,234
NO!

00:32:12,234 --> 00:32:13,567
[woman screaming]

677
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,367
[Lumen's screams fade in]

678
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:20,234
NO! [screams]

679
00:32:20,234 --> 00:32:21,901
NO MORE! PLEASE!

680
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:24,300
NO! [screams]

681
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,634
NO! NO!

682
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:28,000
NO! NO!

683
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,767
NO! LET ME GO!

684
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:32,200
NO! LET ME OUT OF HERE!

685
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,100
[screams fade]

686
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,868
[Lumen breathing]

687
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,167
WHAT HAPPENED?

688
00:32:57,167 --> 00:32:58,567
- YOU FELL ASLEEP.

689
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,901
- WHAT ABOUT COLE?

690
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:04,934
- HE'S BACK
AT THE SEMINAR BY NOW.

691
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:07,367
THE SCREAMER
SPENT THE NIGHT.

692
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:08,868
- SO YOU'RE
NOT GONNA KILL HIM?

693
00:33:08,868 --> 00:33:10,701
- NO, I AM.

694
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:13,133
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT.

695
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,467
COLE MAKES HIS SECURITY ROUNDS
AT EVERY SESSION.

696
00:33:15,467 --> 00:33:17,133
- SO...

697
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:19,100
- I'LL WAIT FOR HIM
BY THE SERVICE ELEVATOR

698
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,767
AND M-99 HIM THERE.

699
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,300
I WOULD HAVE RATHER
GRABBED HIM AT NIGHT,

700
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,434
BUT I CAN MAKE THIS WORK.

701
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:25,634
- AND WHAT ABOUT ME?

702
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:28,300
- YOU'LL WAIT
UNTIL THE SESSION STARTS.

703
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,901
EVERYONE WILL BE
IN THE SEMINAR.

704
00:33:29,901 --> 00:33:31,501
YOU WON'T BE SPOTTED
WHEN YOU LEAVE.

705
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:34,100
JUST STEER CLEAR
OF THE SERVICE ELEVATOR.

706
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,267
- OKAY.

707
00:33:36,267 --> 00:33:38,167
[exhales]

708
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,000
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
- WHAT?

709
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,133
- I ACTUALLY SLEPT.

710
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:56,234
- HEY.

711
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:58,200
DO YOU WANT TO GET UP?
- NO.

712
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,567
- DO YOU WANT TO GO
BACK TO SLEEP?

713
00:33:59,567 --> 00:34:00,801
- NO.

714
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:02,033
- DO YOU WANT TO JUST--

715
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:03,601
NO, I JUST--I DON'T
WANT TO DO ANYTHING.

716
00:34:03,601 --> 00:34:05,000
I JUST WANT TO LIE HERE.

717
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,467
IT'S SUNDAY.
I'M ALLOWED.

718
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:12,000
- LAGUERTA'S AN EVIL BITCH.

719
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,968
- NO, SHE'S NOT.

720
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,000
MAYBE SHE IS.

721
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,267
- THE BEST WAY
TO GET BACK AT HER

722
00:34:23,267 --> 00:34:25,100
IS TO DO EXACTLY
WHAT SHE SAYS.

723
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,934
GO ON LEAVE,
TALK TO YOUR UNION REP,

724
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,501
GET REINSTATED,

725
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:30,033
THEN COME BACK AND KICK

726
00:34:30,033 --> 00:34:32,501
AS MUCH ASS
AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.

727
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:35,234
[doorbell rings]

728
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:38,567
NO ONE,
NOT EVEN LAGUERTA,

729
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:40,300
CAN DENY THAT YOU'RE
A GREAT DETECTIVE.

730
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,033
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

731
00:34:42,033 --> 00:34:43,067
YOU'LL BE
THE ONE LEFT STANDING.

732
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:44,334
- AT THEN END OF THE DAY?

733
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,434
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE.

734
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:59,200
- SOUNDS LIKE
ONE VERY LONG DAY.

735
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:05,367
- HEY.

736
00:35:05,367 --> 00:35:06,901
[sniffs]
I SMELL COFFEE.

737
00:35:06,901 --> 00:35:07,901
- NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME.

738
00:35:07,901 --> 00:35:11,400
- WELL, IT IS FOR ME.

739
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,734
HEY, DEBRA MORGAN.

740
00:35:12,734 --> 00:35:15,300
- LIDDY, RIGHT?
- GOOD MEMORY.

741
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,300
I LIKE THIS ONE.
- "THIS ONE"?

742
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,834
- YOU AND I GOT
SOMETHING IN COMMON.

743
00:35:19,834 --> 00:35:21,567
WE'VE BOTH BEEN FUCKED OVER
BY LAGUERTA.

744
00:35:21,567 --> 00:35:22,601
- WELL,
MAYBE WE SHOULD MAKE

745
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:23,734
MATCHING T-SHIRTS
OR SOMETHING.

746
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:24,767
- [laughs]

747
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,334
- OKAY.
WELL, THIS ONE'S GOING

748
00:35:26,334 --> 00:35:28,234
FOR A FUCKIN'
BREAKFAST BURRITO.

749
00:35:28,234 --> 00:35:30,167
I'LL SEE YOU TWO LATER.

750
00:35:33,434 --> 00:35:35,501
- CALL BEFORE YOU COME OVER.

751
00:35:35,501 --> 00:35:36,601
IT'S A COMMON COURTESY.

752
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,968
- DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS GIRL

753
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:39,300
SHACKED UP
WITH DEXTER MORGAN?

754
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,133
I JUST STAGED A LITTLE
MEET AND GREET WITH HER.

755
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:43,634
OLD P.I. MOVE.

756
00:35:43,634 --> 00:35:44,667
- SO YOU MET HER.

757
00:35:44,667 --> 00:35:46,801
- NAME, LUMEN PIERCE.

758
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:49,334
LUMEN--
STUPID FUCKIN' NAME.

759
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:51,033
FROM MINNEAPOLIS,
MINNESOTA.

760
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:52,901
SUPPOSED TO BE MARRIED
THREE MONTHS AGO,

761
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,133
PICTURE IN THE PAPER
AND EVERYTHING.

762
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,434
JUST TAKES OFF.

763
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:56,934
SHOWS UP HERE IN MIAMI

764
00:35:56,934 --> 00:35:59,033
ONE WEEK BEFORE
YOUR BOY'S WIFE,

765
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,467
RITA MORGAN, IS MURDERED.

766
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:02,601
NOW, WHAT
YOU THINK OF THAT?

767
00:36:02,601 --> 00:36:04,767
- I DON'T KNOW.
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

768
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:06,367
- IT'S A HELL OF LOT MORE
THAN I HAD YESTERDAY.

769
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:08,234
- WELL, STAY ON IT.

770
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,534
- I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I AM RUNNING OUT OF LOOT.

771
00:36:10,534 --> 00:36:11,601
- I JUST PAID YOU
LAST WEEK.

772
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:13,133
- AND I JUST
FUCKED UP MY CAR

773
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,801
GETTING THIS INFO
FOR YOU, QUINN.

774
00:36:14,801 --> 00:36:16,200
NOW, THIS BOY IS DIRTY.

775
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,501
WHAT YOU
GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

776
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:19,167
- I'M NOT GIVING YOU
ANY MORE.

777
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,367
- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT YOU AND ME
HAD AN UNDERSTANDING.

778
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:23,133
I MEAN, IT'D BE A SHAME

779
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:27,133
IF THE SKIRT YOU'RE BONIN'
FINDS OUT ABOUT ALL THIS.

780
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:30,067
- AND HOW
WOULD THAT HAPPEN?

781
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:31,067
- I DON'T KNOW.

782
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:32,901
THINGS GO WRONG
EVERY DAY.

783
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:34,834
- FUCKIN' MOTHERFUCKER!

784
00:36:34,834 --> 00:36:36,300
- [laughs]

785
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,501
YOU TWO ARE STARTIN'
TO SOUND MORE ALIKE EVERY DAY.

786
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:43,167
MUST BE LOVE.

787
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,067
- TRAGEDY.

788
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:47,868
MANY OF US HERE
HAVE EXPERIENCED IT

789
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:49,167
IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER.

790
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,801
THE KIND THAT LEAVES
YOU WONDERING

791
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:52,033
IF THERE'S A REASON
TO GO ON LIVING.

792
00:36:52,033 --> 00:36:53,367
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS,

793
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:55,033
YOU'VE HEARD ME TALKING ABOUT
GETTING IN TOUCH

794
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:56,534
WITH YOUR PRIMAL SELF.

795
00:36:56,534 --> 00:37:00,767
BUT HOW DOES THE PRIMAL SELF
DEAL WITH LOSS?

796
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:02,334
Dexter:
COLE'S STARTING HIS ROUNDS.

797
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:04,367
HE'LL REACH THE SERVICE ELEVATOR
IN FIVE MINUTES.

798
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:06,000
IN THREE MINUTES, SO WILL I.

799
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,501
- THERE'S SOMEONE
IN THIS ROOM

800
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:09,434
WHO IS DEALING
WITH THAT VERY QUESTION.

801
00:37:09,434 --> 00:37:13,534
DEXTER MORGAN.

802
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,601
COME AND JOIN ME
ON STAGE, DEXTER.

803
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:17,501
I KNOW YOU WEREN'T
EXPECTING THIS,

804
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,400
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT.

805
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,834
PLEASE.

806
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,067
Dexter: SO MUCH
FOR SLIPPING OUT QUIETLY.

807
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,267
crowd: DEXTER!
- DEXTER.

808
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:26,000
THEY WANT YOU, DEXTER.

809
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,767
[crowd slowly
chanting "Dexter!"]

810
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,400
- DEXTER. DEXTER.

811
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,234
DEXTER.

812
00:37:31,234 --> 00:37:32,767
DEXTER.

813
00:37:32,767 --> 00:37:34,567
DEXTER.

814
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:37,501
[cheers and applause]

815
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:54,434
[elevator bell rings]

816
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:57,467
DEXTER WORKS
WITH MIAMI METRO HOMICIDE.

817
00:37:57,467 --> 00:38:00,300
RECENTLY, HE LOST HIS WIFE.

818
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,033
SHE WAS MURDERED...

819
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:03,467
[crowd gasps]

820
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,033
BY THE TRINITY KILLER.

821
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,100
[shocked muttering]

822
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,634
THE VERY PERSON THAT DEXTER'S
DEPARTMENT WAS HUNTING.

823
00:38:10,634 --> 00:38:12,400
YOU WERE THE ONE
TO FIND HER, YOUR WIFE?

824
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,367
RITA?

825
00:38:15,367 --> 00:38:16,434
- [whispers] YEAH.

826
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:17,634
YES.

827
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,467
- I'M GONNA ASK YOU
TO DO SOMETHING, DEXTER,

828
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:20,834
AND IT'S GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT.

829
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:25,100
I WANT YOU TO RELIVE
THAT MOMENT.

830
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,367
ACCORDING
TO THE NEWSPAPERS,

831
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:29,200
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
GOING AWAY ON HONEYMOON?

832
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,901
DEXTER.

833
00:38:34,901 --> 00:38:36,234
- YE--YES.

834
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:40,801
- TELL US ABOUT IT.

835
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:42,567
- WELL, WE POSTPONED
THE HONEYMOON

836
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,200
BECAUSE WE HAD
A NEW BABY, A BOY.

837
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,167
- KEEP GOING.

838
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,968
TELL ME HOW YOU FOUND HER.

839
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:51,200
PLEASE.

840
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,267
- I'D COME HOME
AFTER WORK.

841
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:02,701
[on TV monitor] I REMEMBER
WALKING THROUGH THE HOUSE.

842
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:05,601
I TURNED THE CORNER AND...

843
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:12,467
IT'S LIKE TIME
ACTUALLY SLOWED DOWN

844
00:39:12,467 --> 00:39:16,467
AND THEN STOPPED.

845
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:20,367
IT'S JUST A SERIES
OF PICTURES.

846
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:21,868
- WHAT'D YOU SEE?

847
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:25,300
- I SAW MY SON
SITTING IN BLOOD.

848
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:30,567
HE WAS CRYING.

849
00:39:33,033 --> 00:39:36,033
SO MUCH BLOOD.

850
00:39:38,234 --> 00:39:40,300
AND SHE WAS THERE
IN THE TUB.

851
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,868
SHE'D BLED OUT.

852
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,334
HER EYES WERE STILL OPEN.

853
00:39:43,334 --> 00:39:44,968
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
SOMETHING, DEXTER.

854
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:46,834
I WANT YOU TO BE
VERY HONEST.

855
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:50,501
WHAT DID YOU FEEL
IN THAT MOMENT?

856
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:53,767
WE WANT TO KNOW.

857
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:59,434
- IT'S DIFFICULT
TO PUT INTO WORDS.

858
00:39:59,434 --> 00:40:01,300
EVERYTHING...

859
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,167
FELL APART. I FELT...

860
00:40:04,167 --> 00:40:08,701
- SHATTERED?

861
00:40:08,701 --> 00:40:09,901
- YES.

862
00:40:09,901 --> 00:40:11,601
- WHEN THE PRIMAL SELF
IS SHATTERED,

863
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:14,400
IT REACHES OUT IN SEARCH OF
WHAT WILL MAKE IT WHOLE AGAIN.

864
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,400
DO YOU FEEL THAT, DEXTER?

865
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,801
THAT HUNGER INSIDE YOU
TO BE WHOLE AGAIN?

866
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:20,934
- I DO.

867
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:23,868
- THAT HUNGER
IS YOUR PRIMAL SELF.

868
00:40:23,868 --> 00:40:25,701
YOU MUST OPEN YOUR HEART
AND LISTEN

869
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:27,033
TO WHAT IT'S SAYING.

870
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,901
MANY PEOPLE
AFTER SUFFERING A TRAGEDY...

871
00:40:28,901 --> 00:40:30,167
- MR. HARMON?

872
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,367
- SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
AS BROKEN BEINGS...

873
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:33,601
- CAN YOU SIGN THIS, PLEASE?

874
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:34,934
- LIVING IN THE PAST.
[dialing cell phone]

875
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:38,801
YOUR PRIMAL SELF
IS CRYING OUT TO BE WHOLE.

876
00:40:38,801 --> 00:40:41,601
WHAT IS IT
THAT WILL MAKE YOU WHOLE?

877

THAT'S TRUE.

THIS IS WHO I AM.

00:44:53,367 --> 00:44:55,033
WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
MY MOTHER WAS MURDERED

IN FRONT OF ME,
AND IT...

930
00:44:59,901 --> 00:45:05,501
SHATTERED ME.

IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I COULD FEEL...

UNBROKEN.

935
00:45:21,534 --> 00:45:26,100
AND THEN,

MADE SENSE ANYMORE.

- IT WAS YOU.

947
00:46:38,267 --> 00:46:40,133
LAGUERTA ASKED YOU
TO BACK HER STORY,

948
00:46:40,133 --> 00:46:44,234
AND OF COURSE YOU DID.

949
00:46:44,234 --> 00:46:46,901
- DEB.

950
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:47,934

- WHAT YOU DID

957
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:11,400
YOU WOULD NEVER
LEARN FROM ME.

- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
BACKING LAGUERTA'S STORY.

964

- NO, I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS GONNA DO.

I WAS STUCK
BETWEEN A ROCK AND MY WIFE,

BUT I DECIDED
I'M BACKING YOU.

967

DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT,

BUT YOU'LL
LOOK BACK ON IT,

990
00:48:54,501 --> 00:48:55,901
YOU'LL REALIZE
IT WAS WORTH IT.
