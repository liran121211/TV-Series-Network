1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,968
- PREVIOUSLY ON <i>DEXTER...</i>

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:11,234
- [speaking Spanish]

3
00:00:11,234 --> 00:00:12,734
- CUT HIM, AND I'LL BLOW
YOUR FUCKING HEAD OFF.

4
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:13,968
- AH!
[gunshot]

5
00:00:13,968 --> 00:00:15,868
- MEDIC!
I NEED A FUCKING MEDIC!

6
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,567
WE WERE WONDERING
IF THERE'S ANYTHING

7
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:20,601
YOU CAN TELL US
ABOUT THE MAN WHO INJURED YOU.

8
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,868
I KNOW WHERE CARLOS AND HIS
BROTHER HAVE BEEN HANGING OUT--

9
00:00:22,868 --> 00:00:24,667
AT A LOCAL CLUB
CALLED THE MAYAN.

10
00:00:24,667 --> 00:00:26,467
- YOU GOT YOUR LEAD.
CONGRATS.

11
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:28,167
- YEAH, WE STAKE THIS PLACE OUT,
THEY SHOW UP,

12
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,634
AND THEN WE TAKE
THESE SANTA MUERTA NO-DICKS

13
00:00:29,634 --> 00:00:30,901
DOWN FOR GOOD.

14
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:32,934
- ARE YOU AND QUINN--
- WE'RE FUCK BUDDIES.

15
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:35,801
- DON'T BRING HIM AROUND
WHEN HARRISON'S HERE.

16
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,767
- WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE?

17
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:40,667
- THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

18
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,834
- SON OF A BITCH.

19
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,567
- HEY, HEY, HEY. HEY!
SERGEANT!

20
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:46,400
- ANGEL, LET HIM GO.
THIS IS A STING!

21
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,100
I.A. NEEDED MY HELP

22
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,133
TO BUST A NARCOTICS COP
ON THE TAKE,

23
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,000
AND I SAID YES,
TO CLOSE THE BOOKS

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,734
ON YOUR BAR FIGHT!

25
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:55,934
- FUCK THOSE I.A. RATS.

26
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,567
- AND YOUR BOSS.

27
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,968
THAT BITCH PUT HANDCUFFS
ON ME.

28
00:00:59,968 --> 00:01:01,200
- I MIGHT HAVE A JOB FOR YOU.

29
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,534
- YOU GOT A NAME?

30
00:01:03,534 --> 00:01:05,100
- DEXTER MORGAN.

31
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,868
- BOYD WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO DID THIS TO ME.

32
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,200
THERE WERE OTHERS.

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF YOU
ACTUALLY FIND ONE OF THESE GUYS?

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,934
- WHAT YOU WON'T.
- YOU GONNA KILL HIM?

35
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:19,767
- YOU DON'T GET TO TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

36
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,868
- YOU WERE ABOUT TO MURDER
THE WRONG MAN.

38
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:26,734
GO HOME.

39
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:29,000
- OKAY.
OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GO.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,334
- YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

41
00:01:30,334 --> 00:01:32,367
YOUR PARENTS WILL BE HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

42
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:34,968
- THANK YOU.

43
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:38,734
- MAYBE THIS IS ONE PROBLEM
I CAN CHECK OFF THE LIST.

44
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,267
- WELCOME TO MIAMI.

45
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:55,634
[quirky music]

46
00:01:55,634 --> 00:02:03,601
* *

47
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,234
- I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO KEEP

48
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:50,901
THE DIFFERENT PARTS
OF MY LIFE SEPARATE.

49
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,100
BECOMING A FATHER MADE THAT
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

50
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,033
AND AS A HUSBAND,
I FAILED.

51
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,567
BUT I'M
A VERY NEAT MONSTER...

52
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:08,501
WHO WON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE AGAIN.

53
00:04:12,934 --> 00:04:15,400
- I PACKED UP
RITA'S WEDDING DRESS.

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,334
I THOUGHT ASTOR
MIGHT WANT IT SOMEDAY.

55
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:27,334
FEELS LIKE IT TOOK YOU GUYS
MONTHS TO MOVE IN...

56
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:29,300
ONLY A DAY TO PACK UP.

57
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,334
- THE REALTOR SUGGESTED
WE PAINT THE WALLS WHITE.

58
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:34,167
SHE WANTS TO STAGE THE HOUSE
MIAMI CHIC.

59
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:36,234
- NO EVIDENCE THAT A FAMILY
EVER LIVED HERE.

60
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,968
- OR DIED HERE.

61
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:40,167
- YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE THAT,
DON'T YOU?

62
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,801
- THE HOPE IS THAT
A RIDICULOUSLY LOW LISTING PRICE

63
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,467
WILL HELP A BUYER
SEE PAST THAT.

64
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:49,367
- ANY IDEA
WHERE YOU WANT TO LIVE?

65
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:51,634
I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS A STUPID QUESTION.

66
00:04:51,634 --> 00:04:53,367
YOU--YOU SHOULD TAKE
THE APARTMENT.

67
00:04:53,367 --> 00:04:56,767
- NO. NO, THAT'S YOURS.
- NO. I INSIST.

68
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,467
IT'S REALLY
ALWAYS BEEN YOURS.

69
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,300
I'LL MOVE OUT.

70
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,801
- I THOUGHT YOU ALREADY DID.

71
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:06,234
- I DIDN'T MOVE IN
WITH QUINN.

72
00:05:06,234 --> 00:05:07,767
- WELL, YOU'RE NEVER AROUND.

73
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:11,567
- I'M AT QUINN'S,
BUT I DON'T LIVE THERE...

74
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,667
NO CLOTHES IN ANY DRAWERS.

75
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:16,801
THERE'S NO
HIS-AND-HERS-TOOTHBRUSH ACTION.

76
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:20,801
QUINN'S PLACE IS ALL QUINN.

77
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:23,734
- A VAST, EMPTY SPACE?

78
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:31,133
- I DON'T REMEMBER RITA
IN THESE.

79
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,701
- BECAUSE THEY BELONG
TO LUMEN.

80
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:37,868
ME EITHER.

81
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:40,067
LUMEN IS HOME IN MINNEAPOLIS--

82
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:43,033
ANOTHER PART OF MY LIFE
PACKED AWAY.

83
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:46,267
[sighs]

84
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:49,901
LIFE SEEMS DIFFERENT NOW...

85
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:52,434
MANAGEABLE.

86
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:58,567
EVERYTHING IN ITS RIGHT PLACE.

87
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:39,334
SOON, LANCE ROBINSON
WILL BE ON MY TABLE.

88
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:42,167
LANCE TROLLS THE INTERNET,

89
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:46,801
ENGAGING IN CASUAL ENCOUNTERS
WITH INNOCENT MEN...

90
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:48,868
WHO NEVER SUSPECT
THOSE ENCOUNTERS

91
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:51,300
COULD TURN DEADLY.

92
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:57,534
FOUR TIMES
LANCE DELIBERATELY PUSHED

93
00:06:57,534 --> 00:07:01,701
SOMEONE'S FANTASIES TOO FAR.

94
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:05,601
HE WILL BE AN EASY KILL,
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

95
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:08,701
TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

96
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,534
- OKAY, PEOPLE,

97
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:37,400
LET'S GO OVER OUR POSITIONS
AT CLUB MAYAN.

98
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,367
EVERYBODY BE IN PLACE
BY 10:00.

99
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,200
BATISTA AND I'LL BE
IN THE VAN, AS USUAL.

100
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,634
QUINN,
YOU'LL WATCH THE DOOR.

101
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,300
CIRA--

102
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,234
- YES, CHIEF?

103
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:49,367
- DON'T LET ME STOP YOU.

104
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:51,167
- OFFICER MANZON,
YOU'LL BE ON THE FLOOR

105
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,100
WATCHING FOOT TRAFFIC
AT THE V.I.P. ROOM,

106
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,501
IN CASE THE FUENTES BROTHERS
ROLL THROUGH.

107
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,901
- AND WHAT IF THEY DON'T?

108
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:00,133
- THEN WE'LL WORK
THE OPERATION UNTIL THEY DO.

109
00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:02,767
- YOU WERE FACE-TO-FACE
WITH CARLOS FUENTES, RIGHT?

110
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:04,167
- YES, SIR.

111
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,767
- WELL, THEN THAT MEANS
HE KNOWS THAT WE'RE ONTO HIM.

112
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:08,167
TELL ME WHY THEY WOULD EVER
RETURN TO THIS CLUB.

113
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,501
- THE ONLY REASON
THE FUENTES BROTHERS

114
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:12,000
ARE FORCING PEOPLE
TO WITHDRAW CASH FROM THE ATM

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,834
IS TO PAY FOR TABLE SERVICE
AT THIS CLUB.

116
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:17,467
- WE RAN THE DATES
OF THE ATM HOLDUPS

117
00:08:17,467 --> 00:08:19,100
PAST THE CLUB MANAGERS.

118
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,367
AND THEY CONFIRMED
THAT IN EACH OF THOSE NIGHTS,

119
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,667
THE FUENTES BROTHERS
SHOWED UP AT CLUB MAYAN

120
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,334
AND TOOK OVER
THE V.I.P. LOUNGE.

121
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:28,067
- SO IF THE FUENTES BROTHERS
DO SHOW UP AT THIS CLUB,

122
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,234
WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY,
IT MEANS THAT SOMEONE

123
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:32,300
IS POSSIBLY LYING ON THE FLOOR
OF THEIR LIVING ROOM

124
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,167
WITHOUT THEIR HEAD.

125
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,834
- WE'RE WORKING
THE ONLY LEAD WE HAVE.

126
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:38,767
- ALL YOU'RE DOING
IS DRINKING AND DANCING

127
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:42,033
ON THE TAXPAYER'S DIME.

128
00:08:42,033 --> 00:08:44,300
I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED
MORE FROM YOU, MORGAN.

129
00:08:55,634 --> 00:08:58,167
- CHIEF...

130
00:08:58,167 --> 00:08:59,901
WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF OPTIONS HERE.

131
00:08:59,901 --> 00:09:01,133
WITHOUT THIS OPERATION,

132
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:03,567
WE'RE EFFECTIVELY STOPPING WORK
ON THIS CASE,

133
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,200
WHICH WE CANNOT DO
TO THIS COMMUNITY.

134
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,501
- DID YOU EVEN KNOW
THIS OPERATION WAS HAPPENING?

135
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,300
- OF COURSE I KNEW.
WHY WOULDN'T I?

136
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,968
- WELL, IT SEEMS
YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING

137
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,133
AN AWFUL LOT OF TIME LATELY
WITH INTERNAL AFFAIRS

138
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,667
BAILING YOUR NEW HUSBAND
OUT OF HOT WATER.

139
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:18,667
BRAVO, MRS. BATISTA.

140
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,801
- I'M KEEPING MY NAME.

141
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:22,033
AND I THINK WORKING CLUB MAYAN

142
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:24,167
IS A VALID ALLOCATION
OF MY SQUAD'S RESOURCES.

143
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:26,200
- IT IS YOUR SQUAD,
LIEUTENANT.

144
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,801
HOW YOU MANAGE IT IS UP TO YOU.
- THANK YOU.

145
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,267
- BUT IF ANOTHER MURDER
GOES UP ON THE BOARD,

146
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:33,200
IT'S YOUR ASS ON THE LINE,
NOT MINE.

147
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,868
- YOU HAVE ONE MORE NIGHT
AT CLUB MAYAN.

148
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:42,968
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN.

149
00:09:42,968 --> 00:09:45,033
- MATTHEWS DOESN'T HAVE
MUCH FAITH IN US, DOES HE?

150
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,701
- YEAH, WELL, THAT FIGHT YOU HAD
AT THE BAR DIDN'T HELP ANYTHING.

151
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:50,534
- HE KNOWS ABOUT THE BAR FIGHT?
- OF COURSE HE KNOWS.

152
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,400
A NARCOTICS OFFICER
GOT SUSPENDED

153
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,567
BECAUSE OF THAT BAR FIGHT.

154
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,067
- NO. A NARCOTICS OFFICER
GOT SUSPENDED

155
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,567
BECAUSE OF YOU.

156
00:09:57,567 --> 00:09:59,567
- ME?
- YOU RAN TO I.A.D.

157
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:01,434
YOU COOKED UP THE STING.

158
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,667
YOU BASICALLY
GOT STAN LIDDY FIRED.

159
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,000
- AND GOT ALL THE CHARGES
AGAINST YOU DROPPED.

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,400
- I DIDN'T ASK
FOR ANY OF THAT.

161
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,901
I COULD HAVE HANDLED WHATEVER
I.A.D. HAD COMING MY WAY.

162
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,234
- OH, SO ANYTHING
THAT HAPPENS IS FINE?

163
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:12,934
- WHEN IT HAPPENS
TO ME, YES.

164
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:14,334
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

165
00:10:14,334 --> 00:10:15,534
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE MARRIED,

166
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:17,100
WHATEVER HAPPENS TO ME
HAPPENS TO YOU.

167
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,667
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

168
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,834
WE'RE MARRIED.
- HERE'S WHAT'S BOTHERING ME.

169
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,267
YOU WEREN'T LOOKING OUT
FOR ME

170
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:23,934
OUT OF SOME SENSE
OF COMPASSION.

171
00:10:23,934 --> 00:10:25,934
YOU WERE TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF.

172
00:10:25,934 --> 00:10:28,634
GOD FORBID YOUR NAME SHOULD LOSE
SOME OF ITS SHINE.

173
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,901
- GET OUT OF MY OFFICE.
- MM-HMM.

174
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:39,934
- [sighs]

175
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,133
[knocking on door]

176
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,300
- HEY.

177
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,267
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
A DEBRIEFING

178
00:11:02,267 --> 00:11:04,200
BEFORE WE HIT CLUB MAYAN.

179
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,701
- UM, SORT OF
NOT A GOOD TIME.

180
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,200
- WHERE'S QUINN, AND WHAT HAVE
YOU DONE WITH HIM?

181
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,667
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
UM...

182
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,334
JUST GIVE ME AN HOUR.

183
00:11:16,334 --> 00:11:19,300
- AN HOUR?
- YEAH.

184
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,868
- WHO'S NAKED
IN YOUR APARTMENT?

185
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:23,801
- UH, NO ONE IS NAKED.

186
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,267
- THEN WHAT?

187
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,434
I'M SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT.
- DEBRA, WAIT.

188
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:31,167
COME HERE.
DEBRA, COME HERE.

189
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:36,601
DEBRA MORGAN.
THIS IS STAN LIDDY.

190
00:11:36,601 --> 00:11:39,601
LIDDY HAD A RUN-IN
WITH I.A.D.

191
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:41,300
AND, UH, GOT SUSPENDED.

192
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,734
WE'RE PREPPING HIM

193
00:11:43,734 --> 00:11:45,601
FOR HIS UNION-REP MEETING
TOMORROW.

194
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,801
- SORRY.

195
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,634
- ALL CLOTHES ARE STAYING ON.

196
00:11:49,634 --> 00:11:52,300
- I'LL JUST--
- UH, MEET ME THERE?

197
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,534
- YEAH, I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

198
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:01,300
- YOU ARE BONING
OUR TARGET'S SISTER?

199
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,100
- JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU
FOUND OUT ON DEXTER MORGAN.

200
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,868
- WELL...

201
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:10,200
YOUR BOY'S SQUEAKY CLEAN
ON PAPER.

202
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,734
HE'S ONLY BEEN OUT
OF THE COUNTRY ONCE, TO PARIS.

203
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:16,534
PAYS HIS BILLS ON TIME,
KEEPS TO HIMSELF.

204
00:12:16,534 --> 00:12:18,367
I'LL TELL YOU,
IT'S ALL TOO NEAT

205
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,801
AND A LITTLE TOO PHONY.

206
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,200
YOU SEE DRUG DEALERS

207
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,601
WITH THE VERY SAME PROFILES
ALL THE TIME.

208
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,033
- OH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I'M THINKING.

209
00:12:26,033 --> 00:12:28,767
I MEAN, WHAT'S HE HIDING?

210
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:30,367
- PEEKABOO.

211
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:34,968
- [laughing]

212
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:37,634
- BYE-BYE, DADDY.
PEEKABOO!

213
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,734
OH, THANK YOU.

214
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:44,367
- YOU'RE REALLY VERY GOOD
WITH HIM.

215
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,567
- I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE
TO WORK TONIGHT.

216
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:49,200
THE LAB FELL SO FAR BEHIND
WHILE I WAS OUT.

217
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,567
NIGHT'S THE ONLY TIME I CAN EVER
GET ANYTHING DONE.

218
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:54,834
- WELL, I HOPE THE LIEUTENANT
APPRECIATES YOUR DEDICATION.

219
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:57,334
- I'M PRETTY SURE SHE DOES.

220
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:00,200
ALTHOUGH TONIGHT
WILL BE DEDICATED TO LANCE.

221
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:04,701
- SO YOU THINK
ABOUT MIDNIGHT, THEN?

222
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,367
- I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT SOONER.

223
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,100
- CAN YOU SAY
"BYE-BYE, DADDY"?

224
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,334
- DIE-DIE.

225
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,400
- DID YOU HEAR THAT?

226
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,300
- HE SAID, "DIE-DIE."

227
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,434
- DON'T BE SILLY.
HE SAID, "BYE-BYE."

228
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:20,834
HARRISON'S FIRST WORD.

229
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:21,834
THERE'S YOUR GOOD BOY.

230
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:25,000
- I HOPE SO.
- [chuckles]

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,267
- DIE-DIE.

232
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:30,300
- FROM THE MOUTH OF BABES.

233
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:38,067
I RENTED AN RV,
PLACED AN AD ONLINE,

234
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,534
SAYING I WAS CRUISING
DOWN TO THE KEYS,

235
00:13:40,534 --> 00:13:47,067
AND JUST LIKE THAT...
MY VICTIM CAME TO ME.

236
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:50,467
- YOU MUST BE TEN INCHES
OF PURE STEEL, HMM?

237
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:52,367
- YOU BETCHA.

238
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,968
- OH...

239
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:01,834
- COMPARTMENTALIZATION BEGAN

240
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:04,067
AS AN ARCHITECTURAL
THEORY...

241
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:07,234
DIVIDE BUILDINGS INTO SECTIONS
WHICH CAN BE CLOSED OFF

242
00:14:07,234 --> 00:14:09,968
TO PREVENT A FIRE
FROM SPREADING.

243
00:14:09,968 --> 00:14:14,267
LIFE CAN ALSO BE DIVIDED
INTO CLOSED-OFF SECTIONS.

244
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:16,267
MAKES EVERYTHING
MUCH SIMPLER.

245
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:20,567
[cell phone vibrates]

246
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,133
LUMEN PIERCE.

247
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,567
[cell phone vibrates]

248
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,133
AGAIN?

249
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:43,634
THIS IS THE LIFE
HARRY WANTED FOR ME...

250
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:46,133
CAREFULLY DIVIDED.

251
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:49,334
[loud thud]
SHH...

252
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:52,267
[cell phone chimes]

253
00:14:57,634 --> 00:15:00,767
WHAT THE HELL?

254
00:15:00,767 --> 00:15:02,968
[phone dialing, line ringing]

255
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:06,000
- DEXTER, I--

256
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,968
I SHOT ONE OF THEM.

257
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:10,601
I KILLED HIM.

258
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:15,467
I'M AT THE MARINA--
BAYSHORE BISCAYNE OR SOMETHING?

259
00:15:15,467 --> 00:15:16,834
- YOU'RE IN MIAMI?

260
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,801
- I NEVER LEFT.

261
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:22,801
OH, THERE'S SO MUCH BLOOD.

262
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:25,701
WHAT DO I DO?

263
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:26,801
HELLO?

264
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:28,567
HELLO?

265
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,501
DEXTER, DON'T HANG UP
ON ME!

266
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:34,968
PLEASE, HELP ME.

267
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:37,834
- DON'T MOVE.
DON'T DO ANYTHING.

268
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,133
THE M-99 WILL WEAR OFF
IN A FEW SHORT HOURS--

269
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:00,567
NOT MUCH TIME TO CONTAIN
THE SITUATION...

270
00:16:00,567 --> 00:16:06,534
NOT MUCH TIME TO PROTECT
MY SIMPLE LIFE.

271
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:09,634
[dance beat playing]

272
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:17,200
* *

273
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,534
- FIRST, FOR GOOD LUCK...
LET ME SEE YOUR NECK.

274
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:27,067
* *

275
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,100
I FUCKING LOVE MY JOB.

276
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,834
- LOOK, I'M GONNA GO TAKE A LAP
THROUGH THE V.I.P.

277
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,734
- SHE'S CUTE.
- YEAH, SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

278
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:48,567
- I COULD DO YOU BOTH.

279
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,100
- THAT'S THE SIXTH GIRL
THAT'S HIT ON HIM.

280
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,901
WOW.

281
00:16:54,901 --> 00:16:56,934
- LET'S FOCUS
ON CAMERA THREE.

282
00:16:56,934 --> 00:17:00,200
THAT GUY, IS HE HOOKED UP
WITH THE FUENTES BROTHERS?

283
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,667
- HEY, I'M GONNA STAY ON QUINN.
HE MAY NEED SOME BACKUP.

284
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,801
- HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE FOCUSING
ON THE FUENTES BROTHERS.

285
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:07,734
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE PLAYING
WITH HER FUN BAGS.

286
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:11,133
- SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE'S JEALOUS.

287
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:15,033
- WHY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH
WOULD I BE JEALOUS?

288
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:18,467
- QUINN'S A GOOD GUY.

289
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,300
- I'M NOT INTERESTED.

290
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,267
- OUT THERE ON THE DANCE FLOOR,
SHAKING HIS TAIL FEATHERS.

291
00:17:25,267 --> 00:17:26,300
- REALLY NOT INTERESTED.

292
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,801
- STAY SINGLE
AS LONG AS YOU CAN.

293
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,434
[sighs]

294
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:32,067
- SAYS THE NEWLYWED.
- DON'T REMIND ME.

295
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:33,868
- YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

296
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,534
WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE HONEYMOON PHASE?

297
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:37,234
- I BLINKED.

298
00:17:59,968 --> 00:18:02,267
- SHOW ME WHERE HE IS.

299
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:08,300
- THERE WAS SO MUCH BLOOD.
I HAD--I HAD TO WALK AWAY.

300
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,067
THE BODY'S IN HERE.

301
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,534
- ANYBODY SEE YOU?
- I DON'T THINK SO.

302
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:19,100
OH, GOD, I HOPE NOT.
- YOU KILLED SOMEBODY.

303
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,334
- BECAUSE YOU
WOULDN'T DO IT FOR ME!

304
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:21,834
- BUT YOU CALL ME
TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOU.

305
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,400
- I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH THE BODY!

306
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,000
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
- JUST GO IF YOU WANT TO GO.

307
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,834
- GO?
I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU.

308
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,534
EVERYTHING YOU DO LEADS
RIGHT BACK TO ME.

309
00:18:29,534 --> 00:18:31,968
- I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE
SO HARD TO KILL SOMEONE.

310
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:39,868
- WHERE IS HE?
- HERE.

311
00:18:42,534 --> 00:18:43,567
OH, SHIT!

312
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,868
HE WAS RIGHT HERE.
- ARE YOU SURE?

313
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:48,033
- HE WAS DEAD.

314
00:18:48,033 --> 00:18:50,801
- APPARENTLY NOT.
- DON'T GET MAD AT ME.

315
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,400
- THIS ISN'T HOW I WAS PLANNING
TO SPEND MY EVENING.

316
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,701
- ME NEITHER.

317
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:54,868
- WOULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

318
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,434
- WHAT?
- STOP TALKING.

319
00:18:56,434 --> 00:19:00,467
HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD,
AT LEAST A PINT.

320
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:06,300
ONE...TWO...

321
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:11,868
THREE...FOUR.

322
00:19:11,868 --> 00:19:13,834
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE SHOT.

323
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,567
BUT YOU NEVER SHOT
A GUN BEFORE.

324
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,067
YOU DIDN'T ANTICIPATE
THE KICKBACK--

325
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,734
ONE OF THE MANY THINGS
YOU DIDN'T ANTICIPATE.

326
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:20,033
GIVE ME THE GUN.

327
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:26,467
YOU MUST HAVE HIT HIM ONCE.

328
00:19:26,467 --> 00:19:29,734
WHERE WAS THE POINT
OF IMPACT?

329
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,300
WHERE WERE YOU STANDING?

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,167
HE WAS STANDING HERE.
BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM.

331
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:40,767
I GO DOWN, YOU RUN AWAY.

332
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:42,200
I GET BACK UP,
AND WHERE DO I GO?

333
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,534
HERE.

334
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:52,901
COME ON.

335
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,734
HOW'D YOU EVEN FIND
THIS GUY?

336
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,033
YOU CAN TALK NOW.

337
00:20:06,033 --> 00:20:09,200
- THE NIGHT THAT I WAS TAKEN,
I HAD GONE TO A BAR.

338
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,834
I THOUGHT THAT
THEY SPOTTED ME THERE,

339
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,133
SO I WENT BACK TO THAT SAME BAR
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,

340
00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,467
HOPING THAT ONE OF THEM
WOULD WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.

341
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:17,868
I WORE A DISGUISE.
- DISGUISE?

342
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:19,968
- A WIG, SO THEY
WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE ME.

343
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,634
- I KNOW WHAT A DISGUISE

344
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,133
SO YOU WENT TO THE BAR.

345
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:25,133
YOU WAITED FOR ONE OF THEM
TO SHOW UP.

346
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:26,834
WHERE? WHAT BAR?

347
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,901
- HURRICANE 26.

348
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:32,701
- HURRICANE 26 IS ALL THE WAY
OVER ON OCEAN AVENUE.

349
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,501
HOW'D YOU GET ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE?

350
00:20:34,501 --> 00:20:36,834
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU.

351
00:20:36,834 --> 00:20:38,234
- SO GO ON.

352
00:20:38,234 --> 00:20:40,067
- TONIGHT ONE OF THEM
SHOWED UP.

353
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:42,634
HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME,
SO I-I FLIRTED WITH HIM.

354
00:20:42,634 --> 00:20:44,834
I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED
TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.

355
00:20:44,834 --> 00:20:47,067
WE GOT IN THE CAR,
I PULLED OUT MY GUN,

356
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:48,701
AND I FORCED HIM TO DRIVE.

357
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:50,868
THIS PLACE SEEMED DESERTED,
SO WE STOPPED,

358
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,067
AND I MARCHED HIM INSIDE.

359
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,834
- AND YOU SHOT HIM.
- NO.

360
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,767
I ASKED HIM FOR THE NAMES
OF THE OTHER MEN.

361
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:58,534
HE CALLED ME A CUNT.
THEN I SHOT HIM.

362
00:20:58,534 --> 00:21:00,734
- HOW'D YOU KNOW
HE WAS ONE OF THEM?

363
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:04,200
- I JUST--
I JUST KNEW.

364
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,334
- YOU RECOGNIZE HIS FACE?

365
00:21:06,334 --> 00:21:08,567
- NO. THEY KEPT ME BLINDFOLDED
MOST OF THE TIME.

366
00:21:10,968 --> 00:21:12,167
- SO HOW?

367
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:14,501
- I FELT IT THE MINUTE
HE WALKED IN THE DOOR.

368
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:18,067
ONE OF THE GUYS
HAD THIS SMELL...

369
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:20,100
LIKE OLD SWEAT OR,
I DON'T KNOW, CHLORINE.

370
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,100
WHEN I GOT IN THE CAR
WITH THIS GUY,

371
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,901
THERE IT WAS,
THE EXACT SAME STENCH.

372
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:27,033
- YOU SHOT SOMEONE
BASED ON A FEELING AND AN ODOR.

373
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:29,033
- I SHOT THE RIGHT GUY.

374
00:21:29,033 --> 00:21:30,601
- YOU WERE WILLING TO SHOOT
THE WRONG GUY

375
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:32,067
UNDER TUTTLE BRIDGE.

376
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,400
- THIS GUY WAS ONE OF THEM.

377
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
- WHAT'S HIS NAME?
- I DON'T KNOW.

378
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,567
- DID YOU CHECK HIS WALLET?

379
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:40,968
- NO.

380
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,067
- DID YOU TAKE HIS CELL PHONE?
- UH...

381
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,634
- HE COULD HAVE ALREADY CALLED
THE POLICE, YOU KNOW.

382
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:45,767
- I'M NEW TO THIS!

383
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,100
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO YOU SHOT!

384
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,701
- I SHOT ONE OF THE CREEPS
WHO RAPED ME.

385
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,968
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF.
- I'M THE PROOF!

386
00:21:50,968 --> 00:21:53,267
MY MEMORY!
MY EXPERIENCE!

387
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:55,601

THE MOST RELIABLE TOOLS.

00:21:55,601 --> 00:21:58,467
- FUCK YOU!

389
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:01,901
WOW.

00:22:01,901 --> 00:22:04,501
- JUST GO.

391
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:08,100
I CAN FIND HIM ON MY OWN
AND KILL HIM.

392
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,601
- LIKE YOU KILLED HIM
THE FIRST TIME?

393
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,601
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHICH DIRECTION HE WENT--

394
00:22:13,601 --> 00:22:16,601
IF HE TURNED RIGHT OR--

395
00:22:21,067 --> 00:22:23,467
BLOOD SWIPE.

396
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,601
HE STOPPED HERE
TO CATCH HIS BREATH.

397
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:27,901
LEANED AGAINST THE POST,
PUT HIS HAND HERE.

398
00:22:27,901 --> 00:22:31,868
THE DIRECTIONALITY
OF THE BLOOD LEADS WHICH WAY?

399
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:36,400
THIS WAY.

400
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,300
- YOU SURE KNOW A LOT
ABOUT BLOOD.

401
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:43,200
- SO HYPOTHETICALLY,

402
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,467
AN OFFICE ROMANCE IS JUST
THE WORST IDEA EVER.

403
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:47,200
- YEAH, I WOULD ADVISE
AGAINST IT.

404
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,167
BUT HYPOTHETICALLY...

405
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,534
I CAN SEE HOW YOU AND QUINN
MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.

406
00:22:53,534 --> 00:22:55,701
- SO YOU WOULD ADVISE
AGAINST IT,

407
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:57,033
BUT IT WOULD MAKE
A LOT OF SENSE?

408
00:22:57,033 --> 00:22:59,567
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M A ROMANTIC AT HEART.

409
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:00,968
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU
DO SOMETHING

410
00:23:00,968 --> 00:23:02,167
TO PATCH STUFF UP
WITH YOUR WIFE?

411

00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:41,701
SO I'M USELESS.

00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:43,934
- AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO SEE
QUINN HITTING ON OTHER WOMEN.

YOU WERE GETTING ON A PLANE
TO MINNEAPOLIS.

- I TRIED TO GET ON THAT PLANE.
I COULDN'T.

00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:38,300
I HAD TO STAY.

482
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,434
THE GUY I SHOT TONIGHT,

483
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:42,734
HE WOULD TAKE
THESE THREE FINGERS--

- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL--
- AND SHOVE THEM IN MY MOUTH.

IT TASTED LIKE METAL.

486
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:53,634
HE WOULD KEEP THEM THERE,
SO I COULDN'T SCREAM.

487
00:26:53,634 --> 00:26:56,033
THE OTHER GUYS WOULD JUST STUFF
A DIRTY RAG IN MY MOUTH,

00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:57,734
BUT NOT THIS GUY.

489
00:26:57,734 --> 00:27:00,601

TO HOLD ME DOWN HIMSELF.

517
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:53,501
- MY NAME'S DAN.
DAN MENDELL.

518
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,901
THIS WOMAN RIGHT HERE,
SHE SHOT ME.

519
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,234
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY.

520
00:28:57,234 --> 00:28:59,033
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU DID TO ME!

521
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:00,634
- I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS WOMAN
BEFORE IN MY LIFE.

522
00:29:00,634 --> 00:29:04,033
- YOU'RE A FUCKING LIAR!
- YOU'RE FUCKING CRAZY!

523
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:07,767
LOOK, YOU CAN'T LET ME DIE.
I GOT A WIFE.

524
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:11,901
I GOT A DAUGHTER.
PLEASE. JUST LOOK.

525
00:29:11,901 --> 00:29:14,701
- DAN MENDELL, D.D.S.,
KIDS' DENTIST.

526
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:15,934
- HE'S A RAPIST.

527
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:17,534
- I NEVER DID ANYTHING
TO YOU.

528
00:29:17,534 --> 00:29:18,601
WE MET IN A BAR.

529
00:29:18,601 --> 00:29:19,901
BUT SHE CAME ON TO ME.

530
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:21,067
AND THEN WE GET IN THE CAR,

531
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:23,100
SHE PULLS A GUN ON ME.
- YOU PANICKED.

532
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,767
- BECAUSE
YOU WERE GONNA SHOOT ME.

533
00:29:24,767 --> 00:29:26,334
- NO,
BECAUSE YOU RECOGNIZED ME.

534
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:28,234
- NO. I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE
IN MY LIFE.

535
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:31,534
- YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO I AM!
- SHE'S CRAZY.

536
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:34,567
WE GOT A MENTAL SITUATION
GOING ON HERE.

537
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,200
- YOU IN THE CORNER.
- YOU BELIEVE HIM?

538
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,868
[cell phone vibrates]
- SHE NEEDS HELP.

539
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:39,767
THIS WOMAN NEEDS HELP.
- YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT.

540
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:43,167
FULL OF SHIT!
- OVER THERE.

541
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:46,334
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS CALL.
STAY THERE TILL I GET BACK.

542
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:47,901
- DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE
WITH HER!

543
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:51,200
- DO NOT MOVE
FROM THIS SPOT.

544
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,934
- AH, HELP!

545
00:29:55,934 --> 00:29:59,601
- EVERYTHING OKAY?
- DIE-DIE.

546
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:01,734
- HI-HI. HARRISON.

547
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:02,901
- I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING,

548
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,567
BUT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE A BREAK.

549
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:07,367
- IT'S WILD HEARING HIM TALK.
- ISN'T IT?

550
00:30:07,367 --> 00:30:09,367
I PUT HIM DOWN,
AND HE WAS UP TWO HOURS LATER

551
00:30:09,367 --> 00:30:11,934
TALKING UP A STORM,
WEREN'T YOU?

552
00:30:11,934 --> 00:30:15,767
* FLIES IN THE BUTTERMILK,
SHOO FLY SHOO *

553
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,367
HERE, LET ME GET YOU
ON THE SPEAKER,

554
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:19,634
AND YOU CAN SING TO HIM TOO.

555
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:23,300
* LOST MY PARTNER,
WHAT'LL I DO? *

556
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,701
DEXTER.

557
00:30:24,701 --> 00:30:27,834
both: * LOST MY PARTNER,
WHAT'LL I DO? *

558
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:31,501
* LOST MY PARTNER,
WHAT'LL I DO? *

559
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:35,133
* SKIP TO THE LOU,
MY DARLING *

560
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,934
- WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO KEEP YOU.

561
00:30:36,934 --> 00:30:38,801
- I'M AFRAID TO ASK,
BUT...

562
00:30:38,801 --> 00:30:40,934
- YOU WANT ME TO STAY
A FEW MORE HOURS?

563
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:42,133
- I'LL BE HOME AS SOON
AS I CAN.

564
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,634
THERE'S NO PLACE
I'D RATHER BE RIGHT NOW.

565
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:47,300
BELIEVE ME.
- DIE-DIE.

566
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,534

I LOVE YOU.

568
00:30:51,534 --> 00:30:55,267
[Dan yelling]

569
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:56,834
- WHO ARE THEY?
- GET OFF OF ME!

570
00:30:56,834 --> 00:30:58,133
- WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?

571
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,601
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!

572
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:03,868
- HUH?

573
00:31:03,868 --> 00:31:08,267
HE'S A FUCKING LIAR!
HE KNOWS WHO THEY ARE!

574
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:11,067
WHO ARE THEY?
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?

575
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:13,934
- YOU ARE RUINING MY LIFE!

576
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:17,934
[Dan groaning]
- THEY RUINED MINE.

577
00:31:22,133 --> 00:31:23,200
- IF WE DON'T GET HELP,

578
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,934
DAN THE DENTIST IS GOING
TO EXPIRE.

579
00:31:24,934 --> 00:31:28,167
- I DON'T CARE.
IT'S WHAT HE DESERVES.

580
00:31:28,167 --> 00:31:32,334
IT'S WHAT THEY ALL DESERVE.
- SHH.

581
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,467
- THEY SHOULD ALL GET--

582
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:35,834
- [whispers]
HE'S SAYING SOMETHING.

583
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:38,534
HE'S TALKING TO SOMEONE.
- SHE FUCKING SHOT ME.

584
00:31:38,534 --> 00:31:42,033
- MY PHONE.
- CAN YOU HEAR ME?

585
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,767
- SHE SHOT ME.

586
00:31:45,767 --> 00:31:48,834
SHE'S ALIVE.
YOU HEAR ME?

587
00:31:50,934 --> 00:31:54,801
THAT LAST FUCKING BITCH
IS ALIVE.

588
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:10,734
[groans]

589
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,667
THEY'RE GONNA FIND YOU...

590
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:20,200
YOU CUNT.

591
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:24,133
- DIE-DIE.
[neck snaps]

592
00:32:33,501 --> 00:32:35,267
LUMEN DIDN'T WITNESS
HER MOTHER'S MURDER,

593
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:38,767
BUT SHE WAS BORN IN BLOOD...

594
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:41,667
LIKE ME.

595
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:45,701
SOME EXPERIENCES ARE SO BIG,
THEY CHANGE YOUR DNA.

596
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:49,534
- WHAT NOW?

597
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:52,567
- WE CLEAN UP.
HOMICIDE WILL BE ON US SOON.

598
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,300
HOSE THIS AREA DOWN.

599
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,167
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING FLOWS
THROUGH THE GRATE.

600
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:01,434
[turns water on]

601
00:33:01,434 --> 00:33:03,734
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

602
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:07,667
- TO GET MY CAR.
WE HAVE TO MOVE THIS BODY.

603
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:17,200
- ABOUT TIME.

604
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
COME ON.

605
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:23,100
A HOOKER
CALLED IN SOME GUNSHOTS,

606
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,801
BUT DIDN'T ACTUALLY SEE
THE SHOOTER.

607
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:28,033
- WHERE'S THE BODY?
- WELL, HAVEN'T FOUND IT YET.

608
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:30,734
- THEN WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

609
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:35,067
- HEY.

610
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,400
BLOOD.

611
00:33:39,968 --> 00:33:42,033
BULLET HOLES,

612
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:44,300
LOTS OF BLOOD,
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF BLOOD--

613
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,601
DEFINITELY SOME SORT
OF HOMICIDAL SITUATION HERE.

614
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:50,133
- A HOMICIDAL SITUATION
REQUIRES A BODY.

615
00:33:50,133 --> 00:33:51,567
WHY DON'T WE LET THE EMTs
HANDLE IT?

616
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,033
- YOUR AVERAGE PERSON
WON'T SURVIVE

617
00:33:53,033 --> 00:33:54,334
THIS AMOUNT OF BLOOD LOSS.

618
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:02,067
THERE.
THAT BLOOD TRAIL THERE.

619
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:05,467
SEE IT? GOOD CHANCE THAT TRAIL
ENDS AT A DEAD BODY.

620
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:07,367
DEXTER'S EN ROUTE, BUT--
- I GET IT. WE CAN'T WAIT.

621
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:11,400
WILL YOU TWO GUYS FOLLOW US IN,
IN CASE THIS BLEEDER'S ALIVE?

622
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,400
- WHOA.

623
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,100
[cell phone beeps]

624
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,067
THIS DUDE IS A HALF LITER
FROM DEAD.

625
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:53,067
[cell phone rings]
- YEAH.

626
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,834
- HEY, FUCKWAD, ARE YOU TAKING
THE SCENIC ROUTE?

627
00:34:54,834 --> 00:34:57,634
- SORRY. I WAS, UH,
WITH HARRISON.

628
00:34:57,634 --> 00:35:01,267
HE SAID HIS FIRST WORDS--
"BYE-BYE."

629
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:04,033
- YEAH? THAT'S SWEET.
- YEAH, IT WAS.

630
00:35:04,033 --> 00:35:06,000
I REMEMBER YOUR FIRST WORDS--

631
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,234
"SHOES."

632
00:35:07,234 --> 00:35:10,334
YOU WERE VERY GIRLIE
ONCE UPON A TIME.

633
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:12,934
- THAT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE I ALWAYS
REMEMBER MY FIRST WORDS AS BEING

634
00:35:12,934 --> 00:35:14,067
"HURRY THE FUCK UP."

635
00:35:14,067 --> 00:35:15,267
- ALMOST THERE.

636
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:16,734
- MASUKA AND I TRACKED
THIS DUDE'S BLOOD

637
00:35:16,734 --> 00:35:19,100
TO A PAY PHONE
INSIDE A WAREHOUSE.

638
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,267
- YOU DID?
- I THINK THIS WAY.

639
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:22,801
- YEAH.
WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING.

640
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:24,934

644
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,400
- YOU CHANGED YOUR CLOTHES.

645
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,400
- HERE.
THIS IS ALL I HAVE.

646
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,868

- THE POLICE ARE CLOSE.
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

GO TO THIS ADDRESS--
3319 MEADOW LANE.

I HAVE IT FROM HERE.

655
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,934
- YOU WANT ME TO GO NOW?

00:36:17,868 --> 00:36:21,434
- GO, NOW. GO!

662
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:25,901
COMPARTMENTALIZATION
IS A JOKE.

663
00:36:25,901 --> 00:36:29,100
FIRES RIP THROUGH BUILDINGS
ALL THE TIME

664
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,300
NO MATTER HOW CLOSED OFF
PARTS OF THEM ARE.

665
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,601
LIFE IS THE SAME WAY.

666
00:36:35,467 --> 00:36:37,567
IT CANNOT BE CONTAINED.

667
00:37:17,534 --> 00:37:21,467
- FUCK. MAYBE WE SHOULD
DOUBLE BACK THE WAY WE CAME.

668
00:37:29,234 --> 00:37:32,067
- IS THAT...?

669
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:34,534
- DEXTER'S CAR.

670
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,434
DEXTER.

671
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,634
- YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE
WHAT I FOUND.

672
00:37:53,434 --> 00:37:56,601
- WHAT IN THE MOTHER OF FUCK
WENT ON IN HERE?

673
00:37:56,601 --> 00:37:59,100
- I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

674
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:04,667
TWO WORDS--
AUTOEROTIC MUMMIFICATION.

675
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:07,400
SEE, MR. PLASTIC MAN

676
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,167
SHOT CAPTAIN BLOODY UNDERPANTS

677
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:12,968
WHILE UNDERPANTS
WAS IN THE CHOKE.

678
00:38:12,968 --> 00:38:16,734
MR. PLASTIC MAN HAS HAMMOCKS
BETWEEN UNDERPANTS' MAN CHOP...

679
00:38:16,734 --> 00:38:19,167
- THANKS TO MASUKA'S
KEEN EXPERTISE,

680
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:21,501
DEBRA WILL BE ABLE
TO CLOSE THIS CASE.

681
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:25,267
EVIDENCE WILL GO INTO A
BANKER'S BOX AND BE FILED AWAY,

682
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:26,434
EVENTUALLY TRANSFERRED TO

683
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:29,367
A STORAGE FACILITY
IN BRADENTON,

684
00:38:29,367 --> 00:38:31,133
AND THAT
IS WHERE IT WILL STAY,

685
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:34,133
LOCKED AWAY
FOREVER IN THE DARK.

686
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:41,100
IF ONLY EVERYTHING
WERE THAT SIMPLE.

687
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,667
- THANK YOU FOR THE VISUAL.

688
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,133
- ASPHYXIATION
HEIGHTENS THE HIGH,

689
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:47,734
BUT IT'S NOT
WITHOUT ITS RISKS.

690
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:49,167
[sighs]

691
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:52,567
EITHER WAY, I WOULDN'T TOUCH
THE NOZZLE OF THAT HOSE.

692
00:38:55,868 --> 00:38:58,267
- ANYTHING TO ADD?

693
00:38:58,267 --> 00:39:01,801
- THE BLOOD IS CONSISTENT
WITH MASUKA'S THEORY.

694
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:05,067
- IF THERE'S ANY FOLLOW-UP,
I'D BE HAPPY TO DO IT.

695
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,334
- WE'RE GOOD HERE?

696
00:39:06,334 --> 00:39:08,267
- YOU JUST LANDED.

697
00:39:08,267 --> 00:39:10,300
- I HAVE TO RELIEVE SONYA.

698
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,734
- YEAH, WE'RE GOOD.
DRIVE SAFE.

699
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,601
WHAT A NIGHT.

700
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,334
- YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

701
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:26,467
- I'M HERE, AREN'T I?

702
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,701
- ANGEL?

703
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:36,534
- THIS IS YASMIN ARAGON.

704
00:39:36,534 --> 00:39:39,200
- WHAT IS SHE DOING
ON MY COUCH?

705
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,000
- MISS ARAGON IS FRIENDS
WITH LOS HERMANOS FUENTES.

706
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,367
SHE ALSO HAS A BOATLOAD
OF DRUG CHARGES

707
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:50,234
AGAINST HER.

708
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:53,701
SEEMS LIKE A TRADE
IS IN ORDER.

709
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:56,834
- SO ARE WE GONNA DO THIS
OR NOT?

710
00:39:58,901 --> 00:40:01,467
- GIVE US A MINUTE.

711
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:06,534
- EXCUSE ME.

712
00:40:16,334 --> 00:40:20,367
I SAW THAT SHE WAS WEARING
A SANTA MUERTE NECKLACE,

713
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:22,868
SO I INTRODUCED MYSELF.

714
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:25,567
IF WE AGREE TO DROP
HER DRUG CHARGES,

715
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:26,767
SHE THINKS SHE CAN GET

716
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,601
THE FUENTES BROTHERS
IN THE CLUB.

717
00:40:28,601 --> 00:40:31,033
THAT IS...

718
00:40:31,033 --> 00:40:35,367
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE US
ANOTHER CHANCE.

719
00:40:35,367 --> 00:40:39,467
I'M SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING...

720
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:42,534
ABOUT LOSING MY TEMPER,
ABOUT WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

721
00:40:42,534 --> 00:40:44,567
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

722
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,367
- SAY THAT AGAIN?

723
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:50,300
- YOU WERE RIGHT.
- I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

724
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,767
- I DID GO TO I.A.D.

725
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:53,734
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
MY HUSBAND DISCIPLINED.

726
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:56,834
I REALLY LIKE
BEING MARRIED TO YOU, ANGEL.

727
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:58,334
- AND I YOU.

728
00:40:58,334 --> 00:41:00,334
- IT'S SOMETHING I NEVER THOUGHT
WOULD HAPPEN TO ME

729
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:03,033
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
MAKING A NAME FOR MYSELF,

730
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:04,834
AND NOW I'M THIS CLOSE
TO MAKING CAPTAIN.

731
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:06,934
- AND I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING TO STOP YOU.

732
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:08,968
- NOT ON PURPOSE, I KNOW.

733
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:11,434
BUT GET A STINK ON YOU,

734
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:13,934
AND I START TO STINK TOO.

735
00:41:13,934 --> 00:41:17,200
- WE'LL STOCK UP
ON DEODORANT.

736
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,434
- [laughs]

737
00:41:19,434 --> 00:41:21,501
NICE JOB
BRINGING IN THE GIRL.

738
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:23,534
- YEAH.

739
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:28,267
BETTER THAN A PUPPY?

740
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:30,234
- I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT HOME.

741
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:46,567
- HELLO?

742
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,968
HEY.

743
00:42:00,968 --> 00:42:02,767
- HEY.

744
00:42:02,767 --> 00:42:04,200
LAST ONE.

745
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,901
SORRY.

746
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,467
- YOU GOT GLITTER
ON YOUR FACE.

747
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:10,234
- YEAH...

748
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:12,601
HAZARD OF THE JOB.

749
00:42:12,601 --> 00:42:14,667
- I'M NOT SURE
IT'S IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION

750
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:17,067
THAT YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR FACE
IN BOOBIE MCGEE'S TITS.

751
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:18,400
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

752
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,300
THE FIRST RULE OF WORKING
UNDERCOVER IS TO BLEND IN.

753
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,467
- YOU DISAPPEARED.

754
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:24,400
- I DID, DIDN'T I?

755
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,467
- IT'S NOT FUNNY.

756
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:29,167
[sighs]
FUCK.

757
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:31,767
I...

758
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,567
I HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU.

759
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:38,033
- YOU DO?

760
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:40,100
- I TRIED NOT TO.

761
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,067
- I LIKE YOU TOO...

762
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:49,167
UH, MORE THAN "LIKE."

763
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,234
- YOU DO?

764
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,601
- YEAH.

765
00:42:51,601 --> 00:42:55,267
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KEEPS PUTTING THE BRAKES ON.

766
00:42:55,267 --> 00:42:58,033
- WELL, WHAT IF I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT ANYMORE?

767
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,501
- THAT'D MAKE ME VERY HAPPY.

768
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:08,167
- IF THIS
IS GONNA END BADLY...

769
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:10,367
WILL YOU PLEASE
JUST TELL ME NOW?

770
00:43:12,567 --> 00:43:16,901
- MORGAN, I JUST SAID
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

771
00:43:16,901 --> 00:43:20,467
I MEAN,
WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?

772
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:23,267
- WELL, I MEAN,
SOMETIMES YOU MUMBLE,

773
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,767
AND IT'S KIND OF HARD
TO UNDERSTAND YOU.

774
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:27,701
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

775
00:43:27,701 --> 00:43:30,133
- HOW'S THIS?

776
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:46,100
- I TRIED TO SEND THIS WOMAN
1,500 MILES AWAY,

777
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,267
AND SHE BOOMERANGED

778
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:49,801
BACK INTO THE HOUSE
I SHARED WITH RITA.

779
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:51,801
LUMEN?

780
00:43:51,801 --> 00:43:52,934
SO MUCH FOR KEEPING

781
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:55,033
THE DIFFERENT PARTS
OF MY LIFE SEPARATE.

782
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,434
SORRY,
I'LL JUST BE IN HERE.

783
00:44:24,734 --> 00:44:27,634
[water ripples]

784
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:30,901
THERE ARE TOWELS...
SOMEWHERE.

785
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:35,434
- I FOUND SOME IN A BOX.

786
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:37,234
I ALSO FOUND THIS ROBE.

787
00:44:37,234 --> 00:44:40,100
IS IT OKAY IF I BORROW IT?

788
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,434
- SURE.

789
00:44:45,467 --> 00:44:49,400
- THE TUB'S NOT DRAINING.

790
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,934
- SOMETIMES
THE THINGY GETS STUCK.

791
00:45:01,667 --> 00:45:03,067
- ARE YOU OKAY?

792
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,667
DO YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN?

793
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,234
- [sighs]

794
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:11,868
YEAH, FOR A MINUTE.

795
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
- I KNOW YOU...

796
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,267
WHAT YOU ARE...

797
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:23,067
DEEP DOWN--

798
00:45:23,067 --> 00:45:24,734
ASIDE FROM YOUR POLICE JOB

799
00:45:24,734 --> 00:45:28,100
AND YOUR
EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES.

800
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:32,934
YOU'RE A FATHER.

801
00:45:32,934 --> 00:45:36,133
I SAW THE PICTURES
OUT THERE.

802
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:37,801
THREE CHILDREN?

803
00:45:40,934 --> 00:45:44,133
- THE TWO OLDEST
ARE WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS--

804
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:48,601
THEIR DAD'S MOM AND DAD.

805
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:51,234
- YOU HAVE A SON?

806
00:45:51,234 --> 00:45:52,968
- HARRISON.

807
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,334
HE JUST STARTED TALKING...

808
00:45:57,334 --> 00:45:59,934
TODAY.

809
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:05,334
HE'S TREMENDOUS.

810
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,701
- IT'S...

811
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,701
JUST THE TWO OF YOU?

812
00:46:13,701 --> 00:46:15,267
- [sighs]

813
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:18,801
AND AN IRISH
SUPERHERO NANNY.

814
00:46:25,133 --> 00:46:27,834
NEVER THOUGHT MY LIFE
WOULD TURN OUT LIKE THIS.

815
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:35,901
- I HAD IMAGINED...

816
00:46:35,901 --> 00:46:39,400
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LIFE
FOR MYSELF TOO.

817
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,901
I ALWAYS DID EVERYTHING
BY THE BOOK, YOU KNOW?

818
00:46:41,901 --> 00:46:43,367
GO, GO, GO.

819
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,734
NEVER STOPPED TO THINK.

820
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:51,100
THERE WAS HIGH SCHOOL AND
COLLEGE AND GRADUATE SCHOOL...

821
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,367
OWEN.

822
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:57,634
WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED

823
00:46:57,634 --> 00:47:01,100
AT THE HOUSE
THAT I GREW UP IN.

824
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:04,234
ON MY WEDDING DAY, I...

825
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:06,567
I TRIED ON THE DRESS,
AND I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW

826
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:10,000
AT THE BACKYARD
WHERE THE AISLE WAS, AND...

827
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,501
I SAW EVERYTHING
THAT THAT AISLE WAS LEADING TO--

828
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,167
BABIES AND...

829
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,067
MATCHING DINNERWARE...

830
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:22,467
SUNDAY BARBECUES.

831
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:27,601
AND I COULDN'T BREATHE.

832
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:29,968
I HAD TO GET
OUT OF THERE AND...

833
00:47:29,968 --> 00:47:34,200
FIND SOMETHING...

834
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,567
MORE.

835
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,067
THEN EVERYTHING HAPPENED,
AND...

836
00:47:49,067 --> 00:47:51,400
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT,

837
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,000
"THIS IS WHAT I GET

838
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,567
FOR TRYING TO...

839
00:47:57,567 --> 00:47:59,834
LIVE MY OWN LIFE."

840
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:04,434
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

841
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:08,701
- A LITTLE.

842
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:16,667
- BUT TONIGHT
I FELT THIS, LIKE...

843
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:19,200
THIS...

844
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,200
PEACE.

845
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,200
AND IT'S BECAUSE HE'S DEAD.

846
00:48:32,467 --> 00:48:36,767
[voice breaking] AND I KNOW
THAT IT'S NOT GONNA LAST.

847
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:38,100
AND WHEN IT WEARS OFF,

848
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,868
I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND
THE REST OF THEM...

849
00:48:41,868 --> 00:48:43,467
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

850
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:46,167
THAT I'LL FIND
THAT PEACE AGAIN.

851
00:48:50,934 --> 00:48:55,033
I DON'T EVEN HAVE A NAME
FOR WHAT I'M FEELING.

852
00:48:55,033 --> 00:48:56,534
- I DO...

853
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:59,367
THE DARK PASSENGER.

854
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:02,033
I CAN'T GET REVENGE
FOR RITA'S DEATH,

855
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:05,934
BUT I CAN HELP LUMEN
AVENGE WHAT WAS DONE TO HER.

856
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:15,200
HOW MANY MORE WERE THERE?
