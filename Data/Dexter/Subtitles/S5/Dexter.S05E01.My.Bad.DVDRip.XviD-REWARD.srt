1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,467
- SO HOW THE HELL WAS YOUR DATE
WITH RITA LAST NIGHT?

2
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:15,400
- GREAT. I THINK I MET
THE RIGHT WOMAN FOR ME.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,701
SHE'S PERFECT, BECAUSE RITA
IS AS DAMAGED AS ME.

4
00:00:20,033 --> 00:00:21,667
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FOUND THE ONE GOOD,

5
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,834
TRULY DECENT MAN
LEFT ON THE PLANET.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,167
- I HAVE A DARK SIDE TOO.
- SOMEHOW I DOUBT THAT.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,400
- I WATCHED MY MOTHER DIE
WHEN I WAS THREE.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
- AAH!

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,300
- SHE WAS MURDERED
IN FRONT OF ME.

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,734
- YOU HAVE YOUR DEMONS,

11
00:00:36,734 --> 00:00:38,667
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE A SLAVE TO THEM.

12
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:39,901
- I WISH THAT WERE TRUE.

13
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:42,234
I WANT TO SOMEDAY BE CONTENT

14
00:00:42,234 --> 00:00:43,567
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.

15
00:00:43,567 --> 00:00:45,667
I WANT...
- A NORMAL LIFE.

16
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,901
- I WANNA MARRY YOU.
- YES!

17
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:49,667
- YOU GUYS ARE MY FAMILY.

18
00:00:49,667 --> 00:00:53,901
NOW I HAVE A PARTNER FOR LIFE.
I'M CONTENT.

19
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:55,534
MAYBE EVEN HAPPY.

20
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:58,100
- I HOPE YOU'RE NOT TAKING
ANY OF THIS SERIOUSLY--

21
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,367
THE WIFE, THE KIDS.

22
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:00,601
IT'S ALL GREAT CAMOUFLAGE.

23
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,367
- IT'S GOTTEN MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

24
00:01:02,367 --> 00:01:04,033
- I'M PREGNANT.

25
00:01:04,033 --> 00:01:06,300
- YOU WANT TO SEE HIM
COME INTO THE WORLD.

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,300
- YES.

27
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,300
RAISE HIM WITH RITA.
- I KNOW.

28
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,200
- I'VE NEVER WANTED ANYTHING
SO MUCH IN MY LIFE.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,100
WANNA KNOW A SECRET?
DADDY KILLS PEOPLE.

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,501
[muffled scream]

31
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:22,434
- THERE'S A MONSTER
WALKING AROUND FREE.

32
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:24,634
- I CALL HIM
THE TRINITY KILLER.

33
00:01:24,634 --> 00:01:26,434
KILLS IN THREES.

34
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:29,901
- TRINITY'S A HUSBAND,
A FATHER.

35
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:31,501
HE'S...LIKE ME.

36
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:34,467
- WHAT KIND OF FATHER
KEEPS BLOOD SLIDES IN HIS SHED?

37
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,133
- IF I DON'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO HIDE THIS,

38
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:39,000
I'M GONNA LOSE MY FAMILY.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,968
ARTHUR'S KEPT THIS UP
FOR WHAT--20 YEARS?

40
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,133
MY FAMILY
MAY NOT LAST 20 MINUTES.

41
00:01:44,133 --> 00:01:45,901
- ARTHUR MITCHELL.

42
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,968
- KYLE BUTLER.

43
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:48,267
- ONLY WAY IT WAS GONNA WORK

44
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:50,567
IS IF I JUMPED IN
WITH BOTH FEET.

45
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,434
- JUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET, HUH?

46
00:01:52,434 --> 00:01:55,400
- THIS IS YOUR
NEW ROLE MODEL, DEX?

47
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,934
GET THAT AX FROM HIM.
KILL HIM NOW.

48
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:00,934
- I STILL HAVE THINGS
TO LEARN FROM HIM.

49
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,133
- YOU'RE JUGGLING
TOO MANY PEOPLE, DEXTER.

50
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:06,100
BLOOD TECH, HUSBAND, FATHER,
SERIAL KILLER.

51
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,000
NOW KYLE BUTLER.
WHICH ONE ARE YOU?

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,167
- ALL OF THEM.

53
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:10,434
- HELLO...

54
00:02:10,434 --> 00:02:11,934
DEXTER MORGAN.

55
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,133
- HELLO, ARTHUR MITCHELL.

56
00:02:16,133 --> 00:02:17,434
[crunch]

57
00:02:17,434 --> 00:02:18,534
[beep]

58
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:19,601
Rita: HEY, SWEETIE.

59
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:21,267
THE MOON TONIGHT
IS GONNA BE AMAZING.

60
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:24,267
SO TAKE A MOMENT.
WE LOVE YOU. BYE.

61
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,868
[Harrison crying]

62
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:38,067
- RITA?

63
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:43,434
BORN IN BLOOD.
BOTH OF US.

64
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:45,667
I THOUGHT I COULD
CHANGE WHAT I AM,

65
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:49,100
KEEP MY FAMILY SAFE.

66
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,601
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I DO.

67
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,033
THIS IS FATE.

68
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,634
[quirky music]

69
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:13,567

70
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:54,467
[crying echoes distantly]

71
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,634
[siren wails]

72
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:07,868
[tires screech]

73
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:11,200
[crying sounds normal]

74
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,234
- SIR, DID YOU CALL THIS IN?

75
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:17,767
SIR.
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

76
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:21,634
[crying grows distant,
echoes]

77
00:05:21,634 --> 00:05:24,267
- I'VE WATCHED 67 PEOPLE DIE...

78
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:27,834
AND AT THE MOMENT OF TRUTH,
I LOOKED INTO THEIR EYES

79
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,901
AND THEY KNEW AND I KNEW

80
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:32,434
THEY GOT WHAT THEY DESERVED.

81
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:35,234
BUT WHAT IF THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENS?

82
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,100
IF YOU DON'T GET
WHAT YOU DESERVE?

83
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,834
IF WHAT YOU DESERVE
IS A WHITE PICKET FENCE

84
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:43,501
AND YOUR KIDS ALL AROUND

85
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:46,501
AND A HUSBAND WHO LOVES YOU?

86
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:49,067
WHAT IF THE LEAST YOU DESERVE
IS A REAL HUMAN BEING

87
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:54,133
AND WHAT YOU GET INSTEAD
IS ME?

88
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:58,167
- SIR. SIR, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
THE CHILD INTO SAFE CUSTODY NOW.

89
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:01,300
SIR, HAND ME THE CHILD.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
BACK OFF!
- MA'AM!

91
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,467
- MIAMI HOMICIDE.
HE IS TOO.

92
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,601
I SAID BACK THE FUCK OFF!

93
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,701
WHAT HAPPENED?

94
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:12,934
[Harrison crying]

95
00:06:17,434 --> 00:06:19,601
- RITA'S INSIDE.

96
00:06:19,601 --> 00:06:22,000
IT WAS ME.

97
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:28,667
[crying echoes, fades]

98
00:06:28,667 --> 00:06:32,067
- SKIN'S WRINKLED FROM HOURS
IN THE ALKALINE WATER.

99
00:06:32,067 --> 00:06:33,934
RIGOR MORTIS FULL-BLOWN.

100
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:36,834
EPIDERMAL MOTTLING.

101
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,901
I IMAGINED HER NAKED
PLENTY OF TIMES,

102
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,334
BUT NEVER LIKE THIS.

103
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,567
SINGLE CUT
TO THE FEMORAL ARTERY.

104
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:46,334
WE'RE LOOKING AT
TRINITY'S M.O. HERE.

105
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:49,033
- DID HE EVER KILL A MARRIED
WOMAN IN A BATHTUB?

106
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,367
- FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

107
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:53,267
UNFORTUNATELY FOR DEXTER.

108
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,267
WE'RE STILL WAITING
ON THE CORONER TO MOVE THE BODY.

109
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,434
BUT OVERALL LIVIDITY
PUTS TIME OF DEATH

110
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:07,400
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN
8 AND 12 HOURS...AGO.

111
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,968
[police radio,
background chatter]

112
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:16,067
[sirens]

113
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,334
- YOU OKAY?

114
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,701
- DEXTER CAME HOME TO THAT.

115
00:07:27,701 --> 00:07:31,767
HE'S GONNA NEED
OUR SUPPORT HERE.

116
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,634
OBVIOUSLY.

117
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:36,667
- WHAT DO YOU WANT US
TO DO WITH HIM?

118
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:37,901
- THE FIRST THING
I WANT YOU TO DO

119
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,834
IS PACK UP
AND GET OUTTA THERE.

120
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:42,434
- WELL--
- WHAT?

121
00:07:42,434 --> 00:07:44,601
- THE FBI'S HERE.
TRINITY'S THEIR CASE.

122
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,234
I ALREADY CEDED JURISDICTION.

123
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:48,067
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT HIM FOR?

124
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,501
- IT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING
ON THE WAY OVER.

125
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:53,834
RITA'S ONE OF OURS.
SHE'S FAMILY.

126
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,267
 <i>WE</i> SHOULD BE WORKING
ON THIS FOR DEXTER.

127
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,367
- DAMN IT, ANGEL, IT'S DONE!

128
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:00,901
JUST DO WHAT I SAY.

129
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:03,167
- SHE'S STRESSED.
WE ALL ARE.

130
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:05,634
[FBI agents chattering]

131
00:08:05,634 --> 00:08:09,634
[helicopter blades thrumming,
siren wailing]

132
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:23,968
[heartbeat thumping,
sounds muted]

133
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:27,334
- MY FATHER HARRY
TAUGHT ME A FEW SIMPLE RULES.

134
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:30,267
NEVER HURT AN INNOCENT
AND NEVER MAKE A SCENE.

135
00:08:33,834 --> 00:08:35,501
HARRY?

136
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:42,100
WHERE ARE YOU, NOW,
WHEN I REALLY NEED YOU?

137
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:46,534
WHEN IT'S MY WIFE
IN THE BODY BAG,

138
00:08:46,534 --> 00:08:47,634
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING,

139
00:08:47,634 --> 00:08:51,834
AND IT'S THE NEIGHBOR CRYING,
NOT ME?

140
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:54,567
[heartbeat thumping,
sounds muted]

141
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,167
[sounds back to normal,
police radio chatter, sirens]

142
00:08:57,167 --> 00:09:00,200
[helicopter blades thrumming]

143
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,501
- SIR?

144
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,634
WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

145
00:09:10,167 --> 00:09:12,467
THE FIRST RESPONDERS TOLD ME

146
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:14,534
WHEN THEY WENT INSIDE
AND FOUND YOUR WIFE

147
00:09:14,534 --> 00:09:17,868
YOU SAID, "IT WAS ME."

148
00:09:17,868 --> 00:09:19,701
- YOU SURE?

149
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:23,167
- THAT'S WHAT WAS REPORTED
TO ME, YEAH.

150
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:25,434
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SAID.

151
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,400
IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYTHING.
I'M VERY UPSET.

152
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,300
- OF COURSE YOU ARE.
WHO WOULDN'T BE?

153
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,434
MR. MORGAN,

154
00:09:31,434 --> 00:09:34,167
BEFORE YOU CAME HOME
AND FOUND YOUR WIFE,

155
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,667
WHERE DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE AGAIN?

156
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:37,334
- DEXTER, TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES,
THEN WE'RE GOING HOME.

157
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,167
- I WAS ASKING HIM A QUESTION.
- HE ALREADY SAID HE CAME HOME

158
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:40,467
AND HE FOUND HER THERE.

159
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,868
IF YOU WANNA HELP,
WHY DON'T YOU FIND TRINITY?

160
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:44,501
OR IS DOING SOMETHING
ACTUALLY USEFUL

161
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,000
NOT IN YOUR FUCKING
JOB DESCRIPTION?

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,367
- DETECTIVE MORGAN.
- FBI?

163
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:49,934
FUCKING BUNCH OF IDIOTS.

164
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,634
- STOP.

165
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,567
FINISH UP HERE,
THEN TAKE YOUR BROTHER HOME.

166
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:57,167
YOU WANNA TALK TO DEXTER,
SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT.

167
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,701
- I'LL DO THAT.

168
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,701
- HE CAN SLEEP ON THE FLOOR

169
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,734
UNTIL WE CAN BRING HIS CRIB
OVER FROM THE HOUSE.

170
00:10:21,734 --> 00:10:23,534
IT'LL BE SAFEST,
DON'T YOU THINK?

171
00:10:23,534 --> 00:10:24,534
[Dexter grunts]

172
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:26,834
I GOTTA TELL YOU, DEXTER,

173
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,067
DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE,
"IT WAS ME."

174
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:31,234
PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND.

175
00:10:31,234 --> 00:10:33,901
IN FACT, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

176
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,868
WHAT DID YOU EVEN MEAN?

177
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,133
DEXTER.

178
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,367
[calmly]
- THIS IS DEXTER MORGAN.

179
00:10:47,367 --> 00:10:50,701
3319 MEADOW LANE.
- WHAT IS YOUR EMERGENCY?

180
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:53,667
- I JUST GOT HOME AND FOUND
MY WIFE DEAD IN THE BATHTUB.

182
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:56,567

183
00:10:56,567 --> 00:10:58,167
- THE 911 CALL DEXTER MADE.

184
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,501
LISTEN.
[click]

185
00:11:00,501 --> 00:11:03,067
- I JUST GOT HOME AND FOUND
MY WIFE DEAD IN THE BATHTUB.

186
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,601
- DID YOU SAY
YOUR WIFE IS DEAD?

187
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:06,601
- YES, I DID.

188
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,834
SHE HAS AN APPROXIMATELY
1-INCH INCISION

189
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,133
MIDWAY UP HER RIGHT THIGH,
DISSECTING THE FEMORAL ARTERY.

190
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,834
- ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ENOUGH.

191
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:14,067
HE OBVIOUSLY'S IN SHOCK.

192
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,834
- "MIDWAY UP HER
RIGHT THIGH?

193
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:17,234
DISSECTING
HER FEMORAL ARTERY"?

194
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:20,167
- HABIT OF PRECISION.
- HIS WIFE JUST DIED.

195
00:11:20,167 --> 00:11:22,334
HE'S SUBMITTING A LAB REPORT.

196
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:23,667
SERIOUSLY,
THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR,

197
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:24,968
THE GUY WITH THE,
YOU KNOW, FOREHEAD?

198
00:11:24,968 --> 00:11:28,267
HE WAS MORE BROKEN UP ABOUT
RITA THAN DEXTER WAS.

199
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:30,801
- SO?
- SO IT'S WEIRD, THAT'S ALL.

200
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,133
- WHAT ARE WE WORKING ON HERE?

201
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,734
- NOT RITA.

202
00:11:37,934 --> 00:11:40,634
- IT'S DEXTER'S 911 CALL.

203
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:42,167
- DID YOU HEAR ME OR NOT?

204
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:46,934
I SAID THE CASE
IS WITH THE FBI NOW.

205
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:51,000
- YOU SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HER
ON A HONEYMOON.

206
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:58,501
- YOU WERE RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING--

207
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:01,100
THAT NEIGHBOR ELLIOT
BEING ALL BROKEN UP ABOUT RITA.

208
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,868
I'M THINKING NOW
THERE'S SOME THINGS

209
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,767
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD DEXTER.

210
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:08,067
- WHAT? WHAT SHOULDN'T YOU
HAVE TOLD HIM?

211
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:11,133
- ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT
EXCHANGE OF SALIVA

212
00:12:11,133 --> 00:12:14,334
I WITNESSED AT THANKSGIVING.

213
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,601
AS IN A KISS.
- ELLIOT AND RITA?

214
00:12:16,601 --> 00:12:20,334
- DUDE WAS TOTALLY
IN LOVE WITH HER.

215
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:22,367
- AND DEXTER KNEW.
- YEAH.

216
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,567
IF I'D KNOWN SHE WAS GONNA...

217
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,567
I SHOULD HAVE KEPT
MY BIG MOUTH SHUT.

218
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,667
[cell phone rings]

219
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:42,667
[ringing]

220
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,634
- COULD SOMEONE GET THAT?

[ringing]

222
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,601
OH. DAMN IT.

223
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,968
HELLO.

224
00:12:53,968 --> 00:12:56,801

[carnival music in background]

225
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,234
- HELLO?

226
00:12:58,234 --> 00:12:59,467
- I'M SORRY IF I WOKE YOU,

227
00:12:59,467 --> 00:13:02,667
BUT I HAVE GOT TWO VERY
EXCITED KIDS HERE,

228
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,667
AND RITA'S NOT ANSWERING.

229
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:07,467
- YEAH, THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

230
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:08,767
- OKAY. OKAY, OKAY.

231
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:12,067
BUT FIRST SOMEBODY REALLY
WANTS TO TALK WITH YOU.

232

[giggling]

233
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:15,634

234
00:13:15,634 --> 00:13:17,434
- HEY, CODY, YOU OKAY?

235
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,200
- WE'VE BEEN HAVING
THE BEST DAY.

236
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,968
I HAD COTTON CANDY
FOR BREAKFAST.

237
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,834
- THAT'S GREAT.
Astor: HERE, GIVE ME THE PHONE.

238
00:13:23,834 --> 00:13:25,934
GIMME, GIMME, GIMME.

239
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,968
HEY, DEXTER.
CAN I TALK TO MOM?

240
00:13:27,968 --> 00:13:30,767
- NOT NOW.
- WHY NOT?

241
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,767
- SHE'S, UH...

242
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:35,300
SHE'S IN THE SHOWER.

243
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,200
- WELL...CAN YOU TELL HER
WE MISS HER?

244
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,300
Cody: WE MISS YOU TOO,
DEXTER, AND HARRISON.

245
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,601
Astor: HERE'S MY GRANDMOTHER.

246
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,300
- [laughing]
SO THERE WAS SOMETHING

247
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,734
THAT YOU NEEDED TO TELL ME?

248
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:50,400
- WHEN YOU BRING THEM HOME
TONIGHT, UH...

249
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,734
[Harrison fusses]

250
00:13:51,734 --> 00:13:55,801
COME TO DEB'S APARTMENT
INSTEAD OF THE HOUSE...OKAY?

251
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:59,300
- WHAT HAPPENED,
DID YOU MISS YOUR FLIGHT?

252
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,767
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
I'LL EXPLAIN WHEN YOU GET HERE.

253
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:11,834
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO TELL THEM ABOUT RITA?

254
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:13,434
- [exhales]

255
00:14:13,434 --> 00:14:17,334
I JUST WANT THEM TO HAVE
ONE MORE GOOD DAY.

256
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:21,000
- LOOK, I KNOW
THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT...

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,834
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT NEED TO HAPPEN

258
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,133
BEFORE RITA CAN BE BURIED.

259
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,300
I'VE BEEN ON THE PHONE
ALL MORNING

260
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,734
WITH A FUNERAL DIRECTOR
WHO DOES A LOT OF COPS.

261
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:35,334
AND HE'S WILLING TO SEE US
RIGHT AWAY.

262
00:14:37,701 --> 00:14:39,767
YOU WILLING TO DO THAT?

263
00:14:50,901 --> 00:14:53,100
- I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

264
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,067
- HOW DOES HE DO THAT?

265
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:57,334
- MY SINCERE CONDOLENCES.

266
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,801
- HE SOUNDS LIKE
HE ACTUALLY MEANS IT.

267
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,267
- THANK YOU.

268
00:15:04,267 --> 00:15:06,767
- WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

269
00:15:06,767 --> 00:15:09,033
COFFEE?

270
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,734
WATER?

271
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:13,300
- NO. I'M FINE.

272
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,868
[Harrison fusses]

273
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,601
- THERE ARE KLEENEXES HERE...

274
00:15:22,601 --> 00:15:25,767
IF YOU NEED THEM.

275
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,968
WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW,
DEXTER--

276
00:15:30,968 --> 00:15:34,100
M-MAY I CALL YOU THAT?

277
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,534
WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW,
DEXTER,

278
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,200
IS MAKE SOME VERY
IMPORTANT DECISIONS

279
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,701
ABOUT HOW YOUR WIFE RITA
WILL BE REMEMBERED.

280
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:42,534
- OKAY.

281
00:15:42,534 --> 00:15:45,467
- WE LIKE TO START
WITH THE OBITUARY.

282
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:47,501
IT'S A GOOD WAY TO LET PEOPLE
KNOW ABOUT SERVICES

283
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:49,467
AND WHERE TO SEND
REMEMBRANCES.

284
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:51,400
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT'S A CHANCE TO EXPRESS

285
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,467
YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT RITA
IN YOUR OWN WORDS.

286
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,334
- EXCUSE ME.

287
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:02,200
- I'LL GET YOU SOMETHING
FOR THE PAPER.

288
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,133
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED?

289
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:17,467
- SO THIS IS HOW
NORMAL PEOPLE DO IT.

290
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:20,501
NO HEFTY BAGS.
NO DIESEL FUMES.

291
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:25,334
- [sobbing]

292
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:28,300
- THIS IS WHAT
SHE WOULD HAVE WANTED--

293
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,467
A GRIEVING SPOUSE...

294
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:34,067
FOR ONCE DOING WHAT
A PERSON'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

295
00:16:51,467 --> 00:16:53,501
- DEXTER MORGAN?

296
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:54,934
- RITA?

297
00:16:54,934 --> 00:16:57,601
HI.
- HI.

298
00:16:57,601 --> 00:16:59,100
SORRY I'M LATE.

299
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,601
- THAT'S NO PROBLEM.

300
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,334
- THERE WAS TRAFFIC,
OF COURSE.

301
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,567
I WENT TO THE WRONG CAFE.

302
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,467
I WENT TO THE ONE
IN TOWN.

303
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:10,167
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS
ANYTHING EVEN OUT THIS FAR.

304
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,200
HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE?

305
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,767
- I, UH...
TRACKED IT DOWN.

306
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,801
- SO I--YOUR SISTER...

307
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,634
DEBRA'S TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

308
00:17:24,634 --> 00:17:26,634
- UH-OH.
- OH.

309
00:17:26,634 --> 00:17:28,601
NOTHING BAD, OF COURSE.

310
00:17:28,601 --> 00:17:30,801
- SHE OMITTED THE FACT
THAT I'M AN AX MURDERER?

311
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:34,000
- NO. SHE SAID THAT
YOU WERE A...

312
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,033
BLOODSTAIN PATTERN
ANALYST...

313
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,334
WHICH I HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT THAT IS.

314
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:40,167
- BELIEVE ME,
I BARELY DO EITHER,

315
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,934
AND I DO IT 40 HOURS A WEEK.

316
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,634
- SHE SEEMS NICE,
YOUR SISTER.

317
00:17:46,634 --> 00:17:48,901
- YOU SEEM NICE TOO.

318
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,634
- THANK YOU.

319
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:54,501
- [chuckles]

320
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,300
- SO, UM, WHAT'S GOOD HERE?

321
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,734
I MEAN,
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING SPECIAL

322
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:01,934
TO BRING YOU
ALL THE WAY OUT THIS FAR.

323
00:18:01,934 --> 00:18:03,801
I...

324
00:18:03,801 --> 00:18:05,501
I USUALLY PLAY IT SAFE

325
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,701
AND GO WITH
A CAESAR SALAD.

326
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:10,334
BUT I DON'T
SEE ONE ON HERE.

327
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:13,567
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I'M GONNA GET THE SPECIAL,

328
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,000
THE MUSHROOM RAVIOLI.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,701
DEXTER?

330
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,400
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT?

331
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,701
- YES, I DO.

332
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:28,534
[woman sobbing]

333
00:18:33,634 --> 00:18:35,501
- DEX.

334
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:38,067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

335
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:42,567
- I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT RITA, HOW MUCH...

336
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:44,901
- HOW MUCH YOU MISS HER?

337
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:48,234
- HOW MUCH I LIED TO HER,
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

338
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:57,801
- FUNERAL'S
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

339
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:01,367
I CHOSE AN OAK CASKET.
I HOPE THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

340
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:05,100
WHITE ROSES.
I THINK SHE'D LIKE THOSE.

341
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,334
THEY WANT TO KNOW
IF THERE'S A PARTICULAR DRESS

342
00:19:07,334 --> 00:19:10,267
YOU'D LIKE HER TO BE BURIED IN.

343
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,033
- NOT REALLY.

344
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:15,767
- OKAY.

345
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:17,601
I'LL FIND SOMETHING.

346
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:21,267
QUINN CALLED, AND THE FBI
HAS RELEASED THE CRIME SCENE

347
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,767
AT YOUR HOUSE,

348
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,467
SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS
I WANT TO DO THERE AND...

349
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,434
I'M GONNA DROP YOU TWO OFF
AT THE APARTMENT.

350
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,300
IS THAT OKAY?

351
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,767
- YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

352
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:33,601
[woman sobbing]

353
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:36,434
- YOU'RE WORRYING ME.

354
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:06,734
- I REALLY DIDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO COME.

355
00:20:06,734 --> 00:20:09,133
- WE'RE PARTNERS.
I'M HERE.

356
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:12,000
WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,667
- NOTHING.

358
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:17,133
TRINITY WOULDN'T LEAVE
ANYTHING BEHIND.

359
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,234
- WHAT ARE WE DOING THEN?

360
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:30,234
- I WANTED TO CLEAN
THE PLACE UP.

361
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:32,534
MAKE SURE DEXTER
DIDN'T SEE IT LIKE THIS.

362
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:36,334
- THE FBI LEFT IT THIS WAY.

363
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,968
THEY HAVE PEOPLE
WHO'LL DO THAT.

364
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,434
- THIS MUCH BLOOD,
USUALLY YOU CALL DEXTER.

365
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:42,901
HOW YOU HOLDIN' UP?

366
00:21:46,234 --> 00:21:48,701
- OKAY. I GUESS.

367
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:53,868
I MEAN, YOU KNOW MY BROTHER.
IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TELL.

368
00:21:53,868 --> 00:21:56,901
- NO, I MEAN YOU.
HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP?

369
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:58,601
- OH.

370
00:22:01,334 --> 00:22:02,634
FINE.

371
00:22:02,634 --> 00:22:06,100
NOT USED TO HAVING TO BE
THE STRONG ONE, YOU KNOW?

372
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,334
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN DEXTER.

373
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,968
AND NOW...
- HE'S THE STRONG ONE?

374
00:22:13,968 --> 00:22:17,267
TO ME IT'S ALWAYS SEEMED
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

375
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,567
- SWEAR TO GOD,
I CAN'T EVEN...

376
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:24,968
TELL WHAT HE'S THINKING.

377
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,234
- [whispering] SORRY.

378
00:22:26,234 --> 00:22:29,167
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE.

379
00:22:29,167 --> 00:22:30,934
[whispers]
IT'S OKAY.

380
00:22:34,367 --> 00:22:37,801
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW.

381
00:22:57,701 --> 00:23:00,367
[knocking, kids' voices]

382
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:03,167
- HURRY, COME ON, OPEN UP!
DEXTER!

383
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:05,567
[knocking continues]
Maura: ARE YOU THERE?

384
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,734
[knocking, chattering]

385
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,334
- DEXTER,
YOU CAME BACK EARLY!

386
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:13,467
OH!

387
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,334
- HEY, GUYS.
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

388
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:17,734
- IT WAS AWESOME.
- WE GOT YOU STUFF.

389
00:23:17,734 --> 00:23:20,367
[laughter]

390
00:23:20,367 --> 00:23:24,634
- PERFECT.
- THERE'S ONE FOR MOM TOO.

391
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:31,467
- WHERE IS SHE?

392
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,467
- SHE'S NOT HERE.

393
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:37,334
- WELL, WHERE IS SHE?

394
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,033
- JUST...SIT DOWN.

395
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:41,667
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

396
00:23:43,901 --> 00:23:46,367
- DEXTER?

397
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,701
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

398
00:23:48,701 --> 00:23:50,167
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU'RE--

399
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,501
YOU'RE FREAKING ME OUT.

400
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,300
- SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOM.

401
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,634
Cody: SOMETHING BAD?

402
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:06,267
- YEAH. SOMETHING BAD.

403
00:24:06,267 --> 00:24:08,767
- IS SHE OKAY?

404
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,400
- A MAN CAME INTO OUR HOUSE,

405
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,601
AND YOUR MOTHER
CAME HOME AND...

406
00:24:15,601 --> 00:24:16,868
HE KILLED HER.

407
00:24:16,868 --> 00:24:18,534
Cody: WHAT? SHE GOT KILLED?

408
00:24:18,534 --> 00:24:20,200
SOMEBODY KILLED HER?
Astor: NO, SHE'S FINE.

409
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,801
Maura: DEXTER.
WHAT--

410
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,400
Astor: YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?
Maura: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

411
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,100
YOU SAID SPEND THE DAY
AT DISNEY WORLD.

412
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,133
[crying]

413
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,267
- I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

414
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,400
[Maura crying]

415
00:24:53,734 --> 00:24:56,567
ASTOR?
- GO AWAY.

416
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:58,167
I MEAN IT!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

417
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:00,701
- JUST...LISTEN TO ME.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

418
00:25:00,701 --> 00:25:02,167
- IT WON'T BE.

419
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,734
SHE'S DEAD!

420
00:25:04,734 --> 00:25:06,868
- I KNOW.

421
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:09,501
- AND IT DOESN'T EVEN
MATTER TO YOU.

422
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:11,801
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

423
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,634
- 'CAUSE IT DOESN'T.

424
00:25:13,634 --> 00:25:16,334
I CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

425
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:21,767
WHERE WERE YOU?

426
00:25:21,767 --> 00:25:24,901
WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN SOMEONE WAS KILLING HER?

427
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:28,534
YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE
TO PROTECT HER.

428
00:25:28,534 --> 00:25:30,367
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

429
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:34,133
- THAT WAS <i>YOUR</i> JOB!
- I KNOW.

430
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,100
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE,

431
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
AND I WISH I COULD
TAKE IT ALL BACK.

432
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,234
I WISH...THAT NONE OF THIS
HAD EVER HAPPENED

433
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,334
AND YOUR MOM
WAS STILL ALIVE.

434
00:25:42,334 --> 00:25:44,534
- WANNA KNOW WHAT I WISH?

435
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:48,901
THAT IT WAS JUST MY MOM
AND ME AND CODY AND HARRISON.

436
00:25:48,901 --> 00:25:50,801
'CAUSE WE ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO MUCH BETTER OFF

437
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,934
IF SHE HADN'T MET YOU!

438
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:56,968
I WISH <i>YOU</i> WERE DEAD!

439
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
- DO YOU MIND?
- WHAT?

440
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,601
- LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE.

441
00:26:37,567 --> 00:26:38,968
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

442
00:26:38,968 --> 00:26:42,501
- JESUS, QUINN, YOU CAN'T
GRAB A SHEET OR SOMETHING?

443
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,200
- OH. SORRY.

444
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,534
SO...WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

445
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:48,000
- TRYING TO FIND A DRESS
FOR RITA.

446
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,434
- YOU GONNA BURY HER
IN ONE OF THOSE?

447
00:26:49,434 --> 00:26:51,934
- YOU GOT SOMETHING BETTER?

448
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:58,701
GREAT. I-I GOTTA GO.

449
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:01,067
I GOTTA GO HOME NOW.

450
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:03,968
- YOU MIGHT WANNA
PUT SOME PANTS ON THERE.

451
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:07,901
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT,
OR YOU JUST GONNA ACT WEIRD?

452
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:09,534
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

453
00:27:09,534 --> 00:27:10,901
- OKAY.

454
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:13,267
- I MEAN...
YOU SHOW UP HERE,

455
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:15,701
WHICH I DIDN'T EVEN
ASK YOU TO DO, SO...

456
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,634
- YEAH. TO HELP.

457
00:27:17,634 --> 00:27:19,267
- IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT?

458
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:21,734
- MORGAN.

459
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:23,334
[engine turns]

460
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
ELLIOT?

461
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,901
THAT'S YOUR NAME, RIGHT?

462
00:27:40,901 --> 00:27:42,300
- YEAH.

463
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
- HI. QUINN.
METRO HOMICIDE.

464
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,601
- HEY.

465
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:47,400
- YOU HAVE KIDS, I TAKE IT.

466
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,601
- YEAH. THEY'RE WITH
THEIR MOTHER.

467
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:52,567
UM...WE'RE DIVORCED.

468
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,634
PLUS, IT JUST SEEMED
BETTER FOR THEM TO GET AWAY

469
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:56,167
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED
NEXT DOOR.

470
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,901
UM...YOU KNOW, I ALREADY
TALKED TO THE FBI.

471
00:28:01,901 --> 00:28:03,934
I TOLD THEM
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

472
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,801
WHAT DID YOU NEED?

473
00:28:05,801 --> 00:28:08,834
- HOW WELL DID YOU KNOW RITA?

474
00:28:08,834 --> 00:28:11,968
- I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW.
WE WERE NEIGHBORS.

475
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:15,234
- YEAH. I JUST...
COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

476
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:18,567
HOW TORN UP YOU WERE
ABOUT HER THE OTHER NIGHT.

477
00:28:20,634 --> 00:28:24,033
- SHE WAS A FRIEND, YOU KNOW?
IT WAS UPSETTING.

478
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:27,200
- A FRIEND.

479
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,634
I, UH, WAS TOLD
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN MORE.

480
00:28:30,634 --> 00:28:32,000
- [sighs]
CHRIST.

481
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE HEARD,

482
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,801
BUT JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE ACTUAL FACTS,

483
00:28:35,801 --> 00:28:38,133
ALL RITA AND I EVER DID
WAS KISS...ONCE.

484
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,734
THAT WAS IT.
IT WAS NOTHING.

485
00:28:39,734 --> 00:28:42,667
I MEAN,
HER HUSBAND WAS NEVER AROUND.

486
00:28:42,667 --> 00:28:44,300
ANYWAY,

487
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,300
DEXTER FOUND OUT ABOUT
THE INDISCRETION AND, UH,

488
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,834
CAME OVER AND PUNCHED ME OUT.

489
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,767
- HMM.

490
00:28:57,534 --> 00:28:59,033
[door opens]

491
00:28:59,033 --> 00:29:00,601
- DEXTER.

492
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:03,100
- [whispers]
SHH! HE'S SLEEPING.

493
00:29:07,901 --> 00:29:09,968
- BROUGHT SOME DRESSES
FOR YOU TO LOOK AT.

494
00:29:15,968 --> 00:29:18,000
WHERE ARE ASTOR AND CODY?

495
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,968
- AT A HOTEL
WITH THEIR GRANDPARENTS.

496
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,100
- HOW'D IT GO
TALKING WITH THEM?

497
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,868
- ASTOR'S UPSET.

498
00:29:27,868 --> 00:29:30,133
THEY GOT ME A HAT.

499
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:33,067
- SHE'LL BE OKAY.

500
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,601
- I DON'T SEE HOW.

501
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:36,901
HER MOTHER'S DEAD
BECAUSE OF ME.

502
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,400
- NO, SHE'S NOT.

503
00:29:40,133 --> 00:29:42,601
SHE'S DEAD BECAUSE OF TRINITY.

504
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:45,734
I KNOW YOU KEEP BLAMING
YOURSELF, BUT YOU CAN'T.

505
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:48,100
THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD
HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

506
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,133
- I COULD HAVE KILLED
ARTHUR MITCHELL

507
00:29:50,133 --> 00:29:51,934
THE FIRST CHANCE I GOT.

508
00:29:51,934 --> 00:29:53,934
- YOU LOVED RITA.

509
00:29:53,934 --> 00:29:58,834
YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE LET
ANYTHING HURT HER.

510
00:29:58,834 --> 00:30:00,701
SHE WAS LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

511
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:04,501
SHE TOLD ME THAT
ALL THE TIME...

512
00:30:04,501 --> 00:30:07,601
HOW LUCKY SHE FELT
TO HAVE FOUND YOU.

513
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:27,033
- I WAS WONDERING
WHAT YOU WERE DOING

514
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,834
SITTING HERE BY YOURSELF
FOR SO LONG.

515
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:31,234
NOW I SEE.

516
00:30:32,868 --> 00:30:35,234
- I PAID HER TO SAY THAT.

517
00:30:35,234 --> 00:30:37,701
- YOU DID?

518
00:30:37,701 --> 00:30:40,000
- NO, I WAS...JUST KIDDING.

519
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,567
- ME TOO.

520
00:30:44,734 --> 00:30:48,968
- SO WHAT DOES A...
BLOOD SPATTER ANALYST DO ANYWAY?

521
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,868
- EXCUSE ME.

522
00:31:08,901 --> 00:31:11,267
- IS THIS YOURS?
[alarm chirps]

523
00:31:11,267 --> 00:31:14,167
WHAT'S THE DEAL HERE?

[beep]

703
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:13,801
HEY, YOU.

704
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:15,934
- HEY...YOU.

705
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:17,701
IT'S RITA.

706
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:19,634
- YEAH, I KNOW.

707
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:21,534
- I WAS JUST CHECKING IN.

708
00:43:21,534 --> 00:43:23,734
WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WERE
FEELING BETTER.

709
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,868
- MUCH BETTER.

710
00:43:25,868 --> 00:43:28,067
- GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
[splash]

711
00:43:28,067 --> 00:43:29,767
THE WAY YOU LEFT
THE RESTAURANT SO QUICKLY,

712
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:31,334
I DON'T KNOW,
I FELT MAYBE I...

713
00:43:31,334 --> 00:43:33,334
SAID SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU.

714
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:34,767
- NO, YOU WERE FINE.

715
00:43:34,767 --> 00:43:35,801
[splash]

716
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:38,234
UH, VERY UNDERSTANDING.

717
00:43:40,734 --> 00:43:45,067
- I-I WASN'T COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH YOU. UM...

718
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:47,567
- YOU DIDN'T REALLY
GET STUCK IN TRAFFIC?

719
00:43:47,567 --> 00:43:50,100
- [laughs]

720
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,501
I HAVE TWO KIDS.
ASTOR AND CODY.

721
00:43:53,501 --> 00:43:55,667
THEY'RE 9 AND 7.

722
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:58,534
- I LIKE KIDS.

723
00:43:58,534 --> 00:44:01,167
- YOU DO?

724
00:44:01,167 --> 00:44:02,534
- YEAH, THEY'RE FUN.

725
00:44:02,534 --> 00:44:05,834
BESIDES,
DEB ALREADY TOLD ME.

726
00:44:05,834 --> 00:44:09,534
- AND MY EX-HUSBAND
AND OUR...PROBLEMS?

727
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:10,868
DID SHE TELL YOU?

728
00:44:10,868 --> 00:44:12,834
- YEAH.

729
00:44:12,834 --> 00:44:16,868
- SO YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT ME.

730
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:19,701
- I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE.

731
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:22,200
- [laughs]

732
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,801
SO...

733
00:44:23,801 --> 00:44:27,701
- SO MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET TOGETHER AGAIN SOMETIME.

734
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:32,467
- I WOULD LIKE THAT.
A LOT.

735
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:34,200
A LOT.
[laughs]

736
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,501
I KNOW I SHOULD
HANG UP RIGHT NOW,

737
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:39,467
BUT I JUST NEED TO SAY IT.

738
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:44,067
UM, I DON'T KNOW
WHY EXACTLY, BUT...

739
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:47,601
YOU MAKE ME FEEL GOOD.

740
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,267
LIKE THINGS
COULD BE DIFFERENT.

741
00:44:50,267 --> 00:44:53,167
- SO DO YOU.

742
00:44:53,167 --> 00:44:56,901
MAKE ME FEEL THAT WAY...
TOO, I MEAN.

743
00:44:56,901 --> 00:44:58,634
- GLAD I CALLED.

744
00:44:58,634 --> 00:45:00,367
I DON'T KNOW, I FELT...

745
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:03,234
UP IN THE AIR
THE WAY THINGS ENDED.

746
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:07,567
YOU KNOW, LIKE WE NEVER
SAID A PROPER GOOD-BYE, SO...

747
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:10,000
- GOOD-BYE, RITA BENNETT.

748
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,567
- GOOD-BYE, DEXTER MORGAN.

749
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:22,567
- GOOD-BYE.

750
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,634
I'M SORRY.

751
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:34,234
[engine sputters]

752
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,067
[wind chimes clanging]

753
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:03,801
[bell dinging]

754
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:07,000
[pounding on counter]

755
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,734
- WHERE'S THE KEY
TO THE FUCKING BATHROOM?

756
00:46:08,734 --> 00:46:12,100
OR SHOULD I JUST DUMP
OUT ON THE FLOOR?

757
00:46:16,968 --> 00:46:19,033
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

758
00:46:19,033 --> 00:46:21,334
- NOTHING.

759
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:22,801
- FUCKING RETARD.

760
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:24,434
GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!

761
00:46:24,434 --> 00:46:27,467
- HE'S RIGHT.
I SHOULD KEEP MOVING.

762
00:46:36,734 --> 00:46:38,400
- HEY, HEY, HEY.
HEY.

763
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:41,901
I SAID...

764
00:46:41,901 --> 00:46:43,834
WHAT THE FUCK
IS YOUR PROBLEM?

765
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,300
- I'VE HAD A BAD WEEK.

766
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,834
MY WIFE DIED,
AND IT WAS MY FAULT.

767
00:46:50,834 --> 00:46:53,667
- WELL, I'M REAL SORRY
FOR YOUR FUCKIN' LOSS,

768
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:56,734
BUT YOUR DEAD WIFE
CAN SUCK MY DICK.

769
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:06,534
- I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT HER.

770
00:47:19,734 --> 00:47:22,634
[wet crunching sound]

771
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,601
- THAT'S THE FIRST HUMAN THING
I'VE SEEN YOU DO

772
00:47:47,601 --> 00:47:51,100
SINCE SHE DIED, DEXTER.

773
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,968
- I THOUGHT YOU'D LEFT ME.

774
00:47:53,968 --> 00:47:56,367
- I'M HERE.

775
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:06,467
IT'S OKAY, SON...

776
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,467
TO SHOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

777
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:17,934
- [whimpering]

778
00:48:17,934 --> 00:48:21,467
[louder groaning]

779
00:48:21,467 --> 00:48:24,200
[shrieking]

780
00:48:25,467 --> 00:48:27,200
[screams]

781
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:36,334
- THEY'RE NOT BETTER OFF
WITHOUT YOU.

782
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:39,834
YOU'RE NOT BETTER OFF
WITHOUT THEM.

783
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,601
YOU NEED TO GO BACK.

784
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,834
- DEB SAYS
SHE'S SURE HE'LL BE HERE.

785
00:49:02,834 --> 00:49:04,834
BETTER BE.
IF WE DON'T GET GOING SOON,

786
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:08,634
WE'LL BE BURYING RITA
BY CANDLELIGHT.

787
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:15,367
SO YOU'RE NOT...
TALKING TO ME NOW?

788
00:49:15,367 --> 00:49:17,868
IS THAT IT?

789
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:20,367
- I HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.

790
00:49:24,234 --> 00:49:26,167
- YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU HAVE.

791
00:49:28,467 --> 00:49:31,167
I JUST NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND...

792
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,501
- SO TELL ME.

793
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:35,167
- I COULD HAVE FOUGHT
FOR THIS CASE, BUT...

794
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:37,501
PART OF ME DIDN'T WANT TO.

795
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,334
RITA...DIED.

796
00:49:44,968 --> 00:49:49,400
SHE DIED, AND IT SCARED ME.

797
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,834
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED, WHAT,
TEN HOURS?

798
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:55,634
DEXTER WAS THE WITNESS
AT OUR CEREMONY.

799
00:49:55,634 --> 00:49:56,901
FOR ALL I KNOW,

800
00:49:56,901 --> 00:49:59,467
HE WAS THERE WITH US
WHILE SHE WAS...

801
00:49:59,467 --> 00:50:02,000
BEING...
- I KNOW.

802
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:07,434
- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
REMINDED OF THAT.

803
00:50:07,434 --> 00:50:11,000
I DIDN'T WANT TO INVESTIGATE.

804
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,634
I JUST WANTED...

805
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,567
I JUST WANTED IT TO BE
OUR WEDDING DAY.

806
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:17,901
OH...

807
00:50:17,901 --> 00:50:20,133
I DON'T LIKE IT, ANGEL.

808
00:50:20,133 --> 00:50:21,934
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THIS MAKES ME FEEL.

809
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:23,400
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH ANY OF IT.

810
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,868
- MARIA.
- [sobs]

811
00:50:26,834 --> 00:50:29,434
WHAT?

812
00:50:29,434 --> 00:50:31,801
- NO ONE DOES.

813
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:44,100
- WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN HIS OWN WIFE'S FUNERAL?

814
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,501
PEOPLE ARE GETTING RESTLESS.

815
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:50,634
- THANK YOU FOR REPORTING IN
WITH THE OBVIOUS, QUINN.

816
00:50:50,634 --> 00:50:54,767
LIKE I'M SUCH A MORON
THAT IT'S LOST ON ME.

817
00:50:54,767 --> 00:50:57,033
YOU EVER GIVEN A EULOGY?

818
00:50:57,033 --> 00:50:58,434
- NO.

819
00:50:58,434 --> 00:51:00,033
- WELL, I CAN'T DO IT.

820
00:51:00,033 --> 00:51:02,334
AND THOSE AGENTS,
THOSE VULTURES

821
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:04,334
ARE JUST WAITING FOR HIM.

822
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:05,667
- LOOK...

823
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:08,400
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW.

824
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,667
- WHAT?

825
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,033
- IT'S NOT EXACTLY
AN EASY THING TO SAY.

826
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:16,601
THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR ELLIOT,
I SPOKE TO HIM THE OTHER DAY.

827
00:51:16,601 --> 00:51:20,200
- WHAT THE FUCK?
- I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE...

828
00:51:55,934 --> 00:51:59,000
- SHE HAD A BIG HEART.

829
00:52:01,467 --> 00:52:05,400
BIG ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US.

830
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,300
HAD TO BE.

831
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:14,133
I WASN'T EVEN HUMAN...

832
00:52:14,133 --> 00:52:16,501
WHEN WE FIRST MET.

833
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:20,968
I NEVER EXPECTED THAT
TO CHANGE.

834
00:52:20,968 --> 00:52:22,701
SHE REACHED OUT
AND FOUND SOMETHING

835
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:25,400
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WAS THERE.

836
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,834
SHE NEVER HURT ANYBODY.

837
00:52:28,834 --> 00:52:31,200
SHE WAS INNOCENT.

838
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:36,767
AND SHE DIED A BRUTAL DEATH
AND...

839
00:52:36,767 --> 00:52:42,300
AND I CAN'T...

840
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,200
FIX IT.

841
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,767
BUT I KNOW I HAVE TO TRY...

842
00:52:58,434 --> 00:53:01,434
HERE IN MIAMI WITH THE PEOPLE
WHO KNEW HER

843
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:03,567
AND WHO--WHO...

844
00:53:06,334 --> 00:53:08,868
WHO CARED ABOUT HER.

845
00:53:10,901 --> 00:53:14,267
AND WHO LOVED HER.

846
00:53:19,868 --> 00:53:22,334
LIKE I DID.
