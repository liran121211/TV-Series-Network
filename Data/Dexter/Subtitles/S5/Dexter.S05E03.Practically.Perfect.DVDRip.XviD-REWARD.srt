[Harrison crying]

3
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:15,334
MY WIFE DIED
AND IT WAS MY FAULT.

4
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:19,634
- YOUR DEAD WIFE
CAN SUCK MY DICK.

5
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:21,467
- THAT'S THE FIRST
HUMAN THING

6
00:00:21,467 --> 00:00:23,434
I'VE SEEN YOU DO
SINCE SHE DIED, DEXTER.

7
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:25,968
- [screams]

8
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:27,434
- I DON'T WANT
TO LIVE WITH YOU.

9
00:00:27,434 --> 00:00:29,434
I WANT TO LIVE
WITH GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

10
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:30,467
- FBI.

11
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,033
FUCKING BUNCH OF IDIOTS.

12
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,968
- WE KNOW YOU DIDN'T
KILL YOUR WIFE.

13
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:35,701
- WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR
A REASON WHY ARTHUR MITCHELL

14
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,834
MIGHT HAVE TARGETED HER.

15
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:37,934
- WE ALL GOOD HERE?

16
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,033
- THE ONLY LEAD WE HAVE NOW

17
00:00:39,033 --> 00:00:41,234
IS THIS KYLE BUTLER.

18
00:00:41,234 --> 00:00:42,734
- IT LOOKS LIKE SANTA MUERTE,
THE CULT.

19
00:00:42,734 --> 00:00:43,734
- WHO ARE YOU?

20
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:45,601
- OFFICER MANZON, CIRA.

21
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:47,834
- WE HAVE SEX ONE DAY
AND THEN--

22
00:00:47,834 --> 00:00:49,133
- I'M SORRY,
I'M NOT THE KIND OF PERSON

23
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:50,400
WHO WOULD EVER HAVE SEX
WITH YOU.

24
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,167
OKAY, WE HAD SEX.

25
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,167
- WAS IT GOOD SEX?

26
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:55,167
- I'VE SAID ALL I'M GONNA SAY.

27
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:56,934
- YOU'RE WELCOME
TO STAY HERE

28
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:59,267
FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT,
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

29
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,033
I HEARD THE FBI INTERVIEW
WENT WELL.

30
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,601
- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
NAMED KYLE BUTLER.

31
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:05,067
HE'S A FRIEND
OF ARTHUR MITCHELL'S.

32
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,434
THEY'VE HAVING SKETCHES DONE.

33
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,868
- THE MITCHELL FAMILY ALL GAVE
VERY DIFFERENT VERSIONS.

34
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,033
- DO YOU MIND IF I KEEP
A COPY OF THESE?

35
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,667
- YOU MARRIED MARIA LAGUERTA?

36
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:14,334
SUCH A FINE PIECE OF ASS.

37
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:16,334
- YOU FUCK!

38
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:18,400
[overlapping grunting]

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
- BOYD FOWLER.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,234
YOU'RE PROBABLY USED TO SEEING
DEAD THINGS THOUGH, HUH?

41
00:01:22,234 --> 00:01:27,200
- CAN'T SAY I EVER GET
USED TO IT.

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,868
- YOU WANT THAT NICE HOUSE
ON THE BEACH.

43
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:30,300
both: TAKE IT!

44
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,033
- I CAN SEE HAVING AN
OLD GIRLFRIEND'S LOCK OF HAIR,

45
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:35,834
BUT IDENTIFIED
BY ONLY A NUMBER?

46
00:01:53,901 --> 00:01:56,901
[quirky music]

47
00:01:56,901 --> 00:02:04,868
* *

48
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,667
- I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET TO THE TRUTH.

49
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:43,200
HOWEVER LONG THAT TAKES
IS UP TO YOU.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,501
- I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

51
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:45,834
I'M NOT LYING.

52
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,033
- FIRST, YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T DO DRUGS

53
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:48,067
AND THEN YOU SAID YOU DID.

54
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,567
- I SAID I MIGHT HAVE
TRIED SOME

55
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:51,100
AT A TRIDELT PARTY ONCE.

56
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,334
- YOU MIGHT HAVE?

57
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:53,868
WHAT THE FUCK DOES
THAT EVEN MEAN?

58
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:55,033
YOU DID OR YOU DIDN'T.

59
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:56,234
YOU CAN'T KIND OF DO BLOW.

60
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:58,234
- BUT THAT WAS SIX YEARS AGO
IN COLLEGE.

61
00:03:58,234 --> 00:04:00,934
- AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE
YOU'RE NOT ON ANYTHING NOW?

62
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:02,000
- I'M TOTALLY CLEAN.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,767
- THEN WHY ARE YOU SO NERVOUS?

64
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,200
- BECAUSE I WASN'T EXPECTING
ON GETTING

65
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,300
THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS.

66
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,901
I MEAN,
YOU SOUND LIKE A COP.

67
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,434
- I AM A COP.

68
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:12,067
I WORK FOR MIAMI
METRO HOMICIDE.

69
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:14,834
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

70
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:17,033
I CAME FOR A NANNY JOB.

71
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:20,300
I'M NOT, LIKE, PLANNING
TO KILL THE PRESIDENT.

72
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,300
- HARRISON NEEDS A NANNY AND DEB
INSISTED ON RUNNING POINT.

73
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,133
THE WAY IT'S GOING, ONLY MARY
POPPINS WOULD MAKE THE CUT.

74
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,601
- I DON'T CARE WHAT DOCTORS SAY.

75
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,167
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
FOR CHILDREN

76
00:04:31,167 --> 00:04:34,367
TO EAT A LOT OF CHEESE.

77
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,767
- WELL, IF A CHILD'S CHOKING,

78
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:40,434
I JUST DO WHAT MY MAMA
ALWAYS DID.

79
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:42,467
YOU GET AHOLD OF IT
BY THE LEGS

80
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:47,901
AND YOU GIVE IT
A LITTLE KNUCKLE-SLAP.

81
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:50,434
- NO, I'VE NEVER HAD
MARTIAL ARTS TRAINING,

82
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:52,467
BUT I CAN SCREAM REAL LOUD.

83
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,968
- I HAVE A NURSING DEGREE
WITH AN EMPHASIS

84
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,334
ON INFANT/TODDLER GROWTH
AND DEVELOPMENT.

85
00:05:04,334 --> 00:05:06,501
- WHY NOT WORK AT A HOSPITAL?

86
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:08,734
- WELL, I DID, BUT, UM,
THERE WERE BUDGET CUTS,

87
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:11,000
AND MY WARD WAS DOWNSIZED.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,467
I LIVE ALONE.

89
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:13,734
I DON'T NEED A BIG SALARY,

90
00:05:13,734 --> 00:05:16,801
SO A NANNY POSITION WOULD WORK
VERY WELL FOR ME.

91
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:23,601
HE'S TIRED.

92
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:26,801
MAY I?

93
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:29,634
I DON'T BITE.

94
00:05:29,634 --> 00:05:30,734
- OKAY.

95
00:05:30,734 --> 00:05:32,033
- HI.

96
00:05:32,033 --> 00:05:34,300
OOH.

97
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,968
WHAT A LITTLE PRINCE YOU ARE.

98
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:41,634
MMM.

99
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:44,100
* BYE BABY BUNTING *

100
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,934
* DADDY'S GONE A HUNTING *

101
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:52,133
* GONE TO FIND A RABBIT SKIN *

102
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:55,634
* TO WRAP THE BABY BUNTING IN *

103
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:57,033
- AND THEN THERE WAS SONYA.

104
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,968
PRACTICALLY PERFECT
IN EVERY WAY.

105
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:01,300
- WELL, YOU HAVE MY NUMBER.

106
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,534
I'LL LOOK FORWARD
TO YOUR CALL.

107
00:06:02,534 --> 00:06:04,868
AGAIN, MY CONDOLENCES
FOR YOUR LOSS.

108
00:06:04,868 --> 00:06:06,734
- THANKS.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

109
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,334
- BYE, PRINCE HARRY.

110
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:13,167
- SHE'S THE ONE.

111
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,868
- ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO KEEP LOOKING, DEX?

112
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:18,734
- [sighs]
I JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE HER.

113
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:22,000
PRINCE HARRY LIKES HER.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,234
DITTO ME.

115
00:06:23,234 --> 00:06:27,767
- THEN CALL HER.

116
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:29,100
DON'T FORGET,
YOU AND HARRISON--

117
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,367
- CRISIS COUNSELOR.
I WON'T FORGET.

118
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,701
- LOVE YOU, BRO.

119
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:39,501
- ME TOO.

120
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:51,300
EMPTINESS WASN'T
ALWAYS A PROBLEM.

121
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,100
I USED TO CHERISH IT.

122
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:59,701
BUT NOW IT FEELS LIKE
SOMETHING TO OVERCOME.

123
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:01,868
EMPTINESS IS ALL SHE HAS LEFT.

124
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:07,467
BOYD FOWLER.

125
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,868
DEPARTMENT OF SANITATION.

126
00:07:08,868 --> 00:07:12,534
DIVISION OF DEAD ANIMAL PICKUP.

127
00:07:12,534 --> 00:07:17,400
HOBBIES: SELF-IMPROVEMENT AND
STORING WOMEN IN FORMALDEHYDE.

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,801
I DON'T KNOW IF KILLING YOU
WILL FILL THE VOID,

129
00:07:19,801 --> 00:07:21,868
BUT IT'S A PLACE TO START.

130
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,534
- WHAT'S THIS?

131
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:30,367
- ATM SURVEILLANCE VIDEO.

132
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,234
THE BANK SENT IT OVER.
THIS IS OUR SHOTGUN GUY.

133
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:34,767
- FRANCISCO ALFARO?
- YEAH.

134
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:36,801
IT'S WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE
WHEN HE HAD A FACE.

135
00:07:36,801 --> 00:07:38,400
- WHEN WAS THIS TAKEN?

136
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,501
- TWO HOURS BEFORE
HE KILLED HIS WIFE

137
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,133
AND BLEW HIS OWN HEAD OFF.

138
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:44,100
TRYING TO GET CASH,

139
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,234
BUT HE KEEPS PUTTING IN
THE WRONG PIN NUMBER.

140
00:07:46,234 --> 00:07:47,501
0371.

141
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,667
HIS WIFE'S BIRTHDAY.

142
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:49,834
- OUCH.

143
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,434
GOOD THING SHE'S DEAD.

144
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:56,000
HE NEVER WOULD HAVE
LIVED THAT DOWN.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,968
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO YOU GUYS?

146
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:00,501
- BATTLE SCARS.

147
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:02,934
WE HAD TO GET GHETTO
ON SOME DIRT-BAG

148
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:04,734
AT THE CLUB LAST NIGHT.

149
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,000
- YOU GUYS GOT
IN A BAR FIGHT?

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,601
- IT'S NOT WORTH
TALKING ABOUT.

151
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,767
- TRUE WARRIORS
ARE HUMBLE MEN.

152
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:10,767
- OH, PLEASE.

153
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,567
YOU GOT A REASON
TO BE HUMBLE.

154
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:13,968
YOU GOT FUCKED UP RUNNING
THE OTHER WAY.

155
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:17,067
- YOU'RE CONFUSING COWARDICE
WITH A TACTICAL RETREAT.

156
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,534
 <i>HERMANO,</i> BACK ME UP HERE.

157
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:20,167
- YOU BACKED UP JUST FINE
ON YOUR OWN.

158
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,467
[laughter]

159
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,701
- OKAY, LET'S FOCUS
ON THE CASE, PEOPLE.

160
00:08:23,701 --> 00:08:25,534
REMEMBER WHY WE'RE GETTING PAID.
- OKAY.

161
00:08:25,534 --> 00:08:26,868
I'LL GO FIRST.

162
00:08:26,868 --> 00:08:28,667
GUY OFFS HIS WIFE,
WANTS TO SKIP THE COUNTRY.

163
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,300
NEEDS CASH,
BUT HE'S SO WIGGED OUT,

164
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,067
HE CAN'T REMEMBER THE PIN.

165
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,868
GIVES UP, GOES HOME,
KILLS HIMSELF.

166
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:35,801
- ONLY PROBLEM WITH THAT
THEORY IS ALFARO

167
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:37,501
DOESN'T HAVE A MOTIVE
TO KILL HIS WIFE.

168
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,033
- MAYBE HE'S JUST SICK OF HER.

169
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,868
- OH, YEAH,
HE GOT SICK OF HER?

170
00:08:40,868 --> 00:08:42,167
GOT SICK OF HER,
SO HE CUT OFF HER HEAD

171
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,767
AND PUT IT IN A PARK AND PUT
CANDLES ALL AROUND IT?

172
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:46,200
- YEAH.
HAVE YOU WATCHED THE VIDEO?

173
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,501
'CAUSE HE'S A LITTLE
FUCKING CRAZY.

174
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:49,200
- CRAZY DOES NOT EXPLAIN
WHY HE DOESN'T

175
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,467
HAVE A DROP OF BLOOD
ON HIS CLOTHES.

176
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:51,701
WHY DON'T YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND?

177
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,100
HOW DO YOU
CUT SOMEBODY'S HEAD OFF

178
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,367
AND NOT GET A DROP
OF BLOOD ON YOU?

179
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,501
WHAT'D HE DO?
WHAT, WEAR A BIB?

180
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:57,534
- AS MUCH FUN AS THIS IS,

181
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:58,934
WE'RE NOT GONNA HASH THIS
OUT IN THE ROOM.

182
00:08:58,934 --> 00:09:00,868
- I WOULD LIKE TO RE-CANVASS
THE NEIGHBORHOOD

183
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:02,734
WHERE MRS. ALFARO'S BODY
WAS FOUND.

184
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,400
THERE ARE A LOT OF HOUSES
FACING THAT PARK.

185
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,667
SOMEBODY'S BOUND TO TALK.

186
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:06,868
- START TODAY.

187
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,734
- AND I THINK BATISTA
SHOULD BE THERE.

188
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:11,434
- HISPANIC NEIGHBORHOOD.
HISPANIC COP.

189
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:12,834
MIGHT RAISE THE COMFORT LEVEL.
LOOSEN TONGUES.

190
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,634
- I GET IT.

191
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:15,901
OKAY.

192
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:17,234
THE REST OF YOU,
STAY WITH THE CASE.

193
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:20,067
WORK YOUR LEADS.

194
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,367
THANKS.
- BEAUTIFUL.

195
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,467
- ANGEL?
- MM-HMM?

196
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:26,901
- JUST HOW BIG
WAS THIS FIGHT?

197
00:09:26,901 --> 00:09:28,767
- LIKE I TOLD YOU THIS MORNING,
IT WAS A DISAGREEMENT

198
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:29,968
THAT GOT OUT OF HAND.

199
00:09:29,968 --> 00:09:32,267
TOO MUCH BOOZE.
TOO MUCH TESTOSTERONE.

200
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,634
- [speaking Spanish]

201
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:36,300
UH...

202
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,934
YOU PUNCHED ANOTHER COP.

203
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:39,834
I MEAN, <i>QUE PASO?</i>

204
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:41,133
WHAT STARTED IT?

205
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,167
- WE HASHED IT OUT.

206
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,734
 <i>HOMBRE A HOMBRE.</i>

207
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,667
IT'S SETTLED.

208
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,200
- PRETTY SURE HIS APPETITE'S
ABOUT THE SAME.

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,234
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN
KIND OF A MESSY EATER.

210
00:09:57,234 --> 00:09:58,934
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

211
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:00,767
- HIS SLEEPING PATTERN?

212
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,501
- SAME.

213
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:06,167
UNFORTUNATELY, HE CRIES
ABOUT THREE TIMES A NIGHT

214
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,801
ON A GOOD NIGHT.

215
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:13,133
SO YOU'RE NOT SURPRISED THAT
HE'S ACTING PRETTY MUCH NORMAL?

216
00:10:13,133 --> 00:10:15,000
- NO.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,200
YOU AND HARRISON SUFFERED
A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY.

218
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,968
IT'S NO GETTING AROUND THAT,

219
00:10:19,968 --> 00:10:22,567
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

220
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,300
- THANKFUL?

221
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,100
- YES.

222
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,467
HARRISON'S COGNITIVE ABILITIES
ARE REALLY JUST DEVELOPING.

223
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:34,200
- SO YOU'RE SAYING HE MIGHT
NOT BE AFFECTED

224
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,601
BY WHAT HE SAW?

225
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:38,734
- THERE'S JUST SIMPLY NO CHANCE
THAT HE WAS ABLE

226
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:40,400
TO COMPREHEND
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

227
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,334
- [sighs]

228
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:48,300
I SAW SOMETHING PRETTY TRAUMATIC
WHEN I WAS THREE.

229
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,267
- HARRISON'S ONLY TEN MONTHS.

230
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:57,067
- IT AFFECTED ME A LOT.

231
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:58,534
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA.

232
00:10:58,534 --> 00:11:02,334
- I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CHILDREN.

233
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:03,968
WE'LL KEEP AN EYE
ON HARRISON,

234
00:11:03,968 --> 00:11:07,667
BUT I REALLY THINK YOUR SON
IS GONNA BE PERFECTLY FINE.

235
00:11:09,634 --> 00:11:13,968
[Harrison crying]

236
00:11:13,968 --> 00:11:16,400
- OOH.

237
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,334
HE WANTS HIS HEAD BACK.

238
00:11:20,334 --> 00:11:22,100
AHH.

239
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,701
- CHILDREN HARRISON'S AGE
CAN EXHIBIT

240
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,567
WHAT MIGHT SEEM
LIKE VIOLENT BEHAVIOR,

241
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:28,400
BUT THEY'RE JUST
RELEASING ENERGY.

242
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,000
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT
TO READ INTO IT.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,634
- I'LL TRY NOT TO.

244
00:11:34,634 --> 00:11:37,267
- THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW

245
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:38,868
IS TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

246
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:41,968
FIND SOME TIME TO RELEASE
YOUR OWN ENERGY.

247
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:46,701
DO SOMETHING FOR DEXTER.

248
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:49,534
- DEXTER WILL.

249
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:52,200
- I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

250
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,567
I DIDN'T SEE NO ONE.

251
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,534
- WELL, IF YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING

252
00:11:55,534 --> 00:11:57,868
OR IF YOU HEAR ANYTHING--

253
00:11:57,868 --> 00:11:59,033
- YES, MM-HMM.

254
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,534
I CALL YOU.
[speaking Spanish]

255
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:03,501
- [sighs]

256
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:05,534
- WE'RE NEVER GONNA HEAR
FROM HER.

257
00:12:05,534 --> 00:12:07,868
ALL THIS NO TALKING
IS FUCKING FRUSTRATING.

258
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:09,834
- YEAH.

259
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,267
YOU KNOW WHAT'S FRUSTRATING?

260
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,334
9 DAYS, 13 HOURS.

261
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:14,601
- WHAT?

262
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,567
- SINCE WE--YOU KNOW?

263
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:18,067
JUST--
- YOU'RE COUNTING?

264
00:12:18,067 --> 00:12:20,200
- I CAN'T HELP IT.
I HAVE AN INTERNAL CLOCK.

265
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,267
- WELL, UNPLUG IT.

266
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:23,834
- I'M JUST SAYING,
AT THIS POINT,

267
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:25,267
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE MARRIED.

268
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,434
- SHIT ON MY FACE.

269
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:28,200
YOU EVER WORDS LIKE
"WE" AND "MARRIED"

270
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,934
IN THE SAME FUCKING
SENTENCE AGAIN--

271
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,300
- WHOA.

272
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,968
- ANOTHER CASE
OF TEMPORARY BLINDNESS.

273
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:34,100
ANYTHING?

274
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,567
- THESE PEOPLE ARE
ALL AFRAID OF SOMETHING.

275
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:37,367
- YEAH, I'M GETTING THAT TOO.

276
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:38,868
- MAYBE THEY JUST DON'T WANT
TO GET INVOLVED.

277
00:12:38,868 --> 00:12:40,267
- NO, I THINK IT'S MORE
THAN THAT.

278
00:12:40,267 --> 00:12:42,167
IF THE KILLER'S DEAD,
WHAT ARE THEY AFRAID OF?

279
00:12:42,167 --> 00:12:43,634
- I THOUGHT I COULD MAKE
SOME HEADWAY,

280
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:46,200
BUT THE REALITY IS THIS
IS A VENEZUELAN NEIGHBORHOOD.

281
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,934
- SO?
- I'M CUBAN.

282
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:51,200
OFFICER MANZON'S
FROM THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

283
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,334
- MANZON?

284
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:53,367
- SHE'S A UNIFORM,
BUT SHE MIGHT

285
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:54,667
BE WORTH BRINGING IN.

286
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,434
- SHE THINKS THESE ARE
ABOUT RELIGIOUS MURDERS.

287
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:57,434
"SANTA MIERDA."

288
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,100
[laughter]

289
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,767
- THAT'S <i>SANTA MUERTE.</i>

290
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,267
IT'S "SAINT DEATH,"

291
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:04,601
NOT "SAINT SHIT."

292
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:06,834
AND MANZON MIGHT
BE ON TO SOMETHING.

293
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:08,734
MIGHT EXPLAIN
WHY NO ONE'S TALKING.

294
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,133
- SHUT UP.

295
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:12,033
- [chuckles]

296
00:13:28,234 --> 00:13:30,834
[cell phone beeping]

297
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:32,267
[cell phone trilling]

298
00:13:32,267 --> 00:13:34,434
- HELLO?
- HI, IT'S DEXTER.

299
00:13:34,434 --> 00:13:35,701
- HI.

300
00:13:35,701 --> 00:13:37,100
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW
IF I MENTIONED,

301
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,701
BUT FOR HIS NAP,
HARRISON LIKES

302
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:41,634
THE PUPPY BLANKET
JUST TOUCHING HIS FACE.

303
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,601
- IT'S ON YOUR CHECKLIST.

304
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:47,434
UH, ITEM EIGHT UNDER
"SLEEP PREFERENCES."

305
00:13:47,434 --> 00:13:50,634
- OKAY, GOOD.
HOW'S HE DOING?

306
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:53,000
- WE JUST READ
 <i>THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR</i>

307
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
FOR THE SEVENTH TIME.

308
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,567
- DON'T WORRY.

309
00:13:56,567 --> 00:14:01,033
HE USUALLY GETS SICK
OF IT AROUND THE 20TH READ.

310
00:14:01,033 --> 00:14:04,300
I GOTTA GO.

311
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,167
[chuckles]

312
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,467
YEAH, YOU CALL ME
IF THERE'S ANYTHING.

313
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:12,767
THOUGHT HE'D NEVER SPOT ME.

314
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,834
- [chuckles]

315
00:14:14,834 --> 00:14:18,434
SOME COINKYDINK, HUH?

316
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:20,200
YOU FIND ANY MORE
DEAD ANIMALS?

317
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,968
- LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
WORKING ON SOMETHING.

318
00:14:22,968 --> 00:14:24,968
- TASTES A LOT BETTER
THAN IT LOOKS.

319
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:27,267
- HAVE A SEAT.

320
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:34,100
- BOYD FOWLER.

321
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,100
- DARYL TUCKER.

322
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,501
- YOU WORK AROUND HERE?

323
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:45,968
- I JUST LOVE THE ARABICA.

324
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,367
ACTUALLY, I'M BETWEEN JOBS.

325
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:50,934
HENCE THE WANT ADS.

326
00:14:50,934 --> 00:14:52,901
- WHAT KIND OF WORK
YOU LOOKING FOR?

327
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,801
- OH, NOT CHOOSY.

328
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:58,868
WHATEVER PAYS AND
GETS ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

329
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:00,634
YOU LIKE WHAT YOU DO?

330
00:15:00,634 --> 00:15:03,334
- I LOVE IT.

331
00:15:03,334 --> 00:15:04,968
PROBABLY WOULDN'T THINK SO,
DRIVING AROUND,

332
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:06,167
PICKING UP DEAD ANIMALS.

333
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:09,400
- EH, BEATS WORKING
IN A CUBICLE.

334
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,834
YOU GET OUT IN THE FRESH AIR.

335
00:15:11,834 --> 00:15:13,734
WELL, I GUESS MOST
OF THE TIME IT'S FRESH.

336
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:17,567
- [chuckles]
IT'S NOT BORING.

337
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,667
NEVER KNOW WHAT'S
AROUND THE NEXT BEND.

338
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:25,234
FULL OF SURPRISES.

339
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:27,100
YOU KNOW...

340
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,634
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,
WE MIGHT HAVE

341
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:29,634
AN OPENING AT ANIMAL PICKUP.

342
00:15:29,634 --> 00:15:30,868
- REALLY?

343
00:15:30,868 --> 00:15:32,601
- YEAH, THERE AIN'T EXACTLY
A LINE EITHER.

344
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,434
[laughter]

345
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,501
YOU SHOULD TAKE A RIDE
WITH ME.

346
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:38,234
SEE IF YOU LIKE IT.

347
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:41,334
YOU GOT TO BE OKAY AROUND
DEAD THINGS THOUGH.

348
00:15:41,334 --> 00:15:44,734
- I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

349
00:15:44,734 --> 00:15:46,501
- GREAT.

350
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,067
TOMORROW MORNING,
8:00 SHARP.

351
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:51,701
- I WOULD HAVE SETTLED
FOR YOUR WORK SCHEDULE,

352
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,767
BUT THIS COULD BE BETTER.

353
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:58,100
ONLY 24 HOURS TO GET READY.

354
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,601
BOYD'S PATROL ROUTE.

355
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:02,200
NEED TO FIND A PLACE
WHERE WE CAN SPEND

356
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,667
SOME QUALITY TIME.

357
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:09,601
THERE.

358
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:21,868
AN OLD TOURIST WELCOME CENTER.

359
00:16:21,868 --> 00:16:23,667
NOT VERY WELCOMING NOW.

360
00:16:38,901 --> 00:16:41,033
TOTALLY ISOLATED.

361
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,834
THANK YOU, CITY OF MIAMI.

362
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,934
- YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM
IN DAYLIGHT?

363
00:16:45,934 --> 00:16:47,667
- DOESN'T MATTER OUT THIS FAR.

364
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,100
- IT'S STILL VERY RISKY.

365
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,334
WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES BY?

366
00:16:51,334 --> 00:16:54,601
- THAT COULD ALSO HAPPEN
AT NIGHT.

367
00:16:54,601 --> 00:16:58,901
- BUT IT'S A LOT LESS LIKELY.

368
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:01,133
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT,
DEXTER.

369
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,767
IT'S IMPORTANT.

370
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,701
IT'S YOUR FIRST KILL SINCE--

371
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,634
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME
HOW MUCH I NEED THIS.

372
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,567
- THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

373
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:09,968
- WHAT?

374
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,100
- THIS KILL WON'T PUT
EVERYTHING RIGHT.

375
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,334
IT WON'T BRING RITA BACK.

376
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,400
- IT MIGHT BRING ME BACK.

377
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,667
- IF YOU MAKE IT MEAN SO MUCH,

378
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:19,267
YOU'LL ONLY INVITE MISTAKES.

379
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:20,901
- I WON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKES.

380
00:17:20,901 --> 00:17:22,100
I'M FOLLOWING THE CODE.

381
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,667
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME OR NOT?

382
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:28,167
- I ONLY WANT
TO HELP YOU, DEX.

383
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,234
THIS IS A BIG ROOM.

384
00:17:30,234 --> 00:17:33,767
I HOPE YOU BROUGHT
ENOUGH PLASTIC.

385
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:42,200
- IT FEELS GOOD GETTING
THE DETAILS RIGHT.

386
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,434
IT'S MORE THAN JUST PREPARING
A KILL ROOM.

387
00:18:04,234 --> 00:18:08,167
IT'S LIKE I'M PUTTING
MY LIFE BACK IN ORDER.

388
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:14,634
AND IT'S ALMOST ENOUGH.

389
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,033
ALMOST.

390
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,634
- IF ANYONE KNOWS
ABOUT THESE MURDERS, IT'S FAUZI.

391
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:30,467
HE KNOWS EVERYBODY
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

392
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,567
- YOU REALLY GREW UP
AROUND HERE?

393
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,467
- YOU MAKE IT SOUND
LIKE A DISABILITY.

394
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:35,801
- I'M ASKING A QUESTION.

395
00:18:35,801 --> 00:18:38,667
I'M NOT ABOUT
TO BURN A CROSS.

396
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:40,767
- I USED TO RIDE MY BIKE
AROUND THIS BLOCK.

397
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,434
THERE WAS THIS MEAN DOG
THAT LIVED THERE.

398
00:18:42,434 --> 00:18:43,734
I MEAN, I USED TO PRAY
TO SAINT ANTHONY

399
00:18:43,734 --> 00:18:44,801
TO MAKE ME INVISIBLE.

400
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:46,067
I NEVER GOT BIT.

401
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:47,667
- YOU THINK PRAYER
WAS THE REASON?

402
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,200
- YEAH.

403
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,601
THAT AND SOME HOMEMADE
PEPPER SPRAY.

404

- <i>PODEMOS HABLAR CON FAUZI?</i>

405
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:08,067
- <i>POR QUE RAZON?</i>

406
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:10,801
 <i>- POLICIA. ES IMPORTANTE.</i>
 <i>POR FAVOR.</i>

407
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:13,100
- <i>UN MOMENTO.</i>

408
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,767
- I WAS SURPRISED YOU CALLED.

409
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:21,501
THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT I SAID AT THE CRIME SCENE.

410
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:24,367
- WHO SAYS I DO?

411
00:19:24,367 --> 00:19:26,567
AT THIS POINT,
I CAN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT.

412
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:28,968
- WELL, BRINGING ME IN WAS
THE BEST MOVE, DETECTIVE.

413
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,033
YOU WON'T BE SORRY.

414
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,968
- <i>ME LLAMO MANZON.</i>
 <i>ESTE ES DETECTIVE MORGAN.</i>

415
00:19:53,968 --> 00:19:55,267
- ASK HIM IF HE'S HEARD
OF THE DEATHS

416
00:19:55,267 --> 00:19:57,968
OF MR. AND MRS. ALFARO.

417

- <i>HAS OIDO</i>
 <i>DE LOS ASESINATOS?</i>

418
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:05,033
- <i>SI. UNA COSA TERRIBLE.</i>

419
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:09,534
- THIS WAS FOUND
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

420
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:10,834
DID HE SELL IT TO MR. ALFARO?

421
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,467
- <i>ESTO FUE ENCONTRADO</i>
 <i>EN LA ESCENA.</i>

422
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:14,667
 <i>SABIA USTED LO VENDE</i>
 <i>AL SR. ALFARO?</i>

423

[continues in Spanish]

425
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,267
- HE SAYS ALFARO
WAS A STRICT CATHOLIC.

426
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,601
CAME INTO THE STORE NOW
AND THEN TO BUY SOME THINGS,

427
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,434
BUT HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
CAUGHT DEAD BACK HERE.

428
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,200
- DID HE SELL IT
TO ANYONE ELSE?

429
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,400
- <i>SABIA SI USTED VENDIO</i>
 <i>ESTO A ALGUIEN MAS?</i>

OF WHO BUYS WHAT,

433
00:20:41,367 --> 00:20:43,234
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN BELIEVE
IN THIS SHIT.

434
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:45,834
- IS THAT WHY HE HAS
THE TATTOO?

435
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:48,534
- I GOT DRUNK ONE NIGHT,
WOKE UP,

436
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:50,133
IT WAS THERE.

437
00:20:50,133 --> 00:20:54,968

- FAUZI'S HOLDING BACK.

450
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:25,133
I SHOULD HAVE TALKED
TO HIM BY MYSELF.

451
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,434
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IN A MORE SHARING MOOD

452
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:28,067
WITH SOMEONE HE KNOWS.
- OH, YEAH?

453
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,434
MAYBE HE WOULD HAVE
SAID NOTHING

454
00:21:29,434 --> 00:21:33,334
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

455

458
00:21:42,501 --> 00:21:44,501
WHY DON'T WE GIVE HIM THE NIGHT
TO STEW OVER THIS

00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,934
AND THEN YOU COME
VISIT HIM TOMORROW ALONE?

AND YOU WERE MY SUGAR MAMA.

525
00:25:05,968 --> 00:25:07,167
- SUGAR MAMA?

526
00:25:07,167 --> 00:25:08,334
- YEAH,
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY BOSS

527
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:10,167
AND YOUR PAYCHECK
HAS MORE ZEROS.

528
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:11,634
- DOES THAT REALLY
BOTHER YOU?

529
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:13,334
- A LITTLE.

530
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:15,000
DO YOU KNOW ANY GUYS
IT WOULDN'T BOTHER?

531
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,801
- SO YOU HIT HIM?

532
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:17,901
- NO, THERE'S MORE.

533
00:25:17,901 --> 00:25:19,133
- MORE?

534
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:22,167
- YOU WANTED
TO KNOW EVERYTHING.

535
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:27,234
HE THEN SAID YOU GAVE
THE BEST BLOWJOBS IN MIAMI.

536
00:25:30,634 --> 00:25:33,267
AND THEN I HIT HIM.

537
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:38,133
AND HE'S LUCKY
THAT'S ALL I DID.

538
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:40,033
- [sighs]

539
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:47,334
ANGEL, I'M A WOMAN
IN A POSITION OF POWER.

540
00:25:47,334 --> 00:25:49,934
SOME MEN HAVE TROUBLE
DEALING WITH THAT,

541
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:51,300
SO THEY SPREAD
GARBAGE AROUND.

542
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:55,868
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

543
00:25:55,868 --> 00:26:00,200
AND I'M TRYING
TO WORK THROUGH IT.

544
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,234
- COULD YOU WORK THROUGH IT
WITHOUT THE BAR FIGHTS?

545
00:26:03,234 --> 00:26:06,000
- I'LL KEEP THE BAR FIGHTS
AT A MINIMUM.

546
00:26:12,701 --> 00:26:14,501
- HE SLEEPING?

547
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,667
- [sighs]
LIKE A BABY.

548
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,868
HOW WAS WORK?

549
00:26:22,868 --> 00:26:24,801
- DIRE.

550
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:27,934
I'VE BEEN SADDLED WITH
THIS UNIFORM ON A HOMICIDE CASE

551
00:26:27,934 --> 00:26:31,567
AND SHE'S DRIVING ME
APE-ASS CRAZY.

552
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:33,367
HOW'S THE NANNY?

553
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:36,734
- ASIDE FROM A LITTLE
MESSAGE HICCUP--

554
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:40,534
IT WAS TOTALLY MY FAULT--
SHE DID GREAT.

555
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:43,767
- I WONDER WHY
SHE LEFT IRELAND.

556
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,767
MAYBE SHE'S RUNNING
FROM SOMETHING.

557
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:46,868
- I DON'T KNOW, DEB.

558
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:50,968
MAYBE YOU BETTER CHECK
INTERPOL.

559
00:26:50,968 --> 00:26:53,033
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT'D YOU DO TODAY?

560
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:54,300
- NOT MUCH.

561
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,334
CODY CALLED.

562
00:26:56,334 --> 00:26:59,901
HE WANTED ME TO SEND
MY RECIPE FOR PANCAKES.

563
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:01,667
- HOW ARE THEY?

564
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:05,701
- CODY SOUNDS...

565
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:08,501
HAPPIER.

566
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,434
ASTOR WOULDN'T COME
TO THE PHONE.

567
00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:15,968
- SHE'LL COME AROUND, DEX.

568
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,300
- WELL, OTHER THAN THAT,
I RAN SOME ERRANDS.

569
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,167
- THAT'S GOOD.

570
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:23,267
GET BACK IN YOUR ROUTINE.

571
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:26,100
WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE CLOSE,
ROUTINE CAN BE A LADDER

572
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,667
THAT CAN HELP YOU CLIMB BACK
INTO SOME KIND OF NORMALCY.

573
00:27:33,167 --> 00:27:34,667
- WHERE'D YOU HEAR THAT?

574
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:39,601
- I AM CAPABLE OF INDEPENDENT
THOUGHT, DEXTER.

575
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:41,167
OPRAH.

576
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:42,267
[laughter]

577
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:44,467
I WATCHED HER
WHEN I WAS LAID UP.

578
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,334
THAT'S GOOD.

579
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:50,501
KEEP GETTING BETTER, DEX.

580
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:54,100
- I'LL TRY.

581
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,534
YEAH, I'D LIKE TO REPORT
A DEAD ANIMAL.

582
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:03,968
UH, COUNTY ROAD 5,
MILE MARKER 31.

583
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,033
I'M NOT SURE.

584
00:28:05,033 --> 00:28:06,834
I THINK IT WAS A GATOR.

585
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:09,934
IT WAS LONG AND SCALY.

586
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:14,934
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

587
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:18,234
IT'S ON BOYD'S CIRCUIT,
SO HE'LL GET THE CALL.

588
00:28:18,234 --> 00:28:20,067
WHEN HE DOES, BOYD WILL
TAKE A LITTLE NAP

589
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:23,067
AND WAKE UP IN THE TOURIST
WELCOME CENTER,

590
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:26,334
BUT HE WON'T BE COLLECTING
ANY BROCHURES.

591
00:28:26,334 --> 00:28:30,200
- WASN'T SURE YOU'D BE HERE.

592
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,334
- WOULDN'T MISS IT
FOR THE WORLD.

593
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,801
- HEY, I'M A SAFETY GUY.

594
00:28:33,801 --> 00:28:36,734
- RIGHT.

595
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:39,501
NEVER BE TOO SAFE.

596
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:41,100
WHERE WE OFF TO FIRST?

597
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:44,367
- DEAD CAT ON LINDGREN.
BORING.

598
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,400
PRETTY NEIGHBORHOOD THOUGH.

599
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,434
LOT OF TROPHY WIVES
OUT JOGGING AT THIS HOUR.

600
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:52,634
- [chuckles]
THERE'S A BONUS.

601
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:54,734
- YOU HAVE TO EMBRACE THE NOW.

602
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:56,367
EVERY SECOND YOU WASTE
IS ONE MORE SECOND

603
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:58,267
YOU'LL NEVER GET BACK.

604
00:28:58,267 --> 00:28:59,767
- EVER HEAR THIS GUY?

605
00:28:59,767 --> 00:29:01,501
- WHEN I WAS SEARCHING
YOUR HOUSE.

606
00:29:01,501 --> 00:29:03,067
- CHANGED MY LIFE.

607
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:06,300
REALLY HELPED ME SEE
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

608
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,601
DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

609
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:11,267
EASE YOU THROUGH
THAT DIVORCE.

610
00:29:11,267 --> 00:29:13,434
- DIVORCE?

611
00:29:13,434 --> 00:29:15,701
- RING DENT.

612
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,534
- I DIDN'T WANT BOYD
TO KNOW THAT PART OF MY LIFE.

613
00:29:18,534 --> 00:29:21,067
FOR A ROADKILL JANITOR,
HE DOESN'T MISS MUCH.

614
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:22,968
- HOPE IT'S NOT
A TOUCHY SUBJECT.

615
00:29:22,968 --> 00:29:26,033
- NO, IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT.

616
00:29:26,033 --> 00:29:28,000
- IF YOU NEED HELP
MOVING ON,

617
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,300
LISTEN TO THESE CDs.

618
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,167
- TAKE IT.
- TAKE IT NOW.

619
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:35,734
THAT'S THE MAIN IDEA.

620
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,467
- TAKE IT NOW?

621
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:38,934
- THERE'S MORE TO IT
THAN THAT,

622
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:41,033
BUT IT REALLY
MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

623
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:45,601
OF COURSE, YOU GOT TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT TO TAKE.

624
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:52,834
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT, DARYL?

625
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,534
- THAT'S KIND OF
A HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER.

626
00:29:55,534 --> 00:29:57,300
- YES, IT IS.

627
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,901
BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S WHAT
WE'RE ON THIS EARTH TO FIND OUT.

628
00:30:22,033 --> 00:30:25,067
- [chuckles]

629
00:30:25,067 --> 00:30:29,367
JUSTIN BIEBER.

630
00:30:29,367 --> 00:30:31,767
NOT THAT I KNOW WHO THAT IS.

631
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:40,334
- I KNOW WHO PURCHASED
THE SANTA MUERTE ICONS,

632
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:42,000
AND IT WASN'T
OUR DEAD HUSBAND.

633
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,267
- FAUZI TALKED?

634
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,767
- I WAS RIGHT.
HE WAS HOLDING BACK.

635
00:30:44,767 --> 00:30:46,133
- WHAT'D YOU GET?

636
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,801
- NO NAMES,
BUT A DESCRIPTION.

637
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:49,634
TWO GUYS IN THEIR 30s,
STRONG ACCENTS,

638
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:52,400
POSSIBLY RECENT IMMIGRANTS
FROM VENEZUELA.

639
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,334
CRIMINAL TYPES.
THOSE WERE HIS WORDS.

640
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:57,801
AND BIG INTO SANTA MUERTE.

641
00:30:57,801 --> 00:30:59,934
- WHAT IF ALFARO
ISN'T FREAKED OUT

642
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:01,868
BECAUSE HE JUST MURDERED
HIS WIFE?

643
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:05,200
WHAT IF HE'S FREAKED OUT BECAUSE
SOMEONE'S GOT HIS WIFE?

644
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,801
- AND THEY'LL KILL HER UNLESS
HE PAYS CASH.

645
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:09,534
- THIS ISN'T DRUG RELATED.

646
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,701
MAYBE SHE WAS FUCKING
HELD HOSTAGE FOR RANSOM.

647
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:15,067
YOU THINK FAUZI SPILLED
EVERYTHING HE KNOWS?

648
00:31:15,067 --> 00:31:16,267
- HE'S BEEN ASKING
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

649
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:17,467
THINKS HE CAN DIG UP
SOME MORE.

650
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:19,701
- WELL,
LET'S FUCKING FIND OUT.

651
00:31:19,701 --> 00:31:23,534
- SOMETIMES IT GETS SO HOT,
THESE THINGS

652
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:26,868
ACTUALLY START FRYING.
AND YOU GOT TO--

653
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:29,868
YOU GOT TO SCRAPE 'EM OFF
LIKE DINER FOOD.

654
00:31:29,868 --> 00:31:32,467
- TWO HOURS AND NO CALL
ABOUT MY GATOR.

655
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:34,234
THEY MUST HAVE SENT
SOMEONE ELSE.

656
00:31:34,234 --> 00:31:35,834
- GOD ALMIGHTY.

657
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:38,000
THAT STINK GETS
IN YOUR SOUL.

658
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,501
- WHICH MEANS THIS KILL
IS DEAD.

659
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:43,067
- MAN, YOU GOT A NOSE OF STEEL.

660
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,200
YOU'RE MADE FOR THIS JOB.

661
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,767
- [chuckles]
NOW I'M STUCK WITH BOYD.

662
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,467
- [grunts]

663
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:54,467
- SO MUCH FOR GETTING
MY LIFE BACK.

664
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:04,601
- IT'S ALMOST LUNCH TIME.

665
00:32:04,601 --> 00:32:06,901
I USUALLY EAT AT HOME
BY MYSELF,

666
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:09,400
BUT THERE'S A CHINESE PLACE
NOT TOO FAR.

667
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,534
[cell phone rings]

668
00:32:10,534 --> 00:32:13,133
HANG ON.

669
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:14,567
[sighs]

670
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:15,968
BOYD.

671
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:18,167
- MAYBE THE UNIVERSE
IS SHOWING MERCY ON ME.

672
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:20,434
- WHAT'S THE LOCATION?

673
00:32:20,434 --> 00:32:22,400
I'M ON IT.

674
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,934
- WHAT'S UP?

675
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:26,567
- DEAD GATOR
OUT ON COUNTY FIVE.

676
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:28,567
FIRST PROMISING THING ALL DAY.

677
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,033
BUT IF YOU'RE STARVING,

678
00:32:30,033 --> 00:32:31,033
WE CAN PUSH IT
TILL AFTER LUNCH.

679
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,067
- I'M GOOD.

680
00:32:32,067 --> 00:32:33,901
- THEN LET'S RUMBLE.

681
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,033
GATOR RUNS CAN GET HAIRY.

682
00:32:39,033 --> 00:32:40,868
YOU GOT TO BE ON YOUR TOES.

683
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:42,367
- HAIRY HOW?

684
00:32:42,367 --> 00:32:45,133
- CAN'T ALWAYS TELL
IF THEY'RE REALLY DEAD.

685
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:47,267
- YIKES.

686
00:32:47,267 --> 00:32:49,133
- DON'T WORRY.
LIKE I SAID...

687
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:52,834
I'M A SAFETY GUY.

688
00:32:52,834 --> 00:32:55,734
- MUST BE AT LUNCH.

689
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:17,367
- HELLO?

690
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:19,300
HELLO?

691
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:28,801
SHIT.
[guns click]

692
00:33:28,801 --> 00:33:32,267
- DETECTIVE.

693
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:34,234
- CALL IT IN.

694
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,133
DO IT.

695
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:41,100
- THIS IS OFFICER MANZON.

696
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:06,200
- MILE MARKER SHOULD
BE RIGHT AROUND HERE.

697
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,734
BE CAREFUL.

698
00:34:07,734 --> 00:34:09,067

- WHY WERE YOU UNCONSCIOUS?

725
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:32,334
- THEY MUST NOT HAVE FOUND
MY NEEDLE.

726
00:35:32,334 --> 00:35:36,200
- I GUESS I WAS JUST SO UPSET
THAT I PASSED OUT.

727
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,567
- THERE'S ONE PIECE
OF GOOD LUCK.

- OKAY.

751
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,834
WE'RE GONNA RUN
A CHEM PROFILE

752

IN YOUR SYSTEM.

JUST GIVE HIM ASPIRIN.
NO PAINKILLERS.

761

- I'M SORRY, DOCTOR.

762
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,434
I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT HIS ADDICTION.

763
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:05,601

PATIENT'S RECORDS HERE, HE'S--

FIFTH TIME HE'S BEEN
IN THE E.R. THIS YEAR.

THIS IS HIS FIFTH ACCIDENT.

766
00:38:08,934 --> 00:38:10,033

AND I WAS IN
SUCH A GOOD MOOD.

00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,200
I GOT HIM KILLED.

774
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,167
- FUCK THAT.
YOU DIDN'T CUT HIS HEAD OFF.

775
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:39,501
- THEY DID THIS BECAUSE
HE STARTED TALKING TO ME.

776
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:43,567
IF I HADN'T COME BACK HERE,
FAUZI WOULD STILL BE ALIVE.

WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.

779
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:50,167
AND WE'RE CLOSER TO CATCHING HIM
BECAUSE OF YOU, OKAY?

A LEAD ON KYLE BUTLER.

IS THERE ANY CHANCE I COULD TALK
TO THE MITCHELL FAMILY?

802
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,067
- THE MITCHELLS
ARE IN A SAFE HOUSE.

FIRST STOP BEFORE
WITNESS PROTECTION.

804

A PHOTO.

TAKE FIVE MINUTES.

00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:47,300
- GIVE ME THE PHOTO.
I'LL SHOW IT TO THEM.

- AHH, IT'S TOO SENSITIVE.

808
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:51,501
IF I'M WRONG,
IT COULD MEAN MY ASS.

TAKE ANYTHING...

- YOU HAVE TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS YOU WANT.

819
00:41:06,234 --> 00:41:08,901
MAY SOUND EASY, BUT YOU
CAN'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT

820
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:10,734
UNLESS YOU KNOW YOURSELF.

821
00:41:10,734 --> 00:41:14,133
BUT IF YOU WANT SOMETHING,
THERE'S ONLY ONE OPTION.

00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:16,667
TAKE IT.

00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,100
COULD HAVE ALSO GONE WORSE.

BE A LITTLE LATER
THAN I EXPECTED.

- IT'S NO PROBLEM.

837
00:41:54,968 --> 00:41:57,000
- MY SISTER SHOULD
BE THERE ANY MINUTE THOUGH.

838
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,434
- ACTUALLY, SHE PHONED TOO.
SHE'S TIED UP AT WORK.

839
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:01,767
- OH.
- IT'S OKAY.

I DON'T MIND STAYING LATE.

00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:08,100
- I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.

844
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,400
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

845
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
- HE TOOK HIS FIRST STEP.

846
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,667
AT LEAST I THINK
IT WAS HIS FIRST.

847
00:42:14,667 --> 00:42:15,968
- HE DID?

848
00:42:15,968 --> 00:42:17,467
- IT WAS ONLY ONE STEP,
BUT YOU COULD TELL

849
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:19,767
HE WAS REALLY PROUD
OF HIMSELF.

850
00:42:19,767 --> 00:42:23,000
- THAT'S AMAZING.

851
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,434

I WONDER IF I COULD HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU IN PRIVATE?

866

A SERGEANT LOPEZ.

876
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:34,634
- I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THE MATTER WAS SETTLED.

877
00:43:34,634 --> 00:43:36,000
- OH, FAR FROM IT.

878
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,534
LOPEZ COLLAPSED
WHILE ON DUTY TODAY.

879
00:43:37,534 --> 00:43:40,601
HE'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED
WITH INTERNAL BLEEDING.

880
00:43:40,601 --> 00:43:41,734
- MY GOD.

881
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:43,934
- WE BELIEVE
THAT HE'LL PULL THROUGH,

882
00:43:43,934 --> 00:43:45,133
BUT HE'S FILED CHARGES.

883
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:48,133
SOMETHING ELSE YOU
SHOULD BE AWARE OF:

884
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:51,400
WE HAVE TWO EYEWITNESSES
WHO CLAIM THAT THEY SAW BATISTA

885
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,601
KICK SERGEANT LOPEZ
WHILE ON THE GROUND.

886
00:43:53,601 --> 00:43:54,834
NOW, IF THAT IS TRUE,

887
00:43:54,834 --> 00:43:57,467
THAT IS ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON

888
00:43:57,467 --> 00:43:59,934
AND HE COULD NOT ONLY
LOSE HIS JOB...

889
00:43:59,934 --> 00:44:02,868
HE COULD SERVE TIME.

890
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,701
- HAD TO BORROW THIS FROM YOU.

891
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:33,434
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

892
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:35,501
- WHAT THE HELL?

893
00:44:35,501 --> 00:44:37,634
- NORMALLY,
I BRING MY OWN PLASTIC,

894
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:41,567
BUT...
I HAD TO...

895
00:44:41,567 --> 00:44:43,834
IMPROVISE.

896
00:44:43,834 --> 00:44:45,567
- [grunts]

897
00:44:45,567 --> 00:44:47,033
LET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

898
00:44:47,033 --> 00:44:49,000
- I BET YOU'VE HEARD
THAT BEFORE--

899
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:52,234
"LET ME OUT OF HERE"--FROM
ALL THE WOMEN YOU'VE KILLED.

900
00:44:57,934 --> 00:45:02,868
I WISH YOU COULD SEE
THE ROOM I SET UP FOR YOU.

901
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:04,901
BUT YOU FUCKED
EVERYTHING UP, BOYD.

902
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:13,367
ALL THOSE PICTURES I TOOK

903
00:45:13,367 --> 00:45:14,868
OF THE WOMEN YOU KILLED.

904
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:18,133
IT'S A SHAME YOU'LL NEVER
GET TO SEE THEM.

905
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:28,267
I'LL JUST HAVE TO PAINT
A WORD-PICTURE FOR YOU INSTEAD.

906
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,801
THEY WERE YOUNG.

907
00:45:30,801 --> 00:45:33,634
JUST STARTING THEIR LIVES.

908
00:45:33,634 --> 00:45:35,267
NOW THEY'RE FLOATING
IN FORMALDEHYDE

909
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:39,033
AND STUFFED INTO BARRELS STREWN
AROUND A SWAMP.

910
00:45:39,033 --> 00:45:40,667
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

911
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:43,534
- JUST A FELLOW TRAVELER

912
00:45:43,534 --> 00:45:46,000
WHO...

913
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,234
ALSO LIKES TO PICK UP
DEAD ANIMALS.

914
00:45:48,234 --> 00:45:51,334
- I DID 'EM A FAVOR.

915
00:45:51,334 --> 00:45:53,667
THEY WERE ALL SUFFERING
AND I PUT 'EM

916
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:56,901
OUT OF THEIR MISERY.

917
00:45:56,901 --> 00:46:00,834
- YEAH, YOU'LL BE DOING
ONE MORE FAVOR TONIGHT.

918
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:04,100
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

919
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,300
- I'VE RECENTLY SUFFERED
A LOSS.

920
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,701
MY WIFE...

921
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:13,300
WAS MURDERED
BY SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

922
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,567
SOMEONE LIKE ME.

923
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:18,601
IT TURNED MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN.

924
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:20,534
- WHY IS IT MY PROBLEM?

925
00:46:20,534 --> 00:46:23,767
- BECAUSE YOU'RE THE START
OF MY HEALING PROCESS.

926
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:26,534
- I KNEW YOU WERE FUCKED UP

927
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,801
THE MINUTE
I LAID EYES ON YOU.

928
00:46:29,801 --> 00:46:32,334
- I WAS FUCKED UP LONG
BEFORE THAT.

929
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:34,267
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING INTO.

930
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:39,501
- REMEMBER IN THE TRUCK
YOU ASKED ME WHAT I WANT?

931
00:46:39,501 --> 00:46:45,033
I WANT MY WIFE BACK...

932
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:47,267
BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO DO.

933
00:46:47,267 --> 00:46:49,167
- [grunts and coughs]

934
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,033
- NO CHURCH BELLS.

935
00:47:03,033 --> 00:47:05,100
NO HALLELUJAH CHORUS.

936
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,000
NOTHING FEELS DIFFERENT.

937
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,601
IF ANYTHING, I'M EMPTIER.

938
00:47:10,601 --> 00:47:12,133
[scuffling]

939
00:47:31,434 --> 00:47:32,968
IT'S OKAY.

940
00:47:32,968 --> 00:47:37,634
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

941
00:47:37,634 --> 00:47:41,334
IT'S OKAY.
HERE.

942
00:47:41,334 --> 00:47:43,968
NO, DON'T.
DON'T.

943
00:47:43,968 --> 00:47:45,133
STOP.

944
00:47:45,133 --> 00:47:47,100
NO.

945
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:55,334
SHE SAW EVERYTHING.

946
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:57,901
- [groans]

947
00:47:57,901 --> 00:48:00,634
- SHE SAW...ME.
