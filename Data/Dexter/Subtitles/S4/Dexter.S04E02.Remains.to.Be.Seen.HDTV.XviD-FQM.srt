Dexter morgan.

3
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,311
Good suburban husband.

4
00:01:50,345 --> 00:01:52,447
Happy father of three.

5
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:54,032
Living the dream.

6
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:55,783
Want to know
a secret?

7
00:01:55,818 --> 00:01:59,353
Daddy kills people.

8
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,123
- i'm halfway through
the c.i. files you gave me.

9
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:06,027
Maybe then i'll
finally get some answers.

10
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:07,495
- tell me again
this isn't crazy.

11
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:10,465
- crazy good.

12
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,667
Some guy on his honeymoon took
a shot in the head.

13
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:13,751
Grave condition.

14
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,369
They're pulling
the plug tomorrow.

15
00:02:15,387 --> 00:02:17,055
- last thing our city needs
is dead tourists.

16
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:19,040
- brought you a copy
of my article.

17
00:02:19,058 --> 00:02:21,542
My editor okayed a follow-up.
you got anything for me?

18
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,062
I'd love to take you out
for a drink.

19
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:26,097
- let's make it dinner.

20
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:31,552
- dexter.

21
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,738
- how's my favorite
serial-killer hunter?

22
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:35,406
- are you here on a case?

23
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,742
- actually i'm retired now.

24
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,160
Now i have the time
to track down

25
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:42,196
The one twisted son of a bitch
who got away.

26
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,200
- so who is the twisted
son of a bitch?

27
00:02:46,234 --> 00:02:48,920
- i call him
the trinity killer.

28
00:02:48,954 --> 00:02:50,121
Kills in threes.

29
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:52,423
Been doing it all over
the country for years.

30
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,759
Trinity's in miami,
dexter,

31
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:56,878
Starting his cycle
all over again.

32
00:02:56,912 --> 00:03:00,682
- vicky noonan, 22,
found in the bathtub.

33
00:03:00,716 --> 00:03:02,583
- 1979?

34
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:04,102
- but this is
the gomez hearing.

35
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:05,920
- yes, mr. morgan.

36
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:08,255
The defendent's name
is benito gomez.

37
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,557
- i must have brought
the wrong notes.

38
00:03:09,591 --> 00:03:11,693
- wrong notes,
wrong blood type,

39
00:03:11,727 --> 00:03:12,894
Wrong case.

40
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:14,261
That's what you call
a momentary mix-up

41
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:15,396
In a murder trial?

42
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,614
- that asshole you let walk?

43
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:18,066
- benito gomez.

44
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,284
- ahh!
now you get it right.

45
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,153
- quinn's legwork
may have shown me

46
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:23,705
Where to find
our friend,

47
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:25,206
But this, benny,

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,576
My bloodwork is the stuff
that seals your fate.

49
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,777
- fuck you want?

50
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,779
- you.

51
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:33,781
Shutdown for decades
way out of town.

52
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,217
A fitting place for a punk
like benny gomez

53
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:39,253
To go down
for the count.

54
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:48,262
Tonight's the night
i finally...

55
00:03:48,296 --> 00:03:49,480
Sleep.

00:04:49,524 --> 00:04:51,358
- do you know where you are?

65
00:04:51,376 --> 00:04:52,743
- ambulance.
what happened?

66
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:54,361
- you were in an accident.

67
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,464
- [grunts]

68
00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:59,500
- benny.
benny. benny.

69
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:17,068
- sir, we found something
in your car.

70
00:05:17,102 --> 00:05:19,687
- benny gomez is in there.

71
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:20,738
- you're okay.

72
00:05:20,772 --> 00:05:23,858
- a bag.

73
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:25,993
Says "pediatric" on it.

74
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:30,581
Thought you might need
to take it with you.

75
00:05:30,616 --> 00:05:32,116
- where are they
taking my car?

76
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,168
- just relax.
they'll take care of it.

77
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,704
- i have no idea
where it's going.

78
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:38,089
If someone--

79
00:05:38,123 --> 00:05:42,210
<i>when someone finds
what's in back...</i>

80
00:05:42,244 --> 00:05:43,577
- it's never as bad
as it looks.

81
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,713
- oh, i'm pretty sure
this is worse.

82
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:48,749
[siren wails]

83
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,555
- what's your name?

84
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,423
- dexter morgan.

85
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:58,142
- you know who
the president is?

86
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,394
- barack obama.

87
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,363
- your pupils
are dilating normally,

88
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:04,431
Which is the good news.

89
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,784
Bad news is that you've
sustained a concussion.

90
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:11,622
What's the last thing
you remember?

91
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:14,492
- working late.

92
00:06:14,543 --> 00:06:16,661
My wife...

93
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,963
Asked me to pick up some
medicine for our son.

94
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,915
He's been sick.

95
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,216
I haven't been
sleeping well.

96
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,784
I must have dozed off
at the wheel.

97
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:25,169
- so you don't remember
the accident?

98
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,004
- no.

99
00:06:27,055 --> 00:06:28,956
I don't even remember getting
in the car.

100
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,958
- short-term memory loss
is common

101
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:32,476
For this type of injury.

102
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:34,512
Can also effect your judgment,
cause confusion,

103
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:35,963
Disorientation.

104
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,065
- i just need a good night's
sleep, i think.

105
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,767
- not for the next 12 hours.

106
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,435
Any type of head trauma,
we want

107
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:42,904
To keep
the patient awake.

108
00:06:42,938 --> 00:06:44,605
I'd like to keep you here
for observation.

109
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,806
- not an option.

110
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:47,024
Mmm.

111
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,242
My wife's a registered nurse.

112
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,443
She'll keep an eye on me.

113
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,312
- you got whacked pretty good,
mr. morgan.

114
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,613
You need to be monitored.

115
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,198
I'll get your admission
paperwork going.

116
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:56,250
Be right back.

117
00:06:59,671 --> 00:07:01,005
- dexter!

118
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,373
Oh, my god!

119
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:03,591
- [grunts]
- are you all right?

120
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:04,675
- i'm fine.

121
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,993
It's just a little fender
bender.

122
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,678
- the nurse said they brought
you in an ambulance.

123
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:08,879
An ambulance, dexter.

124
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,381
- no, it's just
a liability thing.

125
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,216
Doc says i'm good to go.

126
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:14,685
- [sighs]
i raced over here.

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,770
Look at me.

128
00:07:15,804 --> 00:07:18,055
I'm wearing
two different shoes.

129
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:19,673
Sure you're okay?

130
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:20,674
You look so pale.

131
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:22,343
- [scoffs]
hospitals.

132
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:24,528
They give me the creeps,
which is why

133
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:25,813
I want to get out of here.

134
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:30,234
- i was so scared.

135
00:07:30,285 --> 00:07:32,903
- it's okay.
i'm fine.

136
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:34,155
Come on.

137
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,522
Let's go.

138
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,025
I got to get ready
for work.

139
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:41,078
Aspirin, caffeine,
whatever it takes.

140
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:43,164
If i fall asleep,
it's over.

141
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,799
And i'm not talking
concussion.

142
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:48,219
If they find benny in my car,
it's lethal injection time.

143
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:52,206
- cody, you butt-breath,
stay away from my stuff!

144
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:54,258
- if ever there was a reason
to take a personal day,

145
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:55,426
This is it.

146
00:07:55,477 --> 00:07:56,978
- i'm okay.

147
00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:58,896
But i love having someone
to worry about me.

148
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:03,317
- good, 'cause that's exactly
what i'm doing.

149
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,735
- who else needs a kiss?

150
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,220
- i'm good.

151
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:09,190
- how about a hug?

152
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,358
- oh!

153
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:12,026
- what's the matter?

154
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,862
- uh, just a little sore
from the accident still.

155
00:08:14,896 --> 00:08:16,864
- you got in an accident?

156
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:18,199
- anyone die?

157
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:19,834
- just a little fender bender.

158
00:08:19,868 --> 00:08:21,902
No one died.

159
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,504
[horn honks]

160
00:08:23,538 --> 00:08:24,922
There's my cab.

161
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:26,424
- dexter, why can't you
just call in?

162
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,459
- and what?
take a vacation day?

163
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,878
I'd rather do that when we can
all go to disneyworld.

164
00:08:30,912 --> 00:08:33,464
- disneyworld!

165
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:34,748
[horn honks]

166
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:35,933
- i'm fine.

167
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:39,103
I got to go to work.

168
00:08:39,137 --> 00:08:41,222
And i need one slow day
at the job

169
00:08:41,256 --> 00:08:42,756
Where nobody gets murdered.

170
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:45,226
I already have a killer
to clean up after.

171
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,095
Me.

172
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:49,697
<i>- hay cafe con leche
in the kitchen.</i>

173
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,115
- i'll grab some at work.

174
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:54,035
Got to make sure to get there
before you do.

175
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:57,121
- don't want
to arouse suspicion.

176
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:59,623
- mmm.

177
00:08:59,658 --> 00:09:04,611
Speaking of arousing...

178
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,832
- you keep this up,
there goes your head start.

179
00:09:07,883 --> 00:09:09,750
- [chuckles]

180
00:09:09,784 --> 00:09:12,586
What if we showed up together,
hmm?

181
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,589
What's the worst

Instead of miami,
i wouldn't have access

00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:20,457
- only as a reminder
to wear sunblock.

361
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:23,043
But i'm still waiting
on a few call backs

362
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:24,545
From some other names
on the list,

363
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,380
But so far,
i'm starting to think

364
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:30,617
Maybe i fucked around more
than my old man did.

365
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:31,885
- just work the scene.

366
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,970
Don't raise flags.

367
00:17:33,004 --> 00:17:34,922
Just work the scene...

368
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:37,674
Then get the hell
to the boxing arena.

369
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:41,261
[indistinct radio chatter]

370
00:17:41,295 --> 00:17:42,729
- get those news trucks
out of here.

371
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:43,797
I got a coroner's van
coming through.

372
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,816
- copy that.

373
00:17:48,353 --> 00:17:49,686
- hey, joey.

374
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:51,321
- this is an active
crime scene, ma'am.

375
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:53,106
I'm gonna need you behind
that tape.

376
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,475
- "ma'am"?

377
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:57,110
- your article,
"vacation murder"?

378
00:17:57,144 --> 00:17:58,996
- "murders" now,
it seems.

379
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,313
- see, how am i supposed
to talk to you

380
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,615
When i got to watch
everything i say?

381
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:07,170
- which means you do still
want to talk to me?

382
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,538
- yeah, i do.

383
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,706
- good.

384
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:11,825
'cause i like talking to you.

385
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,327
Amongst other things.

386
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:15,879
- those things are good,
but we got

387
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,215
To have some ground rules.

388
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:24,170
- quinn, i need you
to run an inventory

389
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:25,722
On the victim's personal
effects.

390
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:28,225
- i'm on it, boss.

391
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,610
- stay back here, ma'am.

392
00:18:29,644 --> 00:18:31,228
You know better.

393
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,230
- [sighs]

394
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:35,015
Your timing sucks.

395
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,700
- what have we got here?

396
00:18:36,734 --> 00:18:38,986
- shot from behind as he was
coming in the room.

397
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,021
Caught a medium-caliber bullet
in the back of the neck.

398
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,824
- empty wallet, watch missing,
drawer's empty.

399
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:45,659
- someone figured out
it's easier to rob

400
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,160
People who are dead first.

401
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:50,047
- directional swipe pattern
of one of the assailant's shoes

402
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,248
Shows he went that way.

403
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,033
- okay, angel,
start a canvass.

404
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:54,918
Guests, employees,
security cameras.

405
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:55,919
- already handled.

406
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,471
- next of kin will have
to be notified.

407
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,556
- got it, if you're good
with that, lieutenant.

408
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,891
- you got your hands
full here.

409
00:19:00,925 --> 00:19:02,926
I'll deal with it.

410
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,929
- what's up with the boss lady
taking lead on your case?

411
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,981
- chain of command is there
for a reason, vince.

412
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,516
Just do your
god damn job.

413
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,068
- [groans]

414
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:12,569
- dude, your gills are green.

415
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:14,071
You gonna blow?

416
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,106
- uh, i need to get some air.

417
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:27,617
[sighs]
don't have time for this.

418
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:31,237
Oh.

419
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,907
Are we blood?

420
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:46,269
- join you?

421
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:49,389
- 1:00.
some things--

422
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:51,274
Holy-what-the-fuck is that?

423
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:52,442
- sushi.

424
00:19:52,477 --> 00:19:54,778
- what happened
to the daily cucumber sammy?

425
00:19:54,812 --> 00:19:57,531
It retire along
with the rest of you?

426
00:19:57,565 --> 00:19:59,566
- all that cream cheese
wasn't exactly

427
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,768
Helping my cholesterol.

428
00:20:01,786 --> 00:20:03,203
- [scoffs]

429
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:04,988
I'm sorry.
this is too fucking weird.

430
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,240
- i can get a sandwich if
it makes you more comfortable.

431
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,459
- no, it's...

432
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:11,611
This.

433
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,613
Us.

434
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:16,116
I haven't seen you,
spoken to you,

435
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,085
Or exchanged so much as
a fucking christmas card

436
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,753
With you in two years.

437
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:21,671
Now all of a sudden
you're in miami

438
00:20:21,723 --> 00:20:23,640
Holding a pair of chopsticks
without so much

439
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:26,059
As an email saying,
"hey, remember me?

440
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,677
"we used to fuck.
i'm coming to town.

441
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,479
You want to grab lunch?"

442
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:32,966
I mean, seriously.
what the fuck?

443
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:36,186
I know.
same old mouth.

444
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:37,971
- not without its charm.

445
00:20:37,989 --> 00:20:39,305
- really?

446
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,809
That's all you have
to say to me?

447
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:46,496
- i should have let you know
i was coming to miami.

448
00:20:46,531 --> 00:20:48,698
This task force they're trying
to put together

449
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,983
Is hush-hush.

450
00:20:50,001 --> 00:20:52,318
Plus i knew you'd be busy,

451
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,121
What with making detective
and all.

452
00:20:54,155 --> 00:20:56,990
- yeah, well,
tell me about it.

453
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,792
I have a suspect en route.

454
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:00,627
- the lisa bell case?

455
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:03,046
- what do you know
about lisa bell?

456
00:21:03,097 --> 00:21:08,051
- only what your brother's
told me.

457
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:11,521
- well, "check this,"
she brags.

458
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:13,356
We found another murder.

459
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:14,691
30 years old.

460
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:16,443
Same m.o.,
same address,

461
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:18,195
Same fucking bathtub.

462
00:21:18,229 --> 00:21:19,229
A guy was convicted.

463
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,480
He's back out in the world.

464
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:23,316
So how do i not like him
for slicing up lisa bell?

465
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,452
- sounds like he deserves
a good hard look.

466
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:27,704
- i had patrol pick him up.

467
00:21:27,738 --> 00:21:29,206
Should be here any minute.

468
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,459
- mind if i tag along?

469
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:33,794
- to the interview?

470
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:38,215
- i'd like to see detective
morgan in all her glory.

471
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:41,051
- sounds like someone's bored
with retirement already.

472
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:42,586
- here you go.
thanks very much.

473
00:21:42,637 --> 00:21:44,838
Keep the change.

474
00:21:44,872 --> 00:21:46,506
Come on, guys.

475
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,508
Come on, boys.

476
00:22:01,272 --> 00:22:02,722
- oh, sorry, sir.

477
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,441
It was an accident.

478
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:05,775
- it's okay, kiddo.

479
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:07,527
It happens.

480
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:08,995
What is that,
strawberry?

481
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,831
- uh, bubble gum gelato.

482
00:22:10,865 --> 00:22:14,034
- how, uh...
repulsive.

483
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:18,255
[chuckles]

484
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:22,742
You better catch up
with your mom.

485
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,761
You don't want
to lose her.

486
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:34,271
- just had to find blood,
didn't you?

487
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:36,223
- it is my job.

488
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:38,024
- and you've got
a family to support

489
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,110
And people to dismember.

490
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:41,728
You're spinning
too many plates, dexter.

491
00:22:41,762 --> 00:22:43,396
- the sooner i wrap this up,

492
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,098
The sooner i get
to the boxing arena.

493
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:46,283
- you might want
to give some thought

494
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:47,317
As to what happens
when somebody else

495
00:22:47,368 --> 00:22:49,319
Finds that body.

496
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:53,573
- [sighs and clears throat]

497
00:22:53,607 --> 00:22:55,659
- manager's on his way
to open the safe.

498
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,911
- what's the date of birth
on his passport?

499
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,080
- 5/5/72.

500
00:23:04,385 --> 00:23:06,336
[keypad tones]

501
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,093
- [sighs]
geez.

502
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:35,699
- don't sweat it, quinn.

503
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,618
I've got much bigger things
to worry about.

504
00:23:38,652 --> 00:23:40,653
- i filled in the lieutenant
on what we found.

505
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,822
- "we"?

506
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,925
- dude, there's
no "me" in "team."

507
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:47,711
Well, technically
there is, but--

508
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:49,129
- blood deposit
on the yucca

509
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:50,347
On the assailant's
escape route.

510
00:23:50,381 --> 00:23:51,681
He probably scraped himself.

511
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:52,966
- does that mean
we have his dna?

512
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,967
- i'll run it through
the database

513
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,001
Soon as i get back
to the lab.

514
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:56,136
- go.

515
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,638
You, come with me.

516
00:23:58,672 --> 00:24:00,390
- i'm going...

517
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,692
Just not where you think.

518
00:24:02,727 --> 00:24:05,779
- you were convicted of killing
your wife back in '79.

519
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:07,480
Sliced open her
femoral artery.

520
00:24:07,514 --> 00:24:09,366
She bled to death
in your bathtub.

521
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,651
- do i need to talk
to a lawyer?

522
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:13,453
- at this point,
we're interviewing you

523
00:24:13,487 --> 00:24:15,121
To get more or less
an expert opinion.

524
00:24:15,156 --> 00:24:17,023
- see, your case bears an
uncanny resemblance

525
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:18,658
To a case we're working
on now.

526
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:22,662
Same m.o. a la
that femoral artery.

527
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:24,965
Same house.

528
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,049
- same everything.

529
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:28,134
- no fucking way.

530
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:30,220
- yes fucking way.

531
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:33,340
Sort of puts you at number one,
person-of-interest-wise.

532
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:34,641
- i didn't kill my wife.

533
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:36,042
- oh, no?

534
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,594
You're just another
innocent man behind bars

535
00:24:37,645 --> 00:24:38,711
For no good reason.

536
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,430
- the fucking deck
was stacked

537
00:24:40,481 --> 00:24:42,215
Before i walked into
that courtroom

538
00:24:42,233 --> 00:24:44,234
In a death penalty state.

539
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:46,186
- you copped
to doing the deed.

540
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,437
You took the deal.

541
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:49,072
- i did my time
and i moved on.

542
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:50,273
- you moved on to lisa bell.

543
00:24:50,324 --> 00:24:52,275
- who is lisa bell?

544
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,727
- the young lady that you killed
last monday night

545
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,579
In your old house.

546
00:24:56,614 --> 00:25:01,951
Whatever sick fucking poetry
you find in that.

547
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:06,572
Tell us what you did,
mr. noonan.

548
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,177
- it was muggy
for so late at night.

549
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:15,015
And vicky, my wife...

550
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:18,885
Wanted to cool off
in the tub, so...

551
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,257
I went out to score some shit
and i came back.

552
00:25:24,275 --> 00:25:26,592
And i found her.

553
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,598
[weeping]

554
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,234
- i wish i could buy
the tears.

555
00:25:34,268 --> 00:25:36,236
I just...

556
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,238
I can't get there.

557
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:40,490
- monday night i was working
a swing shift

558
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:42,325
At the homeless shelter
in allapatah

559
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:44,244
Hosing piss off
the sidewalk

560
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:46,212
From the folks waiting
to get inside

561
00:25:46,247 --> 00:25:50,950
Until 8:00-fucking-a.m.

562
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:52,886
- we'll call
the homeless shelter.

563
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,888
Verify your story.

564
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:03,296
- one, the guy's
a train wreck.

565
00:26:03,314 --> 00:26:05,815
Two, he's a total slob,
he smells like a sewer,

566
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,467
And his fingernails
are disgusting.

567
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:08,518
- our killer's meticulous.

568
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,520
Zero dna left
at the crime scene.

569
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:11,971
- obviously you caught his
case of the shakes.

570
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,324
- given his rehab history,
i'm voting dts.

571
00:26:14,358 --> 00:26:16,443
- and lisa bell was cut
with surgical precision.

572
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:20,480
- so, detective morgan...

573
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:21,581
Are we in agreement here?

574
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:23,783
- violent agreement...

575
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:25,668
Retired special agent lundy.

576
00:26:25,703 --> 00:26:27,921
- if noonan didn't
kill lisa bell,

577
00:26:27,955 --> 00:26:30,540
Why is the m.o. the same
as his wife's murder?

578
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:31,541
- copycat?

579
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:33,493
- of an obscure
30-year-old crime?

580
00:26:33,511 --> 00:26:36,546
- do we think noonan's
telling the truth...

581
00:26:36,597 --> 00:26:38,331
That he didn't kill
his wife?

582
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:39,832
- i believe we do.

583
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,851
- shit.

584
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:45,004
- i have a theory i'd like
to run by you.

585
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:47,273
We could grab dinner,
review the case,

586
00:26:47,308 --> 00:26:49,776
Maybe catch a bad guy.

587
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:55,532
- i...uh...

588
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,400
Okay, i guess.

589
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,536
Um, i've got
to cut noonan loose

590
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,571
And make sure he talks
to a lawyer.

591
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,824
If our side railroaded him
into that plea bargain,

592
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:07,210
He could have one fuck mother
of a case.

593
00:27:07,244 --> 00:27:09,796
- you have a good heart,
debra.

594
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,297
Pick you up around 8:00?

595
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:14,634
- yeah, so i'll--

596
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:18,304
Yes.
yes.

597
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:49,569
- the boxing arena's
at the next off ramp,

598
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:52,622
But i still have miles
to go before i sleep.

599
00:27:57,428 --> 00:28:00,746
Bits and pieces.

600
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,550
Memory fragments.

601
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:05,585
All i have from last night.

602
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:26,823
Looks like i got the job done.

603
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:29,826
Almost.

604
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,745
Blood.

605
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,549
I was off my game.

606
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:39,085
Sloppy.

607
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,503
With harry's code
ingrained in me,

608
00:28:40,554 --> 00:28:43,056
Cleaning a kill room
should be automatic.

609
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,674
The code.

610
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:47,644
Etched into my memory
to ensure survival.

611
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:51,598
What would i do if i couldn't
properly dispose of a body?

612
00:28:51,632 --> 00:28:54,601
I'd hide it.

613
00:28:57,988 --> 00:29:03,326
I investigate crime scenes
all the time.

614
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,977
But this one...

615
00:29:04,995 --> 00:29:08,581
My crime scene...

616
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:13,369
It's giving me nothing.

617
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,322
Damn it.

618
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,490
Focus.

619
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:18,875
Track it.

620
00:29:18,926 --> 00:29:20,710
Where did i go from here?

621
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:24,163
The pharmacy.

622
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,716
Harrison's ear ache medicine.

623
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:30,336
The only stop i made
before the crash.

624
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,809
The only stop i remember.

625
00:29:51,024 --> 00:29:52,575
- if you thought you
were coming right back,

626
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,160
Not a bad hiding place.

627
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:56,496
- why are you wearing those?

628
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:01,084
- this is the way i was dressed
the first time we met.

629
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:02,868
Your mother's murder
was the last time

630
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,036
Your memory was a blank.

631
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,138
Why do you suppose that is?

632
00:30:05,172 --> 00:30:07,173
- not in front of my baby!
no!

633
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:09,509
[screaming]

634
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:12,011
- because not remembering
saved me.

635
00:30:12,045 --> 00:30:13,396
- and now if you want
to save yourself,

636
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,431
You have to remember.

637
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,823
If you don't fix
this screw-up,

638
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:25,408
Harrison's only memory
of his father

639
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:26,776
Will be of you behind bars.

640
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,244
- it's not a screw-up.

641
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:31,531
I just can't remember.

642
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:33,750
Got to check today's
incident reports.

643
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:37,286
Make sure benny's body
hasn't surfaced.

644
00:30:37,338 --> 00:30:39,922
It's in this city somewhere.

645
00:30:39,957 --> 00:30:41,741
- thanks for meeting me here.

646
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:43,426
The sooner we get an estimate
and file a claim,

647
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,211
The sooner my husband
gets his car back.

648
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:46,912
- well, that much damage,
i wouldn't even try

649
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,250
To talk you into fixing it.

650
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,085
- i thought it was
a fender bender.

651
00:30:53,103 --> 00:30:54,804
- well, i'm sure there's
a bent fender

652
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,305
Somewhere in this mess.

653
00:30:56,357 --> 00:30:57,724
- oh, my god.

654
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,859
- everybody got off easy
on this one.

655
00:30:59,893 --> 00:31:02,111
Your husband, my company.

656
00:31:02,146 --> 00:31:05,598
He should count his blessings.

657
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:07,984
- yes, he should.

658
00:31:08,035 --> 00:31:09,736
- hey, buddy.
you lose something?

659
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,455
- there's an understatement.

660
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:14,106
Can't find my i.d.

661
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,609
- use mine to buzz you in.

662
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:19,212
- all right.

663
00:31:19,246 --> 00:31:20,380
Thanks.

664
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:22,165
- look, the other day
after court,

665
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:24,417
I was totally out of line going
off on you like that.

666
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:26,753
Gomez is the criminal,
not you.

667
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:27,787
- no, not me.

668
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:29,305
- plan on having
a heart-to-heart

669
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:31,007
With the prick
when i find him.

670
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,475
- benny?

671
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:34,143
- yeah, want him to know
he's still on my radar,

672
00:31:34,178 --> 00:31:35,795
But he's been laying low.

673
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:37,096
[door buzzes]

674
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,482
- look, can we do this
another time?

675
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:56,032
My password.

676
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:05,625
- access denied, dex.

677
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,662
- i can't even remember
my own password.

678
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,465
- i'm here to help.

679
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:18,387
Think.

680
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:21,507
- h-a-r-r-y.

681
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:29,014
Thanks, dad.

682
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,283
Bank hold-up.

683
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,184
Alligator in backyard.

684
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:35,822
Kidnapped three year old
found safe.

685
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:37,857
But no body parts turning up.

686
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:39,876
[sighs]

687
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:04,717
From boxing arena, to pharmacy,
to the crash.

688
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:10,556
What am i missing?

689
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:13,242
- girl scout cookie
time again?

690
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,028
- no, i froze them
in case of emergency.

691
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:18,898
- what's the emergency?

692
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,082
- frank lundy.

693
00:33:20,117 --> 00:33:22,785
I haven't heard from him
in, like, forever,

694
00:33:22,836 --> 00:33:24,253
And then he shows up out
of the blue

695
00:33:24,288 --> 00:33:26,289
For some hush-hush task force
and wants to know

696
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,907
All about my case.

697
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:29,592
Not to drag you into my shit.

698
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:30,927
- drag away.

699
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:33,212
In this boys' club,
who else you gonna talk to?

700
00:33:33,246 --> 00:33:35,464
- this is about him trying
to get next to me.

701
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,100
- maybe, but you do have
a boyfriend.

702
00:33:38,135 --> 00:33:39,969
- hell yeah, i do.

703
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,188
A good one.

704
00:33:42,222 --> 00:33:43,756
And i'm really fucking happy.

705
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:45,224
- can i make
a suggestion

706
00:33:45,258 --> 00:33:48,110
Before you eat
the box too?

707
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:51,230
If there is still
something, anything,

708
00:33:51,264 --> 00:33:52,365
Between you and lundy--

709
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,400
- there's so not.

710
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:58,454
- closure will set you free.

711
00:33:58,488 --> 00:34:01,073
Does my hair look better
up or down?

712
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,943
- down definitely.

713
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:05,945
- thanks.

714
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,883
- okay, benny,
i got to find you

715
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,451
Before anyone else does.

716
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,387
Better fucking start
all over again.

717
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:17,306
Nothing on the dna results
from the blood on the cactus.

718
00:34:17,341 --> 00:34:20,092
No match in the database.
sorry.

719
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,811
- hang on.
no one's going anywhere.

720
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:23,095
- oh, shit.

721
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,463
- listen up, guys.

722
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:25,982
Everyone working
the vacation murders,

723
00:34:26,016 --> 00:34:27,984
I'm holding over your shift
until further notice.

724
00:34:28,018 --> 00:34:30,102
Call home, let your people know
they'll see you

725
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,437
When they see you.

726
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:33,472
- quinn, my office.

727
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,822
I'm gonna ask you
if we have a problem

728
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,340
And i expect the truth.

729
00:34:51,375 --> 00:34:53,659
- look, lieutenant,
what happened at the hotel,

730
00:34:53,677 --> 00:34:55,761
It's not what you think.

731
00:34:55,796 --> 00:34:58,764
- detective...

732
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:00,049
I'm not gonna tell you
who to date.

733
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,384
It's none of my business.

734
00:35:01,435 --> 00:35:02,718
But you should know
there's no such thing

735
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,854
As off the record
with reporters.

736
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:08,340
So watch the pillow talk
with that woman.

737
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,059
- not a problem, lieutenant.

738
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:12,478
Talking isn't
what we do best anyway.

739
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:34,133
- debra?

740
00:35:34,167 --> 00:35:35,534
I thought i was
picking you up.

741
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,369
- i need to clear
some things up

742
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:40,840
And i owe you nothing less
than complete transparency.

743
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:44,927
- want anything?

744
00:35:44,978 --> 00:35:47,179
Tea? water?

745
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:49,348
- i don't want
to mislead you.

746
00:35:49,382 --> 00:35:52,051
And i certainly don't want
to hurt you.

747
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:56,522
It's just that
what i have with anton,

748
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,158
It's great.

749
00:35:59,192 --> 00:36:02,495
It's really fucking great
and we live together.

750
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,613
And...

751
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:06,231
It's great.

752
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:09,785
And...for the first time
in so long,

753
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:12,755
I'm actually...

754
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:15,291
Happy.

755
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:16,575
No offense.

756
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,243
- you sure you don't
want something to drink?

757
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,763
- did you not hear
a word i just said?

758
00:36:20,797 --> 00:36:21,964
- everything's great.

759
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,716
- exactly.

760
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:27,470
So if you've come back
here to...

761
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:31,607
Rekindle something
between us...

762
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:33,142
It's not gonna happen.

763
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:35,978
- in the interest
of transparency,

764
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:38,314
My purpose in coming
to miami is--

765
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,116
- work related.

766
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,101
Cut the shit, frank.
you're retired.

767
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,987
- the reason i'm in miami

768
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,574
Is because i'm convinced that
these bathtub murders--

769
00:36:48,608 --> 00:36:51,944
Noonan's wife, lisa bell--
are connected

770
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,997
To a series of murders
all over the country.

771
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:06,926
- oh.

772
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,765
- it's become something
of an obsession of mine and...

773
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:14,900
I'm not about to ride off
into the sunset

774
00:37:14,935 --> 00:37:16,819
And dump something
this horrific

775
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:18,821
On whoever gets
my office next.

776
00:37:18,855 --> 00:37:21,273
- christ.

777
00:37:21,307 --> 00:37:23,809
I--

778
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,361
[chuckles]
i've got to go.

779
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,612
I'm an idiot.

780
00:37:26,646 --> 00:37:28,647
- debra.

781
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:40,993
- rita,
what are you doing here?

782
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:42,545
- you lied to me, dexter.

783
00:37:42,596 --> 00:37:44,797
I saw your car.
it wasn't a fender bender.

784
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:45,848
It was destroyed.

785
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:47,550
- i didn't want you to worry.

786
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:49,718
- yeah, well,
you're not doing a good job.

787
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,003
I'm worried sick about you.

788
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:54,173
- i'm fine.

789
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:56,341
All right, a little headache
and a stiff neck.

790
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:57,943
- get your stuff.
i'm gonna take you home.

791
00:37:57,978 --> 00:37:59,061
- i can't.

792
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,345
The lieutenant is holding
over the shift

793
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:04,150
Because of these murders
that are in all the papers.

794
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:05,818
- you fell asleep
at the wheel.

795
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:07,703
Almost got killed because
of the hours

796
00:38:07,737 --> 00:38:10,156
That they keep you here night
after night after night.

797
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,124
- so much for
my standard alibi.

798
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,659
This is a job
i signed on for.

799
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:15,044
- i'm sorry.

800
00:38:15,078 --> 00:38:16,462
I didn't sign on
to be a widow.

801
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:17,880
You know what?
i'll just talk to maria myself.

802
00:38:17,914 --> 00:38:19,665
- rita, no.
don't do this.

803
00:38:19,699 --> 00:38:21,667
Not here.
this is my job.

804
00:38:21,701 --> 00:38:24,553
It's how i support
all of us.

805
00:38:24,588 --> 00:38:27,590
- what if you wind up dead
in a ditch?

806
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:33,395
- all these people put in
the same hours that i do.

807
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:36,215
- yes, but you were
in the hospital last night.

808
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:37,349
They weren't.

809
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:40,986
- and the doctor gave me
a clean bill of health.

810
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:44,723
You could talk
to him yourself.

811
00:38:44,741 --> 00:38:48,661
[keypad tones]

812
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:50,579
- no.
no, i don't--

813
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:51,914
I don't want to talk
to your doctor.

814
00:38:51,948 --> 00:38:53,282
- i want you to.

815
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:55,417
- i mean, i guess he wouldn't
have released you

816
00:38:55,452 --> 00:38:58,337
If it was anything serious.

817
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:01,373
- i'm sure they'd all rather be
home with their families,

818
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:04,576
Just like me.

819
00:39:04,594 --> 00:39:06,245
- i know.

820
00:39:06,263 --> 00:39:09,248
- come on,
i'll walk you out.

821
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:17,422
[elevator bell dings]

822
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:25,064
[sighs]

823
00:39:33,156 --> 00:39:34,273
- you gonna pick that up?

824
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,991
- no, i am not, vince.

825
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:39,161
You got a problem with that?

826
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,446
- dude, seriously,
86 the caffeine.

827
00:39:41,464 --> 00:39:42,998
You're freaking me out.

828
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:45,000
- i have someplace
i need to be.

829
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,919
- i also have places
i need to be.

830
00:39:46,953 --> 00:39:52,591
Not good places,
but...places.

831
00:39:52,625 --> 00:39:53,893
- come on, blood.

832
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:57,646
Talk to me.

833
00:39:57,681 --> 00:40:00,632
If somebody tested positive
for an std,

834
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,303
Would they have to register with
the miami health authorities?

835
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:06,405
- and why would you
ask me that?

836
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,473
- yes or no, vince?

837
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:15,915
Lieutenant.

838
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,166
Found your guy.

839
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,817
Name's johnny rose.

840
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:19,985
- you found a suspect?

841
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,287
- all his info's in there.

842
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:23,622
- how?

843
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:25,991
- i reworked the blood sample
looking for other markers

844
00:40:26,009 --> 00:40:29,428
And found a street 14 strain
of drug-resistant syphilis.

845
00:40:29,462 --> 00:40:31,847
I checked that against
the std registry

846
00:40:31,881 --> 00:40:34,466
For anyone being treated
with heavy-duty meds

847
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,834
Over the last week.

848
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:38,503
Turned up a few prostitutes
and one johnny rose.

849
00:40:38,521 --> 00:40:40,272
Good science says
he's your guy.

850
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:42,674
- okay, briefing room
in five minutes.

851
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:44,193
Strategy meeting.

852
00:40:44,227 --> 00:40:49,031
Dexter's turned up a lead
on our shooter.

853
00:40:49,065 --> 00:40:50,682
- hey, dex, hold up.

854
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,152
- i need to be somewhere.
- good work back there.

855
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:54,987
This rose guy gets syphilis
and fingered for murder?

856
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:56,488
That's burning it
at both ends, huh?

857
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:58,907
- yeah, i really got to go.
wife, kids.

858
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,709
- come on, dex.

859
00:41:00,744 --> 00:41:02,211
What do say we grab
a beer this week,

860
00:41:02,245 --> 00:41:04,163
Figure out how to come
at benny gomez next?

861
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:05,464
- quinn!

862
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:07,049
I have a life.
you have a life.

863
00:41:07,083 --> 00:41:09,385
Just leave it alone.
all right?

864
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:11,387
[engine turns]

865
00:41:17,644 --> 00:41:19,261
Benny gomez.

866
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:20,479
The last place
i'm gonna look

867
00:41:20,513 --> 00:41:24,350
Is the last place
i saw you.

868
00:41:24,384 --> 00:41:28,187
- moment of your time,
lieutenant?

869
00:41:28,221 --> 00:41:32,391
<i>escuchame, maria.</i>

870
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:35,110
- angel...

871
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,746
People will think
something's up.

872
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:42,668
- something is.

873
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:44,169
- angel, if this is
about the mayor,

874
00:41:44,204 --> 00:41:45,421
I had no choice.

875
00:41:45,455 --> 00:41:48,374
- i'm not angry about you taking
me off the case.

876
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:49,574
It's how you did it.

877
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:53,712
<i>- angel, por favor.</i>

878
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:56,348
I don't even know how
to act around you anymore.

879
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:58,350
- this isn't easy
for me either.

880
00:42:03,139 --> 00:42:05,808
Maybe we need a...

881
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:08,644
Break.

882
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:11,596
- yeah, you're right.

883
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:16,151
It's probably for the best.

884
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:19,538
So that's that.

885
00:42:19,572 --> 00:42:22,875
- so that's that.

886
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:44,129
- so?

887
00:42:44,147 --> 00:42:48,300
- so.

888
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,270
Why are we thinking ourselves
out of a good thing?

889
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,614
- what do you think's
going on in there?

890
00:43:02,648 --> 00:43:03,648
- who cares.

891
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,650
[door opens]

892
00:43:10,123 --> 00:43:13,542
- i'm so glad you're home.

00:43:13,593 --> 00:43:14,993
- hey, it's not my birthday.

894
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,513
- can't a girlfriend be glad
her boyfriend's home?

895
00:43:17,547 --> 00:43:20,165
- i was gone for two days.

896
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:22,718
- i fucking love you.

897
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,853
- i love you.
- i love you.

898
00:43:24,888 --> 00:43:27,055
I love you.
- i love you.

899
00:43:34,347 --> 00:43:36,648
- back to square one.

900
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:39,952
Literally.

901
00:43:39,986 --> 00:43:45,240
[cell phone rings]

902
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,209
Yeah?

903
00:43:47,243 --> 00:43:49,528
- dexter.
frank lundy here.

904
00:43:49,546 --> 00:43:52,331
- the last person the world
i want to hear from.

905
00:43:52,365 --> 00:43:54,032
Glad to hear from you.

906
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:56,802
- i need to talk to you...

907
00:43:56,836 --> 00:43:58,837
About trinity.

908
00:44:03,977 --> 00:44:06,378
I'm tired
of swimming against

909
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:08,730
The bureaucratic tide
by myself.

910
00:44:08,765 --> 00:44:11,066
Can we maybe toss
a few ideas around?

911
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,402
You seem to have
the dot-connecting gift.

912
00:44:13,436 --> 00:44:14,886
<i>- more like had.</i>

913
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:16,405
[sighs]

914
00:44:16,439 --> 00:44:20,409
I'm glad to help,
but tonight's not really, um...

915
00:44:20,443 --> 00:44:21,410
Optimal.

916
00:44:21,444 --> 00:44:22,411
- i get it.

917
00:44:22,445 --> 00:44:23,579
New dad, new family.

918
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:25,897
Your life has changed
in so many ways.

919
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:28,450
- [chuckles]
yeah, i see that now.

920
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:30,836
- trinity is going
to kill again.

921
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,788
Soon.

922
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:33,872
Another woman.

923
00:44:33,906 --> 00:44:37,092
Older than lisa bell
this time.

924
00:44:37,126 --> 00:44:41,630
Somewhere out there is a woman
who is going to die...

925
00:44:41,681 --> 00:44:44,683
And she'll have
no idea why.

926
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:46,051
[dog whimpers]

927
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:47,519
- whoa, whoa!

928
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:49,188
Watch your step there.

929
00:44:49,222 --> 00:44:50,722
- oh, hey.

930
00:44:50,756 --> 00:44:52,941
How cute are you?

931
00:44:52,976 --> 00:44:55,777
[chuckles]
smell my puppy, don't you?

932
00:44:55,812 --> 00:44:56,812
What's his name?

933
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:57,946
- this is checkers.

934
00:44:57,981 --> 00:44:59,097
- [chuckles]

935
00:44:59,115 --> 00:45:01,116
- my mother was
a lifelong republican.

936
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:02,267
- well, no family's perfect.

937
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:05,037
- indeed.

938
00:45:05,071 --> 00:45:06,738
What kind of pup you have?

939
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:08,991
- um, just a mutt,
but she's great

940
00:45:09,042 --> 00:45:10,125
With my children.

941
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:11,543
- so you must live
around here, huh?

942
00:45:11,578 --> 00:45:12,961
- yeah, it's such
a great neighborhood.

943
00:45:12,996 --> 00:45:14,246
Everyone's so friendly.

944
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,297
- well, in the interest
of friendly,

945
00:45:15,331 --> 00:45:16,548
Let me help you with these.

946
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,217
- oh, it's really okay.
i'm just up there.

947
00:45:18,251 --> 00:45:20,385
- so i'll take one,
you take the other.

948
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,837
Lighten the load, huh?

949
00:45:21,888 --> 00:45:22,921
- i appreciate it.

950
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:24,172
My arms were falling off.

951
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:27,843
[chuckles]

952
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:29,895
- my dog won't get your puppy
all riled up?

953
00:45:29,929 --> 00:45:31,897
- molly?
oh, god, no.

954
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:34,516
She's the calmest little thing
in the world.

955
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:35,901
- how long have you lived
around here?

956
00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:37,636
- uh, three years next month.

957
00:45:37,654 --> 00:45:41,139
- oh, surprised we've never
run into each other till now.

958
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:43,075
I'm allen, by the way.

959
00:45:43,109 --> 00:45:44,109
- tarla.

960
00:45:44,143 --> 00:45:45,244
- tarla.

961
00:45:45,278 --> 00:45:46,778
- um, this is me.

962
00:45:46,812 --> 00:45:48,146
Thank you so much
for your help.

963
00:45:48,164 --> 00:45:49,648
- sure.

964
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:51,149
- great.

965
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:54,286
Oh, and bye to you too,
checkers.

966
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,321
- until next time.

967
00:46:11,638 --> 00:46:14,640
Off you go, checkers,
or whatever your name is.

968
00:46:18,861 --> 00:46:21,446
- lundy thinks he can
predict the future,

969
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:25,617
But i'm more interested
in the past.

970
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:29,321
My past.

971
00:46:29,355 --> 00:46:31,657
I already cleaned this.

972
00:46:31,691 --> 00:46:34,660
That i remember.

973
00:46:40,216 --> 00:46:42,968
Now it makes sense.

974
00:46:43,002 --> 00:46:46,004
Harry was reminding me
the whole time.

975
00:46:49,842 --> 00:46:52,844
I was reminding myself
the whole time.

976
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:13,248
Hello, benny.

977
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:15,283
Good-bye, benny.

978
00:47:37,306 --> 00:47:42,477
Got to admit...
pretty clever.

979
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:44,279
Hiding benny gomez
like that

980
00:47:44,313 --> 00:47:46,114
Until i could come back
and get him.

981
00:47:46,149 --> 00:47:48,617
- you turned to the code.

982
00:47:48,651 --> 00:47:52,454
A core memory.

983
00:47:52,488 --> 00:47:55,440
I taught you well.

984
00:47:55,458 --> 00:47:59,277
Finding gomez
was a band-aid.

985
00:47:59,295 --> 00:48:02,464
You're juggling family,
work...

986
00:48:02,498 --> 00:48:04,583
And a dark passenger
who's always got one hand

987
00:48:04,617 --> 00:48:06,885
On the steering wheel.

988
00:48:06,919 --> 00:48:09,888
- i can do it.

989
00:48:09,922 --> 00:48:13,141
I can manage...

990
00:48:13,176 --> 00:48:16,845
All these moving parts.

991
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:19,297
- until you can't.

992
00:48:19,315 --> 00:48:21,316
Then what?

993
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:28,473
- night, dad.

994
00:48:28,491 --> 00:48:30,609
Sleep.

995
00:48:30,643 --> 00:48:33,144
Just one beautiful
night's sleep

996
00:48:33,162 --> 00:48:38,450
Will make everything
better...again.

997
00:48:38,484 --> 00:48:40,485
[snoring]

998
00:48:47,293 --> 00:48:50,495
[harrison crying]

999
00:48:50,513 --> 00:49:06,611
Fuck.
