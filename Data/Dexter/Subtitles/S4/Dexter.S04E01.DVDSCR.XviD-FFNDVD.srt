00:01:57,094 --> 00:01:58,681
<i>Previously on </i>Dexter...

2
00:01:58,806 --> 00:02:00,620
It's for sure. I'm pregnant.

3
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:05,750
<i>What kind of father would I be?
After all, I kill people.</i>

4
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,586
<i>Me?</i>

5
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:10,922
<i>Demented daddy Dexter.</i>

6
00:02:12,297 --> 00:02:13,799
This child is happening.

7
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,690
But your role in its life
is entirely up to you.

8
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:20,160
Yesterday morning you said,
"When the case ends, we end."

9
00:02:20,285 --> 00:02:22,254
I thought you understood
when we got involved.

10
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:24,085
I track killers, that's what I do.

11
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,187
A pattern of bodies
was identified in Oregon.

12
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,159
- My flight leaves tonight.
- We gotta work out logistics.

13
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,692
Do you honestly
want to go down this path?

14
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,528
I don't know
if I'm gonna be a father.

15
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,906
How could you even say
you're not gonna be a father?

16
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:39,450
I mean, where would
you be without Harry?

17
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:42,863
<i>Harry knew my mother.
Laura Moser was his informant.</i>

18
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:44,497
<i>Was he just using her?</i>

19
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,160
<i>Was he using me?</i>

20
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,292
Dad wasn't perfect, Deb.

21
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,211
What did he do?
Cheat on mom?

22
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:51,865
Bullshit! Who?

23
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:55,313
I need all the records you have
on my dad's confidential informants.

24
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:58,803
- Attractive female CIs.
- Why? You know something?

25
00:02:59,081 --> 00:03:01,347
There's a good reason
why Quinn's of interest to IA.

26
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,475
Internal Affairs is investigating you.
There's something you're not telling us?

27
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,871
- Anton's not officially a CI.
- What do you mean?

28
00:03:06,996 --> 00:03:08,771
I never filed
an arrest report on him.

29
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,232
You are the best thing
that has happened to me.

30
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:15,569
Just sending out my positive
intentions to our baby.

31
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,489
You know, we're connected.
You're what makes me real.

32
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:20,783
Please, say yes.

33
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:22,601
Yes, we will marry you.

34
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:25,371
Syl has offered to list my house,

35
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,498
so we can buy something bigger.

36
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,127
Better hope she doesn't insist
on a place with central air.

37
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,421
I was actually thinking
I might keep my place.

38
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,673
"No" doesn't really work
in a relationship, Dexter.

39
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,509
Every man needs his privacy.
Some more than others.

40
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,870
<i>Is it possible
I had actually made a friend?</i>

41
00:03:41,995 --> 00:03:44,036
<i>Someone I can trust
with my dark secrets?</i>

42
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:46,892
I didn't teach you the code
to share with your buddies.

43
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,313
<i>Miguel really did it.
And I taught him how.</i>

44
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,773
<i>Harry was right.
He used me.</i>

45
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,901
You're all just
unchecked versions of myself,

46
00:03:56,555 --> 00:03:58,613
what I would have become
without my father's code.

47
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,409
I could kill you now.

48
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:05,210
I've never felt this.

49
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:08,331
You've never had a son before.
You want to see him come into the world.

50
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,542
I never wanted anything
so much in my life.

51
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,632
<i>I have moved on from my father.</i>

52
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:19,759
<i>But I still need his code.</i>

53
00:04:20,206 --> 00:04:22,011
<i>But right now, life is good.</i>

54
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,181
<i>Dexter Morgan, family man.</i>

00:04:50,172 --> 00:04:51,672
<i>Tonight's the night.</i>

57
00:04:55,723 --> 00:04:59,162
<i>The night when a primal,
sacred need calls to me.</i>

58
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,629
<i>I've waited</i>

59
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:02,593
<i>and waited,</i>

60
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,861

<i>it's time.</i>

<i>Tonight's the night I finally...</i>

64
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:42,552
<i>sleep.</i>

65
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,639
Oh my God! No!

66
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:50,118
Okay, Harrison.

67
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:53,283
The driving thing didn't work.
The singing thing didn't work.

68
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:56,475
You planning on both of us
not sleeping for another three months?

69
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:00,447
Apparently so.

70
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:05,660
Okay, I want to take you inside,
but I don't want you waking mommy.

71
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:12,728
If you could talk you'd tell me
not to worry about you, right?

72
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:19,811
Please!

73
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,291
Please!

74
00:07:36,522 --> 00:07:37,922
It's already over.

75
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:00,972
Marco?

76
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:02,097
Polo!

77
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:03,417
Marco?

78
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:05,312
Polo!

79
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:10,792
<i>There's this cliché where serial
killers are always described</i>

80
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:13,427
<i>as quiet, kept to themselves,
kind of a loner.</i>

81
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,368
<i>And it's a cliché for a reason.</i>

82
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:22,320
Has anybody seen my keys?

83
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,772
Astor, I asked you to keep it down.

84
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:29,264
Why do you hate my music so much?

85
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:30,998
I don't hate your music.

86
00:09:31,123 --> 00:09:32,123
You don't?

87
00:09:32,674 --> 00:09:35,616
Cody, get out of the Larsons' pool.
It's time for school!

88
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,329
If I had an iPod, you wouldn't
have to listen to my stuff.

89
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:40,256
You want an iPod, earn one.

90
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:43,165
- Do your chores. Unpack your room.
- God, you're so unfair!

91
00:09:48,752 --> 00:09:50,352
Did you get any sleep?

92
00:09:50,477 --> 00:09:51,924
An hour and a half, maybe.

93
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:55,595
And you have court. Look,
I appreciate you taking the night shift,

94
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:58,389
but when you have a big day like today,
it's okay to wake me up.

95
00:09:59,131 --> 00:10:01,559
Well, it's kinda
on-the-job training, you know.

96
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:04,768
All that matters
is his father's there for him.

97
00:10:04,893 --> 00:10:07,093
- I cannot find keys.
- Cody!

98
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:09,509
Astor, the music!

99
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,986
- You usually leave them by the phone.
- I know.

100
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:15,906
- School. Clothes. Now.
- Sorry.

101
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,645
You don't get some sleep,
it won't be your keys that get lost.

102
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,220
It'll be your mind.

103
00:10:23,726 --> 00:10:25,326
I lost that years ago.

104
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,848
<i>Dexter Morgan,</i>

105
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,991
<i>good suburban husband</i>

106
00:10:43,116 --> 00:10:44,816
<i>Happy father of three.</i>

107
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:47,271
<i>On paper, anyway.</i>

108
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,079
Hey, Dex! What's the news?

109
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:52,818
Too soon to tell.

110
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,002
Dex, you forgot your cellphone.

111
00:10:58,546 --> 00:11:00,000
Good morning, Elliot!

112
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:03,256
Another beautiful day.
More pool time for the kids.

113
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:06,207
You already took the morning shift,
so I'll watch them this afternoon.

114
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:08,483
Takes a village.

115
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,831
Carpools and swimming pools...

116
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:23,515
How much are we living the dream?

117
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,490
So much.

118
00:11:28,414 --> 00:11:29,939
<i>Living the dream...</i>

119
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:42,243
Do you think you can TiVo
Jon Stewart for me?

120
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,476
You're thinking about Jon Stewart?

121
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,815
Well, he is handsome

122
00:11:52,928 --> 00:11:53,928
and funny.

123
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:55,673
I love you.

124
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:03,598
Oh, fuck me.

125
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,065
Well, that's kinda
where this is heading.

126
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:07,602
No, I'm late for work.

127
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:17,987
It's a good thing you moved in,
or I'd never see you.

128
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,387
One of us has to live here.

129
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:23,034
At least with the cruise ship
I get to see you every few days.

130
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,120
- I went on tour.
- I know.

131
00:12:26,383 --> 00:12:29,206
It's okay, I kinda like it.
Keeps you from getting sick of me.

132
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:32,919
- That's never gonna happen.
- Yeah, because you're never here.

133
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:36,145
No, because you make me happy.

134
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,722
And what conclusions did you draw
from the blood evidence, Mr. Morgan?

135
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:48,476
I was able to determine
the victim's movement and direction...

136
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,394
after the initial blunt force trauma

137
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:53,147
to the head
caused by the defendant's fist.

138
00:12:54,283 --> 00:12:56,051
- How so?
- I...

139
00:12:57,029 --> 00:12:58,329
reconstructed...

140
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:03,491
timeline and sequence of events
by examining...

141
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,038
It's here somewhere.

142
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:09,372
I noticed a passive
flow pattern bloodstain,

143
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,613
approximately two meters in length,
emanating from the head wound,

144
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:17,505
and the sample was consistent with
the sample from the defendant's shirt.

145
00:13:19,227 --> 00:13:21,676
You did say
"passive flow pattern bloodstain"?

146
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:23,761
Quote, unquote.

147
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,346
What exactly do your notes say?

148
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:31,746
"The bloodstain described
a passive pooling

149
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:34,371
"and flow configuration
type 0-negative,

150
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:37,233
"matching the sample taken from...

151
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:41,709
"Leonetti's

152
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:43,887
"shirt."

153
00:13:46,051 --> 00:13:47,410
But this is the Gomez hearing.

154
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,539
Yes, Mr. Morgan.
The defendant's name is Benito Gomez.

155
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:54,582
I must have brought the wrong notes.

156
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:56,751
Do you frequently become
confused and disoriented

157
00:13:56,876 --> 00:13:59,107
when conducting your spatter
analysis, Mr. Morgan?

158
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:00,362
No, I do not.

159
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:04,343
We just had a new baby. Things were
a little hectic this morning.

160
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:07,054
So you're sleep-deprived
and it's affecting your judgment?

161
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,322
No, it's just a momentary mix-up.

162
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,309
Wrong notes, wrong blood type,

163
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:13,728
wrong defendant, wrong case...

164
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,982
That's what you call a momentary mix-up
in a murder trial?

165
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,107
I misspoke.

166
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:23,416
The witness has just demonstrated
how unreliable he is in a courtroom.

167
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,324
I would have to ask how reliable
his work is in the lab.

168
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,673
Or on a crime scene.

169
00:14:27,798 --> 00:14:30,410
Moreover, how reliable
is a police department,

170
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:33,655
that they would place so much trust
in his expert opinion.

171
00:14:42,142 --> 00:14:44,342
I'm halfway through
the CI files you gave me.

172
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:45,995
If I were you,

173
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,298
I'd spend more time
with that man of yours

174
00:14:48,423 --> 00:14:50,932
and less time looking
for some old confidential informant

175
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,059
your daddy might've diddled
back in the day.

176
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:55,519
I meet another one tomorrow.

177
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,497
Maybe then I'll finally
get some answers.

178
00:14:58,622 --> 00:14:59,815
Say you do.

179
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,067
Then what?

180
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,118
Then...

181
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:05,151
I'll know.

182
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:09,361
That my perfect fucking father
wasn't so fucking perfect.

183
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:11,661
So that's what, the meaning of life?

184
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,393
The meaning of my life.

185
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:20,620
Hey, buddy.

186
00:15:21,937 --> 00:15:23,696
Guess where I was yesterday.

187
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,831
I'm not sure...

188
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:28,219
I was at a store.
Wanna take guess what kind of store?

189
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,031
- I don't know. Grocery?
- Clothing.

190
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:34,642
You know me, I'm pretty into that shit.
Gotta come correct. But not yesterday.

191
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:37,019
- If this is about...
- Come on, buddy. Let me finish.

192
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,629
I was at a store helping a lady
to pick out a suit for her son.

193
00:15:39,754 --> 00:15:40,662
Know why?

194
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:43,575
'Cause he had to be in court.
See the guy who killed his old man.

195
00:15:43,986 --> 00:15:46,821
Kid's first fucking suit.
Something a father should be doing.

196
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,489
- Sorry.
- Little late for sorry.

197
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:51,659
- That asshole you let walk?
- Benito Gomez.

198
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:53,911
Now you get it right.

199
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:56,038
You actually see
what that fuckhead did?

200
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,845
Gomez hit the kid's old man so hard,
his cheekbone broke,

201
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,346
pushing his eyeball
up and out of his face.

202
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:05,284
Then Gomez, sweetheart that he is,
kills the guy in front of his own son.

203
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:06,799
- I know.
- And this beauty?

204
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,017
Gomez did 5 years
for beating his girlfriend so bad

205
00:16:09,142 --> 00:16:11,019
even her dentist
had a hard time with the ID.

206
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,702
So is your "Sorry" gonna keep Gomez
from pounding somebody else

207
00:16:13,827 --> 00:16:15,868
- into the next world?
- Jesus, chill out, Quinn!

208
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,624
No, Deb, he's right.

209
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,479
I screwed up in court today.
Gomez walked. This one's on me.

210
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:23,596
Thanks. That means so much to me.
Why don't you hold onto those for me?

211
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,395
I'm sick of looking at them.

212
00:16:26,128 --> 00:16:27,153
You screwed up?

213
00:16:27,888 --> 00:16:28,889
Big time.

214
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,465
Should I be worried?

215
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:34,602
No, I'll be okay.

216
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:39,630
<i>Maybe it's Benny Gomez
who should be worried.</i>

217
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:43,044
And good solve
on the Reynolds case, guys.

218
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,295
Next up,

219
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,986
chief's office wants...

220
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,300
Anything I can do to keep that Irish
off your ass, let me know.

221
00:16:50,127 --> 00:16:51,872
You're a real friend, Vince.

222
00:16:53,924 --> 00:16:55,331
<i>Quinn is a good cop.</i>

223
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:56,855
<i>I need a good kill.</i>

224
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,985
<i>And sometimes
one just falls into your lap.</i>

225
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:08,110
We've got a body in Kendall.
Morgan, Quinn, you're up.

226
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,571
And Dexter. There's blood.
Lots of blood.

227
00:17:19,896 --> 00:17:21,580
Talk about your blood bath.

228
00:17:25,074 --> 00:17:26,078
Tough room.

229
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,257
Femoral artery severed.
She bled out in minutes.

230
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:31,550
- Suicide?
- No weapon on the premises.

231
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:33,922
Exactly. The coroner can suck
my uncircumcised dick

232
00:17:34,047 --> 00:17:37,065
- if he doesn't rule this as a homicide.
- That's way TMI, Masuka.

233
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:40,441
Employment records show
she just got promoted to sous-chef.

234
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:44,063
A total babe, and she could cook.
Had it all going on.

235
00:17:44,702 --> 00:17:45,704
Then this.

236
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:49,277
It's a very well-organized crime scene.
The assailant took his time,

237
00:17:51,686 --> 00:17:53,615
cleaned up after himself.

238
00:17:53,964 --> 00:17:55,852
<i>Obviously doesn't have kids.</i>

239
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:57,576
Keep an eye on our expert witness.

240
00:17:58,199 --> 00:18:01,914
In case our girl's parents want to see
someone go to jail for doing this.

241
00:18:05,593 --> 00:18:06,593
Harsh.

242
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:15,511
Christine Hill,
<i>Broward Journal Dispatch.</i>

243
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:16,896
And?

244
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:19,390
And was Miss Bell the only victim?

245
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:22,213
Who gave you her name?

246
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:24,895
I searched the address
on this thing called the Internet.

247
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:28,482
What can you tell me
about the murder? Suspects?

248
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:30,466
Murder? Suspects?

249
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:32,445
We still haven't officially
ruled out suicide.

250
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:34,238
So it was pills?

251
00:18:37,187 --> 00:18:38,284
Then she bled out.

252
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,815
Women pretty much
only do one or the other.

253
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,164
You break this case before we do,
give me a call.

254
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,036
It's Detective Joseph Quinn.

255
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,176
Miami-Metro, extension 3734.

256
00:18:54,188 --> 00:18:55,343
Cell number?

257
00:18:56,214 --> 00:18:57,578
Nice touch, Joseph.

258
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:13,643
Damn it!

259
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,649
Can't anyone fill up the...

260
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,491
fucking water thing?

261
00:19:21,055 --> 00:19:22,662
- Tough crime scene?
- No.

262
00:19:25,376 --> 00:19:26,376
Kind of.

263
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:33,092
When things are going good,

264
00:19:33,217 --> 00:19:35,315
that's God's way of saying
to cover your ass,

265
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,802
because something's gonna jump up
and bite it, hard.

266
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:39,804
Well put.

267
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:43,432
- You and Anton are doing okay?
- Knock on wood.

268
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,101
Any sign your ass is gonna get bit?

269
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,019
None.

270
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:50,231
- So this is you making yourself crazy?
- That's kind of what I do.

271
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:53,985
What?

272
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,445
It's just I've taken that trip
a thousand times before.

273
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:58,823
- And?
- And knock it off.

274
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,075
Is that an order, boss?

275
00:20:02,891 --> 00:20:05,454
Just some free advice
from someone who's been there before.

276
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,857
Did you ever go out with that guy
that Anton wanted you to meet?

277
00:20:11,663 --> 00:20:13,813
Musicians aren't really my thing.

278
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:15,512
He owns a restaurant.

279
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:17,924
Three of them.
Cuban restaurants.

280
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:20,671
What the fuck is wrong
with musicians?

281
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:22,456
That came out wrong.

282
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:24,951
What makes you think
a Cuban restaurant matters?

283
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,768
That came out wrong too.

284
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,315
I'm not looking for anyone new anyway.
But when and if,

285
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:34,609
I'll let you know.

286
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:36,905
Thanks.

287
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,429
<i>Finally, peace and quiet.</i>

288
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:51,280
<i>No crying baby.</i>

289
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:53,753
<i>No Marco, no Polo.</i>

290
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:55,706
<i>Just me...</i>

291
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,757
<i>and blood.</i>

292
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,686
<i>And Mr. Benito Gomez.</i>

293
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:13,721
<i>Where to find
a washed-up boxer like you?</i>

294
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,694
<i>Trailer Park. Great.</i>

295
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,067
<i>Kids, neighbours.</i>

296
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:21,900
<i>More kids.</i>

297
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:23,616
<i>Sounds like my world.</i>

298
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,031
<i>But this...</i>

299
00:21:32,362 --> 00:21:35,920
<i>the only still open for business
establishment in a lonely strip mall.</i>

300
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:38,075
<i>That's kind of calling to me.</i>

301
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:40,416
<i>This feels good.</i>

302
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:45,930
Hey, you.

303
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,848
Hey, Dex. You're alone?

304
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,183
Yeah, why?

305
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,060
Harrison won't go down for his nap.

306
00:21:51,565 --> 00:21:52,895
Surprise, surprise.

307
00:21:53,808 --> 00:21:55,398
Maybe you could sing to him?

308
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:57,464
You bet.

309
00:21:59,035 --> 00:22:00,780
I will gonna put you on speaker.

310
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:08,311
<i>Oh beautiful for spacious skies</i>

311
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:11,927
<i>For amber waves of grain</i>

312
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:17,128
<i>For purple mountain majesty</i>

313
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,424
<i>Above the fruited plain!</i>

314
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:27,879
<i>America! America! God...</i>

315
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,021
He's finally calming.

316
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,811
Thank you, Dexter.
We love you.

317
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:35,885
Me too.

318
00:22:37,277 --> 00:22:39,902
<i>First up today
finish the Lisa Bell blood work.</i>

319
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,117
<i>Tonight, a little Benny Gomez recon.</i>

320
00:22:42,242 --> 00:22:46,538
<i>Then go home and sing the last 95 verses
of</i> America, the Beautiful <i>to my son.</i>

321
00:22:47,782 --> 00:22:49,732
<i>Who knew life could get so...</i>

322
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:50,970
<i>unsimple?</i>

323
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,092
I can deal. I can deal.

324
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:09,170
- Boobs plus drinks equals...
- Titty bar. Can't. Got a date.

325
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,371
How about you, Morgan?
Stud muffin still out of town?

326
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,117
It's tempting, Masuka.
And elegant.

327
00:23:17,342 --> 00:23:19,315
Fuck off and die.
Then die again.

328
00:23:19,542 --> 00:23:20,703
So that's a no.

329
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:23,878
- I'm feeling no love here, folks.
- Then it's working.

330
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,921
Hey, slacker! Half day?

331
00:23:26,395 --> 00:23:28,449
This is me leaving, Vince.
I do it every day.

332
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,635
Every day wasn't like today.
What you went through?

333
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,495
Drinks are on me.
It'll cheer you up!

334
00:23:32,941 --> 00:23:34,641
I'm not uncheered.

335
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,248
Tell that to your face!

336
00:23:36,977 --> 00:23:39,394
- I'm going home to my family.
- Vastly overrated.

337
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,917
Just got a call from robbery.

338
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:43,239
Some guy on his honeymoon
took a shot in the head.

339
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:45,721
Grave condition.
They're pulling the plug tomorrow.

340
00:23:45,846 --> 00:23:47,481
Nice fucking wedding gift.

341
00:23:47,941 --> 00:23:50,656
Yeah, the file is gonna land on my desk
first thing in the morning.

342
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:52,330
And robbery's got squat.

343
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:54,163
It's gonna be a total goatfuck.

344
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,018
It sounds like you need
a drink, <i>papi</i>.

345
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,535
You know what, Vince?
I can use a <i>Cuervo</i>. Or ten.

346
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:31,326
<i>My dark passenger is like
a trapped coal miner, always tapping,</i>

347
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,056
<i>always letting me know
it's still in there, still alive.</i>

348
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:39,746
<i>Quinn's legwork may have shown me
where to find our friend,</i>

349
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,797
<i>but this, Benny...</i>

350
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:45,192
<i>My bloodwork is the stuff
that seals your fate.</i>

351
00:24:57,915 --> 00:25:01,919
No security cameras.
Parks away from the lights.

352
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,132
You just come and go as you please.

353
00:25:07,937 --> 00:25:09,342
But as of tomorrow night,

354
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:11,548
those days are over.

355
00:25:21,282 --> 00:25:23,532
I wasn't sure
you'd actually come by.

356
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,701
Put in my face time with Masuka.

357
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:31,405
And then I came
to where I really wanted to be.

358
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,081
Tell me again this isn't crazy.

359
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,186
Yeah, it's crazy.

360
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,754
Crazy good.

361
00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:05,938
Keep shooting.

362
00:26:06,243 --> 00:26:08,067
He's so sweet, when he's sleeping.

363
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:13,552
We were all like that, once.

364
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:15,491
Pure and innocent.

365
00:26:16,513 --> 00:26:18,593
But then we grow up,

366
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:21,143
things happen.

367
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,864
Nothing's gonna happen.

368
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,371
Not when he has a great dad
watching over him.

369
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,617
Yeah, he's a lucky guy.

370
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,268
- Mom!
- Turn that down!

371
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:44,186
We wouldn't have this problem,
if you...

372
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,728
This is not how you go
about getting an iPod.

373
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:50,693
Since you woke your brother up, you can
walk him around until he falls asleep.

374
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:53,112
- But he never sleeps!
- Think about that next time.

375
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:00,094
There we go.

376
00:27:01,914 --> 00:27:04,964
You'd like an iPod,
wouldn't you, little Harrison?

377
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:10,105
Why not just end the terror
and give her an iPod?

378
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:11,923
No, it's a power play.

379
00:27:12,091 --> 00:27:14,728
She's trying to manipulate us
to get what she wants.

380
00:27:14,853 --> 00:27:16,052
Not in this family.

381
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,428
Oh, right.

382
00:27:17,825 --> 00:27:18,888
Of course.

383
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:22,642
Cody?
No more Marco Polo in the mornings.

384
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:25,144
- But it's important!
- So is being ready for school.

385
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:27,897
When I grow up
I wanna be just like you.

386
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:30,274
Do what I want, when I want.

387
00:27:30,556 --> 00:27:31,856
<i>You and me both.</i>

388
00:27:32,061 --> 00:27:33,444
I wanna be just like you.

389
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:52,274
Great time last night, Angel?

390
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:58,135
What? You could've totally fucked
that stripper.

391
00:28:04,794 --> 00:28:06,444
Get to work, gentlemen.

392
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:10,203
What got into her?

393
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:31,014
What is this? <i>Extreme Home Makeover:
Forensics Edition</i>?

394
00:28:31,139 --> 00:28:34,338
The first pass through, I found blood
that didn't belong to the victim.

395
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,340
Possible DNA from the Killer?

396
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:38,467
Don't think so.
The sample was pretty degraded.

397
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:41,804
- Then what's the source?
- Not sure... yet.

398
00:28:42,072 --> 00:28:44,389
Coming from you,
why does that not surprise me?

399
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,142
You know he's my brother?

400
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,102
Found something.
Mr. Morgan.

401
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:53,399
It's blood.

402
00:28:56,935 --> 00:28:59,545
Pool pattern, not incidental spatter
from the recent murder.

403
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,991
- This is something else entirely.
- Where is it from?

404
00:29:04,787 --> 00:29:05,787
Bathtub.

405
00:29:06,672 --> 00:29:09,909
So, you're taking an already
extremely difficult case

406
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:12,168
and polluting it
with your, what, theories?

407
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,921
- I didn't put the blood there.
- Neither did our killer.

408
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,158
Joey, why don't we step outside,
let the geeks get their geek on?

409
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,457
I gotta be somewhere,
so see if you can hold things down

410
00:29:22,582 --> 00:29:24,847
without going all asshole
on my brother, okay?

411
00:29:40,202 --> 00:29:42,448
<i>Blood tells. Blood always tells.</i>

412
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:55,670
How is my favorite
blood spatter analyst?

413
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:57,630
Great.

414
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,882
How is my favorite
serial killer hunter?

415
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:04,011
- You just missed Deb.
- Actually, I'm here to see you.

416
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,559
Database has
a girl killed here recently.

417
00:30:09,684 --> 00:30:11,537
Severed femoral artery?

418
00:30:12,413 --> 00:30:13,479
Pretty brutal.

419
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,025
Crime scene telling you anything?

420
00:30:19,035 --> 00:30:19,944
Not much.

421
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:25,533
Killer was careful, right?
Immaculate.

422
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:26,668
Very.

423
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,498
You're in the middle of something here.
I don't want to interrupt.

424
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,171
Mind if I drop by the station later?

425
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,754
Sure, not a problem.

426
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:42,967
Good seeing you again, Dexter.

427
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:49,551
<i>Shit!</i>

428
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:09,452
Hello, detective.

429
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,525
Won't you come in?

430
00:31:12,902 --> 00:31:15,012
I'm here to talk about Harry Morgan.

431
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,534
I'm his daughter, Debra.

432
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:19,665
Debra Morgan.

433
00:31:22,907 --> 00:31:25,509
Handsome Harry Morgan.
How is he?

434
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:28,429
He died a while back.

435
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:33,643
Life does tend to suck.

436
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:36,972
Did you and my father have...

437
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:41,817
a good relationship?

438
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,590
No.

439
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:49,868
Your father was a driven man.

440
00:31:50,555 --> 00:31:53,204
He saw something he wanted,
nothing got in his way.

441
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,345
You're talking about women?

442
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:59,100
Women. Bad guys. Anything.

443
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:01,906
Anyone.

444
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:07,498
Harry always said, the only word
that wasn't in his vocabulary was "No".

445
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:10,899
Did you say no to him?

446
00:32:12,911 --> 00:32:13,961
I said yes.

447
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:17,384
All the time.

448
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,400
Shit.

449
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:21,756
Hundreds of times.

450
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:25,942
Only problem was...

451
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,200
Only problem was what?

452
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,748
I was saying yes to a question
he never asked.

453
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:41,961
So you didn't have an affair
with my father?

454
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,020
I don't know who you're looking for,
honey, but it ain't me.

455
00:32:57,807 --> 00:32:59,895
<i>Shut down for decades.
Way out of town.</i>

456
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:01,973
I'm liking this.

457
00:33:03,137 --> 00:33:05,806
<i>Broken-down boxer.
Broken-down arena.</i>

458
00:33:06,506 --> 00:33:10,406
<i>A fitting place for a punk like
Benny Gomez to go down for the count.</i>

459
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:19,389
Where you been?

460
00:33:21,194 --> 00:33:23,544
- Looking for misery.
- No upside to that.

461
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,046
So I'm fucking learning.

462
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:29,008
That's all we got on the groom.
Plug was pulled 4:45 this morning.

463
00:33:29,932 --> 00:33:31,317
It's all yours.

464
00:33:32,576 --> 00:33:35,226
A man's life and death,
reduced to a few...

465
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,199
- What do you call them?
- Bytes.

466
00:33:37,324 --> 00:33:38,726
A few bytes. Just like that.

467
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:41,854
This economy. Last thing
our city needs is dead tourists.

468
00:33:42,263 --> 00:33:43,356
"Welcome to Miami.

469
00:33:43,668 --> 00:33:44,774
"Have a nice day."

470
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:46,901
Is that our tourist?

471
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:47,795
It is.

472
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,084
The mayor's already given me
an aneurysm over this one,

473
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:51,697
so make it a quick solve.

474
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:59,080
So, whatever happened between you
and that Barbara Gianna from vice?

475
00:33:59,883 --> 00:34:00,983
We broke up.

476
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,020
Wanted different things.

477
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:05,816
Office romances.
Doom before they fucking start.

478
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:07,445
Do you mind if I ask her out?

479
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,704
Knock yourself out.

480
00:34:31,637 --> 00:34:34,686
<i>The perfect husband would've
gotten rid of his old apartment.</i>

481
00:34:34,881 --> 00:34:37,952
<i>But I kill people.
Not exactly the perfect husband.</i>

482
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,169
Someone new is moving in.

483
00:34:48,922 --> 00:34:49,922
Be nice.

484
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,269
<i>The land that time</i>

485
00:35:41,394 --> 00:35:43,595
<i>and Florida Electric forgot.</i>

486
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:00,733
<i>Look at this place!</i>

487
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:04,461
<i>All the cheering,
all the triumph, all the blood.</i>

488
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:07,041
<i>All for sport.</i>

489
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:09,994
<i>Until tonight.</i>

490
00:36:48,143 --> 00:36:51,143
<i>Keep at it, Benny,
and you'll be feeling no pain.</i>

491
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,747
<i>Better that way.</i>

492
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:21,781
Tell me you got a reason
for sleeping alone in your car

493
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,701
outside a bar
other than you're drunk.

494
00:37:25,227 --> 00:37:26,261
I'm tired.

495
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:29,162
License and registration, please.

496
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,874
Sorry about this, officer.
This is not what it looks like.

497
00:37:41,985 --> 00:37:44,221
- You're with homicide?
- Yes, sir.

498
00:37:44,567 --> 00:37:47,211
Then you ought to know better.
Get out of the car, please.

499
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:54,649
You know your ABC?

500
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:58,152
- Of course I do.
- Give me 'em backwards.

501
00:38:11,875 --> 00:38:14,710
Shut up already. You're not drunk...

502
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:15,878
yet.

503
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:21,092
<i>Damn it, Benny.</i>

504
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:24,095
<i>I can't go chasing after you
with a cop up my ass.</i>

505
00:38:25,339 --> 00:38:28,289
You got more important
places to be, Mr. Morgan.

506
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:32,251
Tell me about it.

507
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:44,851
I thought you were working late.

508
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:46,492
So did I.

509
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:49,698
Baby's down.

510
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:51,837
You know what that means?

511
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:54,375
- Sleep.
- Sex!

512
00:38:56,779 --> 00:39:00,777
And I'm not talking the rushed,
frantic, the-kids-are-asleep sex.

513
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:02,758
But slow, hot,

514
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,243
steamy, naughty sex.

515
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:06,268
Look, if you're too tired...

516
00:39:11,931 --> 00:39:14,807
Ever since the move and the baby,

517
00:39:14,932 --> 00:39:16,909
we've had, like, zero time together.

518
00:39:17,785 --> 00:39:19,985
I mean, aren't you as horny as I am?

519
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:22,862
'Course I am.

520
00:39:25,038 --> 00:39:26,998
All right. Well, just...

521
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:28,709
close your eyes.

522
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,454
<i>Maybe I can squeeze in a power nap.</i>

523
00:39:35,071 --> 00:39:36,083
Okay, open.

524
00:39:40,204 --> 00:39:41,204
<i>Or not.</i>

525
00:39:41,329 --> 00:39:44,550
I was saving these for when we finally
got some real time alone.

526
00:39:46,111 --> 00:39:46,969
And...

527
00:39:50,834 --> 00:39:53,305
And tonight's the night.

528
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,617
It's alright. I'll go.

529
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,897
You've already done so much.

530
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:20,661
Look at that.

531
00:40:25,853 --> 00:40:28,996
Yeah, who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

532
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,160
Wanna know a secret?

533
00:40:45,104 --> 00:40:46,554
Daddy kills people.

534
00:40:50,221 --> 00:40:51,571
Well, bad people.

535
00:40:54,377 --> 00:40:57,727
Not really anybody else
I can tell about that, you know?

536
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:08,242
Daddy's not going anywhere, buddy.

537
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:16,066
I've already lost my innocence.
I'm not going to sacrifice yours too.

538
00:41:29,448 --> 00:41:31,157
Triple Red-Eye, please.

539
00:41:31,428 --> 00:41:33,834
That's your third one today, bro.
You don't cut back,

540
00:41:33,959 --> 00:41:36,136
and you're tempting the heart gods.

541
00:41:36,261 --> 00:41:37,761
Least of my worries.

542
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Bro.

543
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:41,834
Brought you a copy of my article.

544
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,195
Figured you're a dumb cop
and don't read the paper.

545
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,005
I never miss the obituaries.

546
00:41:46,894 --> 00:41:49,884
- Front page. Nice.
- Yeah, I do what I can.

547
00:41:50,189 --> 00:41:52,386
My editor okayed a follow-up.
You got anything for me?

548
00:41:52,822 --> 00:41:54,713
I would if I could,
but I got nothing.

549
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:57,938
Besides, off the record,
we got bigger fish to fry.

550
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,186
What kind of fish?

551
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,026
Off the record.

552
00:42:04,136 --> 00:42:06,267
You know those pricks
who've been shaking down tourists?

553
00:42:06,392 --> 00:42:08,736
- The vacation robbers?
- No, the vacation murderers.

554
00:42:09,297 --> 00:42:12,073
They shot some poor newly wed.
Didn't make it, so

555
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:14,617
we're more than a little distracted.

556
00:42:16,272 --> 00:42:19,080
You want another distraction?
I'd love to take you out for a drink.

557
00:42:19,835 --> 00:42:21,540
You know, to thank you

558
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:24,126
for your help
with the bathtub story.

559
00:42:27,708 --> 00:42:29,889
- I'm so not hitting on you.
- Yeah, me neither.

560
00:42:30,014 --> 00:42:31,133
Let's make it dinner.

561
00:42:37,191 --> 00:42:39,312
I've got the blood work back
from our bathroom do-over.

562
00:42:39,437 --> 00:42:41,337
- You ran it through the database?
- No point.

563
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:43,575
The blood you swabbed
showed shit-all on the DNA front.

564
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,986
Our chances of finding out
who it belongs to are about

565
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,942
one in six fucking billion?

566
00:42:49,923 --> 00:42:51,873
What was Lisa Bell's address?

567
00:42:53,144 --> 00:42:54,907
1578 Glencoe, why?

568
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,697
If the DNA won't tell us
who it belonged to,

569
00:42:58,822 --> 00:43:00,129
maybe the address will.

570
00:43:01,033 --> 00:43:02,331
1578 Glencoe.

571
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:05,209
April 11, 1979. Homicide.

572
00:43:05,551 --> 00:43:06,919
1979?

573
00:43:11,026 --> 00:43:15,150
Vicky Noonan, 22.
Found in the bath tub.

574
00:43:15,275 --> 00:43:17,638
Bled out.
Incision to her thigh.

575
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:20,360
What are the chances of that?

576
00:43:20,485 --> 00:43:22,435
What are the chances of what?

577
00:43:23,477 --> 00:43:24,977
Special agent Lundy.

578
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,981
Vincent Masuka, if memory serves.

579
00:43:28,714 --> 00:43:29,864
That's right.

580
00:43:30,398 --> 00:43:31,402
LFI on the PHB.

581
00:43:33,618 --> 00:43:35,704
You're working a case, right?
Feds need us to...

582
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:37,491
Mind if I speak with Dexter?

583
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:43,751
Well, I go to records
and get the write-up on Noonan.

584
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,814
Just doing my job.

585
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:53,633
He's right.

586
00:43:54,605 --> 00:43:55,301
About?

587
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:56,976
Why I'm in Miami.

588
00:43:57,398 --> 00:43:58,387
It is a case.

589
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:00,564
Yeah, I figured.

590
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:04,226
But why do you need me?
You have the full resources of the FBI.

591
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:06,458
Not anymore.

592
00:44:06,863 --> 00:44:07,939
I'm retired.

593
00:44:10,444 --> 00:44:11,317
Their loss.

594
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,060
Yeah, well...

595
00:44:13,623 --> 00:44:15,196
I fish, travel,

596
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:16,807
and...

597
00:44:17,533 --> 00:44:20,826
now I have the time to track down
the twisted son of a bitch who got away.

598
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,956
So, who is
the twisted son of a bitch?

599
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,667
I call him the trinity killer.

600
00:44:28,905 --> 00:44:30,044
Kills in threes.

601
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:32,546
Been doing it all over the country
for years.

602
00:44:32,877 --> 00:44:35,177
Problem is, I can't prove he exists.

603
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:37,953
Law enforcement
doesn't talk to each other.

604
00:44:38,546 --> 00:44:40,805
So no one at the FBI
is even on board.

605
00:44:42,432 --> 00:44:43,474
Just me.

606
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,471
I've been looking for a break.
Then this happens.

607
00:44:46,596 --> 00:44:47,596
Lisa Bell.

608
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:50,946
Her murder profile
fits the previous victims.

609
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:54,761
Trinity is in Miami, Dexter,

610
00:44:55,461 --> 00:44:57,661
starting his cycle all over again.

611
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:07,373
How far back do your cases go?

612
00:45:08,003 --> 00:45:09,166
About fifteen years.

613
00:45:10,068 --> 00:45:13,559
The house and room,
where Lisa Bell was murdered,

614
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:17,300
was the site of a very similar homicide
thirty years ago.

615
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:19,861
Take a look.

616
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,022
Always come full circle.
He's back where his killing began.

617
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:33,816
Thirty years.

618
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,276
You know what this means?

619
00:45:36,551 --> 00:45:40,051
Trinity's the most successful
serial killer to ever...

620
00:45:40,923 --> 00:45:42,273
get away with it.

621
00:46:05,915 --> 00:46:07,165
What? I'm fine.

622
00:46:07,894 --> 00:46:09,387
I can't wait to see you.

623
00:46:13,948 --> 00:46:16,398
Anton, I have to go.
I have a meeting.

624
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:21,629
Hello, Debra.

625
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,570
Motherfucking fuck.

626
00:46:28,115 --> 00:46:29,615
Nice to see you too.

627
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:31,151
Fuck.

628
00:46:32,946 --> 00:46:34,646
What are you doing here?

629
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:36,712
Are you here on a case?

630
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:40,132
Actually, I'm retired now.

631
00:46:41,296 --> 00:46:42,343
Yet you're here.

632
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:45,814
Life has a natural forward momentum.

633
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:48,099
Certain things are inevitable.

634
00:46:50,426 --> 00:46:51,426
Like you.

635
00:46:53,647 --> 00:46:54,647
Making detective.

636
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:57,483
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

637
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:59,251
I never had any doubt.

638
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:06,242
How long will your forward momentum
keep you in Miami?

639
00:47:07,566 --> 00:47:08,744
Not sure exactly.

640
00:47:13,875 --> 00:47:14,875
Be seeing you.

641
00:47:18,286 --> 00:47:20,786
I guess. Maybe.
I mean, I don't know.

642
00:47:39,051 --> 00:47:41,201
Big plans this evening, sergeant?

643
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,440
The usual, lieutenant.

644
00:47:57,105 --> 00:47:58,105
Hey, guys.

645
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,252
Drinks?

646
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:07,303
<i>I had Benny Gomez
on the ropes and let him slip away.</i>

647
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,094
<i>No way I can go to that bar again.
Officer Alphabet made sure of that.</i>

648
00:48:12,546 --> 00:48:15,096
<i>Which means I grab Benny
where he lives.</i>

649
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:17,605
<i>A higher degree of difficulty,
but I don't have a choice.</i>

650
00:48:18,551 --> 00:48:21,745
<i>If I want to be around for my son,
I have to do this right.</i>

651
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,320
<i>I'm killing for two now.</i>

652
00:48:49,038 --> 00:48:50,054
The fuck you want?

653
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:52,694
You.

654
00:49:05,824 --> 00:49:06,924
<i>Look at him.</i>

655
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:08,331
<i>Fast asleep.</i>

656
00:49:09,595 --> 00:49:10,595
<i>Lucky guy.</i>

657
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:36,422
I know you.

658
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,856
I'm the blood guy.

659
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:05,338
You've made a lot of people
very miserable.

660
00:50:06,591 --> 00:50:07,691
Me included.

661
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,330
Till now.

662
00:50:19,209 --> 00:50:22,159
<i>Because now I get to answer
life's big question.</i>

663
00:50:22,537 --> 00:50:23,606
<i>My life, anyway.</i>

664
00:50:29,762 --> 00:50:31,862
Can I do it?
Can I have it all?

665
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:36,535
Shit!

666
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,836
Dexter, I need you to go
to an all-night pharmacy right away.

667
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:49,488
- I'm kinda in the middle of something.
- Harrison has an ear infection.

668
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:52,802
He's in a lot of pain, Dexter.
Whatever you're doing can wait.

669
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:56,389
Right, my mistake.
I wasn't thinking.

670
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:57,854
I'm on my way.

671
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:01,352
Kids...

672
00:51:09,262 --> 00:51:10,262
Gotta go.

673
00:51:10,624 --> 00:51:12,224
No time to savor this.

674
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,660
The clock's ticking.

675
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:16,409
But it's all about sacrifice.

676
00:51:17,514 --> 00:51:18,734
The good of the family.

677
00:52:07,546 --> 00:52:09,215
<i>Maybe tonight wasn't perfect.</i>

678
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,133
<i>Maybe I need to reboot
the way I do things.</i>

679
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,625
<i>But at least I'm on the right road.</i>

680
00:52:18,959 --> 00:52:21,384
<i>I'm on my way
to taking care of my family,</i>

681
00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:22,683
<i>raising my son.</i>

682
00:52:23,029 --> 00:52:25,157
<i>And all the while doing
what I have to do</i>

683
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:28,078
<i>to satisfy a calling
that I can't ignore</i>

684
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:31,190
<i>or deny.</i>

685
00:52:33,494 --> 00:52:34,820
<i>I can do this.</i>

686
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:45,748
You don't need to sleep!

687
00:52:48,796 --> 00:52:49,961
You need to wake up!
