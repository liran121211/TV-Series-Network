00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,557
<i>- previously on dexter...</i>

2
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,512
- do you know where you are?

3
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,014
- ambulance. what happened?
- you were in an accident.

4
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,150
- bad news is that
you sustained a concussion.

5
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,018
I'd like to keep you
here for observation.

6
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,654
- dexter, oh my god!

7
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:03,906
You all right?
- i'm fine.

8
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:05,158
Just a little fender bender.

9
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,592
Doc says i'm good to go.

10
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:07,827
- you got a minute?

11
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,612
I'd, uh,
like to pick your brain.

12
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,999
Lisa bell?
the girl in the bathtub.

13
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:14,233
- of course.

14
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:16,502
The trinity killer's
most recent victim.

15
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,920
- trinity is
going to kill again.

16
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:20,873
Another woman,
older than lisa bell this time.

17
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:22,375
- but the person that you
should really be talking to

18
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:24,343
Is my sister--
she's lead on lisa bell.

19
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,762
- you sure that's a good call?
given our history.

20
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,414
- i wouldn't want
to mislead you.

21
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:31,968
What i have with anton.
it's--it's great.

22
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,686
I fucking love you.

23
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,889
- the reason i'm in miami
is because i'm convinced

24
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:40,643
These bathtub murders are
connected to a series or murders

25
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:41,978
All over the country.

26
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,146
- christ.
i'm an idiot.

27
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,648
- debra!

28
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,400
- tell me again
this isn't crazy.

29
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,902
- crazy good.

30
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,705
- i brought you a copy
of my article.

31
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,957
- a string of robberies turned
deadly in what authorities

32
00:02:54,992 --> 00:02:56,742
Are now calling
the vacation murder.

33
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,794
- i found your guy.
name's johnny rose.

34
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,913
- briefing room in five minutes.
strategy meeting.

35
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:03,249
Dexter's turned up a lead
on our shooter.

36
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,639
- don't sweat it, quinn.

37
00:03:09,673 --> 00:03:12,174
I've got much bigger things
to worry about.

38
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:13,643
- i thought it was
a fender bender.

39
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:16,062
- i'm sure there's a bent fender
somewhere in this mess.

40
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,597
- oh, my god.

41
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,432
- rita,
what are you doing here?

42
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:22,018
- you lied to me, dexter.

43
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:27,640
[latin music]

44
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:32,778
? ?

45
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,580
- the backyard barbecue.

46
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:38,417
It's a holdover from the last
ice age when food was scarce

47
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:42,338
And men had to work together
to take down such a large beast.

48
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,958
Those who worked
well with others survived,

49
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,511
And their genes have been passed
down through the centuries

50
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,713
Until they landed here--

51
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,215
In this...

52
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,850
My community.

53
00:03:54,885 --> 00:04:02,808
? ?

54
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,904
[drumming]

55
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:18,040
Soda?

56
00:04:18,075 --> 00:04:20,192
- whatever.

57
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:26,248
- how 'bout you?

58
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,001
- i'm good.

59
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:31,721
- ah, wasted youth.

60
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,925
- hey, can i talk to you
for a second?

61
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:39,428
- yeah.

62
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,014
- i just got off the phone
with dr. montgomery,

63
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:44,984
The doctor that took care
of you after your accident.

64
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,652
- oh, right.

65
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,821
- why didn't you tell me
you had a concussion?

66
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,489
- i just wanted
to keep you from worrying.

67
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,158
You already have so much
to deal with.

68
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,527
- the doctor also told you that
you weren't supposed to drive

69
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,362
For the next ten days,
and you didn't listen.

70
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:58,447
So i will now be doing
all your driving.

71
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,116
I will take you to work
in the morning,

72
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,734
And i will pick you up
at the end of the day.

73
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:03,536
- rita, i'm perfectly capable--
- dexter.

74
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,339
The past few weeks,
you have not been

75
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:09,208
The most present
father and husband.

76
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,544
Remember.
we're a team here, right?

77
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:15,881
Okay, we work together.

78
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,082
- she's right.

79
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,751
Maybe now's the time
to turn that around.

80
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,269
Score a few points.

81
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,221
Which will then make rita
more likely to say yes

82
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,807
When i need a little
time for myself.

83
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,893
You're right.
i'm sorry.

84
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,646
- thank you.
let's go eat.

85
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,370
- so i guess you saw somebody
bashed in kate's birdbath.

86
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,538
- i know, that's awful.

87
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,791
- poor birds.

88
00:05:41,825 --> 00:05:43,993
And poor kate.

89
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,327
- why would someone
do such a thing?

90
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:46,612
- the same reason
he knocked over

91
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,880
The andersons'
water fountain,

92
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,249
Pulled down the garcias'
basketball hoop

93
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,584
And spray-painted
the schwarzs' trash cans.

94
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:52,835
'cause he's a dick.

95
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,754
- he knocked the sea horse
off my mailbox, too.

96
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,722
- i hated that sea horse.

97
00:05:56,757 --> 00:05:59,308
- well, your mom
picked it out.

98
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:04,430
- you know andy.
- uh, yeah, of course.

99
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,516
- hi, how are you doing?
hey, jess, jess, jess?

100
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:09,235
Do you really need
to be doing that?

101
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,986
- yeah, i really do.

102
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:14,273
- his wife passed away
last year.

103
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:17,326
- so, uh, so about this
neighborhood vandal.

104
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,495
- we all need to work together
to deal with this guy.

105
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,414
- the last thing we need
is a dangerous presence

106
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:22,615
In our neighborhood.

107
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,116
- you know,
it's a funny thing, dexter.

108
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,786
This all started to happen
time you moved in.

109
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,122
A little suspicious,
don't you think?

110
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:31,507
I'm just busting your chops.

111
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:34,009
- oh.
[chuckling]

112
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:35,795
My chops are busted.

113
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:39,348
The danger of community is that
the people who don't belong

114
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:40,933
Are looked upon
with suspicion.

115
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:44,220
Those of us who prefer
to work by ourselves,

116
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,772
The lone wolves,
risk being singled out.

117
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:49,275
- cody. what's that?

118
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,943
- waah!

119
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,113
[laughing]

120
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,147
I'm gonna get you!

121
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,198
- oh, i'm scared!

122
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:59,652
- so i become an expert
at blending in,

123
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:03,572
Camouflaging myself,
becoming one of the guys.

124
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:04,874
- astor, what's that?

125
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:06,709
- ahh!

126
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:07,993
Oh, my god.

127
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,045
- dexter!

128
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,665
- i'm so humiliated.

129
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:14,667
- what were you thinking?

130
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:18,137
- she was wearing
a bathing suit.

131
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,390
- this blending in thing
isn't as easy as it looks.

132
00:07:21,424 --> 00:07:24,393
[eerie music]

133
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:25,978
? ?

134
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,898
- [indistinct sobbing]

135
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,773
- we're here.

136
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:40,776
Stop right here.

137
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,084
That's okay.

138
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:55,708
- oh!

139
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:59,044
Oh, god, please.
don't hurt me!

140
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:01,964
Oh, god! oh, god!

141
00:08:11,808 --> 00:08:14,143
- don't do anything stupid.

142
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:21,033
Careful, now.

143
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,101
Wouldn't want
to hurt yourself.

144
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,118
It's pretty, isn't it?

145
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:45,925
Okay, now.
it's time for you to jump.

146
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,594
- what?

147
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,728
God, no.

148
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:52,181
- yes.
it always ends like this.

149
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,182
- no, but--

150
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,684
- shh.

151
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,238
It's already over.

152
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,690
- why are you
doing this to me?

153
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,492
- you know
i'm not to blame here.

154
00:09:03,526 --> 00:09:04,977
- [sobbing]

155
00:09:04,995 --> 00:09:06,412
- come on, now.

156
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,334
- please, no!

157
00:09:12,369 --> 00:09:16,005
- now you just
need to let go...

158
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,756
And fall.

159
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,291
- please, i'll do anything.

160
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,326
- good. jump.
- no, i can't!

161
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:24,346
- you can.
- i have children!

162
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:26,348
- i know.

- [groaning]

164
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,001
- if you like,
i can swing by your house,

165
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:31,720
Put an ice pick
in your husband's head,

166
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,306
And bring your kids back,
and throw them off one at a time

167
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,726
Until you finally
decide to jump.

168
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,945
Is that what you want?

169
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,984
- please...

170
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,236
- what?

171
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,821
- please.

172
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,073
Just push me.

173
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,579
- it doesn't work that way.

174
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,967
Jump.

175
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,260
- [screaming]

[thud]

177
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:27,893
- oh...mommy.

178
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,663
- you've only
been here a month,

179
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:23,048
And they've already

raised questions, dexter.

It would have made people
think, "why this kid? why him?"

You can't afford to have people
asking those questions.

coffee even if you're up first?

bad enough to make it.

what to say to that.

did you predict this jumper?

00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:23,228
- actually, no, i didn't.

356
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:24,312
All: hey!

357
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,982
- this is my community.
i am one of you.

358
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,985
Uh, great.
love having the neighbors over.

359
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,486
- are you ready
to fight crime, dexter?

360
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:33,488
- you betcha.

361
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,440
- that's good.
be aware of your neighbors.

362
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,908
Know their schedules.

363
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,159
That way you'll know if
something's different,

364
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,444
If anything seems off.

365
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,778
- we don't want that.

366
00:19:40,796 --> 00:19:43,548
- here, have a whistle
and a head flashlight.

367
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:47,802
It'll keep your hands free
when you're out patrolling.

368
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:50,555
- patrolling?
we're patrolling?

369
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,642
- your job is to watch
and report, watch and report.

370
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:56,478
- watch and report.
- you got it.

371
00:19:56,512 --> 00:19:58,980
- [laughing]

372
00:19:59,015 --> 00:20:00,815
- community college
for me now.

373
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,235
- hey, dexter, our neighborhood
beautification association

374
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,104
Asked me to give this to you.
i'm the secretary.

375
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,656
It's a warning against
the graffiti on your gate.

376
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,608
I know it's silly,
but they want you to repaint.

377
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,775
- hey, dex.

378
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,444
I guess you saw the new
motion-detector lights

379
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,946
I just put in.

380
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,665
- sure are bright.

381
00:20:16,699 --> 00:20:18,250
- yeah,
brightest i could get.

382
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,702
Made sure i angled one
right on your place, too.

383
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,288
- that's very
neighborly of you.

384
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,956
- we have to look out
for each other.

385
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,175
- yeah, this guy started off
small, a few broken windows,

386
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:29,628
Andy's mailbox,
but yesterday he broke into

387
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,346
The walkers' guest house
and trashed the place.

388
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,015
Yeah, next thing he'll be
stealing our women.

389
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,384
Can't let him steal our women,
now, can we?

390
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:39,304
- no, they're our women.

391
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:40,555
- [laughing]

392
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,807
- is that the sign-up sheet?
- yeah, yeah.

393
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,859
See, we're setting up patrols
for every night of the week.

394
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,511
- i'm good for every night
but wednesday.

395
00:20:46,529 --> 00:20:48,313
I got a poker night
at the lodge.

396
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:50,115
- great.

397
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:53,368
- no one will come in or out
of this neighborhood unnoticed.

398
00:20:53,402 --> 00:20:54,819
- including me.

399
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,571
It's not the neighborhood vandal
i'm worried about.

400
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:59,207
It's the neighborhood watch.

401
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:04,129
Hmm, graffiti.

402
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,498
Excuse me.

403
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:08,883
- so i was all set to go to the
university of miami next year

404
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:11,052
Till my dad decided
to get himself laid off.

405
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,921
- that blows.

406
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,889
- how about you, jesse?

407
00:21:14,924 --> 00:21:17,509
You want to sign up for
the neighborhood watch?

408
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:18,927
- sounds kind of lame.

409
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:23,481
- so lame.

410
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:27,152
- paint can, soda can--
i'm thinking fingerprints.

411
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:30,021
Let me get that for you.

412
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:33,024
And i know one little lady
who is up past her bedtime.

413
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,160
- mom!

414
00:21:37,613 --> 00:21:41,449
- dexter, you can't treat her
like a little girl anymore.

415
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,619
- i can't?

416
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:48,590
- hey, dex.

417
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:50,792
- hey, elliot.

418
00:22:04,774 --> 00:22:06,441
- have a nice day!

419
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,873
- you knew this day
would come, dexter.

420
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,541
You've always been
good with kids,

421
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,243
But eventually they grow up.

422
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:27,829
They become more mature,

423
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,665
Develop complex emotions that
just aren't in your skill set.

424
00:22:30,716 --> 00:22:32,917
Astor's becoming a whole person,
and you're...

425
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,502
- something less.

426
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,471
- i hope you're not taking
any of this seriously.

427
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:39,474
The wife, the kids,
the house in the 'burbs.

428
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:42,844
It's all great camouflage,
but that's all it is.

429
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:44,729
- it's gotten more complicated
than that.

430
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:46,598
- then uncomplicate it.

431
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:48,433
You need to realize
your limitations.

432
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:50,769
Remember exactly who you are.

433
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:53,738
Probably should have used
something a little darker.

434
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:56,241
- it's fine, dad.
nothing's gonna show through.

435
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:59,744
- i hope not, dex.
for your sake.

436
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:04,032
- hey, you ready to go?

437
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:05,200
- almost.

438
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:08,253
- i've got the best
of bananarama.

439
00:23:08,287 --> 00:23:10,371
- it's a cruel summer.

440
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,010
As long as
the neighborhood vandal

441
00:23:16,045 --> 00:23:19,180
Keeps my neighbors on edge,
i will have no privacy.

442
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,139
And i'm not going to let you
do that to me, jesse.

443
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:35,113
- tarla grant,
married, mother of two.

444
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,865
- it fits.

445
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,900
- it fits what?
- lundy's theory.

446
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,869
- that she's another victim
of the serial killer.

447
00:23:40,903 --> 00:23:43,154
- yes.

448
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:44,989
What?

449
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:46,741
- his whole life is
about serial killers.

450
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,660
That's all he thinks about,
so of course he thinks

451
00:23:48,577 --> 00:23:50,044
She was killed
by a serial killer.

452
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:52,464
- i think he's
a little smarter than that.

453
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,415
- i'm sure you do,
otherwise you wouldn't be

454
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,301
Sitting at your desk going
through 30-year-old files

455
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,302
All afternoon.

456
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,036
- oh, yeah, guess what.

457
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:01,422
So are you.

458
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:03,725
- just unsealed the juvey
records of johnny rose,

459
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:05,393
Our vacation murder suspect.

460
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:06,845
- anything?

461
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,881
- shoplifting with his high
school girlfriend, nikki wald.

462
00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:12,567
- that was like, what,
ten years ago?

463
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,068
You think they're
still in touch?

464
00:24:14,103 --> 00:24:15,854
- since she testified
against him back then,

465
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:17,689
I'd say extremely unlikely.

466
00:24:17,723 --> 00:24:21,025
- well, at this point, i think
we need to take any shot we can.

467
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,895
- she lives in oakland park.
i'll drive out there with you.

468
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:25,897
- let's go.

469
00:24:29,451 --> 00:24:32,120
- that seem accidental
and unplanned to you?

470
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:34,405
- even i believed it.

471
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:37,175
- i was thinking we could stop
somewhere for lunch first.

472
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:41,462
- i know a little place where
we can order some room service.

473
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,766
- okay, here we go.
30 years ago to the week.

474
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,520
Female, caucasian, 36,
mother of two.

475
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:50,889
Jumped to her death
off the same warehouse.

476
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:53,441
The woman's family insisted
she was the victim of foul play,

477
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,894
But it was ruled a suicide.

478
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,362
- doesn't mean fuck-all.

479
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:58,897
Someone fell or jumped off

480
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,865
The same warehouse
eight years ago.

481
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,201
Someone else jumped off
a ship loading crane

482
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:05,069
On the same pier
back in '86,

483
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,488
And another body
washed up on the rocks

484
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,208
Right in front of the warehouse
only two years ago.

485
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,826
Nobody knows how it got there.

486
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:13,745
This is miami, deb.
people die.

487
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:17,248
- and sometimes it's by murder.
i want to follow up on this.

488
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:20,418
- okay, tarla grant seemed
to have a pretty decent life.

489
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,338
No apparent reason for suicide,
so keep it open for now.

490
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,456
- fuckin' a
we'll keep it open.

491
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:28,393
- i'd know
that foul mouth anywhere.

492
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:30,762
- anton, what are you
doing here?

493
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,146
- i love you too, baby.

494
00:25:32,181 --> 00:25:33,431
Come on,
let's have some lunch.

495
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,016
- i have a fuckload
of work to do.

496
00:25:39,188 --> 00:25:41,239
All right.

497
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,409
All right,
but it's a working lunch.

498
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,861
- ah, solitude.

499
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,747
Something i won't enjoy again
until i deal with jesse,

500
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,950
The neighborhood shithead.

501
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,322
- hey, dexter.
- hey.

502
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,592
- dexter,
i was looking for you.

503
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,760
Hello, debra.

504
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:05,630
- hi.
- may i?

505
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:09,467
- yeah.

506
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,768
- frank lundy.

507
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:11,769
- anton briggs.

508
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,305
- my lover--

509
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,190
Friend.
my boyfriend.

510
00:26:16,225 --> 00:26:19,394
- all of the above.

511
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,063
- so, dexter, i was wondering
if you'd gotten

512
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,283
The blood tox results back
on tarla grant yet?

513
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,318
- yeah, i should check
on that right away.

514
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,287
- please, finish your lunch.

515
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,123
- all done.

516
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:36,244
- tarla grant, just like
you said: 36 years old,

517
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:37,962
Married, mother of two.

518
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,330
- that's a shame.

519
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,383
- i found the matching
30-year-old case.

520
00:26:42,418 --> 00:26:43,885
- what's that?

521
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,887
- big case we're working on.

522
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:49,474
- i'm afraid i've enlisted debra
in another of my mad theories.

523
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:52,727
- ah.

524
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,095
What's it all about?

525
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:57,148
- finding out who killed her.

526
00:26:57,182 --> 00:26:59,233
- oh.

527
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:01,486
- i don't suppose you happened
to bring the, uh--

528
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,155
- 30-year-old file?

529
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:06,607
Read the husband's statement
from 30 years ago.

530
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,911
Family never believed
it was a suicide.

531
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:12,246
- but since trinity
never leaves a trace,

532
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,500
There was nothing
to investigate.

533
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:23,207
- you give
good room service, angel.

534
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,426
- you know, we should
do lunch out more often.

535
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:29,013
- missed one.

536
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:31,582
[giggles]

537
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,751
- no arrests
since she got busted

538
00:27:33,769 --> 00:27:35,086
With rose
back in high school.

539
00:27:35,104 --> 00:27:36,804
Spotty job record,
but that's about it.

540
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,356
- it's a stretch, i know.

541
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,646
[knock on door]

542
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,065
Nikki?

543
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:52,070
Nikki wald?

544
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:55,073
I'm not sure
miss nikki wald is home.

545
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,493
- okay.

546
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:04,048
Hey, i'm sergeant batista
from miami metro homicide.

547
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:05,116
- it's rose.

548
00:28:05,134 --> 00:28:06,134
- get down!

549
00:28:06,168 --> 00:28:11,973
[gunshots]

550
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,291
Shots fired, 41st and andrews.
we need backup!

551
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:15,727
Good?
- yeah, i'm good, let's go.

552
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:27,905
- suspects johnny rose
and nikki wald going northbound

553
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,408
On 41st street
in a white sedan.

554
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,309
- i think it was gray.
- a light-colored sedan.

555
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,477
Make? model?

556
00:28:33,495 --> 00:28:36,480
- suspects are
armed and dangerous.

557
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:44,956
- rita thinks i'm with
the neighborhood watch.

558
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:48,876
Truth is, i'm gonna do
a little more than watch.

559
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:53,381
There's dad,
off to his weekly poker game.

560
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:56,517
[car ignition starts]

561
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:02,339
And if i were
the delinquent son,

562
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:05,943
I would take advantage
of my father's absence.

563
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,981
Going after him
feels very familiar,

564
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:13,234
Except it won't have
its usual satisfying ending.

565
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:16,370
The best i can do is scare
a little sense into this kid.

566
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,329
- hey!

567
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:26,747
Come on, it's the vandal.
let's get him!

568
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,834
- oh, fuck.

569
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:41,729
It's watch and report,
assholes.

570
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:44,515
Not watch and chase.

571
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,484
This is so humiliating.

572
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,855
- go that way.

573
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:23,221
- this neighborhood's
gonna kill me.

574
00:30:30,145 --> 00:30:31,779
- already? i mean, the kids
aren't even dressed yet.

575
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:33,147
- i know, i know, i'm early.

576
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:36,400
Just wanted you to see
the latest work of the vandal.

577
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,289
Happened in the
middle of the night.

578
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:44,742
He obviously smashed the window,
released the emergency brake,

579
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:48,079
Gave it a shove,
and, uh, let it roll.

580
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:49,797
- so dangerous.

581
00:30:49,831 --> 00:30:52,216
- is that cody's bike?

582
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:53,668
- oh, my god.

583
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:56,137
What if he had been
out here playing?

584
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:08,516
- these dummies share the same
size and weight distribution

585
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:09,767
As our victim.

586
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:12,820
At this height,
any variant in trajectory

587
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:15,823
Resulting from a simple jump
or being pushed off the building

588
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:17,525
Will be evident
in where they land.

589
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:21,195
- what if she took
a running leap?

590
00:31:21,196 --> 00:31:22,830
- people don't kill
themselves that way.

591
00:31:22,864 --> 00:31:24,165
They just let go.

592
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:27,151
Oh, hey, either of you
interested in buying tickets

593
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:28,786
To the dolphins game?
club level?

594
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,921
I'll let them go
for 500 bucks.

595
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,505
- where'd you get those?
- dexter.

596
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,790
- son of a bitch.

597
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,658
- come on,
we have dummies to drop.

598
00:31:34,676 --> 00:31:38,346
- is he gonna pay me
for those?

599
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,214
Must be weird for you--

600
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,716
Lundy coming back.

601
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,517
- why would it be weird?
you're weird.

602
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,636
- none of my business,
i know.

603
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,390
But...if i loved someone,

604
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:51,309
And that person was gone,

605
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:53,611
And then i moved on,
and then found someone else,

606
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,679
And then that first person
all of a sudden showed up again,

607
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:58,950
I don't know--
i've never had that problem.

608
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,569
But it's gotta be
a little confusing.

609
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,521
- maybe.

610
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,741
A little.

611
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:08,743
- so then maybe if you know
that it's supposed to be

612
00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,127
Weird and confusing,

613
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,463
Then maybe it's
a little easier to handle.

614
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,583
- thanks.

615
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:18,202
- it's always the same
three kills with trinity--

616
00:32:18,387 --> 00:32:21,389
A young woman in a bathtub,

617
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:25,009
Followed by a mother
falling to her death,

618
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,645
And ending with a man
getting bludgeoned.

619
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,264
- i put her in a short shirt
so that we can see her panties

620
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,817
While she's falling.

621
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:37,738
- specific.

622
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,942
How many times
that you know of?

623
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:44,194
- i've got
the bits and pieces

624
00:32:44,246 --> 00:32:47,198
That add up
to at least 15 cycles.

625
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:51,168
Since we just turned the clock
back another 15 years,

626
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,238
I'm sure there are
considerably more.

627
00:32:54,256 --> 00:32:57,458
- wow.

628
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,793
That's impressive.

629
00:33:02,431 --> 00:33:04,748
In a very evil way.

630
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:10,855
- what's really impressive
is that i can't prove a thing.

631
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,589
Could never get anyone
at the bureau convinced.

632
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:13,858
He's that good.

633
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:16,593
- why do you think
he's so successful?

634
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:20,931
- trinity's likely someone
who's gone his own solitary way

635
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,433
Through life,

636
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,535
So preoccupied
with his own obsessions

637
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,988
That he's foregone all but
the most rudimentary

638
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,107
Of human connections.

639
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,793
- a lone wolf.

640
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:34,295
- exactly.

641
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:37,948
It's a little bit disturbing.

642
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:39,333
- yeah.

643
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,802
- i mean...
i could just as well

644
00:33:41,837 --> 00:33:45,172
Be talking about myself.

645
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,974
Sure, i've been married.

646
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:50,511
Was married for 29 years,
happily.

647
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:52,596
But even so,

648
00:33:52,974 --> 00:33:56,067
The only thing that
really got my heart beating

649
00:33:56,101 --> 00:33:58,018
Was the hunt.

650
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,603
I'm sure you can't relate.

651
00:33:59,637 --> 00:34:02,490
- no, sorry.

652
00:34:02,524 --> 00:34:05,493
- and now here i am at 60,

653
00:34:05,494 --> 00:34:07,995
Watching dummies
fly off a roof,

654
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,248
Still on the hunt.

655
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:13,701
- it sounds like trinity
is worthy prey.

656
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,320
- what's really
got me intrigued

657
00:34:16,338 --> 00:34:21,258
Is the notion
that he's returned to miami.

658
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:24,011
- he's come home.

659
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:28,048
- i'm not sure "home"
is the right word.

660
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:32,169
People like us
don't really belong anywhere.

661
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:35,389
We just pass through.

662
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,792
- drink up.

663
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,748
You're next.

664
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,110
- the vacation murders.

665
00:36:03,144 --> 00:36:06,096
Word is, you know who
johnny rose's accomplice is.

666
00:36:06,114 --> 00:36:07,865
- forget it, you'll get
the press release same time

667
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,366
As everyone else.

668
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:11,202
But my sergeant and lieutenant
were almost killed yesterday,

669
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:14,121
So if you put any negative
spin on it, i'll be very angry.

670
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:16,607
- when you're angry,
you're very sexy,

671
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:19,460
So this could be
sort of a win-win for me.

672
00:36:19,494 --> 00:36:21,545
- let's just say i'll be angry
in a very withholding

673
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,713
Sort of way.

674
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,048
- okay.

675
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,550
The bathtub murder?
- still under investigation.

676
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:29,420
- the jumper
at the old port building?

677
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:30,621
- ditto.

678
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:32,923
I gotta run.
see you tonight?

679
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,341
- sure.

680
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,126
- can you just go over
the figures one more time?

681
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:37,761
- they're not gonna change.

682
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:40,130
The test results indicate that
tarla grant jumped,

683
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:41,649
Rather than was pushed.
- i don't buy it.

684
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:42,983
I think we're looking
at a murder victim.

685
00:36:43,018 --> 00:36:44,235
- deb, we also got
the autopsy report.

686
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,569
She had a small tumor.

687
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,072
Talked to the husband.
they just found out last week.

688
00:36:48,106 --> 00:36:51,242
Maybe she was taking
the easy way out.

689
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:53,810
- maybe she was determined
to fight it.

690
00:36:53,662 --> 00:36:55,079
That doesn't mean
she killed herself.

691
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,747
I checked
her cell phone records.

692
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,749
No text messages,
no suicide note.

693
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:01,368
- not everyone leaves a note.

694
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:02,703
- i just got word.

695
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,538
We will be debriefed
on our shooting incident

696
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,839
In the morning.

697
00:37:05,874 --> 00:37:08,008
- okay, good.

698
00:37:08,043 --> 00:37:09,510
- we need to get
our stories straight

699
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:11,128
About why we left
the precinct at 12:30

700
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:14,265
And didn't get to wald's
apartment until after 3:00.

701
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:17,468
- we grabbed some lunch
and then we had a flat tire.

702
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:19,720
- flat tire it is.

703
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:22,523
- you okay?

704
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:24,508
- i've read masuka's notes.

705
00:37:24,526 --> 00:37:26,443
That, along with
the autopsy reports,

706
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,178
Leads me to believe that
there's no reason

707
00:37:28,196 --> 00:37:30,364
To keep tarla's case open
as a murder investigation.

708
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:32,900
- lieutenant, i think
it's premature to close it.

709
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,818
Lundy has this theory--
- you don't work for lundy.

710
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,188
You're welcome to pursue this,
but between the vacation murders

711
00:37:38,206 --> 00:37:42,409
And lisa bell, i think
you're gonna be very busy.

712
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,044
- you're on your own
with this one.

713
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,163
- poor cody.

714
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,383
Ouch.

715
00:37:49,417 --> 00:37:51,251
Where'd the glass come from?

716
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:52,469
- that car on elliot's lawn.

717
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:54,004
Cody was coming back
from their pool,

718
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,090
And he stepped on a piece.

719
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:57,925
- does he need stitches?

720
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,810
- no, he's fine,
he's just scared.

721
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,562
First his bike, now this.

722
00:38:01,596 --> 00:38:04,548
- poor guy.
give him a hug for me.

723
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,070
- hi.

724
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:11,888
Help me out here, dexter.

725
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:13,741
I've been going out of my way
trying to make things good

726
00:38:13,775 --> 00:38:15,075
With you,
but no matter what i do,

727
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:17,328
You just throw it back
in my face.

728
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:20,831
- you don't need to make
things good with me.

729
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,417
- come on,
what's it gonna take?

730
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:26,069
- quinn...

731
00:38:26,087 --> 00:38:28,839
I don't care
if you're a dirty cop.

732
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:32,843
- if i didn't take that money,
it would just sit

733
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,378
Inside a locker
until some fatass

734
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:36,630
Who sits behind a desk
grabs it to buy new carpet

735
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,132
For his office
which he never leaves.

736
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:39,600
I put my life on the line
every day.

737
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:41,602
I give this job
everything i've got,

738
00:38:41,636 --> 00:38:43,604
And i can't even afford
a down payment on a condo.

739
00:38:43,638 --> 00:38:45,806
- i thought
you had family money.

740
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,474
- had, and that has nothing
to do with anything.

741
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,693
Just don't
fucking call me dirty.

742
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,029
- the last thing i need
is a cop mad at me.

743
00:38:55,533 --> 00:39:00,120
Look, you're right,
i take it all back.

744
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:04,441
I honestly
don't give a shit.

745
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:07,745
Just keep my sister
out of it, okay?

746
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:13,083
- you don't understand
any of this, do you?

747
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:16,387
You can't,

748
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:19,923
'cause you're not a cop.

749
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:21,892
You're not one of us.

750
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,177
- [sigh]

751
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:25,846
Cops: another community
i'm not part of.

752
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:42,830
[exhales]

753
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,334
- what?

754
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:50,204
- it's so crowded in there.

755
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,840
- well, i guess so.
a wife and three kids.

756
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:58,495
- they're always there.

757
00:39:58,513 --> 00:40:00,681
- tell me about it.

758
00:40:00,715 --> 00:40:04,268
It was easy living with anton
when he was never home.

759
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:06,270
I'd come back
to a quiet apartment

760
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,772
And unwind without having
to deal with anybody.

761
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,841
Now, as soon as i walk
through the door, he's there,

762
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:12,526
Waiting to engage.

763
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,944
- there's no escape.

764
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:18,816
- and now lundy shows up.

765
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,653
- is that good or bad?

766
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:26,073
- i have no fucking clue.

767
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:29,827
[giggles]
- what?

768
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,713
- we're complaining because
people want to be with us?

769
00:40:32,747 --> 00:40:35,499
How lame is that?

770
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:39,169
You think tarla grant
killed herself?

771
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:43,373
- no, i don't.

772
00:40:43,391 --> 00:40:47,377
- masuka said she wasn't thrown
or pushed from the building.

773
00:40:47,395 --> 00:40:52,316
She jumped.
what would make her do that?

774
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:55,352
- fear is a powerful motivator.

775
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,893
- you should go inside.
you're home.

776
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:06,580
- thanks.
- yeah.

777
00:41:14,956 --> 00:41:17,207
- hi.
- hi, sweetie.

778
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:18,458
- where is everybody?

779
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,043
- i'm in here.

780
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,129
- fort cody.

781
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:29,303
- hey, buddy,
how's your foot?

782
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,771
- it's better.

783
00:41:30,805 --> 00:41:34,558
- good.
keep holding down the fort.

784
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:36,109
- okay.

785
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:38,478
- and i'll
take care of my end

786
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,614
Once you guys
go to sleep tonight.

787
00:41:40,648 --> 00:41:43,200
- you may want
to talk to astor.

788
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,488
- this is one of those moments
when i wish

789
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,207
I was like everyone else.

790
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,109
I'm sure other people
would know what to say.

791
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:00,884
Hey.

792
00:42:07,642 --> 00:42:09,843
I know you're not
a little kid anymore.

793
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,145
- duh.

794
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,297
- i'm sorry.

795
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:18,402
It's just...

796
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:22,305
Sometimes i'm...

797
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:23,941
Dumb.

798
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:34,868
- it's okay.

799
00:42:34,919 --> 00:42:37,921
You can be dumb.

800
00:42:41,843 --> 00:42:43,343
- [sighs]
thanks.

801
00:43:01,896 --> 00:43:03,897
- what?

802
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:09,185
- it's funny.

803
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:11,905
A few months ago,
after a shoot-up like this,

804
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:14,041
People saw me
leaning against you,

805
00:43:13,908 --> 00:43:15,325
They wouldn't think twice.

806
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,360
- they still
wouldn't think twice.

807
00:43:17,378 --> 00:43:18,962
They don't know
anything about us.

808
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:21,698
- i know.

809
00:43:21,716 --> 00:43:24,051
But i think twice.

810
00:43:23,918 --> 00:43:28,221
I'm constantly worried that
people will misinterpret.

811
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,597
- let them misinterpret.

812
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:43,053
Hey...

813
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:45,155
I need this
as much as you do.

814
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:50,894
- this dexter guy.

815
00:43:50,912 --> 00:43:53,497
First of all, who the fuck
is named dexter?

816
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:55,582
- [groaning]

817
00:43:55,616 --> 00:43:57,784
- oh, that feels good.

818
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,236
What, did his parents know
he was gonna grow up

819
00:44:00,254 --> 00:44:02,405
To be a fucking egghead?

820
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:05,292
- i met him.
he seems okay.

821
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:07,711
- he's a lab geek.

822
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:10,747
Fuck, that feels good.

823
00:44:10,765 --> 00:44:12,916
- what else?

824
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:16,687
- what else?
i'm exhausted.

825
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:19,439
I spent all afternoon
in the sun

826
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:22,275
Throwing dummies
off a warehouse,

827
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:26,229
'cause super agent lundy
has a hunch that

828
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:29,866
The dead woman is connected
to this big serial killer case.

829
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:31,068
- hmm, really?

830
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:35,539
- oh, yeah.
lundy always gets his man.

831
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:39,126
- yeah?

832
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,161
Well, so do i.

833
00:44:46,501 --> 00:44:48,952
- this is where
i first noticed the pattern.

834
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:51,221
Raleigh, north carolina, 1993.

835
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,473
- that got you curious?

836
00:44:53,508 --> 00:44:56,309
- then i found
san francisco, louisville,

837
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:58,729
Detroit, richmond.

838
00:44:58,763 --> 00:45:01,815
Eight different cities in all
that i know of.

839
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:04,518
Never the same place twice.

840
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:08,304
Until now.

841
00:45:08,322 --> 00:45:10,073
Ready for another?

842
00:45:10,108 --> 00:45:12,859
- oh. yeah.

843
00:45:16,164 --> 00:45:18,949
So now this is your
little retirement project?

844
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:22,919
You're completely incapable
of relaxing, aren't you?

845
00:45:22,954 --> 00:45:25,789
- that's just it.
this is how i relax.

846
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:27,007
I get the scent of a bad guy,

847
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:29,793
I can feel
my blood pressure go down.

848
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,261
- and here i thought
i was bad.

849
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,880
- you are.

850
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,100
You're exactly
the same as me,

851
00:45:37,135 --> 00:45:41,388
Just in
a much prettier package.

852
00:45:41,439 --> 00:45:44,107
- are you flirting with me,
agent lundy?

853
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:49,146
- simply stating the truth,
miss.

855
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:02,325

857
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:07,297
Excuse me just a second.

858
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:10,834
Hey.

859
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:14,805
- hey, so you want me
to order some takeout?

860
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:18,141
- i'm still working,

861
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,143
So i'll just
grab something here.

862
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:24,014
- okay, well,
i love you, babe.

863
00:46:24,048 --> 00:46:26,850
- me too.

- ah, jesse, hard at work.
big surprise.

866
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:54,127
I'm gonna wait in your room
and scare the shit out of you.

867

Jesse!

868
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:07,107
If you're in here...

00:47:19,537 --> 00:47:20,603
Andy!

870
00:47:20,621 --> 00:47:22,122
Apparently
i'm not the only one

Who isn't exactly
what he seems.

872
00:47:30,331 --> 00:47:33,250
Is that the wrench you use
to break windows?

873
00:47:33,284 --> 00:47:35,802
- what the heck?
- don't move.

874
00:47:35,836 --> 00:47:37,921
- okay, what's going on?
who are you?

875
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:39,789
- you're gonna stop
breaking things,

876
00:47:39,807 --> 00:47:41,675
Stop rolling cars
down the street.

877
00:47:41,726 --> 00:47:43,977
Stop everything
you've been doing.

878

If you so much as touch
another window,

879
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,681
I will come back here,

880
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:51,935
And i will leave
with your head in a bag.

881
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,404
I already have the bag.

882
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:00,160
- fuck you!

883
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:09,920
Let go of me,
you fucking asshole!

884
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:12,122
Fuck!

885
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:14,007
- you really don't know
what you're doing here.

886
00:48:14,041 --> 00:48:15,675
- i know exactly
what i want to fucking do,

887
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,827
Piece of fucking shit.

888
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:19,679
You should've seen
their faces.

889
00:48:19,714 --> 00:48:23,350
Those boxes in their driveways
with their big fucking

890
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:25,218
Flat-screen tvs.

891
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:28,605
"oh, look at us, aren't we
so fucking rich?"

892
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:30,106
They're lucky
the only thing i broke

893
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:31,942
Was their fucking windows.

894
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:34,527
- and you're lucky i don't
break your fucking neck.

895
00:48:34,562 --> 00:48:36,346
It's over.
- fuck you, it's over.

896
00:48:36,364 --> 00:48:39,065
[groaning]

897
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:44,120
- give up.
- no!

898
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:47,374
I played by the rules
my entire life.

899
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:50,327
And look what it got me.

900
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,363
My wife's dead.
i lost my job.

901
00:48:53,381 --> 00:48:56,699
My son hates me, and now...

902
00:48:56,717 --> 00:48:59,252
The bank wants
to take my house away.

903
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,721
So if you want to take
my fucking head, you take it.

904
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:03,673
- i said stop.

905
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,675
You want me to come back
for your son's head too?

906
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,143
- what? no!

907
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:08,478
Not my boy!

908
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,098
It's all i have!

909
00:49:14,602 --> 00:49:17,720
- you're gonna save
what's left of your family,

910
00:49:17,738 --> 00:49:20,573
Save what's left
of yourself.

911
00:49:20,608 --> 00:49:23,326
Because all that other stuff

912
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:26,246
Is over.

913
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,530
Say it.

914
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:30,500
- yeah, it's over.

915
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:41,344
- bad news for andy
is he's lost his house.

916
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,713
Good news for me is he'll
be out of the neighborhood.

917
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,632
But why should i
care about him?

918
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:46,933
It's his world.

919
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:48,918
People like him
made it this way.

920
00:49:48,936 --> 00:49:51,471
At least he had
a chance to belong.

921
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:03,199
- it's still there, dex.

922
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:06,102
A stain so deep
it can't be erased.

923
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:27,507
- [grunts]

924
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:29,509
[sighs]
