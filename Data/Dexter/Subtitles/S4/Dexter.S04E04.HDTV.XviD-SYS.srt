1
00:01:45,733 --> 00:01:47,284
Previously on dexter...

2
00:01:47,318 --> 00:01:48,869
- dexter.

3
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:50,954
- how's my favorite
serial-killer hunter?

4
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:54,157
- the reason i'm in miami
is because i'm convinced

5
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:57,044
That these bathtub murders
are connected

6
00:01:57,078 --> 00:01:59,612
To a series of murders
all over the country.

7
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:01,682
It's always the same three
kills with trinity.

8
00:02:01,716 --> 00:02:05,552
You got woman
in a bathtub,

9
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:09,973
Followed by a mother
falling to her death...

10
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:12,309
- you're next.

11
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:14,961
- if this is the latest victim
of lundy's trinity killer,

12
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:18,131
Then he's a very different
monster than i am.

13
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:19,650
- lundy has this theory--

14
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:20,800
- you don't work for lundy.

15
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:22,135
You're welcome to pursue this,

16
00:02:22,153 --> 00:02:24,154
But between the vacation murders
and lisa bell,

17
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:25,489
I think
you're gonna be very busy.

18
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:28,575
- yes, i did come to miami
to follow a case,

19
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:31,144
But i have to admit i'm glad
the killer chose this city,

20
00:02:31,162 --> 00:02:32,529
Knowing i'd find you here.

21
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,364
- hey, good news!

22
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:35,449
The sandpiper hotel
wants to book my band

23
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:36,700
For a one-month gig.

24
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,335
Best of all it means
no more time away from you.

25
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:39,670
- wow, that's great.

26
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:40,787
- i'm not gonna tell you
who to date.

27
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:42,005
It's none
of my business.

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,590
But you should know
there's no such thing

29
00:02:43,624 --> 00:02:45,092
As "off the record"
with reporters.

30
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:46,343
So watch the pillow talk
with that woman.

31
00:02:46,377 --> 00:02:48,428
Super-agent lundy
has a hunch

32
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:52,049
That the dead woman is connected
to this big serial killer case.

33
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,000
Lundy always gets his man.

34
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:56,470
- well, so do i.
- [laughs]

35
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:57,971
- look,
i was a little worried

36
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,557
That people
will misinterpret.

37
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,025
- let them misinterpret.

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:04,561
I need this
as much as you do.

39
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:06,697
- the past few weeks,
you have not been

40
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:09,950
The most present
father and husband.

41
00:03:09,984 --> 00:03:12,452
My dark passenger is like
a trapped coal miner,

42
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:14,687
Always helping,
always letting me know

43
00:03:14,706 --> 00:03:18,375
It's still in there,
still alive.

44
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:27,700
[festive music]

45
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:31,221
Everyone needs
a vacation.

46
00:03:31,255 --> 00:03:35,559
In my case, it's time off
for bad behavior.

47
00:03:35,593 --> 00:03:38,929
But i intend to make the most
of this family trip

48
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,897
That they're taking
without me.

49
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,432
- shotgun!
- shotgun!

50
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:44,317
- i called it first.
- i called it inside.

51
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:45,435
- it doesn't count if you
call it inside.

52
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:47,771
- does so!
mom! dexter!

53
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:50,073
- how about you switch
every hour?

54
00:03:50,108 --> 00:03:51,558
- want to trade places?

55
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,160
I stay home and...

56
00:03:53,194 --> 00:03:55,395
You can stuff cousin marlene
into some spanx

57
00:03:55,413 --> 00:03:56,613
On her wedding day.

58
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:58,532
- i wish i could,
but things are pretty hectic

59
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:00,283
At the station.

60
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:02,002
- you're not gonna work
the whole time, are you?

61
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:03,670
- i'll try not to.

62
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:05,922
- you can't let yourself get
to that boiling point again.

63
00:04:05,957 --> 00:04:07,624
It's not healthy.

64
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:10,210
And i'd rather not have to lie
to the neighbor again

65
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:13,013
If you decide to smash
any more security lights.

66
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,432
- i hate that you
saw me that way.

67
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:16,683
- i'm your wife.

68
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,518
I want to know
what's going on inside you.

69
00:04:18,553 --> 00:04:20,637
- i don't think you do.

70
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,422
Just recharge your batteries,
all right?

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,107
Enjoy your freedom.

72
00:04:24,142 --> 00:04:25,275
Go wild.

73
00:04:25,309 --> 00:04:27,477
- right...go wild.

74
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:30,597
- have fun.

75
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,765
Say, "good-bye, dexter."
all: good-bye, dexter!

76
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:35,602
- good-bye, dexter!
bye-bye.

77
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:42,125
- the kids left you a present
in the kitchen.

78
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:59,959
- just the thing to melt
a father's heart.

79
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,794
Let the good times roll.

80
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:04,797
[festive music]

81
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:08,735
Whoops!

82
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:09,969
Three days.

83
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:14,858
72 precious hours
to recharge my batteries.

84
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:16,976
'course rita doesn't know
i'll be recharging

85
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:20,197
With another woman.

86
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:21,781
Officer zoey kruger.

87
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:24,984
Pembroke pines patrol.

88
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:28,154
Eight months ago, officer
kruger's husband and daughter

89
00:05:28,172 --> 00:05:30,040
Were killed
during a home invasion.

90
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:33,493
Zoey was shot
in the arm and foot.

91
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:36,429
She survived...obviously.

92
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:38,882
But there was one person
who thought it was zoey herself

93
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:42,669
Who killed her family.

94
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:46,940
The one person who always knows
the truth of a crime--

95
00:05:46,974 --> 00:05:48,341
The blood guy.

96
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,943
[knocking at door]

97
00:05:49,977 --> 00:05:52,178
- morgan. good to see
a friendly face.

98
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:53,730
Aren't many around here.

99
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,700
- nice to have
an excuse to visit.

100
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:58,201
Even if i made it up.

101
00:05:58,236 --> 00:05:59,686
- with your caseload,

102
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:00,954
I can't believe you have time
to write a paper

103
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:02,372
On feathering
in blood swipes.

104
00:06:02,406 --> 00:06:04,875
- i have a small window for...

105
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,459
Uh, a side project.

106
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:09,412
I remembered at the
spatter conference last spring,

107
00:06:09,463 --> 00:06:11,698
You mentioned something about
a questionable swipe

108
00:06:11,716 --> 00:06:12,716
In a case
you were working.

109
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,033
Who was it, cooper?

110
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:18,054
- kruger, and shh--
we don't talk about that.

111
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:30,433
- zoey's husband--
shot in the stairway.

112
00:06:32,904 --> 00:06:36,556
Her daughter,
in her bedroom.

113
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:39,276
Zoey said
she was shot twice

114
00:06:39,327 --> 00:06:41,394
Wrestling the shooter's gun
from him.

115
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:46,399
And turned it on him
as he fled.

116
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:50,236
- that blood swipe

117
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:51,454
Belongs to darius rae,

118
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:53,790
A drug dealer zoey
roughed up

119
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:55,542
The day before
her family was murdered.

120
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:56,626
According to her,

121
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:58,595
She winged him
in her front hallway.

122
00:06:58,629 --> 00:06:59,963
- the feathering
is textbook.

123
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:01,298
Why'd you say
it was questionable?

124
00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:03,099
- because it's the only blood
of rae's

125
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:05,435
Anywhere at the scene.

126
00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:07,587
- interesting.

127
00:07:07,605 --> 00:07:08,921
For my paper.

128
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,141
- my theory?

129
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:13,643
Uh, forget it.
doesn't matter.

130
00:07:13,694 --> 00:07:16,262
- you think she planted
the blood herself?

131
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,264
- maybe she even provoked

132
00:07:18,282 --> 00:07:20,483
That confrontation
with darius rae.

133
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:22,285
- that's where
she got his blood.

134
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,538
- also gives her the perfect
narrative for the crime.

135
00:07:25,573 --> 00:07:27,741
Rae breaks in looking
for retribution,

136
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:30,327
Cop's family becomes
collateral damage.

137
00:07:30,378 --> 00:07:32,712
- was darius rae
ever arrested?

138
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,497
- darius rae
was gunned down

139
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:37,584
In a supposedly
gang-related incident.

140
00:07:37,618 --> 00:07:39,219
But that's
another theory,

141
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:40,837
Another day.

142
00:07:40,888 --> 00:07:42,789
I try not
to think about it.

143
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:44,808
Because if i'm right,

144
00:07:44,842 --> 00:07:46,977
There's a monster
walking around free.

145
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:51,014
- with a badge
and a gun.

146
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:52,965
Zoey said she aimed
at darius rae

147
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:58,021
But only winged him.

148
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:00,473
But zoey always
hits her targets.

149
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:03,493
Just ask her husband
and daughter.

150
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:06,029
I'm feeling
recharged already.

151
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:11,001
Monsters come
in all shapes and sizes.

152
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:12,619
Sometimes
it's the very people

153
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:14,537
Who are supposed to be
protecting us:

154
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:16,840
A cop, a parent,

155
00:08:16,874 --> 00:08:20,377
The spatter guy.

156
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,131
- god, close the door,
will you?

157
00:08:25,165 --> 00:08:27,017
Here's a bludgeoning
from july.

158
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:29,519
- the one we're looking for
will be five days

159
00:08:29,553 --> 00:08:31,604
After the suicide.
- right.

160
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,273
Here's a middle-aged guy
from october...

161
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,558
- sorry, i thought
this was my lab.

162
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:37,610
- we're hiding
from laguerta.

163
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,896
- quinn's reporter fuck buddy
has now officially

164
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:42,148
Fucked all three of us.

165
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:44,567
- "catching
the vacation murderer

166
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:46,569
"may not be
the department's top priority.

167
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,656
"detectives spent last thursday
indulging the pursuits

168
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,124
"of retired fbi man hunter

169
00:08:51,158 --> 00:08:52,992
Frank lundy."

170
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:54,327
It's a good picture.

171
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:55,962
- i'm guessing that
lieutenant laguerta's

172
00:08:55,996 --> 00:08:59,332
Open-door policy with me...
is about to close.

173
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:03,035
- we've got to narrow down
trinity's next move.

174
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:04,504
- bludgeoning.

175
00:09:04,538 --> 00:09:05,839
Final kill in his cycle?

176
00:09:05,873 --> 00:09:08,058
- and he's repeating his pattern
from 30 years ago,

177
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:11,177
So if we can find where
he bludgeoned back then--

178
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:13,146
- then maybe we can keep
the next trinity victim

179
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,183
From becoming
the next trinity victim.

180
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,652
- where's masuka?

181
00:09:19,687 --> 00:09:21,654
- on vacation?

182
00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:25,608
- he's probably in mexico
taking a donkey show tour.

183
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,027
- there's a briefing
in five minutes.

184
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:29,112
Agent lundy...

185
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:30,864
- my visitor's badge
is expired?

186
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:33,833
- sorry.

187
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:36,252
- crap. fuck.

188
00:09:36,287 --> 00:09:38,254
I guess we'll have to stake out
potential bludgeoning sites

189
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,589
On my off hours.

190
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,257
- hey.

191
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:44,427
I don't want this theory of mine
to jeopardize your job.

192
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:47,097
- i want in on this.

193
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:49,132
- well, okay then.

194
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:51,601
- okay then.

195
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,111
- you ever feel like you're
this close to nabbing somebody?

196
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:05,431
- sometime
in the next 67 hours.

197
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:09,285
- it's a good feeling.

198
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:27,453
- oh, my god!

199
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:29,672
I can't believe
he posted that.

200
00:10:29,723 --> 00:10:31,925
- you are so busted.
- i'm busted?

201
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,343
Okay, it's totally
photoshopped.

202
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:35,595
The point is,
it looks real, so...

203
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:37,430
- you're busted!
[giggles]

204
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:40,650
- shh!

205
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,833
- i know, i know,

206
00:10:56,867 --> 00:11:01,254
My dick's been
making some bad decisions.

207
00:11:01,288 --> 00:11:02,822
- so according to
quinn's girlfriend,

208
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,175
These vacation murders
are costing the city

209
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:08,928
900,000 tourist dollars
a day.

210
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:11,548
- well, at least the article
got the tip line ringing.

211
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:12,882
Those assholes can't hide

212
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,934
With all those eyes
on them.

213
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:17,437
- well, those eyes
are on us too.

214
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,556
[sighs]

215
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:22,108
- uh-oh.

216
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,810
- what...oh?

217
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:26,729
- that sigh thing
you do when, you know,

218
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,314
There's something
i'm not gonna like.

219
00:11:28,348 --> 00:11:30,984
- i don't do
a sigh thing.

220
00:11:31,018 --> 00:11:34,320
- okay, you don't.

221
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:36,956
What was it that
you were gonna say?

222
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:42,295
- [sighs]

223
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:46,082
I think we should inform the
brass about our relationship.

224
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:48,301
Look, it's just
a formality.

225
00:11:48,335 --> 00:11:50,970
Paperwork.
entirely confidential.

226
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:52,388
- it's none
of their business.

227
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:55,308
- it's department policy
for good reason.

228
00:11:55,342 --> 00:11:57,977
We will catch these killers,

229
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:00,263
And a defense attorney
could use the details

230
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,065
Of an off-the-books romance
between us

231
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:04,234
To sensationalize the case,
distract the jury--

232
00:12:04,268 --> 00:12:08,354
- if they find out.

233
00:12:08,388 --> 00:12:11,608
- on a death penalty case.

234
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,276
- okay,
they will find out.

235
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:14,560
But not for a while.

236
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:17,413
And what would we even
report to the brass?

237
00:12:17,448 --> 00:12:18,581
- well, that we're
seeing each other.

238
00:12:18,616 --> 00:12:23,620
- what does that mean?

239
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:25,204
- what do you think
it means?

240
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:28,091
- it means it's new.

241
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:29,709
We're still figuring it out.

242
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,794
- so this could just be
a passing thing.

243
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:33,429
- no, it's not
a passing thing.

244
00:12:33,464 --> 00:12:36,432
- then what is it?

245
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:40,853
- i don't know.

246
00:12:40,888 --> 00:12:43,773
- well, i don't know
either.

247
00:12:43,807 --> 00:12:45,608
- i'm confused.
- yeah.

248
00:12:45,643 --> 00:12:50,096
I can see that.

249
00:12:50,114 --> 00:12:54,901
- can we just...wait?

250
00:12:54,935 --> 00:12:57,904
- fine.

251
00:13:10,217 --> 00:13:12,785
- as a cop, zoey has been
to plenty of crime scenes.

252
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:14,837
She knows
what should be there.

253
00:13:14,888 --> 00:13:17,140
And what shouldn't.

254
00:13:17,174 --> 00:13:19,792
No prints
in the blood on the door,

255
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,296
Which means
she wore gloves.

256
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:30,353
She was still wearing gloves
when she shot herself.

257
00:13:30,404 --> 00:13:32,822
But they were gone when
the emts arrived.

258
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:35,608
Where'd you leave
those gloves, zoey?

259
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:41,247
- easier to think here,
isn't it?

260
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:44,033
Only 52 hours
of freedom left.

261
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,536
You sure chose an interesting
person to spend it on.

262
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:47,837
- don't read
anything into it.

263
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:51,424
Zoey was a challenge,
that's all.

264
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,508
- a woman who wiped out
her own family

265
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:56,162
In order to be free.

266
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,513
- she should have
shot herself

267
00:13:57,548 --> 00:14:00,216
Instead of
her husband and child.

268
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:03,436
- yeah...except that doesn't
get her free.

269
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,937
Just dead.

270
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:07,023
- well,
she had other options.

271
00:14:07,057 --> 00:14:08,941
- alimony.
visitation.

272
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:12,528
Trading off holidays--
there go your weekends.

273
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:15,114
- fine, she could have
moved away.

274
00:14:15,149 --> 00:14:18,317
- and forfeit her job,
her home?

275
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:20,953
Her only option was to make
her vacation from her family

276
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:22,488
As permanent as possible.

277
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:27,460
- there are
always alternatives.

278
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,796
- why do you think
trinity's been so successful?

279
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,799
- he travels a lot.

280
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,200
Stays on the move.

281
00:14:34,218 --> 00:14:37,387
- he doesn't have a family.

282
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:40,039
- well, i do.

283
00:14:40,057 --> 00:14:44,977
- miss them yet?

284
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:47,263
- all right,
trinity used a hammer

285
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:48,431
In portland
and in fresno,

286
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:52,902
But wasn't it a tire iron
in albuquerque?

287
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,824
Okay, all right.

288
00:14:57,858 --> 00:15:00,893
We'll go with the dude that
was pulverized by the hammer.

289
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:04,580
Where was that?

290
00:15:04,615 --> 00:15:06,582
Okay, what time tomorrow?

291
00:15:06,617 --> 00:15:10,837
Great.

292
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:12,755
Pad thai, my favorite.
- mmm.

293
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,041
How's frank lundy?

294
00:15:15,075 --> 00:15:16,292
- i didn't say
that was lundy.

295
00:15:16,343 --> 00:15:17,510
- oh, your voice did.

296
00:15:17,544 --> 00:15:19,929
It goes up a notch every time
you talk to him,

297
00:15:19,963 --> 00:15:22,298
Which you're doing
a lot of lately.

298
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:24,350
- your point?

299
00:15:24,384 --> 00:15:27,419
- i get a gig in town
to spend more time with you.

300
00:15:27,438 --> 00:15:31,590
You spend all your time
with your ex.

301
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:35,061
- our relationship
is strictly professional.

302
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:48,574
- you twist your hair
when you talk to him?

303
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:50,109
- you have nothing
to be jealous of

304
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:52,044
When it comes
to frank lundy.

305
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,965
All right?

306
00:16:04,675 --> 00:16:07,310
- poker night at home.

307
00:16:07,344 --> 00:16:09,295
Zoey's police family
surrounds her

308
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:11,481
On and off the job.

309
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:13,966
Between her buddy system
and her security system,

310
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:18,154
Her house will be difficult
to break in tonight.

311
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:21,324
But not tomorrow.

312
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,964
- [whistles]

313
00:16:53,056 --> 00:16:55,892
- [belches]

314
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:04,901
- cunt.

315
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:06,736
- what the hell
did you just say?

316
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:08,821
- you're a cunt!

317
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:10,689
- [laughs]

318
00:17:10,707 --> 00:17:12,241
Fuck off, old man.

319
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:15,878
- fucking pussy.

320
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:20,800
[groans]

321
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:25,054
- you looking to get
the shit kicked out of you?

322
00:17:25,088 --> 00:17:27,890
- [whimpers]
faggot!

323
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:31,727
[whimpers]

324
00:17:31,762 --> 00:17:34,480
- you gonna shut up now?

325
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:35,848
- faggot.

326
00:17:35,882 --> 00:17:40,353
Faggot.
[grunts]

327
00:17:40,387 --> 00:17:43,906
[moans]

328
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:50,529
It's your fault.

329
00:17:50,563 --> 00:17:52,531
- the fuck
is wrong with you?

330
00:17:52,565 --> 00:17:57,036
- all your fault.

331
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,406
[coughs]

332
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:05,744
- the living room is here
to the left,

333
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:06,963
Kitchen in the back,

334
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:10,299
And way out back
is the hot tub.

335
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,935
Oh, welcome, welcome,
welcome.

336
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:15,388
Oh, you're gonna love
this house.

337
00:18:15,422 --> 00:18:16,772
[laughs]

338
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:19,942
Newer construction,
only one previous owner,

339
00:18:19,977 --> 00:18:21,861
All sorts of upgrades.

340
00:18:21,895 --> 00:18:24,947
Come on, let me show you
its special wonders.

341
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:26,699
- uh, would it be all right

342
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:29,118
If i discovered those
special wonders on my own?

343
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:31,120
- any questions,
just holler.

344
00:18:31,154 --> 00:18:34,740
- okay.

345
00:18:34,774 --> 00:18:36,492
I do have one question.

346
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:38,610
Where did zoey
stash her gloves?

347
00:18:38,629 --> 00:18:39,712
I'm sure
they're long gone,

348
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:43,833
But they could have left
trace evidence.

349
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:49,088
She swiped the door
with blood here...

350
00:18:49,122 --> 00:18:52,558
Shoots herself,
collapses...

351
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:57,146
Crawls toward the kitchen
to call 911.

352
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:06,188
Did she burn them?

353
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:07,823
If the gloves melted,
there would be residue

354
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:11,193
On the underside
of the grate.

355
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:15,147
- it's just for show.

356
00:19:15,165 --> 00:19:18,000
Who needs a fire
in this climate?

357
00:19:18,035 --> 00:19:20,119
I'm zoey. i live here.
- hey.

358
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:21,587
- i just thought
i'd stop by,

359
00:19:21,621 --> 00:19:22,788
See how the open house
was going.

360
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,874
- oh.
it's a nice place.

361
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:25,991
- thanks.

362
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:27,259
- family friendly.

363
00:19:27,294 --> 00:19:30,012
- mm.

364
00:19:30,047 --> 00:19:34,550
I'll be glad to give you
a tour if you're interested.

365
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:36,852
- very interested.

366
00:19:36,887 --> 00:19:39,388
- okay, follow me.

367
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:47,113
- wow, my daughter would
go crazy over this room.

368
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:49,782
- it's a little girl's
dream.

369
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:52,118
- may i ask
why you're selling?

370
00:19:52,152 --> 00:19:54,987
- my husband and i
are separated.

371
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,789
Now our daughter's
with him.

372
00:19:56,823 --> 00:19:58,958
- so you're single.

373
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:02,795
- i am.

374
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:05,881
You've been married long?

375
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:10,419
- uh, yes,
about six months.

376
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,205
Ah, that came out wrong.
- [laughs]

377
00:20:13,223 --> 00:20:16,475
I understand.
believe me.

378
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,811
- zoey, there's a couple here
who have a question

379
00:20:18,845 --> 00:20:20,062
About the hot tub.

380
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:23,215
- okay,
i'll be right down.

381
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:24,683
To be continued.

382
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:27,719
- sure.

383
00:20:32,943 --> 00:20:37,997
A little girl's dream...

384
00:20:40,117 --> 00:20:42,952
Follow the blood.

385
00:20:43,003 --> 00:20:46,255
Follow the blood...

386
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:47,957
Zoey crawled
into the kitchen,

387
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:50,409
Grabbed the counter
to pull herself up,

388
00:20:50,427 --> 00:20:52,578
Then reached
for the phone,

389
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:56,265
Giving her
a perfect opportunity

390
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:59,385
To use
the garbage disposal.

391
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:15,568
- how we doing in here?

392
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:17,620
- uh, there seems to be
a problem with the disposal.

393
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:21,607
- oh.
[sighs]

394
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,626
Oh, no, no, no.

395
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,794
- it's probably just
something jammed in there.

396
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,412
It's an easy fix.

397
00:21:26,446 --> 00:21:27,613
Let me take a look.

398
00:21:27,631 --> 00:21:31,834
- you'd do that?
- sure.

399
00:21:54,157 --> 00:21:55,407
Blue nitrile.

400
00:21:55,442 --> 00:22:00,779
The same material found
in police protective gloves.

401
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:05,201
If the glove fits...

402
00:22:13,376 --> 00:22:15,344
- isn't he a doll?

403
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:18,547
Fixing the disposal.
- huh.

404
00:22:18,598 --> 00:22:20,382
Wasn't broken this morning.

405
00:22:20,433 --> 00:22:21,851
- give it a try.

406
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,103
- all right.

407
00:22:24,137 --> 00:22:26,188
- yay!

408
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:31,810
- if i was your wife,

409
00:22:31,844 --> 00:22:33,946
I'd hang on to you.

410
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,315
You're so...handy.

411
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:40,236
- [chuckles]

412
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:43,706
- so it's either

413
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,909
The cannery bludgeoning
or the bar beating.

414
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,878
- the cannery body
was a dump.

415
00:22:48,912 --> 00:22:50,462
Trinity's not a dumper.

416
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:53,666
He picks a location,
takes his victims there.

417
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:54,884
- so it's the bar.

418
00:22:54,918 --> 00:22:57,703
- hmm.

419
00:22:57,721 --> 00:22:59,255
- fuckin' a.

420
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:03,392
We've found trinity's
30-year-old kill site.

421
00:23:03,426 --> 00:23:06,228
Oh! oh, no, oh!
- here, here, here.

422
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:09,047
- fuck me.
- take the file, take the file.

423
00:23:09,065 --> 00:23:11,400
No harm.
[clears throat]

424
00:23:11,434 --> 00:23:14,520
Um, mind if i...?

425
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:17,523
- yeah, sure,
why don't you?

426
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:28,250
So, uh, 30 years ago,

427
00:23:28,285 --> 00:23:30,402
A father of two
was bludgeoned to death

428
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,505
Between the hours
of 7:00 and 10:00 p.m.

429
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,375
In the bathroom
of murphy's tavern.

430
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:39,261
- which is where
i'll be today.

431
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:41,213
- me too.

432
00:23:41,247 --> 00:23:44,433
- won't that be a problem
with ashton?

433
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:46,084
- anton.

434
00:23:46,102 --> 00:23:51,590
And, no,
he's cool...sort of.

435
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:53,559
- sort of?

436
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:58,314
- he gets jealous
for no reason.

437
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:01,367
- he's a smart man.

438
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:10,542
- look, don't make me come up
with thought bubbles

439
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:14,413
To put over those silent looks
of yours.

440
00:24:14,447 --> 00:24:19,168
Just say
what you're thinking.

441
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:22,838
- all right.

442
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:26,976
I, uh, i thought i could keep
my feelings for you

443
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,980
As background noise
to this investigation.

444
00:24:31,014 --> 00:24:35,067
But, in working with you,

445
00:24:35,101 --> 00:24:40,072
That noise has gotten...

446
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:43,776
- loud?

447
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,946
- deafening.

448
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,817
But they're my feelings.

449
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:54,837
- yup.

450
00:24:54,871 --> 00:24:58,657
They're your feelings.

451
00:24:58,675 --> 00:25:02,544
- you're in
a committed relationship.

452
00:25:02,595 --> 00:25:05,097
- i am.

453
00:25:05,131 --> 00:25:09,018
- and i would hate to...

454
00:25:09,052 --> 00:25:10,106
- i'd hate that too.

455
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,058
Jesus.

456
00:25:20,113 --> 00:25:22,565
I've gotta go.

457
00:25:28,521 --> 00:25:32,325
- will i see you
tonight?

458
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:35,995
- i don't...

459
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:39,332
Fuck!

460
00:25:47,925 --> 00:25:49,842
- is there a break
in the vacation murders case?

461
00:25:49,876 --> 00:25:55,064
- i'm having intimate relations
with laguerta.

462
00:25:55,098 --> 00:25:56,515
- congratulations?

463
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:59,718
- i need some advice.

464
00:25:59,736 --> 00:26:03,722
- huh, lot of wise people
out there.

465
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,158
- i don't trust anyone else
with this secret.

466
00:26:06,193 --> 00:26:08,110
- that's too bad.

467
00:26:08,161 --> 00:26:11,330
- maria has awakened...

468
00:26:11,365 --> 00:26:12,865
<i>mi pasion.</i>

469
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:14,083
- right.

470
00:26:14,117 --> 00:26:17,236
- when i'm with her,
i feel like a man.

471
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:20,172
Like my heart
is blossoming.

472
00:26:20,207 --> 00:26:21,591
- that's a problem?
- no.

473
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:24,377
The problem is
she wants to disclose

474
00:26:24,411 --> 00:26:26,095
Our relationship
to the higher-ups--

475
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:29,081
Which i--i understand
is a formality.

476
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:32,602
I just hate the thought
of them knowing.

477
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:34,770
- 'cause you're
embarrassed.

478
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:37,974
- because once
you define it, it's defined.

479
00:26:38,025 --> 00:26:41,110
It's--it's officially
official.

480
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,928
- you're her boyfriend.
- exactly.

481
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:44,697
- next thing you know,
you're moving in,

482
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:47,316
Your life is gone, and
it's just kids and neighbors

483
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:50,653
And painted mugs.

484
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:52,788
- painted mugs?
- it's a metaphor.

485
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,407
- for what?

486
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:57,293
- look, if you want out,
get out.

487
00:26:57,327 --> 00:26:59,712
Before you have to do
something drastic.

488
00:26:59,746 --> 00:27:02,614
- i don't want out.
i don't.

489
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,750
I just want to protect it

490
00:27:04,784 --> 00:27:06,285
By keeping it private.

491
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:07,953
- yeah.

492
00:27:07,971 --> 00:27:11,140
- who knew it would matter
so much to me?

493
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:12,675
<i>thanks, socio.</i>

494
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:16,762
I'll keep you posted
on the details.

495
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:19,765
- great.

496
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:29,408
I am a stickler
for details.

497
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,478
- you still dating
that she-bag reporter?

498
00:27:32,496 --> 00:27:34,080
Is it that hard
for you to get laid?

499
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:35,665
- i'm not--
- after she put

500
00:27:35,699 --> 00:27:37,316
Lundy's name in the paper
and ruined everything?

501
00:27:37,334 --> 00:27:39,368
- i'm not seeing her.

502
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,953
- maybe you should have
told her that.

503
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:45,541
News flash, quinn:
you're an idiot.

504
00:27:45,592 --> 00:27:48,327
- yeah, i got
your messages.

505
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:50,379
- but you didn't
call me back.

506
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,932
- tell me, is this conversation
gonna end up in the paper too?

507
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:54,850
'cause you have no idea the
shitstorm you've gotten me into.

508
00:27:54,885 --> 00:27:56,852
- i'm sorry.

509
00:27:56,887 --> 00:28:02,341
Really, but...
we can work this out.

510
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:05,027
- i'm not interested
in working it out.

511
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:06,362
- don't say that.

512
00:28:06,396 --> 00:28:10,733
- come on, it's not like
this was a big deal.

513
00:28:10,784 --> 00:28:16,622
- don't you dare tell me
there's nothing here.

514
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:19,458
- you're right, i won't.

515
00:28:19,493 --> 00:28:24,863
But it's way too
complicated.

516
00:28:24,881 --> 00:28:26,882
- i don't want to lose you.

517
00:28:26,917 --> 00:28:30,636
- christine.
you never had me.

518
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,672
Find yourself
another source.

519
00:28:43,049 --> 00:28:45,601
- on vacation,
we buy snow globes,

520
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:48,571
Send postcards to preserve
the good times,

521
00:28:48,605 --> 00:28:51,407
Remind us where we've been.

522
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:56,078
Zoey's crime scene
had its own memento...

523
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:59,081
A glove whose rolled cuff
preserved the gunshot residue

524
00:28:59,116 --> 00:29:04,069
After she shot herself.

525
00:29:04,087 --> 00:29:06,422
And blood.

526
00:29:06,456 --> 00:29:09,925
Odds are it belongs to
the late darius rae.

527
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,795
Ah, zoey,
wish you were here.

528
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:15,381
But since you're not...

529
00:29:15,415 --> 00:29:17,516
I'll come to you.

530
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,602
I should get to pembroke pines
just in time

531
00:29:19,636 --> 00:29:22,521
To follow
officer kruger home.

532
00:29:23,774 --> 00:29:29,195
- original structure
was a single-story tavern.

533
00:29:29,229 --> 00:29:31,730
Current building--

534
00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:34,099
12 floors, mostly vacant.

535
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:58,641
- i'm found.

536
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:19,445
- lobby's open 24 hours,
guard on duty,

537
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,413
Too much foot traffic--
trinity would have to choose

538
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,699
Another floor.

539
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:25,167
- so sorry.

540
00:30:25,202 --> 00:30:26,952
I wasn't watching
where i was going.

541
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:29,988
- no damage done.

542
00:30:38,498 --> 00:30:41,667
Excuse me.

543
00:30:43,803 --> 00:30:47,172
You dropped these.

544
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,192
- thanks.

545
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:08,410
Bus number 432.

546
00:31:08,461 --> 00:31:11,297
White male, maybe 6'4",

547
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:14,032
200, 220 pounds,

548
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,001
Age around 60,

549
00:31:16,035 --> 00:31:20,339
Hair gray, eyes blue...

550
00:31:20,373 --> 00:31:23,375
Something in them.

551
00:31:28,932 --> 00:31:32,101
- maybe i do miss
rita and the kids...

552
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:33,402
[line rings]

553
00:31:33,436 --> 00:31:35,053
- [baby cries]
- hello?

554
00:31:35,071 --> 00:31:36,322
- hi, it's me.

555
00:31:36,356 --> 00:31:37,889
- oh, uh,
hey, guys, keep it down.

556
00:31:37,908 --> 00:31:39,441
- i was just checking in.

557
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,577
- oh, we have the rehearsal
dinner in 20 minutes,

558
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:44,396
And--astor, your dress
is getting wrinkled.

559
00:31:44,414 --> 00:31:45,998
- sounds like
you got your hands--

560
00:31:46,032 --> 00:31:47,082
- hey, cody.
[indistinct]

561
00:31:47,117 --> 00:31:48,400
I'm sorry,
what were you saying?

562
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:50,669
- i was just saying
you probably have your hands--

563
00:31:50,704 --> 00:31:52,121
- mom, cody pulled
my barrettes out.

564
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:53,756
- it was an accident.

565
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,791
- you took them
right off my head.

566
00:31:55,842 --> 00:31:58,427
- i'm sorry, i didn't hear
what you were saying.

567
00:31:58,461 --> 00:31:59,762
- it was...nothing.

568
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:02,298
- uh, we gotta go.
love you.

569
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:03,716
- me...
[dial tone]

570
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,752
Too.

571
00:32:10,307 --> 00:32:13,809
[siren whoops]

572
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,194
Shit!

573
00:32:15,228 --> 00:32:17,646
Going the speed limit,
hands-free dialing,

574
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:18,864
No violations.

575
00:32:18,898 --> 00:32:22,234
[siren wailing]

576
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:33,212
This is bad.

577
00:32:33,246 --> 00:32:35,047
What a coincidence.

578
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:38,083
- out of the vehicle,
please.

579
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:45,424
Hands on the hood,
please.

580
00:32:48,928 --> 00:32:52,898
- my wife and i changed
our mind about buying a house.

581
00:32:52,932 --> 00:32:57,019
- dexter morgan.

582
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,473
You didn't mention that you were
a, uh, spatter analyst,

583
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:05,143
Miami metro.

584
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:09,081
- didn't seem relevant
to house hunting.

585
00:33:09,115 --> 00:33:12,368
- hmm.

586
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:15,087
Well, the file clerk
at my station--

587
00:33:15,121 --> 00:33:16,822
He's a friend.

588
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,791
He told me that sam
had pulled my case file,

589
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:21,960
And sam told me he'd
loaned it to a colleague.

590
00:33:21,994 --> 00:33:24,680
You can imagine my surprise
when i looked up that colleague

591
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:27,182
And saw your face.

592
00:33:27,217 --> 00:33:29,184
- i am writing a paper
on blood swipes.

593
00:33:29,219 --> 00:33:31,387
- are you
getting off on this?

594
00:33:31,438 --> 00:33:33,222
- am i supposed to be?

595
00:33:33,273 --> 00:33:35,224
- you're the kind of sicko
who likes watching

596
00:33:35,275 --> 00:33:38,227
A woman in pain?

597
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:41,847
- not that kind of sicko, no.

598
00:33:41,865 --> 00:33:45,350
- i lost my husband.

599
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:49,538
I watched my child die
in front of me.

600
00:33:49,572 --> 00:33:52,574
Do you have any idea
how agonizing that was?

601
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:55,193
- agony would be
the normal reaction.

602
00:33:55,211 --> 00:33:58,630
- i will not let
that wound be reopened.

603
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:05,003
Do you understand?

604
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:13,812
Traffic's heavy
on brickell.

605
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:15,981
Might want to avoid it
on your way home.

606
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:18,383
Was, uh,

607
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:21,653
3319 meadow lane,
right?

608
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:25,223
I'm letting you off
with a warning.

609
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:29,445
Drive carefully.

610
00:34:35,085 --> 00:34:37,068
- i'm calling it off.

611
00:34:37,087 --> 00:34:38,620
- you can't.

612
00:34:38,671 --> 00:34:40,839
She knows who you are.

613
00:34:40,874 --> 00:34:43,675
- she knows who dexter morgan
lab geek is.

614
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,260
- she knows where you live,

615
00:34:45,295 --> 00:34:47,096
Where your wife and children
will be when they get home

616
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,380
In 48 hours.

617
00:34:48,414 --> 00:34:51,633
- if i back off,
she backs off.

618
00:34:51,684 --> 00:34:53,852
- still leaves you
on the radar of a killer cop

619
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:56,188
Who has no qualms
about shooting her family,

620
00:34:56,222 --> 00:34:57,756
Much less a lab rat.

621
00:34:57,774 --> 00:34:59,057
- she's stalking me.

622
00:34:59,091 --> 00:35:01,360
Taking her by surprise will be
out of the question.

623
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:05,647
- you're the one
who wanted a challenge.

624
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:10,869
And now you've
batted the beehive.

625
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:11,870
[beeps]

626
00:35:11,905 --> 00:35:13,655
- dexter,
frank lundy here.

627
00:35:13,706 --> 00:35:15,207
Sorry to bother you
at home.

628
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:17,209
I was just trying to reach
your sister.

629
00:35:17,243 --> 00:35:18,794
Thought
she was maybe with you.

630
00:35:18,828 --> 00:35:24,115
I had an interesting
encounter today.

631
00:35:24,134 --> 00:35:27,669
- me too.

632
00:35:32,675 --> 00:35:36,812
- gotta admit,
she is impressive.

633
00:35:36,846 --> 00:35:38,296
Makes you wonder
why someone like her

634
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:41,150
Ever got married and had kids
in the first place.

635
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:45,571
- someone like her?

636
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:49,658
Someone like her
needs to be in control.

637
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,663
- and she thinks she is.

638
00:35:54,697 --> 00:35:57,666
- she won't see me coming.

639
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,288
[phone rings]

640
00:36:03,322 --> 00:36:05,040
- pembroke pines
police department.

641
00:36:05,091 --> 00:36:06,592
- records, please?

642
00:36:06,626 --> 00:36:10,161
- transferring.

643
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,664
- records,
langsbury speaking.

644
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:15,350
- uh, yeah,
this is miami metro forensics.

645
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:19,221
I wanted to request copies
of a suspect's file.

646
00:36:19,272 --> 00:36:20,939
- suspect's name?

647
00:36:20,974 --> 00:36:23,108
- uh, darius rae.

648
00:36:23,142 --> 00:36:25,010
That's rae with an e.

649
00:36:25,028 --> 00:36:29,481
Drug dealer and alleged killer
of zoey kruger's family.

650
00:36:29,515 --> 00:36:30,983
- what is this
in regard to?

651
00:36:31,017 --> 00:36:35,404
- i--we're--it involves
the vacation murders case.

652
00:36:35,455 --> 00:36:37,522
- i'll send the file over.

653
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,124
To whose attention?

654
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:43,361
- just, uh, forensics.

655
00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:49,718
Batting the beehive.

656
00:36:56,309 --> 00:36:58,644
- dexter.

657
00:37:07,353 --> 00:37:08,570
I know everything.

658
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:11,723
- i'm gonna choose
not to misinterpret that.

659
00:37:11,741 --> 00:37:15,577
- when angel said
he told you about us, i was...

660
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:17,195
Angry, to say the least.

661
00:37:17,229 --> 00:37:20,082
- i really didn't
want to know.

662
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:22,618
- but now you do.
- yeah.

663
00:37:22,669 --> 00:37:24,586
- actually,
i'm glad because

664
00:37:24,621 --> 00:37:28,874
I could really use
a man's opinion on how to handle

665
00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:31,409
Our relationship.

666
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:36,465
Or fling, or whatever it is
that he and i are doing naked.

667
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:38,934
- well, i was just
going to lunch.

668
00:37:38,968 --> 00:37:42,521
- that's great.

669
00:37:42,555 --> 00:37:44,890
Beth's cafe sound good?

670
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:49,945
- oh, actually,
we should just talk here.

671
00:37:49,979 --> 00:37:51,813
It's more private.

672
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:54,816
- yeah.

673
00:37:57,704 --> 00:38:00,739
Angel's a great cop.
the best i know.

674
00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:04,409
But he doesn't understand
the politics in this building.

675
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:08,463
And we have to manage
how this thing becomes public.

676
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:11,550
And if it's handled wrong,
our jobs could be at risk.

677
00:38:11,584 --> 00:38:16,638
And we can't take
that chance.

678
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:20,809
- i...never leave anything
to chance.

679
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,651
- thank you.

680
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:31,636
You're getting good
at this relationship stuff.

681
00:38:31,654 --> 00:38:35,574
Mm, marriage agrees
with you.

682
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:38,193
Thank you.

683
00:38:41,998 --> 00:38:44,166
- lundy called last night.
he was trying to reach you.

684
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,951
- [laughs]

685
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:49,421
That is just so...

686
00:38:49,455 --> 00:38:54,325
Fucking great.

687
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:57,379
- okay.

688
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:11,176
Looks like
the beehive is buzzing.

689
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:13,311
And here comes the sting.

690
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:38,220
You're out of your
jurisdiction, officer kruger.

691
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:53,885
Wait for it.

692
00:39:58,608 --> 00:40:00,075
- [stammers]
what are you doing?

693
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:01,893
- you want info
on darius rae?

694
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:03,078
Ask me anything.

695
00:40:03,112 --> 00:40:05,914
- that file was
for a case i'm working.

696
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:09,501
- i asked you nicely
to leave me alone.

697
00:40:09,535 --> 00:40:12,170
- you threatened me.

698
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:14,089
- you think that
was a threat?

699
00:40:14,123 --> 00:40:16,925
- what, are you gonna
murder me too?

700
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,461
Like you murdered
your family?

701
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:22,413
Your own daughter?

702
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,299
- you're sick.

703
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:25,750
- i know what you did.

704
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:28,637
I have proof.

705
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:30,922
- not possible.

706
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,257
- from the garbage disposal,

707
00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:34,109
The gloves
you wore that night.

708
00:40:34,143 --> 00:40:36,594
There was gun residue
on them.

709
00:40:36,612 --> 00:40:38,947
I have a meeting with
my superiors tomorrow morning

710
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:43,434
To tell them everything.

711
00:40:43,453 --> 00:40:45,320
- there's no chain of
custody.

712
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:47,405
- still,
it'll raise questions.

713
00:40:47,439 --> 00:40:49,741
And if you left
this much behind,

714
00:40:49,775 --> 00:40:52,777
We'll find something else.

715
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:05,724
- you're trying to rape me.

716
00:41:05,758 --> 00:41:08,510
- i'm not touching you.

717
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:11,229
- that's why
you came to my house.

718
00:41:11,264 --> 00:41:12,931
And the real estate agent
will testify that

719
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:15,800
You were flirting with me.

720
00:41:15,818 --> 00:41:20,471
And then you stalked me here
and tried to assault me.

721
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,440
And i had to defend myself.

722
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:24,910
- except...

723
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:26,745
The blowback of my blood
into the muzzle of your gun

724
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:29,147
Will show
a flat contact shot

725
00:41:29,165 --> 00:41:31,917
That's highly unlikely
during a struggle.

726
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,757
You could shoot me
center mass,

727
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,458
But the low directionality
will show

728
00:41:40,492 --> 00:41:43,011
I was in
a defensive position.

729
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:46,097
You'd have to calculate
the exact distance

730
00:41:46,132 --> 00:41:50,268
To create a spatter pattern
that supports self-defense.

731
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:58,560
- go ahead.

732
00:41:58,611 --> 00:42:01,479
Tell them.

733
00:42:01,513 --> 00:42:04,533
No one
is going to believe you

734
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:08,904
Over me.

735
00:42:08,955 --> 00:42:11,573
So please.

736
00:42:11,624 --> 00:42:13,325
Tell them...

737
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,028
Everything.

738
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:26,254
- you won't
give me the chance.

739
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:28,557
I'm counting on it.

740
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:34,262
[knocks]

741
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:41,236
- debra.

742
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,021
You're here.

743
00:42:43,055 --> 00:42:45,273
I called because,
trinity, i--

744
00:42:45,324 --> 00:42:46,942
- shut up.

745
00:43:01,173 --> 00:43:04,242
- this time
she won't come in a squad car.

746
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,096
This time it won't be
about threats and intimidation.

747
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:11,883
This time, it's for real.

748
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:15,586
They're all props,

749
00:43:15,605 --> 00:43:19,391
The camouflage
of a family man.

750
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:22,394
She'll believe them.

751
00:43:22,428 --> 00:43:25,113
She has no idea who i am,

752
00:43:25,147 --> 00:43:28,316
But i know exactly
who she is.

753
00:43:28,367 --> 00:43:31,703
Marco...

754
00:43:34,073 --> 00:43:36,324
Polo.

755
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:44,549
- she's going to make it
look like i walked in

756
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,084
On a home robbery,

757
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:47,919
Got myself killed.

758
00:43:47,953 --> 00:43:51,506
She's good at creating
the narrative of a crime.

759
00:44:11,861 --> 00:44:15,530
That hand's the first thing
i cut off.

760
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:27,492
[grunts]

761
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,844
- [cries]

762
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:32,347
- surprise.

763
00:44:35,801 --> 00:44:38,803
- [grunts]

764
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:03,044
Help!
help!

765
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:04,546
Help!

766
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,499
Sorry, sorry, i was just
buying your tickets.

767
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:10,668
You're taking a boat
out of the country.

768
00:45:10,702 --> 00:45:13,555
Eventually you'll land
in the philippines.

769
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:17,342
You're smart, there's no
extradition treaty there.

770
00:45:17,376 --> 00:45:20,645
- i'm not going anywhere.

771
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:25,433
- i know something about
creating a narrative too.

772
00:45:25,484 --> 00:45:29,354
Suitcases packed, your car
will be left at the port,

773
00:45:29,388 --> 00:45:33,241
And the blue glove
is back in your disposal.

774
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:35,276
You'll flee the country.

775
00:45:35,327 --> 00:45:39,998
You'll--whoosh--
never be caught.

776
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:43,284
You're that good.

777
00:45:43,335 --> 00:45:45,787
Or that dead.

778
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:47,255
- you're gonna
rape and kill me?

779
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:48,840
- [laughs]
what is it with you and rape?

780
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:51,960
No one's raping anyone.

781
00:45:52,011 --> 00:45:55,847
Mm, killing
on the other hand.

782
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:59,551
- why are you
doing this to me?

783
00:45:59,585 --> 00:46:02,887
- why did you
do this to them?

784
00:46:02,921 --> 00:46:04,722
- it was darius rae.

785
00:46:04,756 --> 00:46:07,925
- no, you wanted out.

786
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:10,145
You wanted your freedom.

787
00:46:10,196 --> 00:46:14,783
From
the constant demands...

788
00:46:14,817 --> 00:46:16,234
They took it all.

789
00:46:16,268 --> 00:46:21,289
And they wanted more.

790
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:23,625
- i couldn't breathe.

791
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:28,112
- you did it to survive.

792
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:32,450
- you understand.

793
00:46:32,468 --> 00:46:35,670
- i understand, all right.

794
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:47,482
- look at you.

795
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:51,302
What kind of father
does this?

796
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,139
What kind of husband?

797
00:46:58,577 --> 00:46:59,661
[groans]

798
00:46:59,695 --> 00:47:04,199
- not the kind
who kills his family.

799
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:17,679
- you're going to have
to choose.

800
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:21,599
- not what you chose.

801
00:47:21,634 --> 00:47:25,303
- you can't hide
what you are.

802
00:47:25,337 --> 00:47:26,888
- oh, i can.

803
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:29,274
I'm better at it
than you.

804
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:32,843
- you will choose
your life over theirs.

805
00:47:32,862 --> 00:47:34,279
- i won't.

806
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:37,866
I'd rather risk
them knowing the truth...

807
00:47:39,451 --> 00:47:42,704
Than lose them.

808
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:50,578
Wow.

809
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:55,667
[sighs]

810
00:47:55,701 --> 00:48:00,054
I don't want to lose them.

811
00:48:00,089 --> 00:48:03,057
I don't.

812
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:10,815
That's the difference
between us.

813
00:48:12,818 --> 00:48:15,553
- [groans]

814
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:25,563
- nice souvenir.

815
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,924
Sure you don't want
to stay here?

816
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:39,877
- you didn't raise
a loner, dad.

817
00:48:39,911 --> 00:48:43,080
- maybe i should have.

818
00:48:43,098 --> 00:48:44,882
- i'll survive.

819
00:48:44,916 --> 00:48:47,918
- you sure?

820
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:53,024
Better see
to that drip, son.

821
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:55,360
You don't want this place
going to hell.

822
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:56,761
You need it too much.

823
00:48:56,779 --> 00:48:58,863
- my own little
vacation spot.

824
00:48:58,897 --> 00:49:03,067
[phone rings]

825
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:05,436
Hey, how you guys
doing up there?

826
00:49:05,454 --> 00:49:06,571
- we're on our way.

827
00:49:06,605 --> 00:49:07,938
We left
right after the wedding.

828
00:49:07,957 --> 00:49:09,240
We should be home soon.

829
00:49:09,274 --> 00:49:10,775
- good, i'm glad.

830
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:13,494
- the house!

831
00:49:13,545 --> 00:49:17,632
- don't hurry.
drive safe.

832
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:51,499
You're home!

833
00:49:51,533 --> 00:49:53,451
- yeah, we made it.

834
00:49:53,485 --> 00:49:55,253
The wedding
was exhausting.

835
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:57,372
The kids
were a nightmare.

836
00:49:57,423 --> 00:50:01,259
Just wanted
to strangle them.

837
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:03,378
Oh, no.

838
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:05,713
- yeah, it just
slipped out of my hand.

839
00:50:05,764 --> 00:50:09,050
Sorry.

840
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:11,803
- oh, the kids will be excited
to make you a new one.

841
00:50:11,837 --> 00:50:13,855
[sighs]

842
00:50:30,789 --> 00:50:33,875
[sighs softly]

843
00:50:33,909 --> 00:50:39,297
I missed you so much.

844
00:50:39,331 --> 00:50:42,383
- i missed you too.

845
00:51:13,332 --> 00:51:19,253
- i'm a fuckwad.

846
00:51:19,288 --> 00:51:24,575
- you're not a fuckwad.

847
00:51:24,593 --> 00:51:27,178
- i knew.

848
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:29,213
From the second
i saw you at the station,

849
00:51:29,247 --> 00:51:32,049
I knew how i felt.

850
00:51:32,083 --> 00:51:34,602
It's how
i've always felt.

851
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:37,638
I just wouldn't
admit it.

852
00:51:37,689 --> 00:51:42,527
'cause i'm a fuckwad.

853
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:45,730
- you're human.

854
00:51:45,764 --> 00:51:47,198
- and now i've cheated
on a guy

855
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:51,119
Who doesn't deserve
to be treated that way.

856
00:51:51,153 --> 00:51:54,455
I should have
broken up with him first.

857
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,325
But i'm a fuckwad.
- no. don't.

858
00:51:57,376 --> 00:52:00,244
You're not.

859
00:52:00,278 --> 00:52:02,830
You're beautiful.

860
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:06,951
And you were confused.

861
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:10,254
And now you're not.

862
00:52:10,288 --> 00:52:11,756
So...

863
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:15,510
We'll set this right,
together.

864
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:18,563
All right?

865
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:40,868
- don't go disappearing
on me again.

866
00:52:40,919 --> 00:52:43,171
- not a--

867
00:52:43,205 --> 00:52:46,174
[gunshot]

868
00:52:56,835 --> 00:53:00,438
[two gunshots]

869
00:53:24,213 --> 00:53:27,381
- stay with me.
