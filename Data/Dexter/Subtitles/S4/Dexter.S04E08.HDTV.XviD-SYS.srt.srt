00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:08,042
[quirky music]

2
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:48,926
<i>- previously on dexter...</i>

3
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,461
You need to kill it.

4
00:01:51,065 --> 00:01:53,714
- no, i-i can't.

5
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:55,066
- what's the real reason you're
stalling on killing trinity?

6
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,468
- i still have things
to learn from him.

7
00:01:57,486 --> 00:01:59,820
- judging from the spray,
we're looking at somebody tall--

8
00:01:59,855 --> 00:02:00,821
Over six feet.

9
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:02,973
He moved the arm...

10
00:02:02,991 --> 00:02:04,992
For a reason.

11
00:02:05,027 --> 00:02:06,861
- that smudge you found
at the crime scene--

12
00:02:06,912 --> 00:02:09,947
Cremated human remains.

13
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:11,616
- we got the killer's
goddamn dna?

14
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,085
- the killer is related
to the human remains--

15
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:16,320
Same family, the same dna.

16
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:18,756
- he keeps his family
with him all the time.

17
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,843
Vera mitchell,
sister of arthur mitchell...

18
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:24,995
Found dead in a bathtub.

19
00:02:25,013 --> 00:02:27,715
This is arthur mitchell
at his core.

20
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,967
Is there something
in his dna

21
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:33,170
That lets him keep a family--
some magic gene i'm missing?

22
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:35,022
- i just got the official
go-ahead from laguerta

23
00:02:35,057 --> 00:02:37,007
To open a trinity killer
investigation.

24
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,342
- what's that mean?

25
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,145
- i realized if i pitched
the entire trinity theory

26
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,397
And i added that
he also shot me and lundy,

27
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:45,700
Look like a fucking lunatic,
so i boiled it down

28
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,850
To the bludgeonings.

29
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:49,487
- i am no longer seeing
lieutenant laguerta.

30
00:02:49,521 --> 00:02:51,238
- we broke up, officially.

31
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,823
- if i find out
this is bullshit,

32
00:02:52,857 --> 00:02:54,208
There will be
consequences--

33
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:57,244
Severe, career-ending
consequences.

34
00:02:57,296 --> 00:02:58,579
- who are you?

35
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,864
- i'm the person
who's going to keep you

36
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:02,216
From killing
any more women.

37
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,217
- i didn't
fucking kill them!

38
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,086
Because of my pictures,

39
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,587
Those women
will live on forever!

40
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:07,888
- nothing lasts forever.

41
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,974
- [screams]

42
00:03:10,008 --> 00:03:12,226
- isn't that--
- farrow's assistant.

43
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,562
I just arrested him for
the murder of estrella carazo.

44
00:03:14,596 --> 00:03:16,147
- but, no, i thought--

45
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,399
- yeah, at first it looked like
farrow, but this is airtight.

46
00:03:18,433 --> 00:03:20,935
We got dna evidence.
we got everything.

47
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:24,322
- i killed
an innocent man.

Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

49
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:38,452
So i made a mistake.

50
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:40,287
It could've happened
to anyone--

51
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:41,505
Well, any murderer--

52
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,375
Not that murderers
typically care

53
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,211
Whether their victims
are innocent or not.

54
00:03:47,245 --> 00:03:49,380
Then why is it
eating at me?

55
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:57,104
Jonathan farrow--
"s" and "m" photographer,

56
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:01,942
Abuser of women,
asshole, but not a killer,

57
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:03,927
Not up to harry's code.

58
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,312
Yet i killed him.

59
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:08,032
Now i'm...

60
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,117
Uncomfortable.

61
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,606
It should've been
arthur mitchell on my table...

62
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,793
[sighs] trinity,
shooter of my sister.

63
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:21,545
I should've...

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,114
No, no "should'ves."
i don't do "should'ves."

65
00:04:24,132 --> 00:04:28,169
That's not me.

66
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,170
- [whispers]
this isn't me.

67
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,672
[glass breaks]
aah, shit.

68
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:34,091
- i just need
to stop thinking about it.

69
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,060
- jonathon farrow...

70
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:39,180
Originally a suspect,
now possibly a victim.

71
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:41,432
- it was a mistake,
for fuck's sake.

72
00:04:41,466 --> 00:04:43,734
- farrow disappeared
right before his assistant,

73
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:46,970
Timothy brand, confessed
to murdering those models.

74
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:49,473
Missing persons
has been investigating,

75
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:50,974
And now they're passing it
on to us.

76
00:04:50,992 --> 00:04:52,643
- you think brand
killed farrow?

77
00:04:52,661 --> 00:04:55,479
- maybe he found out what brand
was up to, it's hard to say.

78
00:04:55,497 --> 00:04:58,115
Soderquist, yale,
stay with farrow.

79
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:00,201
- brand probably
turned him into gator bait.

80
00:05:00,252 --> 00:05:01,786
- i wish i could take comfort

81
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,004
That my crime
has been pinned on brand.

82
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,122
But i can't.

83
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:07,091
- what is wrong with you?

84
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,593
- [sighing]
i don't know.

85
00:05:09,628 --> 00:05:11,929
- okay, moving on.
morgan...

86
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,180
What do we have
on your bludgeonings?

87
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:15,666
- maybe this'll
cheer you up.

88
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:18,519
- not if you're making headway
on trinity.

89
00:05:22,941 --> 00:05:25,276
- we've got
a serial bludgeoner.

90
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:27,812
The victims are all men
in their 40s.

91
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,530
I've got cases
dating back 30 years,

92
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:33,350
Which most likely puts our
bludgeoner in his 50s or 60s.

93
00:05:33,368 --> 00:05:36,320
The break in the case
came with the discovery

94
00:05:36,354 --> 00:05:37,822
Of the human ash
he left behind,

95
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,874
Along with his
own saliva--

96
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,242
Read dna.

97
00:05:41,293 --> 00:05:43,661
- you're welcome.
just doing my job.

98
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:46,864
- the killer leaves the ash
as his sick-ass signature,

99
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:49,800
Making his vics
point at it post mortem.

100
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:52,753
I can't be sure
all of these are ash marks,

101
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:54,421
But the finger-pointing
indicates

102
00:05:54,473 --> 00:05:59,059
A strong possibility that--
ahh, how'd that get in there?

103
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:02,596
- no--whoa.
could you go back?

104
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:06,183
Go back.

105
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:07,902
This isn't a bludgeoning.

106
00:06:07,936 --> 00:06:10,688
- no.

107
00:06:10,722 --> 00:06:14,525
- yet the victim's finger seems
to be pointing towards a smudge.

108
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,410
Ash?

109
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,778
- don't do it, deb.

110
00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:19,697
- uh...

111
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,249
Yeah, probably.

112
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:24,835
- when you presented
this case to me,

113
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,206
You said it was limited
to a bludgeoner.

114
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,544
So how about we hear all of it,
detective morgan?

115
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:35,913
- it's gonna sound insane...

116
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:39,183
I hope.

117
00:06:39,217 --> 00:06:42,252
- all right,
i found possible smudges

118
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,223
In several old
bathtub killings...

119
00:06:46,257 --> 00:06:48,859
Also several
jumper suicides.

120
00:06:48,894 --> 00:06:50,761
And that's the pattern--

121
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:53,063
Bathtub, jumper, bludgeon--

122
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:55,399
All in close succession...

123
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,936
One cycle of three vics
every year or so,

124
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:00,771
Possibly for 30 years--

125
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:02,790
Different cities,
different states.

126
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:07,294
It's a trinity
of victims...

127
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,214
Which is why frank lundy
called him the "trinity killer."

128
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:12,082
- this is an fbi case?
- the fbi never bought it.

129
00:07:12,116 --> 00:07:13,217
- yet we're supposed to.

130
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:18,255
- lundy came to miami
to hunt this guy.

131
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:19,924
I think he got too close,

132
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:23,060
And i think it got him
killed and me shot.

133
00:07:23,094 --> 00:07:28,315
- so this trinity killer
did that to you?

134
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,602
- come on, laguerta,
say it's far-fetched.

135
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,106
- go on.

136
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,109
- great, like i need
you people getting in my way.

137
00:07:39,143 --> 00:07:40,945
Well, trinity
is past his due date.

138
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,112
This just confirms it.

139
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:43,113
- dex.

140
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,949
Can you believe it?

141
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:46,283
- yeah, you really did it.

142
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:48,202
- i kept
lundy's legacy alive.

143
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:49,670
I even got
the bosses on board.

144
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:52,623
- detective morgan,
my office.

145
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:54,458
Is that a commendation
i smell?

146
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:55,960
- go get 'em, tiger...

147
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,494
Ess--

148
00:07:57,512 --> 00:08:00,965
Tigress.

149
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:05,836
- dex. hey, buddy.

150
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:07,471
- keep walking.
not in the mood.

151
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:09,673
- halftime?

152
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,309
- it's called lunch,
buddy.

153
00:08:12,343 --> 00:08:14,177
- off campus, as usual.

154
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:16,363
[elevator bell dings]

155
00:08:16,398 --> 00:08:20,317
- i really do need to stab
something.

156
00:08:20,351 --> 00:08:23,320
[building ominous music]

157
00:08:23,354 --> 00:08:31,361
? ?

158
00:09:09,951 --> 00:09:14,421
The trinity killer...

159
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:16,073
This is good.

160
00:09:16,091 --> 00:09:18,742
There's no question
of his guilt,

161
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,244
And i could use
some certainty.

162
00:09:21,262 --> 00:09:22,746
- hey, jonah,
how those wheels holding up?

163
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:26,600
- like a dream,
mr. butler.

164
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,920
Like a real nice dream.
- kyle!

165
00:09:29,938 --> 00:09:34,108
Hey. what brings you here
this fine day?

166
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:35,859
- ah, just checking in.

167
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:38,261
You know, after the...

168
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,279
Deer.

169
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:41,765
Want to make sure
you're okay.

170
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:43,934
- oh, that's kind of you,
but i've put it out of my mind,

171
00:09:43,952 --> 00:09:46,203
No need to dwell.

172
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,788
- you can just do that?

173
00:09:47,822 --> 00:09:51,625
- no, no, no,
smooth, circular motion, son,

174
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,410
And the paint job
will last for years.

175
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:54,878
- got it, dad.

176
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:56,413
- if you've got it,
i wouldn't have to remind you.

177
00:09:56,447 --> 00:09:58,966
There are two ways to things.
why not choose the right way?

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,803
- small cracks
in the perfect family,

179
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:04,955
Which makes them
perfectly normal.

180
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,624
[door opens]

181
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,560
- kyle, hello.
- hey.

182
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:14,131
- honey, your clothes are clean,
folded, and ready to be packed.

183
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,566
- going out of town?

184
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,434
- yeah, tampa.
- oh.

185
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:18,602
- a four walls build.

186
00:10:18,636 --> 00:10:19,903
- an out-of-town build--

187
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:22,072
Is his cycle
starting over again already?

188
00:10:22,107 --> 00:10:24,158
- rebecca.
- mm-hmm?

189
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:26,143
- the ground needs
to be really soaked.

190
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:29,279
A good soaking, or all these
flowers are just gonna die.

191
00:10:29,313 --> 00:10:31,582
- sorry, dad.

192
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:34,201
- so tampa--
the whole family going?

193
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:36,003
- no, not
on out-of-towners.

194
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:37,988
It's too expensive
to put 'em all up.

195
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:39,489
- oh, admit it, arthur.

196
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,092
You enjoy
those vacations from us.

197
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:45,262
He always comes home
so relaxed.

198
00:10:45,296 --> 00:10:47,548
- i'm sure.

199
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:48,599
You leaving today?

200
00:10:48,633 --> 00:10:51,168
- no, tomorrow,
right from work.

201
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:52,853
- there's the "where"
and the "when."

202
00:10:52,887 --> 00:10:56,356
An out-of-town kill--
trinity's own m.o.,

203
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:58,108
How poetic.

204
00:10:58,143 --> 00:10:59,309
- well, happy travels.

205
00:10:59,343 --> 00:11:01,728
- take care, kyle.

206
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,864
- now i need to come up
with my own "where" and "when"

207
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:07,401
To convince my boss
and my wife to let me leave.

208
00:11:10,521 --> 00:11:12,372
All i need
is some convention

209
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:14,458
That smells a little
like blood spatter--

210
00:11:14,492 --> 00:11:16,710
Something science-y.

211
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:19,496
Brake and muffler
exhibit--no.

212
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,249
Knitting and needlepoint
convention--

213
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,501
No blood there unless
someone impales themselves.

214
00:11:24,535 --> 00:11:28,505
A trade show convention.

215
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:32,176
Oh, a convention
on conventions.

216
00:11:35,713 --> 00:11:38,265
- remember me?

217
00:11:38,316 --> 00:11:40,884
- debra morgan, sister.

218
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:43,320
- debra morgan, former detective
on the trinity case.

219
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:44,554
- former?

220
00:11:44,572 --> 00:11:46,490
- fucking laguerta
took me off the case,

221
00:11:46,524 --> 00:11:51,328
'cause officially i'm a victim
of this cocksucker's crimes.

222
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:52,996
- that's too bad.

223
00:11:53,031 --> 00:11:54,832
- too bad?

224
00:11:54,866 --> 00:11:57,584
[chuckles]
it fucking sucks.

225
00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:01,205
- well, the bright side
is this frees you up

226
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,374
To help the department
in so many ways.

227
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,927
- in the course
of one day,

228
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:09,513
I go from bringing in
the biggest case

229
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:11,381
Miami metro has ever seen

230
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,583
To being
"freed up in so many ways"?

231
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,769
- [sighs]

232
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:18,689
- i love you, bro, but sometimes
you're a fucking tard.

233
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:20,607
- yeah, i know.

234
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:26,763
[computer beeps]

235
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:30,701
- tampa--
what the hell's in tampa?

236
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:33,904
- something science-y.

237
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:36,273
A crime scene is basically
a micro-climate

238
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,875
Subject
to so many variables.

239
00:12:37,909 --> 00:12:39,042
In the world
of blood spatter,

240
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:40,610
Those variables
can mean the difference

241
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:42,212
Between good science
and the guilty going free.

242
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:44,631
Everything from the anomalous
effects of barometric pressure

243
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,968
On particulate liquids
in a high humidity environment

244
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:49,219
To the ionization of--

245
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:50,754
- point, please.

246
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:51,755
- oh.

247
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:53,390
Meteorological conference,
tampa.

248
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:56,593
- if i let you go,
will you stop talking?

249
00:12:56,627 --> 00:12:59,396
- you see, learning even more
about hemoglobin dispersion

250
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,348
And the magnetic effects
of lightning

251
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,766
In the case
of severe thunderstorms

252
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,901
Could prove invaluable,

253
00:13:03,935 --> 00:13:06,320
Because it can all be
considered causal

254
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:09,306
In the determination
of bloodstain analysis.

255
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:15,279
- oh...

256
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:16,446
Is that it?

257
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,832
- that's all
i could come up with.

258
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:20,701
- well, i-it sounds like
you're very excited

259
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:22,002
About this conference.

260
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:24,154
- not to mention
how it will look

261
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:25,372
When my salary revue
comes up.

262
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,958
We could start paying
for your college.

263
00:13:27,992 --> 00:13:30,460
- i love your dedication...

264
00:13:30,494 --> 00:13:33,163
To work, to this family.

265
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,881
It's one of the reasons
why i married you.

266
00:13:34,933 --> 00:13:36,499
- one of the many, right?

267
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,135
- right.

268
00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:39,136
[harrison coos]

269
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,170
You know, and, actually,

270
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:41,638
Elliot's taking
the kids fishing,

271
00:13:41,672 --> 00:13:44,775
So they'll be busy
at least one of those days.

272
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:48,528
- he's a good neighbor,
that elliot.

273
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:50,530
- but i do need
some space too,

274
00:13:50,565 --> 00:13:52,182
So i'll trade you.

275
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,234
I'll cover the kids
this weekend,

276
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:56,486
And you cover them tuesday
nights when i go to yoga?

277
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,038
- yoga?

278
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,573
- it's the new me.

279
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:01,291
- well, i like
the new you.

280
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:05,996
- though scheduling
my activities

281
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:11,468
Around her downward-facing dog
could prove challenging...

282
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,503
I'll dwell on that later.

283
00:14:13,537 --> 00:14:16,506
[salsa music]

284
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,929
? ?

285
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:26,817
What does one pack
for an out-of-town kill?

286
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:30,270
Got to travel light.
can't raise suspicion.

287
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,889
I just need
a reliable tool,

288
00:14:32,907 --> 00:14:34,825
Something i can count on.

289
00:14:34,859 --> 00:14:37,577
[blade sings]

290
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:48,565
- hey!

291
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,517
- oh, you startled me.

292
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:52,018
- sorry.

293
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,904
I was hoping to catch
a ride to tampa.

294
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:55,405
- kyle--

295
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,307
- i need to get away,
even just for the weekend.

296
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:58,808
- um, i'm sorry.
[engine turning]

297
00:15:58,826 --> 00:16:01,611
There'll be other opportunities,
but not this one.

298
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:04,948
- i can't wait.
arthur, i need to do this.

299
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:06,867
Give something
back to the world.

300
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:10,754
Make things right.

301
00:16:10,788 --> 00:16:14,925
I can't do that
without your help.

302
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:21,131
I have to get out of here...

303
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:24,634
Out of here...

304
00:16:24,668 --> 00:16:27,304
Away from this...

305
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:28,939
Feeling, whatever it is.

306
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:30,474
And with you,
i feel focused,

307
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:34,444
Like i have a sense
of purpose and certainty.

308
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,847
I need you.

309
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:40,984
- i...

310
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:43,236
I have nothing
to give you.

311
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:47,023
- generosity of spirit,
arthur?

312
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,860
I know those are
more than just words to you.

313
00:16:50,878 --> 00:16:52,462
Tell me
they're not just...

314
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:54,131
Words.

315
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,370
- you need my help?

316
00:17:00,388 --> 00:17:02,422
- more than you know.

317
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:04,508
- there's nobody else?

318
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:07,644
- you're the one, arthur...

319
00:17:07,678 --> 00:17:10,147
The only one.

320
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,517
- well, come on.

321
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,403
- i knew
i could count on you.

322
00:17:28,232 --> 00:17:30,033
- according
to dexter's spatter work,

323
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,901
Our suspect is
at least six feet tall.

324
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,069
- [quietly]
closer to 6'4".

325
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:34,504
- more like 6'4".

326
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:36,289
The dna profile
says we're looking

327
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,009
For a caucasian male
of northern european descent,

328
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:40,377
Blue eyes...

329
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:42,295
- 50 to 70 years old.

330
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:45,248
- so we're looking
for a potentially retired,

331
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,349
Old, white guy.

332
00:17:46,384 --> 00:17:47,917
In miami?

333
00:17:47,935 --> 00:17:49,352
- great.

334
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:50,587
And this is
the snowbird season.

335
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:52,922
- which quadruples
our old-white-guy quotient.

336
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,757
- there's got to be
something else we can do,

337
00:17:54,775 --> 00:17:56,693
Some other angle--

338
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,144
- uh, dna sweep.

339
00:17:58,196 --> 00:18:01,364
We could do
a targeted dna sweep

340
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:05,318
Of white males, 60-ish,
in the miami metro area.

341
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:07,537
- you know how much
work that is?

342
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:09,939
I've got a big weekend planned.
as in twins.

343
00:18:09,957 --> 00:18:11,041
- you got twins lined up?

344
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:12,659
- not yet,
but that's the plan.

345
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,995
Besides,
the aclu will shut this down

346
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:16,046
The minute word gets out.

347
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,747
- and they always do.

348
00:18:17,781 --> 00:18:19,616
You can't do a roadblock
without drawing some attention.

349
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:23,503
- uh, it's the weekend.

350
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:25,171
Um...

351
00:18:25,223 --> 00:18:27,090
Next week's thanksgiving,

352
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:29,593
So, uh, the courts
will be closed.

353
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:33,346
- sweeps have worked
in miami before.

354
00:18:33,397 --> 00:18:35,131
- right,
the south beach rapist,

355
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:37,934
The robbery-homicide case
in '06.

356
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:40,770
- '07.
- '07.

357
00:18:40,804 --> 00:18:43,073
- wait, wait, who's gonna--
who's gonna pay for all this?

358
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:44,357
The department's
so strapped,

359
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:46,526
We can't even afford
coffee filters.

360
00:18:46,577 --> 00:18:50,280
I used toilet paper to make
the coffee this morning.

361
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:52,582
- if dna is our only lead,
then dna is what we'll look for.

362
00:18:52,617 --> 00:18:54,417
Let me worry
about the budget.

363
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:56,369
Masuka, write up a protocol
for random field swabbing

364
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,537
That patrol can follow.

365
00:18:57,588 --> 00:18:59,205
Everything goes
through you.

366
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:03,493
- there go my plans.

367
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:05,595
- happy?

368
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,932
- how are we gonna pay
for this?

369
00:19:08,966 --> 00:19:10,967
- i have no idea.

370
00:19:11,001 --> 00:19:12,719
But i'm about to spend
a lot of hours

371
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,304
Looking for loose change
in the budget.

372
00:19:14,338 --> 00:19:17,390
- that's a lot of work.

373
00:19:17,441 --> 00:19:18,725
Want some help?

374
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:22,696
- absolutely. come on in.
- okay.

375
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,564
- you know...

376
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:28,184
The briefing room
might be better.

377
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:29,452
- out--out in the open?

378
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:31,905
- mm-hmm.
- yeah?

379
00:19:31,956 --> 00:19:34,658
Better?

380
00:19:43,918 --> 00:19:46,252
- i already feel
the cloud of farrow lifting

381
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:48,755
In anticipation
of tonight.

382
00:19:48,806 --> 00:19:54,094
- so what time do we get started
in the morning?

383
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:57,880
- 6:00.

384
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:59,933
- it'll be mostly
local guys?

385
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:01,851
- yeah, women too.

386
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:05,071
- the first kill in his cycle
of three is always a woman,

387
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:06,523
But he won't get the chance.

388
00:20:06,557 --> 00:20:07,890
- do we all stay
at the same hotel?

389
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:09,242
- i don't know.

390
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:13,780
- is it close to the build?

391
00:20:13,831 --> 00:20:15,031
- it's walking distance.

392
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:16,583
- does everybody
hang out--

393
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:19,586
- good lord,
you have a lot of questions.

394
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,238
- sorry.

395
00:20:22,256 --> 00:20:25,091
- you told me
you were troubled.

396
00:20:25,126 --> 00:20:28,128
About what?

397
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:37,387
- i did something.
[sighs]

398
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:39,222
- well, let's hear it.

399
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,473
- i made a mistake.

400
00:20:40,524 --> 00:20:42,609
- we all make mistakes.
- it was a big one.

401
00:20:42,643 --> 00:20:46,062
- you're being
purposely vague, kyle,

402
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:47,564
Like one of my tenth graders

403
00:20:47,598 --> 00:20:51,768
Who's trying to explain
why he didn't do his homework.

404
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:53,319
- i have a feeling
i'm gonna

405
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:55,572
Make some tenth graders
very happy.

406
00:20:55,606 --> 00:20:56,956
- pit stop.

407
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:20,096
- you're a brave man, kyle.

408
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,097
- how so?

409
00:21:21,131 --> 00:21:23,149
- eating
from a vending machine.

410
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:26,102
- years of training--
iron stomach.

411
00:21:26,136 --> 00:21:29,272
- maybe you could show
some of that same bravery

412
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:30,824
By sharing
what's bothering you.

413
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:35,144
- [breathes deeply]

414
00:21:35,162 --> 00:21:36,479
- how am i
supposed to help you

415
00:21:36,497 --> 00:21:37,997
When i don't know
what the problem is?

416
00:21:38,032 --> 00:21:40,083
- it's not that important.
- it's important to me.

417
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:41,835
- why?

418
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:43,503
- because helping someone
is a good deed,

419
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:45,255
And god rewards
good deeds,

420
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:46,823
But in order to help,
i need to know the problem.

421
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:48,007
That's how
these things work.

422
00:21:48,042 --> 00:21:49,426
- i really don't want to talk
about it.

423
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,679
- you asked me, remember?
that's why i brought you.

424
00:21:52,713 --> 00:21:57,166
- why don't we just--
- tell me, kyle!

425
00:21:57,184 --> 00:21:58,334
I'm gonna get into my van

426
00:21:58,352 --> 00:21:59,636
And just leave you here
to fend for yourse--

427
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,056
- i killed a man.

428
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:13,316
- you killed someone?

429
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,402
- you of all people
act appalled.

430
00:22:16,454 --> 00:22:19,456
- by mistake.
- how? what happened?

431
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,910
- i thought
he was the right--

432
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:26,963
[sighs]

433
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:31,501
I thought he was an animal.

434
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:34,971
- you--you were hunting?

435
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:39,642
- yes, it was
a hunting accident.

436
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:42,395
I was so sure.
i'm always so careful.

437
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,214
- then it truly
was an accident.

438
00:22:45,232 --> 00:22:49,686
- still, it's left me
with this...

439
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,157
Feeling.

440
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:57,193
- there are few things
harder to bear than remorse.

441
00:22:57,227 --> 00:22:59,746
- remorse?

442
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,498
- guilt. remorse.

443
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:05,401
It's what separates us
from the animals.

444
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:10,757
Your conscience
is eating away at you.

445
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:13,593
But you're gonna
feel better.

446
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:15,762
Confession is good
for the soul.

447
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:19,682
- all the more proof
i have no soul.

448
00:23:19,717 --> 00:23:25,104
Doing good deeds,
scoring points with god.

449
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:31,093
You and i are way beyond
the point system, arthur.

450
00:23:31,111 --> 00:23:36,900
The best deed i can do
is rid the world of you.

451
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:40,069
A fitting kill room...

452
00:23:40,103 --> 00:23:45,775
Small, but i'll be
cutting him down to size.

453
00:23:45,793 --> 00:23:49,796
I just need to pick up
a few supplies.

[cell phone rings]

455
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:54,634
- hey, deb.

456
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:56,135
- how's the weather?

457
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,804
- funny.

458
00:23:57,838 --> 00:24:01,641
- you talking climate
with a bunch of dorks and nerds,

459
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:02,892
You really lead the life.

460
00:24:02,927 --> 00:24:04,677
- is there a reason
for this call?

461
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:05,895
It's getting late.

462
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,981
- that jumper
out at the warehouse,

463
00:24:08,015 --> 00:24:09,515
You took a bunch
of crime-scene photos.

464
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:12,936
Did you put them all
in the file?

465
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,072
- i take a lot of photos.
i don't use 'em all.

466
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:17,306
- but you save them?

467
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:18,408
- i do.

468
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:19,442
- i want to
look through 'em,

469
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:21,143
See if i can find
any ash smudges.

470
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:23,246
- well, they're all
on the lab computer.

471
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,331
Masuka can access 'em for you.

472
00:24:25,366 --> 00:24:27,817
- i can't ask masuka.
- why?

473
00:24:27,835 --> 00:24:29,485
- because i'm not working
this case.

474
00:24:29,503 --> 00:24:31,955
- could've fooled me.

475
00:24:31,989 --> 00:24:33,623
- i know, right?

476
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:35,258
At least i got quinn to start
dna sweeps tomorrow.

477
00:24:35,292 --> 00:24:37,176
That's something
anyway, right?

478
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:39,295
- dna sweeps?

479
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:41,297
- yeah, we're gonna do
random cheek swabs

480
00:24:41,331 --> 00:24:44,684
On tall white men over 50,
preferably with blue eyes.

481
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:46,352
- good luck with that.

482
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:47,687
- thanks.

483
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:52,025
Hey, you run into
that weather guy, sonny skyes,

484
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:53,843
You tell him
he's got a stupid name.

485
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:56,195
- will do.

486
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,617
- but first
a little shopping.

487
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:05,989
- oh.
[chuckles]

488
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,373
Are you headed out?

489
00:25:07,408 --> 00:25:09,659
- yeah, for ice.
- change of plan for tomorrow.

490
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:11,377
We're not going to the build.

491
00:25:11,412 --> 00:25:12,695
I got a surprise
for you instead.

492
00:25:12,713 --> 00:25:14,747
- uh...

493
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:16,165
I don't like surprises.

494
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:20,503
- you'll like this one.
it'll make you feel better.

495
00:25:25,426 --> 00:25:27,260
- how will it
make me feel better?

496
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:28,728
Could he have
some kind of formula

497
00:25:28,762 --> 00:25:32,899
For remorse or something?

498
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:35,885
If anyone does, it'd be him.

499
00:25:35,903 --> 00:25:39,906
It's not like i can't kill him
tomorrow night.

500
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,825
- good.
so far we've saved...

501
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,411
- $24,000.

502
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:46,412
- not bad.

503
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:48,414
- mm, it's not enough.

504
00:25:48,449 --> 00:25:53,453
We need at least $12,000 more.

505
00:25:56,239 --> 00:25:59,008
What?

506
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:01,377
- your hair.

- stop it.

00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:31,267
- it's me.

533
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:34,137
I called,
but you didn't pick up.

534
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:39,192
[sighs] i know it's late,
but i've had the worst day.

535
00:27:39,226 --> 00:27:41,644
- i'm sorry,
babe, but i-i...

536
00:27:41,678 --> 00:27:44,180
- i could lose my job.

537
00:27:44,198 --> 00:27:45,281
Not like i'm the only one,

538
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:46,616
Being a journalist
these days

539
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,018
Is a straight ticket
to the unemployment line.

540
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,486
- you're not gonna
lose your job.

541
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,989
- my editor laid it out.

542
00:27:53,023 --> 00:27:55,741
He said either i get
"a lead that bleeds,"

543
00:27:55,793 --> 00:27:59,028
Or basically i'm done.

544
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:01,747
- so you're here.

545
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,034
- what?

546
00:28:05,052 --> 00:28:09,205
- look, christy, i'm half asleep
and half in the bag.

547
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,756
I can't give you anything.

548
00:28:10,808 --> 00:28:14,760
- how about
a little support?

549
00:28:14,812 --> 00:28:16,596
You know, like a hug?

550
00:28:16,647 --> 00:28:18,397
Or an "everything's
gonna be all right"?

551
00:28:18,432 --> 00:28:20,233
- everything's
gonna be all right.

552
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:22,101
- that's bullshit.

553
00:28:22,152 --> 00:28:26,772
- hey, come here.

554
00:28:26,824 --> 00:28:28,357
It is gonna be all right,

555
00:28:28,391 --> 00:28:29,892
'cause you're
a kick-ass reporter,

556
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,111
And i'm gonna help you
dig something up,

557
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:35,748
Just not in homicide.

558
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:42,171
Maybe you should stay.

559
00:28:50,848 --> 00:28:53,099
- not if you're
on the fence.

560
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:57,353
I'll see you tomorrow.

561
00:29:00,607 --> 00:29:04,894
- quick cab to
the meteorological conference.

562
00:29:04,928 --> 00:29:06,929
Check in,
establish an alibi.

563
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:08,898
I'll be back in time to--
- kyle!

564
00:29:08,932 --> 00:29:09,982
Hey.

565
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:11,450
You're an
early bird too, huh?

566
00:29:11,485 --> 00:29:14,570
- yeah, how else
would i catch the worm?

567
00:29:14,604 --> 00:29:16,438
- yeah, i'm so excited
about today's surprise,

568
00:29:16,456 --> 00:29:18,741
I practically
sprang out of bed.

569
00:29:18,775 --> 00:29:19,792
[laughs]

570
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,128
You ready for this?
- so ready.

571
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:26,115
- [laughs]
that's the spirit.

572
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:29,252
Come on.

573
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:31,387
- yesterday he's
jumping down my throat,

574
00:29:31,421 --> 00:29:33,973
Today he's
the happy dancing man.

575
00:29:34,007 --> 00:29:36,959
Is that mask
of his crumbling?

576
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:39,979
[engine turning]

577
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:58,331
- oh, frank.

578
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:04,787
So i was thinking...

579
00:30:04,821 --> 00:30:06,488
It might not be a bad idea
to ask masuka--

580
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:08,124
- oh, fuck me.

581
00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:09,992
Don't you have other cases
you should be working on?

582
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,877
- i'm trying to help you.

583
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:13,546
Maybe you should ask masuka
if you could get

584
00:30:13,597 --> 00:30:14,997
Dexter's old
discard photos

585
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:17,550
From the tarla grant
crime scene.

586
00:30:17,601 --> 00:30:19,335
You know, tarla grant,
the supposed jumper?

587
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:21,187
- yeah, i know
who tarla grant is.

588
00:30:21,221 --> 00:30:23,005
Why do i care
about your brother's snaps?

589
00:30:23,023 --> 00:30:24,690
- well, because if she's
one of trinity's victims,

590
00:30:24,725 --> 00:30:26,359
You might find
an ash smudge.

591
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:29,312
- so basically i'm your tool.
that it?

592
00:30:29,346 --> 00:30:32,531
- yeah. that's it.

593
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:34,317
I'm using you
to make you look good,

594
00:30:34,351 --> 00:30:38,204
But i wouldn't want you
to feel like a tool.

595
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:48,864
- make sure each kit gets
a chain-of-custody sticker.

596
00:30:48,882 --> 00:30:51,367
- these swab things gonna take
a long time to turn around?

597
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:54,587
- well, in the real world, yes,
but since i'm organizing it,

598
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:57,757
We've got mad mojo,
top-of-the-pile action going on.

599
00:30:57,808 --> 00:31:00,092
Come on, people, the faster
we get 'em out in the field,

600
00:31:00,143 --> 00:31:01,844
The faster we get 'em
back here digesting.

601
00:31:01,878 --> 00:31:05,348
- you got access to dexter's
discard crime-scene photos?

602
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:07,566
- we share everything...

603
00:31:07,601 --> 00:31:08,601
Not in a gay way.

604
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,569
- yeah, that jumper,
tarla grant--

605
00:31:10,604 --> 00:31:12,688
Maybe he accidentally
snapped a smudge or something.

606
00:31:12,722 --> 00:31:15,891
- good idea,
especially from you...

607
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:17,193
And one more thing
i have to handle

608
00:31:17,227 --> 00:31:18,394
While he's
at his conference.

609
00:31:18,412 --> 00:31:22,281
- you guys and your
fucking geek fests.

610
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:25,334
- i'll have you know,

611
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:28,120
I've almost banged so much tail
at those "geek fests."

612
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:33,092
- sure. you.
but poindexter?

613
00:31:33,126 --> 00:31:36,295
- dexter
is pure jungle cat.

614
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:37,546
You should've seen
the hot english muffin

615
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,682
He was "bow-chicka-wowing"
a couple years ago

616
00:31:39,716 --> 00:31:40,933
While he was dating rita.

617
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:41,934
- huh.

618
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:43,803
- lila was insane...

619
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:45,921
Literally.

620
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,640
I could tell you stories.

621
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:49,425
- really?

622
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:53,762
- mom!
look, i caught one!

623
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,264
- wow!
that's a monster.

624
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:57,099
- yeah, and astor caught
the biggest fish of the day.

625
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:59,485
Come on, show your mom.

626
00:31:59,536 --> 00:32:00,619
- impressive.

627
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:03,239
- no biggie, just lucky.
- can we eat him?

628
00:32:03,273 --> 00:32:05,791
- absolutely, but we have to
wait till dexter comes home.

629
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:06,959
He's the fish gutter
around here.

630
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,610
- i clean a pretty
decent fish.

631
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:11,630
- oh, no, it's all right.
you don't have to.

632
00:32:11,665 --> 00:32:13,165
- no, please, my pleasure.

633
00:32:13,216 --> 00:32:15,000
How about i clean 'em,
you cook 'em,

634
00:32:15,052 --> 00:32:16,452
And we all
eat 'em together?

635
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,953
- yeah!

636
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:21,474
- all right.
i do make a mean mango salsa.

637
00:32:21,508 --> 00:32:25,344
- all right.
kids, fishies, to the sink.

638
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:30,799
- what are we doing here?

639
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:33,903
- trying to help you.

640
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:42,978
[doorbell ringing]

641
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:44,330
Hello, my name
is arthur mitchell.

642
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,532
This is my friend
kyle butler.

643
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,367
- no, thank you.

644
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:49,985
- i'm not trying
to sell anything.

645
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,621
You see, i grew up
in this house many years ago.

646
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:54,340
I was hoping
to take a look.

647
00:32:54,374 --> 00:32:56,325
We'll just take a minute.
we'll be out before you know it.

648
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:58,544
[both speaking korean]

649
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,463
- upstairs.

650
00:33:00,497 --> 00:33:01,881
- you have a lovely home.

651
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:05,551
[both speak korean]

652
00:33:22,452 --> 00:33:26,322
- a bathroom?

653
00:33:26,356 --> 00:33:29,024
- this is where
it all started.

654
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:32,294
- what started here?

655
00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:40,085
- i was standing here...

656
00:33:40,137 --> 00:33:42,888
Watching my sister
take a shower.

657
00:33:42,923 --> 00:33:45,758
- you were watching
your sister?

658
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:48,093
- i was ten.

659
00:33:48,145 --> 00:33:49,395
It was innocent.

660
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:53,349
But vera saw me...

661
00:33:53,383 --> 00:33:57,403
In the mirror.

662
00:33:57,437 --> 00:34:00,889
I startled her,
and she slipped...

663
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:03,242
Shattered
the shower doors.

664
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:07,696
The glass...

665
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:11,917
Sliced her leg.

666
00:34:15,922 --> 00:34:18,457
She was dead by the time
the ambulance came.

667
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:24,213
So much blood.

668
00:34:24,247 --> 00:34:28,267
- born in blood,
both of us.

669
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:30,219
- my parents blamed me.

670
00:34:30,253 --> 00:34:35,941
My mother became
a shell, a ghost.

671
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:39,595
She eventually
killed herself.

672
00:34:39,613 --> 00:34:41,897
- jumped to her death.

673
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:44,617
- left me all alone...

674
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:47,269
With him.

675
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:50,573
He was always a drinker...

676
00:34:50,607 --> 00:34:54,076
But without mother,
it became worse.

677
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,962
So did the beatings.

678
00:34:56,997 --> 00:34:59,548
"little fucking pervert,

679
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:03,919
Fucking cunt,
you killed them."

680
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:06,622
- what happened to him?

681
00:35:09,593 --> 00:35:10,926
- he died.

682
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,762
- no, you killed your father.

683
00:35:13,796 --> 00:35:16,131
I'm betting hammer.

684
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,859
- i never told anyone...

685
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,246
Any of this.

686
00:35:31,748 --> 00:35:33,616
- why did you tell me?

687
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,451
- so you'd know
you're not alone.

688
00:35:35,485 --> 00:35:36,869
You're just like me.

689
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:40,706
We're both responsible
for the death of an innocent.

690
00:35:40,757 --> 00:35:42,708
We share that.

691
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,720
You feel better?

692
00:35:54,771 --> 00:35:55,804
- you have to go now!

693
00:35:55,838 --> 00:35:57,640
Leave!
- i call the police!

694
00:35:57,674 --> 00:35:59,058
- don't be absurd.

695
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:00,676
- uh...
why don't we grab some lunch?

696
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:02,645
I heard about a great place
back in tampa.

697
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:06,398
- yeah.
lunch does sound good.

698
00:36:06,449 --> 00:36:07,449
- sorry.

699
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:15,023
- little coffee
with that sugar?

700
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:20,913
- can't beat the combo--
caffeine and sugar rush.

701
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,534
Quinn's out
on a warrant check.

702
00:36:25,552 --> 00:36:28,053
- actually,
i'm here to see you.

703
00:36:28,088 --> 00:36:31,757
- i don't know
nothing about nothing.

704
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:33,875
- not even about
the dna roadblocks

705
00:36:33,893 --> 00:36:36,478
Popping up
all over the city?

706
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:44,069
- quinn's been fucking
with you...

707
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:46,188
And not in that
heavy breathing kind of way.

708
00:36:46,222 --> 00:36:49,775
- yeah, if i got it from him,
would i be asking you?

709
00:36:49,826 --> 00:36:52,861
Are the sweeps connected to the
shootings of agent lundy and--

710
00:36:52,895 --> 00:36:54,246
- we're just dragging
for drunk drivers.

711
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,532
We toss up roadblocks all
the time around the holidays.

712
00:36:56,566 --> 00:36:59,034
- yeah, patrol...

713
00:36:59,068 --> 00:37:00,703
Not homicide.

714
00:37:00,737 --> 00:37:01,954
Why the dna testing?

715
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:05,040
- uh, lieutenant's idea.
got a lot of open cases.

716
00:37:05,074 --> 00:37:07,259
She's trying to up
her solve rate.

717
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,577
Really no story here.

718
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:10,379
- yeah, well,
it's all i got.

719
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:12,131
My editor's breathing down
my neck, so...

720
00:37:12,182 --> 00:37:13,298
- well,
you'll embarrass yourself.

721
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,434
- [chuckles]

722
00:37:15,468 --> 00:37:19,221
- look, i know it's really tough
for reporters right now.

723
00:37:19,255 --> 00:37:22,257
And as girls we've got
to double-prove ourselves.

724
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:26,428
So maybe
instead of this one,

725
00:37:26,446 --> 00:37:30,616
I can give you that interview
you've been wanting from me.

726
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:31,817
- are you serious?

727
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:35,788
- as long as you
make me look good.

728
00:37:35,822 --> 00:37:37,573
Call me.
we'll set up a time.

729
00:37:40,827 --> 00:37:42,661
- yeah.

730
00:37:45,448 --> 00:37:48,283
- uh, two.

731
00:37:54,974 --> 00:37:57,092
- this is the great place
you heard about--

732
00:37:57,126 --> 00:37:58,677
A hotel coffee shop?

733
00:37:58,728 --> 00:38:02,314
- well, it says their tuna melts
are "taste-tastic."

734
00:38:04,734 --> 00:38:07,102
I'm gonna go
to the men's room.

735
00:38:07,136 --> 00:38:08,103
Would you order me a--

736
00:38:08,137 --> 00:38:11,690
- a tuna melt?
- yeah.

737
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,656
Uh, dexter morgan.
sorry i'm late.

738
00:38:27,674 --> 00:38:30,793
Thank you.

739
00:38:34,163 --> 00:38:36,598
- hey, sonny skyes.
love you, man.

740
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:38,267
- hey, sonny skyes?

741
00:38:38,301 --> 00:38:39,852
- that would be me.
hi.

742
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:43,055
- do you mind?
my wife is a huge fan.

743
00:38:43,106 --> 00:38:45,307
- sure.

744
00:38:45,341 --> 00:38:49,978
- oops. here we go.
- [chuckles]

745
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:54,650
- fantastic. thanks.
- thank you.

746
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:57,703
[phone beeping]

747
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:02,374
Alibi--check.

748
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:05,294
Arthur next.

749
00:39:05,328 --> 00:39:07,529
- no, no, no!
- come on, he wants a smooch.

750
00:39:07,547 --> 00:39:10,866
Come kiss mr. fish head.
kiss mr. fish lips now.

751
00:39:10,884 --> 00:39:12,033
- that's disgusting!

752
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:15,504
- don't leave mr. fish--
- [screams]

753
00:39:18,925 --> 00:39:21,593
- kyle! over here!

754
00:39:21,644 --> 00:39:24,012
Hey, where you been?
- sorry, there was a line.

755
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:27,716
- no, no, gave me a chance
to say hello to the neighbors.

756
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:31,052
Kyle butler, this is, uh,
bob and sally moore of sarasota,

757
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:34,823
Their beautiful daughter hanna,
and their son, uh...

758
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:35,858
Spencer!

759
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:37,392
- hi.
- sit, sit.

760
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,161
There's plenty of room,
right, bob?

761
00:39:39,195 --> 00:39:40,362
- i guess.

762
00:39:40,396 --> 00:39:42,281
- i've been telling them
about our--our morning.

763
00:39:42,332 --> 00:39:43,499
- what about our morning?

764
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,200
- you know, how we visited
my childhood home.

765
00:39:45,234 --> 00:39:47,736
I showed you the bathroom
where my sister died.

766
00:39:47,754 --> 00:39:49,872
- kids don't need to hear
any more about that--

767
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:51,673
- bob, they should learn
to speak the truth.

768
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,292
- i think they know
how to speak the truth.

769
00:39:53,343 --> 00:39:55,427
- we all need
to confess our mistakes,

770
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,429
So we can go
into the light unburdened.

771
00:39:57,463 --> 00:40:00,081
That's what kyle
taught me yesterday.

772
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:01,600
- [sighs]
- not on purpose.

773
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,769
- it was such
a revelation to me

774
00:40:03,803 --> 00:40:06,355
When he told me
what he did.

775
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:10,592
Huh?

776
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,394
- we're leaving.

777
00:40:12,428 --> 00:40:13,645
- what about
your tuna melt?

778
00:40:13,696 --> 00:40:16,398
- these folks want to enjoy
their family time alone.

779
00:40:19,435 --> 00:40:22,454
Let's go.

780
00:40:26,543 --> 00:40:28,610
- that was rather rude.

781
00:40:28,628 --> 00:40:31,446
- yeah, sorry.
i'm just not as open as you are.

782
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:33,215
- it's the remorse.
you need to shed it.

783
00:40:33,249 --> 00:40:34,383
- believe me, i'm trying,

784
00:40:34,417 --> 00:40:35,968
But there's only
one thing that'll do it.

785
00:40:36,002 --> 00:40:37,786
- what's that?
- giving.

786
00:40:37,804 --> 00:40:40,339
Is it okay if we stop by
a hardware store?

787
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,090
I want to pick up
some things to donate

788
00:40:42,124 --> 00:40:44,676
To the four walls
build tomorrow.

789
00:40:44,727 --> 00:40:47,295
- that's
an excellent idea.

790
00:40:56,472 --> 00:40:59,524
[door opens]
- [humming]

791
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:01,326
Morgan.

792
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:02,494
- lieutenant.

793
00:41:02,528 --> 00:41:04,112
- what are you doing?

794
00:41:04,146 --> 00:41:06,481
- nothing.

795
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:09,451
Why were you singing?

796
00:41:09,485 --> 00:41:11,286
- i wasn't singing.
i was humming.

797
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,671
People have been
known to hum.

798
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,507
- not without reason.

799
00:41:15,541 --> 00:41:17,542
You happy
about something?

800
00:41:17,594 --> 00:41:19,845
- are you
hiding something?

801
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:21,830
- are you?

802
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:30,555
- [humming]

803
00:41:35,645 --> 00:41:37,779
- oh...

804
00:41:41,701 --> 00:41:46,371
Dissolving stitches
my ass.

805
00:41:46,406 --> 00:41:48,790
Fuck me.

806
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:59,384
Mother shit fuck.

807
00:42:06,976 --> 00:42:10,712
How tall was my shooter?

808
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,350
These wounds have a trajectory
that's totally fucking straight.

809
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:21,106
Jesus, masuka,
they're just tits.

810
00:42:21,157 --> 00:42:25,360
- but they're yours--
perky, perfect.

811
00:42:25,394 --> 00:42:27,079
- grow the fuck up and tell me
how tall my shooter is.

812
00:42:27,113 --> 00:42:29,998
- uh, if it was
the trinity killer,

813
00:42:30,033 --> 00:42:32,534
Then he's about 6'4".

814
00:42:39,676 --> 00:42:43,628
- up.

815
00:42:46,248 --> 00:42:48,467
That puts you
at about his height.

816
00:42:48,518 --> 00:42:49,851
So if you're trinity,

817
00:42:49,886 --> 00:42:52,637
How exactly do you shoot me
and get wounds like this?

818
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:56,091
- casings and gsr
from your shirt put you about...

819
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:59,594
About five feet away.

820
00:42:59,612 --> 00:43:01,146
So i'm 6'4",

821
00:43:01,197 --> 00:43:02,864
And the vast majority
of shooters

822
00:43:02,899 --> 00:43:05,117
Hold their guns
like this.

823
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:07,619
Unless he's trying
not to attract attention.

824
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:11,156
Then like this.

825
00:43:11,207 --> 00:43:13,458
Either way,

826
00:43:13,493 --> 00:43:15,327
To hit you on the side
from up here,

827
00:43:15,378 --> 00:43:20,465
I got to shoot you
with a downward trajectory

828
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,784
- there's nothing downward about
this. it's completely level.

829
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:24,136
- unless i'm kneeling.

830
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,255
But then again, i'm, like, 60,
and i got to be mobile.

831
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:28,473
- plus lundy would've reacted

832
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:31,143
To some old guy kneeling
behind me.

833
00:43:31,177 --> 00:43:33,128
I remember
his face exactly.

834
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:37,465
- so i'm not kneeling.
- then how tall is he?

835
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:49,310
- my height, approximately.

836
00:43:49,328 --> 00:43:54,199
- oh, fucking fuck.

837
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,951
Then it wasn't trinity.

838
00:43:55,985 --> 00:43:57,152
- nope.

839
00:43:57,170 --> 00:43:59,204
- then who the fuck shot me?

840
00:44:03,509 --> 00:44:06,461
- nothing like the spirit
of charity

841
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:09,097
To make the heart right.

842
00:44:09,132 --> 00:44:12,384
- about time i gave back.

843
00:44:12,435 --> 00:44:15,170
- it's a good call with the
plastic sheeting, by the way.

844
00:44:15,188 --> 00:44:17,889
This is florida. you never know
when it's gonna rain.

845
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,693
- [yawns]

846
00:44:21,727 --> 00:44:25,180
<i>ah, compadre, i don't know
about you, but i'm bushed.</i>

847
00:44:25,198 --> 00:44:28,483
- we're kindred spirits,
you and i.

848
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,738
Keep doing good work.

849
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,742
- oh, i will.

850
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:47,202
- just go to sleep...

851
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,887
No more surprises.

852
00:44:48,921 --> 00:44:50,205
[door closes]

853
00:44:50,223 --> 00:44:52,540
[muffled tv noise]

854
00:44:52,558 --> 00:44:55,560
- good enough.

855
00:45:01,484 --> 00:45:03,902
- you know what's great?

856
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:06,404
- your mango salsa?
- [laughs]

857
00:45:06,439 --> 00:45:07,856
Wine.

858
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,391
Nine months
without it sucked.

859
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:11,610
[both laugh]

860
00:45:11,661 --> 00:45:13,895
- you want to polish this off?
- no, i'm--

861
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,497
I'm already pretty buzzed.

862
00:45:15,531 --> 00:45:17,782
- oh, lightweight.

863
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:19,400
- yeah.

864
00:45:19,418 --> 00:45:21,069
If you'd said that 15 years ago,
nobody would've believed you.

865
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:23,788
- oh, so you weren't
always a soccer mom?

866
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,374
- mm, are you kidding?

867
00:45:26,408 --> 00:45:29,928
I was a dress-over-the-head
party girl.

868
00:45:29,962 --> 00:45:32,764
Oh, god,
did i just say that?

869
00:45:32,798 --> 00:45:34,432
- [laughs]

870
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:35,800
- you must think i'm--

871
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:40,088
- totally charming.

872
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:50,065
- i, um--i better
start cleaning up.

873
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,783
- yeah, let me--
let me help you.

874
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:54,069
- no, no.
it's getting late.

875
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:56,121
I'm sure you want to get home.

876
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:58,957
- right.
i'll, uh, get the kids.

877
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:13,922
[percussive working music]

878
00:46:13,956 --> 00:46:21,963
? ?

879
00:47:18,454 --> 00:47:22,741
- where the fuck
did you go?

880
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:34,135
- he's on foot...

881
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:35,703
With his tools.

882
00:47:35,721 --> 00:47:38,206
The four walls build--

883
00:47:38,224 --> 00:47:43,895
A little early,
but walking distance.

884
00:47:52,855 --> 00:47:57,492
Empty, no security.

885
00:48:09,455 --> 00:48:15,043
Just me, arthur,
and a little m-99.

886
00:48:20,883 --> 00:48:23,751
No more confessions,
no more good deeds,

887
00:48:23,769 --> 00:48:29,590
And no more fucking remorse.

888
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:42,103
What are you doing?

889
00:48:42,121 --> 00:48:45,407
No, you're mine.

890
00:48:45,441 --> 00:48:48,793
[vial shatters]
- [grunting]

891
00:48:48,828 --> 00:48:51,413
- this isn't how you die.

892
00:48:51,447 --> 00:48:54,799
- let go!

893
00:48:54,834 --> 00:48:59,454
- why keep him alive
just to kill him?

894
00:48:59,472 --> 00:49:03,675
But as long as it's
by my hand...

895
00:49:05,978 --> 00:49:08,963
- gotcha! gotcha!

896
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:10,298
- hold on.

897
00:49:10,316 --> 00:49:12,300
Give me your hand.

898
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:13,902
- [grunting]

899
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,992
- this is his solution
to remorse--suicide.

900
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:23,578
That's why he could
unburden himself.

901
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:26,664
He knew this was next.

902
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:31,870
Will it be
my only solution someday?

903
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:36,491
- i thought god sent you
so that i could save you.

904
00:49:36,509 --> 00:49:37,992
But god had another plan.

905
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,794
- so did i.

906
00:49:39,828 --> 00:49:41,796
- he sent you to save me.

907
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:46,468
- not exactly.
- you're a hero.

908
00:49:48,687 --> 00:49:51,639
- thank you.

909
00:49:51,673 --> 00:49:55,009
[people chattering]

910
00:49:57,563 --> 00:50:00,198
- so much for anonymity.

911
00:50:00,232 --> 00:50:05,019
Arthur mitchell,
you just got a reprieve.

912
00:50:08,357 --> 00:50:11,192
- so the trinity killer
didn't shoot you and lundy.

913
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,293
- nope.

914
00:50:12,328 --> 00:50:14,162
- someone masuka's size
shot you.

915
00:50:14,196 --> 00:50:15,497
- yep.

916
00:50:15,531 --> 00:50:17,215
- and that's all we got
to go on lundy's case?

917
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:18,466
- that's it.

918
00:50:18,501 --> 00:50:19,751
- well, the upside
is there's no longer

919
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:21,669
A conflict of interest
for you in the trinity case.

920
00:50:21,703 --> 00:50:24,172
- you mean
i can work it again?

921
00:50:24,206 --> 00:50:27,375
- thank christ,
no more backseat driving.

922
00:50:27,393 --> 00:50:29,877
- nobody knows this case
better than you.

923
00:50:29,895 --> 00:50:31,045
You're taking lead.

924
00:50:31,063 --> 00:50:33,548
- motherfucker, really?

925
00:50:33,566 --> 00:50:36,017
Well, what about lundy's case?
- that's my case now.

926
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:40,405
Don't worry, i'm gonna find
the shithead that shot you.

927
00:50:40,439 --> 00:50:41,689
- oh, oh, whoa...

928
00:50:41,723 --> 00:50:43,741
- oh, are you okay?
- i'm f--i'm fine.

929
00:50:43,776 --> 00:50:44,859
- you okay?

930
00:50:44,893 --> 00:50:46,744
- [laughs]

931
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:50,731
- well, we're done here.
- we're done.

932
00:50:50,749 --> 00:50:54,569
- morgan, update the squad
at 3:00, please.

933
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:59,040
- glad that didn't happen
last night.

934
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:05,096
- any regrets?

935
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:10,301
- that we didn't have
breakfast together.

936
00:51:14,223 --> 00:51:17,942
- at least
i'll get trinity...

937
00:51:17,977 --> 00:51:19,227
Promise.

938
00:51:27,286 --> 00:51:32,874
- i've killed an innocent man,
and i've saved a guilty one.

939
00:51:32,908 --> 00:51:36,444
I won't make
that mistake again.

940
00:51:36,462 --> 00:51:37,996
Is that the purpose
of remorse,

941
00:51:38,047 --> 00:51:43,251
To keep you
from repeating mistakes?

942
00:51:43,285 --> 00:51:47,622
- you're watching me.

943
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:51,426
- i'm just concerned.

944
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:53,595
- no need.
i was confused before.

945
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:56,231
- but you're not anymore.

946
00:51:56,265 --> 00:51:58,933
- no.
embarrassed, perhaps.

947
00:51:58,967 --> 00:52:01,636
In fact, i'd appreciate it

948
00:52:01,654 --> 00:52:04,939
If you'd think of
this weekend's events as a...

949
00:52:04,973 --> 00:52:07,108
A little accident.

950
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:10,945
- you stepped off a roof.

951
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:14,649
- it was a mistake.

952
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:19,420
We all make them.

953
00:52:19,455 --> 00:52:20,955
Don't worry.

954
00:52:20,989 --> 00:52:23,658
Your accident
will never be spoken of by me.

955
00:52:23,676 --> 00:52:25,627
To err is human.

956
00:52:28,964 --> 00:52:33,968
Little early
for a drunk-driving checkpoint.

957
00:52:35,187 --> 00:52:37,171
- looks like
one of debra's dna sweeps.

958
00:52:37,189 --> 00:52:40,341
- stand over here,
sir, please.

959
00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:44,679
- you, sir,
pull over here.

960
00:52:44,697 --> 00:52:47,348
- step on out of the car,
sir, please.

961
00:52:47,366 --> 00:52:49,016
- yeah, i heard about this
on the radio.

962
00:52:49,034 --> 00:52:53,404
The police are looking
for some huge serial killer.

963
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:59,794
They have his dna.
they're looking for a match.

964
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:01,462
- sounds scary.

965
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:04,999
- exactly how much do you
want to live, arthur?

966
00:53:06,919 --> 00:53:09,671
- i think this gentleman in
the red car has the right idea.

967
00:53:09,705 --> 00:53:14,175
This line is endless.

968
00:53:14,209 --> 00:53:16,227
What say we take
the scenic route?

969
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:20,381
- yeah, sure, arthur.

970
00:53:22,017 --> 00:53:24,902
- a changed man
at peace with himself.

971
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:34,195
Maybe only monsters
feel no regret.

972
00:53:34,229 --> 00:53:40,201
If erring is human,
then remorse must be too.

973
00:53:40,235 --> 00:53:44,205
Wait, does that
make me human?

974
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:46,207
Huh.

975
00:53:46,241 --> 00:54:02,323
