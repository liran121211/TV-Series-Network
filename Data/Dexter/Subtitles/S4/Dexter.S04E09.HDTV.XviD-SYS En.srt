3
00:01:45,866 --> 00:01:47,183
<i>- Previously on Dexter...</i>

4
00:01:47,234 --> 00:01:48,851
Judging from the spray,
we're looking at somebody tall.

5
00:01:48,902 --> 00:01:50,319
Over six feet.

6
00:01:50,354 --> 00:01:53,022
He moved the arm...
for a reason.

7
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:55,491
- The killer leaves
the ash as his signature,

8
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:57,026
making his vics point at it.

9
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:59,278
Lundy came to Miami
to hunt this guy.

10
00:01:59,312 --> 00:02:01,030
I think he got too close
and I think

11
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:03,332
it got him killed
and me shot.

12
00:02:03,367 --> 00:02:04,984
- It's been my dad's baby
for years.

13
00:02:05,002 --> 00:02:07,003
A few days ago,
he hands me the keys.

14
00:02:07,037 --> 00:02:08,287
- No, no.

15
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:10,840
Smooth circular motions, son.

16
00:02:10,874 --> 00:02:12,125
- I got it, dad.

17
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,176
- If you got it,
I wouldn't have to remind you.

18
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,428
- Small cracks
in the perfect family.

19
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:16,712
- I can lose my job.

20
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:17,847
Not like I'm the only one.

21
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:19,182
Being a journalist
these days

22
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:21,050
is like a straight ticket
to the unemployment line.

23
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:25,972
Either I get a lead that bleeds
or basically I'm done.

24
00:02:26,056 --> 00:02:28,340
Are the sweeps connected
to the shootings of agent Lundy?

25
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:31,010
- I know it's really tough
for reporters right now.

26
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,146
So maybe instead of this one,
I can give you

27
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,231
that interview you've
been wanting from me.

28
00:02:35,282 --> 00:02:37,349
Mother shit fuck.

29
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,903
How tall was my shooter?

30
00:02:40,954 --> 00:02:42,021
- My height.

31
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,873
- Then it wasn't Trinity.
- Nope.

32
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:46,576
- I was a dress-over-the-head
party girl.

33
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:47,910
You must think I'm--

34
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,196
- Totally charming.

35
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:51,914
- We broke up officially.

36
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:53,866
- If I find out
this is bullshit,

37
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:57,720
there will be severe,
career-ending consequences.

38
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:59,338
- Fuck it.

39
00:02:59,372 --> 00:03:01,841
- No more confessions,
no more good deeds,

40
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:05,261
and no more fucking remorse.

41
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:11,217
No, you're mine.

42
00:03:11,235 --> 00:03:14,020
Arthur Mitchell,
you just got a reprieve.

43
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:35,508
- This'll do the job.

44
00:03:35,542 --> 00:03:38,911
Cut you into exactly
the right size pieces.

45
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:42,098
You got one more day.

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,279
Happy families are all alike.

47
00:03:56,313 --> 00:04:01,284
They never leave you
by yourself on holidays.

48
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:03,119
- So I got some interesting
thanksgiving greetings

49
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,487
from your coach Davis.

50
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:06,155
Well, if you're not gonna
play baseball anymore,

51
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,623
I suppose you aren't
gonna need this.

52
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:11,077
- No, dad--
- All right?

53
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,495
How about this?

54
00:04:12,546 --> 00:04:13,996
Oh, you're full of awards.

55
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:17,416
- Once the turkey's gone,
so is Arthur.

56
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,584
- How about this one?

57
00:04:18,618 --> 00:04:21,120
This one's for most
valuable player.

58
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,017
- Fuck you, dad.

59
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:39,655
- Family business.

60
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:42,108
- It's my business too.

61
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,425
- Okay.

62
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,345
Healthy way to blow off steam.

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,381
- What the hell?

64
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:07,800
Jonah?

65
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:09,969
Hey, it's just me.

66
00:05:10,003 --> 00:05:12,504
- Mr. Butler,
what are you doing here?

67
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,639
- I stopped by your house.

68
00:05:13,673 --> 00:05:15,858
I saw you arguing
with your father.

69
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:18,811
- No, I don't argue.
I never argue.

70
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:21,530
- Still looked like a bad one.

71
00:05:21,565 --> 00:05:24,183
- Man, you have no idea
what he's like.

72
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:27,403
How he treats my mother
and Rebecca.

73
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,372
You don't know
what he's capable of.

74
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,523
- Well, actually--

75
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,524
- He hits me.

76
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:34,627
- That's not right.

77
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:40,800
- You know, I'm running out
of cliches to tell the coaches.

78
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:42,835
You know,
"Hey, I fell down some stairs.

79
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:45,704
I walked into a door."

80
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:51,710
I know it looks like we have
the perfect fucking family,

81
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:54,096
but in that house,
when he's there,

82
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,514
it's not a life.

83
00:05:55,548 --> 00:05:58,484
It's a tour of duty.

84
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:03,689
Shit.

85
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:05,608
He'd kill me if he knew
I was telling you this stuff.

86
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:07,360
- I won't say a word.

87
00:06:12,165 --> 00:06:14,233
- You should have just
let him die.

88
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,407
- Where you going?

89
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,092
- Anywhere away from here.

90
00:06:23,126 --> 00:06:25,378
I can't go back.

91
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:27,713
Not to him.
Not with the car like this.

92
00:06:27,747 --> 00:06:29,248
- So I'll go with you.

93
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:30,549
I'll be there
when you tell him.

94
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,802
- Why?

95
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:35,438
- You're not the only one
with father issues.

96
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:41,811
- Well, you know,
maybe...

97
00:06:41,862 --> 00:06:44,897
I mean, I guess if you came
to thanksgiving tomorrow,

98
00:06:44,931 --> 00:06:47,066
dad would be on his best.

99
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,617
- Thanksgiving?
- Dinner's at 1:00.

100
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:52,154
I can stay at Luke's house
until then.

101
00:06:52,205 --> 00:06:54,990
- Guess I'm having
two turkey dinners this year.

102
00:07:00,497 --> 00:07:04,467
The DNA sweep didn't
give them Trinity.

103
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:07,052
But it did bring in
a cornucopia of criminals.

104
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:09,255
That should keep Miami metro
off the Trinity case

105
00:07:09,289 --> 00:07:11,257
through the holiday.

106
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,259
Deb won't be anywhere
near as easy.

107
00:07:13,293 --> 00:07:15,761
- I'm sorry, Dex,
but I'm spending thanksgiving

108
00:07:15,795 --> 00:07:17,430
with 90 or so
of my newest friends.

109
00:07:17,464 --> 00:07:19,148
Look at these victims.

110
00:07:19,182 --> 00:07:20,599
It looks like
a family portrait.

111
00:07:20,633 --> 00:07:23,102
The bathtub women,
they're always young and single.

112
00:07:23,136 --> 00:07:25,187
A first girlfriend maybe.

113
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,856
And then the jumper's always
a mother of two.

114
00:07:26,907 --> 00:07:28,858
Maybe that represents
his mom or his wife,

115
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,443
but I don't think
this guy's married.

116
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:31,911
And the bludgeon-ee's
always a father.

117
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:35,080
- You used to love
thanksgiving when we were kids.

118
00:07:35,115 --> 00:07:37,283
You wore the little
indian headdresses.

119
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:39,702
Picked the pearl onions
out of the green beans.

120
00:07:39,753 --> 00:07:42,922
- Yeah, mom's green beans.

121
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:45,174
And then she died.

122
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,825
And it was you and me
and dad and football

123
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:49,261
and tv dinners
in aluminum trays.

124
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:51,130
Talk about your lonely.

125
00:07:51,164 --> 00:07:53,432
- Well, you won't
be lonely at our house.

126
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:54,666
You'll never get the chance.

127
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:58,437
- Dexter,
I am lead detective

128
00:07:58,472 --> 00:08:00,022
on the biggest case
of my career.

129
00:08:00,056 --> 00:08:01,690
This is where I belong.

130
00:08:01,725 --> 00:08:03,192
- I thought Batista was lead.

131
00:08:03,226 --> 00:08:04,443
- He's the lead on Lundy now.

132
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:05,978
Once we figured out Trinity
didn't shoot me,

133
00:08:06,012 --> 00:08:06,979
there was no conflict for me--
- What?

134
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:08,564
Wait.

135
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,566
Trinity didn't shoot you?

136
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:12,785
<i>- While you were at your
rain man convention,</i>

137
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:15,821
Masuka and I put it together
form the bullet's trajectory.

138
00:08:18,825 --> 00:08:19,875
- How did I not see that?

139
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,193
- We were too close.

140
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:22,378
That's what happens
when you make it personal.

141
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,414
So I've heard.

142
00:08:25,465 --> 00:08:28,367
So who shot you?

143
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:31,036
- Maybe Trinity knows.

144
00:08:31,054 --> 00:08:32,671
I'll ask him when
I haul his ass in here.

145
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:37,760
- Deb, you really, really need
to come to thanksgiving.

146
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:40,846
- Tell the family I said,
"Hi."

147
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,214
- All right, heads up,
everybody.

148
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:44,350
This DNA sweep has been
like christmas.

149
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,485
We got hits
on three open rape cases

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,937
and one open burglary case.

151
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:52,024
But best of all,
hits on two homicides.

152
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:53,943
Merry thanksgiving,
Soderquist.

153
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,060
And this one is mine.

154
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,530
Keep up the good work,
guys.

155
00:08:57,564 --> 00:09:00,065
- Sarge, any news
on any other cases?

156
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,534
- We'll find the fucker
who shot you.

157
00:09:01,568 --> 00:09:03,235
You know that.

158
00:09:03,253 --> 00:09:04,903
Focus on what you can control.

159
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:06,905
- Catching Trinity.

160
00:09:06,923 --> 00:09:09,925
- Catching Trinity.

161
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:19,268
I heard the aclu's
filing suit on the sweeps.

162
00:09:19,302 --> 00:09:23,472
- We've got maybe 72 hours
till we're shut down for good.

163
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:25,090
We'll just have
to keep pushing harder.

164
00:09:25,108 --> 00:09:26,892
- Well, the holidays
may slow us down.

165
00:09:26,926 --> 00:09:28,310
We'll have a skeleton crew.

166
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,362
- I'll be here.

167
00:09:30,397 --> 00:09:33,265
Never been much for family
holidays anyway.

168
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:36,268
- Particularly when they're
all still in Cuba.

169
00:09:38,271 --> 00:09:40,656
- Particularly.

170
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,941
You with Auri tomorrow?

171
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,277
- She's with her moms
this year.

172
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:48,247
Plus I have a chance to close
an old case of mine, so...

173
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:52,951
- So I guess we'll both
be working thanksgiving.

174
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:56,338
- Together.

175
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,624
- How unfortunate.

176
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:06,682
- Put it up higher, mom.

177
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:07,766
- No, I want it lower.

178
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,935
- Are happy families
all alike?

179
00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:12,271
- Much better.

180
00:10:12,305 --> 00:10:13,906
- Dexter's home.
- Oh, good.

181
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,324
They didn't run out of pies.

182
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:16,475
- Here you go.

183
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,647
- Okay, bird, confess.

184
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,282
How big are you?

185
00:10:23,316 --> 00:10:25,984
- 22 pounds.

186
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:27,703
- That's a lot of bird.

187
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,371
- Better too much
than not enough.

188
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:31,006
I mean, that's what
the holiday's about.

189
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:35,094
That and family.

190
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:36,962
- About tomorrow...
- Uh-oh.

191
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:38,347
- It's not a big deal.

192
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:42,434
But the Monroe County P.D.
needs a spatter interpretation

193
00:10:42,302 --> 00:10:45,471
on a bar fight and their
blood guy's in the Bahamas.

194
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,525
- Should just take
a few hours.

195
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,193
- Does it have
to be tomorrow?

196
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:52,844
- Well, that's when
the reconstruction is.

197
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,229
- Mm.

198
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,181
- Plus I'll be making
triple overtime.

199
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,033
- Sure, that's a plus,

200
00:10:58,068 --> 00:10:59,568
but you'll be missing
all the fun.

201
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:01,070
- Yeah.

202
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:03,739
- Poor you.
Poor us.

203
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,357
At least Elliot will be here.

204
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,493
- Yeah, good old Elliot.

205
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,378
- So is Deb coming?

206
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,530
- She's on the fence.

207
00:11:13,717 --> 00:11:16,168
- No, tell her that this is our
first family thanksgiving

208
00:11:16,202 --> 00:11:17,869
and that we're
establishing traditions

209
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,755
that will shape our kids
and that they'll pass on

210
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:21,306
to their kids and
that she's a part of that.

211
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:22,925
An important part of that.

212
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:28,213
- Rather than me
tell her all that...

213
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,315
Okay, guys,
now look real sad.

214
00:11:30,349 --> 00:11:32,184
I mean, really miserable.

215
00:11:32,218 --> 00:11:34,570
And...

216
00:11:34,604 --> 00:11:35,604
Action.

217
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:36,888
- Hi, aunt Deb.

218
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,273
We just heard
that you might not come

219
00:11:38,324 --> 00:11:40,392
to thanksgiving dinner,
and well--

220
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,194
- We really want you
to come.

221
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:43,862
- Look sad, retard.

222
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:45,063
- All right,
all right.

223
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,399
Just...
take two.

224
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:49,952
- Will you please come over?

225
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:53,505
- Fuck me.

226
00:12:05,552 --> 00:12:06,585
You're here late.

227
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:09,254
- Ah, didn't even notice.

228
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,306
- Big plans tomorrow?

229
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:13,142
- You're looking at them.

230
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,777
Whatever about tomorrow,
right?

231
00:12:14,811 --> 00:12:17,312
It's just another day
where people eat turkey.

232
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:20,432
I can eat turkey
any day of the year.

233
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,570
- Dexter's having people over.

234
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,572
Well, me.
He invited me over.

235
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:28,774
- Have a good time.

236
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:35,581
- You know...

237
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:36,948
I could use a wingman.

238
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,133
- Yes.

239
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:39,618
- I can't promise
it'll be any fun.

240
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:41,837
- Well, I could be
your thigh man.

241
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:45,390
- Don't press your luck.

242
00:12:45,425 --> 00:12:47,426
I'll let Rita know.

243
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,637
What time do you want
to eat tomorrow?

244
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:01,607
- Oh, bad news, babe.
I got to work.

245
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:04,576
- Oh.

246
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,361
Well, what time
do you get off?

247
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,163
- Uh...

248
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:11,166
- You do want to spend
the holiday together, don't you?

249
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:13,252
- It's a holiday.

250
00:13:13,286 --> 00:13:14,820
- Exactly.

251
00:13:14,838 --> 00:13:19,124
- Spending it together makes
things all... serious.

252
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:21,877
- Ah, it's just
a casual thanksgiving

253
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,829
with your girlfriend.

254
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:25,798
- Girlfriend?

255
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:30,435
That sounds really serious.

256
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,838
- Joey...

257
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:35,858
I don't want
to spend it alone.

258
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:41,847
Plus, uh...

259
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:45,350
I make the best pecan pie
in the state of Florida.

260
00:13:48,521 --> 00:13:50,322
- I guess I could,
you know,

261
00:13:50,356 --> 00:13:51,907
come by for dessert.

262
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,710
- Oh, so you just want
to eat my pie.

263
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:55,828
Is that it?

264
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:13,645
- Happy thanksgiving,
Mr. Mitchell.

265
00:14:13,513 --> 00:14:15,848
- Happy thanksgiving.

266
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,251
- I'll be at Arthur's by 1:00,
home by 4:00.

267
00:14:36,286 --> 00:14:39,254
A serial killer's thanksgiving
recipe for success.

268
00:14:39,289 --> 00:14:40,739
- How can none
of these be big enough?

269
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:42,708
- Well, maybe if we,
um...

270
00:14:42,742 --> 00:14:44,877
turn the bird on its side

271
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:46,044
and then--and, um--

272
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:47,212
Hey, Dex.

273
00:14:47,246 --> 00:14:49,298
- Howdy, pilgrim.

274
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,216
- Did you hear that the pilgrims
didn't eat turkey

275
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,935
on the first thanksgiving?

276
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:54,419
- Really?

277
00:14:54,437 --> 00:14:57,806
- They ate corn and eel,
which the native americans

278
00:14:57,857 --> 00:14:59,758
taught them to plant and fish.

279
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:01,259
- Then the pilgrims
slaughtered them all,

280
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:03,111
took their food,
and went to church the next day

281
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:08,617
to thank god
for all their good luck.

282
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:11,153
- Mm, it's a phase.
Don't worry about it.

283
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:15,607
- What you said about traditions
shaping our kids...

284
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,493
My not going to work,
will that... misshape them?

285
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:19,878
- Look.

286
00:15:19,913 --> 00:15:22,214
I wish it was otherwise,
but you'll be home soon, right?

287
00:15:22,248 --> 00:15:26,618
- Right.
I just--

288
00:15:26,636 --> 00:15:28,220
I don't want
to do any damage.

289
00:15:28,254 --> 00:15:30,756
- You're a parent.

290
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,474
Parents do damage.

291
00:15:32,508 --> 00:15:34,459
Hopefully we'll do enough
of the good stuff

292
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:36,228
to balance it out.

293
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:39,130
- Hopefully.

294
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:41,633
Thanks.

295
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,570
- "Ashes to ashes..."

296
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,073
- Doughnut to doughnut.

297
00:15:48,107 --> 00:15:49,307
It's all the store
had left.

298
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,109
- What are you doing here?

299
00:15:51,143 --> 00:15:52,611
- Avoiding Christine.

300
00:15:52,645 --> 00:15:54,246
She can be a little intense.

301
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,081
- Tell me about it.

302
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:58,483
She keeps calling to set
that interview with me.

303
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,085
- You said you'd do it.

304
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,821
- Little busy here.

305
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,423
Look at the timing
of the Trinity kills.

306
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:08,377
15 in december,
40 in july and august,

307
00:16:08,428 --> 00:16:10,929
20 or so in the spring.

308
00:16:10,964 --> 00:16:12,180
What's the pattern?

309
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:15,350
- Long-haul truck driver?

310
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:17,602
Migrant worker?

311
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:18,804
Some kind of salesman.

312
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,889
- Yeah.

313
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,057
- Gobble, gobble.

314
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:25,444
- She's nothing
if not persistent.

315
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:27,029
- Hey, babe.
What are you doing here?

316
00:16:27,063 --> 00:16:30,065
- I thought I'd bring
thanksgiving to you.

317
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,200
- How sweet.

318
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:33,485
- There's enough
for both of you.

319
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,570
- Oh, thanks,
but I'm heading out.

320
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,823
- Debra's taking the day off.

321
00:16:37,857 --> 00:16:39,708
- Fuck that.
I'll be multitasking.

322
00:16:39,742 --> 00:16:42,077
- Well, I guess you can
take the day off too.

323
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:46,164
- Sure he can.

324
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,668
- Yeah, let me just, uh,
check with the boss.

325
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:53,672
We'll go eat.

326
00:16:53,706 --> 00:16:56,258
- So, Debra,
how are you feeling?

327
00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:58,143
- Do you mind if we put off
that interview

328
00:16:58,177 --> 00:16:59,544
until after the holiday?

329
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:01,930
- I'm not here as a reporter.

330
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:05,100
I'm here as Joey's girlfriend.

331
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,352
- My condolences.

332
00:17:09,272 --> 00:17:12,190
You know, he really cares
about you.

333
00:17:12,224 --> 00:17:15,277
After you got shot, you were
all he could talk about.

334
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:17,029
Really messed him up.

335
00:17:17,063 --> 00:17:18,697
- Well, that makes
two of us.

336
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,832
- I just--

337
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:25,587
I just wanted to say,
um...

338
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:29,257
I'm really sorry about
what happened to you.

339
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,579
I can't even imagine
looking into the eyes

340
00:17:34,547 --> 00:17:37,749
of the person you love...

341
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,768
Watching as he takes
his last breath.

342
00:17:44,757 --> 00:17:46,424
- Let's hope you never
have to.

343
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:59,571
- You got Lloyd Paulson
to confess?

344
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,941
- Been waiting ten years
to close this one.

345
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:04,659
I promised
the victim's husband

346
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:06,578
I'd find the man
who killed his wife.

347
00:18:06,612 --> 00:18:07,946
Finally lived up
to that promise.

348
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:10,048
- You should go
tell the husband.

349
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:11,666
Give him something
to be thankful for.

350
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:13,251
<i>- As soon as I process
that pendejo.</i>

351
00:18:13,285 --> 00:18:15,120
Do you want to come with?

352
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:18,590
- To a next-of-kin
notification?

353
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,725
- It is official business.

354
00:18:29,235 --> 00:18:30,519
- Kyle.

355
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,521
- Happy thanksgiving.

356
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,656
- To you too.

357
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,141
- Kyle.

358
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,609
What a nice surprise.

359
00:18:37,643 --> 00:18:39,661
- Apparently Jonah didn't
mention inviting me.

360
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:43,832
I just wanted
to drop by and say hi.

361
00:18:43,866 --> 00:18:48,820
It's my first thanksgiving
without my family and I...

362
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,656
Didn't know what
to do with myself.

363
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:56,211
- I suppose you should eat
with us.

364
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,663
Full tables,
full hearts,

365
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,048
full bellies.

366
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,001
Come on in.

367
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:06,888
- Aunt Deb's here!

368
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,507
- Happy thanksgiving,
turkeys.

369
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:12,894
Thanks for the video.

370
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,813
- Hi, Deb.
- Hi, Deb.

371
00:19:14,847 --> 00:19:16,448
- Hi.

372
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:17,849
Who's that?

373
00:19:17,867 --> 00:19:19,901
- Danny and grace's dad.
- Danny, let me help.

374
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,019
You don't know where
that piece is.

375
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,787
- Ah.

376
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,039
Where's Dexter?

377
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:25,857
- He's at some crime thing

378
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,025
in Monroe .

379
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,360
Said he'd be back for dinner.

380
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,829
- He's more like dad
every day.

381
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:31,880
- Come look at our puzzle.

382
00:19:31,914 --> 00:19:33,364
We've already got the corners.

383
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,200
- Cody, leave her alone.

384
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:36,701
- You don't want to help?

385
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,720
- I'm sorry, little man,
but I've got work to do.

386
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,755
- Oh.

387
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:47,045
- You are good.

388
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:49,264
- Another three hours to go.

389
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,515
- Oh, when do you want
to put in

390
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:51,983
the broccoli-cheese
casserole?

391
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,735
- Uh, about an hour before.

392
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:54,936
The sweet potatoes
need an hour

393
00:19:54,987 --> 00:19:56,271
and the corn pudding needs
about 30 minutes.

394
00:19:56,322 --> 00:19:57,606
- Is it all gonna fit?

395
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:01,026
No.

396
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,578
None of it's gonna fit.
What was I thinking?

397
00:20:03,613 --> 00:20:04,946
- Well, you were
thinking that,

398
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,398
"My fabulous neighbor has,
not one, but two ovens."

399
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:10,502
You know, you really are
a lifesaver.

400
00:20:10,536 --> 00:20:12,787
You should just wear
a red cross on your forehead.

401
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:16,091
Oven crisis.

402
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:17,242
- Deb, can you
watch the kids?

403
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,710
Harrison's asleep.

404
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:20,595
- Uh, actually, I was gonna
try to get some...

405
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,963
- Oh!

406
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:23,765
- Work done.

407
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,100
- Vince, hi.

408
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:26,801
Vince, Elliot.
Elliot, Vince.

409
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:27,936
- Hi.
Uh, bye.

410
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,272
- Uh, bye.

411
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:32,474
- Bye.

412
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:33,725
- They're using his oven.

413
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,811
- Oh, well, guess I'll be using
his oven too.

414
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,564
Chocolate lava cakes.
My specialty.

415
00:20:39,598 --> 00:20:41,116
- You have a specialty?

416
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,785
- A river of chocolate love
that melts in your mouth.

417
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:44,953
- Wow.

418
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:46,788
You can make anything
sound perverted.

419
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:48,573
- It's a gift.

420
00:20:55,614 --> 00:20:57,966
- Arthur seems to be
in a decent mood.

421
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,051
Maybe I'll be able
to slip out early.

422
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,452
It's almost 1:00.

423
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,804
You want me
to set the table?

424
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:04,455
- No, we've got
to watch the game first.

425
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:05,974
- The game?
- Yeah.

426
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:07,259
It's tradition, Kyle.

427
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:09,177
- Ah.

428
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,130
Will the kids be joining us?

429
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:14,766
- That too would
be tradition,

430
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,486
but apparently Jonah
has forgotten.

431
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:20,188
- I'm sure he's on his way.

432
00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:22,807
He knows how important
holidays are to you.

433
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:30,031
- Not such a decent mood
after all.

434
00:21:32,785 --> 00:21:36,204
- Do you think Rebecca
could come out now?

435
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:37,622
- I suppose.

436
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,624
I'll go get her.

437
00:21:42,762 --> 00:21:44,462
- She grounded or something?

438
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,014
- Oh, no.

439
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:48,717
No, nothing like that.

440
00:21:58,778 --> 00:22:00,812
- This is Carl Haas?

441
00:22:00,846 --> 00:22:02,480
- He's been in a persistent
vegetative state

442
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:04,649
for several years.

443
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:06,318
Stepped off a sidewalk,

444
00:22:06,352 --> 00:22:09,738
got hit by a bus.

445
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:12,791
- I didn't know.

446
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:15,210
It's been a long time.

447
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:18,880
- Would it be possible to have
a moment alone with him?

448
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,915
- Have a good turkey day.

449
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:28,673
- Tell him.

450
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:30,091
- Like he can hear me.

451
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,727
- He'll hear you.

452
00:22:42,405 --> 00:22:46,491
- Mr. Haas, I'm the one
who told you about your wife.

453
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:52,063
I also promised
that I'd fi--

454
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:55,533
This is pointless.

455
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:59,754
- Mr. Haas,
Angel knows how much

456
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:02,924
your wife meant to you...

457
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,676
And he wants you to know...

458
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:16,221
- I want you to know...

459
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:20,308
That we found
the guy who killed her.

460
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,593
I wish--

461
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,647
I wish we would have
found him sooner.

462
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:28,933
Really, I wish he would have
never killed your wife,

463
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:31,453
but I can't change that.

464
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,492
Can't change anything.

465
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,878
But we got the guy.

466
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:42,414
We got him.

467
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:48,086
- Hello, Mr. Butler.
How are you?

468
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,454
- Well, I'm fine, Rebecca.

469
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:51,639
- Kyle, you up for a little
pre-game football toss?

470
00:23:51,674 --> 00:23:53,758
- I suppose.

471
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:56,177
- I'll go help mom
in the kitchen.

472
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:03,318
- At least I have
one perfect child.

473
00:24:03,352 --> 00:24:05,653
- Yeah, so it
would appear.

474
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:07,689
- Come on.

475
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,645
Normally Jonah supplies
the football.

476
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,030
- How about baseball?

477
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:18,483
- No.
We throw the baseball in spring.

478
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:19,784
Thanksgiving
we throw the football.

479
00:24:19,818 --> 00:24:22,036
Traditions matter,
Kyle.

480
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:24,672
- Yes, they...

481
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:26,007
Shape people.

482
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,125
- Yeah,
and give children

483
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:29,461
a sense of history,
tradition.

484
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,963
Teaches them who they are
and what's expected of them.

485
00:24:31,997 --> 00:24:34,665
- And what is expected of them?

486
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,335
- Generosity,
common sense, obedience.

487
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:40,054
It's a father's responsibility
to set the boundaries.

488
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:44,526
Child's duty to honor them.

489
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,110
No, there's nothing
down there.

490
00:24:46,145 --> 00:24:49,147
Stop!
Kyle, no!

491
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:55,036
I made that...

492
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,155
When I was still confused.

493
00:25:00,743 --> 00:25:02,710
- Well, it's beautiful.

494
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:09,700
- Which is why I haven't
torn it apart.

495
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:12,837
Probably donate it
to the needy.

496
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:15,039
Obviously I won't
be needing it.

497
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,342
- No, you'll be buried
at sea.

498
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:20,261
- I have a new lease
on life.

499
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,429
Thanks to you.

500
00:25:23,566 --> 00:25:26,384
Hey.

501
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:28,736
Huh.
The best laid plans.

502
00:25:28,771 --> 00:25:32,106
- It's Jonah's.

503
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:34,275
What's the point of giving him
the better things in life

504
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:38,830
if he can't take care
of them?

505
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:48,540
- What kind of father keeps
a coffin in his garage?

506
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:53,678
- What kind of father keeps
blood slides in his shed?

507
00:25:59,418 --> 00:26:00,885
Hey, we can still get some--

508
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,525
Here we go.

509
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,260
- Dad, I don't know
what happened.

510
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,981
It was--the car was parked
in Luke's driveway all night.

511
00:26:13,032 --> 00:26:14,866
I came out this morning and,
you know,

512
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,569
someone had just gone
all mental on it.

513
00:26:19,204 --> 00:26:21,289
Dad, I am so sorry.

514
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:25,577
That's why god invented
car insurance, right?

515
00:26:36,972 --> 00:26:38,723
It'll be okay.

516
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,662
- There.

517
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:04,365
Now it's drivable
till we can get her fixed.

518
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,751
Well...

519
00:27:06,785 --> 00:27:08,086
Game's about to start.

520
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,371
Shall we?

521
00:27:17,046 --> 00:27:18,262
- Come on, Danny.

522
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:19,764
Throw it here.

523
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:21,099
- Oh, good one.

524
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,885
- Hey, you two.
No wiffle ball in the house.

525
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,836
- I don't know how you do it.

526
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:27,605
All these kids
at home at the same time.

527
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,007
- Thanksgiving's only four days.

528
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:31,309
You should try keeping
them entertained

529
00:27:31,343 --> 00:27:32,610
for three months
in the summer.

530
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:34,979
- Yeah, plus spring break
and christmas break.

531
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:37,448
- That's when you're really
climbing the walls.

532
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:41,869
- June, july, august...

533
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:43,821
December.

534
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:46,207
Oh...

535
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:48,076
Fu-u-udge.

536
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:50,044
Trinity's
in the school system.

537
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,996
- Probably a gain of about--
- Quinn.

538
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,197
- Joey, it's Deb.

539
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,166
His kill schedule matches
the school year.

540
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,718
Trinity could be a janitor.

541
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:58,920
He could be a cafeteria worker,
a bus driver,

542
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,421
a teacher or principal.

543
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:01,923
We got to get
to the station.

544
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,508
- I haven't eaten yet.

545
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,510
- Jesus, grab a drumstick
to go.

546
00:28:05,544 --> 00:28:07,378
- Deb, no one's
working today

547
00:28:07,396 --> 00:28:08,379
and we're gonna
need a warrant

548
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:09,981
to access
any school databases.

549
00:28:10,015 --> 00:28:11,599
- We can find a judge.

550
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,101
- Yeah, who's gonna love us
for tearing him

551
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:14,218
away from his family.

552
00:28:14,236 --> 00:28:15,269
Come on.

553
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,722
We're not gonna get
anywhere today.

554
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,907
- Fu--

555
00:28:19,942 --> 00:28:21,559
Fudge.

556
00:28:22,778 --> 00:28:24,696
- Break in a case?

557
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,414
- We'll see.

558
00:28:30,452 --> 00:28:33,421
Not a horrible thanksgiving,
right?

559
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:36,407
- No, actually,
it's kind of nice.

560
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,042
- You sound surprised.

561
00:28:38,076 --> 00:28:40,294
- I am a little.

562
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:41,879
- Hmm.

563
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:45,249
So having a girlfriend isn't
so bad after all?

564
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,718
- You with the labels.

565
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,920
- Why does it matter?

566
00:28:49,938 --> 00:28:53,424
- I just--

567
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:55,593
I care about you.

568
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:57,945
I'd kind of like
to have it returned.

569
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:02,734
- Come here.

570
00:29:07,272 --> 00:29:11,576
- I have a better idea.

571
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,277
- Aww.

572
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:15,613
You are so my girlfriend.

573
00:29:21,303 --> 00:29:22,787
- Get--get--

574
00:29:22,805 --> 00:29:24,088
Get him!
Get him!

575
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:25,456
Get--get--get--
get him!

576
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:26,891
Ah!

577
00:29:26,925 --> 00:29:28,392
- Oh, it's okay.

578
00:29:28,427 --> 00:29:29,727
They didn't get
the first down.

579
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:32,897
- Jonah seems safe
for the moment.

580
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:34,816
I'm not a big football fan.

581
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,468
I think I'll go see
if I can help Sally.

582
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:41,105
- Oh, that's very
nice of you.

583
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:46,661
- Look at that.
There's three men on him.

584
00:29:46,695 --> 00:29:49,113
- Yeah, I know.

585
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:54,652
- This room's kind of young
for a teenager.

586
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,176
Are those to keep
someone out

587
00:30:02,211 --> 00:30:05,179
or keep someone in?

588
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:17,942
My god.
He locks his daughter in here.

589
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,289
You need any help?

590
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:34,292
I'm completely useless
in the kitchen.

591
00:30:34,326 --> 00:30:35,910
- Sure.

592
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:38,996
Uh, something
for the centerpiece.

593
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,665
Roses.

594
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:41,699
Dad always likes these.

595
00:30:41,717 --> 00:30:43,668
- Everything for dad, huh?

596
00:30:46,037 --> 00:30:49,140
Those locks on your door
for him too?

597
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,982
- He says they're there
to protect me.

598
00:30:58,016 --> 00:30:59,684
- Do they?

599
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:05,523
- Third down.

600
00:31:05,557 --> 00:31:06,824
- He's open.
He's open!

601
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:08,192
Go, go!

602
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:10,111
Touchdown!
- Oh!

603
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,229
- What a play.

604
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:24,592
- No.
No, dad.

605
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:29,597
Ow!

606
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:37,021
- And that's
for my windshield.

607
00:31:40,309 --> 00:31:43,311
Things of beauty need
to be honored.

608
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:57,458
- I ran away once.

609
00:31:57,492 --> 00:32:00,494
He caught me and...

610
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:01,712
It was bad.

611
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:04,215
- It's not always
gonna be like this.

612
00:32:08,253 --> 00:32:11,639
Jonah told me
that you're helping him.

613
00:32:11,673 --> 00:32:13,391
- Yeah, if you can call
it that.

614
00:32:13,425 --> 00:32:15,893
- You can help me too.

615
00:32:15,928 --> 00:32:18,462
Get me out of here.

616
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:20,932
- You just need
to wait a while.

617
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:25,636
You're too young
to be on your own.

618
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:29,190
- I don't have
to be on my own.

619
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,192
I could be with you.

620
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:32,777
<i>- With me?</i>

621
00:32:32,811 --> 00:32:37,448
- Jonah also says you're nice.

622
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:39,149
- I try to be.

623
00:32:39,167 --> 00:32:41,619
- If you're nice to me,

624
00:32:41,653 --> 00:32:44,755
I can be nice to you.

625
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,341
I'll do anything you want.

626
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:49,377
- Whoa.
I don't--

627
00:32:49,428 --> 00:32:52,663
Rebecca, you're 15.

628
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:55,016
I don't want anything
from you.

629
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:57,468
- I don't believe you.

630
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:58,602
Look, I know what guys like.

631
00:32:58,637 --> 00:33:01,055
- No.
- Rebecca?

632
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:03,441
Go inside.

633
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:11,615
- Sally, it's not--
- Shh.

634
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,485
I am so sorry
about Rebecca's behavior.

635
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,153
- Oh.

636
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:20,992
- Just please don't say
anything to Arthur.

637
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:25,963
Kyle, you can't.

638
00:33:25,998 --> 00:33:27,882
Whatever you did
with Rebecca...

639
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,300
- I didn't.

640
00:33:29,334 --> 00:33:30,584
- Whatever you're
going to do,

641
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:31,752
I don't care.

642
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:33,888
Just please,
I'm begging you.

643
00:33:33,922 --> 00:33:36,040
Don't tell him.
- I wouldn't.

644
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,642
I wouldn't.
I won't.

645
00:33:38,677 --> 00:33:40,878
- Please.

646
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:43,347
- Yeah, I promise.

647
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:45,382
- Thank you.

648
00:33:53,692 --> 00:33:56,911
- What the hell is he doing
to these people?

649
00:34:01,917 --> 00:34:03,000
Rita, hi.

650
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:04,902
- Hey.
How far away are you?

651
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,089
- Uh, probably
about an hour or so.

652
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:09,840
- All right, well,
I don't want you to be surprised

653
00:34:09,875 --> 00:34:10,875
when you get home.

654
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,009
- Why?
What?

655
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:13,094
- Cody fell into your shed.

656
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:14,411
- What?
Is he okay?

657
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,013
What happened?
- Well, he's fine.

658
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:18,432
He hit a wiffle ball
onto the top of the shed,

659
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:21,185
climbed up to get it,
the skylight cracked...

660
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,853
And he fell through.

661
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:25,606
Elliot was gonna push
on the air conditioner.

662
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,058
- No, don't.

663
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:29,060
- Uh, he didn't.

664
00:34:29,094 --> 00:34:31,428
He took off the door
with an axe.

665
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:33,864
- So my shed has no door?

666
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,766
- Dexter, Cody was scared
and crying, all right?

667
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,868
I told Elliot to get him
out however he could.

668
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:39,236
- Yeah, of course.
Of course.

669
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:41,155
I'll...

670
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,873
Thank Elliot when I get home.

671
00:34:42,908 --> 00:34:44,742
- Well, I'll see you soon,
okay?

672
00:34:47,712 --> 00:34:50,631
No one can get into
the trunk's false bottom.

673
00:34:50,665 --> 00:34:53,417
- You didn't think anyone could
get into your shed either.

674
00:34:53,451 --> 00:34:56,971
- I gotta get home now.

675
00:35:00,225 --> 00:35:02,927
- Arthur, I just got a call
and I think I have to--

676
00:35:06,181 --> 00:35:09,733
- Jonah, what happened?

677
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:12,436
- I whacked it
on the coffee table.

678
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,938
- My son, the klutz.

679
00:35:13,972 --> 00:35:17,474
This team hasn't been the same
since they traded johnson.

680
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:20,995
- What else will he do
to Jonah if I leave?

681
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:36,293
- Turkey wraps, icees.

682
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:38,462
- And cuervo silver.

683
00:35:38,496 --> 00:35:39,597
Only the best for you.

684
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:51,308
- You know, I was thinking...

685
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:53,644
Carl Haas's wife gets mugged.

686
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:55,396
Boom.
She's dead.

687
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:56,730
Carl gets hit by a bus.

688
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,782
Boom.
He's a vegetable.

689
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:03,320
- You never know when you
wake up in the morning

690
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:04,321
what the day will bring.

691
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:07,408
- I love you.

692
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:11,629
I love you.

693
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:19,420
- Are you saying that
because you're afraid

694
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,671
you'll get hit by a bus?

695
00:36:20,705 --> 00:36:22,506
- No. Well...

696
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:26,677
Yes, but...

697
00:36:26,711 --> 00:36:29,897
I just want you to know
what I know

698
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:31,515
before I don't know it
anymore.

699
00:36:34,903 --> 00:36:38,022
And I love you.

700
00:36:38,056 --> 00:36:39,240
I love you!

701
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:40,608
- Shh.
I can hear you.

702
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:43,227
- I love Maria Esperanza
Di Alma LaGuer--

703
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:45,696
- Shh!

704
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:54,371
- I'm not gonna say it.

705
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:01,929
- You don't love me?

706
00:37:01,963 --> 00:37:06,183
- I'm afraid
if I say it...

707
00:37:06,218 --> 00:37:08,919
Something will happen,
like you'll get hit by a bus.

708
00:37:24,035 --> 00:37:26,370
So watch out
for moving buses.

709
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:31,242
'cause I love...

710
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:35,445
Angel Juan Marcos Batista.

711
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,309
- Ah!
Rats! Ow!

712
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:49,510
- Uh-oh. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

713
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:52,313
Come here.

714
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:53,931
- Ooh.
- There you go.

715
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:55,299
Isn't thanksgiving fun?

716
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:57,401
- Thank god it's only
once a year.

717
00:37:57,435 --> 00:37:58,686
Do you have any ice?

718
00:37:58,737 --> 00:38:00,154
- No.
Peas are better.

719
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:02,773
Come on, Rita.
Give peas a chance.

720
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:05,409
- Now come on.
Take a seat.

721
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:06,777
- Oh.

722
00:38:06,811 --> 00:38:10,614
- All right.
Okay.

723
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:16,120
- There.

724
00:38:16,154 --> 00:38:17,921
Did you say, "rats"?

725
00:38:19,424 --> 00:38:21,375
I guess I've been spending
too much time with the kids.

726
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:25,596
- Thanks for this.

727
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:29,133
- I like taking care of you.

728
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,895
I am so sorry.

729
00:38:41,946 --> 00:38:43,847
I don't know what
I was thinking.

730
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:45,316
- Yeah, I don't either.

731
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,784
- Well, no,
it's just

732
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:48,619
we have this connection
and it's not just because

733
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:49,853
we're both lonely--

734
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:51,238
- No, I'm not lonely.

735
00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:52,706
I have Dexter.

736
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:54,958
- The guy who's never home?

737
00:39:13,011 --> 00:39:16,213
- Hey, uh...

738
00:39:16,231 --> 00:39:17,514
Deb, I'm gonna take off.

739
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:18,649
Not feeling so hot.

740
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:21,551
- Oh, no, you don't.

741
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:23,487
Here.

742
00:39:23,521 --> 00:39:24,822
You're my wingman.

743
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:26,073
- No, this family doesn't
really need me around.

744
00:39:26,107 --> 00:39:27,691
I'll see you at the--
- No, no, shh!

745
00:39:27,725 --> 00:39:30,110
You belong here
as much as anyone does.

746
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:33,230
And if you go, I'll be
the one single person here.

747
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:34,365
I really don't feel like
remembering

748
00:39:34,399 --> 00:39:37,567
why that is, you know?

749
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,403
Why Frank's gone.

750
00:39:39,421 --> 00:39:40,754
Why I'm here.

751
00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:42,072
- Yeah.

752
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,259
Hey... Yeah.
I'll stay.

753
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:48,379
But I need booze.

754
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:50,881
- You and me both.

755
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,942
- Hi.

756
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:05,362
- Are you the one my mom
told me not to talk to?

757
00:40:05,397 --> 00:40:08,398
- Awkward.

758
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,950
- And for this bounty
before us,

759
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,485
we thank you and look to you,
oh, lord,

760
00:40:11,569 --> 00:40:13,454
to strengthen our resolve
to strive,

761
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:15,122
to seek, to find,

762
00:40:15,156 --> 00:40:16,790
and not to yield.

763
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:17,958
Amen.

764
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:19,243
- Amen.
- Amen.

765
00:40:19,277 --> 00:40:20,711
- Looks marvelous, Sally.

766
00:40:20,745 --> 00:40:24,614
- Thank you, Arthur.

767
00:40:24,632 --> 00:40:28,585
- We, uh--
We have a little...

768
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,953
Family tradition, Kyle,

769
00:40:29,971 --> 00:40:33,290
before we start...

770
00:40:33,308 --> 00:40:37,127
Of saying what
we're thankful for.

771
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,228
I'll start.

772
00:40:38,263 --> 00:40:40,814
I'm thankful for this family.

773
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:42,099
Pass your plates.

774
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:44,234
Sally?

775
00:40:44,269 --> 00:40:45,969
- I'm--

776
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:50,440
I'm thankful
for this lovely home...

777
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,776
And for my son,

778
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,946
who I am so proud of.

779
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,147
- Me too.

780
00:40:57,165 --> 00:41:01,668
- Is that all?

781
00:41:01,703 --> 00:41:04,955
- And for my
beautiful daughter,

782
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:10,494
who is growing up
so quickly.

783
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:15,015
I am so blessed.

784
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:17,217
- I'm thankful
that Mrs. Wilder

785
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:19,503
gave us an extra two days
to finish our report

786
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:20,670
on aeschylus.

787
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:28,145
And I'm also thankful
for this nice home.

788
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:30,364
- Is this what it takes
to survive with him?

789
00:41:34,486 --> 00:41:39,907
- Um, I'm thankful
for this house too...

790
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:42,159
And for god.

791
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:45,879
- You know what
I'm thankful for?

792
00:41:45,914 --> 00:41:48,365
My car.

793
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,392
- I'm thankful for yams.

794
00:41:58,426 --> 00:42:01,094
- Yams?

795
00:42:01,095 --> 00:42:04,214
- Comfort food.

796
00:42:04,232 --> 00:42:07,234
Thank you all for
the comfort of your home.

797
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:09,653
- Where no one said
they were thankful for me.

798
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:16,743
Did you, Jonah?

799
00:42:16,778 --> 00:42:19,413
Did you say you were thankful
for me, Jonah?

800
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:20,664
What's that?

801
00:42:20,698 --> 00:42:24,868
- I did not say
I was thankful for you...

802
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:28,071
Because I'm not.

803
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:31,241
- I am so thankful
for you, Arthur.

804
00:42:31,259 --> 00:42:32,409
- Shut up, cunt.

805
00:42:32,427 --> 00:42:34,244
- Whoa, Arthur.

806
00:42:34,262 --> 00:42:36,547
- Kyle, perhaps it's time
for you to go.

807
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:38,748
- I think I should stay.

808
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:40,267
- Yeah, sure.
Stay.

809
00:42:40,301 --> 00:42:41,418
Watch the show.

810
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:42,752
- I'm thankful for you, daddy.

811
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,254
- Go to your room, Vera.

812
00:42:44,272 --> 00:42:45,589
- No!
She's not Vera!

813
00:42:45,607 --> 00:42:47,691
And she's not
your goddamn prisoner

814
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:49,893
and she's not
eight anymore!

815
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:51,895
This whole life--

816
00:42:51,929 --> 00:42:54,114
Your life--
is a lie!

817
00:42:54,148 --> 00:42:56,766
These are lies!

818
00:42:56,784 --> 00:42:58,619
Fucking community hero?

819
00:42:58,653 --> 00:43:00,037
- Jonah, this isn't the way.

820
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:04,041
- I know who you really are.

821
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:05,042
- Oh, who am I?

822
00:43:05,076 --> 00:43:09,446
- You're a killer.

823
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:13,166
Sucking the fucking life
out of all of us!

824
00:43:13,217 --> 00:43:14,618
Mom, Becca, me!

825
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:15,952
- Fucking little--
- No, daddy!

826
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,421
Don't!
Daddy, no!

827
00:43:17,455 --> 00:43:20,390
- You're killing us!

828
00:43:20,425 --> 00:43:22,292
- Put her down.

829
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,595
- Fuck you and fuck Vera.

830
00:43:24,629 --> 00:43:26,763
- Don't.

831
00:43:30,968 --> 00:43:33,303
Fuck you!

832
00:43:37,475 --> 00:43:40,444
- Get the fuck off him!

833
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,648
- Oh, my god!
No! No!

834
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,333
No, daddy!
No!

835
00:43:49,087 --> 00:43:50,170
- No, you don't have
to kill him!

836
00:43:50,204 --> 00:43:52,205
No! Dad!
Dad!

837
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:01,181
- I should have fucking killed
you when I had the chance.

838
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,051
Oh, my god!

839
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:05,686
Arthur!

840
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,807
- Sally.

841
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:15,445
Thankful to be out
of that fucking house!

842
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,864
- You showed Trinity
the monster in you.

843
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,316
He'll see you coming now.

844
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,485
- I don't know.
Seeing them like that--

845
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:23,520
He's destroyed everyone
in that family.

846
00:44:23,538 --> 00:44:26,022
- That's what happens to people
who live with a monster.

847
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,076
- I am nothing like him!

848
00:44:29,127 --> 00:44:30,744
My family is nothing
like that.

849
00:44:30,795 --> 00:44:32,879
- What's 18 more years of being
with you gonna do to them?

850
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:36,366
- Arthur's terrorized them
into maintaining his cover.

851
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,335
They're nothing
but human shields.

852
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:42,673
- The only reason you started
dating Rita was for cover.

853
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:46,009
She's much more than that now.

854
00:44:46,043 --> 00:44:49,012
She and the kids.
Much more.

855
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,019
My family is nothing
like that.

856
00:45:00,224 --> 00:45:02,025
Hey.
- Hey.

857
00:45:02,059 --> 00:45:03,610
- Dexter's home!

858
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:04,611
- Who's hungry?

859
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:06,363
- Me.
- I am.

860
00:45:06,397 --> 00:45:09,583
- I am so happy
you're home.

861
00:45:09,617 --> 00:45:11,785
- Oh, me too.

862
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:13,036
- Mm.

863
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:15,905
Mm.

864
00:45:15,923 --> 00:45:17,924
All right.

865
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:20,711
Uh, Cody, why don't you help
your aunt Deb set the table?

866
00:45:20,745 --> 00:45:25,098
Astor, I can use your help
in the kitchen.

867
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:27,634
- Sorry about your shed,
Dexter.

868
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:30,554
- Hey.

869
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:31,938
Huh.

870
00:45:31,973 --> 00:45:35,358
As long as you're okay,
that's all that matters.

871
00:45:38,596 --> 00:45:40,397
I'm gonna go check on the shed.

872
00:45:40,431 --> 00:45:42,566
Make sure it's safe in there.

873
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,902
- Miss us?

874
00:45:45,936 --> 00:45:47,654
- You have no idea.

875
00:45:56,664 --> 00:45:58,999
God, I miss my apartment.

876
00:46:06,791 --> 00:46:08,759
They're safe.

877
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:10,727
So's my trunk.

878
00:46:14,899 --> 00:46:16,983
- Is anything
really safe here?

879
00:46:17,068 --> 00:46:21,772
The kids, Rita?

880
00:46:21,806 --> 00:46:22,939
You?

881
00:46:22,973 --> 00:46:25,492
- I'll find an alternative.

882
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,649
- Trinity was supposed
to be the alternative.

883
00:46:38,989 --> 00:46:42,626
- Uh, spoons go inside
or outside the knives?

884
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:45,011
- Um...

885
00:46:45,046 --> 00:46:48,164
Surprise us.

886
00:46:48,182 --> 00:46:49,165
Ouch.

887
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:51,668
- Can I see your scars,
aunt Deb?

888
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:56,139
- Sure.

889
00:46:59,176 --> 00:47:01,695
- Does it still hurt?

890
00:47:01,729 --> 00:47:05,115
- Um...

891
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:08,068
Sometimes...

892
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:09,352
Here.

893
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:14,374
- Did you see that guy die?

894
00:47:14,408 --> 00:47:16,910
- I did.

895
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:18,528
Looked right in his eyes.

896
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:20,247
- Were his eyes open?

897
00:47:20,298 --> 00:47:23,834
- Yeah.

898
00:47:23,868 --> 00:47:26,870
Watched him take his
last breath.

899
00:47:31,175 --> 00:47:32,392
How did she know that?

900
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:34,344
- How did who know what?

901
00:47:34,378 --> 00:47:38,181
- Nobody but me.

902
00:47:38,215 --> 00:47:40,567
How much did you tell Christine
about the Lundy shooting?

903
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:41,902
- Nothing.

904
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:43,436
- Well, maybe you left
Lundy's file

905
00:47:43,487 --> 00:47:44,721
lying around accidentally.

906
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:45,906
- No.

907
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:48,224
- And maybe Christine saw some
of the pictures.

908
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,026
She saw how he was lying
on his side,

909
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,611
how he fell in front of me,
so that I could see him

910
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:53,029
take his last--

911
00:47:53,063 --> 00:47:55,949
- Morgan, I'm telling you,
I learned my lesson.

912
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,834
I never even took the Lundy
files out of the station.

913
00:47:57,869 --> 00:47:59,586
There's no way she
could have seen it.

914
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:07,961
- Dinner's ready.

915
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:11,932
- Not all happy families
are alike.

916
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:14,517
They are happy...

917
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:16,720
Aren't they?

918
00:48:16,754 --> 00:48:20,140
Are they normal kids?

919
00:48:20,191 --> 00:48:25,395
How can you tell a loving wife
from a frightened one?

920
00:48:25,429 --> 00:48:27,731
A friendly neighbor.

921
00:48:27,765 --> 00:48:29,616
Co-worker.

922
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:31,484
Sister.

923
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:34,571
Son.

924
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:37,574
Are any of them
what they seem?

925
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:41,945
Or are they little bombs
waiting to explode?

926
00:48:41,963 --> 00:48:45,498
- Happy thanksgiving, son.

927
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:49,169
- Dexter?
Everything okay?

928
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,588
- Yeah.

929
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:53,089
It is, isn't it?

930
00:48:53,123 --> 00:48:55,792
- Yes.

931
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:59,145
Everything is exactly
the way it should be.

932
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:02,899
Perfect.

933
00:49:02,934 --> 00:49:04,401
- Yeah, you're right.

934
00:49:04,435 --> 00:49:05,819
- Why don't we go around
the table and everybody

935
00:49:05,853 --> 00:49:06,937
say what they're thankful for?

936
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:09,272
- No!

937
00:49:09,306 --> 00:49:11,808
I don't want this yummy food
to get cold.

938
00:49:11,826 --> 00:49:14,277
- I'm thankful for Dexter.

939
00:49:19,316 --> 00:49:22,285
- Let's eat.

940
00:49:26,123 --> 00:49:27,674
- Sure you don't want to stay?

941
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,376
- I'm too tired
to spend the night.

942
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:30,710
You made sure of that.

943
00:49:33,464 --> 00:49:35,164
- See you tomorrow?

944
00:49:35,182 --> 00:49:38,551
- And the day after that
and after that.

945
00:49:41,055 --> 00:49:43,273
I'm here if you
change your mind.

946
00:49:43,307 --> 00:49:45,025
- Good night.

947
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,028
- Good night.

948
00:50:03,694 --> 00:50:05,662
Joey.

Hi, dad.
