Proudly Presents

00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:25,275
Dexter - 04x06 - If I Had a Hammer

4
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:45,364


5
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:47,731
Previously on Dexter...

6
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:49,710
Deb's alive. They're taking her
to the hospital.

7
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:50,671
Who did this?

8
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:53,167
He says it's smelling like
the vacation murderer's m.o.

9
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:54,632
Then that's...
Lundy.

10
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:56,906
Lundy devoted his life
to hunting trinity.

11
00:01:56,941 --> 00:02:00,808
If it was trinity, it would explain
why deb is alive and lundy isn't.

12
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:04,253
I'm gonna follow lundy's theory
and check his hotel room for clues.

13
00:02:04,288 --> 00:02:07,738
You can't let these be logged
into evidence.

14
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:11,988
I just unsealed the juvy records
of johnny rose,

15
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:13,488
our vacation murder suspect.

16
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:16,723
Shoplifting with his high school
girlfriend nikki wald.

17
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,503
Nikki!

18
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:20,525
Put the gun down.

19
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:23,577
We got 'em, morgan.
Got who?

20
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:26,613
Nikki wald and johnny rose. Well, we got nikki.
Johnny's on his way to the morgue.

21
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:29,003
This department can't risk
a defense attorney

22
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:31,570
turning your romantic involvement
into a courtroom sideshow

23
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,034
every time you work a case together.

24
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,042
What are you saying?

25
00:02:34,077 --> 00:02:37,218
I am saying I need you to transfer
sergeant batista out of homicide.

26
00:02:37,253 --> 00:02:38,484
This is bullshit.

27
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,925
I would have been here sooner, but I got
hung up on the phone. Your landlord called.

28
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,921
oh.

29
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,980
I was just hanging on to the place
until the lease ran out.

30
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:49,915
Why'd you tell me
you got rid of it?

31
00:02:50,226 --> 00:02:52,417
So you didn't have an affair
with my father?

32
00:02:52,452 --> 00:02:54,386
I don't know
who you're looking for, honey,

33
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:55,628
but it ain't me.

34
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:58,101
I'm halfway through
the c.i. Files you gave me.

35
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,269
Maybe then I'll finally get
some answers.

36
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:01,992
Can I help you?

37
00:03:02,027 --> 00:03:03,351
I'm taking on a project.

38
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:05,886
I'd go
with the framing hammer.

39
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:09,925
You made me do this.

40
00:03:14,788 --> 00:03:16,538
What are you doing?

41
00:03:17,777 --> 00:03:20,427
He doesn't belong here.
It doesn't make sense.

42
00:03:21,749 --> 00:03:23,299
Trinity's a husband,

43
00:03:24,222 --> 00:03:25,546
a father.

44
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,128
He's...

45
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:29,062
Like me.

46
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:55,389
Lay aside the garments that are stained
with sin a wolf in sheep's clothing.

47
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,952
Hour by hour, the spitting image
of a normal man.

48
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:02,193
Up at 6:00 a.m.

49
00:04:03,768 --> 00:04:05,889
Breakfast, 7:00 a.m.

50
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,584
Work, 8:30.

51
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:11,713
Study session.

52
00:04:11,748 --> 00:04:13,143
Even on a saturday.

53
00:04:13,998 --> 00:04:16,858
Noon, lunch with faculty.
Out at 3:00.

54
00:04:16,893 --> 00:04:18,440
Dinner at 6:00.

55
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:22,729
Father, husband,
teacher, deacon.

56
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:25,049
All in the name
of blending..

57
00:04:25,963 --> 00:04:29,913
Camouflage
is nature's craftiest trick.

58
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:35,715
This is what makes a home:

59
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,496
the noise of happy children,

60
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:41,262
the warmth
of a full house,

61
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,866
the chill
of an angry wife.

62
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,610
Is that the last
of it?

63
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:50,612
Just a few more things
to pack up.

64
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:53,566
Not like you're dragging it out.
Uh, that's for the kids.

65
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,101
If you're hungry,
there's food in the fridge.

66
00:04:56,344 --> 00:04:59,695
Oh, I could go
for a sandwich.

67
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,996
We're out of bread.

68
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:03,867
She has to forgive me
for my apartment eventually.

69
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,152
Doesn't she?

70
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:10,778
Maybe I should hang on to it
just in case, huh?

71
00:05:14,526 --> 00:05:16,026
This is so awesome.

72
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:18,897
Hello? Dexter.

73
00:05:18,932 --> 00:05:20,104
Hey.
Sorry.

74
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,897
Move out of the way.
Sheesh.

75
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,416
I made an appointment

76
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:39,053
with the new therapist
for tomorrow at noon.

77
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,178
New therapist?

78
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:42,065
It's an emergency,
dexter.

79
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,518
It's an emergency,
dexter.

80
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:47,795
No, of course. I mean,
whatever you need.

81
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,092
This isn't for me.

82
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:51,463
This is for us.

83
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:53,139
This

84
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,612
doesn't belong here.

85
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,132
Hey, can you give me
a ride to the station?

86
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,546
Batista's taking another run
at nikki wald today.

87
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:12,945
She's confessed to everything except 
for the part where she shot me and lundy.

88
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,843
Because she didn't.
Trinity did.

89
00:06:14,878 --> 00:06:18,778
Bui I can't tell deb.
I need a head start.

90
00:06:20,225 --> 00:06:21,303
Morgan.

91
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:24,151
Yes, I know where that is.
Thanks.

92
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:27,889
Got to go. Bludgeoning downtown.

93
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:30,491
Trinity's latest victim. About time.

94
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:32,401
100 ocean gate?

95
00:06:35,284 --> 00:06:36,984
Yeah, how'd you know that?

96
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:40,543
Because that's where lundy
thought it would be.

97
00:06:40,612 --> 00:06:42,772
We could have stopped it
if fucking nikki wald

98
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:46,257
and her shit-stain boyfriend
didn't shoot us.

99
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,174
Deb, it's gonna be okay.

100
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:50,835
I'm going to kill trinity
for you.

101
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:54,287
Can you just give me a ride
to the station, please?

102
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,250
Yeah, I'll drop you off
on my way downtown. Come on.

103
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:11,307
The is the last victim
in the cycle of three.

104
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:13,234
Trinity's done...

105
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:15,262
For now.

106
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:20,207
He's retreated
to the safety of his camouflage.

107
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:23,942
His defense will be down.
Perfect time to strike.

108
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,219
Jesus.

109
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:28,598
I just have to stay ahead
of my colleagues.

110
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:31,703
Two days' worth of decay.
The body's been here since friday.

111
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:34,117
Building was closed over the weekend.
No a/c.

112
00:07:34,152 --> 00:07:36,180
What's the spatter say?

113
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:38,019
Blunt force trauma
to the head.

114
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:39,054
Duh.

115
00:07:39,672 --> 00:07:43,633
Judging from the spray, we're looking
at somebody tall, over six feet.

116
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,368
That all you got?

117
00:07:46,527 --> 00:07:48,627
That's all I can tell ya.

118
00:08:03,698 --> 00:08:05,362
He moved the arm...

119
00:08:05,913 --> 00:08:07,554
For a reason.

120
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,862
Can't leave this behind.

121
00:08:15,897 --> 00:08:18,047
It might get them closer.

122
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:22,338
Give me.

123
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:23,697
That's okay. I got it.

124
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:27,932
Evidence hog. You got buckets
of blood to worry about.

125
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,756
You see
the oval grid pattern there?

126
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,748
Comes from a framing hammer.

127
00:08:34,783 --> 00:08:35,909
Duh.

128
00:08:36,646 --> 00:08:40,748
I'll check some out in the spatter room.
See if I can narrow it down.

129
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:43,233
How do you know
so much about hammers?

130
00:08:43,268 --> 00:08:45,506
Not a tool
I haven't played with,

131
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:46,830
my friend.

132
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:13,940
okay, the fbi agent, he was shot
at a business hotel.

133
00:09:13,975 --> 00:09:15,510
But you were so high,
you don't even remember, do you?

134
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:18,124
No, no, no. No. I never blacked out.
Never.

135
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,933
Bullshit,
you fucking junkiehohore.

136
00:09:20,968 --> 00:09:22,975
Do you remember shooting at...

137
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,976
Quinn.
You shouldn't be here, morgan.

138
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:28,978
Watching this is only gonna fuck you up.
I'm already fucked up.

139
00:09:29,013 --> 00:09:32,011
Look, nikki's going away for a long time.
She confessed to the vacation murders

140
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:34,372
and to killing johnny rose.
But not to lundy.

141
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,898
The whole department knows she's lying,
but we got nothing.

142
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:40,739
No evidence, no eyewitnesses,
so it is what it is.

143
00:09:48,573 --> 00:09:49,639
Fuck.

144
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:50,858
Fuck.

145
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:57,109
I came at nikki wald
from every which way,

146
00:09:57,144 --> 00:09:58,964
but she's still
holding out on us.

147
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,932
Brass wants her transferred
to county.

148
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,861
So it's out of our hands.
Shit.

149
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:07,448
I didn't want to leave homicide
with deb and lundy unsolved.

150
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,648
That's out of our hands too.

151
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,402
I haven't told anyone yet
about me transferring.

152
00:10:13,574 --> 00:10:15,555
There's no need
until it's official.

153
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,562
I haven't even turned
in the paperwork.

154
00:10:17,597 --> 00:10:18,717
Is that it?

155
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:21,018
No, that's homicide.

156
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:22,819
Just come in today?

157
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:24,753
This morning.

158
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,380
Didn't make sense to call you in
on something new.

159
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:35,724
Bludgeoning. Nasty.

160
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,904
You got any leads?

161
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:44,252
Hey, if I'd known
you'd be transferred...

162
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:45,981
Maria, don't.

163
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:50,164
Telling matthews about us
was the right thing to do.

164
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,311
Working fraud
will be good for me.

165
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:55,131
15% pay bump, promotion to lieutenant,
better hours,

166
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,810
and chances are
i'm not gonna be getting shot at

167
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:00,299
sitting behind a desk
all day.

168
00:11:00,334 --> 00:11:02,901
You hate
sitting behind a desk.

169
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,559
But I love being with you.

170
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,897
I'm perfectly comfortable
with bodily fluids:

171
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:26,047
blood, snot, tears.

172
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,965
But the emotions
that go along with them,

173
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:31,403
not so much.

174
00:11:32,015 --> 00:11:33,031
Dexter,

175
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:35,778
are you hearing
what rita is saying?

176
00:11:39,817 --> 00:11:41,025
She's upset.

177
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:47,379
About the apartment.

178
00:11:48,312 --> 00:11:51,187
The apartment isn't really
the issue right now.

179
00:11:51,222 --> 00:11:52,290
It's not?

180
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:54,940
You see?

181
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,976
It's like
he doesn't even listen.

182
00:11:57,011 --> 00:12:00,414
He's always in his head, and when 
he does talk to me, it's all lies,

183
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:01,997
all the time.
Not...

184
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,750
All the time.

185
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,383
I thought we were past this.
You know, with the drugs and lila.

186
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:10,547
Who's lila?

187
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:13,044
My sponsor.
The homicidal bitch he slept with.

188
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:14,094
Okay.

189
00:12:14,438 --> 00:12:15,557
Now

190
00:12:15,742 --> 00:12:17,075
we're married.

191
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,719
You know, we have
a child together.

192
00:12:21,267 --> 00:12:24,169
And you're still keeping secrets.

193
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:26,082
Rita, I can see
that you're upset.

194
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:28,963
But, as you describe it,

195
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,314
this isn't new behavior for dexter.

196
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:34,399
What do you mean?

197
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:36,904
It sounds like you
knew about him

198
00:12:37,286 --> 00:12:38,783
when you married him.

199
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:42,582
What? I hoped he would change.

200
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:48,046
When you married your ex-husband,
did you think he would change too?

201
00:12:52,943 --> 00:12:55,051
Okay. Okay, so I have
some responsibility here too.

202
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:06,562
I don't want to keep making
the same mistakes. - Me neither.

203
00:13:07,731 --> 00:13:10,525
We'll work it out.
We always work it out.

204
00:13:11,017 --> 00:13:13,243
I need a partner,
dexter.

205
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:15,795
Someone I can trust.

206
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,449
Unless you can be
completely honest with me...

207
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:22,846
I don't want to do this
anymore.

208
00:13:31,214 --> 00:13:34,688
I'm doing everything I can
to save my family,

209
00:13:34,723 --> 00:13:36,573
and I'm still failing.

210
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,967
Rita's picturing her life
without me,

211
00:13:39,002 --> 00:13:40,037
and I

212
00:13:40,983 --> 00:13:43,359
can't picture mine
without her...

213
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:44,854
Or the kids.

214
00:13:46,106 --> 00:13:47,292
Harrison.

215
00:13:47,824 --> 00:13:49,451
Is that the hammer?

216
00:13:49,984 --> 00:13:51,457
The depth is too shallow.

217
00:13:51,492 --> 00:13:53,562
Murder weapon was heavier.

218
00:13:53,597 --> 00:13:55,548
Well, narrow it down, dex.
We need a model number.

219
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:58,297
Maybe we can track it
to a hardware store or an internet site.

220
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,470
I'll try this 22-ouncer.

221
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:05,912
What's going on?

222
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,256
Dna.

223
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,079
Whose dna? The victim's?

224
00:14:13,114 --> 00:14:15,525
The killer's?
Wait for it.

225
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:20,897
Okay, that smudge
you found at the crime scene?

226
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,420
Cremated human remains.

227
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:27,277
That fragment
was a little piece of bone.

228
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:29,971
And thanks to the wonders
of technology

229
00:14:30,006 --> 00:14:33,031
and to my own scientific prowess...You rehydrated it and?

230
00:14:33,066 --> 00:14:35,232
Dude, I told you
to wait for it.

231
00:14:35,863 --> 00:14:38,536
And I found two strains
of dna.

232
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:41,297
One from the fragment
and one

233
00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:42,720
 from saliva.

234
00:14:43,623 --> 00:14:44,623
Whose saliva?

235
00:14:44,658 --> 00:14:45,707
The killer's.

236
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,812
Come on, buddy. Try to keep up.

237
00:14:48,168 --> 00:14:51,682
How do you think he got the
ashes to stick to the wall?

238
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:54,515
We got
the killer's goddamn dna?

239
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,656
You f-in' know it.

240
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:57,809
I rock, right? 
Yeah, you do today. Run it

241
00:14:57,844 --> 00:15:00,173
through every database
you can think of.

242
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,764
Okay. We're gonna find this guy.

243
00:15:02,587 --> 00:15:06,326
No, you won't. Arthur mitchell isn't 
in any of our police databases.

244
00:15:06,361 --> 00:15:09,284
I already ran him.
He's squeaky clean.

245
00:15:09,934 --> 00:15:14,082
He hides the real him,
except from those ashes.

246
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:17,140
He can only be honest
with the dead.

247
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:25,637
Morgan.

248
00:15:25,702 --> 00:15:27,966
I need those vacation murder
files back.

249
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:31,292
Got to finish my report.
Just give me another hour. There's got to be something

250
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,593
that puts nikki at lundy's hotel.
Morgan,

251
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:34,948
we got it covered.

252
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,857
And you shouldn't be working
anyway.

253
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:38,251
You're on sick leave.

254
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:39,490
Go home.

255
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:41,478
I'll keep you posted. Okay?

256
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:53,419
One unheard message.

257
00:15:53,626 --> 00:15:57,975
Hi, I'm calling for debra morgan.
This is valerie hodges returning your call

258
00:15:58,127 --> 00:15:59,359
from a few weeks ago.

259
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:01,441
Sorry it took me so long
to call you back,

260
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,924
but when you said
you were harry morgan's daughter,

261
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,400
I wasn't sure what to do.
I figured

262
00:16:06,435 --> 00:16:09,594
I'd just call, be direct,
so if you want to know the truth..

263
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:11,665
I told you to stop working.

264
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,160
That wasn't work.

265
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,660
That was way personal.
Come on.

266
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:18,701
For you?

267
00:16:18,736 --> 00:16:21,039
Same difference.

268
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,221
She wants a partner.

269
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:39,494
One who can open up.

270
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,682
Okay, I'll share.

271
00:16:42,405 --> 00:16:43,720
About what?

272
00:16:44,762 --> 00:16:46,264
Work.

273
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:47,986
Spatter anysysis?

274
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:50,381
no. Something personal.

275
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,686
Trinity?

276
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:53,559
Too personal.

277
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:54,829
Food?

278
00:16:54,864 --> 00:16:56,915
I'm hungry. I could tell her that.

279
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,750
We're out of bread again.

280
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:00,598
I'll go 

281
00:17:01,126 --> 00:17:02,576
get some.

282
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:19,911
Arthur's kept this up
for, what, 28 years?

283
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:23,096
My family may not last 20 minutes.

284
00:17:23,636 --> 00:17:26,614
Warmth, intimacy.
He's convincing.

285
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:30,113
But why the show? I'm the
only one watching.

286
00:17:30,148 --> 00:17:31,298
Unless 

287
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:35,020
it's more than just camouflage.

288
00:17:36,462 --> 00:17:38,186
That's honest affection

289
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,927
sustained for year

290
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,194
But he's like me. How does he do it?

291
00:17:47,621 --> 00:17:49,540
I will kill him. I need to.

292
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,952
But right now I need
to save my family more.

293
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:55,893
His cycle is over.

294
00:17:55,928 --> 00:18:00,428
It'll be a while before he kills again,
so he's not an immediate threat.

295
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:03,098
And I have so much to learn.

296
00:18:04,713 --> 00:18:06,013
Arthur Mitchell.

297
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:12,137
Kyle Butler.

298
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:17,356
Four walls, one heart.
We build homes for the homeless.

299
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:21,660
We meet at my house, then head to the site
together. My address is right on the flyer.

300
00:18:21,695 --> 00:18:22,995
Thanks. I've been...

301
00:18:23,672 --> 00:18:25,718
looking for a way to get more involved.

302
00:18:25,753 --> 00:18:28,753
What brings you to
srered fellowship, Kyle?

303
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:32,999
Um...

304
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:35,186
Looking for something. Answers.

305
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:41,513
My wife and I, we separated.

306
00:18:41,903 --> 00:18:43,803
She kicked me out 

307
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,157
and took the kids.

308
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:50,078
I didn't know where else to go.

309
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:54,507
You came to the right place, son.

310
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,868
I just got an email from my editor.

311
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:10,901
Yeah? Anything good?

312
00:19:10,936 --> 00:19:13,686
Well, he wants more from
me on the vacation murders.

313
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:17,008
I'm

314
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,857
not asking for any inside scoop.

315
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,942
Yeah, 'cause we know how well
that worked out last time.

316
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:25,999
What?

317
00:19:26,658 --> 00:19:28,508
If you could just help me 

318
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:31,433
get an interview with Debra Morgan...

319
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:34,496
- You got to be kidding me.
- It'd be a hero piece 

320
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,864
- about the shooting.
- No. No way.

321
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:38,236
She's your partner.

322
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:42,119
Yeah. Add to that the fact that her brother
has a bug up his ass about me.

323
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:47,381
Let's just say I'd
rather you left it alone.

324
00:19:48,653 --> 00:19:53,095
Since when did that ever stop me
from getting what I want?

325
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:58,645
Oh, hold on. It might be the station.

326
00:20:01,255 --> 00:20:03,755
- Quinn.
- Look out your window.

327
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,459
Be back in a sec, okay?

328
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,089
Hey.

329
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:22,087
I want to be an eyewitness
for the shooting.

330
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,280
I thought you said you
didn't see anything.

331
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:27,768
I was in shock.

332
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,585
My memory was fuzzy.

333
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:32,165
Now it's clear.

334
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:36,160
There's no doubt in my mind
that Nikki shot me and Frank.

335
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:37,435
Mine either.

336
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,542
Are you talking about
going on the record?

337
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:42,827
And what happens later if you
decide you're still confused?

338
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:45,068
I won't.

339
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,103
You sure?

340
00:20:46,947 --> 00:20:50,497
Because if this comes back to bite
you in the ass, you're screwed.

341
00:20:55,378 --> 00:21:00,128
My dad used to say a good cop
does whatever it takes to close a case.

342
00:21:00,457 --> 00:21:02,407
Other cops. Not you.

343
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:05,403
Just think about it, okay?

344
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:09,671
I'd hate to have you make a decision
when your head's not on straight.

345
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,097
They're on a wild goose chase.

346
00:21:24,433 --> 00:21:27,567
No way they'll find a
match to Trinity's dna.

347
00:21:27,602 --> 00:21:29,252
He's too well-hidden.

348
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,183
I could be helping,

349
00:21:33,218 --> 00:21:35,468
finding the hammer he used.

350
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:38,050
Or I could help someone in need...

351
00:21:38,085 --> 00:21:39,085
Me.

352
00:21:49,361 --> 00:21:51,913
Preliminary spatter report
on the bludgeoning.

353
00:21:51,948 --> 00:21:53,919
We land on the specific hammer
for the murder weapon?

354
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:55,454
Narrowing it down.
I'll keep you posted.

355
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:59,001
I'm actually heading out now
to do some field research.

356
00:21:59,036 --> 00:22:01,464
Well, how about you, Vince?
You got anything for me on that dna?

357
00:22:01,499 --> 00:22:04,091
No matches in the criminal database.

358
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,126
Duh.

359
00:22:05,582 --> 00:22:06,582
Wait.

360
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:09,570
You're gonna miss the big reveal.

361
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:14,598
Because I'm me, and I happen
to think outside the box,

362
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,400
and I happen to be an awesome forensic tech... - Masuka.

363
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:20,135
I ran the human remains
against the saliva.

364
00:22:20,344 --> 00:22:22,244
And guess what I found?

365
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,466
Matching mitochondrial dna.

366
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:25,853
English, por favor.

367
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,858
The killer is related
to the human remains.

368
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:31,055
Same family.

369
00:22:32,202 --> 00:22:34,792
He keeps his family with him
all the time.

370
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:37,241
Well, are they
gonna go visit him in prison?

371
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:39,184
'cause this is going
to get him caught.

372
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:41,820
Maybe he wants to get caught.
Or he's sending a message.

373
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:44,855
Or he's trying to leave
some kind of a legacy.

374
00:22:45,256 --> 00:22:46,256
Hey.

375
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:48,441
 How come you're
not working this case?

376
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:51,558
I'm busy.

377
00:22:52,911 --> 00:22:54,661
Got a report
to finish.

378
00:22:56,618 --> 00:23:00,418
His family keeps him safe,
but these ashes leave him exposed.

379
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:03,189
Maybe this is
how I get to the truth.

380
00:23:06,223 --> 00:23:07,673
The murder weapon.

381
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:11,495
He's using it out in the open
for all the world to see.

382
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,480
Not something I would do.

383
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:17,088
But arthur has tools
that I don't.

384
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
Hey.

385
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,551
Glad to see
you made it.

386
00:23:25,586 --> 00:23:26,686
Kyle Butler.

387
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:29,806
- You remember my name.
- Oh, I'm like an elephant.

388
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,241
I never forget.

389
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,497
You didn't have any tools
to bring?

390
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:35,474
- Lost 'em in the move.
- Well, here.

391
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:37,159
Take my hammer.

392
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,670
Take good care of her,
though.

393
00:23:42,145 --> 00:23:43,848
We've be t through a lot
together.

394
00:23:43,883 --> 00:23:44,979
So I saw.

395
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,287
Very kind of you, Arthur.

396
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,272
Well, generosity of spirit,
kyle.

397
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,695
- It's the reason we're all here
- Not all of us.

398
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,286
Come on, I'll get you set up.

399
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,321
Okay.

400
00:23:56,076 --> 00:23:59,945
Grant 24-ounce steel framing
hammer, model number 514.

401
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,606
Laguerta will be pleased.

402
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,241
Just bang in these three.

403
00:24:03,598 --> 00:24:05,148
They're already marked.

404
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,013
But I have
more important questions.

405
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:14,151
So, arthur, you and your family 
been doing this a long time?

406
00:24:14,186 --> 00:24:19,086
Oh, yeah, for years. I took sally 
on a build for our very first date.

407
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:25,627
And the kids have been coming
ever since they could hold a hammer.

408
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,418
You all seem

409
00:24:28,453 --> 00:24:29,767
really close. Happy.

410
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:30,802
Yeah.

411
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:31,841
We are.

412
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,293
Envious.

413
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,008
You're arthur's son,
right?

414
00:24:58,043 --> 00:24:59,363
I'm kyle

415
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:00,406
Oh, Jonah.

416
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:02,156
Nice to meet you.

417
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,191
Seems polite. Well adjusted.

418
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
How's it going?

419
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:06,717
It's hot.

420
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:08,894
It's nice that you're here,
though

421
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:11,404
There's got to be other ways
you'd rather spend your afternoon.

422
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:16,060
Well, no, it's okay. You know, 
mom and dad are big on the family time.

423
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:19,841
That's nice. For too many kids,
family time means fighting time.

424
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:21,013
Not mine.

425
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,015
Never?
Not much to fight about, really.

426
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,003
My parents are cool.

427
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,701
Yeah, your dad seems
like a special guy.

428
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,186
He is. I-

429
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:32,898
I really lucked out.

430
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:34,736
How so?

431
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:37,271
A lot of ways. Like, you see that?

432
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:42,179
It's been my dad's baby for years.
A few days ago, he hands me the keys..

433
00:25:42,214 --> 00:25:45,614
Generosity of spirit.
Foundation of love, man.

434
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:47,678
Best dad ever.

435
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,618
Best dad ever.

436
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:56,799
Oh, I got to get back to work.
Dad's not a big fan of idle hands.

437
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:09,075
Hey, nikki.

438
00:26:11,956 --> 00:26:13,331
You remember me?

439
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,240
Yeah. That cop.
Detective.

440
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:20,306
The one you shot.

441
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:21,341
Jesus christ.

442
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:23,512
Here we go again.

443
00:26:25,957 --> 00:26:28,057
I told your boss everything
already.

444
00:26:28,668 --> 00:26:30,218
Now you're gonna tell me.

445
00:26:32,233 --> 00:26:34,683
Only this time
you're gonna tell the truth.

446
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:36,831
I told you. I've been telling the truth
the whole time.

447
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:39,726
Well, then come here
and tell it to my face..

448
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:41,983
This is so fucking stupid.

449
00:26:47,568 --> 00:26:50,818
A bit closer
so I can see your eyes.

450
00:26:58,592 --> 00:27:00,542
The night
that you got shot,

451
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:03,602
I was in a hotel room
with johnny.

452
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:06,541
Bullshit. We did meth,

453
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:08,925
we watched porn, we fucked.

454
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,011
I mean, we were watching
cartoons all night.

455
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,344
What do you want? What do you want?
You fucking liar.

456
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:17,055
No matter how many times
you ask me, it's not going to change.

457
00:27:17,855 --> 00:27:21,310
I didn't shoot you, okay?
I didn't kill that old man.

458
00:27:21,663 --> 00:27:23,474
Ow! Fuck! Jesus christ!

459
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:30,456
I'm gonna say I saw you.

460
00:27:31,348 --> 00:27:33,648
People get mugged every day.

461
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:36,366
Maybe somebody else
wanted you dead.

462
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,254
Huh? Like who? Like who?

463
00:27:38,464 --> 00:27:41,831
Oh, fuck. You're a fucking cop
for christ's sakes.

464
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:43,723
You piss people off
for a living.

465
00:27:43,758 --> 00:27:45,658
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

466
00:27:46,001 --> 00:27:47,543
Fucking hurting me.

467
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:49,329


468
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,885
You think that hurts?

469
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,674
Try watching the man you love
die right in front of you with nothing you can do.

470
00:28:00,317 --> 00:28:01,417
Oh, right.

471
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,181
You shot your boyfriend.

472
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:09,675
You shot your boyfriend.

473
00:28:12,097 --> 00:28:14,687
I killed johnny. I know. I killed...

474
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,310
I do miss johnny. I know.

475
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:27,586
If you...If you say
that you saw me kill frank lundy,

476
00:28:28,017 --> 00:28:29,311
then you're the liar.

477
00:28:29,346 --> 00:28:31,214
You are the liar!

478
00:28:39,688 --> 00:28:42,317
I'd like to be transferred
out of homicide.

479
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:44,668
Always looking for the next best thing,
hey, lieutenant?

480
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,653
Aren't we all?
Yeah.

481
00:28:47,318 --> 00:28:49,418
I could use a change of scenery.

482
00:28:49,453 --> 00:28:50,861
I'm thinking 

483
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:52,249
press liaison.

484
00:28:52,284 --> 00:28:55,289
Well, P.R. could certainly
use your political skills.

485
00:28:55,324 --> 00:28:58,524
And Sergeant Batista
could stay in homicide.

486
00:28:59,711 --> 00:29:01,811
Well, let me think about it.

487
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:05,019
We both know you're not easily replaced.

488
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:09,753
That didn't seem to be a problem before.

489
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:12,038
I'll let you know what I decide.

490
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:17,471
Hello.

491
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:21,254
Tell me that's the last one of it.
The last bag from your apartment.

492
00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:24,277
It's not from my apartment.
But, Rita, wait, wait.

493
00:29:24,312 --> 00:29:26,115
Surprise for you, for all of you.

494
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,504
No way. A Nintendo DS?

495
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,218
I know it's not an iPod...

496
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:32,972
A mini dvd player? This is awesome.

497
00:29:36,406 --> 00:29:37,619
For Harrison.

498
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:45,925
And for my lovely wife.

499
00:29:49,337 --> 00:29:50,693
A bread maker?

500
00:29:50,728 --> 00:29:52,378
We're always running out of bread.

501
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:55,905
We're always running out of milk.
Did you get me a cow too?

502
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,376
- Thank you so much!
- This is so awesome.

503
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,463
- Thank you, Dexter.
- You're welcome.

504
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:13,073
What's the matter? You don't like your gift?

505
00:30:13,108 --> 00:30:14,908
I appreciate you trying.

506
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,042
I really do.

507
00:30:16,996 --> 00:30:19,146
But we don't need gifts.

508
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:21,111
We need you.

509
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,280
Need me to do what?

510
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,067
Just talk to me.

511
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,199
I'm, uh...

512
00:30:39,552 --> 00:30:41,769
People just do this?

513
00:30:41,804 --> 00:30:43,419
Say what they're thinking?

514
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:45,670
Out loud?

515
00:30:49,924 --> 00:30:53,831
- How hard can it be?
- I'm trying. I'm trying.

516
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,107
You know what? You can try harder in therapy.

517
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:02,226
I'm moving up our next session.

518
00:31:10,656 --> 00:31:11,656
Wow.

519
00:31:12,394 --> 00:31:13,697
What's the occasion?

520
00:31:13,732 --> 00:31:15,082
I have good news.

521
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:16,704
You want to guess?

522
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:17,843
Um

523
00:31:18,629 --> 00:31:20,943
you're naked under there,

524
00:31:22,263 --> 00:31:24,297
and I get to see guess what
else you get to do?

525
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:27,769
Okay, now I'm really
having impure thoughts.

526
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:30,046
You get to stay in homicide.

527
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:35,272
Really?

528
00:31:35,664 --> 00:31:36,957
Wow. How did you...

529
00:31:36,992 --> 00:31:39,777
I had a little talk with the deputy chief,

530
00:31:39,812 --> 00:31:42,413
and I told him homicide
couldn't afford to lose you.

531
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:43,663
And neither could I.

532
00:31:45,217 --> 00:31:46,224
You...

533
00:31:47,376 --> 00:31:48,379
are...

534
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:50,121
amazing.

535
00:31:53,334 --> 00:31:56,034
So he's okay with both of us staying?

536
00:31:57,069 --> 00:31:59,503
Well, we can talk about logistics 

537
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,354
later. Right?

538
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,716
You told him you'd leave instead.

539
00:32:08,751 --> 00:32:10,252
Angel.

540
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:12,572
It just makes more sense.

541
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:14,268
You're full of it.

542
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:16,505
You're sweet,

543
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,390
and you're beautiful, but you're full of it,
and I can't let you do that.

544
00:32:21,462 --> 00:32:22,687
Well,

545
00:32:22,722 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm not
gonna let you leave homicide.

546
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:28,090
You love it.

547
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,974
And if you leave,
you won't be you.

548
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:32,759
At least not the you
that I want to be with.

549
00:32:33,677 --> 00:32:35,096
What do we do?

550
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:40,953
I don't know.

551
00:32:48,206 --> 00:32:51,130
how are we supposed to decide
how are we supposed to decide

552
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,440
Our jobs or each other?

553
00:33:01,673 --> 00:33:03,045
Shit.

554
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:07,385
Shit is right.

555
00:33:13,082 --> 00:33:15,473
This is arthur mitchell

556
00:33:15,508 --> 00:33:17,160
at his core.

557
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:20,513
Is there something in his dna
that lets him keep a family?

558
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:22,972
ome magic gene I'm missing?

559
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,364
Looking for something?

560
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:28,814
You're surfing on my turf,
blood guy.

561
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:29,852
Just curious.

562
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:33,819
Then you'll be interested
to know that the mitochondrial DNA...

563
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:35,961
Female.

564
00:33:36,437 --> 00:33:39,502
So mother, daughter,
sister..

565
00:33:39,537 --> 00:33:41,995
Could even be his granny
he smudged on that wall.

566
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,824
Probably whacks off
with her ashes.

567
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:46,652
Why would he do that?

568
00:33:47,635 --> 00:33:48,884
Why wouldn't he?

569
00:33:49,054 --> 00:33:50,945
Because she's important
to him

570
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,867
Dude. Joke.

571
00:33:53,922 --> 00:33:56,186
His history with her
shapes who he is.

572
00:33:56,221 --> 00:34:01,171
Like how my mother breast-fed me till I was six 
and now no one will ever match up.

573
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:06,887
Lieutenant.

574
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:11,835
It's a grant 24-ounce
steel framing hammer.

575
00:34:12,123 --> 00:34:14,824
- Sorry?
- It's the murder weapon in the bludgeoning case.

576
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:17,338
I did
some independent research

577
00:34:17,373 --> 00:34:19,711
- Updated my report.
- Right. Right.

578
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:21,485
- Thanks.
- Actually, I'm done 

579
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,056
with my work for the day.

580
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:26,741
If it's okay with you, I have some 
personal stuff to take care of.

581
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:30,481
Take care of the personal stuff,
dexter.

582
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:31,999
Take very...

583
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,860
Good care.

584
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:38,409
Sure as hell trying to.

585
00:34:47,595 --> 00:34:50,345
You know those things
never go bad.

586
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:55,123
Well, yeah, tell me about it.
I've had these since I was a rookie.

587
00:34:55,706 --> 00:34:56,925
So...

588
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,738
I never heard back from you
about being an eyewitness.

589
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:01,873
That mean
you changed your mind?

590
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:03,474
Yeah.

591
00:35:04,763 --> 00:35:07,575
Just 'cause nikki's a piece of shit
and my dad was a lying sack

592
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,110
Doesn't mean I have to be.

593
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,838
Thanks for talking some sense
into me.

594
00:35:13,873 --> 00:35:15,973
Just looking out
for my partner.

595
00:35:16,593 --> 00:35:18,343
What's all this?

596
00:35:19,708 --> 00:35:23,008
I'm thinking maybe nikki wald
was telling the truth.

597
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,812
Since when?

598
00:35:25,302 --> 00:35:26,889
Since I talked
to her myself.

599
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,583
Wait, you what?

600
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:33,211
I've been going over everything you 

collected from Lundy's hotel and...

601
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:35,296
All his personal effects.

602
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,990
Here's the thing.

603
00:35:38,056 --> 00:35:39,664
Some of it's missing.

604
00:35:39,966 --> 00:35:42,165
No way. It was all logged in.
By me.

605
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,336
Lundy had research books
on that serial killer he was hunting.

606
00:35:45,371 --> 00:35:46,971
And audio tapes.

607
00:35:47,203 --> 00:35:49,353
I saw them in his room.

608
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:52,134
You still wrapped up
in that, deb?

609
00:35:52,169 --> 00:35:53,814
I don't mean
to speak ill,

610
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:56,349
but the guy was chasing
a ghost.

611
00:35:57,423 --> 00:36:00,873
I think that ghost
stole his books.

612
00:36:01,511 --> 00:36:03,077
You got to stop.

613
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:04,437
You're making yourself crazy.

614
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:06,860
I'm telling you,
someone took lundy's stuff.

615
00:36:06,895 --> 00:36:08,467
And I'm telling you

616
00:36:08,502 --> 00:36:10,913
you got to let this go.

617
00:36:10,948 --> 00:36:12,484
Look, I'm sure you're tired.

618
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:15,119
- Why don't you go home...
- And what?

619
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,674
Paint my fucking nails?

620
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,149
I'm kind of sick
of hearing it, Quinn.

621
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:27,269
Then I guess I won't say it anymore.

622
00:36:34,017 --> 00:36:36,836
I am no longer seeing
Lieutenant Laguerta.

623
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,267
I mean, I see her  

624
00:36:39,302 --> 00:36:40,579
every day,

625
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:42,031
but...

626
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,466
We broke up.

627
00:36:44,021 --> 00:36:46,473
- Officially.
- And permantltly.

628
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:48,914
Are you sure?

629
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:53,300
Because, frankly, I'm getting a
little sick of the back and forth.

630
00:36:53,335 --> 00:36:54,929
I apologize for the inconvenience.

631
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:57,042
Well, it's middle school
bullshit, Lieutenant.

632
00:36:57,077 --> 00:36:59,377
I really don't want to have
this conversation again.

633
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:00,573
You won't have to.

634
00:37:00,608 --> 00:37:03,032
We've both signed affidavits to make it official.

635
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:06,542
Our relationship didn't interfere
with any ongoing investigations,

636
00:37:06,577 --> 00:37:09,101
and the department will not
be held liable for any fallout.

637
00:37:09,136 --> 00:37:11,113
Well, that's something at least.

638
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:13,806
For the record, neither one
of us was sexually harassed.

639
00:37:13,841 --> 00:37:14,967
Yeah,

640
00:37:15,002 --> 00:37:17,137
all advances were very welcomed.

641
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:20,931
And there was not nor will there
be  a hostile work environment.

642
00:37:20,966 --> 00:37:22,732
So it's done.

643
00:37:23,301 --> 00:37:25,559
We're both staying in homicide.

644
00:37:27,924 --> 00:37:29,724
Let me be clear.

645
00:37:30,294 --> 00:37:33,294
The paperwork you're filing is serious.

646
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:38,587
If I find out this is bullshit,
there will be consequences.

647
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,150
Severe, 

648
00:37:40,185 --> 00:37:42,530
career-ending consequences.

649
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,321
Don't, angel.

650
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:50,910
It's over.

651
00:37:50,945 --> 00:37:51,945
Right.

652
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:53,268


653
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:07,490
Sorry.

654
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:09,105
I should get back to work.

655
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,234
This is the last of it. My
dark passenger's... stuff 

656
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:22,631
and the reason I can't let
go of my apartment.

657
00:38:22,666 --> 00:38:25,766
If I don't figure out how to hide this,

658
00:38:25,857 --> 00:38:27,999
I'm gonna lose my family.

659
00:38:28,793 --> 00:38:32,385
Trinity has the answer.
He's kept his family close.

660
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,288
Even after death.

661
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:48,161
Who did you lose, Arthur?

662
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:08,596
1959.

663
00:39:09,552 --> 00:39:10,828
16.

664
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:12,349
Vera Mitchell.

665
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,468
Sister of Arthur Mitchell.

666
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,841
Found dead in a...

667
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,435
bathtub.

668
00:39:22,262 --> 00:39:24,339
Marsha Mitchell.

669
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:25,719
1961. 

670
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:28,137
40.

671
00:39:28,172 --> 00:39:31,316
Jumped to her death off
the Collins Canal Bridge.

672
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,563
Henry Mitchell.

673
00:39:36,755 --> 00:39:37,755
1964. 

674
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:39,288
45.

675
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:43,007
Died in an alley of a fatal head wound.

676
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,505
Sister, mother, father.

677
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,362
He's recreating their deaths.

678
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:58,125
Decade after decade.

679
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,410
Cycles of three.

680
00:40:04,683 --> 00:40:07,554
I watched my mother
get sawed into pieces.

681
00:40:07,589 --> 00:40:09,589
Now I cut people up.

682
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,940
We both have skeletons,

683
00:40:14,975 --> 00:40:18,925
which means we both get a
closet to keep them in.

684
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:23,647
Arthur has a closet.

685
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:28,248
I know almost everything
about you, Arthur,

686
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:30,969
except where you hide.

687
00:40:31,023 --> 00:40:33,583
Ready or not, here I come.

688
00:41:18,553 --> 00:41:20,595
Oh, my goodness.
Kyle, you all right?

689
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,138
Yeah, cut myself at the build.

690
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:25,752
I didn't think it was a big deal,
but it won't stop bleeding.

691
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:26,803
Here.

692
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:31,551
Right out in the open.

693
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:33,986
There must be more he's hiding inside.

694
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,050
Come on in. We got a first
aid kit in the house.

695
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:42,254
Sorry.

696
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:44,521
No boots in the house.

697
00:41:45,816 --> 00:41:47,103
Here, I'll get the kit.

698
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,038
You make yourself at home.

699
00:41:49,693 --> 00:41:51,582
Thanks. I will.

700
00:42:00,213 --> 00:42:02,391
Tacky, but normal.

701
00:42:02,426 --> 00:42:05,076
His secrets must be under lock and key.

702
00:42:14,919 --> 00:42:17,619
Not the dirty laundry I'm looking for.

703
00:42:25,807 --> 00:42:26,807
Shit.

704
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:30,998
Arthur has a place to put his lamp.

705
00:42:39,399 --> 00:42:42,028
The dates and locations
from Lundy's books.

706
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:45,069
Arthur's been using four walls builds
around the country as a cover to kill.

707
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:47,154
and these are his trophies.

708
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:50,261
And these are his trophies.

709
00:42:51,483 --> 00:42:55,060
Hanging right up here on the wall
just like his hammer in the garage.

710
00:42:56,621 --> 00:42:58,521
His blood slides.

711
00:42:59,186 --> 00:43:02,172
He doesn't need a secret apartment.
He's hiding in plain sight,

712
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,831
right in the center of his family.

713
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,632
I'm the one who's
lurking in the shadows.

714
00:43:10,328 --> 00:43:14,022
And here she is, Arthur's
own dark passenger...

715
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,399
His sister Vera.

716
00:43:21,374 --> 00:43:24,692
The tank is low, but then, she's
been on the road for 30 years.

717
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:25,742
Kyle!

718
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:29,242
Hiding in plain sight is one thing,
but this is your weak spot.

719
00:43:29,277 --> 00:43:31,427
What happens when it's exposed?

720
00:43:33,384 --> 00:43:36,284
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

721
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:39,950
Okay.

722
00:43:40,364 --> 00:43:42,564
Let's have a look at that hand...

723
00:44:01,281 --> 00:44:02,487
Don't 

724
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:03,873
touch...

725
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,875
my sister.

726
00:44:07,387 --> 00:44:09,387
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

727
00:44:10,786 --> 00:44:12,066
I can't breathe.

728
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:20,167
I'm sorry.

729
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:21,305
Forgive me.

730
00:44:24,114 --> 00:44:28,102
- I'm so sorry.
- Jesus, Arthur, what the hell was that?

731
00:44:28,137 --> 00:44:29,337
It's just...

732
00:44:30,988 --> 00:44:32,636
my sister...

733
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:37,509
she died when I was young.

734
00:44:39,416 --> 00:44:41,714
It was very painful for me.

735
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,997
I understand.

736
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,693
I've lost people too.

737
00:44:52,161 --> 00:44:53,787
Yeah. Have a seat.

738
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:08,888
If the ashes bother you so much,

739
00:45:09,549 --> 00:45:11,199
why do you keep them out?

740
00:45:11,781 --> 00:45:13,943
Because she's a part of me, Kyle.

741
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:17,360
Helped make me who I am.

742
00:45:21,895 --> 00:45:24,245
But if your family ever saw you

743
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:27,113
- so upset...
- They'd understand.

744
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,599
This is my home.

745
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,135
I can be myself here.

746
00:45:34,564 --> 00:45:37,103
You make it sound easy.

747
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:39,597
I used 

748
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:43,109
to push people away because of my past.

749
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:46,544
Even los a a relationship over it.

750
00:45:47,193 --> 00:45:48,264
Like you.

751
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:53,569
- But you changed.
- Yeah, I met Sally, had my kids,

752
00:45:54,223 --> 00:45:56,139
and I realized the only way

753
00:45:56,174 --> 00:45:57,937
it was 

754
00:45:58,742 --> 00:46:02,509
gonna work is if I jumped in with both feet.

755
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:08,874
Jump in with both feet.

756
00:46:12,046 --> 00:46:13,243
And that...

757
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:15,128
saved your family?

758
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,040
Kyle, 

759
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:22,549
my family saved me.

760
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:32,781
Wait.

761
00:46:33,726 --> 00:46:35,413
I want to give you something.

762
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:47,289
For the next build.

763
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:51,650
I thought you should
have your own tools.

764
00:46:53,153 --> 00:46:54,645
It's the least I can do.

765
00:46:54,837 --> 00:46:55,837
Thanks.

766
00:46:55,872 --> 00:46:58,122
For giving me your murder weapon.

767
00:46:59,392 --> 00:47:01,653
See you at the next build then.

768
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:03,338
Wouldn't miss it.

769
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:05,966
I want to be a part of this family.

770
00:47:08,553 --> 00:47:10,759
And I know I need to
jump in with both feet.

771
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:12,059
I'm glad, but...

772
00:47:12,094 --> 00:47:14,344
I want to let you in.

773
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,486
Honestly, I don't know...

774
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:24,343
How.

775
00:47:29,790 --> 00:47:31,290
I never learned.

776
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:35,697
No, of course you didn't.

777
00:47:37,565 --> 00:47:38,565
God, I...

778
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:41,188
I mean, with your mother and...

779
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:43,726
- What about his mother?
- She was murdered 

780
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:46,411
- right in front of him.
- Wow, that's...

781
00:47:47,138 --> 00:47:49,388
that's quite a history.

782
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:54,731
And it shaped who I am.

783
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:57,318
But...

784
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:59,531
I want to change.

785
00:48:00,451 --> 00:48:02,301
Let me ask you a question, Dexter.

786
00:48:02,336 --> 00:48:04,086
And I'd like you to be honest.

787
00:48:05,414 --> 00:48:06,514
I'll try.

788
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:11,058
Would you say that you're afraid
to let Rita get close to you?

789
00:48:12,779 --> 00:48:14,179
- Yes.
- Why?

790
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,670
Because of my past.

791
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:22,648
Are you afraid she'll abandon you?

792
00:48:22,683 --> 00:48:23,683
Yes.

793
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,330
But Rita is not your mother.

794
00:48:28,296 --> 00:48:30,096
No, definitely not, but if she...

795
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:31,134
ever sees...

796
00:48:32,794 --> 00:48:35,394
me for who I really am...

797
00:48:36,963 --> 00:48:38,752
Then what?

798
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:40,387
You think I would leave?

799
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:42,741
Yes, absolutely.

800
00:48:44,778 --> 00:48:47,578
Well, then you've got
something to learn about me.

801
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:51,867
I married you because I want
to get to know the real you.

802
00:48:53,259 --> 00:48:55,659
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

803
00:48:56,255 --> 00:48:57,255
Dexter.

804
00:48:58,495 --> 00:49:00,145
Tell Rita the truth.

805
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:03,001
Why did you keep your apartment?

806
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:10,073
Because...

807
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:13,458
I need 

808
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:15,472
space...

809
00:49:18,253 --> 00:49:19,403
to keep

810
00:49:20,337 --> 00:49:21,437
my stuff.

811
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:26,167
We have a house. There's plenty of room.

812
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:28,404
I think what Dexter is trying to say

813
00:49:28,439 --> 00:49:30,812
is that he needs space for himself

814
00:49:30,847 --> 00:49:32,218
- in the marriage.
- Okay,

815
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:33,851
yeah, but

816
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:35,831
I really do need a place

817
00:49:35,866 --> 00:49:37,175
to put my stuff.

818
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,210
Of course.

819
00:49:39,076 --> 00:49:40,797
Of course. I'll... 

820
00:49:40,832 --> 00:49:42,482
I'll give you space.

821
00:49:43,687 --> 00:49:44,687
You will?

822
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:46,867
Yes.

823
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:51,954
See what happens when you're honest?

824
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,939
You get what you need.

825
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:17,910
I know you're here.

826
00:50:24,947 --> 00:50:26,297
You always catch me.

827
00:50:36,152 --> 00:50:38,152
Mind if I join you?

828
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,554
Look how beautiful you are.

829
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:11,786
I'll never get tired of hearing that.

830
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:39,242
You look better.

831
00:51:39,277 --> 00:51:40,727
I feel better.

832
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,444
You know why?

833
00:51:44,398 --> 00:51:47,022
Nikki Wald didn't kill Lundy.

834
00:51:48,301 --> 00:51:51,052
- How do you know?
- 'Cause somebody stole
Lundy's Trinity research.

835
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:53,980
- Me.
- And there's only one person
who'd have a reason to do that.

836
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:55,693
Me?

837
00:51:56,068 --> 00:51:57,068
Trinity.

838
00:51:58,012 --> 00:52:01,662
- You're kidding.
- He must have realized
Lundy was getting close.

839
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,333
Think about it. That newspaper article.

840
00:52:04,368 --> 00:52:07,768
Maybe he even saw Lundy staking
out that office building.

841
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:10,181
- I guess.
- He killed Lundy, 

842
00:52:10,216 --> 00:52:13,810
he shot me, he stole Lundy's
books to cover his ass.

843
00:52:13,845 --> 00:52:16,530
Not exactly, but you were on a
roll there for a while.

844
00:52:16,565 --> 00:52:18,289
Do you know how awesome this is?

845
00:52:18,324 --> 00:52:21,078
It means that cocksucker is still
out there, and now I don't have

846
00:52:21,113 --> 00:52:22,556
to sit around and wait for
someone else to take care of it.

847
00:52:22,591 --> 00:52:24,091
I can get him.

848
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:27,612
Great, now I have got to worry
about you getting on Trinity's radar.

849
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:29,443
Have you told laguerta your theory?

850
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:30,528
Not yet.

851
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,800
I need to make sure I have a case first.
I don't want to step on my dick.

852
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:35,485
No, definitely not.

853
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:38,089
I got to get to the station.

854
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:39,759
Lots of work to do.

855
00:52:39,794 --> 00:52:41,294
By the way...

856
00:52:41,822 --> 00:52:44,222
I think I know who dad was fucking.

857
00:52:45,315 --> 00:52:46,315
What?

858
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:47,680
Wait, who?

859
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:52,781
I'll tell you when I know more. I don't want to step on my dick with that either.

860
00:53:00,458 --> 00:53:01,508
So you ready?

861
00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:10,882
I was born of primordial ooze.

862
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:14,167
I crawled out of my own mother's blood.

863
00:53:15,746 --> 00:53:18,722
I hid among the humans,
hoping not to be seen.

864
00:53:18,757 --> 00:53:21,323
But somewhere along
the way, I grew legs,

865
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:23,058
stood upright.

866
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,178
Would you give me a hand?

867
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:29,213
Absolutely.

868
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,420
So what do you think?
Is it too stuffy?

869
00:53:42,524 --> 00:53:43,524
Nope.

870
00:53:52,198 --> 00:53:53,298
It's perfect.

871
00:53:54,426 --> 00:53:55,452
Thank you.

872
00:53:55,487 --> 00:53:56,997
I became a husband,

873
00:53:57,032 --> 00:53:58,032
a father.

874
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:02,015
I had to evolve. It was
the only way to survive.

875
00:54:03,249 --> 00:54:05,099
I have something else
I want to give you.

876
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:10,019
Being myself in front of my family
will take some getting used to,

877
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:11,754
but Arthur was right.

878
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:13,490
It does feel...

879
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,040
Good.

880
00:54:18,491 --> 00:54:19,541
Got it.

881
00:54:20,899 --> 00:54:22,049
A padlock?

882
00:54:22,112 --> 00:54:23,962
For the door. To keep it locked.

883
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,332
Shouldn't I leave it open?

884
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,800
Please, we have three young children.

885
00:54:30,730 --> 00:54:33,030
There's dangerous stuff in there.
