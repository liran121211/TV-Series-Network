<i>- previously on dexter...</i>

3
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,559
- it's always the same
three kills with trinity.

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,361
Young woman
in the bathtub...

00:01:51,395 --> 00:01:52,579
- [moans]

6
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:55,448
- followed by a mother
falling to her death.

- [screams]

8
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,236
- and ending with a man
getting bludgeoned.

9
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,454
Trinity's likely someone

10
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,957
Who's gone his own solitary way
through life,

11
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,625
Foregone all
but the most rudimentary

12
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,244
Of human connections.

13
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:08,628
A lone wolf.

14
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:11,047
If we can find where
he bludgeoned back then...

15
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:14,384
Lobby's open 24 hours,
guard on duty.

16
00:02:14,418 --> 00:02:16,002
Too much foot traffic--
trinity would have

17
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,754
To choose another floor.

18
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,222
- ooh, so sorry.

19
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:21,374
Wasn't watching
where i was going.

20
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:22,542
- white male,

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,210
Eyes blue,

22
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,846
Something in them.

23
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,215
- super agent lundy has a hunch
that the dead woman

24
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:31,050
Is connected
to this big serial killer case.

25
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,052
- you still dating
that she-bag reporter?

26
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,404
After she put lundy's name
in the paper?

27
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,906
- tell me, is this conversation

28
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,223
Going to end up
in the paper too?

29
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,358
'cause you have no idea

30
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,993
The shit storm
you've gotten me into.

31
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,444

00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,333
Our vacation murder suspect.

Shoplifting with his high school
girlfriend nikki wald.

- get down!
[gunshots]

36
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,955
- i think we should inform
the brass

37
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,006
About our relationship.

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,741
- it's none of their business.

39
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,093
- i get a gig in town
to spend more time with you,

40
00:02:57,128 --> 00:02:59,012
And you spend
all your time

41
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,246
With your ex.

42
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:05,251
- don't go disappearing
on me again.

43
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,971

- hey, you.

49
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:46,176
Back behind the line.
- no, i was called here.

50
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,677
I'm dexter morgan.
that might be my sister.

51
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,062
- i understand, sir,
but right now i need you

52
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,563
To step back
and let our people do their job.

53
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,565
- no, no, i'm
with miami metro forensics.

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,317
My laminate and my wallet
are in the car.

55
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:56,186
- until i see some i.d.,
i need you to step back.

56
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,487
- and i need you
to fucking listen.

57
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,738
My sister was shot,

58
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,357
No one can tell me
what her condition is,

59
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:01,641
And that's a dead body.

60
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,159
- sir.

61
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:05,528
- you want to let me go.

62
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,530
- hansen. hands off.

63
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:10,667
He's one of us.

64
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,152
- deb's alive.
okay?

65
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,988
They're taking her
to the hospital.

66
00:04:15,006 --> 00:04:16,873
- i have to see her.

67
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,375
How bad is it?

68
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:19,926
- lost a lot of blood.

69
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:26,499
- if deb dies,

70
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:28,768
I'll be...

71
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:30,220
Lost.

72
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,605
- paramedics think the bullets
are through and through.

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,890
- she's gonna be okay?

74
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,891
- it's looking good.

75
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:38,445
[siren wails]

76
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,946
- who did this?

77
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:41,681
- we got here
just before you did.

78
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,117
- quinn was first on scene.

79
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:48,121
He says it's smelling like
the vacation murders' m.o.

80
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:49,122
- then that's...

81
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:51,374
- lundy.

82
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:02,302
- what was deb doing with lundy
at 5:00 in the morning?

83
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,970
Oh.

84
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,972
- dexter, i swear to you,
we will find who did this.

85
00:05:06,007 --> 00:05:08,591
- my kit's in my car.

86
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,592
- hey, hey, hey.

87
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,927
You got better places to be.

88
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,312
Like with your sister.

89
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,097
Go. that's an order.

90
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:17,100
- you'll know the minute
we know anything.

91
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,656
- lundy was a worthy adversary.

92
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:24,858
He deserves better

93
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:29,162
Than to be face down
in a hotel parking lot,

94
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,581
A random victim
of a senseless crime.

95
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:34,617
- sorry about deb, man.

96
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:35,618
- did she say anything?

97
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,870
- she was in shock,

98
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,071
Didn't see
who pulled the trigger.

99
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:39,422
- batista said you think

100
00:05:39,457 --> 00:05:40,740
This looks like
the vacation murders.

101
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,509
- deb's cash
and credit cards are gone.

102
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,744
So's lundy's watch and wallet.

103
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:53,470
- anything, vince?

104
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:56,106
- surgeon general wouldn't
have been able to save him.

105
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,225
Gsws to the neck and chest.

106
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,276
He bled out in seconds.

107
00:06:00,311 --> 00:06:03,229
- lundy was shot twice?

108
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,616
Deb was vulnerable
and a potential witness.

109
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,937
The shooter could have easily
finished her off like lundy.

110
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,605
I should get to the hospital.

111
00:06:12,623 --> 00:06:14,941
- deb, she knows.

112
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:16,743
Even though
we go at it all the time,

113
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,295
We're still...

114
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,715
- yeah, she knows.

115
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,384
- we're gonna
get these fuckers.

116
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,586
- not if you're looking
in the wrong direction.

117
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,392
- detective quinn.

118
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,127
- not now. really.

119
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,646
- i didn't come here
for a quote.

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,730
You all right?

121
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:39,432
- my partner's been shot.

122
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:40,850
The last thing i am
is all right.

123
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,853
- i know this can't be easy,

124
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:47,306
But if you need anything,

125
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,109
I'm here for you.

126
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,810
- thanks, christine.

127
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,996
That means a lot.

128
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,114
I got to...

129
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:59,002
- it's okay.
- all right.

130
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:00,086
- sergeant batista.

131
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,004
- no comment.

132
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,505
- come on, sergeant.

133
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,291
Is this the work
of the vacation murderers?

134
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:08,094
- i said no...

135
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,433
On the record.

136
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,768
[clicks pen]

137
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,769
It's too early to tell,

138
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,771
But one of 'em,
johnny rose,

139
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,840
We found out has syphilis,

140
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,809
And it's real bad.
untreatable.

141
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:24,394
Multiple partners.

142
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,512
Print that.

143
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,231
With pictures.

144
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,349
- i call it in now,

145
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,318
It'll be online this morning

146
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,454
And on the stands
this afternoon.

147
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,823
With pictures.

148
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,665
- while my colleagues

149
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,250
Are working
the vacation murder theory,

150
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,135
I'm gonna follow lundy's theory

151
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,171
And check his hotel room
for clues.

152
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:54,424
- lundy devoted his life
to hunting trinity.

153
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,925
- he left word for me

154
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,710
He'd had
an interesting encounter

155
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,480
Two days ago.

156
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,765
- you think it was trinity?

157
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,235
- every crime scene
is a jigsaw puzzle.

158
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:06,903
So many pieces.

159
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,521
Assemble them right,

160
00:08:08,555 --> 00:08:10,323
A picture forms.

161
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:11,741
If it was trinity,

162
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,444
It'd explain why deb is alive
and lundy isn't.

163
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,279
- trinity's a monster.

164
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,698
If he was the one
who hurt your sister,

165
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,400
You need to kill him.

166
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,504
That was my blood
down there too.

167
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:29,842
You can't let these
be logged into evidence.

168
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:32,078
- not until
i have a complete picture.

169
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,641
- police so far
are refusing to comment

170
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,809
On the murder
of a former fbi agent

171
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,061
And the shooting
of a miami metro

172
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,095
Homicide detective.

173
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,563
But channel nine has learned

174
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:51,981
There may be a connection

175
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,566
To the so called
vacation murders.

176
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,817
Sources tell us that...

177
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,987
- all right. denver omelet,
side of rye toast.

178
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,822
Can i top that off
for ya?

179
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,274
- coffee's fine,

180
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:03,793
But there are no diced tomatoes
in my omelet.

181
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:05,278
- i'm sorry about that.

182
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,779
Cook is slammed today.

How's that coffee?

185
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:12,252
- my coffee's not the issue.

186
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,471
My breakfast,
on the other hand, is.

187
00:09:15,506 --> 00:09:17,173
You need to start over.

- oh, it's okay.

195
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,910
He was in such a hurry
he probably forgot it.

196
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:38,911
Could be the hospital.

197
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,646
- is aunt deb gonna die?

198

- some man.
he says he's dexter's landlord.

200
00:09:46,704 --> 00:09:49,205
There's something wrong
with dexter's apartment.

201
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,791
- oh, there's got to be
a misunderstanding.

Uh, yes, hi.

- not long.

205

You're sitting up.

206
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:16,532
It's a good sign.

207
00:10:16,567 --> 00:10:19,319
- i'm fine.

208
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:24,157
I didn't even need surgery.

209

Couple stitches.

210
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:31,214
- looks like
more than a couple.

211
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:35,201
You have any pain?

212
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:40,256
- no. just tired.

213
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,392
Whatever they gave me
has some kick.

214
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:43,393
- you want me to come back?

215
00:10:43,427 --> 00:10:48,381

You see anything unusual?

218

- it's all still a blur.

219
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,409
- who was hit first?

But not my brother.

226
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:10,169
- you said you were fine.

227
00:11:10,204 --> 00:11:12,338
Twice.

228
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:13,956
- doesn't matter, anyway.

229
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:18,261
- just tell me
what you want me to do.

230
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:22,048
- that's just it.

231
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:24,767
You can't do anything.

232

No one can.

233
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:33,726
I didn't feel anything.

234
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,361
I didn't even know
i'd been hit

235
00:11:35,396 --> 00:11:38,981
Until i was on the ground.

236
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,984
And then two more shots.

237
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,793
So much blood.

238
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:53,329
- you're safe.

00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,047
I'm here.

240
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:59,669
- lundy had this look
in his eyes.

241
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,308
Like he was apologizing.

242
00:12:05,342 --> 00:12:09,462
I couldn't do anything.

243
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,181
I was helpless.

244
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:16,652
Fuck, i can't even walk

245
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:18,488
Three feet to the bathroom.

00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,075
- yeah. bad.

Okay?

- mm-hmm.

251
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:42,178
- i may not know
who shot my sister,

252
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,515
Or why her life was spared,

253
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,218
But i do know i won't
be returning the favor.

- how's deb?

- i was so worried.

262

Can i see her?

With anton.

But i got hung up
on the phone.

Your landlord called.

At your apartment?

- oh.

271

I was just
hanging on to the place

272
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:42,555
Until the lease ran out.

273
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,024
So i could get
the security deposit back.

274
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:47,326
- why'd you tell me
you got rid of it?

275
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,327

the time or the place,

Not with deb here.

lundy's daughter.

- then you could really use

302
00:15:36,169 --> 00:15:39,555
A shot of whiskey in there.

303
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,526

personally invested in this,

That we're seeing each other.

- i know.

311
00:16:02,496 --> 00:16:04,363
But it was
the right thing to do.

312
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:07,833
- i said i was uncomfortable
with the disclosure stuff,

313
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,135
And you go ahead
and do it anyway?

314
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:11,087
- i made a judgment call.

315
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:15,341
- the problem, maria,

316
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,894
Is that you made it
for the both of us.

317
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,565
You shouldn't keep
the deputy chief waiting.

No witnesses,
no security cameras.

Took a statement from deb,

- exactly.

347
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,126
Maybe we turn these two
against each other.

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:28,497
- rita was right.

a new page of the code?

you can give me a ride?

366
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,187
- of course.

367
00:18:25,222 --> 00:18:28,190
- i'm also kind of
gonna need a place to stay.

368
00:18:28,225 --> 00:18:29,558
I broke up with anton,

369
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,277
And, no, i don't want
to talk about it.

370
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:33,646
- we can make room for you.

371
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,514
- rita won't mind?

372
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,484
- don't worry, deb.
i'll take care of everything.

373
00:18:43,907 --> 00:18:46,075
- trinity's a lone wolf.

374
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,693
Unable to connect.

375
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:49,361
Except with his victims.

376
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,081
He never deviates.

377
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,968
Bleeds out a young female
in a bathtub,

378
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,338
Forces a woman
to jump to her death,

379
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,724
And five days later

380
00:19:01,758 --> 00:19:03,893
Bludgeons an older male.

381
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:06,812
I'll look at potential sites.

382
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:10,182
This may be the closest
to trinity i've ever been.

383
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,352
- lundy got closer
than he thought.

384
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:16,655
- he just couldn't see
how all the pieces interlock,

385
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,442
What they form.

386
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:28,233
A sacred ritual.

387
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:31,570
- if there's anyone who knows
the importance of ritual,

388
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,205
It's you.

389
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,707
- lundy underestimated

390
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,091
How far trinity would go

391
00:19:36,126 --> 00:19:37,626
To make sure his ritual

392
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,128
Wasn't interrupted.

393
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,380
- lundy was an obstacle.

394
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,299
- and trinity killed him.

395
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,137
- if anyone has ever deserved
to be on your table,

396
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:50,556
It's this son of a bitch.

397
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,955
- can i help you?

398
00:20:05,989 --> 00:20:07,957
- i'm taking on a project.

399
00:20:07,991 --> 00:20:09,608
- how big?

400
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,244
- almost more
than i can handle.

401
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:14,046
And i don't have
a lot of time.

402
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,464
- maybe you need
another hand or two.

403
00:20:15,498 --> 00:20:16,999
There's plenty
of laborers out there.

404
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,953
- no, no.
i work alone.

405
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,505
- sounds like you need
the right tool for the job.

406
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,558
- so much work.

407
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:29,011
But i have to finish
what i started, right?

408
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,180
- yeah, i--i guess.

409
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:34,800
[ominous music]

410
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,685
- what would you do?

411
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:37,770
- me?

412
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,739
Oh, i'd go
with the framing hammer.

413
00:20:40,774 --> 00:20:42,408
Got a lot of heft.

414
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,026
It's versatile.

415
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:48,781
You can't go wrong.

416
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,699
- i see what you mean.

417
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,339
You've been very helpful.

418
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:25,367
- lobby's open 24 hours.
[tape fast-forwards]

419
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,486
12-story building,
hundreds of rooms.

420
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,871
Trinity could strike anywhere.

421
00:21:28,905 --> 00:21:31,991
He'll have to set up shop
in the surveillance room.

422
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:34,076
Trinity's
the perfect predator--

423
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,996
Camouflaged, waiting
for his victim to be alone,

424
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,864
And then he strikes.

425
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:42,084
- trinity struck here
30 years ago.

426
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,037
A bartender,
father of two,

427
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,972
Was found bludgeoned to death

428
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:48,340
In the men's room of a tavern

429
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,175
At this same address.

430
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,511
If history
is going to repeat itself,

431
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:56,648
This is where trinity will be.

432
00:21:56,683 --> 00:22:00,602
- problem is, you have no idea
who you're looking for.

433
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,187
- lundy was so methodical,

434
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,723
He would have commented
on trinity's physical appearance

435
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,608
If their paths
had ever crossed,

436
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,727
But there's
nothing in his tapes.

437
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:10,946
I've listened to them all.

438
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,531
- you sure about that?

439
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:13,832
<i>that's your recorder.</i>

440
00:22:13,867 --> 00:22:17,369
Where's lundy's?

441
00:22:17,403 --> 00:22:19,204
- it wasn't in the hotel,

442
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,541
Because lundy had it on him.

443
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:25,260
Must have been
logged into evidence--shit.

444
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:26,462
- dexter, you need that tape.

445
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:27,963
You need to be certain

446
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,214
It's trinity on your table.

447
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:30,599
- there's still time.

448
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,634
He won't complete the cycle
until tomorrow night.

449
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,470
And i'll be here.

450
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:37,306
Waiting.

451
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:39,558
- oh, god!

452
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:43,095
Oh!

453
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:46,398
[moans, laughs]

454
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,129
- that was, uh...

455
00:23:00,163 --> 00:23:01,830
- unexpected.

456
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:05,300
- that's not an adjective
i usually hear.

457
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:08,220
- i'm not complaining.

458
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,672
I'm just--

459
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,342
I'm just wondering
why you're really here.

460
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,061
- my way of saying i appreciate
you running that story

461
00:23:16,096 --> 00:23:17,062
For my boss.

462
00:23:17,097 --> 00:23:18,897
- okay. hmm.

463
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,849
You fucked me to thank me?

464
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,151
- technically,
i went down on you

465
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:23,152
To thank you.

466
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:28,807
[laughter]

467
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:32,578
- i thought you said
this was just too complicated,

468
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:36,648
You being a cop
and me being a reporter.

469
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,034
- i guess i like complicated.

470
00:23:42,672 --> 00:23:45,541
- look who's here.

471
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:47,009
- sorry, astor.

472
00:23:47,043 --> 00:23:49,327
I promise
it won't be for long.

473
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:50,712
- it's okay.
i get cody's room.

474
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,881
- sorry, cody.

475
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,268
- come on, guys.
it's time to go to school.

476
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,170
Check in later.

477
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,511
[door closes]

478
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,864
- everything all right
between you and my brother?

479
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:11,683
- we just need
to have a talk.

480
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,952
- it isn't about
me staying here, is it?

481
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:16,622
- no, you're family.
you're always welcome here.

482
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,690
I'm gonna
let you get settled in,

483
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,292
And i'm gonna get you
some water

484
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:23,078
For these pain pills, okay?

485
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,384
- rita.

486
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:31,136
Thank you.

487
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:42,598
[dramatic music]

488
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:16,798
- thanks for letting deb
stay with us.

489
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,752
- it was either here
or your apartment.

490
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,521
Look, we can't
keep putting this off.

491
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:23,972
- it's still not a good time.

492
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,057
I need to get to the station.

493
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,191
- so when do you suppose

494
00:25:26,226 --> 00:25:27,425
It'll be a good time

495
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,928
To discuss
why you lied to me?

496
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:32,064
I'm really trying here,
dexter.

497
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,949
[horn honks]
- dexter.

498
00:25:33,983 --> 00:25:36,652
- i'm just asking for
a little patience, all right?

499
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,203
Not for me, but for deb.

500
00:25:38,238 --> 00:25:40,372
Right now i need to focus
on finding who did this.

501
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:45,744
- okay.

502
00:25:55,672 --> 00:25:57,389
- you didn't
come over last night.

503
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:59,791
- so little time
to sleep lately.

504
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:02,678
I thought i'd get more rest
in my own bed.

505
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:06,515
- i'm sorry i went
behind your back to matthews.

506
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:11,937
It was wrong,
and i apologize.

507
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,438
If you haven't noticed,

508
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:15,524
I'm a bit of a control freak.

509
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:17,492
- you mean like how like
to guard the remote control

510
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:18,810
With your life?

511
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,979
Or how you need to be
the first one in the shower

512
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,080
Or how you like to--

513
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:25,150
- look, the reason
i went to the brass

514
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,585
Was because it'd be

515
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,787
One less thing to worry about
ruining what we have.

516
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:31,790
- the only thing
that would ruin what we have

517
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,176
Is if we're not honest
with each other.

518
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,712
No more secrets.

519
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,797
- no more secrets.

520
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:42,351
[timer dings]

521
00:26:42,385 --> 00:26:46,671
- then i'm not going anywhere.

522
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,223
- that's everything collected

523
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,524
From the parking lot
and the hotel rooms

524
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,143
Back there on the right.

525
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:53,145
- [sighs]
thanks for doing this.

526
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,113
My father gave deb the ring,

527
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:56,782
And it means the world to her.

528
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:57,866
- i checked the inventories.

529
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,517
Masuka never logged it in.

530
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:02,788
- yeah, deb doesn't remember
if she was wearing it or not.

531
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,907
The shooting has her
pretty messed up.

532
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,026
If my coming down here
to double check

533
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,027
Helps ease her mind,

534
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,028
So be it, right?

535
00:27:10,046 --> 00:27:14,249
- yep.

536
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,034
- ah, fuck.

537
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,869
Damn it.

538
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,471
- you morgans and that mouth.

539
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,839
- do you mind?

540
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:22,057
- oh, yeah.
don't sweat it.

541
00:27:22,091 --> 00:27:23,759
There's plenty more
where those come from.

542
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,811
- thanks.

543
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,500
- here you go.

544
00:27:48,534 --> 00:27:51,586
- guess who just found her ring.

545
00:27:51,621 --> 00:27:53,038
Sorry for the trouble.

546
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:54,039
Thanks a lot, though.

547
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:57,209
- no problem.

548
00:27:57,243 --> 00:27:59,010
- i appreciate
the personal tour.

549
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,462
- any time i can do rounds

550
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,764
With a fellow human being
is a win.

551
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,016
- you're alone every night?

552
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,085
- yeah, economy's a bitch.

553
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:09,438
There used to be two of us
on every shift, but now--

554
00:28:09,472 --> 00:28:10,605
- oh, say no more.

555
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,358
I'm recently laid off myself.

556
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:16,528
From here on out
i'm gonna be my own boss.

557
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:18,897
- well, there's plenty
of office space here.

558
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:20,782
You know, more tenants
means more money.

559
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:22,734
Then maybe i won't have
to do these double shifts

560
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,569
And i can see my kids
once in a while.

561
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:26,288
Oh, you end up
setting up shop here,

562
00:28:26,322 --> 00:28:28,940
I guarantee this'll be
your favorite destination

563
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,459
Come lunch time.

564
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:31,460
- right on schedule.

565
00:28:31,494 --> 00:28:32,794
And you brought me
a customer.

566
00:28:32,829 --> 00:28:34,612
- it's a future renter.

567
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,332
- well,
possible future renter.

568
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,000
- can i get you any?

569
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,385
- no, no.

570
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,171
Caffeine makes me
a different person.

571
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,808
Appreciate the offer, though.

572
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,393
So you say
you walk this whole place

573
00:28:48,428 --> 00:28:50,061
Every two hours?

574
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,847
That's quite a workout.

575
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:54,132
- my wife calls it
low-impact aerobics

576
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,818
Or some shit like that.

577
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:59,070
It takes about 45 minutes,

578
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,989
Give or take a smoke break.

579
00:29:01,023 --> 00:29:05,494
- well, we all have our vices.

580
00:29:05,528 --> 00:29:07,529
- so how'd you like
the building?

[elevator bell dings]

582
00:29:10,032 --> 00:29:11,116
- it's perfect.

583
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,617
- great.

584
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,618
- thanks a lot.

585
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,537

[baby crying]

587
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:27,215
- rita, i think
something's wrong with harrison.

588
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:30,519
- i know that cry.

589
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:33,355
Someone's wet, isn't he?

590
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:34,773
- good.

591
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:35,774
Thought it was me.

592
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,359
- oh, no.

593
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:40,562
No, harrison
loves his aunt deb.

594
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:52,624
Can i ask you something?

595
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:54,409
- i don't do diapers.

596
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,747
- did dexter tell you
he kept his apartment?

597
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,466
- what the fuck?

598
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:04,920
Are you kidding?

599
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,638
He told me he got rid of it.

600
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:09,591
- me too.

601
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,594
Just thought
he might have said something

602
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,647
Since you two are so close.

603
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,098
- not a word.

604
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:26,575
God, it's like a morgan family
curse or something--

605
00:30:26,609 --> 00:30:29,227
Make the worst choice
possible.

606
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:37,953
At least dexter's
don't get people killed.

607
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:41,423
- you think you're responsible
for lundy's death?

608
00:30:41,457 --> 00:30:43,741
- he never would have been
anywhere near that parking lot

609
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,594
If it weren't for me.

610
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:48,380
- is that why your pain pills
are in the trash?

611
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:51,266
Punish yourself?

612
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,052
What happened to lundy
isn't your fault.

613
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,138
You had no control over it.

614
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:00,225
This isn't about choices

615
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,777
Or even about you.

616
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:05,146
Sometimes bad things
just happen.

617
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:16,074
- that's the answer to this?

618
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,326
Bad things happen?

619
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,278
- life happens.

[tape fast forwards]

623
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,424
Trinity moves
from state to state.

624
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:34,676
Law enforcement never links
his kill cycles

625
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:37,846
To one another.

626
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:40,398
Over 30 years of killing.

627
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,567
- the cycle, the ritual,

628
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:44,686
They tell me
where trinity will be,

629
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,988
But i have to know
who i'm looking for.

630
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:48,490
I have to be sure.

631

Guard on duty.

633
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:53,778
Too much foot traffic.

634
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,580
Trinity'd have
to choose another floor.

635
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:58,199
- ooh. sorry.

636
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,819

- lundy saw a ghost.

644
00:32:22,892 --> 00:32:24,225
- okay, listen up, everyone.

645
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,778
I just got word there was
a shooting at a motel.

646
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:28,780
You all need to get there
as soon as possible, guys.

647

So quinn's already en route.

I've got it.

657
00:32:43,412 --> 00:32:44,829
Let's just hope deb

00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,414

gonna get some justice.

- tom, this is bullshit.

733
00:35:38,254 --> 00:35:40,221
We followed protocol.

their tails over nikki wald,

- i'm kind of
in the middle of something.

Can it wait?

751
00:36:24,466 --> 00:36:25,967
- no.

- well, i'm way over
on the other side of town.

753
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:30,254
It'll take me
at least an hour to get there.

754
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,473
- i'm not home.

755
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,943
I'm where frank was shot.

756

00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:53,444
It's like it never happened.

And you're doing
your goddamn best

763
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,956
To throw it all away.

764
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,595
- rita told you
about the apartment?

- what the fuck
were you thinking?

00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:14,565
You have to make this right.

00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:59,227
Yesterday,
i had lundy and anton.

781
00:38:02,698 --> 00:38:04,732
And now they're gone
because of me.

782

Or what i choose.

785

I'm hurting
everyone around me.

I am.

794
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:56,918
Why don't we
go back to the house?

795
00:38:56,952 --> 00:39:00,872
- don't! don't.

796
00:39:00,906 --> 00:39:04,842
I need to be here.

797
00:39:04,877 --> 00:39:08,513
Where lundy died.

798
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:12,433
I can't do
a fucking thing about it.

799
00:39:26,315 --> 00:39:30,818
- my sister doesn't deserve
to be in this kind of pain.

800
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,456
But i know who does.

801
00:39:35,491 --> 00:39:36,991
Trinity hurt my sister,

802
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,793
And i'm going
to hurt him back,

803
00:39:38,827 --> 00:39:44,215
And it's going to feel--
uh-oh.

804
00:39:44,249 --> 00:39:46,217
- your manager let me in.

805
00:39:46,251 --> 00:39:50,304
He had no idea
we were married.

806
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:54,559
Funny thing is,
i'm getting to wonder myself.

807
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:57,095
- rita, you're upset.

808
00:39:57,129 --> 00:39:59,797
- i actually convinced myself

809
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:00,848
That by coming here

810
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,650
This would all make sense...

811
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:05,103
Why it was so important

812
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:06,487
That you keep this place
a secret.

814
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:14,412
As i was coming over here,

815
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:15,646
All i could think about--

816
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:18,315
That you were using
drugs again.

817
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:21,152
That you were having
an affair again.

818
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,420
- that will never happen.

819
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,422
- i went through your cabinets,

820
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:28,342
Rifled through your desk,

821
00:40:28,377 --> 00:40:29,961
Looking for anything

822
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:31,929
That would explain

823
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:34,182
What would be so horrible

824
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:36,434
That my husband
would have to keep a place

825
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:38,052
To hide it from me

826
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,687
Or his own sister.

827
00:40:39,721 --> 00:40:41,839
- and?

828
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:43,191
- i was gonna break the lock,

829
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:46,227
But i was too scared
of what i might find.

830
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,729
And you know why?

831
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,899
'cause you put me
in this position, dexter.

832
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:55,236
This is not the type of person
or wife that i want to be.

833
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:06,581
- you really want to know
what's inside?

- yes.

835
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:30,438
- it was harry's.

836
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,828
I wasn't comfortable having it
in the house with the kids,

837
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:43,251
So i kept it here.

838
00:41:43,285 --> 00:41:45,336
See?

00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,955
I have nothing to hide.

00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,341
Except for the syringes,
scalpels, and bone saw

Hidden in that
secret drawer underneath.

- nothing to hide.

you really are at it.

909
00:46:56,648 --> 00:47:01,485
- what the hell's he doing?

910
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,321
Where are you going,
trinity?

911
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,327
- stay with him.

912
00:47:10,362 --> 00:47:13,497
He's not getting away.

913
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,289
- he doesn't belong here.
it doesn't make sense.

914
00:47:38,356 --> 00:47:40,941
- hi, honey.

915
00:47:40,976 --> 00:47:45,596
Mmm. missed you.

916
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:47,648
- hey, kids.

917
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,984
- daddy.

918
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:51,602
- hey, dad.

919
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,270
- lundy was wrong.

920
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:54,572
I was wrong.

921
00:47:54,606 --> 00:47:55,873
Neither of us

922
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,442
Knew pieces of the puzzle
were missing.

923
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,160
Trinity's a husband,

924
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:04,582
A father.

925
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:06,216
He's...

926
00:48:06,251 --> 00:48:08,619
Like me.
