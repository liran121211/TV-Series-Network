00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,611
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...

3
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:52,030
<i>No blood
What a gorgeous idea.

4
00:01:52,123 --> 00:01:56,224
Refrigerated truck.
He wants a cold environment...

5
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:58,525
to slow the flow of blood.

6
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:02,881
I suppose I should be upset,
but I'm not.

7
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,576
In fact,
I think this is a friendly message,

8
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:07,469
kind of like, "hey,
want to pla? "

9
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,569
Kara, it's me.
It's James.

10
00:02:11,796 --> 00:02:14,420
You just opened
a dangerous door.

11
00:02:14,933 --> 00:02:16,575
No, man.
You did...

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,917
when you murdered a cop
and an innocent lady.

13
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:22,667
Was Kara sleeping with
someone other than Ricky?

14
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,530
Was it you?

15
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,081
What the fuck were
you thinking?

16
00:02:28,177 --> 00:02:30,961
Going out tonight with the guys,
blow off steam. You in?

17
00:02:30,996 --> 00:02:32,120
Hey, man.
Sounds good.

18
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:35,032
I thought you said you
wanted to go get shit-faced.

19
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:36,431
I am shit-faced.

20
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:40,140
I showed my face to Guerrero,
to his whole church.

21
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,062
They're gonna think
I'm behind this shit.

22
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:45,061
You fucked my sister.
You fucked a cop's wife.

23
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,543
Now you're just fucked, buddy.

24
00:02:49,397 --> 00:02:52,311
He's escalating the thrill,
posing his victim

25
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,323
in the middle of a 20,000-seat
arena for all Miami to see,

26
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:57,571
to show us what he's
capable of doing.

27
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,793
What did I miss?

28
00:02:58,936 --> 00:03:01,650
- Fingertips.
- Fuckin' asshole, that's my girl.

29
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,711
This body belongs to the frozen
fingertips in the truck.

30
00:03:04,848 --> 00:03:06,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

31
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:10,183
I give you Tony Tucci,
the ice-truck killer.

32
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,060
Bullshit.

33
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,990
<i>Of course I agree
with my sister,

34
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,331
<i>but unlike her, I'm not upset.

35
00:03:15,438 --> 00:03:18,493
<i>He's still out there,
and I'm waiting...

36
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:20,442
<i>breathless.

37
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:40,391
<i>I find people around me are always
making some kind of connection,

38
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:43,301
<i>like friendship or romance,

39
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:46,681
<i>but human bonds always lead
to messy complications...

40
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,651
<i>commitment, sharing,

41
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:51,703
<i>driving people to the airport.

42
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:53,891
<i>Besides, if I let
someone get that close,

43
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:56,652
<i>they'd see who
I really am...

44
00:03:56,687 --> 00:03:59,032
<i>and I can't let that happen.

45
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:02,822
So, time to put on my mask.

46
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:09,190
- I need your expertise.
- I live to serve.

47
00:04:09,448 --> 00:04:10,943
Excuse us, fellas.

48
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:20,163
- Interesting hand job.
- That's funny.

49
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,502
It is?

50
00:04:24,578 --> 00:04:27,262
So, how long you think
it's been there?

51
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,070
This feels familiar.

52
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:37,152
Okay. So,
how long has it been there?

53
00:04:40,215 --> 00:04:44,022
Blood stopped pooling, still wet...
couple hours at the most.

54
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:45,663
What time was it found?

55
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:48,520
A jogger called it in
this morning about 7:30.

56
00:04:48,665 --> 00:04:52,292
No prints. Wiped clean.
Real creep show, huh?

57
00:04:52,336 --> 00:04:54,071
Any sign of the
rest of the body?

58
00:04:54,218 --> 00:04:58,072
Just Mr. Hand.
Do you think this is our guy's work?

59
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,832
The ice-truck killer?

60
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,682
It's hard to say. There's blood.
That's different.

61
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:07,573
Plus, it's a male victim --
haven't seen that before.

62
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:10,912
The cut appears to
be almost delicate.

63
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:13,750
You see between the first
and second row of carpals...

64
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:15,912
Very surgical.

65
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:20,582
Check out what else
he left behind.

66
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:25,542
A little postcard
to remember him by.

67
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:34,721
- How far is Rand Beach from here?
- This is Rand Beach.

68
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:38,250
It was renamed Petrie
Beach a few years ago.

69
00:05:50,546 --> 00:05:52,251
Okay, everybody.

70
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,961
Everybody say "stinky feet".

71
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,083
Stinky feet!

72
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,943
Wait. Nobody move.
Dexter, were you smiling?

73
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:05,960
- No.
- Okay, we'll do another one.

74
00:06:06,057 --> 00:06:08,351
This time, everybody smiles.
You, too, Dex.

75
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:10,181
Yeah, pretend you're
burning ants.

76
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,781
- Shut your damn face, Deb.
- Hey, language, please.

77
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:14,402
What?
She always talks like that.

78
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:16,923
Enough, you two.
Dexter, come here.

79
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:23,790
What's your problem?

80
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:25,192
I hate the beach.

81
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:27,351
It's sandy and gross and
nasty, and I want to go home.

82
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:30,121
Too bad.
You're part of a family.

83
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:33,042
And being part of a family
means smiling for photos.

84
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:36,141
Why should I
pretend I'm happy?

85
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:39,620
Because it'll make
your mom happy,

86
00:06:41,425 --> 00:06:43,631
and because it's
how you fit in.

87
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:46,353
- Remember we talked about that?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,042
This is how you do it.

89
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,972
When somebody takes your picture,
you smile.

90
00:06:50,006 --> 00:06:52,211
It doesn't matter if
you're happy or not.

91
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:54,890
You just do it to fit in.
Okay?

92
00:06:54,986 --> 00:06:57,102
- Okay.
- All right.

93
00:06:59,646 --> 00:07:01,223
Come here, handsome.

94
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:09,111
Okay. Everybody ready?
One more time.

95
00:07:11,406 --> 00:07:13,283
Stinky feet!

96
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:19,953
Yeah, I just need to stop by my
apartment to pick up a few labs.

97
00:07:20,095 --> 00:07:23,103
Straight to the station after, yeah.
Thanks, lieutenant.

98
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,862
<i>Dexter Morgan,

99
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:38,832
<i>this is your life.

100
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:44,773
<i>It is my new friend --
The ice-truck killer.

101
00:07:45,058 --> 00:07:48,602
<i>When he broke into my apartment,
he took some time to get to know me...

102
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,612
<i>my life...

103
00:07:51,688 --> 00:07:53,423
<i>my secrets.

104
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:07,251
...have even brought in
manpower from other counties

105
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:09,183
in an effort to
expedite the search.

106
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:12,310
Officially, Mr. Tucci has not
been charged with any crime...

107
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,052
Then tell the fucking governor
to free up funds for overtime.

108
00:08:15,097 --> 00:08:18,571
I mean the more guys I got out there,
the sooner we find Tucci.

109
00:08:19,728 --> 00:08:21,983
Kelly, I'll get back to you.

110
00:08:25,086 --> 00:08:27,133
What's wrong?

111
00:08:27,148 --> 00:08:30,202
Fingerprint I. D. came back
on that hand from the beach.

112
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:31,452
It belongs to Tony Tucci,

113
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:33,921
your ice-truck killer suspect.

114
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:35,153
What?

115
00:08:38,767 --> 00:08:42,521
Wait a minute.

116
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,973
No. No, no, no. No way.

117
00:08:45,158 --> 00:08:47,881
No way!
I mean, this --

118
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,752
This has to be a mistake!

119
00:08:49,777 --> 00:08:52,103
The mistake, Maria, was
unleashing a high-profile manhunt

120
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:54,700
before you had all the facts.

121
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:58,121
Fuck!

122
00:09:01,638 --> 00:09:06,042
Okay. This doesn't mean that
Tucci is not the killer.

123
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,512
Don't!

124
00:09:07,737 --> 00:09:10,513
Just... just don't.

125
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:13,662
You wanted to be on tv --
well, get ready...

126
00:09:13,697 --> 00:09:16,320
'cause the press will
annihilate us for this.

127
00:09:16,418 --> 00:09:19,242
We'll be lucky if Tucci's
mother doesn't file a lawsuit.

128
00:09:22,155 --> 00:09:23,512
All right.

129
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:28,010
You go talk to that woman.
Do your mea culpas.

130
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:29,653
If we handle this right,

131
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,593
maybe we can mitigate
the fallout.

132
00:09:32,787 --> 00:09:33,662
Tom!

133
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:36,900
I'm the last person
she wants to see.

134
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:38,901
I called her son a killer!

135
00:09:39,088 --> 00:09:41,323
And now's your chance
to make it right.

136
00:10:00,837 --> 00:10:03,452
So Laguerta screwed the
pooch on this one, huh?

137
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,843
I'm taking point.

138
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:07,693
You can help by getting all
non essentials off the beach.

139
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,843
Secure and separate any witnesses,
all right?

140
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:13,883
Will do. What did the Captain say?
Did he make her cry?

141
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,991
Just control the
fucking beach, Angel.

142
00:10:24,097 --> 00:10:26,003
I knew Tucci wasn't the killer.
I knew it.

143
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,620
Laguerta whipped
up a manhunt

144
00:10:27,633 --> 00:10:28,895
for a rent-a-cop.

145
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,411
Man, I wish I could have been there
to see the Captain rip her a new one.

146
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,397
Morgan, calm down.

147
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,981
Laguerta insulted the real
killer's intelligence,

148
00:10:36,115 --> 00:10:39,041
and now he's getting back at us
for chasing after the wrong guy.

149
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:40,803
You see all these
people over here?

150
00:10:40,837 --> 00:10:42,573
- Yeah.
- What are they?

151
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,532
Potential witnesses.

152
00:10:44,707 --> 00:10:47,301
And what do we do with
potential witnesses, Morgan?

153
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:51,332
We -- we interview them.
Got it.

154
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:02,601
Where is he...

155
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:05,871
The rest of him?

156
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,273
We're -- we're still looking.

157
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:14,373
The entire force is looking.
We're making every effort.

158
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:16,763
Are you sure it's
Tony? Because...

159
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:18,200
Yes.

160
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,742
I'm afraid so.

161
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:28,201
Mrs. Tucci...

162
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:33,183
I said some very harsh
things about your son.

163
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:34,260
Thank you.

164
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:41,521
"Thank you"?
For what?

165
00:11:41,937 --> 00:11:46,691
- For coming to tell me in person.
- For God's sake, please.

166
00:11:47,098 --> 00:11:49,303
There's nothing more
important than this.

167
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:52,821
Can you find my son's body?

168
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:55,013
If it's the last thing I do.

169
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,682
I made a grave...

170
00:11:56,696 --> 00:12:00,682
Bring him home, please.

171
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:03,720
I just want to bury my son.

172
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:20,003
I do love Halloween.

173
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:23,250
- What's inside of a pumpkin?
- See for yourself.

174
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:28,531
You don't like this stuff?
I do. Come on. Get in there.

175
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:34,183
I'll finish cleaning this out.
You can carve it tomorrow.

176
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:38,103
There he is again, mom.

177
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:40,631
My god.
It's every night now.

178
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:42,571
That dog?
Where's it coming from?

179
00:12:42,646 --> 00:12:44,762
Next door --
My neighbor's.

180
00:12:44,907 --> 00:12:47,452
Leaves the poor thing in
the yard all day and night.

181
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:50,131
It's been getting worse.
I mean, I would talk to her,

182
00:12:50,258 --> 00:12:52,182
but I don't want to
start something.

183
00:12:52,508 --> 00:12:55,130
Listen to him, mom.
He's so sad.

184
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:58,272
I just wish he would shut
up so I could sleep.

185
00:12:58,408 --> 00:12:59,951
Do you want me to talk to her?

186
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:02,202
No, you don't have to do that.

187
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:07,582
I insist.

188
00:13:30,335 --> 00:13:33,821
Hello.
I don't think we've met.

189
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:36,670
Boyfriend of the blonde next door.
I've seen you around.

190
00:13:36,705 --> 00:13:38,500
Look, I'm just getting in.
I'm tired.

191
00:13:38,515 --> 00:13:40,013
That's precisely why I'm here.

192
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:44,852
We can't help but notice your dog,
uh, cries... a lot.

193
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:47,632
I know.
My ex moved out and left his dog.

194
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:51,470
Trust me,
I wish there was something I could do.

195
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:54,221
You could, uh, take him inside.

196
00:13:54,415 --> 00:13:56,473
Walter's an outside dog.

197
00:13:56,615 --> 00:13:58,913
You put Walter inside,
Walter's an inside dog.

198
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:00,882
He doesn't like being inside.

199
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,412
Did he tell you that?

200
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:10,213
We'd really appreciate it if you
could find a way to keep him quiet.

201
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:11,642
The kids are upset.

202
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:13,652
Maybe that's 'cause they think their
crackhead father is gonna come back

203
00:14:13,845 --> 00:14:15,793
and beat their asses again.

204
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:20,643
You know what works
for me? Earplugs.

205
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:34,331
<i>I could make things so
much easier for Rita...

206
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:37,550
<i>but that would be wrong.

207
00:14:44,765 --> 00:14:46,953
<i>I love Halloween --

208
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:49,632
<i>the one time of year when
everyone wears a mask...

209
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:51,613
<i>not just me.

210
00:14:52,538 --> 00:14:55,853
<i>People think it's fun to
pretend you're a monster.

211
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:58,943
<i>Me, I spend my life
pretending I'm not.

212
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:05,400
<i>Brother, friend, boyfriend...
All part of my costume collection.

213
00:15:09,228 --> 00:15:11,623
<i>Some people might
call me a fraud.

214
00:15:11,705 --> 00:15:14,183
OK.
Let's see if it will fit.

215
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:20,103
You stabbed me in the back!

216
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:23,603
<i>I prefer to think of myself
as a master of disguise.

217
00:15:25,835 --> 00:15:27,673
They're so excited.

218
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:30,630
Sure they are. They get to binge
on sugar for an entire day.

219
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:31,983
Who wouldn't love that?

220
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:35,682
What about a costume for you?
Maybe this one?

221
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:41,542
No. No. I think I'll be Snow White
again. It's kind of tradition.

222
00:15:42,787 --> 00:15:45,033
Dexter, look.
I'm a princess, too.

223
00:15:45,265 --> 00:15:47,940
Just like your mom --
Two perfect princesses.

224
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:51,281
Let me guess.
You're gonna be a dwarf.

225
00:15:51,448 --> 00:15:54,450
No way.
I want to be Joe from "Blue's Clues. "

226
00:15:54,545 --> 00:15:57,981
I keep telling him that a
rugby shirt is not a costume.

227
00:16:06,126 --> 00:16:08,851
<i>Another photo from
my family album.

228
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:13,170
<i>He's re-creating my past with
Tony Tucci's body parts.

229
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,801
<i>He's forcing me to see this.

230
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:18,950
Nobody paying you to stand
around and goddamn stare.

231
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:22,330
I thought Angel was working
this case, Sergeant.

232
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,211
Sergeant?

233
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:29,811
Friends of yours?

234
00:16:30,347 --> 00:16:33,120
Don't worry about it.
Worry about this.

235
00:16:33,407 --> 00:16:36,792
The foot was severed between
the tarsus and the metatarsus.

236
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:39,593
The wound is circular --
again, almost surgical.

237
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:44,412
And there's blood. Guy gives us
body after body with no blood.

238
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:47,941
- Why he's making a switch now?
- He's trying to send a message...

239
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:51,510
One that's more important than his
ritual need to drain the blood and

240
00:16:51,658 --> 00:16:52,921
wrap the parts.

241
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:57,243
- Okay, so what's the message?
- I'm not sure.

242
00:16:57,386 --> 00:17:02,713
- Well, who's he sending it to?
- I can't tell you that, either.

243
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:06,263
What fucking good are you?

244
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:10,533
No fucking good at all,
apparently.

245
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:17,461
- You okay?
- He's mocking me.

246
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:21,633
Don't take it personally.
Doakes hates all you lab geeks.

247
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:22,923
Who?

248
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:25,195
- Relax, bro.
- Sorry.

249
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:29,601
I need to bag this photo under the ball.
Do you mind?

250
00:17:48,046 --> 00:17:50,112
<i>He knows.

251
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:54,353
<i>He's not corrupting the happy
hallmark images of my youth.

252
00:17:54,488 --> 00:17:57,923
<i>He's revealing the ugly
truth behind them.

253
00:17:58,717 --> 00:18:02,952
Come on, Simon. You want it?
It's right there.

254
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:05,393
Over there.
Oh, yeah.

255
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:10,853
- Guys, give it back!
- Come on, Simon.

256
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:17,691
All right. Enough.
Get out of here.

257
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:25,143
- What the hell is going on?
- We're just having fun.

258
00:18:25,268 --> 00:18:27,480
It didn't look like Simon
was having too much fun.

259
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:28,930
You're always
telling me to fit in,

260
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,133
and I'm just trying to
be part of the team.

261
00:18:31,865 --> 00:18:34,120
You can't be a bully, Dexter.

262
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,810
First of all it's wrong.

263
00:18:35,955 --> 00:18:38,443
Secondly, people
remember bullies.

264
00:18:38,626 --> 00:18:40,690
People like me -- cops.

265
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:44,070
A bully is a felony
waiting to happen.

266
00:18:44,537 --> 00:18:48,340
- So...
- Blend in.

267
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,183
Go on.

268
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:03,993
Officer Morgan,
I have an assignment for you.

269
00:19:04,138 --> 00:19:05,980
Yeah, I heard we found a
foot this morning.

270
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:08,131
You want me to head out
to the crime scene?

271
00:19:08,167 --> 00:19:08,533
No.

272
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:12,283
Look, we pulled these from security
cameras around the beach...

273
00:19:12,307 --> 00:19:14,062
Stores, hotels, ATMs.

274
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:16,650
I want you to check every frame.

275
00:19:16,687 --> 00:19:18,150
You are shitting me.

276
00:19:18,165 --> 00:19:21,432
If we're lucky, we can see the
ice-truck killer coming and going.

277
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:22,861
We have techs who can do this.

278
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,622
Not all techs have the skill

279
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,341
to spot suspicious activity.

280
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,070
I'm taking a huge leap
of faith that you do.

281
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:31,351
And keep your eye out for another
box of surveillance tapes.

282
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,581
It's on its way from
the new crime scene.

283
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:01,683
Hey, Doakes, what's up?
Fuck anyone's wife lately?

284
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:08,062
Thanks to your little
chickenshit stunt,

285
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:10,853
Guerrero's guys are tailing me
everywhere I go. Did you know that?

286
00:20:10,888 --> 00:20:14,081
That's not good, James.
You should alert the police...

287
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,920
Unless, of course, for some reason
the officers of Miami metro

288
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:20,130
wouldn't want to help you... like,
you know, you fucked one of their wives.

289
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:22,361
You think this is a joke.

290
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,380
I'm gonna end up dead.
It's just a matter of when.

291
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:29,751
You should have thought of that before
you stuck your dick in my sister.

292
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:31,251
You're right.

293
00:20:31,995 --> 00:20:35,522
I should have waited until
the divorce came through.

294
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:37,890
Bullshit.

295
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,650
What? She didn't tell you?

296
00:20:41,346 --> 00:20:44,021
She filed the papers, jackass.

297
00:20:44,446 --> 00:20:46,090
You don't believe me,
ask the Captain.

298
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,201
He tried to pull Ricky
out of his assignment,

299
00:20:48,236 --> 00:20:49,840
but Ricky didn't
want to come out.

300
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,331
Of course not.
His job was to bring down Guerrero.

301
00:20:52,366 --> 00:20:54,621
It was his job to
protect his wife.

302
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:59,242
Ricky's the motherfucker
who got her killed.

303
00:20:59,457 --> 00:21:01,802
You backed the
wrong cop, asshole.

304
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,642
Let's go, guys.
Time for school.

305
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:13,680
Guys? Come on.

306
00:21:13,825 --> 00:21:16,121
You don't want to be in
the Halloween parade?

307
00:21:23,377 --> 00:21:24,830
Shut up!

308
00:21:25,248 --> 00:21:27,450
Shut up! Just --

309
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:31,993
I need to talk to
you about your dog.

310
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:35,320
- I talked to your boyfriend.
- My kids are exhausted.

311
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:38,472
All right, when it comes to my kids,
I stop being nice.

312
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,601
So I need you to
bring him in at night,

313
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,182
feed him on a schedule,

314
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:45,760
and take him for some
exercise every now and...

315
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:49,851
I'm sorry.
Is this funny?

316
00:21:50,037 --> 00:21:52,293
No, no, no
It's... it's sad.

317
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,720
But you're funny.
Look at you, all tough.

318
00:21:57,486 --> 00:22:01,393
I'm gonna call the police.
I can do that.

319
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,982
There's nothing you can do.

320
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:05,113
The cops will tell
me to keep him quiet,

321
00:22:05,277 --> 00:22:07,293
and I'll say I will, and then

322
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:10,223
they'll leave,
and he'll go back to doing what he does.

323
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,403
But you're funny.

324
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:46,882
<i>Unlike Harry, my new friend doesn't
place much value in blending in.

325
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:50,033
<i>He wants me to see who
he is and what he does.

326
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:55,470
<i>Everything about him
is brazen, authentic.

327
00:22:56,448 --> 00:22:58,272
<i>What does that make me?

328
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:00,321
Crap.

329
00:23:08,076 --> 00:23:10,280
- You okay, man?
- No.

330
00:23:10,465 --> 00:23:12,413
Hey, don't let this
bastard get to you.

331
00:23:12,437 --> 00:23:14,542
You're the best blood
expert in the state,

332
00:23:14,917 --> 00:23:17,000
and we need you to stay with this,
my friend.

333
00:23:17,036 --> 00:23:18,863
I'll be all right.

334
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:23,091
Wait. Before you get back to work,
check this out.

335
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:29,100
What is that, a butterfly?

336
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:33,090
No, socio,
it's a diamond-studded four-leaf clover.

337
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:34,680
I'm...

338
00:23:35,185 --> 00:23:38,202
I'm giving it to Nina for our
anniversary tomorrow night.

339
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:41,391
Congratulations.
How many years?

340
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:44,171
10 years she's been
my lucky charm now.

341
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:46,593
Tin is the
traditional gift, but

342
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,081
I didn't think she'd
want a tin clover.

343
00:23:49,545 --> 00:23:53,693
No. It's probably a good plan.
Are you sure that's not a butterfly?

344
00:23:56,188 --> 00:24:00,280
Well, it does kind
of look like a bug.

345
00:24:02,595 --> 00:24:06,080
- This can't be right.
- What's up?

346
00:24:06,177 --> 00:24:08,853
You see that?
You see it?

347
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,093
I don't know.
What do I see?

348
00:24:10,138 --> 00:24:13,331
The blood flow in the hand suggested
the heart was still pumping

349
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,691
- when it was severed.
- Mean son of a bitch, no doubt.

350
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:18,373
But look at the foot.
It's the same blood flow,

351
00:24:18,556 --> 00:24:23,260
plus the lividity. Look, it's the
same bruising, same ashen color,

352
00:24:23,457 --> 00:24:26,890
same level of decomposition as
the hand the day we found it.

353
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:30,321
But... we found
them a day apart.

354
00:24:30,597 --> 00:24:31,812
I know.

355
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:36,522
Dios santo.

356
00:24:37,956 --> 00:24:40,560
L. T.,
you got to listen to him.

357
00:24:40,757 --> 00:24:44,473
It's the guard, Tucci...
I think he's alive.

358
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:46,161
What are you talking about?

359
00:24:46,626 --> 00:24:51,240
The ice-truck killer is keeping
him alive to perform amputations.

360
00:24:51,378 --> 00:24:52,742
Tucci's alive?

361
00:24:52,877 --> 00:24:55,231
Both limbs were taken
from a live body,

362
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:58,993
and we found them 24 hours apart.
That's not all.

363
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:00,302
Tell them, Dexter.

364
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:02,522
If the hand came off
yesterday at 7:00 A.M.

365
00:25:02,555 --> 00:25:04,011
and the foot this
morning at 7:00...

366
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:06,343
We get another body part
first thing tomorrow.

367
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:07,940
But he's alive.

368
00:25:08,087 --> 00:25:11,343
Put together a task force.
I want all available personnel on this,

369
00:25:11,378 --> 00:25:14,761
and put a priority status on all
forensics related to this case.

370
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:19,522
Captain Matthews, please.
Have him call me back immediately.

371
00:25:44,147 --> 00:25:45,651
Mrs. Tucci?

372
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,820
Maria Laguerta.

373
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:52,621
I have some amazing
news for you.

374
00:25:53,048 --> 00:25:56,190
We believe your son is alive.

375
00:25:56,937 --> 00:26:00,653
No. No.
We haven't, but I promise we will.

376
00:26:03,655 --> 00:26:05,532
No, thank you.

377
00:26:05,726 --> 00:26:10,100
Yes. Yes.
Okay, we'll be in touch. Bye.

378
00:26:16,945 --> 00:26:18,921
We've got a live
body now, people.

379
00:26:19,015 --> 00:26:21,373
We want to find Tucci
while he's still breathing.

380
00:26:21,407 --> 00:26:23,942
That means trying to figure
out where tomorrow's drop is

381
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:27,450
so we catch our man in the act.
Any ideas?

382
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:31,342
Don't forget the photos.
They're new.

383
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:35,060
Thank you, officer Morgan.
We're doing just fine out here.

384
00:26:35,336 --> 00:26:37,830
Why do we think he's
taking photos?

385
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:39,563
He wants to be remembered.

386
00:26:39,796 --> 00:26:41,951
You use photos to
record memories.

387
00:26:43,026 --> 00:26:46,363
<i>I almost feel sorry for them,
trying to put together a puzzle

388
00:26:46,507 --> 00:26:48,962
<i>when they don't know pieces
are missing from the box...

389
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:50,580
<i>...pieces he gave me.

390
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:58,671
<i>He wants me to play
the game his way.

391
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:01,851
Okay, what else could it be?

392
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:03,561
Change.

393
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,481
You got something to say,
speak up.

394
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:08,900
The beach changed names.

395
00:27:08,926 --> 00:27:11,400
The office park used
to be a soccer field.

396
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:16,262
He's dumping the body parts in places
that used to be something else.

397
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:20,390
Okay. Places that have changed.
Let's make a list,

398
00:27:20,527 --> 00:27:23,212
assign surveillance to each
location for the morning.

399
00:27:23,447 --> 00:27:25,501
South beach used to
be a mangrove swamp.

400
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,701
Homestead park was originally
an air force base, right?

401
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:31,851
They turned Versace's
mansion into a hotel.

402
00:27:32,405 --> 00:27:34,232
Thank you, officer Morgan.

403
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:37,162
The whole city of Miami
reinvents itself every 5 years.

404
00:27:37,195 --> 00:27:39,992
Then we'll stay up all night
until our list is complete.

405
00:27:40,237 --> 00:27:44,622
"I once was lost

406
00:27:45,037 --> 00:27:49,131
"But now I'm found,

407
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:57,663
"Was blind but now I see".

408
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:07,620
Lieutenant.

409
00:28:15,766 --> 00:28:17,120
Anything?

410
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,952
Well, I am so glad
you could make it.

411
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:27,680
Well, I just came by
to show my support.

412
00:28:29,077 --> 00:28:32,130
It's been a long time
since I've been to church.

413
00:28:33,886 --> 00:28:36,332
Excuse me, everyone.
Excuse me.

414
00:28:36,478 --> 00:28:41,232
I would like to introduce
you to someone very special.

415
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:45,651
This is Maria Laguerta.
She's the policewoman looking for Tony.

416
00:28:48,155 --> 00:28:53,473
Not just me.
Actually, there's a lot of us looking.

417
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:58,510
You brought us all here
together by giving us hope.

418
00:29:01,845 --> 00:29:08,063
May the Lord bless you
and guide you, Maria.

419
00:29:08,578 --> 00:29:10,833
This is Saint Anthony,

420
00:29:10,978 --> 00:29:14,363
- patron Saint of
- The lost.

421
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:19,143
Find him.

422
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:26,642
I tried to apologize,
but I couldn't get a word in edgewise.

423
00:29:26,836 --> 00:29:28,483
And you wanted to
apologize why?

424
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,363
You don't think I should,
the way I went after her son?

425
00:29:31,526 --> 00:29:33,251
Yeah, you did fuck that up.

426
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:36,582
Yeah. I crucified him
without having all the facts.

427
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:41,803
I need to tell her
that I'm sorry.

428
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:46,540
I need to let her know that I'm sorry.
I need to tell her.

429
00:29:46,726 --> 00:29:49,452
Who is that gonna make feel better,
you or her?

430
00:29:49,596 --> 00:29:52,791
Leave that woman alone with
her candles and "kumbaya".

431
00:29:59,266 --> 00:30:00,812
So, where we at?

432
00:30:00,956 --> 00:30:04,201
I added additional patrols
at Dolphin Stadium,

433
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,692
Bayside marketplace,
and Casa Casuarina.

434
00:30:06,827 --> 00:30:09,020
That's everybody we have
out in the field --

435
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:12,613
Homicide-Robbery, off-duty patrol.
So what's next?

436
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:15,690
What's next is you
should go home.

437
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:18,332
You've had the shit kicked
out of you all day.

438
00:30:18,367 --> 00:30:19,770
I like it here with you.

439
00:30:19,936 --> 00:30:24,120
You're the only person
people hate more than me.

440
00:30:24,268 --> 00:30:26,010
Come on.
Let's both get out of here.

441
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:28,300
Nothing left but the
waiting now, anyway.

442
00:30:42,265 --> 00:30:44,000
Officer Morgan.

443
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:46,542
Call me on my cellphone
if you find anything.

444
00:31:03,046 --> 00:31:05,101
Son of a bitch.

445
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:09,193
Fuck this.

446
00:31:15,435 --> 00:31:16,792
What?

447
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,713
Want a piece of me?

448
00:31:19,408 --> 00:31:21,330
Fucking asshole!

449
00:31:24,476 --> 00:31:28,380
I will pay you $1 million

450
00:31:28,527 --> 00:31:32,122
if you help me figure out where the
next piece of Tucci's gonna show up.

451
00:31:32,377 --> 00:31:34,491
I'm afraid I'm lost
on this one, Deb.

452
00:31:34,675 --> 00:31:36,991
It's like it's staring me
right in the face, but --

453
00:31:37,026 --> 00:31:38,472
$1 million.

454
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:40,442
You don't have $1 million.

455
00:31:40,577 --> 00:31:42,552
I'll steal it from evidence.

456
00:31:42,786 --> 00:31:45,182
I've been stuck in a
goddamn fishbowl all day.

457
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:46,910
I want to be part of the hunt.

458
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:49,402
- I'm almost off duty.
- Sorry, sister.

459
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:54,381
$2 million.
I know you made a list of locations.

460
00:31:54,527 --> 00:31:57,442
Just pick your favorite spot.
We'll stake it out together.

461
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:01,813
<i>My favorite spot. Of course.

462
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:04,581
Come on.
I want to play.

463
00:32:08,328 --> 00:32:12,141
Deb, I got to go.
We'll compare notes tomorrow, okay?

464
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:22,680
<i>I used to love this place --
The bulldozers pressing garbage,

465
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:25,503
<i>layer after layer,
right into the earth itself,

466
00:32:25,728 --> 00:32:29,682
<i>burying it, hiding it.
I found it soothing.

467
00:32:32,977 --> 00:32:35,792
<i>But it wasn't condos back then.

468
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:41,202
<i>This has to be the right place.

469
00:32:45,785 --> 00:32:47,280
<i>So what am I missing?

470
00:33:19,146 --> 00:33:23,333
Sorry about that.
Go back to sleep.

471
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:30,390
Hello.

472
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:32,170
Mr. Morgan?
Dispatch.

473
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:34,750
You've been called to the
McCaffrey pumpkin patch.

474
00:33:34,787 --> 00:33:38,691
- Do you need the address?
- No, I know exactly where it is.

475
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:44,252
Are you okay?

476
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:46,410
Are you kidding?
That was awesome.

477
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,470
You've got some
hay in your hair.

478
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,811
- Where?
- Right there!

479
00:33:52,017 --> 00:33:56,110
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Enough.
Enough, you two. Come on.

480
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,831
Let me take a picture
of you and the kids.

481
00:33:58,975 --> 00:34:01,221
You'll miss these moments
when they're older.

482
00:34:01,596 --> 00:34:02,513
Thanks.

483
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:05,532
It's great to see you having
such a good time, Dex.

484
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:08,680
Are you kidding me? This hay's
giving me a total allergy attack,

485
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:12,332
and we're going around in circles
on a pumpkin patch. I don't get it.

486
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:13,061
Ready?

487
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:14,361
Smile!

488
00:34:18,537 --> 00:34:19,912
What do we have?

489
00:34:20,147 --> 00:34:22,680
Ankle to knee.
He's moving up the leg.

490
00:34:26,245 --> 00:34:28,503
You think Tucci's still alive?

491
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:32,321
If he is, he won't be for long.

492
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:39,812
Unless you're toting
a portable DVD player,

493
00:34:40,046 --> 00:34:42,071
you better be finished watching
that security footage.

494
00:34:42,105 --> 00:34:44,641
I am on break.
I'm on my own time.

495
00:34:44,968 --> 00:34:48,292
So you are,
but your shift starts in two hours.

496
00:34:48,438 --> 00:34:50,780
So if I were you,
I'd head back to the station.

497
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:52,941
Traffic at this hour's a bitch.

498
00:34:54,556 --> 00:34:56,532
Speaking of bitch...

499
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:00,931
Didn't dad bring us here
once when we were kids?

500
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:02,231
I don't remember.

501
00:35:02,566 --> 00:35:04,760
Hey, Dexter, come here.
Take a look at this.

502
00:35:04,817 --> 00:35:05,792
Excuse us.

503
00:35:06,726 --> 00:35:09,262
She's right, you know,
about the traffic.

504
00:35:13,517 --> 00:35:15,610
It's interesting. There's
no sign of infection

505
00:35:15,628 --> 00:35:17,513
where the foot was cut off,
like he gave Tucci

506
00:35:17,546 --> 00:35:20,542
prophylactic antibiotics
before amputating.

507
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,642
At least he's looking
after his patient.

508
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:27,612
Hey, check this out.

509
00:35:28,905 --> 00:35:31,393
Is this appropriate?

510
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,961
It's our anniversary...

511
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:36,020
and it's the big one.

512
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:39,293
Nina deserves the best.

513
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:43,090
"Ox"?

514
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,121
No. Fuck!

515
00:35:46,498 --> 00:35:49,013
What's the matter with you?
It's x's and o'S.

516
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:50,601
Like tic-tac-toe?

517
00:35:50,627 --> 00:35:53,675
No, like "hugs and kisses".

518
00:35:53,675 --> 00:35:58,293
Diamond-filled hugs and kisses
in a white-gold setting.

519
00:35:58,317 --> 00:36:00,941
Well, that's good,
'cause you wouldn't want it to look like

520
00:36:00,965 --> 00:36:03,422
someone's playing
tic-tac-toe on her head.

521
00:36:08,127 --> 00:36:09,861
Goddamn it.

522
00:36:16,015 --> 00:36:17,561
Where's mom?

523
00:36:17,707 --> 00:36:20,773
She had to run a few errands before
she takes you two trick-or-treating.

524
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:22,903
But I'm too tired to
go trick-or-treating.

525
00:36:23,377 --> 00:36:25,491
I heard you two were
up a lot last night.

526
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:27,653
It was that damn dog.

527
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:30,321
Hey, Code,
grown-up language is for grown-ups.

528
00:36:30,558 --> 00:36:33,201
I don't think that dog will
be bothering you anymore.

529
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:36,241
- How do you know?
- My mystic powers told me.

530
00:36:36,387 --> 00:36:39,012
Heard Lindsay Lohan say "damn".

531
00:36:39,156 --> 00:36:41,191
All right, tell you what --
I'll make you a deal.

532
00:36:41,226 --> 00:36:44,280
When you become a rock star,
you can swear, too.

533
00:36:44,375 --> 00:36:50,313
- Walter! Walter!
- You're right. He's gone.

534
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:54,332
Where's my dog?!
What did you do with it?!

535
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,592
All right. Here he is.

536
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:20,032
Just remember to walk him,
feed him, and love him, okay?

537
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:25,180
My nieces are shy sometimes.
Girls, say thank you to Rita.

538
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,731
Thank you.

539
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:30,710
They already made a doggy bed --
sweaters, towels.

540
00:37:30,906 --> 00:37:33,252
It actually looks more
comfortable than my bed.

541
00:37:33,716 --> 00:37:35,812
I knew this would
be a perfect fit.

542
00:37:36,698 --> 00:37:39,322
You did a good thing, Rita.
Thank you.

543
00:37:44,786 --> 00:37:47,362
<i>Harry was the only
one who saw me...

544
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,620
<i>...really saw me...

545
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:51,591
<i>So he taught me to hide.

546
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:54,243
<i>That's what's kept me safe.

547
00:37:54,487 --> 00:37:58,580
<i>But sometimes, I'm not sure where
Harry's vision of me ends

548
00:37:58,607 --> 00:38:01,063
<i>and the real me starts.

549
00:38:01,925 --> 00:38:04,460
<i>If I'm just a collection
of learned behaviors...

550
00:38:04,646 --> 00:38:07,752
<i>bits and pieces of Harry...
maybe my new friend is right.

551
00:38:07,935 --> 00:38:10,143
<i>Maybe I am a fraud.

552
00:38:25,206 --> 00:38:27,933
- Hi.
- Hey.

553
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:34,671
Where's Astor and Cody?

554
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:38,391
They're passed out in a
sugar coma at Colleen's.

555
00:38:40,335 --> 00:38:47,720
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure. Sorry.

556
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:57,071
I should warn you,
I haven't really been myself lately.

557
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,362
Maybe I can cheer you up.

558
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:08,442
Trick or treat.

559
00:39:14,136 --> 00:39:15,971
You look great.

560
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,903
- Who are you?
- Lara Croft.

561
00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:29,313
"Tomb Raider".

562
00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:33,453
You raid tombs dressed like that?
That's impressive.

563
00:39:35,255 --> 00:39:37,043
What happened to Snow White?

564
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:39,711
Well, I'm -- I'm sick of her.

565
00:39:42,816 --> 00:39:44,591
You know, I never did

566
00:39:44,828 --> 00:39:48,210
get to thank you for
picking the kids up for me.

567
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:50,962
You took care
of your "errand"?

568
00:39:51,198 --> 00:39:52,083
Yes.

569
00:39:52,316 --> 00:39:55,563
The beagle has landed happily in
the arms of two loving girls.

570
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:57,810
You are a superhero.

571
00:40:04,236 --> 00:40:08,191
It was such an incredible
feeling rescuing that dog.

572
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:11,713
You upset your neighbor.

573
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:14,270
Fuck her.

574
00:40:17,365 --> 00:40:21,681
Well, I guess you're used to dealing
with people like her, right?

575
00:40:22,148 --> 00:40:24,492
Considerably worse.

576
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:28,300
Is that why you haven't
been yourself lately?

577
00:40:28,768 --> 00:40:32,341
There's a case I just can't
seem to get out of my mind.

578
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,702
Maybe I can help.

579
00:40:38,676 --> 00:40:42,211
No. I'm afraid there's
nothing you can do.

580
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:45,072
Oh, I don't know.

581
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:48,793
I'm a dognapper now...
and a tomb raider.

582
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:52,741
There's all sorts
of things I can do.

583
00:41:04,678 --> 00:41:06,971
What -- what are you doing?

584
00:41:07,626 --> 00:41:09,642
Whatever I want.

585
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:16,641
<i>I've come to appreciate the
comfortable moments with Rita...

586
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:19,481
<i>The easy, quiet moments--

587
00:41:21,528 --> 00:41:22,692
<i>This...

588
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:26,001
<i>...might be better.

589
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:31,963
Look, there's Mr.
Tub-of-Lardy bringing

590
00:41:32,196 --> 00:41:34,962
Mrs. Tub-of-Lardy another
bucket of fried chicken.

591
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:44,792
- Where's your brother?
- I'm not his keeper.

592
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,010
What do you think of this?

593
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:54,053
It's an anniversary
present for Nina.

594
00:41:54,477 --> 00:41:57,773
See, it's...
it's a diamond key to my heart.

595
00:41:58,787 --> 00:42:00,903
It's... it's a key,

596
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:03,293
but, you see,
it's shaped like a heart.

597
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,892
You can't tell me that it
looks like anything else,

598
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:08,842
'cause that's what it is.
That's it. That's what I like.

599
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:11,041
And I'm not gonna take it back.

600
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:14,750
It's perfect, Angel.
She'll love it.

601
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,323
Really?

602
00:42:17,575 --> 00:42:18,841
I would.

603
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,932
How... How do I look?
Like the tie?

604
00:42:36,698 --> 00:42:38,143
Angel.

605
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:41,742
Happy anniversary, baby.

606
00:42:42,115 --> 00:42:45,412
You know you can't just
walk in here anymore.

607
00:42:51,058 --> 00:42:52,742
I just thought...

608
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:56,873
...our anniversary...

609
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:02,481
Maybe tonight we could
put all that behind us.

610
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,471
It doesn't matter
what night it is.

611
00:43:06,165 --> 00:43:08,283
I told you I need time.

612
00:43:08,428 --> 00:43:11,243
It's been three months, baby.

613
00:43:11,936 --> 00:43:13,723
How much time do you need?

614
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:16,611
Don't turn this around
on me, Angel...

615
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:18,800
...Not after what you did.

616
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:23,242
I need as much time as I need.

617
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:32,983
Angel...

618
00:43:37,607 --> 00:43:42,031
As long as you're here,
you want to see Aury?

619
00:43:55,868 --> 00:43:58,073
Lo siento, princesa.

620
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,601
Lo siento, lo siento,
lo siento.

621
00:44:32,926 --> 00:44:33,860
Thank you.

622
00:44:50,048 --> 00:44:51,541
That was...

623
00:44:56,036 --> 00:44:57,571
...unexpected.

624
00:44:58,877 --> 00:45:01,462
Yeah.
For me, too.

625
00:45:05,067 --> 00:45:07,182
I have no problem with...

626
00:45:08,018 --> 00:45:09,272
unexpected.

627
00:45:11,316 --> 00:45:12,573
No, you...

628
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:14,382
certainly don't.

629
00:45:23,078 --> 00:45:25,561
I have to get back to the kids.

630
00:45:28,997 --> 00:45:31,012
What are these?

631
00:45:33,738 --> 00:45:38,070
I've been reorganizing
my photos a little.

632
00:45:38,377 --> 00:45:42,521
Look how cute you are.

633
00:45:42,845 --> 00:45:47,361
And your dad --
such a nice face, just like you.

634
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:52,533
- I was adopted.
- I know.

635
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:56,292
But you're both good men.
I can tell.

636
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:03,033
Very poetic.

637
00:46:03,357 --> 00:46:05,752
Poetic?
It's a water fountain.

638
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:10,631
Well, yeah, but look at the
way your dad took the photo.

639
00:46:10,777 --> 00:46:13,313
His shadow's on the
wall right next to you.

640
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:15,242
It's like he's always with you.

641
00:46:15,978 --> 00:46:17,623
I'd frame this one.

642
00:46:19,475 --> 00:46:22,151
<i>All this time the
answer was right here.

643
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:25,893
<i>Harry... photographer and
foster father extraordinaire.

644
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:30,033
<i>He is always with me,
and he's the common denominator.

645
00:46:30,218 --> 00:46:31,393
Rita...

646
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:34,932
you're a genius.

647
00:46:37,257 --> 00:46:39,741
<i>All those years of
smiling for the camera...

648
00:46:39,976 --> 00:46:44,973
<i>It was empty and fake,
the pictures meaningless, until now.

649
00:46:45,568 --> 00:46:47,400
<i>Pictures of Harry.

650
00:47:03,178 --> 00:47:07,173
So this is it.

651
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:08,380
It's cool.

652
00:47:09,725 --> 00:47:10,711
Cool.

653
00:47:11,956 --> 00:47:15,253
Dexter, this is the
place where my father,

654
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:18,782
your grandfather,
worked for 30 years.

655
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:20,842
He started out as the janitor,

656
00:47:20,985 --> 00:47:23,292
worked his way up to
chief of maintenance.

657
00:47:23,428 --> 00:47:26,150
This place put
food on our table.

658
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,362
In two weeks,
it'll all be shut down.

659
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:29,100
I know.

660
00:47:29,797 --> 00:47:32,281
Excuse me, miss! Miss?

661
00:47:32,568 --> 00:47:35,193
- Would you mind?
- Oh, come on, dad.

662
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:41,371
Hey, you all right?

663
00:47:41,566 --> 00:47:45,140
It's nothing.
Bad medianoches for lunch. I'm okay.

664
00:47:45,286 --> 00:47:47,773
I'm sorry, miss.
It's okay. Thanks.

665
00:47:47,955 --> 00:47:49,891
We're not gonna be needing a picture,
after all.

666
00:47:49,927 --> 00:47:50,760
Yeah, we are.

667
00:47:50,977 --> 00:47:52,911
Dex, I really don't feel
like doing this now.

668
00:47:52,947 --> 00:47:54,020
Don't be a baby --

669
00:47:54,256 --> 00:47:57,401
Being part of a family means
smiling for family photos, right?

670
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,801
<i>My friend left this.

671
00:48:10,037 --> 00:48:11,720
<i>He's showing me where to go.

672
00:48:13,575 --> 00:48:16,060
<i>Am I going because
it's what he wants

673
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:18,411
<i>or because that's what
Harry would want?

674
00:48:20,676 --> 00:48:22,791
<i>What do I want?

675
00:48:51,116 --> 00:48:54,680
<i>The hospital's shut down now,
abandoned for years,

676
00:48:54,876 --> 00:48:57,882
<i>but tonight it's
visiting hours again.

677
00:49:29,415 --> 00:49:30,911
Well, James...

678
00:49:32,905 --> 00:49:36,521
Why did you have to be such
a pain in the ass, huh?

679
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:43,630
Fuck !

680
00:49:43,868 --> 00:49:46,313
I didn't tell you
you could get up.

681
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:06,291
Please, please.

682
00:50:10,085 --> 00:50:11,912
Now you get up.

683
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:22,191
You traumatize my little
girl in church...

684
00:50:22,975 --> 00:50:26,981
break the knees of
my best turner.

685
00:50:29,566 --> 00:50:32,673
You're a wild dog, Sergeant.

686
00:50:34,345 --> 00:50:36,970
The only thing to do
with a wild dog...

687
00:50:37,716 --> 00:50:39,873
Police!
Hands in the air!

688
00:50:46,128 --> 00:50:48,421
Thought you could use backup.

689
00:50:48,608 --> 00:50:51,193
You could have filled me in,
man. Shit.

690
00:50:52,357 --> 00:50:55,640
Got you going after a
goddamn cop, motherfucker.

691
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,463
We own your ass now.

692
00:51:01,095 --> 00:51:02,743
So this was the
plan all along...

693
00:51:02,877 --> 00:51:05,552
To use me as bait to
bring down Guerrero?

694
00:51:06,528 --> 00:51:09,872
Yeah, and now my sister
can rest in peace.

695
00:51:10,475 --> 00:51:13,382
We're done now, Doakes.
We're even.

696
00:51:13,665 --> 00:51:16,103
I'll call this in,
bring the paramedics.

697
00:51:16,386 --> 00:51:18,533
Get this piece of
shit out of here.

698
00:51:55,877 --> 00:51:57,090
Please.

699
00:52:01,486 --> 00:52:02,841
Just do it.

700
00:52:05,846 --> 00:52:06,543
Kill me.

701
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:10,302
I'm ready.

702
00:52:22,165 --> 00:52:24,323
Just don't cut me anymore.

703
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:30,283
Please don't cut me anymore.

704
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:33,753
<i>Gift-wrapped and
begging for death.

705
00:52:33,898 --> 00:52:35,290
<i>Tools at the ready.

706
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:36,932
Just kill me.
It's okay.

707
00:52:37,168 --> 00:52:39,400
<i>He was left here so
I would kill him,

708
00:52:39,546 --> 00:52:42,883
<i>but my new friend doesn't see
me as clearly as he thinks.

709
00:52:43,858 --> 00:52:46,022
<i>I can't kill this man.

710
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,793
<i>Harry wouldn't want it.

711
00:52:48,868 --> 00:52:50,690
<i>And neither would I.

712
00:53:11,668 --> 00:53:12,593
Are you Morgan?

713
00:53:12,735 --> 00:53:14,660
Message came through
dispatch for you.

714
00:53:20,878 --> 00:53:22,610
Who left this?

715
00:53:24,216 --> 00:53:25,571
Who left it?!

716
00:53:36,356 --> 00:53:38,893
Jesus, stop that.
I'm getting bruises.

717
00:53:39,076 --> 00:53:40,482
I'm sorry.
I'm so excited.

718
00:53:40,715 --> 00:53:42,160
Try a hug once in a while.

719
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:47,423
I don't know who your
contacts are, Morgan,

720
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:49,061
but you are my up-and-comer.

721
00:53:49,257 --> 00:53:50,943
You saved a man's life tonight.

722
00:53:51,497 --> 00:53:53,612
I'm just the one who
got the call, Sir.

723
00:53:53,845 --> 00:53:55,713
But you followed it up.

724
00:53:55,817 --> 00:53:57,681
Right place at the
right time, Sir.

725
00:53:57,828 --> 00:54:00,173
- Where we at?
- Morgan's tip was good.

726
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:02,291
They're taking Tucci
over to county.

727
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:05,482
- Alive?
- Alive.

728
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:15,531
So, I suppose this gets Deb
off of surveillance-tape duty.

729
00:54:15,947 --> 00:54:19,002
Really?
Is that what you suppose?

730
00:54:19,188 --> 00:54:20,733
I got your page, Lieutenant.

731
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:22,710
Doakes is caught up
in the Guerrero bust.

732
00:54:22,745 --> 00:54:24,860
- You're taking point here.
- You got it.

733
00:54:25,005 --> 00:54:27,773
I'm tired of chasing this guy's shadow.
I want forensic evidence.

734
00:54:27,807 --> 00:54:31,212
I don't care if you have to tear
apart this building brick by brick.

735
00:54:31,247 --> 00:54:32,691
- Entiende?
- Si.

736
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:34,710
Use Morgan here.

737
00:54:40,508 --> 00:54:42,751
How did your wife like that necklace,
Angel?

738
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:44,412
Oh, you were right.
She loved it.

739
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:45,792
You nailed that one.

740
00:55:11,586 --> 00:55:15,352
<i>Everyone hides who they are,
at least some of the time.

741
00:55:19,377 --> 00:55:22,200
<i>Sometimes you bury that
part of yourself so deeply

742
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:25,820
<i>that you have to be
reminded it's there at all.

743
00:55:35,928 --> 00:55:39,220
Good work, man.
I told you we'd get that piss-poor...

744
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:47,510
<i>And sometimes you just want to
forget who you are altogether.

745
00:55:58,976 --> 00:56:00,901
<i>And what about me?

746
00:56:01,455 --> 00:56:05,081
<i>Maybe I'll never be the
human Harry wanted me to be.

747
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:08,690
<i>But I couldn't kill Tony Tucci.

748
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:11,553
<i>That's not me, either.

749
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,483
<i>My new friend thought I wouldn't be
able to resist the kill he left for me,

750
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:19,202
<i>but I did.

751
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:31,412
<i>I'm not the monster
he wants me to be.

752
00:56:31,545 --> 00:56:34,463
<i>So I'm neither man nor beast.

753
00:56:35,255 --> 00:56:38,021
<i>I'm something new entirely,

754
00:56:38,198 --> 00:56:40,633
<i>with my own set of rules.

755
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:50,183
<i>I'm Dexter.
