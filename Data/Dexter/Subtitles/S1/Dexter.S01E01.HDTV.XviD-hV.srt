00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,400
<i>Tonight's the night.

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,133
<i>And it's going to happen
again and again --

4
00:00:35,167 --> 00:00:38,000
<i>has to happen.

5
00:00:42,767 --> 00:00:44,934
<i>Nice night.

6
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:49,776
<i>Miami is a great town.
I love the Cuban food.

7
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:53,601
<i>Pork sandwiches -- my favorite.

8
00:01:00,234 --> 00:01:03,634
<i>But I'm hungry for
something different now.

9
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,567
<i>There he is -- Mike Donovan.

10
00:01:38,768 --> 00:01:41,000
<i>He's the one.

11
00:02:02,403 --> 00:02:05,505
You're mine now,
so do exactly as I say.

12
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,607
- What do you want?
- I want you to be quiet.

13
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:11,807
Now drive.

14
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,863
Turn here.

15
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,612
You have to listen...

16
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:16,072
...Do what I say.

17
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,873
- Look.
- No.

18
00:03:29,965 --> 00:03:31,452
Uh, yes.

19
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:34,892
No, no!

20
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:37,391
It's horrible, isn't it?
Isn't it?

21
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,131
Please...

22
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:44,063
Open your eyes and
look at what you did!

23
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:48,033
Look or I'll cut your
eyelids right off your face.

24
00:03:54,036 --> 00:03:57,661
It took me a long time to
get these little boys clean.

25
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,993
One of them had been in the ground
so long he was falling apart.

26
00:04:02,006 --> 00:04:04,220
I pulled him out
in bits and pieces.

27
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:06,801
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is --

28
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:09,213
Stop! That never
helped anybody.

29
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:15,060
Please, you can have anything.

30
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:18,063
That's good. Beg.
Did these little boys beg?

31
00:04:24,206 --> 00:04:26,982
I couldn't help myself.
I couldn't. I--

32
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:29,862
Please, you have to understand...

33
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:35,241
Trust me, I definitely understand.

34
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,283
See, I can't help myself, either.

35
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,452
Children, I could never do that.
Not like you.

36
00:04:43,476 --> 00:04:46,763
Never, ever kids.

37
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:49,053
Why?

38
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:52,603
I have standards.

39
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:21,813
Soon you'll be packed
into a few...

40
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:27,170
...neatly wrapped hefties

41
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:33,031
in my own small
corner of the world.

42
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:39,033
It'll be a neater,
happier place.

43
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:44,750
A better place.

44
00:06:07,566 --> 00:06:10,830
<i>My name is Dexter,
Dexter Morgan.

45
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:12,652
<i>I don't know what
made me the way I am,

46
00:06:12,756 --> 00:06:16,011
<i>but whatever it was left
a hollow place inside.

47
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:19,551
<i>People fake a lot of human
interactions,

48
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:22,842
<i> but I feel like I fake them all,
and I fake them very well.

49
00:06:22,857 --> 00:06:23,940
Ahoy !

50
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:27,973
Ahoy, there, captain!
Any big marlin out there today?

51
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,431
<i>And that's my burden, I guess.

52
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:33,131
<i>But I don't blame my
foster parents for that.

53
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,331
<i>Harry and Doris Morgan did
a wonderful job raising me.

54
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,632
<i>But they're both dead now.

55
00:06:40,405 --> 00:06:42,472
<i>I didn't kill them...

56
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:43,882
<i>Honest.

57
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:47,291
You're different, aren't you, Dexter?

58
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,751
What do you mean, pop?

59
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,063
The Billups say
Buddy disappeared.

60
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:56,952
I found the grave, son.

61
00:06:56,988 --> 00:06:59,133
That dog was a noisy
little creep, dad.

62
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:01,200
He was barking all night,
and mom couldn't sleep.

63
00:07:01,216 --> 00:07:03,791
And she's very, very sick,
and that lousy dog was yapping

64
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:05,981
at every leaf that blew
down the sidewalk!

65
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:08,293
There were a lot of
bones in there, Dexter,

66
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,823
and not just Buddy's.

67
00:07:28,966 --> 00:07:30,692
Hola, Dexter!

68
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:12,160
<i>Blood--

69
00:08:12,846 --> 00:08:15,463
<i>sometimes it sets
my teeth on edge.

70
00:08:18,138 --> 00:08:20,952
<i>Other times,
it helps me control the chaos.

71
00:08:22,966 --> 00:08:26,831
<i>The code of Harry,
my foster father, is satisfied.

72
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,492
<i>And so am I.

73
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:31,903
<i>Harry was a great
cop here in Miami.

74
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:35,402
<i>He taught me how to think like one,
taught me how to cover my tracks.

75
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:38,870
<i>I'm a very neat monster.

76
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:44,501
Dexter, are you there?

77
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:47,630
Okay, Dex, please,
as soon as you get in,

78
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:51,260
I'm at a crime scene by the
shithole the Seven Seas motel,

79
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:53,731
and I need you here.
Okay?

80
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:55,750
Dex?
Please...

81
00:08:55,756 --> 00:08:58,090
Pretty fucking please
with cheese on top.

82
00:08:58,136 --> 00:09:01,412
<i>That's my foul-mouthed
foster sister, Debra.

83
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:04,160
<i>She has a big heart but
won't let anyone see it.

84
00:09:04,246 --> 00:09:06,473
<i>She's the only person in
the world who loves me.

85
00:09:06,737 --> 00:09:08,442
<i>I think that's nice.

86
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,201
<i>I don't have feelings
about anything,

87
00:09:10,237 --> 00:09:13,163
<i>but if I could have feelings at all,
I'd have them for Deb.

88
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,502
<i>There's something
strange and disarming

89
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:23,562
<i>about looking at a homicide
scene in the daylight of Miami.

90
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:26,560
<i>It makes the most grotesque
killings look staged,

91
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:29,703
<i>like you're in a new and daring
section of Disney World --

92
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:31,543
<i>Dahmer Land*.

93
00:09:31,557 --> 00:09:32,823
You better be a cop.

94
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:34,240
No.
Forensics.

95
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:41,562
Dex!

96
00:09:43,236 --> 00:09:44,902
Hey, what's up?

97
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:50,790
Jeez, Deb...

98
00:09:50,865 --> 00:09:52,561
Where the hell do
you keep your gun?

99
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:54,452
They found another hooker,
in the pool.

100
00:09:54,475 --> 00:09:56,572
- Another?
- Chopped up in bits and pieces.

101
00:09:56,606 --> 00:10:00,013
- That's the third one in 5 months.
- Third? You mean there's a --

102
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:01,793
A serial killer, that's right.

103
00:10:01,807 --> 00:10:03,552
The other 2 were in Broward,

104
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,442
chopped up just like this one.

105
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:07,072
Any suspects?

106
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,952
Wish I knew.

107
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:11,413
I'm on Vice,
so Laguerta sent me to my room

108
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,772
and told me to stay out of sight.

109
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,390
God forbids she listens
to what you have to say.

110
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:16,993
Tell me about it.

111
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,731
How does someone so
dumb get so much power?

112
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:24,050
She knows how to play the game.
You could take a lesson.

113
00:10:24,267 --> 00:10:25,660
In what, ass-kissing?

114
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,223
Politics.

115
00:10:31,365 --> 00:10:35,021
I just want to catch this guy before
he kills another one of my girls.

116
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,162
- You can't get so emotionally invested.
- You always say that.

117
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:39,701
So did dad.

118
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:43,232
Yeah, but he also said,
"go after what you want."

119
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,643
I want out of Vice
and into Homicide.

120
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,012
What can I do to help?

121
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:53,372
You get these hunches, you know,
with these types of murders.

122
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:57,763
- Only sometimes.
- Well, see if you get one this time.

123
00:10:57,967 --> 00:10:59,570
And can I bounce some
ideas off of you later?

124
00:10:59,596 --> 00:11:01,501
You know I always get smarter
when I'm talking to you.

125
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,930
You just need a little
more confidence.

126
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,041
All right, I'll take a look.

127
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,883
In the meantime, avoid Laguerta
and talk to Captain Matthews.

128
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:17,343
He and dad were tight.
Maybe he'll put you on the case.

129
00:11:17,448 --> 00:11:19,830
You're making me
smarter already, see?

130
00:11:20,365 --> 00:11:22,703
And keep the sex suit on when
you talk to the Captain.

131
00:11:22,735 --> 00:11:24,211
It'll help your cause.

132
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:40,302
- That's a nice haircut, Masuoka.
- Saw your sister.

133
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:42,641
- Damn, looking hot.
- Yeah, she should.

134
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,312
It's hot as hell out here.

135
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:47,090
So... Why are you here?

136
00:11:47,436 --> 00:11:49,443
- It's a crime scene.
- Yeah.

137
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:51,000
- But you do blood spatter.
- So?

138
00:11:51,306 --> 00:11:53,591
So?...
There's no blood here.

139
00:11:54,736 --> 00:11:58,411
- What was that?
- Yeah. There's no blood in or on

140
00:11:58,506 --> 00:12:02,250
or near the body at all.
It's the weirdest thing you ever saw.

141
00:12:02,356 --> 00:12:04,392
Hey, Angel, let's show him.

142
00:12:04,405 --> 00:12:05,822
<i>No blood.

143
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:10,200
<i>No sticky, hot, messy, awful blood.
No blood at all.

144
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:15,035
<i>Why hadn't I thought of that?
No blood.

145
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,167
<i>What a beautiful idea!

146
00:12:19,201 --> 00:12:21,207
How is he doing ? How does the
killer get rid of the blood?

147
00:12:21,229 --> 00:12:24,650
It's hard to say.
The body's in good shape.

148
00:12:24,838 --> 00:12:27,181
She got a nice ass, too.

149
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:30,232
Head is over there,
if you want to take a look.

150
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:33,030
- This is unique.
- No shit.

151
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:34,980
And no prints, either.

152
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:40,662
<i>I've never seen such clean,
dry, neat-looking dead flesh.

153
00:12:40,706 --> 00:12:41,751
<i>Wonderful.

154
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,451
Very clean.

155
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:46,312
Yeah, but he didn't finish.
No terminó.

156
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,613
- It looks pretty completo to me, Angel.
- No, no. Look.

157
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:54,212
He cut the leg in four pieces,
almost like using a ruler.

158
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:57,791
But this leg is
in three pieces.

159
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:03,403
Now, look, he started to make
a fourth cut but stopped.

160
00:13:03,435 --> 00:13:06,332
- It's possible he got interrupted.
- Laguerta's looking for a witness,

161
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,102
working on the motel
porter back there.

162
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,331
God help him.

163
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:13,562
<i>No blood.

164
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:15,930
<i>I can't think.
I have to get out of here.

165
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:20,580
Dex, ¿dónde va?
Where are you going?

166
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:24,202
Hey, no blood...
No trabajo.

167
00:13:34,866 --> 00:13:37,613
<i>I wish she'd stop that.
It's one of those mating rituals

168
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:40,000
<i>which I really
don't understand.

169
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:49,431
<i>But that bloodless body --

170
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:52,962
<i>this guy may have exceeded
my own abilities.

171
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,092
- Morning, Dex.
- Morning.

172
00:14:03,736 --> 00:14:06,932
- Hey, Dex.
- Hey, Sue. Dan.

173
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:12,230
- How are the families?
- Good. You?

174
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:15,813
- See you at the next bloodbath?
- Never miss a party.

175
00:14:16,237 --> 00:14:17,700
Thanks.

176
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:23,451
<i>Salt of the earth, these people,
and they work hard.

177
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:26,500
<i>But with the solve rate
for murders at about 20%,

178
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:31,332
<i>Miami is a great place for me,
a great place for me to hone my craft.

179
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:33,103
<i>Viva Miami.

180
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,762
Dex.

181
00:14:34,806 --> 00:14:38,903
- I like your other outfit better.
- You're a sick bastard. Guess what.

182
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,202
Sex suit worked.
Captain put me on the case.

183
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:44,401
Laguerta wasn't happy,
but she needs to get laid.

184
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:49,550
- I guess. So congrats!
- So you got any ideas yet?

185
00:14:49,575 --> 00:14:50,701
Nope.

186
00:14:51,566 --> 00:14:53,773
Well, start working on
your mental autopsy

187
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:57,001
'cause I could use your theories.
And thanks for the fucking doughnut.

188
00:14:57,036 --> 00:14:58,933
I got to go.

189
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:02,633
Doughnut?

190
00:15:06,536 --> 00:15:08,601
You keeping your
fingernails clean?

191
00:15:08,637 --> 00:15:10,763
Never leave home without
my rubber gloves.

192
00:15:10,806 --> 00:15:12,203
Good boy.

193
00:15:14,908 --> 00:15:16,831
So, anything new?

194
00:15:25,438 --> 00:15:27,131
One of these days
you're gonna tell me.

195
00:15:27,155 --> 00:15:28,221
I already told you.

196
00:15:28,238 --> 00:15:30,342
Blood spatter doesn't
take up all my time.

197
00:15:30,366 --> 00:15:33,962
I like doing it. Maybe I can help out.
It fills my nights.

198
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:38,002
- You have a morbid sense of fun.
- That's probably true.

199
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:43,330
- You should find a pretty girl.
- I found you.

200
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:48,600
Charming like your father.
Just don't get me fired.

201
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,440
Then who would I
bring doughnuts to?

202
00:15:56,337 --> 00:16:00,042
- Angel, ¿una más?
- Gracias.

203
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,481
De nada.

204
00:16:03,566 --> 00:16:05,822
<i>Just like me...

205
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:07,803
<i>Empty inside.

206
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:23,730
- Where the hell you been?
- Crime scene.

207
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,733
What about these?

208
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:28,633
The hotel cokehead murders,
this dealer and the girl?

209
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:31,900
Well, this hallmark-looking couple

210
00:16:31,967 --> 00:16:34,362
didn't die by the hands
of a professional.

211
00:16:35,365 --> 00:16:38,362
No, this is child's play.
Messy work --

212
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,973
All that blood on the walls
looks like a finger painting.

213
00:16:41,008 --> 00:16:44,003
You give me the fucking creeps,
you know that, Dexter?

214
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,032
Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

215
00:16:47,468 --> 00:16:51,461
- Fuck you.
- Okay.

216
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:53,302
Is there something I can do?

217
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:55,601
You can give me a fucking analysis
on the blood spatter on this killings.

218
00:16:55,645 --> 00:16:58,533
You think I'm here to invite
you to my nephew's bris?

219
00:16:58,838 --> 00:17:00,603
I didn't know you were Jewish.

220
00:17:00,637 --> 00:17:02,962
Shut the fuck up and
write your report already.

221
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,832
Don't even know why I need you.

222
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,011
Grab a crayon, psycho,
and scribble this down.

223
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:08,992
Rival dealer came in.
Two scumbags slashed to hell,

224
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,932
dealer stole the drugs.

225
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:14,233
Wham, bam, done.
And I don't give a shit what you say

226
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,773
because that's what happened
and that's who I'm looking for.

227
00:17:16,805 --> 00:17:20,633
Hey, we are looking for a
motherfucking thief dealer.

228
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:24,461
- You got it?
- Okay. Sure.

229
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:29,102
I guess.
But I should get over there.

230
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,070
Then get over there already,
you fucking weirdo.

231
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:36,230
- I need it quick.
- I'm on it, sergeant.

232
00:17:39,866 --> 00:17:43,782
<i>The only real question I have is why,
in a building full of cops,

233
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:47,433
<i>all supposedly with a keen
insight into the human soul,

234
00:17:47,468 --> 00:17:52,602
<i>is Doakes the only one who
gets the creeps from me?

235
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:58,141
- So this killer used a sword?
- No.

236
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:01,490
Probably a very sharp knife.

237
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:05,333
Look at the blood spatter.
Look at the patterns.

238
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:06,762
It tells a story.

239
00:18:06,807 --> 00:18:08,402
You see this big pond
of blood right there?

240
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:10,360
That's from the initial stab.

241
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:13,663
The male victim was
standing right here,

242
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:16,630
and the killer plunged his
knife into the shoulder,

243
00:18:16,665 --> 00:18:19,003
severing the carotid artery,
and -- blpph

244
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,272
- Notice the long, thick, heavy drips?
- Yeah, nice.

245
00:18:22,308 --> 00:18:25,901
Now, over here, you have nice,
clean sprays of blood,

246
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:27,660
that can only happen when
you're holding something light

247
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:30,720
and moving quick --
nice, sharp slices through the body.

248
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:35,450
No splashes, no drips.
Clean and easy.

249
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,830
This guy knew how to use a blade.

250
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,370
So we're looking for a sushi chef.

251
00:18:44,746 --> 00:18:46,333
Yeah, sushi chef is possible.

252
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:50,260
Wouldn't be my first choice,
but, hey, you never know.

253
00:18:51,438 --> 00:18:54,163
- Now what?
- Now I eat!

254
00:18:54,205 --> 00:18:56,333
<i>The problem with
eating and driving,

255
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,632
<i>which I love to do,
is not being able to employ

256
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:00,732
<i>the 10:00-2:00 hand
position on the wheel.

257
00:19:00,768 --> 00:19:03,903
<i>It's a matter of public safety.

258
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:07,740
<i>But there's always a sacrifice.

259
00:19:13,406 --> 00:19:17,830
<i>This guy, Jamie Jaworski.

260
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,233
<i>Six months ago, I think he fell
in love with a pretty brunette,

261
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:23,500
<i>Mrs. Jane Saunders --

262
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,163
<i>A sweet mother of two married
to a successful banker --

263
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:30,801
<i>All living a pleasant life until she,
unfortunately, disappeared,

264
00:19:30,865 --> 00:19:34,862
<i>leaving the kids emotionally
devastated forever.

265
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:40,860
<i>The cops arrested
my favorite valet,

266
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:44,131
<i>but his lawyer got him off
on a faulty search warrant.

267
00:19:47,868 --> 00:19:50,701
<i>It's a good thing I
don't bother with them.

268
00:20:42,568 --> 00:20:46,902
<i>Animals don't like me,
especially dogs.

269
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:48,763
<i>I don't think they approve

270
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:51,732
<i>of what I sometimes
do to their masters.

271
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:57,201
<i>That dog recognizes me as easily
as I can recognize Jaworski

272
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:59,702
<i>or any other killer.

273
00:21:23,207 --> 00:21:26,502
<i>Interesting taste
in literature.

274
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:29,831
<i>His needs are evolving,
turning violent.

275
00:21:29,866 --> 00:21:32,963
<i>He's on the fast track.

276
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:36,102
Have you ever wanted
to kill anything else?

277
00:21:36,137 --> 00:21:39,563
You know,
something bigger than a dog?

278
00:21:41,607 --> 00:21:46,232
- Yes.
- Like a person?

279
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:49,062
Yeah, but no one in particular.

280
00:21:51,235 --> 00:21:53,560
Why didn't you?

281
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:58,433
I thought you and
mom wouldn't like it.

282
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:09,863
Come here.

283
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:21,702
<i>Friday night.
Date night in Miami.

284
00:22:22,105 --> 00:22:24,200
<i>Every night is
a date night in Miami,

285
00:22:24,265 --> 00:22:27,002
<i>and everyone's having sex.

286
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:30,091
<i>But for me, sex never
enters into it.

287
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:32,003
<i>I don't understand sex.

288
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:35,110
<i>Not that I have
anything against women,

289
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:37,401
<i>and I certainly have an
appropriate sensibility about men,

290
00:22:37,427 --> 00:22:41,072
<i>but when it comes to
the actual act of sex,

291
00:22:41,416 --> 00:22:44,411
<i>it's always just seemed so...

292
00:22:45,355 --> 00:22:47,402
<i>undignified.

293
00:22:48,736 --> 00:22:50,288
<i>But I have to play the game.

294
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:52,761
<i>And after years of
trying to look normal,

295
00:22:52,795 --> 00:22:55,361
<i>I think I met the
right woman for me.

296
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,701
<i>Deb saved her life on a
domestic-dispute call,

297
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,200
<i>introduced us,

298
00:23:00,248 --> 00:23:02,981
<i>and we've been dating
for six months now.

299
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:08,600
<i>She's perfect because Rita is,
in her own way, as damaged as me.

300
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:11,002
I'm running late.
I'll just be a sec.

301
00:23:11,168 --> 00:23:14,653
- I have to change.
- Okeydoke.

302
00:23:21,007 --> 00:23:22,530
Hi, Dexter.

303
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:25,533
May I say that you look
lovely this evening?

304
00:23:25,565 --> 00:23:27,331
Okay.

305
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:32,103
Master Cody, handsome as ever.
High five.

306
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:41,732
Do the space shuttle.

307
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:49,563
Vanilla... Chocolate,
and strawberry.

308
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:53,002
- No coffee?
- Which one do you think melts faster?

309
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,761
Ready?

310
00:23:56,925 --> 00:23:59,020
<i>Rita's ex-hubby,
the crack addict,

311
00:23:59,107 --> 00:24:03,033
<i>repeatedly raped her,
knocked her around.

312
00:24:03,065 --> 00:24:07,961
<i>Ever since then, she's been
completely uninterested in sex.

313
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:11,092
<i>That works for me.

314
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:13,482
Will you be back?

315
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:16,500
- Of course I'll be back.
- I meant Dexter.

316
00:24:16,837 --> 00:24:19,521
- You'll be asleep.
- No, I won't.

317
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,300
Then I'll stop in and
we'll all play cards.

318
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:22,763
Texas Hold 'em?

319
00:24:24,408 --> 00:24:26,963
Give mommy a kiss.

320
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,902
- Ready?
- Yeah.

321
00:24:43,435 --> 00:24:46,403
<i>Needless to say,
I have some unusual habits,

322
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,402
<i>yet all these socially
acceptable people

323
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:51,882
<i>can't wait to pick up hammers and
publicly smash their food to bits.

324
00:24:54,235 --> 00:25:00,132
<i>Normal people are so hostile...
But not her.

325
00:25:20,836 --> 00:25:22,600
Where are we going?

326
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:25,861
They might need me.

327
00:25:29,766 --> 00:25:32,800
Just stay right there.
I'll be right back.

328
00:25:54,807 --> 00:25:58,931
- Son of a whore.
- Who?

329
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:01,662
Talking about this hijo de puta,
this asshole killer,

330
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:04,783
this maricón savage who makes
us work on a Friday night.

331
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:08,262
Only Mondays through Thursdays --
that's what I always say.

332
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:12,711
Of course, coño, be reasonable.
Who wants to work on a Friday night?

333
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:14,833
I have my needs.

334
00:26:17,206 --> 00:26:19,501
So, ¿cómo estás?
What are you doing here?

335
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,261
I was in the neighborhood.
I'm on a date.

336
00:26:22,308 --> 00:26:26,363
- A date? Nice.
- Same guy, same pattern.

337
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:31,331
Bone dry. No blood again.
Pero mira esto.

338
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:33,800
There's some small differences
in the cuts this time.

339
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:37,463
Over here -- rough,
almost emotion.

340
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:40,531
Then over here,
not so much.

341
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:44,451
- And then over here -- clean.
- Muy bien.

342
00:26:44,668 --> 00:26:47,102
Yeah, nice.
But look at this.

343
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:49,760
All bone.

344
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:53,660
The killer flayed the skin,
the flesh, completely off.

345
00:26:53,708 --> 00:26:57,053
- Now, why would he do that?
- He's experimenting.

346
00:26:57,135 --> 00:26:58,733
He's trying to
find the right way.

347
00:26:58,768 --> 00:27:01,961
Is he experimenting
with the head, too?

348
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:03,501
What do you mean?

349
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,260
La bestia left her tits
and took her fucking head.

350
00:27:06,308 --> 00:27:08,701
I don't find anyone
around here.

351
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:10,472
And God only knows what
he's doing with it.

352
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:13,403
<i>He's certainly
raising the bar. Damn!

353
00:27:13,835 --> 00:27:15,960
<i>This guy is good.

354
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:21,902
- Will they catch him soon?
- I doubt it.

355
00:27:24,365 --> 00:27:26,960
The killer is an artist.

356
00:27:27,907 --> 00:27:30,442
What do you mean?

357
00:27:31,307 --> 00:27:34,331
His technique...

358
00:27:35,507 --> 00:27:36,963
is incredible.

359
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:46,712
I'm sorry.
I don't think I want to.

360
00:27:47,345 --> 00:27:51,260
I mean, I'm --
I'm not ready.

361
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:55,002
Damn it, Dexter.

362
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:58,391
<i>What have I done now ?

363
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:03,670
<i>And why can't I get that neat stack
of body parts out of my head?

364
00:28:04,468 --> 00:28:07,161
<i>No blood.

365
00:28:07,805 --> 00:28:11,542
Why did I touch her that way?

366
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:14,750
<i>I need to get back to my work.

367
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:20,261
<i>Jaworski's website,
"scream-bitch-scream" --

368
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:23,531
<i>the mother of all rape sites.

369
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:42,260
<i>That's it.
He's definitely the one.

370
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:45,681
<i>Now it's just a matter of time

371
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:49,913
<i>before he becomes a drop of blood
in my glass-slide collection.

372
00:28:50,805 --> 00:28:52,601
<i>But I have to wait.

373
00:28:52,636 --> 00:28:55,403
<i>I have to be careful

374
00:28:55,508 --> 00:28:57,960
<i>and follow the code of Harry.

375
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,260
Hey, dad.

376
00:29:14,136 --> 00:29:16,482
- I can explain.
- You and I had an understanding.

377
00:29:16,508 --> 00:29:19,362
Whenever you get an urge,
you come to me,

378
00:29:19,407 --> 00:29:21,252
you tell me,
and we deal with it together.

379
00:29:21,296 --> 00:29:23,550
- I do tell you, dad.
- The hell you do!

380
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:27,823
- There's blood on this knife.
- Animals. I find animals, that's all.

381
00:29:27,858 --> 00:29:30,470
Are you sure?
Are you telling me the truth?

382
00:29:30,536 --> 00:29:32,083
Yes!

383
00:29:32,286 --> 00:29:34,833
I thought we had
this under control.

384
00:29:43,168 --> 00:29:46,331
You still don't remember
anything from before,

385
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:49,763
- you know, before we took you in?
- No.

386
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:54,233
Is that why I have these urges?

387
00:29:57,005 --> 00:30:00,270
What happened changed
something inside you.

388
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:03,762
It got into you too early.

389
00:30:04,307 --> 00:30:07,400
I'm afraid your urge to kill
is only gonna get stronger.

390
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:10,201
You're saying I'll be
like this forever.

391
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:15,300
You're a good kid, Dex.
You are.

392
00:30:16,435 --> 00:30:19,573
Otherwise, it would have been
a lot worse than animals.

393
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:25,160
Okay?
We can't stop this.

394
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:27,763
But maybe...

395
00:30:29,935 --> 00:30:34,600
We can do something
to channel it.

396
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:40,523
- Use it for good.
- How could it ever be good?

397
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:43,730
Son, there are people out
there who do really bad things.

398
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:50,131
Terrible people.
And the police can't catch them all.

399
00:30:53,336 --> 00:30:57,320
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

400
00:30:57,428 --> 00:31:01,300
You're saying
they deserve it.

401
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,700
That's right.

402
00:31:04,338 --> 00:31:07,293
But, of course,
you have to learn how to spot them,

403
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:12,113
how to cover your tracks.

404
00:31:12,735 --> 00:31:15,001
But I can teach you.

405
00:31:16,505 --> 00:31:19,901
- Dad...
- It's okay, Dex.

406
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:25,460
You can't help what happened to you,
but you can make the best of it.

407
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:30,463
Remember this forever --
you are my son,

408
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:34,160
you are not alone,
and you are loved.

409
00:31:36,515 --> 00:31:38,653
Okay.

410
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:42,031
<i>Preparation is vital.

411
00:31:42,057 --> 00:31:44,601
<i>No detail can be overlooked.

412
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:52,833
<i>And the ritual is intoxicating.

413
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:04,032
<i>Duct tape...

414
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:06,451
<i>Rubber sheets...

415
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:10,633
<i>Necessary tools of the trade.

416
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:17,501
You can't bullshit me, Dex.
Help me out.

417
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:19,703
Laguerta has me
interviewing hookers.

418
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:22,081
It's a waste of time.

419
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:27,640
Deb, if he was
interrupted... Think.

420
00:32:28,968 --> 00:32:30,583
Jesus Christ, right.

421
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:33,352
Because then how do you have
time to wrap all the pieces?

422
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:36,440
She's dumber than the boat people.
Throw her a fucking raft.

423
00:32:36,507 --> 00:32:39,470
But now we have a fourth body,
and the cuts were different.

424
00:32:39,578 --> 00:32:42,883
And that's telling us a story.
The ritual is changing.

425
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:47,302
He's looking for some kind of
inspiration and not finding it.

426
00:32:47,338 --> 00:32:49,403
So he keeps doing it
until he gets it right.

427
00:32:49,436 --> 00:32:51,061
I could be wrong.

428
00:32:52,807 --> 00:32:55,730
So how the hell was your
date with Rita last night?

429
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,002
Great.

430
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:58,973
You should try it sometime.
You need a life.

431
00:32:59,005 --> 00:33:03,252
Well, find me a guy I can trust.
I need a transfer to Homicide, bro,

432
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:04,823
then we'll see about a life.

433
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:05,961
I understand that.

434
00:33:05,987 --> 00:33:07,600
It certainly would sound
better for the kids to say,

435
00:33:07,615 --> 00:33:09,252
"mommy's on Homicide."

436
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:12,703
- Don't make me hit you.
- Come on.

437
00:33:13,405 --> 00:33:16,261
Then we could talk about more
little Morgans, nephews and nieces.

438
00:33:16,305 --> 00:33:19,912
- What's wrong with that?
- You sound like mom.

439
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:24,300
I just -- tell me what you know
about cell crystallization.

440
00:33:24,756 --> 00:33:27,181
- What do you mean?
- I heard the coroner say it last night.

441
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:30,842
He was talking about
that dead... headless chick.

442
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:34,990
- You got that look in your eye.
- I was there before you,

443
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:38,801
and I noticed this body looked
different than the other ones.

444
00:33:39,256 --> 00:33:41,183
The pieces were cold.

445
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:44,232
But meat-packing cold.

446
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:47,003
Is that what cell
crystallization means?

447
00:33:47,037 --> 00:33:50,312
<i>My god, why didn't I think of that?
It's beautiful.

448
00:33:50,316 --> 00:33:53,860
Dex.
What are you thinking?

449
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:57,761
Sorry.
That makes sense.

450
00:33:57,806 --> 00:33:59,661
Cold.

451
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,200
It slows the flow of blood.

452
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,201
Why the hell is that important?

453
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:11,411
- It's just a feeling.
- That's not good enough.

454
00:34:12,205 --> 00:34:15,830
I got to show Laguerta and her boys.
They're making fun of me.

455
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,532
They're saying the only way
I can close a case is on my back.

456
00:34:20,096 --> 00:34:24,533
I got to get out of Vice.
Dex, please, you got to --

457
00:34:24,565 --> 00:34:26,233
Refrigerated truck.

458
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:30,293
What the fuck are
you talking about?

459
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,352
A refrigerated truck.

460
00:34:34,335 --> 00:34:37,403
He wants a cold environment

461
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,280
to slow the flow of blood,

462
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:45,780
clean and mobile so he can
dump the garbage afterwards.

463
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:48,792
So I'm looking for a
refrigerated truck now?

464
00:34:48,818 --> 00:34:51,452
Probably a stolen one.

465
00:34:52,606 --> 00:34:55,650
You think there are a lot
of stolen trucks out there?

466
00:34:55,768 --> 00:34:59,331
Are you nuts?
In Miami?

467
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:05,402
Choir... kids... Just
do something.

468
00:35:05,516 --> 00:35:07,501
Just find my husband.

469
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:10,612
Ma'am, the detectives are
looking into everything.

470
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,330
<i>I'm pretty sure I
covered all my tracks.

471
00:35:14,368 --> 00:35:18,962
- What do you care about that woman?
- I don't. I was just --

472
00:35:19,066 --> 00:35:22,191
You like when women cry?
You like that?

473
00:35:22,507 --> 00:35:24,102
What's your thing, psycho?

474
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:25,870
I was just heading to
the briefing room.

475
00:35:25,906 --> 00:35:27,850
You got no call to be in there,
so flee.

476
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:30,730
Lieutenant, this fucking
guy doesn't belong.

477
00:35:30,765 --> 00:35:32,390
I'm still waiting for
his spatter report

478
00:35:32,405 --> 00:35:35,330
on the cokehead murders --
Go do that.

479
00:35:35,365 --> 00:35:37,562
It's okay.
I don't want to upset anybody.

480
00:35:37,608 --> 00:35:40,553
He can stay.
I'd like your input,

481
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:43,113
and we'll discuss your
case after the meeting.

482
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:45,700
How about we get started?

483
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:48,571
- ¿Encontráste algo?
- Nada todavía.

484
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:51,011
- Hazme un favor y quítate la gorra.
- Discúlpame.

485
00:35:59,735 --> 00:36:03,601
- You ready?
- I'm gonna shame this bitch.

486
00:36:03,637 --> 00:36:06,783
Just state your case clean and easy.
You'll be the hero.

487
00:36:06,837 --> 00:36:09,930
Okay, settle down.

488
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:12,500
Now, has anyone tracked
down that witness?

489
00:36:15,206 --> 00:36:18,763
Come on, people.
Someone needs to find something here.

490
00:36:18,906 --> 00:36:23,151
- Lieutenant Laguerta?
- Officer Morgan.

491
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:25,353
I didn't recognize you
with your clothes on.

492
00:36:27,408 --> 00:36:31,963
I have an idea,
something in a different direction.

493
00:36:32,508 --> 00:36:33,961
An idea?

494
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:37,740
Well, please, share it with us.

495
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:45,573
- Cell crystallization.
- Excuse me?

496
00:36:45,606 --> 00:36:48,121
A little more confidence,
please.

497
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,303
On the last victim,

498
00:36:51,336 --> 00:36:53,773
I'd like to check and see
if any refrigerated trucks

499
00:36:53,805 --> 00:36:58,681
have been stolen in
the last... week or so.

500
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:02,520
Refrigerated trucks
like ice-cream trucks?

501
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:08,830
No, not ice-cream trucks.

502
00:37:08,866 --> 00:37:10,331
A refrigerated vehicle

503
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,830
that could cause that
kind of tissue damage,

504
00:37:12,868 --> 00:37:15,650
a refrigerated truck that's...

505
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:19,061
...mobile so he'll be
harder to catch,

506
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:24,431
a refrigerated truck that
might give us a lead.

507
00:37:27,596 --> 00:37:30,451
That's very interesting,
very creative.

508
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:32,183
Let's keep looking
for the witness, okay?

509
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:34,501
We know that he or she is out there.
The forensic evidence,

510
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,673
the interrupted cut proves
that there was an eyewitness.

511
00:37:36,705 --> 00:37:39,163
Now, somebody out
there saw something,

512
00:37:39,206 --> 00:37:41,713
so let's concentrate on
finding that person, okay?

513
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:42,362
But --

514
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,113
Just keep talking
to all your hookers.

515
00:37:46,607 --> 00:37:49,103
That's all for today.

516
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:59,413
What the fuck was I supposed to say?
The only reason I'm in here

517
00:37:59,537 --> 00:38:01,723
is because the captain said
they had to let me in.

518
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:04,392
But he didn't say they
had to listen to you.

519
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:05,801
Well, right again.

520
00:38:05,846 --> 00:38:08,732
So say adiós to my career.
I'm gonna die a meter maid.

521
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:12,543
Stop it. Deb, there's another way.
Find the truck.

522
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:21,332
Excuse me, Dexter...
My office, please.

523
00:38:28,468 --> 00:38:30,660
What the hell?

524
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:36,161
What the fuck?

525
00:38:37,617 --> 00:38:40,201
Are you boning her?

526
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:42,693
- No.
- Oh, my god!

527
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,512
- Deb, wait.
- Shut up.

528
00:38:49,066 --> 00:38:50,802
It had nothing to
do with drugs.

529
00:38:50,836 --> 00:38:52,901
L.T., this is a waste
of our damn time.

530
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:54,681
I think sergeant
Doakes is right.

531
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:56,931
I read the other reports,
all the other forensic analysis.

532
00:38:56,966 --> 00:39:00,170
Everyone agrees the cokehead murders
had nothing to do with cocaine.

533
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:01,930
It was a crime of passion.

534
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:04,652
The murderer came to kill
the woman, not the dealer.

535
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:06,001
He did him quick and
got him out of the way.

536
00:39:06,038 --> 00:39:08,573
But he sure as hell took his
sweet time slicing up that lady,

537
00:39:08,606 --> 00:39:11,003
and you don't do that
unless you have a close,

538
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:15,753
personal relationship with someone.
Probably an ex-boyfriend.

539
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:17,901
That's who I'd look for.

540
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:22,080
Okay.

541
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:26,493
It's a bit of a push, but,
sergeant, you should check it out.

542
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:37,203
I'm watching you, motherfucker.

543
00:39:50,536 --> 00:39:52,962
<i>Jaworski's been coming
here for weeks --

544
00:39:53,005 --> 00:39:55,561
<i>likes to steal all
the copper plumbing.

545
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:58,093
<i>There's good money in that.

546
00:39:58,905 --> 00:40:02,400
<i>No security guards --
that's good.

547
00:41:06,566 --> 00:41:08,581
- Fuck!
- Talk.

548
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:11,382
- What do you mean?
- I think you know what I mean.

549
00:41:11,405 --> 00:41:15,010
No. Oh, god.

550
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:17,850
Talk to me about Jane Saunders.

551
00:41:18,465 --> 00:41:20,930
Okay.
I did her.

552
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:24,612
- How?
- In a movie -- snuff film.

553
00:41:24,636 --> 00:41:28,330
- But I'm not sorry.
- Of course not.

554
00:41:29,508 --> 00:41:32,402
No, I'm not sorry, either.

555
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:59,963
- Hello?
- Hey. I'm -- I'm sorry.

556
00:42:00,008 --> 00:42:03,133
I mean,
I'm sorry about the other night,

557
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:09,013
but... look, Dex, I really,
really need to see you.

558
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:13,932
So can you --
can you come by later,

559
00:42:13,968 --> 00:42:16,263
you know, just for,
like, a little while?

560
00:42:16,307 --> 00:42:18,701
I mean, I'm really --

561
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:23,133
All right.
What are you doing now?

562
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:25,461
I'm just finishing
up a little project,

563
00:42:25,507 --> 00:42:27,912
but I'll come by later.

564
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:30,192
Okay, bye.

565
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:47,532
<i>All in all,
it was a good night.

566
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:51,430
<i>One less amateur filmmaker
polluting the internet.

567
00:43:23,038 --> 00:43:25,072
No way !

568
00:45:00,568 --> 00:45:02,800
Give us a minute.

569
00:45:03,338 --> 00:45:05,863
Hanging in there?

570
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:08,713
This will teach me to tailgate.

571
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:10,701
Let's go over this again.

572
00:45:10,736 --> 00:45:14,600
- I'm all yours.
- So all the ice trucks in Miami --

573
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:18,732
- bit of a coincidence, don't you think?
- Sure, during business hours.

574
00:45:18,908 --> 00:45:21,402
But this time of night,
a truck like that sticks out.

575
00:45:21,438 --> 00:45:23,303
And you followed it.

576
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:25,953
That's right.

577
00:45:25,968 --> 00:45:30,281
- You never saw the driver?
- Just high beams and a flying head.

578
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:35,003
So then he must have already had
the head with him in the front seat.

579
00:45:35,307 --> 00:45:38,331
That's weird.
Why would he keep it there?

580
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,930
I don't know,
so he could use a carpool lane?

581
00:45:44,806 --> 00:45:48,601
It just seems odd.
Your sister has this ice-truck theory,

582
00:45:48,706 --> 00:45:51,303
and then here you
are to back it up.

583
00:45:51,336 --> 00:45:54,230
She's good, lieutenant.
You should give her a chance.

584
00:45:54,568 --> 00:45:57,633
You know,
you should call me Maria.

585
00:45:57,716 --> 00:46:01,100
But I'll tell you who's good --
you are.

586
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:04,161
Doakes picked up the killer
in the cokehead murders.

587
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:07,243
You were right.
It was her boyfriend.

588
00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:10,050
Of course, Doakes
still hates you.

589
00:46:10,427 --> 00:46:11,953
Of course.

590
00:46:15,035 --> 00:46:17,610
Tell me, Dexter,

591
00:46:17,648 --> 00:46:20,203
how did you get
to be so smart?

592
00:46:22,807 --> 00:46:25,483
Lots of sleep.

593
00:46:28,608 --> 00:46:30,851
Is it okay if I fill out
that report tomorrow?

594
00:46:32,465 --> 00:46:35,533
Sure thing.
You're tired.

595
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:41,560
- Good night, lieutenant.
- I'll catch you later.

596
00:46:56,065 --> 00:47:00,111
Dex.
It's been a while.

597
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:04,131
- I'm sorry.
- I was worried.

598
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:07,360
I didn't know what to do.
I called in sick.

599
00:47:08,038 --> 00:47:10,163
I mean...

600
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:16,082
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I was just --

601
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:19,831
I'm sorry.
There was another... You know.

602
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:32,402
Look... The kids
slept over next door.

603
00:47:33,488 --> 00:47:35,462
Okay.

604
00:47:36,325 --> 00:47:41,233
- Would you like to come in?
- Okay.

605
00:47:41,268 --> 00:47:43,233
Okay.

606
00:47:55,835 --> 00:47:58,531
I don't want to lose you, Dex.

607
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:03,103
Okay, sure.

608
00:48:05,168 --> 00:48:11,330
And... well... I want you.

609
00:48:11,866 --> 00:48:13,533
I mean...

610
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:26,231
Okay.
Thanks.

611
00:48:27,915 --> 00:48:30,200
You're welcome.

612
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:54,533
- Do you mind?
- No.

613
00:49:08,805 --> 00:49:13,593
- It could be the kids.
- Better get it, then.

614
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:20,030
Hello?

615
00:49:20,406 --> 00:49:22,431
Cody.

616
00:49:22,467 --> 00:49:24,261
Cody, stop crying, sweetie.

617
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:30,363
All right.
I'll come get you.

618
00:49:33,168 --> 00:49:37,263
Cody just threw up all
over Colleen's couch.

619
00:49:38,668 --> 00:49:41,502
I got to go get him.

620
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:50,923
- Tell me we're okay.
- Better than.

621
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:55,931
- Okay.
- Go be a good mom.

622
00:50:14,538 --> 00:50:16,901
<i>Okay, that was close.

623
00:50:19,337 --> 00:50:22,603
<i>I'll admit,
making out with Rita was...

624
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:24,900
<i>Interesting.

625
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:26,993
<i>But if I don't keep a lid on this,

626
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:28,692
<i>it could be the end of us.

627
00:50:51,906 --> 00:50:56,411
<i>I suppose I should be upset,
even feel violated,

628
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,843
<i>but I'm not.

629
00:50:59,145 --> 00:51:01,522
<i>No.

630
00:51:01,556 --> 00:51:03,280
<i>In fact,
I think this is a friendly message,

631
00:51:03,305 --> 00:51:06,732
<i>kind of like,
"hey, want to play?"

632
00:51:07,436 --> 00:51:10,733
<i>And, yes, I want to play.

633
00:51:10,965 --> 00:51:13,041
<i>I really, really do.

634
