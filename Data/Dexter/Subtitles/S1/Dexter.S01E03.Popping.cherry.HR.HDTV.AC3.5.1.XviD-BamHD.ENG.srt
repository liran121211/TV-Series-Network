00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,644
<i>Previously on "Dexter"...

3
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:51,465
What happened changed
something inside you, Dex.

4
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,432
It got into you too early.

5
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:56,020
I'm afraid your urge to kill
is only gonna get stronger.

6
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,610
I want to catch this guy before
he kills another one of my girls.

7
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:00,061
What can I do to help?

8
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:03,500
<i>No blood.
What a beautiful idea.

9
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,260
Refrigerated truck.

10
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:10,340
He wants a cold environment
to slow the flow of blood.

11
00:02:11,403 --> 00:02:15,025
<i>I suppose I should be upset,
even feel violated,

12
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,347
<i>but I'm not.

13
00:02:17,751 --> 00:02:20,587
<i>In fact,
I think this is a friendly message,

14
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:23,110
<i>kind of like, "hey,
want to play?"

15
00:02:23,467 --> 00:02:26,431
Finding that truck is your
golden ticket into Homicide.

16
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:29,393
So Miami's the haystack,
and the ice truck's the needle.

17
00:02:29,415 --> 00:02:31,323
I just found the
fucking needle.

18
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:35,792
Oh, this is seriously fucked up,
my friends.

19
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:38,032
<i>I think he's trying
to impress me...

20
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,072
<i>...and it's working.

21
00:02:40,108 --> 00:02:43,202
The Captain believes you should be
reassigned from Vice to Homicide.

22
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:44,843
Thank you, sir.

23
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:51,843
<i>Rita is, in her own way,
as damaged as me.

24
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:58,570
- Are you gonna kiss him?
- Actually, yes.

25
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:02,350
We just got an I.D. on the body
from under the causeway.

26
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:05,450
His name is Ricky Simmons.
He was a cop.

27
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:10,100
They told me Ricky Simmons was under
deep cover in Carlos Guerrero's family.

28
00:03:10,197 --> 00:03:12,262
Guerrero's crossing
a whole new line.

29
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:15,641
Now he's gone and pissed off the
entire Miami police department.

30
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:21,120
It's me. It's James, okay?
It's okay.

31
00:03:21,677 --> 00:03:26,433
Was Kara sleeping with someone
other than Ricky? Was it you?

32
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:30,802
James, she died.

33
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:47,152
Miami's full of good cops,
a lot of them here today.

34
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:52,213
But no offense -- I wouldn't want
any of you hitting on my sister.

35
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,361
Ricky was different.

36
00:03:54,657 --> 00:03:57,642
He was the kind of guy you hoped
your sister would fall for.

37
00:03:57,745 --> 00:03:59,910
<i>Most people have a hard
time dealing with death,

38
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,490
<i>but I'm not most people.

39
00:04:01,527 --> 00:04:04,170
<i>It's the grief that
makes me uncomfortable.

40
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,133
<i>Not because I'm a killer --

41
00:04:06,235 --> 00:04:09,333
<i>Really. I just don't
understand all that emotion,

42
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,912
<i>which makes it tough to fake.

43
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,871
<i>In those cases,
shades come in handy.

44
00:04:15,705 --> 00:04:16,542
Mac.

45
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,682
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thanks, man.

46
00:04:21,778 --> 00:04:23,410
It's a fucking travesty.

47
00:04:23,536 --> 00:04:27,110
- You going after Guerrero?
- Guerrero ordered these hits.

48
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:30,111
I'm gonna make something stick
to that cartel cocksucker.

49
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:32,671
I didn't know you and
Ricky were so tight.

50
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,672
Ain't about that.
Fuck with a cop,

51
00:04:34,695 --> 00:04:36,631
you lose the privilege
to walk the streets.

52
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:38,631
- I'm not right?
- You're right.

53
00:04:38,838 --> 00:04:42,112
...tragic loss of our fellow officer.
But we praise his courage.

54
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:44,020
Ricky knew no fear.

55
00:04:44,466 --> 00:04:47,212
People believe Laguerta?
She didn't even know Simmons.

56
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:48,791
She knew he was a cop.

57
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:50,873
Wait.
Did you tell her?

58
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:54,961
Proud of you for coming, bro.
I know you hate funerals.

59
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:57,430
- How you holding up?
- I'm managing.

60
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,981
<i>No, I'm not.
Keeping one's face pinched in sorrow

61
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:02,361
<i>for two hours straight
is a real chore.

62
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,511
<i>A whole life reduced to ashes.

63
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:09,373
<i>For Ricky Simmons, it's over.

64
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,253
<i>But sometimes,
you get a second chance.

65
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:18,492
<i>Florida prisons kick free
25,000 inmates a year.

66
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:22,110
<i>They don't do that for me,
but it sure feels like it.

67
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:25,000
<i>I search for the ones who
think they've beat the system.

68
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,782
<i>They're not hard to find,
like Jeremy Downs.

69
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,471
<i>Jeremy got off easy:

70
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:33,800
<i>four years in a juvenile
facility for manslaughter.

71
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:38,080
<i>To the coroner, the knife
strokes looked random, impulsive,

72
00:05:38,178 --> 00:05:40,953
<i>but I saw the work
of a young virtuoso.

73
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:43,012
<i>Too many major arteries
were severed --

74
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:45,502
<i>Femoral, brachial, carotid.

75
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:49,423
<i>Today Jeremy is just another
piece of trash on the street,

76
00:05:49,486 --> 00:05:52,022
<i>but four years ago,
he was the toast of Miami.

77
00:05:52,116 --> 00:05:53,582
It was a gruesome
scene today --

78
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:56,572
The bloody body of a teenage
boy found stabbed to death

79
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:58,491
inside this south Miami park.

80
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:01,072
Police haven't released
the name of the victim yet,

81
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:03,422
but our sources are telling
us that investigators

82
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:06,462
are holding a 15-year-old
suspect in custody.

83
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:08,383
We're hearing that the suspect

84
00:06:08,525 --> 00:06:10,983
lured the older boy to the
pond to spot alligators,

85
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,462
but once they were alone,

86
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:15,232
the victim was robbed
and repeatedly stabbed.

87
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:17,812
<i>But I knew what he was
and what he'd do again.

88
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:22,140
<i>All I had to do was circle
my calendar and wait.

89
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:29,991
Lemonade for my sweaty workers?

90
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:32,292
What do you say, crew?
Anybody parched?

91
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:33,860
What's parched?

92
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:37,873
When we put in the
new lemon tree,

93
00:06:37,965 --> 00:06:40,783
we'll be able to make our
own fresh-squeezed lemonade.

94
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,592
Can we have a lemonade stand?

95
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:47,162
I'll apply for a business license
first thing in the morning.

96
00:06:47,185 --> 00:06:49,551
Thank you for
doing this, Dexter.

97
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,112
You know, I moved here
from Michigan

98
00:06:51,136 --> 00:06:53,452
with dreams of fruit trees
in my yard.

99
00:06:53,595 --> 00:06:55,333
But they keep dying.

100
00:06:56,577 --> 00:06:59,293
I can't help it.
I kill things.

101
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:03,012
That must be awful.
Fortunately, I have a green thumb.

102
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:05,021
The key to happy citrus
is a fertilizer.

103
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,540
Bone meal works the best.

104
00:07:06,568 --> 00:07:08,120
Hey, Rita.

105
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:14,603
Paul doesn't live here anymore.

106
00:07:15,016 --> 00:07:17,742
No shit. He's in jail.
But...

107
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,751
See, he still owes me for
two ounces of blow,

108
00:07:19,866 --> 00:07:21,733
which means you owe me.

109
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:23,572
Don't get involved.

110
00:07:24,037 --> 00:07:26,330
<i>I never know in
these situations.

111
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,761
- I don't have money.
- You got a car.

112
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:34,692
- You want my car?
- Yeah. The keys in it?

113
00:07:35,065 --> 00:07:37,121
You know my dad?

114
00:07:37,315 --> 00:07:39,660
I sure do, little man.

115
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,142
And you want to know something?

116
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,061
You look just like him.

117
00:07:44,155 --> 00:07:46,363
I'm gonna tell him
you said hi, okay?

118
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:52,190
Look, if you want,
I could go in the house,

119
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:54,681
throw your furniture around,
make a real mess,

120
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:58,722
but what kind of message would
that send to the little ones?

121
00:07:58,865 --> 00:08:00,691
Just give me the fucking car.

122
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:04,433
Why don't you go inside and get the
keys? I'll wait with our friend here.

123
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:08,380
What?

124
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,741
You think you can take me
with your little red shovel?

125
00:08:44,085 --> 00:08:47,233
- Everything okay in there?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:53,563
- You need toilet paper?
- No.

127
00:08:59,945 --> 00:09:02,571
The guy clearly had no idea
who he was dealing with.

128
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:05,121
I'll file a report at work.
We'll get your car back.

129
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:09,481
No... No reports, Dexter.
Thank you, but...

130
00:09:10,085 --> 00:09:13,893
Paul's out of my life.
I filed for divorce.

131
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:16,793
I just want my past to go away.

132
00:09:17,076 --> 00:09:19,522
Well, it went away
in your Rav 4.

133
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:24,061
Whatever it takes.

134
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,230
I can give you a ride to work
until you get another car.

135
00:09:27,347 --> 00:09:30,041
Or I could take the bus like
millions of other people.

136
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,791
Come on, let's go outside
and enjoy this beautiful day.

137
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:34,920
Come on, kids.

138
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,511
What did they use, an ax?

139
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:41,260
It's blunt force.

140
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:42,980
See the way the head's caved in?

141
00:09:44,506 --> 00:09:47,942
You guys check out the new
hottie McGotass in dispatch yet?

142
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:49,813
She's a butter face.

143
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:52,490
- What's a butter face?
- You know, compadre --

144
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:55,855
She's got a hot body,
but her face...

145
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,817
How great would it be to
pull a bronco on her? Yeah.

146
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:04,757
Yeah? Mira a quí.
You do it doggy-style, right?

147
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:06,580
And just when she's
getting into it,

148
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,971
you grab her by the hips and you yell
another woman's name, and bam --

149
00:10:09,998 --> 00:10:12,802
you're riding her like a bronco
'cause she's trying to buck you off.

150
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:15,322
<i>Many times in life,
I feel like I'm missing

151
00:10:15,358 --> 00:10:19,121
<i>some essential piece of the human
puzzle. This is one of them.

152
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:21,122
What are you doing?
Oh, the bronco.

153
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:22,523
See, socia?
She knows.

154
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,420
I just got
my first official Homicide call.

155
00:10:24,448 --> 00:10:25,692
He's back.

156
00:10:25,966 --> 00:10:27,610
Who's back?
The ice-truck killer?

157
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:31,371
That's right. You won't
believe where he left the body.

158
00:10:56,696 --> 00:11:00,412
<i>I knew he'd be back.
Feels like Christmas morning.

159
00:11:00,698 --> 00:11:05,161
<i>Look at that --
A miracle on ice. Stunning.

160
00:11:11,178 --> 00:11:13,002
You all right, Dexter?

161
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:16,550
This is like a dream.

162
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:20,761
Standing on the home
ice of the Miami Blades.

163
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:23,003
I never pegged you
for a hockey fan.

164
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:27,692
There's something about standing in
a big cool hole I find very relaxing.

165
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:32,902
So, what do we know?

166
00:11:33,718 --> 00:11:36,340
Same as the others.
No blood.

167
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:39,072
So far,
I don't see any hesitation cuts.

168
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,472
No bones flayed.

169
00:11:40,705 --> 00:11:42,863
I think our boy's got
his confidence back.

170
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:46,283
He never lost it.
He was just getting bored.

171
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:48,683
What do you think he's
trying to tell us?

172
00:11:49,195 --> 00:11:51,963
That hockey's a violent sport.

173
00:11:53,807 --> 00:11:58,343
- What else?
- He's escalating the thrill.

174
00:11:58,756 --> 00:12:04,263
Posing his victim in the middle of a
20,000-seat arena for all Miami to see,

175
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:08,100
to show them -- to show us --
what he's capable of doing.

176
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,001
What did I miss?

177
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:18,440
- Relax. You didn't miss anything.
- Yeah, but she is -- fingertips.

178
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:22,612
This body belongs to the frozen
fingertips we found in the truck.

179
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,802
Sherry Taylor.
It's another prostitute.

180
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:28,282
No blood -- no need for me.

181
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:36,091
Morgan, come up to the command center.
We may have a suspect.

182
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:42,392
- Is there really a suspect?
- I'll let you know, bro,

183
00:12:42,536 --> 00:12:45,772
when I get back from my first
official Homicide investiga--

184
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,430
- I know her.
- Sherry?

185
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:52,330
Yeah, she called
herself Cherry.

186
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:56,242
We worked the same corner
when I was undercover.

187
00:12:57,115 --> 00:12:59,460
You were, like, friends?

188
00:13:01,228 --> 00:13:02,341
Yes.

189
00:13:02,947 --> 00:13:05,791
- Do you want a hug?
- Fuck off.

190
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:10,281
I tore apart the security office.
A surveillance tape is missing.

191
00:13:10,315 --> 00:13:12,421
Let me guess --
The one covering the ice.

192
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,040
- They said you were good.
- Don't bust my balls.

193
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:17,472
I've got the press knocking
on the door outside.

194
00:13:17,517 --> 00:13:20,011
Somebody who was here last
night saw something --

195
00:13:20,145 --> 00:13:22,782
Rent-a-badge,
cleaning crew,

196
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:25,562
crack whore in the men's room?
Come on, work with me.

197
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,712
They got a night watchman,
but we can't find him.

198
00:13:27,747 --> 00:13:29,562
- Well, then, he's a suspect.
- Unless the ice-truck killer

199
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:32,082
abducted him to gain
entry into the arena.

200
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:35,003
Did your brother help
you out with that logic?

201
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:37,792
The night watchman could've just been
at the wrong place at the wrong time.

202
00:13:37,827 --> 00:13:39,940
We need to get to his apartment
to see what we can find.

203
00:13:39,966 --> 00:13:43,062
Actually, I was hoping I could hit
Calle Ocho, talk to my old contacts.

204
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:44,702
I thought you wanted
to get out of Vice.

205
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:47,103
Isn't that what you cried
to the Captain last week?

206
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,730
Yeah, I mean...

207
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:50,691
I didn't cry.

208
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,643
Listen, my girls know
this victim, okay?

209
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:56,782
They may have information
that could help us.

210
00:13:57,198 --> 00:13:59,312
No, I want you to
work with Doakes.

211
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:02,661
Maria, she has contacts.

212
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:12,160
- You still got your tube top?
- And my nipple clamps.

213
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,611
Don't come back without
any information.

214
00:14:33,097 --> 00:14:35,403
<i>Everyone moves to Miami to die,

215
00:14:35,495 --> 00:14:38,833
<i>which means we have more junk
than any city in America.

216
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,790
<i>A skilled bargain hunter
can find real treasure here,

217
00:14:41,936 --> 00:14:44,751
<i>but that's not my
idea of hunting.

218
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,703
<i>I prefer a
stalk-and-ambush approach.

219
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:57,360
<i>My instincts are impeccable,
but I have to be sure of my prey.

220
00:14:57,497 --> 00:15:01,120
We're all adrenaline rush, you know?
Kill it til it dies.

221
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:05,000
We all meat hunters,
just out looking for dinner.

222
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:06,831
What you looking for?

223
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:11,680
- Can I see that one?
- Eh, good eye.

224
00:15:12,147 --> 00:15:15,173
It's a fixed-blade skinning knife.
Full tang, stainless steel.

225
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,501
Real time-saver for
the hunter who likes to...

226
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,991
...do his own butchering
in the field.

227
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:22,132
See the way that blade
curves like that?

228
00:15:22,197 --> 00:15:26,143
It's like the talon of an eagle.
15 bucks and she's yours.

229
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:29,112
I'll take it.

230
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,620
Hell, yeah, you'll take it.
Why would you not?

231
00:15:31,766 --> 00:15:33,120
I'll get your change.

232
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:44,560
Easy, kid.

233
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:46,342
What the fuck are
you doing, boy?

234
00:15:46,527 --> 00:15:47,782
I didn't see him.

235
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:50,132
- You all right, mister?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

236
00:15:50,365 --> 00:15:52,570
Honest mistake.
No harm.

237
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:56,710
Hey. You be careful
with that thing, huh?

238
00:16:01,478 --> 00:16:05,613
Sorry about that, boss.
I only sell them.

239
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:09,080
So, what you hunt --
trophies or meat?

240
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:16,993
What do you think today, Dex?
The Winchester?

241
00:16:17,828 --> 00:16:20,790
- What about the 9mm?
- A handgun?

242
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:23,613
Not exactly the weapon
of choice for pheasants.

243
00:16:23,646 --> 00:16:25,902
You need a wide spread
to bring them down.

244
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,890
Did you ever shoot
anybody, dad?

245
00:16:34,307 --> 00:16:38,400
- Afraid so.
- Any of them die?

246
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:40,461
Just one.

247
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:44,680
How'd it feel... to kill a guy?

248
00:16:45,476 --> 00:16:47,441
Not so great, Dex.

249
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:55,773
When you take a man's life,
you're not just killing them.

250
00:16:56,045 --> 00:17:00,092
You're snuffing out all the
things he'll ever become.

251
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,271
As a cop,

252
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:06,680
I only fire my weapon to save
a life. That's a code I live by.

253
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:12,021
Killing must serve a purpose.
Otherwise, it's just plain murder.

254
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,013
- You understand?
- Yeah.

255
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,493
Changed my mind.

256
00:17:25,748 --> 00:17:27,890
I think we'll take the Ruger.

257
00:17:29,096 --> 00:17:32,950
Rifle? I thought that shotguns
were best for pheasants.

258
00:17:33,465 --> 00:17:35,623
We're not gonna hunt pheasants.

259
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,183
- It's a big one.
- Yeah.

260
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:50,620
This deer will put meat
on our table tonight.

261
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,401
It's still alive.

262
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:03,743
For now, this hunt will
control the urges you feel.

263
00:18:03,868 --> 00:18:07,010
Channel them.
Why don't you go ahead, son?

264
00:18:07,106 --> 00:18:08,323
Really?

265
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,540
Put the poor animal
out of its misery.

266
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,580
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi.

267
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,530
Congratulations on
your confirmation.

268
00:19:30,747 --> 00:19:32,520
Thank you. Do I know you?

269
00:19:32,665 --> 00:19:35,430
My name's James Doakes.
Miami metro P.D.

270
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:39,902
I'm investigating the murder of
an undercover cop and his wife.

271
00:19:39,998 --> 00:19:44,182
That's terrible.
Were they members of the church?

272
00:19:44,286 --> 00:19:48,122
- No, Rose, they weren't.
- I don't understand.

273
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:51,303
Rose, have you ever
seen this man before?

274
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:53,782
I don't know.
Why are you asking me?

275
00:19:53,925 --> 00:19:55,781
Get away from my daughter.

276
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:56,830
It's okay.

277
00:19:58,776 --> 00:20:03,201
At my church?
In front of my family?

278
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:05,692
Ricky and Kara
had a family, too.

279
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:11,022
You just opened
a dangerous door.

280
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:13,121
No, man, you did...

281
00:20:13,247 --> 00:20:17,103
When you murdered a cop
and an innocent lady.

282
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,070
What is he talking
about, daddy?

283
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,890
Come on, honey.
Let's go.

284
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:22,843
- Daddy.
- Let's go!

285
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:26,423
You don't play by the rules, Guerrero.
Why should I?

286
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:40,712
You've got five minutes,
Bizach, okay?

287
00:20:42,936 --> 00:20:44,721
Yo, look who's back.

288
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:48,523
Pero mirela,
como está caliente!

289
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:52,971
Who'd you fuck --
Dolce or Gabbana?

290
00:20:53,115 --> 00:20:55,511
I let them both
pull a train, okay?

291
00:20:55,656 --> 00:20:58,970
Listen, I... I got a confession
to make. I'm...

292
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:03,392
I'm not who you think I am.
I'm a cop.

293
00:21:03,536 --> 00:21:06,492
Bridgett, get back --
Bridgett! I'm not gonna bust --

294
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:07,840
You're not a cop.
You're a whore.

295
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:09,091
- I'm not a fucking whore.
- Fucking who ?

296
00:21:09,128 --> 00:21:10,600
What's wrong with being
a fucking whore, huh?

297
00:21:10,618 --> 00:21:12,333
We trusted you, Brandy.

298
00:21:12,366 --> 00:21:14,911
My name's Debra, okay?
And I'm not here to bust you.

299
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:18,502
He hit again --
The ice-truck killer. He got Cherry.

300
00:21:18,606 --> 00:21:19,580
Cherry?

301
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:24,361
Shit.

302
00:21:25,216 --> 00:21:29,743
This shit's crazy. I'm out.
I got a sister who lives in Ohio,

303
00:21:29,877 --> 00:21:34,053
runs a fashion-boutique store.
I'm on the bus tomorrow.

304
00:21:34,146 --> 00:21:37,292
I ain't closing my shop for no sick,
psycho bitch.

305
00:21:37,345 --> 00:21:39,261
Fucking woman-hater.

306
00:21:39,358 --> 00:21:41,612
I was on the street before him.
Fuck it.

307
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:45,143
I can get him, you guys.
You just got to give me something.

308
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:48,432
Did any of you all see Cherry with
anyone the night before last?

309
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:50,862
Well, I saw her last night,

310
00:21:50,868 --> 00:21:52,941
and then she got into a
car and never came back.

311
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,242
But I was working
all night, so...

312
00:21:55,375 --> 00:21:56,830
You know the driver?

313
00:21:56,968 --> 00:21:59,462
No, but the car was,
like, one of those

314
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:02,551
old station wagons that have,
like, wood panels on the side.

315
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:05,660
This is good. This is good.
This is a lead.

316
00:22:06,177 --> 00:22:07,953
I should go get
Laguerta to listen.

317
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:09,691
Who's Laguerta?

318
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,983
She's my lieutenant.
She hates me.

319
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:14,530
But I'm close with the Captain.
I'll talk to him.

320
00:22:15,266 --> 00:22:18,502
- What?
- Never piss off your pimp.

321
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:22,080
- Laguerta's not my pimp.
- Is that right?

322
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:24,040
Bitch tell you what to do?

323
00:22:24,186 --> 00:22:26,152
Is your pussy taking
all the grief?

324
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:28,363
Does she steal
everything you earn?

325
00:22:28,546 --> 00:22:30,232
Yeah, she definitely does that.

326
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:35,793
Then she's your pimp, baby, and she
will mess you up if you play her.

327
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:37,822
I told you --
I'm not a fucking whore.

328
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,190
What's wrong with
being a fucking whore?

329
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:50,273
Hey. Bought you a present

330
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:53,842
to celebrate your first
official homicide case.

331
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:58,552
Seriously? It's a cactus.

332
00:22:58,658 --> 00:23:01,330
You only have to water
it three times a year.

333
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:04,451
Gee, Dex,
you didn't have to go out of your way.

334
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:06,561
I didn't.
I was at the swap meet.

335
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:10,742
So, any news on
our frosty friend?

336
00:23:10,876 --> 00:23:13,412
One of my contacts said
she saw Cherry getting in

337
00:23:13,557 --> 00:23:15,901
a wood-panel station
wagon the night she died.

338
00:23:16,086 --> 00:23:18,102
Did you check the DMV database?

339
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:22,582
As we speak. There are thousands
of registered station-wagon owners

340
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:25,682
in Miami-Dade county,
but guess who's not on the list?

341
00:23:25,778 --> 00:23:26,992
The night watchman.

342
00:23:27,136 --> 00:23:29,252
I knew Laguerta had her head
up her ass on that one.

343
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:31,462
She doesn't have shit on
the real ice-truck killer.

344
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:32,281
Good.

345
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:34,981
Why good?

346
00:23:36,978 --> 00:23:38,562
It's good for you.

347
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:43,782
You're gonna be the one to apprehend
that heinous murderer, not her.

348
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:49,660
- Thanks.
- All right. Good night, sister.

349
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:54,751
- Don't stay up too late.
- Okay.

350
00:23:55,037 --> 00:23:57,140
Thanks for stopping by.

351
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,802
- Hello?
- Hi.

352
00:24:12,896 --> 00:24:15,950
Are you --
Is this a bad time? It's Rita.

353
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:17,492
No, it's fine.
Hi.

354
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:22,910
I was just...reading a sad story.
Is everything okay?

355
00:24:23,005 --> 00:24:25,871
Yes, I'm --
Look, the thing is...

356
00:24:26,107 --> 00:24:27,943
You need me to pick
up Cody after school?

357
00:24:27,977 --> 00:24:31,552
No. Colleen's gonna take
him to karate with Hudson.

358
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:34,560
- What about Astor's piano?
- Jen's got that covered.

359
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:36,051
Look, it's social services.

360
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:38,461
There's a caseworker coming
by the house this afternoon.

361
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:42,121
I should be home by 4:00,
but with the buses...

362
00:24:43,926 --> 00:24:46,601
I'll be there.
Don't worry about a thing.

363
00:24:47,435 --> 00:24:49,971
Thank you, Dexter.

364
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:54,130
As you all know, a night watchman
from the hockey arena is missing.

365
00:24:54,255 --> 00:24:57,950
Till now, we presumed he was abducted
or murdered by the ice-truck killer.

366
00:24:58,065 --> 00:25:00,832
However, we searched
his apartment and found

367
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,430
a stolen surveillance tape
from the night of the murder.

368
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:06,733
Chief of security at the
hockey arena confirmed it.

369
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:10,450
The man you're looking at is Tony Tucci,
the missing night watchman.

370
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:13,691
And here's the best part --
Tucci has a record.

371
00:25:13,786 --> 00:25:16,092
He pulled a knife
at a party in '97.

372
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:22,112
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
Tony Tucci, the ice-truck killer.

373
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:22,990
Bullshit.

374
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:25,770
Captain Matthews is coordinating
with the FDLE* to launch
(*Florida Department of Law Enforcement)

375
00:25:25,868 --> 00:25:28,822
a statewide manhunt
as soon as we get clearances.

376
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:30,842
Does he drive a station wagon?

377
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:31,812
Excuse me?

378
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,653
Tucci --
What kind of car does he drive?

379
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:35,721
The last-known victim was seen
getting in a station wagon.

380
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:38,253
I don't recall asking for any questions,
Miss Morgan. Thank you.

381
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:41,671
Now, from this moment on, all our
resources go to finding this man.

382
00:25:41,818 --> 00:25:44,441
Your individual assignments
will be coming shortly.

383
00:25:44,587 --> 00:25:46,183
That's all for now.

384
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:56,172
Doesn't make sense.
After being so careful for so long,

385
00:25:56,198 --> 00:25:57,793
why would he leave
recorded evidence?

386
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,742
<i>Of course I agree
with my sister,

387
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,981
<i>but unlike her,
I'm not upset.

388
00:26:02,078 --> 00:26:06,733
<i>He's still out there,
and I'm waiting... breathless.

389
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:10,043
You sure we can't
get you anything?

390
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:11,120
I'm fine.

391
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,452
Rita's usually home
in time for the kids.

392
00:26:12,468 --> 00:26:13,672
I'm just backup.

393
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:15,341
Her bus must be late.

394
00:26:15,438 --> 00:26:18,370
My file says Miss Bennett's supposed
to have personal transportation.

395
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:22,003
Yeah, well, she did and
will again very soon.

396
00:26:22,098 --> 00:26:23,210
Probably next week.

397
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:25,852
Nothing to worry about.
I just have to make a note of it.

398
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:28,141
She's doing an exemplary job.

399
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:32,121
I wish all my home
visits were this lovely.

400
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,460
So why do you keep
coming around, then?

401
00:26:34,567 --> 00:26:37,382
Routine follow-up for all
domestic-violence cases.

402
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:40,071
We need to ensure a stable
home environment exists.

403
00:26:40,106 --> 00:26:43,242
It's a good thing.
The system does work from time to time.

404
00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:47,831
I was actually taken in by a
wonderful family. No abuse.

405
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:52,200
In fact, my foster father
understood I had special needs.

406
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:54,490
Without him...

407
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:56,172
You're lucky.

408
00:26:57,518 --> 00:26:58,592
<i>Lucky.

409
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:02,111
I'm here!
Hey, everyone, I'm here.

410
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:06,483
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

411
00:27:06,985 --> 00:27:10,781
<i>I am lucky.
What do I know about abuse?

412
00:27:10,806 --> 00:27:12,780
<i>Without the code of Harry,

413
00:27:12,925 --> 00:27:16,213
<i>I'm sure I would've committed
a senseless murder in my youth

414
00:27:16,586 --> 00:27:18,932
<i>just to watch the blood flow.

415
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:20,802
Just try and keep
him comfortable.

416
00:27:20,828 --> 00:27:22,573
It's about all we
can do for him now.

417
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:24,141
I don't understand.

418
00:27:24,245 --> 00:27:26,363
A week ago,
the doctor said he was getting better.

419
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,231
He is getting better, sweetie.

420
00:27:28,366 --> 00:27:31,852
A body cannot suffer
in sweet repose.

421
00:27:33,465 --> 00:27:37,613
What does that mean?
What the hell does that mean?

422
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:39,950
She's weird.

423
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,390
Listen, you two...

424
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:44,933
I'm not going to be
around much longer.

425
00:27:45,057 --> 00:27:47,021
Dad, don't say that.

426
00:27:47,258 --> 00:27:50,260
You can make it through
this if you fight.

427
00:27:51,428 --> 00:27:53,292
When I'm gone,

428
00:27:54,357 --> 00:27:57,930
I won't be able to stop
you from being who you are.

429
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:04,080
Sooner or later,
you'll need to do it.

430
00:28:04,226 --> 00:28:05,910
Do what?

431
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:11,951
Just remember our lessons.

432
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:15,562
What lessons?
What are you talking about?

433
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:20,271
- I can't make it without you.
- Yes, you can.

434
00:28:20,876 --> 00:28:23,643
If you feel like
you're slipping...

435
00:28:23,926 --> 00:28:29,952
...lean on your sister.
She'll keep you connected.

436
00:28:31,486 --> 00:28:33,832
Fucking forensics report.

437
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:37,023
- What'd they find?
- Tucci's hair and fiber.

438
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:39,800
Of course Tucci's hair and
fibers are on the body.

439
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:42,611
He's hauling her around with
his pork hands, isn't he?

440
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:44,622
Any word from the chem lab?

441
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,503
Same as the other murders.

442
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:49,691
The killer used liquid nitrogen
to preserve the tissue,

443
00:28:49,787 --> 00:28:51,611
give it that bleached look.

444
00:28:51,705 --> 00:28:55,000
You know how unstable
liquid nitrogen is?

445
00:28:55,697 --> 00:28:59,793
You'd have to be a lab rat just
to mess around with that shit.

446
00:28:59,978 --> 00:29:02,792
Tucci didn't even pass
high school chemistry.

447
00:29:03,637 --> 00:29:06,682
Watch carefully.
Right there -- see?

448
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:08,820
Right before he
repositioned the torso.

449
00:29:08,965 --> 00:29:10,183
He turned his head.

450
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:12,121
Like someone's giving
him directions.

451
00:29:12,157 --> 00:29:13,412
Someone like the ice-truck killer

452
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:15,853
olding a motherfucking gun
to his back.

453
00:29:16,058 --> 00:29:18,593
- The killer's framing Tucci.
- It looks that way.

454
00:29:19,377 --> 00:29:22,242
Laguerta's gonna lose her
sheep shit when she finds out.

455
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:24,213
She's gonna have to cancel
her press conference.

456
00:29:24,227 --> 00:29:27,490
And you know how Laguerta
loves her press conferences.

457
00:29:28,565 --> 00:29:30,870
Can I borrow this tape?

458
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:11,840
<i>Bingo.

459
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:14,982
<i>I know what happens next in
this gruesome little scenario.

460
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:18,412
<i>Jeremy is trying to
re-create his first kill,

461
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:19,813
<i>ritualize it.

462
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:24,043
You ready?

463
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:26,790
I don't know if I
want to do this, man.

464
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,530
What's wrong? I thought you
wanted to see an alligator.

465
00:30:29,568 --> 00:30:30,301
I do.

466
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:32,352
Come on.
It's in the marsh up here.

467
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:36,060
- Wait. Are you a pussy?
- No.

468
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:38,712
Okay.

469
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:47,201
Where is this place, man?

470
00:30:48,318 --> 00:30:50,233
It's right up here.

471
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:54,273
Come on, Jer.
What are you talking about?

472
00:30:54,876 --> 00:30:56,893
Don't be a bitch.

473
00:30:59,297 --> 00:31:03,433
- Here we are.
- I don't see it.

474
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:07,281
It's right there.
See its eyes sticking out?

475
00:31:12,786 --> 00:31:15,080
You have to get closer.

476
00:31:17,287 --> 00:31:19,352
I still don't see it.

477
00:31:20,556 --> 00:31:21,962
Really?

478
00:31:23,575 --> 00:31:27,062
Maybe I was wrong.

479
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,972
There's no gator here,
is there?

480
00:31:34,788 --> 00:31:39,342
I don't know, Lucas. Is there?

481
00:31:42,455 --> 00:31:45,042
Anyone see a frisbee?
It flew in here somewhere.

482
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:47,572
Shit! Let's get the
fuck out of here.

483
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:04,202
<i>What am I doing out here?

484
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:11,501
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

485
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:16,861
Fuck!

486
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:28,270
<i>All I had to do was drive home,

487
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,243
<i>have a taco, plan my attack.

488
00:32:30,385 --> 00:32:32,950
<i>Instead,
I tried to act human,

489
00:32:33,095 --> 00:32:35,012
<i>like it's my job to save lives.

490
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:52,781
<i>Code of Harry
never covered this.

491
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:55,172
<i>At least I know where Jeremy is

492
00:32:56,047 --> 00:32:57,783
<i>and what I need to do.

493
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,590
Don't let her.

494
00:33:05,488 --> 00:33:07,690
Okay, my brave little soldier.

495
00:33:07,838 --> 00:33:09,882
Let's get this nasty
shot out of the way.

496
00:33:09,995 --> 00:33:11,663
- No!
- Wait!

497
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:15,372
- What is it, honey?
- He doesn't want the shot.

498
00:33:15,568 --> 00:33:19,510
Your father's very sick.
He's in a lot of pain. He needs a shot.

499
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:22,181
- I want pain.
- He wants pain.

500
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:32,062
I'll have to tell the doctor.

501
00:33:32,208 --> 00:33:35,453
He's not going to be happy
you're refusing your medication.

502
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:44,760
You can tell.

503
00:33:44,997 --> 00:33:47,672
About the nurse? Yeah. She's...

504
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:50,880
...like me.

505
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:54,651
How could you tell?

506
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:59,771
She gives too much... morphine.

507
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:04,933
It's something else.
It's making me worse.

508
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:09,161
She's drugging you.
She's killing you by overdose.

509
00:34:09,355 --> 00:34:12,121
Not just me.
Others, too.

510
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:26,022
Stop her.

511
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,933
What do you mean, stop her?

512
00:34:30,078 --> 00:34:30,961
It's time.

513
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:36,791
Before she hurts anyone else.

514
00:34:41,367 --> 00:34:43,813
See the look on his face,
like he's scared?

515
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,782
Like he has a gun
pointed at him?

516
00:34:46,798 --> 00:34:51,360
I don't know, Debra.
It's not much -- a look off-camera.

517
00:34:51,558 --> 00:34:54,762
There's more. One of my Vice contacts,
Gabrielle -- I trust her --

518
00:34:54,795 --> 00:34:57,333
she saw the victim get
into a wood-paneled wagon

519
00:34:57,478 --> 00:35:00,581
the night of the victim's death.
That was the last time anyone saw her.

520
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:04,523
Did a background report on Tucci.
He doesn't even own a car.

521
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:09,131
There's no fucking way this guy
can be the ice-truck killer. Sir.

522
00:35:09,745 --> 00:35:12,273
What does lieutenant
Laguerta say about all this?

523
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:14,673
I came straight
to you, Captain.

524
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:17,450
You went around the back of
your commanding officer?

525
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:19,790
Laguerta doesn't listen to me.
Every time I open my mouth,...

526
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:23,293
You don't violate the chain of command.
You just don't.

527
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:27,503
Now, listen, Debra.
I gave you a shot in Homicide

528
00:35:27,636 --> 00:35:30,242
because I think you can make
a halfway-decent detective.

529
00:35:30,277 --> 00:35:32,350
But if I find you can't
swim in these waters,

530
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:34,632
I'll put you right
back on the street.

531
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:35,853
You got it?

532
00:35:36,228 --> 00:35:37,861
Yes, sir.

533
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:43,413
Your father never would've pulled
the kind of shit you just did.

534
00:35:46,607 --> 00:35:49,743
Did you know that one of your
officers has information

535
00:35:49,925 --> 00:35:52,551
that casts some doubt on
this manhunt of yours?

536
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:54,362
Who, Morgan?

537
00:35:55,755 --> 00:35:59,402
I realize you're something of
a folk hero around here, Maria,

538
00:35:59,426 --> 00:36:02,471
but it would be a mistake to ignore
the work of a promising officer

539
00:36:02,485 --> 00:36:04,652
just to further your
political career.

540
00:36:04,677 --> 00:36:06,413
Is that what you
think I'm doing?

541
00:36:06,427 --> 00:36:09,720
You were a middle-of-the-pack detective
before the press got ahold of you.

542
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:11,330
Thanks for the vote
of confidence.

543
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:14,001
It's a reality check,
and you need it.

544
00:36:14,028 --> 00:36:15,850
And I got it.

545
00:36:16,965 --> 00:36:21,151
Let's cut to the chase. Are you
telling me to call off my manhunt?

546
00:36:21,407 --> 00:36:25,131
'Cause I will remind you that Jeb
Bush himself signed off on it.

547
00:36:25,155 --> 00:36:26,143
No...

548
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:29,230
No. You go ahead and hold
your press conference, Maria.

549
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:32,571
People of this city need to know
we're doing something about this mess.

550
00:36:32,608 --> 00:36:34,523
But don't expect
me to bail you out

551
00:36:34,668 --> 00:36:38,190
if that night watchman
turns out to be a dead end.

552
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:42,272
A statewide manhunt is under
way right now in Florida.

553
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:43,411
According to police,

554
00:36:43,488 --> 00:36:47,110
a night watchman is on the run
after the dismembered body parts

555
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:49,790
of a young South Beach
woman were found Tuesday,

556
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:52,423
stacked on the home ice
of the Miami Blades.

557
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,801
The woman is believed
to be the latest victim

558
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:56,710
of the notorious
ice-truck killer,

559
00:36:56,906 --> 00:37:00,240
now responsible for five deaths
in the greater Miami area.

560
00:37:00,478 --> 00:37:03,342
These terrible
attacks have to stop.

561
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:05,762
And we have to stop them.

562
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:08,673
With Tony Tucci now
linked to the murders,

563
00:37:08,816 --> 00:37:11,112
it's our mission to find him.

564
00:37:11,836 --> 00:37:13,472
Fucking joke.

565
00:37:13,757 --> 00:37:17,252
Hey, going out tonight with the guys,
blow off a little steam -- you in?

566
00:37:17,285 --> 00:37:20,290
- Hey, man, sounds good.
- Pick you up at 8:00.

567
00:37:28,017 --> 00:37:30,282
Elevator's around the
corner and to your left.

568
00:37:30,318 --> 00:37:31,951
Enjoy your stay with us.

569
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:46,203
- Hello?
- Rita, this is Mr. Curtis.

570
00:37:46,338 --> 00:37:48,023
Are you coming to
pick up Astor?

571
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:52,920
Oh, no, a friend of mine is --
Denise. Is she not there?

572
00:37:53,058 --> 00:37:55,551
I'm afraid not,
but your daughter is.

573
00:37:55,737 --> 00:37:57,680
She's the last kid
left here at school.

574
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:02,312
I don't have a car.
Is she okay?

575
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:06,542
Yeah, she's just fine,
but we can't keep her here much longer.

576
00:38:07,748 --> 00:38:11,561
Okay. Okay,
I'll work something out.

577
00:38:22,435 --> 00:38:24,171
Do it again!

578
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:26,233
Shh. Let's not wake up Cody.

579
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:29,003
Now, let's see
about that splinter.

580
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:34,310
That's a deep one.

581
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:36,043
This might sting a bit.

582
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:40,650
But the magical Splinter Fairy will
soon make you forget all about it.

583
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:42,530
Who's the magical
Splinter Fairy?

584
00:38:42,715 --> 00:38:44,923
She's the second cousin
to the Tooth Fairy.

585
00:38:45,065 --> 00:38:49,061
She brings candy if you put your
splinter under your pillow at night.

586
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:52,503
The Tooth Fairy is make-believe,
just like the boogeyman.

587
00:38:53,638 --> 00:38:55,890
Hi, guys.

588
00:38:56,075 --> 00:38:57,573
You're right, Astor.

589
00:38:57,716 --> 00:38:59,552
There's no such thing
as the boogeyman.

590
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,172
But the Splinter Fairy --
she's the real deal.

591
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:05,873
Will the Splinter
Fairy come if I cry?

592
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:11,770
Thanks for picking her up.

593
00:39:12,696 --> 00:39:16,081
<i>If I had a heart,
it might be breaking right now.

594
00:40:25,158 --> 00:40:27,503
Oh, sorry.

595
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:49,073
Who we picking up now, man?

596
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:51,191
'Cause he sure ain't
sitting on my lap.

597
00:40:51,238 --> 00:40:53,303
We're not picking
up anybody, bro.

598
00:40:54,598 --> 00:40:56,940
Well, what we doing
in the Gables?

599
00:40:57,036 --> 00:41:01,411
I told you. We're blowing
off some steam. This is it.

600
00:41:02,756 --> 00:41:04,472
What the hell is this?

601
00:41:04,566 --> 00:41:06,060
It's a disguise.

602
00:41:06,896 --> 00:41:09,442
One of Guerrero's top lieutenants --
he lives here,

603
00:41:09,805 --> 00:41:11,493
and we're gonna fuck him up.

604
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,532
Hold up, Mac. I thought you said you
wanted to go out and get
shit-faced, man.

605
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:18,431
I am shit-faced.

606
00:41:19,317 --> 00:41:21,001
How do I look?

607
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:26,273
Man, I'm all for sending the message,
but this --

608
00:41:26,308 --> 00:41:27,801
This ain't the way, man.

609
00:41:27,948 --> 00:41:30,672
Why the hell not?
The guy's scum.

610
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:39,943
Mac, listen.
I've got to talk to you.

611
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,930
Mac, Mac! Hey, listen up, man.

612
00:41:44,027 --> 00:41:45,480
I showed my face to Guerrero.

613
00:41:45,615 --> 00:41:48,253
They gonna think I'm
behind this shit !

614
00:41:48,387 --> 00:41:50,450
- That's part of the plan.
- What plan?

615
00:41:50,648 --> 00:41:53,510
You fucked my sister.
You fucked a cop's wife.

616
00:41:53,645 --> 00:41:56,422
Now you're just fucked, buddy.

617
00:42:02,618 --> 00:42:04,161
Open the door!

618
00:42:09,065 --> 00:42:10,093
Shit.

619
00:42:19,065 --> 00:42:19,851
Fuck.

620
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:45,750
Hey, quit fucking around.
Turn on the lights.

621
00:42:46,918 --> 00:42:49,403
Come on, man.
Turn on the fucking lights!

622
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:56,223
You're mine now.

623
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,100
- What do you want?
- Silence.

624
00:42:58,238 --> 00:43:01,810
You gonna fuck me, faggot? 'Cause
I killed the last guy who raped me.

625
00:43:03,155 --> 00:43:04,600
What guy?

626
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:10,900
He raped you...

627
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:13,942
The guy you killed
when you were 15?

628
00:43:15,097 --> 00:43:17,493
Why didn't you tell anybody?

629
00:43:17,655 --> 00:43:19,621
Would you?

630
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:23,811
He fucked me, and I killed him,

631
00:43:23,955 --> 00:43:27,061
and if you try,
I'll kill you, too.

632
00:43:27,668 --> 00:43:29,541
<i>I understand now.

633
00:43:29,725 --> 00:43:31,220
<i>Why didn't I see it before?

634
00:43:31,406 --> 00:43:34,180
<i>Jeremy didn't murder
that boy four years ago.

635
00:43:34,507 --> 00:43:36,430
<i>He was taking out the garbage.

636
00:43:36,985 --> 00:43:38,723
<i>Just like I do.

637
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:45,612
Look, I really don't want to
cancel all my credit cards,

638
00:43:45,647 --> 00:43:47,540
and I hate waiting in line
at the DMV*,
(*Department of Motor Vehicles)

639
00:43:47,618 --> 00:43:49,881
so give me back the wallet
you stole from my car,

640
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:52,070
or I'll break your
fucking neck.

641
00:43:53,788 --> 00:43:55,853
It's in my backpack.

642
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:15,833
Wait --
Is that all?

643
00:44:18,477 --> 00:44:20,350
You want more?

644
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:29,580
That boy who raped you four years ago --
did he deserve to die?

645
00:44:30,236 --> 00:44:33,521
Yeah.
He did.

646
00:44:33,618 --> 00:44:36,390
Well, the boy the
other day didn't.

647
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:41,492
Remember that.
It could save your life one day.

648
00:44:47,875 --> 00:44:54,902
Mr. Tinker?

649
00:44:57,718 --> 00:45:00,442
Mr. Tinker, where are you?

650
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:03,232
Mr. Tinker?

651
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:09,921
Are you trapped behind the couch again,
Mr. Tinker-stinker?

652
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:13,181
<i>The nurse was my
first playmate.

653
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,012
<i>I'll always be grateful to her

654
00:45:15,106 --> 00:45:19,053
<i>for opening up so many
magnificent new doors for me.

655
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:39,123
<i>Things were a little
messy in the beginning.

656
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:42,173
<i>Hey, perfecting a
new craft takes time.

657
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:45,210
<i>But I was trained well.

658
00:45:45,405 --> 00:45:50,211
<i>Those who witnessed my early
stumbles never had a chance to tell.

659
00:46:06,818 --> 00:46:10,060
I've just been looking
through your photo album.

660
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:11,922
Hope you don't mind.

661
00:46:16,137 --> 00:46:18,903
Are all your victims in here?

662
00:46:37,535 --> 00:46:40,641
I'm sorry.
Let me help you with that.

663
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:48,773
Scream and lose a tongue.

664
00:47:03,106 --> 00:47:06,821
I helped them...

665
00:47:07,745 --> 00:47:10,421
All of them.

666
00:47:12,276 --> 00:47:14,762
I took their pain away.

667
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:17,931
I understand.

668
00:47:19,645 --> 00:47:22,753
Now it's time to
take away your pain.

669
00:47:36,846 --> 00:47:39,482
<i>It was messier than
I anticipated,

670
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:41,973
<i>but it was still a special day.

671
00:47:47,148 --> 00:47:51,481
<i>But, of course, it was really Harry
who paved the road to my salvation.

672
00:47:54,308 --> 00:47:57,161
<i>With the nurse put down,
Harry lived another year

673
00:47:57,265 --> 00:48:00,883
<i>before hardening arteries squeezed
the last bit of life from him,

674
00:48:01,515 --> 00:48:04,382
<i>but his lessons have
never failed me.

675
00:48:09,605 --> 00:48:12,470
<i>Harry taught me that
death isn't the end.

676
00:48:12,618 --> 00:48:14,630
<i>It's the beginning
of a chain reaction

677
00:48:14,776 --> 00:48:18,721
<i>that will catch you if
you're not careful.

678
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:32,323
<i>He taught me that none of us are who
we appear to be on the outside...

679
00:48:33,888 --> 00:48:39,062
<i>....but we must maintain
appearances to survive.

680
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:49,592
<i>But there was something
Harry didn't teach me,

681
00:48:49,696 --> 00:48:52,931
<i>something he didn't know,
couldn't possibly know.

682
00:48:53,006 --> 00:48:54,980
<i>The willful taking of life

683
00:48:55,008 --> 00:48:57,673
<i>represents the ultimate
disconnect from humanity.

684
00:48:57,695 --> 00:48:59,971
<i>It leaves you an outsider,

685
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:04,251
<i>forever looking in,
searching for company to keep.

686
00:49:15,537 --> 00:49:18,123
Sweet ride! Is it yours?

687
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:21,592
It's yours,
until your mom can get a new one.

688
00:49:21,688 --> 00:49:24,550
I borrowed it from impound
right before auction.

689
00:49:24,768 --> 00:49:26,412
- Dexter...
- Can we get in?

690
00:49:26,557 --> 00:49:27,811
You better.

691
00:49:32,946 --> 00:49:35,101
<i>All you can do is
play along at life

692
00:49:35,246 --> 00:49:37,782
<i>and hope that sometimes
you get it right.

693
00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,433
Thank you.

694
00:49:56,856 --> 00:49:59,670
<i>Score one for the
little wooden boy.
