00:00:15,156 --> 00:00:16,865
[whimpering]

2
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,455
[gasps]

3
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:24,082
[panting]

4
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,162
[theme music playing]

5
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:33,206
[alarm beeping]

6
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:42,465
- [alarm turns off]
- [automated voice] Seven o'clock a.m.

7
00:04:59,773 --> 00:05:01,149
[grunting]

8
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:07,448
[sighs]

9
00:05:28,135 --> 00:05:29,553
[Karen] Matt wouldn't understand.

10
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:31,722
You know what he would say.

11
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:33,807
That we're awesome?

12
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,560
[scoffs] No, that we're being stupid.

13
00:05:36,644 --> 00:05:38,937
I prefer the term
"foolheartedly provocative."

14
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:41,857
Yeah, that's lawyer talk
for stupid. You want coffee?

15
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:44,693
If we're gonna be Nancy Drew-ing together,

16
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,530
I think a certain level
of honesty is required.

17
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,282
What? You don't like my coffee?

18
00:05:49,365 --> 00:05:51,033
- No, I hate it.
- [Karen exclaims]

19
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:54,578
I appreciate the effort, but
the technique, or lack thereof...

20
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:56,289
[laughing] My God, you are such a dick.

21
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:59,292
On occasion some dickery may leak
out, but doesn't mean I'm wrong.

22
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,668
Well, it means somethin'.

23
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:02,545
Okay, let's say we keep Matt in the dark.

24
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,004
How long do you think...

25
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:05,464
[door opening]

26
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:08,050
I should grow my hair? Matt,
what's your take on that?

27
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,052
- Mullet? Full pony?
- [Karen] Holy shit.

28
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,554
- Did you fall down again?
- [Matt] Oh, it's nothing.

29
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:14,307
- Don't tell me what?
- Damn it!

30
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,558
[Karen] You heard that?

31
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,100
Guy's like a bat.

32
00:06:17,184 --> 00:06:20,228
Not blind like a... I mean,
you know, with the hearing.

33
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,953
- Bats aren't blind, Foggy.
- They're not?

34
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,023
It's a myth.

35
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:24,817
So, we're good.

36
00:06:25,776 --> 00:06:26,902
- Karen.
- Yeah?

37
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:29,988
What don't the two of you want me to know?

38
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,117
We're investigating Union Allied.

39
00:06:34,201 --> 00:06:36,244
Remind me to keep you
off the witness stand.

40
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,830
- You can't be doing that.
- Why not?

41
00:06:37,913 --> 00:06:40,416
For starters, you signed legal papers
and took money to leave it alone.

42
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:44,044
No, I signed papers saying that
I wouldn't go public and I won't.

43
00:06:44,127 --> 00:06:46,922
- We have someone lined up for that part.
- What part?

44
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,634
Breaking the story that, uh...

45
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:54,012
Look, whoever is behind Union Allied,
or whatever they call themselves now,

46
00:06:54,096 --> 00:06:56,974
they are trying to
strong-arm people like Elena

47
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:59,477
so that they can sweep
their homes away from them

48
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,186
and build condos no one can afford.

49
00:07:01,269 --> 00:07:02,396
And what do you think's gonna happen

50
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,648
when these "whoevers" find
out what it is you're up to?

51
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:07,275
- We already took care of it.
- Took care of what?

52
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:12,448
The, uh, guys who busted
up Elena's apartment.

53
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:16,076
They, uh, came after me when I
was leaving her place last night.

54
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:17,160
Are you okay?

55
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:18,454
[Karen] Yes.

56
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:20,956
Foggy was following me.

57
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,584
- Mmm-hmm. Why? Why were you
following her? - She was acting funny.

58
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,961
- No, there was no funny.
- There was a little funny.

59
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,797
This is what I'm talking about.
There are things out there.

60
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,799
You can't be doing this. You're
gonna get yourselves hurt.

61
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:34,219
No, I have already been
hurt by those bastards.

62
00:07:35,262 --> 00:07:37,473
You know, I don't care what I signed

63
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:40,017
or how much money they
paid me to forget. I don't.

64
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,727
And I'm not just going to
stick my head in the sand

65
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:45,689
and let it happen to somebody
else because I am scared.

66
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:48,609
Which I am... a lot.

67
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:52,946
And if you could see her
face, you'd know she means it.

68
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,698
Yeah, I kind of got that.

69
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:00,496
[stammering] Right, who else is involved?

70
00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:03,999
Who's helping you break whatever it
is you think you're gonna find out?

71
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:05,959
Ben Urich, from the Bulletin.

72
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,546
The one who wrote the Union Allied piece?

73
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,714
Karen's been working with
him. He seems like a good guy.

74
00:08:10,798 --> 00:08:13,258
[laughs] Yeah, everybody
does, until they aren't.

75
00:08:13,341 --> 00:08:16,219
No, I trust Ben as much
as I do you or Foggy, Matt.

76
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:19,097
I know what I am doing.
I am not some kid...

77
00:08:19,181 --> 00:08:22,184
Then don't act like one. Both of you.

78
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,020
I know you're just trying
to do the right thing here,

79
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:26,313
but we have to be smart about this.

80
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:27,398
We?

81
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:30,901
First rule, no more skulking
around, asking to get hurt.

82
00:08:30,984 --> 00:08:33,862
We do this, it's gonna be on
our turf. The legal system.

83
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,906
That's not nearly as
heroic as you might think.

84
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:38,469
I don't want anyone to be a hero,
Karen. I want you to be safe.

85
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:41,244
And I want to protect this firm and
everything we're trying to build here.

86
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:44,540
We know the law. We'll
use it to our advantage.

87
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,000
Agreed?

88
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:49,336
Do we have a choice?

89
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:51,464
Not so much.

90
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:55,300
[inhales] Yeah, okay.

91
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:56,677
So, what's the second rule?

92
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:01,264
I don't know, I'm making
this up as I go along.

93
00:09:05,436 --> 00:09:09,189
I understand your position.
You need to understand mine!

94
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:11,316
[speaking Japanese]

95
00:09:12,443 --> 00:09:15,278
[Wesley speaking English] He questions
the validity of your position.

96
00:09:15,362 --> 00:09:18,866
I say it is of piss and shit.

97
00:09:19,908 --> 00:09:23,537
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
Nevertheless, my point is valid.

98
00:09:23,621 --> 00:09:26,624
You made guarantees.

99
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:28,751
- [Fisk] Which I met.
- The Black Sky is dead.

100
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:33,046
You asked that the docks
and your transit path

101
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,132
be clear of police interference.

102
00:09:35,215 --> 00:09:39,136
- Did you observe any police?
- [sighs]

103
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:40,929
No.

104
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,390
Of course not, because I'm a man of honor!

105
00:09:43,474 --> 00:09:46,351
It will be difficult to
locate another Black Sky.

106
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:49,271
They are extremely rare.

107
00:09:49,354 --> 00:09:52,274
Perhaps you should have told
me the importance of your cargo

108
00:09:52,357 --> 00:09:54,652
before you lost it.

109
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,531
[speaking Japanese]

110
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:04,495
[speaking English] He's asking
if you'd like to renegotiate

111
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,622
the terms of your relationship.

112
00:10:06,705 --> 00:10:08,290
I'm...

113
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:12,419
sorry if I offended you.

114
00:10:12,503 --> 00:10:14,588
My apologies.

115
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,509
[speaking Japanese]

116
00:10:32,022 --> 00:10:33,774
- [door closes]
- [sighs]

117
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:36,652
You get that last part?

118
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:40,155
Yes, threats are clear in any language.

119
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:42,658
He needs to be taught some manners.

120
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:44,242
Leave it alone.

121
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:47,079
If the Russians had
spoken to you this way...

122
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:48,831
They aren't the Russians.

123
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:51,374
No, the Russians actually contributed.

124
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,794
Leland's financials, Gao's product,

125
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:58,215
and Vlad and Anatoly's distribution
until we absorbed that facet.

126
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,009
What do Nobu and his
men bring to the table?

127
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,179
What... What are they in all this?

128
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:05,973
A necessary evil.

129
00:11:07,015 --> 00:11:10,728
I just... I don't like the way
he speaks to you, that's all.

130
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,897
Especially now, when
everything's going our way.

131
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,110
That's exactly when
you need to be cautious.

132
00:11:24,742 --> 00:11:26,243
[indistinct talking]

133
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:38,714
[car horn honking]

134
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:51,101
[rock music playing on radio]

135
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:55,397
[Marlene] Can you please turn that down?

136
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:58,942
Your mom don't like music.

137
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:03,989
- I like it.
- That's 'cause you got taste.

138
00:12:04,072 --> 00:12:05,949
I love music. Just not so loud.

139
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:08,410
What the hell good is
it if you can't hear it?

140
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:09,953
- Right, Willie?
- Right!

141
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,371
Never trust the quiet ones.

142
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:14,041
Those are the pricks that
are always up to something.

143
00:12:16,084 --> 00:12:17,460
You cut it too short.

144
00:12:17,544 --> 00:12:19,212
What did I tell you?

145
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:20,338
Sorry.

146
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:21,840
Sorry, what?

147
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,383
Sir.

148
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:26,679
Respect. You gotta give it if you want it.

149
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,806
Don't forget that.

150
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,307
Make the next one longer.

151
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,559
You want your pop's face in the dirt?

152
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:33,852
- No, sir.
- Damn right.

153
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,569
You see that? That's our ticket.

154
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:44,321
Once you get on the city council,

155
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:46,865
everybody wants to put a
little somethin' in your pocket.

156
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:50,285
Remember Mr. Flores from up the street?

157
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:51,912
- No.
- [Bill] 'Course not.

158
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:53,747
You know why? 'Cause he got on the council

159
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,040
back when you were still
shitting in your pants.

160
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:56,541
Bill!

161
00:12:56,624 --> 00:12:57,876
But he ain't around no more.

162
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,881
One year after he got voted in,
packed up, got himself a real house.

163
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,132
Really?

164
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,718
Just like we're gonna buy.

165
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:11,306
This city? It's everything.

166
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:13,308
It's right there.

167
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:17,270
All you gotta do is put your
mind to it and make it happen.

168
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:20,899
You want a sip?

169
00:13:20,983 --> 00:13:22,067
- He most certainly does not.
- [Bill] Huh?

170
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,863
My dad let me take a sip from his
glass before I could talk. Go on.

171
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,742
Go on. What are you lookin' at her for?

172
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:31,744
I said it's okay. Take a big one.

173
00:13:33,203 --> 00:13:34,579
Go on.

174
00:13:37,124 --> 00:13:38,166
That's it.

175
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,253
- Bill, what are you doing? Jesus!
- [coughing]

176
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,839
Come on, it's funny. He's a man.

177
00:13:43,922 --> 00:13:44,965
Let him be a man.

178
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:47,801
- You worry too much.
- [Marlene] Somebody has to.

179
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:49,958
How are we paying for all this?

180
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:57,102
Got it covered. I took a loan.

181
00:13:57,185 --> 00:13:58,436
A loan?

182
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,523
- What'd the bank make you put up?
- No, no, no. Screw the bank.

183
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:02,607
Rigoletto floated me.

184
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,235
- [Marlene] Rigoletto?
- Who's that?

185
00:14:05,318 --> 00:14:08,989
[Bill] Nobody, forget it.
It's an investment, Marlene.

186
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:11,992
You gotta spend money to make money.

187
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:15,120
Once I get on the council,
this is all taken care of.

188
00:14:15,203 --> 00:14:18,123
- I don't know about all this.
- You don't know about nothin'!

189
00:14:18,206 --> 00:14:20,000
You gotta take risks.

190
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:23,253
You want something out of life,
you gotta put yourself out there.

191
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:26,131
You gotta put yourself out there, Mom!

192
00:14:26,214 --> 00:14:29,802
[chuckling] You see? The
kid is smarter than you.

193
00:14:35,933 --> 00:14:37,684
Yes, honestly.

194
00:14:37,768 --> 00:14:41,814
I've spent most of my time abroad in Asia.

195
00:14:41,897 --> 00:14:42,898
Yes.

196
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:44,649
I would.

197
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,444
- Maybe, we...
- [cell phone chimes]

198
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:50,072
- We...
- [chiming continues]

199
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:52,324
Could you please hold on a second?

200
00:14:55,493 --> 00:14:56,787
Wait. [scoffs]

201
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,543
I'm so sorry. I need to take this.

202
00:15:05,378 --> 00:15:08,841
I know, me, too. Good night, Vanessa.

203
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:12,677
Yes?

204
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,138
We have a situation.

205
00:15:15,222 --> 00:15:18,100
- [Fisk] Nobu?
- Detective Blake, he just woke up.

206
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:22,104
Our contacts in the media tell us
that it's gonna be tonight's lead.

207
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:25,107
Has he said anything we
need to be concerned about?

208
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,901
No, he's conscious, but
his injuries were extensive.

209
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,277
I'm hearing he can't speak yet.

210
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,029
That changes,

211
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:33,698
unlikely he's gonna be
overjoyed we had him shot.

212
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:34,782
Yes.

213
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,201
Well...

214
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:39,037
take care of him.

215
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:41,414
That poses an issue.

216
00:15:41,498 --> 00:15:44,501
There's a detail on his floor.
Twenty-four hour presence,

217
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:47,087
in case the man in the mask
tries to finish the job.

218
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,839
Are any of them ours?

219
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:52,843
Two... but not on the door. They
try to get in, it'll be noticed.

220
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,266
What about his partner, Hoffman?

221
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:03,811
I can reach out, but they go back,
since before the academy. I, uh...

222
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,148
I doubt he'll be receptive.

223
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,607
Set a meeting...

224
00:16:08,608 --> 00:16:10,693
and I'll speak with him myself.

225
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:12,195
Understood.

226
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,869
This is pointless, Matt.

227
00:16:18,952 --> 00:16:22,497
We should be out on the streets,
cracking names and taking skulls.

228
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,333
- I think you have that backwards.
- Not the way I do it.

229
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,545
[Matt laughing] Five minutes out there
and you'd end up in intensive care.

230
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:31,006
Hey, I handled myself pretty damn skippy

231
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:33,216
against baldy and his tattooed gorilla.

232
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,592
- Tell him, K.
- No, you did.

233
00:16:34,676 --> 00:16:36,970
What? I'm... What, I'm "K" now?

234
00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:39,264
- Trying something
new. - Mmm-mmm. Don't.

235
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:40,667
[Matt] Wait, this is interesting.

236
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:43,810
Confederated Global Investments.

237
00:16:43,894 --> 00:16:47,022
The company that hired us to
defend that bowling alley nut?

238
00:16:47,105 --> 00:16:48,856
Yeah. Karen, do you have
a list of the subsidiaries

239
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,442
you were able to track
down through their check?

240
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,860
Uh, yeah, yeah, I think so.

241
00:16:54,321 --> 00:16:55,405
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

242
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:57,532
Can you tell me if...

243
00:16:59,701 --> 00:17:02,537
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting is on the list?

244
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,207
Um...

245
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,125
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

246
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:08,835
There are half a dozen
complaints against them

247
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:11,046
for doing the same thing
they did at Elena's tenement.

248
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:13,465
Confed Global's trying to
force renters out of tenements?

249
00:17:13,548 --> 00:17:16,176
[stuttering] What about Elena's
landlord? That Tully guy?

250
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:18,095
I mean, he's gotta know
something about this.

251
00:17:18,178 --> 00:17:20,013
- See if I can track him down.
- [Matt] Use the phone.

252
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:21,098
Oh, come on!

253
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:22,975
- I'm making that rule number two.
- [Foggy] Your rules suck.

254
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:25,768
- I want that on record.
- [Matt] Fine, noted.

255
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:26,894
Oh, my God.

256
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,397
- What do you got?
- Uh, no, it's not, um...

257
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,857
The New York Bulletin online

258
00:17:30,941 --> 00:17:34,945
just reported that that cop that got
shot, he just regained consciousness.

259
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:36,238
- Detective Blake?
- [Karen] Yeah.

260
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,361
[Foggy] Guy's a real dick.

261
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:39,950
Still, he didn't deserve a
bullet from that masked douchebag.

262
00:17:40,033 --> 00:17:43,036
Okay. [laughs] Nobody knows
what really happened out there.

263
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,537
[Matt] Detective Blake might.

264
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:46,248
Be interested in what he has to say.

265
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,500
Yeah, so would I.

266
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,293
[Fisk] We can't allow this to happen.

267
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:55,798
I know that you have...
feelings regarding this matter.

268
00:17:55,882 --> 00:17:57,884
I respect that.

269
00:17:59,886 --> 00:18:05,142
But if Detective Blake
chooses to speak out of turn...

270
00:18:07,102 --> 00:18:11,898
the result would be...
unpleasant, for you and for me.

271
00:18:11,982 --> 00:18:14,609
Out of turn? You shot him.

272
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:19,197
Technically, we paid
someone else to shoot him.

273
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,534
Do you know what made us go down this path?

274
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:26,454
What led to a decision of such finality?

275
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:29,499
If you're worried about me, I
know how to keep my mouth shut.

276
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:33,045
If we doubted that, we wouldn't
be having this conversation.

277
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:36,048
[Fisk] Being informed...

278
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,217
knowing facts as they are...

279
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:43,430
not how we wish to perceive them,

280
00:18:43,513 --> 00:18:48,310
can tip the balance between life and death.

281
00:18:49,227 --> 00:18:53,481
Unlike you, your partner was
inconsistent in his attention to detail.

282
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,401
Well, that masked asshole beat
him senseless and broke his arm.

283
00:18:56,484 --> 00:18:57,860
It wasn't his fault.

284
00:18:57,944 --> 00:19:01,906
[Fisk] Yes, I forgave him for
that. What I find indefensible...

285
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:04,576
is we were not alerted...

286
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:08,621
that the addresses we
provided had been compromised.

287
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:13,710
They were given to ensure that any
Russian who survived the bombings

288
00:19:13,793 --> 00:19:17,047
would be properly attended to.

289
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,509
Not to aid the man in the mask
at locating Vladimir Ranskahov.

290
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:25,138
That led to an unfortunate complication.

291
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:31,144
One that your partner was
directly responsible for.

292
00:19:31,228 --> 00:19:33,230
[sighs] Yeah.

293
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:37,359
So, how long before I do
something that pisses you off?

294
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,903
Oh, the answer to that
is entirely up to you.

295
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,414
See, he's more than my partner, right?

296
00:19:51,498 --> 00:19:53,291
He's my friend.

297
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,254
I've known him since I was
a kid. That's 30, 35 years.

298
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:07,430
How much...

299
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:10,975
are each of those years worth to you?

300
00:20:11,976 --> 00:20:13,019
Hmm?

301
00:20:13,103 --> 00:20:15,605
In round figures?

302
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:32,830
[indistinct talking]

303
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:03,653
- Hey.
- Hey.

304
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:04,737
Good news, right?

305
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:06,448
Yeah, he always was a tough son of a bitch.

306
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:08,825
[laughs] Yeah. Hey, you gotta sign in.

307
00:21:08,908 --> 00:21:10,743
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.

308
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:16,208
- And I gotta check the bag.
- Yeah.

309
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,045
Mmm, meatball?

310
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:23,130
Yeah, from Marchioni's.
He loves that place.

311
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,258
I don't know, I thought
it might trigger something.

312
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:26,801
- Yeah. Well, come on in.
- Thanks.

313
00:21:34,351 --> 00:21:35,935
[monitor beeping]

314
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:41,148
[door closes]

315
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,834
I'm sorry.

316
00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:14,307
[grunts]

317
00:22:16,976 --> 00:22:18,228
What are you doin'?

318
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:19,354
[syringe clatters]

319
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:23,608
[grunts]

320
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,443
[coughing]

321
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:38,831
[Blake breathing raggedly]

322
00:22:50,176 --> 00:22:53,638
I need you to listen to
me. We don't have much time.

323
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:56,098
Whatever your partner
just injected you with

324
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:57,850
has already reached your heart.

325
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:00,895
You're gonna be dead soon.

326
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:02,271
And there's nothing anyone can do about it.

327
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:03,356
[machine beeping rapidly]

328
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,275
But you can make the man responsible
for this pay for what he's done.

329
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:07,360
[monitor beeping rapidly]

330
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:08,486
- [banging on door]
- [Brett] Hoffman!

331
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,613
Tell me everything you
know about Wilson Fisk.

332
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:12,449
[breathing raggedly]

333
00:23:12,532 --> 00:23:15,993
- [officer] Hoffman! Open the door!
- [Blake mumbling] Is it my turn for this?

334
00:23:16,077 --> 00:23:17,119
- [door rattling]
- [officer shouting]

335
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:18,923
Hoffman, what the hell
is going on in there?

336
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:21,499
[Blake gasping]

337
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:25,628
- [officer 1] Go! Go!
- [officer 2] Get in there!

338
00:23:25,712 --> 00:23:27,046
Move, move, move!

339
00:23:28,715 --> 00:23:30,342
- Move!
- Come on! Let's go!

340
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:32,301
- Go!
- [monitor flatlining]

341
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:40,893
Look at my face. I can't go
into the office like this.

342
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:44,564
I'm afraid to go anywhere with that
masked psychopath running around.

343
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,775
My son was coming to visit.

344
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,026
I had to tell him,

345
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:52,364
"Nope, stay out of New
York, Lee. Shit's goin' on."

346
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:54,907
I'm 73 years old.

347
00:23:54,991 --> 00:23:57,452
You know how many times
I have left to see him?

348
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,497
I apologize for the inconvenience, Leland.

349
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,040
I'm not looking for... Are you done?

350
00:24:03,124 --> 00:24:04,959
This thing itches like a son of a bitch.

351
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:06,711
It'll keep you safe when he's finished.

352
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:10,214
What's this coated with?

353
00:24:10,297 --> 00:24:13,760
Polyethylene, glycol, silicate.

354
00:24:13,843 --> 00:24:18,180
- Hydro-clusters form when kinetic
energy... - Yeah, great. I'm a 46" long.

355
00:24:19,098 --> 00:24:21,726
- That'll be all, Mr. Potter.
- Okay.

356
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:25,522
You need anything else, Mr. Fisk, sir?

357
00:24:25,605 --> 00:24:28,357
- Not today, Mr. Potter. Thank you.
- Okay.

358
00:24:30,527 --> 00:24:31,736
[Leland clears throat]

359
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,113
Kid's half an idiot.

360
00:24:35,031 --> 00:24:37,074
It's the other half that counts.

361
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:38,159
So...

362
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:41,954
what am I supposed to do here? Seriously?

363
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:43,164
He knows who I am.

364
00:24:43,247 --> 00:24:46,834
He found me once, he'll do it again.

365
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:50,880
I'll move you someplace
safe until it's resolved.

366
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:53,675
- I'll put six men on you.
- Make it a dozen.

367
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,092
If he drops me off a roof,

368
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:57,595
an awful lot of money is
going along for the ride.

369
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,348
- That sounds like a threat.
- No, just stating the obvious.

370
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:04,143
Never thought I'd have to with you.

371
00:25:04,226 --> 00:25:05,978
[footsteps approaching]

372
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,151
Is it taken care of?

373
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:14,028
Yes, but there was a complication.

374
00:25:14,111 --> 00:25:17,740
Well, there's a word I'm
hearing more and more.

375
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,950
[sighs] What happened?

376
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:20,952
Right after Hoffman injected Blake,

377
00:25:21,035 --> 00:25:23,871
he was incapacitated by our masked friend.

378
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:26,040
When Blake was still alive?

379
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:27,875
And talking, according to Hoffman.

380
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:31,420
[Leland chuckles] That's
great. That's wonderful.

381
00:25:31,504 --> 00:25:32,505
So we have no idea

382
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:35,842
what the guy you had shot
might have said to the whack job

383
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,594
you had framed for it?

384
00:25:38,636 --> 00:25:41,055
- No, but there is
an upside. - Mmm-hmm.

385
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,682
[Wesley] Hoffman was able to spin it.

386
00:25:42,765 --> 00:25:45,768
Told everyone he was assaulted
by the man in the mask,

387
00:25:45,852 --> 00:25:47,353
then he finished what
he started with Blake.

388
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:49,313
So we're not exposed on that front.

389
00:25:49,396 --> 00:25:52,609
Well, let's have a parade.

390
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:55,361
This guy, Hoffman, how much does he know?

391
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:57,905
We're taking care of it, Leland.

392
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,825
Well, that fills me with warm comfort.

393
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,163
Situation's being handled, all right.

394
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:07,999
Just not by you.

395
00:26:10,292 --> 00:26:12,504
[Marlene] You're gonna
be all right, Wilson.

396
00:26:13,129 --> 00:26:14,589
It's okay, honey.

397
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:17,091
- Have some Zuppa, okay?
- [sniffling]

398
00:26:17,174 --> 00:26:19,176
- I'm not hungry.
- You eat it.

399
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,887
It'll make you feel better.

400
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:25,349
- Are you having some?
- Sure, baby.

401
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:35,442
[Marlene] Mmm.

402
00:26:37,612 --> 00:26:40,907
Do you think it's true? What Bernie said?

403
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,118
You can't listen to people like that.

404
00:26:44,201 --> 00:26:46,788
You have to just block them out.

405
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:48,080
[coughing]

406
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:50,457
The hell happened to you?

407
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,334
It's all right, I've got this.

408
00:26:54,128 --> 00:26:55,880
You feed him too much of that shit.

409
00:26:55,963 --> 00:26:58,465
You want him to get
fatter than he already is?

410
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,593
- [Marlene] Bill!
- Come on, what happened?

411
00:27:00,677 --> 00:27:01,928
[Marlene sighs]

412
00:27:02,011 --> 00:27:04,091
- It was that Bernie Walker kid...
- Am I asking you?

413
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:08,059
What did he do?

414
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,519
He was knocking your signs down.

415
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:13,439
I told him to stop, but he wouldn't.

416
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:17,401
He said I was a loser... just like my dad.

417
00:27:20,947 --> 00:27:21,948
Get your coat.

418
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:25,952
Get your coat!

419
00:27:37,797 --> 00:27:38,840
[Bill] Hey!

420
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:41,676
That him?

421
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,724
You been knocking down my signs?

422
00:27:47,807 --> 00:27:49,767
Yeah, so? Election's over.

423
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:52,651
Doesn't give you the right to destroy
other people's property, does it?

424
00:27:54,355 --> 00:27:56,565
Oh, you're not running your mouth now, huh?

425
00:27:56,649 --> 00:27:58,693
My boy said you had plenty to say to him.

426
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,821
I put myself out there.

427
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:06,242
You think it's my fault they
don't see it, what I could bring?

428
00:28:07,493 --> 00:28:09,370
You wanna call me a loser
to my face, you little shit?

429
00:28:09,453 --> 00:28:11,205
I didn't call you a loser, man.

430
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:13,124
Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?

431
00:28:13,207 --> 00:28:14,541
He say it, or not?

432
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,044
- Speak up when I'm talking to you.
- He said it.

433
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:19,881
No, I didn't. My dad did.

434
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:21,048
I was just repeating it.

435
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:24,802
You think that's funny?

436
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:28,264
Huh? What a man tries to do?

437
00:28:28,347 --> 00:28:31,433
- How he puts himself out there?
- Whatever, man, Jesus.

438
00:28:31,517 --> 00:28:34,145
Hey! Hey, I'm talking to you.

439
00:28:34,228 --> 00:28:35,229
[Fisk] Dad!

440
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,484
- [bat thudding]
- Say something funny!

441
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:42,361
Say something funny! Go ahead!

442
00:28:42,444 --> 00:28:43,445
Dad, stop!

443
00:28:45,406 --> 00:28:47,366
- [Bill] Huh?
- [Bernie wincing]

444
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:48,993
- Come here.
- Dad...

445
00:28:49,076 --> 00:28:50,995
Come here. Come here.

446
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,331
Come here.

447
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:58,127
It's people like this
that wanna keep you down.

448
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,212
Keep you afraid.

449
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:03,007
You have to show 'em that
that can never happen.

450
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,802
You gotta show 'em that you're a man.

451
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:07,469
Kick him.

452
00:29:07,553 --> 00:29:11,766
Don't give me that look like your
mother. You do what I tell you. Kick him.

453
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,851
Kick him!

454
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:18,286
- [Bernie groans]
- [Bill] Kick him again.

455
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,650
Kick him!

456
00:29:21,567 --> 00:29:24,111
Keep kicking him! Kick him!

457
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:25,822
Harder!

458
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:29,200
Kick him! Kick him!

459
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,202
Harder!

460
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:34,330
[breathing heavily]

461
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:35,790
[gasping]

462
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:43,464
[sighs]

463
00:30:20,584 --> 00:30:22,378
[cell phone ringing]

464
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,222
Yes?

465
00:30:33,305 --> 00:30:37,393
Gao reached out. She'd like a word.

466
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:39,937
- Send the car around.
- She's coming to you.

467
00:30:40,021 --> 00:30:41,605
Now.

468
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:47,319
Can you be here before she arrives?

469
00:30:47,403 --> 00:30:49,739
I'm already on my way.

470
00:30:49,822 --> 00:30:51,698
Thank you, Wesley.

471
00:30:56,412 --> 00:30:58,873
[speaking Mandarin]

472
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:06,881
[speaking English] She
approves of your choice of tea.

473
00:31:08,257 --> 00:31:11,928
I picked it up on my last
visit to your country.

474
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,722
I thought you might enjoy it.

475
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:17,558
[speaking Mandarin]

476
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:26,179
[translating in English] She
says she didn't come for tea.

477
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:28,945
He does not need you to form my words.

478
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:30,321
Do you, Wilson?

479
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:33,157
You speak English.

480
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,659
I speak many languages.

481
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:39,455
[Fisk] How many?

482
00:31:40,372 --> 00:31:41,582
All of them.

483
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:48,798
[speaking Mandarin]
And you speak my tongue,

484
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:49,882
do you not?

485
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,677
How long have you known?

486
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:56,430
[Gao] Since the beginning.

487
00:31:56,513 --> 00:32:00,517
It is the clever man who plays the fool.

488
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:02,644
And a foolish woman...

489
00:32:02,728 --> 00:32:03,768
who does not recognize it.

490
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:09,360
[speaking Japanese] Tell me,

491
00:32:09,443 --> 00:32:15,282
has Nobu guessed you
speak Japanese as well?

492
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:17,994
I don't believe so, no.

493
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:19,203
[Gao laughs]

494
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,706
[speaking English] You may leave us.

495
00:32:28,545 --> 00:32:29,630
Wait outside.

496
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:41,808
[speaking Mandarin] Nobu
isn't very happy with you.

497
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:46,981
That man is never happy with anyone.

498
00:32:47,064 --> 00:32:48,941
[laughs] True.

499
00:32:50,026 --> 00:32:51,861
But...

500
00:32:51,944 --> 00:32:53,820
I have heard Leland...

501
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:55,990
is equally displeased.

502
00:32:56,073 --> 00:32:59,660
It's under control.

503
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:02,496
How do you think...

504
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,916
I knew where you live, Wilson?

505
00:33:07,376 --> 00:33:10,004
This is one of your most guarded secrets,

506
00:33:10,087 --> 00:33:12,089
yes?

507
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,926
The king in his castle.

508
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:21,015
Did I divine the location
from bones and spells,

509
00:33:21,098 --> 00:33:25,561
chanted beneath the moonlight?

510
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:27,771
No.

511
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,027
I discovered it because...

512
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:35,654
you have become sloppy.

513
00:33:36,655 --> 00:33:37,907
[clicking tongue]

514
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,741
And emotional.

515
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:45,081
Just as the Russians became,

516
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:46,707
in their final moments.

517
00:33:53,339 --> 00:33:58,510
Recent events have been trying,

518
00:33:58,594 --> 00:34:00,179
I admit.

519
00:34:00,262 --> 00:34:02,139
But I promise...

520
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,229
I am not here to pluck
flowers from a thicket.

521
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:11,398
This is a courtesy,

522
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,985
because you have shown me respect.

523
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:23,702
Restore your house to order.

524
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:28,707
Or I will begin dealing...

525
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,335
with Nobu and Leland directly.

526
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,550
Gratitude for the tea.

527
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,726
[exclaims]

528
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:50,729
[yelling]

529
00:34:53,232 --> 00:34:54,650
[breathing heavily]

530
00:34:58,487 --> 00:34:59,821
Get out.

531
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,950
Sir, if there's anything I can bring...

532
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,495
[yelling] Get out!

533
00:35:10,666 --> 00:35:12,168
[sighs heavily]

534
00:35:18,007 --> 00:35:19,800
Think of the man you wanna be.

535
00:35:20,926 --> 00:35:22,969
You sit here and you stare at that wall

536
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,057
and you think about that.

537
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,433
You're my son.

538
00:35:27,516 --> 00:35:31,020
You should be a king,
not some fat little pussy.

539
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,190
Sit.

540
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:39,445
What'd I say? Don't look
at me, look at the wall.

541
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:44,450
Don't take your eyes off till I get back.

542
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,578
[Marlene] It's late, where are you going?

543
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:49,455
I gotta take care of
something, what's it matter?

544
00:35:49,538 --> 00:35:51,123
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

545
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:54,000
No, Marlene, it can't, all right?

546
00:35:56,002 --> 00:35:59,340
[sighs] I gotta talk
to Rigoletto... tonight.

547
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:02,634
- Oh, Jesus.
- [Bill] Don't worry.

548
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:04,803
[Marlene] How much you owe him?
[Bill] Don't worry about it.

549
00:36:04,886 --> 00:36:06,930
- How much?
- I got it covered.

550
00:36:07,013 --> 00:36:08,133
That's all you need to know.

551
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,352
You know, I told you, you shouldn't
have borrowed money from him.

552
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:13,645
But no, you had to be the big shot, huh?

553
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:16,690
- You had to have your face plastered all...
- [Marlene groaning]

554
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:19,360
It's not enough I get that shit out there?

555
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:22,863
I gotta get it in my own
house? In my own house?

556
00:36:22,946 --> 00:36:25,949
- [Marlene] Bill! No, no, no, no, no!
- Shut up! Shut up!

557
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:27,784
- Shut up!
- [sobbing] No, please!

558
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:30,454
- Shut up! Shut up!
- No, please! No!

559
00:36:31,622 --> 00:36:33,082
Shut up!

560
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:49,515
I didn't call for you.

561
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:52,393
No, I just thought you
might need something.

562
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:54,811
If I needed you, I would've asked.

563
00:36:56,688 --> 00:36:59,024
I don't think that's always true, sir.

564
00:37:19,253 --> 00:37:22,964
We'll be all right. Thank you.

565
00:37:30,764 --> 00:37:32,057
I like your place.

566
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:35,227
Not sure about the table.

567
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:37,471
- Looks like you aren't, either.
- [inhales] Please go.

568
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,941
If that's what you really want.

569
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:50,701
He's worried about you... your friend.

570
00:37:50,784 --> 00:37:52,369
Ah, he shouldn't be.

571
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,872
You made a promise...

572
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,543
to always be honest with me.

573
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:02,045
What is it?

574
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:08,552
I'm afraid.

575
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:10,429
Of what?

576
00:38:11,597 --> 00:38:13,599
The way you'd look at me if you knew.

577
00:38:25,986 --> 00:38:27,696
Tell me.

578
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:31,825
[Bill] Shut up! [Marlene
sobbing] No, please!

579
00:38:31,908 --> 00:38:33,785
[Bill hitting Marlene] Shut
up! I don't wanna hear it!

580
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:35,309
- [Bill] I lost because of you!
- No!

581
00:38:35,371 --> 00:38:36,997
- Because of this family.
- No!

582
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,582
[Bill] They see it!

583
00:38:38,665 --> 00:38:41,335
They see you and that little
bastard and they laugh!

584
00:38:41,418 --> 00:38:42,961
[Marlene sobbing]

585
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:44,546
- [Bill] And you don't believe in me!
- I do.

586
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,007
- And you see what happens?
- No!

587
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,884
- You see what happens?
- No!

588
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:51,762
- [hitting continues]
- [Marlene wailing] Oh, God, no!

589
00:38:54,055 --> 00:38:56,308
- [Bill] You don't believe in me! Shut up!
- [hitting continues]

590
00:38:56,392 --> 00:38:57,434
Stop it!

591
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:00,896
[breathing heavily]

592
00:39:03,106 --> 00:39:05,651
What are you gonna do
with that, fatty? Huh?

593
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,861
Huh?

594
00:39:09,946 --> 00:39:11,782
That's what I thought.

595
00:39:13,074 --> 00:39:15,494
You believe this kid? He
gets that shit from you.

596
00:39:24,836 --> 00:39:26,630
Oh, God.

597
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:33,053
[Fisk grunting]

598
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:36,848
[yelling] Keep kicking
him! Keep kicking him!

599
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:40,185
Keep kicking him!

600
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:44,398
[screaming] Keep kicking him!

601
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,526
- Wilson... [shushing]
- [Fisk sobbing]

602
00:39:48,527 --> 00:39:50,446
- It's okay.
- Mommy.

603
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:53,365
It's all right. It's all right,
baby. It's all right. [shushing]

604
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:57,536
It's all right. It's okay. It's
okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby.

605
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,996
- It's okay.
- [Fisk whimpering]

606
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,461
Okay.

607
00:40:07,253 --> 00:40:08,880
[both breathing heavily]

608
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:11,925
Get the saw.

609
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:53,675
- [grunting]
- [sawing]

610
00:41:03,352 --> 00:41:04,561
[Fisk exhales]

611
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:09,190
We carried him in bags down to the river.

612
00:41:09,274 --> 00:41:12,694
One every night, for the next week.

613
00:41:12,778 --> 00:41:14,530
[Vanessa shudders]

614
00:41:14,613 --> 00:41:17,115
Everyone in town knew that
he owed money to Rigoletto.

615
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:19,660
So, I guess they thought that...

616
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,912
he'd left town to avoid him.

617
00:41:23,747 --> 00:41:26,875
My mother, she sent me
to live with relatives

618
00:41:26,958 --> 00:41:28,877
on the farm that I told you about.

619
00:41:30,754 --> 00:41:32,213
It wasn't your fault.

620
00:41:34,174 --> 00:41:36,217
You were protecting your mother.

621
00:41:37,553 --> 00:41:40,764
I didn't do it for her. I did it for me.

622
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:45,018
[inhales sharply] That's
why I still wear these.

623
00:41:45,101 --> 00:41:48,605
To remind myself that I'm not
cruel for the sake of cruelty!

624
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:50,482
That I'm not my father!

625
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:52,776
That I'm not a monster!

626
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:56,112
Am I?

627
00:41:57,989 --> 00:42:00,200
No, Wilson.

628
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,619
You aren't.

629
00:42:07,541 --> 00:42:08,834
[Fisk sighs]

630
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:16,883
But soon it won't matter.

631
00:42:16,967 --> 00:42:20,053
There are people out there
that want to expose me.

632
00:42:23,056 --> 00:42:25,476
They don't understand what
I'm trying to do for this city.

633
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,937
They want to drag my
name through the streets!

634
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:31,982
They want to destroy everything
that I'm trying to accomplish.

635
00:42:32,065 --> 00:42:34,234
[Fisk sighing heavily]

636
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:38,113
And are you going to let them?

637
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:44,453
No.

638
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:48,582
[thunder rumbling]

639
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:52,377
It was a total bust. No, I...

640
00:42:52,461 --> 00:42:56,465
Ellison. Ellison, no...

641
00:42:56,548 --> 00:42:59,384
He's a crazy old man in a tinfoil hat.

642
00:43:01,136 --> 00:43:04,890
And why are we chasing
a story like this anyway?

643
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:06,391
What?

644
00:43:07,768 --> 00:43:09,227
Shit.

645
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:11,938
Look, can I call you back?
I'm drowning out here.

646
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,899
Yes, yes, okay. Fine.

647
00:43:16,818 --> 00:43:18,862
[thunder rumbling]

648
00:43:24,951 --> 00:43:27,370
We need to talk.

649
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:33,001
Do you know who I am?

650
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:40,466
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

651
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,218
Do you believe that?

652
00:43:43,136 --> 00:43:44,763
What they're saying about me?

653
00:43:44,846 --> 00:43:48,099
You've been in an awful lot of wrong
places at the wrong time lately.

654
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:50,310
But I've heard the other stories.

655
00:43:50,393 --> 00:43:53,564
About the man in the mask, helping people.

656
00:43:54,981 --> 00:43:57,108
Sounds like maybe there's
more than one side to you.

657
00:43:58,026 --> 00:44:00,904
I didn't blow the hell out of the Russians.

658
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:02,781
And I didn't shoot those cops.

659
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:04,741
[Ben] So, what?

660
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:06,451
You want me to write your side of this?

661
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:10,038
No, I want you to expose
the man responsible.

662
00:44:10,121 --> 00:44:13,750
The man who's tearing this
city apart, piece by piece.

663
00:44:13,834 --> 00:44:15,877
You got a name?

664
00:44:15,961 --> 00:44:17,045
Wilson Fisk.

665
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:20,506
- Never heard of him.
- Because he doesn't want you to.

666
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,675
That's what makes him dangerous.

667
00:44:21,758 --> 00:44:23,638
Living in the shadows,
no one knowing who he is.

668
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:26,262
Said the man in the mask.

669
00:44:28,306 --> 00:44:31,434
- I'm trying to protect this city.
- Maybe.

670
00:44:31,517 --> 00:44:35,355
But right now they hate you. And
have no idea who this Fisk guy is.

671
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:37,315
You can change that.

672
00:44:37,398 --> 00:44:39,109
So could 100 other reporters.

673
00:44:39,192 --> 00:44:40,611
Why me?

674
00:44:40,694 --> 00:44:43,029
There are good people who trust you, Ben.

675
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,448
I have faith in their judgment.

676
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:49,327
Union Allied.

677
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:55,541
Guessing that was you who dumped that
guy on the doorsteps of the Bulletin?

678
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,585
I think he's connected to Fisk.

679
00:44:57,669 --> 00:44:59,129
That woman you saved that night?

680
00:44:59,212 --> 00:45:00,922
She's a good kid.

681
00:45:02,423 --> 00:45:06,136
Still believes you're a hero,
despite what everybody's saying.

682
00:45:06,219 --> 00:45:07,679
People like her are why I do this.

683
00:45:09,555 --> 00:45:11,683
If I do the smart thing and say no?

684
00:45:13,727 --> 00:45:15,436
Then I'll have to stop him some other way.

685
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:17,605
That has a ring of finality to it.

686
00:45:17,689 --> 00:45:19,024
I'm not a killer.

687
00:45:20,066 --> 00:45:21,567
I keep telling people that.

688
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,987
[Ben] But that could change, couldn't it?

689
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,492
[thunder rumbles]

690
00:45:32,913 --> 00:45:33,914
What do you got?

691
00:45:33,997 --> 00:45:35,791
Bits and pieces.

692
00:45:35,874 --> 00:45:37,751
Russians... Triads... Yakuza...

693
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:40,586
all funneling money through
a man named Leland Owlsley.

694
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,715
The Wall Street guy?
How'd you get all this?

695
00:45:44,966 --> 00:45:46,051
How do you think?

696
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:49,719
So all you got is what
you've beaten out of people?

697
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:52,640
- I can't print that without credible...
- Detective Blake...

698
00:45:52,724 --> 00:45:54,726
I was at the hospital when he died.

699
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:57,312
Yeah, they're saying
you sent him on his way.

700
00:45:58,646 --> 00:46:02,275
It was his partner, Hoffman.
They both worked for Fisk.

701
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:05,320
Blake gave Fisk up, before he went.

702
00:46:05,403 --> 00:46:06,738
You get this on tape?

703
00:46:07,655 --> 00:46:11,242
Somebody else in the room
to corroborate what he said?

704
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:16,247
I need reliable sources.

705
00:46:16,331 --> 00:46:19,417
A bunch of "he said, she said"
is not gonna put this guy away.

706
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,838
We don't need to put him away.
Just drag him into the light.

707
00:46:22,921 --> 00:46:24,005
Give him nowhere to hide.

708
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:26,466
Once the city knows who he is...

709
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,259
they'll tear him apart.

710
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:35,100
And this is the guy at the
top. You sure about that?

711
00:46:35,183 --> 00:46:37,060
I'd bet my life on it.

712
00:46:38,436 --> 00:46:40,856
You're betting mine now, too.

713
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:47,278
- Tell me everything you know.
- [thunder rumbling]

714
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,449
[breathing heavily]

715
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:56,079
[gasps]

716
00:47:21,396 --> 00:47:22,898
[Ben] "'You get what you deserve.'

717
00:47:23,857 --> 00:47:25,108
It's an old saying.

718
00:47:25,191 --> 00:47:27,819
One that survived the
years, because it's true.

719
00:47:27,903 --> 00:47:28,945
For the most part.

720
00:47:29,029 --> 00:47:31,322
But not for everyone.

721
00:47:31,406 --> 00:47:34,242
Some get more than they deserve.

722
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:37,662
Because they believe they
aren't like everyone else.

723
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:40,957
That the rules, the ones
people like me and you,

724
00:47:41,041 --> 00:47:45,753
the people that work and struggle
to live our lives, just live,

725
00:47:45,837 --> 00:47:47,338
don't apply to them.

726
00:47:47,422 --> 00:47:51,217
That they can do anything
and live happily ever after,

727
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,261
while the rest of us suffer.

728
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:56,347
They do this from the shadows.

729
00:47:56,431 --> 00:47:58,558
Shadows that we cast.

730
00:47:58,641 --> 00:48:01,061
With our indifference.

731
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:03,479
With a pervasive lack
of interest in anything

732
00:48:03,563 --> 00:48:07,733
that doesn't directly affect
us, we, in the here and now.

733
00:48:10,111 --> 00:48:12,906
Or maybe it's just the shadow of weariness.

734
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:15,366
Of how tired we are,

735
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:20,288
struggling to claw our way back to
a middle class that no longer exist,

736
00:48:20,371 --> 00:48:23,333
because of those who take
more than they deserve.

737
00:48:23,416 --> 00:48:25,251
And they keep taking,

738
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:28,171
until all that's left for the rest of us

739
00:48:28,254 --> 00:48:31,174
is a memory of how it used to be

740
00:48:31,257 --> 00:48:33,927
before the corporations
and the bottom line decided

741
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,470
we didn't matter anymore.

742
00:48:36,804 --> 00:48:37,848
But we do.

743
00:48:38,764 --> 00:48:42,936
You and I, the people of this city...

744
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:45,480
we still matter.

745
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:50,360
There's someone in Hell's Kitchen
that doesn't share this belief.

746
00:48:50,443 --> 00:48:53,363
He's been among us for quite some time.

747
00:48:53,446 --> 00:48:56,824
You've never heard his name.
You've never seen his face.

748
00:48:56,908 --> 00:48:58,368
He's stayed in the shadows.

749
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:03,874
Because men like him, men that
want to control our city, our lives,

750
00:49:03,957 --> 00:49:06,834
fear the light and what it reveals.

751
00:49:06,918 --> 00:49:11,631
This man must no longer be
allowed to operate in the darkness.

752
00:49:11,714 --> 00:49:16,302
If he has nothing to hide,
let him step forward."

753
00:49:17,971 --> 00:49:20,640
[Fisk on TV] I'm not very good
at this, out, being in public.

754
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,810
But I felt the need to
speak up for this city

755
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,480
that I love with all my heart.

756
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:30,650
No one should have to live in fear.

757
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:32,568
[crowd applauding]

758
00:49:33,361 --> 00:49:36,114
[Fisk] In fear of madmen...

759
00:49:36,197 --> 00:49:38,699
who have no regard for who they injure.

760
00:49:38,783 --> 00:49:41,619
In fear of the Devil of Hell's Kitchen,

761
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:44,539
who has inflicted untold
pain and suffering.

762
00:49:45,456 --> 00:49:49,877
This masked terrorist and
psychopaths of his kind,

763
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:51,671
we must show them

764
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:58,594
we will not bow down to their
campaign of coercion and intimidation.

765
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:02,307
We must stand up to them.

766
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,102
As this man, my dearest
friend, Leland Owlsley,

767
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:08,229
a pillar in the financial community,

768
00:50:08,313 --> 00:50:11,191
stood up when he was recently assaulted.

769
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:15,153
But this assault was for no other
reason than to send me a message.

770
00:50:15,236 --> 00:50:18,073
A message warning me to stop.

771
00:50:18,156 --> 00:50:21,117
To give up my dream that
I have for this city.

772
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:23,619
A dream of a better place.

773
00:50:24,787 --> 00:50:28,624
A place for its citizens to feel safe.

774
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:31,169
To feel pride.

775
00:50:31,252 --> 00:50:33,421
I tried to do this quietly,

776
00:50:33,504 --> 00:50:35,465
not wanting to draw attention.

777
00:50:35,548 --> 00:50:37,133
The last thing I wanted

778
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:39,510
was for anyone close to me

779
00:50:39,594 --> 00:50:42,888
to become a target from those
who do not share my dream.

780
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:48,019
For those who will have this
city stay exactly as it is,

781
00:50:48,103 --> 00:50:51,064
mired in poverty and crime.

782
00:50:51,147 --> 00:50:54,484
But I know now it was
foolish to make that decision.

783
00:50:54,567 --> 00:50:57,403
That I can no longer do it alone.

784
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,823
That I cannot keep living in the shadows...

785
00:51:01,907 --> 00:51:03,868
afraid of the light.

786
00:51:03,951 --> 00:51:07,663
None of us can. None of
us should be forced to.

787
00:51:08,623 --> 00:51:11,084
We must do this together.

788
00:51:12,085 --> 00:51:16,089
We must resist those who
would have us live in fear.

789
00:51:20,718 --> 00:51:22,220
My name...

790
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:25,806
is Wilson Fisk.

791
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:30,770
And together, we can make
this city a better place.

792
00:51:30,853 --> 00:51:31,854
[crowd cheering]

793
00:51:31,937 --> 00:51:33,731
- [yelling]
- [objects smashing]

794
00:51:33,814 --> 00:51:35,066
[grunts]

795
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,193
[breathing heavily]

796
00:51:42,407 --> 00:51:44,450
[dramatic music playing]
