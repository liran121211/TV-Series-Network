1
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:22,531
(Soft music playing on speakers)

2
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:33,291
Hi.

3
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:36,294
Can I get a size 10 and a lane?

4
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:38,381
Sorry. We're closing up.

5
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:41,800
He's still playing.

6
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:44,762
Mr. Prohaszka bowls when he wants to.
Worked it out with the owner.

7
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:47,305
Can I join him for a few balls?

8
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,182
You wanna ask, knock yourself out.

9
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,184
Be right back.

10
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,106
Excuse me.

11
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,444
I was just wondering if maybe
I could join you for a couple games?

12
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,696
- Private game. You mind?
- No.

13
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,741
Hey... sorry.

14
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,661
I was just really looking forward
to throwing a few balls.

15
00:01:08,744 --> 00:01:10,454
Get this moron out of my face.

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,749
Hey, come on.

17
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:14,958
(Exclaims)

18
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,209
(Grunting)

19
00:01:20,172 --> 00:01:21,253
(Prohaszka)
Whoa, whoa. Hey!

20
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,468
You got a bad attitude, friend.

21
00:01:34,603 --> 00:01:35,813
Mmm.

22
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:38,148
(Sniffing)

23
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,232
(Exhales)

24
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:41,569
Love that smell.

25
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,612
Metal and oil.

26
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:47,282
Fresh, never been fired.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,326
Take a whiff.

28
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,747
Like a good revolver better.

29
00:01:55,165 --> 00:01:56,417
No chance of jamming up.

30
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:59,044
Man.

31
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:00,128
Look at this.

32
00:02:00,212 --> 00:02:02,465
This is top of the line.

33
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:07,428
I guarantee this baby will not jam
or my name ain't Turk Barrett.

34
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,805
(Gun clicks)

35
00:02:10,723 --> 00:02:11,724
(Exclaims)

36
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:14,184
(Grunting)

37
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,186
This is how he negotiates, huh?

38
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:34,663
(Screaming in pain)

39
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:44,666
- (Bones cracking)
- (Screams)

40
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,969
(Grunting)

41
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:53,223
(Panting)

42
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:58,331
(Dispatcher on phone)
Police are on their way, miss. Stay calm.

43
00:02:58,562 --> 00:02:59,605
(Gasps)

44
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:00,898
Hello?

45
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:08,071
(Police siren wailing in the distance)

46
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:21,251
(Tires squealing)

47
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,551
(Wailing continues)

48
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:34,640
(Police officer 1)
Got him? Where is he?

49
00:03:34,723 --> 00:03:37,043
(Police officer 2) Got him in sight.
He's right over there.

50
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:39,996
- (Police officer 1) Don't move!
- (Guns cocking)

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,354
(Police officer 2)
Stay there!

52
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,940
(Police officer 3)
Keep your hands up!

53
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,650
Dispatch, Victor 23...

54
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,359
I want a lawyer.

55
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:48,445

56
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,257
(Church bells ringing)

57
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,732
You're Jack Murdock's kid, aren't you?

58
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,277
It's all right.
Seal of Confession.

59
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,072
Anything you said during
the sacrament of penance

60
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:15,323
stays between us.

61
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:19,244
Could've killed 10 people,
I couldn't tell anyone.

62
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:20,663
That seem fair to you?

63
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:22,455
Is what it is.

64
00:05:26,334 --> 00:05:29,379
- I have to get to work.
- Yeah, me, too.

65
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,965
Wouldn't mind a cup of coffee
first, though.

66
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:36,469
Chamber of commerce donated
one of those... fancy espresso machines

67
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:39,097
for meetings and stuff.

68
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:42,225
I make a heck of a latte,
if you're interested.

69
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,105
Some other time, maybe.

70
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:54,404
Seemed you had a lot on your mind
last time you were here.

71
00:05:56,782 --> 00:05:59,076
Sure you don't want that latte?

72
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,079
Take care of yourself, Father.

73
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:33,861
- Thought you'd forgotten about me, Urich.
- (Chuckles)

74
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:34,945
(Man 1)
Never happen.

75
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,864
(Man 2)
I don't know.

76
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:40,367
People's memories
these days ain't so good.

77
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:45,538
Back in the day,
I couldn't wait to see this view.

78
00:06:45,622 --> 00:06:49,501
Me and the boys, driving in Friday nights.

79
00:06:51,754 --> 00:06:54,256
Kings of the castle.

80
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:56,925
Kings don't have bodies in the trunk.

81
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:58,802
Tell that to Macbeth.

82
00:06:58,886 --> 00:06:59,970
(Chuckles)

83
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:03,098
What's this about
you moving to Florida?

84
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:05,600
Did you hear about Rigoletto?

85
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:06,935
Heard he retired.

86
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,063
Yeah... in pieces.

87
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,112
- Somebody putting it to you?
- You know the rules.

88
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:22,159
- Is it the Russians?
- The rules.

89
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,789
You go first... and then maybe
I got something to say.

90
00:07:26,872 --> 00:07:28,999
That's the way it's always been.

91
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:34,504
Russians got a bee up their ass.

92
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:36,799
Somebody's been hitting them... hard.

93
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:39,009
Mostly around the docks.

94
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,970
Wasn't Rigoletto,
that what you're thinking.

95
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:46,058
So who are we looking at?

96
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:48,936
You tell me.

97
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,606
I don't know.

98
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,026
Been scratching at it.

99
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,862
Police reports get altered.
Public records, too.

100
00:08:00,238 --> 00:08:03,116
But I know a pattern
when it shoves a thumb in my eye.

101
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,828
A new player, maybe?

102
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:09,957
Used to be if you killed a man,
you sent his wife flowers.

103
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,168
Now they just send his wife with him.

104
00:08:19,216 --> 00:08:20,758
You know something, don't you?

105
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:21,844
Yeah.

106
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:25,222
Florida's beautiful
this time of year.

107
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:29,684
(Ben sighs)

108
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,145
The rules.

109
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,065
There are no rules, Benny.
Not anymore.

110
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,651
So that's it?

111
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,197
That's all I get?

112
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,992
You know, when I went away to do my 10,

113
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:49,454
every newspaper in town
dragged my name through the shit.

114
00:08:49,537 --> 00:08:51,248
You were the only one who did it...

115
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,752
without mentioning my kids.

116
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,757
Always grateful for that.

117
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:04,052
Then give me something.

118
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:06,763
A name... anything.

119
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:10,893
Take a pass on this one, Benny.

120
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:13,311
Some fights will just get you bloody.

121
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,417
(Door opens)

122
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,211
(Foggy sighs)

123
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,732
You know the whole,
"Let's stay out all night," thing?

124
00:09:41,756 --> 00:09:43,175
Yeah.

125
00:09:43,258 --> 00:09:45,510
How about next time
we skip the part with the eel?

126
00:09:45,593 --> 00:09:47,220
(Chuckles)
Deal.

127
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:49,597
Hey, what do you think about
getting a sign on the door?

128
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,059
- Well, you got a sign.
- A real one.

129
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:54,602
(Scoffs)
You should get some clients first.

130
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:56,646
Just one little sign.
What could it cost?

131
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:58,356
Frank, you can barely afford to pay me.

132
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,108
I thought you were working for free.

133
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:03,946
I... I did... for a day.

134
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:05,613
(Door opens)

135
00:10:05,697 --> 00:10:09,201
- Hey... you know she's not really free?
- Hey.

136
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:11,786
(Foggy)
Jesus. What happened to your eye?

137
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:14,706
- Oh. Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

138
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:17,542
I just wasn't paying attention
last night. It's my fault.

139
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:18,668
You need a dog.

140
00:10:19,102 --> 00:10:21,022
- (Scoffs) I'm not getting a dog.
- (Foggy) What?

141
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:22,589
You don't like dogs?
Who doesn't like dogs?

142
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:23,756
I... I love dogs.

143
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,508
(Foggy)
Everybody loves dogs.

144
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,927
(Knocking on door)

145
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:31,181
Was that a knock?

146
00:10:32,182 --> 00:10:33,308
Someone's at the door.

147
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,767
Our door?

148
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:35,852
Uh...

149
00:10:36,644 --> 00:10:37,645
Karen?

150
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,608
Right.

151
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:42,817
Okay.

152
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:48,865
Hi.

153
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,369
Do you do walk-ins?

154
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,580
(Man)
I represent a consortium with

155
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:57,499
diversified interests
in the private sector,

156
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,501
both domestic and international.

157
00:10:59,584 --> 00:11:03,838
From time to time, we scout the landscape
for promising talent to put on retainer.

158
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:05,966
- (Chuckles) Retainer?
- Mmm.

159
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,050
(Matt)
Why are you approaching us?

160
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,052
Why not a larger firm, Mr., uh...

161
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,513
Confederated Global Investments
is my employer.

162
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:13,431
It's not what I was asking.

163
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:14,682
(Man chuckles)

164
00:11:14,766 --> 00:11:17,810
(Man) It's the only name relevant
to this discussion, Mr. Murdock.

165
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:18,895
Oh.

166
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:20,772
So, why us?

167
00:11:20,855 --> 00:11:26,653
Obviously, the larger firms aren't able
to provide the same hands-on attention

168
00:11:26,736 --> 00:11:28,696
that we pride ourselves on
at Nelson and Murdock.

169
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,448
(Man)
It's a fair question.

170
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:33,868
I'm here because my employer
does extensive business in Hell's Kitchen,

171
00:11:33,951 --> 00:11:36,704
and who knows it better
than two local boys

172
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,123
who graduated from Columbia Law,

173
00:11:38,206 --> 00:11:40,667
cum laude and summa cum laude?

174
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,669
Uh, the "summa" part is politics.

175
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:43,920
(Chuckles)

176
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,256
You set up shop
right here in your backyard

177
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:50,427
despite the fact that both of you
were made a very lucrative offer

178
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,429
from Landman and Zack in Manhattan
where you interned.

179
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,763
You've done your homework.

180
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:55,723
My employer expects no less.

181
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:58,060
Then forgive me for being blunt.

182
00:11:58,143 --> 00:12:00,062
(Stammers)
"Blunt" is a strong word.

183
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:02,939
In my line of work,
I find it refreshing.

184
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,566
What is that line of work exactly?

185
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:10,363
What my partner is trying to say is
we're still building a practice,

186
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:12,990
so we're very particular
about our clientele.

187
00:12:13,075 --> 00:12:15,743
I assure you,
all my employer wants

188
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:20,290
is for you to continue
to be ethical, decent men...

189
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,874
good lawyers.

190
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,668
And for that, for nothing more than

191
00:12:23,751 --> 00:12:26,754
your exceptional skills
and your discretion...

192
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:31,301
you'll be fairly compensated.

193
00:12:39,976 --> 00:12:41,311
(Foggy)
Uh-huh.

194
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:42,645
(Chuckles)

195
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,731
It's... It's fair.
That's... That's fair.

196
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,609
Your partner doesn't seem convinced.

197
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:51,821
Like Foggy said,
we're particular about our clientele.

198
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:58,161
I'm curious about
your... clientele.

199
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,456
Do they all end up working for you
after you get them off for murder

200
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,791
or just the pretty ones?

201
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,963
You, uh, give us a minute, please?

202
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:11,924
Um...

203
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:24,312
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset anyone.

204
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:27,023
How did you know about
Miss Page's situation?

205
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,525
She was never charged.

206
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,776
There was nothing in the papers.

207
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,220
(Man)
I have friends on the force.

208
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,945
I hear I'm not the only one.

209
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:36,158
I think we might be
veering off the subject.

210
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:38,160
I understand your concerns,
Mr. Murdock.

211
00:13:38,243 --> 00:13:41,746
Perhaps... you should
review one of our cases...

212
00:13:41,829 --> 00:13:43,165
before you make a decision?

213
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:44,582
Peace of mind and whatnot.

214
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:47,043
That's a fantastic idea.

215
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,378
Matthew?

216
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:51,214
Yeah, what harm could it do?

217
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,300
Excellent.

218
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:58,263
You have... 38 minutes
to get to Precinct 15.

219
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:01,183
(Foggy)
What? Now? What's the case?

220
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,019
Everything you need is in this file.

221
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:11,401
Thank you for your time.

222
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,570
No. Thank you.

223
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:15,905
Thank you very...

224
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,532
(Door closes)

225
00:14:17,615 --> 00:14:18,991
What is your problem?

226
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:20,368
He wouldn't even
give us his name, Foggy.

227
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:22,829
You wouldn't care if you could see
the zeroes on this check.

228
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,081
- Yeah, maybe you would if you couldn't.
- We're running out of time.

229
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,624
- I'll meet you there.
- Meet me? (Stammers)

230
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,335
The hell are you going?

231
00:14:28,418 --> 00:14:29,419
Matt!

232
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,846
(Watch ticking)

233
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,869
It's been taken care of, sir.

234
00:15:02,952 --> 00:15:04,329
(Ticking stops)

235
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:41,283
(Foggy) So what exactly happened,
Mr. Healy?

236
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:42,784
In your own words.

237
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:45,912
All I wanted was
to throw a few balls.

238
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:48,039
The lady at the shoe counter
will tell you the same.

239
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:49,457
She also says that

240
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:52,794
you crushed the deceased's skull
with a bowling ball.

241
00:15:52,877 --> 00:15:54,629
Self-defense.

242
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:58,633
The man and his... whatever they were,
they threatened my life.

243
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:01,386
They threatened you how?

244
00:16:01,469 --> 00:16:03,179
Verbally? Physically?

245
00:16:03,805 --> 00:16:05,181
Which sounds better?

246
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:07,559
Excuse me?

247
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:11,521
They threatened me
both verbally and physically.

248
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,318
(Clears throat)

249
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:24,409
So... you say you... didn't know
or have never met Mr... Prohaszka

250
00:16:24,492 --> 00:16:27,036
- prior to last night?
- No...

251
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:32,249
but I do regret any injurious consequences
my actions may have caused.

252
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:38,130
You have quite the legal vocabulary,
Mr. Healy.

253
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,092
Am I right in assuming
this isn't your first rodeo?

254
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:43,636
I had issues.

255
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:47,974
I'm better now.

256
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:50,893
(Exhales deeply)

257
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:55,940
On second thought...
Mr. Healy, uh...

258
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,318
perhaps our firm
isn't the right fit for you.

259
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:00,027
Sorry I'm late.
(Clears throat)

260
00:17:00,111 --> 00:17:01,153
Uh, no, no, that's...

261
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:04,407
I was just explaining
to Mr. Healy that, uh...

262
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,283
we have a full caseload
right now, so we...

263
00:17:06,368 --> 00:17:08,077
We'd be happy to
represent you, Mr. Healy.

264
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,079
- What?
- We're taking the case.

265
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,873
(Clears throat)
Uh...

266
00:17:11,956 --> 00:17:14,597
Why don't we start from the beginning?
Tell me everything you know.

267
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,922
I understand the policy
has an allotment of days,

268
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:24,301
but last time we spoke,
I was told I could request an extension.

269
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:28,180
- This was last month, yes.
- (Door opens)

270
00:17:32,769 --> 00:17:34,521
What's the new form called?

271
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,315
From the website.

272
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,818
Of course. Thanks.

273
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:45,782
Insurance talk?

274
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,409
It's the worst.

275
00:17:47,492 --> 00:17:49,619
I remember, uh,
with my kids and the dentist.

276
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:50,912
Yeah.

277
00:17:50,995 --> 00:17:54,666
Yeah. Got a minute
to talk about next week's spread?

278
00:17:54,749 --> 00:17:56,000
Already working on it.

279
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,960
Another organized crime thing?

280
00:17:58,961 --> 00:18:01,172
All of Hell's Kitchen.

281
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:05,843
There's a new player on the scene.
No one knows who it is or what they want.

282
00:18:05,927 --> 00:18:07,720
Everybody's scrambling.

283
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,472
Your assignment's
the city desk, Ben.

284
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,058
This is the city.
No one else is on this yet.

285
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:13,976
I'm the only one who sees it.

286
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,102
It's not sexy.

287
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:18,105
We're a newspaper, Ellison,
not a girlie mag.

288
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:21,025
You know that's not what I meant,
and nobody calls them that anymore.

289
00:18:21,943 --> 00:18:23,486
It's not just the Russians.

290
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,323
I think maybe the Union Allied scandal
might tie into this.

291
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:31,118
Right, and you remember
what that exposé did for circulation?

292
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:33,120
Dick with a side of,
"Who gives a shit?"

293
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:34,872
This is a real story.

294
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:37,083
Yeah, and it's gonna end
the same as it always does, right?

295
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,918
A bunch of fat old guys
in some white-collar prison

296
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,211
with more fat old guys.

297
00:18:40,294 --> 00:18:44,090
The cops aren't even on this yet.
We could be the ones to connect the dots.

298
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:47,259
It doesn't sell papers, Ben.

299
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:49,721
Not anymore.

300
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:55,351
I want you on the subway line piece.

301
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:00,857
"Rumors bubbling.

302
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,444
Will Hell's Kitchen
finally get a subway line?"

303
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:06,779
Come on, we tell that every year.

304
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:09,031
- And every year, it kills.
- For a fluff piece.

305
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,576
You know, you like to
be on the ground, right?

306
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:13,828
You like to talk to people.
Take a poll.

307
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:16,288
What color do they like?

308
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:18,040
You know, we got a blue line,
we got a yellow line.

309
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,125
We're running out of colors.

310
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,752
Like M&M's?

311
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:22,587
Yeah, see?
You'll write the hell out of it.

312
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:25,882
There used to be a time

313
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:29,969
when the people in this building
wrote the hell out of the news.

314
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:35,767
Everybody we know...
is making twice what we are

315
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,395
writing for blogs,
working from home in their underwear.

316
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:44,108
We're hanging on
by our fingertips, Ben.

317
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:46,486
You really want to be
greasing that ledge?

318
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,744
Make it visual, all right?

319
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:58,748
I'll call down to Graphics,
see if I can drum up a chart.

320
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:02,001
Oh, and, um...

321
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:04,128
I'll put in a call
to the insurance drones,

322
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:06,172
see what I can do, okay?

323
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:16,057
(Sighs)

324
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:23,230
Would you like us to reiterate the terms
of attorney-client privilege, Mr. Healy?

325
00:20:23,314 --> 00:20:25,482
Think I got it.

326
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:29,111
Then you know anything you tell us
stays in this room.

327
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,279
Just like church.

328
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:36,327
You must be a very important man.

329
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:38,454
That a question?

330
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,747
Statement.

331
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:41,583
It's not every day
a global investment firm

332
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:43,334
picks up the tab
for a murder suspect.

333
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:45,002
Self-defense.

334
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,941
I wonder if you could shed some light
on the man that hired us to represent you.

335
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:51,045
- Don't think I can, counselor.
- Can't or you won't?

336
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:53,928
Maybe we should focus on
details pertinent to the case?

337
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:55,137
Just trying to build a solid defense,

338
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,807
and the connection between Mr. Healy
and the man that came to our offices

339
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,934
might just help prove his innocence.

340
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:01,185
How?

341
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:05,648
Maybe they're old friends.
Maybe he's a character witness.

342
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:09,611
Or maybe you were in his employment
at the time of the incident.

343
00:21:09,694 --> 00:21:12,113
I just wanted to throw a few balls,
just like I keep saying.

344
00:21:12,196 --> 00:21:13,906
You go bowling often,
Mr. Healy?

345
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:15,950
When the mood hits.

346
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,452
And the deceased,
he had no motive that you recall?

347
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:20,121
(Exhales deeply)

348
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:21,288
No.

349
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:24,000
You didn't provoke him
intentionally or otherwise?

350
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,252
Are we breaking for lunch
anytime soon?

351
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,756
Are you at all afraid of what might happen
if we lose this case, Mr. Healy?

352
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:32,174
No.

353
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:35,887
Are you?

354
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:37,847
(Foggy breathing deeply)

355
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,808
Matt, a word, please?

356
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,483
(Matt clears throat)

357
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,486
We should not be doing this.

358
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:54,489
- Doing what?
- Defending professional criminals.

359
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,323
You're the one that keeps saying
we need real clients.

360
00:21:56,407 --> 00:22:00,327
That's not a client.
It's a shark in a skin suit.

361
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:01,746
You pegged it
back at the office.

362
00:22:01,829 --> 00:22:03,330
There's something off
about this whole thing.

363
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:04,624
We agreed to represent him, Foggy.

364
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:07,919
We're gonna try this case
and let the jury take it from there.

365
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:09,545
Mr. Healy...

366
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,547
Uh...
(Clears throat)

367
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:16,302
I suggest we waive
criminal procedure law 180.80,

368
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,763
give the DA more time
to explore a plea.

369
00:22:18,846 --> 00:22:19,847
In the meantime,

370
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:23,142
the best thing for you to do
is to be forthcoming with us.

371
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,393
Together, we'll confront the charges

372
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:28,773
honestly, openly and within
the moral confines of the law.

373
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:30,191
Does that sound good to you?

374
00:22:30,274 --> 00:22:31,400
(Sighs)

375
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,609
No.

376
00:22:32,694 --> 00:22:35,571
- Excuse me?
- I want the 180.80 date.

377
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:39,241
If I'm indicted,
which we know I will be,

378
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:42,661
we'll waive all hearings and discovery
and go directly to trial.

379
00:22:44,538 --> 00:22:46,665
Not my first rodeo, remember?

380
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:48,584
You'll need to testify.

381
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,838
I'm just gonna have faith
in our judicial system...

382
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:55,132
and you're gonna do your jobs.

383
00:22:56,884 --> 00:22:58,928
- That simple?
- That simple.

384
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,013
And, uh...

385
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:04,100
as for the man who hired you...

386
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:06,811
all you need to know is...

387
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:08,855
his check's gonna clear.

388
00:23:30,126 --> 00:23:31,668
Wait your turn, man.

389
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,269
I got next.

390
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,116
- Hi.
- Hi.

391
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:08,932
(Foggy) You wanna tell me
what the hell's going on with you?

392
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:11,417
First you decide
we're taking the case unilaterally

393
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,505
and then you cross-examine the guy
like we're playing bad cop/worse cop.

394
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,133
If we want to keep the lights on,
we gotta take some cases for the money.

395
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:20,551
You were right about that.

396
00:24:20,634 --> 00:24:21,635
Okay, for the record,

397
00:24:21,718 --> 00:24:24,346
this is the first time
you've ever said I was right.

398
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,514
I hate it.

399
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,892
Sometimes, we have to
do things we aren't proud of.

400
00:24:27,975 --> 00:24:32,021
Yeah, but... this can't
become what we do.

401
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,232
Yeah, I know.

402
00:24:35,316 --> 00:24:37,651
And we have to be on the same team,
making decisions together.

403
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:40,404
I got carried away.
I'm sorry, Foggy.

404
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:41,906
It's okay.

405
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:48,871
- So?
- Okay.

406
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:51,540
So assuming he's indicted,
which, yeah,

407
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,918
it's on the DA to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

408
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:56,128
that it wasn't self-defense,

409
00:24:56,212 --> 00:24:57,463
shoe girl's DD-5 says that

410
00:24:57,546 --> 00:24:59,924
she didn't come out of the back room
until after the fight had started,

411
00:25:00,007 --> 00:25:01,217
which helps us.

412
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,343
And what about Prohaszka's men?

413
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:04,636
They lawyered up.
Wouldn't give a five.

414
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,014
Since when do the victims of an assault
not give a statement?

415
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:08,557
Another chit in our favor.

416
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,476
Plus Healy's pretty banged up.

417
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,685
Argue defensive wounds,

418
00:25:11,768 --> 00:25:15,064
which makes it look more like a fight
and less like an execution.

419
00:25:16,398 --> 00:25:18,609
So, you open, I'll sum up.

420
00:25:18,692 --> 00:25:20,027
And we should cash that check,

421
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:23,072
have Karen see what she can find out
about Confederated Global.

422
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,323
Right.

423
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,619
Where the hell is she?

424
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:31,288
(Man)
It's a fairly simple form.

425
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:32,831
Here you agree, in writing,

426
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:36,460
to never again disclose information
regarding your former employer,

427
00:25:36,543 --> 00:25:39,213
the dissolved entity known as
Union Allied Construction,

428
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:41,715
or any of its affiliates.

429
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:43,259
Upon execution of this agreement,

430
00:25:43,342 --> 00:25:45,469
the corporate interests,
as they currently exist,

431
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:48,055
agree not to pursue
legal action against you.

432
00:25:48,139 --> 00:25:49,140
Against me?

433
00:25:49,223 --> 00:25:51,183
Well, you signed
a non-disclosure agreement

434
00:25:51,267 --> 00:25:53,019
the day you were hired, Miss Page.

435
00:25:53,102 --> 00:25:54,103
Everybody did.

436
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:58,190
Not everyone broke that agreement
and distributed confidential information.

437
00:25:58,274 --> 00:26:01,068
I... I exposed criminal activity.

438
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:04,655
And had you taken that information
to any law enforcement agency,

439
00:26:04,738 --> 00:26:06,178
your rights may have been protected,

440
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,953
but instead... you went to
the New York Bulletin,

441
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:13,622
a privately-owned
news organization.

442
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,000
I had nothing to do
with that article.

443
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:19,628
So the file you illegally removed
from the premises of Union Allied

444
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,756
wasn't the same one
Mr. Urich refers to in this?

445
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:28,595
You see how this
complicates things, yes?

446
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:34,476
Daniel Fisher was murdered
and your clients...

447
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,729
I assure you that any illegal activity
associated with Union Allied

448
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:40,399
has been dealt with,
thanks very much to you.

449
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,903
You're welcome.

450
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:47,427
If you'd like, you can take these
to your own representatives,

451
00:26:47,489 --> 00:26:50,201
but I'm fairly certain
they'll advise you to sign it.

452
00:26:50,284 --> 00:26:51,827
And as a show of good faith,

453
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:55,372
my clients would like to offer you
a lump sum of six months' salary.

454
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:56,748
For what?

455
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,960
For all your help in the matter

456
00:26:59,043 --> 00:27:01,420
and for any stress
these events may have caused.

457
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:04,048
Stress?

458
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:05,507
Someone tried to kill me.

459
00:27:05,591 --> 00:27:08,760
And while my clients acknowledge
no involvement with that individual

460
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:11,513
or claim legal responsibility
for his actions,

461
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:14,475
they do feel
it's their non-binding moral obligation

462
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,520
to offer you a chance
at rebuilding your life.

463
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:24,818
As long as I keep my mouth shut?

464
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,903
It's a clean slate, Miss Page...

465
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,283
a chance to put it all behind you.

466
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:36,288
Now, isn't that what you want?

467
00:27:46,507 --> 00:27:50,052
Private rooms are hard to come by, Ben.
Especially this time of year.

468
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:52,346
She can't be in a communal.
She needs hands-on.

469
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,098
Yeah, well,
you are lucky after all this time

470
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,599
that they are still
covering you at all.

471
00:27:55,682 --> 00:27:58,144
They said, in some cases,
it's possible to get an extension.

472
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:00,937
(Scoffs) Well, they say a lot of crap.
Mostly just to get you off the phone.

473
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:02,273
I already filled out the forms.

474
00:28:02,356 --> 00:28:04,608
I just need you to approve them.

475
00:28:04,691 --> 00:28:06,818
Yeah, okay.
This is the first step.

476
00:28:06,902 --> 00:28:09,488
There are 1,000 more after this,
and I've got a hospital to run.

477
00:28:09,571 --> 00:28:11,740
If I stop to fill out every appeal,
I am going to be...

478
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,160
They're gonna
cut her off, Shirley.

479
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:16,287
It's not her fault.

480
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:19,748
Come with me.

481
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:23,127
It is not like we are
throwing her out on the street.

482
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,753
(Ben)
Not yet.

483
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:28,799
But the next thing you know,
the communal ward is at capacity,

484
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:31,052
then she gets pushed
to an out-patient facility.

485
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:34,513
I know there's a limit to what you can do,
to what I can afford.

486
00:28:34,596 --> 00:28:39,560
I just want to make sure she can rest,
so she can get better...

487
00:28:39,643 --> 00:28:41,728
so she can come home.

488
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,653
Okay.

489
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,701
Five days.
That's what this will buy you.

490
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,914
- And the appeal?
- No promises, okay?

491
00:29:00,997 --> 00:29:04,168
Now get the hell out of my office.
I have got a measle outbreak to deal with

492
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:06,545
because idiot parents
don't want to vaccinate

493
00:29:06,628 --> 00:29:10,257
and my best nurse is out
with who the hell knows what.

494
00:29:10,341 --> 00:29:11,717
Uh...

495
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,009
What's that?

496
00:29:13,094 --> 00:29:14,761
Cheese blintz from
that place you like.

497
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,514
- You should have led with that.
- That'd be cheating.

498
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:19,141
Yeah.

499
00:29:37,951 --> 00:29:40,579
- Hey. She had a good day.
- Yeah?

500
00:29:40,662 --> 00:29:44,125
She was up half an hour.
Asked about you.

501
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:31,713
(Matt) Let's pull section 35.15
of the Penal.

502
00:30:31,797 --> 00:30:33,089
35.15.

503
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:36,718
Then we'll take our facts
and fit them to the CJI and the statute.

504
00:30:37,761 --> 00:30:39,221
(Sighs heavily)

505
00:30:40,764 --> 00:30:41,765
Got the insights?

506
00:30:41,848 --> 00:30:43,184
It's still loading.

507
00:30:43,725 --> 00:30:46,603
- We need better Wi-Fi.
- We need better everything.

508
00:30:46,687 --> 00:30:47,979
Let's do that.

509
00:30:48,063 --> 00:30:50,816
Let's win cases,
be popular and make money.

510
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:53,694
- It's not about that, Foggy.
- I know...

511
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:57,656
but it could be...
just a little, a smidge.

512
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,328
Hey, uh... Wi-Fi's acting weird.

513
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:04,330
You find out anything
on Confed Global?

514
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,459
Yeah, uh, it's a subsidiary
of a holding company

515
00:31:08,542 --> 00:31:13,422
of a loan-out to a holding subsidiary
and on and on and on.

516
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:16,007
But that dickhead's check
cleared in about two seconds.

517
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,510
There's your money.

518
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:22,806
Bang on the router, will you?

519
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:27,728
Oh, hey, no more long lunches
until this is over, okay?

520
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:30,439
You got it.

521
00:31:35,236 --> 00:31:36,612
(Karen banging on router)

522
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,366
(Beeps)

523
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,038
All right, practice insights for
New York State Penal Law 35.15.

524
00:31:49,875 --> 00:31:52,461
And in the state of New York,
I'll remind you,

525
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:57,924
that my client is not required to prove
that he was justified in his actions.

526
00:31:58,008 --> 00:32:04,431
Instead, it's up to the prosecution
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt

527
00:32:04,515 --> 00:32:07,226
that he was not justified
in defending his life.

528
00:32:07,309 --> 00:32:12,606
And they will come nowhere close
to meeting this burden.

529
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:15,984
At the end of this case...

530
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:20,781
the only verdict that you can render
will be not guilty.

531
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:25,661
(Judge) Members of the jury,
this is an important case,

532
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,955
and I have a few additional comments
that I want you to consider.

533
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,042
If you should fail
to agree upon a verdict,

534
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,835
we will be forced to...

535
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,297
(Heart pounding)

536
00:32:39,841 --> 00:32:41,593
(Watch ticking)

537
00:33:15,752 --> 00:33:18,046
This will all be over soon, okay?

538
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:20,757
Just keep it together till the verdict.
Can you do that?

539
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:25,512
Look, you ask me,

540
00:33:25,596 --> 00:33:27,348
it's almost like
they're doing you a favor.

541
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,478
I mean, you don't want
something like that floating around.

542
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:34,730
(Sighs)

543
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:38,024
Go home.
Get some rest.

544
00:33:38,108 --> 00:33:39,818
You got a big day tomorrow.

545
00:33:56,418 --> 00:33:58,003
(Grunting)

546
00:33:58,086 --> 00:33:59,295
(Groans)

547
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,506
Stay down.

548
00:34:01,423 --> 00:34:02,466
Ahhh!

549
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:03,925
I said stay down.

550
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,218
You son of a bitch!

551
00:34:06,428 --> 00:34:08,389
What do you have on her?

552
00:34:08,472 --> 00:34:09,806
(Panting)

553
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,808
(Groaning)

554
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:14,269
A tape!
There's a tape, okay?

555
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:15,812
What's on it?

556
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:18,064
A mistake she made
when she was 19 and pretty,

557
00:34:18,148 --> 00:34:20,401
something she don't want
her kids to know about.

558
00:34:20,484 --> 00:34:22,361
- You get rid of it.
- I can't.

559
00:34:22,444 --> 00:34:25,656
- (Screaming in pain)
- It's not a discussion.

560
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,199
It won't make a difference anyway.

561
00:34:29,242 --> 00:34:31,036
- Who do you work for?
- I don't know.

562
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,038
- Ahhh!
- I want a name.

563
00:34:33,121 --> 00:34:34,706
There isn't one!

564
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,877
That isn't how this works!

565
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,505
Look, I walk by a building,

566
00:34:41,588 --> 00:34:44,675
if a light's on in the window,
I got a job.

567
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:53,058
Somewhere...

568
00:34:53,141 --> 00:34:55,977
there's another light
in another building.

569
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:59,398
I don't do this.
I'm somebody else's job.

570
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,483
You tell her to get herself
excused from the jury.

571
00:35:01,567 --> 00:35:04,194
Personal reasons,
whatever it takes.

572
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:07,280
After that,
she never sees you again.

573
00:35:08,281 --> 00:35:09,575
They'll kill me.

574
00:35:09,658 --> 00:35:12,703
Then you'd better
leave my city... tonight.

575
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,457
(Grunts)

576
00:35:17,624 --> 00:35:18,625
(Groaning)

577
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:29,094
The court grants the motion
to excuse juror number eight from service

578
00:35:29,177 --> 00:35:33,139
due to extenuating
personal circumstances.

579
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:36,977
The first alternate juror
will replace her.

580
00:35:38,812 --> 00:35:41,314
Would the defense care
to make a closing argument?

581
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:45,777
Yes, Your Honor.
Thank you.

582
00:36:06,172 --> 00:36:07,758
(Heart beating)

583
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:15,932
What the hell is he doing?

584
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:29,404
(Judge)
Mr. Murdock, we're waiting.

585
00:36:30,446 --> 00:36:32,741
Sorry, Your Honor.

586
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:34,409
(Sighs)

587
00:36:34,493 --> 00:36:37,621
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
forgive me if I seem distracted.

588
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:43,669
I've been preoccupied of late
with, uh, questions of morality...

589
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:46,630
of right and wrong,
good and evil.

590
00:36:48,799 --> 00:36:52,886
Sometimes the delineation
between the two is a sharp line.

591
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:55,471
Sometimes it's a blur...

592
00:36:55,556 --> 00:36:58,224
and often it's like pornography.

593
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,811
You just know when you see it.

594
00:37:00,894 --> 00:37:02,228
(People laughing)

595
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:04,648
A man is dead.

596
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:10,862
I don't mean to make light of that,
but these questions...

597
00:37:10,946 --> 00:37:13,949
these questions...

598
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,491
are vital ones...

599
00:37:15,576 --> 00:37:19,580
because they tether us
to each other... to humanity.

600
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:22,040
Not everyone feels this way.

601
00:37:22,123 --> 00:37:25,794
Not everyone sees the sharp line,
only the blur.

602
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,378
A man is dead. Um...

603
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,924
A man is dead.

604
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:33,218
And my client, John Healy...

605
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,386
took his life.

606
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:38,431
This is not in dispute.

607
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:43,478
It is a matter of record... of fact...
and facts have no moral judgment.

608
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:44,730
They merely state what is.

609
00:37:44,813 --> 00:37:47,482
Not what we think of them,
not what we feel.

610
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:49,985
They just are.

611
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:52,821
What was in my client's heart
when he took Mr. Prohaszka's life,

612
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,949
whether he is a good man
or something else entirely,

613
00:37:56,032 --> 00:37:57,075
is irrelevant.

614
00:37:57,993 --> 00:38:03,289
These questions... of good and evil,
as important as they are,

615
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:05,041
have no place in a court of law.

616
00:38:05,125 --> 00:38:07,085
Only the facts matter.

617
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:10,463
My client claims he acted in self-defense.

618
00:38:10,546 --> 00:38:12,382
Mr. Prohaszka's associates have refused

619
00:38:12,465 --> 00:38:13,884
to make a statement
regarding the incident.

620
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:16,219
The only other witness,
a frightened young woman,

621
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:18,972
has stated that my client
was pleasant and friendly,

622
00:38:19,055 --> 00:38:23,226
and that she only saw the struggle
with Mr. Prohaszka after it had started.

623
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:26,146
Those are the facts.

624
00:38:26,229 --> 00:38:28,398
Based on these...

625
00:38:28,481 --> 00:38:30,525
and these alone,

626
00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:33,444
the prosecution has failed to
prove beyond a reasonable doubt

627
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:36,531
that my client was not acting
solely in self-defense.

628
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:39,868
And those,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

629
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,870
are the facts.

630
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:45,123
My client,

631
00:38:45,206 --> 00:38:50,586
based purely on the sanctity of the law
which we've all sworn an oath to uphold...

632
00:38:50,671 --> 00:38:53,339
must be acquitted
of these charges.

633
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:56,384
Now, beyond that,
beyond these walls...

634
00:38:57,678 --> 00:39:01,848
he may well face
a judgment of his own making.

635
00:39:01,932 --> 00:39:03,934
But here...

636
00:39:04,017 --> 00:39:06,394
in this courtroom...

637
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,772
the judgment is yours...

638
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,566
and yours alone.

639
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:24,412
- (Leland) I need to talk to him.
- (Man) He sends his apologies.

640
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:27,082
I don't care about his...

641
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,751
Where is he?
This needs attention.

642
00:39:29,835 --> 00:39:32,295
He's indisposed.

643
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:33,755
With what?

644
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:37,133
Art.

645
00:39:37,217 --> 00:39:38,593
Art who?

646
00:39:39,928 --> 00:39:41,179
Paintings.

647
00:39:42,097 --> 00:39:45,183
- His penthouse is finally ready...
- You're shitting me.

648
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,560
Everything's spinning out of whack
and he's decorating?

649
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:50,897
The situation is under control, Leland.

650
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:53,608
You've lost your strong-arm
and the tape.

651
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:57,821
- You got nothing on juror eight now.
- She's only a piece of the puzzle.

652
00:39:57,904 --> 00:40:00,741
You ever try putting a puzzle together
with a piece missing?

653
00:40:00,824 --> 00:40:03,409
It's damned aggravating.

654
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:05,954
I don't see why we're
going through all of this anyway.

655
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,499
Just get rid of Healy
the way you got rid of the other guy.

656
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:13,754
They find him hanging in his cell,
boom-boom, case closed.

657
00:40:13,837 --> 00:40:17,298
Rance, Fisher, McClintock, Farnum.

658
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:19,425
We've been leaving
a trail of bodies lately,

659
00:40:19,509 --> 00:40:22,763
and trails eventually
lead somewhere.

660
00:40:22,846 --> 00:40:27,809
This... this needed to be handled quietly,
within the confines of the law.

661
00:40:27,893 --> 00:40:30,854
So you hire a couple of
back-door shysters?

662
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:32,939
I know 100 defense attorneys

663
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:35,525
with more experience
than Heckle and Jeckle.

664
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:38,569
(Scoffs)
It's not their experience that matters.

665
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:42,615
They just opened shop
and they're completely clean.

666
00:40:42,698 --> 00:40:46,327
Say that about any of the
other 100 you know? Huh?

667
00:40:47,495 --> 00:40:51,249
Two lawyers...
above reproach.

668
00:40:51,332 --> 00:40:54,085
Self-defense.
No questions, no trail.

669
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:56,087
There's too much light
shining on this.

670
00:40:56,171 --> 00:41:00,133
I can't move on Prohaszka's holdings
until the glare is off.

671
00:41:00,216 --> 00:41:02,510
Get the papers ready...

672
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,846
and let my employer
worry about the rest.

673
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,139
(Sighs)

674
00:41:14,815 --> 00:41:16,107
Mrs. Fisher?

675
00:41:18,193 --> 00:41:19,652
Hi.

676
00:41:19,735 --> 00:41:23,406
- Um, uh... My name's Karen...
- I know who you are.

677
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:29,204
I'm sorry.

678
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:32,874
I know how... hard
this must be for you.

679
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:33,959
(Scoffs)

680
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,170
My husband was found dead
in your apartment.

681
00:41:37,253 --> 00:41:39,881
You have no idea
how any of this is for me.

682
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:43,009
Nothing ever happened
between me and Daniel.

683
00:41:43,093 --> 00:41:46,012
You think I don't know that?
I know how much Danny loved me.

684
00:41:46,096 --> 00:41:48,639
Whatever it is you're after,
Miss Page, I can't help you.

685
00:41:50,266 --> 00:41:51,852
Union Allied?

686
00:41:54,896 --> 00:41:57,273
They offered me money...

687
00:41:57,899 --> 00:42:00,819
a lot of money...

688
00:42:00,902 --> 00:42:05,698
if I sign an agreement to
never talk about what happened.

689
00:42:07,075 --> 00:42:09,410
They offer you something like that?

690
00:42:13,081 --> 00:42:14,415
They killed Danny.

691
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:15,876
They tried to kill me.

692
00:42:15,959 --> 00:42:19,295
And now they just shuffle some papers
and change their name

693
00:42:19,379 --> 00:42:20,839
and they get away with it?

694
00:42:22,007 --> 00:42:24,509
- Let it go.
- I've tried.

695
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:29,014
It just doesn't feel right.

696
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,476
He said the same thing.

697
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,728
A few days before he...

698
00:42:36,396 --> 00:42:41,902
He said something didn't feel right...
at work with the numbers...

699
00:42:41,985 --> 00:42:43,528
and I told him that whatever it was,

700
00:42:43,611 --> 00:42:47,282
he had a responsibility
to do something about it.

701
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,287
I figure I have a couple years
before I explain that part to my kids.

702
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,205
They have to pay for
what they've done.

703
00:42:54,216 --> 00:42:56,017
- They won't listen.
- We'll make them listen.

704
00:42:56,041 --> 00:42:57,918
I already signed.

705
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,463
I have two kids, Miss Page,
and they're all that matter to me now.

706
00:43:04,132 --> 00:43:07,177
If you have anyone
that you care about...

707
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,845
let it go.

708
00:43:22,775 --> 00:43:26,947
Shirley, thanks so much
for pushing this through.

709
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:30,241
I... I owe you one.

710
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:32,243
Okay, thanks. Bye.

711
00:43:41,336 --> 00:43:42,378
(Knocking on door)

712
00:43:42,462 --> 00:43:43,463
(Sighs)
Yeah.

713
00:43:45,131 --> 00:43:47,675
(Karen)
Excuse me, Mr. Urich?

714
00:43:49,385 --> 00:43:50,929
So they tell me.

715
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:52,055
(Sighs)

716
00:43:52,138 --> 00:43:54,140
I read your article.

717
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,810
- About the subway line?
- Uh...

718
00:43:57,893 --> 00:44:00,646
About Union Allied Construction.

719
00:44:01,856 --> 00:44:02,941
I, um...

720
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:07,237
I think there's more to the story...

721
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,614
if you're interested.

722
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:17,413
Please be seated.

723
00:44:30,343 --> 00:44:32,053
(Watch ticking)

724
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:38,101
(Heart pounding)

725
00:44:49,862 --> 00:44:51,072
They're hung.

726
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:54,159
Madam Foreperson,
it's my understanding from this note

727
00:44:54,242 --> 00:44:56,744
that you have been
unable to reach a verdict.

728
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,372
We have not, Your Honor.

729
00:44:59,455 --> 00:45:01,874
Allen charge.
She's sending them back in.

730
00:45:01,957 --> 00:45:03,876
Still split, DA will retry.

731
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:06,003
No, they won't.

732
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:07,255
Will they, Mr. Healy?

733
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:10,216
That was a hell of a speech
you gave, Murdock.

734
00:45:11,384 --> 00:45:13,469
A hell of a speech.

735
00:45:13,553 --> 00:45:14,845
(Judge)
The trial has been expensive

736
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:18,808
for time, effort, money,
and emotional strain

737
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:22,187
to both the defense
and the prosecution.

738
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,771
If you should fail...

739
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:26,941
(Latin music playing over speakers)

740
00:45:41,414 --> 00:45:42,915
(Exclaiming)

741
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,172
(Grunting)

742
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:02,643
(Metal clanging)

743
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:12,922
The man that hired your lawyers,
who does he work for?

744
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:15,132
You think I'm afraid of you?

745
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:18,052
(Screams in pain)

746
00:47:20,513 --> 00:47:21,514
(Groans)

747
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,935
Tell me!

748
00:47:27,687 --> 00:47:28,938
Who does he work for?

749
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,566
- I can't!
- I want a name!

750
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:34,652
(Groaning)

751
00:47:34,735 --> 00:47:36,862
Oh, God! Fisk!

752
00:47:36,946 --> 00:47:39,031
Wilson Fisk!
(Grunting)

753
00:47:40,575 --> 00:47:41,992
(Breathing heavily)

754
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:43,286
(Glass shatters)

755
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:44,787
(Exhales)

756
00:47:46,872 --> 00:47:48,374
(Coughing)

757
00:47:48,458 --> 00:47:50,042
You get in your car.

758
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,845
If I ever see you
in Hell's Kitchen again...

759
00:47:51,877 --> 00:47:53,003
No.

760
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,880
You do not want to test me.

761
00:47:54,964 --> 00:47:57,174
You think this is
still about you?

762
00:47:58,175 --> 00:48:01,221
I gave up his name.
You don't do that, not to him.

763
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:05,766
He'll find me...

764
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,436
and make an example...

765
00:48:09,437 --> 00:48:12,982
and then he'll find everyone
I've ever cared about...

766
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,611
and do the same to them...

767
00:48:19,947 --> 00:48:22,742
so that no one ever does
what I just did.

768
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,328
(Panting)

769
00:48:29,665 --> 00:48:31,501
You should have just killed me.

770
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:36,256
You coward.

771
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:38,383
(Exclaims)

772
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:47,600
(Mumbles)

773
00:48:49,477 --> 00:48:52,104
(Gasping)

774
00:49:01,822 --> 00:49:04,409
(Classical music playing on speakers)

775
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,852
There's an old children's joke.

776
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:35,773
You hold up a white piece of paper
and you ask, "What's this?"

777
00:49:38,443 --> 00:49:40,986
"A rabbit in a snowstorm."

778
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:46,116
You interested or just looking?

779
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:49,244
(Man)
Interested.

780
00:49:49,329 --> 00:49:51,622
People always ask me
how can we charge so much

781
00:49:51,706 --> 00:49:54,667
for what amounts
to gradations of white.

782
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:59,505
I tell them it's not about
the artist's name or the skill required...

783
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:03,258
not even about the art itself.

784
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:07,137
All that matters is...

785
00:50:09,098 --> 00:50:11,141
"How does it make you feel?"

786
00:50:20,526 --> 00:50:22,737
It makes me feel alone.

787
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:40,337
