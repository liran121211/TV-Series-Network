00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,590
(Men talking indistinctly)

4
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:28,679
(Squeaking)

5
00:00:30,055 --> 00:00:31,056
(Guard grunts)

6
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:32,140
(Anatoly grunts)

7
00:00:32,224 --> 00:00:33,434
(Guard speaking Russian)

8
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:36,228
(Door closes)

9
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:40,748
(Vladimir speaking Russian)
Where's Oleg?

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:43,486
It's just us now.

11
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,197
(Vladimir)
We don't need anyone else.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,032
(Anatoly groaning)

13
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:55,038
(Sighs)

14
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,332
Only each other.

15
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:58,834
(Breathing heavily)

16
00:01:04,422 --> 00:01:07,217
Soon it'll just be you, Vladimir.

17
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,263
No, my brother.

18
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:14,475
We leave here together.

19
00:01:15,893 --> 00:01:16,977
Tonight.

20
00:01:19,522 --> 00:01:21,482
Where did you get this?

21
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:24,652
A gift...

22
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:26,570
from Alexei.

23
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,285
The guards shouldn't have
left him for the rats.

24
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,792
Will we see Moscow?

25
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,168
Moscow?

26
00:01:43,211 --> 00:01:45,338
It's a city buried in the past.

27
00:01:45,422 --> 00:01:47,007
(Flesh squishing)

28
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,051
We must look to...

29
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:50,553
the future.

30
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:52,012
America.

31
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,556
Where we will rule...

32
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:55,348
as kings.

33
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,181
- (Bone cracking)
- (Grunts)

34
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,904
(Speaking Russian)
He's here!

35
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:10,864
Who do you think?

36
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:13,033
No, I don't know how he found us.

37
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,828
Where's my brother?

38
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:17,746
Listen, shut up!

39
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,665
Shut up!
I don't care what he told you...

40
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:21,416
get him on the phone!

41
00:02:21,499 --> 00:02:22,960

(Claire)
You've been busy.

44
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,296
Yeah. Ow.

45
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,547
Sorry.

46
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,885
So, how's that working out for you?

47
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,430
You should see the other guys.

48
00:03:58,513 --> 00:03:59,848
I have.

49
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:03,811
The one you threw off the roof,
at my place?

50
00:04:03,894 --> 00:04:06,772
He's in a coma. Do you know that?

51
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:08,606
Yeah, I heard.

52
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:11,944
How do you feel about that?

53
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,947
I'll live.

54
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,324
- (Clattering)
- Hey! (Hisses)

55
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:19,284
- Get off the counter!
- (Meows)

56
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,412
(Chuckling)
Wow, you don't like cats.

57
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,707
(Chuckling)
I'm allergic.

58
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,376
I was supposed to be coming in,
feeding this guy twice a day

59
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:31,004
while my friend was out of town,

60
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:33,340
not hiding out here
using up all my sick days.

61
00:04:33,423 --> 00:04:34,466
Just a while longer.

62
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:36,969
Just till I know
the Russians aren't looking for you.

63
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:40,931
I'm not the one that looks like
they've been through the grinder.

64
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:43,433
You really need to get
some kind of body armor or something.

65
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,257
It would slow me down too much.

66
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,437
So will a bullet.

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,314
You worried about me?

68
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:52,359
What if I were?

69
00:04:53,235 --> 00:04:56,905
I would tell you I'm a big boy,
and not to be.

70
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,075
Right.

71
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:02,828
That's why you keep ending up here.

72
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,375
Well, maybe I just like
the sound of your voice.

73
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:06,498
Hmm.

74
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,712
So what happens the night you come by...

75
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:13,714
I'm already talking to someone else?

76
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:17,175
- Yeah, (clears throat) it crossed my mind.
- Yeah?

77
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:22,389
Here.
(Sighs)

78
00:05:23,265 --> 00:05:26,143
Um, you shouldn't have.

79
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:28,979
(Matt chuckles)

80
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:31,481
I didn't. The burner's for me.

81
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,525
Memorize the number, put yours in.

82
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,778
Next time I need to come by, I'll call.

83
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:42,951
By "come by," do you mean stumble in,
bleeding half to death?

84
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:45,078
Yeah, something like that.

85
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:49,792
You're gonna get yourself killed.
You really gotta ease up.

86
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,835
No, I can't. (Grunts) Not yet.

87
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:54,922
I can take care of myself, Mike.

88
00:05:55,005 --> 00:05:56,714
- You know...
- It's not just about you.

89
00:06:00,886 --> 00:06:03,096
It's a little more complicated than that.

90
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,058
You ever heard the name Wilson Fisk?

91
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:09,311
No... who's that?

92
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,689
Just a name somebody gave me.

93
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,193
But there's no public record.

94
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:19,779
Nothing on the Internet.
Not one mention of Fisk.

95
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:22,157
Maybe whoever gave you his name was lying.

96
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,492
I would have known if he was.

97
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:25,743
How?

98
00:06:26,744 --> 00:06:28,788
Heartbeat.

99
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:32,250
Right, of course, heartbeat.

100
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,130
So, what, you're just gonna go out there
punching whoever you can,

101
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:40,884
hoping to find somebody
who knows this Fisk guy?

102
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:44,387
Well, apply enough pressure,
someone will break.

103
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:45,638
Sooner or later.

104
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:01,113
(Chatting indistinctly)

105
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,624
- Oof. Those look like they hurt.
- I've had worse.

106
00:07:12,707 --> 00:07:14,417
I know how much your people delight

107
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,669
in extolling the amount of pain
they can endure,

108
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:19,089
but maybe next time you could try ducking?

109
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:23,051
Leland's finalized the paperwork.

110
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,596
Prohaszka's holdings in Kitchen Cab
have been acquired

111
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,724
and transferred via third party
to Veles Taxi.

112
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,603
Your distribution infrastructure
just doubled.

113
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:36,564
Tell your employer we are grateful.

114
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,319
Don't think he really cares at the moment.

115
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,072
You were light again this week.

116
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:45,908
There was a complication.

117
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:47,700
One you assured us you were addressing.

118
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:50,370
Do you know what he was asking?

119
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:52,497
This fool who laid hands on my brother?

120
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,541
- Not my concern.
- (Anatoly) It should be.

121
00:07:54,624 --> 00:07:58,170
He was asking about your employer,
by name.

122
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,632
All the more reason to settle this.

123
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,427
You sneeze, we all catch a cold.

124
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:10,348
Madame Gao and Mr. Nobu
have expressed their disappointment.

125
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:11,849
We have not heard of this.

126
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:15,603
Hmm, that's because we've been
talking behind your back,

127
00:08:15,687 --> 00:08:20,775
about how the Russians can't seem to
handle one man running around in a mask.

128
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,987
I mean, if he had an iron suit
or a magic hammer,

129
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,405
maybe that would explain

130
00:08:25,488 --> 00:08:27,032
why you keep getting
your asses handed to you...

131
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:28,866
We're done here.

132
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:32,162
He's weakened your operation.

133
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:35,165
You think us weak?

134
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:37,834
This isn't personal, Vladimir.

135
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,086
It's business.

136
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,339
Distribution of Madame Gao's product
has been affected,

137
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:45,758
which in turn is causing delays
in other ventures.

138
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:47,844
This is not acceptable.

139
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,930
Fortunately for all parties,

140
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:53,683
my employer has agreed
to help return you to solid footing.

141
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,060
How?

142
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:59,022
By aiding you in certain duties deemed
vital to the continuation of service...

143
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:01,608
He wants to take over.

144
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:07,530
We value the services you provide,
but clearly you need help providing them.

145
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:09,657
We'll all profit nicely
under the new structure.

146
00:09:09,741 --> 00:09:11,909
- How nicely?
- (Speaking Russian)

147
00:09:11,994 --> 00:09:15,205
- Tell Mr. Fisk...
- We don't say his name.

148
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,542
Tell... Mr. Fisk...

149
00:09:20,585 --> 00:09:23,088
that if he wants a pound of flesh...

150
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:26,216
he can come here
and carve it himself.

151
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:35,100
This is an offer, not an order.

152
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:38,603
The choice of how we proceed is yours.

153
00:09:39,604 --> 00:09:41,689
Talk it over with your brother.

154
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:44,276
We'll be in touch.

155
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:52,784
(Speaking Russian)
Prissy little bitch.

156
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,453
Reach out to Piotr.

157
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:56,538
Why?

158
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:58,248
Why do you think?

159
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,667
If Wesley's employer finds out...

160
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,336
His "employer"?

161
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,463
Do you know why Fisk...

162
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,965
doesn't want anyone saying his name?

163
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:10,052
Hmm?

164
00:10:10,135 --> 00:10:13,221
Because it would betray
that he's just a man.

165
00:10:13,305 --> 00:10:15,515
So's the guy in the mask...

166
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,561
and look what he's done to us.

167
00:10:21,729 --> 00:10:22,855
Yeah.

168
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:26,943
What do we know about him?

169
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,070
Nothing.

170
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:31,989
Semyon might have found something...

171
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:34,076
but he sleeps like the dead.

172
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:36,911
Jesus rose on the third day...

173
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,041
Semyon has slept long enough.

174
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:49,716
(Karen)
Did you look at it?

175
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:53,220
(Ben)
Yeah, I looked at it.

176
00:10:54,137 --> 00:10:55,472
(Karen)
And?

177
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:56,764
And...

178
00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:59,559
it's a story I've heard before.

179
00:10:59,642 --> 00:11:02,270
Company gets caught up in a scandal,
files for bankruptcy,

180
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,147
then quietly restructures
under a new name.

181
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:08,110
They killed Daniel Fisher.
They tried to kill me.

182
00:11:08,193 --> 00:11:10,403
I'm still a little unclear on that point.

183
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:14,657
You say here Rance assaulted you
in your apartment.

184
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:18,077
And a man in a black mask saved your life?

185
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:21,998
Yes, but he just...
He came out of nowhere.

186
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,501
- And you'd never seen him before?
- No.

187
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,671
- Stranger things, right?
- (Sighs)

188
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,215
(Karen)
Well, what about Rance?

189
00:11:30,298 --> 00:11:33,801
Do you really believe
that he just up and hung himself in jail?

190
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,554
That guard tried to do
the same thing to me.

191
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:37,680
Why don't you ask him?

192
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:39,266
Farnum?

193
00:11:39,349 --> 00:11:40,475
He's dead.

194
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:43,436
Ate the barrel of his gun in his basement.

195
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,854
And your old boss, McClintock?

196
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,899
Overdosed on pills or some such.

197
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:51,903
You seeing a pattern here, Miss Page?

198
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:55,615
Then why isn't anyone looking into this?

199
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,620
You don't understand how lucky you are.

200
00:12:01,704 --> 00:12:05,500
Count the angels on the head of a pin,
and move on.

201
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:10,547
So they just shuffle some papers
and all this disappears?

202
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:13,090
- Wouldn't be the first time.
- Oh, don't bullshit me.

203
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:18,513
A construction company
is brick and mortar, literally.

204
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:23,185
All right, you cannot just shift
cranes and trailers and office equipment

205
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:26,020
like you can numbers on a page.

206
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:29,732
There has to be a trail
if everything is being liquidated.

207
00:12:32,068 --> 00:12:33,236
(Exhales)

208
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:36,989
Thanks for the coffee.

209
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,076
(Karen)
What?

210
00:12:41,328 --> 00:12:42,787
So that's it?

211
00:12:43,705 --> 00:12:47,584
Stories like this
are built on sources, Miss Page.

212
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:49,544
Credible sources.

213
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,923
I did some digging into your, uh...

214
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:57,677
past activities.

215
00:13:00,722 --> 00:13:02,932
Well, I did some digging, too.

216
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,519
I read every big story with your byline.

217
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:12,024
The VA kickbacks, toxic runoff,
the Teachers Union scandal.

218
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:15,612
Hell, you pretty much
brought down the Italian mob

219
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,780
back when I was in diapers.

220
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,494
What ever happened to that reporter,
Mr. Urich?

221
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,460
He got old.

222
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,130
And a hell of a lot less stupid.

223
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:41,388
(Monitor beeping)

224
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:53,149
(Door opening)

225
00:14:04,994 --> 00:14:06,315
(Anatoly speaking Russian)
My God.

226
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,831
Give me the kit.

227
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:16,255
(Anatoly)
This could kill him.

228
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:20,968
(Vladimir) Semyon's usually the one
we send for this sort of work.

229
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:22,094
(Beeping)

230
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,180
He'd understand.

231
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,977
(Objects rattling)

232
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:32,355
You hear back from Piotr?

233
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:35,080
(Anatoly) Said he'd call
when he had something on Fisk's movements.

234
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,278
Fisk is cautious.

235
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:39,487
If he suspects...

236
00:14:39,571 --> 00:14:40,738
Then what?

237
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:43,825
What are you so afraid of?

238
00:14:45,076 --> 00:14:48,621
We were in that hellhole for three years.

239
00:14:49,539 --> 00:14:51,458
From princes of Moscow...

240
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,959
to shitting in a bucket.

241
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,171
I promised myself if we ever got free...

242
00:14:57,254 --> 00:14:59,466
we'd never lose what we had again.

243
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:00,883
Especially not to pride.

244
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:05,305
Back when we had nothing,

245
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,139
we agreed on everything.

246
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:08,766
(Anatoly sighs)

247
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,852
We've lost our way...

248
00:15:10,935 --> 00:15:12,729
in this land of riches.

249
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,108
Then let's find it again...

250
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:18,818
together.

251
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:20,111
(Sighs)

252
00:15:38,295 --> 00:15:39,631
You sure...

253
00:15:39,714 --> 00:15:41,758
this was epinephrine?

254
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:44,260
(Gasps)

255
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:48,222
Get his tube out.

256
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,643
(Gurgling)

257
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,648
(Wheezing)

258
00:15:56,731 --> 00:15:58,400
Semyon...

259
00:15:58,483 --> 00:15:59,692
It's us...

260
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:01,193
Anatoly and Vladimir.

261
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,363
That's it...

262
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:05,615
Breathe...

263
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:07,283
Breathe...

264
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,454
And tell us about the man
who did this to you.

265
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,748
The devil.

266
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,042
The devil.

267
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,754
Did you see anything?

268
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:20,880
Semyon?

269
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,466
Anything that could help us find him?

270
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:26,594
There was a woman...

271
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,348
(Whispering indistinctly)

272
00:16:37,522 --> 00:16:39,106
Get Sergei on the phone.

273
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:06,050
Hola.

274
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:08,678
Hola.

275
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:16,686
(Wesley)
Anatoly may be the way in.

276
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,897
He seems more amenable to the proposition,

277
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:24,902
or at least not quite as...
vitriolic as his brother.

278
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:27,614
Well, confrontations can be expensive.

279
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:31,242
I'd prefer to handle this quietly.

280
00:17:32,535 --> 00:17:34,621
How are we on the timeline?

281
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,249
Within a reasonable margin.

282
00:17:38,332 --> 00:17:40,752
Assuming we can settle
with the Russians quickly.

283
00:17:40,835 --> 00:17:43,170
We will. One way or another.

284
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:46,340
What about the masked idiot?

285
00:17:48,342 --> 00:17:49,677
(Sighs)

286
00:17:50,845 --> 00:17:55,141
If the brothers can't handle him,
I'll find another solution.

287
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,402
No.

288
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:11,282
You stay with the car.

289
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:13,200
Sir...

290
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,870
I need to attend to this alone.

291
00:18:19,874 --> 00:18:21,333
Thank you, Wesley.

292
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,002
Well, hello there.

293
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,420
- Hello.
- (Chuckles)

294
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:10,174
How are you enjoying
"rabbit in a snowstorm"?

295
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,468
You remember.

296
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:16,055
Of course...
It's one of my favorite pieces.

297
00:19:16,138 --> 00:19:18,349
I hung it in my bedroom.

298
00:19:19,767 --> 00:19:22,394
It's the last thing I see every night.

299
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:28,275
That's either very romantic or very sad.

300
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:30,945
- I like to tell myself it's the former.
- (Chuckling)

301
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:33,072
Don't we all?

302
00:19:33,155 --> 00:19:34,531
I wanted...

303
00:19:36,367 --> 00:19:39,787
I wanted to thank you for it...
personally.

304
00:19:41,163 --> 00:19:44,792
That's really not necessary,
but you're welcome.

305
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,335
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

306
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:47,837
No, I...

307
00:19:50,673 --> 00:19:55,094
Yes, I was actually wondering
if you cared to join me for dinner.

308
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:57,388
I'm the only one working here tonight.

309
00:19:58,389 --> 00:19:59,807
That's okay.

310
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:03,603
- Another time then.
- Mmm-hmm.

311
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,272
That's it?

312
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,524
(Woman chuckles)

313
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:11,193
You're not gonna offer
to buy every painting in here

314
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:12,820
so I can close up early?

315
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:15,114
A guy actually tried that once.

316
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,625
A woman that can be bought...

317
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:28,419
isn't worth having.

318
00:20:36,593 --> 00:20:38,805
I'm partial to Italian.

319
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:43,017
- We agree on more than art.
- (Laughs)

320
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:47,939
Vanessa.

321
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:52,985
(Stutters)
Wilson.

322
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:02,912
(Claire blowing nose)

323
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,334
(Meows)

324
00:21:09,126 --> 00:21:10,544
(Sniffs)

325
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:11,671
(Sighs)

326
00:21:12,922 --> 00:21:15,007
Eat it, you little bastard.

327
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,139
(Scraping)

328
00:21:22,974 --> 00:21:24,475
(Rattling)

329
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:52,795
(Chuckles)

330
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:03,824
(Foggy) My mom wanted me to be a butcher,
you know that?

331
00:22:03,848 --> 00:22:05,169
(Matt)
Oh, not the butcher story.

332
00:22:05,182 --> 00:22:08,435
I said, "No, Mom, I want to be a lawyer."
I don't remember what I said next.

333
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,021
No, you never do.

334
00:22:10,104 --> 00:22:13,064
But I'm fairly certain it wasn't about
bailing out a piss-drunk electrician

335
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,108
who nearly burned his house down.

336
00:22:14,191 --> 00:22:15,526
Let's cross.

337
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:18,487
Ed's wife left him, Foggy.
It was an accident.

338
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,074
Admittedly involving
cigarettes and gasoline, but still.

339
00:22:22,158 --> 00:22:24,243
I could be carving my own corned beef.

340
00:22:24,326 --> 00:22:27,579
Making my own pickles,
have a little shop of my own.

341
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:30,332
- You got your own office.
- We have office space.

342
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:34,796
An actual office would involve
plantery and equipment,

343
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:38,132
fax machines or
whatever successful people use.

344
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:41,177
(Chuckles) I don't think they use
fax machines anymore.

345
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,471
How would I know?
Which is endemic to the problem.

346
00:22:45,472 --> 00:22:48,267
Matt, what if we're doing this all wrong?

347
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,061
What if Landman and Zack
was the way to go?

348
00:22:50,144 --> 00:22:52,104
You hated interning there.

349
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:53,772
I hate being broke.

350
00:22:54,544 --> 00:22:56,584
You think Landman and Zack
would have helped out Ed?

351
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:58,110
No.

352
00:22:58,194 --> 00:23:01,155
But they had free bagels...
every morning.

353
00:23:01,238 --> 00:23:04,116
And they had furniture that
didn't smell like a pack of cigarettes.

354
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,493
And elevators...
God, I miss the elevators.

355
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,704
- We're doing good here, Foggy.
- Are we?

356
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,122
Yeah, we're making a difference.

357
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:11,457
(Cell phone ringing)

358
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:15,669
You get a new phone? We afford that?

359
00:23:16,545 --> 00:23:18,672
Hey, one sec.
Foggy, I'll see you tomorrow.

360
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:21,592
It's a girl, isn't it?
You got a new phone just for your girls.

361
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:23,886
- My life sucks.
- Get home safe.

362
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,722
Hey, what's up?

363
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:29,308
- (Grunting)
- Claire?

364
00:23:29,391 --> 00:23:30,392
Claire, can you hear me?

365
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,557
- Claire!
- (Claire screams)

366
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,703
(Breathing heavily)

367
00:23:50,454 --> 00:23:51,663
Claire.

368
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,574

372
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,588
(Man speaking Russian)
Yeah, we have the woman.

373
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:43,465
We're taking her there now.

374
00:24:44,258 --> 00:24:45,551
(Muffled screaming)

375
00:25:06,863 --> 00:25:09,700
5 and now 50.
50 right there, and now 55.

376
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:11,493
55,000 here. Now 60.

377
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:15,456
60,000. Who will bid 60,000?
Do I have 60,000?

378
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,500
55, going once, going twice.

379
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:21,003
Sold for 55,000.

380
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,214
Next up, lot 87.

381
00:25:24,131 --> 00:25:28,094
Liquidation of
Union Allied Construction LLC.

382
00:25:28,177 --> 00:25:31,638
Forty-two desktops
with Thunderbolt display,

383
00:25:31,722 --> 00:25:34,976
14 copy machines, 62 IP phones,

384
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:38,145
as well as supporting equipment

00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:41,565
Estimated value, 540,000.

386
00:25:41,648 --> 00:25:43,734
We'll start the bidding at 70,000.

387
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:45,611
Do I hear 70,000?

388
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:50,992
70,000 right here, and now 75.
75,000?

389
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:52,951
I have 75 over here, and now 80.

390
00:25:53,035 --> 00:25:55,162
Do I have 80,000? 80,000.

391
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:57,331
80,000 in the back, thank you.
And now 90...

392
00:25:57,873 --> 00:26:00,584
Stop what you're doing.
Don't turn around.

393
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:03,754
(Auctioneer) 100,000. Who'll bid 100,000?
Right here, now 110...

394
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:05,464
This is how you get caught.

395
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:08,009
(Auctioneer) 110, and now 120...
110, and now 120...

396
00:26:08,092 --> 00:26:10,052
The hell do you care?

397
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,804
To your right,
a woman in a white blouse.

398
00:26:12,888 --> 00:26:14,556
- Eyes front. Jesus!
- (Gasps)

399
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:18,185
To your left,
a man in a navy blue pinstripe suit.

400
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:20,229
(Auctioneer)
150 now, and 160.

401
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,981
Who are they?

402
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:26,360
Don't know.
But they aren't bidding either.

403
00:26:26,443 --> 00:26:28,320
(Auctioneer)
Who'll bid 180,000? Now 190.

404
00:26:28,404 --> 00:26:30,947
190. 190 here, now...

405
00:26:31,032 --> 00:26:32,116
What do I do?

406
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:35,911
Spend the next hour raising your paddle.
Win something.

407
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,789
One of the smaller lots.

408
00:26:39,748 --> 00:26:42,126
- I don't have any money.
- (Ben) Figure it out.

409
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,919
Meet me at the diner when you're done.

410
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:46,963
How did you know I was here?

411
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:50,717
Ben?

412
00:26:52,053 --> 00:26:53,637
(Auctioneer)
225, now 230?

413
00:26:54,596 --> 00:26:57,433
225 going once, going twice.

414
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,269
Sold for $225,000.

415
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:24,710
Let's go.

416
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:28,130
(Grunting)

417
00:27:31,592 --> 00:27:33,051
(Claire screaming)

418
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,353
It's okay. It's me, Santino.

419
00:27:44,605 --> 00:27:46,085
(Speaking Spanish)
Do you remember me?

420
00:27:46,982 --> 00:27:48,525
Yes.

421
00:27:49,318 --> 00:27:51,862
Claire's been taken
by some very bad people.

422
00:27:51,945 --> 00:27:53,739
I heard them say your name.

423
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,702
I need your help. Please.

424
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:03,707
I didn't say anything.
Not at first.

425
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:07,169
Then they took me up to the roof
like you did with that man...

426
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,963
They told me
if I said anything to anyone...

427
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:12,341
they'd come back for my mother.

428
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,510
Do you know where they took Claire?

429
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:16,094
No.

430
00:28:16,178 --> 00:28:17,596
I'm sorry...

431
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,349
Those men are going to hurt her
because of me.

432
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,809
No, it's not your fault, Santino.

433
00:28:22,893 --> 00:28:24,770
It's mine.

434
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:29,150
Is there anything else you heard or saw?

435
00:28:30,066 --> 00:28:31,985
Anything that might help me find her?

436
00:28:32,903 --> 00:28:35,030
I saw them get into a taxi.

437
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,575
But not in the back, in the front.

438
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:40,952
Like it was theirs.

439
00:28:41,036 --> 00:28:42,913
What was the company?

440
00:28:43,914 --> 00:28:45,291
Did you see a name?

441
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,379
Veles. Veles Taxi.

442
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:56,218
(Soft music playing)

443
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,564
Yes.

444
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,239
I hope you like it.

445
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:27,749
It's delicious.

446
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:30,836
I don't know much about wine.

447
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:33,964
My assistant, he recommended it.

448
00:29:34,047 --> 00:29:35,966
Maybe I should be out with him.

449
00:29:38,219 --> 00:29:40,053
- That was a joke.
- Yes, of course.

450
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:43,056
(Chuckles)
A bad one, but... mmm...

451
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:46,142
You don't do this much, do you?

452
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:47,269
No.

453
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,982
I've been preoccupied...
for a long time.

454
00:29:55,902 --> 00:29:58,364
This is nice.
I didn't even know it was here.

455
00:29:58,447 --> 00:30:00,282
Yes, it just opened last month.

456
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,034
The city's really changing.

457
00:30:03,952 --> 00:30:05,287
Not fast enough.

458
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:07,248
I don't know.

459
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:10,083
Be a shame to see
all the character scrubbed away.

460
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,168
You didn't grow up here, did you?

461
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:13,462
(Laughs)

462
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:15,589
What gave it away?

463
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:22,304
When I was a kid, I used to dream
what it would be like to...

464
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:28,101
to live somewhere far away
from Hell's Kitchen.

465
00:30:28,184 --> 00:30:30,020
Somewhere beautiful.

466
00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:33,940
What made you stay?

467
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:35,526
I didn't.

468
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:39,821
When I was 12 years old, my mother,
she sent me to stay with relatives.

469
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:42,991
Had a farm, middle of nowhere.

470
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,662
Those were good years.

471
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,415
But you came back.

472
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:50,582
Yes.

473
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:56,212
Time and distance,

474
00:30:56,297 --> 00:30:58,465
they afford a certain clarity.

475
00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:01,718
I realized that
this city was a part of me,

476
00:31:01,802 --> 00:31:04,054
that it was in my blood.

477
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:08,350
And I would do anything
to make it a better place...

478
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:10,977
for people like you.

479
00:31:11,061 --> 00:31:12,313
(Chuckles)

480
00:31:17,526 --> 00:31:19,570
To a better place.

481
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,411
(Grunting)

482
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:32,248
(Gasping)

483
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,001
(Coughing)

484
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:37,588
You answer, he stops hitting you.

485
00:31:37,671 --> 00:31:39,965
- Everyone is happy.
- (Breathing heavily)

486
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,258
I told you, I don't know who he is.

487
00:31:43,427 --> 00:31:44,886
(Screaming)

488
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:47,889
Tell me his name.

489
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:52,018
(Mouthing)
I don't know.

490
00:31:52,102 --> 00:31:54,355
He never told me. He never told me!

491
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,690
(Speaking Russian)
Sergei...

492
00:31:56,773 --> 00:32:00,319
Vladimir told us not to kill her
until she talks.

493
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:03,798
(Speaking English)
This gives me no pleasure.

494
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:05,031
It really doesn't.

495
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:07,158
But I have been given a job to do.

496
00:32:07,242 --> 00:32:11,037
So please, answer the questions
that I was told to ask.

497
00:32:13,248 --> 00:32:14,500
(Breathing heavily)

498
00:32:15,792 --> 00:32:19,045
Or I will begin breaking you,
a piece at a time.

499
00:32:20,922 --> 00:32:22,298
(Man speaking Russian)

500
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:25,143
(Speaking Russian)
Mikhail, check the breaker.

501
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:26,637
Check the breaker!

502
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,389
(Man replies in Russian)

503
00:32:28,472 --> 00:32:29,723
(Claire sobbing)

504
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,103
(Man screaming)

505
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,522
(Speaking Russian)

506
00:32:36,605 --> 00:32:37,731
Mikhail?

507
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,401
Mikhail!

508
00:32:40,984 --> 00:32:42,193
(Laughing)

509
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:46,448
You want to know his name?

510
00:32:48,742 --> 00:32:50,285
- Ask him yourself.
- (Metal clanging)

511
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:08,053
(Man screaming)

512
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:09,930
(Gasps)

513
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:11,723
(Man shouts in Russian)

514
00:33:21,858 --> 00:33:23,109
(Grunts)

515
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:31,660
(Grunts)

516
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:33,745
(Object clanging)

517
00:33:53,014 --> 00:33:54,349
(Metal clanging)

518
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,230
(Panting)

519
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:10,281
(Object rattles)

520
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,835
- Up.
- (Yelps)

521
00:34:23,086 --> 00:34:24,295
(Masked Man)
Let her go.

522
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:25,547
(Coughing)

523
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:29,259
(Sergei)
I'm walking out of here.

524
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:31,386
(Masked Man)
No, you aren't.

525
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,057
I'm not playing with you, man.

526
00:34:36,141 --> 00:34:39,394
I'm walking out of here...
I'll blow her brains out!

527
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,563
(Masked Man)
Put the gun down...

528
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:44,608
or I promise you you'll never
hold anything in that hand again.

529
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:45,859
(Speaking Russian)

530
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:47,152
- (Sergei grunting)
- (Claire shrieks)

531
00:34:47,235 --> 00:34:48,319
(Gun fires)

532
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:50,968
- (Bones cracking)
- (Sergei groaning)

533
00:34:52,491 --> 00:34:55,827
It hurts, doesn't it?
Being in pain, being afraid.

534
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:14,429
It's okay.

535
00:35:15,972 --> 00:35:18,099
(Claire sobbing)

536
00:35:18,183 --> 00:35:19,350
I'm here.

537
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:22,646
I have you.

538
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:27,108
(People talking indistinctly)

539
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,174
- You bid on anything?
- Yeah.

540
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:54,302
Some, uh...
office equipment from a realtor.

541
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,887
Nearly as old as I am.

542
00:35:57,681 --> 00:35:58,974
Win?

543
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:01,434
Yeah, 3,500 I don't have.

544
00:36:01,517 --> 00:36:04,688
I charged it to the law firm where I work.

545
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:06,815
Probably just got my ass fired.

546
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:09,693
Beats the alternative.

547
00:36:12,215 --> 00:36:14,215
- (Waitress) More coffee?
- Uh, can I have a decaf?

548
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,448
- Oh, sure thing.
- Thanks.

549
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:22,664
How did you know I was gonna be there?

550
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,627
Wasn't looking for you.

551
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:31,840
I thought you weren't interested.

552
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,509
I said you should move on.

553
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:36,803
Didn't say anything about me.

554
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:39,640
So I was right.

555
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:42,392
About the office equipment.

556
00:36:42,475 --> 00:36:45,646
Union Allied or whatever it is
that they're calling themselves now,

557
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:47,272
they're buying it back.

558
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:51,276
I mean, you follow that, maybe
you find the guy behind the curtain.

559
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:53,737
You said you read a bunch of my articles.

560
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,866
Remember the one about the, uh...
the runoff?

561
00:36:58,909 --> 00:37:01,369
What that company
was dumping into the river?

562
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,871
Yeah, sure.

563
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:07,292
Fished the guy that tipped me off
out of that same river a month later.

564
00:37:09,169 --> 00:37:12,673
And that fella trying to
clean up the Teachers Union?

565
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:15,050
Moved out of state...

566
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,844
after flyers went up
saying he was a pedophile.

567
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:23,684
They underestimated what
people in power will do to stay there.

568
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:27,729
Didn't think you'd make the same mistake
after what happened to you.

569
00:37:31,607 --> 00:37:33,526
What about the woman?

570
00:37:34,695 --> 00:37:38,114
From your first series of articles
about the VA?

571
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:39,991
What happened to her?

572
00:37:41,451 --> 00:37:43,369
She met the worst fate.

573
00:37:44,913 --> 00:37:46,539
Married beneath her...

574
00:37:47,623 --> 00:37:50,126
to a workaholic who never appreciated her.

575
00:37:52,253 --> 00:37:54,756
(Sighs)
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

576
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,925
We need to be smart.

577
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:59,385
Smarter than they are.

578
00:37:59,469 --> 00:38:03,932
Don't visit me at the office anymore,
and don't tell anyone else about this.

579
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:08,519
If that doesn't work for you,
get up and get the hell out of my life.

580
00:38:12,065 --> 00:38:13,984
- That works for me.
- Good.

581
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,568
(Clears throat)

582
00:38:15,651 --> 00:38:19,865
First thing, sign the agreement
from the Union Allied lawyer.

583
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:21,199
What? No!

584
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:25,286
No, I sign that,
I can't ever talk publicly about this.

585
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,496
Yeah...

586
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,082
but I'm not signing it.

587
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:34,254
- (Men speaking Russian)
- (Man groaning)

588
00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:40,218
(Vladimir)
Sergei.

589
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,804
(Speaking Russian)
Sergei...

590
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,015
Who did this?

591
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:47,976
The man in black...

592
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,311
- (Clears throat)
- (Cell phone ringing)

593
00:38:51,604 --> 00:38:52,731
(Answering in Russian)

594
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,483
All right. Stay there.

595
00:38:56,609 --> 00:38:57,903
That was Piotr.

596
00:38:57,986 --> 00:38:59,237
Fisk has come out of hiding.

597
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:02,783
We need his help, brother.

598
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:05,994
I will not bow before that man!

599
00:39:09,664 --> 00:39:11,917
Then I will go...

600
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,419
And bow for both of us.

601
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:24,012
Go.

602
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,347
Make the deal.

603
00:39:33,855 --> 00:39:35,398
Are you sure about dessert?

604
00:39:35,481 --> 00:39:37,818
- (Chuckles)
- They have an incredible Zuppa Inglese.

605
00:39:37,901 --> 00:39:40,695
Don't children have that
at birthday parties?

606
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,697
- Yes.
- (Laughs)

607
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:45,116
When I was a kid, I loved it.

608
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,619
Probably loved it a bit too much.

609
00:39:50,496 --> 00:39:53,416
Well, now I have to know
what it tastes like.

610
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:55,168
You wanna split one?

611
00:39:55,251 --> 00:39:56,502
Yes.

612
00:39:58,338 --> 00:40:00,381
- We'll have a Zuppa.
- (Waiter) Yes, sir.

613
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,347
(Whispering)
Chocolate was always my downfall.

614
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,101
Milk chocolate, not the dark stuff
they say is better for you.

615
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:12,643
I can order something else.

616
00:40:12,727 --> 00:40:16,397
No, no, it's good to try new things.
Get out of the comfort zone.

617
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:19,359
Yes, we get caught up
in what we're doing...

618
00:40:21,527 --> 00:40:23,363
who we think we are.

619
00:40:23,446 --> 00:40:24,572
So...

620
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:28,326
who are you, Wilson?

621
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:32,122
Tonight, I'm just a man...

622
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:36,084
enjoying the company
of a captivating woman.

623
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:41,172
(Wesley)
I told you he's indisposed.

624
00:40:41,256 --> 00:40:43,008
(Speaking Russian)

625
00:40:44,384 --> 00:40:46,677
Sir, I need to speak with you.

626
00:40:46,761 --> 00:40:48,179
What is this?

627
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:51,975
We need to go... now.
I'm sorry.

628
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:54,519
I want to tell you, my brother and I,
we gratefully accept...

629
00:40:54,602 --> 00:40:57,063
(Fisk)
Wesley will take care of you.

630
00:40:57,147 --> 00:40:58,648
(Whispering)
Put him in a car.

631
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:00,108
Understood.

632
00:41:03,611 --> 00:41:05,906
(Karen)
Promise you won't get mad.

633
00:41:06,614 --> 00:41:09,993
(Chuckling) You bought a fax machine?
From the early '90s.

634
00:41:10,076 --> 00:41:12,162
Oh, it's not that old... I think.

635
00:41:12,245 --> 00:41:14,622
Um, but the rest of the stuff's
coming tomorrow.

636
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:15,748
The rest?

637
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:18,793
Yeah, like, a printer
and conference phones and a copier and...

638
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:22,547
Yeah, there was an auction and,
you know, we needed stuff, so I, um...

639
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,049
charged it to the office.

640
00:41:24,132 --> 00:41:25,591
But don't freak out, okay?

641
00:41:25,675 --> 00:41:28,261
I got a thing,
some money coming in from...

642
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,181
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

643
00:41:31,264 --> 00:41:32,515
You mad?

644
00:41:34,684 --> 00:41:37,312
I ever tell you my mom
wanted me to be a butcher?

645
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:39,480
A butcher?

646
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,691
Yeah. You know what I told her?

647
00:41:46,947 --> 00:41:49,282
This isn't gonna feel great.

648
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:52,452
Ow.

649
00:41:59,167 --> 00:42:01,794
You got pretty good hands for a blind guy.

650
00:42:03,296 --> 00:42:05,048
Used to patch up my dad.

651
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,468
He ran around in a mask, too?

652
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,512
He was a boxer.

653
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,433
- Took a lot of beatings.
- Huh.

654
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:18,103
So you take after him then.

655
00:42:18,186 --> 00:42:19,354
(Chuckles)

656
00:42:20,355 --> 00:42:21,356
Ow.

657
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:23,274
Shit.

658
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,526
I'm sorry.

659
00:42:26,987 --> 00:42:28,029
(Sighs)

660
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:30,406
It's okay.
You've had a lot worse.

661
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,370
I mean, (stammering)
I'm sorry for getting you into this. I...

662
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:41,501
I never thought that
I'd be putting anyone else at risk.

663
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:45,213
It was my choice.

664
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,883
You didn't ask me
to pull you from that dumpster.

665
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:51,844
No, you did it because
you're a good person.

666
00:42:53,096 --> 00:42:55,140
And you almost got killed...

667
00:42:56,932 --> 00:42:58,268
because of me.

668
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:00,395
Tell me it was worth it.

669
00:43:02,397 --> 00:43:05,984
Tell me that you've got a plan...
an end game.

670
00:43:06,067 --> 00:43:08,528
- Claire...
- Anything?

671
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:11,239
(Sighs)

672
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:14,117
I'm just trying to make
my city a better place, that's all.

673
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,326
(Sighs)

674
00:43:16,577 --> 00:43:19,998
Ow. I think maybe it's a little more
complicated than that now.

675
00:43:21,332 --> 00:43:23,543
Nothing's changing out there.

676
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:28,214
No matter what I do,
I'm just... I'm making things worse.

677
00:43:28,298 --> 00:43:31,842
Tell that to the boy
you saved from the Russians.

678
00:43:31,926 --> 00:43:33,553
Or all the other people you've helped.

679
00:43:33,636 --> 00:43:37,098
And what about the people
I've gotten hurt? What do I...

680
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:38,349
What do I tell them?

681
00:43:44,022 --> 00:43:45,648
Feel my heart.

682
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:49,652
Come on, feel it.

683
00:43:53,531 --> 00:43:55,658
What is it telling you?

684
00:44:01,081 --> 00:44:02,248
That you're scared.

685
00:44:04,459 --> 00:44:05,918
Because I am.

686
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:10,381
More than I've ever been in my life.

687
00:44:11,466 --> 00:44:13,134
And I am not alone.

688
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:17,972
But you can do something about it...

689
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:20,350
for all of us, Mike.

690
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:25,105
Matthew.

691
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,694
My name is Matthew.

692
00:44:42,788 --> 00:44:45,040
- (Fisk) Will I see you again?
- (Sighs)

693
00:44:45,958 --> 00:44:48,794
I don't usually date customers.

694
00:44:48,878 --> 00:44:51,131
You came out with me tonight.

695
00:44:52,047 --> 00:44:54,509
And here we are, so...

696
00:44:55,468 --> 00:44:57,220
I can...

697
00:44:57,303 --> 00:45:00,306
return the painting,
and then I'd no longer be a...

698
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:02,642
I'm not interested in gestures, Wilson,

699
00:45:02,725 --> 00:45:05,102
or your money, or...

700
00:45:07,062 --> 00:45:09,690
whatever that was all about
at the restaurant.

701
00:45:10,775 --> 00:45:13,194
I went out with you because...

702
00:45:16,156 --> 00:45:18,783
there's something different about you.

703
00:45:20,034 --> 00:45:21,786
Not so sure it's a good thing now.

704
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:24,289
Like you said...

705
00:45:25,998 --> 00:45:27,792
I don't do this much.

706
00:45:28,793 --> 00:45:32,880
And I'm sorry that our night,
it went sideways.

707
00:45:34,215 --> 00:45:35,383
But...

708
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,513
I enjoyed our time together
very much, Vanessa.

709
00:45:43,433 --> 00:45:45,518
If you don't feel the same...

710
00:45:46,561 --> 00:45:48,229
even a little bit...

711
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:53,443
just tell me,
and I promise you won't see me again.

712
00:46:02,535 --> 00:46:03,619
I...

713
00:46:05,621 --> 00:46:07,540
don't know how I feel.

714
00:46:27,643 --> 00:46:28,686
(Wesley chuckles)

715
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:32,898
And even after all that, you didn't
even get a name out of the girl?

716
00:46:32,982 --> 00:46:34,024
No.

717
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,778
The man in black
came before our men had finished.

718
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:43,284
You were right to
reach out to us, although...

719
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,328
a call would have been more appropriate.

720
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:48,373
Look, I...

721
00:46:48,456 --> 00:46:51,376
I wanted to speak with him in person.

722
00:46:52,627 --> 00:46:54,962
Try to put the past behind us.

723
00:46:59,509 --> 00:47:00,676
(Brakes screech lightly)

724
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,803
(Anatoly)
Why are we stopping?

725
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,765
They say the past is etched in stone,
but it isn't.

726
00:47:07,182 --> 00:47:10,060
It's... smoke

727
00:47:10,144 --> 00:47:13,147
trapped in a closed room, swirling...

728
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,524
changing.

729
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:20,571
Buffeted by the passing of years
and wishful thinking.

730
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,826
But even though
our perception of it changes,

731
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,620
one thing remains constant.

732
00:47:28,663 --> 00:47:30,331
The past can...

733
00:47:31,457 --> 00:47:34,502
never be completely erased.
It lingers.

734
00:47:37,046 --> 00:47:39,340
Like the scent of burning wood.

735
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:43,553
(Cell phone ringing)

736
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:48,683
Sir?

737
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:51,727
Yes, passenger side.

738
00:47:53,396 --> 00:47:54,980
Was that him?

739
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:56,273
Mmm.

740
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:01,195
He'd like to have a word with you.

741
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,530
(Speaking Russian)

742
00:48:05,157 --> 00:48:06,534
(Both grunting)

743
00:48:09,912 --> 00:48:11,497
(Both grunting)

744
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:27,888
(Speaking Russian)

745
00:48:33,853 --> 00:48:35,053
- (Bones cracking)
- (Shouting)

746
00:48:35,855 --> 00:48:37,523
You embarrassed me.

747
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,317
You embarrassed me in front of her.

748
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:04,967
(Speaking Russian)

749
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:28,949
(Fisk grunting)

750
00:49:38,668 --> 00:49:40,127
(Squishing)

751
00:49:48,678 --> 00:49:49,720
(Exhales)

752
00:49:55,142 --> 00:49:56,519
(Breathing heavily)

753
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,570
(Sighs)

754
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:24,714
Tell Mr. Potter I'll need a new suit.

755
00:50:26,466 --> 00:50:27,592
(Wesley)
Hmm.

756
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,304
What about this?

757
00:50:33,222 --> 00:50:35,808
Take what's left of him
and send it to his brother.

758
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,769
It'll start a war.

759
00:50:40,813 --> 00:50:42,523
I'm counting on it.

760
00:50:53,993 --> 00:50:56,036
