Over here!

00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:11,206
Come on!

9
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,011
Help me.

10
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,804
Get him out.

(Speaking Spanish)

12
00:02:35,063 --> 00:02:36,148
Easy, easy, easy.

13
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:40,193
Okay. Go upstairs...

14
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:41,904
and close the door.

15
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:43,027
And not a word to anybody.

16
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:44,072
(Man)
Si. Okay.

17
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:45,699
Not even your mom.

(Grunting)

24
00:03:52,516 --> 00:03:53,767
No, no calls.

25
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:56,770
- It's okay. I'm just trying to help.
- No.

26
00:03:56,854 --> 00:03:59,294
- We have to get you to the hospital.
- They'll kill everyone.

27
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:03,026
- Who?
- The men who did this.

28
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,571
They'll kill everyone in the hospital
to get to me.

29
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,448
- (Groaning)
- Okay, you can't...

30
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:10,367
Don't. You've lost a lot of blood.
I think you might have been stabbed.

31
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:12,035
I have to leave.

32
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,319
You wanna leave?
Door's that way.

(Commentator 1)
This crowd is not happy, Pete.

35
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:32,890
Murdock has dominated this fight
but now Price has turned the table on him.

36
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,600
He's pounding Murdock's head

37
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:36,935
- and Murdock isn't even defending himself.
- (Commentator 2) Oh! Oh!

38
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,271
(Commentator 1)
Wait! The ref is stopping the fight.

39
00:04:39,354 --> 00:04:41,314
- (Bell dings)
- Canero has stopped the fight.

2-to-1 favorite
"Battlin' Jack" Murdock

41
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:46,028
loses to a TKO in the 10th.

42
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,738
(Commentator 2)
Price looks as shocked as the crowd.

43
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,239
Murdock had him on the ropes

44
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:50,824
but let his glove drop and got tagged

45
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,868
- with a series of devastating...

46
00:05:07,382 --> 00:05:10,343

48
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:39,247
Dad!

49
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:41,959
Hey, Matty! Hey!

50
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:45,212
Hey, hey, don't...
don't get blood on your shirt.

51
00:05:45,295 --> 00:05:46,755
(Jack breathing heavily)

52
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,381
(Matt)
Gotta keep your gloves up.

53
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:51,551
Yeah, well, I... I should
have you in my corner.

54
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,555
- Does it hurt?
- (Sighs)

55
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:57,390
It don't tickle.

56
00:05:57,474 --> 00:05:59,059
Go get the kit.

57
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:05,232
(Matt)
You shoulda had him.

58
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,775
(Scoffs)
Price is a bum.

59
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:10,070
Hey, anybody who's got the guts
to step into that ring deserves respect.

60
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,234
Don't you ever forget that.

61
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,657
- Even Price?
- Even Price.

62
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:17,202
- Sorry you lost, Dad.
- Yeah...

63
00:06:17,285 --> 00:06:18,495
Just wasn't my night.

64
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,332
Easy, easy, easy.
Easy with the cotton swabs there, doc.

65
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,084
Gotta get in there.

66
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,586
You don't want to get it infected.

67
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:29,339
- Stitches?
- Oh, yeah.

68
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,259
You better get the Scotch.

69
00:06:39,307 --> 00:06:40,350
No.

70
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,646
- It's for you.
- (Chuckles lightly) Really?

71
00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:46,106
You think I want your hands shaking
like last time?

72
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,276
This is my face we're talking about.

73
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:51,987
Go ahead.

74
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,739
Take a...
Just a little sip.

75
00:06:58,326 --> 00:06:59,662
- (Chuckles)
- Oh!

76
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,914
Oh, it burns!

77
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:04,750
All right. (Clears throat)
Come on.

78
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,086
Let's do it.

79
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:10,756
(Exhales deeply)

80
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,217
Don't move.

81
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,392
So you watched the fight?

82
00:07:25,062 --> 00:07:27,773
You're supposed to be
doing your homework.

83
00:07:27,856 --> 00:07:29,817
Got it done first.

84
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,234
All of it?

85
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:36,323
I want you to finish up
before you go to bed.

86
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:38,158
- I'll do it tomorrow.
- Tonight.

87
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:41,203
- Before school?
- Tonight.

88
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:43,080
Okay?

89
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,957
- Okay.
- (Sniffs)

90
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,292
All right. Go ahead, go ahead.

91
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,669
(Shuddering breath)

92
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,046
Dad?

93
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:52,923
(Jack)
Uh-huh.

94
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,168
(Matt) You gonna have
enough this month for Mr. Morris?

95
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,890
He will get his rent on time.

96
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:10,774
You got all this for losing?

97
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,611
Sometimes...

98
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:17,655
even when you get knocked down,
you can still win.

99
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,116
It ain't how you hit the mat...

100
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,617
(Both)
It's how you get up.

101
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,369
That's right.
(Chuckles)

102
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,956
All right, all right.

103
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,708
Go hit the books.

104
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,917
Can I take the bottle?

105
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,961
No. Just...
Go on. Go on.

106
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:02,093

111
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:17,925

112
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:19,634
(Clattering)

113
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:27,475
Could you... could you hear me just now?

114
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,021
Nope.

115
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:35,108
The correct answer is,
"Yes, and you sound amazing."

116
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:38,361
Well, (stutters) of the two lies,
I took the lesser.

117
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,738
(Foggy) I thought you went home.
What are you still doing here?

118
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:41,824
(Karen)
Uh...

119
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,201
I could ask you the same.

120
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:48,330
Yes, but I am a partner
at a prestigious law firm

121
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:52,542
with very important documents
needing to be documented

122
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,004
so we can start generating
some revenue, while you are...

123
00:09:58,298 --> 00:10:02,219
also very integral
in your own special, manager...

124
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:04,262
- (Sighs)
- (Chuckles)

125
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,556
I dug myself in too deep
and I can't climb out.

126
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,119
- You need a hand with that?
- Please.

127
00:10:08,183 --> 00:10:11,186
Oh! Not gonna happen.

128
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:13,355
(Foggy) Seriously, what are you
still doing here?

129
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:14,940
I have work to do.

130
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:16,943
(Foggy) What work?
We don't have any clients yet.

131
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:19,319
Well, your shit's not gonna unpack itself.

132
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:23,698
This box of vital import
will be here in the morning.

133
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:27,660
You should be out having a life,
doing poppers and flapper dancing.

134
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:30,788
- I don't know what kids do these days.
- We're the same age, Foggy.

135
00:10:30,873 --> 00:10:32,374
So you're saying
I shouldn't be here, either?

136
00:10:32,457 --> 00:10:34,459
- Yeah.
- Fair enough.

137
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,962
But I'm awkward and unfashionable.

138
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:39,923
Those things don't seem to apply to you.

139
00:10:45,595 --> 00:10:48,223
I just don't feel like
going home...

140
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:49,307
okay?

141
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:53,353
Well, we can't stay here.

142
00:10:53,436 --> 00:10:56,982
Not enough money in the kitty
to keep the lights on past midnight.

143
00:10:57,065 --> 00:10:58,942
So let's hop a few bars,
not think about it.

144
00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,197
Yes. Big fan of the not thinking.

145
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:06,550
- (Foggy) You will fit right in here.
- (Sighs)

146
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:10,745
- Should we call Matt?
- Sure. Yeah, let's see what he's up to.

147
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:12,164
(Siren wailing)

148
00:11:12,915 --> 00:11:14,374
(Breathing heavily)

149
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,355
Are you gonna listen to me this time?

150
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,715
- Where am I?
- You're in my apartment.

151
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,800
Who are you?

152
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:26,970
I'm the lucky girl
who pulled you out of the garbage.

153
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:31,016
- You've seen my face.
- Yeah.

154
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,811
Great.

155
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,479
Your outfit kind of sucks, by the way.

156
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,982
Yeah, it's a work in progress.
(Groaning)

157
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,734
Okay, I really wouldn't try
to move too much.

158
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:44,279
You've got two or three broken ribs,

159
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:47,991
probable concussion,
some kind of puncture wound,

160
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,118
and that's just the stuff
that I know about.

161
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:51,494
And your eyes,

162
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,456
they're nonresponsive to light,
which isn't freaking you the hell out,

163
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:57,625
so either you're blind
or in way worse shape than I thought.

164
00:11:57,709 --> 00:11:59,169
Do I have to pick one?

165
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:03,131
Do you mind telling me
how a blind man in a mask

166
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,935
ends up beaten half to death
in my dumpster?

167
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,528
The less you know about me, the better.

168
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:12,557
(Sighs deeply)

169
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:16,353
The wound on your side... knife?

170
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,729
Probably. Ah!

171
00:12:17,812 --> 00:12:20,815
- (Groaning)
- I think I got the bleeding stopped,

172
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:24,694
but I can't tell how bad it is internally
without a full series of X-rays, so...

173
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,989
No. No hospitals.

174
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,782
This is my night off.

175
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:31,826
I'm really not looking for
some guy to die on my couch.

176
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:32,910
Are you a doctor?

177
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:35,830
Something like that.

178
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,127
Most people, they find
a bleeding masked man in the garbage...

179
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,711
- they call the police.
- (Sighs)

180
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,515
- You got a lot of experience in this area?
- Why are you helping me?

181
00:12:47,675 --> 00:12:49,427
The less you know about me,
the better.

182
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:51,221
(Chuckles)
Ah.

183
00:12:53,015 --> 00:12:54,266
(Breathing heavily)

184
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:56,518
You got a name at least?

185
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:03,608
(Sighs)
Claire.

186
00:13:08,071 --> 00:13:09,531
Don't suppose I get to know yours?

187
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,703
All right, I'll call you Mike.

188
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:19,041
- Mike?
- Yeah, a guy I used to date.

189
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:22,085
Turns out he was very good
at keeping secrets, too.

190
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:32,470
Thank you, Claire.

191
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:34,639
(Sighs)

192
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:41,020
Rest. Make sure you're stabilized.
We'll figure the other stuff out later.

193
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,984
(Young Matt groaning)

194
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:51,531
- (Continues groaning)
- (Machine beeping)

195
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:55,785
I can't see!

196
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,745
- (Breathing heavily)
- Matty, Matty, Matty, it's me.

197
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:59,122
It's Dad. I'm right here.

198
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,748
(Jack shushing)

199
00:14:00,832 --> 00:14:02,167
(Stuttering)
I can't see.

200
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,793
You were in an accident,
you remember?

201
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,002
You're in the hospital,

202
00:14:05,087 --> 00:14:06,963
- but I'm right here with you.
- (Machines beeping loudly)

203
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:10,049
(Sobbing) Everything's so loud.
Everything...

204
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,094
- (Breathing heavily)
- I'm right here with you.

205
00:14:12,177 --> 00:14:15,388
It's Daddy. Here, feel my face.
Feel my face.

206
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:17,890
I'm right here.

207
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:20,643
I'm right here.

208
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,729
- I can't see.
- It's all right. It's okay.

209
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:24,415
- Dad, I can't see!
- It's all right, Matt.

210
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:25,857
- I can't...
- It's all right.

211
00:14:26,608 --> 00:14:28,193
(Gasping)

212
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:32,029
What is it?
What's wrong?

213
00:14:32,114 --> 00:14:34,532
(Gasping)
I can't breathe.

214
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,829
Can't...

215
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:42,999
You've got air in your chest.
It's collapsing your lung.

216
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,417
I'm gonna relieve the pressure,

217
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,628
but I'm gonna need you
to hold still, okay?

218
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,562
Here we go.

219
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,357
- This is gonna hurt.
- (Needle piercing)

220
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,775
(Grunting)

221
00:15:09,401 --> 00:15:10,402
(Gasping)

222
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,112
(Air hissing)

223
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,321
(Sighs)

224
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,366
(Groaning)

225
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,910
(Breathing heavily)

226
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,084
Good.

227
00:15:27,169 --> 00:15:28,920
Just breathe normal.

228
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:32,006
(Claire sighs)

229
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:33,800
(Breathing normally)

230
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,218
All right.

231
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,095
Look...

232
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,392
let's just say for the sake of discussion
I buy this whole,

233
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:45,478
"We can't go to the hospital
because whatever" story

234
00:15:45,562 --> 00:15:47,897
you've got going on.

235
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,399
But we need to talk about what happens

236
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:51,362
if you give up the ghost
here in my living room.

237
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:55,155
Because I'm listening to myself explain
to the police how I let this happen,

238
00:15:55,238 --> 00:15:57,240
and every version
ends with me in handcuffs,

239
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,534
so convince me it's worth it.

240
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,412
They kidnapped a boy.

241
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,788
Who did?

242
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,290
(Breathing heavily)
The Russians.

243
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:09,395
They've been running
a human trafficking ring

244
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:10,420
out of Hell's Kitchen.

245
00:16:11,921 --> 00:16:14,257
Took over when the Italians folded up.

246
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:18,720
Two days ago, they pulled a kid
out of the back of a van.

247
00:16:18,803 --> 00:16:20,124
Beat his father while he watched.

248
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:21,306
Jesus.

249
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,517
I knew the kid would still be alive.

250
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:27,019
At least until
they took him out of the city.

251
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:32,275
I tracked the Russians
to a warehouse not far from here.

252
00:16:33,193 --> 00:16:35,945
Thought I was being smart,
how fast I found them.

253
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,948
Turns out, I wasn't.

254
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:43,828
They were waiting for you.

255
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,206
And I walked right into it.

256
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,835
So, they took this kid just to get to you?

257
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,963
Yeah, I've been making their lives...

258
00:16:54,589 --> 00:16:57,259
(breathing heavily)
difficult lately.

259
00:16:57,342 --> 00:16:58,343
But you're blind.

260
00:16:58,426 --> 00:16:59,552
(Chuckles)

261
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:02,514
There are other ways to see.

262
00:17:02,597 --> 00:17:03,765
This is what you do?

263
00:17:03,848 --> 00:17:06,309
You make life difficult for bad men?

264
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,686
It's one way of putting it.

265
00:17:10,021 --> 00:17:12,232
No offense, but you don't seem
to be very good at it.

266
00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:13,316
(Laughing)

267
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,651
Ow!

268
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:16,694
Yeah, well,
you're catching me on an off night.

269
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:20,490
Did you at least find the kid?

270
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:22,492
(Sighs)

271
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:26,788
No, he wasn't there.

272
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:30,041
I barely made it out myself.

273
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,419
(Sighs)
I was careless.

274
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,921
- (Sighs)
- Stupid.

275
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,259
So these men that took the boy...

276
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:42,762
they're out there right now,
looking for you?

277
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,812
- Mike?
- Someone's coming.

278
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,355
Wait, what?

279
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:55,608
There's someone in the building,
a man, going from door to door.

280
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,485
- How do you know that?
- Shh.

281
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:01,781
He's on the third floor already.

282
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:05,117
Smells like Prima cigarettes
and discount cologne.

283
00:18:05,201 --> 00:18:07,662
- (Grunts)
- You can smell a man on the third floor?

284
00:18:07,745 --> 00:18:08,905
You'll smell him soon enough.

285
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:11,123
He really likes that cologne.

286
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:12,459
(Grunting)

287
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:13,793
(Breathing heavily)

288
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,795
You're looking at me
like I'm crazy, right?

289
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,672
Seems the appropriate response.

290
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:19,716
There are some things
I haven't told you about me, Claire.

291
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,801
You haven't told me anything about you.

292
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:24,387
All I know is you're very good
at taking a beating.

293
00:18:28,057 --> 00:18:30,184
That part I got from my dad.

294
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:33,821
- (Man) Jack, put your hands up.
- (Grunting)

295
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,940
Get in there, come on.
Watch your speed.

296
00:18:36,023 --> 00:18:38,109
Footwork! Footwork, come on.

297
00:18:38,192 --> 00:18:39,694
Watch... Watch out! Oh!

298
00:18:40,695 --> 00:18:41,821
(Bell dings)

299
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,367
Way to take a punch, Jack.

300
00:18:47,744 --> 00:18:49,454
(Speaking Spanish)

301
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,584
Hey, Jack, shake it off.
You're looking good.

302
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:56,043
Hey, Jack, what's up?

303
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,171
(Indistinct talking)

304
00:18:59,255 --> 00:19:00,715
- (Matt) How'd you do?
- Uh...

305
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,678
I tagged him a couple times.
That kid is fast.

306
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:09,724
So, how you... how you getting along
with your new books?

307
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:10,850
I'm working on it.

308
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,185
Each grid is six possible dots,

309
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:16,022
so each letter
is a combination of those dots.

310
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:18,483
You have to feel for what's not there
as much as what is.

311
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:21,110
That doesn't make any damn sense at all.

312
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,988
Well, you know where a punch is going
before it's thrown sometimes, right?

313
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,948
- Oh, clearly I don't.
- (Both chuckle)

314
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:28,701
So, uh,
you can make sense out of all of this?

315
00:19:28,785 --> 00:19:30,828
- I'm starting to. Here.
- Hmm.

316
00:19:30,912 --> 00:19:33,706
Dot in the right corner,
that's a "C."

317
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,500
Upper left, "A."

318
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,960
"T" is hard. I get it confused with "Q."

319
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:39,754
Well, why don't they just
make it feel like a "T"?

320
00:19:39,837 --> 00:19:42,715
Well, they say this is faster
once you get the hang of it.

321
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,717
"W" is really tricky.

322
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:47,804
Braille was created in French,
and they don't have "W."

323
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:50,432
Oi, Battlin' Jack!

324
00:19:50,515 --> 00:19:51,599
(Sighs)

325
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:55,954
Hey, you wait. Couple months,

326
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:58,064
you're gonna be reading Braille
faster than I read normal.

327
00:19:58,147 --> 00:20:00,107
- I already read Braille faster.
- (Chuckles)

328
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:03,403
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
You smartass.

329
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:07,865
- I'll be right back.
- (Coaches chattering)

330
00:20:09,158 --> 00:20:10,159
(Man 1 laughs)

331
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,413
- That's what I'm talking about.
- (Man 1) What's the word, Jackie-boy?

332
00:20:13,496 --> 00:20:15,540
Roscoe. Silke.

333
00:20:15,623 --> 00:20:17,083
Hello, Jack.

334
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:20,169
I heard about the wee one.
That's a tough break.

335
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,840
- (Silke) You have our condolences.
- (Roscoe) And you're young yet.

336
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,925
Plenty of time to have more kids.

337
00:20:28,886 --> 00:20:30,221
What can I do for you boys?

338
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:33,558
We come bearing glad tidings.

339
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:34,934
A match with Creel.

340
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:38,646
Creel?

341
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,106
How'd you pull that off?

342
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:46,278
Mr. Sweeney can be quite persuasive
when he puts his mind to it.

343
00:20:46,362 --> 00:20:47,822
It's me Irish charm.

344
00:20:47,905 --> 00:20:50,157
Jesus! Creel?

345
00:20:50,241 --> 00:20:51,701
(Jack chuckles)

346
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:55,204
- (Stuttering) I owe you... I owe you guys.
- (Silke) Ah.

347
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,289
You're doing us the favor.

348
00:20:57,373 --> 00:21:00,460
It's 3-to-1
that you go the distance.

349
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:05,632
You drop in the fifth,
we're clearing 70%.

350
00:21:07,383 --> 00:21:09,218
- Right.
- (Roscoe) Come on, Jackie!

351
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:10,762
It's time to celebrate.

352
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:12,388
(Silke)
It's the big time, Jack.

353
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:18,019
Thanks for the offer.

354
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:20,688
- I'm gonna take a pass.
- (Roscoe laughs)

355
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:22,356
Did he just say "pass"?

356
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:24,399
(Jack) I appreciate everything
you've done for me.

357
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:25,610
Really, I do.

358
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:26,861
But...

359
00:21:29,656 --> 00:21:31,908
I got other things
to worry about now.

360
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,994
He don't want to do it, he don't do it.

361
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:39,541
Man makes his choice and we make ours.

362
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:42,293
You wanna step into the ring,
see how that plays out?

363
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:46,213
You gotta think of your family, Jack.

364
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:49,341
This could do a lot of good for your boy.

365
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:51,135
(Roscoe)
Yeah.

366
00:21:51,218 --> 00:21:53,846
What else are you gonna leave him
when you're gone?

367
00:22:01,979 --> 00:22:04,524
- (Jack) All right.
- We need to hear you say it.

368
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:11,280
I go down in the fifth.

369
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,491
There you go.
That wasn't so hard.

370
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,042
(Masked Man grunts)

371
00:22:23,751 --> 00:22:24,794
This all you got?

372
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:27,046
Yeah, it's for vegetables,
not a knife fight.

373
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:29,841
He's at your neighbor's door.

374
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:32,176
You kidding me? Hey!

375
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:35,554
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
You can barely stand up.

376
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:39,141
- That's what the knife's for.
- Wait! Don't do this. Not in my home.

377
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,434
Okay, nobody has to get hurt.

378
00:22:40,517 --> 00:22:43,562
Just stand over there on the side
and be quiet and I'll get rid of him.

379
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:45,022
(Knocking on door)

380
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:46,315
Please.

381
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,735
(Knocking continues)

382
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:49,986
Who is it?

383
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,029
NYPD, ma'am.
Please open the door.

384
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,281
Okay.

385
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:56,784
Go.

386
00:22:58,995 --> 00:23:00,705
I'll be right there.

387
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:09,046
Move over.

388
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,470
(Sighs)

389
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:21,809
Sorry to bother you so late, ma'am.

390
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:24,687
My name is Detective Foster,
with the 65th Precinct.

391
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,522
We had a bit of a disturbance
a few blocks from here.

392
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,983
We're asking everyone
if they've seen or heard anything unusual

393
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,067
in the past few hours.

394
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:33,362
- What kind of disturbance?
- Armed robbery.

395
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:37,199
Some dickhead in a black mask
shot up a bodega on 38th.

396
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:38,575
Owner put up a fight.

397
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:41,412
Perp fled on foot, leaving
a trail of blood in this direction.

398
00:23:41,495 --> 00:23:42,496
Oh, my God.

399
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:45,082
Probably long gone by now,
but just in case, you know.

400
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,543
You see anything,
hear anything tonight?

401
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:50,880
No... sorry.

402
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:53,049
Just being thorough.
You have a good night, ma'am.

403
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,550
Thanks. You, too.

404
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,602
See? No reason to get all stabby.

405
00:24:05,687 --> 00:24:09,398
Boy, were you right about that cologne.
What, does he dip himself in that crap?

406
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,025
He didn't believe you.
(Grunts)

407
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:12,276
(Sighs)

408
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,986
Mike!

409
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:18,783
(Speaking Russian)

410
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,411
(Claire)
What are you doing?

411
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,424
- (Thudding)
- (Breathing heavily)

412
00:24:41,889 --> 00:24:42,974
What do we do now?

413
00:24:44,641 --> 00:24:47,561
There's someone else
one floor up watching us.

414
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:49,731
Oh, no. He's young. He's scared.

415
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,819
(Claire)
Santino?

416
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:58,447
He's the one who found you in the alley.

417
00:25:00,282 --> 00:25:01,617
He's seen my face, too?

418
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,327
Yeah.

419
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,206
Claire, go upstairs and get him.

420
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:10,292
We're gonna need help
carrying Detective Foster to the roof.

421
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,460
(Grunts)

422
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,380
What the hell
are we going to the roof for?

423
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:18,009
Less chance of someone in the building
hearing him scream.

424
00:25:20,677 --> 00:25:22,721
(Rock music playing)

425
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:23,926
(Foggy)
Matt, it's me again.

426
00:25:23,931 --> 00:25:25,057
Where are you?

427
00:25:25,141 --> 00:25:26,475
I'm introducing Karen to Josie's,

428
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,228
and I have high hopes
it's gonna go terribly.

429
00:25:29,311 --> 00:25:31,605
Climb off whoever you're on
and get down here.

430
00:25:33,024 --> 00:25:35,484
You saved the best for last, huh?

431
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:39,405
Oh, yeah, this place is a shithole...
but it's our shithole.

432
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:42,074
The city's tried to shut it down
half a dozen times,

433
00:25:42,158 --> 00:25:45,369
but I helped Josie with the liens,
and as a result, we get to drink for free.

434
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:49,206
You absolutely do not
get to drink for free.

435
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:52,043
Let's agree to disagree.

436
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:55,462
Thank you.

437
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,133
Cheers.

438
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:03,387
Oh!
(Coughs)

439
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,890
You could do so much better, love.

440
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:09,518
Thank you, Josie,
but this is my employee...

441
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,271
for your information,
and we are not on a date.

442
00:26:12,354 --> 00:26:13,940
- Are we on a date?
- Definitely not.

443
00:26:14,023 --> 00:26:15,274
Okay, good...

444
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:17,776
because I was starting to worry
you might be in love with me.

445
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,030
What other explanation could there be?
You hang around my office all day.

446
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,781
Well, I'm your secretary, Foggy.

447
00:26:22,865 --> 00:26:25,492
You refuse to leave.
You're always at your desk.

448
00:26:25,576 --> 00:26:27,203
- I'm a good secretary!
- No.

449
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:29,831
You gaze at me lovingly
when you think I'm not looking.

450
00:26:29,914 --> 00:26:30,915
(Chuckles)

451
00:26:30,998 --> 00:26:34,001
What? You might.
How would I know? I'm not looking.

452
00:26:34,085 --> 00:26:35,336
Just let me live in it.

453
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:38,422
Oh.

454
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:45,012
- Is there something in there?
- (Clicks tongue)

455
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:47,639
I... think that's an eel.

456
00:26:50,351 --> 00:26:52,854
- Really?
- Let's get to the bottom and find out.

457
00:27:05,616 --> 00:27:06,658
(Sighs)

458
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:08,452
So you wanna talk about it?

459
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,957
- (Sniffs) Let's leave it alone.
- Yeah, no problem.

460
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:17,268
Okay, technically, "leave it alone"
is not my strong suit, but...

461
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,171
I can't, um...

462
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,051
I can't get Danny's blood
out of the carpet.

463
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:29,723
It's like somebody spilled a wine bottle
and it just won't come...

464
00:27:32,726 --> 00:27:37,148
And a man broke into my apartment
and tried to kill me.

465
00:27:38,315 --> 00:27:41,485
He dented the wall
where he bashed my head into it.

466
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:47,866
If that guy in the mask
hadn't have been there...

467
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,663
(Sighs)

468
00:27:52,746 --> 00:27:56,167
My cousin does drywall.
I'll call him first thing in the morning.

469
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,460
It's not the apartment, Foggy.

470
00:27:58,544 --> 00:28:00,004
I know.

471
00:28:00,963 --> 00:28:03,382
I don't see the city anymore.

472
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:08,637
All that I see are its...

473
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,139
dark corners.

474
00:28:12,433 --> 00:28:15,978
I look around this room
and all that I see are threats.

475
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:18,480
This room?
(Scoffs)

476
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:19,941
These guys are harmless.

477
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,903
Look, that's Tom Belkin.

478
00:28:24,987 --> 00:28:27,031
He's the Road Captain
in the Kitchen Hellions.

479
00:28:27,114 --> 00:28:29,866
He organizes the food drive
every Thanksgiving.

480
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:34,371
That's Rob Donohue.

481
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:35,456
His wife Mira...

482
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:38,250
she works at the dry cleaner
around the corner from our office.

483
00:28:39,793 --> 00:28:42,671
That's Clint Peterson. He...

484
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,506
Okay, he is a criminal.

485
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,343
He's done time
for larceny and distribution.

486
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,635
But he's turning it around,

487
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:52,014
and we are this close to getting his kids
into Saint Agnes Daycare.

488
00:28:53,015 --> 00:28:54,433
Saint Agnes!

489
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,353
(Karen sighs)

490
00:28:58,895 --> 00:28:59,981
Okay.

491
00:29:00,064 --> 00:29:02,608
You don't want to go home,
you don't want to go home.

492
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,069
We can stay out all night.

493
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:13,410
(Sighs heavily)

494
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:17,414
(Grunts)

495
00:29:18,165 --> 00:29:19,375
(Masked Man grunting)

496
00:29:22,669 --> 00:29:23,920
(Breathing heavily)

497
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:28,675
(Masked Man)
You find anything?

498
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,053
You smashed the hell out of it
with that extinguisher.

499
00:29:32,346 --> 00:29:33,973
He had a badge.

500
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,643
- What if you're wrong?
- I'm not.

501
00:29:39,728 --> 00:29:43,690
- This is way past what I signed up for.
- What exactly do you think that was?

502
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:48,695
I found a man who needed help,
so I helped him.

503
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:49,780
Oh, yeah? That simple?

504
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,990
Do you really want to
get into this in front of him?

505
00:29:55,995 --> 00:29:58,205
He's out.

506
00:29:58,289 --> 00:29:59,373
Maybe he's faking.

507
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,376
He's not.

508
00:30:02,459 --> 00:30:05,796
Okay, that right there,
that's what I'm talking about.

509
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:07,964
Okay, I find a guy in a dumpster

510
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:09,929
who turns out to be
some kind of blind vigilante

511
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,760
who can do all of this really weird shit

512
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,929
like smell cologne through walls

513
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,640
and sense whether
someone's unconscious or faking it.

514
00:30:16,723 --> 00:30:19,226
Slap on top of that, he can take
an unbelievable amount of punishment

515
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,436
without one damn complaint.

516
00:30:21,312 --> 00:30:23,439
- The last part's the Catholicism.
- So, what?

517
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:26,002
I'm supposed to take it on faith
I'm on the right side of this?

518
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,360
You don't carry a masked man
bleeding to death

519
00:30:28,444 --> 00:30:30,654
into your apartment on faith.

520
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:34,491
You knew which side you were on
the moment you found me.

521
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:37,161
Why'd you help me, Claire?

522
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:42,916
I'm a nurse.

523
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:45,294
Work the ER at Metro-General.

524
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:48,004
A few weeks ago,
cops bring in three men.

525
00:30:49,005 --> 00:30:51,967
Said they were robbing tourists,
beating them up pretty bad.

526
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,763
Apparently, a man in a black mask
took issue with their activities

527
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:59,225
and decided to step in.

528
00:30:59,308 --> 00:31:02,103
I counted nine broken bones between them.

529
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:09,651
A few days after that, EMTs
bring in a 19-year-old waitress, said...

530
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:13,780
some guy she knew waited for her
after work in the parking lot,

531
00:31:13,864 --> 00:31:17,076
attacked her...
tried to drag her in the alley.

532
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,789
She said she screamed and screamed,
and a man in a black mask heard her...

533
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,253
and he saved her life.

534
00:31:30,381 --> 00:31:32,216
So, yeah, word's getting around.

535
00:31:34,426 --> 00:31:36,720
And I want to believe
in what you're doing.

536
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:38,555
I really do.

537
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:39,931
But this?

538
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:42,226
(Claire scoffs)

539
00:31:44,686 --> 00:31:46,480
I know you're afraid.

540
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:48,482
(Grunts)

541
00:31:52,278 --> 00:31:54,530
You can't give in to the fear.

542
00:31:55,697 --> 00:31:57,116
If you do...

543
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,993
men like this win.

544
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:04,623
(Young Matt) "There is a price to be paid
for division and isolation."

545
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,252
Democracy cannot flourish amid hate.

546
00:32:08,335 --> 00:32:10,754
Justice cannot take root amid rage.

547
00:32:10,837 --> 00:32:13,424
We must dissent from the indifference.

548
00:32:13,507 --> 00:32:15,426
We must dissent from the apathy.

549
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,303
"We must dissent from the fear."

550
00:32:17,386 --> 00:32:21,140
Either you're actually reading all that,
or you're making it up as you go along.

551
00:32:21,223 --> 00:32:22,743
I don't know which is more impressive.

552
00:32:22,808 --> 00:32:24,435
- It's Thurgood Marshall.
- Hmm.

553
00:32:24,518 --> 00:32:27,229
Starting centerfielder
for the Mets, right?

554
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,105
You know who Thurgood Marshall is.

555
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,400
(Grunting)
School wasn't my strong suit.

556
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:33,735
(Sighs)

557
00:32:37,823 --> 00:32:38,865
(Whistles)

558
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:40,576
- How's it look?
- It's...

559
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:42,786
it's red.

560
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,789
It's really red.

561
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:47,999
Can I?

562
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:52,087
Yeah.

563
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:11,273
- Good thing about red...
- Huh?

564
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,774
they can't tell
how much you're bleeding.

565
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,444
Hey, who says I'm even gonna get hit?

566
00:33:16,445 --> 00:33:18,822
We're Murdocks.
We get hit a lot.

567
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:26,830
- Yeah... I guess we do.
- But we get up.

568
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:30,209
Right, Dad?

569
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,836
We always get up.

570
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:43,054
(Coin dropping into payphone)

571
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:44,806
(Dialing)

572
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:50,354
- Hey, it's Jack.
- (Man) Hey, Jack.

573
00:33:50,437 --> 00:33:52,398
- Too late to change it?
- You can change it.

574
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:55,776
Good. All on me.
Win by knockout.

575
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,861
- You sure?
- Yeah.

576
00:33:57,944 --> 00:33:59,905
Yeah, I'm sure.
Listen, you gotta do this quick.

577
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:03,700
Cash out the second Creel hits the mat.
Don't wait. Okay, get a pen.

578
00:34:03,784 --> 00:34:05,160
All right. Got it.

579
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:10,081
You're gonna take the money down to
Lloyd Wagner at M and R Credit Union.

580
00:34:11,124 --> 00:34:18,006
You're gonna deposit it into
account number 004-82-56-882.

581
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:20,676
- Account's in your name?
- No, no, not under my name.

582
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,762
- It's under Matthew Murdock.
- Matthew. Got it.

583
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,222
Yeah, thanks.
Thanks, Ed.

584
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,387
You're gonna want to lay low
for a couple days after.

585
00:34:28,392 --> 00:34:29,476
Can I do anything for you?

586
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,438
Nah, don't worry about me.
I got it covered.

587
00:34:47,035 --> 00:34:48,244
(Line ringing)

588
00:34:49,616 --> 00:34:52,016
(Woman over answering machine)
Hi. Not here. Leave a message.

589
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,041
(Machine beeps)

590
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:54,543
Hey, it's, uh...

591
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:55,919
it's me.

592
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:00,716
I'm about to go do something... Well...

593
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,634
I'm about to go be me.

594
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:07,514
You know better than anybody
that doesn't always go so well.

595
00:35:08,515 --> 00:35:12,018
I don't know how this is gonna go,
but if I were a betting man...

596
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:15,481
Matty's gonna need you.
More than ever.

597
00:35:17,441 --> 00:35:18,734
Look after him, okay?

598
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:22,278
And I know what I'm asking here,
but he's a good kid.

599
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,157
He sure as hell didn't get that from me.

600
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:27,409
So...

601
00:35:29,285 --> 00:35:31,079
It's better this way.

602
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:34,541
Just once...

603
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:39,838
I want Matty to hear people
cheer for his old man.

604
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,342
Just once.

605
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,105
Matt!

606
00:35:57,188 --> 00:35:59,441
Matt, come on!
Get up!

607
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:01,777
- I drank the eel.
- (Laughing)

608
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,278
- Oh, no.
- Not a euphemism.

609
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,780
(Both laughing)

610
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,023
Matt, I know you're in there!

611
00:36:06,072 --> 00:36:07,449
- Get up!
- Shh.

612
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:09,242
- Here, you talk to him.
- Okay.

613
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:11,327
- (Whispering) Pretend I'm not here.
- Okay.

614
00:36:11,412 --> 00:36:12,913
Matt!

615
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:19,044
Matt, it's Karen...
and I am... very, very sorry about this,

616
00:36:19,127 --> 00:36:22,506
and if I were you,
I would not come to this door.

617
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,260
(Chuckling)
But I think I also drank the eel.

618
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:30,889
And we are now filled
with mighty eel strength!

619
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:33,016
- Matt!
- It's true. Matt, come on!

620
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,101
- Come on!
- Come on!

621
00:36:35,185 --> 00:36:37,813
- We're staying out till the sunrise!
- (Giggles)

622
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,648
We're gonna go to the fish market!

623
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:40,774
(Door opening)

624
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:43,985
Oh, no. Oh, Foggy.

625
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:46,321
- Oh, hi, Fran.
- Oh...

626
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:47,885
- (Foggy) Sorry.
- We're really sorry.

627
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,908
- Sorry.
- We're sorry. We'll be quiet.

628
00:36:49,991 --> 00:36:51,577
- You wanna go to the fish market?
- (Chuckling) No, she...

629
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,745
I'm gonna buy a bluefin.

630
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,081
I'm buying a bluefin, Murdock!

631
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:03,379
Okay... we've got what?

632
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,132
- Two hours to kill.
- (Giggles)

633
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,386
Let's brush you up on
some Japanese auctioneering terms.

634
00:37:10,471 --> 00:37:12,138
Okay, you don't have to do this, Foggy.

635
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:13,306
Do what?

636
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:15,350
You haven't lived until you've argued

637
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:18,937
with a 90-year-old Okinawa survivor
about sturgeon meat.

638
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,146
(Chuckling)

639
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,191
Thank you.

640
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,068
I needed this.
I really needed this.

641
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:27,362
But it's late, and we should go home.

642
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:28,739
- Are you kidding me?
- Yes.

643
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:31,407
After what you told me,
I'm never going home again.

644
00:37:31,492 --> 00:37:34,012
Men are waiting in the dark corners
of this world to prey on us.

645
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,078
Oh, God.

646
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:37,914
The valiant, the kindhearted.

647
00:37:37,998 --> 00:37:40,542
We must band together.
We must never sleep.

648
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,711
We must remain vigilant.

649
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,547
Here in the lights of Hell's Kitchen.

650
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,173
Never sleep!

651
00:37:48,258 --> 00:37:50,594
- This city will protect us!
- (Karen giggles)

652
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:53,114
- (Foggy) This city's beautiful.
- Yeah.

653
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:06,192
(Inhales deeply)

654
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,585
Here's how this is gonna work.

655
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:28,048
I'm gonna ask you some questions.
You're gonna answer them.

656
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:30,008
If you're lying to me...

657
00:38:30,926 --> 00:38:32,468
trust that I will know...

658
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:35,096
and I will be unhappy.

659
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:37,766
Where's the boy?

660
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,268
He's dead.

661
00:38:42,103 --> 00:38:43,188
(Coughing)

662
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,984
- (Breathing heavily)
- This is what unhappy looks like.

663
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:49,235
Where's the boy?

664
00:38:50,403 --> 00:38:53,364
What do you care?
If he's not dead yet, he will be.

665
00:38:53,448 --> 00:38:56,159
- Why did you take him?
- Figured you'd come running.

666
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:58,078
And after I was dead?

667
00:38:58,161 --> 00:39:01,497
Sell the kid, like all the others.

668
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,000
(Both grunting)

669
00:39:05,752 --> 00:39:08,714
I was telling the truth on that one.

670
00:39:08,797 --> 00:39:09,840
I know.

671
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:12,968
We got you good, didn't we?

672
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:16,262
- Who do you sell the children to?
- I don't know.

673
00:39:16,346 --> 00:39:18,181
Whoever has the money.

674
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,726
Where's the boy?

675
00:39:20,809 --> 00:39:23,854
So you find him. So what?

676
00:39:23,937 --> 00:39:25,063
We'll take another.

677
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:29,025
Kill me, somebody takes my place.

678
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:32,362
Long as people are buying,
we'll be selling.

679
00:39:33,279 --> 00:39:34,990
Nothing you do tonight will change that.

680
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:40,161
But go ahead. Keep hitting me.
Let's see who drops first.

681
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,582
Try stabbing him in his trigeminal nerve.

682
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,668
Where is it?

683
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:49,379
Go in through here,
right above the eye.

684
00:39:49,462 --> 00:39:53,299
That's the supraorbital foramen.
You want to go in right under there.

685
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:56,970
(Breathing heavily)

686
00:39:57,553 --> 00:39:58,639
(Masked Man)
Hold still.

687
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,557
I might do some serious damage
if you squirm.

688
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:03,018
(Panting)

689
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:05,729
How will I know when I find it?

690
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:07,939
He'll tell you.

691
00:40:08,023 --> 00:40:10,150
(Breathing heavily)

692
00:40:11,735 --> 00:40:13,319
(Screaming)

693
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,959
(Masked Man)
You're right...

694
00:40:28,043 --> 00:40:29,419
what you said before.

695
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:33,048
I kill you, somebody takes your place,

696
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,966
but they'll end up back here
just like you,

697
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,178
and sooner or later, one of you
is gonna tell me what I need to know.

698
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,806
(Soft grunt)

699
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:42,933
(Man grunts)

700
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:45,435
(Masked Man grunting)

701
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,983
This is important.

702
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:53,359
- (Groaning)
- Shh!

703
00:40:53,443 --> 00:40:56,154
Listen, I need you to know
why I'm hurting you.

704
00:40:57,405 --> 00:40:58,489
It's not just the boy.

705
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,451
I'm doing this 'cause I enjoy it.

706
00:41:01,534 --> 00:41:02,618
(Man)
No, no, no!

707
00:41:02,703 --> 00:41:03,995
No, no, no!

708
00:41:05,288 --> 00:41:06,289
(Masked Man)
Where is he?

709
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:10,251
Where is he?

710
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,964
(Sobbing)
No!

711
00:41:14,547 --> 00:41:17,801
Underneath Troika restaurant.
Eleventh and 44th.

712
00:41:18,593 --> 00:41:19,720
(Grunts)

713
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:23,682
(Chuckles)

714
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:26,601
They'll be waiting for you.

715
00:41:27,728 --> 00:41:30,396
If you're lucky, they'll kill you
before they start in on the boy.

716
00:41:31,732 --> 00:41:34,943
It would be a shame for you
to have to watch what they do to him... Oh!

717
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,152
(Claire shrieking)

718
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:37,362
(Thudding)

719
00:41:38,321 --> 00:41:40,448
- (Claire) Oh, my God!
- It's all right.

720
00:41:41,449 --> 00:41:43,618
He landed in the dumpster
you pulled me out of.

721
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,078
Is he dead?

722
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:46,662
(Breathing heavily)

723
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,251
He'll live.

724
00:41:52,502 --> 00:41:56,422
You need to get your things and leave.
Don't tell anyone where you're going.

725
00:41:59,259 --> 00:42:00,260
What?

726
00:42:02,012 --> 00:42:04,765
(Grunts)
He wakes up, he'll be back...

727
00:42:04,848 --> 00:42:07,058
and he won't be alone next time.

728
00:42:07,142 --> 00:42:08,476
But he didn't see my face.

729
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,604
That was just for effect, to scare him.

730
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,398
He knew you were lying
when you answered your door.

731
00:42:13,481 --> 00:42:15,776
- (Groaning)
- Mike...

732
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,361
(Breathing heavily)

733
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:22,741
Do you have somewhere you can go?

734
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:26,286
I'm cat-sitting for...
a woman I work with.

735
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,140
Her brother's sick. She's in Oklahoma.

736
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:30,248
What's the address?

737
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:32,375
Why?

738
00:42:33,626 --> 00:42:35,837
I'm thinking if
I make it through the night,

739
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:37,522
I may need some help getting patched up.

740
00:42:42,844 --> 00:42:44,805
Tenth and 54th.

741
00:42:46,222 --> 00:42:49,768
Apartment 412, um,
in the building above the liquor store.

742
00:42:54,522 --> 00:42:55,606
Hey.

743
00:42:57,901 --> 00:42:59,694
Thank you, Claire.

744
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:03,865
(Groaning)

745
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:06,659
I don't believe you.

746
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:09,454
What you said.

747
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,835
I don't believe you enjoy this.

748
00:43:32,102 --> 00:43:34,354
(Crowd cheering)

749
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:40,360
(Announcer)
In the red corner,

750
00:43:40,443 --> 00:43:45,281

(Commentator)
Murdock lands another and another!

755
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:02,382
Get him, Dad! Get him!

756
00:44:02,465 --> 00:44:05,510
Creel is rocked!
Murdock won't let him out of the corner!

757
00:44:05,593 --> 00:44:07,178
The younger Creel seems stunned

758
00:44:07,262 --> 00:44:10,265
by the ferocious display
by the more seasoned Murdock!

759
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,391
- Creel goes down!
- (Crowd cheering)

760
00:44:11,474 --> 00:44:12,517

- He's not getting up! It's over!

has defeated Crusher Creel!

763
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:18,857
Yeah, Dad! Yeah!

(Indistinct radio chatter)

768
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:05,570
Oh, oh, hang on there, son.

769
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:08,489
- What's the hurry?
- I think that's my dad.

770
00:45:09,157 --> 00:45:10,825
Jesus, Ray, the kid's blind.

771
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:12,118
Hey, wait!

772
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:22,170
Dad?

773
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,176
Daddy!

774

(Boy panting)

779
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:08,466
I want to go home.
I want my daddy.
