1
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:11,923
[door slamming]

2
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:52,423
[elevator dinging]

3
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:55,216
[dinging continues]

4
00:01:08,314 --> 00:01:09,690
[yelling]

5
00:01:21,117 --> 00:01:22,911
[man speaking Japanese] Where is it?

6
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:24,538
I don't know.

7
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:27,290
Where is the Black Sky?

8
00:01:30,251 --> 00:01:31,670
[screaming]

9
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:37,343
You have three limbs left.

10
00:01:37,426 --> 00:01:40,220
And other appendages no man wants to lose.

11
00:01:41,304 --> 00:01:44,140
Where is the Black Sky?

12
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:45,726
It's gone.

13
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:48,979
They...

14
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:50,814
They put it on a ship.

15
00:01:50,897 --> 00:01:53,108
[man] Where's the ship headed?

16
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,569
New York City.

17
00:01:56,027 --> 00:01:57,070
[whimpering]

18
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:58,322
Swear to it.

19
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,366
Upon my family.

20
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:09,458
They're better off without you.

21
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,141
[theme music playing]

22
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:30,288
Devil, my shapely Irish ass.

23
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:33,584
Guy's a coward.

24
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:37,128
Would and I wouldn't give for the
chance to rip that corny mask off and...

25
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:39,631
And what?

26
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:41,800
Punch him... in the face...

27
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:44,720
with my... fisticuffs.

28
00:03:46,472 --> 00:03:49,808
I don't know, he seems,
uh... pretty fisticuffy.

29
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:53,019
Please tell me I don't detect a hint
of admiration for that terrorist.

30
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:57,148
This is just all speculation. Nobody
knows if he's a terrorist or what.

31
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:59,234
You're absolutely right.
Terrorists have causes.

32
00:03:59,317 --> 00:04:00,944
They claim responsibility.

33
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:04,906
Al-Qaeda wanted the world to know
exactly what kind of assholes they were.

34
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,242
This guy? Not a peep.

35
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,744
All terror without the "-ist."

36
00:04:08,827 --> 00:04:10,787
You know what they call that? Nut job.

37
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:12,372
- Hmm, maybe.
- [groans]

38
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:14,415
[wincing] How's your side?

39
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,585
Downgraded to agony.

40
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:18,879
All right, what do you think, Matt?

41
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:22,508
I think Foggy'll be pitching
for the Mets by mid-season.

42
00:04:22,591 --> 00:04:24,009
[chuckling] I'm being serious.

43
00:04:24,092 --> 00:04:26,052
[chuckles] So am I. Have
you seen their bullpen?

44
00:04:26,136 --> 00:04:29,598
Come on, you telling me this
dickhead blowing up our backyard

45
00:04:29,681 --> 00:04:30,807
doesn't piss you off?

46
00:04:30,891 --> 00:04:32,183
What happened to Hell's Kitchen,

47
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:35,812
to you and to Elena, and to
all the people that were hurt...

48
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,438
yeah, it pisses me off.

49
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:39,443
But this man, whoever he
is, whatever his motive,

50
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,485
he shouldn't be tried and
convicted in the press.

51
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:44,320
We're lawyers, we know that's
not how it's supposed to work.

52
00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:47,741
So, uh, hypothetically,
if this guy got caught...

53
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:50,451
needed counsel, Nelson and
Murdock would offer to defend him?

54
00:04:50,536 --> 00:04:51,578
[Foggy] Hell no.

55
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:53,121
It would be his right.

56
00:04:53,955 --> 00:04:55,832
What about my right to
punch him in the melon?

57
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:58,043
They pulled a piece of
glass out of my side.

58
00:04:58,126 --> 00:05:00,128
Elena needed 12 stitches.

59
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:02,463
And you want to Perry
Mason the guy responsible?

60
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,966
I wanna make sure the right
person pays for what happened.

61
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,635
The whole thing's moot.

62
00:05:06,718 --> 00:05:09,262
After shooting those cops, police
are probably looking to settle things

63
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,848
the old-fashioned way
if they catch up to him.

64
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:14,976
Yeah, it's more than likely.

65
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,523
Just a thought, but we may wanna go
a bit peppier at the end of the day.

66
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:22,818
Leave on a note slightly
higher than deeply depressing.

67
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:26,780
She's right. You're
bringing us down, Murdock.

68
00:05:26,863 --> 00:05:27,906
[laughing] Me?

69
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:32,786
- High note! Softball!
- [laughs]

70
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,621
When are we getting a
company team together?

71
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,748
We have three employees.

72
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,918
At least two of them aren't blind.

73
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:42,087
Naysayers, each and every one of you.

74
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,421
Karen, come on.

75
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,298
Batting practice, you
and me, Chelsea Piers.

76
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:47,508
- What do you say?
- Um, I...

77
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:49,845
Or not. Totally cool.

78
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:51,888
[Karen] No, no, I would, I
would. It's just that I, um...

79
00:05:51,972 --> 00:05:53,599
I have this, uh, thing.

80
00:05:53,682 --> 00:05:55,851
[Foggy] Go, do that thing.

81
00:05:57,185 --> 00:05:58,311
Not a problem.

82
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:01,522
Okay, so, um... see you tomorrow.

83
00:06:01,607 --> 00:06:05,068
We'll be here, ready
to high note and stuff.

84
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,152
Good.

85
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:09,405
[sighs heavily]

86
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:10,490
[imitates banging sound]

87
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,325
Smooth.

88
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:14,953
Admittedly, I'm a work in progress.

89
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:18,331
Did you know she has mace on her keychain?

90
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:19,625
Is that a bad thing?

91
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,584
You ever worry about her?

92
00:06:21,668 --> 00:06:24,921
Worry, like, something
she's not telling us?

93
00:06:25,005 --> 00:06:27,007
Everyone has secrets, Foggy.

94
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,676
I don't. I'd like some.

95
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,680
Your kind... like with
Hottie McBurner-Phone.

96
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:36,224
I mean, I assume she's hot. Is she hot?

97
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:37,726
Oh...

98
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:39,477
How would I know?

99
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,271
This again.

100
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:42,981
You always know.

101
00:06:43,064 --> 00:06:44,440
I mean, you guys getting serious?

102
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:46,652
Should I dust off the
tux I'll need to rent?

103
00:06:46,735 --> 00:06:47,819
[laughs]

104
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:52,157
No, uh... it didn't work out.

105
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,241
Oh.

106
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:55,911
I'm... I'm sorry, man.

107
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:57,453
Yeah, me too.

108
00:06:58,914 --> 00:07:02,208
Hey, look, I'm gonna order in tonight,
get a jump on this tenement case.

109
00:07:02,292 --> 00:07:03,710
You want me to stay?

110
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,712
No, I'll be all right. Thanks, buddy.

111
00:07:05,796 --> 00:07:07,547
See you in the morning.

112
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,931
Hey, Matt...

113
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:18,391
her loss, man. Seriously.

114
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:24,898
[door opens]

115
00:07:25,523 --> 00:07:26,566
[door closes]

116
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,151
Owlsley, Leland: Financial Advisor...

117
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:30,486
at the prestigious firm
of Silver & Brent...

118
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,749
The funds have been
reallocated as requested.

119
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:45,043
All the arrangements
made per your agreement

120
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:47,587
with the guy we're not
supposed to blah blah blah.

121
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:49,339
Business may continue?

122
00:07:49,422 --> 00:07:53,593
In the best possible way... uninterrupted.

123
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:57,055
So, uh, what are you going
to do with it when it arrives?

124
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:02,018
What, you think I'm a
doddering pencil pusher

125
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:07,482
who moves enormous amounts of money with
no clue as to what it's connected to?

126
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:09,275
[Leland chuckles]

127
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,236
The numbers are like tea leaves.

128
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,529
Nobody reads them like I can.

129
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,952
You're laying out major
reserves to clear the docks...

130
00:08:19,035 --> 00:08:23,206
to make sure the police
don't come within 10 blocks.

131
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,959
More to bribe the comptrollers

132
00:08:26,042 --> 00:08:28,628
to guarantee straight greens.

133
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:30,505
[Leland chuckles]

134
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:32,423
Know how much all that costs?

135
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:33,549
I do.

136
00:08:34,217 --> 00:08:36,386
There is a point to all your words?

137
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,764
Yeah, I got a...

138
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:42,100
[Leland clears throat]

139
00:08:43,184 --> 00:08:45,812
What happened to the Russians...

140
00:08:45,896 --> 00:08:48,857
We need to be careful, all of us.

141
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,903
I look out for you... you look out for me.

142
00:08:52,986 --> 00:08:54,237
All I'm saying.

143
00:08:57,115 --> 00:09:00,701
Each man must stand... for himself...

144
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:03,329
or fall with the unworthy.

145
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:06,291
What the hell does that mean?

146
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:09,377
[car engine starting]

147
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:16,802
Prick.

148
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:20,680
[car door unlocking]

149
00:09:23,724 --> 00:09:25,018
Oh, God!

150
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:27,228
What do you want? My wallet?

151
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:30,481
You know what I want. Tell
me about the man you work for.

152
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:34,277
[exhales] I work for Silver & Brent.

153
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:37,322
I'm gonna ask you again.

154
00:09:38,448 --> 00:09:40,784
Think about your answer.

155
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:44,370
Who do you work for?

156
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:47,165
I told you, I work for Silver and...

157
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:52,337
You work for Wilson Fisk...

158
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,131
moving his money around.

159
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:58,301
Which means you have
records, proof of who...

160
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:00,303
[cane tapping]

161
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,390
- [buzzing]
- [groans]

162
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,602
[Leland] Asshole.

163
00:10:09,354 --> 00:10:10,646
[groaning]

164
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,398
[car engine starts]

165
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:17,570
[cane tapping]

166
00:10:18,404 --> 00:10:20,240
[groans]

167
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:34,129
You just gonna lie there all night?

168
00:10:36,506 --> 00:10:38,549
[overlapping voices and sounds]

169
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,684
He's getting worse.

170
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:53,731
When we first took him in, Matthew's
problems seemed less severe.

171
00:10:53,814 --> 00:10:56,151
Now he's in so much pain.

172
00:10:56,234 --> 00:11:01,822
Doctors, clergy, no one has
any idea what's wrong with him.

173
00:11:01,907 --> 00:11:04,951
We heard about your work
with special children

174
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:07,078
and thought maybe you could help.

175
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:08,621
Not for free.

176
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:12,583
His father left a sizeable inheritance.

177
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:14,877
What about the mother? Is she dead?

178
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:16,837
No, she's...

179
00:11:16,922 --> 00:11:19,966
Well, that's another story. Here we are.

180
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:26,639
Make the check out to cash.
I'll take it from here.

181
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:30,185
[Matt panting]

182
00:11:36,607 --> 00:11:38,901
They think you're getting worse.

183
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:43,239
But... you're not, are you, kid?

184
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:47,077
[keys jingling]

185
00:11:48,411 --> 00:11:50,413
You're getting stronger.

186
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:53,624
[exhales] Let's get started.

187
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:59,103
[Matt] So what kind of training is this?

188
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:01,049
You like ice cream?

189
00:12:01,132 --> 00:12:02,758
Yeah.

190
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:06,679
Then shut up and eat it.
I'll ask the questions.

191
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:10,183
First thing you gotta understand is

192
00:12:10,266 --> 00:12:14,312
nobody feels sorry for
you and nobody ever will.

193
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,483
'Cause when it comes to being born lucky...

194
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:20,568
you won the friggin' lottery.

195
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:21,736
I did?

196
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:24,905
What did I say about questions?

197
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,157
"Shut up."

198
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:28,243
Good.

199
00:12:29,285 --> 00:12:32,413
How old were you when you got blinded?

200
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,374
- Nine.
- Nine?

201
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:39,337
So you had nine whole
years of looking at movies,

202
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,174
blue skies, up girlies'
skirts that I never had.

203
00:12:43,258 --> 00:12:45,885
I was born blind.

204
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:48,346
You don't hear me whining about it, do you?

205
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:49,472
No.

206
00:12:49,555 --> 00:12:54,977
So, you're nine years old, walking
along, minding your own business

207
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:57,230
and whammo!

208
00:12:57,313 --> 00:13:00,816
Get hit by a truck,
killed dead on the spot.

209
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,318
I wasn't killed.

210
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:03,736
You lived?

211
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,488
Praise God, it's a miracle.

212
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:08,491
So you survive the truck

213
00:13:08,574 --> 00:13:11,994
and get this chemical shit in your eyes.

214
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:13,121
What next?

215
00:13:13,204 --> 00:13:14,955
I hear things.

216
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,666
What kind of things?

217
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:17,792
Everything.

218
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:21,421
Coughs and fights and cats meowing.

219
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,339
Sometimes blocks away.

220
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:24,465
I can sense things.

221
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:27,009
I know where things are and when they move.

222
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:29,512
But I can't see.

223
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:32,765
You know what they call stuff like that?

224
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:33,974
Gifts.

225
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:36,686
The special kind.

226
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:39,772
The kind that very few people have.

227
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,024
Or deserve.

228
00:13:42,108 --> 00:13:43,734
I never thought of it that way.

229
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:45,778
Well, that's because you're stupid.

230
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:47,405
I'm not stupid, I'm smart.

231
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:48,989
Because you taught yourself

232
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:52,785
how to run your little fingers
over the bumps and read Braille?

233
00:13:52,868 --> 00:13:55,455
Smart don't come out of books, kid.

234
00:13:55,538 --> 00:14:00,418
Smart is making the right
decision at the right time.

235
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:03,629
Like now.

236
00:14:03,713 --> 00:14:05,756
What's it gonna be, Matty?

237
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,345
You gonna spend your life crying and
rocking yourself to sleep at night?

238
00:14:10,428 --> 00:14:13,306
Or are you gonna dig deep

239
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:18,103
and find out what it takes to
reshuffle those cards life dealt you?

240
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,855
Your call.

241
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:27,653
[chuckles] Good choice, kid.

242
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,742
No one's bought me ice
cream since my dad died.

243
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,369
What's it taste like?

244
00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:36,412
- Vanilla.
- [man scoffs]

245
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:39,290
Everybody can taste vanilla.

246
00:14:39,374 --> 00:14:43,169
Pay a little more
attention, use those gifts.

247
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:45,088
You know what you got?

248
00:14:46,172 --> 00:14:48,674
Sugar grains, vanilla bean,

249
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:53,763
milk from three different
dairies from two states...

250
00:14:56,891 --> 00:14:58,476
ugh...

251
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,272
batch of chemicals straight
off the periodic tables and...

252
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:07,277
dirt off the guy's hand
that served it to you.

253
00:15:08,444 --> 00:15:11,406
He spent his morning gardening.

254
00:15:11,489 --> 00:15:15,493
Whole world around you,
Matty, and it is friggin' huge.

255
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,287
And all you need...

256
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:20,415
are the guts to let it in.

257
00:15:20,498 --> 00:15:22,041
Try.

258
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,461
That dog, what's his story?

259
00:15:25,545 --> 00:15:27,172
[dog panting]

260
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,714
He's hungry...

261
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:30,258
his stomach's growling...

262
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:35,138
and he's dying to eat the hot dogs
that guy's carrying just upwind of him.

263
00:15:37,014 --> 00:15:38,599
Not bad.

264
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:40,976
What about the girl?

265
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:45,440
Her skin's... Her skin's too hot.

266
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:50,069
- Her heart's beating fast.
- [indistinct talking]

267
00:15:50,153 --> 00:15:51,446
Is she sick?

268
00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:53,239
Worse.

269
00:15:53,323 --> 00:15:54,699
She's in love.

270
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:56,284
And the old man?

271
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:02,498
He's...

272
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,169
He's dying.

273
00:16:06,252 --> 00:16:08,754
And there's nothing you can do about it.

274
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:15,178
Big world... not all of
it flowers and sunshine.

275
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:21,434
And the only way guys
like you and me can survive

276
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:25,313
is to grab it by the
throat and never let go.

277
00:16:26,564 --> 00:16:28,899
[Matt] If I ask you a
question, will you hit me?

278
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:31,068
Depends on the question.

279
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:34,239
How did you find me? How did you know?

280
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:37,867
Old bitty at the orphanage
thinks it's her idea.

281
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,785
But it wasn't, was it?

282
00:16:41,621 --> 00:16:43,748
Maybe it's one of my gifts.

283
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:46,166
Or you just got lucky.

284
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,835
[scoffing] That's not an answer.

285
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,003
[man chuckles]

286
00:16:50,505 --> 00:16:52,548
You catch on quick.

287
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:56,219
You're going to help me?

288
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:58,763
No, I'm gonna train you.

289
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:03,851
How to control your gift,
make it work for you...

290
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:07,272
use it, and how to fight.

291
00:17:07,355 --> 00:17:09,274
My dad never wanted me to fight.

292
00:17:09,357 --> 00:17:12,527
Your dad ain't here. You'll
need skills for the war.

293
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,944
What war?

294
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:18,658
We'll get to that
part... when you're ready.

295
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,951
I don't even know your
name. What do I call you?

296
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:22,537
Stick.

297
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,206
Are you gonna lie there all
night or get up off your ass?

298
00:17:27,124 --> 00:17:28,293
Jesus, kid.

299
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:31,629
I'm gone five minutes, you turn
this place into a shit show.

300
00:17:31,712 --> 00:17:33,272
[Masked Man] You've been gone 20 years.

301
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,550
What are you doing back in my city?

302
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,635
Your city?

303
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:39,970
Hell's Kitchen hates your guts.

304
00:17:40,054 --> 00:17:43,891
They have you pegged as a cop
killer and some kind of mad bomber.

305
00:17:43,974 --> 00:17:45,225
Yeah, I'm taking care of it.

306
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,061
An old guy just lit you up.

307
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:48,896
You ain't taking care of shit.

308
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,648
Why are you here?

309
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:52,650
To save you...

310
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:56,028
and everyone in the Kitchen
from a horrible death.

311
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,738
[scoffs]

312
00:17:57,822 --> 00:17:59,198
More or less.

313
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:02,368
[Karen sighs]

314
00:18:02,452 --> 00:18:05,162
Paper trail on Union Allied's a bust.

315
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:06,706
Whoever's pulling the strings

316
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:09,625
busted up the one big corporation
into a bunch of little ones.

317
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,126
It's an old game.

318
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,171
Spread the records far and
wide, discourage investigation.

319
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:16,256
[sighs] God. I mean, it's like...

320
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:19,594
It's like trying to straighten
out a bowl of spaghetti.

321
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:21,637
Well, you could always let it go.

322
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:25,015
Not gonna happen.

323
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:26,434
I already told you that.

324
00:18:26,517 --> 00:18:29,479
Stop complaining. This is the job.

325
00:18:29,562 --> 00:18:32,231
- Researching, gathering facts.
- [Karen sighs]

326
00:18:32,315 --> 00:18:36,151
It's long and boring and complicated,
and half the time you still come up empty.

327
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:40,698
Well, you're just a little ray of sunshine.

328
00:18:40,781 --> 00:18:42,617
Just giving you the lay of the land.

329
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:48,038
For every exposé I've had published,
there were a dozen that didn't pan out.

330
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:49,832
All right, all right, so I'm
the new girl on the block,

331
00:18:49,915 --> 00:18:51,834
I don't know what I'm doing, I get it.

332
00:18:56,464 --> 00:18:59,467
What about you? What'd you find?

333
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:03,971
Ah, bits and pieces. Yakuza...

334
00:19:04,054 --> 00:19:06,599
Wait, [stuttering] the Japanese mafia?

335
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,227
Triads, too. Drugs, I think.

336
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:15,733
Then there's the bombings
that took out the Russians.

337
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:19,820
And you think it's all
connected to Union Allied?

338
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:21,280
Doesn't matter what I think.

339
00:19:21,364 --> 00:19:23,198
Only matters what I can prove.

340
00:19:23,282 --> 00:19:27,077
Wait, what about the cops that got shot?

341
00:19:27,161 --> 00:19:29,872
I mean, you really think
that was the guy in the mask?

342
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:36,336
I was standing right next to
one of them when it happened.

343
00:19:37,713 --> 00:19:39,715
Detective named Blake.

344
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,136
Didn't like each other very much.

345
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,096
Yeah, I met him...

346
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,558
when they brought me into the precinct.

347
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,310
I see why you didn't get along.

348
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:53,521
Did what I could.

349
00:19:53,604 --> 00:19:56,023
If he comes out of a coma, maybe...

350
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:59,985
maybe he'll thank me, tell me
what really happened out there.

351
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,987
Till then...

352
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,449
the man in the mask pops up...

353
00:20:04,532 --> 00:20:07,284
do me a favor, run the other way.

354
00:20:08,661 --> 00:20:10,830
He saved my life, Ben.

355
00:20:11,956 --> 00:20:14,750
How do you know he wasn't
there just to, um...

356
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:17,252
hurt somebody else?

357
00:20:19,422 --> 00:20:23,383
I... I never... never
thought about it like that.

358
00:20:23,468 --> 00:20:28,222
My experience... there
are no heroes, no villains.

359
00:20:28,305 --> 00:20:29,849
Just people with different agendas.

360
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,642
Yeah, and one of those was to kill me.

361
00:20:31,726 --> 00:20:32,977
Mmm-hmm.

362
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,103
It was.

363
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:36,939
And you're not careful, maybe
they'll want a second crack at it.

364
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:42,612
The only way I'll ever feel safe again

365
00:20:42,695 --> 00:20:45,615
is if the people that you are
talking about are put away.

366
00:20:45,698 --> 00:20:48,618
Then we better try harder to
straighten out that spaghetti.

367
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:52,747
So...

368
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,458
if we can connect...

369
00:20:56,751 --> 00:21:00,379
the tenements, and the
shootings, and Union Allied...

370
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:03,508
that something you'd take to your editor?

371
00:21:03,591 --> 00:21:04,925
[chuckles]

372
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:06,844
Yeah.

373
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:08,971
- Probably bring home a Pulitzer.
- [Karen laughs]

374
00:21:09,054 --> 00:21:10,765
But, uh, I think it's a long shot.

375
00:21:10,848 --> 00:21:14,769
Well, I was a mean three-point shooter
on my high school basketball team.

376
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:16,979
I like the long shots.

377
00:21:17,062 --> 00:21:18,856
This isn't a game, Karen.

378
00:21:18,939 --> 00:21:21,233
I... I know that.

379
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:25,320
Anything happens to
you... it's gonna be on me,

380
00:21:25,404 --> 00:21:27,031
and, uh...

381
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,327
I don't want to be responsible for that.

382
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,123
I can't.

383
00:21:38,834 --> 00:21:40,294
I'll be okay.

384
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:44,173
They're not gonna win.

385
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:03,693
[engine starts]

386
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,918
[scoffs] What a shithole.

387
00:22:22,044 --> 00:22:23,838
You have any idea what I pay in rent?

388
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:25,547
Expensive shithole.

389
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:26,632
[sniffing]

390
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:28,133
You had a woman in here.

391
00:22:28,217 --> 00:22:29,384
That's none of your business.

392
00:22:29,468 --> 00:22:31,637
When's she coming back?

393
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:34,181
- Never.
- Good.

394
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:36,934
You got a warped perspective on the
whole good/bad thing, you know that?

395
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:38,227
[sighs]

396
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:40,270
Women are a distraction.

397
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,651
Just like... furniture, apartments...

398
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:47,695
Whoa.

399
00:22:48,528 --> 00:22:49,947
[sighs]

400
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,406
Silk sheets.

401
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,743
Cotton feels like sandpaper on my skin.

402
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,622
You'd be better off
sleeping on real sandpaper

403
00:22:57,705 --> 00:23:00,374
than surrounding yourself
with all this bullshit.

404
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:03,502
This is my life and I made
something of it, without you.

405
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:05,713
That's the part that really
pisses you off, isn't it?

406
00:23:05,796 --> 00:23:09,549
No, Matty. No, I'm proud
of you, I really am.

407
00:23:09,634 --> 00:23:13,638
The things you've done, what
you've made of yourself, but...

408
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:15,973
this is...

409
00:23:16,056 --> 00:23:21,061
Surrounding yourself with soft
stuff isn't life, it's death.

410
00:23:22,062 --> 00:23:25,149
Someday those silk sheets
are gonna crawl up behind you,

411
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:28,610
wrap themselves around your
throat and choke you to death.

412
00:23:28,694 --> 00:23:29,779
You're a warrior.

413
00:23:29,862 --> 00:23:31,321
Yeah...

414
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:32,657
that's not all I am.

415
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,703
A warrior, heir to the Spartans,
baddest of the bad-asses.

416
00:23:37,787 --> 00:23:39,789
They knew what they had
to do and they did it.

417
00:23:39,872 --> 00:23:40,915
And what was that?

418
00:23:40,998 --> 00:23:43,458
Cut it loose, all of it.

419
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:46,796
Cut yourself free...

420
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:50,132
from the women, the
comforts, the fancy job.

421
00:23:50,215 --> 00:23:52,259
[laughs] The job's not that fancy.

422
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:55,012
Do you have friends? People you care about?

423
00:23:55,095 --> 00:23:56,596
Yeah, two.

424
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:58,808
Cut 'em loose, for their sake.

425
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:01,686
Break their hearts if you
have to, just do it quick.

426
00:24:01,769 --> 00:24:02,937
I'm not gonna do that.

427
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,856
Then they will suffer and you will die.

428
00:24:07,232 --> 00:24:10,820
Relationships are a luxury men
like you and me can't afford.

429
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:12,321
Is that why you left?

430
00:24:14,406 --> 00:24:15,991
Huh? To protect me?

431
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:17,743
I had my reasons.

432
00:24:17,827 --> 00:24:19,244
I was a kid.

433
00:24:20,454 --> 00:24:21,914
You still are.

434
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,125
"Boo-hoo. Stick left me.

435
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:28,462
Think I'll bury my sorrows
between the legs of a supermodel."

436
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:29,629
Don't push it, Stick.

437
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,631
Or what?

438
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:33,884
I'm trying to teach you how to stay alive.

439
00:24:33,968 --> 00:24:36,053
Christ, you're worse than your old man.

440
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:38,723
Born to lose Battlin' Jack.

441
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:41,809
At least your daddy got
paid when he hit the floor.

442
00:24:42,893 --> 00:24:44,186
[grunting]

443
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:45,562
You're hurting me.

444
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:47,689
Make me stop.

445
00:24:47,773 --> 00:24:49,608
- I can't.
- Then quit.

446
00:24:49,691 --> 00:24:51,485
Murdocks never quit.

447
00:24:55,614 --> 00:24:56,741
Then beat me.

448
00:24:58,033 --> 00:25:00,745
[sighs] I've got all day, kid.

449
00:25:02,412 --> 00:25:03,956
You're just a bully.

450
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:07,960
World's full of 'em. What
are you gonna do about it?

451
00:25:09,461 --> 00:25:10,462
Feel the breeze.

452
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:16,676
You got heart, kid.

453
00:25:17,594 --> 00:25:19,096
But heart's not enough.

454
00:25:19,179 --> 00:25:21,431
You've got to control that rage.

455
00:25:21,515 --> 00:25:22,724
You said anger's a weapon.

456
00:25:22,808 --> 00:25:25,269
Anger is a spark, good.

457
00:25:25,352 --> 00:25:30,858
Rage is a wildfire, out of
control, therefore useless.

458
00:25:30,941 --> 00:25:32,985
Just like you laying there.

459
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:41,243
[gasping]

460
00:25:43,162 --> 00:25:45,247
I thought Murdocks never quit.

461
00:25:45,664 --> 00:25:46,706
[whimpering]

462
00:25:47,624 --> 00:25:50,210
[sobbing] It's my fault! It's my fault!

463
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:51,796
I did it, I killed him!

464
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:52,922
Killed who?

465
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:54,714
My dad.

466
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:59,219
They paid him to lose against Creel.

467
00:25:59,303 --> 00:26:01,889
But... But I wanted him to win.

468
00:26:01,972 --> 00:26:03,682
So he did because of me.

469
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,517
Because of me.

470
00:26:07,352 --> 00:26:09,313
I just wanted him to come home.

471
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:11,648
But he didn't, and he never will.

472
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:14,359
We all pay for our choices, kid.

473
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:19,489
Maybe your old man fought for
you, maybe he did it for himself.

474
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:23,410
The only thing you know
for sure is he's gone now.

475
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,288
But I'm here.

476
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:29,583
Now, get up.

477
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:33,003
Time to stop taking a
beating and start giving one.

478
00:26:34,754 --> 00:26:36,548
Get up.

479
00:26:39,384 --> 00:26:40,594
Get up.

480
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:43,680
Get up!

481
00:26:50,437 --> 00:26:51,688
[chuckles]

482
00:26:51,771 --> 00:26:55,817
Come on, kid. Show me
I'm not wasting my time.

483
00:27:03,742 --> 00:27:04,994
[breathing heavily]

484
00:27:05,077 --> 00:27:06,620
[both grunting]

485
00:27:08,622 --> 00:27:09,915
[Stick laughing]

486
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,003
Took you 20 years to learn
how to get out of that one.

487
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,671
Yeah, I've learned a lot
since you've been gone.

488
00:27:16,755 --> 00:27:18,257
- Like what?
- You're a dick.

489
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,425
That's true.

490
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,760
You got any beer?

491
00:27:22,386 --> 00:27:24,138
[chuckles] Yeah, in the fridge.

492
00:27:25,722 --> 00:27:26,806
I'll bet...

493
00:27:28,142 --> 00:27:31,395
it's that German piss, isn't it?

494
00:27:32,396 --> 00:27:34,856
So you gonna tell me why you're here?

495
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,651
Or is the suspense supposed to kill me?

496
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:40,779
- It's the war, Matty.
- [pops cap]

497
00:27:45,075 --> 00:27:46,535
Never-ending war.

498
00:27:46,618 --> 00:27:48,745
With who? You never
got around to that part.

499
00:27:48,828 --> 00:27:52,082
Now, the Japanese, mostly.

500
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:55,752
Look, I don't want you tearing up
Hell's Kitchen going after the yakuza.

501
00:27:55,835 --> 00:27:57,337
Yakuza? [chuckles]

502
00:27:58,297 --> 00:28:01,133
You don't know what's going
on in your own backyard.

503
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:04,511
The guy that was yappin' with
that old man you slapped around,

504
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:05,720
he's pretty high up.

505
00:28:05,804 --> 00:28:09,558
He goes by a lot of names.
Using Nobu this time around.

506
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:11,851
So, Nobu,

507
00:28:11,936 --> 00:28:14,313
you want him so bad, why'd you let
him get away back in the garage?

508
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:15,855
[sighs] I don't want him.

509
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,359
I want what's on the ship he's
meeting at the docks tonight.

510
00:28:19,443 --> 00:28:21,570
Right, Owlsley was talking about that.

511
00:28:22,612 --> 00:28:24,990
What's Nobu bringing
in? Drugs or something?

512
00:28:25,074 --> 00:28:26,741
A weapon.

513
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:29,661
They call it Black Sky,
the bringer of shadows.

514
00:28:29,744 --> 00:28:30,745
What kind of weapon?

515
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:33,415
The kind you don't want in your world.

516
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:36,126
Just say it.

517
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,253
- Say what?
- Say that you want my help.

518
00:28:38,337 --> 00:28:40,755
I want you to help yourself.

519
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,425
Nobu and his guys are in tight with Fisk.

520
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:45,885
You hurt them, you hurt baldy...

521
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,887
- You know about Fisk?
- [Stick scoffs]

522
00:28:47,972 --> 00:28:49,264
I know a lot of shit.

523
00:28:49,348 --> 00:28:52,351
This beer, for example, sucks.

524
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:56,396
After all your talk about
cutting friends loose, and...

525
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:58,273
now you need one.

526
00:28:58,357 --> 00:29:01,986
I don't need a friend. I
need a soldier. Committed.

527
00:29:02,069 --> 00:29:05,030
Not some bleeding heart idealist
hanging onto half measures.

528
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:07,782
You don't know anything
about what I'm doing here.

529
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:10,577
Kid, in war, people die.

530
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,497
If it's not you, it's the guy next to you.

531
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,045
How many men have you
killed protecting this city?

532
00:29:24,716 --> 00:29:27,136
You're still afraid to cross that line.

533
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:30,680
Someday, it's gonna come
down to you or the other guy.

534
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:33,183
If it's not Fisk, somebody else.

535
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,851
What're you gonna do then?

536
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:38,313
Yeah, a Russian asshole asked
me the same thing recently...

537
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:39,773
right before he died.

538
00:29:39,856 --> 00:29:42,317
Are you the one that put him in the ground?

539
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:43,902
No.

540
00:29:45,487 --> 00:29:47,322
Half measures, Matty.

541
00:29:48,907 --> 00:29:50,867
Ah, screw it.

542
00:29:52,244 --> 00:29:54,579
Ride with me tonight...

543
00:29:54,663 --> 00:29:57,749
help me destroy Black Sky,
keep it off the streets,

544
00:29:57,832 --> 00:29:59,876
and I promise you this...

545
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:03,672
Wilson Fisk will know the taste
of fear the day he faces you

546
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:07,301
'cause he'll know that you
kicked the guy he's afraid of

547
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:09,053
right in the nuts.

548
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:12,181
What do you say, kid?

549
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,933
One rule...

550
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:17,186
you don't kill anybody.

551
00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:18,520
[sighs]

552
00:30:19,979 --> 00:30:23,942
I swear I will not kill anybody.

553
00:30:27,446 --> 00:30:28,697
Pussy.

554
00:30:34,494 --> 00:30:35,620
Uh...

555
00:30:35,704 --> 00:30:38,540
[speaking Spanish] How's your head?

556
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:39,958
I'm alive.

557
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,918
It's enough.

558
00:30:43,045 --> 00:30:45,255
How much do I owe you for the groceries?

559
00:30:45,339 --> 00:30:48,800
[speaking English] No, no,
no, no, no. Put that away.

560
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:50,635
[speaking Spanish] I don't want your money.

561
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:53,055
No, I don't take charity.

562
00:30:53,138 --> 00:30:54,889
All right.

563
00:30:54,973 --> 00:30:57,559
You can pay me if you want...

564
00:30:57,642 --> 00:30:58,977
with information?

565
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,271
What can I tell you?

566
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:04,191
A lot, I hope.

567
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:09,946
I'm working on a legal case...

568
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:11,948
Oh, yes, yes...

569
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:14,159
with the handsome lawyer.

570
00:31:15,744 --> 00:31:17,871
[speaking English] Yeah, um, Matt. [laughs]

571
00:31:17,954 --> 00:31:20,499
[speaking Spanish] No, Mr. Foggy.

572
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:21,791
Oh.

573
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:23,715
[speaking Spanish] You
think Foggy is handsome?

574
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:24,919
- [Karen laughs]
- [Elena exclaims]

575
00:31:25,003 --> 00:31:27,756
I see the way he looks at you.

576
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,884
Never is a man more good looking

577
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,052
than when he is in love.

578
00:31:33,137 --> 00:31:34,138
[gasps]

579
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,380
[speaking English] Oh, Christ.

580
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:37,932
Oh, uh...

581
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,719
[speaking Spanish] I'm sorry.

582
00:31:41,853 --> 00:31:43,355
[laughs] Um...

583
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:46,525
[speaking English] Moving on, um...

584
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:52,322
[speaking Spanish] I'm
trying to make a connection...

585
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:56,826
between a construction company

586
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:01,706
and the repairman that
did this to your apartment.

587
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:05,419
Why don't you ask Mr. Tully?

588
00:32:05,502 --> 00:32:07,421
He sent them.

589
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:10,174
I can't find him.

590
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:14,844
His lawyers say he's on vacation.

591
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:15,970
[exclaims]

592
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:18,390
I live like this

593
00:32:18,473 --> 00:32:22,769
and that fat shit is lying on a beach?

594
00:32:23,437 --> 00:32:24,896
Ugh. Oh.

595
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:25,980
Excuse me.

596
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:27,441
No, no.

597
00:32:27,524 --> 00:32:29,193
I think...

598
00:32:29,276 --> 00:32:31,570
it's pretty damn appropriate in this case.

599
00:32:33,738 --> 00:32:37,867
Do you have papers from the repairs?

600
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:39,619
Receipts? Anything you had to...

601
00:32:39,703 --> 00:32:40,704
Sign?

602
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:42,164
No, I'm sorry.

603
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:45,792
I just called Mr. Tully,
and he sent them over.

604
00:32:45,875 --> 00:32:47,586
Can you tell me what they looked like?

605
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:49,128
Yes.

606
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:50,505
One was bald.

607
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:51,590
[speaking English] Okay.

608
00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:56,345
[speaking Spanish] And the other
had a big tattoo on his arm.

609
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:58,472
[speaking English] A tattoo?

610
00:32:58,555 --> 00:32:59,635
[speaking Spanish] Of what?

611
00:33:00,974 --> 00:33:02,559
Not a picture.

612
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,229
It was like a...

613
00:33:05,312 --> 00:33:06,896
pattern.

614
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,691
Ugly. Went up to his neck.

615
00:33:09,774 --> 00:33:12,194
Thank God he's no son of mine.

616
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:13,862
[Karen laughs]

617
00:33:13,945 --> 00:33:15,655
Thank you, Elena.

618
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:17,866
That might help.

619
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:23,497
All of this makes me worry.

620
00:33:24,248 --> 00:33:25,999
[speaking English] No.

621
00:33:26,082 --> 00:33:27,292
No, no, no. Elena...

622
00:33:27,376 --> 00:33:28,710
[speaking Spanish] They...

623
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:31,505
They're the ones that should be worried.

624
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:34,633
If I can find a connection...

625
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:38,136
to the men that did this and the company...

626
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,680
[speaking English] ...then we
will have their dicks in a vice.

627
00:33:41,348 --> 00:33:42,557
Sorry.

628
00:33:42,641 --> 00:33:44,726
[speaking Spanish] How long
have you been like this,

629
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:45,852
Miss Page?

630
00:33:46,603 --> 00:33:47,646
Um...

631
00:33:48,688 --> 00:33:50,189
Ever since...

632
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:53,277
I got to New York.

633
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,403
Oh.

634
00:33:56,696 --> 00:33:57,781
Adiós.

635
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:37,696
[Karen yelping]

636
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:39,698
So, why you bothering the old woman?

637
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:41,450
Get off of me!

638
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:44,286
- Ahh!
- She gonna spray you.

639
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,581
Maybe I take that away from you,
empty the whole thing in your face.

640
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:50,292
Burn your eyes out so you don't go
snooping where you're not supposed to.

641
00:34:50,375 --> 00:34:51,626
[Karen grunts] [man groans]

642
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,670
- Ahh!
- Stupid bitch!

643
00:34:56,423 --> 00:34:57,549
[men groaning]

644
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:02,721
Foggy? Oh, my God.

645
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:05,974
[panting] Wait... what are you doing here?

646
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:07,726
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

647
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,769
- What are you doing here?
- Are you following me?

648
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:11,229
- Yeah.
- [exasperated] Why?

649
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:14,148
Because you were acting
weird. I was worried about you.

650
00:35:14,941 --> 00:35:16,318
[man screaming]

651
00:35:17,777 --> 00:35:19,363
I can take care of myself.

652
00:35:19,446 --> 00:35:21,990
Let's discuss that away
from the maniacs, okay?

653
00:35:22,073 --> 00:35:24,283
- Come on!
- Oh, shit.

654
00:35:25,452 --> 00:35:26,870
[man groaning]

655
00:35:49,225 --> 00:35:50,977
How many do you read?

656
00:35:52,145 --> 00:35:54,356
I'm picking up a dozen heartbeats.

657
00:35:54,981 --> 00:35:57,651
Slow, steady, not even a flutter.

658
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:00,570
There's one more.

659
00:36:01,488 --> 00:36:02,697
Stronger...

660
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,241
different.

661
00:36:05,784 --> 00:36:07,160
Nobu.

662
00:36:08,077 --> 00:36:10,664
[Masked Man] They're armed.
MP7s with suppressors.

663
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,457
Huh.

664
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:14,208
Somebody wants things quiet.

665
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:16,044
We'll be quieter.

666
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:21,466
- You remember how to use these?
- I won't need 'em.

667
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,634
Yeah, you will.

668
00:36:23,552 --> 00:36:25,470
Thin out the herd.

669
00:36:25,554 --> 00:36:28,181
- I'll take care of the Black Sky.
- How?

670
00:36:28,264 --> 00:36:30,934
Just do your job, I'll do mine. Move.

671
00:37:29,283 --> 00:37:31,035
[loud thud]

672
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:53,683
[heart beating]

673
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:28,968
- [arrow whistling]
- [boy grunting]

674
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:30,679
[men shouting in Japanese]

675
00:38:33,765 --> 00:38:35,058
[speaking Japanese] Kill him!

676
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:37,769
[men grunting]

677
00:38:41,147 --> 00:38:42,398
Go!

678
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:54,619
[breathing heavily]

679
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,667
[Stick exclaiming]

680
00:39:08,257 --> 00:39:09,300
[exclaims]

681
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:10,468
Break.

682
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:12,721
What rules the body?

683
00:39:12,804 --> 00:39:13,847
My mind.

684
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,264
[grunting]

685
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:18,059
[Stick] What's your strongest weapon?

686
00:39:18,142 --> 00:39:19,227
My body.

687
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,945
Connection, mind, body?

688
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:32,866
The mind controls the body,
the body controls our enemies,

689
00:39:32,949 --> 00:39:36,160
our enemies control jack shit
by the time we're done with them.

690
00:39:36,244 --> 00:39:37,495
Right.

691
00:39:40,832 --> 00:39:42,959
Fighting is just the start.

692
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:48,590
You have to control your feelings...

693
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:51,175
your deep down inside feelings.

694
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:53,762
- How?
- Meditate.

695
00:39:53,845 --> 00:39:56,222
You mean that thing where
you pretend not to sleep?

696
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:57,891
[chuckling]

697
00:39:57,974 --> 00:40:00,644
Yeah. Yeah, that one.

698
00:40:01,936 --> 00:40:05,439
Open yourself up to it... learn it,

699
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:08,735
make you way stronger, more focused.

700
00:40:09,653 --> 00:40:11,946
Even heal your wounds faster.

701
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,072
You can do that?

702
00:40:13,156 --> 00:40:15,199
How do you think I'm still alive, kid?

703
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:17,201
I'll learn how, just like you.

704
00:40:17,285 --> 00:40:18,953
Good.

705
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:21,580
Tomorrow we start with knives.

706
00:40:21,665 --> 00:40:23,708
Try not to get stabbed.

707
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,670
- Stick?
- Yeah?

708
00:40:28,212 --> 00:40:30,214
I have something for you.

709
00:40:35,804 --> 00:40:37,847
It's a bracelet.

710
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:42,518
From the wrapper on the ice cream
you got me when we first met.

711
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,188
You remember?

712
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:47,691
I do.

713
00:40:57,826 --> 00:40:59,535
Your training is over.

714
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:02,706
I can't help you anymore.

715
00:41:08,169 --> 00:41:09,295
What?

716
00:41:10,588 --> 00:41:11,589
Why?

717
00:41:12,423 --> 00:41:13,507
[sighs]

718
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:15,760
I expected too much of you.

719
00:41:55,717 --> 00:41:57,761
You promised me you
weren't gonna kill anyone.

720
00:41:58,386 --> 00:41:59,512
Yep.

721
00:42:01,514 --> 00:42:03,557
Then what the hell was that back there?

722
00:42:03,641 --> 00:42:05,059
The mission.

723
00:42:07,061 --> 00:42:10,648
That's what your war's
come to? Killing children?

724
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:14,110
That thing in the
container was not a child.

725
00:42:14,193 --> 00:42:15,611
I could hear his heartbeat.

726
00:42:15,694 --> 00:42:18,447
It was light and fast. He
hadn't even hit puberty.

727
00:42:18,531 --> 00:42:20,992
- You're emotional.
- Yeah, no shit.

728
00:42:22,368 --> 00:42:26,080
If you'd have focused
beyond your crybaby feelings,

729
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:28,332
you would've sensed
what that kid really was.

730
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:30,084
He was just a kid.

731
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:33,296
You're blind as you ever were.

732
00:42:34,005 --> 00:42:37,175
Maybe you should've stuck around
and finished training me yourself.

733
00:42:37,258 --> 00:42:40,469
I needed a soldier. You wanted a father.

734
00:42:41,387 --> 00:42:43,890
Well, I guess we're both disappointed then.

735
00:42:43,973 --> 00:42:45,558
I guess we are.

736
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:46,768
[grunts]

737
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,939
You take care of yourself, Matty.

738
00:42:51,022 --> 00:42:52,648
I'm not gonna let you kill that kid.

739
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:55,276
Oh, he's already dead.

740
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,613
I caught up with the van while you
were dicking around with Nobu's men.

741
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:02,826
I put an arrow in that thing's heart.

742
00:43:03,451 --> 00:43:04,828
[Matt yelling]

743
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:20,634
You can't even tag an old man.

744
00:43:47,161 --> 00:43:48,371
Get up.

745
00:43:52,834 --> 00:43:54,043
Get up!

746
00:43:58,672 --> 00:43:59,924
Get up!

747
00:44:05,638 --> 00:44:06,722
[exclaims]

748
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:48,597
[groans]

749
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:52,143
[both breathing heavily]

750
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:02,320
Get out of my city.

751
00:45:02,403 --> 00:45:03,487
[grunts]

752
00:45:05,364 --> 00:45:07,075
[breathing heavily]

753
00:45:10,494 --> 00:45:12,871
Maybe there's hope for you yet.

754
00:45:13,497 --> 00:45:14,623
[laughs]

755
00:45:15,666 --> 00:45:16,750
[groaning]

756
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,091
[panting]

757
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,971
Nice catching up.

758
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:29,680
Eh?

759
00:45:30,556 --> 00:45:34,268
You can keep the sticks.
You're gonna need 'em.

760
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,658
What part of "Don't tell anyone
about this" didn't you understand?

761
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:51,410
Foggy's not just anyone... all right?

762
00:45:51,494 --> 00:45:52,911
He's a kick-ass attorney,

763
00:45:52,996 --> 00:45:54,956
and sooner or later we're
gonna need one of those.

764
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:58,084
And he just plain kicks ass.

765
00:45:59,210 --> 00:46:00,794
When the need arises.

766
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,465
[Karen] You can trust him, Ben.

767
00:46:04,548 --> 00:46:06,592
He's one of the good ones.

768
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:10,679
Show him the board.

769
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,683
All right, Ben has everything laid out...

770
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:19,397
all of the, uh, possible
connections... starting at the bottom...

771
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,774
and moving up.

772
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,901
The king of diamonds?

773
00:46:23,984 --> 00:46:25,569
The man at the top.

774
00:46:25,653 --> 00:46:27,113
Any idea who he is?

775
00:46:27,196 --> 00:46:28,531
No.

776
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:30,991
But I think he might have been
the one behind Union Allied.

777
00:46:31,075 --> 00:46:33,619
There's another player on the field.

778
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:36,080
Man in black.

779
00:46:36,164 --> 00:46:38,416
You think he's working for the king?

780
00:46:38,499 --> 00:46:39,792
No.

781
00:46:39,875 --> 00:46:43,879
No, he never would have helped
me expose Union Allied if he were.

782
00:46:45,214 --> 00:46:46,799
If that's the case...

783
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:49,635
they're working against each other.

784
00:46:50,678 --> 00:46:52,471
So the question is...

785
00:46:56,392 --> 00:46:58,477
which one trumps the other?

786
00:48:05,419 --> 00:48:06,712
It's done.

787
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:08,964
Black Sky...

788
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:12,385
no longer a threat.

789
00:48:13,386 --> 00:48:15,679
[man] For now.

790
00:48:15,763 --> 00:48:17,515
What about Murdock?

791
00:48:19,683 --> 00:48:23,103
Stubborn, immature...

792
00:48:23,187 --> 00:48:24,355
[laughs]

793
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:28,401
Still a real pain in the ass.

794
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:31,862
Will he be ready when the doors open?

795
00:48:35,032 --> 00:48:36,284
[sighs]

796
00:48:38,869 --> 00:48:41,789
I have no idea.

797
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:47,253
[dramatic music playing]
