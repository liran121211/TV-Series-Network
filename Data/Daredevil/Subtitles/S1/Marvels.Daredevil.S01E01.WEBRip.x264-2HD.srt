1
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:15,116
(Distant siren wailing)

2
00:00:26,419 --> 00:00:27,920
Move... please.

3
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:29,547
Matty.

4
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,049
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

5
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,884
(Man)
Don't move. Help is coming, kid.

6
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,554
That's my boy. That's my boy.

7
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:37,888
- Matty! Matty!
- Dad.

8
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,765
Matty! Matty!
Don't, don't move, okay?

9
00:00:39,848 --> 00:00:41,475
No, no, no! Just... Don't move.

10
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:42,976
Somebody get us some help!

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,687
- Dad, what happened?
- Matty, it's gonna be all right.

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,850
- Just don't move. Don't move, okay?
- What happened?

13
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:52,110
(Man)
Take it easy.

14
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,700
Your boy...
He pushed me out of the way.

15
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:00,411
He saved my life.

16
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,831
(Coughing)
Oh, Dad! Oh, it burns!

17
00:01:10,128 --> 00:01:11,297
Oh, Jesus!

18
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:14,842
Close your eyes, Matty.

19
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:16,344
- Dad!
- Close your eyes.

20
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:17,928
- Dad! Dad!
- Close your eyes.

21
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,513
Dad. Dad. Dad.

22
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,891
(Stuttering)
I can't see.

23
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:26,729
I can't see. I can't see!

24
00:01:26,812 --> 00:01:28,397
I can't see!

25
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:30,983
(Sirens approaching)

26
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:33,236
I can't see!

27
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,279
I can't see!

28
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:39,658
(Matt)
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

29
00:01:39,742 --> 00:01:41,159
It's been, uh...

30
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:45,163
It's been too long
since my last confession.

31
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:49,543
My dad, he used to come to this church
back when I was a kid.

32
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:52,880
He was a fighter. Old school. Boxer.

33
00:01:53,964 --> 00:01:58,386
Lost more than he won.
Had a 24-31 record before he, uh...

34
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,602
But he could take a punch.

35
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:09,104
- Jesus, he could take a punch.
- Language.

36
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:11,324
Sorry, Father.

37
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:16,945
Yeah, guys he went up against
used to say it was like hitting oak.

38
00:02:17,988 --> 00:02:20,032
And nights when he was outmatched,

39
00:02:20,115 --> 00:02:23,076
my dad's strategy was to let 'em hit him
till they broke their hands.

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,328
(Chuckles)

41
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,250
He never got knocked out, my dad.

42
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:33,546
Knocked down, sure.
But he, uh, always got back up.

43
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,425
He was always on his feet when he lost.

44
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,304
Every now and then, though, uh...

45
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,436
Every now and then, he'd get hit and...

46
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,649
something inside of him would snap.

47
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,571
My grandmother, she was the real Catholic.

48
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:01,490
Fear of God ran deep.
You'd have liked her.

49
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,704
She used to say,
"Be careful of the Murdock boys.

50
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,289
They got the devil in 'em."
(Chuckles)

51
00:03:12,376 --> 00:03:14,462
And you'd see it sometimes...

52
00:03:16,339 --> 00:03:17,756
in the ring.

53
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,220
His eyes would go dead...

54
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:28,266
and he'd start walking forward
real slow...

55
00:03:30,894 --> 00:03:33,564
hands at his sides,
like he wasn't afraid of anything.

56
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,232
(Sighs)

57
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:41,279
And the other guy, he'd see that look,
and he'd try to get away from him.

58
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:44,367
Nah.

59
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:48,412
My dad, he'd catch him
and... trap him in the corner.

60
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,962
Let the devil out.

61
00:03:59,214 --> 00:04:00,341
Yeah.

62
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,637
Now, I didn't understand it, you know?

63
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,266
What he was feeling deep inside,
I didn't understand it.

64
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:18,984
Not back then.

65
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,822
But you understand it now?

66
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,036
Perhaps this would be easier
if you tell me what you've done.

67
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,211
I'm not seeking penance
for what I've done, Father.

68
00:04:39,588 --> 00:04:41,424
I'm asking forgiveness...

69
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,385
for what I'm about to do.

70
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,012
That's not how this works.

71
00:04:49,347 --> 00:04:52,309
What exactly are you going to do?

72
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:55,062
(Girl)
Help!

73
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:56,647
Help! Help me!

74
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,650
Help! Help me!

75
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,984
(Girls screaming)

76
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,988
Hey! Hey!

77
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,532
Man, shut up.

78
00:05:06,615 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm getting $1,000 a head for y'all.

79
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,746
So, you be quiet...

80
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:16,166
I let you have a bucket.

81
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,668
You don't...

82
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:19,753
- (Crackling)
- (Screams)

83
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,300
(Girls screaming)

84
00:05:25,383 --> 00:05:27,302
- (Man speaking Russian)
- No!

85
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:30,347
(Girl sobbing)
No. Please, no.

86
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,099
Scream all you want.

87
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:33,767
Come on, let me hear you scream.

88
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:35,060
Scream loud.

89
00:05:35,143 --> 00:05:37,980
- (Girl) It's okay.
- (Turk) Nobody gives a shit down here.

90
00:05:38,063 --> 00:05:39,482
(Laughing)

91
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:40,858
(Screaming)

92
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:44,903
(Grunts)

93
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,157
(Man yelling)

94
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,834
(Grunting)

95
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:24,794
- (Bone cracking)
- (Man screams)

96
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,111
(Clicking)

97
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,668
(Footsteps on freight container)

98
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,194
(Grunts)

99
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,760
- (Water splashing)
- (Girls gasping)

100
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:13,742
Head towards 48th. Stay in the lights.
Flag down the first officer you see.

101
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,369
- Now!
- (Girls screaming)

102
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:26,797
(Grunting)

103

00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:47,169
(Automated female voice)
Foggy, Foggy, Foggy.

105
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,879
- Yeah, yeah.
- Foggy.

106
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:50,380
(Beeps)

107
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,506
Hello.

108
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:53,591
(Foggy)
Good morning, sunshine!

109
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:56,136
- What time is it?
- Half past get the hell up.

110
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:57,680
Let's go. We gotta meet

111
00:08:57,763 --> 00:08:59,848
- the real estate agent in 45.
- (Groans)

112
00:08:59,932 --> 00:09:02,142
What was that? Was that a moan?

113
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:03,977
- Do you have somebody in bed with you?
- (Groans)

114
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:06,855
The paralegal?
Is it the para over at...

115
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:08,540
Never mind, I don't wanna hear about it.

116
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:11,151
No, I do wanna hear about it!
What was she like?

117
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:13,946
(Exhales sharply)
Violent.

118
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:16,740
I gotta get the blind thing going.
It's so unfair.

119
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:19,910
Oh, hey! Real estate agent, not your type.

120
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:23,080
Very homely. Might be genetic.
No need to be charming.

121
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:26,041
And she kinda told me she thinks
blind people are "God's mistake."

122
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,877
That's a horrible thing to say, Foggy.

123
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:31,129
I know! In this day and age?

124
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:33,423
All right, shake it.
I gotta go bribe a cop.

125
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:34,591
Ah, Foggy.

126
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:36,760
Kidding, NSA, if you're listening.

127
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:39,972
But seriously, yeah,
I gotta go bribe a cop.

128
00:09:49,732 --> 00:09:52,359
Officer of the law.

129
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:55,612
Defense attorney.
We're supposed to be enemies.

130
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,949
First off, we've been enemies
since we were four, Brett,

131
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,159
so let's not blame it on career choices.

132
00:10:01,243 --> 00:10:04,872
Secondly, I'm not
a particularly good defense attorney,

133
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:07,249
so helping me is like helping yourself.

134
00:10:07,332 --> 00:10:10,168
And finally, these are for Bess.

135
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,591
Please stop giving my mom cigars, Foggy.

136
00:10:16,674 --> 00:10:18,593
What? She'll outlive us all.

137
00:10:18,676 --> 00:10:20,846
Look, I'm not asking you
to do anything immoral.

138
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,139
Just give me a heads up

139
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,808
if something, you know,
interesting walks through the door.

140
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:28,729
You're right. It ain't the careers.

141
00:10:29,813 --> 00:10:31,314
Thanks, buddy!

142
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,192
(Sighs deeply)

143
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:40,115
You've got a reception area,
a conference room and two offices.

144
00:10:40,198 --> 00:10:42,242
Corner suite has a view of the Hudson.

145
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,085
You can flip a coin
with your partner for it.

146
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:45,495
Uh, he can have the view.

147
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,750
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to...

148
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,001
- Of course not.
- (Chuckles)

149
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,630
Susan Harris.
Midtown Property Solutions.

150
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:57,215
Matt Murdock.

151
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,467
(Chuckles)

152
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,595
She just curtsied. It was adorable.

153
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,515
Well, it's nice to know
chivalry isn't dead.

154
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,393
Susan, would you mind
walking me around the space?

155
00:11:08,476 --> 00:11:10,938
Of course. My pleasure.

156
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:13,231
As I was telling your associate,

157
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:15,901
this office was barely touched
by the incident,

158
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:17,945
which is why it's on the market already.

159
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:19,737
The neighbors weren't so lucky.

160
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,908
"The incident"?
Is that what we're calling it now?

161
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,910
Well, it sounds so much better than

162
00:11:24,993 --> 00:11:26,744
"death and destruction
raining from the sky,

163
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:28,621
nearly wiping Hell's Kitchen off the map."

164
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:29,998
Shorter, too.

165
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:34,211
Owner figuring in the delightful view
of cranes and scaffolding?

166
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,338
Feels like we're getting
pre-incident prices.

167
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:38,673
They're a quarter of what they used to be.

168
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:40,633
Hell's Kitchen's on the rebound,
Mr. Nelson,

169
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:41,969
and in 18 months,

170
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,452
you won't be able to
rent a broom closet at this price point.

171
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:45,722
We'll take it.

172
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,015
(Chuckling)

173
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:49,226
We will talk about it.

174
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,395
Because we're not sure
we can afford even this palace,

175
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,398
unless we make some changes
to our current clientele policies.

176
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,192
My partner and I
are having some disagreements

177
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,027
over the direction of Nelson and Murdock.

178
00:11:59,111 --> 00:12:00,831
I believe we're here
to defend the innocent.

179
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:04,324
And I believe the innocent includes
everyone not yet convicted of a crime.

180
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,201
You know, as the law states.

181
00:12:06,284 --> 00:12:08,245
He tends to use fancy terminology.

182
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,831
And my partner fails to recognize
that, as defense attorneys,

183
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:13,666
we're never gonna be able
to keep the lights on,

184
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,712
waiting on a horde of innocent souls
to stumble into our loving arms.

185
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:20,465
At this point, I'd settle for just one.

186
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:26,304
(Shuddering breath)

187
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:35,480
Drop the knife!

188
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:37,482
- No, no, I didn't...
- Drop it!

189
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:39,734
I didn't do this! I didn't...
I didn't do this!

190
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:41,486
- Get on the ground!
- I didn't do this!

191
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:43,030
- Now!
- Oh, God!

192
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:44,447
(Sobbing)
Oh, God!

193
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,992
(Sobbing)
No, I didn't do this.

194
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,037
Oh, God! I didn't do this!

195
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,163
Oh, no!

196
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:54,832
I didn't do this!

197
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:04,134
(Cell phone ringing)

198
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,345
(Chuckles)

199
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:09,181
- Hey, buddy.
- (Brett) Homicide.

200
00:13:09,264 --> 00:13:13,476
Female suspect found at the scene.
Definitely qualifies as interesting.

201
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:15,520
She's been charged yet?

202
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,605
Assistant DA hasn't made the call yet.

203
00:13:17,689 --> 00:13:19,107
Do you have a name on the suspect?

204
00:13:19,191 --> 00:13:21,359
Yeah. Page.

205
00:13:21,443 --> 00:13:23,153
- Karen Page.
- (Door opening)

206
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,036
Okay, can we please take the handcuffs off
the 110-pound woman?

207
00:13:31,119 --> 00:13:34,247
Miss Page, can you tell me
who these men are?

208
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:35,582
We're her lawyers.

209
00:13:35,665 --> 00:13:37,506
Uncuff our client
and give us the room, please.

210
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,551
(Karen sighs)

211
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,928
Thank you, Detective.

212
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:58,105
(Door lock buzzes)

213
00:13:58,188 --> 00:14:02,025
Miss Page, my name is Matt Murdock.
This is my associate, Foggy Nelson.

214
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,526
Do you mind if we sit down?

215
00:14:05,695 --> 00:14:08,573
She gave a vague shrug.
I say we go with it.

216
00:14:10,492 --> 00:14:13,661
We understand you're in some trouble.

217
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:15,705
We, uh, may be able to help.

218
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:18,041
(Foggy)
Can you tell us what happened?

219
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:23,588
Why don't we start
with what we know, then?

220
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:25,382
(Sighs)

221
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:28,969
You were found in your apartment
with one Daniel Fisher.

222
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:31,429
Who appears to be
the victim of a homicide,

223
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:33,306
and currently,
you're the only suspect, Miss Page.

224
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,849
Who the hell are you guys?

225
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,726
I'm Matt.
He's Foggy.

226
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,104
Who sent you?

227
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:40,897
No one sent us.

228
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,526
So, what?
You're just a couple of Good Samaritans?

229
00:14:45,943 --> 00:14:47,654
Today's just my lucky day?

230
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:51,074
I bribed the desk sergeant
with a box of cigars for his mom.

231
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,909
(Matt) Our practice is relatively young,
Miss Page,

232
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,287
and we are aggressively pursuing
new clientele.

233
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,746
You gotta stop giving Bess cigars.

234
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:59,457
She likes to smoke, Matt.
It's a free country.

235
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:02,669
So how long have you been practicing law?

236
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,463
What time is it?

237
00:15:05,547 --> 00:15:07,590
It's 12:22 a.m.

238
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:08,966
About seven hours.

239
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:10,093
(Scoffs)

240
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:11,553
Well, if you go from
when we passed the bar...

241
00:15:11,636 --> 00:15:12,887
I was going from
when we got our own desks.

242
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,182
Oh, then, yeah.
Seven hours.

243
00:15:16,641 --> 00:15:18,351
You've never done this before?

244
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:22,272
If you were to hire us, then, yes,
you would be our first client.

245
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,731
Technically. Yeah.

246
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,694
Well, I don't...
I don't have any money.

247
00:15:28,653 --> 00:15:31,198
Well, it was lovely to meet you,
Miss Page.

248
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:32,365
(Matt clearing throat)

249
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,012
You don't have any money
and we don't have any clients.

250
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,413
Maybe we can help each other.

251
00:15:38,496 --> 00:15:40,248
Tell me, how did you know Mr. Fisher?

252
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:43,668
We worked together.

253
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:47,589
(Sighs)

254
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,924
And your place of employment?

255
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:53,261
Union Allied Construction.

256
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:56,389
I'm a secretary.

257
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:00,477
Daniel worked downstairs in Legal.

258
00:16:01,103 --> 00:16:05,148
(Stuttering) I didn't know him very well.
But he was always nice, you know?

259
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:08,235
But it's hard to meet people in the city,

260
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:10,528
so I asked him
if he would have a drink with me.

261
00:16:10,612 --> 00:16:12,197
You asked him?

262
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,367
(Voice breaking)
Like I said, he was a nice guy.

263
00:16:17,827 --> 00:16:21,206
We met at the Three Roads bar,
on 49th Street.

264
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:23,791
We had a few drinks,
and the next thing that I remember

265
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:27,420
is waking up on the floor of my apartment
covered in blood.

266
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:28,671
His blood.

267
00:16:30,132 --> 00:16:32,759
No, I'm not stupid.
I know how that sounds.

268
00:16:33,968 --> 00:16:37,264
But I am telling you we met at the bar.
We had a few drinks.

269
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:40,183
And I don't know what happened after that.

270
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,977
It wasn't me.

271
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:44,812
Please.

272
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,689
(Heart beating steadily)

273
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:49,734
Please, you have to believe me.
(Sniffles)

274
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:51,819
I didn't kill him.

275
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:57,450
I believe you, Miss Page.

276
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:16,344
(Sighs)

277
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,230
There's plenty of room over there.
Do you mind?

278
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:25,102
28,957.

279
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,524
Tell Rigoletto he'll get his money.

280
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:31,568
Mr. Rigoletto has retired.

281
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,487
His books have been acquired
by my employer.

282
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:37,199
Ah. Well, you tell him the same thing.

283
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,202
I'd like to show you something.

284
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,206
Do you have a moment?

285
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,725
What is it about college girls
and Monet T-shirts?

286
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:07,187
Open composition and
the spontaneity reflecting

287
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:10,565
this transformative time
in their lives, perhaps?

288
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:14,402
Or maybe they just
like the color blue.

289
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:16,654
Call her.

290
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:25,663
(Line ringing)

291
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:31,461
Hey, Dad, what's up?

292
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:33,421
(Man)
Hi, baby, I'm just checking in.

293
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:36,173
You need anything?

294
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:39,969
Uh, yeah,
I actually have a ton of laundry.

295
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,639
I was gonna swing by this weekend
and use the machine.

296
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,642
And then, maybe we could
catch a movie after your shift?

297
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:48,102
Yeah, yeah.
That'd be great.

298
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:49,937
Uh, look...

299
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:52,940
Baby, I got...
I gotta go. I love you, baby.

300
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,984
Love you, too. Bye, Dad.

301
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,491
Now, you see this man here?

302
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:04,869
If we're being honest
with each other, Mr. Farnum,

303
00:19:04,952 --> 00:19:07,914
I find his methods unpleasant.

304
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,752
But such are the times we live in.

305
00:19:14,296 --> 00:19:16,423
Give us a wave, Mr. Rance.

306
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:25,598
I told you that I will get you the money.

307
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:29,394
Such a small sum
is of little interest to my employer.

308
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:33,105
Your position, however,
that's something we can work with.

309
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:36,693
(Man sighs)

310
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,074
What do you want me to do?

311
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:48,996
I'm friends with Gary Feinstein
in the DA's office.

312
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,206
I'll give him a call
first thing in the morning,

313
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,458
see where their heads are at.

314
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:53,852
I'm guessing
they're gonna puff their chests,

315
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,128
but they have to know murder two's a risk.

316
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,423
We end up at manslaughter,
we get the right judge,

317
00:19:58,506 --> 00:20:00,425
- maybe she's out in five to 10...
- We're not taking a deal.

318
00:20:00,508 --> 00:20:01,884
No, this is why they have deals, Matt.

319
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:03,928
So the straightforward cases
don't waste everybody's time.

320
00:20:04,011 --> 00:20:05,305
I don't think she did it.

321
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:10,226
She's the sole suspect,
found at the scene, covered in blood,

322
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,063
with the murder weapon
and no defensive wounds.

323
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:17,400
If they offer anything it'll be a gift,
and we will take that gift.

324
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:19,110
We do not want this to go to trial.

325
00:20:19,193 --> 00:20:20,236
They don't want this
to go to trial, either.

326
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,600
Why hasn't she been charged yet?

327
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:24,156
They have 24 hours.
And it's the weekend.

328
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,367
They're gonna take
every last second

329
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,659
to collect the evidence
before they move.

330
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:29,036
They've got the evidence.
You just laid it out yourself.

331
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,955
This is a good arrest, Foggy.

332
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,833
We should already
be reading about it in the papers.

333
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,236
There's something not right
about this case. I can feel it.

334
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,421
You can feel it?

335
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:42,091
All right, I'm just gonna say this once,
and we can move on.

336
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:45,177
You don't necessarily
show the best judgment

337
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,638
when beautiful women are involved, Matt.

338
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:47,972
How would I even know
if she's a beautiful woman?

339
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:50,558
I don't know.
It's kinda spooky, actually.

340
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:53,853
But if there's a stunning woman
with questionable character in the room,

341
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:56,773
Matt Murdock's gonna find her
and Foggy Nelson is gonna suffer.

342
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,817
(Chuckling) All right, I don't disagree
with anything you're saying.

343
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:02,945
- Thank you.
- But I need you to back me, anyway.

344
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,280
(Groans)

345
00:21:05,782 --> 00:21:09,076
All right. Fine.
Let's start with the obvious, then.

346
00:21:09,994 --> 00:21:11,413
If she didn't do it, who did?

347
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:14,081
We're dead in the water
if we don't give them an alternative.

348
00:21:14,165 --> 00:21:15,375
Agreed.

349
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,170
We need to take
another run at our client.

350
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:23,257
She may not be guilty, Matt,

351
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,510
but that doesn't mean
Miss Page is telling the truth.

352
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:32,684
(Muffled screaming)

353
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:42,944
(Shrieks)

354
00:21:45,196 --> 00:21:46,656
(Cop grunting)

355
00:21:48,783 --> 00:21:50,034
(Gagging)

356
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,167
(Panting)

357
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,419
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:59,502 --> 00:22:01,671
I'm... I'm sorry.

359
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,175
(Both grunting)

360
00:22:07,469 --> 00:22:08,595
(Screaming)

361
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,431
(Cop groaning)

362
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:13,516
(Panting)

363
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:16,102
(Screaming)

364
00:22:16,185 --> 00:22:17,437
(Indistinct)

365
00:22:25,069 --> 00:22:27,113
I'm gonna make this easy, Detectives.

366
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,990
Get the ADA in here
to release Miss Page

367
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:32,451
and we'll recommend
to our charming, media-friendly client

368
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:35,788
that she not plaster the airwaves with
how she was nearly killed in your custody.

369
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:38,625
And I'll agree not to make cooing noises
for the rest of this meeting

370
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:40,949
when I think of the civil suit
that we have on our hands.

371
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:42,336
How do you know they're not charging her?

372
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:45,256
Besides the fact that you were required
to do so four hours ago...

373
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:47,383
if you were gonna do it at all?

374
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,260
That's an excellent question.

375
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:51,903
Along with how the security cameras
on Miss Page's detention area

376
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:53,609
went on the fritz
right before the assault.

377
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,361
Yeah, we'd like to speak to Mr. Farnum
about that, as well as what...

378
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:58,019
Get in line.
He'll be arraigned in the morning.

379
00:22:58,102 --> 00:23:00,271
Get my client released.
Don't make me ask again.

380
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,358
(Whispering)

381
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,197
I'll call the ADA.

382
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:14,035
But you take that tone with me again,
I don't care if you're blind,

383
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:16,538
I'll kick the shit out of you.

384
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:18,665
Really?
We're going there?

385
00:23:23,961 --> 00:23:25,922
(Scoffs)
That was pleasant.

386
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,424
It doesn't make any sense.

387
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,885
ADA had everything they needed.

388
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:33,470
Unless they had too much.

389
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,973
What?
What am I missing?

390
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,911
Maybe someone else
was in her apartment that night.

391
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:40,186
Maybe they have evidence.

392
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:42,063
That's Brady material.
They'd have to turn that over.

393
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:43,522
Only if she were charged.

394
00:23:43,606 --> 00:23:46,818
She hangs herself in her cell,
this all goes away.

395
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,630
(Exhales sharply)
Let's get her some clothes

396
00:23:49,654 --> 00:23:50,905
and get the hell out of here.

397
00:23:58,245 --> 00:24:01,708
Couldn't find any milk.
I hope it's okay.

398
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:02,959
(Matt)
We have tea now?

399
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,461
(Foggy) I stole it from
the financial office next door.

400
00:24:09,716 --> 00:24:10,758
(Sighs)

401
00:24:10,842 --> 00:24:12,051
How are you holding up?

402
00:24:12,134 --> 00:24:13,344
Better.

403
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:16,555
Thanks for getting me out.

404
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:17,807
(Foggy)
Don't thank us yet.

405
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,090
Just because they released you

406
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,685
doesn't mean
they won't eventually bring charges.

407
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:22,561
(Matt) Which means it's crucial
you don't speak to anyone

408
00:24:22,645 --> 00:24:25,522
other than the two of us
about what happened.

409
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:29,318
I don't have anyone to talk to, anyway.

410
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,546
Do you have somewhere
you can stay tonight?

411
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,615
My apartment's not far.

412
00:24:33,698 --> 00:24:36,075
You can't go back there.

413
00:24:36,158 --> 00:24:40,037
Miss Page, our immediate priority
is to keep you safe.

414
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:43,040
And in order to do that, we're gonna need
to have a frank discussion.

415
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:46,961
Okay.

416
00:24:47,503 --> 00:24:49,088
Do you know who's trying to kill you?

417
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,548
No.

418
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:54,176
Do you know why
they're trying to kill you?

419
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:01,433
Yes.

420
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,771
- (Recording machine turns on)
- (Karen) I, uh, work...

421
00:25:06,022 --> 00:25:10,359
Worked in the financial department
at Union Allied.

422
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:14,238
They're overseeing
the bulk of the government contracts

423
00:25:14,321 --> 00:25:15,823
for the West Side reconstruction.

424
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:18,117
I've seen their signs
all over Hell's Kitchen.

425
00:25:19,786 --> 00:25:23,039
The last two years
have transformed the business.

426
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,208
There's new owners, new grants,
new contracts.

427
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:29,420
Yeah, the world watched
half of New York get destroyed.

428
00:25:29,503 --> 00:25:30,838
That's a lot of sympathy.

429
00:25:30,922 --> 00:25:34,926
And Union Allied benefited
from every dollar of it.

430
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:39,722
I was the secretary
for the chief accountant.

431
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:43,434
And one of my jobs...

432
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:48,397
was to coordinate the pension claims
for the company.

433
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:55,029
About a week ago, I was emailed a file
called, "Pension Master."

434
00:25:57,949 --> 00:26:01,660
It must have been meant for my boss,
but I made the mistake of opening it.

435
00:26:01,744 --> 00:26:03,579
I'm guessing it wasn't the pension fund.

436
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:08,835
It wasn't the size of the pension fund.

437
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:13,339
I couldn't believe the numbers.

438
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,135
But it was still being designated
as company pension.

439
00:26:18,219 --> 00:26:22,098
And it was constantly adjusted.
Money coming in and money going out.

440
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,891
- Going where?
- I don't know.

441
00:26:23,975 --> 00:26:28,520
It was coded routing numbers,
but we are talking a lot of money.

442
00:26:28,604 --> 00:26:30,647
What did you do with the file?

443
00:26:31,941 --> 00:26:36,946
Well, I told my boss, Mr. McClintock,
about it, and he laughed it off.

444
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:42,827
He said that it was a theoretical model
that they were screwing around with.

445
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,454
I knew something was wrong.

446
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:50,835
I just... I thought maybe
it was just him, you know?

447
00:26:50,918 --> 00:26:52,837
Embezzling or whatever.

448
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,884
So, how did Daniel Fisher
figure into this?

449
00:26:57,967 --> 00:27:00,552
Danny worked in the legal department.

450
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:05,557
And I didn't know him very well.

451
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,228
But he was nice,
so I asked him to meet me after work.

452
00:27:10,687 --> 00:27:12,774
I don't know how they knew.

453
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,652
They must have people watching me.

454
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,530
They must have people everywhere.

455
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:23,034
All I did was ask him for a drink.

456
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:27,454
And I start to tell him
about what I found

457
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:29,165
and things got blurry.

458
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:30,958
Like I was drugged.

459
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:36,088
And the next thing I know,
I wake up... back in my apartment,

460
00:27:36,172 --> 00:27:37,631
covered in blood.

461
00:27:42,636 --> 00:27:44,180
They killed him...

462
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,600
because of me.

463
00:27:50,186 --> 00:27:51,770
And he had a family.

464
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,691
A little boy.

465
00:27:59,754 --> 00:28:02,674
- I need to get out of here. I'm sorry.
- We can't advise that, Miss Page.

466
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:05,827
No, you don't understand.
Either you're with them or you're not.

467
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,578
And if you're with them,
then I'm dead already.

468
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:11,040
And if you are not, then I cannot
have anybody else die because of me.

469
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:13,542
- We can protect ourselves, Miss Page.
- No, you can't. Not from them.

470
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:14,626
- Miss Page...
- No.

471
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,587
- We can't let you go home.
- Please, just...

472
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,217
(Sobbing)

473
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:26,722
She can stay with me.

474
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,266
Just for tonight,
until we figure something out.

475
00:28:31,853 --> 00:28:33,645
I'll keep you safe, Karen.

476
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:45,491
I don't have much in the way of food,
but there's a Thai place on the corner.

477
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,805
If we order now, it should get here
by the time I make up the bedroom for you.

478
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,788
It's a little dark in here.

479
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:53,207
I never...

480
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,043
Uh, light switch
is on the wall to your left.

481
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:58,963
So, uh, (sighs) want some food?

482
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:00,547
Uh, no, I'm not...

483
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:04,426
Would you have a shirt
I could borrow, maybe?

484
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,638
This one's a little wet,
and I'm a Hellions fan.

485
00:29:07,721 --> 00:29:10,141
(Chuckles)
Then don't tell Foggy.

486
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:12,894
Let me grab something for you.

487
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:14,728
And, really,
I can't put you out of your bedroom.

488
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:16,355
I'll be just fine on the couch.

489
00:29:16,438 --> 00:29:19,859
From what I understand
about my living room,

490
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:21,861
that might not be true.

491
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:34,540
Holy shit!

492
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:35,791
(Matt)
Went up a year ago.

493
00:29:37,793 --> 00:29:40,129
I'm told the co-op nearly rioted,

494
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:43,215
some oversight from
the developer's agreement.

495
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,593
Upside is, nobody wanted it

496
00:29:46,677 --> 00:29:48,888
and I got a corner apartment
at a hell of a discount.

497
00:29:55,144 --> 00:29:56,353
Thanks.

498
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,493
Can I ask a personal question?

499
00:30:14,038 --> 00:30:15,872
I haven't always been blind.

500
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:19,043
I guess that's what
everyone wants to know.

501
00:30:19,126 --> 00:30:21,753
That or, "How do you comb your hair?"

502
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:23,755
How do you comb your hair?

503
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:26,842
Honestly, you just...
You hope for the best.

504
00:30:28,552 --> 00:30:29,886
Thank you.

505
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:35,226
You wanna sit?

506
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,188
How did it happen?

507
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:42,524
Car accident.

508
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,944
When I was nine.

509
00:30:45,027 --> 00:30:46,487
Must have been rough.

510
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,198
No. I made it through.

511
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:54,536
Do you remember what it was like...

512
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,705
To... To see?

513
00:30:58,332 --> 00:30:59,416
I, um...

514
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,461
Yes, I remember.

515
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,797
I can't imagine what that must be like.

516
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:07,174
(Chuckles)

517
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:12,554
You know,
I'm supposed to say I don't miss it.

518
00:31:14,223 --> 00:31:16,183
That's what they teach you
in trauma recovery.

519
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:18,644
Define yourself by what you have,

520
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:22,398
value the differences,
make no apologies for what you lack.

521
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:27,153
And it's all true, for the most part...

522
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:33,950
but it doesn't change the fact that I...

523
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:37,913
I'd give anything
to see the sky one more time.

524
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,798
Do you mind
if I ask you some questions now?

525
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:55,639
Uh...

526
00:31:55,722 --> 00:31:57,162
- Go ahead.
- You just nodded, right?

527
00:31:57,224 --> 00:31:58,267
(Chuckles)

528
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,644
Uh, yeah.

529
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:01,853
Okay.

530
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:07,026
Here's what I don't understand.

531
00:32:08,902 --> 00:32:10,446
(Clears throat)

532
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,490
I'm the man in charge of the pension funds

533
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:18,495
and I find out one of my secretaries
has discovered my illicit activity.

534
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:19,663
To make matters worse,

535
00:32:19,746 --> 00:32:22,208
she's now telling people
about said activity.

536
00:32:22,291 --> 00:32:24,210
Which, obviously, I can't have.

537
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:26,920
So I decide to take action.

538
00:32:29,506 --> 00:32:30,966
But why don't I kill you?

539
00:32:32,093 --> 00:32:33,219
They tried.

540
00:32:33,844 --> 00:32:35,762
Yeah, the second time.
In the jail.

541
00:32:35,846 --> 00:32:38,807
But the first time,
they left you alive. Why?

542
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,479
What were they trying to do?
Frame you?

543
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:48,484
Now, the second time,
maybe that's a change of plan.

544
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:52,363
Something doesn't go their way,
something sloppy at the crime scene.

545
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:55,449
Two lawyers show up out of the blue
before their people can get to you.

546
00:32:56,992 --> 00:32:59,828
So they figure, okay,
maybe Karen hangs herself in her cell,

547
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,997
and this thing gets swept under the rug.

548
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,708
But the first time...

549
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,020
The first time,
they're not trying to kill you.

550
00:33:08,044 --> 00:33:10,797
They're trying to discredit you.
They're trying to scare you.

551
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:13,717
And the only reason
that they would do that...

552
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:17,429
is if you have something that they want.

553
00:33:20,891 --> 00:33:23,059
So, I've been trying to think about
what that could be,

554
00:33:23,144 --> 00:33:25,729
and the only thing I've come up with...

555
00:33:25,812 --> 00:33:27,648
(Heart beating)

556
00:33:27,731 --> 00:33:30,109
is the Union Allied pension file.

557
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,947
Did you keep the file, Karen?

558
00:33:38,074 --> 00:33:39,785
(Beating grows faster)

559
00:33:39,868 --> 00:33:41,328
No.

560
00:33:44,373 --> 00:33:47,334
As soon as I asked my boss about it,
he took it away from me.

561
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:53,424
The IT guys, they came
and they wiped the computers.

562
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:58,929
Believe me, a part of me wishes
I'd made a copy for myself...

563
00:34:01,056 --> 00:34:03,225
but I guess I'm just not that smart.

564
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:07,688
Ah, well, it was just a thought.

565
00:34:25,706 --> 00:34:28,417
It's freezing this high up.

566
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,544
Next time we're meeting at Per Se.

567
00:34:31,753 --> 00:34:33,672
I'll domesticate you boys yet.

568
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:36,883
This would be a balmy day
in Samara, Leland.

569
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:41,722
Yes, it's perfect Chechnyans-kidnap-
a-preschool weather, Vladimir.

570
00:34:43,474 --> 00:34:45,100
(Sighs)

571
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:49,730
Can you at least pretend to be cold?
It's unsettling.

572
00:34:49,813 --> 00:34:51,273
(Laughing)

573
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,567
(Speaking Mandarin)

574
00:34:59,656 --> 00:35:01,492
Anyone here speak Chinese?

575
00:35:03,076 --> 00:35:04,536
Nobu?

576
00:35:05,662 --> 00:35:07,331
The man is Japanese.

577
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:09,916
I know, I know.
I just thought that...

578
00:35:10,834 --> 00:35:12,002
Forget it.

579
00:35:14,004 --> 00:35:15,506
(Elevator door opens)

580
00:35:19,926 --> 00:35:22,471
Oh, please tell me he's right behind you.

581
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:26,016
Unfortunately, my employer
is attending to other matters.

582
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:29,936
He apologizes to you in particular,
Madame Gao.

583
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,230
(Speaking Russian)

584
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:34,525
We do not deal with lap dogs.

585
00:35:34,608 --> 00:35:35,901
Tell Mister...

586
00:35:35,984 --> 00:35:38,612
We don't say his name.

587
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:43,199
Woof, woof.

588
00:35:43,784 --> 00:35:47,454
(Man) He would like to know
why you're short on the cargo totals.

589
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,627
There was a problem on the docks.

590
00:35:54,753 --> 00:35:59,383
Barrett and our men were attacked.
Some moodak in a black mask.

591
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:01,427
(Laughs)
And you bought that?

592
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,845
- (Speaking Russian)
- (Leland) Okay, calm down.

593
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,140
Fine, we'll go with
the man-in-black story.

594
00:36:07,223 --> 00:36:10,226
Our men would not lie.

595
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:12,020
I said I'm on board.

596
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:17,276
I'm glad to hear there's some new blood
running around out there.

597
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:22,948
Heroes and their consequences
are why we have our current opportunities.

598
00:36:23,865 --> 00:36:26,743
Now can we review
the latest numbers and...

599
00:36:26,827 --> 00:36:29,330
Tell me more about this man.

600
00:36:29,413 --> 00:36:33,292
Took Barrett and our guys out
while they were loading the container.

601
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:34,751
(Speaking Mandarin)

602
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,053
(Chuckles)

603
00:36:45,136 --> 00:36:48,307
She wants to know if this man
stole the shipment for himself.

604
00:36:49,224 --> 00:36:50,266
No.

605
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:53,228
He let the women go.

606
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:57,273
He took out your men. How?

607
00:36:57,941 --> 00:36:59,109
Caught them by surprise.

608
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:01,027
Beat them.

609
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:04,406
- With his bare hands.
- Four men with his bare hands?

610
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,117
That is what we were told.

611
00:37:07,618 --> 00:37:10,120
Perhaps you should
have been there yourself.

612
00:37:10,203 --> 00:37:14,458
(Scoffs) Again, I have to ask,
why do we care?

613
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:17,503
Every time one of these guys
punches someone through a building,

614
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:19,546
our margins go up 3%.

615
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,672
We should be celebrating.

616
00:37:20,756 --> 00:37:21,965
This is different.

617
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,759
My employer will be...

618
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:26,052
displeased...

619
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,015
we're being inconvenienced
by a lone vigilante.

620
00:37:30,098 --> 00:37:32,351
Then he should tell me to my face.

621
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:37,606
This is on you. Deal with it. Quietly.

622
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,858
We must be quiet, yes.

623
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:44,780
We would not want another
Union Allied situation, would we?

624
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:48,033
Big, loud, lot of questions.

625
00:37:48,116 --> 00:37:49,368
We're handling it.

626
00:37:49,451 --> 00:37:52,078
Like you keep saying
you're handling Prohaszka?

627
00:37:52,162 --> 00:37:54,164
We're in the process of negotiating
with Mr. Prohaszka.

628
00:37:54,247 --> 00:37:55,832
Negotiating?

629
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:58,544
Maybe we handle our problem same way.

630
00:37:58,627 --> 00:38:01,004
Sit down with this man in black,
break bread.

631
00:38:01,087 --> 00:38:06,092
I think what Anatoly's trying to say
is that it would be in our best interests

632
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:10,931
for Union Allied to be tidied up
as expeditiously as possible.

633
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:12,724
As I said...

634
00:38:15,394 --> 00:38:17,062
we're handling it.

635
00:39:00,606 --> 00:39:02,315
(Thunder rumbling)

636
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:06,695
(Door creaking)

637
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,334
(Sniffles)

638
00:39:22,085 --> 00:39:23,336
(Breathing heavily)

639
00:39:40,521 --> 00:39:41,813
(Sighing)

640
00:39:53,617 --> 00:39:54,785
(Screaming)

641
00:40:07,673 --> 00:40:08,840
(Clicks)

642
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,811
(Both yelling)

643
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:31,988
- (Bones cracking)
- Ahhh!

644
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:00,141
(Straining)

645
00:41:33,759 --> 00:41:35,260
(Jack)
Get up, Matty.

646
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,220
Hey.

647
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,681
Let's go, finish up.

648
00:41:46,354 --> 00:41:47,898
I'm tired, Dad.

649
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,569
Hey, I don't want you to
end up like your old man.

650
00:41:55,864 --> 00:41:57,448
I never studied.

651
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,244
Look where it got me.

652
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:43,829
Come on, Matty.
Get to work.

653
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:05,350
(Both grunting)

654
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,526
(Grunting)

655
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:45,098
(Grunting)

656
00:43:55,776 --> 00:43:57,861
- (Bone cracking)
- Ahhh!

657
00:44:08,955 --> 00:44:10,623
(Metal clinking)

658
00:44:16,838 --> 00:44:18,381
(Groaning)

659
00:44:25,972 --> 00:44:27,182
(Grunting)

660
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:30,185
(Panting)

661
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,152
(Groaning)

662
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:50,163
Who...

663
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,627
What the hell?

664
00:44:57,753 --> 00:45:00,298
I'll get this into the right hands.

665
00:45:00,381 --> 00:45:01,842
No, you can't.

666
00:45:02,843 --> 00:45:06,387
You can't take it to the police.
You can't trust anyone.

667
00:45:08,389 --> 00:45:10,141
Then we tell everyone.

668
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,109
(Breathing heavily)

669
00:45:24,697 --> 00:45:27,742
DNA evidence
will put Rance at the murder scene.

670
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:31,287
B and E gone sideways,
his records altered in support.

671
00:45:31,371 --> 00:45:35,625
Mr. Farnum's bail has been arranged for
through the usual channels.

672
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:38,169
Leland's to cover our exposure
on the financials

673
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:40,713
and McClintock takes the fall
for Union Allied.

674
00:45:40,796 --> 00:45:44,050
(Man on phone) We can't have McClintock
speaking to the authorities.

675
00:45:44,134 --> 00:45:45,510
Pills.

676
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:48,804
He overdosed less than an hour ago.

677
00:45:48,889 --> 00:45:51,391
The remaining concerns
will be attended to shortly.

678
00:45:51,474 --> 00:45:54,435
Rance was a professional.
How was he subdued?

679
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:57,981
I'm looking into it.

680
00:45:58,064 --> 00:46:00,441
What about the girl?

681
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:03,528
Should I make the appropriate arrangements
for her, along with the others?

682
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:06,907
No. Everything she knows
is already in the papers.

683
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:10,035
Her lawyers, Nelson and Murdock.

684
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:12,954
Ambulance chasers. They're clean.

685
00:46:13,038 --> 00:46:15,290
Start a file. They may be of use.

686
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,750
Understood.

687
00:46:19,252 --> 00:46:20,853
- (Karen) Here you go.
- (Both chuckling)

688
00:46:21,055 --> 00:46:22,856
- (Karen) So I know it's not much...
- (Matt) Hmm.

689
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,965
in the way of repayment.

690
00:46:24,049 --> 00:46:26,551
But it is, um, my grandmother's recipe,

691
00:46:26,634 --> 00:46:30,096
and she made me promise
only to serve it to my future husband.

692
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,306
(Matt chuckles)

693
00:46:31,389 --> 00:46:33,934
You know, it's, like,
filled with virtue or something.

694
00:46:34,017 --> 00:46:36,978
I thought I detected
a whiff of virtue in there.

695
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:38,438
Not that I'm complaining,

696
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:40,440
but you really should be
thanking the nut in the mask.

697
00:46:40,523 --> 00:46:41,899
He's not a nut.

698
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:45,671
- I mean, he's a little weird, maybe...
- We're just glad you're okay.

699
00:46:45,695 --> 00:46:46,904
(Foggy)
Hear, hear!

700
00:46:48,073 --> 00:46:51,284
Well, if it weren't for you two,
I'd still be in that cell.

701
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:52,618
Hmm.

702
00:46:52,702 --> 00:46:57,290
Job's easy when your client's innocent.
All you did was tell the truth.

703
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:00,376
Yeah, but you listened.

704
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:08,759
Oh, and don't get us wrong,
we're still gonna bill you.

705
00:47:08,843 --> 00:47:11,596
Just as soon as we figure out
how to make bills.

706
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:12,680
(Laughs)

707
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,308
I did notice that you could
use some help around here.

708
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:17,768
And I owe you.

709
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:19,854
Maybe I could clean the place up a bit.

710
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:22,315
Is this place messy?

711
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:26,819
Our firm is very prestigious
and discerning, Miss Page.

712
00:47:26,902 --> 00:47:28,488
Do you have any prior experience

713
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:32,200
hiding electrical cords
(chuckling) up in ceiling tiles?

714
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:33,701
Uh, no, but...

715
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,037
I'll work for free.

716
00:47:37,175 --> 00:47:39,016
- (Matt) Yeah, you're hired.
- (Karen chuckles)

717
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,750
(Foggy)
You just got hired!

718
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:54,680
You can leave the lights off.

719
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:39,600
(Mouse clicking)

720
00:48:59,412 --> 00:49:01,456
- (Basket thuds)
- (Girl screaming)

721
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,087
(Matt grunting)

722
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:39,595
Hey! Come on!

723
00:50:51,106 --> 00:50:52,525
Ahh! Daddy!

724
00:50:52,608 --> 00:50:53,734
Daddy!

725
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:54,819
(Speaking Russian)

726
00:50:54,902 --> 00:50:56,446
No! Daddy!

727
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,462
(Indistinct conversations)

728
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,260
(Overlapping voices)

729
00:51:23,973 --> 00:51:25,266
(Boy)
Daddy!

730
00:51:26,058 --> 00:51:27,310
Help!

731
00:51:27,393 --> 00:51:28,769
Daddy!

732
00:51:30,062 --> 00:51:31,522
(Boy screaming)

733
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:35,135
