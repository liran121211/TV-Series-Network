1
00:00:09,914 --> 00:00:11,165
[grunts]

2
00:00:15,294 --> 00:00:16,629
[yells]

3
00:00:23,678 --> 00:00:25,346
- Ahhh!
- [grunts]

4
00:00:27,098 --> 00:00:29,141
[yells]

5
00:00:31,352 --> 00:00:32,479
[groans]

6
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:53,249
[yells]

7
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,218
[grunts]

8
00:01:10,517 --> 00:01:11,518
Ahh!

9
00:01:21,778 --> 00:01:22,779
Ahhh!

10
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:27,992
[yells]

11
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:40,547
[theme music playing]

12
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:53,119
Started to wonder if
you'd ever turn up again.

13
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:57,498
Yeah, I've, uh...

14
00:02:57,581 --> 00:02:59,000
- been busy.
- Hmm.

15
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:03,504
Well, I'll be inside,
you wanna take confession.

16
00:03:07,383 --> 00:03:08,509
Uh, Father?

17
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:17,644
I was wondering if I could
take you up on that latte?

18
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:45,087
Sugar?

19
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:47,131
No.

20
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:50,009
[sighs]

21
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:54,221
So...

22
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,518
what's on your mind, Matthew?

23
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:04,273
Wasn't that hard to find out.

24
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:10,196
People still remember "Battlin'
Jack" Murdock around these parts...

25
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:12,489
and what happened to his son.

26
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:19,080
Seal of confession still
applies, even over lattes.

27
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:20,915
That what you're worried about.

28
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:26,128
Do you believe in the Devil, Father?

29
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:31,759
You mean... as a concept?

30
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:32,844
No.

31
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:36,638
Do you believe he exists?

32
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,476
In this world, among us.

33
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:43,688
You want the short answer or the long one?

34
00:04:44,814 --> 00:04:46,357
Just the truth.

35
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,572
When I was in seminary...

36
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,785
I was more studious than pious, more...

37
00:04:57,869 --> 00:05:01,748
skeptical than most of my peers.

38
00:05:01,831 --> 00:05:03,833
I had this notion...

39
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:07,086
which I was more than willing
to speak about, at length,

40
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:09,671
to whoever I could corner...

41
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:12,091
that the Devil...

42
00:05:12,174 --> 00:05:13,509
was inconsequential.

43
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:16,929
Minor figure in the grand scheme.

44
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:19,974
Not very Catholic of you.

45
00:05:20,057 --> 00:05:21,475
Uh-huh, yeah.

46
00:05:21,558 --> 00:05:27,648
In my defense, in the scriptures,
the Hebrew word "Satan"

47
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:29,566
actually means "adversary."

48
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,195
It's applied to any antagonist.

49
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,991
Angels and humans, serpents and kings.

50
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,743
Medieval theologians
reinterpreted those passages

51
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:43,330
to be about a single monstrous enemy.

52
00:05:44,665 --> 00:05:48,961
And, in my youthful zeal,
I was certain I knew why...

53
00:05:49,045 --> 00:05:50,171
propaganda.

54
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:54,550
Played up to drive people into the church.

55
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,052
So you don't believe he exists.

56
00:05:56,135 --> 00:05:57,845
Am I done talking?

57
00:05:59,513 --> 00:06:01,348
Sorry.

58
00:06:01,432 --> 00:06:05,061
Years later, I was in Rwanda...

59
00:06:05,144 --> 00:06:09,982
trying to help local churches
provide aid and sanctuary to refugees.

60
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:14,528
I'd become close with the village elder,

61
00:06:14,611 --> 00:06:17,198
Gahiji.

62
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:22,286
He and his family had the respect
of everybody, Hutu and Tutsi alike.

63
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:26,833
He'd helped them all...
through famines, disease.

64
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:34,506
The militia liked to force Hutu
villagers to murder their neighbors...

65
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:37,844
with machetes.

66
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:42,514
But nobody would raise
a hand against Gahiji.

67
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,643
They said, "Well... how can
we kill such a holy man?"

68
00:06:48,437 --> 00:06:51,065
So the militia commander sent soldiers...

69
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:53,901
with orders to cut his head off...

70
00:06:55,402 --> 00:06:57,696
in front of the entire village.

71
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:01,617
Gahiji didn't try to put up a fight.

72
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:05,872
Just asked for the chance
to say goodbye to his family.

73
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:11,335
By the time he was done, even the
soldiers didn't wanna kill him.

74
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:14,421
So they went to their commander
and asked permission to shoot him.

75
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,299
At least give him a quick death.

76
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:23,514
The commander wanted to meet this man...

77
00:07:24,974 --> 00:07:27,351
who had won the respect of so many.

78
00:07:28,936 --> 00:07:30,604
He went to Gahiji...

79
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:36,027
talked with him in his
hut... for many hours.

80
00:07:39,738 --> 00:07:43,742
Then he dragged him out in front of
his village and hacked him to pieces...

81
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:48,455
along with his entire family.

82
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,796
In that man who took Gahiji's life...

83
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,590
I saw the Devil.

84
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:03,429
So yes, Matthew...

85
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:08,350
I believe he walks among us...

86
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:11,770
taking many forms.

87
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:18,069
What if you could have stopped him...

88
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,989
from ever hurting anyone again?

89
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:25,242
Stopped him how?

90
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,706
This doesn't change anything, Ben.

91
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,792
Except now we know who
your king of diamonds is.

92
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,670
You see the news? Everything's changed.

93
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,552
Fisk has gotten out in front of
being dragged into the spotlight.

94
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:47,139
My editor thinks he's the Second
Coming. Hell, the whole city does.

95
00:08:47,223 --> 00:08:48,682
[Karen] So, we just... We keep digging.

96
00:08:48,765 --> 00:08:49,845
[Ben] I've been doing that.

97
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:51,852
Internet went from nothing on Fisk

98
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:56,065
to filled with three-hanky stories about
a poor little fat kid from Hell's Kitchen.

99
00:08:56,148 --> 00:08:59,068
Abandoned by his father when he
was 12. Mother died a year later.

100
00:08:59,151 --> 00:09:02,989
Now look at him. Boot
straps and a big dream.

101
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:04,656
Somebody knows something.

102
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,783
It's just a matter of asking the
right people the right questions

103
00:09:06,867 --> 00:09:07,947
in the right tone of voice.

104
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:10,871
Yeah, that's how you get yourself hurt.

105
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:14,916
That's what I keep telling them.

106
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,668
Maybe they'll listen to you.

107
00:09:16,752 --> 00:09:20,339
Ben Urich, Matt Murdock.
Attorney at Why the Hell Bother.

108
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:25,261
- Mr. Murdock.
- Matt.

109
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:28,514
My partner thinks we should be
pursuing this through the legal system.

110
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:29,598
A lot safer that way.

111
00:09:29,681 --> 00:09:31,642
Well, why don't we all just
crawl under the covers, then?

112
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:32,893
- No, Karen...
- Well, I'm sorry,

113
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:34,853
but if Fisk is really behind
everything that has happened,

114
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:36,397
then we need to do something.

115
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,984
If we were the only ones
after him, I'd tend to agree.

116
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,361
Friend of yours came to
see me the other night...

117
00:09:42,444 --> 00:09:43,570
the man in the mask.

118
00:09:44,488 --> 00:09:46,865
[Foggy] Terrorist cop-killer.
[Ben] Says he was framed.

119
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:49,451
I could say I'm Captain America,
but it doesn't put wings on my head.

120
00:09:49,535 --> 00:09:50,536
[stammers] What did he want?

121
00:09:50,619 --> 00:09:53,247
Same thing we do... expose Fisk.

122
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:57,334
I printed this from a
thumb drive he gave me.

123
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:00,671
Oh, my God!

124
00:10:00,754 --> 00:10:04,341
[Ben] Told me Fisk was behind the
bombings and shooting those cops...

125
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:05,926
said he owns half the police...

126
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,886
that they helped him
take down the Russians.

127
00:10:07,969 --> 00:10:10,389
[Karen] But I don't understand.
If you have all of this, then...

128
00:10:10,472 --> 00:10:15,102
Hearsay. Can't print any of it
without corroboration, can you?

129
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:18,689
He could just be throwing smoke. I
mean, he just killed Detective Blake.

130
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:21,733
Said Blake's partner Hoffman did
it, probably on Fisk's orders.

131
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:23,819
But yeah, it occurred to me.

132
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:26,155
You could talk to Hoffman.

133
00:10:26,238 --> 00:10:28,032
Tried. He's in the wind.

134
00:10:28,115 --> 00:10:30,326
Or bottom of the river. Either way...

135
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:33,662
He just shrugged.

136
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:34,871
Sorry.

137
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:37,708
Wait, what about the Union Allied money?

138
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,336
Is there a way that we can
tie it directly to Fisk?

139
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:41,670
[Ben] Maybe.

140
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:45,841
According to the Mask, a man named,
uh, Leland Owlsley runs the books.

141
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:47,634
But since getting roughed up by him,

142
00:10:47,718 --> 00:10:50,137
Owlsley's been surrounded
by Fisk's security.

143
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:51,341
Can't get anywhere near him.

144
00:10:51,347 --> 00:10:53,474
Same goes with, uh, James Wesley,

145
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:56,810
the guy you said hired you to defend Healy.

146
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:59,271
Look, the Mask came to Ben for help.

147
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:03,900
And I don't care how rich Fisk is,
nobody can totally erase their past.

148
00:11:03,984 --> 00:11:05,736
I mean, somewhere out there,

149
00:11:05,819 --> 00:11:09,406
there has to be a piece
of paper, a witness...

150
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,617
[sighs] the truth.

151
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,577
[Foggy] What about Confederated Global?

152
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,412
The suit that hired us to defend Healy

153
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:17,831
standing right next to Fisk
when he gave his big speech.

154
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:21,042
I looked into that.
According to FCC filings,

155
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:24,004
Confed Global's where Fisk gets
most of his reported income.

156
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:25,714
All right, let's play this out.

157
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:27,758
If Fisk is connected to Confed Global,

158
00:11:27,841 --> 00:11:30,386
that means he's involved in
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting, which...

159
00:11:30,469 --> 00:11:34,306
Westmeyer-Holt is strong-arming tenants
out of their rent-controlled apartments.

160
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,308
Um, they were hired by
a guy named Armand Tully.

161
00:11:36,392 --> 00:11:37,393
The slumlord?

162
00:11:37,476 --> 00:11:41,188
Landman and Zack say he's on vacation
on an island that no one can pronounce,

163
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:43,023
where they use coconuts as phones.

164
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,776
Another connection in the wind.

165
00:11:45,859 --> 00:11:48,654
Westmeyer-Holt to Confed to Fisk.

166
00:11:48,737 --> 00:11:50,417
We pull that thread, see what it unravels.

167
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:52,324
Still not sure about this mask guy.

168
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,410
[Karen] He didn't hurt
Ben and he didn't hurt me.

169
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:57,204
I'll take the Devil of Hell's
Kitchen over Fisk any day.

170
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:59,415
Plus, he kicks ass.

171
00:11:59,498 --> 00:12:02,543
No, you should've seen the way that
he was flipping around in the rain.

172
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:04,503
Well, if he's such a badass,
why did he come to Ben?

173
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:06,422
Why not just take Fisk down himself?

174
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:10,926
Maybe he knows there's some
roads you can't come back from.

175
00:12:17,849 --> 00:12:21,645
[Wesley] Our latest polls show
your approval numbers rising...

176
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:24,815
across political, ethnic
and economic lines.

177
00:12:24,898 --> 00:12:28,985
[breathes deeply] The
501(c)(3) has been approved,

178
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:31,697
so the PAC is actively making donations,

179
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,534
and Senator Cherryh's
office has asked for a meet.

180
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:38,204
[Fisk] Breakfast.

181
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:41,748
Reject the first place they suggest.

182
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:48,672
How about Detective Hoffman?

183
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:53,051
Our sources in IAB tell me he was
supposed to give a follow-up statement

184
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:55,262
about what happened at Metro-General.

185
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:56,972
He never showed.

186
00:12:58,474 --> 00:12:59,975
We need to put this behind us.

187
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:01,935
If he's still in the city, we'll find him.

188
00:13:02,018 --> 00:13:03,103
If he isn't?

189
00:13:04,145 --> 00:13:05,188
[laughs]

190
00:13:05,272 --> 00:13:08,108
We'll still find him. It might
just take a little longer.

191
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:12,738
And the man in the mask?

192
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:16,742
The authorities are
motivated to shoot on sight...

193
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:17,868
if they have the opportunity.

194
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,330
He's not nearly as active
as he has been in the past.

195
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:24,207
Maybe he's given up.

196
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:28,169
Maybe he's just choosing
his targets more carefully.

197
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,380
[door opening]

198
00:13:30,381 --> 00:13:32,633
Hey, I said you need to wait outside.

199
00:13:32,716 --> 00:13:33,800
[yelling in pain]

200
00:13:34,593 --> 00:13:35,594
[speaking Japanese]

201
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,789
It's all right, Francis. Thank you.

202
00:13:39,848 --> 00:13:41,808
[Francis groaning]

203
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:44,102
[Fisk speaking English]
My apologies, Nobu-san.

204
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:48,940
- If I had known you were coming...
- [Nobu speaking Japanese]

205
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:55,489
[speaking English] He doesn't
care for the accommodations.

206
00:13:56,239 --> 00:13:59,117
Misspeak my words again...

207
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,577
and I will have your tongue.

208
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:02,621
[Fisk] Wesley is just trying to be polite.

209
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:06,375
The time for pleasantries... is at an end.

210
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,628
I was promised a city block

211
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:13,507
in return for my aid in your ventures.

212
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:19,054
There is a...

213
00:14:21,348 --> 00:14:26,061
a tenement in, um...
this particular area...

214
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:31,275
it has proven troublesome to vacate.

215
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:34,320
But we have other blocks
coming up if you...

216
00:14:34,403 --> 00:14:36,237
[speaking Japanese]

217
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:40,784
[speaking English] This one.

218
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,744
I don't recall...

219
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:46,498
guaranteeing a specific block.

220
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:51,127
You'll need to be patient...

221
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:53,254
or choose another.

222
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:58,885
I am bound by certain requirements.

223
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:02,306
Even I have those I must answer to.

224
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:06,852
After the setback at the docks...

225
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:09,813
I can afford no further disruptions.

226
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:13,108
Do what you must, but do it quickly.

227
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:15,110
Wesley?

228
00:15:15,193 --> 00:15:20,491
Regardless of how carefully it's
handled, you're now the owner of record.

229
00:15:20,574 --> 00:15:24,453
The negative publicity could prove costly.

230
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:27,998
My organization will
compensate you for the expense.

231
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:31,793
Well, the offer's
appreciated, but unnecessary.

232
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:34,505
There is, however, a problem

233
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:38,592
that you could aid me in
solving, in return for my help.

234
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:42,346
One that has inconvenienced us both.

235
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,349
The man in black.

236
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:50,437
He's proven to be more difficult
to address than expected.

237
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:56,985
Possessed of determination
and unusual talents.

238
00:16:01,197 --> 00:16:03,909
We must match him in kind.

239
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:09,122
A specialist, perhaps,
from your organization.

240
00:16:09,205 --> 00:16:11,500
I know of one with such skills.

241
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:15,379
But finding our enemy will be difficult.

242
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:18,173
He has become... cautious.

243
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:19,883
Yes, he has.

244
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,806
But emotion...

245
00:16:28,058 --> 00:16:33,522
can turn the most
circumspect of men careless.

246
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:44,157
[Foggy] No, that's not what I'm saying.
[Karen] Well, it sure sounds like it.

247
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,411
Hey, if Fisk really is the guy
that blew the hell out of my city,

248
00:16:47,494 --> 00:16:49,162
shot those cops and went after you,

249
00:16:49,245 --> 00:16:51,873
then nobody wants to see him
take it on the nuts more than me.

250
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:53,208
No, I might have you edged out on that.

251
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,794
Okay, present company excluded.

252
00:16:55,877 --> 00:16:59,172
All I'm saying is Armand
Tully is a dead end.

253
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:00,455
[Matt] You find something out?

254
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:04,135
I, um, did a little
back-channeling with Marci.

255
00:17:04,219 --> 00:17:06,262
Okay, ew, just... What did you get?

256
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:08,098
Tully really is on an island

257
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,684
that he bought with the money
that Confed Global is paying him

258
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,936
for all his real estate
holdings in Hell's Kitchen.

259
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,104
[Karen] Then, that's the link!

260
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:17,107
I mean, it ties Fisk directly to
what's happening in the tenement case.

261
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,442
No, it doesn't.

262
00:17:18,525 --> 00:17:20,652
According to the records, the deal
just went through this morning.

263
00:17:20,736 --> 00:17:21,820
So...

264
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:24,490
[Matt] So everything that
happened with the case up till now

265
00:17:24,573 --> 00:17:27,200
was before Fisk was the owner
on record. All falls on Tully.

266
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:31,204
Okay, so we go after Tully.
We get him to turn on Fisk.

267
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:33,373
Yeah, that island he's on?

268
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:35,416
- No extradition agreement.
- [Karen groans]

269
00:17:36,084 --> 00:17:37,711
It's another dead end.

270
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:39,755
[knock on door]

271
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:46,887
[conversing in Spanish]

272
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,555
[Elena laughs]

273
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:52,893
[in English] You just asked
her where the library is.

274
00:17:52,976 --> 00:17:54,394
[conversing in Spanish]

275
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,861
[in English] They doubled the offer
to get the tenants to move out.

276
00:18:02,944 --> 00:18:04,613
[Elena speaking Spanish]

277
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:07,448
[Karen in English] Oh,
damn it. [Foggy] What?

278
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:09,493
Her neighbors are thinking about taking it.

279
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:10,744
Maybe they should.

280
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,829
[Foggy] No! Tell her to stand firm.

281
00:18:12,913 --> 00:18:15,433
We told her we're gonna help her
and that's what we're gonna do.

282
00:18:16,124 --> 00:18:17,626
[speaking Spanish]

283
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:25,383
[speaking English] Such a good boy.

284
00:18:26,593 --> 00:18:27,928
[speaking Spanish]

285
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:37,646
[in English] She thinks
she can change their minds.

286
00:18:37,729 --> 00:18:39,523
Enough of them maybe to make a difference.

287
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:42,943
I no take! This my home.

288
00:18:43,026 --> 00:18:44,444
We fight, yes?

289
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:46,738
Yes, sí.

290
00:18:46,822 --> 00:18:47,948
[laughs]

291
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:49,324
He is good man.

292
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,492
All of you...

293
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:52,578
good.

294
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:01,377
You shouldn't have done that.

295
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:03,501
What? Fight for the rights
of the little guy, right?

296
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:06,633
Fisk wants the tenements, he's
not gonna stop until he gets them.

297
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:08,597
Well, so what? We're just
supposed to roll over?

298
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:10,220
Fisk is public on this.

299
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:11,638
If we tie him up with an injunction,

300
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:13,389
maybe we find something in
the deposition that we...

301
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:16,768
Oh, come on, Foggy, you think we're
gonna trip this guy up with a deposition?

302
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:19,270
After everything that's happened,
you don't get who we're dealing with?

303
00:19:19,354 --> 00:19:20,355
No, we get it!

304
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:24,275
Matt, he's a rich dickhead who thinks
he can pay people off to kiss his ass.

305
00:19:25,526 --> 00:19:30,323
Look, he is standing on City Hall
with his cronies like he's already won.

306
00:19:30,406 --> 00:19:31,950
You know he can't see that.

307
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,702
All right, we can't let
him get away with this.

308
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:35,746
- I know.
- [Foggy] So, what are we gonna do?

309
00:19:37,163 --> 00:19:41,835
[sighs] Basic tenet of both
law and war, know your enemy.

310
00:19:41,918 --> 00:19:44,504
Thank you, Sun Tzu. What
does that actually mean?

311
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:47,633
It means we keep digging.

312
00:19:47,716 --> 00:19:49,593
Like Karen said, somewhere out there,

313
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:53,429
there's a piece of paper or a witness,
or something that'll lead to the truth.

314
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:55,223
Okay, good.

315
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:59,227
But, do it quietly. Stay under the radar.

316
00:20:00,812 --> 00:20:02,272
Where are you going?

317
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,775
Three people stood with Fisk
when he addressed the city.

318
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:07,527
His man from Confed
Global, Owlsley and a woman.

319
00:20:07,611 --> 00:20:09,570
One the press said he seemed close with.

320
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:12,490
Oh, yeah, uh, Vanessa, um...

321
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:15,285
Marianna. It says she works
at Scene Contempo Gallery.

322
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:18,038
Maybe it's time I invested in some art.

323
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:25,253
[assistant] Here's the
list that I came up with.

324
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:26,337
Anyone else?

325
00:20:26,421 --> 00:20:28,089
[Vanessa] Make sure
Richmond's on the guest list.

326
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:31,802
He won't come, but he'll get
pissy if he isn't invited.

327
00:20:32,636 --> 00:20:35,476
[guard on radio] You have a visitor
coming in through the west entrance.

328
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:52,363
[Vanessa] May I help you?

329
00:20:53,281 --> 00:20:55,575
I hope so. Um, Matthew.

330
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:56,827
Vanessa.

331
00:20:56,910 --> 00:20:58,745
Vanessa.

332
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:02,040
You're probably wondering what a man
who can't see is doing in an art gallery.

333
00:21:02,123 --> 00:21:03,166
[laughs]

334
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:04,835
I didn't want to be forward.

335
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,044
[chuckles]

336
00:21:06,127 --> 00:21:09,339
I'm told by my guests my
apartment's a bit stark.

337
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:11,174
I thought maybe some art would warm it up.

338
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:16,429
I'm going to go out on a limb and
assume these "guests" were women?

339
00:21:16,512 --> 00:21:17,638
[laughs]

340
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:21,517
Well, I'm not trying to
impress the pizza guy.

341
00:21:21,601 --> 00:21:24,520
Good. You don't need
sight to appreciate art,

342
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:26,356
but you do need honesty.

343
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:28,483
- Sight helps.
- Sure.

344
00:21:28,566 --> 00:21:32,403
But there's something very intimate

345
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:35,573
in experiencing art
through someone else's eyes.

346
00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:38,702
That's a good line, by
the way. You should use it.

347
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:40,161
[laughs] I might.

348
00:21:40,245 --> 00:21:43,707
So, give me an idea what you're after.

349
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,291
I am not sure.

350
00:21:46,626 --> 00:21:48,920
Good... art isn't furniture.

351
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:52,799
If you knew exactly what you were
looking for, you'd be just decorating.

352
00:21:52,883 --> 00:21:56,386
Art should speak to you... move you.

353
00:21:56,469 --> 00:21:58,304
This one, for example.

354
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,183
One of my favorite pieces.

355
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:07,814
Describe it to me.

356
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:13,236
Imagine a sea of tonal reds.

357
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,198
The color of anger...

358
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:19,450
of rage...

359
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:22,078
but also the color of the heart...

360
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:25,581
of love... hope.

361
00:22:25,665 --> 00:22:28,835
This strikes the perfect
balance between the two.

362
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:33,089
I don't know, it sounds aggressive.

363
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:36,467
All depends on your point of view.

364
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:39,470
Maybe something a little less challenging.

365
00:22:40,513 --> 00:22:42,140
Tell me, do you have a man in your life?

366
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:46,352
Matthew, are you hitting on me?

367
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:48,646
[chuckling] No, I just
mean, what does he like?

368
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:49,981
What does he respond to?

369
00:22:50,065 --> 00:22:52,192
If I can get inside the head of the man

370
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:54,277
who won the heart of such a charming woman,

371
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,362
it would inform my decision.

372
00:22:56,446 --> 00:23:00,408
Well, you could always ask him yourself.

373
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:21,096
[distorted] Hope I'm not
interrupting. I was nearby.

374
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:23,259
[Vanessa] Not at all. We
were just talking about you.

375
00:23:24,224 --> 00:23:25,391
I see.

376
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:29,437
Wilson Fisk, Matthew...

377
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,106
Murdock.

378
00:23:32,607 --> 00:23:33,774
Oh, yes, the attorney.

379
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,069
I've heard about all your
work in Hell's Kitchen.

380
00:23:36,945 --> 00:23:38,363
Ah.

381
00:23:38,446 --> 00:23:40,281
I'm aware of yours as well.

382
00:23:41,574 --> 00:23:43,952
Mr. Murdock is thinking
of purchasing some art.

383
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:48,123
He was looking for some
advice from a man of taste.

384
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:51,751
Well, that's simple. Buy
whatever the lady tells you.

385
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,670
- [Vanessa laughs]
- Thank you.

386
00:23:54,754 --> 00:23:56,339
Although we probably shouldn't be talking.

387
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:58,466
I believe we're on opposite
sides of a tenancy case.

388
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:00,385
- Oh, you are?
- Yes.

389
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:01,636
[Vanessa] Hmm.

390
00:24:01,719 --> 00:24:04,514
The rental properties I
recently acquired from Mr. Tully.

391
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:08,226
But I'm sure that will be
settled to everyone's benefit.

392
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:11,646
The city has suffered long enough
under the burden of poverty and decay.

393
00:24:12,605 --> 00:24:15,400
I believe we have opportunities now with...

394
00:24:15,483 --> 00:24:19,612
Wilson, Mr. Murdock is
a customer, not a donor.

395
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:23,574
Yes, I apologize for the hard sell.

396
00:24:25,035 --> 00:24:27,703
This city and its future...

397
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:31,791
Seeing Hell's Kitchen to its fullest
potential is very important to me.

398
00:24:33,376 --> 00:24:35,128
I feel the same way.

399
00:24:36,754 --> 00:24:39,007
Vanessa, thank you so much for your time.

400
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,719
Have you changed your mind
about what you came for?

401
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:46,764
No, no, I would just
need to consider the cost.

402
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,017
Mr. Fisk.

403
00:25:24,052 --> 00:25:27,347
I like to have a
moment... end of the day...

404
00:25:28,723 --> 00:25:30,391
just me and him.

405
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:35,981
Maybe you could put in a word.

406
00:25:36,856 --> 00:25:40,568
How did you know I was sitting
here, you mind me asking?

407
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:43,363
You want the short answer or the long one?

408
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:44,614
[chuckles]

409
00:25:48,493 --> 00:25:51,246
I was worried you might've gone
out and done something foolish,

410
00:25:51,329 --> 00:25:52,955
after our talk this morning.

411
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,250
[sighs] I haven't done anything.

412
00:25:57,002 --> 00:25:58,503
Not yet.

413
00:25:58,586 --> 00:26:01,464
Sounds a bit on the ominous side.

414
00:26:03,383 --> 00:26:06,136
I went to visit someone close to the...

415
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:08,971
close to the Devil.

416
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:13,393
[sighs] Not to hurt her,
just to get a sense of him.

417
00:26:14,894 --> 00:26:17,563
Of who he is and what it would take to...

418
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:20,900
do what I have to.

419
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:22,568
And...

420
00:26:24,362 --> 00:26:25,988
what did you learn?

421
00:26:29,659 --> 00:26:31,661
That he has someone he loves...

422
00:26:32,912 --> 00:26:35,331
who loves him, who'd mourn his loss.

423
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:36,916
[Lantom] Mmm-hmm.

424
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:40,420
Few things are absolute, Matthew.

425
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:43,839
Even Lucifer was once an angel.

426
00:26:43,923 --> 00:26:47,718
It's why judgment and vengeance...

427
00:26:48,928 --> 00:26:50,471
are best left to God.

428
00:26:51,514 --> 00:26:53,849
Especially when murder
is not in your heart.

429
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,810
[scoffs] How do you know?

430
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:58,271
You're here, aren't you?

431
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:03,025
[female automated voice]
Foggy, Foggy, Foggy...

432
00:27:03,109 --> 00:27:04,194
Sorry.

433
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:05,861
- Foggy, Foggy...
- [phone beeps]

434
00:27:09,699 --> 00:27:10,991
[sighs]

435
00:27:14,912 --> 00:27:17,582
I know my soul is damned
if I take his life.

436
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:21,877
But if I stand idle, if I...

437
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:26,382
If I let him consume this city, all
the people that will suffer and die...

438
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:30,386
There is a wide gulf between
inaction and murder, Matthew.

439
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,889
Another man's evil does not make you good.

440
00:27:33,973 --> 00:27:37,059
Men have used the atrocities of
their enemies to justify their own

441
00:27:37,143 --> 00:27:38,936
throughout history.

442
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:42,857
So the question you have
to ask yourself is...

443
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:48,154
are you struggling with the fact
that you don't wanna kill this man...

444
00:27:48,238 --> 00:27:50,240
but have to?

445
00:27:50,323 --> 00:27:53,075
Or that you don't have to kill him...

446
00:27:54,452 --> 00:27:56,078
but want to?

447
00:27:58,373 --> 00:28:01,584
"Like a muddied spring
or a polluted fountain

448
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:05,213
is the righteous man who
gives way before the wicked."

449
00:28:05,296 --> 00:28:08,508
Proverbs 25-something,
I never can remember.

450
00:28:08,591 --> 00:28:10,926
Meaning righteous men have
a duty to stand up to evil.

451
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:13,429
One interpretation.

452
00:28:13,513 --> 00:28:18,643
Another is that when the righteous
succumb to sin, it is as harmful

453
00:28:18,726 --> 00:28:21,687
as if the public well were poisoned.

454
00:28:22,438 --> 00:28:27,610
Because the darkness of such
an act... of taking a life...

455
00:28:27,693 --> 00:28:32,907
will spread to friends, neighbors...

456
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,494
the entire community.

457
00:28:40,581 --> 00:28:41,916
What if it already has?

458
00:28:41,999 --> 00:28:44,127
Then we wouldn't be sitting here, would we?

459
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:54,262
I don't believe you went to see this
woman for insight into how to kill a man.

460
00:28:56,096 --> 00:28:57,432
I think...

461
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:02,353
maybe you went looking for a reason not to.

462
00:29:14,407 --> 00:29:15,408
Hey!

463
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:17,410
Hey.

464
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:20,913
Uh, Foggy, um, tried to get
a hold of you last night.

465
00:29:20,996 --> 00:29:23,040
Oh, yeah, turned off my phone.

466
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:26,711
You okay?

467
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:30,465
Yeah, just... tired.

468
00:29:30,548 --> 00:29:34,552
How did it go with that,
um... Vanessa woman?

469
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:36,346
Oh, I didn't get what I needed.

470
00:29:37,096 --> 00:29:38,764
Oh.

471
00:29:38,848 --> 00:29:40,683
Well, uh, Foggy and I had better luck.

472
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:45,020
Um, we identified the assholes
that jumped us outside of Elena's.

473
00:29:45,104 --> 00:29:47,273
It's a Stewart Schmidt and Joseph Pike.

474
00:29:47,357 --> 00:29:49,942
- You ID'd them from booking photos?
- No, actually...

475
00:29:50,025 --> 00:29:51,902
Contractor's licenses.

476
00:29:51,986 --> 00:29:54,489
- And where the hell were you?
- Uh... [exhales]

477
00:29:54,572 --> 00:29:56,073
Walking, clearing my head.

478
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:58,368
Hate when you don't answer my calls, buddy.

479
00:29:58,451 --> 00:30:00,536
I always think you fell down
an open manhole or something.

480
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,705
[chuckles] I'm fine. Who's
the employer of record?

481
00:30:02,788 --> 00:30:04,332
Westmeyer-Holt Contracting,

482
00:30:04,415 --> 00:30:07,126
another wonderful Global Confed subsidiary.

483
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,419
Well, that's it. That's great.

484
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:11,922
We press assault charges,
get them to flip on Fisk.

485
00:30:12,006 --> 00:30:13,132
Yeah, not so much.

486
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:16,176
I reached out to Ben and his
sources say that they're off the map.

487
00:30:16,261 --> 00:30:18,471
Just like Hoffman and Tully.

488
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:19,764
Of course they are.

489
00:30:19,847 --> 00:30:22,642
[laughs] Great, so we have nothing.

490
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:26,271
I wouldn't go that far. Here,
Foggy, show him the thing.

491
00:30:26,354 --> 00:30:28,523
[Foggy] Right, the thing!

492
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:29,690
[Matt] What thing?

493
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:31,526
- [Karen laughs]
- The dream, buddy.

494
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:37,031
It's just like the one I drew on the napkin

495
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:39,992
that you, uh, couldn't see back when.

496
00:30:40,075 --> 00:30:41,411
[Matt] Oh.

497
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:42,787
[laughs]

498
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,580
- It's a little small, isn't it?
- [Foggy laughs]

499
00:30:44,664 --> 00:30:45,831
Building regulations.

500
00:30:45,915 --> 00:30:49,043
Anyway, so are we. We
are small but awesome.

501
00:30:49,126 --> 00:30:50,795
And we're gonna make a difference.

502
00:30:50,878 --> 00:30:52,797
I know it doesn't feel like it sometimes...

503
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,091
a lot of the time, but we
are, with the power of the law.

504
00:30:56,175 --> 00:30:57,968
Okay.

505
00:30:58,052 --> 00:31:00,721
Dragged me into this
rinky-dink firm, Murdock...

506
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:03,557
and I'll never be able to
thank you enough for it.

507
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:06,936
You're not gonna kiss me.

508
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:08,521
- I'm feeling a little somethin'.
- [Karen] Oh...

509
00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:10,444
- [Matt] Okay, come here.
- [telephone ringing]

510
00:31:12,358 --> 00:31:14,026
Nelson and Murdock, how may I help you?

511
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,695
[Matt] Time for those handyman skills.

512
00:31:15,778 --> 00:31:16,862
[Karen] Uh, hey!

513
00:31:18,238 --> 00:31:20,199
[clears throat] Sorry, what?

514
00:31:23,578 --> 00:31:24,579
Um...

515
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:27,998
Uh, when?

516
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,380
[gasping]

517
00:31:38,217 --> 00:31:39,885
It's her.

518
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,475
How did it happen?

519
00:31:46,892 --> 00:31:49,687
[Brett] Neighbor saw some junkie
they've seen in the building,

520
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:52,231
fleeing the scene with her purse.

521
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:54,817
Probably jumped her while
she was fishing for her keys.

522
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,068
[Karen sobs]

523
00:31:58,028 --> 00:31:59,739
Karen, maybe you should wait outside.

524
00:31:59,822 --> 00:32:01,824
[sniffling] No. No, I'm...

525
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,038
How did she die?

526
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,502
Multiple stab wounds.

527
00:32:13,753 --> 00:32:16,296
The ambulance got there quick, but...

528
00:32:18,758 --> 00:32:22,928
My mom says all the family
she knew about's passed on.

529
00:32:23,012 --> 00:32:25,264
I knew you were looking
into her tenancy case.

530
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:29,394
I thought you might be able to
point us toward the next of kin.

531
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:30,895
No, she didn't have anyone.

532
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:33,773
Just us.

533
00:32:35,232 --> 00:32:36,859
We'll see to the arrangements.

534
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:40,613
It's good of you to take that on.

535
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:43,741
I'll let the ME know.

536
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:08,891
[grunting]

537
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:11,185
Ahhh!

538
00:33:25,908 --> 00:33:27,493
[breathing heavily]

539
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:33,999
You are a worthy opponent.

540
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:38,337
It is an honor to claim your life.

541
00:33:38,421 --> 00:33:40,506
[breathing heavily]

542
00:33:51,391 --> 00:33:52,893
[groaning]

543
00:33:57,565 --> 00:33:58,983
- [grunting]
- Ahhh!

544
00:34:06,406 --> 00:34:07,950
[yelling]

545
00:34:22,256 --> 00:34:23,257
[Foggy] Thanks.

546
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,092
I'll keep 'em comin', love.

547
00:34:32,642 --> 00:34:36,729
When we first took the case, Karen
and I went to Landman and Zack.

548
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:40,107
Marci talked about a "criminal
element" in Elena's building.

549
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:43,944
Said that's why the workmen left
without finishing the repairs.

550
00:34:44,987 --> 00:34:46,864
"'Cause they feared for their safety."

551
00:34:48,282 --> 00:34:50,450
I thought it was bullshit.

552
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:53,203
Maybe it was.

553
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:55,122
Tell that to Elena.

554
00:34:56,373 --> 00:34:57,792
Wait, what are you saying?

555
00:34:59,544 --> 00:35:00,753
Well, I don't know.

556
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:03,964
Just doesn't feel right, does it?

557
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:05,758
I'll drink to that.

558
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:07,552
You think it was a coincidence?

559
00:35:11,055 --> 00:35:12,431
Elena decides to stay and fight,

560
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:16,226
to rally what's left of her
neighbors, and this happens.

561
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:20,105
Do you think Fisk had
something to do with this?

562
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:22,567
Speak of the devil.

563
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,905
Fisk is on the TV again.

564
00:35:27,988 --> 00:35:29,990
Hey, Josie, could you turn that up?

565
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:34,704
No, I never had the pleasure
of meeting Ms. Cardenas.

566
00:35:35,495 --> 00:35:37,748
I only recently took
possession of her building.

567
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:42,837
How do you respond to reports that
you knew the tenement was unsafe?

568
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,129
That is accurate.

569
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:47,883
That's why we offered a substantial
sum to Ms. Cardenas and her neighbors

570
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:49,468
to help them relocate.

571
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,951
We should never let good people
get swallowed up by this city.

572
00:35:55,808 --> 00:35:57,893
I mourn this woman's death.

573
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:00,706
Didn't have to happen. It should've...

574
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:06,902
Her passing is a symptom
of a larger disease...

575
00:36:06,986 --> 00:36:08,746
- infecting all of us.
- [cell phone ringing]

576
00:36:09,404 --> 00:36:10,530
Disease of fear...

577
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:11,782
Funeral home.

578
00:36:11,866 --> 00:36:14,368
[Fisk] ...fear of bombings,
fear of cop killings.

579
00:36:14,451 --> 00:36:15,870
Hello?

580
00:36:15,953 --> 00:36:17,830
- Fear of a masked psychopath.
- [Foggy] Yeah, that's me.

581
00:36:17,913 --> 00:36:19,081
Yeah, I need to make arrangements.

582
00:36:19,164 --> 00:36:22,376
[Fisk] We shouldn't let people
like that take our city from us.

583
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:25,087
We need to stand together.

584
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,131
Let them know that they will fail...

585
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:30,300
because we believe we
can make a difference.

586
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,597
'Cause they are cowards!

587
00:36:35,514 --> 00:36:38,392
Afraid of stepping out of the shadows.

588
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:42,021
Afraid of standing up for
people like Mrs. Cardenas.

589
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,816
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

590
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,317
Mr. Fisk, how does this
affect the upcoming benefit?

591
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,402
[Wesley] That will be all. Thank you.

592
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:49,737
- Mr. Fisk...
- [Wesley] No more questions.

593
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,531
- Thank you very much.
- [man] What can we do about this psycho...

594
00:36:54,992 --> 00:36:56,952
Jesus, he almost sounds like he means it.

595
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:59,163
- I think he does.
- [Karen scoffs]

596
00:36:59,246 --> 00:37:01,707
And he's calling the
man in the mask a psycho?

597
00:37:01,791 --> 00:37:04,418
I hope they trace what happened
to Elena right to his doorstep.

598
00:37:04,501 --> 00:37:06,336
He'd never expose himself like that.

599
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:09,840
Plus, half the force is
probably in his pocket.

600
00:37:11,926 --> 00:37:15,137
Well, then, let's pray the
Mask gets his hands on him.

601
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:18,473
Knocks his goddamn head off.

602
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:25,314
You religious, Karen?

603
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:27,942
My parents were.

604
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:31,528
That's probably why I'm not.

605
00:37:33,363 --> 00:37:34,448
You?

606
00:37:35,991 --> 00:37:37,827
Catholic.

607
00:37:41,872 --> 00:37:43,332
Does it help?

608
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,669
With things like this?

609
00:37:48,253 --> 00:37:49,714
Not today.

610
00:37:53,843 --> 00:37:55,510
I think I've had enough.

611
00:37:58,472 --> 00:38:01,350
- Tell Foggy I'll see him in the morning.
- Yeah.

612
00:38:05,688 --> 00:38:06,939
Hey, Matt.

613
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:08,148
Yeah?

614
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:13,278
If there is a God...

615
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:16,699
and if he cares at all about...

616
00:38:16,782 --> 00:38:18,909
about any of us...

617
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:23,497
Fisk will get what he deserves.

618
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:26,541
You have to believe that.

619
00:38:28,002 --> 00:38:29,169
I do.

620
00:39:49,041 --> 00:39:50,500
[sighs]

621
00:40:01,428 --> 00:40:03,013
[both grunting]

622
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:24,618
- [screaming]
- Look at it.

623
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:29,498
- Where is he?
- I don't know. [screams]

624
00:40:29,581 --> 00:40:30,958
Tell me what you do know.

625
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:33,668
[gasping] All right, all right,
I'll tell you anything you want.

626
00:40:33,752 --> 00:40:35,754
Just, please, stop hurting me!

627
00:40:37,297 --> 00:40:38,757
[sighing]

628
00:40:55,607 --> 00:40:57,192
[laughing]

629
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:05,200
[sniffs]

630
00:41:42,154 --> 00:41:43,989
[laughing]

631
00:41:44,073 --> 00:41:45,115
[gasping]

632
00:41:50,704 --> 00:41:52,747
Hey, you're real, you're... You're real...

633
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:56,460
- Where'd you get the purse?
- What purse?

634
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:03,008
[groans]

635
00:42:03,092 --> 00:42:05,052
Lying? Bad idea.

636
00:42:05,135 --> 00:42:06,845
[screaming]

637
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:08,597
Please, stop! I'm... I'm sick.

638
00:42:10,474 --> 00:42:13,018
Okay! Okay, the purse! I'll
tell you who snatched it...

639
00:42:17,231 --> 00:42:20,567
Listen, I've hurt a lot of people
tonight to get what I need to know.

640
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:23,737
The asshole that killed Mrs.
Cardenas shoots up at this address,

641
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,904
likes cheap menthols.

642
00:42:24,989 --> 00:42:28,533
Thinks it covers the stench of
his rotting teeth. It doesn't.

643
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:30,160
- [grunts]
- [whimpers]

644
00:42:31,161 --> 00:42:32,496
Who paid you?

645
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,873
- [sobbing] No, I don't, I don't...
- Was it Fisk?

646
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,251
Was it Fisk?

647
00:42:37,334 --> 00:42:38,961
[incoherent]

648
00:42:39,044 --> 00:42:40,504
Was it Wilson Fisk?

649
00:42:40,587 --> 00:42:43,340
No, I don't know! Please, stop! Please!

650
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:44,424
Give me a reason to!

651
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:47,927
I don't know their names.
I don't! They found me.

652
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:50,139
They took me to a warehouse on the water...

653
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:51,765
Pier 81.

654
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:53,433
I didn't wanna do it, man.

655
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:55,852
I swear. I didn't wanna do it!

656
00:42:55,935 --> 00:42:59,023
But I was hurting. I was hurting, man.

657
00:42:59,982 --> 00:43:01,691
[breathing heavily] Shut up!

658
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:06,809
You're gonna turn yourself in...

659
00:43:08,032 --> 00:43:11,410
to Sergeant Brett Mahoney
at the 15th Precinct.

660
00:43:11,493 --> 00:43:15,747
If you don't, I'll find you. And
next time, I'm not gonna stop.

661
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,404
[heart beating slowly]

662
00:44:00,834 --> 00:44:02,669
[heart beating quickly]

663
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:14,889
I didn't come here for you.

664
00:44:17,392 --> 00:44:20,019
[Nobu] But I am the one you have found.

665
00:44:34,033 --> 00:44:37,204
You were at the docks with the boy.

666
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:39,831
[Nobu] As were you...

667
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:41,583
with the old fool.

668
00:44:43,168 --> 00:44:45,379
That was unexpected.

669
00:44:46,045 --> 00:44:47,631
I'm not part of his war.

670
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:50,467
[Nobu] Yet you aided him.

671
00:44:51,551 --> 00:44:55,180
And in the act, caused me displeasure.

672
00:44:57,932 --> 00:44:59,684
Did Fisk send you?

673
00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:03,147
Is that why he paid that junkie to...

674
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,314
[scoffs]

675
00:45:06,233 --> 00:45:11,238
A woman is dead, and for what? Just
to lure me into some kind of a trap?

676
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:15,409
You are here, are you not?

677
00:45:15,492 --> 00:45:17,786
[Masked Man] I knew no
one was in the building.

678
00:45:18,953 --> 00:45:21,998
Made that mistake with the
Russians once. Learned from it.

679
00:45:22,081 --> 00:45:25,084
[Nobu] But you did not know I was here.

680
00:45:26,378 --> 00:45:27,837
[Masked Man] No...

681
00:45:28,963 --> 00:45:30,799
you slowed your heart...

682
00:45:32,801 --> 00:45:35,094
lowered your body temperature.

683
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:37,514
[Nobu] The old fool has
taught you in our ways.

684
00:45:37,597 --> 00:45:39,237
[Masked Man] I told you I'm not with him.

685
00:45:39,266 --> 00:45:41,351
[Nobu] Yet you're still a warrior...

686
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,314
deserving of a warrior's death.

687
00:45:45,397 --> 00:45:47,732
I came here for Fisk.

688
00:45:49,108 --> 00:45:50,819
Guess I'll have to settle for you.

689
00:45:55,282 --> 00:45:57,201
[Nobu] I show you respect.

690
00:45:58,618 --> 00:46:01,580
You would be wise to return the courtesy.

691
00:46:03,207 --> 00:46:04,833
You'll have to earn it.

692
00:46:07,586 --> 00:46:08,628
[grunting]

693
00:46:38,325 --> 00:46:40,494
- Shit, sorry.
- [Karen clears throat]

694
00:46:42,871 --> 00:46:44,414
[slurring] Hey, can I get
another bottle over here?

695
00:46:44,498 --> 00:46:47,584
No, no, never mind, Josie. Hey, hey, Foggy.

696
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:50,879
Foggy, I've had enough, and
you have had... [exhales]

697
00:46:50,962 --> 00:46:52,464
Way, way past that.

698
00:46:52,547 --> 00:46:53,965
It's a wake, Karen.

699
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,885
People drink at wakes.

700
00:46:56,968 --> 00:46:58,052
You don't need it.

701
00:46:58,136 --> 00:46:59,471
You know why?

702
00:47:00,597 --> 00:47:01,723
'Cause it sucks.

703
00:47:01,806 --> 00:47:03,267
[softly] I know.

704
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:05,727
You speak Spanish.

705
00:47:07,228 --> 00:47:09,898
What's a good toast for
the people that should...

706
00:47:09,981 --> 00:47:11,691
- That should still...
- Hey.

707
00:47:12,776 --> 00:47:13,985
Hey, hey, hey.

708
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:16,321
[sobbing] I should have told her
to take the money like Matt said.

709
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:18,282
No, no, no, no, Foggy...

710
00:47:18,365 --> 00:47:21,868
it's not your fault, okay?

711
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:25,830
[sniffles]

712
00:47:28,833 --> 00:47:31,461
The Hell's Kitchen I grew
up in was a real shithole.

713
00:47:31,545 --> 00:47:33,087
But it had a heart, you know?

714
00:47:33,171 --> 00:47:35,131
Yeah.

715
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:38,427
Me and Matt... we learned the law...

716
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:40,304
how to play by the rules.

717
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,308
We were gonna help the
people that we grew up with.

718
00:47:44,391 --> 00:47:47,101
Give 'em the same shot
as the big boys like Fisk.

719
00:47:49,396 --> 00:47:50,480
It's all bullshit.

720
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:52,774
It's all just...

721
00:47:52,857 --> 00:47:55,652
lies that we tell ourselves to
make it through one more day.

722
00:47:55,735 --> 00:47:58,613
No, I don't... I don't believe that.

723
00:47:58,697 --> 00:48:00,365
I can't.

724
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:04,953
What are we supposed to do...

725
00:48:05,036 --> 00:48:09,833
against somebody that owns everything?

726
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:11,209
Everyone?

727
00:48:14,754 --> 00:48:16,673
What can we do to somebody like that?

728
00:48:17,674 --> 00:48:19,676
The only thing you can...

729
00:48:22,303 --> 00:48:24,305
you make them pay.

730
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:27,559
[Masked Man screaming]

731
00:48:33,982 --> 00:48:35,525
[grunting]

732
00:48:46,370 --> 00:48:48,663
[grunts]

733
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,460
[Nobu] You have fought well.

734
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:54,961
[Masked Man groaning]

735
00:48:55,044 --> 00:48:58,131
[Nobu] It is... not enough.

736
00:49:12,270 --> 00:49:14,022
[Nobu yelling]

737
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,575
[groaning]

738
00:49:26,993 --> 00:49:28,327
[Fisk] Thank you.

739
00:49:29,954 --> 00:49:32,040
Nobu was becoming an issue.

740
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:37,754
I appreciate you...
removing him from concern.

741
00:49:37,837 --> 00:49:39,213
[Masked Man laughs]

742
00:49:39,297 --> 00:49:42,133
[groaning] You... wanted me to do this.

743
00:49:42,216 --> 00:49:46,430
In a perfect world, you would
have taken each other out, but...

744
00:49:47,431 --> 00:49:50,600
it isn't a perfect world, is it?

745
00:49:50,684 --> 00:49:51,935
Not yet.

746
00:49:53,352 --> 00:49:57,065
To be honest... it took
longer than I expected.

747
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:00,985
Nobu didn't mind. He meditated for hours.

748
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:03,447
I find it difficult to meditate.

749
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,157
My mind, it won't quiet.

750
00:50:07,325 --> 00:50:09,911
[muttering] It's a
character flaw, I suppose.

751
00:50:11,788 --> 00:50:13,414
We all have them.

752
00:50:15,124 --> 00:50:16,375
You, for instance.

753
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:21,798
You've demonstrated an emotional
weakness for children and women.

754
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:24,676
I assumed that would extend to the elderly.

755
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,804
So I baited the hook.

756
00:50:29,514 --> 00:50:31,099
Here you are.

757
00:50:31,182 --> 00:50:33,727
[panting] You took her life...

758
00:50:35,228 --> 00:50:37,981
just to get my attention?

759
00:50:38,064 --> 00:50:40,525
[Fisk] Nobu forced my hand in the matter.

760
00:50:41,943 --> 00:50:45,572
My options, they were limited by necessity.

761
00:50:46,781 --> 00:50:48,950
I took no pleasure in her passing.

762
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:53,204
[breathing heavily] I'm... gonna kill you.

763
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,212
Take your shot.

764
00:51:04,591 --> 00:51:06,718
[both grunting]

765
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:34,412
[grunting]

766
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:42,170
[yelling]

767
00:51:53,056 --> 00:51:55,308
[Masked Man groaning]

768
00:52:07,696 --> 00:52:09,698
It's disappointing.

769
00:52:14,493 --> 00:52:16,245
Wesley.

770
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,716
- [metal clinking]
- [gun firing]

771
00:52:28,507 --> 00:52:29,926
[gunfire continues]

772
00:52:52,531 --> 00:52:54,701
Put men on the dock.

773
00:52:54,784 --> 00:52:57,621
If they see the Mask, put a bullet in him.

774
00:53:01,875 --> 00:53:03,459
What about Nobu?

775
00:53:06,671 --> 00:53:08,506
Let him burn.

776
00:53:15,596 --> 00:53:17,306
Matt!

777
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,683
Come on, Matt.

778
00:53:18,767 --> 00:53:21,102
I need to talk to you, Matt.

779
00:53:23,187 --> 00:53:24,480
[sighing]

780
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,734
[hoarsely] We need to keep going, Matt.

781
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:32,071
We gotta nail that bastard to the wall.

782
00:53:32,155 --> 00:53:35,074
We gotta make him pay... for Elena...

783
00:53:36,743 --> 00:53:38,369
- for everything.
- [clattering]

784
00:53:40,872 --> 00:53:41,873
Matt?

785
00:53:41,956 --> 00:53:45,376
Are you okay in there? Matt?

786
00:53:47,712 --> 00:53:48,838
Matt!

787
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:55,845
Matt?

788
00:54:01,142 --> 00:54:02,936
[Foggy] It's me.

789
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:04,520
I heard a crash.

790
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:09,442
Not the fun, sexy-time kind, but...

791
00:54:11,235 --> 00:54:12,779
more of the...

792
00:54:12,862 --> 00:54:15,114
I've-fallen-and-I-can't-get-up
variety.

793
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:19,828
Matt?

794
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,722
[nervously] If anyone who's
in here is not supposed to be,

795
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:41,182
I will mess you up. I'm not kidding.

796
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,022
[groaning weakly]

797
00:54:51,234 --> 00:54:53,945
Where's Matt? What'd you do to him?

798
00:55:07,959 --> 00:55:09,085
Shit.

799
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:17,676
[line ringing]

800
00:55:22,181 --> 00:55:23,474
[cell phone beeps]

801
00:55:46,998 --> 00:55:48,207
[gasps]

802
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:51,502
Matt?

803
00:55:55,464 --> 00:55:57,091
[dramatic music playing]
