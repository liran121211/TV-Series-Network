[Foggy] <i>Good. Stay there.</i>

00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,433
Matt?

4
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:27,270
No. I haven't seen him since last night.

5
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,439
I'll let him know what's going on.
Meet you at the precinct.

6
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:33,401
And don't let anyone
talk to Grotto until then.

7
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:35,069
It was a normal evening
at Metro-General

8
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:38,364
when a lone gunman entered
and began firing into the crowd.

9
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:40,867
Most of the patients are being moved
to other area hospitals.

10
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,119
- Investigators say...

[cop on radio] <i>The building's clear.</i>
<i>Perp is not in the building.</i>

00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:53,797
<i>Standby to lift lockdown.
All units hold position.</i>

13
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,216
<i>We have a report of shots fired earlier
on a rooftop up on 10th.</i>

[panting]

00:01:34,587 --> 00:01:37,048
- [man 2] <i>Your kid locked you out?</i>
- Yeah.

20
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:38,800
[man 2] <i>You some kind of idiot?</i>

21
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:41,469
Yeah.

22
00:01:42,678 --> 00:01:43,972

Oh, shit.

26
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:07,704
No, no, no, no, no.
No! Matt!

27
00:02:07,787 --> 00:02:09,622
Come on, Matt, wake up.

28
00:02:09,706 --> 00:02:11,457
You okay, Matt? Come on.

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,710
Get up! Matt! Matt, come on!

30
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,712
Wake up. Wake up!

31
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,881
Come on!

32
00:02:19,298 --> 00:02:21,760
Matt, can you breathe?

33
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:25,847
Matt. Can you get up?

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,601

36
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:52,016
Hey, Foggy, can I get some aspirin?

37
00:03:53,977 --> 00:03:57,021
You sure you don't want an x-ray?
Maybe a psych eval?

38
00:03:57,105 --> 00:03:58,564
An aspirin's fine, buddy.

39
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:03,611
You got shot in the head.
You're lucky you're not in the morgue.

40
00:04:03,694 --> 00:04:05,738
[chuckles] It was just
a dumb mistake, man.

41
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:09,242
- What?
- The gun on his ankle, I...

42
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:13,537
I should've heard it, you know.
I should've felt it.

43
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:15,164
- Are you serious?
- [grunts]

44
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:17,625
Yeah, but he's fast,
this guy, Foggy, he's...

45
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:19,878
He's trained.

46
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:21,795
He's a lunatic, Matt.

47
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,298
I went to the hospital.
I saw what he did.

48
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:26,968
- Where's Karen?
- We've been through this.

49
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:29,178
Oh, yeah, that's right.

50
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:31,264
Yeah, you're sure...
you're sure she's okay?

51
00:04:31,347 --> 00:04:33,516
She got Grotto to the NYPD.

52
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,726
We're gonna meet there,
make a deal with the DA.

53
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:38,521
Thanks.

54
00:04:42,984 --> 00:04:44,068
[Foggy sighs]

55
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:50,950
Thanks, buddy.
I'm gonna put on some pants.

56
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:52,911
- No.
- It's okay. I know we need to get going.

57
00:04:52,994 --> 00:04:54,120
"We" don't need to do anything.

58
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:55,872
- Foggy, I don't wanna do this right now.
- Karen's safe,

59
00:04:55,955 --> 00:04:57,373
you're safe...

60
00:04:57,456 --> 00:04:59,333
and our client will be safe
within the hour.

61
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,002
- It's all taken care of.
- Except the shooter.

62
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,836
He's still walking the streets
of Hell's Kitchen.

63
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:05,298
- He's the cops' problem now.
- He's gonna plow right through the cops.

64
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:06,382
I know what you're doing.

65
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:07,800
You saw what he did to the Irish,

66
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:09,093
you didn't see what he did
to the Mexican Cartel.

67
00:05:09,177 --> 00:05:11,930
He hung them on meat hooks,
and he left them there to die.

68
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:13,597
- You want another round.
- Blood is being shed, Foggy.

69
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:16,017
And you've donated
more than your fair share to the cause.

70
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,853
- I need to stop him.
- You need to get rest. Okay?

71
00:05:19,938 --> 00:05:22,106
And when you wake up,
you need to consider

72
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:25,568
putting that thing back
in whatever wacko box it came from.

73
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,237
Better yet...

74
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:37,997
Let go.

75
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,498
You first.

76
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:44,878
I don't wanna do this again.

77
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:45,964
Then don't.

78
00:05:46,047 --> 00:05:48,341
You know what would've happened
if someone caught us stumbling home?

79
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:51,885
- You wearing that thing?
- I appreciate it, Foggy.

80
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,887
- You taking care of me.
- You should.

81
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:56,307
But when the cops
try to take this guy down,

82
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,726
it's gonna be one hell of a fight,
lives are gonna be lost.

83
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,313
This guy's not gonna go down easy.

84
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:06,109
- I need to help.
- [sighs]

85
00:06:07,151 --> 00:06:08,486
You look like shit.

86
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,156
Stay here. Get rest.

87
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,951
We don't need people asking questions
we don't have answers to.

88
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:18,246
I've covered for you enough as it is.

89
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:25,503
And for now, let the NYPD
and the DA do their jobs.

90
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:28,381
And trust me to do mine!

91
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:30,549
Okay?

92
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:07,586
That window bulletproof?

93
00:07:10,423 --> 00:07:13,759
Twenty cops outside that door.
You're safe.

94
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:16,262
Where the hell are your boys?

95
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,721
On their way.

96
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,765
[sighs] Place of birth?

97
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:21,017
Queens.

98
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,396
Relatives? Anyone we should place
into Witness Protection with you?

99
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,855
No. I got no one.

100
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:31,735
You don't seem rattled.

101
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,197
A guy tries to blow your head off,
you ain't scared?

102
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:39,035
I'm terrified.

103
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:46,042
- Sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. Mmm.

104
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,169
The paperwork's almost done
and Brett's gonna be in in a minute.

105
00:07:48,252 --> 00:07:49,587
Where's Murdock?

106
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,422
He took a sick day.

107
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:57,511
You told us the Irish were attacked
by a whole gang of guys.

108
00:07:57,595 --> 00:08:00,013
I'm pretty sure
the word you used was "army."

109
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:01,307
You want to tell me
why I'm now hearing

110
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,641
this is all being done by one man?

111
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:04,435
- Look, I didn't know you guys were...
- Who does he work for?

112
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:06,019
- I got no idea!
- Well, what do you know?

113
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:07,605
I know he's a sociopath, that's what.

114
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,316
I mean, yeah, fine...

115
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,901
I heard the rumors, okay,
but I didn't think... [sighs]

116
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,405
I thought it was ridiculous, okay?

117
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:18,366
Ten, 20 guys could be
mowed down at a time.

118
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:20,493
And with precision?
You know, tactically.

119
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,996
Every hit was like
some kind of SEAL Team 6.

120
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,915
Then people started saying
it was one guy doing all that.

121
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:29,042
One man?
I thought it was a ghost story.

122
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:31,295
Some... [exhales]

123
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:35,341
campfire shit you tell freshies
to make 'em crap their pants.

124
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:37,426
But now...

125
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,719
You saw.

126
00:08:38,802 --> 00:08:41,347
- That guy was the Grim Reaper.
- [door opens]

127
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,600
Mr. Grote, I'm Sergeant Mahoney.

128
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:46,435
Got some clothes here for you.

129
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,271
What? Am I arrested?

130
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:51,649
Just protective custody
until we can figure out WITSEC.

131
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,733
Why the peel?

132
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:54,360
Or stay in the gown
with your ass hangin' out,

133
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:56,404
- I don't care.
- Yeah.

134
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:58,822
We pulled the security footage
from the hospital.

135
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,159
- I got ten men going over it right now.
- Any leads?

136
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:02,701
I was hoping you had something.

137
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:06,038
Let's let him change. You two wanna
step outside with me for a sec?

138
00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:13,296
[indistinct talking]

139
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,631
[door closes]

140
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:21,554
Now, the DA's office
is sending someone over

141
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:23,431
to talk you through
Witness Protection options.

142
00:09:23,514 --> 00:09:25,098
- Today?
- Yeah, right now.

143
00:09:25,183 --> 00:09:27,935
And listen,
take whatever deal they offer, okay?

144
00:09:28,018 --> 00:09:29,520
You don't wanna mess with this psycho.

145
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,104
So you do have a lead.

146
00:09:31,189 --> 00:09:32,273
[Brett sighs]

147
00:09:32,356 --> 00:09:34,233
I ever tell you what Clemons used to say?

148
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:37,027
Gotta treat witnesses like mushrooms.

149
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,239
Feed 'em shit, and keep 'em in the dark.

150
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:41,824
That scum's on a need to know.

151
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:44,034
So fill us in.
Who's bankrolling this guy?

152
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,244
Who does he work for?

153
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:47,163
The DA's office says
the shooter's independent.

154
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:50,333
Vigilante type,
targeting different crime families.

155
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:54,253
And not in a... a Daredevil way.
In a <i>Death Wish</i> way.

156
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:55,504
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

157
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:58,466
Daredevil kicks ass, this whole city
cheers like we just won the World Series.

158
00:09:58,549 --> 00:09:59,925
But this guy?

159
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:02,345
He does it, and the streets get bloody.

160
00:10:02,428 --> 00:10:06,724
Makes everybody stop and think twice
about the whole "hero" proposition.

161
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,601
Well, what do you think?

162
00:10:08,684 --> 00:10:09,935
The whole force is split.

163
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:12,062
Some cops want him off the street,

164
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,273
others think he's making our jobs
a whole lot easier.

165
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:16,525
But if you ask me,
it's only a matter of time

166
00:10:16,609 --> 00:10:18,986
before the wrong person
gets caught in the crossfire.

167
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:20,696
[breathes deeply]

168
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:23,949
Yeah, you put it that way,
I guess copycats were inevitable.

169
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:26,785
No, it's not the first, just the latest.

170
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:29,288
Yeah, we call them "Devil Worshippers."

171
00:10:29,372 --> 00:10:32,875
Nutjobs inspired by
the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

172
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,379
Shit, most of 'em are just
ineffectual idiots, but this guy...

173
00:10:36,462 --> 00:10:39,382
all my years on the force,
I've never seen anything like him.

174
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,761
[sighing]

175
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:47,931
[Foggy exhales]

176
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,863
[high-pitched ringing]

177
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,368
[ringing stops]

178
00:11:07,451 --> 00:11:08,994
Oh.

179
00:11:09,077 --> 00:11:11,664
[breathing heavily]

180
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,171
[high-pitched ringing]

181
00:11:21,382 --> 00:11:22,925
[breathing heavily]

182
00:11:28,263 --> 00:11:29,264
[ringing stops]

183
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:44,029
[thudding loudly]

184
00:11:52,871 --> 00:11:55,082
[sound fades out]

185
00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:24,069
[inaudible]

186
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:34,497
[Foggy] Shit, it's not an assistant,
it's the actual DA.

187
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,998
[sighs] That's Reyes?

188
00:12:36,081 --> 00:12:38,626
[sighs] In all her
defense-attorney-destroying glory.

189
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,043
How do I look?

190
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,754
Uh, semi-professional.

191
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,257
- No, Foggy, I'm kidding. You'll be fine.
- Okay.

192
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,925
Are they the ones that brought in Grote?

193
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:49,344
Um, Franklin Nelson,
of Nelson and Murdock.

194
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:52,890
This is my associate, Karen Page.

195
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,809
Officers, I want you to prepare
Mr. Grote for transport.

196
00:12:55,893 --> 00:12:58,145
[Foggy] Excuse me,
but, transport where, exactly?

197
00:12:58,228 --> 00:12:59,271
Once he's in our custody,

198
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:01,482
I want you to personally
handle all the arrangements.

199
00:13:01,565 --> 00:13:02,733
Just to put it out there,

200
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,611
our client's already given us
a list of his conditions.

201
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,283
Mr. Nelson, have you ever negotiated
a witness protection agreement?

202
00:13:11,909 --> 00:13:14,036
Well... speaking for my firm,

203
00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:16,414
I can attest that
we're all very fast learners.

204
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,584
The District Attorney
appreciates your efforts,

205
00:13:20,668 --> 00:13:22,753
but our office will be
handling the case from here.

206
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:25,213
[scoffs] Excuse me. Grotto is our client.

207
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,174
[Tower] And it would be in
Mr. Grote's best interest

208
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:28,467
for you to recuse yourselves

209
00:13:28,551 --> 00:13:30,969
so he can bring in a legal team
with more expertise.

210
00:13:31,053 --> 00:13:32,555
[scoffs] You mean someone
you can push around.

211
00:13:32,638 --> 00:13:35,766
We had enough expertise
to handle Wilson Fisk.

212
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,519
[Reyes] I'll say this once, Mr. Nelson.

213
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:41,396
If, God willing,
your firm doesn't collapse

214
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,441
under the weight of the chickens
and the fruit baskets

215
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:46,527
you've been collecting
from your indigent clientele,

216
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,821
there will come a time
when you need to ask a favor

217
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:50,531
of the District Attorney's office.

218
00:13:50,614 --> 00:13:53,451
And depending on how
this situation resolves,

219
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:57,913
that favor will either be forthcoming
or permanently withheld.

220
00:13:59,331 --> 00:14:01,083
Am I making myself clear?

221
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,751
Of course.

222
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:04,587
Now...

223
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:05,796
if we're through?

224
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:11,719
[stutters] I'm sorry. Just one sec.

225
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,011
[stutters] About that favor...

226
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:16,974
you wouldn't happen to have the number
for the U.S. Attorney's office?

227
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:20,018
Oh, never mind, I got it.

228
00:14:20,102 --> 00:14:22,980
Uh, U.S. Department of Justice...

229
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,649
Office of Enforcement Operations.

230
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:27,025
What the hell are you doing?

231
00:14:27,109 --> 00:14:29,737
- Zealously protecting my client's rights.
- [phone line ringing]

232
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,531
Local DA's don't have jurisdiction
over the witness protection program.

233
00:14:32,615 --> 00:14:36,243
That's solely determined by the
U.S. Attorney's office, a.k.a. the Feds,

234
00:14:36,326 --> 00:14:38,120
who are probably
just as douchey as you are,

235
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:39,830
but at least they can
deliver on their promises...

236
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:40,998
[ringing continues]

237
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:42,165
and their threats.

238
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:46,044
Since this really isn't
working out between us,

239
00:14:46,128 --> 00:14:49,297
maybe I should just
deal with them directly.

240
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:51,884
Kudos, by the way.
The cell service in here is awesome.

241
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,761
Hang up.

242
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:54,970
- [receptionist] <i>Attorney General's office.</i>
- One second.

243
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:58,140
Yes, hi. Uh...
This is Franklin Nelson.

244
00:14:58,223 --> 00:14:59,642
<i>- Spell it.</i>
- Uh, yes, uh...

245
00:14:59,725 --> 00:15:01,393
- N-E-L...
- Hang up.

246
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:03,395
[phone beeps]

247
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:06,982
What do you want?

248
00:15:07,608 --> 00:15:09,777
As I see it,
the District Attorney's office

249
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,403
would like to receive
credit for any arrests

250
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:12,946
that arise from Mr. Grote's testimony.

251
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:15,658
And my client, on the other hand,
could definitely use

252
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:18,076
the enthusiastic endorsement
of the New York DA

253
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,328
when entering in his witpro agreement.

254
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:23,248
In either case, he'll be requiring
legal representation,

255
00:15:23,331 --> 00:15:26,835
which will be provided
by the law firm of Nelson and Murdock.

256
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,754
To put it in layman's terms...

257
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,089
cut the shit, lady.
You're dealing with us.

258
00:15:31,173 --> 00:15:33,592
[scoffs]

259
00:15:33,676 --> 00:15:37,680
Let's find out if their low-life client
is even worth it.

260
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:43,226
- Oh, Foggy...
- [both chuckle]

261
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,688
- that was amazing.
- That was just round one.

262
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:47,189
[sighs]

263
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,441
I'll keep it simple.

264
00:15:49,525 --> 00:15:51,193
Give me a deal, put up a camera,

265
00:15:51,276 --> 00:15:53,987
I'll tell you everything
about those Irish pricks.

266
00:15:54,071 --> 00:15:57,074
Names, dates, their favorite titty-bars...
[chuckles]

267
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,784
That's not good enough.

268
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,452
That's what he's got.

269
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:04,456
Most of Mr. Grote's mob friends
are either dead or fleeing the country.

270
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,750
If you want this office's endorsement,

271
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,211
you'll have to give us someone
who's still breathing.

272
00:16:09,294 --> 00:16:10,921
What... So how does my client manage that?

273
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:13,924
We would like Mr. Grote to wear a wire
to meet one of his old associates.

274
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:17,260
Our files show your organization
has had dealings with one Edgar Brass.

275
00:16:18,178 --> 00:16:19,722
Brass. You're out of your goddamn mind!

276
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:21,264
- [Karen] Grotto, calm down.
- [Grotto laughs]

277
00:16:21,348 --> 00:16:23,350
- We need a second with our client.
- Fine.

278
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:27,062
Who's Edgar Brass?

279
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:29,607
Drug-dealing butcher
who's worse by a mile.

280
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,316
They send me after him,
I'm as good as dead.

281
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,651
- [Karen sighs]
- I get it, I do,

282
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:35,362
but chances are,
the Feds are gonna ask for the same thing.

283
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:39,950
Why Grotto?

284
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:42,786
Because we know your client
has worked with Brass before.

285
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:44,955
You got an in.

286
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,082
[Tower] If he could get Brass to talk,

287
00:16:47,165 --> 00:16:49,542
he would be instrumental
in taking down a major drug ring.

288
00:16:49,627 --> 00:16:51,169
If I don't?

289
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:52,462
Then you're free to walk away.

290
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,634
But don't expect to get very far.

291
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,017
Oh, God.

292
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,393
[Foggy] What the hell is that?

293
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:08,854
[Reyes] You could call it "work product."

294
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:13,441
Morgue reports generated by the shooter
who attacked you in the hospital.

295
00:17:13,525 --> 00:17:16,444
And all of these people were...
were killed by the same man?

296
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:18,238
He's tracking gangs to their home turf

297
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:20,282
and taking them out
with military precision.

298
00:17:20,365 --> 00:17:21,659
But it doesn't stop there.

299
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:22,868
What do you mean, "doesn't stop"?

300
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:24,577
[Reyes] His targets aren't random,
Mr. Grote.

301
00:17:24,662 --> 00:17:27,080
He knows exactly who he wants to hit.

302
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:30,583
And if any of his intended marks
are lucky enough to escape...

303
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:33,712
Say they're off buying a sandwich,
or in bed with the flu...

304
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:36,674
recuperating under an assumed name

305
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:37,925
at Metro-General...

306
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:41,428
[Reyes] Sooner or later,
he gets to them, too.

307
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:45,223
[Grotto sighs]

308
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:46,975
Jesus Christ.

309
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:50,646
My office is offering you
a chance to save yourself.

310
00:17:51,521 --> 00:17:53,606
Whether you take it, is up to you.

311
00:17:53,691 --> 00:17:56,109
And your, uh... legal team.

312
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,112
[cell phone vibrating]

313
00:18:01,907 --> 00:18:03,033
Reyes.

314
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,077
[door closes]

315
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,579
And the police have
no idea who's doing this?

316
00:18:07,663 --> 00:18:09,289
[Tower] It's an ongoing investigation.

317
00:18:09,372 --> 00:18:12,542
But our intelligence people
are close to completing a profile.

318
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,711
A profile?

319
00:18:13,794 --> 00:18:15,170
- Even got a code name.
- [Foggy] Like what?

320
00:18:15,253 --> 00:18:18,090
- "Killdozer," or "Dumbass With A Gun"?
- Not quite.

321
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:20,050
They're calling this one...

322
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,593
"the Punisher."

323
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:32,479
Check out the phone, man.
That's a brand new Ikea.

324
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:34,231
Idiot.

325
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:35,315
[sighs]

326
00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:40,528
Oh, I suppose this is yours too?

327
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:42,114
What do you care?

328
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:44,157
A hundred in trade, come on, man.

329
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:45,658
[shop doorbell dings]

330
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,044
Go on, get the hell out of here.

331
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:57,129
Go ahead.

332
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,467
[man grunts] Shit.

333
00:19:09,557 --> 00:19:10,809
Do I know you?

334
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:13,603
I need an NYPD mobile communications rig.

335
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:16,231
One that gets
encrypted tactical frequencies.

336
00:19:16,314 --> 00:19:17,858
[scoffs] What do I look like, RadioShack?

337
00:19:19,276 --> 00:19:21,987
Anyway, dealing in this shit is illegal.

338
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,038
Sure you're not a cop?
'Cause that's trouble I don't need.

339
00:19:31,997 --> 00:19:33,498
- Yeah...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

340
00:19:33,581 --> 00:19:35,793
I gotta ask, right?

341
00:19:35,876 --> 00:19:37,085
Just hold on.

342
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,095
[grunts]

343
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:48,180
Yep.

344
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:52,517
Straight outta
Officer McDipshit's dashboard.

345
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,063
Gets your tactical bands,
surveillance feeds.

346
00:19:56,146 --> 00:19:58,648
Hell, it'll probably pick up
the mayor banging his boyfriend.

347
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,317
[scoffs]

348
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,401
It's a grand.

349
00:20:01,484 --> 00:20:03,611
We're talking about
a one-of-a-kind item.

350
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:14,206
Video tape.

351
00:20:17,835 --> 00:20:20,420
Sure. What the hell.

352
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,841
What about the double-barrel
under the counter?

353
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:37,062
[clears throat]

354
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:03,630
Hey, man, hold on.
Sure I can't get you anything else?

355
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:06,383
You know, I got it all, man.

356
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,467
Yeah, bondage...

357
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,970
back-door, grannies,

358
00:21:10,053 --> 00:21:12,180
or maybe you're in the market
for something younger?

359
00:21:12,264 --> 00:21:14,892
She's barely 12.
Guaranteed.

360
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:21,106
[laughs] You like that, huh?

361
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:23,483
For 100 bucks, she's all yours.

362
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,115
[laughs] That's my man.

363
00:21:42,878 --> 00:21:44,421
[stutters] What the hell are you doin'?

364
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,758
Hey, man, just take it easy.

365
00:21:52,012 --> 00:21:54,222
[stammering]
I'm just trying to make a buck!

366
00:21:55,723 --> 00:21:57,017
Thank you, Ms. Kwan.

367
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,269
Yeah, and it shouldn't be
too much longer now.

368
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:03,815
[laughs] And yes, we very much
appreciate the kimchi.

369
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,442
Okay. Bye.

370
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,029
Anything else we've been ignoring?

371
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,781
Uh, yeah. Um...

372
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:15,743
There you go.

373
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:16,912
Thank you.

374
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:20,082
"Overdue."

375
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:21,499
"Past due."

376
00:22:21,583 --> 00:22:23,251
"Final notice."

377
00:22:24,294 --> 00:22:27,339
Hey! "First notice." That's a win.

378
00:22:27,422 --> 00:22:28,881
Karen?

379
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:37,765
What are you working on?

380
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:40,310
- Um, the morgue reports.
- What?

381
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:42,687
Uh, you know,
the stuff the DA showed us.

382
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:45,315
I'm just running searches
on the names in the databases.

383
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:46,399
Karen...

384
00:22:48,986 --> 00:22:51,321
I could have been
one of these people, Foggy.

385
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:55,492
- He was after Grotto.
- I know.

386
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,995
But how long can I tell myself
this is just bad luck?

387
00:22:59,121 --> 00:23:00,913
Fisk? And now this guy?

388
00:23:00,998 --> 00:23:02,915
I mean, what if I'm
drawing this stuff my way?

389
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,127
You're not.
You're gonna be fine.

390
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,962
- "Punisher" is just a nickname.
- Yeah, well, what if I deserve it?

391
00:23:08,046 --> 00:23:09,172
What are you talking about?

392
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,968
Nothing. I just...

393
00:23:17,264 --> 00:23:18,890
None of this feels real, I guess. [sighs]

394
00:23:19,016 --> 00:23:21,684
That asshole opened fire in a hospital.

395
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:24,187
You're not the one
who deserves to be punished.

396
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:29,817
And plus, you got away,
which kind of makes you awesome.

397
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:33,071
[chuckles] I guess.

398
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:36,658
Coffee?

399
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:37,867
I'm buying.

400
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,702
[smacks lips]
In that case, okay.

401
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,251
[shuddered breathing]

402
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:11,025
[distant knocking]

403
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,612
[clear knocking on door]

404
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:17,949
[audible snapping]

405
00:24:19,326 --> 00:24:20,577
[sighs]

406
00:24:25,915 --> 00:24:26,999
[knocking on door]

407
00:24:27,959 --> 00:24:29,086
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

408
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:32,089
[knocking on door]

409
00:24:32,172 --> 00:24:33,673
I'm coming, I'm coming.

410
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:35,925
Hey.

411
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,009
Hey.

412
00:24:38,261 --> 00:24:39,471
Sorry, you startled me.

413
00:24:39,554 --> 00:24:41,389
I didn't mean to.

414
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:44,601
- Come in.
- Uh, sure?

415
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:45,810
Of course.

416
00:24:45,893 --> 00:24:46,978
Okay.

417
00:24:49,939 --> 00:24:52,109
I, uh... I heard what happened.

418
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:53,401
Yeah, I'm fine.

419
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:57,364
No, uh, actually, I'm...
I'm barely holding on.

420
00:24:57,447 --> 00:24:59,574
I really don't enjoy
being used for target practice.

421
00:24:59,657 --> 00:25:00,700
[breathes heavily]

422
00:25:00,783 --> 00:25:01,909
Come here.

423
00:25:01,993 --> 00:25:03,620
[Karen sniffles]

424
00:25:03,703 --> 00:25:05,372
- I'm glad you're okay.
- [chuckles]

425
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:07,915
Me, too. [sighs]

426
00:25:13,213 --> 00:25:14,464
How about you?

427
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,175
Uh, me, yeah, I'm fine.

428
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:22,680
Hair of the dog that bit you?

429
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,101
[glass clinking]

430
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:31,689
It's, uh, it's not what it looks like.

431
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:35,568
What does it look like?

432
00:25:37,695 --> 00:25:39,864
Sorry. [chuckles]
No, I don't mean to pry.

433
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:42,033
- I just, I worry about you a little bit...
- No need. No need.

434
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:43,535
- ...sometimes.
- Appreciate it.

435
00:25:44,536 --> 00:25:45,870
There's no need to worry.

436
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:49,832
Yeah, you know that doesn't help, right?

437
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,876
You denying that there's anything wrong.

438
00:25:51,959 --> 00:25:53,628
- Karen, let's not...
- No, I... [stutters]

439
00:25:53,711 --> 00:25:55,463
How many times can I hear
that you fell down the stairs,

440
00:25:55,547 --> 00:25:58,258
- or you walked into a door?
- Well, you know, I'm blind.

441
00:25:58,341 --> 00:26:00,092
And you know that I'm not an idiot.

442
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:02,053
[sighs]

443
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:07,684
Okay, um...

444
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:11,688
Let's say this.

445
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,233
When, or if, you ever feel like...

446
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,945
you can tell me
what's really going on with you...

447
00:26:21,198 --> 00:26:22,615
I promise that I'm here.

448
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,994
Is that a deal?

449
00:26:27,078 --> 00:26:28,246
That is a deal.

450
00:26:30,623 --> 00:26:31,666
- Good.
- [chuckles]

451
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:35,628
Now, what can you tell me about
the meeting with the DA?

452
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:39,216
Yeah, um, it's...
Where to begin? Um...

453
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:42,051
- Reyes showed up.
- Personally?

454
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,221
- [chuckles] Uh, yeah.
- Any idea why?

455
00:26:44,304 --> 00:26:47,640
Well, uh, it wasn't to bask us
in the warmth of her personality,

456
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:48,725
I can tell you that.

457
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:50,393
Yeah, Reyes wouldn't buy a pack of gum

458
00:26:50,477 --> 00:26:52,229
if it didn't move her
political career forward.

459
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:53,938
[chuckles]

460
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:55,523
Well, she wants him on a wire.

461
00:26:55,607 --> 00:26:58,818
She's got him set up for a meeting
with some big fish in the mob named Brass.

462
00:26:58,901 --> 00:26:59,986
And are they gonna protect Grotto?

463
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:03,281
Yeah. But he's scared shitless
over this psycho shooter, Matt,

464
00:27:03,365 --> 00:27:04,907
and I can't say that I blame him.

465
00:27:06,326 --> 00:27:09,704
[sighs] Reyes even used it for leverage.
She called him "the Punisher."

466
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:14,959
- What do they know about him?
- That he's very scary,

467
00:27:15,042 --> 00:27:17,295
but I could have told you that.

468
00:27:17,379 --> 00:27:20,632
So whatever they know about him downtown,
they're keeping it to themselves.

469
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:22,342
All right, well, that's where we start.

470
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:25,136
We need to put together a file,
a thorough one.

471
00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:26,971
Find out who this guy is,
what makes him tick.

472
00:27:27,054 --> 00:27:28,097
- Great.
- Yeah.

473
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,724
[Karen] Mm-hmm.

474
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:33,019
You think, uh...
you think he's crazy?

475
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:37,064
Uh, the Punisher? No.

476
00:27:37,148 --> 00:27:38,858
I think he was inevitable.

477
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:42,194
Inevitable? How so?

478
00:27:43,405 --> 00:27:46,198
Maybe... maybe we created him.

479
00:27:47,575 --> 00:27:49,035
All of us.

480
00:27:49,118 --> 00:27:51,037
The moment that we let Daredevil,

481
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,872
or the Devil of Hell's Kitchen,
or whatever it is...

482
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:55,082
There's... there's no connection.

483
00:27:55,166 --> 00:27:57,544
Well, actually, I think
it's a pretty straight line, Matt.

484
00:27:57,627 --> 00:28:00,463
Daredevil practiced vigilante justice
in our backyard

485
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:02,173
and we applauded him for it.

486
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:03,883
I know that I did.

487
00:28:03,966 --> 00:28:06,218
And we never stopped to think
that maybe...

488
00:28:06,303 --> 00:28:09,306
his actions could open the door
for men like this.

489
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:12,934
Men... men with guns.

490
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:15,353
Men who think that the law
belongs to them.

491
00:28:18,356 --> 00:28:19,607
There... there's a difference.

492
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:21,984
- Well, I don't see it. Not anymore.
- Yeah, well...

493
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:23,445
Daredevil never killed anyone.

494
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:24,946
Well, not that we know of.

495
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,075
There's something about this city

496
00:28:29,158 --> 00:28:33,037
that makes good people want to
shoot their way out of bad situations.

497
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,833
You think this "Punisher"
could be a good person?

498
00:28:37,625 --> 00:28:38,668
No.

499
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,588
[stutters] No, I'm just saying...

500
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:45,049
he could be any one of us.

501
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:53,182
I'm gonna get back to Foggy.

502
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:58,145
- You know he hates prepping cases alone.
- Right.

503
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:00,357
- Uh, if you need anything at all...
- No, I won't.

504
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,692
- ...you just let us know, okay?
- Okay, thanks.

505
00:29:03,693 --> 00:29:05,945
Thank you for coming around.

506
00:29:06,028 --> 00:29:07,530
Wait, Matt, I, um...

507
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:12,952
We care about you.

508
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:19,291
You're worth keeping around.

509
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:31,596
How far away was this guy when he hit you?

510
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,098
[Matt] Four or five feet. Why?

511
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:36,809
He could've killed you.

512
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:41,272
And one inch in either direction,
your face would be spaghetti.

513
00:29:41,356 --> 00:29:43,024
I mean, look at that shot placement.

514
00:29:44,526 --> 00:29:45,693
[Matt] I got lucky.

515
00:29:45,777 --> 00:29:47,236
Yeah, maybe.

516
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,946
Or maybe it was a warning shot.

517
00:29:50,114 --> 00:29:52,534
He could've finished you off, but didn't.

518
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,578
Talk about getting your bell rung.

519
00:29:56,579 --> 00:29:58,581
Can you fix it or not?

520
00:30:04,796 --> 00:30:06,255
[sighs]

521
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:09,258
I promised Betsy I wouldn't
do anything illegal anymore.

522
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,260
I'm not a criminal, Melvin.

523
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:12,887
[scoffs]

524
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,014
You don't have a badge, either.

525
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:17,684
Look, the man who did this has
already killed dozens in Hell's Kitchen.

526
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:21,020
How much longer before innocent people
start getting caught in his crossfire?

527
00:30:21,103 --> 00:30:23,064
Yeah? [breathes heavily]

528
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:24,190
You sure he didn't follow you here?

529
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:25,942
I would never allow that to happen.

530
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,861
Okay, it's just you'd never allow yourself
to be shot in the head before.

531
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:30,447
I gave you my word, Melvin.

532
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,949
When I promised to protect
you and Betsy, remember?

533
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,161
I remember.

534
00:30:39,956 --> 00:30:41,958
It's just I can't just fix this.

535
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,334
Why not?

536
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:45,837
You gotta understand, it's not just
the cracked part that's broken.

537
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,298
The crack makes the whole thing fragile
like a bird egg.

538
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:51,634
I gotta make you a new one.

539
00:30:51,718 --> 00:30:54,011
Okay, well, how long is that gonna take?

540
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:56,097
[exhales]

541
00:30:56,931 --> 00:30:58,475
I don't know, a couple days, maybe?

542
00:30:58,558 --> 00:30:59,642
If I don't sleep.

543
00:30:59,726 --> 00:31:01,393
What can you do for me tonight?

544
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:07,399
I don't know. Reinforce the cracks.
Replace some of the padding.

545
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:10,528
Yeah, good. Do it.

546
00:31:10,612 --> 00:31:13,364
[Melvin] Okay, but it won't keep you safe.

547
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:14,782
I thought that's what you wanted me to do.

548
00:31:14,866 --> 00:31:17,744
We keep each other safe, don't we?
Isn't that our deal?

549
00:31:17,827 --> 00:31:20,121
Yeah, just do your best, Melvin. Okay?

550
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:21,539
[sighing]

551
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,880
Are you sure you're ready to go out again?

552
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,257
[chuckles]

553
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,510
Do I look ready?

554
00:31:44,228 --> 00:31:45,605
[glass clinking]

555
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:48,650
[officer speaking indistinctly]

556
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,410
[glass clinking]

557
00:33:42,805 --> 00:33:44,515
[sniffing]

558
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:08,497
[indistinct police radio chatter]

559
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:22,679
[radio chatter continues]

560
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,987
[radio chatter grows louder]

561
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,623
[floorboard creaking]

562
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:03,886
[barking]

563
00:35:05,054 --> 00:35:06,138
Hey, boy.

564
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:10,852
- [dog continues barking]
- Good boy.

565
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:25,407
Good boy.

566
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,709
[dog panting]

567
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,421
[sniffs]

568
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:40,965
[radio chatter continues]

569
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:51,017
[machinery whirring]

570
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:56,563
[men talking indistinctly]

571
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,609
Jimmy and the boys
are unloading the trailer.

572
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,236
We're breaking this down for parts.

573
00:36:13,122 --> 00:36:14,123
Come on.

574
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:18,377
[men talking indistinctly]

575
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:22,548
[rock music playing on headphones]

576
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:29,806
[men yelling indistinctly]

577
00:36:40,983 --> 00:36:42,318
[man 1] Hey... No, no, no!

578
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,444
- [gun cocks and fires]
- [man 1 grunts]

579
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:45,696
- [gun cocks and fires]
- [gang members grunt]

580
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,198
[man 2] Don't! Don't!

581
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:48,740
[firing continues]

582
00:36:53,996 --> 00:36:55,581
- [gun cocks and fires]
- [man 3 grunts]

583
00:37:00,627 --> 00:37:02,421
[loud rock music playing]

584
00:37:11,848 --> 00:37:13,850
[indistinct chatter on police radio]

585
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:44,630
[Reyes on radio]
<i>Reyes. Are we in position? Over.</i>

586
00:37:44,713 --> 00:37:47,549
[policeman on radio]
<i>Eyes on Brass. He's moving.</i>

587
00:37:47,633 --> 00:37:49,260
<i>He's moving northeast
to the warehouse.</i>

588
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:51,888
[Reyes] <i>How far out?</i>
[policeman] <i>Five minutes.</i>

589
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:53,639
[Reyes] <i>Sending in Grote in five.</i>

590
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:01,313
[Grotto] This is the frigging wire
you want me to wear?

591
00:38:01,397 --> 00:38:03,065
Why don't I just carry
a video camera with me

592
00:38:03,149 --> 00:38:04,150
and a guy with a boom mic?

593
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:06,027
[Karen] Relax, Grotto, you'll be fine.

594
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:11,657
Look, either you are
the luckiest man in Hell's Kitchen,

595
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,118
or someone up there thinks
you're worth saving.

596
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,038
- I really hope that's true.
- [Reyes] We're all set on our end.

597
00:38:17,788 --> 00:38:18,830
Well, good for you, lady.

598
00:38:18,915 --> 00:38:21,083
Me? I got some serious
reservations about this shit.

599
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:22,626
Should I be concerned?

600
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:27,048
All we need is for Brass to admit
he's dealing drugs again.

601
00:38:27,131 --> 00:38:30,217
Okay, he doesn't have to say where,
he doesn't have to say to who.

602
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:31,635
Just get him to confirm it. All right?

603
00:38:31,718 --> 00:38:33,971
Don't make it the first question.
Don't even make it the second one.

604
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:35,514
Get there organically.

605
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:37,141
You'll be in and out before you know it.

606
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:39,936
- He's got no reason not to trust you.
- No?

607
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,145
[scoffs] Look at this thing.

608
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:43,439
It's like an eight-track player
around my neck.

609
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:45,774
[Reyes] You came to us for a deal, Grotto.

610
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,069
You wanna walk, walk.
We can always find someone else.

611
00:38:48,152 --> 00:38:51,948
After recent events,
we've got plenty of exciting prospects.

612
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:55,326
Lots of low-lives are looking to
get out of the crime business for good.

613
00:38:55,993 --> 00:38:57,619
- I don't doubt that.
- Good.

614
00:38:57,703 --> 00:38:59,246
You know where we stand then.

615
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:03,459
Maybe you should do
some counseling, Counselor.

616
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,502
Hopefully before I change my mind.

617
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:10,174
This is not a deal you walk away from.

618
00:39:10,257 --> 00:39:11,508
Not alive, no.

619
00:39:11,592 --> 00:39:12,884
[Karen] You get them Brass

620
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:15,054
and they get you away
from the psychopath hunting you.

621
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:16,180
[Grotto] It ain't just him.

622
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:17,974
What if it's Brass puts a bullet in me?

623
00:39:18,057 --> 00:39:19,475
What if the Irish got wind I'm doing this?

624
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:20,684
They didn't.

625
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:22,811
When Fisk went away,
so did a lot of corrupt cops.

626
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,896
No one's palms
are getting greased anymore.

627
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:26,148
We're getting you out. Clean.

628
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:27,274
Yeah.

629
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:28,817
Doesn't feel like getting out.
Feels like getting in.

630
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,486
Deeper than before.

631
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:32,488
- No, you're not.
- [whirring]

632
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,198
Grotto, this is your second chance.

633
00:39:34,281 --> 00:39:36,283
Just don't say anything incriminating,
you'll be fine.

634
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:38,452
- You serious? Is he serious?
- No.

635
00:39:38,535 --> 00:39:40,454
- Is that a concern?
- [Foggy] No, I'm kidding.

636
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:42,331
You're covered.
That's why we're here.

637
00:39:42,414 --> 00:39:45,334
Just let the other guy
do all the talking...

638
00:39:46,335 --> 00:39:47,919
and you'll walk out of there alive.

639
00:39:49,255 --> 00:39:50,297
Fine.

640
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:53,300
These are your orders
for witness protection.

641
00:39:53,384 --> 00:39:54,385
Golden ticket.

642
00:39:54,468 --> 00:39:57,263
It's, uh, legally binding until midnight.

643
00:39:57,346 --> 00:40:01,308
Upon which, if not executed, they turn
into the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.

644
00:40:01,392 --> 00:40:02,684
- [Karen scoffs]
- What?

645
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:05,354
- Nothing.
- Let's go. It's time.

646
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,815
Bet these assholes are
sending me to Florida.

647
00:40:08,899 --> 00:40:10,817
[chuckles] Actually, they are.

648
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:12,194
[chuckles]

649
00:40:12,278 --> 00:40:13,988
Did I tell you I hate Florida?

650
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:15,614
Only about a thousand times.

651
00:40:15,697 --> 00:40:18,117
[breathes deeply]

652
00:40:21,453 --> 00:40:22,454
Thank you.

653
00:40:23,414 --> 00:40:24,498
You're welcome.

654
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,419
Kiss for good luck, sweetheart?

655
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:36,760
I'll take it.

656
00:40:36,843 --> 00:40:38,179
[chuckles]

657
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:43,767
[Foggy sighs heavily]

658
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,977
Uh, so did you hear anything from Matt?

659
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:49,481
Um, he said he's feeling a little better.
Uh, something about turning in early.

660
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:51,233
Oh, that's good.

661
00:40:51,317 --> 00:40:54,070
- Yeah. I'm sure he's fine.
- [chuckles]

662
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:11,920
[soft clanging]

663
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:27,436
It's showtime.
Target's inside the perimeter.

664
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:28,729
Target?

665
00:41:28,812 --> 00:41:32,066
Only an expression, Nelson.
Don't get your panties in a bunch.

666
00:41:32,149 --> 00:41:33,234
Stay with him.

667
00:41:37,738 --> 00:41:38,864
What the hell is he doing?

668
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:41,867
Uh, from the look of the thing,
I'd say he's trying not to crap his pants.

669
00:41:46,413 --> 00:41:47,581
[Grotto through speakers]
<i>Yo, Brass!</i>

670
00:41:48,374 --> 00:41:49,375
It's me, Grotto.

671
00:41:49,458 --> 00:41:51,835
Cut the spook act
and say something already!

672
00:41:55,881 --> 00:41:57,258
[quietly] Shit, shit.

673
00:41:58,842 --> 00:41:59,843
Shit.

674
00:42:02,429 --> 00:42:03,722
You don't wanna deal, fine!

675
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:07,684
Find someone else
stupid enough to buy H off you!

676
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,189
[clears throat]

677
00:42:13,064 --> 00:42:14,233
[Grotto] Good one, asshole.

678
00:42:16,402 --> 00:42:18,779
[clears throat]
Let's get this done.

679
00:42:18,862 --> 00:42:20,406
<i>I got places I gotta be tonight.</i>

680
00:42:27,454 --> 00:42:28,497
We lost visual.

681
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:32,876
[whimpers]

682
00:42:32,959 --> 00:42:34,670
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday,
what do you call it? Abort!

683
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:36,588
- Abort!
- I'm a cop, moron. Shut up.

684
00:42:36,672 --> 00:42:38,424
And sound.
I can't hear him anymore.

685
00:42:38,507 --> 00:42:40,509
Probably just interference from
the metal in the shipping crate.

686
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:43,304
Most likely, ma'am.
We'll, uh, try adjusting the gain on it.

687
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:47,933
Package is delivered.

688
00:42:48,016 --> 00:42:50,686
- What do you mean "package is delivered"?
- If I was you, I'd put that on.

689
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:52,563
- What? Why? Why?
- Charlie one is now set.

690
00:42:52,646 --> 00:42:54,105
- Over.
- [technican] <i>Roger that, Charlie one.</i>

691
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,275
Overwatch positions,
check in by the numbers.

692
00:42:56,358 --> 00:42:58,194
What exactly is an "overwatch position"?

693
00:42:58,277 --> 00:42:59,653
Let the police do their job.

694
00:42:59,736 --> 00:43:00,737
[scoffs]

695
00:43:02,614 --> 00:43:03,657
[police sniper] <i>Charlie three is set.</i>

696
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,701
<i>Clear fields of fire
in sectors one and five. Over.</i>

697
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:07,244
[sniper 2] <i>Charlie four is set.</i>
<i>Clear fields of...</i>

698
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:09,871
"Fields of fire"
doesn't sound like cop talk to me.

699
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:11,540
That sounds like you're
planning an ambush.

700
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:14,460
Really? You're using my client
as bait for the Punisher?

701
00:43:14,543 --> 00:43:17,171
Probably the first useful thing
your client's ever done in his life.

702
00:43:17,254 --> 00:43:19,756
Oh, I'm gonna have so much fun suing you.

703
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,509
Whatever it is that you have
planned here for tonight, it ends now.

704
00:43:22,593 --> 00:43:24,178
We're getting Grotto out.

705
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:26,263
We have a situation taking place
on Tac channel one, ma'am!

706
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:29,140
[policeman on radio] <i>Target is inbound.</i>
<i>Repeat, target is inbound.</i>

707
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:39,901
Take him out!

708
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,334
Hold your fire! Move in!

709
00:43:56,627 --> 00:43:59,045
- Keep your bead!
- I'll go left!

710
00:43:59,129 --> 00:44:00,547
Hands in the air! Now!

711
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:05,927
Shit! It's not him, it's a diversion.
Target's still out there!

712
00:44:06,011 --> 00:44:09,931
[police yelling orders indistinctly]

713
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:11,683
The bastard knew it was a trap.

714
00:44:42,548 --> 00:44:44,383
- [thudding]
- [metallic rattling]

715
00:44:46,009 --> 00:44:47,010
Shit.

716
00:44:48,178 --> 00:44:49,262
[grunting]

717
00:44:51,473 --> 00:44:52,933
[gunshots]

00:45:14,705 --> 00:45:16,247
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

720
00:45:16,332 --> 00:45:17,541

[gunshots]

722
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:25,466
Grotto's getting away.
We have to go get him.

723
00:45:25,549 --> 00:45:26,592
[Foggy] No, you can't go out there.

724
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,134
- Foggy!
- This place is about to become a war zone.

725
00:45:28,218 --> 00:45:29,720
- I don't care.
- I know it sucks,

726
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:31,680
but the safest place to be
is in this room right now.

727
00:45:31,763 --> 00:45:33,765
- [sighs]
- [Reyes] What the hell is that?

728
00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:36,226
Status report.
What's going on out there?

729
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:37,769
[policeman] <i>Target acquired.</i>

730
00:45:37,853 --> 00:45:39,187
- You know what to do.
<i>- Negative.</i>

731
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,314
<i>We do not, I repeat,
we do not have a clean target.</i>

732
00:45:41,398 --> 00:45:42,399
Shit!

733
00:45:42,483 --> 00:45:45,110
You know what to do.
Take the shot!

734
00:45:45,193 --> 00:45:47,153
- No.
- [policeman] <i>Ten-four.</i>

735
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:49,573

- [policeman] <i>We lost him!</i>
- [indistinct radio chatter]

746
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:43,334
Foggy?

747
00:46:50,426 --> 00:46:55,096

They're gone. Repeat, they're gone.
