63
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,095
from the second you get out of bed,
it's like...

64
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:29,929
every molecule in your body hurts?

65
00:05:30,012 --> 00:05:32,390
- No, never.
- [sighs] I'm in agony, dude.

66
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:33,600
What, did you go back to the gym?

67
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:37,061
Hell, no. Do I look capable
of making healthy life choices?

68
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:39,314
I went out, Matthew.
Went out dancing.

69
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:41,899
- I'm choosing not to believe that.
- And yet, it's true.

70
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:43,776
- Mind if I ask you a personal question?
- Go ahead.

71
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,154
- Are you insane?
- Yes.

72
00:05:46,238 --> 00:05:49,366
- Tell me it was the barista.
- [man] Hey, Foggy. Looking good!

73
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,576
Her name is Bethany

74
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,203
- and she is very limber.
- Oh!

75
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,329
You're my hero.

76
00:05:55,622 --> 00:05:58,833
- Watch it, asshole.
- So, uh, when's the next date?

77
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:01,002
- Well, therein lies the true pain.
- No!

78
00:06:01,085 --> 00:06:03,463
- Yes. One and done.
- [chuckles]

79
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:06,466
End of the night, she hugged me
like a cousin and said, "I'll call you."

80
00:06:06,549 --> 00:06:08,593
Oh, that's brutal.

81
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:11,513
- You know what my problem is?
- Well, it ain't the moves.

82
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:13,140
You know I got the moves.

83
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:15,392
That's the tragedy of you being blind,
you've never seen me dance.

84
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:17,477
Yeah, but I can cite the legends
I heard in law school.

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,240
So come on, what is it?
What's the problem?

86
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,690
No wingman.
You never come out with me anymore.

87
00:06:22,774 --> 00:06:25,360
Could you imagine
Nelson and Murdock on the dance floor?

88
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:28,988
[chuckles] I can't deny
that does sound epic.

89
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:30,365
- Then come out with me, Matt.
- All right.

90
00:06:30,448 --> 00:06:32,367
Come on, just one time, me and you.

91
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,328
What is it?

92
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,455
[sighs] You're bleeding.

93
00:06:38,206 --> 00:06:41,168
- Huh. Where?
- Base of the skull.

94
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,087
- [sighs]
- Did you get it?

95
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,466
[sighs] No one's gonna notice,
if that's what you mean.

96
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:49,634
Thank you.

97
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,512
- [sighs] I hate this.
- We don't need to talk about it.

98
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,264
[Foggy] Good thinking.

99
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,392
You know, Karen's been asking questions.
The cuts, the scrapes, the bruises.

100
00:06:57,475 --> 00:06:59,852
- What do you tell her?
- You have a drinking problem.

101
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,938
[chuckles] That's horrible.

102
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,440
Well, it's more plausible than

103
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,067
you put on a devil suit
and beat the shit out of strangers.

104
00:07:06,984 --> 00:07:11,030
[sighs] You know, this whole thing
isn't just your problem anymore.

105
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:13,908
And I'm past worrying
about the broken bones,

106
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:16,161
and finding you beaten into a coma.

107
00:07:16,244 --> 00:07:17,537
[Matt clearing throat]

108
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,291
- What about us?
- Nelson and Murdock?

109
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,494
You ever stop to think
what happens if you get caught?

110
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,703
At best, you'll be disbarred.

111
00:07:24,752 --> 00:07:27,214
Then you'll continue to do
the good work we started together.

112
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,840
Do you even hear yourself?

113
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:32,385
You're my partner.
I don't wanna continue alone.

114
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:33,636
Foggy...

115
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:39,517
last week, a client came to our office,
Zuly Almeida.

116
00:07:39,601 --> 00:07:41,936
Claimed her life was in danger.
We had no legal recourse to offer.

117
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,646
I remember.

118
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,023
You recommended an excellent shelter
for battered women.

119
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:48,360
- And she went.
- Yeah, she tried.

120
00:07:49,277 --> 00:07:52,530
That night, her husband found out
she wanted to leave him,

121
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:53,740
and he followed her to the bus stop

122
00:07:53,823 --> 00:07:56,368
with a gut full of beer
and a butcher knife in his hand.

123
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:59,489
- You never told me that.
- Well, I'm telling you now.

124
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,290
Mr. Almeida walked out of his apartment

125
00:08:02,374 --> 00:08:06,836
with the intention to hack Mrs. Almeida
into many bloody pieces...

126
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,921
starting by taking off her head.

127
00:08:10,465 --> 00:08:11,758
Guess what?

128
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:13,009
Never happened.

129
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:17,222
Instead, he woke up in a hospital
with two broken arms

130
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:20,267
and a restraining order
safety-pinned to his chest.

131
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,602
- Jesus, Matt.
- [sighs]

132
00:08:22,685 --> 00:08:25,062
If I take a night off,
people get hurt.

133
00:08:25,146 --> 00:08:27,399
I don't wanna lose you.

134
00:08:27,482 --> 00:08:30,235
- You won't.
- Promise me.

135
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:33,821
[chuckles] You want me to cross my heart?

136
00:08:34,989 --> 00:08:36,533
Do not make fun of me.

137
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:39,076
I swear.

138
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:42,955
- [chuckles]
- Come on. Let's get to work.

139
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,957
Yeah, I gotta get out of this heat.

140
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,668
[phone ringing]

141
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:54,717
[man] Idiots.

142
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:59,389
Good morning, guys.
You take the scenic route this morning?

143
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,724
- Morning to you, too.
- [Matt] Morning, Karen.

144
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,268
- What have we got?
- All right.

145
00:09:03,351 --> 00:09:07,439
[sighs] Well, uh, Mr. Marino's dog
was viciously beaten

146
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:10,442
by his neighbor
after the dog, um... [clears throat]

147
00:09:10,525 --> 00:09:13,653
defiled the neighbor's statue
of Saint Francis.

148
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:15,071
- "Defiled"?
- Um...

149
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,365
humped repeatedly until completion.

150
00:09:17,449 --> 00:09:21,494
- That's a dog I want to defend.
- Oh, he's... he's all yours, cowboy.

151
00:09:21,578 --> 00:09:24,831
And, uh, Mr. Maxwell here
was attacked in a bar fight last night.

152
00:09:24,914 --> 00:09:25,957
He started it.

153
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,251
[Karen] Oh, I... I called Metro-General
and the other guy will recover,

154
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,462
but if you are looking at trial,

155
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:33,298
you probably wanna wait
until his jaw is unwired.

156
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:35,174
Your girl's a badass.

157
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:38,511
- [chuckles] You've no idea.
- [phone ringing]

158
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:42,098
Um, and, uh,
Miss Jacinto's working papers

159
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,351
have been denied
for the third time.

160
00:09:44,434 --> 00:09:46,811
Her father's gone
and she says that factory work is

161
00:09:46,894 --> 00:09:48,396
the only way she can support her family.

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,231
- Well, tell her not to worry.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:50,315 --> 00:09:52,024
I've already pulled her applications
from the DOE.

164
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:54,319
Good, because we're gonna find her
something better.

165
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:56,446
And that's just the appointments
for the first hour.

166
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,448
You wanna talk about our 10:00 a.m.'s?

167
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:01,534
Uh, what's that?

168
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:04,036
Oh, uh, the bananas are from Mr. Tate.

169
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,748
Payment for that fender bender thing.
And for you...

170
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:08,833
[Foggy whispering] Strawberry rhubarb.

171
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,543
You will be mine.

172
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,087
Uh, so, um...

173
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:17,467
I installed this free trial
of accounting software on my computer.

174
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,428
And the good news is that
I can re-up it every 30 days

175
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:23,264
- with a fake email address. But, um...
- [chuckles]

176
00:10:24,849 --> 00:10:28,310
the bad news is that...
we're broke.

177
00:10:29,604 --> 00:10:33,232
As in, literally no money.
And our income can't cover our bills.

178
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,943
We'll manage.

179
00:10:36,944 --> 00:10:39,489
[chuckles] I don't know how,
but I know we will.

180
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:43,535
All right.

181
00:10:43,618 --> 00:10:45,870
Well, in the meantime,
I guess we have, um...

182
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,832
lots of pastries and...
and fruit. [chuckles]

183
00:10:49,916 --> 00:10:51,333
- Yeah, and fans.
- [Karen chuckles]

184
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,044
- Portable, electric fans.
- Yes.

185
00:10:53,711 --> 00:10:56,714
And, uh...
and each other.

186
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,390
[Foggy] Miss Jacinto,
will you come in, please?

187
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:05,347
Let's see if we can find you a better way
to live in Hell's Kitchen.

188
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,849
Please, sit down.

189
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,707
[dogs barking]

190
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,223
[dog barking]

191
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:52,687
Apologies, Mr. Nesbitt.
Blood's still up.

192
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,648
- Best you mind him, Thomas.
- [dog barking]

193
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,109
[Thomas] You miserable mutt!

194
00:11:58,192 --> 00:12:00,444
Where was all that fight 10 minutes ago?

195
00:12:03,865 --> 00:12:05,533
[dog whimpering]

196
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,288
[indistinct conversations]

197
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:20,047
Place smells like dog shit!

198
00:12:20,131 --> 00:12:21,841
There's a pot calling the kettle.

199
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:23,968
[chuckles]

200
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:27,930
Someone get this poor man a drink.

201
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:34,478
Grotto, you mangy shite.
How's the view up Nesbitt's ass?

202
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:43,530
Gentlemen, if you'll permit me...

203
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:46,282
a word before we begin.

204
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,745
This is a night for celebration.

205
00:12:53,998 --> 00:12:56,458
A night to discuss
the future of our family...

206
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:00,880
the gratitude we feel
for the support of his father.

207
00:13:02,632 --> 00:13:04,884
But perhaps as important...

208
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,472
it is also...
a moment for sober reflection.

209
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,100
[scoffs] Sober, my ass.

210
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:23,069
Two hundred years ago, our people
were little more than dirt farmers,

211
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:25,362
struggling just to survive.

212
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:28,908
They had nothing
but their hopes and their fists,

213
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,744
and they brought both of them along
when they came to America,

214
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,454
many to this very city.

215
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:35,122
Think you've had enough, George.

216
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,253
Now some of you are young...

217
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:44,215
so there's no reason you'd remember,

218
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:50,680
but there was a time
when the Irish owned Hell's Kitchen.

219
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:55,142
Wasn't a mother's son could
make a move without giving us our due,

220
00:13:55,226 --> 00:14:00,272
and any sorry shite dull enough
to cross us paid a heavy price.

221
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:03,610
We had the cops, judges, councilmen.

222
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,904
We had the whole bloody city
at our beck and call.

223
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:11,117
But we got complacent.

224
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,161
[breathes heavily]
Lost our edge.

225
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:16,956
Just enough for a piece of garbage
like Wilson Fisk

226
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:19,416
- to steal what was rightfully ours.
- [men agreeing]

227
00:14:22,419 --> 00:14:24,421
[footsteps approaching]

228
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,174
[siren wailing in distance]

229
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:37,184
- [man] That's right.
- [men agreeing]

230
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:38,645
Some of us feared Fisk.

231
00:14:40,104 --> 00:14:41,689
Some, in fact, ran.

232
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:43,650
A few...

233
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:46,944
maybe even deigned to work for him.

234
00:14:47,028 --> 00:14:50,031
Siding against their own kind.

235
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:58,455
But now the Devil's taken him down,

236
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:02,251
and that, gentlemen, has provided us
with a singular opportunity.

237
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:03,836
The Russians are dead.

238
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,964
The Chinese, they turned tail and ran,

239
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:10,342
leaving the drug trade
ripe for the taking.

240
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,178
The yakuza have gone silent.

241
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,806
- Piss on 'em!
- Piss on 'em all!

242
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,599
- Piss on 'em all.
- 'Cause this is our time!

243
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:20,645
Anyone crosses us,

244
00:15:20,728 --> 00:15:22,772
we'll paint the streets red
with their blood.

245
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,274
And when they're gone,
we'll make your father proud,

246
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:29,779
and purge ourselves of the filthy traitors
who betrayed their own kind

247
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,824
and make Hell's Kitchen ours again!

248
00:15:32,907 --> 00:15:34,450
[gunshots]

249
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,327
- [men shouting]
- [glass shattering]

250
00:15:37,704 --> 00:15:38,705
[grunting]

251
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,921
[grunts]

252
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,439
[groaning]

253
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:12,613
[grunts]

254
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,004
[breath trembling]

255
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:38,765
[groaning]

256
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:41,392
[grunts]

257
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:48,565
[siren wailing in distance]

258
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,132
[Irish jig playing on cell phone]

259
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,312
[glass shatters]

260
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,605
[crowd talking indistinctly]

261
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:39,533
See, I don't know, that definitely
sounded like cheating to me, Miss Page.

262
00:17:39,616 --> 00:17:41,660
[stutters] Foggy, you sure
we're not being hustled here?

263
00:17:41,743 --> 00:17:43,955
- As sure as Josie's AC is busted.
- [chuckles]

264
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:45,539
- What AC?
- [Karen sighs]

265
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:47,083
At least she brought water.

266
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,566
- Oh!
- No, you don't wanna do that.

267
00:17:48,625 --> 00:17:51,212
- You can't drink the water here.
- Josie's pipes have issues.

268
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:52,922
Rust, mold.

269
00:17:53,005 --> 00:17:55,674
- [chuckles]
- I think I can actually see the bacteria

270
00:17:55,757 --> 00:17:56,926
- floating in there.
- Oh, ew, ew.

271
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,302
[Foggy sighs]

272
00:17:58,385 --> 00:18:00,429
See, that... that's why we, uh,
keep our cocktails neat.

273
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,181
[Foggy] Pretend you're abroad,

274
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:04,308
on vacation someplace exotic,
but no mojitos.

275
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:05,434
Josie just throws mint in the beer.

276
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,811
- [Matt chuckles] Right.
- Take over, buddy.

277
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:07,895
I gotta hit the head.

278
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:10,397
And don't let her out of
your four working senses.

279
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:12,441
- She's as quick as she is beautiful.
- Right.

280
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,818
She reminds me of myself.

281
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,777
[chuckles]

282
00:18:18,364 --> 00:18:21,783
Ah, this place brings out something...
special in Foggy

283
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,245
[chuckles] Are you sure
it's not the alcohol?

284
00:18:24,328 --> 00:18:26,998
- No, it's the company.
- [both sigh]

285
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,624
He likes it when it's the three of us.

286
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:33,880
If it were up to him, we'd be doing this
the rest of our lives. [chuckles]

287
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,761
- [billiard balls clacking]
- God damn it.

288
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:43,222
- What happened?
- [smacks lips] There goes my shutout.

289
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,766
Um, you're going for a shutout
against a blind man?

290
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,226
[both chuckling]

291
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:48,644
How do you sleep at night, Miss Page?

292
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,022
You don't get any sympathy
from me, Murdock.

293
00:18:51,105 --> 00:18:53,440
I'm still not sure
who's hustling who here.

294
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:55,651
All right. [clears throat]

295
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,777
Here's your cue.

296
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:00,239
All right,
you're lined up with the cue ball.

297
00:19:00,322 --> 00:19:03,284
Six is at your two,
pocket straightaway.

298
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,077
Six and pocket two.

299
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,704
[Karen] Mmm-hmm.

300
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:09,373
Fire away.

301
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:16,172
- How'd I do?
- Well, you've got potential.

302
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:18,257
- All right.
- Here, go again.

303
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:32,479
Six ball. [clears throat]

304
00:19:32,563 --> 00:19:34,023
Straight ahead. Just...

305
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:37,985
- real soft.
- [heart beating rapidly]

306
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:47,286
Come on, you've done this before.
Just go for it.

307
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,582
No!

308
00:19:51,665 --> 00:19:53,209
That good, huh?

309
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:56,503
- Sunk the eight ball. [chuckles]
- Well, something went in.

310
00:19:57,171 --> 00:19:59,840
I'll tell you what.
You boys re-rack, I will, uh,

311
00:19:59,924 --> 00:20:01,425
buy rounds for the rematch.

312
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,891
- I leave you two alone for one minute...
- She wanted to teach me.

313
00:20:11,227 --> 00:20:12,478
What?

314
00:20:17,108 --> 00:20:18,734
- Show off.
- [chuckles]

315
00:20:20,527 --> 00:20:22,779
[heart beating rapidly]

316
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,210
Hey, Foggy.

317
00:20:36,293 --> 00:20:40,131
The guy at the bar looking this way,
you know him?

318
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,174
No.
Why? What's his deal?

319
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:46,553
Adrenaline's high.

320
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:49,974
His heart rate's out of control.

321
00:20:50,641 --> 00:20:52,351
Well, he is sitting next to Karen.

322
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,645
There's something in his coat.

323
00:20:55,604 --> 00:20:57,564
Coat? Hot room.

324
00:20:57,648 --> 00:21:00,192
I don't need fancy senses
to know he's probably packing.

325
00:21:00,276 --> 00:21:03,279
What? Matt, don't make a thing.
Half the people in here are carrying guns.

326
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,198
Yeah, but none of them
have their finger tapping the trigger.

327
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:08,700
Thanks, Jos. [sighs]

328
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,837
You, uh, new here, friend?

329
00:21:21,588 --> 00:21:24,716
- No, actually.
- Hey, it's all right.

330
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,261
Look, I'm just... I'm just
letting you know, this is a good place

331
00:21:27,344 --> 00:21:28,845
with good people.

332
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:31,640
A lot of places
a guy like you could drink.

333
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,143
Just saying.

334
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:37,188
It's not what you think.
I got business here.

335
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:38,772
With Nelson and Murdock.

336
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,901
You must be the blind one.

337
00:21:47,031 --> 00:21:49,908
Fifteen men, tough Irish.
Armed.

338
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,411
All of them blown away.

339
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:53,912
It was a massacre.

340
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:59,251
We weren't hit by any rival family there.
I'm telling you, we were...

341
00:21:59,335 --> 00:22:00,544
hit by an army.

342
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:04,548
[Foggy] That's quite the story.
[Grotto] It's a fact.

343
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:06,383
And believe me,
you can go see for yourself.

344
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,552
Burren Club, 47th and 10th.
Can't miss it.

345
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:12,473
It's the... part of New York
that looks like a goddamn war zone.

346
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:16,435
What's your involvement
in their organization?

347
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,481
- Who's she?
- Answer the question.

348
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,360
Brannigan. [sighs]

349
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,903
I've run with them for a long time.
I don't deny it.

350
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:30,449
Pick-ups, drop-offs,
sometimes doing things I...

351
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,284
shouldn't be.

352
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:34,911
No question, I'm...
I'm no choir boy.

353
00:22:34,995 --> 00:22:37,664
I'm tellin' ya, I just skirt the surface.

354
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:41,252
Unlike the men I work for,

355
00:22:41,335 --> 00:22:43,462
- and the guys that did this.
- [heart beating steadily]

356
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:46,507
I'm telling ya, I had nothing
to do with that massacre.

357
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:54,688
Assuming you're correct
and the Irish were hit

358
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:56,850
by a powerful crime syndicate tonight...

359
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,271
if you're the only one who survived,

360
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:03,064
your good fortune's gonna rub
some dangerous people the wrong way.

361
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,358
No shit!

362
00:23:04,441 --> 00:23:07,278
I got a pack of killers
gunning for my men. [chuckles]

363
00:23:07,361 --> 00:23:09,238
My people think I'm a traitor or a rat.

364
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,199
So, what can Nelson and Murdock
do for you, Mister...

365
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,369
- I'm Grotto.
- Grotto what?

366
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,746
Just Grotto.

367
00:23:19,248 --> 00:23:20,916
Witness protection.

368
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,459
You guys need to get me
the hell out of here

369
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:25,254
before I end up in the only place
hotter than this...

370
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:27,631
- permanent.
- [Matt] We're a private law firm.

371
00:23:27,714 --> 00:23:30,008
Yeah, a trustworthy one.

372
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:32,803
Quite a reputation
after you took out Wilson Fisk.

373
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:35,264
The DA's office is the only place
that can make a deal.

374
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:37,507
Yeah, I'm not walking to the DA
without representation.

375
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:38,892
I know a lot.
I seen a lot.

376
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:44,273
I'll give the cops anything
to get me out of Hell's Kitchen.

377
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:47,150
Well, we have a reputation
for representing

378
00:23:47,234 --> 00:23:49,570
the good people of Hell's Kitchen,

379
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:51,822
not for negotiating
on behalf of career criminals.

380
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:54,157
What if a criminal wants to...
change his career?

381
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:57,244
A second chance,
that's all I want.

382
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:58,870
I know I'm only coming here with my word.

383
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:01,582
I got nobody to vouch for me,
but I can... [sighs]

384
00:24:02,082 --> 00:24:04,501
barely cover your fee.
But word is...

385
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,712
that Nelson and Murdock
put their faith in people.

386
00:24:06,795 --> 00:24:08,464
And I need a little of that right now.

387
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:12,384
Please.

388
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,348
[sighs]

389
00:24:17,431 --> 00:24:19,600
Lie low.
We'll look into it.

390
00:24:19,683 --> 00:24:21,268
You have somewhere you can stay?

391
00:24:23,019 --> 00:24:24,145
[Karen] Jesus.

392
00:24:25,606 --> 00:24:26,732
Hey.

393
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:33,405
Guys?

394
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:35,156
Guys, he's bleeding.

395
00:24:35,241 --> 00:24:36,950
- Aw, sheesh.
- [cameras clicking]

396
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:39,620
Every time I think we've seen it all...

397
00:24:40,537 --> 00:24:46,167
Hell's Kitchen manages to sneak up
and kick me right in the balls.

398
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,295
[sighs]

399
00:24:53,174 --> 00:24:55,552
It's gonna take weeks
to process this shit.

400
00:24:56,928 --> 00:24:58,805
And where's this asshole's hand?

401
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:03,269
[indistinct radio chatter]

402
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:07,314
[officer 1] Guys, we gotta post stuff now.
[officer 2] We got two.

403
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:08,690
- You got two?
- Yeah.

404
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,817
- All right, you might need additional...
- Right, right, right.

405
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:12,653
We also got forensics on the scene.

406
00:25:13,987 --> 00:25:15,947
[man 1] Hey, I just need to know
if my brother's in there.

407
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:18,617
Step back, please. I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't answer that right now.

408
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,786
Hey, Brett!
Over here, Matt.

409
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:24,540
[Brett sighs]

410
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:27,459
I would say it's good to see you,
but under the circumstances...

411
00:25:27,543 --> 00:25:30,796
- Would you please step aside, sir?
- We got a couple of questions, Brett.

412
00:25:30,879 --> 00:25:34,425
If you're here to chase ambulances,
you might notice there are none.

413
00:25:34,508 --> 00:25:37,108
- Any leads on what happened?
- Oh, you wanna know what went down?

414
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,388
Read about it in the papers
like everybody else.

415
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,723
We're not everybody else, my man.

416
00:25:43,099 --> 00:25:45,561
Did you just say "my man"?

417
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,771
[man 2] Uh, label this one six.

418
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,318
[man 3] All right, now.
Let's get body bags over here.

419
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:53,485
[detective] Look at this, will you?

420
00:25:53,569 --> 00:25:54,778
Now, what kind of bullet
can punch through

421
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:58,365
polyethylene fiber vest
thicker than my dick...

422
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:02,243
then punch straight through
the same shit on his back?

423
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,996
[Foggy] All right, we get it.

424
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,957
You can't talk about
an active crime scene.

425
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,292
However...
[breathes deeply]

426
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:10,461
what if...

427
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:13,171
hypothetically speaking...

428
00:26:13,254 --> 00:26:15,966
we may have recently acquired
a new client that could help...

429
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,095
[stammers] shed some light
on this investigation?

430
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,431
- How recent?
- Farm fresh.

431
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,101
- Was he here?
- Client privilege.

432
00:26:27,644 --> 00:26:30,230
Well, uh, Mr. Nelson,
if that was true...

433
00:26:30,313 --> 00:26:31,398
Hypothetically speaking.

434
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:34,610
...I'd tell you that withholding
your client from the NYPD

435
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:37,028
would be obstructing
governmental administration,

436
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:40,031
and I'd probably just
arrest your ass myself.

437
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,199
In theory.

438
00:26:41,282 --> 00:26:43,494
I guess we really
can't help each other after all.

439
00:26:43,577 --> 00:26:45,829
It's over 100 degrees
out here tonight, Sergeant.

440
00:26:46,663 --> 00:26:47,748
Why would an Irish mobster

441
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:50,584
wear body armor to a private meeting
inside his own club?

442
00:26:52,002 --> 00:26:53,003
Hey!

443
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:55,881
Tell 'em keep it down in there
or somebody's getting written up.

444
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:04,431
I help you...

445
00:27:05,015 --> 00:27:06,349
you help me?

446
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:08,560
That's all we want.

447
00:27:08,644 --> 00:27:11,855
There's a total clampdown
on any of this getting out to the press.

448
00:27:11,938 --> 00:27:13,774
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Brett...

449
00:27:13,857 --> 00:27:16,443
[chuckles] you can trust us.

450
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:17,653
- We're lawyers.
- [chuckles]

451
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,157
- [sighs] Come with me over here.
- [helicopter whirring]

452
00:27:22,949 --> 00:27:24,159
[whispers] Come on.

453
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:34,628
DA's going bat shit
trying to figure it out.

454
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:39,299
This isn't the first hit
that matches this MO.

455
00:27:39,382 --> 00:27:42,553
Call it massive gang-on-gang overkill.

456
00:27:42,636 --> 00:27:44,996
Downtown office thinks we got
new players in Hell's Kitchen,

457
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:49,435
and whoever they are, we're talking some
kind of paramilitary-type organization

458
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:52,771
with the training, knowledge and hardware
to take out half the city.

459
00:27:52,854 --> 00:27:55,106
- What do they want?
- That's what's driving the DA nuts.

460
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,484
We don't know who they are.

461
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,902
We just know who they're not.

462
00:27:58,985 --> 00:28:00,987
I'd say they're definitely
not fond of the Irish.

463
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:02,906
[Brett] You think?

464
00:28:02,989 --> 00:28:06,201
[man 2] Where exactly
am I gonna put this asshole?

465
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:07,703
The morgue's completely full.

466
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:10,497
This is worse than what happened
to the Dogs of Hell.

467
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,875
[Brett] Now, we got history,

468
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,628
so I'll tell you as a friend,
you stay out of this shit.

469
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:20,090
If you got a witness, the smart move
is to turn him over and walk away.

470
00:28:20,173 --> 00:28:22,676
Hell's Kitchen is about to explode.

471
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:28,474
You hear that?
He called me friend.

472
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,062
What'd you pick up?
Your hearing's better than mine.

473
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,732
Whatever happened here happened
to the Dogs of Hell last week.

474
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,192
- The biker gang?
- Yeah.

475
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,402
- What are we stepping into?
- I don't know.

476
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:45,031
I think I can rattle some cages,
see who talks but, uh...

477
00:28:45,949 --> 00:28:47,701
Did you even listen to Brett?

478
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:50,787
We're talking about a squad
of trained killers loose on the streets.

479
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:53,665
Not the kind of guys you challenge
to a fist fight in your underwear.

480
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:56,417
Hey!
It's not underwear, Foggy.

481
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,419
Underwear is comfortable.

482
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,144
- [both chuckle]
- You're a lot of things.

483
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,007
Bulletproof is not one of them.

484
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,843
- I'll see you in the morning.
- You're an asshole.

485
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,137
But if I can't stop you,
least I can do is help.

486
00:29:08,054 --> 00:29:10,599
I have a guy I can talk to.
Maybe come back with a few puzzle pieces.

487
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,684
Cool. Just be careful.

488
00:29:12,768 --> 00:29:14,520
[chuckles] You don't get to say that!

489
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:16,187
[EKG beeping steadily]

490
00:29:25,446 --> 00:29:26,526
- [Grotto moans]
- [shushes]

491
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:28,992
Okay, okay, okay.
You've got multiple lacerations, Steve.

492
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:30,368
- [coughs]
- All right? The doctor said...

493
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:32,704
- No! No doctor.
- The cut is deep, all right?

494
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:34,164
Into the muscle,
but there's no vessel damage.

495
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:35,999
Nothing that a few weeks
of physical therapy can't cure.

496
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:37,292
You need to stay here.

497
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,919
- That ain't happening.
- No, I'm here to help you.

498
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:42,213
[grunts] By hog-tying me to a hospital
with a target on my ass?

499
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:43,549
You wanna wait for a bullet
through the window

500
00:29:43,632 --> 00:29:45,634
- or pull the trigger myself?
- You need to listen to me, Steve.

501
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,969
- No, you listen to me, you daft woman!
- You can trust me!

502
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,806
- Who, in Christ's name, is Steve?
- You are.

503
00:29:51,472 --> 00:29:54,017
Your name is Steve Schaffer,
and I am your wife, Isabelle.

504
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,227
You got into a bar fight
defending my honor.

505
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:58,021
And other than the beer
that was wasted

506
00:29:58,104 --> 00:29:59,690
when that bottle
sliced through your flesh,

507
00:29:59,773 --> 00:30:02,693
I have got no regrets, because I have
loved you since I was 16,

508
00:30:02,776 --> 00:30:05,445
hot Irish temper and all.

509
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:07,698
[breathing heavily]

510
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,829
Nurse actually cried
when I told her that part, by the way.

511
00:30:16,372 --> 00:30:18,083
It's a nice story, doll.

512
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,169
You gotta run home now.

513
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,047
You ain't got the balls for what's coming.

514
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:29,928
Slide into bed, sweetheart,
and settle in.

515
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:33,181
Because I am the best chance
you've got in the world right now.

516
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:42,440
[groans]

517
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,236
[Turk] You got your break-action singles,

518
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,197
your side-by-side,
your over-unders,

519
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,658
and the classic pump-action.

520
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:55,829
All guaranteed to supersede
every other on the market.

521
00:30:55,912 --> 00:30:57,330
None of these is semis.

522
00:30:57,413 --> 00:31:00,500
Aw, what do you need semis for,
couple bad-asses like you?

523
00:31:00,584 --> 00:31:03,253
Whatever this army is,
they're planting men by the dozen, Turk.

524
00:31:03,336 --> 00:31:04,838
No semis, no deal.

525
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:06,923
Man, I seen you shoot.

526
00:31:07,007 --> 00:31:09,092
No semi's gonna
magically make you have good aim.

527
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:12,220
Saw these off,
spread your blast,

528
00:31:12,303 --> 00:31:14,931
and thank me later,
'cause you ain't no deadeye.

529
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:16,266
What'd you just say?

530
00:31:16,892 --> 00:31:18,559
- [pipe whooshes]
- [grunts]

531
00:31:19,853 --> 00:31:21,104
Oh, shit.

532
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:22,522
[screams]

533
00:31:23,023 --> 00:31:24,399
[grunts]

534
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:28,862
- [pipe clinks]
- [grunts]

535
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,994
- [glass shatters]
- [groaning]

536
00:31:42,959 --> 00:31:45,754
Nice duds.
[breathing heavily]

537
00:31:49,465 --> 00:31:52,177
The Irish had a whole squad
massacred tonight.

538
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,346
That's a damn shame,
'cause I'm fresh out of sympathy cards.

539
00:31:56,306 --> 00:31:58,349
There's talk about an army in town.

540
00:31:59,142 --> 00:32:02,228
Military grade firepower,
high volume.

541
00:32:02,312 --> 00:32:05,899
- Who's the supplier, Turk?
- You think I know?

542
00:32:05,982 --> 00:32:08,234
Shit like that's so high above
my pay grade...

543
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:09,485
- [bone crunches]
- [groans]

544
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:10,696
I'm telling you the truth, man.

545
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,197
That tin in my trunk
couldn't kill a rabbit.

546
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,032
- [bone crunches]
- [groans]

547
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:16,284
Okay, okay!
Okay, listen.

548
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,955
I did hear somethin'
from a guy in Rikers.

549
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,289
- It's got to do with Fisk.
- [bone crunches]

550
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:22,999
[screams and whimpers]

551
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,251
- Fisk is gone.
- Yeah,

552
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:28,463
but once you took care of him,
what'd you think was gonna happen?

553
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:32,258
Every gang worth shit's trying
to grab up everything fat boy left behind.

554
00:32:32,342 --> 00:32:34,469
I even heard
the cartel's getting into it.

555
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,055
They're bringing up
some heavy munitions from Juárez.

556
00:32:37,138 --> 00:32:39,557
Military grade.

557
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,351
- Where?
- Warehouse.

558
00:32:41,434 --> 00:32:45,063
Meatpacking District,
13th Street and something,

559
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:47,107
I swear I'm telling you all I know.

560
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,775
[breathing heavily]

561
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:50,777
- [bones crunch]
- [screams and groans]

562
00:32:55,115 --> 00:32:57,617
Listen, man.

563
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,660
I gave you what you wanted.

564
00:32:59,745 --> 00:33:00,996
My hand's busted,

565
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,414
I got all this glass
I gotta replace now.

566
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:07,543
Maybe, just let a brother go, huh?

567
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,339
Come on, D.

568
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,508
I'm out on parole, man.

569
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:16,136
I can't go back to jail.
Please.

570
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:17,553
I missed Hell's Kitchen.

571
00:33:17,637 --> 00:33:18,847
Yeah.

572
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,224
- It didn't miss you.
- [keys jingle]

573
00:33:21,307 --> 00:33:22,683
[water splashes]

574
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,436
Fine.

575
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,773
Know what?
Be like that.

576
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:32,027
'Cause we both know I'll be back out
by the end of the month...

577
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,569
[groans]

578
00:33:36,656 --> 00:33:37,866
I'll see you then.

579
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,410
[rock music playing]

580
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,836
Members only, pork chop.

581
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,088
It's okay, I'm meeting a friend.

582
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:54,966
Get lost or get hurt.

583
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:59,637
[stammers] He's a full-patch member
of the Dogs of Hell.

584
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,347
I swear, I just need to talk to him.

585
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,974
What's this big shot's name?

586
00:34:03,058 --> 00:34:04,392
Smitty.

587
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,562
Don't move.

588
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,618
Does it look like I'm packing?

589
00:34:22,702 --> 00:34:24,495
Gonna wish you were.

590
00:34:29,209 --> 00:34:30,710
Come with me.

591
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,637
- [rock music playing]
- [men talking and laughing]

592
00:34:49,645 --> 00:34:51,940
[men laughing]

593
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,777
[man] Look at this asshole.

594
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,915
Says he's here to see Smitty.

595
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,504
Old friend.

596
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:17,673
- Old friend?
- [Foggy] Yeah.

597
00:35:17,757 --> 00:35:20,510
Third grade.
Sister Haney's class?

598
00:35:20,593 --> 00:35:22,470
She really had it in for us.

599
00:35:23,263 --> 00:35:26,099
Is he around or should I just...
Ow! No, no, no, no!

600
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:28,018
[groans] Holy shit!

601
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:30,061
[pants]

602
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:33,273
- What's your name?
- [stutters] Foggy! Franklin Nelson!

603
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:35,566
Never heard of you.

604
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:38,778
[stuttering] I've known Smitty
for a long time.

605
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:41,114
Oh, yeah? Me, too.

606
00:35:41,197 --> 00:35:43,158
Obviously, we went on different
career paths along the way...

607
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:45,076
- Is this funny to you?
- No.

608
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,245
- No, sir.
- 'Cause I'm two seconds away

609
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:49,998
- from slitting your throat.
- I'm not a cop, okay?

610
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,416
[screams]

611
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,709
You a fed?

612
00:35:53,793 --> 00:35:55,128
I'm a lawyer.

613
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:56,379
[yells]

614
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:59,215
Look, I just...
I just need five minutes

615
00:35:59,299 --> 00:36:02,385
with Smitty and then I swear, I'm gone.

616
00:36:02,468 --> 00:36:03,594
Yeah, you're gone now.

617
00:36:03,678 --> 00:36:07,307
Ever walk back in here again,
and you'll leave in pieces.

618
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,267
Nod if you understand me.

619
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,150
Take him out back,
show him how we feel about lawyers.

620
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:18,359
No, please, no, no, no, no, no.

621
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,643
- [man grunts]
- [Foggy groans]

622
00:36:22,238 --> 00:36:25,283
[man on TV speaking Spanish]

623
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,272
- [heart beating]
- [metal rattling]

624
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,113
[gasping]

625
00:39:08,196 --> 00:39:09,989
[Daredevil shushing]

626
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:15,411
[man mumbling]

627
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:17,622
It's okay.
I'm gonna get you down.

628
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:20,750
I'm gonna get you down. [shushes]
I'm gonna get you down.

629
00:39:23,211 --> 00:39:25,088
[man gasps]

630
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:26,672
[Daredevil grunts]

631
00:39:28,716 --> 00:39:30,796
[Foggy] It was a mistake coming here,
I realize that.

632
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:32,470
- [man] Shut up!
- I just wanted to help people, I swear.

633
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:34,930
- Smitty would understand!
- Smitty's dead, asshole.

634
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:36,224
What?

635
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:40,645
You have to believe me,
I... I didn't know that.

636
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,021
Oh, I believe
there's a lot you don't know.

637
00:39:42,105 --> 00:39:43,314
Whoa, okay, look.

638
00:39:43,398 --> 00:39:46,234
Smitty was a long time ago.
[breathing heavily]

639
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,486
Couple years ago,
I helped a guy named Foster.

640
00:39:48,569 --> 00:39:50,238
- He was a biker!
- Not one of ours.

641
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,781
- Ricky Wex?
- Shut up!

642
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:53,324
I helped a guy named Pope!

643
00:39:54,409 --> 00:39:58,204
Yeah, the VA said that his injuries
weren't sustained during battle,

644
00:39:58,288 --> 00:39:59,914
but they were!

645
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,792
They just didn't manifest themselves
for 20 years.

646
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:05,795
Uh, we got his operation sorted and then,

647
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:08,047
a couple of months later,
he was back on his Harley,

648
00:40:08,131 --> 00:40:11,217
doing whatever it is you guys do.
Which is none of my business!

649
00:40:12,552 --> 00:40:14,179
You helped Pope?

650
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:19,600
Get the hell out of here.

651
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:23,020
- Really?
- Now!

652
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:29,402
What happened to Smitty?

653
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:33,948
- You serious?
- I came here for a reason.

654
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:35,450
I just need answers!

655
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:39,119
Look, if I don't get answers,
a lot of innocent blood could be shed.

656
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,623
People who both you and I care about
are gonna get hurt.

657
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,875
And you don't seem like
the most sentimental guy,

658
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,295
but you're still listening.

659
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:52,508
And that knife isn't in my neck,
so I have to believe that right now...

660
00:40:53,759 --> 00:40:56,387
maybe you and I are on the same side.

661
00:40:57,972 --> 00:41:01,434
[chuckles] You got guts, Harvard.
I'll give you that.

662
00:41:02,852 --> 00:41:06,689
Columbia, actually, but it's not courage.

663
00:41:06,772 --> 00:41:08,483
It's more like sheer adrenaline.

664
00:41:10,109 --> 00:41:11,819
Hey, look, I wouldn't be asking,

665
00:41:11,902 --> 00:41:16,491
I wouldn't be here doing this
if it wasn't important.

666
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:29,086
Smitty was on a run,

667
00:41:29,169 --> 00:41:32,298
I-90 with four brothers,
transporting a big score.

668
00:41:32,382 --> 00:41:36,594
They were hit by a goddamn army.
Their whole crew was cut to pieces.

669
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:38,263
Left there like roadkill.

670
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:40,473
- Any idea who did it?
- Nah.

671
00:41:40,556 --> 00:41:43,684
New crew, doesn't matter.
Whoever they are, we're gonna find 'em.

672
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:47,104
And when we do, you wanna be
very far away from the action.

673
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,108
You didn't hear none of this from me.
Now go.

674
00:41:52,818 --> 00:41:54,111
And don't come back.

675
00:42:02,537 --> 00:42:04,163
