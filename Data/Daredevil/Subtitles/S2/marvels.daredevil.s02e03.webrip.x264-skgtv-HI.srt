00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:34,694
[woman] Stay down, Matty.
Don't get up.

00:01:00,804 --> 00:01:02,305
You need rest.

No, no! [grunting]

[panting]

00:02:28,057 --> 00:02:29,475

[Reyes] Someone better be getting my car.

14
00:04:04,737 --> 00:04:07,656
- Bundy's five minutes out.

[cameras clicking]

17
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,130
[Reyes] Keep the press out of here.

18
00:04:22,213 --> 00:04:25,216
No statements or photos
until we get this place spotless.

19
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,926
- We control the narrative.
- Of course.

20
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,846
And before you leave, Mr. Nelson
and Miss Page wanted a word.

21
00:04:29,929 --> 00:04:31,805
[Reyes] Ugh. Just one?
Can I get that in writing?

22
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:34,183
Oh, because written agreements
suddenly mean something to you?

23
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:36,435
You wanted your client
in witness protection, right?

24
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:38,980
My offer's still valid for 23 minutes.

25
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:41,565
- [scoffs] Grotto's gone.
- Too bad.

26
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:44,777
You used our client for bait!

27
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,612
[chuckles]
That's a pretty big allegation...

28
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:47,989
Allegation?

29
00:04:48,072 --> 00:04:49,908
Look around! This was a shit show!
He could have died.

30
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:51,325
Let's be real honest here.

31
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:53,161
No bullshit.

32
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,662
Your firm is small-time.

33
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,289
Your 15 minutes were up
after Union Allied.

34
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:59,208
Right now, you are
way out of your league.

35
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,293
Won't take much to sell

36
00:05:00,376 --> 00:05:02,128
that you're the ones
that compromised this operation.

37
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:04,505
- What?
- Say that story goes public.

38
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:07,800
The story that your incompetence
endangered the life of your client,

39
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:10,929
neighborhood civilians,
and the brave officers of the NYPD.

40
00:05:11,012 --> 00:05:12,805
You are saying that you would
blame us for this?

41
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:14,390
I never said that.
Did I say that?

42
00:05:14,473 --> 00:05:15,766
I didn't hear it.

43
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:16,893
Stay away from this case.

44
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,274
Nothing? Hmm?
Not even a little support?

45
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:27,070
All the legal kung fu in the world
wouldn't have won that fight.

46
00:05:27,153 --> 00:05:29,238
- [sighs]
- Her office could bury us.

47
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:30,323
We shouldn't have pushed it.

48
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:32,575
Yeah, well, you didn't push anything.

49
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:34,785
I know how these assholes operate.

50
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,745
We have to play it their way.
Just for now.

51
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,957
[sighs] But then what next?

52
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,001
All right, Matt promised Grotto
we would protect him, so did I!

53
00:05:42,085 --> 00:05:43,711
I'm gonna call Matt now.

54
00:05:43,794 --> 00:05:46,755
Let's see if he's...
recuperated enough to help us out.

55
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,425
[sighs] All right,
I'm gonna go back to the office.

56
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:52,261
I'm gonna see if I can find a way
that Reyes doesn't skin us alive.

[helicopter whirring]

[Punisher] They say you don't hear
the bullet that gets you.

60
00:06:11,155 --> 00:06:14,617
Always thought that sounded like
a bunch of bullshit to me.

61
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:20,539
How about you, Red?

62
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,709
When I cracked off your forehead
the other night...

63
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,629
did you hear that?

64
00:06:26,712 --> 00:06:27,796
[chains jangling]

65
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:35,054

00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,609
You can bash
against your chains all night.

72
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:51,237
Only way you get out of here,

73
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,656
only way you walk free,
is if I want you to.

74
00:06:53,739 --> 00:06:55,199
Know that.

75
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:00,663
Why didn't you take my mask off?

76
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:04,292
[Punisher] Don't give a shit
about who you are.

77
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,337
You killed everyone else.

78
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:12,716
- Why am I still alive?
- [snipping]

79
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:18,139
Huh?

80
00:07:19,098 --> 00:07:20,766
I got in your way twice now...

81
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:25,396
and you don't strike me as someone
who just lets that happen.

82
00:07:46,334 --> 00:07:47,668
Military grade hardware.

83
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,296
You seem to know your way around it.

84
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:52,215
[Punisher exhales]

85
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,635
And you sure carry yourself
like a soldier.

86
00:08:06,104 --> 00:08:08,522
What are you gonna do with all this?

87
00:08:09,315 --> 00:08:11,317
I'll do what's required.

88
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:13,944
[breathing heavily]

89
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,863
- [groaning]
- Yeah.

90
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,323
[man 1] We've been waiting six hours!

91
00:08:17,406 --> 00:08:19,367
[man 2] Come on, lady.
[man 1] Come on!

92
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,951
[Foggy] Claire, damn it, pick up.

93
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:22,620
If you get this, I'm in the ER.

94
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,288
- We need to talk.
- [cell phone beeps]

95
00:08:25,373 --> 00:08:26,415
Holy shit.

96
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:28,334
Why don't you stop hasslin' me

97
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,337
and go after the psycho
who blew away my crew!

98
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,339
[man 2] That's him!
That's the guy!

[indistinct conversations]

100
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,178
Excuse me, I'm looking
for a nurse named Claire?

101
00:08:39,262 --> 00:08:41,889
- I believe she works the night shift.
- If she's here, she's busy.

102
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:44,057
[stammers] Could you just point me
in the right direction?

103
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:45,226
- Are you injured?
- No.

104
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:46,727
Do you wanna be?

105
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,897
Mr. Carver? We can see you now.

106
00:08:51,982 --> 00:08:53,109
[man 3] Why you telling me to wait?

107
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:55,111
You've been telling me this
for like an hour already.

108
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:58,989
[man 4] Hey, get your hands off me!
I didn't say nothin'. Come on!

109
00:09:00,824 --> 00:09:03,076
[man 5] Oh, man, that's our boy.
He got jumped.

110
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,375
[EMT] I know your cousin.
I know where you live.

111
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,584
[man 5] No, he's no good.

112
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:12,795
I'm sittin', man, all right?
I'm not startin' nothin'.

113
00:09:12,878 --> 00:09:14,672
[EMT] Just relax, all right?

114
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,840
- That's what you tell me?
- [EMT] I'm not gonna tell you again.

115
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,427
- Quiet! Sit down!
- Yeah? We're not startin' nothin', man!

116
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,388
- He's the one that started it, all right?
- You keep it up, you're out of here.

117
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:25,141
[man 6] You're a dead man, you understand?
As soon as you get out.

118
00:09:25,224 --> 00:09:27,059
[Claire] Hey, listen up.

119
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:29,270
Police are waiting
to take you into custody.

120
00:09:29,353 --> 00:09:32,398
The last thing I need is for you
to come back here in two weeks,

121
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:33,524
asking what happened,

122
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:36,569
and blaming one of our people
for your mistakes.

123
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,404
Hey, so let me put this simply.

124
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:41,199
Yesterday, you had five fingers.

125
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:43,576
But tonight, you got loaded and decided
to hit up a rival clubhouse.

126
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:44,993
So now you have two.

127
00:09:45,077 --> 00:09:46,704
We're at war, lady.

128
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,247
Listen to me.

129
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,541
Had five.
Now two.

130
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:53,001
Your fault.
That clear?

131
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:56,547
Good.

132
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,550
The meds should kick in soon.

133
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:01,677
[woman speaking indistinctly on PA]

134
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:03,887
[Foggy] Claire.

135
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:06,932
Foggy Nelson.
We have a mutual friend.

136
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:08,141
Remember me?

137
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:10,311
[sighing] Shit.

[sighs]

141
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:30,080
- Nelson and Murdock, may I help you?
- [Grotto] <i>What the hell was that?</i>

142
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,124
Grotto?

143
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,293
Grotto, where are you?

144
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,420
<i>Like I'd tell you shit
after what went down.</i>

145
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,548
- Are you hurt?
<i>- Forget all that.</i>

146
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:41,842
<i>You gonna help me out or not?</i>

147
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,469
- [stammers] Uh, yeah, uh, we'll try...
<i>- Try?</i>

148
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:47,139
[sighs] Look, you have to believe me,
we had no idea what Reyes was planning...

149
00:10:47,223 --> 00:10:49,558
<i>Shut up! Shut up!
Goddamn lawyers, you're all alike.</i>

150
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,519
<i>Runnin' your mouths,
all that fancy talk...</i>

151
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:53,479
<i>All the time you're just stickin' it
to guys like me.</i>

152
00:10:53,562 --> 00:10:55,188
- Grotto...
<i>- You made promises, lady!</i>

153
00:10:55,273 --> 00:10:56,690
- [sighs]
<i>- You broke every one of 'em.</i>

154
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:57,858
I know.

155
00:10:58,859 --> 00:11:00,110
I'm sorry. [sighs]

156
00:11:01,153 --> 00:11:03,364
Listen, Grotto,
the police are coming after you.

157
00:11:03,447 --> 00:11:04,448
You have to come in.

158
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,825
<i>All that shootin', it was...
it was 'cause of him, wasn't it?</i>

159
00:11:06,909 --> 00:11:08,327
<i>The psycho from the hospital?</i>

160
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:10,454
- Yeah.
<i>- Shit.</i>

161
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:12,164
<i>Shit. He's never gonna stop.</i>

162
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:15,042
Look, the DA knows she screwed up.

163
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,795
[stammers] We can go back to her.
We can lock in witness protection...

164
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:18,962
<i>I'm done makin' deals, sweetheart.</i>

165
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:21,214

174
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:51,454
[liquid pouring]

175
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:54,998
[sighs]

176
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,089
[Daredevil] This another one
of your missions?

177
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,218
That's why we're here, isn't it?

178
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:09,930
[Punisher exhales]

179
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:11,432
How many will this make?

180
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:15,185
[liquid splashes]

181
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:16,895
I'm guessing you've done this, what...

182
00:12:16,979 --> 00:12:19,147
ten, maybe 20 times?

183
00:12:26,572 --> 00:12:28,115
[Punisher sighs deeply]

184
00:12:30,075 --> 00:12:31,744
How long's it been?

185
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,206
Six months, a year...

186
00:12:36,874 --> 00:12:37,958
or your whole life?

187
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,756
Something tells me you don't take breaks.

188
00:12:47,718 --> 00:12:49,470
You know, no one else has to die.

189
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:51,179
[assembling gun]

190
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:52,890
You could stop now.

191
00:12:54,057 --> 00:12:55,100
Walk away.

192
00:13:00,022 --> 00:13:01,314
Walk away?

193
00:13:02,566 --> 00:13:03,942
Could you do that?

194
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:06,111
Could you walk away?

195
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,366
Yeah.

196
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,119
[church bell tolling]

197
00:13:22,461 --> 00:13:24,087
[Daredevil] What is that, midnight?

198
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:26,882
[Punisher] St. Matthew's.

199
00:13:29,635 --> 00:13:30,844
You a Catholic?

200
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:34,014
Once.

201
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:37,392
[Daredevil] From New York?

202
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:40,353
Once.

203
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:42,648
[chuckles softly]

204
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,274
You still go to Mass?

205
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,902
Stop now, Red.

206
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,362
- Stop?
- Stop digging.

207
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:50,656
Ah.

208
00:13:58,456 --> 00:14:00,458
You know, a funny thing about New York...

209
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:03,836
few people are actually from here.

210
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:06,589
The ones who are...

211
00:14:07,506 --> 00:14:09,382
they don't leave.
They can't, they, uh...

212
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:11,635
They feel like the city's a part of them.

213
00:14:12,678 --> 00:14:13,679
You know?

214
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:19,518
Until one day, something changes.
Maybe they get older.

215
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,147
And then they have to leave,
they have to get out.

216
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:26,024
See the world, maybe.

217
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:29,027
Maybe they enlist?

218
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,782
Where'd they send you?

219
00:14:35,576 --> 00:14:36,827
You a shrink, Red?

220
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:43,667
Now, come on, you must be something when
you're not wearing the long johns, right?

221
00:14:44,835 --> 00:14:46,879
- I'm just a guy.
- Yeah?

222
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:50,090
You ever been to war?

223
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,718
No.

224
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:55,471
Yeah... then don't talk about it.

225
00:14:57,473 --> 00:14:59,057
I've seen some fights.

226
00:14:59,141 --> 00:15:00,476
Sure you have.

227
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,020
Well, I almost had you beat.

228
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:07,357
You talk about trading hands
on a rooftop, Red.

229
00:15:09,151 --> 00:15:11,111
I'm talking about shit, okay?

230
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:13,822
Shit that you ain't been in.

231
00:15:13,906 --> 00:15:15,658
- I know one thing.
- What's that?

232
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,367
War changes people.

233
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:21,622
Sometimes they see things
they can't unsee.

234
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:24,792
Come home to find home's
not there anymore.

235
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,877
- It changed.
- [sighs]

236
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,045
Or maybe they did.

237
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:30,213
[Punisher] Yeah, fair enough.

238
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,674
[Daredevil] I'm just saying,
I know it can be hard.

239
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:34,635
Do you?

240
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,428
You know it can be hard?

241
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:38,597
You run around this city

242
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:41,016
in a pair of little boy's pajamas
and a mask.

243
00:15:42,392 --> 00:15:46,438
You go home at night, right?
Take that mask off, maybe you think...

244
00:15:46,522 --> 00:15:49,817
it wasn't you who did those things,
maybe it was somebody else.

245
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:52,570
Well, see, soldiers...

246
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:54,697
we don't wear masks, yeah?

247
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,532
We don't get that privilege.

248
00:16:01,453 --> 00:16:04,039
- You know what I think?
- What's that?

249
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:06,959
- You're still at war.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

250
00:16:07,042 --> 00:16:09,044
So, you charge by the hour,
doc, or what?

251
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:11,714
[Punisher sighs]

252
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,300
Why am I here?

253
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:18,428
Everything you do out there
in the streets, Red, it doesn't work.

254
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:21,056
- Did you know that?
- Oh, and what you're doing is better?

255
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,726
What I do, I just do.
It's out of necessity.

256
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:25,686
[scoffs] Come on.

257
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,563
You know you're not the only one, right?

258
00:16:27,646 --> 00:16:30,691
Who did you lose? Huh?

259
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:32,484
Was it someone you loved?

260
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:34,361
Well, boo-hoo.
Let me tell you something, buddy.

261
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:36,572
Everybody's lost someone.
Doesn't mean you have to do this.

262
00:16:36,655 --> 00:16:38,949
Well, loss doesn't work the same
for everybody, Red.

263
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,034
[chuckles] Yeah, that's right.
It's clearly not working for you.

264
00:16:41,118 --> 00:16:42,578
Maybe not.

265
00:16:42,661 --> 00:16:45,372
We don't get to pick
the things that fix us, Red.

266
00:16:45,455 --> 00:16:47,165
Make us whole.

267
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:49,627
Make us feel purpose.

268
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:53,463
My moment of clarity?
It came from the strangest of places.

269
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,093
What kind of name is
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen, anyway?

270
00:16:58,176 --> 00:16:59,469
I mean, really?

271
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:03,431
I didn't ask for that name.

272
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,183
[Punisher] I'm sorry,
I don't see you running from it.

273
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:06,434
I don't do this to hurt people.

274
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:09,021
- Yeah, so what is that, just a job perk?
- I don't kill anyone.

275
00:17:09,104 --> 00:17:10,856
Is that why you think
you're better than me?

276
00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:13,316
- No.
- Is that why you think you're a big hero?

277
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,986
It doesn't matter what I think
or what I am.

278
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,279
People don't have to die.

279
00:17:17,362 --> 00:17:18,739
Come on, Red.
You believe that?

280
00:17:18,822 --> 00:17:20,908
I believe it's not my call,
and it ain't yours either.

281
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:24,828
Somebody ask you to put on that costume
or you take it upon yourself?

282
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,998
You know what I think of you, hero?

283
00:17:29,041 --> 00:17:31,168
I think you're a half-measure.

284
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,671
I think you're a man
who can't finish the job.

285
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,380
I think that you're a coward.

286
00:17:37,174 --> 00:17:39,635
You know the one thing
that you just can't see?

287
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:42,595
You know you're one bad day away
from being me.

288
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,017
- [keys jangling]
- Yeah.

289
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,143
[door unlocking]

290
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:50,145
[whispering] Someone's coming.

291
00:17:51,063 --> 00:17:52,230
Shit.

292
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,817
- Guess I'd better make a run for it.
- Hey, don't hurt him.

293
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,069
Yeah? Let's hope he doesn't
give me a reason to.

294
00:17:57,152 --> 00:17:58,654
[man] What's all that noise?

295
00:17:58,737 --> 00:18:02,407
If it's you damned kids again,
I swear I'm callin' the cops!

296
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,326
I'll say this once, Red.

297
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:05,493
You make one sound,

298
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:07,788
and I'll open his head up
all over this roof.

299
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,040
[man] Hello?

300
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:11,291
[door creaking]

301
00:18:15,713 --> 00:18:16,714
[flashlight clatters]

302
00:18:17,798 --> 00:18:19,299
This is really not a good time.

303
00:18:19,382 --> 00:18:21,051
- What's going on in here?
- You tell me.

304
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,679
- I have patients stacked up in four halls.
- Look, I get it.

305
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:25,263
You're up to your eyeballs.

306
00:18:25,347 --> 00:18:26,389
But I got a problem too,

307
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:28,934
and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't
good and goddamn urgent.

308
00:18:29,017 --> 00:18:31,144
I'm looking for a certain
mutual friend of ours.

309
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:32,771
Ouch! Careful, bitch.

310
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:37,234
I haven't seen him.
I've been on ER duty all month.

311
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,779
No breaks. I haven't been able
to walk outside of these walls lately.

312
00:18:40,863 --> 00:18:42,489
[Foggy] Sounds like
you pissed somebody off.

313
00:18:42,572 --> 00:18:44,532
Yeah, I'm getting really good at that.
[sighs]

314
00:18:44,616 --> 00:18:47,410
You rip that, you're gonna have
to re-stitch it yourself.

315
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:48,829
So he hasn't been here?

316
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:50,789
He have a reason to be?

317
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:53,125
Well, you know,
our friend is fond of extreme sports.

318
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:57,004
You can cut the shit.
I know who you're talking about.

319
00:18:57,087 --> 00:18:59,631
I thought maybe he came
to you for help again.

320
00:18:59,715 --> 00:19:01,133
The last time he came to me for help,

321
00:19:01,216 --> 00:19:04,011
I wound up elbow deep
in our mutual friend's blood.

322
00:19:04,094 --> 00:19:06,221
I'm never doing that again.

323
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:08,891
Well, maybe you can help me check records.

324
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:11,059
See if he's come in anywhere else.

325
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:12,394
Look...

326
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:14,897
I know why you're worried.

327
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:18,525
He's been building himself
quite the rep lately.

328
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:20,277
Is this something I want to hear?

329
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,445
Yo, lady, where the hell
am I supposed to go now?

330
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:23,530
[sighs]

331
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:25,448
You want the ER perspective?

332
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,950
Victims love him.

333
00:19:27,034 --> 00:19:28,786
Victimizers?

334
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:30,662
Want him more dead than ever.

335
00:19:32,873 --> 00:19:35,000
Look, if you're gonna follow me around...

336
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,377
at least make yourself useful.

337
00:19:38,586 --> 00:19:40,047
Here...

338
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,673
look around the other side of the table.

339
00:19:41,757 --> 00:19:44,301
I'm not sure I'm qualified for this.

340
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,678
You're breathing, you're not in cuffs,
you're on the team.

341
00:19:46,762 --> 00:19:48,138
Spray when I say.

342
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,473
Look, I care about our friend.

343
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,268
I believe in what he's doing,
I believe the city needs him.

344
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:56,229
But the truth is, I can't help anymore.

345
00:19:57,064 --> 00:19:58,565
I've got this shift from hell

346
00:19:58,648 --> 00:20:01,234
'cause I helped another friend
trying to do good.

347
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:03,236
Big guy.

348
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,863
Stronger than our friend.

349
00:20:06,281 --> 00:20:08,241
[sighs] And yet I'm the one
who got the shaft.

350
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:12,620
I'm just trying to keep my head down,
do my job...

351
00:20:13,371 --> 00:20:15,332
stay sane.
Spray.

352
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,586
Trust me, I don't like being
a part of this any more than you do.

353
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:21,880
But I need to find him.

354
00:20:21,964 --> 00:20:23,673
I'd do it myself, but I'm out of ideas.

355
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,593
Listen, as close as he gets, Matt's...

356
00:20:26,676 --> 00:20:28,178
pretty good at not getting himself killed.

357
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,722
I'm not so sure about that anymore.

358
00:20:30,806 --> 00:20:33,433
[man] Easy, dumb-ass.
My leg is killing me.

359
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:36,812
[Foggy] So, you've probably been
pulling in lots of DOAs lately.

360
00:20:36,895 --> 00:20:37,980
- Criminal types?
- [sighs]

361
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:40,107
There's been a serious uptick
in gunshot wounds,

362
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,067
now that you mention it.

363
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,027
[whispering] Something's really
got the gangs riled.

364
00:20:44,111 --> 00:20:46,071
It's a "someone."

365
00:20:46,154 --> 00:20:49,116
And the freak responsible
is the one Matt's up against.

366
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:52,119
I'll be out of your hair
before you know it, but, please...

367
00:20:52,744 --> 00:20:54,537
he's my best friend.

368
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:56,164
I just need to make sure he's okay.

369
00:20:57,249 --> 00:21:00,335
[man 2] You son of a bitch!
[man 1] See what you got, punk! Come on!

370
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:02,254
- Come on, get over here!
- [all clamoring]

371
00:21:02,337 --> 00:21:04,882
[man 1] I'll crack your stupid head open!
[woman] Hey! Hey! Hey!

372
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:07,092
[man 3] Somebody call security.
[woman] Calm down!

373
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,387
- [grunts]
- [woman screams]

374
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,055
[people yelling]

375
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:14,432
Who the hell are you?

376
00:21:16,309 --> 00:21:17,310
Frank. [chuckles]

377
00:21:17,394 --> 00:21:18,854
What are you doing up here, Frank?

378
00:21:19,855 --> 00:21:23,608
Well, the truth is, um,
I'm pretty sure that this here roof,

379
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:25,360
right here, this is the, uh...

380
00:21:25,443 --> 00:21:28,947
this is the last patch of real estate
in the entire goddamn United States

381
00:21:29,031 --> 00:21:31,616
where a man can just have a little peace,
be by himself, and...

382
00:21:31,699 --> 00:21:33,618
[inhales] have a smoke.

383
00:21:35,537 --> 00:21:36,914
Never seen you around.

384
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:40,333
Yeah, no. I'm, uh, in town
just visiting my crazy sister.

385
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:42,920
- Betty in 2B?
- [chuckles]

386
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:45,213
I see you've had the pleasure.

387
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:47,424
- Can't say I blame you.
- Nah.

388
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,717
My wife's the same.
Made me quit a long time ago.

389
00:21:49,801 --> 00:21:51,136
- [straining]
- [Frank] You know what they say.

390
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:52,429
- It's for our health.
- [straining]

391
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,056
[man] What about the enjoyment of life?

392
00:21:54,139 --> 00:21:55,140
[Daredevil straining]

393
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:57,142
[Frank] Guess they'll worry
about that when they're dead.

394
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:58,226
[Frank chuckles]

395
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:01,479
[chains jangling]

396
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:03,273
What was that?

397
00:22:04,107 --> 00:22:06,359
Uh, it's just... just a rat.

398
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,446
- We exterminated.
- [gun cocking]

399
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:13,366
[Frank] Lot of guys...
they half-ass it.

400
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:17,329
Remember my uncle used to tell me
that all the time. He fumigated.

401
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:18,413
Hard work.

402
00:22:18,496 --> 00:22:20,958
Yeah, well.
It's all he could get after the war.

403
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:22,459
You know, curse of a soldier.

404
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,710
Ain't that the truth.

405
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,920
Yeah. You serve?

406
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:28,006
'Nam, 3rd Marine Division.

407
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,799
Fighting 3rd, huh?

408
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:31,884
Goddamn right. You?

409
00:22:31,969 --> 00:22:33,886
Yeah, yeah.
Iraq, Afghanistan.

410
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:37,890
Welcome home.

411
00:22:37,975 --> 00:22:39,309
Thank you, sir.

412
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,146
I gotta go down right now, but, you...

413
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,898
you smoke as much as you like, son.

414
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:48,818
- [chuckles] Thank you, sir. All right.
- All right, son.

415
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:52,822
[gun uncocking]

416
00:22:54,532 --> 00:22:56,118
- Hey, Marine!
- Yeah?

417
00:22:56,201 --> 00:22:57,452
<i>Semper Fi.</i>

418
00:22:58,203 --> 00:22:59,579
[Frank chuckles]

419
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,087
[door slams]

420
00:23:15,053 --> 00:23:16,429
[Daredevil] Frank.

421
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:19,307
That's your real name?

422
00:23:21,643 --> 00:23:24,396
- You get off threatening innocent people?
- He was only in danger

423
00:23:24,479 --> 00:23:25,980
because you squealed,
because you can't follow orders...

424
00:23:26,064 --> 00:23:27,815
You had a gun on him.
You thumbed back the hammer.

425
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:29,692
Yeah, well, that was for you.
Part of the show.

426
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,319
[laughs]

427
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:33,571
What does that mean?

428
00:23:33,655 --> 00:23:36,491
I really have to spell it out
for you, Red? Huh?

429
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:39,577
I'm disappointed.
Listen carefully, okay?

430
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:41,288
- You listening? Yeah? How 'bout now?
- [cocks gun]

431
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:43,040
You listening?
Feel it?

432
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,209
[breathing heavily]

433
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:47,710
I'm not a bad guy, Red.

434
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:51,506
You wanna explain that to the orphans and
the widows of the men you killed?

435
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:53,425
For Christ's sake, that's what you think?

436
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:56,553
I'm just some crazy asshole going around
unloading on whoever I want to?

437
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,096
[Daredevil] Yeah,
that's exactly what I think.

438
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,639
- [Frank] That it?
- You think you're anything else?

439
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:02,392
[Frank] I think that the people I kill
need killing, that's what I think.

440
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,686
[Daredevil] You left men hanging
from meat hooks!

441
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:06,229
[Frank] They got off easy,
in my opinion.

442
00:24:06,313 --> 00:24:07,855
You shot up a hospital.

443
00:24:07,939 --> 00:24:09,649
[Frank] Yeah, and nobody got hurt
who didn't deserve it.

444
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:11,693
[stammers] Oh, yeah.
What about you, Frank?

445
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,362
What happens the day
someone decides you deserve it?

446
00:24:14,446 --> 00:24:16,531
I'll tell you what, they better not miss.

447
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:19,909
Come on, you run around this city
like it's your damn shooting gallery.

448
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:22,495
- You think you do...
- Yeah, what do you do? What do you do?

449
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:25,248
You act like it's a playground.
You beat up the bullies with your fists.

450
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:28,335
You throw 'em in jail,
everybody calls you a hero, right?

451
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:30,128
And then a month, a week, a day later,

452
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:32,339
they're back on the streets
doing the same goddamn thing...

453
00:24:32,422 --> 00:24:34,466
[Daredevil] Yeah, so you just
put 'em in the morgue.

454
00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:36,176
You're goddamn right, I do.

455
00:24:36,259 --> 00:24:38,386
- You ever doubt yourself, Frank?
- Not even for a second.

456
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,223
Really? Really?
You never think for one second,

457
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:43,766
"Shit, I just killed a human being."

458
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:44,934
[Frank] That's being pretty generous.

459
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:48,105
A human being who did
a lot of stupid shit, maybe even evil,

460
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:50,357
but had one small piece
of goodness in him.

461
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,234
Maybe just a scrap, Frank, but something.

462
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:55,112
And then you come along,
and that one tiny flicker of light

463
00:24:55,195 --> 00:24:56,238
gets snuffed out forever.

464
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:02,119
I think you're wrong.

465
00:25:02,202 --> 00:25:03,828
- Which part?
- All of it.

466
00:25:03,911 --> 00:25:06,456
I think there's no good in the filth
that I put down, that's what I think.

467
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,625
- And how do you know?
- I just know.

468
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:11,253
Look around, Red.
This city, it stinks. It's a sewer.

469
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:14,422
It stinks and it smells like shit
and I can't get the stink out of my nose.

470
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:18,050
I think that this world, it needs men
that are willing to make the hard call.

471
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:20,928
- I think you and me are the same!
- That's bullshit, Frank, and you know it!

472
00:25:21,012 --> 00:25:22,722
Only I do the one thing that you can't.

473
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:25,057
You hit 'em, and they get back up.
I hit 'em, and they stay down.

474
00:25:25,142 --> 00:25:28,228
It's permanent. I make sure that they
don't make it out on the street again.

475
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,312
I take pride in that.

476
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:30,438
- Let me ask you this.
- What's that?

477
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:31,648
- What about hope?
- Oh, fuck.

478
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:33,065
- Come on, Frank...
- You wanna talk about Santa Claus?

479
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,151
You wanna talk about Santa Claus?

480
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:35,693
I live in the real world too,
and I've seen it.

481
00:25:35,777 --> 00:25:37,362
- Yeah? What have you seen?
- Redemption, Frank.

482
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,030
- Ah, Jesus Christ.
- It's real. And it's possible.

483
00:25:39,113 --> 00:25:40,907
The people you murder
deserve another chance.

484
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,659
What, to kill again? Rape again?
Is that what you want?

485
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:45,119
No, Frank.
To try again, Frank.

486
00:25:45,203 --> 00:25:46,829
[panting] To try.

487
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:47,997
And if you don't get that,

488
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,832
there's something broken in you
you can't fix,

489
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,209
and you really are a nutjob.

490
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:54,754
What did you say?

491
00:25:54,837 --> 00:25:56,756
You're...

492
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,467
You're unhinged... Frank.

493
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:01,135
You are.

494
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:04,264
You think God made you
a one-man firing squad. [chuckles]

495
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:05,432
But you're wrong.

496
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,435
There is goodness in people,
even in you.

497
00:26:08,518 --> 00:26:09,561
And you're gonna have to kill me,

498
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:11,103
'cause I'm never gonna stop
coming for you,

499
00:26:11,188 --> 00:26:13,022
- until I take you down.
- [scoffs]

500
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,316
- You wanna know why?
- Why's that?

501
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,735
- Because you're insane.
- Hmm.

502
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:18,820
[laughs]

503
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,335
Late night?

504
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:35,420
What are you doing here?

505
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:38,423
Protecting our client,
who is still out there, alone.

506
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:41,968
[scoffs] You're talking about him
like he's a... a lost puppy.

507
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:45,054
Mr. Grote is a convicted criminal
and lucky we gave him the time of day.

508
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,639
- [scoffs]
- I'd forget about him if I were you.

509
00:26:46,723 --> 00:26:47,890
We promised to protect him.

510
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:49,601
Maybe you shouldn't have.

511
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:56,190
Your boss said she could take down
a firm like ours pretty quickly.

512
00:26:56,274 --> 00:26:57,275
She wasn't lying.

513
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:58,568
Huh...

514
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:02,029
So, she could also take down
someone like you?

515
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:07,452
ADA Elliot James.

516
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:09,704
Took the fall after Reyes
mishandled informants

517
00:27:09,787 --> 00:27:12,123
in the, uh, Teller case about a year ago.

518
00:27:12,206 --> 00:27:13,541
Nicole Kent got booted

519
00:27:13,625 --> 00:27:16,586
from your office after she failed
to quiet the EnSynth scandal.

520
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:19,714
Chris Davidson...

521
00:27:19,797 --> 00:27:20,798
did you ever meet him?

522
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:25,428
Fired after the State Supreme Court
disqualified your entire office

523
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:29,349
from the Pell case due to
"widespread misconduct."

524
00:27:30,475 --> 00:27:31,851
"Widespread."

525
00:27:33,728 --> 00:27:35,062
But not everyone got fired.

526
00:27:35,146 --> 00:27:37,440
See, Reyes walked out in one piece.

527
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,110
She's good at throwing
people to the wolves.

528
00:27:41,944 --> 00:27:44,906
So, sure, she can take down
Nelson and Murdock this month,

529
00:27:44,989 --> 00:27:46,240
but how long

530
00:27:46,324 --> 00:27:49,452
before you are getting
pulled into the shit with the rest of us?

531
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:52,997
You trying to scare me?

532
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,958
I am here to show you
that you and Reyes

533
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,627
are not on the same team.

534
00:27:59,296 --> 00:28:00,297
[chuckles]

535
00:28:01,298 --> 00:28:02,674
Where would you even find this shit?

536
00:28:04,467 --> 00:28:06,303
I want protection for Nelson and Murdock.

537
00:28:07,304 --> 00:28:08,721
We're small.

538
00:28:08,805 --> 00:28:10,432
We can't survive getting
thrown to the wolves.

539
00:28:10,515 --> 00:28:12,141
Not without your help.

540
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,728
After what happened today,
someone's gonna crash and burn

541
00:28:15,812 --> 00:28:18,481
and I need to know that
that won't be us.

542
00:28:20,817 --> 00:28:23,152
What makes you think I can help you,
even if I wanted to?

543
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,740
- You have information on the Punisher.
- That's classified.

544
00:28:27,824 --> 00:28:29,826
Do I look like I'm gonna post it
on YouTube?

545
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:33,079
Your boss is threatening
to disbar my friends

546
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:34,789
and dismantle our law firm.

547
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,667
Yeah, my boss is a piece of work.

548
00:28:40,211 --> 00:28:43,005
Look, how will the Punisher files,
assuming they even exist,

549
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:44,591
help you stop that from happening?

550
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:50,513
- [sighs] I'll let you know.
- [chuckles]

551
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:51,973
Unbelievable.

552
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:57,186
So, you expect me to implicate
the DA on purpose?

553
00:28:59,814 --> 00:29:01,023
Listen very carefully.

554
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:05,320
You cannot come into my office,
asking me to betray my boss,

555
00:29:05,403 --> 00:29:09,574
throwing around allegations about
this department you cannot substantiate.

556
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:13,035
So I'm going downstairs to get security.

557
00:29:17,206 --> 00:29:19,459
And you will not contact me again.

558
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:22,086
No emails. No phone calls. Nothing.

559
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,677
Good night, Miss Page.

560
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,233
- [man] You're dead!
- Go to hell!

561
00:29:44,316 --> 00:29:46,944
They found Freddie Bones
with ten slugs to his chest!

562
00:29:47,028 --> 00:29:48,279
That wasn't us, prick.

563
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:51,491
- This happen often?
- It's been a bad week.

564
00:29:51,574 --> 00:29:52,575
[grunts]

565
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:54,285
[Claire] Shit.

566
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:58,039
- Put it down! Put it down!
- Back off!

567
00:29:58,122 --> 00:29:59,331
[Claire] There's innocent people here!

568
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,625
This ain't got nothin' to do with you.

569
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,419
You're gonna hurt somebody.

570
00:30:02,502 --> 00:30:05,588
[security guard] I'm not gonna tell
you again. Put it down, now!

571
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:09,509
Hey, asshole.
How many priors you got?

572
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:10,677
What'd you say to me?

573
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,303
I asked you about your priors.

574
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:15,056
Yeah, keep talking shit.
I'll check you into ICU myself.

575
00:30:15,139 --> 00:30:16,933
You got face tattoos, friend.

576
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:19,977
That's like telegraphing,
"I know what prison meatloaf tastes like."

577
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:21,688
You just better step back, now.

578
00:30:21,771 --> 00:30:25,483
I'm not gonna ask if you know what happens
when you get charged with assault.

579
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,820
I got a hunch you got more mug shots
than baby pictures back home.

580
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:30,112
Man, who are you?

581
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:33,199
I'm the pro-bono suit you'll try to retain
after you go down for this.

582
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:36,035
Only not even my soft-hearted partner
will take your case,

583
00:30:36,118 --> 00:30:38,580
or any other self-respecting
attorney in Hell's Kitchen.

584
00:30:38,663 --> 00:30:40,790
Not because you're so badass,

585
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:43,125
but because you're just that stupid.

586
00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:45,127
You got a big mouth, asshole.

587
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,589
You forget, I do this for a living.

588
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:51,383
I could ask you to look at the faces
of the other patients.

589
00:30:51,468 --> 00:30:53,385
Every last one of 'em
scared to death,

590
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:56,055
because the two of you
can't keep it in your pants.

591
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:58,891
But I'm guessing that neither one of you
could give a collective shit.

592
00:30:58,975 --> 00:31:04,564
So I'm gonna do what attorneys do best
and appeal to your selfish natures.

593
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:07,525
Simply put,
if you carve each other up now,

594
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:11,153
in front of these witnesses,
with cops right outside,

595
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,947
you're screwed!

596
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,365
I can't just walk away, man.

597
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:18,244
I'm not asking you to lose
the oh-so-serious stink-eye.

598
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,080
Just don't fight!

599
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,752
Put 'em down.

600
00:31:25,835 --> 00:31:27,920
Let these people do their jobs.

601
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:32,216
[softly] Come on.

602
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,139
[all sigh in relief]

603
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:45,938
[indistinct]

604
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:50,568
- [indistinct chatter]
- [woman] You all right?

605
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:52,444
[sighs] Son of a bitch.

606
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:58,325
[groans]

607
00:32:04,832 --> 00:32:08,210
[Frank] .357, one round in the chamber.

608
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:12,464
Some things, they just...

609
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:14,383
They feel right in your hand, huh?

610
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,929
I know what you're thinking, Red.

611
00:32:18,012 --> 00:32:19,722
You could put a round in my arm,
in my leg,

612
00:32:19,806 --> 00:32:22,099
but it's not gonna work,
'cause I'm all geared up.

613
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:24,561
Only way you stop me is with a head shot.

614
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:27,021
- I'm not gonna shoot you.
- Nope.

615
00:32:27,647 --> 00:32:28,940
Not yet, you're not.

616
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:32,735
[door closes]

617
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:37,239
Time to put a face to all your fancy talk
about redemption.

618
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:41,202
Elliot Grote, a.k.a. Grotto.

619
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:42,620
[Grotto] I don't wanna die.

620
00:32:42,704 --> 00:32:44,038
[Daredevil] What did you do to him?

621
00:32:44,121 --> 00:32:46,583
I caught this piece of shit
stealing a car, trying to skip town.

622
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:48,543
I was scared.
I'm sorry, I was running for my life.

623
00:32:48,626 --> 00:32:49,877
- Shut up.
- [Daredevil] Stop it, Frank.

624
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:52,672
He doesn't deserve to die,
just 'cause you caught him stealing cars.

625
00:32:52,755 --> 00:32:53,881
Is that what you think?

626
00:32:53,965 --> 00:32:55,341
It's up to the law, not me and not you!

627
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:57,301
Why don't you tell him a little bit
about yourself?

628
00:32:57,384 --> 00:32:59,345
[Daredevil] You have no right to do this!
[Grotto] I'm nothing.

629
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:00,805
- I'm just nobody.
- [Frank] Oh, yeah? That all?

630
00:33:00,888 --> 00:33:02,599
I pour their drinks.
I drive their cars.

631
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:04,642
You were doing a little more than that
a few months ago.

632
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:05,727
[groans]

633
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,269
[Daredevil] What are you trying
to prove, Frank?

634
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,564
- You're trying to step up.
- [Grotto stammers] No.

635
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:10,940
- [Frank] No?
- Who are you?

636
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:14,110
Lafayette Street, 2nd floor.
Why don't you tell him what happened?

637
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:16,112
- Please, I'm sorry.
- [grunts]

638
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:18,239
- Please, please, I'm sorry.
- You tell him now.

639
00:33:18,322 --> 00:33:20,491
Frank, I'm not gonna shoot you, Frank.

640
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:22,785
Nothing happened, I'm sorry.

641
00:33:23,828 --> 00:33:25,997
- [cocks gun]
- I'm only gonna ask you one more time.

642
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,373
[Grotto] Ahh!

643
00:33:27,456 --> 00:33:28,958
I didn't know!
It was an address!

644
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:31,002
[stammering] This guy,
I didn't even know his name.

645
00:33:31,085 --> 00:33:34,213
He... he got wobbly with the wrong people,

646
00:33:34,296 --> 00:33:37,341
owed something to somebody,
'cause the order came from on high.

647
00:33:37,424 --> 00:33:38,676
- Yeah?
- [groans]

648
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,177
[Frank] What orders?

649
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:42,221
- [Grotto] The sort you can't say no to.
- Say the words!

650
00:33:42,304 --> 00:33:43,347
[Grotto grunts]

651
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,974
You say it.
Do you hear me?

652
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,142
[Grotto] You don't understand
these animals.

653
00:33:46,225 --> 00:33:47,727
[stammers] You can't back out.
You can't...

654
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,396
Just shut up!
Stop talking, Grotto.

655
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,481
- [Frank] You say it.
- [grunts]

656
00:33:53,524 --> 00:33:55,652
- [Grotto gagging]
- I won't ask again.

657
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:57,737
Say the words, asshole!

658
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,864
I did it, I killed him!
I killed him.

659
00:33:59,947 --> 00:34:01,157
- I put two in his head.
- No!

660
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,284
- [Grotto] But, I swear to God...
- Oh, God damn it.

661
00:34:04,326 --> 00:34:05,912
- [ribs crunching]
- [screams]

662
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:09,248
I didn't know... I didn't know
the old lady was in the house.

663
00:34:09,331 --> 00:34:11,333
- [Grotto whimpering]
- What old lady?

664
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:14,879
What did you do?

665
00:34:14,962 --> 00:34:18,465
I didn't know she was in the house.
She wasn't supposed to be in the house.

666
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,468
She started screaming.
I begged her to stop.

667
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:23,262
What did you do?

668
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:26,598
[panting] She saw my face.
I had no choice.

669
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:33,605
Old lady left a husband.
Dead man, wife and kids.

670
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:34,899
[Grotto] You gotta understand me.

671
00:34:34,982 --> 00:34:36,400
I had to do it.

672
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:41,989
You still think this piece of shit
is worth saving?

673
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,076
I'm not gonna shoot him.

674
00:34:45,702 --> 00:34:47,078
[Grotto groaning]

675
00:34:47,161 --> 00:34:48,579
Yeah, okay.

676
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:53,960
- I will...
- [Grotto whimpering]

677
00:34:54,043 --> 00:34:55,252
...if you don't kill me first.

678
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:57,714
- [chains jangling]
- [Daredevil straining]

679
00:34:57,797 --> 00:35:00,216

[typing]

681
00:35:05,888 --> 00:35:08,725
[Claire] Not here.
And he's not uptown, either.

682
00:35:09,726 --> 00:35:10,768
Nothing in the morgues.

683
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:13,562
Wherever our friend's spending the night,
it ain't in a hospital.

684
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:16,816
Guess that's as good a news
as I'm gonna get.

685
00:35:16,899 --> 00:35:19,110
Hey, man, with friends like these...

686
00:35:21,946 --> 00:35:23,530
He's gonna be fine.

687
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:26,367
I've seen him in action.

688
00:35:27,368 --> 00:35:28,494
[both sigh]

689
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:29,578
I'm gonna go.

690
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,080
Thanks.

691
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:34,751
You know, you're good with people.

692
00:35:36,043 --> 00:35:38,629
- Yeah, I'm a real charmer.
- I'm serious.

693
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:41,841
The only thing I ever saw stop
a thug mid-fight...

694
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:43,634
- was a bigger thug.
- [chuckles]

695
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:45,511
Yeah, I like to keep it thuggish.

696
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:49,766
And our mutual friend?

697
00:35:51,558 --> 00:35:53,978
I wish things could've been
different between us.

698
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,816
He's a very complicated man...
[clears throat]

699
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,026
and that, I don't need.

700
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:05,823
But maybe this city needs him.
[exhales heavily]

701
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:09,827
And I know he needs you.

702
00:36:14,957 --> 00:36:16,793
Matt made a mistake when he let you go.

703
00:36:16,876 --> 00:36:18,710
[Claire chuckles]

704
00:36:18,795 --> 00:36:20,337
What makes you think he did?

705
00:36:22,882 --> 00:36:25,301
- I'm losing patience, Red.
- Don't you dare shoot him.

706
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:27,219
That's a bad idea.
You see, he'll kill again.

707
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:28,763
Can't live with that, Red.
Can you?

708
00:36:28,846 --> 00:36:30,264
[Grotto] I'll leave the city.
I won't come back.

709
00:36:30,347 --> 00:36:32,099
Shut up. Shut up.
Take the shot.

710
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:33,392
- [Daredevil] Go to hell.
- Too late.

711
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:34,601
Why are you doing this?

712
00:36:34,685 --> 00:36:37,604
'Cause you need to understand that pieces
of shit like this ruin people's lives.

713
00:36:37,688 --> 00:36:39,315
Killing him's not gonna
bring anybody back.

714
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,692
[Frank] No, but it will keep him
from hurting anybody else.

715
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:42,860
No, I won't do it again, I swear.

716
00:36:42,944 --> 00:36:44,946
I'm gonna count down.

717
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:46,613
- Five...
- Look, shoot him. Shoot him!

718
00:36:46,697 --> 00:36:47,739
- Four...
- Look, shoot.

719
00:36:47,824 --> 00:36:49,867
Hey, I'm gonna hand him over
to the police myself.

720
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:52,203
I'm gonna make sure he pays
for what he's done, Frank.

721
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:53,620
[Frank] Three...
[Grotto] Shoot him! Do it!

722
00:36:53,704 --> 00:36:55,247
Take the shot, Red, take the shot.

723
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:57,416
- No.
- You don't do it, his death's on you.

724
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:58,750
Either way, you're a killer.

725
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:00,461
- Two...
- What kind of choice is that?

726
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,463
The kind I make every time
I pull the trigger.

727
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:04,465
The kind I'm gonna make right now.

[Grotto] Help me.

734
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,825
[breathing heavily]

735
00:37:30,908 --> 00:37:32,368
[Grotto] Oh, God. I'm dying.

736
00:37:35,246 --> 00:37:36,747
- God, I'm dying.
- Stay still. Stay still.

737
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:37,999
I'm gonna get you out of here.

[Daredevil] I'm gonna get you out of here.

740

Why didn't you stop him?

744
00:38:01,105 --> 00:38:02,731
I'm sorry.
