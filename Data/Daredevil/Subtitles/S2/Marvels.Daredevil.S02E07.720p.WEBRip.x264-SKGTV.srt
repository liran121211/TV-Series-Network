1
00:00:14,908 --> 00:00:17,661
[Batzer] <i>Potential juror number
17, please state your name.</i>

2
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:19,495
[Richard] <i>Richard Day.</i>

3
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:23,624
[Batzer] <i>Can you state for the court
any preexisting opinion, any at all,</i>

4
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:25,960
<i>that you may hold for the
defendant, Frank Castle?</i>

5
00:00:26,044 --> 00:00:29,172
You mean the Punisher? I
think he's an animal...

6
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:31,841
a sick, twisted, venal...

7
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,427
Hero. That's what we
should be calling him.

8
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,763
Doing the things the cops won't
do, Frank Castle is a...

9
00:00:36,846 --> 00:00:39,140
A grotesque insult to
the Second Amendment,

10
00:00:39,223 --> 00:00:42,268
a fascist without the authority.
If you ask me,

11
00:00:42,351 --> 00:00:43,937
people like Frank Castle ought to be...

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,397
Applauded for putting all the thieves

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,108
and muggers and rapists in the
morgue, where they belong.

14
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:54,405
<i>Let those bastards feel scared walking
down the street for a change.</i>

15
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:13,842
It's Son of Sam all over again.

16
00:01:13,925 --> 00:01:15,051
It's Bernie Goetz...

17
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:17,014
It's like the only thing
protecting us is Frank.

18
00:01:17,095 --> 00:01:19,806
I just moved my family to New
York, and now we're moving out.

19
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:23,893
If anyone can kill anyone in this town...
where does the insanity end?

20
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,289
Counselors, over 400 potential jurors
have come through this courtroom.

21
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,582
So I should tell you,

22
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:50,795
if you can't agree to move forward
with the 12 men and women selected,

23
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,965
I will make this trial a
living hell for all of you.

24
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:57,301
Your Honor, New York hasn't seen a trial
this divisive and this public in years.

25
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,846
Finding an impartial jury is not easy.

26
00:01:59,929 --> 00:02:02,140
Everybody has an opinion
about Frank Castle.

27
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:06,853
It's New York, Mr. Nelson. Everybody
has an opinion about everything.

28
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:11,024
Ms. Reyes, is the prosecution
satisfied with its jury panel?

29
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:13,985
- Yes, Your Honor.
- And the defense, Mr. Nelson?

30
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:15,904
[indistinct whispering]

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,699
- Uh, yes, Your Honor, we are.
- [Batzer] Thank Christ.

32
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,789
[man] The trial of <i>The People
of New York v. Frank Castle</i>

33
00:02:25,872 --> 00:02:27,665
is now in session.

34
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,992
[theme music playing]

35
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:07,223
If I get my hands on the worthless
intern who organized these files...

36
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:10,018
Oh, I'm sure that intern's just
following the DA's orders.

37
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:11,560
It's not officially sabotage,

38
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:14,480
- just sets it back.
- [Karen scoffs] It's a cheap trick.

39
00:04:14,563 --> 00:04:18,401
[Foggy sighs] We got bigger problems.
Like, locking a defense.

40
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:21,237
- M'Naghten Rule's still our best bet.
- What's that?

41
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,698
- Uh, the, uh, insanity plea.
- Whoa, whoa, guys...

42
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:26,825
We need to buy a "not guilty" verdict.

43
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,870
My high school debate team could
prove that Castle did it.

44
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:30,288
We need an affirmative defense.

45
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,082
Yeah, yeah, I get that, but I'm
not so sure Frank is insane.

46
00:04:33,832 --> 00:04:37,211
I'm no doctor, but I'd say he's
at least driven past Crazy Town.

47
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:38,880
- Foggy, I'm serious.
- [Matt] She has a point.

48
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:42,466
I mean, insanity only has a 0.12%
acquittal rate in New York.

49
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,677
[sighs] Reyes is just gonna call in

50
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,221
some expert shrink witness
to blow our case apart.

51
00:04:47,305 --> 00:04:49,723
- [chuckling] What case?
- [Karen] Look, what if we...

52
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:52,685
push for a mistrial?
[stammering] We get more time.

53
00:04:52,768 --> 00:04:54,896
We talk about the DNR and the
suits and Reyes' involvement.

54
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:57,065
We get her kicked off the case.

55
00:04:57,148 --> 00:04:58,816
She wouldn't see it coming.

56
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,946
[grunts] If we go down that road now,
we gotta prove, in a court of law,

57
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,449
that the government willfully hid
evidence of the Punisher ambush,

58
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:08,034
and that Reyes was involved.

59
00:05:08,117 --> 00:05:11,370
- Well, I was there and you were there.
- We're not exactly impartial, okay?

60
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:13,957
And either way, we need an
opening statement tomorrow.

61
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,500
I can open with PTSD as
a mitigating factor,

62
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:17,876
focus on Castle's time at war.

63
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:20,046
So you think the war is
what made Frank what he is?

64
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:22,756
Our only goal is to reduce the
charges and set precedent.

65
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,508
Castle made a lot of enemies, all right?

66
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:26,552
If he goes into general
population, he's as good as dead.

67
00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:29,472
We need to get him somewhere safe,
where he can get help, and...

68
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:30,595
citing PTSD could do that.

69
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,684
[Foggy] I mean, none of us know
what Castle saw over there...

70
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:39,148
but research suggests that... PTSD
can be triggered by new stressors.

71
00:05:39,232 --> 00:05:40,566
Like losing your family.

72
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:42,110
I need to get to work on
the opening statement,

73
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:44,237
but we need to be sure Castle
will get on board with this.

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,904
[sighs] Uh, I'll try.

75
00:05:45,989 --> 00:05:48,657
I mean, Frank made it pretty clear
he's willing to talk to me, at least,

76
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:50,326
just as long as I'm alone.

77
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:54,122
- Are you sure you wanna do that?
- Well, I wanna help.

78
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:56,624
We have a better shot at
getting him to talk if I go.

79
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,003
I'll grab the list of questions
I was working on. [Sighs]

80
00:06:00,794 --> 00:06:02,005
Okay. [Sighs]

81
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,050
Karen...

82
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,679
You know you don't have
to do this by yourself.

83
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:13,266
It's okay. Castle doesn't scare me.

84
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:17,895
- Maybe he should.
- [chuckles] I can take care of myself.

85
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:22,441
I know... [inhales deeply] but
I'd be saying it to Foggy.

86
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,777
- Or a Navy SEAL.
- [laughs]

87
00:06:27,696 --> 00:06:28,906
Just watch your back.

88
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,619
Promise.

89
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:37,706
[sighs] Here you go. Just do me
a favor, stick to the script.

90
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,791
Okay.

91
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:43,129
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

92
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:45,673
[door opens and closes]

93
00:06:45,756 --> 00:06:48,509
- [sighs] Grow up so fast, don't they?
- [laughs]

94
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:04,108
[metal detector whirring]

95
00:07:05,234 --> 00:07:06,569
[machine beeping]

96
00:07:22,668 --> 00:07:24,837
[door opening]

97
00:07:37,308 --> 00:07:38,767
[buzzer sounding]

98
00:07:55,284 --> 00:07:58,412
- [Karen] Hi, Frank.
- Ma'am.

99
00:08:00,664 --> 00:08:03,542
[guards speaking indistinctly]

100
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,170
[clears throat]

101
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,467
Um, we've been, uh, looking
over similar cases...

102
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,801
legal precedents, and, uh...

103
00:08:12,885 --> 00:08:16,472
we... we think it would help to bring
forth someone from your past...

104
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:20,017
maybe from your... your military
unit, someone who could, uh...

105
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:21,810
speak to the nature of your service.

106
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:26,232
- What's that got to do with anything?
- Um... it's a character witness.

107
00:08:27,816 --> 00:08:30,486
Uh, we put someone on the stand who...
who knows you well.

108
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:32,530
Uh, can... can speak to
what you've been through.

109
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,698
[chuckles] PTSD, huh?

110
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,785
[sighs] We think it would
greatly help with your defense.

111
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:40,788
Don't do that. It's an insult.

112
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,332
[scoffs] Lots of veterans experience it.

113
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not talking about me,
I'm talking about them.

114
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,920
It's an insult to them, people who
are actually going through it.

115
00:08:48,003 --> 00:08:51,382
I know what you wanna do, you
wanna sit here and label me

116
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:55,261
just another case of some crazy-ass
combat vet who lost his mind, huh?

117
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:59,140
Maybe that'll appeal to some shitbag
jury in some shitbag court.

118
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,394
It wasn't on a battlefield.

119
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,440
That's not when my life went to shit.

120
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,777
Now, ma'am, I believe that you told me
that you were gonna find me answers.

121
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,821
That's what you said to me. Do
you have anything for me or not?

122
00:09:13,904 --> 00:09:15,072
- Not that easy.
- That what you want?

123
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:17,200
- You want things to be easy?
- You are on trial

124
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:20,286
for multiple homicides and you don't
have a defense strategy in place.

125
00:09:20,369 --> 00:09:23,164
You don't cooperate with us,

126
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:25,666
it doesn't matter if I help you
figure out who killed your family,

127
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:27,042
you will never see justice.

128
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,840
All you will do, the rest of your
life, is rot in a goddamn jail cell!

129
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,935
Colonel Ray Schoonover. My old CO.

130
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:46,979
[sighs]

131
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:50,233
Let's forget the PTSD defense, but
if you want a character witness,

132
00:09:50,316 --> 00:09:51,817
the colonel, he will do.

133
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:54,195
Thank you.

134
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:57,114
Now, ma'am, do you have
anything for me or not?

135
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:02,703
Maybe I just ought to go back and
rot in my goddamn jail cell?

136
00:10:03,954 --> 00:10:06,874
Yeah. Yeah, I did some digging.

137
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,503
All right, there are huge moving parts
and they do not want to be seen.

138
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:13,339
I've already looked at all of those.
I've done it a hundred times.

139
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,132
Sure...

140
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:16,634
but you haven't done it with me.

141
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,557
[switch clicks]

142
00:10:23,641 --> 00:10:25,100
[clears throat]

143
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:28,562
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

144
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:31,774
- [stammers] Imagine, if you will...
- [cell phone rings]

145
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:36,404
- [phone beeps]
- Yeah, this is Matt.

146
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:39,532
- [Elektra] <i>I found a lead.</i>
- [softly] Hold on.

147
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,332
Elektra, I can't do this right now.

148
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,668
<i>The guy who encoded that ledger of ours?</i>

149
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,795
<i>Some pervy NYU professor,</i>

150
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:55,548
<i>master cryptographer who
teaches Asian studies.</i>

151
00:10:55,631 --> 00:10:57,966
<i>- I'm gonna go beat the cipher out of him.</i>
- [knocking]

152
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,343
- Yeah.
<i>- You wanna come?</i>

153
00:10:59,427 --> 00:11:00,636
- [Foggy] Hey.
- Hey.

154
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:02,388
You check out these Dogs of Hell depos?

155
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:03,514
Might as well have been
written in crayon.

156
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:04,890
I think we could poke
some holes in these.

157
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:06,813
That's great. Yeah. Just,
uh, give me a minute.

158
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,736
The most important case we've ever
handled starts in the morning.

159
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,154
I can't go with you.

160
00:11:19,237 --> 00:11:20,948
<i>- Can't or won't?</i>
- Can't.

161
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,451
My life doesn't stop
every time you call.

162
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:26,244
<i>This may be our one chance
to translate this ledger</i>

163
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:30,333
<i>before the Yakuza adjust their plans and
we lose all the progress we've made.</i>

164
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,584
You're infuriating.

165
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,294
<i>Tell me in person. Two hours.
Barclay and Church.</i>

166
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:37,423
I know I'm into some sick
shit, but next time, I swear,

167
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:41,385
all I wanna do is eat moo goo
gai pan off your bodies.

168
00:11:41,469 --> 00:11:44,763
All day. [Laughs]

169
00:11:44,847 --> 00:11:48,642
- We're not Chinese.
- Whatever, it's all hot to me.

170
00:11:49,852 --> 00:11:51,395
[in Korean] What?

171
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,689
He's a repulsive asshole.

172
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:57,735
[in Korean] A repulsive
asshole who pays well.

173
00:11:58,902 --> 00:12:03,366
I can't tell any of you
apart, but I guarantee...

174
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:07,370
I know all your tongues
better than you do.

175
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:10,330
[in English] So... be nice.

176
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:13,250
Get out.

177
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:32,310
[Elektra] Hey, honey, I'm home.

178
00:12:32,395 --> 00:12:35,481
And you've been awfully naughty.

179
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,654
You're gonna wanna stay real still.

180
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:44,990
[groaning]

181
00:12:49,369 --> 00:12:50,370
[Elektra grunts]

182
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,793
What the hell do you want from me?

183
00:12:55,876 --> 00:12:58,879
- You were hired by the Yakuza.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

184
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:00,964
You encrypted files for them.

185
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,008
[Elektra] Money must be good.

186
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:05,928
Not many professors can afford
garish, high-rise flats

187
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,431
and a revolving door of prostitutes.

188
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:09,807
What do you want me to do?

189
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,811
What you do best, Philip. Translate.

190
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:14,937
[Elektra] But this time for us.

191
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,231
[laughs] They will kill me
if I tell you anything.

192
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,635
[Elektra] And if you don't,
we'll make you beg for killing.

193
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:24,780
[Philip groans]

194
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,365
- [Daredevil grunts]
- [glass cracks]

195
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,994
Thirty stories up, Philip.

196
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:33,080
[Elektra] You'd make a mighty good mess.

197
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,499
More liquid than solid, I'd imagine.

198
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,584
[panting]

199
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,836
- What do you say, Professor?
- Come on, please...

200
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,170
- [Daredevil yells]
- [glass cracking]

201
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,338
[Philip] Please... please.

202
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,131
- I'll pay you, I'll do anything.
- [Elektra] Once more.

203
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:45,425
- [glass cracks]
- [Philip panting]

204
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:47,553
I can't. I can't, they'll kill me.

205
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:49,680
- [Elektra sighs] It's gonna break.
- [Daredevil grunts]

206
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,098
Okay! Okay, shit!

207
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,016
- Stop! I'll do it! I'll do it!
- [Daredevil grunting]

208
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,142
I'll help you.

209
00:13:54,226 --> 00:13:56,353
- [glass splintering]
- [breathing heavily]

210
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:06,780
[Elektra] All right, be a pet and
tell us how to read this last page.

211
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:07,865
[grunts]

212
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,118
[Philip] They wanted a code
that couldn't be hacked.

213
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:14,204
- [glass shatters]
- [wind blowing]

214
00:14:15,664 --> 00:14:18,375
[Philip breathing heavily] I
put the Japanese alphabet...

215
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,168
through a cipher.

216
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:23,005
Now...

217
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:27,009
put the characters through the
matrix, you can decode it all.

218
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:28,552
You do it.

219
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:31,304
[exhales]

220
00:14:38,436 --> 00:14:41,023
There's weekly shipments.

221
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:43,484
Next one is tonight at 11:00.

222
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:46,695
Bay Ridge Rail Yard.

223
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,114
You find a boxcar with that number...

224
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,868
and you can find the train
you're looking for.

225
00:14:52,951 --> 00:14:54,351
[Daredevil] What are they shipping?

226
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:56,246
It doesn't say, I swear.

227
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,791
I swear! [stammers] I
can't help you anymore.

228
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,002
[breathing heavily]

229
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:06,173
[Elektra] Well, thank you
for your help, Professor.

230
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,094
Do yourself a favor. Find
better business partners.

231
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,289
[Elektra] And kill your decorator.

232
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,182
[groans]

233
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:27,903
[door opens]

234
00:15:34,743 --> 00:15:37,287
Hey. Hungry?

235
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,666
[sighs] No. I don't think
I'm ever gonna eat again.

236
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,544
Cost of looking at these all day.

237
00:15:43,627 --> 00:15:46,421
Yeah. How about some fresh coffee?

238
00:15:46,504 --> 00:15:48,256
Yes. [Chuckles]

239
00:15:51,885 --> 00:15:53,679
Uh, where's Matt?

240
00:15:53,762 --> 00:15:56,306
I thought he'd be burning
the midnight oil with you.

241
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,017
I... He's, um...

242
00:15:59,101 --> 00:16:01,353
He's working on his opening statements.

243
00:16:01,937 --> 00:16:03,105
Oh.

244
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:06,441
Did you... you talk to Castle?

245
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:09,570
Yeah, um...

246
00:16:11,363 --> 00:16:14,950
He, uh, won't endorse PTSD, so...

247
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,744
Oh, shit!

248
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:19,204
He's... he's not having
war flashbacks, Foggy.

249
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:20,581
It... it's just not the truth.

250
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:23,541
Did Castle say anything that we can use?

251
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,543
'Cause when the judge calls
his first witness tomorrow,

252
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:29,047
my only plan so far is
to run away, and...

253
00:16:29,131 --> 00:16:30,966
open a butcher shop.

254
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:35,012
Well... I, uh, went over some
of our files with Frank.

255
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,598
The medical examiner's report
from his family's murder,

256
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:38,849
it's filled out by a, um...

257
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:41,977
- Dr. Gregory Tepper.
- Yeah.

258
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,896
He's the chief medical examiner.

259
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:46,189
He's scheduled to testify for Reyes.

260
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:51,528
[scoffs] Well... his report says that
Lisa, Frank, Jr. and Maria Castle

261
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:55,741
each were killed by a single gunshot, but
Frank says there were multiple wounds.

262
00:16:55,824 --> 00:16:58,869
He describes them in awful detail, um...

263
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,664
different angles, uh...

264
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:04,541
bullet calibers, exit wounds
that are too big for a handgun.

265
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,628
I mean, his family was
practically shredded.

266
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:11,757
There's a discrepancy,
which is good, but...

267
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,969
it's still their word against Frank's,
who was also shot in the head.

268
00:17:16,053 --> 00:17:17,054
Okay.

269
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:19,973
Just for a minute...

270
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:24,061
try... try to be Frank Castle.

271
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:26,772
To be solely fueled by...

272
00:17:26,855 --> 00:17:30,150
[laughs softly] by a
single cluster of seconds.

273
00:17:31,902 --> 00:17:34,738
One moment in... in your entire life...

274
00:17:38,033 --> 00:17:41,203
And every time you close your
eyes, you relive that moment.

275
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:45,248
And every time you open
them, you find only the...

276
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:50,253
the briefest peace before you realize
that that nightmare is real.

277
00:17:51,714 --> 00:17:53,631
That nothing has changed.

278
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:57,552
Your family isn't coming back.

279
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:00,973
And so you watch them die...

280
00:18:01,974 --> 00:18:04,267
all over again right in front of you.

281
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,480
We're not talking about something
that happened to Frank Castle,

282
00:18:08,563 --> 00:18:11,524
we're talking about something
that is happening to him.

283
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:16,196
I hear you.

284
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:18,866
But...

285
00:18:18,949 --> 00:18:22,160
short of having his
family's bodies exhumed...

286
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:26,957
we still have no proof that what
Frank is saying is the truth.

287
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:29,835
[inhales deeply]

288
00:18:29,918 --> 00:18:32,045
[sighing] Okay, so...

289
00:18:33,671 --> 00:18:36,925
Let's say the ME's report...
was doctored.

290
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:40,345
It's still tangential and,
so far, inadmissible.

291
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:44,808
What?

292
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:48,729
Unless we can get this ME to corroborate
Frank's story on the stand.

293
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:51,356
Can you do that?

294
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:55,152
It's a long shot. He's still
probably in her pocket, but...

295
00:18:56,153 --> 00:18:57,154
if it works...

296
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,740
maybe we expose Reyes

297
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:01,784
and we get the mistrial
you've been praying for.

298
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:05,829
[scoffs] So, trial
starts in a few hours,

299
00:19:05,913 --> 00:19:07,748
and in lieu of a bullet-damaged brain,

300
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:12,002
our case hinges on getting
a dirty medical examiner

301
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,420
to crack on the stand.

302
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:17,758
Guess I'll call Matt. Give him the news.

303
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:18,967
Oh, I'll do it.

304
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:22,304
As long as he has the opening
statement of the year, I'd...

305
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,682
[sighs] I think maybe we have a chance.

306
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:27,267
[train horn blows]

307
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:34,732
[Elektra] We should make bets on
what the Yakuza are exporting.

308
00:19:34,817 --> 00:19:37,402
Hundred bucks says exotic animals...

309
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:39,988
or counterfeit purses.

310
00:19:40,072 --> 00:19:42,407
[Daredevil] Last time these guys
brought something into town,

311
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,327
it was a cargo ship transporting a kid.

312
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:47,788
- [Elektra] Human trafficking?
- Yeah, something like that.

313
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,880
- [Elektra] Oh...
- Elektra.

314
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,342
All these cars are empty.
This one's full.

315
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:03,053
So are the others beyond it.

316
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,806
- Full of what?
- I don't know.

317
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:07,724
There's no negative space.

318
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:10,268
Cargo is uniform. There's no real shape.

319
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,645
There's a lot of it, though.

320
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:14,564
Enough to buckle the tracks.

321
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:18,276
You're right. This is ours.

322
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,445
Come on, let's go. Let's have a look.

323
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,792
- [Elektra exclaims]
- [Daredevil grunts]

324
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:42,675
- [Daredevil] Dirt.
- Do they know we're here?

325
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,845
Is this a decoy?

326
00:20:47,764 --> 00:20:48,891
[Daredevil] Wait.

327
00:20:50,225 --> 00:20:53,186
- [whispers] They're coming.
- [Elektra] Let's go.

328
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:40,483
[man 1 groans]

329
00:21:41,818 --> 00:21:42,819
[Daredevil grunts]

330
00:21:44,154 --> 00:21:45,572
[Elektra grunts]

331
00:22:00,503 --> 00:22:01,879
- [Elektra exclaims]
- [drawing knife]

332
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:03,006
[man groans]

333
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:06,884
[bone breaking]

334
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,821
[panting]

335
00:22:30,325 --> 00:22:32,202
- You okay?
- [breathing deeply]

336
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,705
The best things in life leave
you breathless, right?

337
00:22:36,373 --> 00:22:40,418
I'm glad you feel that way,
'cause I got something for ya.

338
00:22:43,505 --> 00:22:45,090
[men shouting in distance]

339
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:47,175
[laughs softly]

340
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,531
[grunting]

341
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:13,826
[rapid gunfire]

342
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:15,412
[men shouting indistinctly]

343
00:23:27,924 --> 00:23:29,926
- [gun clicking]
- It's your lucky day.

344
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:33,596
[Elektra] Ahh!

345
00:23:35,098 --> 00:23:36,641
[man grunting]

346
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,396
[grunting]

347
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,022
[blades swishing]

348
00:23:48,236 --> 00:23:50,613
[grunting]

349
00:23:50,697 --> 00:23:51,906
[bone breaking]

350
00:23:58,205 --> 00:23:59,997
[Daredevil grunting]

351
00:24:03,793 --> 00:24:06,463
[panting] What the
hell took you so long?

352
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:13,470
- You hurt?
- [groans]

353
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,476
- Let me see.
- [groans]

354
00:24:21,018 --> 00:24:22,104
Ow.

355
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:24,397
[water running]

356
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,318
[Elektra] Do you think
this one will scar?

357
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:30,320
[Matt] Don't they all?

358
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:34,157
I suppose I'll never
have short hair again.

359
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:37,327
Well, you could always tell people
you got it fighting the Yakuza.

360
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:40,622
No one would believe you anyway.

361
00:24:46,794 --> 00:24:48,921
- All right.
- Thank you.

362
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:54,969
- We make a good team, Matthew.
- [sighs]

363
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:58,431
Keep some pressure on it.

364
00:25:03,853 --> 00:25:05,480
What do you tell people?

365
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:07,690
About?

366
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,902
Where you got your scars?

367
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:17,200
[sniffs] Um...

368
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:19,286
Lucky me, I wear suits to work, so...

369
00:25:20,287 --> 00:25:21,496
rarely comes up.

370
00:25:22,705 --> 00:25:25,292
What do you tell the
women you bring home?

371
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,419
Well, they're enjoying
themselves too much.

372
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:29,504
- [laughing]
- They don't ask.

373
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:30,713
Sure.

374
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:35,510
Oh, hey.

375
00:25:36,428 --> 00:25:39,264
- You're bleeding.
- [Elektra] Oh.

376
00:25:43,685 --> 00:25:45,144
[Elektra sighs]

377
00:25:46,188 --> 00:25:49,482
- That okay?
- It takes a lot more to hurt me.

378
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,071
You, on the other hand...

379
00:26:05,957 --> 00:26:09,168
Oh... I haven't seen this one.

380
00:26:10,962 --> 00:26:13,172
Yeah, the Russians like their knives.

381
00:26:14,216 --> 00:26:16,092
At least, I think it was the Russians.

382
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:19,095
And these?

383
00:26:20,638 --> 00:26:21,889
The Yakuza.

384
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,143
Actually, a ninja named Nobu.

385
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:29,231
Nobu Yoshioka?

386
00:26:29,314 --> 00:26:30,940
What, you know him?

387
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:32,900
By reputation.

388
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:38,114
Yeah, this was him, too. That hurt.

389
00:26:39,156 --> 00:26:41,993
And the, uh, two on my back.

390
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,084
Wasn't there in college.

391
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:52,379
Most of them weren't.

392
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:55,590
You've been busy, huh?

393
00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:57,842
Seems we both have.

394
00:27:04,307 --> 00:27:05,517
[sighs]

395
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:10,813
Where did you go, Elektra?

396
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,443
The last time we were together...

397
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:17,320
[sighs]

398
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:22,867
As far from you as I could.

399
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:29,081
And... [sighs] did you find whatever...

400
00:27:30,124 --> 00:27:32,209
you were looking for?

401
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:37,006
Mostly I found that I was alone.

402
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,802
Then why didn't you come back?

403
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:45,097
[softly] Because you
don't know what I know.

404
00:27:48,476 --> 00:27:50,019
[sighs]

405
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,854
Because you deserve better.

406
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,732
[Matt scoffs]

407
00:27:57,444 --> 00:27:58,820
[exhales]

408
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:11,333
Lie down. Get some rest.

409
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:45,783
[groaning softly]

410
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:04,135
[Elektra breathing deeply]

411
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:09,098
[Matt breathes deeply]

412
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:34,416
I'm, uh... I'm really late.

413
00:29:34,499 --> 00:29:39,546
I... I will look into the exports,
see where they're coming from.

414
00:29:39,629 --> 00:29:41,548
Yeah. [Exhales sharply]

415
00:29:43,257 --> 00:29:45,885
Have a good day in court, Matthew.

416
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,638
[exhales]

417
00:29:50,139 --> 00:29:51,891
[indistinct chatter]

418
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,562
[Foggy sighs]

419
00:29:55,645 --> 00:29:56,896
Today, of all days...

420
00:29:57,939 --> 00:29:59,899
I mean, he said he'd be late,
but this is ridiculous.

421
00:29:59,982 --> 00:30:02,109
[whispers] Foggy, what
is going on with him?

422
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:06,197
[man] All rise. Court is now in session,

423
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,366
the Honorable Judge
Cynthia Batzer presiding.

424
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:16,332
Indictment number 1986-4447,
<i>The People v. Frank Castle.</i>

425
00:30:16,416 --> 00:30:17,875
[Batzer] Be seated.

426
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:23,506
Looks like you're a man down.

427
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,175
[Batzer] Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

428
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:29,095
the defendant has been indicted
for several serious crimes.

429
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:31,889
But I'm instructing you,
as a point of law...

430
00:30:31,973 --> 00:30:33,933
You know those college stress dreams,

431
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:36,060
when you show up to your
class in your underwear?

432
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:37,854
- Yeah?
- That's me right now.

433
00:30:38,855 --> 00:30:41,983
God damn, Matt was supposed
to deliver opening, not me.

434
00:30:42,066 --> 00:30:44,902
Ms. Reyes, are the People ready
to begin opening statements?

435
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:46,362
More than ready, Your Honor.

436
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:48,615
[Karen whispers] Should we be worried?

437
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:52,076
I mean, there's no way
Matt misses this, right?

438
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,839
[Reyes] Ladies and
gentlemen of the jury...

439
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:59,125
Frank Castle brutally tortured
and murdered 30 people.

440
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:02,378
Thirty that we know of.

441
00:31:03,755 --> 00:31:06,382
He took the law into his own hands.

442
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:12,138
Acted as judge, jury, and...
most violent executioner.

443
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:17,434
And you will hear that the defendant's
victims were criminals...

444
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,437
but the victims are not
on trial here today,

445
00:31:20,522 --> 00:31:24,066
and justice does not belong in the
hands of a man like Frank Castle.

446
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,360
This isn't the Wild West.

447
00:31:26,443 --> 00:31:30,657
Justice is served here...
in a court of law.

448
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,950
And it is up to each of you

449
00:31:33,034 --> 00:31:36,704
to take back the city from
lawless vigilantes...

450
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:38,831
like Frank Castle.

451
00:31:45,547 --> 00:31:47,549
This man is no hero.

452
00:31:49,551 --> 00:31:51,010
He's a serial killer.

453
00:31:52,469 --> 00:31:54,972
And he is guilty.

454
00:31:58,392 --> 00:31:59,519
Thank you.

455
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:05,858
[Batzer] Mr. Nelson, are you prepared
to make your opening statement?

456
00:32:05,942 --> 00:32:08,402
- She's good.
- So are you.

457
00:32:09,403 --> 00:32:10,780
[Batzer] Mr. Nelson?

458
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:16,911
Mr. Nelson, are you reserving the right
to make your statement at a later time?

459
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:23,167
[people murmuring indistinctly]

460
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,293
[Foggy sighs]

461
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:26,212
Screw it.

462
00:32:27,338 --> 00:32:29,173
Um... [clears throat]

463
00:32:29,256 --> 00:32:32,802
No, Your Honor, um... the
defense is ready to proceed.

464
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:40,517
Uh, ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

465
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:44,856
the defendant, Frank Castle, is not...

466
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:48,525
Sorry.

467
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,739
- [woman coughs]
- [Foggy clears throat] Um...

468
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:56,784
Mr. Castle is as much a victim...

469
00:32:59,704 --> 00:33:01,288
No, he's not.

470
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,709
[sighs]

471
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,298
Okay, so...

472
00:33:11,382 --> 00:33:14,761
you're 19... standing in hot sand...

473
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:17,179
sun burning down...

474
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:20,099
noise...

475
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:23,019
yelling, gunfire...

476
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,563
The only thing that you know for sure

477
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:29,316
is that you're surrounded by
an enemy that wants you dead.

478
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:33,738
But you do it. You endure it.

479
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:35,447
Why?

480
00:33:35,531 --> 00:33:38,701
Because you have orders.
And you have a duty.

481
00:33:40,077 --> 00:33:43,164
And also because your
life doesn't end here.

482
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:47,126
You have people you
love waiting at home.

483
00:33:48,044 --> 00:33:52,173
Because... aside from being
a decorated marine...

484
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:57,511
the man before you is a good
husband and an excellent father.

485
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:02,934
Frank Castle returned
from the hell of war

486
00:34:03,017 --> 00:34:05,561
wanting nothing more than
to pick up his life.

487
00:34:06,854 --> 00:34:11,400
But his wife... young son and daughter

488
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,945
were brutally murdered by criminals,

489
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:17,740
and no one, not the police and...
[snickers]

490
00:34:17,824 --> 00:34:21,744
certainly not the District Attorney
stepped up to make it right.

491
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:23,830
See, Frank Castle never came home.

492
00:34:23,913 --> 00:34:26,958
He just traded in one
war zone for another.

493
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:34,548
This trial isn't about vigilantes.

494
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:37,593
It's about the failure
of the justice system.

495
00:34:37,677 --> 00:34:40,888
And how one man, Frank Castle,
is being used as a pawn

496
00:34:40,972 --> 00:34:43,182
to cover up that system's mistakes.

497
00:34:43,265 --> 00:34:45,935
The prosecution wants blood. [chuckles]

498
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:48,187
But as the judge just said...

499
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:52,233
to get it, they have to prove their
case beyond a reasonable doubt.

500
00:34:53,275 --> 00:34:55,277
So all I'm asking of you today...

501
00:34:56,195 --> 00:34:57,780
keep an open mind.

502
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,368
That's all, Your Honor.

503
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:03,995
[indistinct murmuring]

504
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:09,416
That was a pretty thick slice
of bullshit there, counselor.

505
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,168
[Batzer] Prosecution,
call your first witness.

506
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:12,253
[Tower] Yes, Your Honor.

507
00:35:12,336 --> 00:35:14,255
- Sorry, guys.
- Where the hell have you been?

508
00:35:14,338 --> 00:35:16,257
Look, I made a mistake, Karen,
I feel terrible about it,

509
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,800
but, Foggy, I caught some
of your opening statement.

510
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,093
- You did great.
- [Karen] He was amazing.

511
00:35:19,176 --> 00:35:21,428
Hey, hey, thanks for
keeping us afloat, buddy.

512
00:35:22,471 --> 00:35:24,640
[sighs] Yeah, well...

513
00:35:24,724 --> 00:35:28,144
hopefully Reyes didn't notice
my buckets of flop sweat.

514
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,813
And if the DA's office didn't
suspect we had nothing before,

515
00:35:30,897 --> 00:35:31,898
they gotta be sure now.

516
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:33,149
Well, then we'll just
have to change that.

517
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:35,151
Yeah, who's on the prosecution's
witness list for tomorrow?

518
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:37,694
Uh... I've got it, here.

519
00:35:38,821 --> 00:35:39,989
[sighs]

520
00:35:41,532 --> 00:35:43,117
Tepper, wonderful.

521
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,787
Reyes is calling the
chief medical examiner.

522
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,371
From rocky start to Hail Mary.

523
00:35:47,454 --> 00:35:48,455
Why, what do we know about him?

524
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,833
I showed Frank a copy of his
family's autopsy report.

525
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,709
He claims they're faked, and
Tepper's name is all over them.

526
00:35:52,794 --> 00:35:53,795
Well, that's great. All right.

527
00:35:53,878 --> 00:35:55,712
- So we should get him on the record.
- That's what we said.

528
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:57,799
Which you would've known had you
shown up to the office at all.

529
00:35:57,882 --> 00:36:00,134
- Let me take lead on it, buddy.
- Like you took the lead this morning?

530
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:01,969
You've made your point, all right?
Let me try at least.

531
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:03,054
Let me get a crack at this guy.

532
00:36:03,137 --> 00:36:05,681
Even if we get the false
reports entered into evidence,

533
00:36:05,765 --> 00:36:08,642
and it's a big "if," since they
concern an unrelated crime,

534
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:11,395
odds are slim that this clown's
gonna incriminate himself.

535
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:14,273
Unless two brilliant attorneys can
figure out a way to trip him up.

536
00:36:14,356 --> 00:36:17,902
- Exactly.
- You want it? Knock yourself out.

537
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:21,989
But Tepper ain't talking without a fight.
The DA's pulling his strings.

538
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:24,909
And he's had plenty of time
to bulletproof his story.

539
00:36:24,992 --> 00:36:28,704
We only have 12 hours to tear it down. I
don't know how we do that by tomorrow.

540
00:36:28,788 --> 00:36:32,208
Because Karen's gonna catch me up,
and we're gonna figure out a way.

541
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,878
Fine, but I'm going back to the office,

542
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:38,380
'cause I have the rest of
the trial to prep for.

543
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,637
- You let him down, Matt.
- I know. Hey, I know.

544
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:47,441
- But I'm gonna make it up to him.
- [sighs]

545
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:48,753
And I'm gonna make it up to you.

546
00:36:49,558 --> 00:36:50,893
Come on.

547
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:52,728
[Matt] <i>You get Tepper thinking
about the real report.</i>

548
00:36:52,812 --> 00:36:54,271
- Mmm-hmm.
- The real truth.

549
00:36:54,355 --> 00:36:57,191
And then when he's disoriented, I
follow up with something like...

550
00:36:57,274 --> 00:36:59,110
"Who had you change the report?"

551
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:00,694
And even if he says "no
one," it proves...

552
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:02,196
It proves that the report was changed.

553
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:03,697
- And that's...
- That's brilliant.

554
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,158
- See? You're a natural.
- Huh.

555
00:37:06,242 --> 00:37:08,119
Well, I keep good company.

556
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:09,996
Ah, you know what?

557
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,248
Why don't I help you go through
Tepper's bread-crumb questions?

558
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:14,083
We could, you know, set
'em up, knock 'em down?

559
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,792
All right, but it'll be boring.

560
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:17,503
- [Karen giggles]
- And tedious.

561
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:20,422
- Could take all night.
- Hmm.

562
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:22,842
Well, I don't mind.

563
00:37:22,925 --> 00:37:25,011
- What?
- You ever consider law school?

564
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:27,889
[laughs] Oh, I don't know.

565
00:37:27,972 --> 00:37:30,349
Well, Foggy and I know a lot
of good people at Columbia.

566
00:37:31,642 --> 00:37:34,186
I mean, if it's even something you want.

567
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:39,275
Just thinking Nelson and Murdock
might be more fun as...

568
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,193
Nelson, Murdock and Page.

569
00:37:42,653 --> 00:37:45,948
[sighs] You're... you're sweet. Uh...

570
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:47,074
[inhales]

571
00:37:47,158 --> 00:37:50,536
I don't know. I don't know if law
school's really the right fit for me.

572
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:51,996
Um...

573
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,499
I guess there's just something
about the rules and the loopholes.

574
00:37:55,582 --> 00:37:59,003
It just feels like the truth
gets lost a little too often.

575
00:37:59,086 --> 00:38:01,286
Well, not every case will be
<i>The People v. Frank Castle.</i>

576
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:02,423
Right, right.

577
00:38:02,506 --> 00:38:05,717
But, you know, it's not
just this case. It's...

578
00:38:06,928 --> 00:38:09,846
[laughs] Uh...

579
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:13,142
What is it?

580
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:17,438
You know, we...

581
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:21,483
You ever...

582
00:38:22,526 --> 00:38:24,653
think back to the night we first met?

583
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:28,449
Yeah, all the time.

584
00:38:31,535 --> 00:38:34,455
While I sat in that police station...

585
00:38:34,538 --> 00:38:35,706
alone.

586
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,335
I was afraid of the whole world.

587
00:38:41,878 --> 00:38:43,339
Well, at least, until...

588
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,342
you and Foggy came into my life and...
[chuckles]

589
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:50,304
You trusted me. You gave me hope.

590
00:38:53,307 --> 00:38:56,936
And then we came back to your place.

591
00:38:57,019 --> 00:38:59,438
- I offered you Thai food.
- [Karen laughs]

592
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:01,690
God...

593
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,361
I remember everything about
that night, 'cause it's...

594
00:39:06,362 --> 00:39:08,489
not every day your life is threatened...

595
00:39:09,698 --> 00:39:11,993
then saved by a man in black.

596
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:16,872
[chuckles] Hey, you...

597
00:39:17,748 --> 00:39:20,042
You believe in what he does?

598
00:39:20,126 --> 00:39:23,379
- You know, the Devil of Hell's Kitchen.
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. Um...

599
00:39:26,132 --> 00:39:27,591
[smacks lips]

600
00:39:27,674 --> 00:39:29,010
I, uh... [sighs]

601
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:30,094
[laughs]

602
00:39:31,262 --> 00:39:34,473
- What?
- [stammers] I... believe in the law.

603
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:39,103
- If that's what you're asking.
- Right. No, but... but...

604
00:39:39,186 --> 00:39:41,022
But what about when the law fails?

605
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:42,856
Like it did with me,
like it did with Frank.

606
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:45,026
You know, what are we supposed
to turn to? What should we...

607
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:47,611
What should we believe
will protect us then?

608
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:54,035
- See, you're asking a Catholic lawyer.
- [both chuckling]

609
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:55,827
- [softly] I, uh... Yes.
- What do you...

610
00:39:55,911 --> 00:39:58,580
- What do you want me to say?
- [laughs] I don't know.

611
00:39:59,999 --> 00:40:01,542
Uh, I guess it's just...

612
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:04,378
ever since we took on
Frank's case, like...

613
00:40:04,461 --> 00:40:05,462
I keep...

614
00:40:06,463 --> 00:40:10,009
I keep asking myself if there's
really a difference between...

615
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:13,804
between someone who saves lives and...

616
00:40:13,887 --> 00:40:17,308
someone who prevents lives from
needing to be saved at all.

617
00:40:17,391 --> 00:40:18,434
Right?

618
00:40:20,477 --> 00:40:21,562
Wait... Wait a second.

619
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:25,232
Frank Castle should be behind bars.
[chuckles]

620
00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:27,776
I mean, he deserves a fair
trial, but he's murdered people.

621
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,320
Yeah, right. Bad people.

622
00:40:29,403 --> 00:40:30,821
I mean, like the ones
who killed his family

623
00:40:30,904 --> 00:40:31,905
or the ones who came after me.

624
00:40:31,988 --> 00:40:34,283
But it's not Frank's
decision who lives or dies.

625
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:36,452
That's up to God...

626
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,246
or sometimes a jury.

627
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,165
What happened to Frank's
family is a tragedy, Karen,

628
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:42,666
but it doesn't give him
the right to kill...

629
00:40:42,749 --> 00:40:44,751
No. No, no, no. God... God, no!
Not the right, that's...

630
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:46,503
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm just saying that...

631
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:48,130
I can understand why Frank... why...

632
00:40:48,214 --> 00:40:49,923
why anyone would seek vengeance
for something after...

633
00:40:50,006 --> 00:40:51,566
- after losing it...
- Whoa, no, no, no.

634
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:53,719
That's not the same.
Vengeance is not justice.

635
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:55,387
What he's doing is completely wrong.

636
00:40:55,471 --> 00:40:57,431
But, right or wrong, you
can't deny that it works.

637
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,017
[inhales]

638
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:02,311
You really believe that?

639
00:41:02,394 --> 00:41:04,063
I don't know. No.

640
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:07,108
[sighs]

641
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:11,027
[stammering] Maybe.

642
00:41:16,658 --> 00:41:17,868
[clears throat]

643
00:41:19,703 --> 00:41:21,372
- Um...
- No, um...

644
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:23,957
You know, maybe this is a
good time to call it a night.

645
00:41:25,126 --> 00:41:27,544
I just think we're both exhausted, and...
[stammering]

646
00:41:27,628 --> 00:41:29,505
You know, a case this
big, let's just...

647
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,155
Um...

648
00:41:30,214 --> 00:41:31,590
Yes, you're probably right.

649
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:37,096
I don't know, maybe, uh, after...
after the trial's over.

650
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:39,515
- Yeah, a real date next time.
- [laughs] Good.

651
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:43,644
Thanks.

652
00:41:55,071 --> 00:41:57,073
- Uh, good night.
- Good night, Karen.

653
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:00,744
Get some rest.

654
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,428
- How long were you listening?
- I wasn't listening.

655
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:19,138
I didn't hear anything about your work

656
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:22,599
that would make me want to tie a
noose and test it on my neck.

657
00:42:22,683 --> 00:42:25,186
I won't even mention what I didn't
hear about your girlfriend.

658
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:28,439
- I warned you not to interrupt my life.
- This is not your life, Matthew.

659
00:42:28,522 --> 00:42:30,732
You may not give a damn about
what I've made for myself,

660
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:32,609
but that is what's most important to me.

661
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:35,904
All right? She... is important to me.

662
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:37,864
Right.

663
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,075
Sorry.

664
00:42:41,702 --> 00:42:45,331
I didn't know your time pairing wine
with Thai food was so important.

665
00:42:45,414 --> 00:42:47,208
- [tap running]
- What do you want?

666
00:42:47,291 --> 00:42:51,086
I looked more carefully at
Roxxon's construction investment.

667
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,797
Seems there's only a small
number of projects in New York

668
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,049
capable of moving that much dirt.

669
00:42:56,132 --> 00:42:59,345
We pay the sites a visit, I bet
we find out what they're hiding.

670
00:43:00,262 --> 00:43:02,639
- What are these sites?
- Um...

671
00:43:02,723 --> 00:43:06,310
The Conservatory Hotel, the
Midtown Tunnel project,

672
00:43:06,393 --> 00:43:08,812
and some big build
site at 44th and 11th.

673
00:43:08,895 --> 00:43:10,897
44th and 11th.

674
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:12,524
- You know it?
- Yeah, Midland Circle.

675
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:14,651
There was a tenement on that block

676
00:43:14,735 --> 00:43:18,239
before Wilson Fisk swallowed it up
in his Better Tomorrow initiative.

677
00:43:18,322 --> 00:43:20,907
- How did the Japanese get hold of it?
- I don't know.

678
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:24,370
But before I fought Nobu, I found
blueprints at Midland Circle.

679
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:29,165
Now, I always thought Nobu was just
a weapon Fisk sent to take me out,

680
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,502
that Fisk had interests
tied up in the building,

681
00:43:31,585 --> 00:43:33,003
but maybe he didn't want it at all.

682
00:43:33,086 --> 00:43:36,215
I mean, what if he only acquired
Midland Circle for the Japanese?

683
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:38,133
That's a curious riddle,

684
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:39,968
one I think we should
go and solve together.

685
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,262
Elektra, I got court in the morning.

686
00:43:41,345 --> 00:43:43,972
- I got a case to prepare, I got...
- Tomorrow night, then.

687
00:43:48,143 --> 00:43:49,770
Cheap wine.

688
00:43:49,853 --> 00:43:52,356
Finish your homework.
I'll do some recon.

689
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:58,320
[Tower] And so, Dr. Tepper,
the medical examiner's office

690
00:43:58,404 --> 00:44:01,865
can confirm that the 15 victims
found at the Irish Social Club

691
00:44:01,948 --> 00:44:03,534
all died of multiple gunshot wounds.

692
00:44:03,617 --> 00:44:05,661
[Tepper] Yes, that's correct.

693
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:11,166
Um, all 15 victims died of wounds
inflicted by the same caliber bullet...

694
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,669
each shot multiple times.

695
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:15,462
Thank you.

696
00:44:16,463 --> 00:44:17,506
Your witness.

697
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:26,014
- Cross your fingers. [Exhales]
- I'm crossing everything.

698
00:44:30,477 --> 00:44:32,062
[heart beating faintly]

699
00:44:37,276 --> 00:44:38,985
Dr. Gregory Tepper,

700
00:44:39,069 --> 00:44:41,655
how long have you been medical
examiner for the city of New York?

701
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:44,115
Uh, 14 years, uh, give or take.

702
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:47,077
And how many death certificates would you
estimate you've signed in that time?

703
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,161
Huh?

704
00:44:49,287 --> 00:44:51,748
[stammers] Um, I don't, uh...

705
00:44:51,832 --> 00:44:52,958
It's probably in the tens of thousands.

706
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:55,168
Objection, Your Honor,
leading the witness...

707
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:57,629
- I'm not sure where.
- [Batzer] Mr. Murdock...

708
00:44:57,713 --> 00:44:59,423
I have something I need to say.

709
00:45:00,173 --> 00:45:02,551
- Doctor?
- Your Honor, I'm sorry, but...

710
00:45:02,634 --> 00:45:04,386
I have to, on the record...

711
00:45:05,554 --> 00:45:07,639
I need to say something
about what I did.

712
00:45:07,723 --> 00:45:09,933
[all murmuring]

713
00:45:10,016 --> 00:45:12,436
- Clear the gallery.
- [officer] Yes, Your Honor.

714
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:16,314
All jury members, please exit
back to the deliberation room.

715
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,442
Everyone in the gallery,

716
00:45:18,525 --> 00:45:21,695
please make your way out of
the courtroom at this time.

717
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:28,190
[Batzer] What's all this about?

718
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:30,537
I...

719
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:34,708
I know what the defense was gonna
ask me about, and it's true.

720
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:36,668
I altered the autopsy reports.

721
00:45:36,752 --> 00:45:38,545
Uh, you're referring to
the official findings

722
00:45:38,629 --> 00:45:40,229
on the murders of Frank Castle's family?

723
00:45:40,255 --> 00:45:42,173
Not just them.

724
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:44,342
You don't understand. I had to do it.

725
00:45:44,426 --> 00:45:48,472
- Those animals came to my office.
- Who came to your office?

726
00:45:49,055 --> 00:45:51,055
[Tepper] After the defendant's
family was murdered,

727
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:53,018
two men I'd never seen before...

728
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:56,187
they warned me, if I didn't
fix the case reports,

729
00:45:56,271 --> 00:45:58,690
they'd come after my family next.

730
00:45:58,774 --> 00:46:02,360
[Batzer] You falsified the autopsy
findings on the Castle family?

731
00:46:03,028 --> 00:46:04,905
Them and one more.

732
00:46:04,988 --> 00:46:06,823
- Who?
- [Tepper] I don't know.

733
00:46:06,907 --> 00:46:08,909
Some John Doe killed the same day.

734
00:46:08,992 --> 00:46:11,286
Male, adult, multiple gunshot wounds.

735
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:14,623
Look, you can fire me, arrest me...
I don't care.

736
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:18,209
I thought this was behind
me, but after last night...

737
00:46:18,293 --> 00:46:20,712
Doctor, did something happen last
night to impact your testimony?

738
00:46:20,796 --> 00:46:23,131
[Tepper] She was in my house.

739
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:24,466
She tied me up.

740
00:46:25,592 --> 00:46:29,054
She said she didn't give a
damn who got to me before.

741
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:31,765
If I didn't tell the defense
what really happened,

742
00:46:31,848 --> 00:46:33,434
she'd hunt me down and kill me.

743
00:46:33,517 --> 00:46:35,519
- Who told you this?
- I don't know.

744
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:37,479
A woman.

745
00:46:37,563 --> 00:46:40,524
Her face was covered. Had
some foreign accent.

746
00:46:40,607 --> 00:46:43,485
Your Honor, I believe the defense
intends to distract the jury

747
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:47,072
and make this case about some
impossible-to-prove conspiracy theories...

748
00:46:47,155 --> 00:46:48,156
[Matt] Impossible to prove?

749
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:50,451
Your ME just confirmed that he
doctored the autopsy records.

750
00:46:50,534 --> 00:46:52,285
He also said that he'd been threatened.

751
00:46:52,368 --> 00:46:55,371
If my office finds out that your
firm had anything to do with this...

752
00:46:55,456 --> 00:46:58,459
Our firm? For all we know, it
was you who sent those goons.

753
00:46:58,542 --> 00:46:59,668
[Batzer] I've heard enough.

754
00:46:59,751 --> 00:47:03,505
It's clear to me that whatever Dr. Tepper
may know about these autopsy reports

755
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:05,006
has been tainted

756
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,218
by threats made by person
or persons unknown.

757
00:47:08,301 --> 00:47:09,928
Then the defense asks for a mistrial.

758
00:47:10,011 --> 00:47:13,139
Not on your life, Mr. Nelson. I'm
still not convinced these documents,

759
00:47:13,223 --> 00:47:15,809
whatever they may be, are
even relevant to this trial.

760
00:47:15,892 --> 00:47:18,937
I'm striking the doctor's
entire testimony

761
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,857
and instructing the jurors to disregard
anything they may have heard.

762
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,568
- Your Honor, I strongly urge you to...
- We're done here, counselor.

763
00:47:24,651 --> 00:47:27,738
Trial will reconvene tomorrow with
the prosecution's next witness.

764
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:29,573
[bangs gavel]

765
00:47:29,656 --> 00:47:31,366
Once again, Reyes finds
a new way to screw us.

766
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:33,769
You'd think it'd get easier,
but somehow it's more painful.

767
00:47:33,827 --> 00:47:36,538
Foggy. Foggy... it wasn't Reyes.

768
00:47:37,539 --> 00:47:40,000
- What?
- The woman who threatened Tepper.

769
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,627
[exhales deeply]

770
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,878
It was Elektra.

771
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,172
From college.

772
00:47:46,256 --> 00:47:48,424
- Elektra?
- Yeah, she's back in town.

773
00:47:49,801 --> 00:47:51,386
- Your ex-girlfriend?
- Yes.

774
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,222
[chuckles] No. This is insane.

775
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:57,559
She's a diplomat's daughter, a...
a debutante.

776
00:47:57,643 --> 00:48:00,061
Not anymore. She's, uh...

777
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:03,690
She's... she's different. She's...
she's dangerous.

778
00:48:03,774 --> 00:48:06,234
Yeah, no shit. She
nearly got you expelled.

779
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:09,571
I mean, she screwed your semester
of torts, civil procedure...

780
00:48:09,655 --> 00:48:12,365
You almost missed the final
because she hurt you so bad.

781
00:48:12,448 --> 00:48:13,491
And now, what?

782
00:48:13,575 --> 00:48:15,994
- She's... breaking into an ME's house?
- Okay.

783
00:48:16,077 --> 00:48:17,871
[stammering] So, the Yakuza
didn't go away, all right?

784
00:48:17,954 --> 00:48:18,997
They're still here in Hell's Kitchen.

785
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,457
Elektra is trying to help me
stop them, infiltrating...

786
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:22,918
What are you even talking about?

787
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:24,753
She was going up against
them by herself, and she...

788
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:27,255
- Your ex-girlfriend?
- Yeah, I'm trying to protect the city...

789
00:48:27,338 --> 00:48:31,384
I knew she was crazy, I didn't
know that she was homicidal.

790
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:33,344
[sighing] She's, um...

791
00:48:34,638 --> 00:48:36,097
my new client.

792
00:48:37,432 --> 00:48:39,976
Foggy, the, uh... rich one.

793
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,311
The private one.

794
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:46,149
- You lied again.
- I did, I lied,

795
00:48:46,232 --> 00:48:47,984
but, look, the Yakuza are
funneling money into something

796
00:48:48,068 --> 00:48:49,611
even bigger and darker
than before, all right?

797
00:48:49,695 --> 00:48:51,237
Elektra came to me, I'm
trying to help her...

798
00:48:51,321 --> 00:48:53,907
[yelling] You wanted to take this trial!

799
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:56,326
[stammering] You missed
strategy sessions...

800
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:59,871
witness prep, opening statements,
and you criminally decimate...

801
00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:00,956
No, I didn't. She...

802
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,874
I never told her anything
about the trial, all right?

803
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:05,711
The one witness that could've
helped us do what I wanted to do,

804
00:49:05,794 --> 00:49:06,795
which is take down Reyes!

805
00:49:06,878 --> 00:49:09,422
She must've overheard me talking to
Karen, and then she moved on her own.

806
00:49:09,505 --> 00:49:11,049
I would... I didn't
sanction, I would never...

807
00:49:11,132 --> 00:49:13,844
- I don't care! I don't care, Matt!
- I'm furious with her! [Grunts angrily]

808
00:49:13,927 --> 00:49:16,137
Stop acting like these
things just happen to you!

809
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:18,932
No one's making you go out all hours
of the night fighting bad guys

810
00:49:19,015 --> 00:49:23,019
and nobody makes you lie to your
friends, over and over again!

811
00:49:24,605 --> 00:49:26,940
Elektra is not the problem, Matt.

812
00:49:29,693 --> 00:49:30,777
[softly] You are.

813
00:49:33,614 --> 00:49:34,698
It's almost dark.

814
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:36,992
- I'm sure there's someplace you gotta be...
- You're not walking away.

815
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:38,785
- No, 'cause you know what?
- Don't walk away from me, Foggy.

816
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:42,538
If the last few days are any indication,
you sure as hell haven't been here!

817
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,712
Going forward, I will count
on you for nothing at all.

818
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:55,260
Tell your girlfriend to
stay away from my trial.

819
00:49:55,343 --> 00:49:57,183
Yeah, she's not... Elektra's
not my girlfriend.

820
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,514
Then you should be the one
to tell Karen about her.

821
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:04,602
Hey.

822
00:50:04,686 --> 00:50:07,648
- Hey, I heard yelling.
- Yeah, you should talk to Matt about it.

823
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:08,732
- Foggy!
- [door slams]

824
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:09,816
[elevator door dings]

825
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:12,986
- Hey, what the hell happened in there?
- We're fine.

826
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:15,155
No, no, no, you don't treat me
like I'm just your secretary.

827
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:16,489
I've done more work on
this case than you have!

828
00:50:16,572 --> 00:50:19,409
- I can't get into this right now, Karen.
- No, enough of the dodgy bullshit.

829
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:21,036
I deserve to know what is
going on with you two.

830
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,120
With you.

831
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:25,581
You asking as my co-worker?

832
00:50:25,666 --> 00:50:28,501
- Or my girlfriend?
- [sighs]

833
00:50:29,419 --> 00:50:31,171
- Both.
- Yeah.

834
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:32,630
I am sorry you're caught
in the middle of this,

835
00:50:32,714 --> 00:50:34,549
- but right now, I have to go.
- [scoffs]

836
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,260
- Where?
- I'll see you tomorrow, Karen.

837
00:50:40,055 --> 00:50:42,140
Yeah, maybe.

838
00:50:52,776 --> 00:50:54,569
[men speaking indistinctly]

839
00:50:58,114 --> 00:51:02,243
[exclaims] What the hell did you do?
I told you to stay out of my life.

840
00:51:02,327 --> 00:51:04,370
I never asked you to coerce a witness!

841
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:06,622
- You had a problem, so I stepped in.
- No! It doesn't help.

842
00:51:06,707 --> 00:51:09,334
We can't even use his testimony because
of you. It was all thrown out.

843
00:51:09,417 --> 00:51:11,294
I was only following your rules.

844
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:14,965
- What rules?
- You don't get what you want by day.

845
00:51:15,048 --> 00:51:17,968
[panting] You take it by force at night.

846
00:51:18,051 --> 00:51:20,095
This is who you are, Matthew.

847
00:51:21,429 --> 00:51:24,182
And don't fool yourself into
thinking it's anything else.

848
00:51:24,265 --> 00:51:26,309
- [gasps]
- What I do...

849
00:51:26,392 --> 00:51:28,019
is none of your business.

850
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:32,190
- Both halves of my life are mine.
- Fine.

851
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:36,194
I'll stay out of your boring legal shit.

852
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:39,990
Now, you wanna fight me?

853
00:51:40,073 --> 00:51:42,993
Or you wanna fight the guys who
are tearing your city apart?

854
00:51:56,798 --> 00:51:58,216
[both grunting]

855
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:22,657
[grunting]

856
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:42,803
[weapon clatters]

857
00:52:52,728 --> 00:52:55,773
- You didn't wanna help?
- You didn't want me to.

858
00:52:58,276 --> 00:52:59,277
Ready?

859
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:08,119
[Elektra grunts]

860
00:53:09,955 --> 00:53:11,122
You hear something?

861
00:53:12,999 --> 00:53:15,668
- [Daredevil] We're alone.
- [Elektra sighs]

862
00:53:39,484 --> 00:53:42,737
It's empty. There's nothing in here.

863
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,449
- The Yakuza were guarding something.
- [softly] Yeah, but...

864
00:53:53,706 --> 00:53:54,707
Shh!

865
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,878
- [whispers] Elektra.
- [whispers] What?

866
00:54:00,964 --> 00:54:02,604
[Daredevil] You're not
gonna believe this.

867
00:54:17,063 --> 00:54:18,148
Holy shit.

868
00:54:22,402 --> 00:54:25,196
[Elektra] Why are the
Yakuza digging a hole?

869
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,159
Give me the flashlight.

870
00:54:40,628 --> 00:54:43,965
- Did it hit the bottom?
- No.

871
00:54:45,133 --> 00:54:47,302
[sighs] Tell me when it does.

872
00:54:52,515 --> 00:54:54,225
[dramatic music playing]
