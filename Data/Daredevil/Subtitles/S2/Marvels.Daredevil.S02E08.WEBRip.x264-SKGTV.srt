00:00:22,646 --> 00:00:24,022
It just hit.

3
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:28,401
It's gotta be 40 stories, at least.

00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:31,547
- [shuriken whistling]
- [Elektra] Down!

5
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:37,369
They're on all sides.
Half a dozen, at least.

6
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:39,246
- I got a problem.
- Right with you.

7
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,997
No, you don't get it. I can't
get a read on these guys.

8
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:42,666
There's no sound, there's
no heartbeat, there's nothing.

9
00:00:42,749 --> 00:00:44,501
- They're trained to hide themselves.
- How do you know?

10
00:00:44,585 --> 00:00:46,587
Don't focus on the
fighters, track their weapons.

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,671
- They have swords.
- They have swords, I can hear.

She's losing too much blood.

32
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,854
[Stick] Hell of a scrape.

33
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,313
Where are you taking her?

34
00:03:53,649 --> 00:03:55,651
They're still coming. Fast little shits.

35
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:59,237

41
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:46,159
No, no, no. No, she's dying.

42
00:04:46,242 --> 00:04:48,453
- Stick, she's dying.
- [Stick] Not if I can stop it.

43
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:49,704
We need to get her to a hospital.

44
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:52,374
Doctors can't help her. I can.

45
00:04:52,457 --> 00:04:54,459
We're going to your
place. It's her only shot.

Sweetie, stay with me. Stay with me.

47
00:04:57,628 --> 00:04:59,172

There'll be more.

Always more.

- [Elektra groaning]

56
00:05:39,045 --> 00:05:40,714
[Stick] You got baking soda?

[Matt] Yeah, in the fridge, why?

58
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,593
[Stick] To neutralize the
acid in the toilet bowl cleaner.

59

Is she gonna live?

No, you're not gonna die. You hear me?

00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:49,866
Elektra, look at me.

81
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,243
- Hey, hey, focus on me.
- [breathing heavily]

82
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,495
Breathe. Breathe.

00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,164
That's good. That's good.

84
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:57,582
[whispering] I'm sorry.

85
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:59,918
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

86
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,169
[Stick] Bring her in here!

87
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:02,503
Yeah.

00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,277
[Matt] Can you save her?

94
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:28,196
Not before I make her worse.

- Those blades were poisoned.
- [Elektra screaming]

98
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:34,911
She'll be dead in 20 minutes

99
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:37,705
if I don't pull some
serious juju out of my ass.

100
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:39,582
Make the goddamn tea!

101
00:07:39,665 --> 00:07:41,126
[Elektra gasping]

102
00:07:43,128 --> 00:07:44,587
[Stick] Easy.

Easy. Easy, young lady. I'm right here.

[Elektra gasping]

[whispering indistinctly]

108
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:08,958
forgive those who trespass against us.

109
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:12,782
[Stick] Matty, use
that hearing of yours.

110
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,576
How's her heart rate?

111
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,328
[rhythmic beating]

112
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:23,126
Yeah. Yeah, it's good. It's steady.

113
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,210

114
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:26,462
Sheets.

115
00:08:33,803 --> 00:08:35,555
Not too neat...

116
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:38,641
but...

117
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:40,435
it'll do.

118
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:41,602
Tea?

119
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,860
[sighs deeply] Thank you.

120
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:52,906
[Stick] Ah...

[Elektra groans weakly]

122
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,314
She'll recover?

123
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:28,858
Twenty-four hours will tell.

124
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:31,777
I've known her to pull through worse.

125
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:35,156
What'd you just say?

126
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,409
Ellie's a real fighter. Always has been.

127
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:42,247
You... You know her?

128
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,911
I didn't mention that?

129
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,377
What the hell's going
on? How do you know Elektra?

130
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,462
- I'm not done in there.
- I want some answers!

131
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:50,630
Everybody wants something.

132
00:09:50,713 --> 00:09:53,841
- Do you want me to throw you out?
- Not unless you want her to die.

133
00:10:01,307 --> 00:10:02,893
Sit down, Matty.

134
00:10:05,478 --> 00:10:06,646
[Karen] Where is he?

135
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:10,984
Um, I may have told him
just to stay home today.

136
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,527
You what?

137
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,320
He wasn't actually supposed to do it.

138
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:17,157
Whoa, whoa, Foggy, what
the hell happened yesterday?

139
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,574
I can't do this alone.

140
00:10:18,658 --> 00:10:20,285
I didn't even wanna take this case.

141
00:10:20,368 --> 00:10:23,454
- It'll be okay, I...
- The whole city is watching.

142
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:24,830
If I screw up, I'd never work again.

143
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:27,667
And, frankly, you'd probably never
work again, either, by association, which...

144
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,545
Stop, Foggy. Stop thinking about
screwing up, about losing.

145
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:32,004
You need to think about winning.

146
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:36,717
[Schoonover] Colonel Ray
Schoonover, United States Marine Corps.

147
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:38,428
Do you swear to tell the truth,

148
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:41,681
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

149
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:43,349
I do.

150
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,688
- You got this.
- [sighs]

151
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:50,356
[Batzer] Counsel?

152
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,533
Colonel, how long have
you known the defendant?

153
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,952
I'd say, the better part of a decade.

154
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,704
Most of his career in the Marine Corps.

155
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:07,582
So you're familiar with his
service in the Middle East?

156
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:09,417
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran?

157
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,544
Yes, very familiar.

158
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,879
[Foggy] I wonder if you could tell us

159
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:16,799
how Lieutenant Frank
Castle won the Navy Cross?

160
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:20,220
Due to the nature of that
mission, you'll have to understand that

161
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:22,472
the precise circumstances
are classified.

162
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,477
Um...

163
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,689
How about the part that's not?

164
00:11:32,565 --> 00:11:35,025
Lieutenant Frank Castle
was part of a small team.

165
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,195
He was conducting a close
target reconnaissance

166
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:39,322
in the vicinity of the Hindu Kush.

167
00:11:39,405 --> 00:11:43,576
The mission became compromised, taking
enemy contact on three sides.

168
00:11:45,536 --> 00:11:47,955
Lieutenant Castle wanted to abort.

169
00:11:48,038 --> 00:11:51,959
Said the mission was a bust, pulling
the plug would save lives.

170
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,879
- Officer in charge said "no."
- [Foggy] And why was that?

171
00:11:54,962 --> 00:11:57,082
[Schoonover] Maybe he
wanted more medals on his chest.

172
00:11:57,132 --> 00:11:59,300
Doesn't matter. Either
way, Frank was right.

173
00:11:59,384 --> 00:12:02,762
They were cut off, boxed into a canyon.

174
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:04,805
[Foggy] And what happened next?

175
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:07,683
Within the first hour, the
officer in charge of that mission

176
00:12:07,767 --> 00:12:09,727
got his arm blown off.

177
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,062
So Lieutenant Castle assumed command.

178
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:15,191
His only goal was to
get his men out alive.

179
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:18,403
The enemy had set up an ambush

180
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:21,822
at the only LZ that would
accommodate one of our birds.

181
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:22,907
Sorry, Colonel?

182
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,328
LZ is a landing zone that
can accommodate a helicopter.

183
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:31,166
So the enemy, they
block this landing zone,

184
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:34,669
knowing it was the only shot
the team had to get out alive.

185
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,587
All they had to do was wait.

186
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:38,798
They knew that Frank's
team had to come to them.

187
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:39,924
Fish in a barrel.

188
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:41,259
So to speak.

189
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,303
Only fish don't know they're gonna die.

190
00:12:43,386 --> 00:12:45,763
These men did.

191
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:51,519
Frank went to the LZ all by
himself to draw the bastards away.

192
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:53,643
[Foggy] Why didn't he
order one of his men to do it?

193
00:12:53,646 --> 00:12:54,647
He certainly could have.

194
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:56,649
Not his style.

195
00:12:59,026 --> 00:13:02,655
So the men hear the fire fight
break out. All hell breaks loose.

196
00:13:02,738 --> 00:13:04,740
Frank against God knows how many.

197
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:06,992
And then there was silence.

198
00:13:07,076 --> 00:13:11,372
The team thinks, "That's it.
Frank's dead, and we're next."

199
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,752
Next sound they hear is
the helos, the helicopters.

200
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:19,672
They get to the landing
zone, you know what they see?

201
00:13:20,798 --> 00:13:23,259
Frank Castle, standing there, grinning.

202
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:26,971
Thirty-two muj surrounding him, all dead.

203
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:30,516
Son of a gun cleared that
entire LZ all by himself.

204
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:32,352
[Foggy] How?

205
00:13:33,143 --> 00:13:35,355
By being Frank Castle.

206
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,357
- And his men survived?
- All of 'em.

207
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,318
Including the idiot officer that
got 'em trapped in the first place.

208
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:43,571
If you had to sum up Frank
Castle, how would you do it?

209
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,573
I would say Frank Castle is a man

210
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:48,909
who would gladly give his
life to keep others safe.

211
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,120
[Foggy] And the
crimes he's accused of today?

212
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:52,997
Could the man you
knew have committed them?

213
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,624
Absolutely not.

214
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,587
Lieutenant Frank
Castle that I know is a hero.

215
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,506
A man who deserves our respect...

216
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,049
and our gratitude.

217
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,011
Not the same man.

218
00:14:07,928 --> 00:14:10,515
Thank you, sir. No more
questions, Your Honor.

219
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,893
People?

220
00:14:22,026 --> 00:14:26,113
I'd like to personally thank you for
your service to this country, Colonel.

221
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:28,616
My father served in Vietnam.

222
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:31,494
- Do you know what he told me about medals?
- No, ma'am.

223
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:34,580
He said the only people who
truly know what happened

224
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:35,956
are the ones that were there.

225
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:38,876
You told a nice story, Colonel...

226
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,506
but how can we know that it
happened the way you described?

227
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,134
Well, perhaps I wasn't
clear. I was there, ma'am.

228
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:51,514
That officer that didn't listen
to Frank, got his men trapped...

229
00:14:52,097 --> 00:14:53,175
you're looking at him.

230
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:54,768
- [indistinct chatter]
- And believe me when I tell you,

231
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:58,270
I thank God every day that
I only lost my arm.

232
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:02,400
That man saved my life, the
lives of his entire team.

233
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:04,902
If it was up to me,

234
00:15:04,985 --> 00:15:07,613
he'd have a Medal of
Honor hanging around his neck.

235
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:09,740
[sighs]

236
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:12,618
No further questions at
this time, Your Honor.

237
00:15:15,288 --> 00:15:16,706
How'd you miss that in his file?

238
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:18,123
All the names were redacted.

239
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:19,249
Not good.

240
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:20,751
No shit.

241
00:15:20,835 --> 00:15:23,421
Hey, Matt couldn't have done it better.

242
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:25,340
It was good.

243
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,182
[Matt] How is she?

244
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:38,268
Well... she'll live.

245
00:15:39,395 --> 00:15:40,730
Yeah? You sure?

246
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:42,482
Sure as I am of anything.

247
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:44,108
[both grunting]

248
00:15:44,191 --> 00:15:45,776
- [breathing heavily]
- [Stick groaning]

249
00:15:48,571 --> 00:15:50,615
Jesus, didn't we do this already?

250
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:51,991
Start talking, Stick.

251
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:53,951
It's about the war.

252
00:15:54,034 --> 00:15:55,661
What is?

253
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:57,037
All of it.

254
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:01,083
Roxxon, Midland
Circle, the damn hole, Elektra...

255
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:04,128
All right, you've been using this
war as an excuse since the day I met you,

256
00:16:04,211 --> 00:16:06,714
and you still haven't told
me a goddamn thing about it.

257
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,383
- You know what I think?
- Tell me.

258
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,217
I think you're full of shit.

259
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,886
I don't think there is any war.

260
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:15,305
I think you're just a sick old
fighter dying to hit people,

261
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,823
so you make up stories to
justify your behavior.

262
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:18,949
[Stick sighs]

263
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:21,938
And then, you rope in the wounded...

264
00:16:22,021 --> 00:16:24,982
so that you can sit back and
watch them throw away their lives,

265
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,442
and you can feel important.

266
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:27,693
Sit down.

267
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,906
Sit down, Matty.

268
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:40,456
It all began centuries ago.

269
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,041
Nobody knows how many,

270
00:16:42,124 --> 00:16:43,876
but the shit we're dipping into...

271
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:46,170
is ancient.

272
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:52,301
Back then, warlords and their
gangs ruled the countryside.

273
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:54,720
Not that much different from today.

274
00:16:55,638 --> 00:17:01,519
Bloodthirsty, greedy brutes after
loot, pussy, booze, same ol', same ol'.

275
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,939
But... one day,

276
00:17:05,022 --> 00:17:08,108
one of these collections of assholes

277
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:11,987
comes across a thing they
can barely understand.

278
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:14,239
Real treasure.

279
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:16,992
Not gold, or rubies, or any of that.

280
00:17:19,954 --> 00:17:21,831
They found the secret.

281
00:17:22,748 --> 00:17:24,166
What secret?

282
00:17:24,249 --> 00:17:25,543
Immortality.

283
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,754
Bringing the dead back to life.

284
00:17:29,338 --> 00:17:31,006
Come on, Stick.

285
00:17:32,216 --> 00:17:35,177
[sighs] I thought you
were a Catholic, Matty.

286
00:17:36,345 --> 00:17:40,808
Doesn't your whole belief system
hinge on one guy pulling that off?

287
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:45,896
So...

288
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:50,025
Free from the fear of death,

289
00:17:50,109 --> 00:17:55,615
these pieces of shit step
up, kill their master, take over,

290
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,783
and paint the shores of the Far East

291
00:17:57,867 --> 00:18:00,870
with the blood of
anybody who stands in their way.

292
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:06,626
They grow in size, power, wealth...

293
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:10,212
spread across Asia...

294
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:12,882
and finally give themselves a name.

295
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:15,259
Yaminote.

296
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:18,387
It means, "The Hand."

297
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:22,266
And did they have a goal?

298
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:25,895
Weapons. It's always weapons.

299
00:18:25,978 --> 00:18:28,313
Like, guns, bombs?

300
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:29,565
Worse.

301
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,693
Thing called a Black Sky.

302
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:36,113
So, what's it do, this, uh, Black Sky?

303
00:18:36,196 --> 00:18:37,990
Nobody knows exactly.

304
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:41,451
Why not?

305
00:18:41,536 --> 00:18:44,497
Because they've never activated one.

306
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:48,250
They've tried. They'll try again.

307
00:18:49,877 --> 00:18:51,045
But...

308
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:55,257
the Hand made one mistake.

309
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:57,051
They made enemies.

310
00:18:57,134 --> 00:18:58,302
Bingo.

311
00:19:00,262 --> 00:19:02,347
Some say it was just a kid.

312
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,187
Hand comes into his
village, kills everyone...

313
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,939
almost.

314
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,361
Kid... pulls the knife from
the breast of his dead mother...

315
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:19,114
- [blade swishing]
- and goes to work.

316
00:19:20,825 --> 00:19:23,911
He cuts down some of the
Hand's finest warriors.

317
00:19:23,994 --> 00:19:25,580
[man groans]

318
00:19:25,663 --> 00:19:29,458
They're lying dead... kid's standing.

319
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:34,379
They give him a name. The Chaste.

320
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:37,132
And he's just one kid? Alone?

321
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:41,095
Kid grows up, rounds
up every warrior he can.

322
00:19:42,096 --> 00:19:46,308
Men, women, young, old, doesn't
matter as long as they kick ass.

323
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:47,810
And they do.

324
00:19:47,893 --> 00:19:50,104
Without mercy.

325
00:19:53,232 --> 00:19:57,069
And the only protection this
world has against the Hand.

326
00:19:58,237 --> 00:19:59,864
[inhales deeply]

327
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:01,031
Wow.

328
00:20:03,033 --> 00:20:05,828
Now, in this fairy tale...

329
00:20:07,246 --> 00:20:10,040
you're the Chaste, right? That's...

330
00:20:10,124 --> 00:20:11,751
Is that it?

331
00:20:11,834 --> 00:20:13,168
[sighs deeply]

332
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,963
It's why I didn't tell you.

333
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,758
No, no, it's... It's good. It
leaves you front and center.

334
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:22,261
Finding the Hand, keeping
the Black Skies at bay.

335
00:20:22,344 --> 00:20:24,429
Murdering when it suits you.

336
00:20:25,765 --> 00:20:27,391
Believe it or don't.

337
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:32,647
The fact remains that the
city you're sworn to protect

338
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,358
is ground zero in a war it
doesn't even know is happening.

339
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,568
That hole is just the start.

340
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:43,323
So, you can kill, die,

341
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:47,703
or sit on your ass and
watch Hell's Kitchen burn...

342
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:54,877
but this war is bigger than
you, or me, or any of our...

343
00:20:57,462 --> 00:20:58,964
problems.

344
00:20:59,048 --> 00:21:02,635
And you've pulled Elektra
to your side, haven't you?

345
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:04,762
Welcome to the world, kid.

346
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:11,483
[softly] Elektra works for me.

347
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,070
[Dr. Lee] The bullet
penetrated Mr. Castle's skull

348
00:21:21,153 --> 00:21:22,321
in the lower right quadrant,

349
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:25,324
or more specifically, the
sphenofrontal suture,

350
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:28,953
which is the cranial suture between
the sphenoid bone and the frontal bones,

351
00:21:29,036 --> 00:21:30,287
both here and here.

352
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:34,541
I believe what my expert
witness is trying to convey

353
00:21:34,624 --> 00:21:37,461
is that my client,
Frank Castle, was shot...

354
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:40,630
point blank, execution
style, in the head.

355
00:21:41,924 --> 00:21:46,637
Could you please describe the damage
Mr. Castle sustained from the bullet?

356
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,681
[Dr. Lee] It fragmented
on impact, causing damage

357
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:51,641
in both the right frontal lobe
and temporal lobe of his brain.

358
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:54,103
What are the effects of such an injury?

359
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:57,647
[Dr. Lee] Mr. Castle is suffering
from what we call sympathetic storming.

360
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:00,234
It's a heightened and
ongoing state of fight or flight,

361
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:03,528
in which the sympathetic
nervous system is hyperactive.

362
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:07,324
As if he is reliving the
incident of trauma over and over again.

363
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:10,828
It can plunge a seemingly
peaceful individual into...

364
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:12,997
mental and emotional chaos.

365
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,457
It sure sounds a lot like PTSD.

366
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,084
No, that's not where we're going.

367
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,668
Just... listen.

368
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,629
Could you define it
for the jury, please?

369
00:22:20,713 --> 00:22:22,965
Extreme emotional disturbance.

370
00:22:23,048 --> 00:22:24,633
It's twofold.

371
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:28,053
First, the defendant is so
emotionally disturbed that he loses control.

372
00:22:28,137 --> 00:22:31,306
And second, the defendant has
a reasonable explanation

373
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:33,392
for said disturbance,
from his point of view.

374
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:37,437
Are you aware that Frank
Castle's wife, son, and daughter

375
00:22:37,521 --> 00:22:39,439
were all murdered right in front of him

376
00:22:39,523 --> 00:22:41,608
when he sustained the
brain injury in question?

377
00:22:41,691 --> 00:22:43,068
An injury which, you say,

378
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:46,781
keeps him in a perpetual
state of mental and emotional chaos?

379
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:47,865
I am, yes.

380
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:50,993
With that in mind, would you say
that Frank Castle's mental state

381
00:22:51,076 --> 00:22:55,414
satisfies the definition of "extreme
emotional disturbance"?

382
00:22:55,497 --> 00:22:57,666
[Reyes] Objection,
calls for a conclusion.

383
00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:00,169
[Foggy] Your Honor, Dr. Lee
is an expert on the brain.

384
00:23:00,252 --> 00:23:02,212
He is qualified to an opinion,

385
00:23:02,296 --> 00:23:06,383
and said opinion is not only
relevant, but imperative to the case.

386
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:10,054
Overruled.

387
00:23:10,137 --> 00:23:11,263
Dr. Lee?

388
00:23:11,346 --> 00:23:14,683
[Dr. Lee] Personally, I do
believe he is suffering from EED, yes.

389
00:23:14,766 --> 00:23:18,395
And one who's suffering from
extreme emotional disturbance,

390
00:23:18,478 --> 00:23:22,524
is it possible to
willfully premeditate a crime?

391
00:23:22,607 --> 00:23:25,360
Any infractions would be
considered crimes of passion.

392
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:28,197
[Foggy] How many of your other patients

393
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,700
witnessed their families being brutally
murdered right in front of them?

394
00:23:31,783 --> 00:23:33,618
Other than Frank Castle?

395
00:23:33,702 --> 00:23:34,954
He's the only one.

396
00:23:35,037 --> 00:23:38,540
And so would you say the
circumstances surrounding Frank's mental state

397
00:23:38,623 --> 00:23:41,168
is different than
those of your other patients?

398
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:42,502
I would.

399
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:47,091
And what exactly would that
difference be, in simple terms?

400
00:23:47,174 --> 00:23:49,259
Frank Castle's been through hell.

401
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:51,303
[Foggy] Thank you.

402
00:23:51,386 --> 00:23:52,846
[shouting] You killed my dad!

403
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,389
I don't give a shit what
you've been through!

404
00:23:54,473 --> 00:23:56,225
- Order! Order in the court!
- [man] You killed him!

405
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:58,936
- I saw him in his coffin...
- Please remove that young man now.

406
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:01,271
[sobbing] He was my
dad, and now he's gone!

407
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:06,735
I'm now instructing each and every one
of you to disregard that outburst

408
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:10,280
and to not let it
influence your opinions on this case.

409
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:14,034
[Frank] I did that.

410
00:24:15,244 --> 00:24:16,245
Right?

411
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:21,000
That kid, I took his
father from him. I did that.

412
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:24,419
- Yeah, you did.
- Uh-huh.

413
00:24:27,547 --> 00:24:30,050
Look, Frank, I can't judge you.

414
00:24:34,554 --> 00:24:37,224
[softly] That was tough in
there for you, right? It was...

415
00:24:37,307 --> 00:24:38,934
It was, um, hard?

416
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:40,644
[sighs]

417
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:44,148
[softly] Yeah.

418
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:48,568
Okay.

419
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:51,071
You gotta do something for me.

420
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,822
Hmm?

421
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:54,950
I need you to take the stand.

422
00:24:55,034 --> 00:24:56,451
Come on, for what? Why would I...

423
00:24:56,535 --> 00:24:59,955
The jury has to know what happened to
you, what you go through every single day.

424
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,541
After this afternoon... [sighs]

425
00:25:02,624 --> 00:25:05,044
I don't think we have any other shot.

426
00:25:05,127 --> 00:25:06,223
What?

427
00:25:06,369 --> 00:25:08,569
[stammering] And what do you
think is gonna happen here?

428
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,631
We're not gonna win this thing.

429
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:11,675
No, but we can still reduce the charges.

430
00:25:11,758 --> 00:25:12,801
[inhales]

431
00:25:12,884 --> 00:25:16,430
Look, that might not be important
to you, but it is important to me.

432
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,975
All of them, they all
think that you're a monster.

433
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:22,144
But I know that you're not. You're not!

434
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:26,773
You sure about that?

435
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:30,527
What if I find these men that
did that to my family?

436
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,611
What if...

437
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:35,907
What if nothing changes?

438
00:25:36,992 --> 00:25:38,744
[mutters]

439
00:25:38,827 --> 00:25:40,955
What if this is just me now?

440
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:48,628
Then don't you deserve
to know that, too?

441
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:56,511
[Karen] Foggy!

442
00:25:56,595 --> 00:25:57,679
Hey.

443
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:01,808
He'll do it. He'll take the stand.

444
00:26:01,891 --> 00:26:03,643
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

445
00:26:03,727 --> 00:26:06,355
Look, unless you have
a better idea, I think...

446
00:26:06,438 --> 00:26:08,357
[sighs] How did we even get here?

447
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,192
This guy's a murderer.

448
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:13,153
He's killed fathers and
brothers. You heard that kid.

449
00:26:13,237 --> 00:26:14,696
Why are we helping him?

450
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:17,616
[sighs]

451
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:21,411
Do you think that Frank is
completely and totally mentally healthy?

452
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:23,872
- I think he's batshit.
- Yeah?

453
00:26:23,955 --> 00:26:26,041
Well, then that's why you help him.

454
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:29,086
- [sighs]
- Put him on the stand, Foggy.

455
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:30,754
Shit. Okay.

456
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,423
- One caveat, though.
- Okay.

457
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:35,759
- We get Matt to do the questioning.
- No.

458
00:26:35,842 --> 00:26:37,594
- Yes.
- [laughs] No.

459
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:40,639
You're doing great, okay? You're
making Reyes play defense.

460
00:26:40,722 --> 00:26:42,273
You... you don't need Matt for this.

461
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:43,600
- I do, Karen!
- Why do you always do this?

462
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:46,353
Why do you put Matt in the driver's
seat when you can do this yourself?

463
00:26:46,436 --> 00:26:48,188
Matt and I are partners for a reason.

464
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:49,878
There's some things that I'm better at,

465
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:51,507
and there's things that he's better at.

466
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:52,984
This is something that
he'll be better at.

467
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:54,570
He's barely spent two
seconds with Frank.

468
00:26:54,653 --> 00:26:57,364
I know, but that kid nearly
destroyed us in there.

469
00:26:57,447 --> 00:27:00,867
And at this moment, Matt is the
right person to question Frank.

470
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,327
He just is.

471
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:06,123
Okay.

472
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:07,207
I'll get him.

473
00:27:29,896 --> 00:27:32,191
- I'm sorry...
- When we met...

474
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:36,070
was it fate?

475
00:27:37,737 --> 00:27:38,738
Was it luck?

476
00:27:38,822 --> 00:27:40,073
[inhales deeply]

477
00:27:41,241 --> 00:27:42,951
Or was I a mission?

478
00:27:49,124 --> 00:27:50,750
[softly] Mission.

479
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:02,679
[sighs deeply]

480
00:28:10,187 --> 00:28:14,149
Stick trained me a long
time, like he trained you.

481
00:28:14,691 --> 00:28:17,486
He's not a sentimental
man, but he wanted you back.

482
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:23,658
He wanted you to forget
about law, your friends...

483
00:28:24,618 --> 00:28:25,619
your city.

484
00:28:27,162 --> 00:28:29,123
He thought I could distract you.

485
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,501
He was right.

486
00:28:32,584 --> 00:28:33,627
No.

487
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:38,006
Because I did the thing I
promised him I'd never do.

488
00:28:39,174 --> 00:28:41,468
I fell in love with you, Matthew.

489
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:44,888
Listen to my heartbeat, if you must.

490
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:46,806
You know it's true.

491
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:53,313
Stick told me about some secret
Japanese organization.

492
00:28:54,314 --> 00:28:55,524
The Hand.

493
00:28:55,607 --> 00:28:58,568
They won't stop until they've
infiltrated your whole city.

494
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:01,696
Killed every last member of the Chaste.

495
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,823
- Stick...
- You.

496
00:29:03,907 --> 00:29:05,992
[Elektra sighs] We
live on the front lines.

497
00:29:06,535 --> 00:29:08,328
Like it or not.

498
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:10,455
It doesn't mean we have
to fight Stick's way.

499
00:29:10,539 --> 00:29:13,417
He kills his
enemies, and we don't have to.

500
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,502
[Elektra] You make that
choice sound so easy.

501
00:29:15,585 --> 00:29:18,380
[Matt] No, it's not
easy. It's impossible.

502
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:23,260
But it's a choice and it's a
choice that I remake every single day.

503
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:25,887
Every second, sometimes.

504
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,806
And you can, too.

505
00:29:27,889 --> 00:29:30,224
Matthew, there are things
about me you don't know.

506
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:31,601
- I don't need to know.
- I want you to.

507
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:33,895
I don't care, whatever
you've done in the past...

508
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:36,565
Elektra, whoever you've chosen
to be, you're free now, all right?

509
00:29:36,648 --> 00:29:38,817
You could have killed those
men at the hole, but you didn't.

510
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,152
Because you're not Stick.

511
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:43,655
And screw him for ever making you feel
like you might be, even for a second.

512
00:29:43,738 --> 00:29:45,114
- He can hear you.
- I don't care.

513
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,826
When you were hurt, when I
thought I might lose you, I...

514
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:49,494
[shudders]

515
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:51,163
[softly] I...

516
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:53,207
[trembling] I felt hollow.

517
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:56,418
Now, I have no reason to trust you.

518
00:29:56,501 --> 00:29:59,128
You've lied to me more
times than I can count.

519
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:01,215
But if you leave Stick...

520
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,176
be with me.

521
00:30:05,344 --> 00:30:07,512
Fight this war by my side.

522
00:30:07,596 --> 00:30:08,805
My way.

523
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:12,267
Our way.

524
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,104
[softly] Why are you so good?

525
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:21,568
I'm not.

526
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:24,738
[whispers] Yes.

527
00:30:27,115 --> 00:30:29,201
There's a light inside you.

528
00:30:32,871 --> 00:30:35,374
I tried to snuff it out in college.

529
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:39,503
I'm so lucky I failed.

530
00:30:44,048 --> 00:30:46,009
[door opens and closes]

531
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:47,386
Someone... someone's here.

532
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:50,013
You got company.

533
00:30:51,473 --> 00:30:52,724
Hey.

534
00:30:55,435 --> 00:30:56,603
Karen...

535
00:30:57,562 --> 00:30:59,063
Hi.

536
00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:02,276
Um, let's, uh...

537
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,610
- let's go somewhere.
- No. Why?

538
00:31:03,693 --> 00:31:05,279
- So we can talk.
- I don't want to.

539
00:31:05,362 --> 00:31:06,947
I know this looks
crazy, but it's really not.

540
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:08,865
[angrily] It
doesn't... It doesn't matter.

541
00:31:09,616 --> 00:31:12,494
Frank Castle's going to
take the stand tomorrow.

542
00:31:12,577 --> 00:31:14,371
And your friend could use your help.

543
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:16,456
That's all.

544
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,294
Nice meetin' ya.

545
00:31:21,545 --> 00:31:22,546
[door opens]

546
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,631
[door closes]

547
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,466
[indistinct chatter]

548
00:31:31,763 --> 00:31:33,890
- Fan club's here.
- [scoffs]

549
00:31:33,973 --> 00:31:36,976
Word must have gotten
out about Frank testifying.

550
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,396
- [sighs]
- Matt better show.

551
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,899
If he doesn't, we'll survive. Right?

552
00:31:58,332 --> 00:31:59,708
Karen, I'm so sorry about...

553
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:02,336
Uh, Foggy wants to walk
through some things with you.

554
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,552
Yeah, you wanted me here?

555
00:32:10,635 --> 00:32:11,678
Wow.

556
00:32:11,761 --> 00:32:13,054
Let's be clear.

557
00:32:14,764 --> 00:32:17,434
You're not here because you're
a better lawyer or person.

558
00:32:17,517 --> 00:32:21,062
You're here because you're almost as
crazy as Frank Castle, and that's it.

559
00:32:21,145 --> 00:32:22,981
So you called me here to insult me?

560
00:32:23,064 --> 00:32:25,859
I called you here to
be useful, for a change.

561
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:28,445
We need to get Frank to tell
his story in a way that keeps him

562
00:32:28,528 --> 00:32:30,572
out of prison and alive.

563
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:34,993
No one's heard that story except
for you, because you're who you are.

564
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:37,829
Why don't you put all that torture you
put me and Karen through to good use?

565
00:32:37,912 --> 00:32:39,623
- [Matt chuckles]
- Now would be the time.

566
00:32:39,706 --> 00:32:41,040
Counsel, we about ready?

567
00:32:41,124 --> 00:32:42,751
Uh, one more moment, Your Honor.

568
00:32:43,793 --> 00:32:46,421
Did you read the notes
from Schoonover and Lee?

569
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:47,506
Yeah.

570
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:48,923
Okay, here's the play.

571
00:32:49,007 --> 00:32:50,258
Walk Frank through his story.

572
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:52,969
Connect the dots between the
Colonel and the neurologist.

573
00:32:53,052 --> 00:32:55,639
We don't have to prove that
Frank's version of events is true.

574
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:58,182
We just have to convince
the jury that he believes it,

575
00:32:58,266 --> 00:32:59,559
and he relives it every day.

576
00:32:59,643 --> 00:33:02,145
We can put this guy in the
loony bin, where he belongs.

577
00:33:02,228 --> 00:33:03,647
- Counsel?
- [Matt] Yeah.

578
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:06,900
Uh, Your Honor, the Defense would
like to call Frank Castle to the stand.

579
00:33:06,983 --> 00:33:09,736
Bailiff, bring in the defendant, please.

580
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,157
[crowd clamoring]

581
00:33:17,285 --> 00:33:19,413
Tell me what's going on.

582
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:22,165
[quietly] Frank's wearing a suit.

583
00:33:22,248 --> 00:33:25,377
He looks better than I ever
have, and he's not even wearing a tie.

584
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:32,008
[crowd clamoring]

585
00:33:32,091 --> 00:33:34,761
- [gavel banging]
- [Batzer] Order.

586
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,227
[officer whispers] Think
about what you want, Frank.

587
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:52,904
- Something's not right.
- No turning back now.

588
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,533
[bailiff] Do you solemnly
swear that you will tell the truth,

589
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:58,118
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth,

590
00:33:58,201 --> 00:33:59,660
so help you God?

591
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,746
Yeah.

592
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:05,875
[bailiff] Please state
your name for the record.

593
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:07,418
Frank Castle.

594
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:24,227
[Matt] Mr. Castle, you've been
charged with multiple capital crimes.

595
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,690
Been called a killer
incapable of empathy or remorse.

596
00:34:28,773 --> 00:34:30,316
Hmm.

597
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,985
Yeah.

598
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:33,152
So I hear.

599
00:34:34,195 --> 00:34:35,196
Frank...

600
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:36,906
May I call you Frank?

601
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:42,746
Yeah.

602
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:46,332
Frank, we've heard a lot
about neuro-chemistry...

603
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,543
and psychology, and
all things unfolding,

604
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:51,129
scientifically and
otherwise, inside your brain.

605
00:34:52,464 --> 00:34:54,591
But I just have one
question I want to ask.

606
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,595
What happened that day?

607
00:34:58,678 --> 00:35:01,430
The day your family was
so tragically killed.

608
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,484
[Matt] It's okay, Frank.

609
00:35:13,109 --> 00:35:15,444
- I understand, it's difficult.
- [Frank] Do you?

610
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:18,615
Do you understand?

611
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,911
'Cause I don't think
you understand shit.

612
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,713
I'd like permission to treat the
witness as hostile, Your Honor?

613
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:34,839
[Batzer] Granted.

614
00:35:34,923 --> 00:35:36,966
[Matt] All right, Frank.

615
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,803
You don't want to
tell us? I'll tell you.

616
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:42,346
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what kind of man you are.

617
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:45,892
You're the kind of man this city needs.

618
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,604
Because, ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, we all know this city needs help.

619
00:35:49,688 --> 00:35:51,230
Needs it now.

620
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:53,650
Not tomorrow, not next
week, not when the day comes,

621
00:35:53,733 --> 00:35:56,945
when the corruption that Wilson Fisk left
in his wake is flushed out for good,

622
00:35:57,028 --> 00:35:59,322
and the police force is
finally back on its feet.

623
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:01,074
We need it now.

624
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,577
'Cause this city's been sick.

625
00:36:04,578 --> 00:36:06,871
And the cops, they can't
fix it alone, they need...

626
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:10,959
We all need men and women who are willing
to take the fight themselves.

627
00:36:11,042 --> 00:36:13,127
The kind of people who risk their lives

628
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:15,714
so that we can walk safe at
night in our own neighborhoods.

629
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:19,467
The ones our esteemed District
Attorney here is trying so hard to destroy.

630
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:21,636
New York needs these people.

631
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,556
We need... heroes.

632
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,974
[crowd applauding]

633
00:36:26,057 --> 00:36:27,417
- [Batzer] Order.
- [gavel banging]

634
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,060
[crowd clamoring]

635
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:31,437
- [Matt] The help they offer...
- [clamor subsides]

636
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:34,232
and the hope that they provide.

637
00:36:36,025 --> 00:36:39,779
Frank Castle wanted to
help, but he took it too far.

638
00:36:39,863 --> 00:36:42,031
He shot people, he killed people.

639
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:43,407
It's against the law.

640
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:46,494
And he broke that law many, many times.

641
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:48,454
Now, I don't like
him any more than you do,

642
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:50,749
but here's the thing, he's
not a common criminal.

643
00:36:50,832 --> 00:36:52,917
He's not malicious in intent.

644
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:55,503
Frank Castle is actually
a good man. He just...

645
00:36:55,587 --> 00:36:58,067
He doesn't know the difference
between right and wrong anymore.

646
00:36:58,089 --> 00:36:59,883
And he doesn't need punishment for that.

647
00:36:59,966 --> 00:37:01,134
He needs help.

648
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:02,510
Our help.

649
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:07,766
That's the kind of man Frank Castle is.

650
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:12,979
And now, you have to decide what
kind of jury you want to be.

651
00:37:15,398 --> 00:37:17,066
No further questions, Your Honor.

652
00:37:19,027 --> 00:37:20,153
[Frank] Your, uh...

653
00:37:21,112 --> 00:37:22,238
Your Honor?

654
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,658
Can I say something?

655
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,076
[Batzer] You may.

656
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,953
You know those, uh...

657
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:32,248
[scoffs] Those people?

658
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:35,960
The ones I put down,
the people I killed?

659
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,255
I want you to know that
I'd do it all again.

660
00:37:39,338 --> 00:37:41,658
- [crowd exclaiming]
- [Frank] This is a circus, all right?

661
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:43,510
It's a charade, it's an act.

662
00:37:43,545 --> 00:37:45,178
- It's bullshit about how crazy I am.
- Language.

663
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:46,930
I ain't crazy!

664
00:37:47,013 --> 00:37:48,557
I'm not crazy.

665
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,641
Okay?

666
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:52,310
I know what I did.

667
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:56,022
I know who I am.

668
00:37:56,105 --> 00:37:58,232
And I do not need your help.

669
00:38:00,985 --> 00:38:04,698
I'm smack-dab in the middle
of my right goddamn mind,

670
00:38:04,781 --> 00:38:06,365
and any scumbag, any...

671
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:10,619
any lowlife, any maggot piece of
shit that I put down, I did it...

672
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:12,413
- because I liked it!
- Order!

673
00:38:12,496 --> 00:38:15,541
Hell, I loved it! I'm sittin'
here, I'm... I'm just itching.

674
00:38:15,624 --> 00:38:18,002
- [crowd clamoring]
- [stutters] I'm itching to do it again.

675
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:21,297
And you think... What, you think
you're gonna send me to a nuthouse?

676
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,342
Some doctor, they're gonna get me
to stop from doing what I want to do?

677
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,678
Well, that ain't
happening! Not on my watch!

678
00:38:27,762 --> 00:38:30,056
You people, you call me the
Punisher, ain't that right?

679
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:31,307
The big bad Punisher.

680
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,790
- [Batzer] Bailiff.
- Well, here I am!

681
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,478
- Remove the witness.
- [Frank] You want it, you got it!

682
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,895
I am the Punisher! I'm right here!

683
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,898
You want it, I'll give it to you.

684
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:41,079
[yelling] And
anybody who came here today

685
00:38:41,104 --> 00:38:42,801
to hear me whine, to hear me beg?

686
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:44,904
Well, you can kiss my ass!

687
00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:47,365
Do you hear me? I'm guilty.

688
00:38:47,448 --> 00:38:50,118
Come on, please, Judge!
I'm guilty, you hear me?

689
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:52,203
I'm guilty! I'm guilty!

690
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:55,248
I'll kill every one of
'em! I'll kill every single one!

691
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,291
[indistinct chatter]

692
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,626
How the hell did this happen?

693
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,003
That wasn't the
Frank I met with yesterday.

694
00:39:00,086 --> 00:39:01,462
[Matt] Guys...

695
00:39:01,545 --> 00:39:04,257
- I think somebody got to him.
- Convincing him of what?

696
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,592
Yelling his way to
multiple life sentences?

697
00:39:06,675 --> 00:39:08,636
- You provoked him.
- [stammering] What? I didn't...

698
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:10,678
- What are you talking...
- I had it lined up for you.

699
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:11,723
We could have done this.

700
00:39:11,806 --> 00:39:13,641
We could have gotten
the charges reduced.

701
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:15,977
All you had to do was get
Frank to tell his story.

702
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,696
Instead you veer off
into vigilante-land!

703
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:19,045
Foggy, he wasn't cooperating!

704
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:20,439
I'm glad we lost.

705
00:39:20,523 --> 00:39:22,150
You hear me? I'm glad.

706
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:23,692
- Foggy...
- Karen, let him go.

707
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:24,778
I don't want to hear it.

708
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:26,195
Karen, can I talk to you
for five seconds, please?

709
00:39:26,279 --> 00:39:28,364
I don't want to hear another
bullshit excuse!

710
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,035
[sighs] Maybe you are an
alcoholic. Maybe you're in a fight club.

711
00:39:32,118 --> 00:39:34,412
Maybe you are sleeping with
a whole harem of women.

712
00:39:34,495 --> 00:39:35,913
I don't care, I'm done.

713
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:40,584
You're right.

714
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:42,920
This city really needs heroes.

715
00:39:44,964 --> 00:39:46,174
But you're not one of them.

716
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:54,766
[sighs]

717
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,602
You gotta feel like shit.

718
00:39:59,979 --> 00:40:01,230
Go back to bed.

719
00:40:01,314 --> 00:40:02,690
[Elektra grunts]

720
00:40:03,691 --> 00:40:05,693
I can barely stand.

721
00:40:06,735 --> 00:40:08,905
Then go back to bed.

722
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:16,412
[sighs] No.

723
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,211
I don't want to be with you anymore.

724
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,172
I want to be with him.

725
00:40:26,714 --> 00:40:29,258
- Don't be stupid.
- He needs more training.

726
00:40:29,342 --> 00:40:30,759
The Hand is new to him...

727
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:32,595
Soft.

728
00:40:32,678 --> 00:40:34,597
Matt Murdock is soft.

729
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,182
He made you soft.

730
00:40:36,265 --> 00:40:39,102
You let your guard down.

731
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:41,855
[sighs] Go back to bed, Ellie.

732
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:44,565
- I'm not a child.
- You can't be with him.

733
00:40:44,648 --> 00:40:45,733
Why?

734
00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:50,113
You can't change what you are.

735
00:40:50,196 --> 00:40:52,781
Matthew thinks I can.

736
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:55,326
- And I believe him.
- [scoffs]

737
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:01,665
Get out...

738
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,335
before I get nasty.

739
00:41:04,418 --> 00:41:06,129
Are you threatening me?

740
00:41:06,212 --> 00:41:08,297
You're damn right, I am.

741
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,677
Go.

[Elektra exhales]

745
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:22,186
What do you think he'll say...

746
00:41:23,729 --> 00:41:25,773
when he finds out...

747
00:41:25,857 --> 00:41:27,275
what you are?

748
00:41:28,943 --> 00:41:30,569
What you've always been?

749
00:41:32,113 --> 00:41:34,823
Haven't told him yet...

750
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:36,534
have ya?

[Elektra grunts]

752
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:41,372
Get out.

753
00:41:41,455 --> 00:41:44,083
Aside from saving your ass...

754
00:41:46,377 --> 00:41:51,382
you have no idea what
I've protected you from.

755
00:41:51,465 --> 00:41:53,259
I can protect myself.

756
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:55,719
[scoffs]

757
00:41:59,265 --> 00:42:00,808
We'll find out.

[sighs]

759
00:42:19,243 --> 00:42:23,414
Enough with these amateurs. Time
to get the band back together.

760
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:24,958
Head to the Wall.

761
00:42:25,041 --> 00:42:26,500
[engine starts]

762
00:43:43,369 --> 00:43:44,662
Where's Stick?

763
00:43:47,415 --> 00:43:49,125
[softly] I made my choice.

764
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:52,128
He didn't like it.

765
00:43:55,423 --> 00:43:57,633
[whispers] I want to be with you.

766
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:02,805
The only person in this
world who believes I'm good.

767
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,993
You lost today.

768
00:44:26,745 --> 00:44:28,414
It doesn't matter.

769
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,544
You lost more than just the case.

[whispers] Yeah.

773
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:40,301
I didn't lose you.

774

I'm sorry.

How can we make it work?

780

I don't know.

781
00:45:15,085 --> 00:45:17,463
But we're gonna figure it out.

Not now, though.
