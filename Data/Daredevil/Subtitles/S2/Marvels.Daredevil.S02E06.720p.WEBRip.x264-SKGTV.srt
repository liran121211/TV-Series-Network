The hacker is on the ninth floor.

00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,041
Move quickly. Quietly.

00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,210
When we are done,
we bring the boss all ten fingers.

9
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,294
Questions?

00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:28,172

[breathes deeply] Mmm.

21
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,638
Come on, that's enough.
You've eaten enough. Talk.

22
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,015
Warm that up for you?

23
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:30,271
[muffled] Pie?

24
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:32,065
Don't tell me you're watching your figure.

25
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:33,942
- We just fought the Yakuza.
- And won!

26
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:37,570
You might've mentioned the Japanese mafia
before butterfly knives started flying.

27
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,198
- I told you I needed help, no?
- You said you needed a lawyer.

28
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,241
- I lied.
- Yeah, no shit.

29
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:43,952
You've been lying since you got here.

30
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:45,703
- And that ends now.
- [Elektra sighs]

31
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:48,081
I want to know
what you're doing back here,

32
00:04:48,164 --> 00:04:49,999
- what's happening with the Yakuza...
- [slurping loudly]

33
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,878
- And I wanna know how you know...
- [slurping continues]

34
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,342
I wanna know how you know about me.

35
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,053
I know who you are
because I watch the news.

36
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:04,138
"The successful apprehension
of Wilson Fisk."

37
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,431
I wear a mask.

38
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:09,227
[scoffs] Well, you can't mask that ass.
I'd know it anywhere.

39
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,520
You've been working out, by the way.
I appreciate that.

40
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:14,983
The Yakuza are a powerful organization
with powerful enemies.

41
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,818
- Mmm-hmm.
- What do they want with you?

42
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,737
I guess I have a way of
pissing people off sometimes.

43
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,990
- Yeah, I agree.
- Come on.

44
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:23,741
Don't be angry, Matthew.

45
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:24,826
I told you.

46
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:28,872
My money's planted deeply inside
investments with the Roxxon Corporation.

47
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:30,414
And Roxxon has ties to crime.

48
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:33,167
- How long have you known that?
- I didn't.

49
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,710
Until last night.

50
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,214
I stirred the pot a little
on the business side.

51
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,134
And when I did, who came knocking
on my door but the Yakuza.

52
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,803
Their mistake, because now,
they're after us.

53
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:48,933
No. Uh-uh. There is no us.
This is your problem.

54
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,854
Why can't you just divest your funds
from Roxxon and be done with it?

55
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:55,481
That's a coward's way out.

56
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,068
Someone screwed with me.
I don't like that.

57
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,487
- Then get a lawyer.
- I thought I did.

58
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,781
- Call the police.
- [sighs] You're one to talk.

59
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,076
- Devil of Hell's Kitchen...
- Would you keep your voice down?

60
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,373
What I do is none of your business,
all right? Not anymore.

61
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,707
[sighs] Matthew...

62
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,419
Let me tell you what's gonna happen now.

63
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:17,711
You're gonna finish your food,

64
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:20,006
you're gonna leave the waitress
the biggest tip she's ever seen,

65
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:22,258
then you're gonna get up and leave.

66
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:25,719
You're gonna book yourself on the first
available flight out of New York...

67
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:27,931
and get on it,
go back to whatever spa,

68
00:06:28,014 --> 00:06:30,599
or resort,
or five-star hotel you just came from,

69
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,393
and stay out of my city.

70
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,062
[Elektra sighs]

71
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:37,065
If the Yakuza have their sights
set on something bigger

72
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:40,859
than your spoiled little rich ass,
then I will take care of them.

73
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:42,153
Let me tell you.

74
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,614
The Yakuza do have a bigger plan,
and I'm not going anywhere.

75
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,326
- You can't fight them.
- And you can?

76
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:50,369
I drove them out of New York once before.

77
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:53,456
Oh, no, you didn't.
The Yakuza never left.

78
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,210
They just hibernated and watched you
take out all of their enemies.

79
00:06:57,293 --> 00:06:58,627
Now, New York is ripe for the taking,

80
00:06:58,711 --> 00:07:00,964
and they plan on getting
to the top of the hill first.

81
00:07:01,047 --> 00:07:02,590
Well, I'll scare 'em back
into hibernation...

82
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:04,383
I came to you.

83
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:07,011
If you don't want to be partners,
I'll handle it on my own...

84
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,512
- [scoffs] Partners?
- [waitress] More coffee?

85
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:09,763
[both] No.

86
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,267
I don't need a partner.

87
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,019
Yes, you do.

88
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:16,479
And so do I.

89
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:21,067
Because you have skills.
You fight better than anyone I know.

90
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,736
But I have information.

91
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,740
I gained access to Roxxon's servers right
in front of their little criminal faces.

92
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,536
We do it together,
we take them down fast and hard.

93
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,581
The second it's done,
I'm out of your city.

94
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:36,749
Forever.

95
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,585
The last time I saw you,

96
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,508
you put a knife in my hand and asked me
to slit Roscoe Sweeney's throat.

97
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,633
I happen to respect human life.

98
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,969
If we do this...

99
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,053
If...

100
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:52,016
then I need to know
you're at least gonna pretend

101
00:07:52,098 --> 00:07:53,307
to feel the same way.

102
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,101
Nobody dies.

103
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,185
Do you understand?

104
00:07:57,645 --> 00:07:58,646
Do you understand?

105
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,106
Oh, perfectly.

106
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,067
Good.

107
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:05,028
I have a rule of my own.

108
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,112
Shoot.

109
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,447
No sex.

110
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:10,158
Oh, my God.

111
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:12,285
[scoffs] You have a pair on you.

112
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,369
Mmm?

113
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:15,579
This may come as a surprise to you,

114
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:18,207
but I've actually moved on
in the ten years since you left.

115
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,876
I'm seeing someone now,
which is only part of the reason

116
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,963
why I have zero interest in ever
starting anything up with you ever again.

117
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:26,049
Of course you do.

118
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,172
- [scoffs]
- Check, please.

119
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,551
You're still so arrogant.

120
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,927
Just realistic.

121
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,138
What makes you think every man you meet
wants to sleep with you?

122
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,682
[inhales] Because so far, they have.

123
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,687
We do this...

124
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,771
we work together,

125
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,024
we take down the Yakuza,
and then you're gone.

126
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:44,827
[whistles] I don't wanna
ever see you again.

127
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,985
- Absolutely.
- Fine.

128
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,779
One last thing.

129
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,948
And this is the deal-breaker.

130
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,660
You have to give me back that pie.

131
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,084
[man] <i>So, um, Miss Page,</i>

132
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,919
I drew this up based on
your official statement to the police,

133
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,338
about the Metro-General shooting.

134
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:07,965
You new to New York, Mr. Roth?

135
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,343
Born and raised.

136
00:09:10,426 --> 00:09:12,678
- Is this your first case?
- Second.

137
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,929
I won my first.

138
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,806
Domestic violence.

139
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:18,351
I believe in protecting women.

140
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:19,685
Thanks. From all of us.

141
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,146
Uh, here, this says that Castle
pursued me down the stairwell,

142
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,190
[stammers] but I went down,
he went up.

143
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,734
Um, okay, that's a change I can make.

144
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,528
Also, I didn't escape on foot,
I had a car.

145
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:32,573
- I know I told the NYPD about that.
- Um... car.

146
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,534
I was also not Castle's only target.

147
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:38,329
That's just flat out wrong.
What about Grotto? Where...

148
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:39,497
Where did you get my statement?

149
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,249
- Grotto?
- [stammers] Grote.

150
00:09:41,332 --> 00:09:43,584
Oh, Elliot Grote.
Yeah, he's on the victim list.

151
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:48,297
Ballistics matched him to one of the many
guns connected to Frank Castle.

152
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,341
[Matt] Early start today?
[Karen] Matt.

153
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,635
Uh, this is Christopher Roth.

154
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,845
He's the public defender
assigned to the Castle case.

155
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,390
I just dropped by to get Miss Page's
signature on this statement.

156
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,308
Once we've got that,
we're all done.

157
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:00,518
Well, with this meeting.

158
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,478
With this case.

159
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,812
How so?

160
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:05,148
Castle's awake.

161
00:10:05,231 --> 00:10:07,191
Soon, he'll plead guilty,
then it's open and shut.

162
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,859
[Foggy] Open and shut is good.

163
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,321
New York will sleep better knowing
Frank Castle's behind bars. I know I will.

164
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,865
Sleep even better when he's dead.

165
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,284
Uh, dead?

166
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:17,868
Well, lethal injection, probably,

167
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,413
although the electric chair
is a possibility.

168
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,873
New York doesn't have the death penalty.

169
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,708
Yeah, but Delaware does.

170
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:28,629
Some Dogs of Hell were murdered
out there along Interstate 95.

171
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:31,424
DA Reyes just has to link
the killings to Castle,

172
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:34,135
and then they'll be well within
their rights to extradite him.

173
00:10:34,218 --> 00:10:35,511
And... [chuckles]

174
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,970
you know...
[clicks tongue]

175
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,182
Are you and DA Reyes friends?

176
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:42,100
- I met her once.
- When?

177
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:44,687
Yesterday, when the judge
assigned me to the case.

178
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:47,815
But, look...

179
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,358
She's the one who took down the Punisher.

180
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:51,777
She's not going through all these paces

181
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,613
so that she can
not put the final nail in his coffin.

182
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:56,031
[chuckles] Literally.

183
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,701
I'm sorry, Mr. Roth,
I can't sign this yet.

184
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,118
[Roth] Um...

185
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:02,746
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

186
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,624
[Matt] We'll be in touch, Mr. Roth.

187
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,876
[sniffs] I'm sure we will.

188
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,887
Statement he wanted me to sign?
Complete work of fiction.

189
00:11:18,971 --> 00:11:20,764
Probably handcrafted by Reyes.

190
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,488
Well, we could write an anonymous letter,

191
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,477
and maybe the judge
will assign a new public defender.

192
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,020
Yeah, or we could help Castle ourselves.

193
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:28,689
- No way.
- [Matt] Yeah.

194
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,983
We don't have to defend him.
We could just negotiate a plea deal.

195
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,193
Without extradition,
or an electric chair.

196
00:11:33,277 --> 00:11:36,905
And then, Castle goes away,
Reyes gets her ticker-tape parade...

197
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,491
[chuckles] everyone wins.

198
00:11:38,574 --> 00:11:40,033
[Foggy] Everyone except us.

199
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:41,369
You see the front door?

200
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,121
The "open" sign is up,
but nobody's walking in.

201
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,456
If we keep messing with Reyes,

202
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,040
we'll be shuttered
by the end of the month.

203
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,166
Come on, if we stand up to her,

204
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:50,043
we could actually end
her incessant bullying.

205
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,629
And possibly save this guy's life.

206
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,339
A murderer who shot at you.

207
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:55,383
For reasons
that I don't fully understand yet.

208
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,675
Roth said Castle's
gonna plead guilty.

209
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,843
So we get in there,
we talk to him...

210
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,012
Ask him some questions about
what really happened to his family,

211
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,096
why Reyes wants him dead.

212
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,517
Build a fair plea,
and show the DA our justice system...

213
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,934
[clicks tongue] still has a backbone.

214
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,771
This is a bad idea, Matt.

215
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:13,609
Um...

216
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,986
[stammers] It's okay,
I'll be outside.

217
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,114
[sighs deeply]

218
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:22,951
[Matt clears throat]

219
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,620
I can't believe
we're even discussing this.

220
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,289
He chained you to a roof.

221
00:12:26,372 --> 00:12:28,123
You, of all people,
should know he's a psychopath.

222
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,626
[whispering] Okay,
his methodology is clearly wrong,

223
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,506
but... in his own kind of way,
he was trying to do something noble.

224
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,508
- Do you hear yourself?
- [laughs] Yeah.

225
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,511
He wanted justice,
Foggy, like us.

226
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,014
So we should risk everything...

227
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,849
our firm, our reputation, and...

228
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:48,769
and let's be honest, our safety?

229
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,979
We should put it all on the line
to help him?

230
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,773
Kinda. Yeah.

231
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:57,361
Is this about saving a man
or saving a vigilante?

232
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:00,864
He's a person.

233
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,159
Like you, Foggy. Like me.

234
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,539
And he shouldn't have to die.

235
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:15,629
[Foggy clears throat]

236
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,925
Karen, grab your stuff.

237
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:23,136
We're going to the hospital.

238
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:28,642
[indistinct clamoring]

239
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,395
[nurse] You can't have cell phones
in this area, sir!

240
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:33,439
- What's going on?
- Reporters.

241
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,609
Looks like every outlet in town
wants a word with Castle.

242
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,069
Or a report on who does.
Come on.

243
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:42,239
[nurse] You press?

244
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,324
[Matt] Uh, no, attorneys.

245
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:46,869
IDs? [clears throat]

246
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:53,626
[Foggy] <i>This much spotlight</i>
<i>concern anyone else?</i>

247
00:13:53,709 --> 00:13:57,045
I mean, we're about to step onto
a big proscenium stage here.

248
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:58,547
And how do I know what proscenium means?

249
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:00,383
- Because I did theater in summer camp...
- [elevator dings]

250
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:01,675
...which is exactly the kind of thing

251
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,319
that these reporters will find out
if they start digging into me.

252
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:05,429
Come on, jazz hands.

253
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:07,973
- [indistinct chatter]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

254
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,517
What the hell are you three doing here?

255
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,601
[Foggy] Brett...

256
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,646
You're wearing a tie, and...
it's not a clip-on.

257
00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:15,481
This ain't a good time, Foggy.

258
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:18,364
- How'd you get babysitting duty, Sergeant?
- A detective sergeant now.

259
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,486
- A promotion?
- [Brett] Uh, just lucky.

260
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:22,237
Top dogs like the press of a good collar.

261
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,781
Yeah, and the cops that get 'em.

262
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,157
[Foggy] Congratulations, Detective.

263
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,827
I'm sorry, but the area is restricted
beyond this point. You can't be here.

264
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,664
What if we have business
with Frank Castle?

265
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,331
Business?
Guy's barely conscious.

266
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,083
Our firm wants to represent him.

267
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:36,502
Man's already got a lawyer.

268
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,920
Yeah, we met that benchwarmer.

269
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,464
Not the freshest fish
the city could've drummed up, but...

270
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,299
he's in the running.

271
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,217
Brett, we feel Nelson and Murdock
is better equipped

272
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,261
to represent Mr. Castle's best interests.

273
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,514
Certainly over that
of his current legal counsel.

274
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,767
Look, I don't ask questions, but every
firm in the city's passed this one by.

275
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,520
Must be a reason.
You're chasing the wrong ambulance.

276
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,021
DA wants the death penalty.

277
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,065
The public defender is all but ready
to roll over and help.

278
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:01,359
[Matt] They'll even extradite Castle
out of New York if that's what it takes.

279
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,071
So we thought he'd respond
to our strategy of, you know,

280
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,197
keeping him alive.

281
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,408
[sighs deeply]

282
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:08,534
Come over here.

283
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:14,665
[whispers] Look,
none of this is my problem.

284
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,710
But all I know is,
you go up against this DA and lose?

285
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,629
The only funeral to attend
will be your firm's.

286
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:23,757
You're talkin' career suicide.

287
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,718
If we walk away...

288
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,010
we're letting him die.

289
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,138
[Brett sighs]

290
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,099
Bags and briefcases get searched.

291
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,852
Do not give Castle anything.

292
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:37,813
Do not take anything from him.
Arms up.

293
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,190
They already searched us
when we came in downstairs.

294
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,485
Yeah?
And we're gonna do it again.

295
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:46,614
Everything's been removed
from inside the room.

296
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:49,742
He's tied down, but keep your distance
and mind the tape.

297
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:54,079
Do not step past it or I get to make
my dream come true and arrest you.

298
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,969
[EKG machine beeping]

299
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:10,888
[Karen] Oh, my God.

300
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,642
- [door closing]
- [lock turning]

301
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:25,443
[Foggy] Matt, the tape.

302
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,072
[Matt] Frank Castle.

303
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:32,743
My name is Matthew Murdock.

304
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:37,581
These are my associates,
Franklin Nelson and Karen Page.

305
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:38,832
Yeah.

306
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,459
I know who you are.

307
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,548
You protect shitbags.

308
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,300
[Matt scoffs]

309
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,346
We came here today to make you an offer.

310
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,142
We don't want money for our services,
we're not...

311
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,477
interested in fame or free advertising.

312
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:02,606
Weren't even assigned to your case.
We don't have to be here.

313
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,569
But you take a quick look around,
you'll notice we're the only ones who are.

314
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:08,070
As you may well know,

315
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,989
your list of enemies extends well beyond
the gangs you've killed.

316
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,618
[inhales deeply] You're very good
at making powerful enemies.

317
00:17:14,702 --> 00:17:16,620
And the day you were admitted
to Metro-General

318
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,455
for the round you took to the head,

319
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,749
a do-not-resuscitate order
was placed on you.

320
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:24,753
And a shoot-to-kill order,
just a few days ago.

321
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,755
We know, because we heard it given.

322
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,799
[Matt] These orders were issued
by the District Attorney.

323
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:31,802
And the fact that she's had it in for us
ever since we started asking questions

324
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,679
tells us we're on the right track.

325
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,431
Someone in the DA's office wants
you dead, Mr. Castle...

326
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:39,351
[inhales] and we'd like to know why.

327
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,815
You let us take your case,
we can soften your sentence,

328
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,441
and give you a shot.

329
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,527
Maybe even find out who's responsible
for what happened to you.

330
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,783
We're talking about your life, Mr. Castle.

331
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:57,995
- We can help you keep what's left of it.
- [chuckles softly]

332
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,246
Yeah.

333
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,750
Kinda like what you did for Grotto, huh?

334
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,086
Karen. Karen! Karen!

335
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,671
- Foggy!
- You want answers?

336
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,758
So do we, but none of us will
get them if you're dead.

337
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:11,925
[exclaims softly]

338
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:13,844
Where did you get that?

339
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:15,929
From your home.

340
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,599
You were in my home?

341
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,059
Why were you in my house?

342
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,020
[Reyes] Who's in there? What?

343
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,563
- Open the door! Open...
- [Frank] You go in my house...

344
00:18:25,648 --> 00:18:28,776
Someone is lying about what happened
to your family, Mr. Castle.

345
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,570
You three, out! Now!

346
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,330
[whispers] We're on shaky ground.

347
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,041
- You need to be really careful.
- [Reyes] Excuse me.

348
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,043
- How can we help you, Ms. Reyes?
- Get your things and go.

349
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,966
Uh, we have a little bit
of business here left.

350
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:49,672
Frank Castle already has counsel.

351
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:52,675
So, unless you've asked
the public defender for permission

352
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,467
to speak to his client,

353
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,595
you are in violation
of New York legal ethics.

354
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,932
We spoke to the PD this morning.

355
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:02,559
To be honest, he doesn't seem
all that prepared to tackle this case.

356
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,896
Although, he did mention the conversation
that you had with him yesterday.

357
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,230
[chuckles]

358
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,234
Matt Murdock, is it?

359
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:13,696
- Yeah, pleasure to meet you.
- [Reyes] Mmm-hmm.

360
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:18,784
You have a reputation of being
a smart man, Mr. Murdock.

361
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,744
And since your colleagues seem unable

362
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:23,496
to grasp the hornets' nest
they keep kicking,

363
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,124
let me direct this at you.

364
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,794
Leave this ward,
leave this man,

365
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,047
leave this entire case behind
before you wake up

366
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,759
six feet under the ash that was your
reputation and promising legal career.

367
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:38,762
We have a right to a private conversation
with a prospective client.

368
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,180
Not if there's a conflict of interest.

369
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,683
- [Foggy] And what conflict is that?
- Elliot Grote.

370
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:46,186
You can't represent Castle when
one of his victims was your former client.

371
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,396
- Alleged victims.
- [Reyes] All the same.

372
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,232
Representing Grotto might have
complicated matters,

373
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,193
but then again, all evidence of our work
with him and our deal with you

374
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,278
seems to have disappeared
from public record.

375
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:59,282
It's almost as if someone didn't want it
known that you violated a witpro contract,

376
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,534
jeopardized the safety of said witness,

377
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:02,995
and then ordered
a shoot-to-kill on Castle.

378
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:05,247
But I guess Ms. Reyes
could just confess to that

379
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,791
when she files
this conflict of interest complaint.

380
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,127
We have our case files
to back up our story.

381
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,294
How's your side looking?

382
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,420
The fact of the matter is,
Ms. Reyes,

383
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,464
the only person who shouldn't
be here right now is you.

384
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,885
Seeing as it's a breach of ethics for
the prosecuting attorney to communicate

385
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,970
with the defendant without his assigned
legal counsel present.

386
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:22,514
So, if you'll excuse us,

387
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,017
we'd like to resume
convincing Mr. Castle that,

388
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,936
unlike his current legal counsel,
we can actually help him.

389
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,230
[Brett] You already did.
[Foggy] What?

390
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,900
Castle doesn't want the public defender.

391
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:35,568
Says Nelson and Murdock
are his lawyers now.

392
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,072
Thank you, Detective Sergeant.
If you'll excuse us.

393
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:40,741
Foggy, do you have my cane?

394
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:43,076
Thank you.

395
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,412
Finally feel like we have the upper hand
against that woman.

396
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:46,830
Yeah, she bluffs well,
but she'll negotiate.

397
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:49,041
- She doesn't want this going to trial.
- Of course.

398
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:51,752
She wants it to end quickly,
so she can move on to burying us...

399
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,504
- Just deal with one problem at a time.
- So where are we supposed to start?

400
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,548
Let's have the charges
and evidence summary brought in here.

401
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:59,301
We can weed through it and work out
what terms we want directly with Frank.

402
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,969
- It'll save time.
- Can't believe this is happening.

403
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:02,345
Oh, this is happening all right.

404
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,347
- [knocking at door]
- Yeah, come in.

405
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,102
Car service for a Mr. Murdock.

406
00:21:09,937 --> 00:21:11,063
Car service?

407
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:15,150
Um... It's, uh, not a very good time.

408
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:16,734
My employer was quite insistent.

409
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,196
- His employer?
- Yeah, the new... the new client.

410
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,157
Um, could you just give us a minute?

411
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:25,535
Yeah, the...

412
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:29,206
That new client I mentioned,
um, I forgot I scheduled a meeting.

413
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:30,457
When?

414
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,919
- [stammers] I guess it's now, I suppose...
- Seriously?

415
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:36,754
- After you insisted we come here?
- Foggy, you saw the bank deposit.

416
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:39,174
[stammering] What kind of client
sends a driver anyways...

417
00:21:39,257 --> 00:21:41,093
The kind that pays.

418
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,385
A lot.

419
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,763
I know the timing is awful, um...

420
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,184
[sighs] It's okay, just go.

421
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:50,435
Go.

422
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,815
All right.
Um, call me with any issues.

423
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,984
This shouldn't take long, anyway.

424
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,443
[Matt] I'm sorry.
[Karen] No, it's okay.

425
00:21:58,526 --> 00:21:59,862
[chuckles] Whoa.

426
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,654
Okay.

427
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,324
Is this officially happening?

428
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,409
Are you guys dating?

429
00:22:06,493 --> 00:22:08,370
- [stammers] Uh, we're...
- Ooh. Uh, we...

430
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:09,913
[stammers] Um...

431
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,165
Not... not labeling it.
[laughs nervously]

432
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,087
[stammers] You know, why don't I...
Why don't I walk you out?

433
00:22:23,969 --> 00:22:25,012
[sighs]

434
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,472
You think he'll be okay?
With this?

435
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,103
Yeah, I mean,
it's a pretty small office.

436
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,980
It's gonna take some getting used to.

437
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,314
Yeah, I guess.

438
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,819
But I'm not misremembering, am I?

439
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:44,114
It really was the best...

440
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,407
curry on the planet?

441
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,783
- Mmm, yes.
- [laughs]

442
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,535
Great, great curry.

443
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,329
Even better company.

444
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,084
I'll try to make this go quick.

445
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,170
[sighs] You know what?

446
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,047
Foggy and I have got our hands full
with everything here.

447
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,465
Why not just make dinner
for tomorrow night?

448
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,592
- Yeah, can we?
- Yeah.

449
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:08,096
- And thanks for backing me up earlier.
- Well, I didn't do it for us.

450
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,348
I did it 'cause helping Frank,
getting to the truth,

451
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,684
that's the right thing to do.

452
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:15,103
- [laughs]
- [chuckling] What?

453
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,605
I know.

454
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,733
- All right.
- Okay.

455
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,328
[sighing]

456
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,293
[exhales]

457
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,594
You can't just send a car for me
whenever you decide...

458
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:50,347
- Get undressed.
- What?

459
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,351
The invite says 7:00 p.m. sharp.

460
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,768
No, I... I can't do this right now.

461
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,604
- I got more important...
- We've been working so hard.

462
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:58,981
I thought we'd get boozy
and let loose for a night.

463
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,065
[laughs] That's funny.

464
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:03,818
We're going to a gala to steal
a top secret Roxxon ledger

465
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,779
that details certain illegal goings-on
in Hell's Kitchen.

466
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:10,950
The way in is Stan Gibson.

467
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:13,953
Armed?

468
00:24:14,037 --> 00:24:16,831
Doubt it.
Works for Roxxon.

469
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:19,959
And according to my intel,
every employee carries a key card

470
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:23,921
that grants them access to their
secret floor in the Yakatomi building.

471
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:28,093
What sets our friend Stan apart
is that he's just an accountant.

472
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,012
Zero fighting chops.

473
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:33,890
So you're gonna pickpocket his key card?

474
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,351
- Yes.
- In the middle of a gala?

475
00:24:36,434 --> 00:24:38,311
That's the idea.

476
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,896
[scoffs]

477
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:44,109
After last night, the Yakuza know
they've been compromised,

478
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:47,612
[sighs] which means security's
gonna be tight.

479
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,614
There was a time when you trusted me.

480
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,782
When was that?

481
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,160
We'll be fine.

482
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:55,453
I have a life.

483
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,919
Certain things I want to protect.
I need to know every step of this plan.

484
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,419
Matthew, where's the fun in that?

485
00:25:02,502 --> 00:25:04,921
There isn't any. It's not about fun.
We have a deal.

486
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,464
I told you, one and done.

487
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,175
- After tonight...
- Farewell.

488
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,342
I know.

489
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,010
Yeah.

490
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,098
Let's make it count, then.

491
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:22,021
[sighing] It's worse than I thought.

492
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:25,733
Thirty-seven separate murder charges.

493
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:26,984
What about you?

494
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:29,612
Uh, 98 lesser...

495
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,407
[sighs] I mean,
felony assault, burglary...

496
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,452
[sighs] criminal possession of a weapon,
reckless endangerment...

497
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:38,871
[stammers] Any number
of criminal mischief charges.

498
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:40,373
We're so screwed.

499
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,877
You ready to go in?

500
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,003
No.

501
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,673
But considering the arraignment's
in a couple hours,

502
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,007
we don't have much of a choice.

503
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:56,514
[Karen sighs]

504
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:00,685
Time to play twenty questions
with a killer.

505
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,938
[Foggy] <i>I've reviewed</i>
<i>the charges you're facing.</i>

506
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,150
It's my understanding that...

507
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,569
you wish to plead guilty to all of them?

508
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,158
I'm gonna need a...

509
00:26:15,242 --> 00:26:17,869
verbal confirmation
if we're gonna continue.

510
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:23,791
[Foggy chuckles]

511
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,421
Look, you asked us to represent you.
In order to do my job...

512
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:29,589
I'm guilty.

513
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,801
- [Foggy stammers] Great, uh...
- I'm not talking to you.

514
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,180
What?

515
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:40,517
Her.

516
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:45,355
I need to talk to her alone.

517
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:47,940
Absolutely not.

518
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:52,279
- My colleague is...
- I'll... I'll do it.

519
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,949
[door unlocking]

520
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:01,621
[door closes]

521
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:02,914
[door locking]

522
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,295
- If you're feeling up to it, I...
- [Frank] My family.

523
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,463
What do you know?

524
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,590
Uh, we can get to that.

525
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,842
What do you know...

526
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:18,095
about my family?

527
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,648
Have you ever seen this?

528
00:27:29,732 --> 00:27:32,860
Police report,
complaint number 211974.

529
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,669
"Victims were stopped at a traffic light
northbound on Buellton Ave,

530
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:44,038
when an unidentified male suspect began
firing a 9mm handgun at their vehicle.

531
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:48,751
Juvenile male, juvenile female,
and adult woman

532
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,628
were found dead at the scene.

533
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,506
Adult male driver was critically wounded
and taken to Metro-General."

534
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,342
That's horseshit.

535
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,886
That's the story Reyes is running with.

536
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,850
But you and I know
you and your family, you...

537
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:06,978
you were at the carousel that day.

538
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,189
From what I can piece together,

539
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,984
it seems like you were caught
in some kind of firefight.

540
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:18,698
How much can you remember?

541
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,450
This ain't about what I remember.

542
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,993
Yes. Yes, it is.

543
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:27,707
Mr. Castle,
I've got a lot of puzzle pieces, but...

544
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:32,003
trust me, this moves a lot smoother
if you can tell me anything.

545
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:34,964
[mumbles incoherently]

546
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,219
It goes in and out.

547
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,012
- Yeah.
- Okay.

548
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,724
The fact that it fades...

549
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,397
We took our blanket down to...
our spot.

550
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,441
She was by the carousel on the lawn...

551
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,694
Then I heard her shout.

552
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,155
Scream.

553
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:03,117
It was a grown man.

554
00:29:05,287 --> 00:29:06,663
Who did you see?

555
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,873
I didn't.

556
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:12,460
But I found out later.

557
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,130
The Cartel.

558
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:17,257
Irish.

559
00:29:18,425 --> 00:29:19,509
Bikers.

560
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:21,886
Anyone else?

561
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,557
I should've seen it coming.

562
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,518
- How could you know?
- What'd I just say to you?

563
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,811
I said that I heard it.

564
00:29:31,313 --> 00:29:32,439
I heard it...

565
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:35,983
and I didn't do anything.

566
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,530
My job was to keep them safe.

567
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:42,782
I didn't. [sighs deeply]

568
00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:48,330
I didn't do it.

569
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,916
Uh, I think...

570
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,759
The questions can wait a minute,
I'll just...

571
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:54,961
Um...

572
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:56,128
Why don't I, uh...

573
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,424
Why don't I come back when you're...

574
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:00,633
[Frank] You stay.

575
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,265
Please.

576
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,859
- [indistinct chatter]
- [upbeat music playing]

577
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,070
[Matt] Wait, just hold on a second.

578
00:30:27,369 --> 00:30:29,245
You like my stupid tie now?

579
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,540
- I love your stupid tie now.
- Yeah.

580
00:30:33,708 --> 00:30:35,543
Come on,
let's go get what we came for.

581
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:36,878
[cane tapping]

582
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,963
[band playing upbeat jazz]

583
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,982
- [Matt] You must look nice.
- How would you know?

584
00:30:58,065 --> 00:31:01,486
Turned a lot of heads.
Raising a lot of heart rates.

585
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,699
Too bad you can't enjoy the party.

586
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,785
I think I'll manage a good time.

587
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,412
Don't you love jazz?

588
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,541
Eh... I'm more accustomed to '90s Top 40.

589
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:17,293
[gasps] Then you definitely
deserve a drink.

590
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:20,463
- Elektra.
- Relax.

591
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,591
It'll make people less self-conscious
around you.

592
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:27,929
Ms. Natchios, delighted to have you
here with us this evening.

593
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:31,766
You know I never pass up a chance
to have my ass kissed, Mr. Hirochi.

594
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:32,975
[laughing]

595
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,604
Then, unless this fine gentleman
has beaten me to the punch,

596
00:31:36,688 --> 00:31:40,149
allow me to be the first kisser
this evening.

597
00:31:41,859 --> 00:31:43,277
You look divine, my dear.

598
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:46,155
- Excuse me.
- Mmm-hmm.

599
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,323
[Matt inhales]

600
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,158
First kisser, huh?

601
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,035
[Elektra] That's him, at the bar.

602
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,247
Finish your drink.

603
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,666
Why? We gonna dance?

604
00:31:56,749 --> 00:32:00,753
Ah, just not my song,
but Stan's thirsty.

605
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:02,464
And now, so are we.

606
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,138
Macallan still your drink?

607
00:32:11,222 --> 00:32:13,516
- No, it's good. Consistent.
- [Matt sighs]

608
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,601
[both] Neat.

609
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,436
- [Elektra] Yes, I know.
- [Matt chuckles]

610
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:23,568
Here we go.

611
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,903
- [faint static crackling]
- Wait.

612
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,279
- Elektra.
- What?

613
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,157
[man on radio] <i>Eyes on Gibson at the bar.</i>

614
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,159
I guess Roxxon upped their security.

615
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,146
They're watching him pretty close.

616
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:38,040
[Elektra] They've pinpointed
their weak link.

617
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,251
They're smarter than they know.

618
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,213
[Matt] And chances are,
they've got eyes everywhere else, too.

619
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,591
[typing]

620
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:53,389
Well, this is going to be
more fun than I thought.

621
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,060
We have to get him alone somehow.

622
00:33:00,855 --> 00:33:02,732
Leave it to me.

623
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:04,692
You just hang tight.

624
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,417
- [Stan exclaims]
- [woman laughs] Oh, no!

625
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,169
- [Matt] Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
- [man 1] Ugh!

626
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:25,171
Shit. Oh, God.

627
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,464
- [stammers] Did I get any on you?
- [Stan scoffs]

628
00:33:28,424 --> 00:33:29,634
Oh.

629
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:32,011
- It's nothing.
- [sighs] Please, forgive me.

630
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,013
[stammers] I insist you send me
the dry cleaning bill.

631
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,891
[Stan] No, no, I should watch
where I'm going. It's my fault.

632
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:38,100
Here, allow me.

633
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:40,603
Ugh, I'm such an idiot.

634
00:33:40,687 --> 00:33:41,729
Thank you, sir.

635
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,272
Once again, I'm so sorry.

636
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,481
- Think nothing of it.
- [Matt clears throat]

637
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:46,943
- Enjoy the party.
- [chuckles] Thank you.

638
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,163
[Frank] You were never in any danger.

639
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,333
[softly] What?

640
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:04,001
The other night.

641
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,631
Babysitting that shit brick,
running around with that Grotto.

642
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,466
I just...

643
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:13,595
I only hurt people that deserve it.
I wanted you to know that.

644
00:34:14,596 --> 00:34:15,638
You think he deserved it?

645
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:16,848
I do.

646
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,934
[scoffs]

647
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:23,730
You know he used to do hits for the Irish?

648
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:25,189
Huh?

649
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:28,109
One time, he shot an old lady
because she saw his face.

650
00:34:29,026 --> 00:34:30,319
I guess he...

651
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,030
He didn't tell you that, huh?

652
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,240
Yeah.

653
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,118
The point is,
you were safe, okay?

654
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:39,328
I just... wanted you to know that.

655
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,413
Guess I'm just supposed to
take your word on that.

656
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:42,498
[Frank whispers] Classy.

657
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:44,584
- Nothing to do with my word, lady.
- No?

658
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,710
[Frank] No.

659
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,130
Look, you got any idea what
a scout sniper is?

660
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:50,632
- You ever heard of that? No?
- [sighs] No.

661
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:52,424
Okay, well, you're looking at one.

662
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,805
My class in Quantico was class 307.

663
00:34:57,889 --> 00:34:59,015
And we had a... a motto.

664
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,308
It was a saying, yeah?
It was, "One shot, one kill."

665
00:35:01,392 --> 00:35:03,895
The point is, if I wanted you dead,
you'd be dead.

666
00:35:03,978 --> 00:35:07,815
Why... why am I here?
Why did you ask me to stay?

667
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:13,320
I don't...

668
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,912
I guess I worry that... the memories
are just gonna go away.

669
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:26,375
- Mr. Castle...
- Look, you...

670
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:31,839
You went to...
You were in my house.

671
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:34,884
You...

672
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,010
You never went back?

673
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:40,264
- After your family was...
- No.

674
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,269
Can I just ask you, did you...
Were you in the kitchen?

675
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,354
Yes.

676
00:35:49,106 --> 00:35:50,650
The plates, were they...

677
00:35:50,733 --> 00:35:54,570
Were they on the table,
or did they get into the sink?

678
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:55,822
Um...

679
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,825
Uh...

680
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:00,326
I think, washed.

681
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:01,744
In the rack.

682
00:36:03,162 --> 00:36:05,081
How about in the next room,
did you...

683
00:36:05,164 --> 00:36:07,083
Did you see that piano that was there?

684
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,043
- [Karen] Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

685
00:36:10,837 --> 00:36:12,922
My son, Frank Junior, he...

686
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:16,467
He used to grab a handful of cookies
and take 'em and hide 'em in that bench.

687
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,803
You know, he'd play soldier.

688
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,387
- Guard it, protect it.
- Oh, yeah?

689
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:21,806
Then he'd fall asleep down there.

690
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:23,349
- [Karen laughs]
- [chuckling] We'd find him...

691
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:26,435
He'd be sleeping on a pile of...
pile of cookie crumbs.

692
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:27,979
Yeah, I, um...

693
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,816
When I was little girl,
I did the same thing.

694
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:36,528
Except ginger snaps and,
um, broom closet.

695
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:37,989
- Oh, yeah?
- [laughs]

696
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:39,866
Pretend it was a spaceship.

697
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:42,243
Take me... far away.

698
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,787
Did you? Yeah.

699
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:50,209
[stammers] I guess we need that, right?
We need to get away sometimes.

700
00:36:50,292 --> 00:36:51,711
[Karen sighs gently]

701
00:36:53,796 --> 00:36:55,923
I went up into the kids' bedrooms.

702
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:02,138
There were drawings on the walls and, uh,
sports trophies on the dressers.

703
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,558
Yeah, I was gone a lot, so I didn't...

704
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:08,352
I missed a lot of that.

705
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:09,812
[Karen] There were toys...

706
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,314
scattered all over the ground, um...

707
00:37:13,524 --> 00:37:14,984
A lot of plastic dinosaurs.

708
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:18,070
Yeah, those were my little girl's.
Those were Lisa's.

709
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,573
When she was little,

710
00:37:21,657 --> 00:37:24,243
she used to make these little noises
when she played with them.

711
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,832
What about the little...
the little car?

712
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,000
Like a...

713
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,419
Like a remote-controlled Jeep.
[laughs]

714
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:36,547
Yeah, yeah, that, uh...
That was Frank Junior's.

715
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,590
I got that for him for his
seventh birthday.

716
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:39,926
He used to...

717
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,887
- Yeah, he drove me crazy with that thing.
- [laughs]

718
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,642
[swallows] Look, Frank, it's...

719
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,062
[voice breaking]
It's really not for me to say...

720
00:37:52,855 --> 00:37:54,857
but they clearly loved you.

721
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,318
Very much.

722
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:00,988
Yeah...

723
00:38:01,072 --> 00:38:02,573
Okay...

724
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,623
[Karen sniffles]

725
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,001
Here.

726
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,173
[inhales]

727
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,801
[softly] Thank you.

728
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,761
[Karen sniffles]

729
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,100
Thank you, ma'am.

730
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:31,393
[Karen chuckles] For what?

731
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:34,730
You helped...
You helped me remember.

732
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:37,859
You're welcome.

733
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:39,193
[sniffles]

734
00:38:40,987 --> 00:38:43,405
If you wanna ask your questions,
you can go ahead.

735
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,379
[muted upbeat jazz playing]

736
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:03,425
Blind bastard.

737
00:39:04,635 --> 00:39:07,638
Ugh, could one of you grab me a club soda?

738
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:09,390
Come on.

739
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,725
Oh, for Christ's sake.

740
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:14,854
What the hell? Did the power go out,
or did you hit the switch?

741
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:16,457
- [guard 1 groans]
- [guard 2 grunting]

742
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,149
[guard 2 groans]

743
00:39:22,236 --> 00:39:24,238
[muted jazz continues]

744
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,701
[toilet flushing]

745
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,455
[Matt grunts]

746
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,124
[toilet flushing]

747
00:39:57,854 --> 00:39:58,855
[beeping]

748
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:17,458
[Elektra] This will erase the recordings
and loop the security cameras.

749
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:18,667
[typing]

750
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,171
[clicks mouse]

751
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,010
- [Elektra] This way.
- One second.

752
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:30,221
[guard speaking indistinctly]

753
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,388
Floor's crawling with security.

754
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,015
Come with me.

755
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,496
[Foggy] <i>It's your lucky day,</i>
<i>Mr. Castle.</i>

756
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:58,665
The six Dogs of Hell gang members
you wiped out in Delaware?

757
00:40:58,749 --> 00:40:59,875
Won't be an issue anymore.

758
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:03,337
Delaware doesn't have the evidence
to charge and extradite, so...

759
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:06,465
the death penalty
is officially off the table.

760
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:11,553
But Reyes also wanted three life sentences
without the possibility of parole.

761
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:15,141
But as the Nelson in Nelson and Murdock,
I got her down to one,

762
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:18,935
with the possibility of parole
in 25 years.

763
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,687
That's the good news.

764
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,606
And the bad?

765
00:41:23,524 --> 00:41:27,361
She wouldn't budge on protective custody.
He's gonna have to be in general pop.

766
00:41:27,444 --> 00:41:29,530
[stammers] Uh, no, that's bullshit.
All right? He'll be...

767
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,324
He'll be surrounded by criminals,
people out for his blood.

768
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:33,784
Sounds like a party.

769
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,494
No doubt you can handle yourself,

770
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,417
but I think Reyes
is betting on the gangs here.

771
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,415
Legally, though?

772
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,293
I think this is the best possible deal
we're gonna make right now.

773
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:43,377
So...

774
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,837
I recommend you take it.

775
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:48,257
Okay.

776
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:52,761
[Foggy] Okay, so,
when the judge and Reyes come in...

777
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,806
all you have to do
is say three simple words.

778
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:57,891
"Guilty, Your Honor."

779
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,395
And you'll never have to see us again.

780
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:05,399
Can do.

781
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,156
[judge] Case number 4854,
<i>The People v. Frank Castle.</i>

782
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,839
Do you waive the reading of the charges?

783
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:14,950
[Foggy] Yes, Your Honor.

784
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:16,785
[judge] All right, then.

785
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,038
How does the defendant plead?

786
00:42:32,593 --> 00:42:33,719
I plead not guilty.

787
00:42:33,802 --> 00:42:35,346
[sighs]

788
00:42:35,429 --> 00:42:36,430
You hear that, witch?

789
00:42:36,513 --> 00:42:38,140
I'm gonna watch you burn
right along with me.

790
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:39,766
- You hear me?
- Counselor, please control your client.

791
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,935
- [Frank yelling] Do you hear me?
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

792
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,188
[judge] The defendant has entered
a plea of not guilty.

793
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,940
Due to the nature and severity
of the crimes he is accused of,

794
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,442
bail is denied.

795
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:51,987
A court date will be set upon consultation
with the DA's office.

796
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:53,447
We are adjourned.

797
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,495
[sighs] Holy shit.

798
00:42:59,578 --> 00:43:01,913
That was not supposed to happen.

799
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:04,416
- What'd you say to him?
- What?

800
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,959
[stammers] Three hours ago,
he was pleading guilty.

801
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,087
- Why did he change his mind?
- Maybe he just wants the truth.

802
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:09,921
About Grotto, about his family,
about the...

803
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,007
- [reporters clamoring]
- [Karen] ...the cover-up.

804
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:14,718
I mean, if we go to trial,
then it all comes out, right?

805
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:18,555
[breathing deeply] There's no "if."
This is happening.

806
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,266
Trial of the century.

807
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:23,018
We need to find Matt
before this goes wide.

808
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:24,936
Tell him everything's about to change.

809
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,350
[whispering] Elektra. Elektra.

810
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:50,879
- [band playing upbeat jazz]
- [indistinct chatter]

811
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,700
Not bad, Magoo.

812
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,212
Eyes on Gibson?

813
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:33,004
[man on radio]
<i>He's in the men's room, sir.</i>

814
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:35,090
- [band playing upbeat jazz]
- [crowd cheering]

815
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,101
[Elektra] It's there.

816
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,080
[faint tumblers clicking]

817
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:24,640
[quietly] It's not there.

818
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,433
It was supposed to be there.

819
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:29,603
[clicks tongue]

820
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,106
[Elektra breathing heavily]

821
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:34,733
[muttering]

822
00:45:37,528 --> 00:45:38,820
[exclaims]

823
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:40,238
I take it it's not here.

824
00:45:40,322 --> 00:45:42,240
It was supposed to be there.

825
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,746
- [faint buzzing]
- If they find Gibson, we're toast.

826
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,165
- We have to go.
- [buzzing grows louder]

827
00:45:50,248 --> 00:45:52,167
- Matthew!
- Shh.

828
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,835
[buzzing continues]

829
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:56,087
- [man exclaiming in Japanese]
- [loud clattering]

830
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:06,765
[in Japanese] Stop the elevators.
We have an intruder on the 13th floor.

831
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,226
Pull up security footage.
I want to know who got to them.

832
00:46:15,816 --> 00:46:18,777
[in Japanese] Quick! Pull up
the cameras on the 13th floor.

833
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,198
[Elektra] What?

834
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,534
- [tapping wall]
- There's something behind this wall.

835
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:31,832
There's an electrical current
running through it.

836
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,000
[Elektra] Yeah?

837
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:36,878
[panting] Where?

838
00:46:38,213 --> 00:46:40,591
[Matt] An interruption in the signal...

839
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:42,884
here.

840
00:46:42,968 --> 00:46:44,511
[Elektra] Okay.

841
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:45,596
Okay...

842
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:51,477
[clicking]

843
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,730
- [Matt] Ah.
- [Elektra gasps]

844
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,610
I'm a genius.

845
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:00,694
[chuckles]

846
00:47:08,369 --> 00:47:09,495
- Here, this one.
- [knocks]

847
00:47:09,578 --> 00:47:10,746
Books, paper.

848
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,049
[in Japanese] Hiro, get in here.

849
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,176
They're on a loop.

850
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,185
Sir, we found the problem.

851
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,648
[man in Japanese over radio]
All security, report to the 13th floor.

852
00:47:41,985 --> 00:47:43,278
This is it.

853
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:45,906
The Roxxon ledger.

854
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:48,617
Not now, we gotta go.

855
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:00,211
I don't speak Japanese,
but I think they know we're here.

856
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:02,798
- It's not working.
- [Matt sighs]

857
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,090
They're gonna see us.

858
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,176
[man in Japanese] Shut the power.
Close the gates.

859
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,766
[Elektra] Shit, they found us.
[Matt] Let's go.

860
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:14,643
They've shut down the floor.
They're coming.

861
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,615
[door opens]

862
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,786
[Matt] Now.

863
00:48:33,662 --> 00:48:35,330
- [blows landing]
- [men grunting]

864
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,917
[Elektra grunting]

865
00:48:45,591 --> 00:48:46,883
[Elektra panting]

866
00:49:16,872 --> 00:49:18,874
[faint kissing]

867
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,671
[woman giggling]

868
00:49:28,925 --> 00:49:30,594
[giggling and kissing continue]

869
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:39,060
[woman moaning]

870
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:45,441
[man] Don't move!
[Matt] Oh! Oh, my goodness!

871
00:49:45,526 --> 00:49:46,943
[in Japanese] We got something.
11th floor.

872
00:49:47,027 --> 00:49:49,362
[laughs] We are so sorry.

873
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,281
This is, uh, very embarrassing.

874
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:54,701
[stammering] We just... thought we could,
uh, sneak in here.

875
00:49:54,785 --> 00:49:57,037
But we'll be right out of here...

876
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,329
[grunts] Sir...

877
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:00,874
[slurring] He'll make a big donation.
He's very rich.

878
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,083
Oh...

879
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,085
- Please, sweetheart, just...
- Ow.

880
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:05,754
- [man speaking Japanese]
- [Matt clears throat]

881
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,047
- Very sorry, sir.
- Shut up!

882
00:50:21,687 --> 00:50:24,856
[in Japanese] Nothing but a couple drunks.
Keep checking the 13th floor.

883
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,650
Thank you.

884
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:28,026
- You need to leave.
- Yes, certainly.

885
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,736
Once again,
we're so sorry, we didn't...

886
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,738
- [man] Now!
- [Elektra laughing]

887
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,034
[elevator door dings]

888
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,953
[Elektra laughing]

889
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,454
[Matt clears throat]

890
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:46,039
- [Matt] Would you keep your shit together?
- [Elektra whispering] Calm down.

891
00:50:46,837 --> 00:50:48,254
[indistinct chatter]

892
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:54,094
[Elektra] <i>Invoices for arms.</i>

893
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:57,180
- Guns, ammunition...
- You read Japanese?

894
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:58,640
Mmm-hmm.

895
00:50:58,724 --> 00:51:02,060
Drugs. Designer stuff, mostly.

896
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,561
And this looks like people.

897
00:51:04,605 --> 00:51:06,064
Laborers of some sort.

898
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,650
Sounds like a lot of them.

899
00:51:08,734 --> 00:51:10,694
Over the past several months.

900
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,195
And all from Japan.

901
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:19,285
- [whispers] Oh, what is this?
- What is it?

902
00:51:19,369 --> 00:51:22,247
I don't know.
This one, I can't read.

903
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,166
- [Matt] What do you mean?
- It's in some kind of code.

904
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,490
[Matt] This doesn't make sense.

905
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:29,921
If invoices for drugs and guns
and human trafficking aren't encrypted,

906
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,464
then what is?

907
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:35,468
Wow, what are they hiding?

908
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:44,519
[Elektra sighs]

909
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:48,649
Same time tomorrow, Matthew?

910
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,027
[Matt snorts]

911
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,580
We have spent
hundreds of millions of dollars,

912
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:07,458
and decades of planning on this operation.

913
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,377
And now...

914
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,839
our most valuable secrets
have been stolen.

915
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,716
I'd be very disappointed

916
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,344
to learn you aided this theft in any way,
Gibson-san.

917
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:19,763
[scoffs] I...

918
00:52:19,846 --> 00:52:22,140
I had nothing to do with it.

919
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,685
We entrusted you with access.

920
00:52:24,768 --> 00:52:31,274
Even employed security to protect you
and ensure the sanctity of our operation.

921
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,026
I was in the bathroom.

922
00:52:33,109 --> 00:52:34,945
We were attacked.

923
00:52:35,028 --> 00:52:36,529
[silenced gun firing]

924
00:52:38,114 --> 00:52:39,950
[Stan exclaims]

925
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:42,243
[gasping] Listen!
Listen, I would never betray you!

926
00:52:42,327 --> 00:52:44,746
I have nothing but respect for the Yakuza!

927
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,374
Who said I was Yakuza?

928
00:52:52,045 --> 00:52:55,506
[indistinct chatter]

929
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:00,804
[door opening]

930
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:02,347
[door closing]

931
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,099
- [Matt] Foggy?
- [footsteps approaching]

932
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,892
You weren't answering your phone.

933
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:14,901
- Why are you fancy?
- What's going on?

934
00:53:16,737 --> 00:53:18,321
The arraignment.

935
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:23,827
Frank pled not guilty, Matt.

936
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,787
- What?
- And it gets worse.

937
00:53:25,871 --> 00:53:29,750
Reyes pulled every string she has
and fast-tracked the trial.

938
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,417
[stammering] What...

939
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:32,502
[sighs]

940
00:53:33,754 --> 00:53:34,796
[Matt] All right.

941
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,882
All right, all right, so we, uh...
we motion to extend.

942
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,133
[breathes deeply] We, um...

943
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:41,302
maybe streamline our case theory,
and not waste time fighting any charges...

944
00:53:41,386 --> 00:53:43,429
[shouting] You don't understand, Matt!

945
00:53:44,514 --> 00:53:45,556
Frank agreed!

946
00:53:46,474 --> 00:53:48,977
He thinks he's stickin' it to Reyes
or something.

947
00:53:50,896 --> 00:53:53,731
I hope your schedule is clear, buddy.

948
00:53:53,815 --> 00:53:56,067
'Cause <i>The People v. Frank Castle...</i>

949
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:58,820
starts next week.

950
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:11,416
[door opens and closes]

951
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:19,800
[dramatic music playing]

952
