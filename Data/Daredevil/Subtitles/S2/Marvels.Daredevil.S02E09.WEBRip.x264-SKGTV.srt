1
00:00:19,263 --> 00:00:21,307
[officer 1] All right, watch your head.

2
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,772
[officer 2] Inmate
5-5-4-6-7. Fisk, Wilson.

3
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:35,738
Everything off. Clothing and
personal items in the bin.

4
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:17,154
[sighs]

5
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:29,041
Newbies wear white.

6
00:01:30,126 --> 00:01:31,585
That's yours.

7
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:34,255
[cell door buzzes]

8
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:36,799
[inmates chatter indistinctly]

9
00:01:45,182 --> 00:01:46,183
[cell door slams]

10
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,741
[Donovan] I deeply regret
that it's come to this, Mr. Fisk.

11
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:06,370
I assure you my firm did
everything we could...

12
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:09,999
but the case against you
was, quite simply, bulletproof.

13
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:15,254
[Fisk] How is the progress regarding
my appeal, Mr. Donovan?

14
00:02:16,172 --> 00:02:18,966
We're making progress,
but I have to be honest.

15
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,843
Given the magnitude of charges,

16
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,647
we were lucky we
could plead you out at all.

17
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,181
Vanessa, huh?

18
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,518
I've secured a percentage of
your holdings offshore, as requested.

19
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:32,897
- She wants to come see you.
- She can't.

20
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:35,649
She must stay where she's
safe for the time being.

21
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:39,195
Of course. She'll have
everything she needs.

22
00:02:39,278 --> 00:02:42,198
But with that said,
you need to understand

23
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,907
that a good number of your assets

24
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,892
were seized by the government, Mr. Fisk.

25
00:02:45,952 --> 00:02:48,245
Your remaining capital is... limited.

26
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:53,084
- How long will she be safe for?
- Long enough.

27
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:57,546
Mr. Fisk, I'm doing everything
I can to get you out,

28
00:02:57,629 --> 00:02:59,307
but we're talking about a process

29
00:02:59,332 --> 00:03:01,157
that could take months, maybe years.

30
00:03:02,218 --> 00:03:04,887
In the interim, we need
you to keep your head down

31
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:07,139
and avoid trouble while you're in here.

32
00:03:07,223 --> 00:03:09,160
The state will jump on any infraction

33
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:10,917
to shoot down an early release...

34
00:03:10,977 --> 00:03:12,561
to keep you inside.

35
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,564
It's the best move, Mr. Fisk.

36
00:03:16,482 --> 00:03:18,275
In fact, it's the only move.

37
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:30,746
Those you cannot teach to
fly, teach to fall faster.

38
00:03:32,414 --> 00:03:34,333
[cell door clatters]

39
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:38,545
Wilson Fisk.

40
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,965
The boogeyman of crime.

41
00:03:41,048 --> 00:03:43,718
The man who cast a shadow in the dark.

42
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,807
You'll stop reading those eventually.

43
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:54,185
It's best to accept that real
life is what happens on the inside.

44
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,730
Maybe your life, Mr. Dutton, not mine.

45
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:58,510
We never met before, have we?

46
00:03:58,535 --> 00:04:01,050
No, but your reputation precedes you.

47
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:03,224
A life of running drugs

48
00:04:03,249 --> 00:04:05,638
buys you that much in New York City.

49
00:04:06,782 --> 00:04:08,408
You may have made a name

50
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,601
for yourself on the outside...

51
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:11,870
but I run the big box.

52
00:04:12,538 --> 00:04:14,706
I just wanna make that clear...

53
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,084
in case you get any
ideas about stepping up.

54
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,005
- I have no intentions of doing that.
- Cut the shit, fat man.

55
00:04:21,881 --> 00:04:24,464
I've known guys like you my whole life.

56
00:04:24,489 --> 00:04:25,909
I killed most of 'em.

57
00:04:25,968 --> 00:04:28,262
You ain't never seen a
throne you didn't wanna sit in.

58
00:04:28,345 --> 00:04:31,348
So I'm here to make
myself crystal clear.

59
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:33,273
There's only room for
one of us in this prison,

60
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,686
and it ain't gonna be you. Not ever.

61
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:37,646
Because I'm the kingpin of this bitch.

62
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,484
Catch you later.

63
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,824
[sighs]

64
00:04:48,908 --> 00:04:51,661
[all laughing]

65
00:04:58,417 --> 00:05:00,211
[inmates chatting indistinctly]

66
00:05:11,055 --> 00:05:12,723
Mind if I sit?

67
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:15,517
Fine.

68
00:05:16,685 --> 00:05:19,646
I won't bother you. Just wanted to meet.

69
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:23,150
You know, in here, guys like
us need to stick together.

70
00:05:24,776 --> 00:05:26,111
Guys like us?

71
00:05:26,946 --> 00:05:29,323
I was a mortgage analyst on the outside.

72
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:32,784
Seven figure salary,
summer house in the Hamptons.

73
00:05:32,868 --> 00:05:34,749
Just made the wrong
deal, crossed the wrong guy.

74
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:37,085
It turned out that his brother was

75
00:05:37,109 --> 00:05:39,064
some bigwig in the Justice Department.

76
00:05:39,125 --> 00:05:42,211
Some luck, huh? Look, what I mean is...

77
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,131
we're not like these
savages in here. That's all.

78
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:53,847
Smart to steer clear of that asshole.

79
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:56,933
It's not just the guys at his
table that are on his side.

80
00:05:57,018 --> 00:06:00,187
He runs about 80% of the
contraband in this place.

81
00:06:00,271 --> 00:06:02,591
Most of the guards are in his
pocket, from what I can tell.

82
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:07,153
The two men you were speaking to.

83
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,697
- Valdez brothers.
- They your friends?

84
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,366
[scoffs] Slim
pickings in here, but, yeah.

85
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,993
Yeah, they don't talk much.

86
00:06:15,077 --> 00:06:18,997
Let's just say what they
did to get in here was ghastly.

87
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:21,750
Do they have family?

88
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:26,338
A mother. She'll be alone for a while.

89
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:28,715
[door clanking]

90
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:33,428
I wish I had better news,
Mr. Fisk, but the appeal...

91
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:36,265
- I didn't ask you here for that.
- Oh.

92
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:39,643
I need you to write down the following.

93
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:44,356
The office of Caplan and Dayhill...

94
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,318
they have a client, his
name is Stewart Finney.

95
00:06:47,401 --> 00:06:50,571
- He needs his legal retainer bolstered.
- What?

96
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:52,030
Andrea Valdez.

97
00:06:52,948 --> 00:06:55,951
She's 62. She lives in Spanish Harlem.

98
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:58,704
Needs her rent paid indefinitely.

99
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:03,334
- What is this?
- Untraceable, if you handle it correctly.

100
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,919
Mr. Fisk, I warned you about
getting involved in the...

101
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,421
Get it done!

102
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:30,652
- Fisk.
- Anything on Dutton?

103
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,697
He and his men haven't
emerged from block A today.

104
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:35,031
No way to get in. That
wing's impenetrable.

105
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:37,701
For now.

106
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:41,080
The paper's interesting,
though. Check out the front page.

107
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,043
The Punisher.

108
00:07:47,128 --> 00:07:48,879
Apparently, he gunned
down the Irish in a big way.

109
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:51,757
Mmm, Nesbitt was a problematic leader.

110
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,299
[Stewart] He took out
the Dogs of Hell, too.

111
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:56,024
Blew up their clubhouse. They
charged him with 37 counts of murder.

112
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:59,598
Wow, perhaps his name
suits him. [chuckles]

113
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:03,519
I'd say. Rumor is some of the
Cartel got meat hooks through their faces.

114
00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:08,940
- The Cartel?
- [Stewart] The Mexicans.

115
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,569
If I'm correct...

116
00:08:13,695 --> 00:08:16,532
Dutton didn't do
business with the Cartel.

117
00:08:23,372 --> 00:08:26,792
On the 22nd, Dutton's
lieutenant mentioned...

118
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,143
a deal with the Aryans

119
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:31,528
to move product in the Dogs' territory.

120
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:32,839
A hostile takeover.

121
00:08:35,426 --> 00:08:38,011
Does Dutton have
connections with the Irish?

122
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,875
Some heroin deal gone south.
That was a while back, though.

123
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:46,770
[Fisk] I know what I'm
asking for will be difficult.

124
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,401
I'm not worried about difficult.

125
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,215
I'm not even worried about illegal.

126
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,651
Your funds have almost been depleted.

127
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,279
Building up your little
protection crew wasn't cheap.

128
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:57,113
Nor should it be.

129
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:00,784
Your cash is almost
gone. If I do this, that's it.

130
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:04,538
After that, anything you
need for the rest of your stay,

131
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,550
you'll be dipping into the reserves,

132
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:07,982
into Vanessa's protection.

133
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,544
I won't need anything after this.

134
00:09:13,714 --> 00:09:14,923
[sighs]

135
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:18,760
This guard you've spoken to,

136
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:22,848
do I want to know what
you'll be asking him to do?

137
00:09:24,683 --> 00:09:26,435
[labored breathing]

138
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:40,366

139
00:09:52,211 --> 00:09:54,296
I see you got my message.

You okay?

Where is he?

153
00:12:20,942 --> 00:12:24,029
- Stick? He left. Remember?
- No, not Stick.

154
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:25,489
The boy.

155
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:28,867
The one you killed.

156
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:33,329
- It's been taken care of.
- Not "it."

157
00:12:33,955 --> 00:12:35,582
[softly] He.

158
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:38,710
- Well, he tried to kill you.
- [sighs]

159
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:42,338
He was scared. He was just a kid.

160
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,844
If you'd spared him, he would've
sent his big brothers after us.

161
00:12:47,928 --> 00:12:50,221
- I killed him in self-defense.
- [scoffs]

162
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:52,705
Even your precious court of
law would say that's legitimate...

163
00:12:52,724 --> 00:12:53,975
It doesn't work that way.

164
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:58,104
Well... [sighs] it's a
good thing I'm not on trial.

165
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:03,902
- We need to tell the police.
- [scoffs] Tell them what?

166
00:13:03,985 --> 00:13:07,656
I killed a member of an
ancient organization of ninjas

167
00:13:07,739 --> 00:13:11,367
that are digging a giant
hole in midtown Manhattan?

168
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:14,287
Perhaps we should. Maybe
they need a laugh.

169
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:18,625
But you and I, we've seen it.

170
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,712
The Hand is very real.

171
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:24,856
And they know we're onto them.

172
00:13:24,881 --> 00:13:27,032
The battle has begun, Matthew.

173
00:13:27,092 --> 00:13:29,552
There's nothing we can
do about it now but fight.

174
00:13:29,636 --> 00:13:31,180
[sighs] Look...

175
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:35,851
I wish I could tell you that I'm
not going to pull my sword...

176
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:38,854
- but I will if I have to.
- You said you wanted to be good.

177
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:43,859
- [softly] I do.
- But you don't.

178
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:46,987
I saw it ten years
ago with Roscoe Sweeney...

179
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,906
and I saw it again last night.

180
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:53,243
- Your adrenaline spiked, Elektra.
- [sighs]

181
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,453
You enjoy killing.

182
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,755
And you may say you
wanna be good for me,

183
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:04,111
but that's not who
you really are, is it?

184
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:14,890
The first time I took a life...

185
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:17,934
I was 12 years old.

186
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:23,565
I did it of my own volition.

187
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:27,360
I wasn't saving another.

188
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:29,821
I wasn't even protecting myself.

189
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:34,785
I did it... [sighs]

190
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:36,787
because I needed to know that I could.

191
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:41,457
Not that I could get away with it.

192
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:46,004
[sighs] Not that I could get used to it.

193
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:50,383
And you enjoyed it.

194
00:14:56,848 --> 00:15:00,435
You know, Stick taught us to
never let anyone get close.

195
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:08,944
- I fell in love with you.
- I loved you, too.

196
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,447
That wasn't a lie.

197
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:14,395
I fell in love with you, so I don't want

198
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,100
to keep judging you for who you are.

199
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:20,956
And this... this is who I am.

200
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:25,586
We have to stop corrupting each other.

201
00:15:34,052 --> 00:15:36,304
We can't do this anymore.

202
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:41,935
Say something.

203
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,481
The Hand will decimate your city.

204
00:15:48,984 --> 00:15:50,318
[sighs]

205
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:52,946
Not if I stop them.

206
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:56,658
- You'll die.
- Yeah, maybe.

207
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,494
But this is a war I need to fight alone.

208
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,793
Goodbye, Elektra.

209
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:27,952
[Fisk] The
circumstances are unfortunate,

210
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:30,215
but each loss brings opportunity.

211
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:33,779
- I'm glad we have this chance to meet.
- [Frank] Hmm.

212
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,323
You have something you wanna say to me?

213
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,161
I've been following your case...

214
00:16:43,664 --> 00:16:46,082
as much as one could in this cage.

215
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:51,046
I want you to know...

216
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,488
what happened to your family that day...

217
00:16:53,548 --> 00:16:54,632
Don't you do that.

218
00:16:54,716 --> 00:16:56,927
You don't talk about
my family. You got that?

219
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,512
Just don't do it.

220
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:02,557
- I consider it a tragedy.
- That right?

221
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:06,102
You can save your bullshit
sympathy, 'cause I don't buy it.

222
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:08,146
I understand why you'd think that.

223
00:17:10,023 --> 00:17:12,400
Look, you got
something to say to me or not?

224
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:17,363
Yes. I've crossed paths with
your attorneys... before.

225
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:21,617
Needless to say, I'm
not a... a huge fan.

226
00:17:22,744 --> 00:17:24,267
Pushing you towards a sentence

227
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:25,813
in a mental health facility,

228
00:17:25,872 --> 00:17:27,502
after everything you've been through,

229
00:17:27,526 --> 00:17:28,940
that would have been a travesty.

230
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,546
- As opposed to what?
- Closure.

231
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:36,466
Since I've been incarcerated,

232
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,929
I've developed an empathy towards those

233
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:41,035
who suffer by the hand of the law.

234
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:43,599
I think I've heard
enough of your bullshit, okay?

235
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:46,893
You said closure. What'd you mean?

236
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:54,150
There's a man, here, in the big box.

237
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:00,824
He's a prisoner.

238
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:04,077
He's been overheard...

239
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,498
boasting about his involvement
with several criminal factions.

240
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,535
This man... he
most definitely had a hand

241
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,654
in the massacre in the park.

242
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:19,260
I want a name.

243
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:23,179
- He's in another cell block...
- I didn't ask you that.

244
00:18:23,263 --> 00:18:25,724
Which he essentially owns,

245
00:18:25,807 --> 00:18:28,643
heavily guarded by
guards and inmates alike.

246
00:18:28,727 --> 00:18:31,646
- I don't give a shit. I want a name.
- Dutton.

247
00:18:34,274 --> 00:18:37,360
He's not Irish. He's not Cartel.

248
00:18:37,443 --> 00:18:39,070
He's not a biker.

249
00:18:41,322 --> 00:18:43,324
He's something else entirely.

250
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:47,620
I believe that he
facilitated the deal...

251
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:51,416
between the three groups that
you've been targeting.

252
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:52,708
What's in it for you?

253
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,962
He controls much of this prison...

254
00:18:56,963 --> 00:19:00,967
which has... made my life here...

255
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:04,595
difficult.

256
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,015
So why haven't you done it yourself?

257
00:19:07,098 --> 00:19:08,018
'Cause, Mr. Castle,

258
00:19:08,043 --> 00:19:09,834
unlike most of the population here,

259
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:11,687
my plan is to keep my head down,

260
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:15,065
so I can get out... in
the foreseeable future.

261
00:19:22,363 --> 00:19:24,124
- They with you?
- Yeah, something like that.

262
00:19:24,157 --> 00:19:25,200
That right?

263
00:19:27,911 --> 00:19:29,496
[Frank chuckles softly]

264
00:19:33,834 --> 00:19:38,379
Well, I don't help shitbag,
has-been mob bosses.

265
00:19:38,463 --> 00:19:40,381
- "Has-been"?
- You heard what I said.

266
00:19:52,393 --> 00:19:54,287
I'm simply proposing an arrangement.

267
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:55,795
I don't do arrangements.

268
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,774
You should rethink that...

269
00:19:58,859 --> 00:20:01,528
considering the amount of
enemies you have in here.

270
00:20:01,611 --> 00:20:03,488
I'm not gonna be your
goddamn trigger man.

271
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,991
- I'm not doing it.
- I'm offering you the opportunity

272
00:20:06,074 --> 00:20:10,703
to confront the man
implicated in the deaths of your family.

273
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:13,581
Yes, I benefit from your actions.

274
00:20:15,834 --> 00:20:18,837
But the tide raises
all ships, Mr. Castle.

275
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:23,092
If, for some reason, my involvement

276
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:25,785
diminishes your passion for answers...

277
00:20:25,844 --> 00:20:27,346
for revenge...

278
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,681
well, that's your choice.

279
00:20:31,892 --> 00:20:35,145
But the war you waged
on New York City...

280
00:20:36,062 --> 00:20:37,939
it got you nowhere.

281
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:45,738
I'm offering you
something... no one else could.

282
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:51,536
If you don't want my help, fine.

283
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:54,789
By all means...

284
00:20:55,874 --> 00:20:56,958
enjoy prison.

285
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,880
How would it work?

286
00:21:08,719 --> 00:21:11,222
My resources here are limited,

287
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:15,143
but I can assure you safe
passage to cell block A...

288
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:19,189
which is run by Dutton and his men.

289
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:23,777
Guards have a shift
change at 1500 hours.

290
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:26,404
Dutton's men will be in their
cells. We can get you to him.

291
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:28,114
We have one guard on our
side, but you'll only have

292
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:29,490
a seven-minute window to reach Dutton,

293
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,102
get your answers and get out.

294
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:33,286
[Fisk] I assume that
gives you enough time.

295
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:35,580
- When?
- Does that mean you'll do it?

296
00:21:35,663 --> 00:21:37,540
- When?
- Today.

297
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,297
After this, you and me, we're done.

298
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,132
Yes, we're done.

299
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,976
[Fisk] The shiv is the best I can offer.

300
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:59,312
Something tells me you'll make do.

301
00:22:07,487 --> 00:22:08,863
[Matt] Hey.

302
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:13,659
- You're hurt?
- [sighs] What makes you say that?

303
00:22:14,953 --> 00:22:17,372
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

304
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,916
We need to talk.

305
00:22:21,001 --> 00:22:24,129
[inhales] It's not a great time, Foggy.

306
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:28,133
Never is. Not lately. And that's
the point, so I'll be brief.

307
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:30,718
I think we should shutter
the office for a few weeks.

308
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:33,554
It may be drastic, but after
everything that just happened,

309
00:22:33,638 --> 00:22:35,723
we need to think about our priorities.

310
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:38,309
To decide how to
proceed with Nelson and Murdock.

311
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:41,906
Are you talking about our firm...

312
00:22:41,931 --> 00:22:44,256
or you talking about our friendship?

313
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,943
For a while, they
went hand-in-hand.

314
00:22:50,113 --> 00:22:51,281
I think you're right.

315
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:54,659
I think putting some
distance between us is smart.

316
00:22:54,742 --> 00:22:55,993
[scoffs]

317
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,330
What? Isn't that what you wanted?

318
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:05,295
What I wanted... was time
for us to rethink things...

319
00:23:05,378 --> 00:23:07,338
Time isn't gonna change
who I am, or what I do.

320
00:23:07,422 --> 00:23:09,049
- I don't want to talk about that...
- Yes, you do.

321
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:11,301
- That's why you came.
- I came to talk to my friend,

322
00:23:11,384 --> 00:23:13,053
not the vigilante.

323
00:23:13,136 --> 00:23:15,096
They're the same person, Foggy.

324
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,016
They weren't always.

325
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:24,522
Either way... I have to do this.

326
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:27,586
As we speak, there are horrible things

327
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:28,675
happening in this city.

328
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:30,069
[chuckles] Of course.

329
00:23:30,153 --> 00:23:32,030
You wouldn't believe
me if I told you, so...

330
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,757
You don't get to create danger,

331
00:23:33,782 --> 00:23:35,850
and then protect us from that danger.

332
00:23:36,742 --> 00:23:38,536
That's not heroic.

333
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,080
That's insane.

334
00:23:40,163 --> 00:23:41,414
We were really close

335
00:23:41,497 --> 00:23:42,976
to winning the Frank Castle case

336
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:44,941
and getting that guy the help he needed.

337
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,377
I don't know what tanked
it, but I know we had a shot,

338
00:23:47,462 --> 00:23:51,132
mostly because I worked
my ass off to cover for you.

339
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:54,677
- I deserve better than that.
- I know.

340
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,723
Every time I walk up those stairs...

341
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:01,207
I wonder if today is the day you're
dead in your living room.

342
00:24:01,267 --> 00:24:03,269
I'm not gonna stop, Foggy.

343
00:24:03,353 --> 00:24:04,980
Not anytime soon.

344
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:09,400
And to be honest, I'm done apologizing
to you for who I am.

345
00:24:10,401 --> 00:24:12,609
If I'm holding you back, then you should

346
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,679
consider closing the office for good.

347
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:18,409
You can start over without the
stuff that gets in your way.

348
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:21,579
Without me.

349
00:24:22,955 --> 00:24:26,542
- That's not what I came to say.
- But it's what I'm saying.

350
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:30,421
What am I supposed to tell Karen?

351
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:36,427
I don't know. Same
thing I'm telling you.

352
00:24:37,595 --> 00:24:39,597
You're better off without me.

353
00:24:45,645 --> 00:24:47,355
See you around, Matt.

354
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:50,650
Take care of yourself.

355
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,780
[door closes]

356
00:24:58,616 --> 00:25:00,701
[exhales heavily]

357
00:25:02,287 --> 00:25:05,665
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I... I never set an alarm.

358
00:25:05,748 --> 00:25:07,333
I never need to, but, uh...

359
00:25:07,417 --> 00:25:11,796
let's be honest, it's
been, uh... quite the week.

360
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:17,302
What's going on?

361
00:25:18,844 --> 00:25:21,556
- Packing up.
- The Castle files?

362
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:23,391
Are you hungry? Let's get some food.

363
00:25:23,474 --> 00:25:24,813
Thanks to Frank Castle, anyone that was

364
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:25,875
gonna walk through those doors

365
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:26,977
is now gonna go elsewhere.

366
00:25:27,061 --> 00:25:28,896
Actually, can I show you something?

367
00:25:33,651 --> 00:25:37,447
We should take a long
lunch. We need to talk.

368
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,492
Yeah, yeah, we should. Um...
do you remember John Doe?

369
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:43,328
The report the... the
medical examiner falsified?

370
00:25:43,411 --> 00:25:45,162
Nope. Totally blocked it.

371
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:48,834
Um... well, I think I... I
found something pretty big here.

372
00:25:48,916 --> 00:25:50,272
Whose house did you
break into this time?

373
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:51,651
No need.

374
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:54,797
It's just press passes
and NYPD files and, um...

375
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,093
So these pictures are all from
the day Frank's family was killed.

376
00:25:59,176 --> 00:26:01,637
I've seen enough bloody
bodies to last me a lifetime.

377
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:03,973
- Can we please just...
- [stuttering] Just a sec.

378
00:26:04,056 --> 00:26:05,558
[sighs]

379
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:07,810
Okay, um... look.

380
00:26:08,894 --> 00:26:12,982
- All right, you see him?
- [Foggy] Sure do.

381
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:16,151
[Karen] Now look.

382
00:26:17,237 --> 00:26:18,988
Maybe he was bagged and tagged already?

383
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:21,198
Right, well, that's what I
thought, but... [stutters] I checked

384
00:26:21,282 --> 00:26:22,962
and I couldn't find
any death certificate.

385
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:25,119
Whoever he was, it's
like he was never there.

386
00:26:25,202 --> 00:26:27,663
- [photograph rustling]
- Foggy, look. He was.

387
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:30,791
He was there. What
if he is our John Doe?

388
00:26:30,875 --> 00:26:33,168
Karen... let it go.

389
00:26:33,253 --> 00:26:35,380
The trial is over.

390
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:40,343
- [Foggy sighing]
- Wait.

391
00:26:40,426 --> 00:26:42,803
No, no, nothing has changed.

392
00:26:42,887 --> 00:26:44,221
There is still a
conspiracy. I mean, this...

393
00:26:44,305 --> 00:26:46,599
this guy could be the
key to exposing the cover-up.

394
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:49,769
Maybe. Somebody else's problem now.

395
00:26:49,852 --> 00:26:52,229
What... But just like that? I don't...

396
00:26:52,313 --> 00:26:55,608
We're lawyers. I got bigger
things to worry about.

397
00:26:55,691 --> 00:26:57,024
Like what? Like... like getting

398
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,467
Nelson and Murdock back on top?

399
00:26:58,528 --> 00:27:02,323
- This would do that.
- There is no Nelson and Murdock.

400
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,658
Look around.

401
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:09,330
Okay. You and Matt, you
fought at the courthouse.

402
00:27:09,414 --> 00:27:11,832
You weren't your best selves, but
none of us have been for a long time...

403
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:13,876
I was my best self that day...

404
00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:16,504
at the courthouse, covering
for him. And so were you.

405
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:19,465
You're eerily good at this stuff.

406
00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:20,841
- But Matt has...
- [sighs]

407
00:27:20,925 --> 00:27:22,468
He's... [sighs]

408
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:25,346
He's got other things to take care of.

409
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,682
[sighs]

410
00:27:29,642 --> 00:27:31,185
[inhales deeply]

411
00:27:31,268 --> 00:27:32,503
All right, when I went over

412
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,128
to his apartment the other day...

413
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,775
to get him to come
to the trial, there...

414
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:42,988
there was a... a woman
there, in his bed.

415
00:27:44,949 --> 00:27:47,910
Okay, no. You know, whatever... [sighs]

416
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:50,830
Whatever is going on with Matt, he's...

417
00:27:50,913 --> 00:27:53,499
he's either not capable
or... or not willing

418
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:57,337
to make room for anything
else in his life... right now.

419
00:27:58,588 --> 00:28:00,631
I should've warned you.

420
00:28:03,426 --> 00:28:06,554
No. No, you shouldn't have.

421
00:28:06,637 --> 00:28:08,723
[inhales] Look...

422
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:10,271
if Matt doesn't wanna share his life

423
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,792
with me, that is between me and him.

424
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:13,837
The same way that your friendship

425
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:15,920
with Matt is between you and him.

426
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,899
I don't need to be
warned, Foggy, I just...

427
00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:21,110
I cannot be lied to anymore.

428
00:28:22,027 --> 00:28:24,364
All I want is the truth about something.

429
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:27,575
I get it.

430
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:32,121
I'll give you a call
if something changes...

431
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:35,791
but for now I suggest that...

432
00:28:36,709 --> 00:28:40,380
both of us start thinking about
a life outside this office.

433
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,430
- [Daredevil grunts]
- [man groans]

434
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:13,746
[panting]

435
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:23,338
[panting] Oh, God.

436
00:29:23,423 --> 00:29:26,216
Come on. Shit, shit,
shit. Come on, come on.

437
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,218
- You don't want to do that, Stan.
- [gasps]

438
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:30,304
Don't... [sniffs] don't move.

439
00:29:31,556 --> 00:29:32,973
You're an accountant.

440
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:35,476
A greedy one, yes...

441
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,442
but something tells me, even if you

442
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:39,295
take that shot, you're gonna miss.

443
00:29:39,354 --> 00:29:42,483
And trust me... you don't wanna miss.

444
00:29:42,567 --> 00:29:44,068
I'm not like them.

445
00:29:45,861 --> 00:29:48,448
- Who?
- I don't do what they do.

446
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:52,242
- Are you talking about the Hand?
- Yes.

447
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:55,120
- [breath trembling]
- Put the gun down.

448
00:29:55,204 --> 00:29:56,664
How do I know you're
not working with them...

449
00:29:56,747 --> 00:29:58,999
- [Daredevil grunts]
- [groans]

450
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:01,376
I didn't say anything. Please,
I didn't say anything.

451
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:04,630
That's the problem, Stan. What
do you know about the Hand?

452
00:30:04,714 --> 00:30:07,174
I don't. Please, I'd rather die.

453
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:09,051
Well, that's not gonna help anyone.

454
00:30:09,134 --> 00:30:12,179
They destroy
everything that gets in their way.

455
00:30:13,431 --> 00:30:14,765
The Roxxon Corporation...

456
00:30:16,434 --> 00:30:20,395
the secret room... the
ledger, the dirt, the hole.

457
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,864
I know about it all, Stan.

458
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:23,965
I need to know what they're planning.

459
00:30:24,024 --> 00:30:26,444
Planning? It's already been done.

460
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:28,362
- What's been done?
- Nothing!

461
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,322
I'll protect you.

462
00:30:32,157 --> 00:30:33,951
They have my son.

463
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:36,411
[sobbing] They took Daniel!

464
00:30:37,287 --> 00:30:39,414
I don't know what they're doing to him.

465
00:30:40,458 --> 00:30:43,699
These bodyguards weren't protecting me.

466
00:30:43,724 --> 00:30:46,154
They were holding me hostage.

467
00:30:46,213 --> 00:30:51,677
[whimpering] If I tell you anything...
they will kill my son.

468
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:53,053
[sobs]

469
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,431
[gasping]

470
00:30:59,477 --> 00:31:03,022
- Where are they holding him?
- Some kind of drug operation.

471
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:06,942
I don't know what they're doing
there. They call it the Farm.

472
00:31:07,527 --> 00:31:10,195
- Take me there.
- I've thought about it...

473
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,572
but it's a fortress.

474
00:31:12,615 --> 00:31:16,201
- It's impossible to get inside.
- Take me there.

475
00:31:17,327 --> 00:31:19,079
[indistinct chatter]

476
00:31:22,917 --> 00:31:24,459
[phone ringing]

477
00:31:27,797 --> 00:31:29,339
Karen Page.

478
00:31:30,591 --> 00:31:32,718
Well, you guys had a
hell of a day in court.

479
00:31:32,802 --> 00:31:35,220
Front row seats to the
trial of the decade.

480
00:31:35,304 --> 00:31:36,945
- Did you bring me a T-shirt?
- [chuckles]

481
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:39,183
No. Uh...

482
00:31:40,434 --> 00:31:42,477
I might have something better.

483
00:31:42,562 --> 00:31:43,979
These are from the NYPD files

484
00:31:44,063 --> 00:31:45,658
from Castle's family's
autopsy report.

485
00:31:46,273 --> 00:31:48,175
Um... so, here... you can see here...

486
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,801
The... the body and here...

487
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,071
the body's gone. Is
this some sort of test?

488
00:31:52,154 --> 00:31:53,995
[sighs] Well, I... I
think this is the John Doe

489
00:31:54,031 --> 00:31:56,033
the medical examiner said he covered up.

490
00:31:56,116 --> 00:31:59,579
- Said when?
- During the Frank Castle trial.

491
00:31:59,662 --> 00:32:01,997
Tepper's testimony wasn't public.

492
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:05,585
Oh, my God. Sorry,
they... they cleared the courtroom.

493
00:32:05,668 --> 00:32:07,336
I was one of a handful
of people who heard it.

494
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:10,297
- [sighs]
- Okay, so we... we identify John Doe,

495
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,050
and then we find out why he
was important enough to hide.

496
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:15,720
Uh... you know what? Actually,
I think that, um...

497
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:17,972
I think you should do this.

498
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,766
- Trial's over.
- So?

499
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,393
So, Frank is in prison,

500
00:32:23,477 --> 00:32:25,117
and everyone's
retreated to their corners,

501
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:26,380
including my bosses,

502
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:29,191
one of whom has repeatedly
told me to let it go and move on.

503
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:31,902
And do you... do you wanna move on?

504
00:32:32,612 --> 00:32:34,446
Case is closed.

505
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:36,531
Castle tanked his own
case. He got put away.

506
00:32:36,616 --> 00:32:38,075
I just think you should
carry the torch on this.

507
00:32:38,158 --> 00:32:40,578
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

508
00:32:40,661 --> 00:32:41,706
Okay, so... [stutters]

509
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:43,772
I just wanna rewind
this informal meeting

510
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:45,583
- we're having by about 30 seconds.
- What?

511
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:49,086
You come to me with a lead, with
a... a really good lead, right?

512
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:51,005
And now you just wanna take off? Right?

513
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:53,423
I mean, it's... it's sort of
like a pitcher going to the 8th inning

514
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:55,050
with a no-hit shutout,
and just walking away.

515
00:32:55,134 --> 00:32:58,012
Look, this was supposed to be
about saving my law firm, and I didn't...

516
00:32:58,095 --> 00:33:00,430
I get that. At first, yeah.

517
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:03,183
But I have to tell you, in the last
week, I've gotten about ten phone calls

518
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:05,667
from people wanting to know where
I'm getting my information.

519
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:08,606
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

520
00:33:09,732 --> 00:33:11,275
What'd you tell 'em?

521
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:12,735
What do you think I told
'em? I took all the credit.

522
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:14,058
- But the point is...
- [scoffs]

523
00:33:14,069 --> 00:33:15,529
that when my phone starts
ringing like that,

524
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:17,453
that means that you're
shaking the right trees.

525
00:33:17,489 --> 00:33:20,159
So, yeah, uh, sure. I mean,
the... the case is closed.

526
00:33:20,242 --> 00:33:23,370
Frank Castle's in prison.
But this thing ain't over.

527
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:25,497
Not yet. Not by a long shot.

528
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:28,167
You know it. 'Cause you
know you're on to something.

529
00:33:31,837 --> 00:33:35,090
- Yeah, okay, okay.
- Okay. All right, so, um...

530
00:33:35,174 --> 00:33:37,009
I pull some strings, we, um...

531
00:33:37,092 --> 00:33:40,220
find out the last known
address of medical examiner Tepper,

532
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:41,766
and maybe he'll be more willing to have

533
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:43,289
a conversation outside of the courtroom,

534
00:33:43,348 --> 00:33:45,225
away from the icy death
gaze of Frank Castle.

535
00:33:45,309 --> 00:33:46,476
[stutters] No, but wait. Talk to who?

536
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,600
- Whom.
- Wait, talk to me?

537
00:33:47,645 --> 00:33:49,354
- I...
- No, no, no. To us.

538
00:33:49,438 --> 00:33:50,981
Karen, to us.

539
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:53,025
And don't get cocky. You're
not that good yet.

540
00:33:53,108 --> 00:33:54,401
Got a long time to go.

541
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:57,154
[sighs]

542
00:33:57,947 --> 00:34:01,533
- [indistinct chatter]
- [rock music playing faintly]

543
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:12,627
Cell 305. Room with a view.

544
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:15,756
Seven minutes, and that's it.

545
00:34:23,764 --> 00:34:25,140
[cell door buzzing open]

546
00:34:30,104 --> 00:34:31,605
[cell door slams]

547
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,859
[indistinct chatter]

548
00:34:40,906 --> 00:34:43,533
[man speaking indistinctly on radio]

549
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,334
[man on radio] ...makes the
grab, so a wasted single by Young

550
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:53,543
somehow sends it into...

551
00:34:53,627 --> 00:34:54,795
Twelve.

552
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,966
Prick's 200 light. Rat-faced
son of a bitch.

553
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:01,510
[sputtering]

554
00:35:05,055 --> 00:35:06,390
[grunting]

555
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:09,727
You and me, we gotta talk.

556
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:17,234
[Stan] This is it. The Farm.

557
00:35:18,778 --> 00:35:21,071
- Stay here.
- I'm coming with you.

558
00:35:21,155 --> 00:35:22,990
He's my son.

559
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:26,243
You wanna be alive
to see him? Stay here.

560
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:31,415
Doctor? Doctor, my
name's Karen Page, I...

561
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:34,084
[indistinct chatter on TV]

562
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:36,399
Sir, I know your testimony in the case

563
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:38,654
against Frank Castle hurt your career.

564
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:42,467
I think I can help you.

565
00:35:43,385 --> 00:35:45,637
But I also think there
are other people involved

566
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,639
who could really use your help.

567
00:35:54,146 --> 00:35:55,898
I remember you.

568
00:35:57,066 --> 00:35:58,400
You were with the defense.

569
00:35:59,068 --> 00:36:02,237
- I'm not with them now.
- We're with the New York Bulletin.

570
00:36:03,113 --> 00:36:04,489
[Karen] Please.

571
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:12,622
[Tepper] After what
happened at the courthouse,

572
00:36:12,706 --> 00:36:16,043
the mayor asked me to step down.

573
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:19,129
I know I sound paranoid, but...

574
00:36:19,922 --> 00:36:22,091
there have been people following me.

575
00:36:22,174 --> 00:36:24,759
You're a target because
of what you know.

576
00:36:24,844 --> 00:36:26,079
'Cause whatever that is,

577
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:28,162
they... they want to keep in the dark.

578
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:32,351
Karen has found something that
will bring the truth to light.

579
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:33,727
Here, uh...

580
00:36:34,644 --> 00:36:37,064
This... is this the body they
asked you to make disappear?

581
00:36:37,147 --> 00:36:39,942
- I shouldn't be talking to you.
- I understand you're afraid.

582
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:42,152
You can either continue to
be trapped by what you've done

583
00:36:42,236 --> 00:36:44,113
or you can tell us what you know

584
00:36:44,196 --> 00:36:46,073
so that we can go out and
expose the real bad guys.

585
00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:48,200
And then you can get back to
living your life, because...

586
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:51,370
this place is not where your story ends.

587
00:36:54,748 --> 00:36:55,958
[sighs]

588
00:36:57,584 --> 00:36:59,003
That's him.

589
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:02,006
- That's the John Doe.
- Okay, um...

590
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:04,008
Uh, did he have a wallet?

591
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:05,968
Uh, what about
any... any identifying marks?

592
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:09,513
- Scars? Tattoos? Any...
- [stammers] I tell you this...

593
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:14,935
you have to substantiate it before
you print a word of it.

594
00:37:15,019 --> 00:37:16,353
Of course.

595
00:37:18,188 --> 00:37:20,440
All right, he didn't have a name,

596
00:37:20,524 --> 00:37:23,318
but tucked inside his left
shoe, he did have something.

597
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:26,030
- [Karen] What?
- A police call sign.

598
00:37:26,906 --> 00:37:28,823
A special code.

599
00:37:28,908 --> 00:37:30,868
Look, John Doe wasn't a criminal,

600
00:37:30,951 --> 00:37:34,746
and he wasn't some innocent
bystander in the park, either.

601
00:37:34,829 --> 00:37:36,623
He was an undercover cop.

602
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:41,045
- [sighs]
- Jesus.

603
00:37:41,128 --> 00:37:43,295
Now, you make any noise,
anything at all,

604
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,073
I'm gonna open you up like a bag.

605
00:37:45,132 --> 00:37:47,509
I'll watch you bleed
out all over this floor.

606
00:37:47,592 --> 00:37:50,012
Now, you nod if you understand me.

607
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:52,722
Okay.

608
00:37:52,806 --> 00:37:54,683
- [shuddering]
- Shh.

609
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,810
Stanton massacre.

610
00:37:56,894 --> 00:38:00,314
The carousel hit. I hear you were there.

611
00:38:00,397 --> 00:38:01,856
[scoffs] What if I was?

612
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:03,192
- [shiv clinking]
- [grunts]

613
00:38:03,275 --> 00:38:06,195
[chuckles] You're a goddamn lunatic.

614
00:38:06,278 --> 00:38:07,947
What the hell were you doing there?

615
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,531
[breathing heavily]

616
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:12,034
Drug deal.

617
00:38:12,117 --> 00:38:14,286
I was brokering between
three groups of assholes

618
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:15,769
who barely spoke the same language.

619
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:17,831
- What happened?
- What do you think happened?

620
00:38:17,915 --> 00:38:19,749
- Tell me who started the shooting.
- What?

621
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,711
You tell me who pulled the
trigger. Who made the order?

622
00:38:22,794 --> 00:38:24,588
- It went south.
- What do you mean, "It went south"?

623
00:38:24,671 --> 00:38:25,099
It happens.

624
00:38:25,124 --> 00:38:26,406
What does that mean, "It went south"?

625
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:27,466
What do you mean?

626
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:30,635
It means we're not as
dumb as they thought we were.

627
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:33,888
- We realized what it was.
- What was it?

628
00:38:33,973 --> 00:38:37,226
It wasn't a massacre,
asshole. It was a sting.

629
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:41,230
- A what?
- My source warned me.

630
00:38:41,313 --> 00:38:43,773
The feds infiltrated one of
the gangs. I'm not sure which.

631
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:47,902
They found out how big the
deal was. Massive exchange.

632
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:51,406
A real game changer. But
they weren't after any of us.

633
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,866
They were after the man in charge,

634
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,909
the man who
organized the whole damn thing.

635
00:38:54,994 --> 00:38:56,578
Who's that? Who is that? I want a name.

636
00:38:56,661 --> 00:38:57,746
I never met him.

637
00:38:58,288 --> 00:39:00,374
He never showed his face.

638
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:02,960
All I know is he had
a line on pure heroin.

639
00:39:03,627 --> 00:39:05,629
Shit shipped from the Middle East.

640
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,132
They called him the Blacksmith.

641
00:39:09,174 --> 00:39:10,601
The whole thing should've went

642
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:12,243
by the numbers, but he got wise.

643
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:13,887
He stayed away.

644
00:39:13,971 --> 00:39:16,098
And when they
realized he wasn't gonna show,

645
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:18,433
someone started
shooting. That's all I know.

646
00:39:18,933 --> 00:39:21,686
I swear... to God.

647
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,939
[breathing heavily]

648
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:28,402
I heard about you.

649
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:30,820
News travels fast around here.

650
00:39:31,821 --> 00:39:34,824
But there were
almost 100 bangers that day,

651
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:36,785
and every finger found a trigger.

652
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:40,414
You know, this crusade of yours...

653
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:43,083
it's never gonna end, right?

654
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,210
Right?

655
00:39:46,711 --> 00:39:47,921
[shiv piercing]

656
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:52,884
[breathing heavily] Yeah...
yeah, you're right.

657
00:39:54,219 --> 00:39:55,845
- You're right.
- [blood gushing]

658
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,102
[thudding]

659
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,781
[indistinct chatter]

660
00:40:23,123 --> 00:40:24,124
Open the door.

661
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:26,585
Open the door.

662
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:31,673
[inmates talking indistinctly]

663
00:40:33,092 --> 00:40:34,384
What are you doing?

664
00:40:35,219 --> 00:40:36,595
Open the goddamn door.

665
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:39,681
Hey. Hey.

666
00:40:41,183 --> 00:40:42,309
[Fisk] Mr. Castle...

667
00:40:42,392 --> 00:40:44,269
thank you.

668
00:40:44,353 --> 00:40:45,812
I couldn't have done it without you.

669
00:40:45,895 --> 00:40:48,176
- [inmate 1] They got Dutton!
- [inmate 2] Holy shit, man!

670
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:51,401
[inmate 3] There he is.
There he is. You're a dead man.

671
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:53,987
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

672
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:57,282
- [inmates talking indistinctly]
- Come on. You're dead!

673
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:58,950

[in Japanese] Not strong enough.

- [phone ringing]
- [man] Hai.

693
00:43:19,048 --> 00:43:20,049
Mmm.

694
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,934
[man on phone] We found
two guards unconscious

695
00:43:21,968 --> 00:43:23,011
in the Roxxon garage.

696
00:43:23,094 --> 00:43:24,638
What were they protecting?

697
00:43:24,721 --> 00:43:26,348
Stan Gibson, sir.

698
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:30,769
Find him. The process
is almost complete.

699
00:43:31,686 --> 00:43:33,605
- [metal clanging]
- [thudding]

700
00:43:40,445 --> 00:43:42,113
[grunting]

701
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:45,492
Tell your man to stand down.

702
00:43:45,575 --> 00:43:47,869
[in Japanese] Don't
shoot. Lower the gun.

703
00:43:48,787 --> 00:43:50,289
Lower the gun!

704
00:44:02,426 --> 00:44:05,094
[in English] There are more men outside.

705
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:08,181
Not conscious ones.

706
00:44:09,223 --> 00:44:10,809
Tell me about the Farm.

707
00:44:12,185 --> 00:44:14,145
What are you growing here?

708
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:17,148
- [laughing]
- [grunts]

709
00:44:17,231 --> 00:44:18,942
[groaning]

710
00:44:19,025 --> 00:44:21,320
I am not afraid to hurt you.

711
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:22,904
I know you're not.

712
00:44:23,405 --> 00:44:27,826
But you are not the only
devil who will walk these streets.

713
00:44:28,827 --> 00:44:30,787
[bubbling]

714
00:44:32,038 --> 00:44:36,000
- What's in the basement?
- The rising is coming.

715
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:38,837
You are but one man, akuma-san.

716
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,965
You cannot stop what we have started.

717
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:43,383
[laughing]

718
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,052
[speaking Japanese]

719
00:44:46,135 --> 00:44:47,762
What is that?

720
00:44:47,846 --> 00:44:50,349
[speaking Japanese]

721
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:53,393
[bubbling continues]

722
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:55,228
That's blood.

723
00:44:55,311 --> 00:44:58,815
It wasn't just a random gang
shootout. It was a sting.

724
00:44:58,898 --> 00:45:00,050
Who knows who's involved?

725
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:02,009
[stammers] Cops, DA's office, obviously.

726
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:05,439
- The mayor? How high does this go?
- I don't know.

727
00:45:05,564 --> 00:45:07,491
But I can tell by that look in your eye

728
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:10,201
that you're not gonna get any
rest till you figure it out.

729
00:45:10,284 --> 00:45:13,204
So if you wanna camp out in here...

730
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:16,040
it's all yours.

731
00:45:17,959 --> 00:45:19,419
Start digging.

732
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:25,133
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.

733
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:00,835
[gasps]

734
00:46:00,919 --> 00:46:03,922
Ben was the best
researcher I've ever known.

735
00:46:04,423 --> 00:46:05,799
I remember.

736
00:46:12,764 --> 00:46:14,348
[Karen sobs]

737
00:46:15,767 --> 00:46:18,311
- Did you...
- Read that? Yes. Yeah, I... I read it.

738
00:46:18,394 --> 00:46:21,355
Look, Ben didn't
care, and I don't, either.

739
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,357
[sniffling]

740
00:46:23,442 --> 00:46:24,651
[sighs]

741
00:46:25,694 --> 00:46:27,946
[Karen breathing heavily]

742
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:30,281
Get to work, okay?

743
00:46:47,215 --> 00:46:48,216
[sniffles]

744
00:46:58,059 --> 00:46:59,268
[sighs]

745
00:47:03,773 --> 00:47:05,358
[mouse clicking]

746
00:47:07,777 --> 00:47:10,154
[typing]

747
00:47:18,037 --> 00:47:21,165
[cell door buzzing and opening]

748
00:47:21,249 --> 00:47:22,250
[Fisk] Go.

749
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:23,668
[officer] Are you sure that's
a good idea, Mr. Fisk?

750
00:47:23,752 --> 00:47:25,086
Go now!

751
00:47:31,551 --> 00:47:32,719
[sighs]

752
00:47:35,054 --> 00:47:37,818
How quickly we turn into savages.

753
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,889
As if the moment we walk through
these prison doors...

754
00:47:41,895 --> 00:47:43,897
[Frank] You tried to have me killed.

755
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,191
Yes, it would've been cleaner that
way, but you got what you wanted!

756
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:48,902
Given the condition that he was in,

757
00:47:48,985 --> 00:47:54,240
I assume that Dutton admitted to
some involvement in your tragedy.

758
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:55,992
[chains clinking]

759
00:48:01,665 --> 00:48:05,334
What do you want? Why am I still alive?

760
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:08,755
Because plans change.

761
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:11,382
Because if you want
to survive, you adapt.

762
00:48:11,465 --> 00:48:14,031
Yes! The plan was to kill you.

763
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:16,621
I needed to close that loop.

764
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:20,099
I'd already made a deal with
the rest of the guards.

765
00:48:20,183 --> 00:48:22,852
I doubled the cut that
Dutton was paying them.

766
00:48:22,936 --> 00:48:26,606
But that didn't work out,
did it? No, I was wrong.

767
00:48:27,607 --> 00:48:30,526
That's difficult to admit, but...

768
00:48:33,321 --> 00:48:35,990
you have a gift, Mr. Castle.

769
00:48:36,991 --> 00:48:40,161
I assumed that the
stories that I read in the paper

770
00:48:40,244 --> 00:48:43,782
about your attacks on the criminal world

771
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:45,273
were apocryphal.

772
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:48,002
How could one man be capable of such...

773
00:48:49,713 --> 00:48:50,755
violence?

774
00:48:51,505 --> 00:48:53,299
But then I saw it...

775
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:57,386
with my own two eyes.

776
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:01,286
And when one comes across

777
00:49:01,311 --> 00:49:04,042
someone with such talent...

778
00:49:04,102 --> 00:49:06,562
with such a gift... well...

779
00:49:08,857 --> 00:49:10,566
you don't let that go to waste.

780
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:13,319
No.

781
00:49:14,528 --> 00:49:16,030
No, you don't.

782
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:19,408
[grunts]

783
00:49:20,576 --> 00:49:21,828
How's that?

784
00:49:31,004 --> 00:49:32,672
[Frank breathing heavily]

785
00:49:35,299 --> 00:49:36,342
[grunts]

786
00:49:38,552 --> 00:49:39,929
[grunting]

787
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,601
[both panting]

788
00:49:50,606 --> 00:49:51,691
Release him.

789
00:49:51,775 --> 00:49:53,777
- Mr. Fisk, I...
- Do it now!

790
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:57,321
[Frank groaning]

791
00:50:09,417 --> 00:50:11,961
[Frank] What the hell is this?

792
00:50:13,046 --> 00:50:15,298
I'm in control now.

793
00:50:15,381 --> 00:50:18,092
- And I've set you free.
- What does that mean, "free"?

794
00:50:18,176 --> 00:50:20,261
[panting] I'll show you.

795
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:23,765
[officer] Stay back.

796
00:50:23,848 --> 00:50:27,310
- [spits]
- 'Cause everyone warned me

797
00:50:27,393 --> 00:50:31,105
that prison would be an
inhumane environment.

798
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:36,569
It is. But I... I find it refreshing.

799
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:39,655
The perfect microcosm
of the animal world.

800
00:50:39,739 --> 00:50:41,917
When an animal wants something,

801
00:50:41,942 --> 00:50:44,893
when it needs something, other things...

802
00:50:44,953 --> 00:50:46,537
need to be stepped on.

803
00:50:47,121 --> 00:50:50,875
You want me on the outside so I
step on every piece of shit I see.

804
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:52,924
That way, nobody gets strong, and we...

805
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:54,569
The city's yours for the taking.

806
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:57,173
Something like that. Yeah.

807
00:50:57,256 --> 00:50:58,925
So if you can do
that, if you can get me out,

808
00:50:59,008 --> 00:51:00,426
why not just do it yourself?

809
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:03,304
Because I play the
long game, Mr. Castle.

810
00:51:04,347 --> 00:51:07,100
You see, when I'm
finally let out of this cage...

811
00:51:08,017 --> 00:51:11,687
it won't be to wage
war. It will be to win one.

812
00:51:13,606 --> 00:51:17,443
You, sir... you need to focus on now.

813
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:22,240
I've given you a chance to walk free.

814
00:51:22,866 --> 00:51:25,994
To put that gift of
yours to work, to find...

815
00:51:26,077 --> 00:51:28,121
What does Dutton call him?

816
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,623
The Blacksmith.

817
00:51:32,291 --> 00:51:34,543
If I were in your shoes...

818
00:51:34,627 --> 00:51:38,047
I would use this
opportunity to find your justice,

819
00:51:38,131 --> 00:51:41,009
to kill your way to justice!

820
00:51:42,385 --> 00:51:45,471
And not for me. Of course
not. Not for yourself.

821
00:51:48,141 --> 00:51:49,683
For your family.

822
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,187
For them.

823
00:51:57,776 --> 00:51:58,777
Fisk.

824
00:52:00,486 --> 00:52:01,487
Yes?

825
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:06,826
You know...

826
00:52:08,244 --> 00:52:09,620
next time I see you...

827
00:52:10,663 --> 00:52:12,706
only one of us walks away.

828
00:52:13,792 --> 00:52:15,501
Yes, of course.

829
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:18,171
I'm counting on it.

830
00:52:47,783 --> 00:52:51,079
- Is someone there?
- Someone...

831
00:53:11,682 --> 00:53:13,184
[man groaning]

832
00:53:16,354 --> 00:53:17,897
These people...

833
00:53:23,111 --> 00:53:24,445
Jesus.

834
00:53:32,495 --> 00:53:34,247
[bubbling]

835
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:38,834
What are they doing to you?

836
00:53:38,918 --> 00:53:40,586
[groaning]

837
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:48,344
[Stan] Daniel. Daniel!

838
00:53:48,427 --> 00:53:50,388
Daniel. Oh, Daniel!

839
00:53:50,471 --> 00:53:52,681
We're gonna get them out. Stan,
we're gonna get them all out.

840
00:53:52,765 --> 00:53:53,766
Daniel, my boy.

841
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:58,562
[crying] Oh, my boy. Oh, my boy.

842
00:53:58,646 --> 00:53:59,647
[gasps]

843
00:54:01,565 --> 00:54:02,608
Keys.

844
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:06,779
Just hold on, my son. [grunts]

845
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:16,497
[Daniel wheezing]

846
00:54:19,833 --> 00:54:21,961
[Stan] Come here. Thank God.

847
00:54:22,045 --> 00:54:25,631
Thank God. [grunts] God.

848
00:54:25,714 --> 00:54:28,342
[knives thudding]

849
00:54:28,426 --> 00:54:29,510
[Daredevil] Get down!

850
00:54:33,222 --> 00:54:35,599
[ninja] They weren't finished.

851
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:42,398
[ninja yells]

852
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:48,737
[Fisk] The physician
says that your condition is...

853
00:54:49,655 --> 00:54:51,032
is grave.

854
00:54:53,242 --> 00:54:55,661
That your lungs are filling with liquid.

855
00:54:57,621 --> 00:55:02,961
In a few hours, you're likely
to suffocate in your own blood.

856
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,177
But you won't suffer
alone. I'll be here.

857
00:55:12,178 --> 00:55:14,097
Because you were right.

858
00:55:16,515 --> 00:55:20,853
In prison, there's only
room for one kingpin.

859
00:56:00,684 --> 00:56:02,603
[ninja yelling]

860
00:56:05,814 --> 00:56:06,815
[both grunting]

861
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,063
[ninja screams]

862
00:56:53,154 --> 00:56:56,782
You still have scars to
remember me by, I hope.

863
00:56:58,326 --> 00:56:59,660
[grunting]

864
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,295
[groans]

00:57:19,347 --> 00:57:20,889
[straining]

867
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,568
[both straining]

868
00:57:38,491 --> 00:57:39,533
[Daredevil] Wait...

869
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:43,954
[panting] You're dead.

870
00:57:44,037 --> 00:57:45,914
- [mechanical switch clicks]
- [rumbling]

871
00:57:45,998 --> 00:57:49,001
There is no such thing.
