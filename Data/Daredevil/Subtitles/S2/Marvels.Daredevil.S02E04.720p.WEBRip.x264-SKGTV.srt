1
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:17,936
May your neighbors respect you...

2
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:22,941
trouble neglect you...

3
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,609
[chuckles]

4
00:00:24,693 --> 00:00:26,695
the angels protect you...

5
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,866
and heaven accept you. Mmm?

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,868
- [low murmuring]
- To better days.

7
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:35,620
[man 1] Cheers.
[man 2] Cheers.

8
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,290
[man 1] Hey! Hey, hey, hey.
[man 2] Hey, who is that guy?

9
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,133
[man 3] Easy, lads.
[man 4] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:44,420
[chuckling] Finn.

11
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,673
Caught the first flight soon as I heard.

12
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,300
Yeah...

13
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,885
Terrible circumstances.

14
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,097
But it sure is good to see you.

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,515
- Be a good lad.
- [snaps fingers]

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,310
Go fetch our friend Finn a drink.

17
00:01:06,943 --> 00:01:08,570
It's Rory...

18
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:11,197
isn't it?

19
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,211
This is him, then?

20
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:29,257
[sighs]

21
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:41,811
I didn't want him
to follow my footsteps...

22
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:45,064
but he insisted.

23
00:01:45,148 --> 00:01:47,942
He came over to make his fortune
and now, look.

24
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:51,696
Two cents to his name.

25
00:01:57,285 --> 00:01:59,037
He was a good kid, Finn.

26
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,915
And now he's dead.

27
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,230
You know, maybe you've been
out of the game too long to remember.

28
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:32,195
Death... is part of the deal.

29
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:38,868
[screaming]

30
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:41,830
Leave it, leave it.

31
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:44,999
[groaning]

32
00:02:50,463 --> 00:02:51,630
[grunts]

33
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,550
Holy shit.

34
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,262
- [bone snaps]
- [man groans]

35
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,139
[breathing heavily]

36
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,808
[man] Jesus...

37
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:04,310
[grunts]

38
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:06,104
[continues breathing heavily]

39
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:15,947
[exhales]

40
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,074
[slurps]

41
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:22,370
[panting] Cheers.

42
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:24,663
Yous all all right, yeah?

43
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:25,832
- Oh, yeah.
- [Finn] Yeah?

44
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,000
[men] Yeah.

45
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,627
Now, this bloody shooter,

46
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,089
he stole $1.2 million of my money.

47
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,759
Man takes my son.
I lose a boy.

48
00:03:36,843 --> 00:03:39,637
[grunts] He takes my money.

49
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,765
I'm getting it back.

50
00:03:41,848 --> 00:03:43,349
We will beat every mother's son
in this city

51
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,101
till I have my money in my hands,

52
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:48,772
and this shooter's on his knees, alive.

53
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:52,066
Or there'll be more of you
shining the inside of a box!

54
00:03:56,821 --> 00:03:58,406
Do you hear me?

55
00:03:58,489 --> 00:03:59,824
- [gun cocks]
- Get out!

56
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,368
- [man] Get out! Move! Let's go!
- [woman screams]

57
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,578
- [grunting]
- [glass shatters]

58
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,083
That bastard shooter
that massacred our brothers.

59
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:10,709
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

60
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,046
[grunts]

61
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,132
New faces.

62
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,217
Military training.

63
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:20,261
- Think fast!
- I don't know! Wait, wait!

64
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,430
Wait! I might have seen one guy!

65
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,601
[Rory] Hey, excuse me! Yeah, you.
How's it going, huh?

66
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,479
- Oh, Jesus. [gasping]
- [Rory] You having a good day?

67
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:32,982
- We're looking for a customer.
- [gun cocks]

68
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,193
- What?
- Wears a jacket...

69
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:37,736
even in the middle of summer,
or so they say.

70
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:39,823
[stutters] I... I mean...

71
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,449
- [screaming]
- [dog barking]

72
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:46,162
Now, I count two ankles,
two knees, one elbow.

73
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:48,414
And guess what?
I got five more rounds.

74
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:49,916
[stammering] I don't...

75
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,043
I think I know.
Has a dog, right?

76
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,379
Came in here.
I even saw him walk it once.

77
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:57,173
[chuckles] Elaborate.

78
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,717
[dog barking]

79
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,970
- [dog whimpering]
- Aw.

80
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,347
Sit.

81
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,975
[Rory] Search the closets.

82
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,767
Dog's one of ours.
This is the place.

83
00:05:08,852 --> 00:05:11,229
- [man 1] Nah, it's empty.
- Find my goddamn money.

84
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,356
You heard him.
Let's go!

85
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:20,196
He's not one for fancy living, is he?

86
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,115
- [man 1] Pull that up.
- [dog continues barking]

87
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:23,449
[Rory] Shut that damn dog up!

88
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:26,202
- [man 2] Hey! Knock it off!
- [dog whining]

89
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,787
[man 3] Uh, nothing...
but it ain't money.

90
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:30,539
The money's not here.

91
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,465
That's who you are.

92
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,886
[Rory] Move it.

93
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:48,057
[dog whining]

94
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,781
[theme music playing]

00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:17,063
[knock at door]

97
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,487
- Hi.
- Hey.

98
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,531
- I'm just about ready.
- Okay.

99
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,335
- Uh, here, let me help with that.
- Oh, thanks.

100
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,753
- It's okay.
- [clears throat] Oh.

101
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,671
- [both chuckle]
- Sorry.

102
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:50,346
- You okay?
- Yeah.

103
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:55,268
I'm just, uh...

104
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:58,229
[inhales deeply] recovering.

105
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,773
[clicks tongue] From what?

106
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,903
I don't really know the name for it.
[chuckles softly]

107
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:08,864
But... you're feeling better?

108
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:11,159
Yeah.

109
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,286
Now.

110
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:16,830
With you.

111
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:26,924
Not that I can verify,
but you seem good at this.

112
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,134
[chuckles]

113
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,638
Uh, well, my brother wasn't,
so that's where I came in.

114
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,041
You never said you had a brother.

115
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,975
Uh... you never asked.

116
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:45,359
- Uh, thank you.
- Mmm.

117
00:08:45,443 --> 00:08:47,486
Come on. It's about time.

118
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,572
[church bells ringing]

119
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:55,119
[Lantom] "Precious in the eyes
of the Lord...

120
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:58,331
is the death of his saints."

121
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,460
Well...

122
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,004
Elliot Grote was no saint.

123
00:09:07,465 --> 00:09:08,799
He was human...

124
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:12,678
deeply flawed.

125
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,641
Every Sunday,
for as far as I remember...

126
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,020
Elliot would come here...

127
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,316
friendless and alone...

128
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,692
to sit.

129
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,363
Right there in that pew.

130
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:34,950
Often, I would see him take...
[chuckles softly]

131
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,536
whatever money he had...

132
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,082
crumpled one hundreds, loose change...

133
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,252
a Rolex watch one time...

134
00:09:46,087 --> 00:09:49,715
and put it in the collection plate...

135
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,177
hoping for redemption.

136
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:57,265
Which would never come.

137
00:09:58,224 --> 00:09:59,642
Praying for the light...

138
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:04,480
but Elliot died still in the dark...

139
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,691
with no one to mourn his loss...

140
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,278
except the three of you.

141
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,157
And so, we might say...

142
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,951
one life gone...

143
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,579
one sinful life...

144
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,543
but one person is not just one person.

145
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,380
In each of us,
there is a world...

146
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,135
webbing out, reaching others.

147
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,806
Creating reactions.

148
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,642
Sometimes equal...

149
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:45,020
sometimes opposite.

150
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,776
We rush to say, one life gone...

151
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,448
but each of us is a world.

152
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,824
And today,

153
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,828
a world has been lost.

154
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:04,540
We didn't know him well, but I...

155
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,710
never loved the idea of letting
anyone die alone.

156
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,212
He... He wasn't alone?

157
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:14,217
They found him surrounded by
knocked out Dogs of Hell, right?

158
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,719
I get all the bad guys
confused these days.

159
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:20,764
Didn't think it could get much worse
out there, the violence, but...

160
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:24,268
What if I meet you back at the office?
I'm just gonna take a minute here.

161
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:25,728
Yeah, sure.

162
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,904
[breathes deeply]

163
00:11:35,988 --> 00:11:37,990
- It was a nice sermon.
- Thank you.

164
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,454
Most priests would have found something
kind to say about the man himself, but...

165
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,248
- [chuckles]
- I said he came to church.

166
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:50,002
[scoffs] Nothing shines up a halo
faster than a death, Matthew.

167
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,129
But funerals are for the living...

168
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:55,633
and revising history...

169
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:58,135
only dilutes the lessons
we should learn from it.

170
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,595
It wasn't my fault.

171
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:03,140
- What wasn't?
- Grotto's death.

172
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:05,851
- No one said it was.
- Yeah. [sighs]

173
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,689
There's a new man in town, he's, uh...
[inhales sharply]

174
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:12,566
killing people in cold blood.

175
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,778
Yeah, I read about
what happened with the Irish.

176
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,282
Must have been a...
busy couple nights.

177
00:12:19,365 --> 00:12:20,824
Yeah, I did everything I could to...

178
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,242
[inhales deeply]

179
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,078
uh, protect my client.

180
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:28,248
- That work is done, Matthew.
- [chuckles] Because I failed.

181
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,917
At least you tried.

182
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,378
Well, like you said,
his life had value.

183
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,673
A whole world's been lost
and others are dying one after the other...

184
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:37,508
Matthew, what are you looking for?
[sighs]

185
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,638
- Forgiveness.
- For what?

186
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,227
Uh... not doing more?

187
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:51,314
You just said
you did everything you could.

188
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:55,275
If you're the man I understand you to be,
I'm sure that's true.

189
00:12:57,403 --> 00:12:59,905
Then why do I still feel guilty?

190
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,239
[sighs]

191
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:08,456
Guilt can be a good thing.

192
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,334
It's the soul's call to action.

193
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,462
The indication that...

194
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,547
something is wrong.

195
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:18,882
The only way...

196
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,720
to rid your heart of it...

197
00:13:22,803 --> 00:13:26,014
is to correct your mistakes
and keep going...

198
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,725
until amends are made.

199
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:33,021
I don't know what you didn't do
or what you should have done...

200
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,816
but the guilt...

201
00:13:37,443 --> 00:13:38,777
the guilt...

202
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,491
means your work is not yet finished.

203
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,285
Thank you.

204
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:11,977
[grunting softly]

205
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,561
[Karen] <i>He's lucky to be alive.</i>

206
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:57,355
This is all of the stuff
that the DA's collecting for her case.

207
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,733
And most of it's about
the Punisher's victims.

208
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:02,194
[stutters] The Dogs of Hell, the cartel...

209
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:04,362
But this was in the middle of it.

210
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,364
Not someone he shot, him.

211
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,785
He's insane.
Maybe he shot himself.

212
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:12,413
I thought about that,
but at that close of a range...

213
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:13,997
Yeah, he'd be dead already.

214
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,500
Okay, not to go all tin-foil hat here,

215
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:19,086
but Tower obviously
slipped this to me for a reason.

216
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,089
What if the Punisher
isn't the worst of it?

217
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,592
What if Reyes is trying
to cover something up?

218
00:15:24,675 --> 00:15:28,762
[stutters] You think that murderous
psychopath isn't the worst of it?

219
00:15:28,846 --> 00:15:31,932
No. And I think our best shot
at protecting Nelson and Murdock

220
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,559
- is to find him.
- [phone ringing]

221
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,482
[Foggy] It's our best shot
at career suicide...

222
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,355
- or just getting shot.
- [Karen sighs]

223
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,774
[phone continues ringing]

224
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,569
- [sighs] Am I insane?
- [Foggy] Nelson and Murdock.

225
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,739
- [Karen] Matt?
- Sorry, what? [clears throat]

226
00:15:47,322 --> 00:15:49,032
[stammers] Nothing, just...

227
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,535
Father Lantom's eulogy
really got to me, I guess.

228
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,912
[chuckles] Yeah, he does that.

229
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:55,330
Mmm, Punisher's a lunatic.

230
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,957
But you care, anyway?

231
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,877
I wouldn't say that, it's more like...

232
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,046
curious.

233
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:06,133
In between these files and...
and Reyes' obsession

234
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:10,262
and the fact that humans are a pretty
complicated species to begin with,

235
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:11,930
I just...

236
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,432
I feel like there's gotta be
more to the story.

237
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,854
- I think you are...
- [sighs]

238
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,526
- Oh, my God, you think I'm insane.
- [chuckles]

239
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:26,153
- [chuckles]
- I'm kidding.

240
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:27,530
Compassionate.

241
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,910
- Hmm.
- It's a good quality, Karen.

242
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,286
Stuff of saints.

243
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,039
Yeah, well, I'm no saint.

244
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:39,457
I can't tell you
how glad I am to hear that.

245
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:42,878
[Foggy] Matt!

246
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,883
We have real, live,
non-criminal clients who need our help.

247
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:50,636
- Excuse me for a second.
- Yeah.

248
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,561
Tell me.

249
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,354
Mr. DiPesta defaced the elevator
in his building.

250
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,038
Which, technically,
makes him a criminal.

251
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:06,944
That's what his slumlord, excuse me,
landlord says, but look.

252
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,905
He's got no AC,
no hot water.

253
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:12,157
This has Nelson and Murdock
written all over it.

254
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,659
But we gotta file today.

255
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,285
Karen!

256
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:26,338
- Maybe she stepped out.
- Did she take the files?

257
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:27,631
- Huh?
- From Reyes.

258
00:17:27,715 --> 00:17:28,799
The... the Punisher files.

259
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:30,258
[Foggy] Oh, shit.

260
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:34,763
I have to find her.

261
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,474
- Find him first.
- [sighs]

262
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:52,740
You're early.

263
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,159
[sighs] You know
I don't like being rushed.

264
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,163
- I need the suit, Melvin.
- Yeah, I figured.

265
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,002
[sighs]

266
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,422
You know, you getting popped in the noggin

267
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,010
gave me a chance to try some new stuff
and I'm pretty excited about it.

268
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,223
Fortified, carbon tube helmet.

269
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:21,143
I mean, it's pretty damn close
to indestructible.

270
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,896
- How close?
- I'll leave the testing to you.

271
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:26,189
I threw in some reinforced alloy gloves.

272
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,151
You know, what the hell.
Gotta be careful.

273
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:31,569
Some new people
spilling a lot of blood out there.

274
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:32,655
Who?

275
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,114
Don't know.

276
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,958
But all my old contacts are showing up
again begging me to outfit 'em.

277
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,494
Did you?

278
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,581
No, I don't do that anymore.
I turned them all away.

279
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,255
- Oh, you look better.
- Yeah, I feel better.

280
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,257
Glad you're on the mend.

281
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,634
So am I.

282
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:56,679
Well, stay safe out there,
will you?

283
00:18:56,762 --> 00:18:58,806
Thanks, Melvin. You too.

284
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,224
Oh, I'm not taking any chances.
Check this out.

285
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:02,643
Huh?

286
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,561
Gotta stay strong for Betsy.

287
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:09,191
You wanna take a look?
I mean, it's pretty wicked.

288
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:12,319
I'm gonna take your word for it.

289
00:19:13,696 --> 00:19:15,405
[indistinct chatter]

290
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,990
[laughter]

291
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,201
[sighs]

292
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,247
Uh, George Buck?

293
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,211
Hi, the hospital told me
I might find you here.

294
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,840
Hi, uh... are you one of them?

295
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:35,175
Sorry, one of who?

296
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,259
Please, just leave me alone.

297
00:19:36,343 --> 00:19:38,345
[stammering] I'm not gonna
do anything to you.

298
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:41,181
If anything, I'd like to help
you get your job back.

299
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,768
Look, I need to understand why you were

300
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:47,229
fired from Metro-General
in the first place.

301
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,567
Could I buy you a cup of coffee?

302
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:56,071
You were with him when this was taken?

303
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,782
Yeah. That bullet tore through his head.

304
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,828
Not many people survive that.

305
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:05,580
[sighs] Well, I'd like to know
what you remember.

306
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,750
John Doe.

307
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,542
Guy was a total vegetable.

308
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,295
I guess that's why they decided
he only needed one nurse.

309
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,422
Any family or visitors?

310
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:15,758
No.

311
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,009
I mean...

312
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:18,802
aside from the suits.

313
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:20,553
- Suits?
- Yeah.

314
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:24,599
Uh, sometimes men,
sometimes women.

315
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:27,394
You can tell 'em 'cause
they all wear the same ear pieces.

316
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,313
That and the... black suits.

317
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,150
- Kind of like... uh...
- [chuckles]

318
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,153
Got any idea who these suits were?

319
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,780
[sighs] No.

320
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:39,614
Uh, but they had their run of the place

321
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,910
and they were the ones
that pushed for the, uh, the DNR.

322
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,078
- A "do not resuscitate"?
- Yeah.

323
00:20:45,162 --> 00:20:47,205
They had the paperwork.

324
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,332
And I was there when the doctor
pulled the plug.

325
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,752
[stammers] I... I'm confused.

326
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,171
You're saying this guy died?

327
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:56,506
Yeah, for about a minute.

328
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:57,632
[stammers]

329
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:00,427
It's crazy, but they say
it happens sometimes.

330
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,764
You know, one minute,
flatline, then boom.

331
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:05,849
His heart starts back up again.

332
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:07,935
On its own.

333
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,396
He just didn't wanna die.

334
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:13,690
Within ten minutes of being awake...

335
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:17,152
[stutters] he reaches up
and grabs my scrubs,

336
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:20,864
yanks me down,
and says, real close...

337
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,160
"Take me home."

338
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,579
I shouldn't have done it.

339
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,748
I shouldn't have done it.
I should've known it'd get me fired.

340
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,294
His home.

341
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:37,755
Do you have an address?

342
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,803
- [indistinct chatter]
- [carnival music playing]

343
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,742
[Rory] Nice night.

344
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:54,541
I'm not alone.

345
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,130
You wanna come with us?

346
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,758
Or you wanna make a mess?

347
00:23:12,976 --> 00:23:14,102
[both grunting]

348
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:20,817
Don't shoot!

349
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,235
We want him alive!

350
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,447
[Frank] Who, who needs me alive?

351
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,115
- [Rory] Drop it! Drop it!
- Drop it!

352
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,617
Calm down! Everyone, calm down!
No one shoot!

353

00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:44,882
[Finn] Well, thanks
for thinning out the herd.

356
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,721
You're surrounded, son.

357
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,350
Now be a good lad and drop the iron.

358
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,519
[breathing heavily]

359
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,106
[Finn] Come on.

360
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:01,399
You seem like a smart one.

361
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:04,194
[groaning]

362
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:31,513
[man speaking indistinctly on radio]

363
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,019
- Tell Carter we're about done here.
- Got it.

364
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,812
We're finishing up the murder scene
at Stanley's bar. Over.

365
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:41,814
- [man on radio] <i>Copy.</i>

366
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,139
[Daredevil] I need to know
what happened here.

367
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:16,516
I'm not telling you shit.

368
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,436
You helped us catch Fisk,
that don't make us friends.

369
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,855
[Daredevil] Was this the Punisher?

370
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:25,400
Jesus.

371
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:26,818
The Irish, okay?

372
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,529
To find the Punisher.
They put a bounty on his head.

373
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,240
Now people all over the Kitchen
are getting hurt.

374
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:34,159
It's the goddamn Wild West out there.

375
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:36,035
[Daredevil] Have the Irish found him?

376
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:38,455
As long as we keep getting
calls like this, I guess not.

377
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:42,459
Hey, stay out of it.
You hear me?

378
00:25:42,542 --> 00:25:45,545
- I just wanna help, Sergeant.
- No, you can't help.

379
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:49,132
You're the problem!
'Cause of you, the uniform means dick.

380
00:25:49,216 --> 00:25:52,510
Cops are no longer preventing crime,
we're just chasing it.

381
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:55,180
Mopping up the mess
that you people leave in your wake.

382
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,515
We're on the same side,
you and I.

383
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,434
You're on your own side.

Who did this?

395
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,836
People you don't mess with.

396
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:54,257
You're bleeding out.
And I got all night.

397
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:55,425

Who did it?

400
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:04,601
The one they call Punisher.

401
00:28:04,684 --> 00:28:06,853
- Where is he?
- [laughs]

402
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,857
It doesn't matter
'cause when we're done with him,

403
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,484
he's as good as dead.

404
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,153
- That's helpful.
- [screaming]

405

[Frank breathing heavily]

You're dying tonight.

The hole's been dug.

415
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:10,583
But I'm giving you one chance
to meet your maker

took some time perfecting it.

[grunts]

438
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:58,525
Don't think you're showing me something
I haven't seen before,

439
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:00,026
'cause your killing spree

440

of a man seeking retribution.

[breathing heavily]

531
00:38:41,237 --> 00:38:42,529
You wanted this.

532
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:45,199
No, I counted on it.

533
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:47,618
Now I can ask you face to face.

534
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:51,038
Who was there that day?
Who killed my family?

535
00:38:51,122 --> 00:38:53,290
- Your family?
- Yeah.

536
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,583
- Who cares?
- [man] Move!

537
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,128
- Move! Go, go, go!
- [gunshot]

538
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:00,547
[man] Shoot that son of a bitch!

539
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,633
[groans]

540
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:09,265
[panting]

541
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,892
[man 1] We got him! Come on!
[man 2] Yeah!

542
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:14,020
- [man 1] Get down here!
- [softly] One batch, two batch.

543
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:16,480
Penny and dime.

544
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,814
[grunts]

545
00:39:25,822 --> 00:39:26,908
[grunts]

546
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:28,951
- [panting]
- [door closes]

547
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:38,710
They're gonna pay.
Every single goddamn one of 'em.

548
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:39,962
They will.

549
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:42,798
But not tonight. Move.

550
00:39:42,882 --> 00:39:45,009
[man] There! That room there.

551
00:39:50,139 --> 00:39:51,807
[grunting]

552
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:11,743
[grunts]

553
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:17,041
- No killing.
- Altar boy.

554
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:25,424
[breathing heavily]

555
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,052
All right,
let's get out of here.

556
00:40:29,178 --> 00:40:30,846
[grunting]

557
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:37,103
[vehicle approaching]

558
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:09,914
- [vehicle approaching]
- [gasps]

559
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:24,733
[vehicle doors closing]

560
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,319
[breathing heavily]

561
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:31,532
- [Frank groaning]
- [Daredevil grunting]

562
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,173
[Daredevil] Come on.

563
00:41:56,807 --> 00:41:58,184
[both panting]

564
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:07,984
[panting] Hey.

565
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:11,822
Not bad.

566
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:13,740
[chuckles] Thanks.

567
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:16,702
I guess I, uh...

568
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:19,163
I guess I was wrong.

569
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,165
About?

570
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,043
About you being a pussy.

571
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:26,087
Don't get all sweet on me now, Frank.

572
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,338
[chuckles]

573
00:42:27,421 --> 00:42:29,381
[coughing]

574
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,802
- Help's on the way.
- Nah.

575
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,346
You should go.

576
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:39,808
I'm past saving.

577
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,935
At least I'd have company, right?

578
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,604
[chuckles]

579
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,440
I think I might cash out.

580
00:42:50,611 --> 00:42:52,613
You'd have made a hell of a Marine, Red.

581
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:56,700
That rhyme.

582
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:00,829
- What's it mean?
- What'd you say?

583
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,999
- Huh?
- Thing you say.

584
00:43:04,083 --> 00:43:06,210
Right before you pull the trigger.

585
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:09,004
[softly] What do you...

586
00:43:09,088 --> 00:43:10,297
You heard that?

587
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,674
Yeah, I heard it.

588
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:14,218
What the...

589
00:43:15,177 --> 00:43:16,220
[sighs]

590
00:43:17,471 --> 00:43:19,014
I gotta say, sometimes...

591
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:22,976
Sometimes I think
you really just might be the devil.

592
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,230
Sometimes I think I might be, too.

593
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:29,858
It's, uh...

594
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,320
One batch, two batch.

595
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:36,657
Penny and dime, you know.

596
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,161
It was her favorite book.

597
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:45,416
You know, you...

598
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,836
You gotta cross the ocean... and go fight.

599
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,004
You see...

600
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,925
whole time you're thinking
you're gonna be scared, right?

601
00:43:55,008 --> 00:43:57,010
But then, you're not.

602
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:00,431
See, that part of it was
always easy for me.

603
00:44:01,432 --> 00:44:02,558
Killing.

604
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:06,395
Even watching my buddies die,
it just...

605
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:07,938
it didn't mean nothing.

606
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,567
[scoffs] The first time I got scared...

607
00:44:12,776 --> 00:44:15,196
was on a plane on the way home.

608
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:20,659
I kept thinking God was gonna pull the rug
out from under us, you know?

609
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,953
Shit, that's his kind of funny, you know.

610
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:28,709
But the plane landed safe
and we were home.

611
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,377
Driving through traffic.

612
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:34,548
Yeah, you pass fast food
and donut shops and all that...

613
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:35,757
that greasy shit.

614
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:39,010
It's the shit you fought to protect
and then the car stops.

615
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:43,640
We were outside her school.

616
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:45,726
I get to her classroom, right?

617
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:49,646
She's in there...

618
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,691
but she's got no idea.

619
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,528
She's got no idea that Daddy's home.

620
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:02,493
I walk in, these kids,
they're not even studying, they're...

621
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:05,412
[chuckles] doing some kind of yoga. Yeah.

622
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:07,789
[chuckles] You know?

623
00:45:07,873 --> 00:45:09,082
She's there.

624
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:11,877
She's doing her poses,
you know.

625
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,797
She's bending and,
you know, she's moving.

626
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:17,716
She looks like a flower.

627
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,510
Yeah.

628
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:21,177
And, you know,
you can't even understand it,

629
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:23,305
you know, how does
something like that have...

630
00:45:24,723 --> 00:45:26,517
How does something that beautiful...

631
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:28,852
How does that...

632
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:32,606
does that come from me, you know?

633
00:45:34,608 --> 00:45:36,693
And she looks up and she sees me.

634
00:45:39,696 --> 00:45:40,906
I see her.

635
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,827
By God, that's real.

636
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,039
That's real, Red.

637
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,291
Boom.

638
00:45:50,374 --> 00:45:52,459
In an instant,
she's across that classroom floor,

639
00:45:52,543 --> 00:45:54,210
she's in my arms.

640
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:59,675
She's squeezing me so tight,
I swear I was gonna bust a rib, you know?

641
00:46:01,343 --> 00:46:03,387
We just stayed there like that,
we're holding each other.

642
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:06,264
Teacher, she's filming the whole thing
on her phone, you know,

643
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:09,017
she's gonna put it on
YouTube or some shit.

644
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,103
She can't hold the thing steady,
because, you know, she's...

645
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:14,815
she's bawling so hard,
and the kids are all wailing,

646
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:16,149
you know, they're screaming.
And me?

647
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:18,151
Shit, I'm the worst of all.
I'm a...

648
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:21,613
I'm a rubber-face clown,
you know.

649
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:23,281
I cried so hard.

650
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,330
But not my baby.

651
00:46:29,413 --> 00:46:30,831
Not my girl.

652
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:33,667
You know,
she's my girl. She's...

653
00:46:35,836 --> 00:46:37,963
She's not crying,
she's holding me up.

654
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:42,300
My girl,
she's keeping me on my feet.

655
00:46:44,345 --> 00:46:46,347
[breath trembling]

656
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,266
She says,
"I knew it, Daddy. I knew it."

657
00:46:52,436 --> 00:46:55,522
And then we go home.
Wife, the boy.

658
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:57,691
Place is the exact same.

659
00:46:57,774 --> 00:47:01,528
It's like it was just holding its breath
waiting for me to get back, you know?

660
00:47:04,573 --> 00:47:05,907
Then it hit me.

661
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:08,869
All of it, you know.

662
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:14,165
The first time I felt how tired I was,
you know, I was just...

663
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:17,127
tired, you know?

664
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:22,007
[stammers] You...

665
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,092
You ever been tired, Red?

666
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,178
Yeah.

667
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:28,764
So, you know.

668
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:31,892
It's just, I couldn't do nothing,
you know?

669
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:33,602
All the things...

670
00:47:37,648 --> 00:47:39,858
I couldn't take my wife to bed.

671
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,779
Ball with the boy. Shit...

672
00:47:43,862 --> 00:47:47,073
I was too tired, I couldn't even drink
a goddamn beer, you know.

673
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,451
But not her.

674
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:52,788
My girl was up.

675
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:55,999
See, she wanted me to, uh...

676
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,252
she wanted me to tuck her in.
She... [sighs]

677
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,547
She outgrew it, she knew it,
but she didn't care.

678
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,131
She wanted it.

679
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,011
She had that book.

680
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:13,975
Her favorite book was out on the pillows.

681
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:18,354
<i>One Batch, Two Batch...
Penny and Dime.</i>

682
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:19,440
Yeah.

683
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:22,192
I read her that book every night
before this shit.

684
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,653
I read it every single night,
but, see, that was over now

685
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:26,738
because Daddy's home now.

686
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:33,286
She looked at me and she begged me, Red.

687
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:36,623
She begged.

688
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:39,292
She begged.

689
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,963
[mumbling indistinctly]

690
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,049
I said, "No.

691
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,389
Daddy's too tired, see.

692
00:48:55,517 --> 00:48:56,810
[voice breaking] But I'll...

693
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,895
I'll read to you tomorrow night.

694
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:04,901
[sniffles] I'll read to you
tomorrow night, I promise." Yeah.

695
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:09,447
Never think that...

696
00:49:10,574 --> 00:49:13,494
for her there was not gonna be
any tomorrow, see.

697
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:18,081
The last time I'd see her,

698
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:21,001
I'd be holding her lifeless body
in my arms.

699
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,256
Meat was spilling out of her, Red.

700
00:49:27,591 --> 00:49:29,593
The place where her face used to be.

701
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,474
Yeah.

702
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:41,855
I think I'm done... Red.

703
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:44,315
- [sirens wailing in distance]
- I think I'm done.

704
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:53,575
[gun cocking]

705
00:49:54,743 --> 00:49:56,369
Police. Don't move.

706
00:49:57,913 --> 00:49:59,122
Hands where I can see 'em.

707
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,249
- [gun cocking]
- Shots fired.

708
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:02,959
Bodies, mayhem and shit.

709
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:04,711
How come I just knew it had to be you?

710
00:50:04,795 --> 00:50:06,755
I have something for you, Sergeant.

711
00:50:07,714 --> 00:50:09,174
[breathing heavily] That's him?

712
00:50:10,551 --> 00:50:12,594
- Cover him and get EMS.
- Yep.

713
00:50:12,678 --> 00:50:16,848
And you,
you incredible pain in my ass.

714
00:50:16,932 --> 00:50:18,183
You're under arrest.

715
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:19,685
Get him help.

716
00:50:19,768 --> 00:50:20,811
Shut up.

717
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:23,271
- Take the collar.
- What?

718
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:24,522
You heard me.

719
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,734
You caught him, not me.

720
00:50:27,818 --> 00:50:29,570
It can't be me,
it has to be you.

721
00:50:30,862 --> 00:50:32,280
Why?

722
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,575
To protect the Kitchen.

723
00:50:34,658 --> 00:50:35,867
For law, for order.

724
00:50:36,785 --> 00:50:38,036
You're telling me
how to file a report now?

725
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,329
Yeah. Take the collar.

726
00:50:39,412 --> 00:50:40,747
Take the credit.
Get a promotion, if you can.

727
00:50:40,831 --> 00:50:42,031
- You've earned it.
- Bullshit.

728
00:50:42,082 --> 00:50:44,292
No, people have to know the system works.

729
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,336
Not his justice and not mine.

730
00:50:47,212 --> 00:50:50,716
Vigilante days are done in this town.
The police are in charge.

731
00:50:53,051 --> 00:50:54,427
That's not how it happened.

732
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,722
Then make it how it happened.

733
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:00,684
[Brett] Shit.

734
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:04,395
[officer] EMT and backup on the way.
Two minutes out.

735
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,982
Go.

736
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:08,149
Go!

737
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,361
I don't know what you are...

738
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:14,239
- but I know you ain't him.
- [thunder rumbling]

739
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:57,949
[newscaster on TV] <i>Frank Castle,</i>

740
00:51:58,033 --> 00:52:00,326
<i>the gunman wanted in connection
with the Metro-General shooting</i>

741
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:02,913
<i>and linked to dozens

742
00:52:02,996 --> 00:52:06,166
<i>throughout Hell's Kitchen

743
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:07,834
<i>outside Saint Michael's Cemetery.</i>

744
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:11,379
<i>An NYPD spokesman says, "Tonight,
New York has Sergeant Brett Mahoney</i>

745
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,339
<i>of the 15th Precinct to thank."</i>

746
00:52:13,423 --> 00:52:15,383
Gotta hand it to Brett.

747
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,928
I'm glad people like him
are looking out for Hell's Kitchen.

748
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:19,012
Yeah.

749
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:21,639
And I'm glad someone
was looking out for him.

750
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:25,643
Press are calling Castle
"a cold-blooded psychopath."

751
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,853
The DA's gonna have a hell of a time

752
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:29,189
using his prosecution
to turn herself into a hero.

753
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:31,274
It's all working out perfectly.

754
00:52:31,983 --> 00:52:34,069
- Wow, way to bring us down.
- I'm... [groans]

755
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:35,987
[chuckles] Hey, Josie,
would you mind turning the TV off?

756
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:37,572
It's upsetting some of the regulars.

757
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,949
[scoffs]

758
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:41,659
I think we've had enough Punisher
for one evening.

759
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:43,619
- Hmm. Okay. I'll drink to that.
- All right?

760
00:52:43,704 --> 00:52:47,415
To Brett and... a safe Hell's Kitchen.

761
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:50,210
- Hear, hear.
- [Karen chuckles] Mmm-hmm.

762
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,421
- Oh.
- [Matt grunts]

763
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,131
- I'm gonna get us another round.
- Good.

764
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:56,549
I hope you two saved room for shots.

765
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:57,884
- [Matt] Same again.
- Oh, no, no.

766
00:52:57,968 --> 00:53:00,303
- [chuckles] Oh, shots.
- [Karen chuckles]

767
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,596
Thanks, Fog.

768
00:53:06,977 --> 00:53:08,186
Hey.

769
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:10,981
You okay?

770
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:13,441
Yeah.

771
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,570
- Okay, that wasn't convincing, was it?
- [chuckles]

772
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,905
Um...

773
00:53:19,823 --> 00:53:22,033
I don't know, I just, uh...

774
00:53:23,368 --> 00:53:25,620
days like today... [sighs]

775
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:29,040
remind me how precious life can be,
you know?

776
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,179
What's your brother like?

777
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,809
Um...

778
00:53:49,102 --> 00:53:50,561
Uh, he's sweet. He's...

779
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:52,272
a good brother.
[chuckles softly]

780
00:53:57,610 --> 00:53:59,112
[exhales]

781
00:54:08,204 --> 00:54:09,747
Careful, Matt.

782
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:12,042
What's that?

783
00:54:12,125 --> 00:54:15,170
Keep going like this,
you just might end up happy.

784
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,713
And for a Catholic boy,
that's a pretty dangerous thing.

785
00:54:17,798 --> 00:54:18,840
[Matt chuckles]

786
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:21,717
I don't know what you're talking about.

787
00:54:21,802 --> 00:54:23,511
Godspeed, Matt Murdock.

788
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:24,930
Hey, where next?

789
00:54:25,013 --> 00:54:26,807
Home.

790
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:28,183
I'm gonna sleep for a week.

791
00:54:28,266 --> 00:54:29,517
Someone had the awful idea of doing shots.

792
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,601
[chuckles]

793
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:33,104
I think I've had enough excitement
for one evening.

794
00:54:33,188 --> 00:54:35,481
- See you two in the morning.
- Okay. Yeah.

795
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:37,775
- [Matt] See ya, Fog.
- Bye.

796
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:40,987
[sighs and chuckles]

797
00:54:50,872 --> 00:54:52,123
Do you mind the rain?

798
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:55,710
No.

799
00:55:06,096 --> 00:55:07,931
Then I'll walk you home.

800
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,601
[chuckles]

801
00:55:47,888 --> 00:55:49,805
[both chuckle]

802
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:16,791
[breath trembling]

803
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,971
- Can I take you to dinner?
- Yes.

804
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:15,683
- Tomorrow?
- [chuckles] Yes.

805
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:26,069
Good night, Karen.

806
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:30,781
Good night, Matt.

807
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:50,969
[car horn honks]

808
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,013
[chuckles]

809
00:58:43,646 --> 00:58:45,356
[breathing heavily]

810
00:58:48,234 --> 00:58:49,860
Hello, Matthew.

811
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,202
Elektra.

812
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:03,166
[dramatic music playing]
