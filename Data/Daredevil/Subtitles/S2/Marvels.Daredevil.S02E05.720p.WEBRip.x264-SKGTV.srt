00:00:32,476 --> 00:00:34,310
[retching]

4
00:00:34,393 --> 00:00:36,312
Oh, it tastes like fish eggs.

5
00:00:36,395 --> 00:00:37,856
- [Matt laughs]
- [coughs]

6
00:00:37,939 --> 00:00:39,983
[stammers] I think they are, Einstein.

7
00:00:40,066 --> 00:00:42,235
And it tops out at $200 an ounce.

8
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,529
You two really think
you can crash this party?

9
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:47,281
- Yes.
- We're kind of ambitious.

10
00:00:47,365 --> 00:00:49,743
- Are you gonna kick us out, bro?
- Depends.

11
00:00:49,826 --> 00:00:51,995
Are you pompous jackasses?

12
00:00:52,078 --> 00:00:54,080
Uh, well, we're not... pompous.

13
00:00:54,163 --> 00:00:55,832
- [laughs]
- Help yourself.

14
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,252
Mmm, the taste kind of grows on you.

15
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:02,506
You wanna get down on this?
Pull up a stool.

16
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,508
Uh, you do that.
I'm gonna find the alcohol.

17
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,176
Genius! And grab me a beer!

18
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,845
[overlapping chatter]

19
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:12,015
[man] It's not a cabin cruiser,
it's a yacht.

20
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:14,100
[woman] For the $24,000
we're paying Dalton,

21
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:16,645
I would expect Jackson's
modern dance to be included.

22
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:18,730
I like the way
the Jets are playing this year.

23
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:20,857
[faint clinking]

24
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,496
[faint ringing]

00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,463
[slurping]

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,064
- Excuse me.
- It's time to go.

27
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:03,149
- [stammers] No, I'm just looking for...
- You found it.

28
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:04,776
Come on.

29
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:05,985
[Matt clears throat]

30
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,994
He's with me.

31
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:17,706
Excuse me.

[thunder rumbling]

35
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:38,494
Mmm! German beer.
Tastes like piss.

36
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:42,624
What the hell are you doing here?

37
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,751
You've never been hard to find.

38
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:46,878
That's not what I asked.

39
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,756
At least your furniture's improved.

40
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:53,051
Kinda liked my old futon.

41
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:55,720
I liked breaking it in.

42
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:57,722
Nice place.

43
00:03:57,806 --> 00:04:00,183
Too bad about the clothes, though.

44
00:04:00,266 --> 00:04:01,475
Why are you here?

45
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:02,894
[sighs]

46
00:04:04,437 --> 00:04:06,690
Would you believe it if I said
I missed you?

47
00:04:06,773 --> 00:04:08,482
- No.
- Smart man.

48
00:04:08,566 --> 00:04:10,985
Columbia education really paid off.

49
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,905
- No thanks to you.
- [laughs]

50
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:16,991
I'm in New York for a meeting.
I thought I'd pop by.

51
00:04:17,075 --> 00:04:19,452
Well, you're not staying here, so...

52
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:20,870
Fine.

53
00:04:20,954 --> 00:04:24,290
My penthouse in midtown
will just have to do, then.

54
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:25,583
We spent some nights there.

55
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,376
Look, if you came here
to walk down memory lane,

56
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:29,060
- I don't really have the...
- I'm sorry.

57
00:04:30,546 --> 00:04:35,384
I've spent years trying to convince myself
that things happen for a reason,

58
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:38,179
that you and I were not meant to be.

59
00:04:41,474 --> 00:04:44,518
But I know now.
That wasn't fate.

60
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:46,688
It was a choice.

61
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:49,607
My choice.

62
00:04:51,484 --> 00:04:52,819
And I'm sorry.

63
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:58,950
I'm alone in the world, Matthew.

64
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:02,245
Do you know what that feels like?

65
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:05,123
- [Matt scoffs]
- [chuckles]

66
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,416
Of course you do.

67
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:12,714
And you know what it's like
to clean up your father's messes.

68
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,051
A long time ago,
before he died,

69
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:20,096
my father did business
with the Roxxon Corporation.

70
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,180
Roxxon?

71
00:05:21,264 --> 00:05:24,142
Energy, cleaning supplies,
macaroni and cheese.

72
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:26,644
Child labor, slave trade.

73
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:28,271
They have their fingers in everything.

74
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:30,689
I believe it's called diversification.

75
00:05:30,774 --> 00:05:33,151
And thanks to my father's
shitty investments,

76
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:34,527
they hold most of his wealth.

77
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,653
Yeah, okay, I...

78
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:40,574
I have a meeting tomorrow with the board
at the Yakatomi Building.

79
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,536
And I need your help, Matthew.

80
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:45,663
How am I supposed to help you?

81
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:48,416
I want you to use that expensive
legal training of yours

82
00:05:48,499 --> 00:05:50,960
- to help me get my money back.
- See, I'm a defense lawyer.

83
00:05:51,044 --> 00:05:53,838
- I'll pay you well.
- [laughs] I'm not taking your money.

84
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:56,715
And, even if I accepted,
there's not enough time.

85
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,010
- For what?
- Oh, just research.

86
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,304
Accounts, shareholders,
hierarchy of the...

87
00:06:01,387 --> 00:06:04,432
- You have 15 hours.
- Fifteen hours, Elektra, are you insane?

88
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:05,766
Matthew.

89
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,644
[sighs]

90
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,564
You're the only person I can trust.

91
00:06:11,647 --> 00:06:15,776
Well, sweetheart, you don't break into
my house and then talk to me about trust.

92
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,695
Don't overthink it.

93
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,114
It's just a bunch of guys
in business suits.

94
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,241
They won't know what hit them.

95
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,660
Would be fun, like old times.

96
00:06:24,743 --> 00:06:27,872
Oh, you and I,
we have very different ideas of fun.

97
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:29,332
You can say whatever you want.

98
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:31,918
- But I know you...
- No, you don't.

99
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:33,127
You don't, not anymore.

100
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:36,840
Not... ever again.

101
00:06:41,886 --> 00:06:43,804
[softly] Well...

102
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:45,681
that's disappointing.

103
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,435
Get out.

104
00:06:54,983 --> 00:06:56,442
[door opens]

105
00:06:57,693 --> 00:07:00,738
- [door closes]
- [muttering indistinctly]

106
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:08,371
[Matt] Morning.

107
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:11,332
We, uh, have anything for breakfast?

108
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:12,750
You hungry or hungover?

109
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:16,670
- Both.
- [laughs]

110
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:20,758
All right, you need some potassium,
some electrolytes, and a jolt of caffeine.

111
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:22,927
I'll give you, uh...

112
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,220
[snaps fingers]

113
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:28,141
The last piece of Mrs. DiNizio's
peach cobbler,

114
00:07:28,224 --> 00:07:30,977
which is the last piece of anything
in this office.

115
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,812
I guess our finances
haven't improved since last week.

116
00:07:33,897 --> 00:07:37,233
Yeah, well, clients don't respond well
to a "closed" sign.

117
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:38,401
[sighs]

118
00:07:39,485 --> 00:07:40,486
Yeah, it's my fault.

119
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,571
- I'm sorry, Foggy.
- Don't be.

120
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:43,990
Punisher off the street.

121
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:46,242
I'm hoping Reyes
will get her jackboot off our neck

122
00:07:46,325 --> 00:07:48,494
and this office can go back to normal.

123
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:51,122
Oh, yeah? Normal? What's that?

124
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:55,668
Matt. Uh, good morning.

125
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:56,920
[Matt] Hey, Karen.

126
00:07:57,962 --> 00:07:59,297
Did you sleep well?

127
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:01,925
Uh, not so much. You?

128
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:03,801
Me? Yeah, sure.

129
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,094
I mean...

130
00:08:06,095 --> 00:08:07,430
Is that coffee I can smell?

131
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:09,390
- Hmm?
- [Matt] Coffee.

132
00:08:09,473 --> 00:08:10,892
[stammers] Uh, yeah, um...

133
00:08:10,975 --> 00:08:13,019
Yeah, arabica for all.

134
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,980
- [laughs] For everyone.
- Wow, thank you. You're a goddess.

135
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:18,607
[Foggy] Okay, you two.
Let's talk business.

136
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:20,734
Potential clients. Real ones.
With bank in the bank.

137
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:23,947
Uh, actually, yeah, can we, uh...
talk about these first?

138
00:08:24,822 --> 00:08:27,616
The, uh, press is still painting Castle

139
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,661
like he's nothing more than
some deranged lunatic.

140
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:33,624
[Foggy] Well, it's not like our boy was
out collecting for the Red Cross.

141
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:36,834
- I know. I know, but...
- You think there's more to the story.

142
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:39,170
Exactly. I mean, five different papers

143
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:41,089
and not a word about the bullet
he took to the brain,

144
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,840
or his military record, or his family.

145
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,883
Uh, his family?

146
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:48,137
[Karen] Um...

147
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:49,305
Okay, uh...

148
00:08:50,556 --> 00:08:51,849
I found this photograph.

149
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,310
It's of him and his wife and kids
at the carousel.

150
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:55,728
[Matt] You found it where?

151
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,564
I sort of broke into his house.

152
00:08:58,647 --> 00:08:59,565
- You did what?
- What?

153
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,734
- It was ill-advised, I know.
- Not to mention dangerous.

154
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:03,417
- And illegal.
- [Karen stammers] Yeah...

155
00:09:03,486 --> 00:09:04,612
It's all that. All of that.

156
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:07,698
And I don't need a lecture or I will
take those coffees back, okay?

157
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:10,034
[scoffs]

158
00:09:10,118 --> 00:09:11,244
Thank you.

159
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,998
Look, it's not just about the press.

160
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:18,334
The DA's office released their statement
and it's full of holes, too.

161
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:21,795
Something big is going on here, guys,
and it all circles back to Frank Castle.

162
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,214
- Oh, no, no, no...
- Foggy...

163
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,967
No, come on, we successfully dodged
a metaphorical bullet

164
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,343
and quite a few literal ones.

165
00:09:27,426 --> 00:09:30,179
We need to be done with the crazy, guys.

166
00:09:30,263 --> 00:09:31,805
We need normal.

167
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:38,271
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:41,774
I'm really sorry if I...

169
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:43,817
- I pushed it too far.
- It's okay.

170
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,486
[chuckling] I just...

171
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:48,364
Uh, I don't think you're wrong
about Castle, but...

172
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,034
it's really simple, Karen.

173
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:52,868
Just... I don't want you to get hurt.

174
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:58,541
So, uh...

175
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:00,334
Last night. [chuckles softly]

176
00:10:00,418 --> 00:10:01,794
Last night?

177
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:05,006
I don't... What happened last night?

178
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:06,424
- At Josie's? With Foggy?
- [Karen laughs] You...

179
00:10:06,507 --> 00:10:07,633
- Did something happen?
- Yeah.

180
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:09,385
- Anything else? I don't...
- Yeah?

181
00:10:09,468 --> 00:10:10,594
[Matt laughs]

182
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:13,931
[softly] Yeah, it was great.

183
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,728
And I like to think I can do better,
if we're still on for dinner.

184
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:21,189
Uh, yeah.

185
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,898
It's a date.

186
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:24,317
[Foggy] Holy shit!

187
00:10:25,943 --> 00:10:27,903
- That was the bank.
- Oh, no.

188
00:10:27,986 --> 00:10:30,906
No, it's... all good.
There was a deposit.

189
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:32,575
A big one.

190
00:10:32,658 --> 00:10:34,535
[nervously] What? Uh...

191
00:10:34,618 --> 00:10:36,954
Um, yeah...

192
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:39,540
Yeah, uh, do me a favor,
don't spend any of it.

193
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:40,958
- Why not?
- God...

194
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,961
I was hit up by a potential client
yesterday, so, I just...

195
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:45,796
[Foggy] Is it dirty money?
Are we doing that again?

196
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,673
No! No, it's nothing like that.
It's just, um...

197
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:49,876
[stammers] I'm not sure
it's gonna work out, let me...

198
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,010
Let me get into it, I'll...
I'll get back to you.

199
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:59,268
Hey, I'm gonna have a Macallan, neat,
and the lady will have, uh...

200
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:01,562
another vodka martini.

201
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,939
- Perceptive.
- Thank you, I try.

202
00:11:04,022 --> 00:11:05,691
But I can order my own drinks.

203
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,694
Tequila. Mezcal, if you have it.

204
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:13,282
[sighs deeply] So, thanks for your help.

205
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:16,076
It's hard to find reliable
security these days.

206
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:19,163
[Matt chuckles]

207
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:20,706
Nice shoes.

208
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,166
What?

209
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,378
Wingtips. Good call.
Shine them yourself?

210
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:27,880
[laughs] How'd you know?

211
00:11:28,714 --> 00:11:30,466
You're not exactly a tough read.

212
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:32,468
I...

213
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:33,886
could surprise you.

214
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,139
Doubt it.

215
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:38,307
All right.

216
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,602
You, uh, wanna give it a try?

217
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:44,980
Okay.

218
00:11:45,063 --> 00:11:47,525
You desperately want
to belong somewhere...

219
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,027
with someone,

220
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,281
which is the real reason why
you sneak into fancy faculty parties.

221
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,616
Not because you're sick of your ramen

222
00:11:55,699 --> 00:11:57,576
- and video games routine.
- [Matt chuckles]

223
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:02,122
And now, your mind is racing.

224
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:08,254
You're wondering what you can possibly
say or do to keep me on the line,

225
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:12,049
because the last thing you want
is to spend the rest of the evening

226
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,052
with that scotch
and that shaggy-haired friend of yours.

227
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,220
[Matt laughs]

228
00:12:17,596 --> 00:12:19,265
You know what your problem is?

229
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:20,391
You're pretty.

230
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:23,101
You even work the blind thing.

231
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:24,312
But you're dumb.

232
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,897
You lost before you even
stepped to the plate.

233
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,321
You get all of that
from a pair of old wingtips?

234
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,781
Quick study.

235
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:43,706
- You wanna know what I think?
- [groans] Tell me.

236
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:46,584
I think the game's just beginning.

237
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,337
[chuckling]

238
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,381
Because despite your artisan tequilas

239
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:54,675
and charm-school manners...

240
00:12:55,926 --> 00:13:00,473
Despite being richer than God and having
the whole world at your fingertips...

241
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,976
you're just bored.

242
00:13:06,729 --> 00:13:07,730
Really?

243
00:13:07,813 --> 00:13:11,024
Bored enough to spend your time
studying a stranger's shoes.

244
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:18,073
See, I think you were dying on the vine
of this tight-ass party,

245
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:21,410
because Daddy's money can't buy you
the one thing you really need.

246
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:25,539
And what's that?

247
00:13:25,623 --> 00:13:27,416
The unexpected.

248
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,881
Maybe you're not so dumb.

249
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:36,759
Elektra Natchios.

250
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,886
Matt Murdock.

251
00:13:44,558 --> 00:13:45,976
Let's go, Matthew.

252
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:49,522
[car alarm chirps]

253
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,567
[Matt laughs]

254
00:13:55,027 --> 00:13:56,279
On your left.

255
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:07,290
[engine roars]

256
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:11,251
- [Matt laughs]
- Do you like it?

257
00:14:11,335 --> 00:14:13,754
- [engine roars]
- Sounds expensive.

258
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,255
You have good ears.

259
00:14:19,009 --> 00:14:21,679
- Is it yours?
- It is.

260
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,013
Until we get caught.

261
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:24,890
[engine revving]

262
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:34,900
[Karen] Mr. Tower?

263
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:37,945
Uh, I wish you'd called.
I'd have set something up.

264
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:41,073
- Are they in?
- Uh, just the Nelson half.

265
00:14:41,156 --> 00:14:42,366
What's the problem?

266
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,867
We need to talk.

267
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:45,828
In private.

268
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,628
You know, it's really not
a good idea to piss her off.

269
00:14:55,754 --> 00:14:58,632
So, what can I do
for the Assistant District Attorney?

270
00:14:58,716 --> 00:15:01,385
It's more what I can do for you,
Mr. Nelson.

271
00:15:01,469 --> 00:15:03,471
We need all your files on the Grote case.

272
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,515
Notes, interviews, any and all
recordings and e-mails.

273
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,016
And in return, we get...

274
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,602
I convince District Attorney Reyes

275
00:15:09,685 --> 00:15:12,355
to scratch the names Nelson
and Murdock off her shit-list.

276
00:15:12,438 --> 00:15:14,106
Wow.

277
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,774
There's an actual list?

278
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:16,984
- Mr. Nelson, I...
- I'm sorry.

279
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:20,863
Believe me, the sooner this Punisher
mess is off our plate, the better.

280
00:15:20,946 --> 00:15:23,616
So... show me a subpoena, and...

281
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:25,618
[sighs]

282
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:27,119
Is there a problem?

283
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:33,291
Are you really going to make me
jump through hoops for this?

284
00:15:33,376 --> 00:15:37,838
Trust me, there's nothing I'd rather do
more than cooperate with your office.

285
00:15:37,921 --> 00:15:41,384
But a legal firm sharing privileged
communications with a client,

286
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:43,761
I mean, even a deceased one,
without a court order?

287
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:46,347
I've seen lawyers get disbarred for less.

288
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,976
And I don't know about you, but I worked
really hard for my law degree.

289
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,686
Nights and everything.

290
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,777
Reyes...

291
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,114
she staked all her political chips
on the conviction of this Punisher freak.

292
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:06,492
Now, if things'll go her way,

293
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:08,994
there'll be an opening
in the District Attorney's office

294
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:10,621
in the not-so-distant future.

295
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:13,916
And DA Tower has a nice ring to it.

296
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:17,294
Now, I'd start considering
the benefits that could accrue

297
00:16:17,378 --> 00:16:19,422
if your firm were more...

298
00:16:19,505 --> 00:16:20,714
cooperative.

299
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:24,301
[clicks tongue] Like I said...

300
00:16:24,385 --> 00:16:27,971
show me a subpoena,
and I'll cooperate like a son of a bitch.

301
00:16:32,768 --> 00:16:34,895
Reyes is gonna roll over you like a tank.

302
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:36,229
You keep saying that.

303
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,731
And yet...

304
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,358
still kinda here.

305
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:50,828
[beeps]

306
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,333
[metal detector humming]

307
00:16:58,168 --> 00:16:59,169
[beeps]

308
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,360
I'm gonna have to pay for that.

309
00:17:23,444 --> 00:17:24,820
[Elektra] I'll stake you.

310
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:28,491
So this is the famous Fogwell's.

311
00:17:28,574 --> 00:17:30,618
Yeah, breathe it in fast.

312
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:35,831
If we get arrested for breaking
and entering, the fun kinda stops.

313
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:37,207
[Elektra] Shows what you know.

314
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,543
I haven't been here in a while.

315
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,796
I bet nothing's moved.

316
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:46,884
[chuckles]

317
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:50,471
- Thanks.
- So tell me.

318
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:54,266
- How does a blind man box?
- Oh, uh...

319
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:56,602
[chuckling] I don't...
I can't.

320
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:58,604
My dad, he was the boxer.

321
00:17:58,687 --> 00:18:00,313
Was?

322
00:18:00,397 --> 00:18:02,357
Yeah, he died.

323
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,567
I'm sorry.

324
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:07,905
I just come here to...
breathe in the smell of sweat.

325
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:09,114
[inhales deeply]

326
00:18:09,197 --> 00:18:12,034
Hear the clank of the chains
holding the bags.

327
00:18:12,117 --> 00:18:13,451
Remember him.

328
00:18:15,203 --> 00:18:17,581
You never saw your father fight.

329
00:18:17,665 --> 00:18:21,209
Oh, I saw him get his ass beat
more times than I can count.

330
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,380
I wasn't born blind.
That's a...

331
00:18:25,463 --> 00:18:26,882
whole other story.

332
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,139
Did he die in the ring?

333
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:36,684
Uh...

334
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:39,061
No, boxing didn't kill him.

335
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:40,228
What did?

336
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:42,981
Organized crime.

337
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:45,901
Like a mob hit?

338
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:49,738
- Was he a criminal?
- [chuckles] No.

339
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:53,554
But I guess you could say he rubbed
some people the wrong way.

340
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,328
Someone in particular?

341
00:18:59,915 --> 00:19:01,584
[Matt] Uh, yeah.

342
00:19:02,918 --> 00:19:05,754
A guy named Roscoe Sweeney.

343
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,238
I don't know if he pulled the trigger,
but he gave the order.

344
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:11,343
Did you ever try to find
that piece of shit?

345
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,096
Yeah, once. When I was a kid.

346
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,432
[grunts] Got nothing.
Learned to live with it.

347
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,935
He probably went underground.

348
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:21,729
Well, six feet, I hope.

349
00:19:24,064 --> 00:19:26,066
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

350
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:27,400
I don't.

351
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,277
Are you sure?

352
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:30,487
Yes.

353
00:19:32,364 --> 00:19:33,574
I've seen it.

354
00:19:33,657 --> 00:19:37,703
Here and there,
over the past few weeks.

355
00:19:38,954 --> 00:19:41,832
You're so much more than you let on.

356
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:43,125
[Matt laughs]

357
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,877
Okay.

358
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,962
I feel like I've told you more
in the last ten minutes

359
00:19:47,045 --> 00:19:49,547
than I've told anyone else in ten years.

360
00:19:49,632 --> 00:19:51,424
[grunts] Ha!

361
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,176
I knew it.

362
00:19:54,469 --> 00:19:56,513
- You knew what?
- [grunts]

363
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:00,601
[panting] You said you were blind.

364
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:02,603
No, you said I was blind.

365
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:04,647
So you can see?

366
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,064
It's complicated.

367
00:20:07,399 --> 00:20:08,441
[both grunting]

368
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:10,443
[Elektra panting]

369
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,114
What about you?
You said you took ballet lessons.

370
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:15,240
I did.

371
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:16,574
In the winters,

372
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:19,577
when my capoeira master
returned to Angola.

373
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,914
[both grunting]

374
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:25,793
[Elektra grunts]

375
00:20:25,876 --> 00:20:27,502
[Matt chuckles]

376
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:29,630
Muay Thai?

377
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:31,965
- Every other Thursday.
- Of course.

378
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:37,888
[chuckles] You got me.

379
00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:40,390
Get me back.

380
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:42,309
Get me! [grunts]

381
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:49,566
[both panting]

382
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,984
[Elektra] I win.

383
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:55,030
Yeah, first round, maybe.

384
00:20:56,198 --> 00:20:57,658
We're just getting started.

385
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:30,523
[both moan]

386
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:36,697
[Elektra breathing heavily]

387
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:04,307
[exhales deeply]

388
00:22:27,164 --> 00:22:28,832
[car horn honking]

389
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,556
[faint indistinct chatter]

390
00:23:12,918 --> 00:23:14,502
[elevator bell dings]

391
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:20,758
[elevator bell dings]

392
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:22,427
[elevator doors close]

393
00:23:25,597 --> 00:23:27,140
[indistinct chatter]

394
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:32,687
Ms. Natchios, good afternoon.

395
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,982
Good afternoon.
You can sit.

396
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,863
We hope you know how valuable
your business is

397
00:23:40,946 --> 00:23:42,655
to the Roxxon Corporation.

398
00:23:42,739 --> 00:23:43,740
[Elektra] Thank you.

399
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:48,203
[man] This is Stan Gibson.
He's the money man for our Japanese arm.

400
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:50,663
So, he'll have the answers
you're looking for.

401
00:23:50,747 --> 00:23:53,416
Whether or not he can put them
in terms you'll understand

402
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,710
is another matter. [laughs]

403
00:23:55,793 --> 00:23:57,087
[Elektra chuckles]

404
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,090
Let's all prepare to be dazzled, shall we?

405
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,426
[indistinct chatter]

406
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,141
- Excuse me, uh, Mr. Ellison?
- Yeah?

407
00:24:09,224 --> 00:24:11,059
Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt.
My name is Karen Page.

408
00:24:11,143 --> 00:24:12,727
- I was a friend of...
- Ben.

409
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,229
Yeah, I remember.

410
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:17,732
[Karen] Look, I think that
I owe you an apology.

411
00:24:17,815 --> 00:24:19,855
- At the funeral, I thought that you...
- Forget it.

412
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:22,862
Look, Ben... [sighs]

413
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:25,448
- Ben was a real pain in my ass.
- [Karen sighs]

414
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:28,160
So it follows that his friends
would be, too.

415
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:30,870
What can I do for you?

416
00:24:30,954 --> 00:24:33,081
Well, I don't think
you're gonna like my answer.

417
00:24:33,165 --> 00:24:34,917
I'd like to talk to you
about the Frank Castle article.

418
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,669
- I know, terrifying.
- Also inaccurate.

419
00:24:38,753 --> 00:24:40,755
[sighs] Look...

420
00:24:40,838 --> 00:24:43,633
that article was corroborated
by multiple sources.

421
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:47,095
NYPD, DA's office,
we even had some eyewitnesses.

422
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,181
Yes, everything that
you reported is correct.

423
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:50,848
It's what you haven't reported
that bothers me.

424
00:24:50,974 --> 00:24:52,976
The article is inaccurate by omission.

425
00:24:55,353 --> 00:24:56,896
Okay, come here, come here.

426
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,648
Excuse me, please.

427
00:24:58,731 --> 00:24:59,816
Go.

428
00:25:02,152 --> 00:25:05,530
Right, did you know that two years ago,
Lieutenant Frank Castle

429
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:07,824
was awarded the Navy Cross
for his service in Afghanistan, right?

430
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:09,742
That's second only
to the Medal of Honor.

431
00:25:09,826 --> 00:25:11,161
This guy is a war hero.

432
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,121
Military history
is the first thing we search

433
00:25:13,205 --> 00:25:15,165
whenever there's a mass shooting.

434
00:25:15,248 --> 00:25:19,086
So, we know that he was a Marine recruit,
and we know that he went in as a kid,

435
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:21,421
but there's no evidence
that he actually served.

436
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:23,340
I've seen the medal,

437
00:25:23,423 --> 00:25:24,841
engraved with Castle's name,

438
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,177
next to a photograph of him
shaking the secretary's hand.

439
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:30,847
Are you suggesting
that his work was classified?

440
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,141
[sighs] I don't know, but...
but I would assume.

441
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:35,185
Don't assume. Where'd you see it?

442
00:25:36,394 --> 00:25:38,355
Uh, not important.

443
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:39,772
Pretty important.

444
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:41,899
Look, your article also states
that he had no known relatives,

445
00:25:41,984 --> 00:25:43,651
but every paper in New York says that.

446
00:25:43,735 --> 00:25:46,779
Well, that was in the press briefing
issued by the DA's office.

447
00:25:46,863 --> 00:25:48,115
He had a family.

448
00:25:49,157 --> 00:25:52,702
He had a wife, Maria Elizabeth,
a daughter, Lisa Barbara,

449
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,621
and a son, Frank Junior.

450
00:25:55,663 --> 00:25:57,582
- Had?
- All dead.

451
00:25:57,665 --> 00:26:00,585
Killed around the same time
that Castle was hospitalized

452
00:26:00,668 --> 00:26:02,170
for a gunshot wound to the head.

453
00:26:02,254 --> 00:26:03,255
What, so...

454
00:26:03,338 --> 00:26:06,216
What, you're saying that he murdered
his family and then shot himself?

455
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:08,843
Some sort of PTSD murder-suicide attempt?

456
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:09,927
No, see, if that's what had happened,

457
00:26:10,012 --> 00:26:11,263
the DA would have put it in her brief,

458
00:26:11,346 --> 00:26:12,805
in flashing neon if she could,

459
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:15,767
because that supports her story
that he's a psychopath.

460
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:19,812
So, what do you think really happened?

461
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,150
[inhales deeply]
That's what I don't know yet.

462
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:26,361
But if I could dig through your files
or I could check into your back issues,

463
00:26:26,444 --> 00:26:27,904
maybe I could figure it out.

464
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:32,117
And anything that I find,
anything that I can prove...

465
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,036
The <i>Bulletin</i> gets the exclusive.

466
00:26:35,162 --> 00:26:36,288
Deal.

467
00:26:37,414 --> 00:26:38,623
Okay, deal.

468
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:42,169
Uh-uh... don't do any somersaults yet.

469
00:26:49,134 --> 00:26:51,053
[sighs] All the, uh...

470
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,596
All the servers were completely
wiped in the incident.

471
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,598
- [Karen sighs]
- [Ellison] Decades, just...

472
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:56,766
[imitates explosion] gone.

473
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:59,811
So, um, we keep hard copies
of everything now.

474
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:01,521
Jeez! Are they in any kind of order?

475
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:03,190
Um, you know, roughly.

476
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,442
I would... I would start, uh, down here.

477
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:07,402
- Okay. Uh, thanks.
- Uh-huh.

478
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,030
[Ellison laughs]

479
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:12,907
- [Karen] What?
- Oh...

480
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,618
Uh, nothing, I'm just thinking, uh,
somewhere...

481
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:19,372
Ben Urich is looking down,
and just... [sighs]

482
00:27:19,456 --> 00:27:21,749
- getting a real kick out of all this.
- [scoffs]

483
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:24,419
Have fun.

484
00:27:35,888 --> 00:27:38,725
[Elektra] I'm sure you all have
places to be, things to do.

485
00:27:38,808 --> 00:27:41,519
With your wives,
your mistresses...

486
00:27:41,603 --> 00:27:43,980
- [man chuckles]
- [Elektra] But I have questions.

487
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,360
And this subsidiary,
what is it exactly?

488
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:51,446
- [Stan] A medical company.
- And they do?

489
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:54,073
- [Stan] Studies.
- How specific.

490
00:27:54,157 --> 00:27:56,659
Research for pain relievers,
treatments for diseases.

491
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:59,537
[chuckling] The names of which
I mostly can't pronounce.

492
00:27:59,621 --> 00:28:01,831
[Elektra] How do you determine
your acquisitions?

493
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:03,833
- [Stan] Well...
- [cell phones ringing]

494
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:06,002
Excuse me.

495
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,634
There's an issue with our server.

496
00:28:12,717 --> 00:28:14,302
[in Japanese] Someone has
hacked into the server.

497
00:28:14,386 --> 00:28:17,139
Possibly internal, we don't know yet,
security is looking into it.

498
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:23,270
If it's an external threat,
I'm sure they can trace the IP address

499
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:28,150
and deal with the "problem" face-to-face.

500
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:32,069
But I'm more concerned
about what information

501
00:28:32,154 --> 00:28:38,201
they can pull from Roxxon's system
when it is offline.

502
00:28:38,285 --> 00:28:40,537
[man in English] I'm terribly sorry,
something has come up.

503
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,206
Could we reconvene at another time?

504
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,749
Absolutely.

505
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:47,127
Thank you.

506
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,255
[man] I'll have someone
escort you downstairs.

507
00:28:50,338 --> 00:28:51,839
[Elektra] Thank you.

508
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:54,717
In this city, a girl needs
all the help she can get. [chuckles]

509
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:00,356
- [indistinct chatter]
- [rock music playing]

510
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:03,393
[Foggy] Why is it gray?

511
00:29:03,476 --> 00:29:05,770
One of life's mysteries.

512
00:29:07,564 --> 00:29:08,690
[sighs]

513
00:29:14,904 --> 00:29:16,198
[sighs]

514
00:29:17,282 --> 00:29:19,284
They were out of olives.

515
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,828
[breathes deeply] So?

516
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,581
So...

517
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:26,374
[chuckles] What?

518
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:28,793
It was a hard day.

519
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:31,421
I thought we could catch up,
you know, have a drink.

520
00:29:31,504 --> 00:29:32,922
Just...

521
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,131
be like we were.

522
00:29:34,216 --> 00:29:35,883
Normal.

523
00:29:37,344 --> 00:29:39,179
I haven't heard from you in months.

524
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:41,639
Well, that's...

525
00:29:41,723 --> 00:29:43,516
not all that abnormal, right?

526
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,601
[inhales sharply]

527
00:29:45,518 --> 00:29:47,687
Yeah, I guess you're right.
[clears throat]

528
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:51,233
Let's get trashed and tell each other
our sob stories. You first.

529
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,485
Matt's dating our office assistant.

530
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:56,321
The cute one?
Blonde, totally your type?

531
00:29:56,404 --> 00:29:57,739
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

532
00:29:58,323 --> 00:29:59,574
The correct answer is,

533
00:29:59,657 --> 00:30:02,702
"No one is as perfect for me
as you, Marci."

534
00:30:02,785 --> 00:30:03,870
Gets worse.

535
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:05,788
We lost two clients in the last hour.

536
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,999
Oh, it's kinda like when I lost the job
at Landman and Zack.

537
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,877
- Thank God HC and B was hiring.
- No, I'm serious.

538
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,128
It's the DA.

539
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,715
I called her bluff on a case
she's building against the Punisher

540
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:16,883
and she doubled down.

541
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:18,843
She's coming after us.

542
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:20,512
I see.

543
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:23,765
You didn't call me for a social drink.

544
00:30:23,848 --> 00:30:25,600
You called me for help.

545
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:29,521
[sighs deeply] That feels more normal.

546
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:36,403
[sighs]

547
00:30:37,445 --> 00:30:38,571
Fine.

548
00:30:39,531 --> 00:30:40,615
[clears throat]

549
00:30:41,533 --> 00:30:43,785
Rumors among my new partners?

550
00:30:43,868 --> 00:30:45,870
Reyes has her sights
on the mayor's office.

551
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,207
- This is my shocked face.
- [scoffs]

552
00:30:50,292 --> 00:30:52,419
And she aims to do so by...

553
00:30:52,502 --> 00:30:55,380
building a platform
on Frank Castle's conviction.

554
00:30:55,463 --> 00:30:57,006
She gets him...

555
00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:00,385
she sets precedent against
these other vigilantes popping up.

556
00:31:00,468 --> 00:31:03,095
One in our office is already
under serious scrutiny,

557
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:05,390
lady by the name of Jessica Jones.

558
00:31:05,473 --> 00:31:07,350
Oh, and you know who I bet is next?

559
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:08,976
The horny one.

560
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,687
It's... Daredevil.

561
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:14,316
- You think it'll work?
- [scoffs]

562
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:20,613
She's gonna turn city-wide disaster
into damn fine lemonade.

563
00:31:20,697 --> 00:31:22,949
It's her big power play.

564
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:24,617
It's gonna work.

565
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,286
[Foggy sighing]

566
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:44,804
- Hey.
- [Karen] Hey.

567
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:49,266
It's been... whoa, three hours.

568
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:50,893
Oh, God.

569
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:53,355
And I'm almost late for dinner.

570
00:31:53,438 --> 00:31:55,648
- Thanks.
- Any luck?

571
00:31:56,733 --> 00:31:59,486
Well, these are all the papers
from the week that Castle was shot.

572
00:31:59,569 --> 00:32:01,321
I've been through each one
of them three times,

573
00:32:01,404 --> 00:32:03,823
and there's not a single mention
of Castle, his family...

574
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:05,992
[sighs] Not even a John Doe that matches.

575
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:07,284
Just nothing.

576
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:09,621
Well, you know,
people are shot every day.

577
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:11,247
It doesn't always make the paper.

578
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,207
Cleavered Cleavers.

579
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,334
What's that?

580
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:17,379
Ah, just an old newspaper adage, right?

581
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:19,702
If horror befalls a family
you can paint as all-American,

582
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:21,341
it makes the front page.

583
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:24,135
So, if the Castles are not in this paper,

584
00:32:24,218 --> 00:32:26,303
it's because somebody
wants to keep it quiet.

585
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:27,764
[sighs] Well, shit.

586
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:32,143
April 14th.

587
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:35,438
When was the Castle family murdered?

588
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:38,002
[Karen] Well, I figure it's gotta be
sometime that week, right?

589
00:32:38,065 --> 00:32:41,819
You know, I cannot remember my...
my kids' birthdays, but...

590
00:32:41,903 --> 00:32:46,032
violent, soul-sucking events
are just seared into my brain.

591
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:47,409
Figures, right?

592
00:32:48,535 --> 00:32:50,161
Ah, yes, yes.

593
00:32:50,244 --> 00:32:52,955
Okay, gang-on-gang violence.

594
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,291
No civilians were reported injured,
so nobody cared.

595
00:32:55,375 --> 00:32:57,419
It took me a week
to get this in the paper.

596
00:32:57,502 --> 00:32:58,670
Here.

597
00:33:00,463 --> 00:33:02,173
Three gangs, Central Park, mid-day.

598
00:33:02,256 --> 00:33:04,717
They shot each other to shit.
It was a total massacre.

599
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:07,344
Mexican Cartel,
Dogs of Hell...

600
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:09,013
- [Karen] Kitchen Irish.
- ...Kitchen Irish.

601
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:11,140
- Those were all the three...
- That the Punisher gunned down.

602
00:33:11,223 --> 00:33:13,463
- There's gotta be a connection, right?
- Mmm-hmm. Right.

603
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,646
- Oh, my God.
- What?

604
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:17,814
Oh, my God.

605
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,656
This is it.

606
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,991
This is where his family was killed.

607
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:31,118
Shit, what do I do now?

608
00:33:31,202 --> 00:33:32,412
Confirm it.

609
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:36,165
- Can I borrow this?
- Yeah, sure.

610
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:37,667
Just a little reminder...

611
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,002
<i>Bulletin</i> gets the exclusive, right?

612
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:42,379
- You got it, boss.
- Wait, you're going now?

613
00:33:42,464 --> 00:33:43,590
Really?

614
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:52,098
[stammers] Do you drink wine?

615
00:33:52,181 --> 00:33:53,725
I should know that.

616
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:57,770
I don't drink anything
they don't serve at Josie's.

617
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:00,356
[chuckles] Yeah, well,
I don't see swill on the menu.

618
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,691
[laughs]

619
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:06,488
- So how was...
- So what did...

620
00:34:06,571 --> 00:34:07,739
- I'm sorry...
- I was just gonna...

621
00:34:07,822 --> 00:34:09,156
[laughs]

622
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,658
Uh, you go ahead.
Go, go first.

623
00:34:11,868 --> 00:34:13,620
How was your day?

624
00:34:13,703 --> 00:34:14,704
Fine.

625
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,873
Uh, yeah,
just a regular day at the office.

626
00:34:16,956 --> 00:34:18,958
Well, it's a nice change of pace, right?

627
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:20,084
Not being shot at?

628
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:23,295
- [laughs] That's gotta feel good.
- [chuckles] Yeah.

629
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,299
You, how's the, uh, new client?

630
00:34:27,383 --> 00:34:29,886
[inhales deeply] Uh, yeah, um...

631
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,387
[clears throat]

632
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:32,972
Nothing I haven't seen before.

633
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,808
I seriously doubt it's gonna pan out,
but that's...

634
00:34:35,892 --> 00:34:37,519
That's fine.

635
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:39,186
Okay, good.

636
00:34:42,524 --> 00:34:44,942
- Well, that covers work.
- [Karen laughs]

637
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:47,945
Uh, well, it's a start.

638
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:54,160
- Um, I'll be back in just a minute, um...
- Yeah.

639
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:56,788
- Order something fantastic. [laughs]
- Sure.

640
00:35:00,082 --> 00:35:01,375
[exhales]

641
00:35:04,921 --> 00:35:05,922
- Sir?
- Look.

642
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:08,550
If I had to seem like I knew everything
there is to know about wines

643
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,052
in the next 60 seconds, what would I...
what would I order?

644
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:12,804
- Matthew Murdock?
- Yeah.

645
00:35:12,887 --> 00:35:14,180
You have a call.

646
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:16,307
Oh, thanks.

647
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,101
This is Murdock.

648
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:22,188
[Elektra] <i>Sorry to bother you</i>
<i>while you're out,</i>

649
00:35:22,271 --> 00:35:25,107
<i>but you have a few moments
before she returns, right?</i>

650
00:35:27,276 --> 00:35:28,570
What do you want from me?

651
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,698
<i>You should ask yourself
the same question.</i>

652
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:33,950
<i>That rooftop act was cute.</i>

653
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:36,593
[stammers] Yeah, nothing compared
to your damsel-in-distress one.

654
00:35:36,661 --> 00:35:40,957
[laughing] <i>Oh, you're right.</i>
<i>I didn't actually need you.</i>

655
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,084
<i>I told you,
maybe I just missed you.</i>

656
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:45,044
<i>But don't worry,
you can keep the money.</i>

657
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:46,295
[chuckles]

658
00:35:47,338 --> 00:35:48,380
Aw...

659
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:49,465
Go to hell.

660
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:53,302
<i>If you really want to be done,
consider this me firing you.</i>

661
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,511
[dial tone]

662
00:35:58,265 --> 00:36:00,267
[rock music playing on car stereo]

663
00:36:11,153 --> 00:36:14,824
[both speaking French]

664
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:16,075
[Elektra laughing]

665
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:19,621
Any time you want to drive...

666
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:23,124
I think it's illegal, driving under
the influence of blindness.

667
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:24,584
You're the future lawyer.

668
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:26,836
Yeah, I should start
going to class again, then.

669
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,672
- Hey, where are we?
- A house.

670
00:36:30,882 --> 00:36:33,092
Yeah. Is it yours?

671
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:35,845
Oh, God, no.
I'd die in the suburbs.

672
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:38,097
No, this charming little chateau

673
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,018
belongs to one of my father's
many work associates,

674
00:36:42,101 --> 00:36:46,355
who's currently off to Monte Carlo,
where prostitution is legal.

675
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:48,608
So...

676
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:50,567
you have the keys, right?

677
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:52,987
[Elektra sucks teeth]

678
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,363
[glass shattering]

679
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,366
Welcome home, darling.
Dinner's almost ready.

680
00:36:59,994 --> 00:37:01,453
- [Matt] Tiny kitchen.
- Mmm-hmm.

681
00:37:01,537 --> 00:37:02,622
[Matt chuckles]

682
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:05,792
Okay, so we have, uh...

683
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:09,545
truffles, <i>saucissons, cornichons...</i>

684
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:10,880
- Baby pickles.
- No.

685
00:37:10,963 --> 00:37:12,298
- Ugh!
- Okay, got it.

686
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:14,050
No <i>cornichons.</i>

687
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,259
So...

688
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:19,430
- when you graduate...
- Mmm-hmm.

689
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:22,099
- ...and we get married...
- Wow.

690
00:37:22,183 --> 00:37:25,561
...and we buy a house...
I mean, houses, sorry.

691
00:37:25,645 --> 00:37:28,064
Santorini, San Sebastian...

692
00:37:28,147 --> 00:37:29,899
Paris, for when we're
feeling cosmopolitan.

693
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:31,025
[Matt chuckles]

694
00:37:31,108 --> 00:37:32,860
This...

695
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:34,445
is how we'll live.

696
00:37:37,281 --> 00:37:38,574
[Matt laughs]

697
00:37:40,076 --> 00:37:41,410
And what about the kids?

698
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:43,370
What are we gonna do with them?

699
00:37:43,454 --> 00:37:46,290
Oh, you know, sweet little Ellie, and...

700
00:37:46,373 --> 00:37:48,835
her simpleton brother, Matty Junior...

701
00:37:48,918 --> 00:37:50,670
- [laughs]
- ...can cook and clean

702
00:37:50,753 --> 00:37:53,380
and stock the fridge for us,
so we can use...

703
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:55,842
our time doing better things.

704
00:37:57,093 --> 00:37:58,635
Like sex?

705
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,972
Exactly like sex.

706
00:38:01,055 --> 00:38:03,057
- Who's thirsty?
- [groans]

707
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,021
- [Matt] Hey.
- Mmm?

708
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:11,691
- Is it good?
- What?

709
00:38:11,774 --> 00:38:12,942
This.

710
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:15,695
All of this, this, uh...

711
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:17,529
life.

712
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:19,406
It's fantastic.

713
00:38:21,993 --> 00:38:26,748
But I would trade it all in
for a lifetime of smelling your skin.

714
00:38:26,831 --> 00:38:28,040
[cork popping]

715
00:38:39,301 --> 00:38:40,386
Cheers.

716
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,767
[Matt clears throat]

717
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:48,269
[glass shatters]

718
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,939
- Sounded expensive.
- I'm guessing.

719
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,191
I don't care.

720
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:55,276
[glass shatters]

721
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:00,990
- Get me?
- [glass shatters]

722
00:39:01,073 --> 00:39:02,867
I do, I get you.

723
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,201
When are you going to learn?

724
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:05,411
[glass shatters]

725
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:06,662
Get me.

726
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,584
I have learned.

727
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,296
You know me.

728
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,175
Like no one else ever has.
And I know you.

729
00:39:21,052 --> 00:39:22,136
We belong together.

730
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:23,304
[glass shatters]

731
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,434
- [car door closes]
- [car lock chirps faintly]

732
00:39:30,102 --> 00:39:31,312
[softly] Someone's here.

733
00:39:31,395 --> 00:39:33,355
Daddy's friend
probably ran out of Viagra...

734
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,565
Shh...

735
00:39:34,648 --> 00:39:36,317
They're footsteps. Moving fast.
Let me go check.

736
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,528
No, no, no, no, no.
You stay here.

737
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:41,405
If I explain everything,
he won't be mad.

738
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:42,489
I promise.

739
00:39:55,002 --> 00:39:56,963
- [man groaning]
- [faint thudding]

740
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:01,258
[man groaning]

741
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:04,261
Matthew, you remember
Roscoe Sweeney,

742
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:06,263
the son of a bitch who killed your father?

743
00:40:10,059 --> 00:40:11,643
- [indistinct chatter]
- [Karen] Hey.

744
00:40:11,727 --> 00:40:13,187
- Hey.
- Everything okay?

745
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:16,232
- [nervously] Yeah, they ran out of wine.
- [chuckles] No.

746
00:40:16,315 --> 00:40:17,483
Wait, seriously?

747
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:20,486
Matt...

748
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:25,532
I don't...
I don't like this place, you know?

749
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:26,617
[Karen stammers]

750
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:30,704
Is it the place? Or is it...

751
00:40:30,787 --> 00:40:32,123
It's definitely not you.

752
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,376
- You're sure?
- Yeah.

753
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:36,793
I'm positive.

754
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:43,259
Come on.
I know where we can go.

755
00:40:44,844 --> 00:40:46,929
[Karen] Thank you.
[Matt] Wow, this smells amazing.

756
00:40:47,013 --> 00:40:48,014
[Karen laughs]

757
00:40:48,555 --> 00:40:50,224
- [Matt] What is it?
- Um...

758
00:40:50,307 --> 00:40:52,184
[chuckling] Who cares?
They have wine.

759
00:40:52,268 --> 00:40:53,685
[Matt chuckling] Right.

760
00:40:53,769 --> 00:40:54,979
That's...

761
00:40:55,062 --> 00:40:58,065
You know, I've always felt
more comfortable with the cheap stuff.

762
00:40:58,149 --> 00:40:59,733
- You know?
- Yeah?

763
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:01,610
Well, here, I'll drink to that.

764
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:03,654
[taps fork]

765
00:41:06,032 --> 00:41:07,241
- [glass clinks]
- [Matt] Cheap stuff.

766
00:41:07,324 --> 00:41:09,368
- [both laugh]
- [Karen] Cheap stuff.

767
00:41:10,827 --> 00:41:13,873
You know, I never even had
Indian food until a few months ago.

768
00:41:13,956 --> 00:41:16,208
- How is that possible?
- [laughs]

769
00:41:16,292 --> 00:41:19,003
Well, my hometown in Vermont
had about 400 people,

770
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:21,838
so the most ethnic food it offered
was French fries.

771
00:41:21,923 --> 00:41:23,132
[both chuckle]

772
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:26,928
So that's why you, uh, came to New York?
For the... for the food?

773
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,513
Uh, no.

774
00:41:29,596 --> 00:41:31,390
Although, if I knew
places like this existed,

775
00:41:31,473 --> 00:41:33,100
I'd have left Vermont ages ago.

776
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:37,438
- You see, that's why I love this city.
- Hmm?

777
00:41:37,521 --> 00:41:39,148
I've lived here my whole life, and...

778
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:42,452
the place never stops
unfolding new secrets.

779
00:41:42,484 --> 00:41:43,485
Hmm.

780
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,030
Yeah, you know...

781
00:41:46,113 --> 00:41:48,449
despite the crime,

782
00:41:48,532 --> 00:41:49,992
and the darkness,

783
00:41:50,076 --> 00:41:52,703
every once in a while,
New York makes me feel...

784
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,122
Like, safe?

785
00:41:55,206 --> 00:41:57,041
- Yes, is that weird?
- [chuckles] Well...

786
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:58,459
- Huh.
- I get it.

787
00:42:00,044 --> 00:42:01,753
I wish you could see this place.

788
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:06,467
I can, if you describe it to me.

789
00:42:07,593 --> 00:42:10,596
[stutters] So, anyways,
my favorite part...

790
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:12,098
is the ceiling.

791
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:18,062
So, it's literally dripping
with thousands of lights.

792
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:19,981
They're shaped like chili peppers...

793
00:42:20,064 --> 00:42:24,526
which sounds really tacky, I know,
but it's, um, it's not.

794
00:42:25,736 --> 00:42:27,654
Just...

795
00:42:27,738 --> 00:42:29,531
It's magic.

796
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,582
This is me.

797
00:42:42,169 --> 00:42:43,379
[laughs nervously]

798
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:44,838
Are you sure you don't...

799
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:46,548
- live two more blocks?
- [laughs]

800
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,925
- Maybe three?
- I wish.

801
00:42:51,053 --> 00:42:53,180
We could sit.

802
00:42:53,264 --> 00:42:54,265
Yeah.

803
00:43:05,401 --> 00:43:06,652
[laughs]

804
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:09,030
- All right, I'm gonna kiss ya.
- [laughs]

805
00:43:26,213 --> 00:43:27,506
[Karen gasps]

806
00:43:30,467 --> 00:43:31,927
You could come up...

807
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:34,555
if you like.

808
00:43:37,516 --> 00:43:38,892
I would love to.

809
00:43:40,686 --> 00:43:41,853
[Karen sighs]

810
00:43:42,854 --> 00:43:44,148
But you won't.

811
00:43:45,816 --> 00:43:47,151
Not tonight.

812
00:43:50,154 --> 00:43:51,405
- It's okay.
- Can I...

813
00:43:51,488 --> 00:43:53,282
- [Karen laughs]
- Can I tell you why?

814
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:57,411
Because I have this...

815
00:43:58,954 --> 00:44:01,707
incredible ability to bring...

816
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,752
disaster to the best things in my life
and tonight has been perfect.

817
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,423
- [chuckles softly]
- Don't you think?

818
00:44:11,508 --> 00:44:12,676
Yes.

819
00:44:14,761 --> 00:44:18,599
And if I stop now, then I get to keep
this one perfect night.

820
00:44:18,682 --> 00:44:19,850
[Karen sighs]

821
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:24,563
And also have the chance
of keeping it going tomorrow.

822
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:25,897
[Karen laughs]

823
00:44:30,152 --> 00:44:31,695
And the day after...

824
00:44:38,535 --> 00:44:40,954
[Karen] And the day after that...

825
00:44:41,037 --> 00:44:42,956
- And the...
- [Matt laughs]

826
00:44:43,999 --> 00:44:45,167
Exactly.

827
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,096
Then I guess it's good night...

828
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,015
- Mr. Murdock.
- [laughs]

829
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,436
Good night, Ms. Page.

830
00:45:05,521 --> 00:45:06,688
[Karen sighs]

831
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:37,511
[indistinct chatter]

832
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,515
[woman shouting indistinctly]

833
00:45:43,225 --> 00:45:44,643
[man 1 laughing]

834
00:45:47,604 --> 00:45:49,398
[man 2] Fix me up, man?
Fix me up.

835
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:50,566
[sirens wailing]

836
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:54,110
[man 3] I know who you are, man!
I know who you are!

837
00:45:55,821 --> 00:45:58,574
[chatter continues]

838
00:45:58,657 --> 00:46:01,202
[man 4] How much you got, man?
How much you got?

839
00:46:08,209 --> 00:46:10,461
[Roscoe] Oh, Jesus Christ.

840
00:46:10,544 --> 00:46:13,672
[groans] When I get out of this...

841
00:46:13,755 --> 00:46:15,799
[breathing heavily]

842
00:46:15,882 --> 00:46:18,510
- Oh, I'll remember your faces.
- [Elektra chuckles]

843
00:46:18,594 --> 00:46:20,512
Every single bit of them...

844
00:46:21,722 --> 00:46:24,600
- I will hunt you!
- [Elektra] Aw...

845
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:26,268
When you get out?

846
00:46:26,352 --> 00:46:28,312
- [Roscoe grunts]
- Where did you find him?

847
00:46:28,812 --> 00:46:31,440
[Elektra] Monte Carlo.
I wasn't lying.

848
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:35,777
He's been going by an alias for years now.

849
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:38,405
Al Marino.

850
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:41,658
An ugly name for an ugly man.

851
00:46:41,742 --> 00:46:43,494
Oh, you're dead.

852
00:46:43,577 --> 00:46:45,454
Both of ya!

853
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:47,748
Couple of kids playing house!

854
00:46:47,831 --> 00:46:49,333
[Elektra] Hey!

855
00:46:49,416 --> 00:46:50,959
[whispers] Watch your tongue.

856
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,168
While it's still attached.

857
00:46:53,712 --> 00:46:56,507
He tried to hide.
Went underground.

858
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:59,343
But the scum always rises.

859
00:46:59,426 --> 00:47:02,263
Al just couldn't stay anonymous.

860
00:47:02,346 --> 00:47:04,265
He had to spend his blood money.

861
00:47:04,348 --> 00:47:06,182
Make a splash.

862
00:47:06,267 --> 00:47:07,768
Be the big man.

863
00:47:07,851 --> 00:47:09,520
You made it easy for me.

864
00:47:09,603 --> 00:47:10,979
Eat shit.

865
00:47:12,273 --> 00:47:13,940
Want me to hit you again?

866
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:17,110
Well, I won't.

867
00:47:17,193 --> 00:47:18,570
But he will.

868
00:47:22,366 --> 00:47:25,243
[thunder rumbling faintly]

869
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:28,079
[chuckles]

870
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,918
I don't know him from Christ,
but one look and I can tell.

871
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,838
Pretty boy ain't got it in him.

872
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:39,215
You don't remember me?

873
00:47:42,052 --> 00:47:44,054
You killed my father.

874
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:46,264
Well, I hate to break it to you, son...

875
00:47:46,348 --> 00:47:49,351
but I killed a lot of guys' dads.

876
00:47:49,435 --> 00:47:50,894
Then let me help you.

877
00:47:52,187 --> 00:47:53,605
He hit hard.

878
00:47:55,065 --> 00:47:56,107

00:47:56,191 --> 00:47:57,318
[grunts]

880
00:47:58,527 --> 00:47:59,945
[Elektra laughs softly]

881
00:48:01,447 --> 00:48:02,531
[grunting]

882
00:48:04,408 --> 00:48:05,784
- [grunts]
- [bone breaking]

883
00:48:11,957 --> 00:48:13,249
[breathing heavily]

884
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:15,001
- [spits]
- [tooth clatters]

885
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:17,671
You call that hard?

886
00:48:17,754 --> 00:48:19,965
[Elektra] Let it out.

887
00:48:20,048 --> 00:48:21,091
Let it out.

888
00:48:21,174 --> 00:48:23,802
Okay? Whatever's inside you.

889
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:25,762
Do it for your father, Matthew.

890
00:48:25,846 --> 00:48:27,348
Do it for us.

891
00:48:27,431 --> 00:48:29,015
Come on.

892
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,726
[Roscoe] "Matthew"?

893
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:32,310
[Roscoe laughs]

894
00:48:32,394 --> 00:48:35,481
You're Battlin' Jack's boy!

895
00:48:35,564 --> 00:48:37,816
Oh, you amateur.

896
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:40,527
Now I know your name.

897
00:48:41,528 --> 00:48:46,742
Nothing'll stop me from bloodying
the street with your corpse.

898
00:48:46,825 --> 00:48:49,828
Just like I did to your old man!

899
00:48:49,911 --> 00:48:51,788
- [Matt yelling]
- [Roscoe groaning]

900
00:48:53,499 --> 00:48:54,958
[Elektra] Yes.

901
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:57,378
[Matt grunting]

902
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:08,138
[breathing heavily]

903
00:49:09,473 --> 00:49:11,266
End it.

904
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:12,601
End it now.

905
00:49:12,684 --> 00:49:14,310
- What?
- Keep going.

906
00:49:15,979 --> 00:49:17,564
[stammering] No, that's, uh...

907
00:49:19,232 --> 00:49:22,027
- [sniffling] No, that's all I got.
- No...

908
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,737
He knows your name.

909
00:49:24,738 --> 00:49:26,281
Cut his throat.

910
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:27,574
Kill him.

911
00:49:27,658 --> 00:49:28,825
[Matt] What?

912
00:49:29,993 --> 00:49:31,036
Kill him.

913
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,621
[shuddering]

914
00:49:38,043 --> 00:49:40,712
[voice breaking] I can't do that.

915
00:49:40,796 --> 00:49:41,922
[Elektra sighs]

916
00:49:42,005 --> 00:49:45,175
We can do anything together.

917
00:49:45,258 --> 00:49:46,760
Remember?

918
00:49:49,012 --> 00:49:50,847
[sighs deeply]

919
00:49:57,938 --> 00:49:59,230
No, I can't.

920
00:49:59,314 --> 00:50:00,816
[Matt sighs]

921
00:50:00,899 --> 00:50:02,108
[knife clatters]

922
00:50:06,196 --> 00:50:08,406
I thought you understood me.

923
00:50:09,365 --> 00:50:11,117
Yeah, I thought I did, too.

924
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,330
We need to call the police.

925
00:50:19,793 --> 00:50:22,253
- [sighs]
- [dialing]

926
00:50:22,337 --> 00:50:23,379
[exhales]

927
00:50:23,464 --> 00:50:24,715
[line ringing]

928
00:50:26,049 --> 00:50:28,969
- [operator] <i>911, what is your emergency?</i>
- Um...

929
00:50:29,595 --> 00:50:32,764
[stammering] Yes, I'd like to report
the location of a wanted felon.

930
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:34,808
[sighs]

931
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:36,602
The name is Roscoe Sweeney.

932
00:50:36,685 --> 00:50:38,353
[operator] <i>What is the address?</i>

933
00:50:47,403 --> 00:50:48,655
[phone clatters]

934
00:50:55,912 --> 00:50:57,205
[sighs]

935
00:51:07,966 --> 00:51:10,468
[Elektra] See? You missed me, too.

936
00:51:17,225 --> 00:51:19,102
Did you have a nice dinner?

937
00:51:25,609 --> 00:51:28,444
Elektra, I came here
to ask you a question,

938
00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:30,697
and I'd like for you to answer it.

939
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:40,582
Why did you take me to that mansion?

940
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:44,502
That's your question?

941
00:51:46,171 --> 00:51:47,422
[sighs] For fun.

942
00:51:49,215 --> 00:51:50,425
For fun?

943
00:51:52,468 --> 00:51:53,845
That's fun for you?

944
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:57,432
To try to push me into killing a man?

945
00:51:57,515 --> 00:51:58,642
Oh...

946
00:52:00,852 --> 00:52:03,396
I didn't push you into anything.

947
00:52:04,898 --> 00:52:06,650
And you didn't kill anyone.

948
00:52:07,901 --> 00:52:09,570
- But you wanted to.
- No, I didn't.

949
00:52:09,653 --> 00:52:12,030
Don't do that, don't...
Not now, don't...

950
00:52:12,113 --> 00:52:14,199
You act like you have some
window into my soul,

951
00:52:14,282 --> 00:52:16,577
but you don't,
and you never have.

952
00:52:19,204 --> 00:52:22,958
There was always this glorious
darkness inside you.

953
00:52:23,041 --> 00:52:24,125
No.

954
00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:26,878
That's why I took you to Roscoe Sweeney's.

955
00:52:26,962 --> 00:52:28,880
[Matt breathing heavily]

956
00:52:30,173 --> 00:52:31,424
And, yes.

957
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:34,260
That's why I loved you.

958
00:52:37,848 --> 00:52:39,766
That's why you loved me, too.

959
00:52:41,727 --> 00:52:43,604
[whispering] Don't deny what we have.

960
00:52:46,064 --> 00:52:47,190
[whispers] Please.

961
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:50,819
You think that's what love is?

962
00:52:52,445 --> 00:52:54,155
[faint indistinct shouting]

963
00:52:55,031 --> 00:52:56,449
Someone... someone's coming.

964
00:52:56,532 --> 00:52:58,201
- [faint thudding]
- [Elektra sighs]

965
00:52:58,284 --> 00:52:59,953
- Mmm-hmm.
- [elevator bell dings]

966
00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:02,080
- [man shouting faintly]
- [Matt] The elevator's moving...

967
00:53:02,163 --> 00:53:03,373
- [muffled gunshots]
- There's...

968
00:53:03,456 --> 00:53:05,416
There's a silencer in the lobby.

969
00:53:06,501 --> 00:53:07,794
Who is it, Elektra?

970
00:53:07,878 --> 00:53:09,713
[Elektra] If I had to guess, Yakuza.

971
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:12,590
No.

972
00:53:12,674 --> 00:53:15,135
No, that's impossible.
I took care of the Yakuza.

973
00:53:15,218 --> 00:53:17,888
[chuckles] Clearly, you didn't.
Hold my gloves?

974
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:23,184
Today, at the Yakatomi Building,
I infiltrated Asano,

975
00:53:23,268 --> 00:53:25,979
the Japanese branch of Roxxon,

976
00:53:26,062 --> 00:53:28,273
and I planted a little bug
to crash their system.

977
00:53:28,356 --> 00:53:30,441
Yeah, I heard it.

978
00:53:30,525 --> 00:53:32,736
You knew they'd come for you?

979
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:34,529
Well, I knew they'd come here.

980
00:53:35,488 --> 00:53:37,783
This building isn't in my name.
I'm no amateur.

981
00:53:37,866 --> 00:53:39,910
Hold on a second,
did you know I'd come?

982
00:53:40,827 --> 00:53:42,412
My confidence was high.

983
00:53:45,331 --> 00:53:46,332
You planned this.

984
00:53:46,416 --> 00:53:47,959
Everything you said in the apartment,
it's just lies.

985
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:49,502
[stammering] You don't mean it,
you're not sorry...

986
00:53:49,585 --> 00:53:50,586
It's just manipulation with you.

987
00:53:50,671 --> 00:53:51,713
- It's the same thing...
- No!

988
00:53:51,797 --> 00:53:53,089
Over and over again,
you just manipulate!

989
00:53:53,173 --> 00:53:54,174
Matthew!

990
00:53:54,257 --> 00:53:56,384
- I told you, I know you.
- You don't.

991
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:57,886
I've always known you.

992
00:53:57,969 --> 00:54:00,180
- Then, and now.
- No, you don't know me.

993
00:54:00,263 --> 00:54:02,140
So, now, you tell me.

994
00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:05,435
- You can handle them yourself.
- Do I need to push you this time?
