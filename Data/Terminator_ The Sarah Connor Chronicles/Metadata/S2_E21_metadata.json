As the paths of Sarah and Catherine's finally begin to cross, Sarah learns about Ellison's work at Zeira Corp and about the identity of 'John Henry'. While Catherine sends out Ellison to find Savannah, she becomes more determined to keep the existence of John Henry and her work a secret, but also finally learns about the existence of Sarah Connor as well as John.
