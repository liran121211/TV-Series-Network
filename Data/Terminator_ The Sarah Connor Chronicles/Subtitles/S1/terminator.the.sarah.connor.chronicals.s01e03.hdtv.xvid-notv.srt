00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,472
- Where are we?
- Same where.

15
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:53,814
Different when.

16
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:56,995
- I want my new name, my all-new me.
- I'll track down Enrique.

17
00:00:57,115 --> 00:00:58,555
I need three sets of papers.

18
00:00:58,675 --> 00:01:00,980
My nephew has taken over the business.

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,423
- You're in the system.
- Uncle Enrique will be proud.

20
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:07,821
He referred to you
as a rata... a snitch.

21
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:10,699
- Why would you do this?
- Because you wouldn't.

22
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:13,368
- Why not stay in the past?
- You died.

23
00:01:13,545 --> 00:01:15,355
Two years ago... Cancer.

24
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:19,290
- I've seen that before.
- Skynet work camp. Resistance fighters.

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,710
- You sure there's money here?
- Anything they valued,

26
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,625
money, guns... it'll be hidden.

27
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,300
<i>You told me we'd be safe.</i>

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,885
<i>Skynet doesn't know you're here.</i>

29
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:33,179
<i>There's no directive to hunt you.</i>

30
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:36,349
What if they found it,
but they don't know what to do?

31
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:38,259

[SARAH'S NARRATOR]
<i>When I was in the mental hospital,
I became obsessed with science.</i>

34
00:01:49,726 --> 00:01:51,406
<i>Not all science, actually.</i>

35
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:53,826
<i>And not really science at all.</i>

36
00:01:53,946 --> 00:01:55,076
<i>Scientists...</i>

37
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:57,861
<i>and then only nuclear scientists.</i>

38
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,664
<i>The ones who invented the bomb.</i>

39
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:04,022
<i>Oppenheimer, Heisenberg,
Fermi, and Teller.</i>

40
00:02:04,245 --> 00:02:06,214
<i>Pioneers, geniuses all.</i>

41
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:08,923
<i>I read every book I could.</i>

42
00:02:09,485 --> 00:02:10,998
<i>I wanted to understand</i>

43
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:14,220
<i>why couldn't they stop,
these fathers of our destruction?</i>

44
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:18,016
<i>And why wouldn't anybody stop them?</i>

45
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:22,896
<i>And if I had the chance, would I?</i>

46
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:21,545
Morning.

47
00:03:23,514 --> 00:03:24,744
You look like hell.

48
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:25,764
Up late.

49
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,224
Newsper clippings...

50
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:31,673
surveillance photos, bank records.

51
00:03:32,227 --> 00:03:34,927
Pamphlets from every
high-tech company in the state.

52
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,220
I even thought I saw the deeds
to city hall somewhere.

53
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:41,529
Those resistance guys weren't
sent back here to be our support crew.

54
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,726
They're a Skynet hunting party.

55
00:03:45,396 --> 00:03:46,729
Really? Are you sure?

56
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:50,316
Most of this is still a puzzle to me,
but there is one list I understand.

57
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,347
Employee list, Cyberdyne Systems.

58
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:56,739
Seems they thought
it was a good place to start.

59
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:58,881
And it is.

60
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,869
She's not gonna be happy to see you.

61
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:03,371
She never is.

62
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,186
- Want me to come along?
- No. You have your own job to do.

63
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:08,306
A big one.

64
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:20,820
You're getting pretty good at that.

65
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:22,640
Thank you.

66
00:04:26,054 --> 00:04:28,396
Still, it's not exactly
brain surgery or anything.

67
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,022
Be pretty funny if you were some sort of
advanced cybernetic intelligence,

68
00:04:32,142 --> 00:04:34,475
yet stumped by a stick of eyeliner.

69
00:04:35,325 --> 00:04:37,071
No, it's not brain surgery.

70
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:40,408
It would have to be a lot sharper.

71
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:50,914
Much better.

72
00:04:51,746 --> 00:04:53,465
When you wear clothes...

73
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:54,746
much better.

Six ways in. Six ways out.

The front opens to the street here.
Security's minimal.

76
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:04,933
Two armed guards in the morning.
Four in the afternoon.
