A Lumbator. It's another one.

- It means the same thing.
- Why would you do this?

Did you hear what he said?
We don't know. We don't know.

535
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:51,457
He was possibly lying.

536
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,502
Possibly?
You just executed him on possibly?

537
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:56,253
He had a family!

538
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,312
Why would you do this?

539
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:00,326
Cause you wouldn't.

540
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:06,555
How do you know
what I would and would not do?

541

You don't know me.

You don't know me!
And you don't know my son.

Not John.

551
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,270
So, where are you from?

552
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:01,068
Lawrence, Kansas, actually.
It's a pretty good size city.

553
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:02,069
About 80,000.

554
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,654
Go to Kansas City often?

555
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,532
Well, Lawrence is about
50 miles east of Kansas City.

556
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:08,367
25 miles west.

557
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:11,412
- I knew that.
- What about your father?

558
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,395
Your father.

559
00:40:15,515 --> 00:40:17,543
Did you leave him behind
in Lawrence, Kansas?

560

Your father's dead.

561
00:40:19,538 --> 00:40:21,042
He was a police officer.

562
00:40:21,162 --> 00:40:23,217
He died apprehending a criminal.

563
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,840
- He's a hero.
- Yeah, I know that.

564
00:40:26,278 --> 00:40:27,595
My dad's always a hero.

565
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,196
And he's always dead.

566
00:40:42,457 --> 00:40:44,612
Did you go out late last night?

567
00:40:44,772 --> 00:40:45,690
No, why?

I thought I heard a beep.

569
00:40:50,471 --> 00:40:52,022
Probably her.

570
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:54,038
She just walks and walks.

these stupid stories straight...

573
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:05,678
- You're going to school.
- But...

574
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:08,048
At least that way
I'll know where you are.
