00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:09,258
SARAH: In the future, my son will
lead mankind in a war against Skynet...

2
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:13,470
...the computer system programmed
to destroy the world.

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,433
It has sent machines back through time.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,101
Some to kill him.

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,936
One to protect him.

6
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:24,648
Today we fight to stop Skynet
from ever being created...

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,276
...to change our future...

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,987
...to change his fate.

Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles:

11
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,211
CAMERON: Cromartie came through.
He knows we're here.

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,921
It's just a head.

13
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,799
CAMERON:
We're programmed to repair ourselves.

14
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,468
To blend in.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:57,014
He will rebuild
and continue his mission to hunt and kill.

16
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,600
I know what his mission is.

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,976
SARAH:
We got a problem.

18
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,896
- Andy Goode rebuilt his chess computer.
- The Turk.

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,231
DEREK: Somebody killed him
and took the machine.

20
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,817
I was paid money for it, $20,000.

21
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,320
- Who bought The Turk?
- That's all I have.

22
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,115
These things, they're here.
They're programmed with specific missions.

23
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,203
CAMERON: The one at the safe house
was sent for those Resistance fighters.

24
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,662
SARAH: Humans sent back
from the future by John.

25
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,170
Everything needs to be destroyed,
every last bolt.

26
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,257
Even a single unaccounted-for piece
could hasten the arrival of Judgment Day.

27
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,094
- You get it done.
- I swear.

28
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,741
I need the list of new students who've
enrolled in the school since the fall of 2007.

29
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,702
Males, Caucasian, ages 15 to 18.

30
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:06,166
You boys are in here at least twice a month
waving your Patriot Act around.

31
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,960
Let me guess. Drugs?

32
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:14,466
Look me in the eye and tell me
you've never smoked a little marijuana.

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,638
I've never smoked a little marijuana.

35
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,895
Okay. Let's see your paperwork.

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,859
Court order
or a signed national-security letter.

37
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,653
- I don't have my paperwork.
- Sorry.

38
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,907
The district will not release
personal information on students...

Thank you for your cooperation.

00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,979
SARAH:
All of us wear masks.

44
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:14,776
They can be worn out of love and the desire
to remain close to those around us...

45
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,739
...to spare them from the complicated
reality of our frayed psyches.

46
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,365
Mom...

00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,700
...food's done.

We trade honesty for companionship.

Mom, come on, it's gonna get burned.

And in the process...

...never truly know
the hearts closest to us.

53
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,259
Mr. Sarkissian, I'm calling again about
the computer, the one called "The Turk."

54
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:44,806
Can you please call me back,

Mom.

00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:54,983
The roast should have been removed from
the stove 18 minutes and 27 seconds ago.

57
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,777
It's fine.

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,449
SARAH:
All right...

59
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,243
...not exactly fine.

60
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,960
Where did you get this?

61
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,842
- Her room.
- Why were you in my room?

62
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,637
You told me you destroyed everything.

63
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,223
She lied.

64
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,810
The chip contains visual records
of the T-Triple-8.

65
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:33,814
Where it's been, who it's interacted with.
It carries important information.

66
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:38,026
It's a brain, the only truly irreplaceable
part of the machine and she kept it.

67
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,657
Next, she's gonna tell us
that's gonna help us find The Turk.

68
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,451
- It won't help us find The Turk.
- What are you saying?

69
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,204
What I'm saying is what I've been saying.
"She can't be trusted."

70
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:53,000
No matter how she acts on the outside,
we have no idea what's going on in there.

71
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,544
Well, I could say that about you.

72
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,383
Who showed you to my safe house?
She did.

73
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,261
Who else knew about it? Nobody.

74
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,221
Where are my men?

75
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,391
In the morgue.

76
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,312
I didn't give the Triple-8
the safe-house location.

77
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,147
Prove it.

78
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,026
Have you ever hacked one of those?

00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,403
- Have you ever read what's on it?
- No.

80
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,905
But you have.

81
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,915
So how often do you lie?

82
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,919
When the mission requires it.

83
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,088
Do you lie to me?

84
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,049
Sometimes.

85
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,761
About important things?

86
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,596
Yes.

87
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,598
Important things.

You can't get these goods
unless you got family in Korea.

91
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,153
Dual-core processor, brand-new system bus,
overclocked memory.

92
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,781
They're using it for the effects
in the new "Star Command."

00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,948
Oh.

- One-point-four terabytes per second.

Cool.

with this chip thing?

00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,093
Do I wanna see what's on it?

100
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,845

how to read this...

...would you mind
making a 7-Eleven run or something?

105
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:50,659

107
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,337
How much power are you giving the chip?

108
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,172
Uh...

109
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,137
- We're running at 2.5 volts.
- My CPU requires a minimum of 6.2...

110
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:14,182
...and a maximum of 8.7 continuous voltage
in order to function properly.

111
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,185
That much use would burn out
any processor I've ever seen.

112
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,022
Access to visual memory will require
less power than higher-level functions.

113
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,941
Higher-level functions?

114
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:27,446
Decision-making, strategic mission analysis.
We don't wanna activate those functions.

115
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,781

00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,493
Crank the juice.

I mean, is that possible?

fooled by a machine.

Why? And why like that?

143
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,017
Because they're twisted. That's why.

144
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,895
I'll be in the jeep.

145
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:12,402
She didn't do it.
She didn't give up the safe house.

- She's not like that other one.
- I hope not.

Isn't Pizza Day tomorrow?

151
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,551
Yeah.

152
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,556
Well, she hasn't been here for a while.

153
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,392
I wonder what she thinks
happened to her husband.

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,353
Are you kidding?

155
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,146
She's dead.

156
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,731
You don't know that.

157
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,448
He wasn't holding her captive.

158
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,408
Wasn't intimidating her.

159
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,869
They lived here together.

160
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,582
Think you'd know?

161
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,460
I know I'd know.

to cover his tracks.

165
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,442
A city manager? That's infrastructure.

166
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,778
No wonder Skynet's interested.

167
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,280
You think this woman
has anything to do with The Turk?

168
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,034
I think if Skynet's interested,
we're interested.

169
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,371
Do you not wanna work on this?
Because I do.

We're gonna figure out what we want.

173
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,254
Together.
