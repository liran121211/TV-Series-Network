00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,340
What about your father?

524
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,219
JOHN: Hmm?
- Your father.

525
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,471
Did you leave him behind
in Lawrence, Kansas?

526
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,306
Your father's dead.

527
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:36,933
He was a police officer.

528
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,394
He died apprehending a criminal.

529
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,855
- He's a hero.
- Yeah, I know that.

530
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,523
My dad's always a hero.

531
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,277
And he's always dead.

532
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,956
Did you go out late last night?

533
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,167
No, why?

534
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,879
Motion detectors.
I thought I heard a beep.

535
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,714
Probably her.

536
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,966
She just walks and walks.

537
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,765
Look, if you wanna hold me out
another few days...

538
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:20,977
- ...until I get these stories straight...
- You're going to school.

539
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,271
But...
SARAH: At least I'll know where you are.

540
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,649
And who you're with.

541
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,320
Mom.

542
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,696
What?

543
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,784
Never mind.

544
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,081
ENRIQUE [ON ANSWERING MACHINE]:
Good evening, agent.

545
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,586
Perhaps you think I was retired, yes?

546
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,172
That I did not have my ear to the street?

547
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,259
If you return my call, I believe
I may have something of interest to you.

548
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,638
Muy expensivo, but of great interest.

549
00:41:56,805 --> 00:42:00,266
El Finito will not disappoint.

550
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,363
WOMAN [OVER SPEAKERS]:
Attention all students.

551
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:10,818
Class schedules will be available
in the hall at 3:30.

552
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,197
SARAH:
Know thyself.

553
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,243
John once told me it's inscribed
on the front of the Temple of Apollo.

554
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,619
The entire quote is:

555
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:23,790
"Know thyself, and thou shall know all the
mysteries of the gods and of the universe."

556
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,626
It's quite a mouthful.

557
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,336
My version is this:

558
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,923
"Know thyself,
because what else is there to know?"

559
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,800
People hide secrets.

560
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,802
Time is a lie.

561
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,263
The material world
can disappear in an instant.

562
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,641
It has and it will again.

563
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,645
[INDISTINCT CHATTERING]

564
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,818
The doctor will see you
in a few minutes, Ms. Baum.

565
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,695
SARAH:
Our identities change.

566
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,282
Our names, the way we look,
how we act and speak.

567
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,075
We're shape-shifters.

568
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,830
There is no control, no constant.

569
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,417
No shelter but the love of family
and the body God gave us.

570
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:20,221
And we can only hope that
that will always be enough.
