He'll rebuild

531
00:40:12,989 --> 00:40:15,380
a small chance, but a chance...

532
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:18,743
that there's someone out there who
might be trying to steal your identity.

533
00:40:18,913 --> 00:40:20,601
Steal my identity?

534
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,340
What for?

535
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,628
What do people do
with anything these days?

536
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,053
Steal, cheat,

537
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:29,114
harm, and intimidate others.

538
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:31,191
Damage the national psyche.

539
00:40:32,419 --> 00:40:33,573
Anyway...

540
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:36,547
if you see or hear anything unusual,

541
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:38,522
call me, anytime.

542
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:42,437
Thank you for your help.

543
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,654
Sure.

544
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:50,529
Have a nice day.

545
00:40:54,141 --> 00:40:55,539
Have a nice day.

<i>Not every version
of the Golem story ends badly.</i>

547
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:02,463
<i>In one, the monster is a hero,
destroying all those that seek</i>

548
00:41:02,623 --> 00:41:03,839
<i>to harm its maker.</i>

549
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,304
<i>In another, the Golem's maker</i>

550
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:13,182
<i>destroys his creature
before it destroys the world.</i>

551
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:41,627
You okay?

552
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,087
I'm fine.

553
00:41:45,854 --> 00:41:46,891
Really.

554
00:41:48,327 --> 00:41:50,052
How many times
we gonna have this talk?

555
00:41:51,434 --> 00:41:52,763
A lot, I think.

556
00:42:12,026 --> 00:42:14,013
I should go finish my homework.

<i>The pride of man, of parents as well,</i>

558
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:27,004
<i>makes us believe that
anything we create, we can control.</i>

559
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:31,267
<i>Whether from clay or from metal,</i>

560
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:34,658
<i>it is in the nature of us
to make our own monsters.</i>

561
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:37,099
<i>Our children are alloys, all,</i>

562
00:42:37,637 --> 00:42:39,827
<i>built from our own imperfect flesh.</i>

563
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:46,948
<i>We animate them with magic.</i>

564
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,801
<i>And never truly know what they will do.</i>
