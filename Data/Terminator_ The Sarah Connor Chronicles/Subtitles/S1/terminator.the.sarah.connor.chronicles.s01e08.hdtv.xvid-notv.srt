<i>In the future,</i>

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:07,112
<i>My son will lead mankind
in a war against Skynet...</i>

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,472
<i>a computer system programmed
to destroy the world.</i>

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,128
<i>It has sent machines
back through time...</i>

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,932
<i>some to kill him,
one to protect him.</i>

6
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:22,767
<i>Today we fight to stop Skynet
from ever being created,</i>

7
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,862
<i>To change our future,</i>

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,487
<i>To change his fate.</i>

9
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:31,800
<i>The war to save mankind begins now.</i>

CAMERON:
<i>Cromartie came through.</i>

12
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,166
<i>He knows we're here.</i>

13
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,899
It's just a head.

14
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:48,050
CAMERON:  <i>We're programmed
to repair ourselves.</i>

15
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,675
<i>And to blend in.</i>

16
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:55,500
<i>He will rebuild and continue
his mission to hunt and kill.</i>

17
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:56,862
I know what his mission is.

18
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:58,932
SARAH:
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

19
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:00,867
<i>Andy Goode rebuilt
his chess computer.</i>

20
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:01,878
The Turk.

21
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,166
DEREK:  <i>Somebody killed him
and took the machine.</i>

22
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,767
I was paid money for it, $20,000.

23
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,800
Who bought the Turk?

24
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,266
That's all I have.

25
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:13,066
SARAH:  <i>These things, all of them, are
programmed with specific missions.</i>

26
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,700
CAMERON:
<i>The one at the safe house</i>

27
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,633
<i>Was sent there for the
resistance fighters.</i>

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,633
<i>Humans sent back from
the future by John.</i>

29
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,456
SARAH:  <i>Everything needs to be
destroyed.</i> Every last bolt.

30
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:28,113
CAMERON:  <i>Even a single,
unaccounted for piece</i>

31
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,362
could hasten the
arrival of judgment day.

32
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,133
Get it done.

33
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,253
No sweat.

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,666
I need a list of new students (INDISTINCT)
who have enrolled since the fall of 2007.

35
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,266
Males, Caucasian,

36
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,066
Ages 15 to 18.

37
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,566
You boys are in here
at least twice a month,

38
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,999
waving your patriot act around.

39
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,519
Let me guess - Drugs?

40
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:09,362
Look me in the eye and tell me

41
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,400
you've never smoked
a little marijuana.

42
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,600
I've never smoked
a little marijuana.

43
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,466
Hmm.

44
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,867
Okay, let's see your paperwork.

45
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,800
Court order or a signed
national security letter.

46
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,299
I don't have my paperwork.

47
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,862
Sorry, the district
will not release

48
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:37,366
personal information on students

49
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:40,166

[NARRATOR]
<i>All of us wear masks.</i>

52
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:09,333
<i>They can be worn out of love</i>

53
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,566
<i>And the desire to remain
close to those around us,</i>

54
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,899
<i>to spare them from
the complicated reality</i>

55
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,666
<i>of our frayed psyches.</i>

56
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,633
Mom, food's done.

57
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,433
It smells done.

58
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,899
<i>We trade honesty for companionship.</i>

59
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,333
Mom, come on.

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,633
It's gonna get burned.

61
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,333
<i>And in the process,</i>

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
<i>never truly know the
hearts closest to us.</i>

63
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:34,500
Mr. Sarkissian, I'm calling again

64
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:37,166
about the computer, the
one called "the Turk."

65
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,733
Will you please call me back?

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,690
818-555-0189.

67
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,878
Mom.

68
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,284
The roast should have
been removed from the stove

69
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:52,503
18 minutes and 27 second ago.

70
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,612
And it's fine.

71
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,050
All right.

72
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,199
Not exactly fine.

73
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,867
Where'd you get this?

74
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,032
Her room.

75
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,767
Why were you in my room?

76
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,175
You told me you
destroyed everything.

77
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,675
She lied.

78
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:27,733
The chip contains visual
records of the T888,

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,999
where it's been, who
it's interacted with.

80
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,733
It carries important information.

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,899
It's a brain.

82
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,932
It's the only truly irreplaceable
part and she kept it.

83
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:39,767
Next she's gonna tell us

84
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,566
that somehow that's gonna
help us find the Turk.

85
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,266
It won't help us find the Turk.

86
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,533
What are you saying?

87
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:45,932
What I'm saying is what
I've been saying, John.

88
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,133
She can't be trusted.

89
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,266
No matter how she
acts on the outside,

90
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,899
We have no idea what's
going on in there.

91
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,533
Well, I could say that about you.

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Who showed you to my safe house?

93
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:58,800
She did.

94
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,800
- Who else knew about it?
- Nobody.

95
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,166
Where are my men?

96
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,550
In the morgue.

97
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:11,233
I didn't give the triple-Eight
the safe house location.

98
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,238
Prove it.

99
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,867
Have you ever hacked one of those?

100
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,333
Have you ever read what's on it?

101
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,333
No.

102
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:20,966
But you have.

103
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,833
So how often do you lie?

104
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:35,867
When the mission requires it.

105
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,032
Do you lie to me?

106
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:39,966
Sometimes.

107
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,666
About important things?

108
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,300
Yes.

109
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:47,533
Important things.

110
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,032
MAN:
All right, bro.

111
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,299
This is what I'm talking about.

112
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,333
You can't get these kind of goods

113
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,500
unless you got family in Korea.

114
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,199
Dual-core processor,
brand-new system bus,

115
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:00,878
overclocked memory.

116
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
They're using it for the effects
in the new Dark Man series.

117
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:04,867
JOHN:
Wow.

118
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,133
What's the video throughput?

119
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,400
1.4 terabytes per second.

120
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,800
Mas Macho, brother.

121
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,966
I'm gonna need two.

122
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,566
Cool.

123
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,675
Am I making a mistake
with this chip thing?

124
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,362
Do I wanna see what's on it?

125
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:25,999
Tell me "<i>no</i>."

126
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:28,379
I'd rather tell you after.

127
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,800
<i>Flick those bastards off the jeep.</i>

128
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:39,932
Look, since you obviously
have no clue

129
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,233
How to read this garbage,

130
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:43,233
would you mind making a
7-11 run or something?

131
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:46,233
Pick up some burritos,
chocolate milk.

132
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,206
It'd mean a lot to me.

133
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,233
How much power are
you giving the chip?

134
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:02,066
Uh...

135
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,333
we are running at 2.5 volts.

136
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,199
My CPU requires a minimum of 6.2

137
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,433
and a maximum of 8.7
continuous voltage

138
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,099
in order to function properly.

139
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,466
Well, that much use would burn out

140
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,133
any processor I've ever seen.

141
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,400
Access to visual memory
will require less power

142
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,932
than higher level functions.

143
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:20,999
Higher level functions.

144
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,266
Decision making.

145
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,633
Strategic mission analysis.

146
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,400
We don't wanna activate
those functions.

147
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:27,733
So crank the juice
but not too much?

148
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,600
Yes.

149
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,433
Crank the juice.

150
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,733
Wow.
What a mess.

151
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,999
How the hell do you keep
your brain organized?

152
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:47,999
Not like yours.

153
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,666
No kidding.

Vick, god, you poor thing.
(INDISTINCT)

155
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,500
I told you, just take one of my pills.

156
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,999
Fine, babe, come back to bed.

157
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:17,299
I can't sleep with you
standing there like a statue.

158
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,433
Was that thing...

159
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
married?

160
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:31,733
The T-888

161
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,433
is an advanced model infiltrator.

162
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,128
JOHN:
Yeah, but I don't think she knows.

163
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:37,800
I mean, is that possible?

164
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:40,633
She would not be the first
human fooled by a machine.

165
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,800
I know I've been working a lot.

166
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,067
And I know it's been hard for you,

167
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,378
hanging around at home
since your car accident.

168
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,503
I thought we'd made progress.

169
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,050
Just talk to me, sweetie.

170
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,253
Don't keep it inside. Please.

171
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,667
Please.

172
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:42,753
SARAH:  At least now we have
an address to go to.

173
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,567
That chip is really creepy.

174
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:48,233
We've seen some creepy things.

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,333
He's protecting her.

176
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,934
Why?

177
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,159
And why like that?

178
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,734
Because they're twisted. That's why.

179
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,613
I'll be in the jeep.

180

[DOOR CLOSING]

181
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,925
