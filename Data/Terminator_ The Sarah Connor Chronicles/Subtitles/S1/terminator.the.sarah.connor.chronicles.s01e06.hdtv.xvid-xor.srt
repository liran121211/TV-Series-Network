105
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,440
And then he, uh, carried Connor.

106
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,220
It was one slaughterhouse.

107
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,740
Many Connors.

Track back where the centaurs came from.

122
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,930
I think we lost the trail, boys.

blocks north-northeast.

you smelled jet fuel.

bigger fish than factories.

Eight years since my fiancée ran out on me.

Eight years since the FBI

I had to know.

182
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,920
I had to see it with my own eyes.

183

and there was nothing there.

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,650
No, uh-uh, no.

371
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,790
Get off me!

372
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,860
Where is he?

373
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,450
Where'd you send him?

374
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,750
You owe me the truth!

375
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,870
Get this off!

376
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,670
Get it off of me! Get it off of me!

377
00:24:05,671 --> 00:24:07,010
Get...

378
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,950
He's my blood.

379
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,280
He's my blood!

380
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,510
He's my blood!

381
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,370
He's...

382
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,680
I think they're gone.

383
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,630
What is this, a game?

384
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,940
Yeah, it's always a game.

385
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,800
Reese, slow down!

386
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,130
Reese!

387
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:44,030
Reese!

388
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,240
Oh, my god.

389
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,060
No, god.

390
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,820
Oh, god.

391
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,300
So who's Kyle?

392
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,020
He from the future too?

393
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,800
He come back before?

394
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,910
And...

395
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,090
He's John's father.

396
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,320
Yes.

397
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,810
They're brothers. Doesn't know.

398
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,930
So, when you used to say

399
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,840
That John's father was dead...

400
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,190
He is.

401
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,910
It was because of all of this.

402
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,970
Me.

403
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,330
We never had a chance.

404
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,560
Plasma burns, secondary explosions.

405
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,850
Skynet was here.

406
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,110
Maybe Connor and the others fell back

407
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,460
To the tunnel downtown.

408
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,040
Please, god, please.

409
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:11,310
Stand down!

410
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,810
Reese. Derek Reese.

411
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,080
Sumner.

412
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,850
We thought we lost you guys to the junkyard.

413
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:18,990
You did.

414
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,690
What happened?

415
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,730
Skynet found it, four nights ago.

416
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,020
We had a patrol

417
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,230
Out on the perimeter,

418
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,660
Four triple-"A" snuck in around us.

419
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,810
Went straight for the hole.

420
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,450
Killed most.

421
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,630
Took some.

422
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,940
Rest easy.

423
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,210
Connor and your brother weren't
here when it happened.

424
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,360
Where'd they go?

425
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,350
They found some skynet complex
in Topanga canyon.

426
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,000
And decided to put all
the firepower we had into it.

427
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,820
We lost a lot of men.

428
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:45,670
What was it?

429
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,950
I don't know.

430
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
Some kind of research facility.

431
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,850
Factory, something.

432
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,910
No one would tell us.

433
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,060
Connor took a small group,

434
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,440
Including your brother, deep into the place.

435
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:55,330
Left the rest of us outside to guard.

436
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,360
A couple days later, he came out.

437
00:29:57,370 --> 00:29:58,850
Ordered us to blow the place to hell.

438
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,420
So what about Kyle?

439
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,690
What happened to my brother?

440
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,890
No one ever saw your brother again.

441
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,740
Take me to Connor now.

442
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,970
Hey, Sarah said I might be able to find

443
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,960
Some more gauze out back in...

444
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,540
Hey, is that really necessary?

445
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,250
It's dead.

446
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,230
Right?

447
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,150
Or powered off, whatever?

448
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,220
Every component must be
destroyed beyond repair

449
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,640
Or recovery.

450
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:55,270
Even a single unaccounted for piece
of the endoskeleton

451
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,870
Could alter the course of
technological evolution.

452
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,160
And hasten the arrival of judgment day.

453
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,960
Uh, yeah.

454
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,140
You know, little girl?

455
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,150
You freak me the hell out.

456
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:17,910
On the outside, you're just
as pretty as a picture.

457
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:23,820
But on the inside, you're a...

458
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:25,880
Hyper-alloy combat chassey.

459
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:30,800
Is that a complicated way of saying "robot?"

460
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,300
Cybernetic organism.

461
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,540
Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.

462
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,920
Okay. Scary robot.

463
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,950
And here you are, carving up this guy

464
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,510
Into chum.

465
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,550
He's not a guy. He's a scary robot.

466
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:48,680
Okay, he's a scary robot?

467
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,760
You, you're a very scary robot.

468
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,330
You should go.

469
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,390
It's not safe for you here.

470
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,210
You're like a ghost come back.

471
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,450
And you're a Reese.

472
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,300
Tell me about the other Reese.

473
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,220
Told you, it's classified.

474
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,630
I'm family.

475
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,660
We're all family.

476
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,370
Let me talk to Connor. He'll understand.

477
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,450
Kyle was his friend.

478
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,140
Connor doesn't have any friends.

479
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,450
And he doesn't talk to anyone.

480
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,450
Fine, I'll find him myself.

481
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,970
Reese.

482
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,560
Metal!

483
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:01,050
No!

484
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,280
She's a machine! She's one of them!

485
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,300
No, damn it! She's one of ours.

486
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,640
One of ours?

487
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:21,010
It's reprogrammed.

488
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:23,360
And just given run of the place like pets?

489
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,930
This is Connor's show.

490
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,160
And that's what he wants.

491
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,590
Those machines kill.

492
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,220
They kill. It's all they do.

493
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,080
And now, they do it for us.

494
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,580
They helped us in Topanga.

495
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,590
We'd never have done what we did.

496
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,900
What did we do?

497
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,830
Derek.

498
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,010
What happened?

499
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,180
What happened up there?

500
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,550
What happened to my brother?

501
00:33:46,551 --> 00:33:49,951
[GUNS FIRING]

502
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,010
Hey!

503
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,560
Good, do it. Kill me!

504
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:35,980
Son of a...

505
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:51,590
Sometimes they go bad.

506
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,380
No one knows why.

507
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,430
What did you say to Charley?

508
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,740
I freak him the hell out.

509
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,430
I'll bet you do.

510
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,990
I'll just bet.

511
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,570
I know what you're thinking.

512
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,270
I may not know how you think.

513
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,340
But I know what you're thinking about.

514
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,700
And what you're thinking about right now

515
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,070
Is exactly what you should not think about.

516
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,910
I didn't leave Charley because
he was a threat to me or John.

517
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:29,590
We're a threat to him, do you understand?

518
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,520
You were right to leave him.

519
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,460
You don't go near him.

520
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,840
You don't touch him.

521
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,370
You swear to me you'll leave him alone,

522
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,520
Or, so help me, I will find a way

523
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:42,720
Of taking you apart, piece by piece.

524
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,390
I swear.

525
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,700
So do I.

526
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,640
That thing's done, right? It's vapour.

527
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,040
One missing component,

528
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,970
His left hand; I'll find it.

529
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,700
Everything needs to be destroyed.

530
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,550
Everything.

531
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,270
Everything.

532
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,780
Every last bolt.

533
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,940
Get it done.

534
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:04,360
I swear.

535
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,060
The best you could do for him now

536
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,730
Is keep feeding him pain killers,

537
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,110
And restrict his movement.

538
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,290
No lifting, no running,

539
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,450
No singing, and absolutely no gun fights.

540
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,110
If you need anything else...

541
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,340
I won't.

542
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,020
Now, you see, that's not what
I was going to say at all.

543
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,050
I know, I can't let you say it.

544
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,210
What can I say?

545
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,740
Good-bye.

546
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:59,840
What... what was that thing

547
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,480
That you always said?

548
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,410
There is no fate but what we make.

549
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,690
Remember?

550
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:11,610
The more I think about it,
the more I realize

551
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:15,280
My fate was made before we met.

552
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,290
When John was born.

553
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,220
Can't change it?

554
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,850
I'm not trying to change mine.

555
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,560
I'm trying to change his.

556
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,420
Yeah.

557
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,760
Okay.

558
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:33,150
Wait, there's um...

559
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,380
There's something else I got to tell you.

560
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,540
This is something you really need to know.

561
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,080
I didn't, um, I didn't tell him anything.

562
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,580
But, if you ask me,
it's just a matter of time.

563
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,360
It always is.

564
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,330
There's a storm coming.

565
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,480
John wants to see you.

566
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,020
Derek.

567
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,530
Hey, Derek,

568
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,890
It's okay.

569
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,900
It's okay, it's all going to be okay.

570
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,310
Rest easy, okay? It's okay.

571
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,570
What is all this?

572
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,040
So this thing, it works?

573
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,540
He said it does.

574
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,420
I don't know how he knows, but he said so.

575
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,660
We go back.

576
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,550
20 years.

577
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,810
Set up a safe house, gather Intel,
and then what?

578
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:50,150
Hang in there, baby?

579
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,670
Until someone else shows up,
and gives us more orders?

580
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,480
He didn't say anything about Kyle?

581
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,740
All that, and not a word about him?

582
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,050
We can save Kyle.

583
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,440
We can save everybody.

584
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,210
We can fix all the mistakes.

585
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,510
How're we gonna do that?

586
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,570
Reese, how are we going to do that?

587
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,380
Kyle Reese, your brother,

588
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,300
He came across time to protect me.

589
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,130
He died fighting the machines.

590
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,310
He was a soldier.

591
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,420
And he was...

592
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:21,810
He was a hero.

593
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,360
He was a hero.

594
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,330
[SARAH'S NARRATOR]
<i>"Listen," Kyle said.</i>

595
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,800
<i>"Listen, and understand."</i>

596
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,950
<i>"The machine is out there."</i>

597
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,810
<i>"It can't be bargained with."</i>

598
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,880
<i>"It can't be reasoned with."</i>

599
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,270
<i>"It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear."</i>

600
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:51,830
<i>"And it absolutely will not stop, ever."</i>

601
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,710
<i>"Until you are dead."</i>
