Why don't you take a break?

540
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,690
No, no, it's all right.

541
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,310
I can keep going.

542
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,850
How are we supposed to
celebrate your birthday

543
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,850
if you're sitting in
front of a computer?

544
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,040
You actually thought
I forgot your birthday?

545
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,030
It's just we have much
more important things to

546
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,560
think about than my stupid birthday.

547
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,950
Your birthday is important.

548
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,690
No, it's not important.

549
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:45,940
Finding the Turk, stopping Skynet,
judgment day-- that's important, that's...

550
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,110
That's our life.

551
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,060
It's our mission.

552
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,810
This is our life.

553
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:55,710
If we stop caring about that, then we're lost.

554
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,200
Well, when you put it like that...

555
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,360
I sent Cameron to get a cake.

556
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,790
What do you want for dinner?

557
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:08,290
Well, not to insult your cooking or anything,

558
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,610
but do you mind if we went out?

559
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,690
Yeah, we can do that.

560
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,240
All right, let me shut this down.

561
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,720
What? What's the matter?

562
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,830
The guy that Derek killed...

563
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,900
in the alley.

564
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,330
Sarkissian.

565
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,140
I don't think that was Sarkissian.

566
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:11,141
[ALARM SOUNDING]

567
