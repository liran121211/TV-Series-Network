I don't know.

178
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:54,161
Well, just try not to kill
any more birds.

179
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,665
You're ahead of schedule.

180
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,084
With what?

181
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,462
What you need to learn.

182
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,971
I know it's just recon, Derek, but
I can't have you running off like that.

183
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,265
I gotta go.

184
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,853
- Ms. Wilson, thanks for coming.
- Ms. Baum.

185
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,277
So your family's moved around a lot,
I take it?

186
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,697
Unfortunately, my job requires it.
It's been difficult on John.

187
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,824
- Hard to make friends.
- I can imagine.

188
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:36,828
That's why I was so happy
when Riley first came home with him.

189
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,039
I didn't realize she was so troubled.

190
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:41,166
JESSE:
Foster kids like these, it's hard to tell.

191
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:44,127
A lot of them come from
broken homes, abuse.

192
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,588
Where did she come from?

193
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,799
An orphan out of Riverside.

194
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,927
Her parents died in a fire in a meth lab.
It's tragic.

195
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:56,139
I met her foster dad.
He said you'd talked to him about us.

196
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:01,269
I was curious about why it happened
in your home. In your bathroom.

197
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:05,315
I have no idea.
My main concern is that the girl get help.

198
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,525
JESSE:
Of course.

199
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,862
I've only known her a short while,
but I've grown fond of her.

200
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:15,242
- Funny. She thinks you don't like her.
- That's not the case.

201
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,620
So you're the one who took her
to the hospital afterwards?

202
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,374
No. I was out of town.

203
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,627
So there was no adult supervision
in the household at the time?

204
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,963
John's uncle.
He stays with us sometimes.

205
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,091
Yeah, Riley's mentioned the uncle.
Uncle Derek.

206
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,970
John's uncle on his father's side.

207
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,931
We're not involved,
if that's what you're getting at.

208
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,893
I'm not getting at anything.
I'm just trying to paint a picture.

209
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:46,773
Do you think it's wise to have
an unattached adult male...

210
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,736
...hanging around a pretty teenage girl
who's so desperate for attention?

211
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,947
What, did she say something
about him?

212
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,616
She might have.
If she did, it's confidential.

213
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,786
Ms. Wilson, look. John's a good kid.

214
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,623
Whatever's going on with this girl,
he's trying to be her friend.

215
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,085
- He's trying to help her.
- Like by taking her to Mexico?

216
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,339
Mexico?

217
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,967
JESSE: Riley said she and John
took a trip to Mexico.

218
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:18,013
I don't have to tell you that transporting
a minor across the border...

219
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,433
...without her parents' permission
is a federal offense.

220
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:28,273
I didn't know.
Obviously, I will talk to my son.

221
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:32,569
JESSE: Ms. Baum,
I'm not out to get anyone here.

222
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:36,615
My sense is that you're a decent person
and hard-working mom.

223
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,035
I'm a big believer in keeping
your own house in order.

224
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:43,663
So why don't I let you handle this
your way?

225
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,832
For now.

226
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,752
I'd appreciate that.

227
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,380

228
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,109

That's it?

230
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:17,489
Why? Is there something else
you need, sweetie?

231
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,454
- No.
- Because we really could use the room.

232

What are you doing?

233
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,095
I'm looking up a restaurant address.

Are you hungry?

235
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,726
Yeah, but, uh, this is actually for Derek.

236
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,772
That Kaliba lawyer he's been tracking.
The guy's got a booth reserved there.

237
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,276
Not an ideal location
for Derek to acquire his target.

238
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,904
It's underground and, according to this,
crowded with friendly people.

239
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,407
Hard to dispose of the body.

240
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,496
I don't think
that's gonna be necessary.

241
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:10,834
Derek's just gonna follow him
and grab him and press him about Kaliba.

242
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:14,379
- To see if it's connected to Skynet?
- Exactly.

243
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,966
It's going to be necessary.
I'll make you a sandwich.

Okay, I'll see you soon.

with a counselor from your old school.

Oh, I, uh, forgot to send in
that quarterly homeschooling thing.

Actually, that didn't come up.

was Riley.

What about her?

282
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:14,017
She has a lot to say about you
and me and Derek.

283
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:15,268
And Mexico.

284
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,897
- A school counselor told you this?
- All those things.

285

From a stranger's lips
to my own ears, John.

I would've talked to him longer,
but he asked me to leave.

289
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:38,166
He thinks we're the reason
she tried to kill herself.

290
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:39,959
Because of Mexico?

291
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,254
Because Riley had a violent breakdown
about bleached skulls...

292
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,006
...and the end of the world.

293
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,236
