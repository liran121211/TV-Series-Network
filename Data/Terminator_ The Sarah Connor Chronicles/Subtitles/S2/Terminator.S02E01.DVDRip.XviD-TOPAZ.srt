your desks after you leave this meeting.

337
00:39:56,588 --> 00:40:00,752
The name of the new group is Babylon.
It's from the Bible.

338
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,390
And what does Babylon do?

339
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:06,053
I mean, besides steal our team members.

340
00:40:06,231 --> 00:40:10,429
Mr. Tuck, it's going to change the world.

341
00:40:19,311 --> 00:40:20,403
I got what I could.

342
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,746
Some smoke and water damage,
but you don't have to start over.

343
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:26,781
Wouldn't be the first time.

344
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,948
- Thanks.
- There's one too many.

345
00:40:33,091 --> 00:40:35,753
Charlie took off. Said to say bye.

346
00:40:35,928 --> 00:40:37,919
I guess he really does have a wife.

347
00:40:48,207 --> 00:40:50,175
Have you seen John?

348
00:40:50,776 --> 00:40:52,471
I think he's using the shower.

349
00:40:55,147 --> 00:40:57,615
Do you believe in the Resurrection?

350
00:40:59,518 --> 00:41:00,542
What?

351
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:04,155
The story of Jesus Christ.
The Resurrection.

352
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:05,881
Do you believe in it?

353
00:41:06,058 --> 00:41:08,049
Would you, if you'd seen what I've seen?

354
00:41:08,227 --> 00:41:10,058
Faith isn't part of my programming.

355
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:13,130
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
it's part of mine either.

356
00:41:15,834 --> 00:41:17,301
Don't let him do that again.

357
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:23,135
If I ever go bad again,
don't let him bring me back.

358
00:41:30,816 --> 00:41:32,374
JOHN:
Yeah.

359
00:41:33,452 --> 00:41:36,683
I made you a sandwich
and brought you some clothes.

360
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:38,789
I'll be out soon.

361
00:41:47,466 --> 00:41:51,027
John, I need you to know
everything that happened today...

362
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,431
...everything we did...

363
00:41:55,173 --> 00:41:57,004
...it was all...

364
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,538
It just happened the way it did...

365
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,881
...and there's nothing we can do
to change it.

366
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:09,044
And whatever happened, we're alive.

367
00:42:09,221 --> 00:42:11,451
Okay? We're alive.

368
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:16,961
I know you need more from me today...

369
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:20,362
...but it's gonna have to be enough.

370
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:26,428
Can you hear me?

371
00:42:27,506 --> 00:42:29,303
Are you listening?

372
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:32,376
JOHN:
Yeah, I'm listening.

373
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:39,149
Happy birthday.

374
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:50,258
Well, that was something, wasn't it?
Wonder what she's got planned.

375
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:52,659
Who knows what goes on
in that brain of hers.

376
00:42:52,831 --> 00:42:55,891
I don't understand what the hell
she's talking about half the time.

377
00:42:56,068 --> 00:42:59,037
Zen koans and Bible quotes.

378
00:42:59,204 --> 00:43:00,501
It's all a bunch of bull.

379
00:43:00,672 --> 00:43:02,799
Our options have tripled
since she took over...

380
00:43:02,974 --> 00:43:05,306
...so I wouldn't bite the hand
if I were you.

381
00:43:05,477 --> 00:43:07,172
Well, that's easy for you to say.

382
00:43:07,346 --> 00:43:11,942
She's not cannibalizing your division
for some top-secret Torah study.

383
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,982
Okay.

384
00:43:18,457 --> 00:43:21,483
God, that bitch pisses me off.

385
00:43:39,478 --> 00:43:42,641
Sorry I piss you off, Mr. Tuck.

386
00:43:54,826 --> 00:43:57,056
The feeling's mutual.

387
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,124
