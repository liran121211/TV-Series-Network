the opposite of foes are, okay?

- Hey, baby.

DEREK:
What are you doing here?

183
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,115
Connor sent you back.
What for?

184
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,617
Why'd Connor send you back?

185
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,702
You're here. You must know.

186
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,121
No one told me.

187
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,499
And you left without saying goodbye.

188
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,423
My orders were to set up a safe house
and wait.

189

For what? I don't know.

190

191

Connor didn't send me back, Derek.

Cullie.

206
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,013
That's from the same shrapnel
that killed Cullie.

How'd you get back here?

208
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,269
Cullie's brother. He's a bubble tech.

209

- He's the same one...
- Who sent you back.

lost a parent feel pressure...

It was an accident.

mental affliction soldiers suffered from...

530
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:50,757
...as nostalgia.

531
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,472
Homesickness.

532
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,475
A longing to return to the past.

533
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,898
The cruel reality of war is
that there is no return home.

534
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,942
No return to innocence.

535
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,282
What is lost, is lost forever.

536
00:42:18,077 --> 00:42:22,623
Like my father,
war's wounds have bled me dry.

537
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,628
No words of comfort.

538
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,469
No words of forgiveness.

539
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,643
No words at all.

540
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:50,484
I have to say, I was surprised
when you called.

541
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,821
Why don't you start by telling me
why you're here?

542
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,368
[GRUNTING]

543
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,375
