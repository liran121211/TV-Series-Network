00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,401
And what does Babylon do?

337
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,071
I mean, besides steal our team members.

338
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,450
Mr. Tuck, it's going to change the world.

339
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,418
I got what I could.

340
00:40:21,878 --> 00:40:24,755
Some smoke and water damage,
but you don't have to start over.

341
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,800
Wouldn't be the first time.

342
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,971
- Thanks.
- There's one too many.

343
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,767
Charlie took off. Said to say bye.

344
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,936
I guess he really does have a wife.

345
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,198
Have you seen John?

346
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,492
I think he's using the shower.

347
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,622
Do you believe in the Resurrection?

348
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,542
What?

349
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:05,170
The story of Jesus Christ.
The Resurrection.

350
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:06,880
Do you believe in it?

351
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,049
Would you, if you'd seen what I've seen?

352
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,051
Faith isn't part of my programming.

353
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:14,138
Yeah, well, I'm not sure
it's part of mine either.

354
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,308
Don't let him do that again.

355
00:41:19,936 --> 00:41:24,148
If I ever go bad again,
don't let him bring me back.

356
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,407
JOHN:
Yeah.

357
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,703
I made you a sandwich
and brought you some clothes.

358
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,788
I'll be out soon.

359
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:52,050
John, I need you to know
everything that happened today...

360
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,428
...everything we did...

361
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,015
...it was all...

362
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,561
It just happened the way it did...

363
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,898
...and there's nothing we can do
to change it.

364
00:42:07,984 --> 00:42:10,068
And whatever happened, we're alive.

365
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,446
Okay? We're alive.

366
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:17,951
I know you need more from me today...

367
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,371
...but it's gonna have to be enough.

368
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:27,461
Can you hear me?

369
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,297
Are you listening?

370
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,383
JOHN:
Yeah, I'm listening.

371
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,140
Happy birthday.

372
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:51,276
Well, that was something, wasn't it?
Wonder what she's got planned.

373
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,654
Who knows what goes on
in that brain of hers.

374
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:56,907
I don't understand what the hell
she's talking about half the time.

375
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:00,035
Zen koans and Bible quotes.

376
00:43:00,203 --> 00:43:01,495
It's all a bunch of bull.

377
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:03,830
Our options have tripled
since she took over...

378
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,333
...so I wouldn't bite the hand
if I were you.

379
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:08,168
Well, that's easy for you to say.

380
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:12,965
She's not cannibalizing your division
for some top-secret Torah study.

381
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,008
Okay.

382
00:43:19,472 --> 00:43:22,516
God, that bitch pisses me off.

383
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:43,662
Sorry I piss you off, Mr. Tuck.

384
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,051
The feeling's mutual.
