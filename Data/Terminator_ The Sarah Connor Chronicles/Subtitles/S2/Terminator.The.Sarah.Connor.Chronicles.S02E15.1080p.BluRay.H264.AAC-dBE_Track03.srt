Yeah, Derek. I mean that.

342
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,219
- What's the point?
- You know what the point is.

343
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,930
Your mom thinks that factory
was linked to Skynet.

344
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,932
Yeah. And you think she's nuts.

345
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,393
Doesn't mean I think she's wrong.

346
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,109
She hasn't looked at her father's picture
since we've been here.

347
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,403
Not once.

348
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:43,489
- Neither has her mother.
- Yeah. And?

349
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,162
If you had a photo of Kyle Reese,
you'd look at it, wouldn't you?

350
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,668
Maybe there's something
I don't understand.

351
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,880
He's not dead.

352
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,048
That's a big leap.

353
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:05,761
Let me repeat. If you had a photo of
your brother, would you not look at it?

354
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,732
He's not dead.

355
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,067
We should find him before he is.

356
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,935
What are you doing
in my parents' room?

357
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,651
Your father's alive, isn't he?

358
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,695
Get out.

359
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,032
Let me go.

360
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,284
I know you're scared.
You wanna protect him.

361
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,828
- You don't know what's been going on.
- Get away.

362
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,372
- Let me help you.
- You can't.

363
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,082
Yes, I can.

364
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:22,792
No.

365
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,651
Derek?

366
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,742
DEREK:
Hey. Where are you?

367
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,828
- In a garage.
- Garage? Where?

368
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,663
It's a long story. Where are you?

369
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,958
We're at a wake.

370
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,710
A fake wake.

371
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,191
The whole place was wired.
Every house in the neighborhood.

372
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,985
Every move anyone ever made
was being watched.

373
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,488
Skynet work camp.

374
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,698
This is how they were set up.

375
00:35:17,866 --> 00:35:20,826
People working for the machines
monitored by other people...

376
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,620
...working for the machines.

377
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,038
Who are you people?

378
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,165
I need to know
what they were building.

379
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:29,168
I need to know who owned it,
and I need to know right now.

380
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,212
I don't... How would I know?

381
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:35,132
- Because the tunnel led to your garage.
- My husband's garage.

382
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,386
Look, we don't know you people.

383
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:43,516
You could be responsible for this.
You could be some terrorist organization.

384
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,352
We're some kind of terrorist
organization. Believe me...

385
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:50,731
...if someone hadn't blown up that plant,
I would. Now, where is your husband?

386
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,691
He's dead.

387
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:57,488
No. He's not dead. Yet.

388
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,574
Wait. Wait, please. He's innocent.

389
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,911
- He is. John, you have to believe me.
- No, I don't have to.

390
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,164
I was with him when he got news
everyone was dead. He freaked.

391
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:10,668
He was trying to figure out what to do.
He didn't know. He was scared.

392
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,504
- Like we all are.
- What were they building at the plant?

393
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,172
- Nobody knows.
- How can you not?

394
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,717
How can any of you not know? How
can you sleepwalk through your lives?

395
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,555
- Tell us what they were building.
- Just stop it.

396
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,390
He told us he was gonna play dead.

397
00:36:24,558 --> 00:36:27,101
He told us everybody died,
that he should've died...

398
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,230
...and it would be better if that's what
everybody thought. That's what he said.

399
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:36,610
You think I'm sad, that I am pathetic.
That I sleepwalked through all of this.

400
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:40,030
Well, maybe you're right. Maybe I looked
the other way. We all did.

401
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,699
Every one of us.

402
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,118
Maybe that's not what you think
you would do...

403
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:46,620
- ...but that's what most do.
- You don't owe them...

404
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,123
There's no plant now. No plant.
No Charm Acres.

405
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,876
But it is a lot of insurance money.

406
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,838
Enough for my family to get lost
and start over.

407
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,632
So I didn't ask any questions.

408
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:01,635
Why would I start now,
when we are so close?

409
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:04,305
Look at this.

410
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,557
I pulled this from the archives.

411

412
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,298

00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,683

I can't stop.

00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,036
Excuse me.

419
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,705
I've been watching you.

420
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,791
You wanna know what I see?

421
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,960
What do you see, Diana?

422
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,337
Ed would say, you don't smell right.

423
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,714
Well, I guess Ed would know.

424
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:25,928
Look, I deserve the truth.

too many questions.

00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,763
- You're crying.
- No.

00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,474
Yes, you are.

428
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:22,234
Come here.
I want to tell you something.

429
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,867
I remember when my father died.

430
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:35,289
He was a tough man.
We didn't get along.

431
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:41,003
Even so, it took me a long time
to come to terms with his passing.

432
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,590
Do you understand what I'm saying?

433
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,551
I miss Daddy.

434
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,137
What do you miss about him?

435
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,223
He used to read me stories.

436
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:58,312
- I can read you a story.
- He did it better.

437
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:04,568
You know, any time you want
to see your father, we have videos.

Why?

440
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,077
I can't sit on his lap.

441
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:19,458
Come, sit on my lap.

442
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:24,338
Your lap is cold.

443
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,340
