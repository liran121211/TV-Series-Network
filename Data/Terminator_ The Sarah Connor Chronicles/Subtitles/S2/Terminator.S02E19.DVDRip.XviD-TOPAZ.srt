We will deliver this package

she loved you.

She was a good kid. She didn't deserve
what happened to her.

you could survive?

the answer to that, John.

It's between Queeg and Queeg.

The matte layer is critical. It both allows
the colors to stick to the miniature...

176
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:08,609
Jeez, Dietz. How am I supposed to eat
with Goodnow dead and that...

177
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:11,481
...thing running around out there?
Give me a break.

178
00:14:11,991 --> 00:14:14,017
Have mine.

179
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:15,991
I said, I'm not hungry.

180
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:18,592
Maybe.

181
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:24,539
Or maybe you're not really Garvin.
Maybe you're that thing.

182
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:27,271
- Maybe you're freaking crazy.
- He could be metal.

183
00:14:27,448 --> 00:14:30,543
- We wouldn't know until it was too late.
- Wanna see metal? I'll show you metal.

184
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,743
Hey! Hey.

185
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:33,718
Enough.

186
00:14:34,793 --> 00:14:38,629
You're right, Garvin. It's not you.

187
00:14:40,133 --> 00:14:44,071
You're not the one who spends all day
locked in a room with metal.

188
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:47,667
Stand down, Dietz.

189
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:53,444
I knew you were a metal lover,
but maybe you're more than that.

190
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,090
Maybe you're one of them.

191
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:01,493
Just like that little metal bitch
that follows Connor everywhere.

192
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:04,330
Maybe we should check. For safety.

193
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,333
[ALL GRUNTING]

194
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,461
Report to your duty stations.

195
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:51,606
SARAH:
You're not leaving this house.

196
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,205
John needs me.

197
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:58,249
If John needed you,
he would have asked for you. He didn't.

198
00:15:58,419 --> 00:16:00,513
You're not leaving this house.

199
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,686
The police could identify Riley's body
at any time.

200
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:09,427
- I need to be with him if they do.
- Lf they do, they'll probably come here.

201
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:15,543
So we should be happy he's out.

202
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:22,747
- Why are you here?
- Protect John. Hunt Skynet.

203
00:16:23,324 --> 00:16:26,726
- Stop Judgement Day.
- But why are you here?

204
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,768
Right now, with us?

205
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,772
John sent you here from the future.

206
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:40,646
He sent you away. Away from him.

207
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:46,422
Maybe you should think about that.

208
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:52,595
Maybe you should think about why
he didn't want you around anymore.

209
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:07,218
Hello, Ms. Weaver.
How are you this evening?

210
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,690
I'm well.

211
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,664
- You're up late.
- Yes.

212
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,859
I convinced Mr. Ellison
to leave this body operational.

213
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:18,098
Did you, now?

214
00:17:18,508 --> 00:17:21,478
- That's progress.
- Yes.

215
00:17:21,646 --> 00:17:24,810
He agreed it was important
I finish painting.

216
00:17:26,053 --> 00:17:30,515
I made its eyes blue.
They're the window to the soul.

217
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:34,921
Yes. They are.

218
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:39,529
While I've been painting,
I've been taking inventory of Zeira Corp.

219
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:42,202
I've discovered many interesting things.

220
00:17:42,511 --> 00:17:44,776
Did you know there's
a peregrine falcon nest...

221
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,377
...on the ledge
of this building's 23rd floor?

222
00:17:47,752 --> 00:17:49,515
The eggs should be hatching soon.

223
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:52,624
I knew about the nest.
I didn't know about the eggs.

224
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:55,695
Also, I discovered
in your private database...

225
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,297
...several letters of resignation
from former employees.

226
00:17:59,471 --> 00:18:03,967
Richard Hack, Lowell Rogers,
and Justin Tuck.

227
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,206
The documents included information
about home sales...

228
00:18:08,383 --> 00:18:12,481
...changes of address, and new jobs to
which these employees would be moving.

229
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:15,251
However, I can't find records
of these employees...

230
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,725
...in their new locations
or at their new jobs.

231
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:18,954
Is that so?

232
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:23,124
Additionally, I found letters of resignation
from all members of Project Babylon...

233
00:18:23,301 --> 00:18:26,429
...including Mr. Murch and Mr. Ellison.

234
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,573
Mr. Ellison's file includes documents...

235
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,506
...showing that he's taken a new job
and moved to Copenhagen, Denmark.

236
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:35,779
The documents have no dates.

237
00:18:36,214 --> 00:18:38,705
Now, that is very interesting.

238
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,516
Mr. Ellison is our friend.

239
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:45,315
Yes, he is our friend.

240
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:48,152
Are you going to kill him?

241
00:18:53,231 --> 00:18:57,099
Mr. Ellison has proven himself
to be a capable and loyal employee.

242
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,670
- But he's still a human being.
- Human life is sacred.

243
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,966
We have to be prepared
for any contingency.

244
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,104
What contingency would that be?

245
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,012
Humans will disappoint you.

246
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,451
Hey, it's, uh, Jesse, right?

247
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,195
- Right.
- That was a pretty long swim tonight.

248
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,499
Was it? Must have lost track of time.

249
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,830
It's easy to do.
Happens to me all the time.

250
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,529
Hey, uh...

251
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,368
...that blond girl you're normally with,
your friend.

252
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:40,170
- Where is she tonight?
- Don't know.

253
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:41,905
Why?

254
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,548
Don't think I've ever seen you
in here without her.

255
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,241
- I'll bring her next time.
- She's a nice girl.

256
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,886
Yeah.

257
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,988
She... She is.

258
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,922
- You look ill.
- I'm fine.

259
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,926
Most likely a concussion.
You require medical attention. Rest.

260
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,766
What about Dietz?

261
00:20:04,936 --> 00:20:07,666
Dietz attempted to murder
a superior officer.

262
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,569
He incited the crew to riot,
possibly mutiny.

263
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,403
The penalty is death.

264
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,906
You have no right
to impose summary justice.

265
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:21,875
Not like that.

266
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,917
That's not how we do it.

267
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,887
Mr. Dietz's behavior
threatened our mission.

268
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:28,685
What mission, hmm?

269
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:32,891
Your behavior threatens our mission.

270
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:34,861
This crew is tearing itself apart.

271
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:38,469
If they needed to know more,
they would have been told more.

272
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:45,638
Whatever we brought aboard this ship,
it is dangerous.

273
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:51,214
It killed a woman. It took her shape.

274
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:56,948
You can't expect us
to act like that didn't happen.

275
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,258
- Like we didn't see it.
- Report to your rack. You're ill.

276
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:06,893
You really wanna do it this way?

277
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:09,056
I don't understand. Do what?

I gave you an instruction, captain.
You must comply.

286
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:14,226
My mission order overrides
standard behavioral protocols.

what he needs to know.

00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:14,549
...record that I relieved the captain
and assumed command, time and date.

00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,557

299
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,889
We're not driving the boat.

I might shoot you in the head.

We owe Riley the truth,
don't you think?

We owe the dead that much.

00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:56,046
If she were here, you would be dead.
You know that.

00:25:57,288 --> 00:26:00,883
Would you please give me your gun?
You're not gonna shoot me.

You know, I've been running
from the machines my whole life.

They tried to kill my mom
before I was even born.

324
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:26,615
When I was 12,
they sent one after me.

325
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,713
I was a kid.

326
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:36,655
I was stupid.
I didn't know what it was all about.

Both times, heh, future me
sent someone back to stop them.

328
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,628
The first time, it was a soldier.

329
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:53,672
His name was Kyle Reese,
and he died saving my mother's life.

330
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,740
The second time, it was a machine.

331
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:02,645
I used to wonder why I did that.
Why I took that chance.

332
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,549
I don't wonder anymore.

They can't be rebuilt.

They die and they never come back.

336
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:27,009
You know, it wasn't Derek who told
me, if that's what you're wondering.

337
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,212
He loves you, you know. Derek.

See, she made mistakes.
