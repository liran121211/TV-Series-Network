Yes, it is.

I don't really have many friends.

Actually, I don't have any friends.

- I don't like dead ends.

Worked his way up from nothing.
It's the immigrant spirit.

Single-minded pursuit of a goal.
Never giving up.

armed with a submachine gun...

...and a daring disregard for human life,
opened fire.

Eight citizens wete felled
and did not live to tell about it.

in recent weeks.

how much was looted from the vault?

But why? What did he need it for?

213
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,366
To buy into the American dream.

214
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,580
Stark bought parcels of land
in the San Fernando Valley...

215
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:01,335
- ...Burbank, Sunland, Van Nuys.
- Two days after the last heist.

216
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,503
What'd he do with all that land?

217
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:07,966
He built houses. I found

MAN: This is Worldwide News.
Myron Stark versus Rupert Chandler.

220

A classic David versus Goliath.

221
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,271
Real-estate magnate
and builder Rupert Chandler...

222
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,566
...was the undisputed king
of the expanding San Fernando Valley.

223
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,110
But along came a young upstart,
Myron Stark.

224
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,781
What started as a one-man operation
soon grew into a thriving business...

225
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,076
...that went head-to-head
with the largest builder in the county.

226
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,079
Stark spoke six languages,
paid double his competitors...

227
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,331
...and treated all of his workers equally...

228
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,376
...regardless of their employment history
or citizen status.

229
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,379
Stark himself could always be found
shoulder to shoulder...

230
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,757
...with his workers,
a pickax in his strong hands.

231
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,551
Soon Stark became a thorn
in the side of his rival.

232
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,681
His meteoric rise threatened to topple
the king Chandler from his throne.

233
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,601
Chandler's top foreman, Fted Jeffers,
was recently asked about the rivalry.

234
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,853
To hear Jeffers tell it,
"We're not worried.

235
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,939
Fly-by-nights like Stark come and go.

236
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,984
Chandler's an established company
with contracts booked through 1925.

237
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,195
We'll crush him like a bug."

238
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,239
Upon hearing Jeffers' fighting words...

239
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:15,617
...Stark was reported to reply simply,
"We'll see."

240
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,040
Here's more on Chandler and Jeffers,
and something really strange.

241
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,211
Fred Jeffers, Rupert Chandler's man,
went missing back in 1925.

242
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,588
Was never found.

- In case I need it.

246

Have you ever used it?

00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:45,647
- Yes.
- Are you in trouble?

248
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,940
No.

249
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:50,110
- Are you afraid of someone?
- Afraid?

00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:51,945

You were wearing makeup, but...

- My brother.

There are people out to hurt him.
I protect him.

- I do.

He was doing something
and it doesn't make sense to me.

- I'm fine.

515
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,454
- Your brother again?
- I'm fine.

516
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:37,916
You never touched your doughnuts.

517
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,209
I wasn't hungry.

518
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,045
Your muscles are weak.

519
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,756
It was difficult for you to pull the trigger.

520
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,009
You've lost 8 percent of your body weight
in the past two weeks.

521
00:39:47,177 --> 00:39:50,179
When I carried you to the film vault,
I weighed you.

522
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,264
Wait. What?

523
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:56,393
This whole night, the entire time,
you've been examining me?

524
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,812
What the hell is going on here?

525
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,523
Your cancer's back.

526
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,902
You have a secondary tumor
in the long bone of your arm...

527
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,570
...and possibly your lungs.

528
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,615
- Are you joking?
- No.

529
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,659
Then you're crazy. You don't know
what you're talking about.

530
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,287
Ewing's sarcoma:
First identified in the 1920s...

531
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:18,332
I know what it is, okay?
I'm the one in here.

532
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,921
No wonder you don't have any friends.

533
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:26,340
You can't just do things like that.

534
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:29,176
You can't just show up
whenever you need something.

535
00:40:29,344 --> 00:40:31,637
You can't carry a gun
and freak people out...

536
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,515
...and walk in the bathroom
when a guy's taking a leak...

537
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,559
...and ask him if he's gonna kill himself.

538
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:41,855
And you can't just blurt things out
like, "You have cancer."

539
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,274
Especially to someone
who's already had it.

540
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,945
You have no clue, do you?

541
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,072
You have no idea what it's like...

542
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,866
...to have something inside of you.

543
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:55,077
Something that's damaged.

544
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,122
It's like a bomb...

545
00:40:58,873 --> 00:40:59,998
...waiting to go off.

546
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,006
I need to finish my paper.

547
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,717
You should make an appointment
with your oncologist.

548
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,970
- The tumor's still small.
- Get out.

549
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,258
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]

550
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,343
Where were you all night?

551
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,596
Out.

552
00:41:57,432 --> 00:42:02,019
Carbon chain C24,
lanolin and red dye number 27.

553
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,438
You were with Riley.

554
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,469
We're closed.

555
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:36,970
Is Eric here?

556
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,431
Eric?

557
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,767
He works the night shift. He lets me in.

558
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,729
I have no idea. They just called
and asked me to come in. Sorry.

559
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,732
Do you like doughnuts?

560
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:52,069
I have one glazed, one rainbow sprinkle,
one cinnamon twist.
