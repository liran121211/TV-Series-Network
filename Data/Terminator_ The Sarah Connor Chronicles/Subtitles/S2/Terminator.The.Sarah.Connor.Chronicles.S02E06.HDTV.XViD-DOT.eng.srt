1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
Previously on Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,000
When is the time for me, to live my life?

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:10,399
Do you know what is extremely rare

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,601
in the world of computers?

5
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:14,567
Finding one that will
cross against the light.

6
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:15,701
I'd like to talk to you

7
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:16,901
about an opportunity.

8
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,100
I'd like my company

9
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,634
to lead the world into the next century.

10
00:00:19,634 --> 00:00:21,968
And I'm fairly sure you're an avenging angel.

11
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:30,567
My father slept with a gun under his pillow.

12
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:33,834
There was no pill for his sickness,

13
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,000
no medicine to ease his mind.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,501
He left blood, and sweat,

15
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:42,400
and part of his soul in a foreign land.

16
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,200
My father never talked to me
about the war he fought.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,901
He never talked to anyone.

18
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:50,067
Ever vigilant, ever silent.

19
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:51,067
Anyone here?

20
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:52,234
I never thought

21
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:53,400
I'd follow in his footsteps.

22
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:09,901
Dr. Boyd Sherman.

23
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,236
Child psychologist. Family therapist.

24
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:13,703
Well, what's his link to Skynet,
friend or foe?

25
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:14,936
Don't know.

26
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:18,103
Skynet doesn't have friends.

27
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:19,437
Well, it's got foes,

28
00:01:19,437 --> 00:01:21,103
and whatever the opposite of foes are, okay?

29
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:21,300
Friends.

30
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,601
Look, we don't know anything here.

31
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:25,574
All we know is his name's on the list.

32
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:27,176
Everyone we've found on the list

33
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:28,776
was a Skynet target and needed protecting.

34
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,076
Not everyone needs protecting.

35
00:01:30,076 --> 00:01:31,475
Some need--

36
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:32,842
We don't know anything yet.

37
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:42,109
Turn your head a 1/4 inch.

38
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:44,509
Perfect.

39
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:48,143
Uh, another 1/2 inch.

40
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:50,575
Perfect.

41
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:51,842
And a smile now.

42
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,676
Warmer if you can.

43
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:58,475
Warmer. Warmer.

44
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:00,842
Uh, never mind.

45
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:02,376
Quarter inch to the left.

46
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:04,842
Perfect.

47
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:07,209
Could we get the child in for a few?

48
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:16,742
You wanna be in the pictures with mommy?

49
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:21,909
No.

50
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,343
Looks like fun.

51
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:26,709
No, it doesn't.

52
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,376
Savannah, sit here with me.

53
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:34,542
Savannah.

54
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,109
Sit here with me.

55
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,909
No.

56
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,609
Savannah-- ma'am.

57
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:41,742
Sit here with me.

58
00:02:43,776 --> 00:02:45,642
Ma'am, maybe we shouldn't force it.

59
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,542
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

60
00:03:02,076 --> 00:03:03,410
You have a child.

61
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,076
Yes.

62
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:07,310
What do you do with it?

63
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,609
It?

64
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,876
Uh, he, Leo.

65
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,714
He had some issues during my divorce.

66
00:03:14,714 --> 00:03:16,980
Some days I wanted to kill him.

67
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,313
But we went to someone.

68
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:21,513
A real miracle worker.

69
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:23,347
I can get you the number.

70
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,580
Who wants to start?

71
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:35,146
I'm not sure therapy is for us, no offense.

72
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:37,146
None taken.

73
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:39,080
Maybe if you tell us a little about yourself.

74
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,247
Well, I've been a family counselor

75
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:42,580
for years.

76
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,746
I started my work

77
00:03:43,746 --> 00:03:45,714
up in northern California.

78
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:48,347
Up north? Silicon Valley?

79
00:03:48,347 --> 00:03:50,547
Livermore. VA Med Center.

80
00:03:50,547 --> 00:03:53,247
Military?

81
00:03:53,247 --> 00:03:55,714
Since I've moved down here,
I've treated civilians

82
00:03:55,714 --> 00:03:57,213
almost exclusively.

83
00:03:57,213 --> 00:04:00,080
Iraq's changing that, however.

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,180
Do you have family in the military?

85
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,580
Your dad?

86
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,513
He passed away.

87
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,447
Oh, I'm sorry.

88
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:11,879
Is that something you'd all like to discuss?

89
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,146
It was a long time ago.

90
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:15,146
We've been on our own for some time.

91
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,280
That must be difficult.

92
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,980
You get used to it.

93
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,113
Do you?

94
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:21,614
I'm used to it.

95
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:24,480
It's fine.

96
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,913
Is there anything else I should know?

97
00:04:27,913 --> 00:04:31,046
Anything else we should know?

98
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:34,447
If we choose to go forward,

99
00:04:34,447 --> 00:04:37,879
I'd like to meet with each of you

100
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,980
individually.

101
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,746
Is that something you'd be open to?

102
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,413
I could do tomorrow

103
00:04:44,413 --> 00:04:45,580
if you're up for it.

104
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,647
Tomorrow's good.

105
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:56,547
Can you hold that, please?

106
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,313
Sir, you're gonna have to take another one.

107
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:00,313
That elevator's full.

108
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,180
Show me a tree.

109
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,046
Happy.

110
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:11,180
Funny.

111
00:05:16,313 --> 00:05:18,046
Hit the lights, please.

112
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:19,380
It's an unanticipated response

113
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,413
in the symbolistic software.

114
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:24,280
The AI keeps giving us

115
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,480
random, unsolicited images.

116
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,580
We don't know what they mean

117
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,013
or why it continues

118
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:31,746
to respond this way.

119
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:33,813
What we do know is that when
we run performance tests

120
00:05:33,813 --> 00:05:35,146
on the AI,

121
00:05:35,146 --> 00:05:36,946
its computational time is increasing

122
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,213
while the optimality of its
outputs is decreasing.

123
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,113
It's taking more time to do less.

124
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:43,480
Yeah, you could say that. Yes.

125
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,846
I just did.

126
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,513
A lot of children come to see me.

127
00:05:56,513 --> 00:06:00,946
They all have something that's bothering them.

128
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:02,714
Sometimes they know what it is.

129
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:04,347
Sometimes they don't.

130
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:08,247
It helps if we talk about those things.

131
00:06:15,846 --> 00:06:18,913
Your shoes are untied.

132
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:22,146
Do you know how to tie them?

133
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:23,746
Would you like me to show you?

134
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,879
So...

135
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,580
Let's see what we have here.

136
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,680
Okay?

137
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,714
Dolls.

138
00:06:47,714 --> 00:06:50,879
Ooh, coloring books.

139
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,113
Look, and we have,

140
00:06:52,113 --> 00:06:55,180
oh, a set of cards

141
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,347
with faces.

142
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:01,213
Happy.

143
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,280
Sad.

144
00:07:05,247 --> 00:07:07,247
Scared.

145
00:07:07,247 --> 00:07:09,813
Just play with anything you want.

146
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:16,447
I'm gonna talk to your mommy for a second.

147
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:30,280
This will take some time.

148
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,614
I can wait outside

149
00:07:32,614 --> 00:07:34,080
If it will make things go faster.

150
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,247
More time than just today.

151
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,879
I'll wait outside.

152
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:17,813
Where you been?

153
00:08:17,813 --> 00:08:20,913
On a run.

154
00:08:20,913 --> 00:08:22,714
You've been gone six hours.

155
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:25,347
I guess I'm slow.

156
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:27,547
I doubled back on Sherman's house.

157
00:08:27,547 --> 00:08:28,614
I got nothing.

158
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,080
How was he?

159
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,813
Curious, smart, annoying.

160
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:32,946
So he's good at his job.

161
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:34,779
Better than we were at ours.

162
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:36,046
We bugged the office,

163
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,714
but we still need the patient files.

164
00:08:37,714 --> 00:08:38,813
You're going back?

165
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:42,146
Not my first choice.

166
00:08:53,513 --> 00:08:56,180
I'm fine, okay? I'm fine.

167
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,746
I was just cleaning it.

168
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,879
I thought-- I thought I cleared it.

169
00:09:01,846 --> 00:09:03,213
It's just a burn

170
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,580
from the shell casing.

171
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:19,282
You want to be the girl?

172
00:09:19,282 --> 00:09:21,682
Where's her mommy?

173
00:09:21,682 --> 00:09:22,982
I don't know.

174
00:09:22,982 --> 00:09:24,582
Where do you think her mommy is?

175
00:09:24,582 --> 00:09:26,716
She's working.

176
00:09:26,716 --> 00:09:28,516
Hmm, okay.

177
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:32,315
She doesn't like the way
her mommy looks at her.

178
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:34,749
No? How does she look at her?

179
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:38,149
She wants to tell you a secret.

180
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,816
Okay.

181
00:09:40,816 --> 00:09:43,783
I want my old mommy back.

182
00:10:12,816 --> 00:10:14,482
Your daughter is beautiful.

183
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:16,182
Thank you.

184
00:10:19,883 --> 00:10:21,915
She looks just like her mommy.

185
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:24,349
Yes.

186
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:25,549
She does.

187
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,149
I just need a minute with your mom, okay?

188
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:37,682
Wait here.

189
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,582
What are your strongest memories
from childhood?

190
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:58,349
My strongest memories?

191
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:00,149
Yeah, what do you remeber most?

192
00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:01,416
What's vivid to you?

193
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,915
Why do you ask?

194
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:05,582
Well, the death of Savannah's father

195
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,549
is the most vivid memory she has.

196
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:10,549
Hearing the news, the funeral.

197
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:12,948
She's so young, she has no distance from it.

198
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:17,783
Well, we can't make her grow faster, can we?

199
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,082
Look, I'm--

200
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:25,582
I'm sure you're in a lot of pain,

201
00:11:25,582 --> 00:11:28,149
but you need to reassure Savannah

202
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,516
that she hasn't lost her mother

203
00:11:30,516 --> 00:11:32,648
as well as her father.

204
00:11:42,716 --> 00:11:44,416
You know the squirrel and the tree?

205
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:50,948
See, uh...

206
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:54,582
You make a loop for the tree.

207
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:57,516
The squirrel runs around the tree.

208
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:01,582
Then he dives in the hole

209
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:05,115
and scurries out the other side.

210
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,115
Savannah.

211
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:13,716
John.

212
00:12:16,082 --> 00:12:17,749
The usual? Yeah.

213
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:19,849
Thanks.

214
00:13:27,048 --> 00:13:28,082
Jesse?

215
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:29,616
Hey, baby.

216
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,982
What are you doing here?

217
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,849
Connor sent you back. What for?

218
00:13:41,849 --> 00:13:43,616
Why'd Connor send you back?

219
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,716
You're here. you must know.

220
00:13:45,716 --> 00:13:47,048
No one told me.

221
00:13:49,048 --> 00:13:50,449
And you left without saying good-bye.

222
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:57,482
My orders were to set up a safe house

223
00:13:57,482 --> 00:13:58,616
And wait.

224
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:01,149
For what, I don't know.

225
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:02,749
I wait.

226
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:04,582
At the park.

227
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,115
Eating hot dogs.

228
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:07,382
What about you?

229
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:08,982
What's Connor got you doing?

230
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,682
Connor didn't send me back, Derek.

231
00:14:10,682 --> 00:14:12,249
He didn't?

232
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:14,349
What do you mean?

233
00:14:19,616 --> 00:14:21,182
That's new.

234
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:24,382
Not to me.

235
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:26,749
There's metal everywhere these days.

236
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:29,082
Looking for us.

237
00:14:29,082 --> 00:14:31,749
Working for us.

238
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:34,015
Connor's got at least one in every major base.

239
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,315
A big one flipped on us,

240
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,382
took out half a bunker.

241
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:40,215
Bird.

242
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:41,349
Cullie.

243
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:47,015
That's from the same shrapnel
that killed Cullie.

244
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:49,549
How'd you get back here?

245
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:50,716
Cullie's brother.

246
00:14:50,716 --> 00:14:52,215
He's a bubble tech.

247
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:53,482
He's the same one--

248
00:14:53,482 --> 00:14:55,048
who sent you back.

249
00:14:55,048 --> 00:14:56,048
I know.

250
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:04,149
Are you AWOL?

251
00:15:08,982 --> 00:15:12,649
Jesse, did you run from the war?

252
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:20,082
I need a place to rest.

253
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:22,349
You're a soldier.

254
00:15:22,349 --> 00:15:23,516
You fight.

255
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,015
Not anymore.

256
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:32,249
When everything ends,

257
00:15:32,249 --> 00:15:35,182
I want to be here with you.

258
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,915
Derek, please.

259
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,048
I don't want everything to end.

260
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:55,849
Jesse, not again.

261
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,550
When I showed you in,

262
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,216
you, uh, you assessed the exits.

263
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:10,279
You're talking to a VA doc.

264
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,779
Every vet does it every day.

265
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,966
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

266
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,433
I'm not a vet.

267
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,467
No, of course not.

268
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,866
Your dad was though, right?

269
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:27,133
Vets are the ones who come back, right?

270
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:30,500
My dad never came back, so...

271
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,667
My mistake. I'm sorry.

272
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,367
You, uh--

273
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,266
You didn't have that yesterday.

274
00:16:43,266 --> 00:16:45,200
What happened?

275
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,667
Oh, it's a burn.

276
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:51,966
Just an accident.

277
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,300
I was cooking.

278
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,767
What were you cooking?

279
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,233
What--what does that matter?

280
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:00,899
Just curious.

281
00:17:04,367 --> 00:17:07,600
I was boiling water for pasta.

282
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,300
Why do you think your mother brought you here?

283
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,333
I don't know. She doesn't tell me everything.

284
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,633
Why do you think you're here?

285
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,567
I couldn't tell you.

286
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:29,633
Do you cook for the family much?

287
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:32,899
Is that a role you take on?

288
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:34,166
What?

289
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,999
What is your role in the family?

290
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,367
What do you do?

291
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,767
Do?

292
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,633
Uh, I go to school.

293
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,066
I hang out.

294
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:45,834
I'm a kid.

295
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:48,633
Are you?

296
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,133
You think I'm lying?

297
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,999
Why don't you check my passport or something?

298
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,767
I simply meant

299
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:56,500
that some children who've lost a parent

300
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,899
feel pressure to take the place
of the absent parent.

301
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:03,500
They--

302
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,667
Well, they grow up quickly.

303
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:10,800
Interesting, you say passport

304
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,266
when a lot of kids would say driver's license.

305
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:19,567
You ever...feel like running, escaping?

306
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,899
All the time.

307
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,600
Why?

308
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,866
Why do you want to escape?

309
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,700
Look, I want you to know

310
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,333
everything you say

311
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,333
is between us.

312
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,700
This is a safe place.

313
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:57,767
No, it's not.

314
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:00,200
Nowhere is.

315
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,500
Did you know that 60% of all teen suicides

316
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,767
are committed with a gun?

317
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:08,700
He thought it was cleared. It was an accident.

318
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,033
Some first attempts may appear
to be an accident.

319
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:13,100
What's taking so long in there?

320
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:16,899
Can we talk?

321
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:24,033
I'd like to see John again, alone.

322
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,734
John? Why?

323
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:28,433
Oh, actually, I'd like to see all of you again.

324
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,333
I think your daughter has some sort

325
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,800
of social disorder.

326
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,767
It's too early to diagnose,

327
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,999
but she does exhibit possible
Asperger's symptoms.

328
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:42,166
And John?

329
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,333
Yeah, this might sound strange to you,

330
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,767
but, uh, he reminds me

331
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:50,300
of veterans I used to treat.

332
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,600
War veterans.

333
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,667
Yeah, Vietnam, especially.

334
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:57,200
The way he evaluates a room.

335
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,600
His guardedness.

336
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,200
The way he carries himself.

337
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,734
Do you know of any violence

338
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:03,933
in his past?

339
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:11,433
He's never been abused,

340
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,233
if that's what you're suggesting.

341
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,400
Oh, no, no.

342
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,233
I'm not suggesting anything like that.

343
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,633
Thank you, doctor.

344
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:22,400
It may not be me,

345
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,300
but that boy needs to talk

346
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,633
to somebody.

347
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,300
We talk.

348
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,367
That's not enough.

349
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,266
Strangest thing about her?

350
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,300
For one of the best minds in the tech world,

351
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,133
she's practically a Luddite.

352
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,866
You liar.

353
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:47,300
Bicycle or car?

354
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,400
Bicycle.

355
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,367
Mm-hmm. Electric or acoustic?

356
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:51,734
He thinks he's so smart.

357
00:20:51,734 --> 00:20:54,066
No, no, no, I just know you, that's all.

358
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:56,800
Tell them how you work from home.

359
00:20:58,033 --> 00:21:00,433
Come on. Come on, tell them.

360
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:03,633
My father was a butcher.

361
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:05,734
One of the oldest shops in Edinburgh.

362
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:08,233
We didn't have a lot of
money for school supplies.

363
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,233
She writes on butcher's paper.

364
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:13,266
Like, big rolls of it with grease pencils.

365
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:15,734
I like the way it smells.

366
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:19,834
Miss Weaver,

367
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:22,800
you're needed down in the lab.

368
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,767
It won't run any of the tests

369
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,133
or diagnostics.

370
00:21:26,133 --> 00:21:28,266
It just keeps playing these twisted pictures

371
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:30,533
and doing equations.

372
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:35,834
I don't know, maybe we should consider,

373
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,467
you know, scrapping it

374
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,800
and starting over with a clean platform.

375
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,999
Should I consider

376
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:44,266
scrapping my team as well?

377
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:46,933
Or does that seem equally as intemperate?

378
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,100
Strangest thing about her?

379
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,166
For one of the best minds in the tech world,

380
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:05,600
she's practically a Luddite.

381
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,966
Daddy keeps touching your tummy.

382
00:22:08,966 --> 00:22:11,033
Does he?

383
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:13,966
Is he trying to hug me?

384
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,866
I don't know.

385
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:22,367
I think he's trying to hug me.

386
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,834
When are we going back to Sherman?

387
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,600
We're not going back, not now.

388
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,200
Patients list was a bust.

389
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
He's got the names encoded for privacy.

390
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,100
Tapes have been useless so far,

391
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,367
but we'll keep listening.

392
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:00,233
Well, I can push him more, get something.

393
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:01,233
Like what?

394
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:02,700
I don't know.

395
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,767
He's on that wall for a reason though.

396
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:06,767
For all we know, he could have
a triple eight on his ass.

397
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:08,667
Or it could be six months from now.

398
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:10,400
There's no timetable on the list.

399
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,533
So you just want to give up?

400
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,467
We don't know what Skynet wants from him.

401
00:23:14,467 --> 00:23:17,933
We can't trust him.

402
00:23:17,933 --> 00:23:21,500
Maybe his name's on the list
because he helps John.

403
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,633
Helps John?

404
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,800
What makes you think John needs help?

405
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,400
What makes you think I don't?

406
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:33,233
Do you?

407
00:23:37,633 --> 00:23:40,567
Because you can talk to me, John.

408
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:42,500
You always have.

409
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:47,834
No, I'm fine.

410
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,084
I had this friend once.

411
00:24:50,084 --> 00:24:52,384
We dug tunnels together.

412
00:24:55,117 --> 00:24:58,217
Roughest son of a bitch I ever knew.

413
00:24:58,217 --> 00:25:00,051
One day, he went out to take a leak.

414
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:02,817
And when he was out there,

415
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:06,684
he just decided to blow his head off.

416
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:09,017
Just like that.

417
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:12,450
He fought, and fought,
and fought for his life,

418
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,284
then just couldn't anymore.

419
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:19,351
John is not suicidal.

420
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,817
No.

421
00:25:23,017 --> 00:25:25,650
But what is he?

422
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,617
He's not a boy. He's not a man.

423
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:29,784
He's not a soldier.

424
00:25:29,784 --> 00:25:33,184
He has changed.

425
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,984
Saw his mother kill a man.

426
00:26:04,084 --> 00:26:06,284
I won't scream.

427
00:26:50,884 --> 00:26:52,017
Getting off?

428
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,418
I'm going down.

429
00:26:57,217 --> 00:26:59,717
I'm gonna have to ask you
to get off on this floor.

430
00:27:02,051 --> 00:27:03,884
Of course.

431
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:17,017
We're developing a human interactive AI.

432
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:18,917
It's like a child.

433
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,784
Its neural network needs to be trained

434
00:27:20,784 --> 00:27:22,684
to recognize images.

435
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:24,384
Well, I guess I'm still a little fuzzy

436
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:26,117
as to why you called me here.

437
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:28,351
We were in the process of training the AI

438
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:31,717
when it stopped running all its tests.

439
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,650
Now...

440
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:35,117
all it plays is this.

441
00:27:52,318 --> 00:27:54,650
Is something funny?

442
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,151
It is if you get the joke.

443
00:27:58,151 --> 00:28:00,418
It's asking a question.

444
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:02,650
Look, the question mark equals "why."

445
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,318
Equations, that's "math."

446
00:28:04,318 --> 00:28:06,550
Books, well, they're books.

447
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,817
And these images here,

448
00:28:07,817 --> 00:28:09,850
they all represent sadness.

449
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,251
If you put it all together,

450
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:13,884
"why is a math book

451
00:28:13,884 --> 00:28:17,184
so sad?"

452
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:19,217
It's a riddle, a joke.

453
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:21,684
A third grader told it to me.

454
00:28:21,684 --> 00:28:26,017
Around three to four years old,

455
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:27,917
a child starts asking questions.

456
00:28:27,917 --> 00:28:29,750
But your AI

457
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,750
appears to be even more advanced.

458
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,418
It recognizes humor.

459
00:28:33,418 --> 00:28:35,418
That doesn't happen until--

460
00:28:35,418 --> 00:28:38,151
well, actually some people
never get a sense of humor.

461
00:28:41,117 --> 00:28:43,717
If this were one of my patients,

462
00:28:43,717 --> 00:28:45,617
I would say it was a gifted child

463
00:28:45,617 --> 00:28:47,217
who's grown bored.

464
00:28:47,217 --> 00:28:48,517
It's amusing itself.

465
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:49,984
But of course, that's impossible.

466
00:28:49,984 --> 00:28:51,784
It's just a machine.

467
00:28:51,784 --> 00:28:54,284
Yes, impossible.

468
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:59,351
Why is a math book so sad?

469
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:04,318
Because it has so many problems.

470
00:29:09,017 --> 00:29:10,251
Why?

471
00:29:10,251 --> 00:29:15,017
Why do you want to escape?

472
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:17,217
Look, I want you to know

473
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:19,217
Everything you say

474
00:29:19,217 --> 00:29:22,051
is between us.

475
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:25,351
This is a safe place.

476
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:27,217
No, it's not.

477
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:28,917
Nowhere is.

478
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:31,051
Don't you feel safe around your family?

479
00:29:33,051 --> 00:29:35,684
My family? Safe?

480
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:40,550
Well, your mother seems like a strong woman.

481
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,351
Doesn't that make you feel safe?

482
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,017
It might, if that's what she wanted.

483
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:51,450
Safe is the last thing she wants me to feel.

484
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:54,684
I find that hard to believe.

485
00:29:54,684 --> 00:29:57,917
Oh, I'm sure she's right.

486
00:29:57,917 --> 00:30:00,051
She's always right.

487
00:30:04,384 --> 00:30:08,384
Fear can be a good thing.

488
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,817
On a bad day, it'll keep you alive.

489
00:30:13,251 --> 00:30:15,784
Do you have bad days like that?

490
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:34,497
I was, uh...

491
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:38,596
thinking about

492
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:40,662
that time we met.

493
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:45,196
You found me outside the bunker.

494
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:47,030
When you went to take a leak

495
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:49,497
and almost talked yourself
into eating your gun?

496
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:55,562
I don't think I've ever thanked you

497
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,430
for what you said that day.

498
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:01,629
I think the exact words were,

499
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:04,163
"your fly's open."

500
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,296
Yeah.

501
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:07,796
It was.

502
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:47,363
Is there a word for what we just did?

503
00:31:50,763 --> 00:31:51,896
A word?

504
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:53,963
For what we just did.

505
00:31:53,963 --> 00:31:56,629
I can think of a few, yeah.

506
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:58,596
Can you?

507
00:31:58,596 --> 00:31:59,629
You wanna hear 'em?

508
00:31:59,629 --> 00:32:02,497
No.

509
00:32:02,497 --> 00:32:04,163
I want a new one.

510
00:32:06,196 --> 00:32:08,529
Is this your way of getting rid of me?

511
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,829
You'll be gone soon enough.

512
00:32:15,963 --> 00:32:18,230
What do we need a new word for?

513
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,829
I'm pretty sure if I use one of the old ones

514
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:21,363
you'll still do it with me.

515
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,963
I might choose

516
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:29,163
to misunderstand.

517
00:32:29,163 --> 00:32:30,896
The old words.

518
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:35,230
I have a new life, Derek.

519
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,230
I want new words.

520
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,863
Think of one and I might let you stay.

521
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:53,929
I'm thirsty.

522
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:00,163
Can you get me a drink, please?

523
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,263
I don't think I've ever
seen anything like it.

524
00:33:27,263 --> 00:33:28,996
It's for my daughter.

525
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:31,863
I'm sure she'll love it.

526
00:33:31,863 --> 00:33:33,163
You think so?

527
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,996
I don't know what she loves.

528
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:40,629
How goes the robot hunt, Mr. Ellison?

529
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:44,596
Absurd, when you put it like that.

530
00:33:44,596 --> 00:33:46,929
If you need any resources, you let me know.

531
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:53,463
I do have a question, if that's all right.

532
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:55,330
The basement.

533
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:58,130
What's happening down there?

534
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,729
It seems that there's high security.

535
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:03,929
And for good reason, Mr. Ellison.

536
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:06,397
We're building something.

537
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:11,662
Good luck on your hunt.

538
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,562
Sorry about the confusion.

539
00:34:17,562 --> 00:34:19,896
My assistant's out today.

540
00:34:19,896 --> 00:34:22,996
The temp agency's sending someone.

541
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:24,629
You all right?

542
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,763
You said this was a safe place, right?

543
00:34:30,763 --> 00:34:32,696
That I could say anything?

544
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,863
That's right.

545
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,247
You have to understand,

546
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:17,080
My mom doesn't want me coming here.

547
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,913
She worries.

548
00:35:18,913 --> 00:35:21,447
About you?

549
00:35:21,447 --> 00:35:22,880
About everybody.

550
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,514
Well, what about your sister?

551
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,980
Is she worried about her too?

552
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:32,546
My sister's...

553
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:34,147
stronger than I am.

554
00:36:00,147 --> 00:36:03,013
Someone broke into your house?

555
00:36:03,013 --> 00:36:06,380
She forgot my birthday.

556
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,180
I thought she did.

557
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:14,579
She sent my sister out for a cake.

558
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:20,846
We were alone, and a man broke in.

559
00:36:27,347 --> 00:36:29,646
He wanted computer equipment.

560
00:36:34,913 --> 00:36:36,913
He tied us up.

561
00:36:36,913 --> 00:36:38,646
What happened next?

562
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:45,047
Nothing.

563
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:50,013
Nothing happened.

564
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:55,713
The guy got what he wanted and he let us go

565
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:59,280
you know,

566
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,047
John,

567
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:03,980
sometimes children feel like they need to--

568
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,913
to protect their parents.

569
00:37:06,913 --> 00:37:09,047
But that's not your job.

570
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:16,380
You're not one of my vets.

571
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,347
You're not a-- you're not a soldier.

572
00:37:20,347 --> 00:37:22,514
You get to be a kid.

573
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:28,846
No.

574
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:10,213
It was here for Dr. Sherman.

575
00:39:10,213 --> 00:39:12,846
- It was there to kill him.
- Or to protect him.

576
00:39:12,846 --> 00:39:14,646
Whatever Sherman is or isn't supposed to do,

577
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,646
he's gonna live to do it.

578
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:18,646
For now.

579
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:21,113
Well, I guess we're not gonna
get any answers from this.

580
00:39:21,113 --> 00:39:22,247
What'd you do to it?

581
00:39:22,247 --> 00:39:24,213
Nothing.

582
00:39:24,213 --> 00:39:27,147
Once I accessed the CPU,
the chip destroyed itself.

583
00:39:27,147 --> 00:39:29,414
This model's been redesigned.

584
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:30,813
With a self-destruct feature?

585
00:39:36,047 --> 00:39:38,113
Skynet must not want me reprogramming

586
00:39:38,113 --> 00:39:39,414
in the future.

587
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:40,746
This is one way to stop you.

588
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,646
Well, I guess they're getting smarter.

589
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:43,980
We should too.

590
00:39:49,813 --> 00:39:53,147
Oh, time's up, Savannah.

591
00:39:53,147 --> 00:39:55,080
See you next week.

592
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,946
Could you play for a minute, Savannah?

593
00:39:56,946 --> 00:40:00,913
I'd like to speak with the doctor.

594
00:40:00,913 --> 00:40:02,980
I'm very impressed with your work.

595
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,480
Oh, well, you've done some good work too,

596
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,980
Miss Weaver.

597
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,813
Um, Savannah seems happier.

598
00:40:13,813 --> 00:40:15,746
I gather you've worked hard

599
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,546
to show her the mother she knew

600
00:40:17,546 --> 00:40:19,846
before her father's death.

601
00:40:19,846 --> 00:40:21,946
I have, yes.

602
00:40:21,946 --> 00:40:23,980
But I wasn't speaking of your
work with Savannah.

603
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,313
I meant the insight you had into my project.

604
00:40:27,313 --> 00:40:30,447
I could use someone with your
instincts on my team.

605
00:40:30,447 --> 00:40:32,047
I'm--

606
00:40:32,047 --> 00:40:33,746
I'm flattered,

607
00:40:33,746 --> 00:40:37,613
but I do have a responsibility to my patients.

608
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,746
As a consultant then.

609
00:40:41,746 --> 00:40:44,746
You compared the AI to a child.

610
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:46,147
Help me raise it.

611
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:47,514
Well, I--

612
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,313
You realize you're talking to a man

613
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,380
who doesn't even know how
to run his own lawnmower?

614
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,347
Just treat it like one of your patients.

615
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:56,313
You'll do quite well.

616
00:41:01,447 --> 00:41:03,013
When I was a child,

617
00:41:03,013 --> 00:41:06,113
I did my sums on rolls of butcher paper.

618
00:41:06,113 --> 00:41:10,247
My father would bring them home from work.

619
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:12,347
I liked the way the paper smelled.

620
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:16,147
That's my most vivid memory from childhood.

621
00:41:16,147 --> 00:41:17,646
What did the paper smell like?

622
00:41:17,646 --> 00:41:19,746
Cow's blood.

623
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:30,946
In 1678,

624
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,980
doctors diagnosed the mental affliction

625
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,147
soldiers suffered from as "nostalgia."

626
00:41:40,946 --> 00:41:42,946
So homesickness.

627
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:45,746
A longing to return to the past.

628
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:48,579
The cruel reality of war

629
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:51,414
is that there is no return home.

630
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:53,746
No return to innocence.

631
00:41:57,913 --> 00:42:00,380
What is lost is lost forever.

632
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,147
Like my father,

633
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,480
war's wounds have bled me dry.

634
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,646
No words of comfort.

635
00:42:18,113 --> 00:42:20,147
No words of forgiveness.

636
00:42:25,846 --> 00:42:27,880
No words at all.

637
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,846
I have to say,
I was surprised when you called.

638
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:39,247
Why don't you start by
telling me why you're here.
