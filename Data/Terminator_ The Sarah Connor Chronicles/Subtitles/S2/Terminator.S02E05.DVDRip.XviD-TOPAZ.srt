- He had experience...

Only good thing about them.

to find those names?

43

he's found them too.

- Yeah, I've got a plan.

It's not. It's a place.

to hanging himself?

Schedule? What schedule is that?

August 2009
new automated system comes online...

188
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:17,112

Prep you for OCC.

- What's this?
- It's a merit for squaring away Pyle.

00:15:21,415 --> 00:15:22,473
And that's a demerit.

the dumb son of a bitch together again.

This is his life's ambition.
I intend to help him achieve it.

He's a good guy, though.

311
00:22:57,804 --> 00:23:00,170
He's just...
He's a lot to take sometimes.

312
00:23:01,374 --> 00:23:04,502

313
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:07,202
What are you supposed to say to that?

314
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,541
You mean, how do you measure up?

315
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,142
Every man in my family
going back five generations...

316
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,188
...has been a general, or statesman,
CEO, something amazing.

317
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:19,552
They all went here.

321
00:23:30,336 --> 00:23:35,774
...I'm all alone, I'm going flat out,
everything just sort of...

322
00:23:35,942 --> 00:23:37,307
...falls away.

323
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:40,409
But sometimes I wish it...

324
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:42,739

00:23:56,062 --> 00:23:58,121
Her name's Alicia.

00:23:58,331 --> 00:24:00,299
She's amazing, dude.

00:24:00,466 --> 00:24:03,333
She started at Dartmouth this year.
She's a runner like me.

330
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:07,233
She's coming home in a couple weeks,
and when she goes back...

331
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:11,776
...I think I wanna go with her.
And never look back.

332
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:18,882
That's a secret, Baum.

333
00:24:19,886 --> 00:24:22,047
You treat it as such.

334
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:28,753
I always do.

335
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:54,481
I was just on the roof.

336
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:59,789
It's flat terrain all around,
but the woods are a problem.

337
00:24:59,993 --> 00:25:03,121
When it comes,
that's where it'll come from.

338
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:05,457
You're alone and exposed here.

339
00:25:05,632 --> 00:25:07,532
It's not good.

340
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:10,926
And you're gonna tell me,
"I know better."

341
00:25:13,606 --> 00:25:15,335
Bedell is quitting.

342
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:17,669
Leaving school.

343
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:19,675
No, he isn't.

344
00:25:19,846 --> 00:25:22,178
- He won't.
- Well, he is.

345
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:25,044
He doesn't. He graduates.

346
00:25:25,218 --> 00:25:26,549
Goes to West Point.

347
00:25:27,287 --> 00:25:29,016
Why?

348
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:35,158
Because the future already happened,

00:37:36,482 --> 00:37:39,645
Look, I'm sorry, I didn't...

523
00:37:39,818 --> 00:37:42,013
I didn't mean this.

524
00:37:42,187 --> 00:37:44,280
This was never the plan. Ever.

525
00:37:47,326 --> 00:37:48,657
What was the plan?

526
00:37:49,395 --> 00:37:51,488
I don't know.
You can't always have one.

527
00:37:51,663 --> 00:37:55,326
Not all the time. Sometimes you just do.
And I did, to you.

528
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:59,130
Well, you saved my life, right?

529
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:03,673
So good plan.

530
00:38:04,676 --> 00:38:06,075
Thank you.

531
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:12,142
I said thank you.

532
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:14,808
I know, I just...

533
00:38:15,788 --> 00:38:17,915
I haven't heard that in...

534
00:38:20,225 --> 00:38:22,216
I haven't heard that.

535
00:38:22,394 --> 00:38:25,557
"You're welcome." Say it.

536
00:38:30,569 --> 00:38:32,560
You're welcome.

537
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:39,000
Now say, "Marty, let me help you
with your book report."

538
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,453
I can't call my mom...

539
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:55,423
...and you're not doing anything, so...

540
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,840
Thank you, Marty.

541
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:14,135
You're welcome.

is a rescue extraction.

Meet Old Fred.

544
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:25,117
He weighs about 75 pounds and needs
to be carried from place to place.

545
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:28,453
This is his life's ambition.

546
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:31,323
- And I intend to help him...

Seniors, get your people on-line.
Ten-meter spacing. Eyes up.

548
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:39,161
- What about the obstacle course?
- New exercise.

549
00:39:41,006 --> 00:39:42,473
Guy with a gun is gonna come.

550
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:45,975
Do not initiate contact.

551
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:47,772
Not even for laughs.
Are we clear?

552
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:50,612
You see him, send a signal.

553
00:39:50,782 --> 00:39:54,274
If I see that hand signal
before I see our infiltrator, you win.

554
00:39:54,753 --> 00:39:56,311
Exercise over.

555
00:39:56,488 --> 00:39:58,479
Where will you be?

556
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:02,960
Looking for that hand signal.

557
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:05,259
You're with me.

558
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:08,028
You too.

559
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,864
Those are detonators.

560
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:19,374
Claymore simulators.
Here, here and here.

561
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:23,174
Wait for the signal. Watch for me to lead
the infiltrator past this line.

562
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:25,714
When he enters the kill zone,
hit the detonator...

563
00:40:25,918 --> 00:40:28,716
...the simulators go off.
End of story. We go home.

564
00:40:29,321 --> 00:40:31,915
Wait, sir.
The last-minute change in mission...

565
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:35,358
...pre-positioned equipment,

00:40:37,129 --> 00:40:40,428

00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:44,634
Son of a bitch. No, no, no.

569
00:40:44,803 --> 00:40:47,328
Gotta be a little more specific.

570
00:40:47,506 --> 00:40:49,064
DEREK:
Stray shot from one of the kids.

571
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,936
Must have hit one of the EFPs.

572
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:53,903
It set them all off.
We're swinging in the wind.

573
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,876
- Where's the Ogre?
- Coming to kill us.

574
00:40:56,048 --> 00:40:58,312
- Where do you think it is?
- Where is the tank?

575
00:40:59,685 --> 00:41:02,347
About a block away.
Moving towards us.

576
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:04,716
No way
we've got enough powder to kill it.

577
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,518
I'm gonna lay some covering fire,
drop a couple Endos.

578
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:11,493
- That'll give Kyle time to get back.
- Reese. We can kill that Ogre.

579
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:13,993
We got one more magic bullet.

580
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,190
We just gotta get it out there.

581
00:41:29,348 --> 00:41:32,283
MARTIN: "The Emerald City
was soon left far behind.

582
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:36,353
As they advanced, the ground
became rougher and hillier...

583
00:41:36,521 --> 00:41:40,617
...for there were no farms nor houses
in this country of the West.

584
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:44,057
MARTIN: Before night,
Dorothy and Toto and the Lion...

585
00:41:44,263 --> 00:41:46,390
...lay down upon the grass
and fell asleep...

586
00:41:46,565 --> 00:41:50,023
...with the Woodman
and the Scarecrow keeping watch.

587
00:41:54,406 --> 00:41:58,968
Now, the wicked Witch had but one eye,
yet she could see everywhere.

588
00:41:59,144 --> 00:42:04,377
She saw Dorothy lying asleep,
with her friends all about her.

589
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:45,055
The Witch looked out
with her one eye.

590
00:42:45,724 --> 00:42:49,751
She said to the King Crow,
'Fly at once to the strangers.

591
00:42:49,928 --> 00:42:54,922
Peck out their eyes.
Tear them to pieces.'

592
00:43:04,276 --> 00:43:08,645
The wild crows flew in one great flock
toward Dorothy and her companions.

593
00:43:08,847 --> 00:43:13,113
When the little girl saw them coming,
she was afraid."

594
00:43:15,087 --> 00:43:16,884
Come here.

595
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:24,095
"But the Scarecrow said,
'This is my battle.

596
00:43:24,262 --> 00:43:27,163
Lie down beside me,
and you will not be harmed.'"

597
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:16,044
Hey! Look over here!

598
00:44:17,416 --> 00:44:20,351
It's me, Connor. John Connor.

599
00:44:24,523 --> 00:44:26,514
MARTIN:
"The Witch got into a terrible rage.

600
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:30,889
She couldn't understand how all her
plans to destroy the strangers had failed.

601
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:35,192
There was only one way left
to destroy Dorothy and her friends."

602
00:44:36,802 --> 00:44:39,168
You want me to read for a while?

603
00:44:47,312 --> 00:44:51,248
"The sky darkened, and a low
rumbling sound was heard in the air.

604
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,079
There was a rushing of many wings,
a great chattering and laughing...

605
00:44:55,253 --> 00:44:58,984
...and the sun came
out of the dark sky...

606
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:03,218
...to show the Witch
surrounded by a crowd of monkeys.

607
00:45:03,395 --> 00:45:06,592
'Go to the strangers and destroy
them all,' said the wicked Witch.

608
00:45:14,906 --> 00:45:17,170
SARAH:
But Dorothy they did not harm at all.

609
00:45:17,342 --> 00:45:21,676
Carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy
in their arms and carried her to the Witch.

610
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:41,188
The Witch looked into
the child's eyes...

611
00:45:41,366 --> 00:45:43,732
...and saw how simple the soul
behind them was...

612
00:45:43,902 --> 00:45:46,234
...and that she did not know
of her power.

613
00:45:46,404 --> 00:45:49,237
The witch said to Dorothy,
'Come with me.

614
00:45:50,208 --> 00:45:53,700
For if you do not
I will make an end of you.'

615
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:55,540
The little girl grew angry.

616
00:45:55,714 --> 00:45:59,081
'You are a wicked creature! ' she cried.

617
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:02,151
In her anger, she picked up
a bucket of water...

618
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,483
...and dashed it over the Witch,
wetting her from head to foot.

619
00:46:05,657 --> 00:46:07,750
The Witch gave a cry of fear.

620
00:46:07,926 --> 00:46:11,726
As Dorothy looked in wonder,
the Witch began to shrink away.

621
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:16,300
'See what you have done!'
The Witch screamed, 'I shall melt away.'

622
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:22,465
With these words,
she fell into a melted, shapeless mass.

623
00:46:22,641 --> 00:46:26,577
The wicked Witch
had come to an end.

624
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:30,340
Being at last free to do as she chose,
Dorothy ran...

625
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:34,178
...no longer a prisoner
in a strange land."

No. I'm not a spy.

Yeah, I'm a mom.

MARTIN: So this...
This is what I'm supposed to do?

637
00:48:05,443 --> 00:48:08,378
Stay here. Graduate.
Go to West Point like I don't know...

638
00:48:08,546 --> 00:48:13,279
...the end of the world is coming?
Like any of this, any of it, really matters.

639
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:16,913
It does matter.

640
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:20,521
It all matters.

641
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:22,557
You believe that?

642
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:28,423
I've got to.

00:48:34,939 --> 00:48:36,406
I'll see you around, Connor.

00:48:38,677 --> 00:48:41,578
Yeah. I guess you will.

But I can't, can I?

00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:18,915
You wanna know what happened
to Bedell? What really happened?

I don't know. Do I?

00:49:25,457 --> 00:49:28,153
I guess it depends
on who I'm talking to.

00:49:28,326 --> 00:49:31,352
John Baum or John Connor.

652
00:49:34,032 --> 00:49:36,125
Baum is just a name.

653
00:49:45,343 --> 00:49:46,674

- He's my brother.

He ran so fast.

Fast enough to get to that tank
before it got to Kyle's position.

667
00:50:39,197 --> 00:50:41,893
Fast enough to blow it sky high.

We rescued 40 prisoners that day.

669
00:50:53,378 --> 00:50:55,744
One of them was John Connor.
