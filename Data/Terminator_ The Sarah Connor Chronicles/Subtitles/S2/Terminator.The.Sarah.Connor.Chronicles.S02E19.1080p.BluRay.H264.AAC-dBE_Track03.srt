You're stuck under the ocean

Don't worry about Queeg.
He's a good bloke.

00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,970
-He's not on our side.
-Why are we 300 miles off course?

00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:16,516
Our orders come from John Connor.
Deitz will retrieve a package.

6
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:19,143
We will deliver this package
to Serrano Point.

Connor sent me. I've come for that.

I've planted an explosive in my skull.

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,652
-Cameron.
-I know. Riley's dead.

11
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:29,779
-Cameron didn't do it.
-Can you be sure?

12
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,615
-She told me.
-Just like she told you she loved you.

00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm really sorry, John.

16
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,799
She was a good kid. She didn't deserve
what happened to her.

17
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,178
Few people do.

18
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,600
How long do you think
you could survive?

19
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:04,731
With Cameron.

20
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:09,694
If she wanted to kill you. Face to face.

21
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:15,116
What kind of weapon do I have?

22
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,412
Your fists.

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,748
And your elbows.

24
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,959
And your fingernails and your teeth.

00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,335
Against her...

26
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,380
...those aren't weapons.

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,674
No. They're not.

28
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:38,347
You already know
the answer to that, John.

29
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,434
If she wants me dead, I'm dead.

30

If she wants you dead, you're dead.

What are you getting at?

32
00:01:49,902 --> 00:01:52,653
I wanna talk about something.

33
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,156
All right.

34
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,703
-I wanna talk to you about the future.
-Yours?

00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,915

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,277
Or is it classified,
between you and Queeg?

00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,155
It's between Queeg and Queeg.

No. It doesn't. Not even a little.

Well, it should.
And not just a little, but a lot.

51

We were sent to pick up the box
and bring it back.

52
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,132
So we're picking up the box
and bringing it back.

Look around you. We work for them.

of Indian Country. And for what?

59
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,784

00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:46,744

You shouldn't have done that.

It was a risk. I know.

00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,378
I don't mean the risk.

78
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,887
You shouldn't have to remember her
like that. That's all.

79
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,939
There were things I needed to see.

80
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,194
Things I had to understand.

81
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,656
You understand them now?

82
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,951
I think so.

-It's not your concern.

-All of it.

00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,708
Well, I broke the rules.

130
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:14,048
What was the name of that hippie town
we were in before Nebraska?

131
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,258
-Garb-something.
-Garberville.

132
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:18,510
Right. Wow, that was a culture shock.

133
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,847

and good old boys to...

134
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,516
...pot growers

135
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,937
There was only one Sequoia.
There were three Sages, though.

136
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,108

00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,780
You just started making friends,
fitting in.

138
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,782
Fitting in?

139
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,617
I was getting in fights every day.

140
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:44,286
Well, you won those fights.

141
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,706
That's one way of looking at it.

142
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,505
I hated that town.

143
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:04,139
The matte layer is critical. It both allows
the colors to stick to the miniature...

144
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,726
...and it provides the finished statue
with the illusion of depth.

145
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,896
But it's the detail work
I find the most interesting.

146
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,733
It challenges my fine motor control.
And there are so many choices.

147
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,069
The eyes, for example.

148
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,279
The window to the soul.

149
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,658
They're the window to the soul.
I read that.

00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,326
That's what they say.

151
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,913
Then I should
choose my paint more carefully.

152
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,541
It doesn't matter, John Henry.

153
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,169
It's a statue. It's an object.
It doesn't have a soul.

154
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,756
It has eyes.

155
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,927
Your eyes look tired. Is your soul tired?

156
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,059
No, my soul isn't tired. But I am.
And I am going home.

157
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:54,189
Please don't.

158
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,359

159
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,284
The eyes.

00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,911

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,374

-Yes?

163
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,509
Does this make us friends?

164
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,791
-You're not eating.
-What?

165
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,710
You're not eating.

166
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,588
What's the matter,
you don't like hash browns?

167
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,715
No, I like them. I'm just not hungry.

168
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,800
You're always hungry.

169
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,844
Everyone's always hungry.

170
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,890
Jeez, Dietz. How am I supposed to eat
with Goodnow dead and that thing...

171
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,768
...running around out there?
Give me a break.

172
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,270
Have mine.

173
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,272
I said, I'm not hungry.

174
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,858
Maybe.

175
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:25,781
Or maybe you're not really Garvin.
Maybe you're that thing.

176
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,659
-Maybe you're freaking crazy.
-He could be metal.

177
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,871
-We wouldn't know until it was too late.
-Wanna see metal? I'll show you metal.

178
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,957
Enough.

179
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,878
You're right, Garvin. It's not you.

180
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,300
You're not the one who spends all day
locked in a room with metal.

181
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,929
Stand down, Dietz.

182
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:54,685
I knew you were a metal lover,
but maybe you're more than that.

183
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,313
Maybe you're one of them.

184
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,734
Just like that little metal bitch
that follows Connor everywhere.

185
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,571
Maybe we should check. For safety.

186
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,676
Report to your duty stations.

187
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:53,243
SARAH:
You're not leaving this house.

188
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,872
John needs me.

189
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,875
If John needed you,
he would have asked for you. He didn't.

190
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:02,169
You're not leaving this house.

191
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:06,340
The police could identify Riley's body
at any time.

192
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:11,053
-I need to be with him if they do.
-If they do, they'll probably come here.

193
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,184
So we should be happy he's out.

194
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,399
-Why are you here?
-Protect John. Hunt Skynet.

195
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:28,362
-Stop Judgement Day.
-But why are you here?

196
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,408
Right now, with us?

197
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,412
John sent you here from the future.

198
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:42,250
He sent you away. Away from him.

199
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,048
Maybe you should think about that.

200
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,221
Maybe you should think about why
he didn't want you around anymore.

201
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,819
Hello, Ms. Weaver.
How are you this evening?

202
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,279
I'm well.

203
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,282
-You're up late.
-Yes.

204
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:17,452
I convinced Mr. Ellison
to leave this body operational.

205
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,705
Did you, now?

206
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,083
-That's progress.
-Yes.

207
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:26,420
He agreed it was important
I finish painting.

208
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,134
I made its eyes blue.
They're the window to the soul.

209
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,513
Yes. They are.

210
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,143
While I've been painting,
I've been taking inventory of Zeira Corp.

211
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,812
I've discovered many interesting things.

212
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,356
Did you know there's
a peregrine falcon nest...

213
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,984
...on the ledge
of this building's 23rd floor?

214
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,111
The eggs should be hatching soon.

215
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,197
I knew about the nest.
I didn't know about the eggs.

216
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,284
Also, I discovered
in your private database...

217
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,871
...several letters of resignation
from former employees.

218
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,542
Richard Hack, Lowell Rogers,
and Justin Tuck.

219
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:09,796
The documents included information
about home sales...

220
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:14,050
...changes of address, and new jobs to
which these employees would be moving.

221
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,845
However, I can't find records
of these employees...

222
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,306
...in their new locations
or at their new jobs.

223
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,515
Is that so?

224
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:24,686
Additionally, I found letters of resignation
from all members of Project Babylon...

225
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,023
...including Mr. Murch and Mr. Ellison.

226
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:30,150
Mr. Ellison's file includes documents...

227
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:34,070
...showing that he's taken a new job
and moved to Copenhagen, Denmark.

228
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,365
The documents have no dates.

229
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,285
Now, that is very interesting.

230
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,080
Mr. Ellison is our friend.

231
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,875
Yes, he is our friend.

232
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,711
Are you going to kill him?

233
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,678
Mr. Ellison has proven himself
to be a capable and loyal employee.

234
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,224
-But he's still a human being.
-Human life is sacred.

235
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,559
We have to be prepared
for any contingency.

236
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,686
What contingency would that be?

237
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,565
Humans will disappoint you.

238
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:26,039
Hey, it's Jesse, right?

239
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,750
-Right.
-That was a pretty long swim tonight.

240
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,087
Was it? Must have lost track of time.

241
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:34,422
It's easy to do.
Happens to me all the time.

242
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,091
Hey...

243
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,927
...that blond girl you're normally with,
your friend.

244
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,763
-Where is she tonight?
-Don't know.

245
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,473
Why?

246
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,101
Don't think I've ever seen you
in here without her.

247
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,812
-I'll bring her next time.
-She's a nice girl.

248
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,438
Yeah.

249
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:52,566
She-- She is.

250
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,489
-You look ill.
-I'm fine.

251
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,494
Most likely a concussion.
You require medical attention. Rest.

252
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:06,329
What about Dietz?

253
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,249
Dietz attempted to murder
a superior officer.

254
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,127
He incited the crew to riot,
possibly mutiny.

255
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,962
The penalty is death.

256
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,468
You have no right
to impose summary justice.

257
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,471
Not like that.

258
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,473
That's not how we do it.

259
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,476
Mr. Dietz's behavior
threatened our mission.

260
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,313
What mission? Hm?

261
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,482
Your behavior threatens our mission.

262
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,443
This crew is tearing itself apart.

263
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:40,030
If they needed to know more,
they would have been told more.

264
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:47,203
Whatever we brought aboard this ship,
it is dangerous.

265
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:52,792
It killed a woman. It took her shape.

266
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:58,506
You can't expect us
to act like that didn't happen.

267
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:01,843
-Like we didn't see it.
-Report to your rack. You're ill.

268
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,475
You really wanna do it this way?

269
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,644
I don't understand. Do what?

270
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:18,693
As XO and ranking human
onboard this boat...

271
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,196
...I am relieving you of command.

272
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:24,240
On suspicion of compromise
to your programming.

273
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:28,328
Please move away
from the controls, captain.

274
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,849
Submit to chip extraction.
The chip tech will decide what to do.

275
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:01,236
Chief of the Boat,
escort Commander Flores to her rack.

276
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,863
She is ill.

277
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:11,413
I gave you an instruction, captain.
You must comply.

278
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,792
My mission order overrides
standard behavioral protocols.

279
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:18,253
You have no authority on this boat.

280
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:21,631
Let me see your orders. Now.

281
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:24,592
My orders are classified.

282
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:26,302
You look ill.

283
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,308
Queeg.

284
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:36,938
We can't take that thing
to Serrano Point.

285
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:41,026
-If Connor needs to know what it can--
-John Connor knows what he needs to.

286
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:46,031
Return to your rack.
Your behavior threatens our mission.

287
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,096
Chief of the Boat...

288
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:16,144
...record that I relieved the captain
and assumed command, time and date.

289
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,146
We can't drive the boat without him.

290
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:19,773
We're not driving the boat.

291
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,108
[METAL CREAKING]

292
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,444
Commander Flores!

293
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,530
[ALARMS WAILING]

294
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:31,659
JESSE: We're taking her to crush depth.
Mother Nature will handle the metal.

295
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,334
Attention, all decks. Abandon the boat.

296
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,671
Move! Move!

297
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,023
I'm sorry.

298
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,662
MAN 1: Let's go.
MAN 2: Go, go, go.

299
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:22,168
-You okay?
-Just get in there.

300
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:27,757
You're coming, right? Not going down
with the ship or anything crazy like that?

301
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,553
No. Nothing crazy.

302
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:43,022
Who are you? What do you want?

303
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,441
Tell John Connor...

304
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:48,027
...the answer is no.

305
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,516
If you pretend not to know me,
I might shoot you in the head.

306
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:30,028
We owe Riley the truth,
don't you think?

307
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,495
We owe the dead that much.

308
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,210
You're John Connor.

309
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,589
Yes, I am.

310
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:52,300
Where is she?

311
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,719
The metal.

312
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,556
If she were here, you would be dead.
You know that.

313
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,394
Would you please give me your gun?
You're not gonna shoot me.

314
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:19,369
You know, I've been running
from the machines my whole life.

315
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,706
They tried to kill my mom
before I was even born.

316
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,128
When I was 12,
they sent one after me.

317
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,217
I was a kid.

318
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,180
I was stupid.
I didn't know what it was all about.

319
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:47,188
Both times, future me
sent someone back to stop them.

320
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,149
The first time, it was a soldier.

321
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:56,197
His name was Kyle Reese,
and he died saving my mother's life.

322
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:59,242
The second time, it was a machine.

323
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:05,164
I used to wonder why I did that.
Why I took that chance.

324
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,043
I don't wonder anymore.

325
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,719
Human beings can't be replaced.

326
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,139
They can't be rebuilt.

327
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:24,017
They die and they never come back.

328
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,522
You know, it wasn't Derek who told me,
if that's what you're wondering.

329
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,735
He loves you, you know. Derek.

330
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,404
You and me?

331
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,491
We're the only things he has
in this world.

332
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,702
The only things.

333
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,123
He's like Riley in that way.

334
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:56,257
See, she made mistakes.

335
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,510
Small things, sometimes.

336
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,514
A word or a phrase.

337
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,186
Carrots and apples.

338
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:11,814
I'm guessing that's yours.

339
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:18,696
When we were in Mexico, she heard
my real name. She ignored it...

340
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,866
...but a man took my picture
and she destroyed his camera.

341
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:25,620
She put herself between me
and a machine that was hunting me.

342
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,794
So one day, I realized
she wasn't treating me like John Baum.

343
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,296
She was treating me like John Connor.

344
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,341
When was that?

345
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,095
I don't remember exactly.

346
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:46,641
It was a bad day, though.

347
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,937
Bad day.

348
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:54,232
Anyway, I started following her...

349
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,611
...and the rest was easy.

350
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,613
And hard.

351
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,491
She wanted to tell you.

352
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,536
I know...

353
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,080
...but she didn't.

354
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,585
She do that to you?

355
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,506
See, she figured out
what you really had planned.

356
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,759
Figured it out before I did.

357
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:25,805
I couldn't explain why she would
tell the school counselor...

358
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:27,932
...or go to DCFS.

359
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,894
She didn't, did she?

360
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:40,403
I only understood
after I saw how you'd hurt her.

361
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:43,156
That's when I knew
what you tried to do...

362
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,241
...and how it went wrong.

363
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,286
You saw her?

364
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:50,496
I'm sorry.

365
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:54,625
Yeah. Everybody says that.

366
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,632
The thing is...

367
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:05,887
...this is all my fault.

368
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,639
I knew Riley was in trouble.

369
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:12,894
I didn't help her.
I should have, but I didn't.

370
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,271
I knew what she was.

371
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,107
I didn't try to stop her.

372
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,568
You wanted it to be real.

373
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:23,196
Or maybe I wanted to win.

374
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:28,618
You didn't wanna be John Baum.

375
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,579
You wanted to be John Connor.

376
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,666
That's just the thing, isn't it?

377
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,962
I am John Connor.

378
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:51,891
Go.

379
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:58,981
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

380
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:02,777
If I have to live with this, so do you.

381
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:14,372
Would it have worked?

382
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,831
What?

383
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,960
If the cyborg had murdered the girl.

384
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,128
Or if I could've made you
believe she had.

385
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:25,341
Would I have sent Cameron away?
Would I have killed her?

386
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,513
No.

387
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,394
Well...

388
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,439
...it's a damn shame, then.

389
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,568
It's a damn waste.

390

JESSE: I've told you.
-You've told me nothing useful.

391
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,295
Your actions have resulted
in the loss of a T-888...

392
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,880
...and one of our most important
strategic assets.

393
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:09,594
-The submarine is irreplaceable.
-The Trip-8. The sub.

394
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,179
You forgot the people.

395
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:16,350
You never mention
the people who died. Ever.

396
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:20,855
Yes. The people. And the box.

397
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:25,318
We opened the damn box.
Hell came out of it.

398
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,612
How many times
do we need to go over this?

399
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,530

400
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,534

401
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,871
-Take me to Connor.
-You can tell me.

No.

403
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,502
The liquid-metal thing inside the box....

404
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,380
It came to me before we escaped...

405
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:50,009
...and it gave me a message
for John Connor.

406
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,844
For him.

407
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,139
Not for you.

408
00:32:58,185 --> 00:33:02,813
Telling me is the same as telling John.

What the hell are we fighting for...

412
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:22,416
...if telling you is the same thing
as telling Connor?

413
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,335
You're a damn machine.

414
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,838

It's not the same.

To hell with you.
You tell John Connor...

417
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:41,185
...that the metal monster said,
"The answer is no."

418
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,736
What does that mean, huh?

419

Hey, tell me.

what was the question?

"Will you join us?"

00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,337

-That was the question.

I'm sorry for your loss.

425
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:29,233
The doctors aren't certain
if it happened because of the fight...

426
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:33,571
...or because of the rapid change in
pressure when you scuttled the Carter.

427

Billy Wisher was my best friend.

00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:43,849
He was in my squad.
We fought together.

We saw things you can't imagine.

He was like my brother,
and I loved him.

But it turns out
I never really knew him.

439
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,244
His real name was Andy Goode...

440
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,581
...and back here, in this world,
he created a computer program.

441

...because I killed him.

445
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:26,475
I came back here and I killed him.

00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,269
He was my brother...

447
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:32,773
...and I loved him, and I killed him.

448
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,363

449
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,326
