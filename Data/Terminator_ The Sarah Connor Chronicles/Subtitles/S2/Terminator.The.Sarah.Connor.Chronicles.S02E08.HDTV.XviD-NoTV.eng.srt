1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,930
Previously on Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,530
I'm here because Sarah Connor is a diluted,

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,800
dangerous, grade A whack-a-mole

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,130
who killed a man because she
believed that in the future

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,030
he'll invent a computer system

6
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:11,800
that declares war on the world.

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,760
I'm looking for this girl.

8
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,130
Have you seen my niece?

9
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,060
There was a guy here looking for your sister.

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,900
Get rid of him! Riley!

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,200
If you don't leave, I'm calling the police.

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,100
That guy is really dangerous.
That's all you need to know.

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,300
Really dangerous.

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,600
This has nothing to do with Riley.

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,930
You're pissed off

16
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:30,460
Because I found someone I actually like

17
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,100
spending time with, and it's not you.

18
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,430
Riley, look at me.

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,200
Show me that.

20
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,030
That's horrifying.

21
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,500
Yeah, well, it's supposed to
stop cars from playing

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,160
ping-pong with your head.

23
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,230
Hey, I think your mom's out here.

24
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,360
Hi, Mrs. Baum!

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,930
Thank you so much for having me over.

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,060
I didn't even know if you were busy
tonight when I texted you.

27
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,230
I'm never busy.

28
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,400
So I should do it again sometime.

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,160
Or maybe you could call.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,700
You know, with your voice.

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,000
Maybe I could try that.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,130
Maybe you should.

33
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,160
See you soon.

34
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,600
Okay, be safe.

35
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,830
I bought her a helmet.

36
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,260
Responsible.

37
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,800
You think it'll stop a bullet?

38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,400
Why, you gonna take a shot at her?

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,200
A lot of bullets fly around here.

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,660
Someone will.

41
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,000
You care about this girl?

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,160
Yeah.

43
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,000
Then leave her alone.

44
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,060
I'll talk to John.

45
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,560
John's not listening.

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,530
He's always listening.

47
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,630
I was going to suggest a safe.

48
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,130
Well, you might have suggested
it before we got robbed.

49
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,760
Where are you going?

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,230
I need to restock the supply drop.

51
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,730
We've been using a lot of ammunition.

52
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,100
Business has been booming.

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,130
Where's John?

54
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,900
Still in his room.

55
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,800
He hasn't gotten up yet?

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,600
He needs more sleep than you do.

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,500
It's because the circadian rhythm
of teenagers is abnormal.

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,130
How late were you up talking to him?

59
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,100
Not late.

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,660
He won't be seeing Riley anymore.

61
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,430
Is that so?

62
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,060
John's not stupid.

63
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,360
I don't like the way he responds to you.

64
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,500
You got what you wanted.

65
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,060
Where is he?

66
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,960
Check under the bed.

67
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,700
You don't know.

68
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:24,660
I didn't even know if you were busy
when I texted you tonight.

69
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm never busy.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,760
So then I guess I should do it again sometime.

71
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,530
Or maybe you could even call.

72
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,660
You know, with your voice.

73
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,600
Maybe I could try that.

74
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,530
Maybe you should.

75
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,930
See you soon.

76
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:42,960
Go, be safe.

77
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,500
I'll talk to John.

78
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,060
John's not listening.

79
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,900
He's always listening.

80
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,200
Are you busy?

81
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,900
No.

82
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,100
Did you change?

83
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,560
It's hot out.

84
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,200
Since when do you feel heat?

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
I feel heat.

86
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:52,900
Are you hoping that Riley's gonna
see us in bed together,

87
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,830
and be totally scarred for the
rest of her life or something?

88
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,930
No.

89
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,660
I watched Riley leave till I couldn't
see her anymore.

90
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,930
And then you and mom high-fived.

91
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,300
You bring danger into Riley's life.

92
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,700
I know that.

93
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,030
I'm not stupid.

94
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,400
But sometimes you do stupid things.

95
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,060
It would help me to understand why.

96
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,030
Humans do stupid things.

97
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,930
So don't worry about it,
and be happy you're a machine.

98
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,900
I'm a machine.

99
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,860
I can't be happy.

100
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,160
But I understand more than you think.

101
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,800
So you understand that I'm
going to keep seeing Riley,

102
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,660
even if everyone thinks it's a bad idea.

103
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,660
I understand that it's a bad idea.

104
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,630
And I understand that being
John Connor can be lonely.

105
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,730
Oh, yeah?

106
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,900
How do you understand that?

107
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,430
You and I talk about it a lot.

108
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,600
We do?

109
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,330
We do.

110
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,860
We will.

111
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:23,400
I need-- I need to get some sleep.

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,260
And Riley?

113
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,800
I know.

114
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,700
I know.

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,760
He won't be seeing Riley anymore.

116
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,800
I don't like the way he responds to you.

117
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,830
You got what you wanted.

118
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,100
It's just you.

119
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,100
You been stealing my supplies?

120
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,000
We needed to make a small bomb.

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,300
I set this drop up with my people for my people.

122
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,660
And everything's in here for a reason.

123
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,800
John was supposed to ask.

124
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,730
John needs to get his head in the game.

125
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,300
Maybe he couldn't find you.

126
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,660
You don't spend much time at the house.

127
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,630
I don't have a bed, remember?

128
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,460
You didn't have a bed in the old house.

129
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,500
I had a gunshot wound at the old house.

130
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,360
Yes. You almost died.

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,130
It's not the first time.

132
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,600
Who's that?

133
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,800
Alarm code from John. He's in trouble.

134
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,000
I need to get some sleep.

135
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,500
And Riley?

136
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:00,000
I know.

137
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,230
I know.

138
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,700
Yeah, right.

139
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,930
I'll be there in a few minutes.

140
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,160
Ew, please stop doing that.

141
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,500
Look, I got this from my foster parents.

142
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,060
And it's a rape whistle.

143
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,500
It's totally for moments like this.

144
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Moments like this? Yeah, all right.

145
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,600
When I was a kid, I--

146
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,730
I lived in Mexico for a year and a half.

147
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,030
In this, uh, little village called Dejalo.

148
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,030
And, uh...

149
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,930
That's where we're going.

150
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,660
Thought I'd show you around.

151
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,500
Um, well, did you run this idea by your mom?

152
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,630
Because sometimes I get the impression

153
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,500
That she doesn't really like surprises.

154
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,560
I don't care.

155
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,760
Did you guys get in a fight last night?

156
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,330
No.

157
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,830
So this is definitely a field trip,

158
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,330
and not some revenge fantasy?

159
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:04,560
All right, if you don't wanna go, that's cool.

160
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,930
But do not make me feel like I'm
kidnapping you or something.

161
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,660
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

162
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,630
You just caught me off guard.

163
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm really, really happy that you want

164
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,360
to show me where you grew up.

165
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,130
Good.

166
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,000
'cause I booked the honeymoon suite.

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,530
Wait, what?

168
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,000
It's good, right?

169
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,800
It's nice to get some space.

170
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,160
You and space.

171
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,400
You know, the first time we talked,

172
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,330
you were sitting by yourself in the grass.

173
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,960
That was space too.

174
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,060
So it was.

175
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,600
You know I used to watch you at school?

176
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,800
When the bell would ring

177
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,560
and those narrow hallways would fill up,

178
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,230
it got so loud, and people would bump into you.

179
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,660
You looked like you could just

180
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,430
jump out the window and run away.

181
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,360
God, you're such a little stalker.

182
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,660
All right, so I get that...

183
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,230
we ran away to get some space.

184
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,460
The only shame is...

185
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,830
we ran all this way, and there's
skulls everywhere.

186
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,630
What, you don't like skulls?

187
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,660
I like other things better.

188
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,660
It's for Dia de los Muertos.

189
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,630
The festival's tonight.

190
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,860
Nice.

191
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:33,960
Skulls and darkness, how charming.

192
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,700
Doing the best I can.

193
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:45,160
I never want to leave this room.

194
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,830
Wait, I think I see the problem.

195
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,830
Would you just get in here?
We don't need bubbles.

196
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,400
Well, there's bubbles to be had,

197
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,700
and I'm going to have bubbles.

198
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,100
Ah, not bad, huh?

199
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,630
You're a total pro.

200
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:09,200
Wait, you didn't live here
with your mom, did you?

201
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,460
No.

202
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,830
We, uh--

203
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,900
we actually had a cabana on the beach.

204
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,130
I think we had very different childhoods.

205
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,830
It wasn't always good.

206
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,300
Sometimes I wish we just stayed here.

207
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,460
Away from everybody.

208
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:29,000
People suck.

209
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,130
Not just people.

210
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,830
No, I mean--

211
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,400
when you meet someone, you don't

212
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,930
really expect to give a damn about them, right?

213
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,830
Who's got the time?

214
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,060
Life's too short, and people suck.

215
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,230
I don't like getting attached to people.

216
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100
So...

217
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,530
Why were you living in Mexico?

218
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,560
Oh, you're thinking of a lie or a joke.

219
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,830
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

220
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,060
-You have a tell.
-I just don't want to sit around

221
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,100
and talk about my messed up childhood.

222
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,730
Can't we just enjoy ourselves?

223
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,530
Yeah, fine.

224
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,830
Enjoy yourself, John.

225
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,130
I'm sure we're not the only couple

226
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,060
that's found themselves in a honeymoon suite,

227
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,830
and not known the first thing about each other.

228
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,830
You're right.

229
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,430
People suck.

230
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,360
Podemos tener picante, por favor?

231
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
El verde?

232
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,400
Es muy picante como fuego.

233
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,460
Si, exactamente.

234
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,930
What was that about?

235
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,630
Hot sauce.

236
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,660
You know, uh, they do this killer
thanksgiving buffet here.

237
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:16,030
I bet.

238
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:18,300
See?

239
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,860
I'm telling you all sorts of good stuff.

240
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,400
I'm not trying to be your stalker, I just--

241
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,100
I think this is what we should be doing.

242
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,230
You know, getting to know each other.

243
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,700
Well, I have a question for you.

244
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,200
You said, uh, that I have a tell.

245
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,030
What is it?

246
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,160
Okay, you promise not to obsess
over it or anything?

247
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,430
What a handsome couple.

248
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,630
And for only $5,

249
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,130
-a photo memory.
-No, thanks.

250
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,360
See, a beautiful shot.

251
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,530
And it's all digital.

252
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,760
Which means I can email it to you.

253
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,630
I--I think I have something in my teeth.

254
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,460
Oh, well, let me take another.

255
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,800
No, no, really, that's okay.

256
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,030
Hey, I said that's okay.

257
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,800
Look, man, why don't I, uh--

258
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,030
Why don't I just give you five bucks,

259
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,200
and you'll delete it.

260
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,230
Can you do that?

261
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,330
Gracias, joven.

262
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,300
The young boy and mother

263
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,200
who stayed in Vivian's cabana.

264
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,960
Thanks a lot.

265
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,560
John Connor.

266
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,360
No se de quien estas hablando.

267
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,900
You're Sarah Connor's son.

268
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,730
I'll be right back.

269
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:45,600
I remember when the Connors left Dejalo.

270
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,360
And I remember the stories that
were told after you were gone.

271
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,060
Man, you really--

272
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,600
you really mixed me up with somebody else.

273
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,060
I'm just--

274
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,700
These are pictures you wouldn't
want the authorities to see.

275
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,400
-How much?
-Everything you've got.

276
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,900
Hey, back off, man.

277
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
We gotta get out of here, now.

278
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,530
-Run!
-No!

279
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,300
No se puede salir sin pagar!

280
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,460
Puedo pagar la camara.

281
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,700
Stick to English, kid.

282
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,000
The American accent is killing me.

283
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,700
This is a misunderstanding, that's all.

284
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,460
I'll pay for the camera, okay?

285
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,560
What the hell were you doing down here anyway?

286
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,900
We're just tourists.

287
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,030
Cancun's not good for you?

288
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,760
This is the guy?

289
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,960
Yes, sir.

290
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,100
I was about to take his statement.

291
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,160
A man took a picture of me and my girlfriend,

292
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,530
and he wanted us to buy it.

293
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,830
It was crowded, someone bumped into him,

294
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:01,130
he dropped his camera.

295
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,330
I was afraid a fight was going to start,

296
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,430
so we tried to leave, that's all.

297
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,400
-How old are you?
-16.

298
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,900
-You were drinking?
-No.

299
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,000
You have parents.

300
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,230
My mother and an uncle.

301
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,860
They know where you are?

302
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,460
No.

303
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,900
I'll make you a deal.

304
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,860
If they come pick you up,
I'll let you go with a warning.

305
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,600
Leave a message.

306
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,330
What the hell was that?

307
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,300
It's my uncle's voice mail.

308
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,060
Call your mother.

309
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,800
Hello?

310
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,260
John, thank god. Where are you?

311
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,330
I've been going out of my mind.

312
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,830
Did you get through?

313
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,860
John, are you there? Are you in trouble?

314
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,960
She didn't answer.

315
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Put him in holding.

316
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,730
In a few hours, give him another phone call.

317
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:23,430
And run his name through Interpol.

318
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,960
Yes, sir.

319
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,630
So which name should I run?

320
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,400
The one on your passport?

321
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,060
Or the real one?

322
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,060
Sir, sir, hello?

323
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:05,060
Hi, can you come here, please?

324
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,530
Hi, I need your help, please.

325
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,730
This guy in here is a complete psycho.

326
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,160
He's been trying to make moves on me.

327
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,600
You two came in together.

328
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,830
Sir, do you have children?
Do you have a daughter?

329
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,430
My dad told me to stay away from this guy,

330
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,800
and he was totally right.

331
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,760
This guy's a complete freak.

332
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,730
And I don't even care how much trouble I'm in.

333
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,100
All I want to do is call home

334
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,260
And tell them where I am.

335
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,930
Please?

336
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,660
Take a step back.

337
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,000
-I'm going to open the door.
-Thank you.

338
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,960
Lo siento, senor. Lo siento.

339
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,830
Riley, you need to listen to me.

340
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,200
No matter what happens,
if you see daylight, you run.

341
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,130
Okay, don't wait for me. Just run.

342
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,160
What? What are you do--

343
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,160
If you see daylight, you run.

344
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,100
Your strategy has changed from last time.

345
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,460
Has it?

346
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,230
The first time we met,
you tried to kill yourself.

347
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,930
You're right.

348
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,160
This time I'm going to kill you.

349
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,560
She hasn't been careful.

350
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
She's made mistakes.

351
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,230
Not as many as you, but enough.

352
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,360
Does she have damage to her chip?

353
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,600
She has damage to her chip.

354
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,400
How did you find the house?

355
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,200
The boy told me.

356
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,200
The one from the bowling alley.

357
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,930
You should have killed him.

358
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,500
Just like you should have killed yourself.

359
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,730
I'm not a murderer.

360
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,500
Who is?

361
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,460
Hello?

362
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,530
Sarah Connor? James Ellison.

363
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,900
I need you to come with me.

364
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:30,530
James Ellison.

365
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:38,330
Agent Crossman, how you doing?

366
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,700
It's good to hear from you.

367
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,800
What's on your mind?

368
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,700
Mexico.

369
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,660
You don't say.

370
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:55,630
I suppose

371
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,830
that they don't have anyone looking into it

372
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,830
over at the bureau.

373
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,700
I know.

374
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,900
Connor's case has been cold since '99.

375
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,100
I was just curious.

376
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,930
Sure, email it over and I'll take a look.

377
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,660
Hold on.

378
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,200
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

379
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,730
It does look a little bit like him.

380
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,430
John Connor.

381
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:32,960
God rest his soul.

382
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,760
You're with the American FBI?

383
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,360
Yes, that's right.

384
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,600
You have a boy in your custody.

385
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,100
His arrest report lists an alias of John Connor,

386
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,960
which matches a fugitive of mine.

387
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,630
The domestic terrorism case.

388
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,530
You're familiar with the Connors?

389
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,200
It was flagged during processing.

390
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,430
But we dismissed it as a coincidence.

391
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:01,230
Your fugitive would be 24 years old by now,

392
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:03,100
if he was not already dead.

393
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,530
Look,

394
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:09,560
I'd be grateful for just a visual identification

395
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,230
to help bring me some closure.

396
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,300
You have traveled an awful long way for closure.

397
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,130
If he is who I think he is,

398
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,230
then I have reason to believe
that your prison is in danger.

399
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:27,230
And yes,

400
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,960
I've come a long way.

401
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:38,954
Excuse me.

402
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,260
I'm looking for John Connor.

403
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,660
Daylight, run!

404
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,500
John! I'm here to help you.

405
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Oh, my god!

406
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,830
Oh, my god!

407
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,000
The car, Riley!

408
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,160
Riley, get in the car, now!

409
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Now! Get in!

410
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,360
-You okay?
-Yeah.

411
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,700
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

412
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,300
Are there any rounds in this thing?

413
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,700
Look for ammunition. Look for more ammunition.

414
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,800
We need more!

415
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,330
What, are you okay?

416
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,360
I just felt something back here!

417
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,460
Stop the car. Stop the car.

418
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,230
Sarah Connor. James Ellison.

419
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,230
I need you to come with me.

420
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,630
Mom.

421
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,230
We need to move.

422
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,850
It's a clear shot all the way of the alley

423
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,900
back to the jail.

424
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,830
No, that's where it will be waiting.

425
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:22,030
Let me do that.

426
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,460
I need to be able to use it.

427
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,200
I should hope so.

428
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,330
Why are you here?

429
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,330
John was flagged in the FBI computer.

430
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,460
Couldn't you just have buried it?

431
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,430
It's been watching me.

432
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,700
It?

433
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,960
Out there.

434
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,660
It.

435
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,660
And you still came to Mexico?

436
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,530
You could have led it right to John.

437
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,860
It wasn't me in the trunk.

438
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,360
So what were you going to do,

439
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,630
just pop him out of jail?

440
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,960
Set him free, no questions asked?

441
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,360
Yes, actually.

442
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,000
That's exactly what I was going to do.

443
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,130
Hm, I have a hard time believing that.

444
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,660
I owed you one.

445
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,500
The fire. Silberman's cabin?

446
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,060
Wasn't much.

447
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,160
It was my life.

448
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:25,230
How you feel about that now?

449
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,030
You have to go.

450
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,600
I promise I'll call you as soon
as we get back to L.A.

451
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,800
But you have to go.

452
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,860
John. Riley, don't.

453
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,360
Go home.

454
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,030
I swear I'll explain everything
when we get there.

455
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,630
Go out the back.

456
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,630
Run due east. There's a bus route.

457
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,800
You know what else there is?

458
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,660
A man with a gun who's killing people.

459
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,030
He won't follow you if you run away from me.

460
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:04,260
I don't wanna run away from you.

461
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,660
Get her out of here.

462
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:19,660
I need your phone.

463
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,800
Have a plan?

464
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,030
I've got a weapon.

465
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,360
Cameron.

466
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,900
The girl from the bank vault?

467
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
John and I are in trouble.
I need you and Cameron.

468
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,700
John's with you? Well, we're here already.

469
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,730
-We're at the jail.
-What?

470
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,460
Cromartie's here.

471
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,760
Then we should stay undercover.

472
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,400
I'm looking for John Baum. Where is he?

473
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,960
Yo no se.

474
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,160
We gotta get out of here.

475
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
We gotta find John.

476
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,960
We're no good to him dead.

477
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,660
I can't let anything happen to him.

478
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,830
Escaped or dead?

479
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,860
Escaped!

480
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,430
A little help, por favor?

481
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,160
Don't worry, it won't be back.

482
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,700
Senor!

483
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,260
Please!

484
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,260
John and I are in trouble.
I need you and Cameron.

485
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,630
John's with you?

486
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,230
Well, we're here already. We're at the jail.

487
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,500
What?

488
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,300
Wait, wait, wait, Sarah.

489
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,200
Then where the hell's Cromartie?

490
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,960
I am sorry, senor,

491
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,260
but I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

492
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,130
I'm gonna need to see John Connor.

493
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,360
Help. Help me!

494
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Ayudame!

495
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,200
I'm looking for John Connor.

496
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,700
He's gone.

497
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,000
Are there any other exits?

498
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,730
No.

499
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:31,100
Have you come to repent?

500
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,300
I'm looking for John Connor.

501
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,930
All things are possible

502
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,530
to him who believes.

503
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,630
We'll attract less attention if
we don't travel together.

504
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,860
You want me to leave?

505
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,760
What's next?

506
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,260
We'll come back down here.

507
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:44,730
And bring something with us to destroy it.

508
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,100
His name's gonna be on an alert.

509
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,230
He's got other names.

510
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,960
Then what?

511
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,830
There is no "then what."

512
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,960
Pretend I died again.

513
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,630
I lost a lot when you died the first time.

514
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:06,400
My marriage, my career.

515
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,360
That's a lot to you?

516
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,700
I suppose many people lost those things.

517
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,360
You want answers.

518
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,960
I just want to know my role

519
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,100
in all of this.

520
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,630
What happens after this?

521
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,430
This is it.

522
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,600
There's nothing else behind the curtain.

523
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,360
This is what I do. It's all I do.

524
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,800
You already know why I do it.

525
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,800
I'm sorry for what you lost.

526
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,330
But I can't help you get any of it back.

527
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,230
Can I have the chip?
