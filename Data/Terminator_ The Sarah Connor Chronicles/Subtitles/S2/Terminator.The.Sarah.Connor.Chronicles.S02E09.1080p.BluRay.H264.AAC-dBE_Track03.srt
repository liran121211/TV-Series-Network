It's up to us now.

525
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,589
The two of us.

526
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,341
Yes.

527
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,844
It is.

528
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,798
What am I doing here?

529
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:33,967
I don't know.

530
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:36,261
It's a waste of time.
You just lie and lie.

531
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,973
It's a waste of time. I just lie and lie.

532
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:43,685
- Don't you have things to do?
- Yes. I do. I have things to do.

533
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,982
I should get back to work.
