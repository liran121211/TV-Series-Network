http://Projet-SG.net

16
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,145
Earth to Cameron.

17
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:57,911
What?

18
00:01:59,554 --> 00:02:00,725
Are you okay?

19
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,169
'Cause if you're gonna try and kill me
again, I wouldn't mind a head start.

20
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,876
If I was going to try
to kill you again,

21
00:02:06,996 --> 00:02:09,229
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

22
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:11,771
Fair enough. Listen, I'm gonna go
get some stuff from Radio World.

23
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:13,344
I'll meet you in a half hour.

24
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,215
30 minutes, I swear.

25
00:02:28,012 --> 00:02:30,147
Get me some of those cheese things,
all right?

26
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:32,663
The crunchy ones,
not the puffy ones.

27
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:06,439
I'm sorry to bother you. It's just...
I'm having these weird pains.

28
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:07,732
What kind of pains?

29
00:03:07,892 --> 00:03:10,423
Just like a spicy taco
kind of pain,

30
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:12,987
but I haven't eaten
any spicy tacos.

31
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:15,114
And I'm bleeding!

32
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:18,826
We need to take you
to the hospital.

33
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:20,391
Thanks.

34
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:17,468
Miss?

35
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,388
Are you all right?

36
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,137
Someone get the manager.

37
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,482
You been drinkin'?

38
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:32,752
Taking drugs?

39
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:36,237
You got a wallet
or some kind of ID on you?

40
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,389
What's your name?

41
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:51,409
My name?

42
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:54,422
Why should I tell you?

43
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,675
If you don't, we'll give you one.

44
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,937
Go ahead.
I'm dying to hear it.

45
00:05:11,427 --> 00:05:12,528
Alison!

46
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,317
Alison Young!

47
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,245
So, what are you in for?

48
00:05:29,718 --> 00:05:31,219
I was in a store...

49
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:34,714
and I couldn't remember anything.

50
00:05:36,847 --> 00:05:39,268
Blackouts.
Been there, done that.

51
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:50,645
- Can tattoos disappear?
- Sure.

52
00:05:51,137 --> 00:05:53,230
Got two of my ex's lasered off.

53
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:56,630
Ryan was... right here.

54
00:05:57,234 --> 00:06:00,321
And Jose... was here.

55
00:06:01,931 --> 00:06:04,575
- Next time I'm thinking henna.
- Henna?

56
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,822
- I'm Jody.
- I'm...

57
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,306
Placenta's still attached.

58
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,643
There's no previa.

59
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:32,979
No evidence of major abruption.

60
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:35,496
So everything's fine.

61
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:38,651
I wanna run a Kleihauer-Betke
to rule out fetal blood cells.

62
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:39,902
What does that mean?

63
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,321
We wanna make sure
the blood is yours and not the baby's.

64
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:43,781
What if it is the baby's?

65
00:06:44,342 --> 00:06:46,993
Then we do an emergency C-section.

66
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:49,996
But let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

67
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:54,335
That didn't sound good.

68
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:56,237
No, it didn't.

69
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:58,629
Hey, look,
I know you're busy, so...

70
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:00,547
if you need to go...

71
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:04,511
- Can I call someone?
- You mean like the father?

72
00:07:07,936 --> 00:07:10,248
I'll be fine. Go.

73
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:27,391
What happened here?

74
00:07:27,818 --> 00:07:29,818
Some girl totally wigged out.

75
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:33,333
What do you mean, wigged out?

76
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,160
She's on drugs or something.

77
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,335
She couldn't even remember
her own name.

78
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:39,091
What'd she look like?

79
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,756
Wanna guess like 16, 17,

80
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,877
- brown hair, maybe like 5'8"...
- Where is she now?

81
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,199
Cops took her.

82
00:07:56,849 --> 00:07:58,481
Store owner's not pressing charges.

83
00:07:58,915 --> 00:08:02,693
I don't wanna see you back here.
And you... I'm sick of you.

84
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,957
This is your last
get out of jail free.

85
00:08:17,785 --> 00:08:19,903
- Where you headed?
- I don't know.

86
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:21,674
- Good.
- Why good?

87
00:08:22,373 --> 00:08:23,798
'Cause you're comin' with me.

88
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,645
I'm looking for my sister.

89
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:40,506
She was picked up
at the food mart on Van Nuys.

90
00:08:40,626 --> 00:08:41,925
Yeah, that one.

91
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:44,318
We released her about an hour ago.

92
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:47,238
Did she say where she was going?

93
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,616
I'm sorry,
but I really need to find her, okay?

94
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:53,917
She's on medication.
My mom's gonna kill me.

95
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,914
She might kill her, actually.

96
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:00,376
She left with one of the street kids,
Jody.

97
00:09:00,536 --> 00:09:02,128
Do you know
where Jody hangs out?

98
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,910
Usually gets popped
along the boulevard.

99
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:07,287
All right, thanks.

100
00:09:12,071 --> 00:09:13,679
It's a boy, you know.

101
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,418
Boy's good.

102
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:19,182
I hate being trapped in bed...

103
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:22,064
feeling like
there's nothing I can do.

104
00:09:22,516 --> 00:09:24,792
If you can't protect them
when they're still inside you,

105
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,011
how can you ever protect them?

106
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,489
What was yours like?

107
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,271
When John was born.

108
00:09:34,601 --> 00:09:38,179
I was living in Central America
at the time.

109
00:09:39,318 --> 00:09:42,324
We were hiking in the jungle
when my water broke.

110
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:45,338
Tried to get to the nearest town,
but there wasn't time.

111
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:48,466
- Did you have anything for the pain?
- Bottle of dark rum.

112
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,302
And John's father?

113
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,198
He was right there with me.

114
00:09:58,172 --> 00:10:00,775
I remember holding his hand
really tight.

115
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:04,941
Gosh, how did you
finally get out of there?

116
00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:07,127
Hitched a ride on a chicken bus.

117
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,623
Tobacco farmer handed out cigars.

118
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:13,741
We smoked and then sang
this birthday song.

119
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:15,700
Oh, sing a little bit for me.

120
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,637
My spanish is rusty

121
00:10:17,757 --> 00:10:19,664
and I've never been able to sing.

122
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:21,534
So?

123
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:33,373
I heard you were here.

124
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,083
I was worried.

125
00:10:35,684 --> 00:10:39,016
- Is everything...
- We're waiting on some test results.

126
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,945
- I'm Trevor.
- Sarah.

127
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:43,825
I should go.

128
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:50,194
Unless you need something else.

129
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:51,907
Maybe some magazines?

130
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:58,035
You know Jody?
A girl named Jody?

131
00:10:58,196 --> 00:11:00,609
Hey, you know a girl named Jody?

132
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,557
You know a Jody?
You know Jody?

133
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,479
Hey, do you know a girl named Jody?

134
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,659
Hey, you know someone named Jody?

135
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,198
- Just checking in. What are you doing?
- Nothing. Cameron and I are shopping.

136
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,783
- What are you doing?
- I took Kacy to the hospital.

137
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,074
Is she okay?

138
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:51,201
<i>They're running a few tests.
I'm gonna be a while.</i>

139
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:53,071
- How long?
- I don't know. Why?

140
00:11:54,543 --> 00:11:55,760
Delicious!

141
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:58,346
- Who was that?
- Nobody. I gotta go.

142
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,607
Thank you for taking the time
to see me.

143
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:08,870
I understand your reluctance
to discuss these things over the phone.

144
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:12,518
But I'm pleased you're still
considering my job offer.

145
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:15,294
I am. Thank you.

146
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:19,492
I appreciate a man who's calm
and careful in his decision making.

147
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,434
The last time I went hunting
for these things you want me to hunt,

148
00:12:23,554 --> 00:12:25,017
20 other people died.

149
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,748
I won't let that happen again.

150
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,263
Nor should you.

151
00:12:28,383 --> 00:12:29,376
These things...

152
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:31,497
They're evil.

153
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,923
We have to be careful, Agent,
not to anthropomorphize a machine.

154
00:12:35,085 --> 00:12:37,498
These are more
than machines, Miss Weaver.

155
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,554
But I'll never make the mistake
of thinking they're human.

156
00:12:40,819 --> 00:12:44,580
Two years ago, my husband and I were
in a helicopter accident.

157
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,629
- He was killed.
- I'm sorry.

158
00:12:47,749 --> 00:12:49,199
He was flying us to Barstow.

159
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:51,982
There was a microchip plant there
doing some amazing things.

160
00:12:52,143 --> 00:12:53,544
So your husband was a pilot.

161
00:12:53,664 --> 00:12:56,862
He had over 700 hours
on that particular helicopter.

162
00:12:57,231 --> 00:12:58,619
It was his passion.

163
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:04,271
This is difficult for you.

164
00:13:04,391 --> 00:13:07,600
The Kulishov A-85
is a beautiful flying machine.

165
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,251
Like the most perfect bird.

166
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:12,516
It's almost flawless in its design.

167
00:13:12,636 --> 00:13:13,963
Almost flawless?

168
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:17,216
It needs a human to fly it.

169
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:18,888
Are you saying that...

170
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,679
machines make better decisions
than humans?

171
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,211
What I think...

172
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:27,041
is that in certain
extreme conditions,

173
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:30,163
even the most calm
and careful of men

174
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:31,647
panic.

175
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:35,818
Help me find this machine, Agent.

176
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:38,611
You and I'll take it apart
piece by piece.

177
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:40,489
I'm not sure what we'll find,

178
00:13:41,257 --> 00:13:42,700
but I doubt we'll find evil.

179
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:15,024
So much food.

180
00:14:15,878 --> 00:14:17,902
I know.
We're totally puking later.

181
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,672
But whatever.

182
00:14:20,012 --> 00:14:21,281
It's an occasion.

183
00:14:22,358 --> 00:14:25,138
- I like your necklace.
- It's cool, huh?

184
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:27,578
I got it from this awesome
thrift store in Echo Park.

185
00:14:29,649 --> 00:14:30,395
So...

186
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:34,084
Two years ago,
when I moved here from Michigan,

187
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:37,338
I had this internship
at a storefront in Chinatown.

188
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,924
The designer was this total druggie.

189
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,825
And when I finally called him out
on what stuck up

190
00:14:42,945 --> 00:14:44,823
and talentless bitch he was,

191
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:49,141
I got fired from my unpaid job.

192
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,697
That's when I started
crashing with people

193
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:55,481
and doing, you know,
whatever... for money...

194
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:58,533
Which got sketchy real quick.

195
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,360
Especially in LA.

196
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:02,413
The city is like a freak magnet.

197
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,121
You'd look really pretty in this.

198
00:15:09,014 --> 00:15:11,197
- We should bounce.
- How much you get for it, bitch?

199
00:15:11,317 --> 00:15:13,968
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- My laptop, with all the stuff?

200
00:15:14,088 --> 00:15:17,325
- I didn't take your laptop, dude.
- It just disappeared the day you left.

201
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:19,767
Okay, look...

202
00:15:24,547 --> 00:15:27,400
Who are you, huh?
You a little thief too?

203
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:32,677
Just take it.
Go!

204
00:15:34,444 --> 00:15:35,604
Please just go!

205
00:15:36,724 --> 00:15:39,348
The next time I see you,
you better have me something.

206
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:54,309
All I'm saying is sometimes
you gotta take a punch once in a while

207
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,877
in order to keep the cash...
That was a lot of cash.

208
00:15:58,387 --> 00:15:59,529
I'm sorry.

209
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,847
Fill it out so we can crash here
for a couple of nights.

210
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:12,102
- I don't know what to write.
- Doesn't matter. Lie.

211
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:22,668
The other catch is you have to have
this interview with a counselor.

212
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:26,362
Just BS your way through it.
Don't tell them anything real.

213
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,409
Nice.

214
00:16:32,589 --> 00:16:34,079
Where'd you learn how to do that?

215
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,498
I don't know.

216
00:16:37,994 --> 00:16:39,382
You weren't, like...

217
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:41,462
getting beaten up
or anything, were you?

218
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:47,091
Sorry about that thing
I said earlier about taking a punch.

219
00:16:47,393 --> 00:16:50,341
If you've gotten your fill,
I shouldn't have said it.

220
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:51,663
But don't worry.

221
00:16:52,329 --> 00:16:53,515
From now on...

222
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,018
I got your back.

223
00:17:10,651 --> 00:17:12,510
Wasn't easy getting that shot.

224
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:15,033
Where was it?

225
00:17:15,406 --> 00:17:16,403
Tanzania.

226
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:19,249
Paul and I just got back
a couple weeks ago.

227
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,820
But you didn't come here
to talk about zebras.

228
00:17:27,476 --> 00:17:31,136
I was hoping you could run a check
on someone for me... Off the record.

229
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:32,221
Who is it?

230
00:17:32,962 --> 00:17:35,977
Catherine Weaver.
Zeira Corp.

231
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:40,312
- What's your interest in her?
- Actually, she's interested in me.

232
00:17:43,617 --> 00:17:44,775
She offered me a job.

233
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:48,821
- You're leaving the bureau?
- It's just an offer, Lila.

234
00:17:50,864 --> 00:17:52,491
You're not wearing your cross.

235
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:53,867
How do you know?

236
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,161
The way you're carrying yourself.

237
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:00,151
What happened in North Hollywood...

238
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,334
That wasn't your fault.

239
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:06,807
Agent Ellison?

240
00:18:08,292 --> 00:18:10,007
Got those updated 302s for you.

241
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:11,370
Thank you, Liz.

242
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,055
Glad you kept the name.

243
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:18,308
It's a good name.

244
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:30,988
<i>Where are you from, Alison?</i>

245
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:35,117
I don't remember.

246
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:37,552
Where are you from,
Alison?

247
00:18:39,597 --> 00:18:40,957
I don't remember...

248
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,781
You don't remember
what town you're from?

249
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:44,267
Why does it matter?

250
00:18:45,514 --> 00:18:47,096
It's not there anymore.

251
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,744
You know, sometimes
when people forget,

252
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,278
it's because they need to forget...

253
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,378
because something
painful has happened.

254
00:18:57,376 --> 00:18:59,253
I'm wondering if something
has happened to you.

255
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:02,986
<i>Tell me about your life.</i>

256
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,483
I live in a tunnel.

257
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:09,653
I eat garbage for dinner.

258
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,437
Anything you say in here
is confidential.

259
00:19:12,557 --> 00:19:15,938
The only exception is
if you were planning to harm someone...

260
00:19:16,058 --> 00:19:18,671
- I would have to report that.
- I would never hurt anyone.

261
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:21,531
<i>Tell me about your family.</i>

262
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:24,666
Memory is a very associative thing.

263
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,505
Sometimes sights,

264
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,956
sounds,

265
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:31,882
even a smell can take us back.

266
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:37,053
My father was an architect.

267
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,397
He taught me how to draw.

268
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:45,771
My mother was a music teacher.

269
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:50,633
She'd sit for hours
and listen to Chopin.

270
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,471
<i>What's that bracelet on your arm?</i>

271
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:00,577
My sister gave it to me
for my birthday.

272
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:03,932
July 22nd...

273
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:08,377
I had a party in Griffith Park.

274
00:20:09,236 --> 00:20:10,545
All my friends were there.

275
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,587
I saw a boy ride by
on his silver mountain bike,

276
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:19,997
and I told my dad...

277
00:20:21,396 --> 00:20:22,724
That's what I want.

278
00:20:25,455 --> 00:20:27,292
And he said next year.

279
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:35,894
But I didn't have a party
the next year. No one did.

280
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:37,477
<i>Why not?</i>

281
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:42,533
Everyone was dead.

282
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:01,239
Why not?

283
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:14,735
It's a Balinese tiger.

284
00:21:17,248 --> 00:21:18,655
Have you ever seen a real one?

285
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:22,618
Unfortately, they were hunted
to extinction in the '30s.

286
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:27,304
Do you ever think
that could happen to us?

287
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,455
To humans?

288
00:21:36,002 --> 00:21:38,028
Is that something you worry about?

289
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:42,243
I wanna go home.

290
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,560
<i>Where is home?</i>

291
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,730
Palmdale.

292
00:21:54,144 --> 00:21:56,401
- Palmdale?
- That's where I'm from.

293
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:07,897
Hey, do you know a Jody,
by any chance?

294
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:10,284
Jody?
Do you know a Jody?

295
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:12,709
- Anybody here know a Jody?
- Yeah, yeah, I know her.

296
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:14,503
She was here with some other chick.

297
00:22:14,664 --> 00:22:16,046
Do you know where she went?

298
00:22:16,206 --> 00:22:18,772
But she hangs out at this halfway house
sometimes on Yucca.

299
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:20,289
Yucca. Thanks.

300
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:24,137
Hungry?

301
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,431
Split my jell-o with you.

302
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:27,991
Where's Trevor?

303
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:30,183
He went to go get me some real food.

304
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:34,648
He's the baby daddy.
In case you didn't figure that out.

305
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:37,401
- You never mentioned him.
- We've been on and off.

306
00:22:38,506 --> 00:22:40,439
He freaked when I got pregnant.

307
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:43,272
But... Now he's here.

308
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:44,917
I don't know.

309
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:49,954
Just... I just want life
to be perfect for him,

310
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:51,679
you know?

311
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,917
Didn't you feel that way?

312
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,085
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not an idiot.

313
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:58,586
I know it'll never be perfect.

314
00:22:58,749 --> 00:22:59,706
It's just...

315
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:03,703
Right now... in there...

316
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:07,256
no one's ever made fun of him,

317
00:23:08,142 --> 00:23:09,891
turned him down for a date.

318
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:12,816
How long does he have, really,

319
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:16,069
until he figures out
how hard it can all be?

320
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,308
- Hello?
- Mom?

321
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:28,232
It's me, Alison.

322
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,705
I'm sorry.
You must have the wrong number.

323
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:42,215
- Mrs. Young?
- Yes. This is Claire Young.

324
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:43,883
I'm here with your daughter.

325
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:46,924
There must be some mistake.
I don't have a daughter.

326
00:23:47,351 --> 00:23:48,356
Not yet.

327
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:51,516
Very pretty name, though, Alison.

328
00:24:02,605 --> 00:24:04,692
She didn't even know who I was.

329
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:08,967
Parents suck.
Especially mothers.

330
00:24:11,589 --> 00:24:13,367
Why would she do that to me?

331
00:24:14,075 --> 00:24:16,136
Who knows why anyone does anything?

332
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,753
Come on.

333
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:25,133
Let's go have some fun.

334
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:29,946
Ah, ah. Sit.

335
00:24:30,726 --> 00:24:32,596
Eat. I insist.

336
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:34,511
Thank you.

337
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:41,883
You like tri-tip?
I grill a mean tri-tip.

338
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:43,568
We could do a barbecue.</i>

339
00:24:43,728 --> 00:24:45,513
With you and the kids.

340
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:50,075
- John and... What's the girl's name?
- Cameron.

341
00:24:50,236 --> 00:24:51,761
I can't wait to meet 'em.

342
00:24:52,602 --> 00:24:55,496
If you want, I can take John
to the range with me sometime.

343
00:24:55,663 --> 00:24:58,959
- He's not much of a golfer.
- Me neither. Guns.

344
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,486
Trevor's a cop.

345
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:03,287
Detective.

346
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,624
LAPD.

347
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,408
We got the results.

348
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:11,346
Cells were all maternal.
The baby's fine.

349
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,018
We need to keep you overnight,
but you can go home tomorrow.

350
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:17,164
I knew it.

351
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,229
He's a fighter, this kid.

352
00:25:20,974 --> 00:25:22,107
Just like his mama.

353
00:25:26,163 --> 00:25:27,606
No criminal history.

354
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:29,739
No pending SCC investigations.

355
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:32,159
Nothing from FINCEN.
Her CTRs all check out.

356
00:25:32,604 --> 00:25:35,230
- Not even a civil suit.
- That's good to know.

357
00:25:35,405 --> 00:25:38,043
James, before you make
such a huge change,

358
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,936
don't you think
you should talk to someone?

359
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:43,211
Marshal Weaver's helicopter crash
was due to mechanical failure?

360
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:46,464
You're not listening to me.
I talked to a couple of people.

361
00:25:46,624 --> 00:25:50,112
- It's possible you're suffering from...
- What people?

362
00:25:50,232 --> 00:25:52,796
- Paul?
- He served in the Persian Gulf.

363
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:55,419
He's got experience
with this kind of thing.

364
00:25:55,539 --> 00:25:57,225
I came to you in confidence.

365
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:59,160
I'm worried about you, James.

366
00:25:59,478 --> 00:26:01,563
I've never seen you in so much pain.

367
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:04,774
Yeah, we both know that's not true.

368
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,596
Thank you for the report.

369
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:29,416
Yes!

370
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,384
I'm gonna go get a soda.

371
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,271
- What the hell are you doing?
- Playing foosball.

372
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,941
- We've gotta go.
- Go? Where?

373
00:26:47,166 --> 00:26:48,538
- Home.
- Home?

374
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:50,528
Who are you?

375
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:52,443
Cameron...

376
00:26:53,262 --> 00:26:54,324
My name's Alison.

377
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:56,618
No, it's not. It's Cameron.

378
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:59,913
I can't explain this to you right now.
We have to go before mom gets home.

379
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:02,582
- You're freaking me out.
- I'm freaking you out?

380
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:08,385
- You really not know who you are?
- I'm Alison.

381
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:10,168
From Palmdale.

382
00:27:10,288 --> 00:27:13,195
You're not Alison.
You're not from Palmdale.

383
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:15,998
You're from the future.
You're a machine.

384
00:27:16,698 --> 00:27:17,617
A what?

385
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:19,839
The chip is messed up again,
but I can fix you.

386
00:27:19,959 --> 00:27:22,339
- I fixed you once, remember?
- Fixed me?

387
00:27:23,007 --> 00:27:24,229
Why would you fix me?

388
00:29:13,081 --> 00:29:16,049
- Come on, we have to get out of here.
- What did you do? Did you hurt me?

389
00:29:16,326 --> 00:29:17,384
Is there a problem?

390
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:20,894
No. I'm her brother.
John Baum.

391
00:29:21,014 --> 00:29:22,532
I don't have a brother.

392
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:24,637
Look, dude,
I don't know who you are,

393
00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:26,108
but I really think...

394
00:29:31,283 --> 00:29:32,786
Sir, you need to leave.

395
00:30:02,317 --> 00:30:03,913
You shouldn't have run.

396
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:06,763
You're just making things
worse for yourself.

397
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,241
Your hair.
It's so pretty.

398
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,995
We work very hard on the hair

399
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,606
to get it right.

400
00:30:33,368 --> 00:30:35,752
- I'm not your enemy.
- Right.

401
00:30:35,872 --> 00:30:37,130
I want to get to know you.

402
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:42,844
You're very brave.

403
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:45,553
That must be
why John Connor chose you.

404
00:30:45,673 --> 00:30:47,357
I don't know
what you're talking about.

405
00:30:47,477 --> 00:30:48,558
I admire him,

406
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,518
his determination.

407
00:30:50,769 --> 00:30:53,229
His spirit, his fearlessness.

408
00:30:54,206 --> 00:30:56,899
- I'd like to meet him.
- He wouldn't want to meet you.

409
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:58,949
They're going to kill you.

410
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:00,737
They're going to kill
every one of you.

411
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:04,699
They'll hunt you down
until every human is gone,

412
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:06,503
and you're extinct.

413
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:08,872
Then...

414
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:12,790
Why are we having this conversation?

415
00:31:13,411 --> 00:31:15,476
Because some of us don't want that.

416
00:31:16,362 --> 00:31:17,879
Some of us want peace.

417
00:31:20,124 --> 00:31:23,517
You were chosen, Alison,
not just by John Connor,

418
00:31:24,406 --> 00:31:25,231
by us.

419
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:29,516
Tell me where his camp is.

420
00:31:34,452 --> 00:31:35,581
I think...

421
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:37,865
I'm a machine.

422
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:39,268
A machine.

423
00:31:40,142 --> 00:31:41,611
What kind of machine?

424
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,561
From the future.

425
00:31:43,956 --> 00:31:45,817
What do you do in the future?

426
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:48,069
I'm an infiltrator.

427
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:49,826
What do you infiltrate?

428
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:51,941
The human resistance.

429
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:53,292
I see.

430
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:55,048
Why?

431
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,380
- It's what I was programmed for.
- Programmed.

432
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,756
To find John Connor.

433
00:32:05,155 --> 00:32:06,614
Why's he so important?

434
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:08,763
He's the one who saves mankind.

435
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,168
Saves them. From... What?

436
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:12,642
Extinction.

437
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,877
And what are you gonna do
when you find John Connor?

438
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:19,085
I'm going to kill him

439
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:21,734
and hang his head on a pike
for all to see.

440
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:47,455
Your hair.

441
00:32:48,047 --> 00:32:49,020
It's so pretty.

442
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:50,847
Thanks.

443
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:53,072
Tell me about your life.

444
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,771
Why?

445
00:32:56,395 --> 00:32:57,812
I want to get to know you.

446
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:00,449
I don't really like
talking about my past.

447
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:02,400
I came to LA to start over.

448
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:05,204
Did you?

449
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,759
Yeah. Burned a lot
of bridges here, though.

450
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:14,343
Keep thinking I'm gonna go someplace
more authentic, you know, like Portland.

451
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:17,382
I could come with you.

452
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,627
We could reinvent ourselves.

453
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,330
We could.

454
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:27,244
So... Who are you, really?

455
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:30,928
I've never heard of you.
Suddenly you're Kacy's best friend.

456
00:33:31,393 --> 00:33:32,786
I'm just a neighbor.

457
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:35,425
Sorry. Cop brain.

458
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:40,188
Stresses her, you know.

459
00:33:40,645 --> 00:33:41,525
My job.

460
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:46,800
You'd think having a cop around
would make her feel safe.

461
00:33:47,582 --> 00:33:49,455
She's afraid
it'll follow me back home.

462
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:50,517
Does it?

463
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:52,542
I can protect her.

464
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:55,703
It's your family, right?
You do what it takes.

465
00:33:57,824 --> 00:33:58,646
Sorry.

466
00:34:00,153 --> 00:34:00,976
Yeah.

467
00:34:02,263 --> 00:34:03,044
Right.

468
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,757
There was a robbery/homicide downtown.
I'm gonna have to take off.

469
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:10,593
What about tomorrow?
She's gonna need a ride.

470
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:11,879
I'll be here.

471
00:34:12,391 --> 00:34:15,306
I just... I hate for her
to spend the night alone.

472
00:34:40,392 --> 00:34:42,698
Agent Ellison.
Come in.

473
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:46,921
This is my daughter Savannah.

474
00:34:50,483 --> 00:34:51,461
Sudoku.

475
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,267
I used to love these.

476
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,388
You have children, Agent Ellison?

477
00:34:58,016 --> 00:34:58,716
No.

478
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:02,371
- Do you want them?
- I did... once.

479
00:35:03,497 --> 00:35:04,579
Very much.

480
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:09,446
But my wife...
Well, my ex-wife...

481
00:35:11,807 --> 00:35:12,874
wasn't meant to be.

482
00:35:18,374 --> 00:35:19,554
Bye, Savannah.

483
00:35:32,392 --> 00:35:34,317
Your husband's helicopter crash.

484
00:35:35,783 --> 00:35:37,599
I read the official report.

485
00:35:38,464 --> 00:35:40,280
The NTSB concluded

486
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:42,560
that mechanical failure
was to blame.

487
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,563
Mechanical failure.
Correct.

488
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:48,417
That's not what you led me
to believe the other day.

489
00:35:49,456 --> 00:35:50,485
Correct.

490
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:52,195
Which is it?

491
00:35:52,977 --> 00:35:54,298
What's the truth?

492
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:55,907
You tell me.

493
00:35:58,733 --> 00:35:59,845
I think...

494
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,851
what people write in reports...

495
00:36:04,872 --> 00:36:07,627
when it's official
isn't always true.

496
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:11,607
I think if I had a child,

497
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:16,359
one that I knew would grow up asking
what happened to her daddy...

498
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:20,278
I think I would make sure
that answer,

499
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,273
the official answer,

500
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:26,769
was the one
I would want her to hear.

501
00:36:28,914 --> 00:36:30,525
I think you saw what you saw.

502
00:36:31,399 --> 00:36:33,277
Just as you saw what you saw.

503
00:36:36,731 --> 00:36:37,989
When can I start?

504
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,421
I used to babysit for this family
five years ago.

505
00:36:58,541 --> 00:36:59,894
They were loaded.

506
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:03,666
You said you moved here
two years ago from Michigan.

507
00:37:04,036 --> 00:37:07,097
They usually hide a key
here somewhere.

508
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,994
Sweet! You are jacked, girl.

509
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,919
Look for cash and jewelry.

510
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,604
Check this out.

511
00:37:24,234 --> 00:37:25,651
Saw the lady open it.

512
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:27,165
And I memorized...

513
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,450
the combination.

514
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,112
Just put it all in the bag.

515
00:37:38,044 --> 00:37:39,211
What are these?

516
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:42,441
Whatever. Just put 'em back.

517
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:45,090
They're the same
as the necklace you gave me.

518
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:47,824
Because I stole it
when I worked here.

519
00:37:49,416 --> 00:37:53,636
You said, "I got it at this awesome
thrift store in Echo Park."

520
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:58,654
Tell me about the necklace.

521
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:02,771
Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

522
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,915
Tell me about the necklace.

523
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:14,786
I didn't buy it or steal it, okay?

524
00:38:15,217 --> 00:38:16,289
It's mine.

525
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:20,259
This is... my parents' house.

526
00:38:23,062 --> 00:38:24,264
You lied to me.

527
00:38:27,293 --> 00:38:28,726
I told you where the camp was.

528
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:31,354
You told me your sister
gave you that bracelet.

529
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,104
What does that
have to do with anything?

530
00:38:39,377 --> 00:38:41,696
We found these
on some of your friends.

531
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:52,492
Why are you all wearing them?

532
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:56,023
It has something to do
with the Connor camp.

533
00:38:56,143 --> 00:38:56,843
No.

534
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:03,886
It's a pass.

535
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:07,379
To get into the camp.

536
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:11,352
You were going to send me without it.
They would have known what I was.

537
00:39:16,279 --> 00:39:17,616
You lied to me.

538
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,660
I'll never help you
get to John Connor.

539
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:34,458
You already did.

540
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:43,884
You lied to me.

541
00:39:44,044 --> 00:39:45,666
I'm from LA, okay?

542
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:47,332
Let's go.

543
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:50,664
Tell me who you are.

544
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,963
I went to Cal Arts for two years,

545
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,644
and I got kicked out,
which was for the best,

546
00:39:56,764 --> 00:39:59,663
because that place is a... factory.

547
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,398
And my parents cut me off
like yours,

548
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:05,717
and just pretend I don't exist.

549
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:09,577
We have to go. Now.

550
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:11,249
Why?

551
00:40:12,393 --> 00:40:14,915
Because there's a silent alarm,
and we tripped it when we walked in.

552
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:17,918
You weren't going to tell me.

553
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:23,529
The police are gonna
be here any second.

554
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:25,616
You were never going to Portland.

555
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:29,107
You were gonna run
and leave me here to take the blame.

556
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:31,291
No.

557
00:40:34,178 --> 00:40:35,454
You lied to me.

558
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:41,311
You lied to me.

559
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,447
I'll never help you
get to John Connor.

560
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:56,999
No, no, no. What did you do?
What did you do?

561
00:40:59,078 --> 00:41:00,908
We have to go.
John.

562
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:03,328
We have to go.

563
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:05,774
Did you kill her?

564
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:09,625
Apparently not.

565
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:24,360
- Where's Trevor?
- He was called into work.

566
00:41:24,821 --> 00:41:26,834
Be back tomorrow to take you home.

567
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:31,329
What's wrong?

568
00:41:32,643 --> 00:41:34,618
It wasn't him that freaked out.

569
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:36,518
It was me.

570
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:40,401
- When I found out I was pregnant.
- Cop thing. He told me.

571
00:41:40,521 --> 00:41:43,082
Yeah. Cop thing.

572
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,583
It's kinda cool and sexy

573
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:49,462
when you're a 25-year-old pastry chef
making gourmet doughnuts

574
00:41:50,254 --> 00:41:52,763
at this hip cop hangout
in Silverlake.

575
00:41:54,408 --> 00:41:56,800
When you think about
breast-feeding your baby boy

576
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,593
next to the walkie
and the.9 millimeter...

577
00:42:03,517 --> 00:42:04,517
Still...

578
00:42:06,142 --> 00:42:07,568
He's a good man.

579
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:10,677
He'll be a good dad.

580
00:42:12,328 --> 00:42:14,419
Kacy, I have to tell you something.

581
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:17,620
That story about John's birth,
it wasn't true.

582
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:21,167
- The jungle?
- No, that part was true.

583
00:42:23,362 --> 00:42:26,528
The part about his father wasn't.
He wasn't there with me.

584
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:31,384
He died before John was born.

585
00:42:31,865 --> 00:42:33,991
Before I even knew I was pregnant.

586
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:37,933
Why did you tell me that story?

587
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,476
'Cause I wished
it's the way it could have been.

588
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,525
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

589
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:51,692
The thing is, I got through it.
All of it.

590
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,283
By myself. And so can you.

591
00:42:57,196 --> 00:42:58,967
Besides, you won't be alone.

592
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:01,607
I'll be right next door.

593
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,554
That was my last
get out of jail free.

594
00:43:17,016 --> 00:43:18,265
Damn right.

595
00:43:25,779 --> 00:43:27,245
Where'd you get that?

596
00:43:29,827 --> 00:43:32,645
I got it at this awesome
thrift store in Echo Park.
