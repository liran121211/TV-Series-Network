It's her son.

He's the one who helped her
blow up the facility.

He's the one we want.

534

We'll give him a few more hours
to show up.

She gave me a few problems.
Nothing I couldn't handle.

Yeah. I guess we don't
need her anymore.

00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:07,548
No. He can trace her cell phone without
her alive. Makes no difference to me.

It's not a problem.
I'll take care of it right now.
