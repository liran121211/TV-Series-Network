1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,635
Previously on Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:02,667 --> 00:00:04,599
Been drinking?

3
00:00:04,634 --> 00:00:06,850
So what are you in for? I'm Jody.

4
00:00:06,885 --> 00:00:09,067
What did you do-- did you hurt me?

5
00:00:09,102 --> 00:00:10,834
Is there a problem?

6
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:12,567
No, I'm her brother,

7
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:13,799
John Baum.

8
00:00:13,834 --> 00:00:15,500
Whatever you say in here is confidential.

9
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:17,634
The only exception is if you were planning

10
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:19,734
to harm someone, I would have to report that.

11
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:24,234
-Jesse.
-Hi, baby.

12
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:25,866
Are you AWOL?

13
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,165
Jess, did you run?

14
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,000
I need a place to rest.

15
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,167
James Ellison?

16
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,566
Why?

17
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,065
Aren't you on the same side?

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,767
Skynet does not believe in you like I do.

19
00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:23,199
Believe?

20
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:24,567
What do you believe?

21
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:30,334
You will lead me to the Connors.

22
00:01:46,701 --> 00:01:48,067
Stay there.

23
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:26,334
There's no one here.

24
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,767
Where the hell are you?

25
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:55,367
Where the hell am I supposed to be?

26
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,934
We just got robbed.

27
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:57,965
You were what?

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,934
Diamonds, cash, credit cards, IDs.

29
00:02:59,969 --> 00:03:01,467
They cleaned us out.

30
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:03,432
Machine?

31
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:05,400
My leather jacket's gone.

32
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,334
So is most of the food.

33
00:03:07,369 --> 00:03:09,933
Human.

34
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:12,634
If those IDs fall into the wrong hands...

35
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:16,899
Listen, head downtown.

36
00:03:16,934 --> 00:03:19,067
I'll call you with an exact
location in half an hour.

37
00:03:24,434 --> 00:03:26,432
Who was that?

38
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:28,566
Real life calling.

39
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,132
You don't always have to answer.

40
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:32,000
I tried it ignoring it all last time around

41
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:35,701
and the whole freaking town blew up.

42
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:36,968
You're a funny man.

43
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,332
Yeah.

44
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,567
Yeah, that's the first thing
people say who know me.

45
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:42,033
Funny Derek.

46
00:03:55,634 --> 00:03:57,200
What's wrong with the system?

47
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:58,499
Why didn't it beep

48
00:03:58,534 --> 00:03:59,968
or do whatever the hell you set it up to do?

49
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:05,432
John.

50
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:07,000
Riley climbed out John's window.

51
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:07,965
The alarm would

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
had to have been turned off for her to do that.

53
00:04:10,035 --> 00:04:12,466
Thanks.

54
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,065
You gave her the code?

55
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,683
We were up late watching TV.

56
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:17,232
She was supposed to reset it.

57
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,783
And somehow your master plan went awry.

58
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:22,300
Mom-- John, our IDs are out there.

59
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,299
Our names, our faces.

60
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:25,965
Fake addresses, fake names.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,466
Nothing can be traced to this house.

62
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:29,850
No? What if the police find who did this?

63
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,976
Where do you think that trail leads to?

64
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:34,067
If our IDs made it into the system

65
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:35,334
linked to this address--

66
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:37,466
Canada.

67
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,167
We should move to Canada.

68
00:04:41,701 --> 00:04:43,132
Saw your door was open.

69
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,834
I thought I'd bring you guys some--

70
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,901
Oh, my god, what happened?

71
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,199
I'll go call Trevor.

72
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:50,033
No, John's been having some trouble

73
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:51,801
with some kids at school.

74
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,232
Seriously? Yeah.

75
00:04:53,267 --> 00:04:56,034
You know how stupid kids can be.

76
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:58,766
Anyway, you'll know soon enough.

77
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,667
We're just on our way to see their parents.

78
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:02,534
All right, well, if you change your mind--

79
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,165
I'll call you.

80
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,501
What am I supposed to do?

81
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:11,534
I'd start with a broom.

82
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,466
Come on, Rita.

83
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,234
Look, I got the county breathing down my neck.

84
00:05:23,269 --> 00:05:24,801
We can't have a backlog like this.

85
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll get it done.

86
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:29,132
Today.

87
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:30,868
I needed it two weeks ago.

88
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:53,332
It's my son.

89
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:55,701
He took off this morning with the neighbor's car

90
00:05:55,736 --> 00:05:56,866
and my credit cards.

91
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,032
We'll call you right away

92
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,567
if he attempts a charge, Miss Baum.

93
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:01,067
Is this a good number to reach you?

94
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:03,432
Yes, thank you.

95
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:05,767
If you knew what was going on with the girl,

96
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:07,133
why didn't you say something?

97
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,399
To you?

98
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,132
To me, to him, to somebody.

99
00:06:10,167 --> 00:06:12,968
I've always made my position
on security very clear.

100
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,434
No one likes a nag.

101
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,900
I'm looking for this girl.

102
00:06:36,935 --> 00:06:39,084
You see these people, sir?

103
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:40,976
These people are real.

104
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:42,799
These are the real people,

105
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,868
and they were all here before you.

106
00:06:44,903 --> 00:06:46,300
I'm her uncle.

107
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,132
And I'm Angelina Jolie.

108
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,200
Get to the back of the line.

109
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:56,434
I know that chick.

110
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,901
So what do you want her for?

111
00:07:03,936 --> 00:07:05,551
She owe you money?

112
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:07,132
I'm her uncle.

113
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,868
You're not her uncle. You're a cop.

114
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:11,033
I'm not a cop.

115
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:13,601
You gonna hurt her?

116
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:16,432
Yes.

117
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:19,267
What about her brother, you gonna hurt him too?

118
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:20,467
Her brother?

119
00:07:20,502 --> 00:07:21,499
Yeah.

120
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:23,167
John Baum or whatever.

121
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:25,001
John Baum?

122
00:07:25,036 --> 00:07:26,801
Another prize.

123
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,367
Is that him?

124
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,334
Yeah, that's him.

125
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:42,100
Let's take a ride.

126
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,265
Who is it?

127
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,267
Los Angeles police department.

128
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:56,833
Hold on.

129
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,200
I'm just trying to catch up

130
00:07:58,235 --> 00:07:59,817
on last night's game.

131
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:01,365
You know who won?

132
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,532
Steelers, Mr. Ellison.

133
00:08:02,567 --> 00:08:03,701
Could you open the door please?

134
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:12,868
Yeah.

135
00:08:15,133 --> 00:08:17,100
You James Ellison?

136
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,599
Yeah.

137
00:08:18,634 --> 00:08:20,334
Mr. Ellison, I'm placing you under arrest

138
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,834
for the murder of Peter Meyers.

139
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,132
What?

140
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:24,667
You have the right to remain silent.

141
00:08:24,702 --> 00:08:26,132
You have the right to an attorney.

142
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,434
If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you.

143
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:29,751
Do you understand these rights

144
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:31,034
as I've read them to you, sir?

145
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:32,465
Yeah, I know my rights.

146
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,501
I just don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

147
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:36,067
Please put your hands against the wall, sir.

148
00:08:36,102 --> 00:08:38,067
Now, Mr. Ellison.

149
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,783
Come on, Moishe, open up.

150
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:55,084
Who are they?

151
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:56,351
New customers.

152
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,915
Everything we do, without exception,

153
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,383
can be seen many ways in the eyes of god,

154
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:04,817
or nature, or whatever you want to call it.

155
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,516
Someone came into your home.

156
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:08,984
Someone took things that were rightfully yours.

157
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,718
The Torah says, "lo tikom ve'lo titor."

158
00:09:11,753 --> 00:09:13,035
No revenge,

159
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,327
no retribution.

160
00:09:14,362 --> 00:09:15,549
On the other hand,

161
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:17,217
it also says, "ayan tachat ayn."

162
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:18,549
An eye for an eye.

163
00:09:18,584 --> 00:09:19,750
And then, of course, we have the story

164
00:09:19,785 --> 00:09:20,848
of the brothers of Nablus--

165
00:09:20,883 --> 00:09:23,050
We came here looking for our diamonds.

166
00:09:23,085 --> 00:09:25,484
Can you help us or not?

167
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,684
I wish I could.

168
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,815
But lately,

169
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,567
business is dry as a bone.

170
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:33,249
I called four other fences.

171
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:35,984
They said you were the busiest
man on the block this week.

172
00:09:37,417 --> 00:09:39,551
Well, nothing you'd be interested in.

173
00:09:39,586 --> 00:09:41,150
Show us.

174
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,150
Okay.

175
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:50,748
These...

176
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:53,567
I bought in the last two days.

177
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:56,351
All from legitimate sources.

178
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:08,949
This one's ours.

179
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:11,317
Young lady, even if those were your diamonds--

180
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:12,583
And they're not--

181
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:14,451
There's no way you could tell
that with the naked eye.

182
00:10:14,486 --> 00:10:16,317
We have machines for that.

183
00:10:16,352 --> 00:10:19,015
So are these.

184
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,748
We don't want any trouble.

185
00:10:20,783 --> 00:10:22,783
Tell us where you got 'em and we're gone.

186
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:24,815
You think I can put a face

187
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,250
to every diamond in this stack?

188
00:10:27,285 --> 00:10:29,651
Just a face from the last 24 hours.

189
00:10:29,686 --> 00:10:31,818
Moishe,

190
00:10:31,853 --> 00:10:34,185
please.

191
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,482
All right.

192
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:38,367
It's so early in the week for trouble.

193
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:40,217
But it's not for you. It's for Jesse.

194
00:10:42,384 --> 00:10:45,850
His name's Ostrowski. Walter Ostrowski.

195
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,282
Where do we find him?

196
00:10:48,317 --> 00:10:50,251
He works out of Toluca Lake,

197
00:10:50,286 --> 00:10:51,382
or so he says.

198
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,000
I just buy the stones.

199
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:54,549
And this Ostrowski,

200
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,517
you're sure he's the guy who sold you these?

201
00:10:56,552 --> 00:10:58,982
I shall not lie.

202
00:10:59,017 --> 00:11:03,251
If you're so into god, what are you doing here?

203
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:05,484
Hashem has a plan for us all.

204
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,750
For me, diamonds.

205
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:21,715
Who's Jesse?

206
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,250
He came back with me.

207
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:24,868
He handled the diamonds.

208
00:11:24,903 --> 00:11:26,451
One of them killed him.

209
00:11:31,384 --> 00:11:33,184
Do you want some gum?

210
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:34,882
No.

211
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,115
You sure?

212
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,950
It's cinnamon.

213
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:43,783
Would it kill you to try and make
a little conversation?

214
00:11:45,817 --> 00:11:47,783
No, it wouldn't kill me.

215
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,482
Funny.

216
00:11:51,517 --> 00:11:53,015
You're funny.

217
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,517
In your own sort of cop way.

218
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:56,684
I'm not a cop.

219
00:11:56,719 --> 00:11:58,451
You're not a cop.

220
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:00,149
You're not an uncle.

221
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:02,351
You're just some guy who wants to kick the crap

222
00:12:02,386 --> 00:12:04,351
out of little miss bitch and her brother.

223
00:12:04,386 --> 00:12:07,517
Just some guy.

224
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,317
But why?

225
00:12:12,117 --> 00:12:13,883
She try to kill you too?

226
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,684
Yes.

227
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:21,484
Well, this is gonna be fun.

228
00:12:24,684 --> 00:12:26,850
I can't believe they stole your food.

229
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:28,484
Freaking amateurs, man.

230
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,616
I know, right?

231
00:12:29,651 --> 00:12:31,451
What do you think they're gonna do

232
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,351
with two-week old maple turkey?

233
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,217
Bet your mom freaked out, huh?

234
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:38,649
Yeah, on me.

235
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,350
On you? Why on you?

236
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,368
The alarm code.

237
00:12:42,403 --> 00:12:44,060
Did I forget?

238
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:45,683
Yeah, you did.

239
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:47,149
I didn't actually see it happen.

240
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:48,718
Like, I wasn't here, but I'm pretty sure this--

241
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,516
Yeah, I'm positive.

242
00:12:50,551 --> 00:12:52,115
This is where they busted her.

243
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,217
I heard the cops talking about it
when they brought her in.

244
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:58,117
You are so buying me these pink and whites,

245
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,217
and that is all there is to it.

246
00:13:00,252 --> 00:13:01,684
Have you seen this girl?

247
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:05,917
I'm looking for this girl.

248
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,382
I'm so sorry, John.

249
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:08,917
I can't believe I did that.

250
00:13:08,952 --> 00:13:10,349
Don't worry about it.

251
00:13:10,384 --> 00:13:12,984
It wouldn't have stopped a break-in.

252
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,549
Might have stopped the picnic, but--

253
00:13:15,584 --> 00:13:18,251
So I know you want to find them and everything,

254
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:20,117
but this is getting a little shady.

255
00:13:20,152 --> 00:13:22,482
Does she hate me now?

256
00:13:22,517 --> 00:13:26,182
Don't sweat it. It's a long list.

257
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:28,417
You're not gonna get what you want this way.

258
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:30,182
You should try being warmer to people.

259
00:13:30,217 --> 00:13:32,417
They might be more open,
you know, to talk to you.

260
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:34,584
I love this stuff.

261
00:13:42,217 --> 00:13:44,217
That's my bad.

262
00:14:02,584 --> 00:14:03,782
That's the guy.

263
00:14:03,817 --> 00:14:05,817
That's definitely the guy.

264
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,784
What am I doing here, detective?

265
00:14:09,819 --> 00:14:11,484
You've been on my side of the table.

266
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,848
You know how this works.

267
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:15,850
I ask a question, you answer it.

268
00:14:15,885 --> 00:14:17,517
Why am I being questioned?

269
00:14:17,552 --> 00:14:18,715
You tell me.

270
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,583
Who's Peter Meyers?

271
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,618
I don't know Peter Meyers.

272
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,418
You killed him.

273
00:14:24,453 --> 00:14:26,184
Killed him?

274
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:27,382
No.

275
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,618
Yes. I've got a witness.

276
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:31,015
Saw the murder.

277
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,718
Recognized you from the news a few weeks ago.

278
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,185
Recognized me?

279
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,583
From the news?

280
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:37,850
The news? 20 of your guys dead...

281
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:39,282
You the sole survivor.

282
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:41,618
By now you're drowning in guilt, I'm guessing.

283
00:14:41,653 --> 00:14:42,949
Throw yourself an anchor.

284
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:45,267
I don't know what you're talking about.

285
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,551
I'm talking about surviving, Mr. Ellison.

286
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,818
I'm talking about the everyday,

287
00:14:49,853 --> 00:14:52,050
walk around pain of surviving

288
00:14:52,085 --> 00:14:53,317
when others have not.

289
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,651
I wanna talk to my lawyer.

290
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:01,818
Okay.

291
00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:04,168
Sure.

292
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,449
Oh.

293
00:15:06,484 --> 00:15:07,982
I meant to ask you.

294
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,817
Why did you steal his clothes?

295
00:15:09,852 --> 00:15:11,382
What?

296
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,748
Meyers' clothes.

297
00:15:12,783 --> 00:15:14,050
You were naked when you killed him.

298
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:16,351
I told you, it wasn't me.

299
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:18,382
Smart.

300
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,617
Your alibi isn't exactly iron-clad, Jim.

301
00:15:20,652 --> 00:15:22,817
Unless, of course, you got a twin brother

302
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,382
I don't know about.

303
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:25,917
You got a twin brother I don't know about?

304
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:46,417
Dr. Ostrowski's in with patients all afternoon.

305
00:15:46,452 --> 00:15:47,551
Would you like to make an appointment?

306
00:15:47,586 --> 00:15:48,850
We'll just take a second.

307
00:15:48,885 --> 00:15:50,950
Excuse me!

308
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,584
Walter Ostrowski?

309
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:58,982
Uh, yes.

310
00:15:59,017 --> 00:16:00,750
I think you have something that belongs to us.

311
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,049
Uh, do I know you?

312
00:16:05,084 --> 00:16:06,550
No, but we have a friend in common,

313
00:16:06,585 --> 00:16:08,017
someone in the diamond district.

314
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,634
Moishe.

315
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,217
Mm-hmm.

316
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:15,867
Um, why don't we, um,

317
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:18,551
talk in my office.

318
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,216
It's...

319
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:23,384
just across the hall.

320
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:50,783
Please, please, don't kill me.

321
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:52,884
-Where's our stuff?
-What stuff?

322
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,950
Passports, IDs, credit cards.

323
00:16:54,985 --> 00:16:56,549
Leather jacket.

324
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:57,817
Everything you stole from our house.

325
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,418
Your house? I don't--

326
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:00,949
Okay, okay, okay.

327
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:03,049
Tell Moishe I'll pay him.

328
00:17:03,084 --> 00:17:04,684
I'll give you the money today.

329
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,284
It's upstairs in my office.

330
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,134
Pay Moishe for what?

331
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:09,950
Everything I owe him.

332
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:12,082
Please.

333
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:14,017
Just don't kill me.

334
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:15,882
-Let him go.
-Why?

335
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,451
He's not the guy who robbed us.

336
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:22,417
And go get Moishe's money.

337
00:17:26,184 --> 00:17:27,815
That's why we're here,

338
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,017
running a collections agency for your fence?

339
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:31,583
Why we're here is because

340
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,084
our security system didn't work.

341
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,616
Why we're here is because

342
00:17:34,651 --> 00:17:36,834
that boy behaves less like John Connor

343
00:17:36,869 --> 00:17:39,017
and more like John Baum every day.

344
00:17:39,052 --> 00:17:41,115
That boy, my son,

345
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,950
has been through more than you'll ever know.

346
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:45,484
Right back at you.

347
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,463
My friends.

348
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,062
Is this what you're looking for?

349
00:17:57,097 --> 00:17:59,297
You do something for me, I do something for you.

350
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:00,614
It's business.

351
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:01,862
This is business.

352
00:18:01,897 --> 00:18:03,913
Please, I just buy the stones.

353
00:18:03,948 --> 00:18:05,895
Who sold you our diamonds?

354
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,830
Okay, okay, his name is Tristan Dewitt.

355
00:18:08,865 --> 00:18:10,130
He lives in Reseda.

356
00:18:10,165 --> 00:18:11,464
Not good enough.

357
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:12,728
It's true. I swear!

358
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:14,997
He's a friend of my cousin's, a punk.

359
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:16,264
That's all I know.

360
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:23,496
You killed Iiko.

361
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,463
Not yet.

362
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:41,663
You're never gonna find them like this.

363
00:18:41,698 --> 00:18:43,663
Do you even know how many people

364
00:18:43,698 --> 00:18:45,129
live in L.A. county?

365
00:18:45,164 --> 00:18:47,262
An employee at the grocery store

366
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:50,713
saw them shopping there on
more than one occasion.

367
00:18:50,748 --> 00:18:54,130
It's highly likely they live
within a one-mile radius.

368
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,964
I'm looking for this girl.

369
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,162
This is stupid.

370
00:19:10,197 --> 00:19:12,463
Just take me back to the halfway house.

371
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:14,962
Did you hear me?

372
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:17,630
I am done hanging out with a creepy stalker.

373
00:19:17,665 --> 00:19:18,962
I don't even know your name.

374
00:19:18,997 --> 00:19:20,331
I just came with you because I wanted

375
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,595
to get back at that bitch.

376
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,496
And I thought you were kind of cute.

377
00:19:23,531 --> 00:19:25,697
But you know what? You're not cute.

378
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,714
You're freakin' silence of the lambs.

379
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,697
This is kidnapping. You know that, right?

380
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:32,795
I could have you arrested.

381
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,997
What are you doing? Why are we stopping?

382
00:19:43,396 --> 00:19:46,264
Freak!

383
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,262
You're blocking the sun.

384
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:15,663
Had an interesting morning
with our friend Moishe.

385
00:20:15,698 --> 00:20:17,129
He's dropping your name

386
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:18,495
pretty freely in front of people

387
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,964
who don't need to be hearing your name.

388
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:22,731
Well, he's your fence.

389
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,463
He likes you better.

390
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,463
I'll have a talk with him.

391
00:20:29,498 --> 00:20:31,797
Help me out, will you?

392
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,697
How long are you planning on keeping this up?

393
00:20:45,732 --> 00:20:46,829
What?

394
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:49,095
You know what, all this.

395
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:51,728
Well, I'm certainly gonna try

396
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:54,264
to get through today without
you spoiling it for me.

397
00:20:56,763 --> 00:20:58,361
The sun sets at 5:47.

398
00:20:58,396 --> 00:21:00,563
I'm not missing that sucker.

399
00:21:07,763 --> 00:21:09,797
I'm not missing one of those again.

400
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:23,114
I'm looking for this girl.

401
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,164
Why are you looking for her?

402
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,630
Has she done something?

403
00:21:26,665 --> 00:21:28,097
She's my niece.

404
00:21:30,864 --> 00:21:33,864
You--you look really familiar.

405
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:37,762
Common face.

406
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,463
Have you seen my niece?

407
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:44,461
I haven't. I'm sorry.

408
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,563
The house next door, it's on the market.

409
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,064
You're listed as the contact.

410
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,764
That house has been rented.

411
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,430
Thank you for your time.

412
00:22:06,763 --> 00:22:08,797
Wow, you guy really know how to party.

413
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:11,496
My mom's not much of a cook.

414
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,447
Uh, what about Cameron?

415
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:17,363
She's not really into food.

416
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:21,428
You gonna get that?

417
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,646
No, if they need me, they'll call my cell.

418
00:22:23,681 --> 00:22:25,830
Oh, right, because you're so important.

419
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,231
Hello, Baum residence.

420
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,430
Yeah, just a sec.

421
00:22:32,465 --> 00:22:33,728
Here's John.

422
00:22:33,763 --> 00:22:35,830
It's your neighbor.

423
00:22:35,865 --> 00:22:37,929
Thanks.

424
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:39,197
Yeah, hey, Kacy. What's up?

425
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,662
Hey, John.

426
00:22:40,697 --> 00:22:42,563
I don't mean to bother you,
but there was a guy here

427
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:43,797
looking for your sister.

428
00:22:43,832 --> 00:22:45,147
When?

429
00:22:45,182 --> 00:22:46,428
Just now.

430
00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:48,064
And I did not get a good vibe from him at all.

431
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:50,630
Something was just off, you know?

432
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:06,830
What's the matter, John?

433
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:08,797
What's wrong?

434
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,933
Out. We gotta get out now.

435
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,165
Why? Who's there?

436
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,500
No, it's okay, I'll get rid of him.

437
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:23,567
No, now. I'll get rid of him.

438
00:23:23,602 --> 00:23:25,467
Riley.

439
00:23:28,033 --> 00:23:30,734
I'm looking for this girl.

440
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,632
She's my niece.

441
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:34,400
Um, sorry, I don't know her.

442
00:23:46,667 --> 00:23:48,933
Wish I could be more help.
Good luck finding her.

443
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:50,500
How do you like your new house?

444
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,933
It's really nice, I love it.

445
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,200
Excuse me, what do you think you're doing?

446
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,033
Hello, you can't just come into people's homes.

447
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,600
Hello, are you listening to me?

448
00:24:10,167 --> 00:24:11,866
What is wrong with you?

449
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:23,165
You're not in these photographs.

450
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,599
Maybe because I was the one taking them.

451
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,300
Look, if you don't leave,
I'm calling the police.

452
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:38,701
Thank you for your time.

453
00:24:56,534 --> 00:24:58,098
We were too supportive.

454
00:24:58,133 --> 00:25:01,965
That was the problem in a nutshell.

455
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,633
Your son says he wants to be a filmmaker.

456
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:07,267
You tell him, "son, movies are great.

457
00:25:07,302 --> 00:25:09,034
"I love going to see them.

458
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:10,701
"but that's pie in the sky.

459
00:25:10,736 --> 00:25:12,334
You need a salary job."

460
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:18,400
Thank you for not going to
the police about this.

461
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:19,966
We just want our things back.

462
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:20,966
"come live at home,"

463
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:22,532
I told him.

464
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,650
"until you can get on your feet."

465
00:25:24,685 --> 00:25:26,734
And every time I bring up the idea

466
00:25:26,769 --> 00:25:28,265
of him getting a salary job,

467
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,650
he's got this project to work on,

468
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:33,000
or that short film he's producing.

469
00:25:33,035 --> 00:25:34,918
He's had his troubles,

470
00:25:34,953 --> 00:25:36,827
but he's a good boy.

471
00:25:36,862 --> 00:25:38,648
He's not a boy, donna.

472
00:25:38,683 --> 00:25:40,399
He's a 34-year-old man.

473
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:42,334
He lives with us, working in a video store,

474
00:25:42,369 --> 00:25:43,767
robbing people's homes.

475
00:25:43,802 --> 00:25:45,365
Video store?

476
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,283
Saturn Video on, uh, La Brea.

477
00:25:47,318 --> 00:25:49,132
And who knows if that's true

478
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:51,233
when every other word out of his mouth is a lie.

479
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:52,817
Does your son have any friends

480
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,326
who might know where he is?

481
00:25:54,361 --> 00:25:55,801
Anyone at the video store?

482
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:00,533
Dave.

483
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:02,565
Dave.

484
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,167
Another boy wonder.

485
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:20,334
This is a very curious turn
of events, Mr. Ellison.

486
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:22,299
I'm innocent.

487
00:26:22,334 --> 00:26:24,033
There's an eyewitness.

488
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:26,432
It wasn't me.

489
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:28,734
The witness is quite sure.

490
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:31,432
As I would be

491
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:35,033
if I had seen what he'd seen.

492
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:40,000
Is there something you want to tell me, James?

493
00:26:40,035 --> 00:26:42,866
Something only I would believe?

494
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:47,866
Not here.

495
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:57,000
I'll be in touch.

496
00:26:59,033 --> 00:27:01,965
Miss Weaver.

497
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,833
Thank you for believing me.

498
00:27:06,966 --> 00:27:08,701
What good is faith if we don't use it?

499
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,833
Where are we going?

500
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:19,634
Nowhere.

501
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:21,365
Anywhere.

502
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,334
That guy isn't really Cameron's uncle, is he?

503
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:24,833
Because then he'd be your uncle.

504
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:27,198
He's nobody's uncle.

505
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:28,683
Then why is he after Cameron?

506
00:27:28,718 --> 00:27:30,133
Is she a criminal or something?

507
00:27:30,168 --> 00:27:32,931
No, he is, all right?

508
00:27:32,966 --> 00:27:35,732
Well, what if he comes back?

509
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:37,933
That's not how-- that's not how he works.

510
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:39,232
John, I don't understand.

511
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,798
Look, that guy is really dangerous.

512
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,634
That's all you need to know. Really dangerous.

513
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:44,934
Well, I got rid of him, didn't I?

514
00:27:44,969 --> 00:27:47,200
I stared him down, and off he went.

515
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:48,865
You got lucky.

516
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,267
Oh, ease up, squinchie.

517
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,634
"Lucky" is my middle name.

518
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:54,399
Lucky Riley Dawson.

519
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:56,500
In that sentence, "lucky" was your first name.

520
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:58,767
Whatever. stickler.

521
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,432
Admit it,

522
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:02,734
I was a brave, spooky ninja.

523
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:04,100
It was totally badass.

524
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,100
Say it! Just say it.

525
00:28:09,135 --> 00:28:11,400
It was badass.

526
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,500
I know!

527
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:22,165
Fool's errands

528
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,250
and fathers of Nablus.

529
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,300
It's been a great day.

530
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:27,951
Brothers. What?

531
00:28:27,986 --> 00:28:29,559
Brothers of Nablus.

532
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:31,464
Genesis. Chapter 34.

533
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:32,999
You memorized the bible?

534
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:34,465
Jacob's daughter Dinah

535
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,467
is raped by Shechem, prince of Nablus.

536
00:28:36,502 --> 00:28:38,766
He falls in love with her.

537
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,732
Shechem's father comes to Jacob

538
00:28:40,767 --> 00:28:43,000
and strikes a bargain to allow
his son to marry Dinah.

539
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:44,998
That's brave of him.

540
00:28:45,033 --> 00:28:47,616
Jacob says yes, on the condition

541
00:28:47,651 --> 00:28:50,200
that all the men in Shechem's town

542
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:51,365
be circumcised.

543
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,266
And everybody gets what they want.

544
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:55,417
Three days later, while Shechem's men

545
00:28:55,452 --> 00:28:57,499
were still in pain from the circumcision,

546
00:28:57,534 --> 00:29:00,634
Dinah's brothers rode into
the city and killed them all.

547
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,966
That's your kind of story.

548
00:29:04,933 --> 00:29:06,666
Yes.

549
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:08,200
My kind of story.

550
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:13,465
Hello.

551
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,965
-Miss Baum?
-Yeah.

552
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,050
This is Dan Deffenbaugh calling to let you know

553
00:29:17,085 --> 00:29:19,100
somebody just attempted a charge with your card.

554
00:29:19,135 --> 00:29:20,265
Where?

555
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,000
At a bowling alley in Van Nuys.

556
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,866
Alien Lanes.

557
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,728
Sorry to keep you waiting.

558
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:52,530
I just have a few more questions,

559
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:54,297
then we'll get you out of here.

560
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,662
So you say Mr. Ellison

561
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,030
was completely nude when he killed Meyers.

562
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:03,962
I already told you that.

563
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:06,697
And that he killed him with his bare hands?

564
00:30:06,732 --> 00:30:08,581
Didn't use a weapon?

565
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:10,395
He strangled him.

566
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,395
Did Meyers fight back?

567
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,997
A little, but the other guy was too strong.

568
00:30:15,032 --> 00:30:16,062
How so?

569
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:18,663
Snapped his neck like it was nothing.

570
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:21,695
A toothpick.

571
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,830
Where was Mr. Ellison before
he killed Mr. Meyers?

572
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,997
Out on the road.

573
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:26,962
The road.

574
00:30:26,997 --> 00:30:29,114
The road, the street, asphalt.

575
00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:31,231
Anything unusual about the street?

576
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:33,048
Who cares about the street?

577
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,830
Are you lying about the street?

578
00:30:41,197 --> 00:30:42,714
It was like, uh--

579
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:44,231
it was like a crater.

580
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:45,496
A pothole.

581
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:48,229
No.

582
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,930
It was like a complete dent in the road.

583
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,430
So Mr. Ellison just appeared

584
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:58,597
out of thin air?

585
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:00,931
There was a light.

586
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:03,231
What kind of a light?

587
00:31:03,266 --> 00:31:06,528
Bluish purple.

588
00:31:06,563 --> 00:31:08,430
It made, like, a cracking sound.

589
00:31:08,465 --> 00:31:10,764
Like lightning.

590
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,029
So Mr. Ellison

591
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:16,864
emerged from this... energy bubble.

592
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:21,030
I never said anything about a bubble.

593
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:23,130
But there s a bubble, correct?

594
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:27,695
So to be clear,

595
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:30,929
you saw Mr. Ellison...

596
00:31:30,964 --> 00:31:33,630
materialize out of this energy bubble,

597
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:35,328
completely nude,

598
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:37,730
walk to Peter Meyers, snap his neck,

599
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:40,097
steal his clothes, and then disappear.

600
00:31:42,164 --> 00:31:43,262
I know what I saw.

601
00:31:43,297 --> 00:31:45,231
Thank you for your assistance.

602
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:07,728
Nice.

603
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:11,296
Okay, so it's 1863

604
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,897
and Abraham Lincoln is on
the train to Gettysburg.

605
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,948
Then the train breaks down.

606
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:17,929
Some small Pennsylvania town.

607
00:32:17,964 --> 00:32:19,297
So he's got to stay there overnight.

608
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:21,029
The only problem...

609
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,297
Town's overrun with zombies.

610
00:32:22,332 --> 00:32:23,598
Shew!

611
00:32:23,633 --> 00:32:24,829
Ha ha.

612
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:26,530
We shoot it on location in Gettysburg,

613
00:32:26,565 --> 00:32:27,829
35 millimeter.

614
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,830
Dude, with what money?

615
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:33,528
What money?

616
00:32:33,563 --> 00:32:36,197
Do you know how much we made
just off these right here?

617
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:38,595
Put it down.

618
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,697
That bag you're holding, it's mine.

619
00:32:41,732 --> 00:32:43,764
Uh, not anymore it isn't.

620
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,762
This place is closed, ladies.

621
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,130
Unless you want to get arrested for trespassing,

622
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,297
I suggest you get the hell out.

623
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:50,097
My jacket, give it to me.

624
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:52,328
Come and get it.

625
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:53,997
Come and give it to me.

626
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:54,997
And the bag.

627
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:02,496
There's a credit card missing.

628
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:08,630
We used it on the arcades. We'll pay you back.

629
00:33:15,297 --> 00:33:17,597
Where's the other guy?

630
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:20,430
What other guy?

631
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:21,830
Stay here.

632
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:40,363
They knew where we live.

633
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,361
No!

634
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:14,395
You know those guys out there?

635
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:17,030
Were you with them when they robbed the house?

636
00:34:19,964 --> 00:34:21,162
You were never there.

637
00:34:21,197 --> 00:34:23,730
You were never here. You never saw me.

638
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:26,264
You don't know what happened here.

639
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:28,328
Understand?

640
00:34:28,363 --> 00:34:31,897
If you say anything to anybody
about what happened here,

641
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:34,363
I'll hunt you down.

642
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,929
I'll kill you.

643
00:34:37,964 --> 00:34:40,730
Now you wait five minutes, then you run.

644
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:41,930
Understood?

645
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:50,296
Clear?

646
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:51,597
Yeah, clear.

647
00:35:02,488 --> 00:35:03,622
You're free to go.

648
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:04,687
What?

649
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:05,854
The witness is a nutjob.

650
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:08,189
The judge kicked his statement in five minutes.

651
00:35:08,224 --> 00:35:10,206
We'll have you out of here in an hour.

652
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,189
Sorry you had to go through all this.

653
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:13,922
That's it?

654
00:35:16,455 --> 00:35:18,105
You're a smart guy, Jim.

655
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,755
Take "yes" for an answer.

656
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,455
Good luck out there.

657
00:36:16,555 --> 00:36:19,355
You said you were gonna have a talk with him.

658
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:20,787
I did.

659
00:36:20,822 --> 00:36:22,286
It was short.

660
00:36:22,321 --> 00:36:23,855
What were you gonna say to him?

661
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,089
Well, you know me.

662
00:36:26,124 --> 00:36:27,488
Funny Derek.

663
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:30,722
Funny Derek.

664
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:35,789
How was the sunset?

665
00:36:35,824 --> 00:36:37,889
Never better.

666
00:37:16,855 --> 00:37:18,453
You never really struck me

667
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:20,388
as the type to stalk your ex-wife.

668
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,471
I'm sorry.

669
00:37:24,506 --> 00:37:26,253
I just, um...

670
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:28,288
I had an urge to see the house.

671
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:31,122
See something familiar.

672
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:32,687
Weird, I know.

673
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:34,855
You do realize you don't live here anymore.

674
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,688
Yeah.

675
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:43,320
Fancy ride.

676
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:46,588
No wonder we keep losing
people to civilian life.

677
00:37:46,623 --> 00:37:48,553
Company car.

678
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:51,055
They lease it for me.

679
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,339
I have to tell you,

680
00:37:53,374 --> 00:37:55,588
You don't look so well.

681
00:37:55,623 --> 00:37:58,421
Yeah, I'm not.

682
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:05,020
I just, um...

683
00:38:05,055 --> 00:38:07,855
I don't know, I...

684
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,754
I miss it.

685
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,922
I miss my old life.

686
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:17,789
James, this is a really weird
time to start into all that.

687
00:38:17,824 --> 00:38:20,455
No, no, I don't mean that.

688
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:23,855
Things have changed.

689
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,639
And I just...

690
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:27,353
I didn't.

691
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:29,371
You're not making sense.

692
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:31,320
Come on, come inside.

693
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:33,655
Paul can make coffee. We’ll talk about it.

694
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,588
Thanks, but I didn't come over for that.

695
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:40,855
Yes, you did.

696
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:46,722
This was the wrong thing for me to do.

697
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:49,423
I don't live here anymore.

698
00:38:49,458 --> 00:38:52,223
It was the right thing to do.

699
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:54,989
Just five years too late.

700
00:38:57,288 --> 00:39:00,055
Call me the next time you wanna
see something familiar.

701
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,189
I'll send you a picture.

702
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:16,453
Who was it?

703
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:18,156
They won't be back.

704
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:22,055
Place looks good.

705
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,253
Yeah, well,

706
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:25,687
I think we pretty much

707
00:39:25,722 --> 00:39:27,288
got everything back to how it was.

708
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,187
We?

709
00:39:30,222 --> 00:39:31,553
Riley helped.

710
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:32,887
So how'd you find 'em?

711
00:39:32,922 --> 00:39:34,187
Was it Derek's fence, or what?

712
00:39:34,222 --> 00:39:36,722
You can't bring people here anymore, John.

713
00:39:36,757 --> 00:39:37,787
What?

714
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:39,089
She had nothing to do with this.

715
00:39:39,124 --> 00:39:41,720
No, you did.

716
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:43,138
She just made it worse.

717
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:44,522
She's a security risk.

718
00:39:50,156 --> 00:39:52,054
Really?

719
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,889
She's never tried to kill me.

720
00:39:56,789 --> 00:39:58,922
And you know that this has
nothing to do with Riley.

721
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:00,221
Or the rules.

722
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:03,920
Or the security of this house.

723
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:06,122
You're pissed off because I found someone

724
00:40:06,157 --> 00:40:07,955
I actually like spending time with

725
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,520
and it's not you.

726
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:13,922
You think I don't want you
to have a normal life?

727
00:40:13,957 --> 00:40:15,754
No, I don't.

728
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,755
Hey, we didn't choose this, John.

729
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,087
It chose us.

730
00:40:19,122 --> 00:40:20,989
And there's nothing either
of us can do about it.

731
00:40:21,024 --> 00:40:22,653
My job is to protect you.

732
00:40:22,688 --> 00:40:24,620
And you can hate me as much as you want,

733
00:40:24,655 --> 00:40:26,889
but I will keep doing that as long as I'm here.

734
00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:31,355
Then why didn't you protect me

735
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,922
when I was killing Sarkissian?

736
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:36,720
Why didn't you protect me

737
00:40:36,755 --> 00:40:40,338
when I had my hands around his throat?

738
00:40:40,373 --> 00:40:43,922
Why didn't you protect me from that?

739
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,620
It's a Moray.

740
00:41:00,655 --> 00:41:03,189
They're nocturnal predators.

741
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:04,588
Does it have a name?

742
00:41:04,623 --> 00:41:06,955
No, it doesn't.

743
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,288
Please, sit.

744
00:41:15,822 --> 00:41:17,655
I read the witness report.

745
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,954
So did I.

746
00:41:18,989 --> 00:41:21,955
He comes across as crazy, doesn't he?

747
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,687
Who wouldn't?

748
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:27,054
You, if you'd tell me the truth.

749
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:29,189
There was another one of you, wasn't there?

750
00:41:29,224 --> 00:41:30,973
A twin?

751
00:41:31,008 --> 00:41:32,687
Yes.

752
00:41:32,722 --> 00:41:34,588
Where is it now?

753
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:36,922
I don't know.

754
00:41:36,957 --> 00:41:39,187
Why did it come?

755
00:41:39,222 --> 00:41:41,455
I think I'm being tested.

756
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:44,122
Like job?

757
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:48,854
You know the story?

758
00:41:48,889 --> 00:41:50,855
He suffered worse than any man before him.

759
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,688
Everything he loved was taken away.

760
00:41:55,321 --> 00:41:58,271
Everything but his life.

761
00:41:58,306 --> 00:42:01,222
But he didn't renounce god.

762
00:42:01,257 --> 00:42:02,789
And god spared him.

763
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:10,189
So who spared you?

764
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:27,189
Where did you get those credit cards?

765
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:32,022
I don't know.

766
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:37,355
Yes, you do.

767
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:47,553
She said...

768
00:42:47,588 --> 00:42:49,122
She would find me.

769
00:42:51,588 --> 00:42:53,421
She said she would kill me.

770
00:42:55,321 --> 00:42:58,255
I promise you,

771
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,189
She won't.
