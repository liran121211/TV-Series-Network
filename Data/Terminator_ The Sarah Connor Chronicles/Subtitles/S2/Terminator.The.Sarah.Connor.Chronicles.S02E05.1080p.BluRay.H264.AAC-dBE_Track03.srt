he's found them too.

- Yeah, I've got a plan.

August 2009
new automated system comes online...

- It's a merit for squaring away Pyle.

And that's a demerit.

This is his life's ambition.
I intend to help him achieve it.

00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,219
What are you supposed to say to that?

313
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,555
You mean, how do you measure up?

00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:19,189
...has been a general, or statesman,
CEO, something amazing.

316
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,565
They all went here.

00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:25,278

about Presidio Alto is?

...I'm all alone, I'm going flat out,
everything just sort of...

321
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,333
...falls away.

322
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,419
But sometimes I wish it...

323
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,755
I...

324
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,510
That you could just keep on running
and never look back.

325
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:56,893

Her name's Alicia.

327
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,314
She's amazing, dude.

328
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,359
She started at Dartmouth this year.
She's a runner like me.

329
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,238
She's coming home in a couple weeks,
and when she goes back...

330
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,784
...I think I wanna go with her.
And never look back.

331
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:19,874
That's a secret, Baum.

332
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,044
You treat it as such.

333
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,759
I always do.

334
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,493
I was just on the roof.

335
00:24:57,413 --> 00:25:00,790
It's flat terrain all around,
but the woods are a problem.

336
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,127
When it comes,
that's where it'll come from.

337
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,462
You're alone and exposed here.

338
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,548
It's not good.

339
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,926
And you're gonna tell me,
"I know better."

340
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,347
Bedell is quitting.

341
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,683
Leaving school.

342
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,685
No, he isn't.

343
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:23,188
- He won't.
- Well, he is.

344
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,065
He doesn't. He graduates.

345
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,567
Goes to West Point.

346
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,028
Why?

347
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:36,159
Because the future already happened,
and he's just going through the motions?

348
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:39,787

00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,010
I didn't mean this.

523
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:45,304
This was never the plan. Ever.

524
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,683
What was the plan?

525
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,519
I don't know.
You can't always have one.

526
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:56,357
Not all the time. Sometimes you just do.
And I did, to you.

527
00:37:56,524 --> 00:38:00,152
Well, you saved my life, right?

528
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,698
So good plan.

529
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,076
Thank you.

530
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,165
I said thank you.

531
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,834
I know, I just...

532
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,921
I haven't heard that in...

533
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,217
I haven't heard that.

534
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:26,553
"You're welcome." Say it.

535
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,560
You're welcome.

536
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:40,025
Now say, "Marty, let me help you
with your book report."

537
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,454
I can't call my mom...

538
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:56,417
...and you're not doing anything, so...

539
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,848
Thank you, Marty.

540
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:15,144
You're welcome.

541
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:20,232
Tonight's exercise
is a rescue extraction.

542
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,775
Meet Old Fred.

543
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:26,113
He weighs about 75 pounds and needs
to be carried from place to place.

544
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:29,450
This is his life's ambition.

545
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,327
And I intend to help him...
DEREK: Forget that. All eyes on me.

546
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,957
Seniors, get your people on-line.
Ten-meter spacing. Eyes up.

547
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:40,169
- What about the obstacle course?
- New exercise.

548
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:43,464
Guy with a gun is gonna come.

549
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:46,967
Do not initiate contact.

550
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,802
Not even for laughs.
Are we clear?

551
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,638
You see him, send a signal.

552
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:55,309
If I see that hand signal
before I see our infiltrator, you win.

553
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,311
Exercise over.

554
00:39:57,479 --> 00:39:59,480
Where will you be?

555
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,984
Looking for that hand signal.

556
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,278
You're with me.

557
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,031
You too.

558
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,872
Those are detonators.

559
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,375
Claymore simulators.
Here, here and here.

560
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:24,171
Wait for the signal. Watch for me to lead
the infiltrator past this line.

561
00:40:24,339 --> 00:40:26,715
When he enters the kill zone,
hit the detonator...

562
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,718
...the simulators go off.
End of story. We go home.

563
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,930
Wait, sir.
The last-minute change in mission...

564
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:36,350
...pre-positioned equipment,
Claymore simulators?

565
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,438
What, we're not having fun?

566
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,065
[EXPLOSIONS & GUNFIRE]

567
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:45,651
Son of a bitch. No, no, no.

568
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,362
Gotta be a little more specific.

569
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,072
DEREK:
Stray shot from one of the kids.

570
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,949
Must have hit one of the EFPs.

571
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,910
It set them all off.
We're swinging in the wind.

572
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:56,870
- Where's the Ogre?
- Coming to kill us.

573
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,331
- Where do you think it is?
- Where is the tank?

574
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,377
About a block away.
Moving towards us.

575
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,712
No way
we've got enough powder to kill it.

576
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,549
I'm gonna lay some covering fire,
drop a couple Endos.

577
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:12,511
- That'll give Kyle time to get back.
- Reese. We can kill that Ogre.

578
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:15,013
We got one more magic bullet.

579
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,224
We just gotta get it out there.

580
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,282
MARTIN: "The Emerald City
was soon left far behind.

581
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,369
As they advanced, the ground
became rougher and hillier...

582
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:41,623
...for there were no farms nor houses
in this country of the West.

583
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:45,085
MARTIN: Before night,
Dorothy and Toto and the Lion...

584
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,421
...lay down upon the grass
and fell asleep...

585
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:51,049
...with the Woodman
and the Scarecrow keeping watch.

586
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:59,975
Now, the wicked Witch had but one eye,
yet she could see everywhere.

587
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:05,397
She saw Dorothy lying asleep,
with her friends all about her.

588
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,063
The Witch looked out
with her one eye.

589
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:50,776
She said to the King Crow,
'Fly at once to the strangers.

590
00:42:50,944 --> 00:42:55,948
Peck out their eyes.
Tear them to pieces.'

591
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:09,670
The wild crows flew in one great flock
toward Dorothy and her companions.

592
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:14,132
When the little girl saw them coming,
she was afraid."

593
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,886
Come here.

594
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:25,102
"But the Scarecrow said,
'This is my battle.

595
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,188
Lie down beside me,
and you will not be harmed."'

596
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,070
Hey! Look over here!

597
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:21,366
It's me, Connor. John Connor.

598
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:27,539
MARTIN:
"The Witch got into a terrible rage.

599
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:31,918
She couldn't understand how all her
plans to destroy the strangers had failed.

600
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:36,214
There was only one way left
to destroy Dorothy and her friends."

601
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,177
You want me to read for a while?

602
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:52,272
"The sky darkened, and a low
rumbling sound was heard in the air.

603
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,109
There was a rushing of many wings,
a great chattering and laughing...

604
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:59,988
...and the sun came
out of the dark sky...

605
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:04,242
...to show the Witch
surrounded by a crowd of monkeys.

606
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,621
'Go to the strangers and destroy
them all, ' said the wicked Witch.

607
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,173
SARAH:
But Dorothy they did not harm at all.

608
00:45:18,341 --> 00:45:22,677
Carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy
in their arms and carried her to the Witch.

609
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,197
The Witch looked into
the child's eyes...

610
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,741
...and saw how simple the soul
behind them was...

611
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,244
...and that she did not know
of her power.

612
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:50,247
The witch said to Dorothy,
'Come with me.

613
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:54,709
For if you do not
I will make an end of you.'

614
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,545
The little girl grew angry.

615
00:45:56,712 --> 00:46:00,090
'You are a wicked creature!' she cried.

616
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,176
In her anger, she picked up
a bucket of water...

617
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:06,513
...and dashed it over the Witch,
wetting her from head to foot.

618
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,765
The Witch gave a cry of fear.

619
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:12,727
As Dorothy looked in wonder,
the Witch began to shrink away.

620
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:17,315
'See what you have done!'
the Witch screamed, 'I shall melt away.'

621
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,488
With these words,
she fell into a melted, shapeless mass.

622
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:27,576
The wicked Witch
had come to an end.

623
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,371
Being at last free to do as she chose,
Dorothy ran...

624
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:35,208
...no longer a prisoner
in a strange land."

625
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,540
Six stops down there's a pay phone
to call your mom.

626
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,626
You got your money?

627
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:21,087
If you get into trouble, you call me.
Say, "Book report."

628
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,715
Whatever it is, I'll come.

629
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,477
Are you a spy?

630
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:38,438
No. I'm not a spy.

631
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,106
Are you a mom?

632
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,150
Yeah, I'm a mom.

633
00:47:42,652 --> 00:47:44,319
You kind of suck at it.

634
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:49,115
I know. I'm working on it.
Let's catch your bus.

635
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:06,299
MARTIN: So this...
This is what I'm supposed to do?

636
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,386
Stay here. Graduate.
Go to West Point like I don't know...

637
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:14,307
...the end of the world is coming?
Like any of this, any of it, really matters.

638
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,936
It does matter.

639
00:48:19,188 --> 00:48:21,523
It all matters.

640
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,567
You believe that?

641
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,447
I've got to.

642
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,414
I'll see you around, Connor.

643
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,586
Yeah. I guess you will.

644
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,645
Sometimes I wish I could
just wake up from all this.

645
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,568
Like from a dream.

646
00:49:12,325 --> 00:49:14,618
But I can't, can I?

647
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,914
You wanna know what happened
to Bedell? What really happened?

648
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,044
I don't know. Do I?

649
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:29,174
I guess it depends
on who I'm talking to.

650
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:32,385
John Baum or John Connor.

651
00:49:35,056 --> 00:49:37,140
Baum is just a name.

652
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,692
I'll go.

653
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,156
- You'll never make it.
- He's my brother.

654
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,325
You wanna save Kyle, or die trying?

655
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,327
Give me the damn EFP.

656
00:49:57,495 --> 00:49:58,995
Please.

657
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,875
I wanna take this one.

658
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,587
You run like hell, okay?

659
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:11,383
Bedell, you run like hell.

660
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:17,013
When this thing goes off, you pop
those wagons, you get those people out.

661
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,932
Don't be a hero.

662
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,519
Go.

663
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,526
DEREK:
And he ran.

664
00:50:29,694 --> 00:50:32,153
He ran so fast.

665
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:39,744
Fast enough to get to that tank
before it got to Kyle's position.

666
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:42,914
Fast enough to blow it sky high.

667
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,298
We rescued 40 prisoners that day.

668
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,761
One of them was John Connor.

669
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:06,813
Martin was always a great runner.

670
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,191
But no one...

671
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:13,403
No one could outrun
a blast like that.

672
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,034
He died, John.

673
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,165
He died for you.

674
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:31,045
We all die for you.
