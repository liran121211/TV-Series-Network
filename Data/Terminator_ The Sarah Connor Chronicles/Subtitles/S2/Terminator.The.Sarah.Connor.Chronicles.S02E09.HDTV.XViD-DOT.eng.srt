1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Previously on Terminator:
The Sarah Connor Chronicles...

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,900
Dr. Boyd Sherman, child psychologist,
family therapist.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,130
What's his link to Skynet... friend or foe?

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,130
Jesse.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,500
Hey, baby.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,030
Are you AWOL?

7
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,030
Jess, did you run

8
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,360
from the war?

9
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:15,800
I need a place to rest.

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,230
What's next?

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,730
We'll come back down here

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,930
and bring something with us

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,130
to destroy it.

14
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm gonna be sick.

15
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,360
What's wrong with her?

16
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,760
I don't know.

17
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,930
- She's... She's burning up.
- I'm fine.

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,330
Is she pregnant?

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,360
Why in the hell would you even ask that?

20
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,400
Kacy vomited

21
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,230
when she was pregnant.

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,960
You're vomiting. It's morning.

23
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,230
That's when it happens.

24
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,460
Just shut up.

25
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,660
It's a bug or something.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,330
Stomach flu or something.

27
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
We'll be home soon, okay?

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,730
Here.

29
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,000
Wait.

30
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,460
How do you feel?

31
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,100
How do I look?

32
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,600
Like crap.

33
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,530
I wish I felt that good.

34
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,060
What's that?

35
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,660
It's rehydration fluid.

36
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,830
Drink one cup every half hour
or right after you vomit.

37
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,060
No, no, no.

38
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,500
Where are you going?

39
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,000
We have to go back now.

40
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,600
- Back where?
- Mexico.

41
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,300
There's thermite in the garage.

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,230
We need to burn Cromartie's body.

43
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,400
Cromartie's dead. You destroyed his chip.

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,530
You have to incinerate him, John.

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,060
It's the only way to be sure.

46
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,000
He's buried in a hole in the middle
of the Mexican desert,

47
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,500
and his chip has been obliterated.

48
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,860
- I think we're pretty...
- Safe?

49
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,630
It's not safe.

50
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,960
Oh, god, she's starting to sound like you.

51
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,200
She's right.

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,260
Hey.

53
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,700
Hey. I need to see you. Now.

54
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,100
Bring a gun.

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,200
Jess?

56
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,100
Hey.

57
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,530
I was over at the shopping
mall this morning, right?

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,660
And I just... I... I don't know.

59
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,160
I can't stop eating the crappy Chinese food

60
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,430
in the food court there.

61
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,830
So I'm there,

62
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,460
and I'm just waiting for my food,

63
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,860
and I look across the way, and I see him.

64
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,830
I just see him.

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,060
You see him who?

66
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,900
Fischer. I see Fischer.

67
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,800
Who's Fischer?

68
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,800
Charles Fischer.

69
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,560
I don't... I don't know who
you're talking about.

70
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,400
You do. You know him.

71
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,830
Charles Fischer, sent back from the future,

72
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,400
and he works for the machines.

73
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,300
And he's gonna die.

74
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,660
What are you doing?

75
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,760
Feeling what it's like to get away from it all.

76
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,530
I don't think you are.

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,200
What do you mean?

78
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,630
If by feelings you mean emotions,

79
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,130
I'm pretty sure you still don't
have any of those.

80
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
And if by feeling you mean what it feels like

81
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,230
to have the wind blow through
your toes or your hair...

82
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,300
I'm pretty sure you can't feel that either.

83
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,260
I don't think You understand how we work.

84
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,330
I have sensation.

85
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,430
I feel.

86
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,460
I wouldn't be worth much if I couldn't feel.

87
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,930
So go through this again.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,200
I've been... I've gone through it again.

89
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,830
- One more time.
- I told you.

90
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,860
I'm at the mall...

91
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,160
Just skip to where you follow this man

92
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,300
to the parking garage and hit him with a brick.

93
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,360
He's a Grey, Derek.

94
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,730
At least tell me you remember the Grey's.

95
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,860
Of course I remember the Grey's.

96
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,700
They were traitors. They worked for Skynet.

97
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,230
Helped the trip-eights act more human.

98
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,360
You don't remember him?

99
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,660
He was on the top of the list.

100
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,160
Tell him!

101
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,630
Tell him who you are and why you're here!

102
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

103
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,100
My name is Paul Stewart.

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,260
That's my license.

105
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,360
Look at my license.

106
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,360
Please.

107
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm not who she says I am!

108
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,130
Liar!

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,260
It's a mistake!

110
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,260
For your sheep will help you, alright?

111
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,600
I told you. Paul Stewart.

112
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,100
I-I-I repair watches. I have a shop in Pasadena.

113
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,300
That's my license.

114
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,360
What are you doing here, Fischer?

115
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,930
Paul Stewart.

116
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,830
I was looking

117
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,730
for an Omega 321 movement.

118
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,800
There's a second-hand store.

119
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,860
Aah.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,960
Aah.

121
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,800
Tin cans didn't send him back
here to fix watches.

122
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,800
I think we all know that.

123
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,460
Why don't you save us the trouble

124
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,230
and tell us the truth?

125
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,660
Why are you here?

126
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,460
I'm Paul Stewart, I live

127
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,460
on Blackburn Avenue.

128
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,400
- Your name is Fischer.
- No.

129
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,660
- You work for Skynet.
- Skynet? No.

130
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,330
What are you doing here, you murdering bastard?!

131
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,030
Do I know you?

133
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,760
No, you don't know me, and I don't know her.

134
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,260
I-I-I don't.

135
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,430
For the love of God, I-I-I'm
not Charles Fischer.

136
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,160
I'm not.

137
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,300
I need you to be sure.

138
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,330
- Sure of what?
- Him.

139
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,700
I am sure. You don't trust me?

140
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,900
It's not that I don't trust you. It's...

141
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,330
I knew the Grey's.

142
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,230
Jesse, I knew them just like you did.

143
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,360
They were war criminals.
We caught, what, four of them?

144
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,060
Right, but we couldn't find Fischer.

145
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,730
They kept him hidden. He was too valuable.

146
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,230
You really don't remember?

147
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,060
Listen, if he is who you say he is,

148
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,230
then he deserves

149
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,900
whatever is gonna happen to him in that room,

150
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,560
but not until he tells us who he is

151
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,430
and what he's doing here.

152
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,060
Do you understand?

153
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,230
He is who I say he is.

154
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,630
I want to hear him say it.

155
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,560
He will.

156
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,860
I'll show you.

157
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
Where's the rest of him?

158
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,760
It's not here.

159
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,160
Not possible. We destroyed his chip.

160
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,660
He didn't walk out of here, but he's gone.

161
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,030
There's only one other person
who knew about this.

162
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,030
There's one other person crazy
enough to dig him up.

163
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,530
You hungry?

164
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,630
Not hungry.

165
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,630
You a vegetarian?

166
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,630
No, I just... I don't know what's in that.

167
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,030
Cheeseburger is in that.

168
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,830
Eat.

169
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,930
Where's your friend?

170
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,530
Out.

171
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm not who she thinks I am.

172
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,830
I sure hope not.

173
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,160
I fix watches.

174
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,300
I used to be an engineer,

175
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,630
but it got old.

176
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,460
I was just a guy in a cubicle

177
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,130
with a bunch of other guys in cubicles,

178
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,960
so I decided to go to Bern to learn...

179
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,460
watch repair.

180
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,760
It's in Switzerland.
You ever been to Switzerland?

181
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,030
That's a nice story.

182
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,100
You don't believe me.

183
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,100
I've told a few myself.

184
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,660
Is she your girlfriend,

185
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,460
this, um, woman?

186
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,330
Do you love her?

187
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,960
It's complicated.

188
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,160
Oh.

189
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,330
Well, I-I-I know complication.

190
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,330
I'm a watchmaker.

191
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,730
It's a... it's a watch joke.

192
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,130
If I were you, I'd eat.

193
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,930
Listen to me.

194
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,100
People do crazy things when they're in love.

195
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,960
Well, I do.

196
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,460
But this is insane.

197
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,130
She says that you know me,

198
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,430
and... and clearly you don't know me.

199
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,900
There's something wrong with her.

200
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,430
So what'd they get you for?

201
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,230
D-did you hear what I just said?

202
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,300
It's prison ink.

203
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,160
Where'd you do time?

204
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,160
I haven't done

205
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,700
any time.

206
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,830
Yes, you have.

207
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,360
No, it's a ta... it's a tattoo,

208
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,330
because I-I fi... I fix watches.

209
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,300
It's a clock.

210
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,830
With no hands.

211
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,930
It means till the end of time.

212
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,400
Life sentence.

213
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,930
If I had a life sentence,
what would I be doing here?

214
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,200
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

215
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,500
Lunch is over.

216
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,500
Hello?

217
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,500
Hey. It's Derek.

218
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,800
Is it?

219
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:42,860
Yeah, I know. Shocks the hell out of me, too.

220
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,100
Listen, I need to talk...

221
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,700
Hello?

222
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,060
I need to talk to you.

223
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,260
So talk.

224
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,100
I'm sending a picture to your phone.

225
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,500
I got it.

226
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,500
Who is it?

227
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,530
I don't know.

228
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,760
You've never seen him?

229
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,130
He's not in your memory banks or whatever?

230
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,900
There's no record of him?

231
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,860
No.

232
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,800
Who is he?

233
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,860
He's...

234
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,060
He's just this guy. I thought maybe I knew him.

235
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,400
He looks hurt.

236
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,800
Don't worry about it.

237
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,160
Who was that?

238
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,330
Derek.

239
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,300
Derek.

240
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,460
What'd he say? Is everything okay?

241
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,460
Is mom okay?

242
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,260
Everything's okay.

243
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:43,900
Don't worry about it.

244
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,030
Can I help you?

245
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,930
I was waiting.

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,930
I heard...

247
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,860
Do you remember me?

248
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,900
Of course I remember you.

249
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,430
I have, um...

250
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,360
It's possible I have an emergency.

251
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,930
You came to my office over a month ago,

252
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,230
and you said your son needed help...

253
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,000
Therapy.

254
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,600
I never saw

255
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,260
either of you again.

256
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,800
Wait. Dr. Sherman, please.

257
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,260
I've had some bad luck with shrinks.

258
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,800
Well, you could stop calling them shrinks.

259
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,130
That might help.

260
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,700
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

261
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,630
My assistant will be here
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

262
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,830
Make an appointment.

263
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I'm here now.

264
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,300
Sarah, make an appointment, please.

265
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,600
We'll see what we can do.

266
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,060
I've been sick...

267
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,760
Flu or something.

268
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,300
I'm exhausted.

269
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,230
I can't sleep, and when I do, I have dreams.

270
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,730
Nightmares, actually.

271
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,930
I walk in my sleep.

272
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,200
Where are you walking to?

273
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,500
What do you mean?

274
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,160
I mean, where do you go when you walk?

275
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,760
I'm chasing someone, or I'm being chased.

276
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,200
But where do you go?

277
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,260
Out.

278
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:07,830
I get the hell out.

279
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,860
You're here. Come on in.

280
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,200
There are many things I don't understand.

281
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,960
Like what?

282
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:28,430
The tortoise.

283
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,000
What tortoise?

284
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,960
It was on its back by the side
of the road in Mexico.

285
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,800
Your mother turned it over.

286
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,160
She was helping it.

287
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,900
I know. But why?

288
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,400
'cause that's what we do.

289
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,560
When we, uh...

290
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,900
When we see something

291
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,100
that's, uh, in pain, or in trouble, or whatever,

292
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,700
we try and help it.

293
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,300
Empathy.

294
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,800
Something like that.

295
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,500
But not everyone would turn the tortoise over.

296
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,160
No.

297
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,660
Some would just leave it there.

298
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,000
Some would probably drive over it and crush it.

299
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,560
Yeah, I guess they would.

300
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,600
Is that what you'd do?

301
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:25,800
It didn't seem like much of a threat.

302
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,560
We're not built to be cruel.

303
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:31,160
Yeah, that's one for cyborgs.

304
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:35,060
Yes.

305
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,600
That's one for us.

306
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,230
Cameron.

307
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,330
What are you doing?

308
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,330
The body is gone.

309
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,530
What?

310
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,930
Cromartie's body is gone.

311
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,760
That's impossible.

312
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,830
You are the only one who
knew where we buried it.

313
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,560
We need it. We have to destroy it.

314
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,160
What would I possibly want with it?

315
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,760
Cameron.

316
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,900
He's lying.

317
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,960
You don't know that.

318
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,060
Please,

319
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,600
John.

320
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,830
If you know, you better tell me right now.

321
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,430
I don't know.

322
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,700
I don't know.

323
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,000
Let him go.

324
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,130
Why?

325
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,300
He's telling the truth.

326
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,460
We could find out for certain.

327
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,700
Let him go.

328
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,560
Sorry.

329
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,060
What the hell?

330
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,900
He doesn't want to tell us who he is.

331
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,900
- I brought proof.
- Proof?

332
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,830
Please, please don't hurt me.

333
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't hurt me, please.

334
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,100
- That's up to him.
- Who's he?

335
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,800
Who are you?

336
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,430
Uh, my name is Charlie Fischer.

337
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,800
You were at my... my job...

338
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,830
SRF.

339
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,300
Uh, we do Seismic Retrofitting.

340
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,530
I'm a service technician.

341
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,360
That's all. I'm... I'm nobody.

342
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,160
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

343
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,860
Tell him who you are.

344
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,330
I've already told you who I am.

345
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,830
This is a trick, some crazy trick,

346
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,800
and you're all in on it, and you too.

347
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,530
What do you want from me?!

348
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,200
I want you...

349
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,760
To tell me...

350
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,930
The truth!

351
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,160
Oh, god!

352
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,430
If he is who you say he is...

353
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,800
He is!

354
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,130
All right, fine. He is.

355
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,330
We need to know what he's doing here.

356
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,600
Unless he's AWOL, like you.

357
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,460
He's not.

358
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,660
Not this guy, not Charles Fischer.

359
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,230
He's been sent back

360
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,860
by them for a reason.

361
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,000
You need to beat the hell out of him.

362
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,730
You need to get him to talk.

363
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,860
Aah!

364
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,830
Aah! Aah! Aah!

365
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:33,760
No, please.

366
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,760
- Please, please.
- I'm sorry,

367
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,830
- really.
- Aah!

368
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,060
Derek!

369
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,130
Don't... Don't hurt the boy.

370
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,600
Don't...

371
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,130
Some people, you can beat them and beat them,

372
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,460
and they'll take it.

373
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,960
Whatever pain you give them,

374
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,500
they absorb it,

375
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,830
like it was theirs all along,

376
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,560
and all you're doing is giving it back to them.

377
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,560
You see, deep down,

378
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,160
they hate themselves,

379
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,160
and they use that hate to eat the pain.

380
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,330
See, we were all good once.

381
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,060
We all loved ourselves once,

382
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:18,400
as young men

383
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,560
trying to get through the day,

384
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,160
or as kids

385
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,800
playing in the park.

386
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,460
Okay.

387
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,400
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

388
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,160
My name is Charles Fischer.

389
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,930
I'm Charles Fischer.

390
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,830
Now let him go.

391
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,130
He's got nothing to do with this.

392
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,330
Just let him go.

393
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,130
This is impossible!

394
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,330
Can't you people see that this is insane?!

395
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,500
Why are you here?

396
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,300
Why did they send you back?

397
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,500
They didn't.

398
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,460
I'm not here on a mission.

399
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,300
Nobody comes back without a mission.

400
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,230
This is my reward.

401
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,660
When the bombs dropped,

402
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,660
I was locked up in Pelican Bay.

403
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,560
Solitary confinement.

404
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,060
Life sentence.

405
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:37,130
If I hadn't been in prison,

406
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,960
I never would've made it through judgment day.

407
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,460
Once they got their hands on me,

408
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:44,460
it was either I teach them

409
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,800
everything I learned inside

410
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,500
or say good-bye.

411
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,760
And what'd you learn?

412
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,760
I learned what makes people tick.

413
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:11,000
So the fever that brought on the dreams

414
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,830
was caused by something you ate,
you think, in Mexico.

415
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,030
Yes.

416
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,060
What were you doing in Mexico?

417
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,500
Vacation.

418
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,000
Family vacation?

419
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,500
Yes.

420
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:26,360
Has anything happened since I saw you last?

421
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,400
What do you mean?

422
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,100
I mean, have you suffered a trauma?

423
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,600
Um, has there been a crisis in the family,

424
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,930
something more

425
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,800
between you and John since I've seen you last?

426
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:40,800
I came to you for help in
understanding my dreams.

427
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,060
Well, the problem is,

428
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:44,130
without knowing the details of your life,

429
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,130
I'm not sure what I can tell you,

430
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,930
beyond generalities.

431
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,030
I can tell you that dreams tend to mirror

432
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,800
the central conflict in the dreamer.

433
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,960
Would it be accurate to say

434
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,030
that the central conflict
in your life is your son?

435
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,630
Yes.

436
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,760
And your daughter,

437
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,030
you have less conflict with.

438
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,700
- It's different with her.
- What is?

439
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,500
Conflict, uh, type of conflict,

440
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,930
the... the nature of your relationship, what?

441
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,160
Everything.

442
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,660
Specifically.

443
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,430
I don't want to talk about her.

444
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,860
Then why are you here?

445
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,830
I mean, you come in here

446
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,160
pretending to want to talk about your dreams,

447
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,560
and refusing to talk about John and Cameron,

448
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,760
which, in my opinion,

449
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:33,760
is what your obsession with the three dots

450
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:35,100
is all about.

451
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,700
So if you only want to talk about

452
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,760
one of those dots,

453
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,660
there's not much I can do.

454
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,200
I have no one else to talk to.

455
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,460
Nothing is going to happen in here

456
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,060
until you decide to be honest.

457
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,860
You seem surprised.

458
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,500
Judgment day...

459
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,730
Machines...

460
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,860
You have no idea

461
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,400
what you'd do.

462
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,800
What's the hardest decision
you've ever had to make?

463
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,000
Huh?

464
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,330
Whether to stay with Rebecca

465
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,600
or take a chance on Christine?

466
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,760
Whether to ask for time off

467
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,000
for grandfather's funeral

468
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:50,460
because you're too afraid you'll
be fired if you just take it?

469
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,860
You think...

470
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,200
you know who you are?

471
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,130
You don't have a clue.

472
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,200
Can't you just tell them what they want to know?

473
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,560
What does it matter now?

474
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,400
You're here. You're safe.

475
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,300
Are you?

476
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,630
No, he's playing with us,

477
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,530
making us think he's weak.

478
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,530
He's not weak.

479
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,060
- How do you know?
- I know, all right?

480
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,400
I know.

481
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,060
You may not remember, but I know.

482
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:32,330
He is the worst of them. He's the worst.

483
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,630
He needs to die, Derek.

484
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,260
Forget why he's here.

485
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,000
Forget whatever the mission is.

486
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,460
He just needs to die.

487
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,200
What did he do?

488
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,630
Jess, what did he do to you?

489
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,830
There was a raid on a bunker.

490
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,660
Metal was everywhere.

491
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:51,460
They took out our command,

492
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,330
killed everyone over 30,

493
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,900
killed the children.

494
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,460
They took the prisoners to this place.

495
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,030
I will demonstrate...

496
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,100
He was there.

497
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,700
How to extract information

498
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,200
out of people.

499
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,200
In essence,

500
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,530
we will explore

501
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,660
what makes people tick.

502
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,030
He said he was gonna teach
them how to talk to people,

503
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,930
how to get information from people,

504
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,960
how to be people.

505
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,700
There are many different tactics

506
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,700
you can employ,

507
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,560
all of which will give you a deeper insight

508
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,330
into the human psyche.

509
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,700
It was a kind of

510
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,330
perverse theater, like...

511
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,030
like he was teaching them.

512
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,000
How long did it go on?

513
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,160
Weeks.

514
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,560
Months.

515
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,330
There were drugs...

516
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,160
and starvation.

517
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,000
And he talked to you...

518
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,860
for hours...

519
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,330
for days...

520
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,030
Tell me about the bunker.

521
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,530
Just to break you down,

522
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,030
just to get to your in...

523
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,860
Tell me the location, please.

524
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,360
To get to you.

525
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,930
Tell me the location.

526
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,030
How'd you get out?

527
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,860
I don't know.

528
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,400
You never told me.

529
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,260
What?

530
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,900
It wasn't me Fischer had, baby.

531
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,130
It was you.

532
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,330
Aah!

533
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,660
Aah!

534
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,700
Ah! Go to hell.

535
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
Go to hell.

536
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,700
You don't remember.

537
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,230
I can't believe you don't remember.

538
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,030
My name is Derek Reese,

539
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,260
First Lieutenant, 132nd SOC.

540
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,660
Yeah, well, good for you.

541
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:28,360
Not for you.

542
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,930
I told you I'm not on a mission.

543
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I don't care.

544
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,660
Oh, yeah, you remember. You remember now.

545
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,830
I was wondering how long that was gonna take.

546
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,500
No, I don't remember.

547
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,500
But she does,

548
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,160
and that's good enough for me.

549
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,530
So you gonna kill me?

550
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,400
Not you.

551
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,400
Oh, god. Thank you.

552
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,800
Thank you. Thank you.

553
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,460
John?

554
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,460
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

555
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,900
I wasn't sleeping.

556
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,760
Just needed to close my eyes for a few minutes.

557
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,160
How you feeling?

558
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,060
What does this mean to you?

559
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,000
I keep seeing it in my dreams, John.

560
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,260
It means something.

561
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,160
Mom, you're tired. You've been sick.

562
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,360
Chasing killer robots will do that to you.

563
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,130
We couldn't find Cromartie's body.

564
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,400
It wasn't there. It's gone.

565
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,030
Ellison.

566
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,360
He doesn't have it.

567
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,500
Are you sure?

568
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,500
I'm sure.

569
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,700
Cromartie was in my dreams.

570
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
It's connected. It's all connected.

571
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,660
Mom, you had a dream.

572
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,030
It was my fault.

573
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,260
What was your fault?

574
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,130
Cromartie... I led him to you.

575
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
What are you talking about?

576
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,830
There was this kid, a boy...

577
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,000
in the bowling alley.

578
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,660
He was with the guys who broke into our house,

579
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:42,230
and I sh...

580
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,500
I knew what I had to do, John.

581
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,960
I didn't do it. I let him go.

582
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,000
Cromartie must've found him.

583
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,730
We're not murderers.

584
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,960
You're not.

585
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:07,000
Tell that to the boy.

586
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,100
I'm sure he's dead.

587
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,100
We have to find that body, John.

588
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,930
I know.

589
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,660
You don't think he'll...

590
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,500
talk...

591
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,060
Young Fischer.

592
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,160
We had to let him go.

593
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,500
He's not the monster we just buried.

594
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,730
Let's hope he doesn't become one.

595
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,160
Do you remember any of it?

596
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:01,060
Even a flash?

597
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,200
No, nothing.

598
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,160
It was all we talked about, Derek...

599
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,330
What he'd done,

600
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,860
how you were gonna find him one day.

601
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,500
You were obsessed.

602
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,400
It was a trauma. You've blocked it.

603
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,860
Maybe, maybe not.

604
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,960
Maybe... maybe it never happened to me.

605
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,030
Derek,

606
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,930
I was there.

607
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,830
Maybe I came from a future
where it never happened,

608
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,830
and now you've come from a future where it did.

609
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,860
Is that possible?

610
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,830
Ever since I've been back here,
I've... I've done...

611
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,000
things.

612
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,930
I've... I've changed things.

613
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,800
Maybe I changed the future.

614
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,300
That's why we're here, isn't it?

615
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,160
To change the future.

616
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,960
Do you think there's a version of the future

617
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,830
where we're not together?

618
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,200
No.

619
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,160
Charles Fischer?

620
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,160
Yeah.

621
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,600
FBI, department of homeland security.

622
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,560
Need you to come with us, please.

623
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,800
Two nights ago, you entered
the building unauthorized

624
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,300
at 4:16 a.m.

625
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,230
What were you doing here?

626
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,000
That's a mistake.

627
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,230
Two nights ago? No.

628
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,500
I wasn't there.

629
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,030
I would have no reason to be there at that time.

630
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,100
Computers don't lie, Mr. Fischer.

631
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,660
At 4:23,

632
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,830
seven minutes after you entered the building,

633
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,000
there was an unauthorized access

634
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,600
to the computer networking system.

635
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,760
That wasn't me.

636
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,160
This system allows user access

637
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,500
to all primary military-industrial complex

638
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,160
computer systems.

639
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,660
I'm telling you that this is all a big mistake.

640
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,430
I do seismic retrofitting.

641
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,860
I don't even know how to access
a computer system.

642
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,230
Why would I do that?

643
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,460
I don't know, Mr. Fischer.

644
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,360
You tell me.

645
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:06,030
Why would you install a Roving Back Door

646
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,600
into those computer systems?

647
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,460
One that we can't dismantle so far.

648
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,360
You want to tell us how to do that as well?

649
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

650
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,100
I wasn't there.

651
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,630
What happened to you?
You look a little banged up.

652
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,200
Want to explain that?

653
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,230
I don't know if I can.

654
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,230
Try.

655
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,830
So...

656
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,860
What is it you wanted to show me?

657
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,360
We need to learn how they work...

658
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,530
how to fight them.

659
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,300
We can't allow history to repeat itself,

660
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,760
not when we have the power to stop it.

661
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:33,730
It's up to us now...

662
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,760
The two of us.

663
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,000
Yes...

664
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,730
it is.

665
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,000
What am I doing here?

666
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,630
I don't know.

667
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,430
It's a waste of time. You just lie and lie.

668
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,130
It's a waste of time. I just lie and lie.

669
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,460
Don't you have things to do?

670
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:31,900
Yes, I do. I have things to do.

671
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:38,830
I should get back to work.
