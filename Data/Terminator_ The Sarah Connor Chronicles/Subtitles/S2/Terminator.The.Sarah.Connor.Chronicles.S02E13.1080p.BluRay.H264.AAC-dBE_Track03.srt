- Yeah, I do actually.

172
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,809
- Why?
- Because she's your mom...

173
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,978
...and I care about you.

174
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,690
Hey, you got something.

175
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,864
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

176
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,866
- It's a bruise.
- John, it's nothing.

177
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,284
Who did that to you?

178
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,328
- John, please.
- Was it your foster dad?

179
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:11,039
- No. It was no one, okay?
- I swear I'll kick his ass.

180
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:16,211
John. It wasn't him, okay?
I swear. Just drop it, please.

181
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,054
The answer's still no.

182
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,183
- I can't do what you're asking.
- Shame.

183
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,518
I thought a night's sleep

I didn't sleep.

John Henry needs someone to talk to
now that Dr. Sherman is gone.

186
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:41,278
Dr. Sherman is gone because he...
It killed him.

187
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:45,073
It wasn't murder, Mr. Ellison.
You said so yourself.

188
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,618
You said I was remiss
in creating John Henry...

189
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,745

Our opportunity?

192
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:59,588
Your religious faith and paternal instinct
make you the ideal candidate...

...to foster his moral development.

194

That thing killed 20 FBI agents.

195
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,972
It needs a whole lot more

The program responsible
for those murders is gone.

The John Henry program

completes his development?

his puppet is capable of...

Mr. Ellison.

- I don't know.

214
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,143
It was an anonymous posting
in a UFO chat room.

- Do you belong to many newsgroups?
- I'm not much for computers.

I'm only interested in the drones...

the ones that Abraham saw.

- Not good enough.

235
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,560
A few years after MIT,
I went to work for an aerospace firm.

236
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,146
It was there that I was approached
by a company...

237
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,732
...that needed my expertise with lidar.

238
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,775

00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,997
We all signed NDAs.
Everybody worked in isolation.

what I was working with.

I was driving home from work...

252
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,772
...and my brakes went out.

253
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,024
Next morning, I went to the bank...

254
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,860
...and withdrew all my savings,
went into hiding.

Can you prove anything

I have a piece.

I stole a piece before I left.

- In a storage facility.

I was thinking that instead
of just getting another foster home...

...that maybe we could find
someplace close together.

But the heat. We're in the desert.

523
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,926
It doesn't make sense.

524
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,971
Nothing makes sense.

525
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,768
We're on a dirt road.

526
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:53,729
Now a bump.

527
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,357
A clacking under the tires.

00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:03,530
At the end of the dirt road
is a warehouse.

530
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,319
There's an office in front.

531
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:46,615
No windows. No way to see in or out.

Does that bother you?

533

EILEEN:
No. I like not being seen.

534
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,833
I don't know who they are,
but that's okay...

535
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,711
...because they don't know
who I really am either.

I'm a waitress.

Will do. First thing in the morning.

- I'm sorry, ma'am. We're closed.
- Where's the metal?

Please. Don't shoot.
Please don't shoot me.

- I don't know what you're talking about.

- Who are you?
- My name's Winston.

I install air conditioning, all right?

- What's in the warehouse?
- I don't know.
