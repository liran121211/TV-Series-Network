At least that is what you told me.

172
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,062
Yeah. She's better now.

Where is she?

174

She's in hiding.

You have included them

Do you believe in the actual devil?

181
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,839
Something opposes God.

182
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,967
Something tempts man into sin.

183
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,930
I don't know about God or heaven.

184
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,936
But I do believe that someone or something
wants this world to burn.

185
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,398
The devil. Demons.

186
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,483

My daughter?

all law-enforcement channels.

00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,461
It seems prudent.

208
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,504
It seems illegal.

- And which we will not.
- Now's not the time.

- I want to meet him.

They may attack again.

I think he knows something.

220
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:06,034
And besides, he saved my daughter.

00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:08,328
- And I want to thank him.
- Thank you.

00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,883
It's a bad idea.

I don't know
what you think John knows.

225
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:27,305
I know he was at my house
when the attacker showed up.

I want to know why.

227

I want to know why.

and his cyborg companion...

to the John Henry body.

Yes, she's a cyborg.

- Silencers.

00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,587
You think she has cancer because she's
lost weight. How much has she lost?

00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,673
Eleven percent of her mass

255
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,642

- One what? What?

533
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,433
- Please, I'm not metal.
- Don't move. Don't move.

534
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,602
I swear I haven't got anything.
I'm... I'm human.

535
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,480
Because I will blast you.
MAN: Stand down.

536
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,783
Look in his eyes.

537
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,661
He's got about as much metal in him
as you do.

538
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,663
Derek?

539
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,665
Yeah?

540
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,792
John.

541
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,089
John Connor.

542
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,801
I know a lot of people, kid.
I don't know you.

543
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,181
Anybody heard the name
John Connor?

544
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,938
Well, you know what?

545
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,815
I think you're gonna be famous.

546
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,818
My brother's back,
and you're wearing his coat.

547
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,178
SARAH:
I love you too.
