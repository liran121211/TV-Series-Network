They're not theirs.

171
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:02,805
They're just
losers and castoffs and rejects.

172
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,641

174
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,483
What's your favorite?

175
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:22,616
Uh, I don't know. I like Yosemite.
I've been there. With my mom.

176
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,456

I'm gonna guess the bear.

177
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:34,211
- You seem like a bear person.
- It's not a poster of a bear.

178
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,633
It's a poster of a fish
being caught by a bear.

179
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:44,513
Just swiped out of the water,
totally at random.

180
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,351
Do the other fish even care?

181
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,563
Do they even notice? No.

182
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:57,985
They just keep swimming
like nothing happened.

183
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,738
Because nothing important did.

184
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:09,913
- You know what? I think I'm gonna go.
- No.

No. Stay.

189
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,108

190
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:43,572

there's nothing I can explain.

...than atoms in the universe.

- It's not the Turk.

at the one-two point.

00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,651
It's a Go proverb.

210
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,861
It means the usual rules
don't always apply.

211
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,364
It's always the same rules.
They always apply.

212
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:11,201
Dakara has no money.
They'll miss the Air Force's deadline.

213
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,163
They'll find the money.

214

Everything they need. Every penny.
They'll get their miracle.

216
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,130

...and I thought he was gonna
tell me everything.

223
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,842
I think that's what he wanted to do.

224

225
