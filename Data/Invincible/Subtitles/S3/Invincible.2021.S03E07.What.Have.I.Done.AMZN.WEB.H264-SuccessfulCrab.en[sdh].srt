Oh, God.

[Omnivincible] Now what, Mark?

371
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:46,399
You can't save her and fight us both.

372
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,902
Yeah, you're fucked, dude.

Sir, with this body,
I can do more out there than in here.

378
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,250
You're just gonna
get yourself killed, Donald.

379

Link up with him.

384
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,178

Hey, my dad killed most of you guys

And your stretchy friend

He's awesome!

408

Wait. What'd he say
when I ripped him in half?

409
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,572
Shit. It-it was, like, so weird, right?

410

I don't want to not be living!

Wasn't that it, or was...
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, no, it wasn't.

Man, I always do this.

431
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,124
I kill them too fast, and then it's over.

-I can't go, Paul.

So am I.

447
00:20:43,952 --> 00:20:45,912
{\an8}[William] Why did we stay
on campus, Rick?

448
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:50,333

in a thing called a-a core.

Since it didn't get punched to goop,

468
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,598
I'll eventually be able
to pull myself together.

469
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,684
Was that too much information?

470

I'm not even sure I'm awake right now.

Where's Darkwing?

472
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,732

Darkwing sacrificed himself to save us.

So we need to get back in the game.

902
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,871
[sighs]

903
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,874
[sighing]

904
00:47:16,084 --> 00:47:18,336
[loud whoosh]

905
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:21,714
[Conquest] Stand ready
for my arrival, worm.

906
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:24,425
[dramatic music playing]

907
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,267
You were given orders.

908
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,227
You were given time.

909
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,896
You were given more leeway than most,

910
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,316
and yet, I find this planet unprepared
for the arrival

911
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,402
of our Viltrum Empire.

912
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:43,486
[gasps]

913
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,239
This isn't a good time.

914
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,491
The Empire anticipated your resistance,

915
00:47:48,575 --> 00:47:51,411
which is why they sent me.

916
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,413
I am Conquest,

917
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:55,290
and I am your last chance

918
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,709
to fulfill your duty.

919
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,336
You don't understand.

920
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,547
All this?

921
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,382
This is my fault.

922
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,344
So the only thing I want to do right now

923
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:13,433
-is hit something as hard as I can.
-[exciting music playing]

924
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,227
Mm. Good.

925
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,063
[grunts]

926
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,609
[crying out]

927
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:47,425
[music ends]
