1
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,798
<i>Mark's speed has increased 65%.</i>

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,384
<i>Endurance, 70%.</i>

3
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:11,636
<i>Strength, 138%.</i>

4
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,055
Get off him!

5
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>We're both
rejoining the Guardians.</i>

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,016
Are you guys engaged?

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,060
You're only asking me out now because

8
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:22,063
<i>the other me told you
how miserable she was?</i>

9
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,983
<i>D.A. Sinclair
took so much of me away.</i>

10
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,151
I don't think they found it all.

11
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:28,403
<i>It was worth every minute</i>

12
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,989
<i>of my incarceration.</i>

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,701
If I'm going down, so is everyone!

14
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,035
I don't think so.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,579
<i>Are you working with D.A. Sinclair?</i>

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,624
<i>He can't fix his mistakes
in prison, Mark. Neither can Darkwing.</i>

17
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,543
The white room is for my protection.

18
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:44,794
Protection from what?

19
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,965
- From you.
- Oh.

20
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,513
Hey, I got fresh fish here.

21
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,974
Come and get your fresh fish.

22
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:00,435
Huh?

23
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:10,905
- Hey.
- Mm.

24
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,156
Eh.

25
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:27,296
Hmm.

26
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,721
Namaste, friend.

27
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:41,392
How can I help you find inner peace today?

28
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,395
Thanks for asking,
but I think it's a little late for that.

29
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,525
Get out. All of you. Now!

30
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,159
Please. Whatever
you want, just-just take it!

31
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:17,387
This is Stedman.
Nothing here. Tip was a bust.

32
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,683
Repeat. Tip was a bust.

33
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,739
Shit<i>.</i>

34
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:46,791
You found us.

35
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,419
But you found us too late.

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,213
This place will be
swarming with agents in minutes.

37
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,592
Nuh-uh-uh. You gave the all-clear.

38
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,135
No one's coming.

39
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:59,096
And they never will.

40
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,243
You forget the simple power

41
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,578
of the human body.

42
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,588
I don't get it.

43
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:35,924
You're gonna set that thing off?

44
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,927
And kill thousands? What for?

45
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:42,806
Someone like you
could never see the beauty in it.

46
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:49,646
Yes, most of the city will die.

47
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,982
But the survivors
will inherit a new world.

48
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,901
And learn that life is a gift

49
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,570
- not to be wasted.
- Aah!

50
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,281
Revolutions will begin around the world,

51
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,825
casting off the shackles

52
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,161
of industrial society.

53
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,997
We shall return to the natural,

54
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,874
the divine.

55
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,461
Lady, you don't know people.

56
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,587
Aah!

57
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,066
Seems I returned just in time.

58
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:41,406
Well done, Force Fist.

59
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,574
You've lost.

60
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,493
You and your nightmare state

61
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:49,872
will never stop
the Order of the Freeing Fist--

62
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:01,092
I knew who you were
the minute I walked in.

63
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:03,052
"Tip was a bust" my ass.

64
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,721
It was code

65
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:07,516
for "come stop these nutjobs."

66
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,229
Life on this plane

67
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,398
is only a distraction.

68
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,066
What the hell are you doing?

69
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,860
And fear of death

70
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:22,030
will never keep us from our destiny.

71
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,450
Wait! Don't! No!

72
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,407
Oh, shit! Help him, quick!

73
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:25,301
How many did we lose?

74
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,428
We would've lost thousands

75
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,597
if it wasn't for you.

76
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,600
Then answer my question.

77
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,685
Some of the gas drifted into the market

78
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,647
before we could get it contained.

79
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,028
Seventeen.

80
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,948
A fraction of what it would have been.

81
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,658
We won, Cecil.

82
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,204
Ask the families of the 17 if they agree.

83
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,000
Take a little R & R,
then come back and collect your medal.

84
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:00,838
Glad to see the artificial skin took,
by the way.

85
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,298
Except I'm gonna need my money back.

86
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,467
They missed a spot.

87
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,387
It was all that was left of my real skin.

88
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:12,223
They wanted to replace it,
but I wouldn't let them.

89
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,600
Why not?

90
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,646
It's a reminder that I messed up.

91
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,732
And to never let it happen again.

92
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,870
Leave me, Stedman. That's an order.

93
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,830
But we're almost to the safe room.

94
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,337
Not leaving the party early, are we?

95
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,100
- Huh?
- It's okay. They work for us now.

96
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,853
- They're insane.
- They were.

97
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,064
But they were also too good to waste.

98
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,150
So, I fixed them.

99
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,760
Director.

100
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,429
They should be in prison. Or dead.

101
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,640
They're making up for their mistakes.

102
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:38,017
Mistakes? That's what you call it?

103
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,103
Get your head out of your ass.
They just saved our lives.

104
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,856
Then let me express my gratitude.

105
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,820
I don't work with criminals.

106
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,240
Not even if they're--

107
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:01,499
- Hey, is that my new roommate?
- Hey, fuck you!

108
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,917
Hey, fuck you!

109
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,753
Oh, okay, fine!

Hi. What's your name?

127
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,002
Boss. You got a visitor.

128
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,806
Why are you here, Radcliffe?

129
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,726
Do you mind?

130
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,775
I'm stepping down as GDA director,

131
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:53,779
moving over
to a new special projects group.

132
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,781
I don't care.

133
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:58,658
I want you to replace me.

134
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,620
No wonder they want you out.

135
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:05,707
There were three deaths a week
in this place before you got here.

136
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,626
Three years later...

137
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,378
You have no idea

138
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,755
what I've had to do to make it this way.

139
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,965
You did exactly what you had to do.
You brought

140
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,427
<i>order to chaos.
Nothing more, nothing less.</i>

141
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:22,515
Sure, a few people
had to pay the price, but...

142
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,558
the math works out.

143
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,520
You think I wasn't watching?

144
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,021
I told you before.

145
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,524
I don't waste talent. I fix it.

146
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:34,860
This place was your rehabilitation.

147
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,821
It was supposed to be my punishment.

148
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,906
It was both.

149
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,033
And now it's over.

150
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,453
If you take the job.

151
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,914
No.

152
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:52,628
I can't force you to see things
how they really are.

153
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,424
But here's
what you still don't understand.

154
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:58,968
You can be the good guy.

155
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:01,263
Or the guy who saves the world.

156
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,932
You can't be both.

157
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:19,364
Protection from what?
Protection from me?

158
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:22,576
What are you even talking about?

159
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:29,290
It's my job to defend
the planet from threats.

160
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:32,042
Don't make me put you
in that category, Mark.

161
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,006
Do you use these things
to keep Darkwing in line?

162
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,883
Or Sinclair?

163
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,677
Darkwing and Sinclair

164
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,637
don't have your abilities.

165
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,891
Abilities I only use to help people.

166
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,227
Who are you helping right now?

167
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,439
You see things one way and you won't
make room for any other viewpoint.

168
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,899
You threaten people who disagree with you.

169
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,275
I don't threaten.

170
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,443
No?

171
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,154
Because you're scaring
the shit out of me right now.

172
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,740
I'm not even doing anything!

173
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:07,369
What is this?

174
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,330
You think you can shut me up?

175
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:10,831
Mark...

176
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,564
You're afraid I'll blow the whistle, huh?

177
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,525
Tell everyone
how you really run this place.

178
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:40,528
You think people here
don't know what we do?

179
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:43,573
Just stand down and we can talk this over.

180
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,400
Is that all you got?

181
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:22,404
Why did you have to ask that, kid?

182
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,704
You happy?

183
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:33,873
Now stop.

184
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,627
Not until you admit to everyone
what you've done.

185
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,549
Mark, I don't want to hurt you.

186
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,135
I'm not the one who's gonna get hurt.

187
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,053
{\an8}You said you don't do threats.

188
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,597
{\an8}Yeah.

189
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,393
{\an8}Well, people change.

190
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,231
Don't, Mark. I'm warning you.

191
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,579
Remember that giant lobster
you tangled with in Atlantis?

192
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,624
I had the lab boys
recreate the sound it made.

193
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,209
Turns out we can transmit it
to your earpiece.

194
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,380
Not that earpiece.

195
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,050
The one we implanted
when you were in our hospital.

196
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,177
The one too deep to reach.

197
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,182
So be reasonable, Mark.

198
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,516
Go home.

199
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,312
We are so far past reasonable.

200
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,440
Jesus!

201
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,654
Aah!

202
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:58,165
Apart from causing you pain,
the sound also messes up your inner ear.

203
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,668
Which you need for things like flying.

204
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,419
Or walking.

205
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,338
You put a weapon inside me?

206
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,423
With what you can do,

207
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,384
and after what your dad put us through,

208
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:11,053
you're goddamn right I did.

209
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,805
I hoped I'd never have to use it, but--

210
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,890
You said I wasn't my dad.

211
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,934
Did you even believe that?

212
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:19,103
Yes, Mark, and I still do.

213
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,731
So stop being stupid and just...

214
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,025
...come back here.

215
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,528
Track him.

216
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:34,243
The kid's off leash.

217
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,414
I don't want to bring him down
if I don't know where he's going to hit.

218
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,586
Shit.

219
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,715
We can't have them involved.

220
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,014
That sucked.

221
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,810
I still can't believe
we got our asses kicked by Doc Seismic.

222
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,937
At least it wasn't just us.

223
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,814
Could be worse.

224
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,774
We could be stuck
mopping up with the others.

225
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,653
I think we all need a drink after that.

226
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,489
You gonna add a shirt to those pants?

227
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,450
Uh, I don't know. Are you gonna--

228
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:16,494
Oh, you know, wait.

229
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,164
That's the old me.

230
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,958
The new me takes your feedback.

231
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,378
And thanks you
for your constructive criticism.

232
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,714
Before ignoring it complete--

233
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,216
Aah! Holy shit!

234
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,135
Mark?

235
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,179
Rudy, there's a thing in my head.

236
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,264
You got to get it out
before Cecil finds me.

237
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,349
Cecil? I-I don't understand.

238
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,851
Everyone step back.

239
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,186
This has nothing to do with you.

240
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:44,022
He's trying to kill me.

241
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,523
What?

242
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,026
For fuck's sake,
I'm not trying to kill the kid.

243
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,154
But he needs to come with me.

244
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,033
D.A. Sinclair slaughtered students.

245
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,494
Darkwing killed people in cold blood.

246
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,454
Cecil's working with murderers.

247
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,955
You all saw it.

248
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,957
We're not having this argument here.

249
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,210
I'd like to hear
what Invincible has to say.

250
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,337
This isn't a democracy, Bulletproof.

251
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:10,506
You're coming back to the GDA with me.

252
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:11,965
- Now.
- No.

253
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:13,842
I'd never come out again.

254
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,511
Don't be so goddamn dramatic.

255
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,012
I'm not going.

256
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:19,097
I wasn't asking.

257
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,061
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my God!

258
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,230
- What the hell?
- This makes me feel...

259
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:27,689
very uncomfortable.

260
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,741
What are you-- Stop it!

261
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,956
What the actual fuck?

262
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,332
Stand down.

263
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,543
All of you.
I said this doesn't concern you.

264
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:49,962
The hell it doesn't.

265
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:02,724
All of you, sit the fuck down.

266
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,810
Now.

267
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,771
Grab him. We're leaving.

268
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,107
{\an8}Fuck this.

269
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,017
Stop!

270
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:54,152
Huh?

271
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,075
<i>Rex, no.</i>

272
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,331
Goddamn it, Rex!

273
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,668
Why didn't that work?

274
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,128
<i>It had a dead man's switch.</i>

275
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,464
<i>With the control destroyed,
it can't be turned off.</i>

276
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,549
<i>I'm attempting to block the frequency.</i>

277
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,734
Shut 'em down.

278
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,653
Yes, the Reanimen!

279
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,821
All of them. Now!

280
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,915
<i>Frequency blocked.</i>

281
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:03,680
- Huh?
- Huh?

282
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,490
You arrogant

283
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:25,785
little asshole.

284
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,037
Look at this goddamn mess.

285
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,206
Everywhere you go, destruction follows

286
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,000
because of your ego.

287
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:36,670
You're a hypocrite, waltzing off
to help your mass-murdering dad.

288
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,797
But God forbid anyone else screws up

289
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,217
and then tries to make good.

290
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,637
Don't you ever...

291
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,182
ever threaten me again.

292
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,518
As for the rest of you...

293
00:21:56,941 --> 00:22:00,193
I will never work for you again.

294
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,488
We are done. And if you ever come near

295
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,990
my family again...

296
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,910
...I will kill you.

297
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:19,087
Rudy.

298
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,214
Get this fucking thing out of my head.

299
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,841
Now.

300
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,718
<i>Yes.</i>

301
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,345
<i>Of course.</i>

302
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,524
Oh, fuck.

303
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:44,029
He promised me he'd protect you.

304
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,573
After everything that happened with Nolan,

305
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:49,535
he looked me in the eye and he promised.

306
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,704
It's not your fault, Mom.

307
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:55,875
We all trusted Cecil
more than we should have.

308
00:22:57,335 --> 00:22:59,253
These always do the trick for me.

309
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,714
Thanks.

310
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,883
We fight monsters every day,

311
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,511
but I didn't think
Cecil was one of them, too.

312
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,720
He's lost it.

313
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,932
If he went this far,
who knows what he'll do next?

314
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:15,268
I can fight him. I'd kick his ass.

315
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,021
I told Cecil if he goes near you or Oliver

316
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,898
or...

317
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,526
anyone else I care about,

318
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,695
I'd kill him.

319
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,159
Oh, Mark.

320
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:34,204
But why didn't you kill him already?
Then you wouldn't have to worry.

321
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:36,540
- Oliver!
- We don't kill.

322
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,667
But you just said you'd kill Cecil if he--

323
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,628
I had to make sure he took me seriously.

324
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:43,004
That's all.

325
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,840
We don't kill people.

326
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:47,759
Not in this family. Never.

327
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,387
Okay, okay.

328
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,514
But you need help now, right?

329
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,100
I mean, you don't have
all those GDA guys

330
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,434
if you get in trouble.

331
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,687
Now I have powers and everything.

332
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:01,565
I can come help you instead.
Mom said you'd train me!

333
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,443
Training and helping
are two different things.

334
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,949
Mark didn't get his powers
until he was 17.

335
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,618
He got to be a normal kid first.

336
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,954
You deserve that, too.

337
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,205
And get down from there.

338
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,627
Don't be in a rush, Oliver.

339
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,130
Trust me.

340
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:32,429
It doesn't even make sense.

341
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,598
I've known Cecil since I was 14.

342
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:37,727
The first GDA guy who wasn't a total dick.

343
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:40,770
Or so I thought.

344
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,857
Why the hell would he do this?

345
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,317
He's scared of me.

346
00:24:45,318 --> 00:24:47,652
Of what I could become, I guess.

347
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,821
That's such bullshit.

348
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,031
I know you.

349
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,909
You don't hurt people if you can help it.

350
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,120
I mean, Rex has been
asking for it for years,

351
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,581
and you still haven't
thrown him into space.

352
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:03,169
That's me, Mr. Self-Control.

353
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,964
Cecil was right about Angstrom, though.

354
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,718
I didn't mean to kill him, but... I did.

355
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:14,262
Cecil was trying to get under your skin.

356
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,389
You are better off without him.

357
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,059
Thanks.

358
00:25:20,478 --> 00:25:23,104
I know things are weird between us
right now,

359
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:26,192
but it means everything that you're here.

360
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,028
Nah, I-I just thought
Debbie might need my help

361
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,199
if things went bad with Cecil,
especially now that she has your brother.

362
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,534
And...

363
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,120
I was worried about you.

364
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,498
Oh.

365
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,500
What we were talking about earlier,

366
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,212
before Doc Seismic...

367
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,130
What I said, I...

368
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,548
It came out all wrong.

369
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,634
Oh, God. We don't have to
talk about that right now.

370
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,094
If you really think I'd ask you out

371
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:56,805
just because some future version
of you told me to, I--

372
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,724
No, it's not just that. It...

373
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:01,643
It was humiliating.

374
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:05,105
She was from
how many years in the future-- 20?

375
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,941
So, the future me is almost 40 years old

376
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:10,860
and she's still heartbroken
over something that never happened

377
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,404
two decades earlier.

378
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,239
That's who I end up becoming?

379
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,574
She was a different version of you.

380
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,660
Who knows what went on in her life?

381
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:20,705
Still doesn't feel great.

382
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,917
Eve, when I met you,

383
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,961
I thought you were amazing.

384
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:30,214
Like, right away.

385
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,133
But you were with Rex,

386
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,969
so I pushed those feelings down.

387
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,471
Then I started dating Amber
and it was great,

388
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,849
and I fell in love with her, but...

389
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:43,226
what I felt for you...

390
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,479
never totally went away.

391
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,566
A high school crush
isn't enough, Mark.

392
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,484
That's not fair.

393
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:52,986
You know it's more than that.

394
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,906
I don't know. That's the problem.

395
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,745
Uh, I need to think about this.
We both do.

396
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:04,206
I'll always have your back, Mark.

397
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:07,835
And maybe that has to be enough for now.

398
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,805
Shouldn't there be
a clean-up crew for this?

399
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,391
They're not here. We are.

400
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,478
Grab a mop.

401
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:33,319
It's just like
back at the missile base.

402
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:37,656
You don't have to do this, you know.

403
00:27:38,741 --> 00:27:41,368
Cecil spent millions
to put me back together.

404
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,496
Then his dead monsters
tried to rip us apart.

405
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,456
What even are we to him?

406
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,749
We're weapons.

407
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,710
Like his tanks and guns
and all that stuff.

408
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:54,047
Useful until we're not.

409
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:56,007
No kidding.

410
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,717
Cry me a river.

411
00:27:57,718 --> 00:27:59,803
You'll feel better after some honest work.

412
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:02,472
Hang on, man. You weren't even here.

413
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:05,058
Cecil almost killed Mark.

414
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:08,853
Sure. Sounds like Cecil went too far.

415
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,022
But Invincible made him do it
when he broke into the Pentagon

416
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,525
and started tearing shit up.

417
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,902
The kid needs to learn what happens
when you don't think things through.

418
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,113
When exactly was he supposed
to think it through?

419
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:21,199
When Cecil was frying his brain
or when the Franken-bots were killing him?

420
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,702
Mark faced consequences for once. Good.

421
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:29,082
Cecil's always gone soft on him,
just like his father.

422
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,793
Mark's dad almost killed him, you dick.

423
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:35,213
All he had to do was follow orders,
like we all do.

424
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:39,134
But I've seen most of you
not follow orders.

425
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,386
Many times, in fact.

426
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:44,848
We should've never quit Teen Team.

427
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:48,560
Do you even remember
how badly you wanted to be a Guardian?

428
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,020
How hard we all worked to be here?

429
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:54,023
- I died for this.
- And you'll die again.

430
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:57,861
And again and again,
and Cecil will never even care.

431
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,989
Don't lecture me, Rae.

432
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,992
I went through just as much
as you and Rex.

433
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,035
- More, even.
- No, you didn't.

434
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,662
Not anywhere close.

435
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,038
There's only one of me.

436
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,209
I can't go hide a backup copy
of myself away like you can.

437
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,213
Yeah, my powers are different. So?

438
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,592
I also didn't fall apart
the minute I got hurt.

439
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,760
- That's too far, Kate.
- How dare you?

440
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:26,097
Just stop acting like
you're the only one who almost died.

441
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:28,224
I had just as close a call as you did.

442
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,852
This isn't about you, Kate.
It's about Cecil.

443
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,104
Cecil only does what's necessary.

444
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:36,274
So, I suppose it was necessary
to put a bomb in Mark's head?

445
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,901
He just proved it was.

446
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,986
Now get back to work.

447
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:42,280
- That's an order.
- No!

448
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,074
This is bullshit and we don't
have to put up with it anymore.

449
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,160
Cecil doesn't own us.

450
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,955
We can just leave.

451
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,457
Where would we go?

452
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,709
- What was wrong with Teen Team?
- Everything.

453
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,629
At least we didn't try
and assassinate each other.

454
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,006
But I don't believe
that's exactly what happened.

455
00:30:00,007 --> 00:30:02,091
Oh, for the love of God!

456
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:05,887
The Guardians
are the best superheroes in the world!

457
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,848
It's a privilege and an honor
to work here!

458
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,644
Yes, there's hardship!
Yes, there's sacrifice!

459
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:16,148
If you children don't like that, get out!

460
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,568
Ooh, that's a great idea,
because I'd rather quit

461
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,779
than work one more day

462
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,156
with a sanctimonious, bootlicking,

463
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:28,076
hypocritical prick like you!

464
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,540
The door is over there.

465
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:36,084
You heard him.

466
00:30:36,085 --> 00:30:38,127
Who's coming?

467
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,088
You know I am.

468
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,589
- Me too.
- Wait!

469
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,716
Everybody calm down.

470
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,552
If Cecil did that to Mark,

471
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:48,012
who's to say that
he wouldn't do that to all of us?

472
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,806
That's a little extreme.

473
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:52,475
Fuck it. I'm out, too.

474
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:55,020
I can't work for a man I don't trust.

475
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,357
I'm staying.

476
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,534
I'm sorry, Immortal.

477
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,917
Shapesmith? Samson?

478
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:22,547
Cecil let me live
after what I did on Mars,

479
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,924
and m-my bed is a race car,

480
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,177
so, I think Cecil.

481
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,513
I'm gonna go with Cecil.

482
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:36,019
What Cecil did was messed-up,
but I can't fix that from the outside.

483
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,857
You have two hours to leave
before I throw you out myself.

484
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,193
Immortal.

485
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:46,404
Are you sure
you want to leave it like that?

486
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,073
They'll be back.

487
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,911
I don't think so.

488
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,464
Sinclair's not in prison?

489
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,215
I just assumed...

490
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:07,800
He should be.

491
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,886
But Cecil gave him a job instead.

492
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:12,514
That is the most messed-up thing
I've ever heard.

493
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:17,102
So he just does whatever he wants?

494
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:21,815
Makes more of those things?

495
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:30,199
Yeah, I thought we stopped him,
but they just gave him a bigger lab.

496
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:33,493
Uh, maybe I shouldn't have brought it up,

497
00:32:33,494 --> 00:32:36,288
but I thought you deserved to know.

498
00:32:37,373 --> 00:32:41,502
No. It's... it's better to know.

499
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,715
Should I have done more to stop Sinclair?

500
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,179
This isn't your fault.

501
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,597
I could have stopped him forever.

502
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,474
Mark.

503
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,142
He killed a dozen people.

504
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,395
Hurt way more, you two included.

505
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:01,896
He would have deserved it.

506
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:04,232
I've known you
since we were five years old

507
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,777
and that's-- it's just not who you are.

508
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,154
You couldn't have known what would happen.

509
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,448
I should have.

510
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,908
If you killed him,

511
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,077
you'd be just like him.

512
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,874
The world doesn't
need more people like that.

513
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,920
It needs more people like Invincible.

514
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,692
What was that for?

515
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,777
When I tried out for the Guardians,

516
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,904
I didn't really think I'd get in.

517
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,948
For the first few weeks I was here,

518
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,326
it didn't feel real.

519
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:00,121
I guess I was mostly right.

520
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:03,459
The only real part was the people.

521
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:06,294
I don't understand.

522
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,796
I'm trying to say

523
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,842
I'm glad you're coming with us.

524
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,302
Oh.

525
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,345
It-it just made logical sense,

526
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,183
given the reality of the situation.

527
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,316
Just tell the girl you're leaving for her.

528
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,943
Good advice. I'll consider it.

529
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:33,613
But... as much as you like her,

530
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:35,282
there's something else.

531
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,035
I don't know what you mean.

532
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,913
Sure you do.

533
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:45,333
Invincible is the most powerful superhero

534
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,251
- on the planet.
- Hey, now.

535
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:49,504
It's a simple fact. And someday,

536
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:52,090
I might need him on my side.

537
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,385
You always were a cold fish, man.

538
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:58,013
But I'll miss you.

539
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,852
I know, it doesn't
compare to Italy, right?

540
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,730
But this place does make their own pasta.

541
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,525
It's delicious. Really.

542
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:12,902
I actually wasn't sure
this would ever happen.

543
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,195
When you never called me back,

544
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,781
I figured maybe you weren't interested...

545
00:35:16,782 --> 00:35:19,325
Paul, that's not it.

546
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:21,537
Uh, after the gas explosion...

547
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,748
It's embarrassing,
but I was scared to go out for a while.

548
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:28,000
I'd be scared to stay in.

549
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,253
Oh.

550
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,885
Um, so, uh, how is Mark doing?

551
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,428
He's what, 18?

552
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,930
Nineteen.

553
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:43,558
God, the time flies by.

554
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,434
He's at Upstate U., right?

555
00:35:45,435 --> 00:35:49,146
Actually, he's, uh,
trying some other things.

556
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,107
Oh.

557
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,567
Mmm.

558
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:54,360
Well, he's young.

559
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,071
He's got lots of time
to figure things out.

560
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:59,198
It's just been a rough few months.

561
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,826
I get it. Ugh.

562
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,244
My sister's kid

563
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,996
seems like he gets
a ride home from the cops

564
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,163
more often than not.

565
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,582
Oh, oh, no,

566
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,041
it's not like that.

567
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,751
He and Oliver are good kids.

568
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,129
They just have their...

569
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,631
challenges.

570
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:18,301
Are they special needs?
You never mentioned.

571
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,803
Yes. Well, no.

572
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:24,141
Uh, not in the conventional sense,
but they're, um...

573
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:27,727
I'm sorry.

574
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:29,228
I am screwing this up.

575
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:32,899
Can you tell I haven't
been out on a date in 20 years?

576
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,902
If it's all too soon...

577
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,904
No, of course not.

578
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,280
Or...

579
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,700
God, maybe it is. I don't know.

580
00:36:43,035 --> 00:36:44,703
It's okay.

581
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,789
<i>Welcome.</i>

582
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,459
This is Introduction
to Architectural Form.

583
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,711
If that's not what you're here for,

584
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,671
you're in the wrong room.

585
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:57,340
Here, you will learn

586
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:59,592
the fundamentals of construction.

587
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,802
How we make the houses we live in,

588
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,721
the walls we use to protect ourselves,

589
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:06,141
the roofs over our head.

590
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:11,229
It's not as easy as it looks.

591
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,442
Now, let's get started.

592
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,364
So this is it, then.

593
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,450
It's better this way.

594
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,370
We have the Reanimen
on standby if you need backup,

595
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:29,956
and you can hold
try-outs for new members soon.

596
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,917
But I also have another suggestion.

597
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:38,464
Invincible wasn't willing
to give him another chance.

598
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:42,218
I'm hoping that you'll
be more open-minded.

599
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:44,638
I made mistakes, I won't lie.

600
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:48,933
But I'm trying to make up for them.

601
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:52,269
If you'll have me,
I'd be honored to serve.

602
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:01,613
It will be good to have Darkwing
on the Guardians again.

603
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,720
Everything all right, sir?

604
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,139
We'll soldier on.

605
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,725
We always do.

606
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,687
And Darkwing?

607
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,356
What about him?

608
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:43,070
I'm tired, Donald. Just spit it out.

609
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:46,323
He did murder people in Midnight City.

610
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,869
It was one thing calling him in
when we had no other choice.

611
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:52,581
It's another putting him on the Guardians.

612
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,417
People change, Donald.

613
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:59,670
Bad guys reform, good guys
forget what they're fighting for.

614
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,465
It's just...

615
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,717
It's just how it works.

616
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,805
Hmm.

617
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,838
Director Stedman?

618
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,548
Welcome to the GDA.

619
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,259
My name is Donald Ferguson.
I'll be your number one.

620
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,470
May I introduce you to the team?

621
00:39:49,471 --> 00:39:51,722
Knock yourself out.

622
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,307
Good morning, everyone.

623
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,684
This is Director Stedman. As you all know,

624
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,395
he was handpicked by Director Radcliffe,

625
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,856
and I trust you'll show him
the same energy

626
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,691
and respect.

627
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,445
I'm looking forward to working with you.

628
00:40:09,116 --> 00:40:11,283
Wording's all the same.

629
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,244
They're using old reports, Donald.

630
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:16,497
Swapping in a few new sentences,
taking the easy way.

631
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,582
They think because I was in prison
I'm a fuck-up,

632
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:21,336
and that means they can
get away with shit like this.

633
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,131
Uh, they don't know you yet.

634
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,466
Yeah, well, if this doesn't change soon,
they're gonna learn

635
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:29,135
pretty quickly who I really am.

636
00:40:29,136 --> 00:40:31,679
Excuse me, sirs?

637
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,557
There's a situation.

638
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:37,768
No match on our system, sir.

639
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,104
We don't know who this is or...

640
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,064
if they're friendly or not.

641
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,652
Jesus, we better hope he is.

642
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,362
Prep a chopper.

643
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,363
Sir?

644
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:51,365
Someone this powerful,

645
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:54,326
protocol says we send in
the Immortal first.

646
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:55,786
Ask questions later.

647
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,454
We don't know his intentions yet, Donald,

648
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,457
and the Immortal
tends to communicate with his fists.

649
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,585
And, sir, what if he's hostile?

650
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:04,461
Then Christmas comes early

651
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,174
and you all get that new director
you wanted.

652
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,245
Who are you?

653
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:41,583
Cecil Stedman, director
of the Global Defense Agency.

654
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:45,294
We run teams of superheroes
to protect our planet from

655
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,171
whatever dangers might arise.

656
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,632
You don't look like
you're from around here.

657
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:51,926
I'm from the planet Viltrum.

658
00:41:51,927 --> 00:41:53,552
My government sent me here

659
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:56,096
to help protect the people of your world.

660
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:59,100
Huh. They did, did they?

661
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,812
What's your name?

662
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,691
Pupils dilated.
Heart rate elevated.

663
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:09,777
He's an alien, so we don't know his norms,

664
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:11,070
but if he were a human,

665
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,571
he'd be lying.

666
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,198
Yeah, no shit.

667
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,575
All that crap he said about
the World Betterment Committee?

668
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,494
Talk about a fairy tale.

669
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:21,121
You don't get something
for nothing in this universe.

670
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,831
What do we do, sir?

671
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:26,669
Well, he says he wants to help,
so we'll let him help.

672
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,671
- For now.
- Are you sure?

673
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,839
You saw how strong he is.

674
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,299
As long as he saves lives,

675
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,218
I don't give a damn about his motivations.

676
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:38,013
But track his movements, start a file,

677
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:40,474
and get the eggheads
working on countermeasures.

678
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:43,352
We'll figure out why he's really here.

679
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,313
Right away, sir.

680
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,275
<i>Sir?</i>

681
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:51,069
<i>Sir?</i>

682
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,780
Sir, you were saying?

683
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:58,200
Darkwing will be fine, Donald.
Just leave it be.

684
00:42:58,201 --> 00:43:00,495
And Invincible?

685
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,335
We can be the good guys

686
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,755
or we can be the guys that save the world.

687
00:43:11,756 --> 00:43:13,799
We can't be both.

688
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,779
- Hey.
- Hey.

689
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,281
Uh, can we talk?

690
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,991
Uh, sure.

691
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,702
Okay, um...

692
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,245
I-I'm just gonna come out and say it.

693
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:45,414
Uh...

694
00:43:45,415 --> 00:43:48,208
I know you think being friends
or having my back

695
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,419
or whatever is enough for now,

696
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,297
but it's not.

697
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,466
Not for me.

698
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,884
Mark...

699
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:58,677
Just hear me out.

700
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:00,597
When Cecil attacked me...

701
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:04,308
I... I thought I was gonna die.

702
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,185
Oh, my God. That's awful.

703
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:09,271
That-that's not what I'm trying to say.

704
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,564
Um...

705
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,318
When I was lying on the ground

706
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:17,321
with that sound drilling into my head...

707
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:20,366
the only thing I could think about

708
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:23,077
was you.

709
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,413
About how if I died,

710
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,917
I'd never get to see you again.

711
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,795
That's how I know, Eve.

712
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:37,007
That what I feel for you
isn't some stupid crush.

713
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:38,510
It's real.

714
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,930
It's always been real.

715
00:44:44,641 --> 00:44:46,184
Mm.

716
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,070
I need you to be sure.

717
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:00,697
I am. I-I mean it.

718
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,284
I'm an idiot for not realizing it sooner.

719
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:05,411
If you don't want to date me

720
00:45:05,412 --> 00:45:07,204
or you're not interested,

721
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:10,125
I-I can't change that.

722
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,252
But if you feel half as much for me

723
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:16,506
as I do for you, then...

724
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,260
...let's give it a try.

725
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:32,354
Okay.

726
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:33,939
Okay?

727
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,650
Okay.

728
00:45:42,615 --> 00:45:44,658
So are we dating, or what?

729
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,535
Yes!

730
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:49,455
I mean, if you want to.
I-I definitely want to.

731
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:52,082
D-- I-- Uh... okay.
