1
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:13,347
Aah!

2
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:16,058
<i>I noticed the Immortal
wasn't tracking your transformations.</i>

3
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:18,686
<i>It's not his job
to track my transformations.</i>

4
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,770
<i>It's not yours either.</i>

5
00:00:19,854 --> 00:00:20,854
Um...

6
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,190
- You remember Paul?
- Hi.

7
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:26,026
If we had a place of our own,
we could just be together.

8
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,445
Now we just have to figure out

9
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,946
<i>how to afford it.</i>

10
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,698
<i>A superhero. On retainer.</i>

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,909
{\an8}<i>Your power may come
from the stars.</i>

12
00:00:33,993 --> 00:00:36,579
<i>Mine comes from beyond this reality.</i>

13
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,373
<i>Pull up a chair.
I'm cooking you dinner.</i>

14
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,126
<i>- Oliver's gone.
- He made normal friends.</i>

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,962
<i>The way you played me and Liu--</i>

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,423
pure genius. Mwah.

17
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,513
You really didn't need to come
all the way out here for this.

18
00:00:54,597 --> 00:00:57,683
Aw, are you kidding? Ten's a big year.

19
00:00:57,767 --> 00:01:01,270
Becky would have come as well,
but it's too soon for Jack to travel.

20
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,731
Gretch can't wait to meet her cousin.

21
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,611
She looks so carefree.

22
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,322
It's the childhood we never got.

23
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,160
Uncle Scott, hold up your hands again.
I want to do the thing.

24
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,995
Gretchen!

25
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,831
It's okay, Jess.

26
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,082
Here.

27
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,592
So cool.

28
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:32,927
Make a bigger one.

29
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,888
Sorry, kiddo.

30
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,807
That's as big as I can make 'em.

31
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,225
Aw...

32
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,275
I'm gonna grab a coffee before I come up.

33
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:49,527
Want anything?

34
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,237
Nah. I'm good.

35
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,347
No. No!

36
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,474
J-Jessica!

37
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,022
No.

38
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:29,733
No. Jessica...

39
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:36,156
Gretchen!

40
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,084
No.

41
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,170
Jessica.

42
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,967
Gretchen.

43
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,242
District Attorney Barnett.

44
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,579
Sorry to ambush you like this,
but you weren't returning

45
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,165
- my calls or my emails.
- And you are?

46
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,294
Scott Duvall. I've been calling
your office about the Invincible case.

47
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:34,548
Look, I... I sent you the petition
my-my wife and I did.

48
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:37,968
We've gathered over 3,000 signatures,
if you could just look...

49
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:42,181
Mr. Duvall, I'm very busy.
I-I just simply don't have the--

50
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,433
Wait, please.

51
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,144
My sister, Jessica.

52
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:53,359
She, uh, she raised me
after our parents died.

53
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:57,529
She brought an amazing daughter,
Gretchen, into this world.

54
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,616
They both died

55
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,952
in Chicago, and it feels like...

56
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:06,538
Well, it feels like
their deaths don't matter.

57
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,666
Of course they matter.

58
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,001
Then where's the investigation?

59
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,253
And the charges? The trial?

60
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:15,714
It's not just Jessica, okay?

61
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,800
Thousands of people died in Chicago.

62
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:22,221
Why is that murderer
still flying around free?

63
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:26,016
Invincible was defending the planet
from an alien threat.

64
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,645
How do we know that?

65
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,814
Okay? The threat was his own father.

66
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:34,692
If he's so innocent,
then open an investigation.

67
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:37,778
Let a jury decide. Give us justice.

68
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,738
Mr. Duvall,

69
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:44,451
I'm very sorry for your loss,
but there's nothing I can do.

70
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,996
Our laws don't apply
in situations like this.

71
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,458
Test 36.

72
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,085
Charging bio-therm power capacitor now.

73
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,673
Okay, it's at 50% charge

74
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:41,717
and holding.

75
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,137
Complete discharge in three,

76
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,015
two, one.

77
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,369
{\an8}Of course
there's gonna be inventory miscounts.

78
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,829
{\an8}At the pace they're working us?

79
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,707
I guess we can thank V.S. Three for that.

80
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,751
She did kick the crap out of Invincible.

81
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,545
Nah, you saw the tapes.
He stopped fighting.

82
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:21,423
Uh, yeah, I coauthored the report on her.

83
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,925
She still would have won.

84
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,968
It's bullshit.

85
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,638
And what's bullshit now, Scott?

86
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,225
That they accuse us
of making mistakes or losing equipment

87
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,104
while heroes like him
leave thousands dead in their wake.

88
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:38,774
Someone here isn't an Invincible fan.

89
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,359
Scott's not wrong.

90
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,028
I mean, anyone else smashes
their way into the Pentagon,

91
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,489
they're either dead
or locked away for life.

92
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,075
He got to walk out-- no harm, no foul.

93
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,618
Exactly.

94
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,330
Maybe you've all forgotten,
but Invincible is the only real weapon

95
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,999
we've got right now
if more Viltrumites show up.

96
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,503
Till 2A grows up, at least.

97
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,093
- Aah!
- Aah!

98
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:15,144
None of you would eat a dog,
so why is a cow any different?

99
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,438
If I can survive
on an all-plant diet, so can y--

100
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,652
Where'd you even find this guy?

101
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:27,322
Hey, careful!
You got to look out for other people.

102
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:30,075
I did. He didn't hit anyone.

103
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,288
He hates listening to me so much.

104
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,040
Who wants to listen
to their older brother?

105
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,169
Oliver, keep the fight
away from the restaurant.

106
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:44,339
If the place gets trashed,
we can't have burgers after you're done.

107
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:46,550
Got it. Thanks, Eve.

108
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,517
Wait. Are you just using me as a--

109
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,770
Hey! I'm not your training dummy!

110
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,147
Sure you are.

111
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,067
Uh...

112
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:11,200
Next time,
I want to fight someone tougher.

113
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,451
When you're ready.

114
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:15,996
I'm ready now.
I already fought real villains.

115
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,790
Why do I have to fight
lame-os like the Elephant?

116
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:22,169
Dad made me fight the Elephant
a bunch of times, too.

117
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,670
It's good practice.

118
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:26,965
That was before Dad did all that stuff.

119
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:31,386
Ye-Yeah. Before all that.

120
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,141
Will people here ever forgive him?

121
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,690
Oliver, it's... Uh...

122
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:47,027
I know he did a bad thing
trying to take over the world,

123
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,696
but he saved a lot of people
before that, right?

124
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,448
Doesn't that count?

125
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:55,244
Yeah, Dad probably

126
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,704
saved more lives than he took.

127
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:00,290
But those lives don't just
cancel out the others.

128
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,878
So, he never gets to say he's sorry?
He's a bad guy forever?

129
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,964
That's not what Mark's saying.

130
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:10,467
- It's... It, uh...
- But people think that, don't they?

131
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,179
Hey. Can you blame them?

132
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,099
They don't know about Thraxa
or the Viltrum empire

133
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,101
or anything that happened since Dad left.

134
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:24,314
All they know is he tried to take over
and killed a lot of people.

135
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,734
Why don't you tell them, then?
You could make them understand.

136
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,945
Oliver.

137
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,863
What is this really about?

138
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,034
I think, because of my Thraxan side,

139
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,954
I have, like, a really good memory.

140
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:42,541
I can remember everything
from when I was little.

141
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,460
Like my mom hugging me.

142
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,922
And Dad humming songs
and flying me around the palace.

143
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,970
My mom loved Dad, like, a lot.

144
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,221
I know that.

145
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:59,891
And she was awesome, wasn't she?

146
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:03,687
Your mom was really smart and brave.

147
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,189
Then how bad can he be if my mom loved him

148
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,649
and had me with him?

149
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:10,235
Even after Dad did all that bad stuff,

150
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,404
she must have known he was good inside.

151
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:17,159
I still love Dad.

152
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,786
But he was two different people.

153
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,165
<i>One was the dad you and I knew
when we were kids.</i>

154
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,169
<i>But the other was a Viltrumite</i>

155
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,046
<i>who had a mission to do,</i>

156
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,757
even if that meant
hurting a lot of people.

157
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:36,511
So, which one is the real Dad?

158
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,272
Invincible!

159
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:50,150
Where is your remorse?

160
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,613
Have you no shame for what you've done?

161
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,115
The lives you've taken?

162
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,743
You think you're above consequences,

163
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,661
but you are wrong.

164
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:05,374
You will pay for your crimes
against humanity.

165
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:10,420
I, Powerplex, will make you pay!

166
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,756
That was much better this time.

167
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,096
Then I'm ready.

168
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,771
They'll put me on his level.

169
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,857
Let me store enough power to hurt him,

170
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,901
but there's no going back.

171
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,947
I know this is difficult,

172
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,075
but we've tried everything else.

173
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:45,038
Jessica meant everything to me, too.

174
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,477
Keep going.

175
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:12,315
Aah!

176
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,321
Aah!

177
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,324
Aah!

178
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,579
That's all of them.

179
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,790
The hammer.

180
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,305
Again. Harder.

181
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,688
Harder!

182
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,234
Oh!

183
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:25,514
I miss them... so much.

184
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,725
Me too.

185
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,730
We woke up Jack.

186
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,149
I'll go get him.

187
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:37,734
You get changed.

188
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,571
<i>I wouldn't really call it a fight</i>

189
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,740
since I could have knocked him out
in, like,

190
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,369
one second, but Mark and Eve
say I need to learn the basics,

191
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,247
except I already
learned the basics ages ago.

192
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,915
Ow!

193
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,793
Sure. But you didn't
see that coming, did you?

194
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,879
Eve.

195
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,131
Mark was bragging about you the other day.

196
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,801
He said you aced your last test at school.

197
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,262
Well, I only got an 84,

198
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,556
so I didn't exactly ace it.

199
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,142
Oh, come on, it sounds like
you're doing well in your courses.

200
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,186
Thanks.

201
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,272
I haven't had much time to enjoy it.

202
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,775
Midterms are coming up,
so my stress levels are... Oof.

203
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,611
I'm sure you'll do fine.

204
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:25,240
Since Mark dropped out,
I need college updates from someone.

205
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,160
Dinner's delicious, Paul.
Thanks for cooking.

206
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,997
Oh, it was nothing.
Family spaghetti recipe,

207
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,165
easy to whip up.

208
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:38,003
So, your mom tells me
you and Eve started a business.

209
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,255
How does that work?

210
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,675
It was Eve's idea.

211
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,428
Um, w-we're on retainer
at Payton Penitentiary,

212
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:49,014
so if they have a breakout
or an attack or something,

213
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,765
they call us for help,

214
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,076
but it's been pretty quiet recently.

215
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,369
I think the last job we did there

216
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,646
convinced everyone to back off.

217
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,732
Ah, so your reputation

218
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,067
does the work for you.

219
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:03,194
You know, when I started in real estate,

220
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,197
there was a bit of a turf war going on
in this high-end neighborhood,

221
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:10,160
but after I went door to door
and introduced myself to the entire place,

222
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,163
I was the only agent
anyone would work with.

223
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,248
It's all about reputation, right?

224
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,585
Yeah, you get it. You know what I mean.

225
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,798
Oh, God.

226
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:29,346
I hated myself as soon as I said it.

227
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,264
Like real estate and superhero-ing

228
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,267
are even in the same universe.

229
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:36,728
Paul, it's fine.

230
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,148
Just because we aren't saving the world
doesn't mean our jobs aren't important.

231
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:43,234
- But they're not the same thing.
- Maybe,

232
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,362
but our lives are still meaningful.

233
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,155
And Mark knows that.

234
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,865
Besides,

235
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,825
it's good for all three of them to realize

236
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:54,496
there's a world out there
that's not just aliens and supervillains.

237
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,292
Debbie, are you sure I'm cut out for this?

238
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:00,960
Are you saying...

239
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,713
No, God, no. I want to be with you.

240
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm just... I'm not sure how I fit in.

241
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,052
Mark and Oliver are great kids,

242
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,763
but how can I relate to them?

243
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,265
They save the world.

244
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:17,143
I can't measure up to that.

245
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,356
No one is asking you
to be their dad, Paul.

246
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,401
It's not about measuring up,
it's about showing up.

247
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,736
And as long as you're here,
that's what matters.

248
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,365
You're incredible, you know that?

249
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,492
Come here.

250
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,202
Ooh!

251
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,371
Let me help you with that.

252
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,082
- Hey, let go!
- What have I said about flying in the house?

253
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,849
Shh...

254
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,642
Stay calm.

255
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,227
♪ <i> I couldn't...</i>

256
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,813
Shh.

257
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,899
You can do this.

258
00:17:04,983 --> 00:17:06,651
♪ <i>I made it...</i>

259
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,946
Oh, fuck.

260
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,782
Do it for Jess and Gretchen.

261
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:15,535

00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,038

Yes!

265
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,607
I know it's not Thanksgiving,

266
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,486
but this guy just brought the turkey.

267
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,154
Ouch.

268
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,573
But nice!

269
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,326
Wow. You weren't kidding.
He really is that good.

270
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,288
Yeah. Remind me why I'm letting William
humiliate me like this again?

271
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,540
It's his birthday. He gets to pick.

272
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:06,044
And you're all giving me
the perfect birthday gift,

273
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,962
which is the look on your faces

274
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:11,508
as I beat you over and over again.

275
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:14,511
- Ka-pow!
- William.

276
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,014
Oh.

277
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,351
Oh, relax. She's a good friend,
we go to yoga twice a week,

278
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,186
and you're both adults.

279
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,480
Well, Amber is, at least.

280
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,650
Mark.

281
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,528
Amber. How's it going?

282
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:36,115
Hey, man.

283
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,494
Mark, this is Kyle. Kyle, Mark.

284
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,162
Uh, nice to meet you.

285
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,539
Same.

286
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,292
Wait... You read <i>Séance Dog?</i>

287
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:48,127
Yeah. Do you?

288
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,088
Since I was 12.

289
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,799
But you really didn't get it
until you were older.

290
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,385
Exactly, because it's got
so many levels to it.

291
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,263
Uh, i-it's an underrated book,
in my opinion.

292
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,014
Why are more people
not saying that?

293
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,267
I guess I have a type.

294
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,227
Mm, I guess you do.

295
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,437
Less talking, more bowling.

296
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:10,233
This shark's got the taste of blood
in his mouth and he's hungry for more.

297
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,819
Let's go. Shoes on, people.

298
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,285
- Thanks.
- Need a hand?

299
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,204
Uh... sure.

300
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,583
So, Kyle.

301
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,752
So, Eve.

302
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:31,838
Yeah.

303
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,636
I mean, we're both smiling, so...

304
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,722
things must be okay.

305
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,807
I'm happy for you.

306
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,518
Thanks. I'm happy for you, too.

307
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:49,314
Take it easy on Kyle bowling, okay?

308
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,691
No superpowers.

309
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,610
I'm really not the threat here.

310
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,612
W-What's up?

311
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,158
I don't know. Some crazy supervillain's
freaking out downtown.

312
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,204
{\an8}<i>Get back!</i>

313
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:07,123
{\an8}<i>I don't want to hurt anyone.</i>

314
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,250
{\an8}<i>All I want is In--</i>

315
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,840
Come on, are we here to celebrate
William's birthday or not?

316
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:23,139
What? I can take a night off.

317
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,851
You know there's other heroes
out there, right?

318
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,357
Oh.

319
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,779
You're not listening!

320
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:40,156
This isn't about me!

321
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,826
This is about the thousands of people--

322
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,871
...murdered,
and the countless other lives--

323
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,539
...destroyed!

324
00:20:48,623 --> 00:20:50,333
Why is--

325
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,044
...above the law?

326
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,587
Why does--

327
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,675
...never pay for his crimes?

328
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,009
Where is--

329
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,719
...when people are trying

330
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,931
to put their world back together?!

331
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,475
Okay, buddy, we hear you.

332
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,143
So, what do you want?

333
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,690
What do I want?

334
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,234
I want...

335
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,695
I want the truth.

336
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,030
I want justice!

337
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,533
I want--

338
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,623
I want things, too.

339
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,626
And sometimes I don't get them.

340
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,545
So I understand why you're upset.

341
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,464
You want things, but you don't have them.

342
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:42,802
It's an emotion that connects
all living beings throughout the universe.

343
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,263
What? Who are you?

344
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:48,433
Oh, you know who I am.

345
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,770
Oh, you don't?

346
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,440
What, you don't recognize
this part of my head?

347
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,151
Or the costume that I fabricate
from my own body tissues

348
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:02,113
that appears to be clothing,
but is very much not clothing?

349
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,075
I'm Shapesmith,

350
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,953
beloved member
of the Guardians of the Globe.

351
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:11,539
Defeater of evil
and friend to small animals--

352
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:13,791
but not cats-- everywhere.

353
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,629
I don't want to fight you.

354
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,089
I want Invincible.

355
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,424
Oh.

356
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,010
That's why you said his name
so many times earlier.

357
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:26,512
Well, it's a little hurtful, but...

358
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:28,222
Ta-da!

359
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:29,724
Is this better?

360
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:33,728
No! Get me the real Invincible!

361
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,567
Since you're getting a little upset,
and there's lightning...

362
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,070
...how about
we take you to prison

363
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:45,073
and maybe Invincible can visit you there?

364
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,783
Look, I--

365
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,368
I don't want to fight you.

366
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,245
I only want Invincible.

367
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,998
This is your last warning.

368
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,876
And this is your second punch.

369
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,912
Yeah, we need backup.

370
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:35,540
The Powerplex guy just killed...

371
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,542
one of the Guardians of the Globe.

372
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,547
I... I... I warned him.

373
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,383
I said I didn't want to fight.

374
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:47,051
He attacked me!

375
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:50,012
You saw what happened.

376
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,438
Shapesmith.

377
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:01,983
My name is Shapesmith.

378
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,074
Nothing. We're okay.

379
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,078
I messed it all up.

380
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,124
No, you didn't.
They didn't follow you home.

381
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:20,918
- We can try again.
- They know, Becky.

382
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:24,839
The GDA knows one of us
in the lab stole the discs

383
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,632
and they'll figure out it was me.

384
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:29,468
We've got a few days at most
before they're here.

385
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:32,847
Why didn't Invincible show up?

386
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,474
I was on the news. He would have seen me.

387
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,520
Facing you in front of all those cameras
would have proved your point.

388
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,108
Then we're finished.

389
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:47,570
He'll never face justice
for Jessica and Gretchen

390
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,071
and all the others.

391
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,573
Don't give up yet.

392
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:53,576
Did you forget what's happening
in a few days?

393
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:59,332
I was so focused on tonight's plan,
the memorial slipped my mind.

394
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,293
God.

395
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,337
How could I forget?

396
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,214
What kind of brother am I?

397
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:15,598
Oh, Jack. Jack, Jack...

398
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:17,350
Oh, Daddy's sorry.

399
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:20,102
He didn't mean to scare you.

400
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,730
Hey, Jack. Jack...

401
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,651
How many speeches
do you think they'll make

402
00:25:26,734 --> 00:25:28,486
in Invincible's honor tomorrow?

403
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,405
He'll be there.

404
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:35,243
<i>Mm-mmm. Don't sit.</i>

405
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:36,827
We're supposed to leave any minute.

406
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,747
Fine.

407
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,667
Should I even be going today?

408
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,168
Why would you say that?

409
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:47,672
I don't know.
This is for the victims of what happened.

410
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:49,173
Feels like I'm imposing.

411
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:53,636
You're not going as Invincible today,
you're going as Mark Grayson.

412
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,013
And whether you admit it or not,

413
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,974
you were a victim, too.

414
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,434
Mm.

415
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,061
Debbie!

416
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:03,521
We're gonna be late.

417
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,147
Oh, hi, Eve.

418
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:08,609
Uh, hey, you know,
I know you guys said not to worry,

419
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:12,196
but we're supposed to be
in Chicago in 30 minutes.

420
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,992
If we're teleporting or something,
I-I have to say...

421
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,536
that might be a bit much for me.

422
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:20,788
Don't worry, Paul,
we're taking the car.

423
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:22,373
Oh, thank God.

424
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:25,209
Wait...

425
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,169
Uh...

426
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,967
Get in the car before your makeup
comes off or you lose your tie.

427
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,969
I won't lose it.

428
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,929
Oliver.

429
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,685
Oh, my God!

430
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,729
Uh, Oliver, Oliv-- Please, do it for me.

431
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,399

But you're not gonna tell me
what this is about yet?

450
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,544
It's a surprise.

451
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:54,215
Most surprises aren't so... this.

452
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,841
Okay.

453
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,135
We're ready.

454
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,679
Great. For what?

455
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,890
For you to transform.

456
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:06,936
Uh, you're always the one telling me
and everyone else

457
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,648
that I need to limit my transformations
to life-or-death situations.

458
00:28:10,731 --> 00:28:14,276
This is a life-or-death situation.

459
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,445
Please. Trust me.

460
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,406
And stay within the sensors.

461
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:30,626
Good. Now change back.

462
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,716
Cells are approximately
24 hours younger than reference.

463
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,678
Yeah, tell me something I didn't kn...

464
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,763
What's that?

465
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,349
Lost time, I hope.

466
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,687
All these weeks,
you've been working on a belt?

467
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,189
It's an advanced genomic engine, actually.

468
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:55,651
Miniaturized, hardened
and built around a fusion battery core.

469
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,570
It has to be close to you to work,

470
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:01,824
so it either had to be
either a hat, a sash or... a belt.

471
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,326
I thought a belt was the least strange.

472
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,203
Well, what does it do?

473
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,621
Put it on.

474
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,459
{\an8}Whoa.

475
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,919
{\an8}The magic curse
that is the source of your power

476
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,838
{\an8}has a bug in it.

477
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,257
Either intentional or not,

478
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,801
when you transform
back to your human state,

479
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,971
it rebuilds you
with an incorrect temporal offset,

480
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:27,641
resulting in you getting younger
each time you use your powers.

481
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,643
This belt corrects that

482
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,647
by making a digital copy
of certain cells before you transform.

483
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:36,442
Then fools the curse
into using that reference

484
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:39,278
for your transformation back to human.

485
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:40,946
Monster, please.

486
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,413
Now back.

487
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,044
That felt...

488
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,129
strange.

489
00:29:57,213 --> 00:30:00,174
Not bad strange, but strange.

490
00:30:00,257 --> 00:30:02,176
Now the moment of truth.

491
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:06,263
No de-aging detected.

492
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,683
Wait.

493
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:11,602
Does that mean...

494
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,145
It worked.

495
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,231
I-I thought maybe
I'd need to fine-tune the--

496
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,070
Oh!

497
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:24,740
But I-I'm not trying to fix you, Amanda.

498
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,243
You're perfect the way you are,

499
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,954
and... and if you don't wish
to use this device,

500
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,789
I'll-I'll never bring it up again.

501
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,874
- Rudy.
- Yes?

502
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:36,460
Thank you.

503
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,025
- Rex?
- Hmm?

504
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,986
You, uh, got a minute?

505
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:07,700
I was literally about to come find you.

506
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,289
- So...
- So.

507
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,335
Dinner the other night.

508
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:19,962
I'm not crazy, right?

509
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,172
There was a... thing between us?

510
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,924
I don't want to say it was magical,

511
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:25,443
because magic scares the shit out of me,

512
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,304
but, like, half-magical?

513
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,932
- Yeah.
- Ah, I knew it.

514
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:34,351
You felt it, too.

515
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,061
But, uh, that's not why I'm here.

516
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:38,314
Uh-- Uh... oh.

517
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,858
Well, then I'm confused.

518
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,027
Why are you here?

519
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,447
Because I'm quitting, Rex.

520
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,866
You're what?!

521
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:16,727
Thank you all for coming.

522
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,064
We never knew that our streets,

523
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,107
our city, our lives,

524
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:26,528
our world would change so fundamentally

525
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,531
on this spot, not so long ago.

526
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:31,617
Does everyone here hate Dad?

527
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,911
Oliver, it's not--

528
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:42,461
Give me the microphone.

529
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,090
- Aah!
- Steven Park.

530
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,383
Amal Shahir.

531
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,259
Elizabeth Volpe.

532
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:51,470
Dominique Bassett.

533
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:53,514
Joshua Saltzman.

534
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:55,641
Michael Kuzmic.

535
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:59,353
Jessica and Gretchen Duvall.

536
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,399
These are just some

537
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:07,736
of the 2,341 people

538
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,072
who were murdered here

539
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:13,826
by Omni-man and his son.

540
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,246
Invincible!

541
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:21,250
Your father may have fled,
but I know you're here!

542
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,752
Come and face justice

543
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,171
for the lives you've taken!

544
00:33:26,255 --> 00:33:30,134
Come and face... Powerplex!

545
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,723
You go. Get to safety.

546
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,474
- I'm gonna just--
- Let me handle this.

547
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,729
- Wait a second.
- Eve's right.

548
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,564
- That man is disturbed.
- You coward!

549
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,149
You'll only make things worse.

550
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,650
I'm right here!

551
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,571
This isn't about you today,

552
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:53,490
so let's calm down
before anyone gets hurt.

553
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,909
If you protect Invincible,

554
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:58,662
you're as guilty as he is.

555
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,789
Okay. You're coming with me.

556
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:11,967
No. I am not going anywhere

557
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,304
until I get justice.

558
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:16,847
Oh!

559
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,767
Give her more credit than that.

560
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:30,027
You need help, not a fight.

561
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,738
And I figured out
you get stronger when I hit you.

562
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,012
You guys can take it from here.

563
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,517
Oh! Hey!

564
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,727
You're that very angry man
from the other night.

565
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:07,105
Did you ever find Invincible?

566
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,292
Where are you taking me?

567
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:30,295
Somewhere you can't
hurt anyone else, sparky.

568
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:32,381
I didn't hurt anyone.

569
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,509
Yeah, 'cause
you got your ass beat first.

570
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:55,445
Hey! Stop it.

571
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:58,490
I said stop it
or we'll make you stop.

572
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,619
Jesus.

573
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,956
Okay, you asked for it, pal.

574
00:36:54,004 --> 00:36:55,631
Here.

575
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,550
In case you want to leave something.

576
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,928
Thanks.

577
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:03,055
For everything.

578
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,099
I can't imagine doing this without you.

579
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:09,770
That's why we have each other.

580
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:13,690
I never really
thought about all these people.

581
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,859
I mean, I thought about them, but...

582
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,239
...seeing the names,
everyone here for the event, all this.

583
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,826
It's, like, so much more than I thought.

584
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,578
Yeah.

585
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:29,831
Cecil kept me sheltered from all this.

586
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:32,960
I guess that was the one advantage
to working with him.

587
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,837
But shouldn't I be seeing stuff like this?

588
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:39,049
Shouldn't we really understand
the consequences of what we do?

589
00:37:39,132 --> 00:37:42,886
- That guy today--
- Mark, he was unwell.

590
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,516
But maybe that's because of what
my dad and I did to someone he loved.

591
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,103
So, if he had hurt people here today,

592
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,605
wouldn't that still be my fault?

593
00:37:56,692 --> 00:37:59,736
<i>Of all the times to quit,</i>

594
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,281
why did it have to be
when we were just about to start dating?

595
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:06,201
You've joked a hundred times
about quitting.

596
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,079
About opening a bar or-or buying a farm

597
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:12,416
or getting a job somewhere where people
aren't trying to kill you every day.

598
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,292
Those... those are jokes.

599
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:15,961
Like you just said.

600
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,921
- Were they?
- Oh, sure.

601
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:22,009
Let's quit being superheroes
and just be nobodies.

602
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,677
Sounds awesome.

603
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,305
We wouldn't be nobodies to us.

604
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,394
Rae...

605
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,354
I don't know.

606
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,648
Oh, I don't want to spend
my last night here

607
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,525
cooped up in your room fighting.

608
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,036
I'll miss this view.

609
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,122
You're asking me to throw
my whole life away. You get that, right?

610
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:56,168
I'm asking you to think about
what you want your life to be,

611
00:38:56,251 --> 00:39:00,088
and maybe that it doesn't have to be
just this until we both get killed.

612
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:01,798
You got shot in the head.

613
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:05,302
I spent months in the hospital
after a lizard man tried to eat me.

614
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:08,722
I don't want to go back out there
and just wait for it to happen again.

615
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,807
Because it's going to happen again.

616
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:13,769
Except next time, we might not make it.

617
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,688
I've done my part.

618
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:20,525
Now I want to take a risk
on something different. On me.

619
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,320
And... and maybe you.

620
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:27,532
Uh, and what-- this-this all
just came to you now?

621
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:31,244
I had a lot of time to think while
my bones knitted themselves back together.

622
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,418
Are you happy, Rex?

623
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,712
Uh, am I happy?

624
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,631
What does that even mean?

625
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:45,592
Are you happy almost dying
over and over again

626
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,386
so other people
can live the lives we never get?

627
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:52,057
Uh... uh, I don't get to be happy.

628
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,351
That's just the way it is.

629
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,024
You deserve better.

630
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,236
Do you know what my last name is?

631
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,154
My real last name?

632
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:07,989
No.

633
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,867
It's Sloan.

634
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:14,287
The government changed it
when they bought me from my parents.

635
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:17,374
Then they erased everything else about me

636
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,459
when they made me into this.

637
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:26,550
Rex Splode isn't some secret identity.

638
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:30,220
It is my identity. It's all I've got.

639
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,264
All I've ever had.

640
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:36,810
If I give that up,
I won't have anything left.

641
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:40,272
I don't think that's true.

642
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,732
Yeah, well...

643
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:45,944
Then I guess you don't know me
as well as you think you do.

644
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,116
I'm still leaving.

645
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:57,831
Yeah.

646
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:00,125
I know.

647
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,767
<i>It's over.</i>

648
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,106
I failed.

649
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,775
We'll come up with something.
There's still time.

650
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,903
We're out of time!

651
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,910
The GDA will be here any minute.

652
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:39,748
I'm not gonna fight them,
but you and Jack should go.

653
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,668
No.

654
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,712
This isn't over yet.

655
00:41:50,717 --> 00:41:53,261
Cecil would have my head
if he knew about this.

656
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,430
I appreciate it, Donald.

657
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,766
This is everything we have on Powerplex.

658
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,893
His real name is Scott Duvall.

659
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,437
Until today, he was a researcher
in one of our labs,

660
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,941
which is how he got his hands on
an experimental power storage technology.

661
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:09,903
It enhances what seems to be
a low-level energy absorption superpower,

662
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,488
making him quite dangerous.

663
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:15,242
He lost his sister and niece
in the Chicago incident.

664
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,910
We raided his house an hour ago.

665
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,663
Apparently, he's been
tracking you for months.

666
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:23,166
Well, at least I know
who was sending those orbs after me.

667
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,876
I'm afraid those weren't his.

668
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,630
Cecil was telling you the truth
when he said they weren't GDA technology.

669
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,632
Ah. Great.

670
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:35,053
I know you've already done a lot,
but I'd like to meet Scott.

671
00:42:35,136 --> 00:42:37,430
I don't want him hurting anyone else
because of me.

672
00:42:37,514 --> 00:42:40,976
This is awkward, but, um,

673
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:43,979
he escaped as we were transporting him
to Payton Penitentiary.

674
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,855
- What?
- Don't worry.

675
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,400
We'll have him back
in custody before he can...

676
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,029
Oh, no.

677
00:42:53,113 --> 00:42:54,739
Invincible!

678
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:58,285
I tried to keep this between us.
Between you--

679
00:42:58,368 --> 00:43:01,663
the killer-- and me--

680
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,125
the man who will finally
bring you to justice.

681
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:10,547
But I didn't think your cowardice
would run so deep.

682
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,967
So I took a page from your book.

683
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:16,886
I hope the life of an innocent woman

684
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,516
is enough to motivate you
to do the right thing.

685
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,810
And if it's not...

686
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,734
{\an8}I'm sorry, Jack.

687
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,611
{\an8}Jack, I'm so sorry.

688
00:43:33,695 --> 00:43:36,406
{\an8}Careful. Go slow.

689
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:43,038
Remember, they have to believe
I kidnapped you.

690
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,373
It's... it's the only way.

691
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,334
All right.

692
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,461
Once the heat's died down,

693
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:51,421
I'll find you, 'kay?

694
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,923
Just... stay safe.

695
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,344
You want me?

696
00:43:57,427 --> 00:44:00,680
Here I am.

697
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,144
Just let them go.

698
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,313
Jessica Duvall.

699
00:44:08,396 --> 00:44:10,357
Do you know that name?

700
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,779
How about Gretchen Duvall?

701
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:17,113
Huh?

702
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:19,908
I know they were
your sister and niece, Scott.

703
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,995
I know this is where they lived.

704
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,791
And I know they were killed in Chicago,
along with so many other people,

705
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:30,126
when my dad and I fought here.

706
00:44:34,714 --> 00:44:37,175
I can't imagine what you went through

707
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,469
or the pain you're feeling.

708
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,430
And for that, I'm so sorry.

709
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,392
But hurting other people
won't bring your sister and niece back.

710
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:53,900
You don't get to lecture me
about hurting people.

711
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,123
I know how your powers work.

712
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,374
I'm not gonna fight you.

713
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,584
Why do you get to live

714
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:13,753
when so many others died?

715
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:17,424
What makes you so special?

716
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,717
Stop. Please.

717
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,344
Not until you

718
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:23,847
stop breathing.

719
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,356
This is just a fraction of the pain

720
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,774
I felt when you

721
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:37,485
murdered my sister!

722
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,028
You're gonna get them killed!

723
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,198
You're the one who kills innocent people.

724
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:46,035
I'm just making sure
you can't ever do it again.

725
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:51,082
I'm warning you.

726
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:53,418
Or what-- you'll kill me

727
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,128
like you killed everyone else?

728
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,011
I'm sorry.
I'm getting these people out of here.

729
00:46:05,346 --> 00:46:06,681
Aah!

730
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,394
Stay there.
I'll help you in a second.

731
00:46:11,478 --> 00:46:13,855
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

732
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,773
What the hell?

733
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,901
You're a monster!

734
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,277
For the pain you've caused.

735
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,654
For the lives you've taken.

736
00:46:21,738 --> 00:46:24,324
For everything you've done.

737
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,494
Die!

738
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,708
Scott!

739
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,584
No!

740
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,048
Oh, God.

741
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:33,309
No. Scott, wait.

742
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,691
Stop! Please!

743
00:47:57,083 --> 00:48:00,545
This is all your fault!

744
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:26,446
We can't remove the discs
without killing him,

745
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:28,990
so rehabilitation will be...

746
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:30,742
difficult.

747
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,708
But trust me when I say we'll make sure

748
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:41,919
something like this never happens again.

749
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:43,755
It wasn't your fault.

750
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:46,529
Could I get a moment alone with him?

751
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:51,888
Scott.

752
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:59,729
I remember them.

753
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,481
Jessica and Gretchen.

754
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:05,485
{\an8}I didn't know their names before,
but I remember them.

755
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:09,447
Things changed for me after Chicago.

756
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,533
At first,

757
00:49:12,617 --> 00:49:15,036
all I could think of
were the people I couldn't save.

758
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:17,914
But...

759
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:21,250
that made me bad at being able
to save the ones I could.

760
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:25,129
So I buried those feelings away.

761
00:49:26,756 --> 00:49:28,883
I think that was a mistake now.

762
00:49:31,052 --> 00:49:33,012
I hope that's a comfort to you.

763
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,765
Comfort?

764
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,267
My sister and niece are dead.

765
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:43,189
My wife and child are dead.

766
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:47,443
Thousands more are dead

767
00:49:47,527 --> 00:49:49,696
all because of you.

768
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,199
And you think the fact that

769
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:55,410
you remember them--

770
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:58,663
that now you're sad about it--

771
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,123
gives me comfort?

772
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:03,376
No. No, that's... not what I--

773
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:07,130
Sooner or later,
I'll find my way free.

774
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,800
And then I will find you.

775
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:26,274
Mark.

776
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:27,900
Been looking all over for you.

777
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,780
I thought... you might want to talk.

778
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,037
Ah.

779
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,581
This will do.
