1
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:06,673
<i>There's
an infinite number of dimensions.</i>

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:11,010
<i>I was born with the ability
to access all of them.</i>

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,471
I won't build my utopia

4
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,140
<i>with blood.</i>

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,726
I need to make him pay!

6
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:20,270
<i>Darkwing was at
my 12th birthday party,</i>

7
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,147
<i>so I'm pretty sure
he doesn't kill people.</i>

8
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:25,275
<i>Mark isn't like other Viltrumites.</i>

9
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:27,444
<i>He just wants to protect his world.</i>

10
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>Bring Invincible here.</i>

11
00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:31,239
<i>He is the key.</i>

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,032
This child is Mark's brother.

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,617
Which makes him family to me too.

14
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,703
<i>Viltrum knows I've left my post.</i>

15
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:40,331
They'll see your brother
as inferior and kill him.

16
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>Your father will be executed.</i>

17
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:45,420
<i>You will assume his mission
and prepare the planet for our rule.</i>

18
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,881
<i>I'm sorry I gambled with your life.</i>

19
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:50,759
Shit! You're a Viltrumite?!

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,470
I think everything in these books is real.

21
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:56,431
<i>Stuff that can hurt Viltrumites.</i>

22
00:00:58,768 --> 00:01:01,978
You shot me in the fucking head!

23
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,355
<i>I've died 39 times even though</i>

24
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,107
<i>there was less of me to save each time.</i>

25
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,526
Come with me now,
or this woman dies.

26
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:11,863
<i>How many of my new Reanimen are
ready for the field right now?</i>

27
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,364
Answer the goddamn question.

28
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,116
<i>Killing you is not my task.</i>

29
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,076
<i>Soon another will come.</i>

30
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,620
How does this work, Mark?

31
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,206
- I don't know.
- Maybe that's an answer.

32
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:23,666
You think you're innocent in all this?

33
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>I'll never let anyone</i>

34
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,254
ever hurt my family!

35
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,423
<i>I have to learn how to control myself.</i>

36
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,467
- <i>Remember me?</i>
<i>- Why are you here?</i>

37
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:33,718
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

38
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,512
Eve, is that you?

39
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:36,846
Not the me you know.

40
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:39,307
Tell her you love her,

41
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,935
<i>or tell her you don't love her,
just tell her something.</i>

42
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:46,273
I think... I miss my wife.

43
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,130
You can do better than that.

44
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,718
I'm gonna hurt you so bad.

45
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,535
Oh!

46
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,996
I did it.

47
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,998
I did it!

48
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,710
I win! I win! I--

49
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,131
That's the second time
you celebrated too soon.

50
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,231
You okay?

51
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:13,234
No! You're mean!

52
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,445
Okay.

53
00:03:15,446 --> 00:03:17,196
All right, let's give the kid a break.

54
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,741
He's been a champ,
but his parents are getting worried.

55
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,451
He's only eight, after all.

56
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,870
The GDA thanks you and your son
for your assistance.

57
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,165
And we assure you, we're still searching
for a cure for his condition.

58
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,253
Then what's next?

59
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,893
Whew! Ah, geez!

60
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,145
Aah.

61
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,606
Seven minutes, 42 seconds.

62
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:52,899
A new record.

63
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,192
Nice work.

64
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,069
<i>Hey, can somebody call Art?</i>

65
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,447
<i>I'm gonna need like 20 new costumes
if we're gonna keep doing this.</i>

66
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:13,836

67
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,547

<i>♪ Can't breathe, ah...</i>

69
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,056
<i>♪ Can't ♪</i>

70
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:32,355
I could have...

71
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,274
I could have done it faster,
but I got lost on the way back again.

72
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,696
Well, it was still plenty fast, Mark.

73
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,406
<i>♪ To the Jacques Cousteau to the depths ♪</i>

74
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:43,408
<i>♪ And you're wet,

75
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,619
<i>♪ Send your body to flight,

76
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,580

00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,625

78
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:55,003
<i>♪ Feel the weight

79
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,046

00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:58,756
<i>♪ You used to make

81
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,634
And...

82
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,970
...good.

83
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:12,186
So that was
the heaviest thing we could find

84
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,023
for Mark to lift, and he just lifted it.

85
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,650
Come on, Donald, since when
do we let a little thing like that

86
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,694
stop us from saving the world?

87
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,238
When we're through with him...

88
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,157
<i>♪ Go...</i>

89
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,950
...he'll finally live up to the name--

90
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:35,918
Over the last 90 days,
Mark's speed has increased 65%,

91
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,421
his endurance 70%,

92
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,214
and his strength--

93
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,258
and we checked this wasn't a mistake--

94
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,719
138%.

95
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:48,891
The science team is
already working on a heavier version.

96
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,518
So the billion-dollar question, then:

97
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,645
Could he beat that Viltrumite woman

98
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,482
who made us all shit our pants
three months ago?

99
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,650
We think so.

100
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:03,112
But she implied
someone much worse was coming.

101
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,032
Which is why we're not stopping here.

102
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,326
With Mark or any of our other plans.

103
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,244
Fuck me!

104
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,164
Way to make
a fellow superhero feel inadequate.

105
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,541
Glad it's not leg day.

106
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,378
Hey, Rex.

107
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,923
Yeah, Cecil's got me on a training plan.

108
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,758
Uh, yeah.

109
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,176
I can see that.

110
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,763
So, um, how much did all this cost, Cecil?

111
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:32,767
Is this why the coffeemaker's
still broken at Guardians HQ?

112
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,685
We bought you a new hand, Rex.

113
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:36,771
- That wasn't cheap.
- Yeah.

114
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:40,358
And this is the third time I've been back
trying to get it adjusted.

115
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:44,195
Eh, look, I'm trying to give you
the finger right now and I can't.

116
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,322
Oh, man, that's your favorite finger.

117
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,116
It's my favorite finger.

118
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,992
It's his favorite finger, Cecil.

119
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,702
Can't we do something about that?

120
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,329
Uh-huh.

121
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,458
The customer service
in this place is terrible.

122
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,752
Sir, believe it or not,

123
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:03,047
but somebody appears to be stealing
the Declaration of Independence

124
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,715
from the National Archives building.

125
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,551
One guess who's behind that.

126
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,512
Nah, can't be Doc Seismic.

127
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:11,514
<i>He's still under lock and key.</i>

128
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,725
You feel like trying out
those new muscles of yours?

129
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,727
- Sure.
- Wow.

130
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:19,438
I am standing right here.

131
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,191
You guys could at least pretend
like you'd like my help.

132
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,734
Maybe I should take Rex.

133
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,403
Who knows how tough this could be?

134
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,072
And there might be stuff
that needs to be exploded.

135
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,200
Fine, take Rex.

136
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,245
You both suck.

137
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,880
National Archives building. Washington.

138
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,470
No problem, you said.

139
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,514
I can disarm the lasers, you said.

140
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,141
Now we're messing up the past.

141
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,684
Technology this old is tricky.

142
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,060
It's practically made of wood.

143
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,645
- Hey!
- But it's not made out of wood.

144
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,439
It's made out of circuits

145
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,775
and electricity and stuff
you're supposed to be good at.

146
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,653
Relax! We've got at least three minutes

147
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,698
- until the police show up.
- Hey, dickheads!

148
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,119
Boy, did you pick the wrong day to steal
a timeless piece of America's history.

149
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,289
Well, not that there's a right day.

150
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,665
But you know what I mean.

151
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,793
Uh, we're gonna kick your ass now.

152
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,378
What?

153
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,088
They're not the police.

154
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,715
So...

155
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,426
Eve says she hasn't seen you in months

156
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:32,637
and that you're avoiding her?

157
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm not avoiding her, it's just with
Oliver and my new training routine,

158
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,433
- I've been busy.
- Uh-huh.

159
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,311
- Whoa, this guy's fast.
- Come on.

160
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,813
You're single. She's single.

161
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,067
Obviously, you two have had
the hots for each other

162
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,944
since, like, forever.

163
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,487
Just stop being weird about it.

164
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,780
Ask her out.

165
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,990
It's more complicated than that.

166
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,700
Oh, it's really not.

167
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,035
It's six words.

168
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,329
Hey, want to go out sometime,

169
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,957
uh, uh, please?

170
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,625
Actually, no, no, no.

171
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,460
Don't say please. Sounds desperate.

172
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,128
Why do you care so much?

173
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,713
You used to date Eve.

174
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,465
Well, uh, you're both my friends.

175
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,634
I want you to be happy.

176
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,887
And if it works, you'll owe me forever.

177
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,473
Okay, mine's down, by the way,

178
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,267
in case you hadn't noticed.

179
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,559
Hey, I'm trying to hold back.

180
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,728
I don't want to hurt him too much.
I think he's just a normal dude.

181
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,063
Normal this!

182
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,525
Yeah, totally normal.

183
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,026
I'd give up, buddy.

184
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,487
I just witnessed
this guy bench-pressing the moon.

185
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,408
Multi-Paul?

186
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,369
You! You killed my sister!

187
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:40,329
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

188
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,498
I didn't kill Kate, man!

189
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,166
The Lizard League did!

190
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:46,085
You let her die!

191
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,090
I'll kill you!

192
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,140
Get dressed.

193
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:03,811
Come on!

194
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,314
Rex!

195
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,481
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,069
I'm coming!

197
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,075
Fightmaster, you okay?

198
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,620
That guy is really strong.

199
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,914
Come on.

200
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,051
I didn't...

201
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,720
...fucking kill Kate.

202
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,681
I tried to save her.

203
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,016
Liar!

204
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,184
Get off him!

205
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,437
Not until he's dead.

206
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,689
Last warning. I don't want to hurt you.

207
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,942
You can't hurt us

208
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,988
no matter how strong you are,
because you're all alone.

209
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,825
Shit.

210
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,676
Stop!

211
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,263
Holy shit.

212
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,768
It's...

213
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,895
You guys...

214
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,897
you guys can see her, too, right?

215
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,565
It's not just me?

216
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,150
Kate?

217
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,361
They said you were dead.

218
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:38,447
You, out of everyone,

219
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,325
should know how hard we are to kill.

220
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,579
Kate. You're alive.

221
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,914
But...

222
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,500
Why didn't you...

223
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:52,920
You let me and Rae think you were dead.

224
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,880
What the hell, man?

225
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,132
It was her decision.

226
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,759
She wanted to disappear for a while.

227
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,095
Yeah, well...

228
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,722
it almost got me disappeared, too.

229
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,891
Wait.

230
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,102
You knew?

231
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,439
Aw, fuck you, Immortal.

232
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,817
And you, you fucking psycho.

233
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,736
You almost murdered me for nothing.

234
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,905
I've killed people for less.

235
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,949
Yeah, like me!

236
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,493
Just now, you frigging idiot.

237
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,330
Paul, just go before you make this worse.

238
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,374
Oh, that's rich.

239
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,793
What's worse than this?

240
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,175
Wait!

241
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:42,511
No, Kate. Paul almost killed Rex,

242
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:46,474
and because of him, those guys got away
with the Declaration of Independence.

243
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,225
- What?
- I don't care if he's your brother.

244
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:51,729
He's going to prison. Now.

245
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,731
<i>Go on.</i>

246
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,192
John Witherspoon,

247
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:58,110
Oliver Wolcott,

248
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,696
and...

249
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,865
George Wythe.

250
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,326
Bravo.

251
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,995
Your memory, Oliver--
it's quite astounding.

252
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:11,081
Now can I go play? 'Cause that
was the deal if I got them all right.

253
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:14,043
Did I say that? I don't know.

254
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,421
You promised. I remember.

255
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:20,007
Of course. We're done for the day.

256
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,009
Yes!

257
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:24,303
Hi, Mom. Going outside to play.
See you later.

258
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,014
They say they grow up fast...

259
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,309
Mm, but Oliver puts
every other child to shame.

260
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,521
His growth and development
are off the charts,

261
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:36,941
but they should start to level off
once he reaches puberty.

262
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,943
Oh. So, tomorrow.

263
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:42,905
Not quite that soon, but... soon.

264
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,992
Hi, April.

265
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,745
Um, you know stuff.

266
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,414
How important is
the Declaration of Independence again?

267
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,960
Ask your brother. See you both tomorrow!

268
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,006
Well if you hadn't dropped out
of college, you'd know, too.

269
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,426
- Mom.
- I'm kidding.

270
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,387
I'm glad to have you home.

271
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:09,640
Especially with Oliver
growing up so quickly.

272
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,104
He really looks up to you, you know.

273
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,191
And then what happened?

274
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:23,572
I had to save Rex from, like,
a hundred Multi-Pauls.

275
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,991
But the real bad guys got away.

276
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:29,702
Yeah. Sometimes that happens.

277
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:33,789
If I was there, I would've
made sure we got them.

278
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,251
I bet you would.

279
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,712
I made drawings of my costume,
and I'm practicing my moves.

280
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:43,340
We'll be a team, right? You'll teach me,
and we'll go fight bad guys?

281
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,926
Sure. Once you get your powers.

282
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:46,969
Promise.

283
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,888
I promise, but remember,
I didn't get my powers

284
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,807
until I was way older than...

285
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,768
...you.

286
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,980
Too late. You promised.

287
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,947
What happened to you?

288
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:12,745
I volunteered for an ass-kicking,
which I will never do again.

289
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:15,956
But that's only the second weirdest thing
that happened today.

290
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,417
Check it out.

291
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,378
Uh... hey.

292
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,882
Holy shit. Kate? Kate!

293
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,885
- Aw.
- I missed you guys.

294
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:30,471
But not enough to tell us she was alive,

295
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:33,098
so figure that one out.

296
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:36,685
I needed some time, on my own.

297
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,687
Or so I thought.

298
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:39,813
Kate.

299
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,482
How did you survive?

300
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,026
I always keep a copy for safekeeping.

301
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,363
We're both rejoining the Guardians,
effective immediately.

302
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,531
Also...

303
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:51,867
Shut up.

304
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,286
Kate, are you guys engaged?

305
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,831
I forged the ring myself
using metals I mined from--

306
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,125
Yeah. Let me see.

307
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,879
Oh, my gosh, it's perfect. Oh, my God.

308
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,049
I'm glad
you're sitting down, Rex,

309
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,969
'cause it's a full-on
family reunion today.

310
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,638
Hey, Rex.

311
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,931
Rae!

312
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,058
Oh.

313
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:19,353
Oh, this hurts so much,

314
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,772
but I don't even care.

315
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:25,734
Doc says she's all healed up
and ready to get back to saving the world.

316
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,320
I heard you came to the hospital a lot.

317
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,822
Of course I did.

318
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:33,158
We almost got killed together,
so that makes us, like, uh...

319
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,243
Losers?

320
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:37,037
Uh, I was gonna say too hot to live,

321
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,789
too cool to die,

322
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,374
but sure.

323
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,210
Ain't nothing
gonna stand up to us now.

324
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:47,047
The family's back, baby, and unbreakable.

325
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,426
Enlighten me.

326
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,511
It's nothing specific sir, but

327
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:56,098
the residents of this town reported
that their groundwater's

328
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,059
recently become sulfurous and undrinkable.

329
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,811
We're not the EPA, Donald.

330
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:04,189
There's been a chain of small
earthquakes throughout this region.

331
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,358
Well, they frack there, don't they?

332
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,818
Children here have reported

333
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,238
hearing strange sounds
from a local cave system.

334
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,906
Well, children hear a lot of things.

335
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,910
There's been three subway derailments
in the last month in New York,

336
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:20,748
all traced back to small shifts
in the tunnel foundations.

337
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,833
And the connection between all of this?

338
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:25,669
I... Uh, I-I don't have one yet.

339
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,965
But we've categorized over 300
unusual geological events, sir.

340
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:32,719
Well, map them out.

341
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,227
So, the country's got measles.

342
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:44,813
They do seem to be centered
around major cities,

343
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,733
but there's no other pattern
we can find yet.

344
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,235
And our resident earthquaker?

345
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,071
Hmm.

346
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,909
Well, when it graduates to more
than a giant coincidence, call me.

347
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:59,411
Uh, there's one other thing

348
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,372
you should see, sir.

349
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:07,044
<i>Too late. You promised!</i>

350
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,962
This, Donald.

351
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,174
You should have led with this.

352
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:15,219
You were 17 when you got your powers.

353
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,638
Which, honestly, was still too early.

354
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:20,724
And the fact that Oliver kept them
a secret-- I mean, that worries me.

355
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,893
He just wanted to surprise me.

356
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:25,020
He's too young.

357
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,106
He might get hurt,
or hurt someone else by accident.

358
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,900
I made him promise not to use his powers

359
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:32,694
until we all had time to talk about it.

360
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,655
And to not keep any more secrets.

361
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,616
He's a kid.
You think he's not gonna try them out?

362
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,201
You would have.

363
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,120
He promised.

364
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,587
<i>Stree-rike!</i>

365
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,881
Ha!

366
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,260
I just want to point out that here I am,

367
00:18:56,261 --> 00:19:00,013
the only guy without superpowers
or a banging cyborg body,

368
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,890
and I just beat both your butts

369
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,435
for the third time in a row. Boom.

370
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,688
Maybe bowling's his superpower.

371
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,356
I think so.

372
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:13,277
So, Mark, we've been here two hours,
and you still haven't brought it up.

373
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:14,611
Brought up what?

374
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,155
Oh, come on. I know that look.

375
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,491
There's something you
desperately want to talk about

376
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,202
but you're too scared
to just say whatever it is.

377
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,705
It's that obvious?

378
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,708
- Even I see it.
- Okay.

379
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:30,377
Remember when I was trapped
in that dimension with Angstrom?

380
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,754
And that other Eve showed up to save me?

381
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:36,301
I didn't tell you guys
everything she said.

382
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,850
So, the other Eve
said she always loved you

383
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,186
and that you needed to either
love her back or let her go

384
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,148
- because you were ruining her life?
- Pretty much.

385
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,609
Do you have feelings for Eve?

386
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,403
Yeah. I do.

387
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,615
And I've had them for a while, but...

388
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,783
should I tell her about the other her?

389
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,620
Hard no.
That's super weird and awkward.

390
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,622
Do not go there.

391
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:10,542
{\an8}William's right.
This other her isn't her.

392
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:13,503
{\an8}Just ask this Eve out. See where it goes.

393
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,548
Maybe? I-I don't know.

394
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,801
If I ask Eve out, I want to be honest
with her from the start.

395
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,303
Not like I was with Amber.

396
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,347
There's a big difference
between being honest

397
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:25,307
and being too honest,

398
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,352
- and this is definitely the latter.
- I agre--

399
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:29,645
Ah...

400
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,980
Rick?

401
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,067
It's his heart.
He's still having pain from...

402
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,568
what Sinclair did.

403
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:41,031
Ah, it's okay. I'm getting used to it.

404
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,200
But you should talk to Eve.

405
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,826
If there's one thing I've learned,
it's that

406
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,829
life can change in an instant.

407
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,498
So don't wait.

408
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,460
Thanks, Rick. That's good advice.

409
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,422
But leave the other her out of it.

410
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,849
Um... how are we gonna get back to campus?

411
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,352
Say, Mark...

412
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,189
Ho, ho! Do a loop!

413
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,493
Okay.

414
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,038
Just tell her how you feel. Easy.

415
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,751
Oh, God, how am I more nervous
about this than fighting aliens?

416
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,756
Are you gonna hover out there
all day talking to yourself or come in?

417
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,177
<i>If you want</i>

418
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,138
to go to the zoo, then stop squirming.

419
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,598
But you and April always say
I should be myself.

420
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:51,643
Yes, yes, and that's true,

421
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:54,896
but you want to be a superhero, right?

422
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,233
And you know that many superheroes
have secret identities.

423
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:01,696
- Even your brother.
- Yeah...

424
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,989
Well...

425
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,075
...this is your secret identity.

426
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,536
Cool!

427
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,583
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about my powers.

428
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:17,044
That's okay, Oliver.

429
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:18,920
But no more secrets.

430
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:20,922
Huh? I'll get it!

431
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:22,925
Wait, wait. I'm not finished.

432
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,597
Think you missed a spot there, kiddo.

433
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,892
I'm Cecil Stedman.

434
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,310
I've heard of you.

435
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,188
You tell superheroes what to do and
if they don't listen, you get super mad.

436
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:38,648
Hm. That's about right.

437
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,650
And I've also heard of you.

438
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,696
Good, because I'm almost a superhero, too.

439
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:47,408
That's why I'm here.

440
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,994
<i>Uh, yeah, they're both good.</i>

441
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:55,123
My dad got another furniture job, so
he's not working at Burger Mart anymore,

442
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,752
and, well, my mom's helping out
at a preschool near our house.

443
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,295
How's your mom?

444
00:23:00,296 --> 00:23:04,007
Uh, her arm's totally healed,
so she's doing okay.

445
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,343
I think she likes having
me and Oliver around.

446
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,845
Except, guess who can fly now.

447
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:11,181
Oliver?! Wait, already?

448
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:13,767
Oh, oh, man. I feel for your mom.

449
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,685
How are you gonna keep him in the house?

450
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:17,687
I don't know yet.

451
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,440
- Are you going to college?
- Yeah.

452
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,400
I realized my dad was right.

453
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,736
I am not an architect or an engineer.

454
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,572
I mean, look at this place.
It's barely staying up here.

455
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:32,077
So, I signed up for part-time classes.
I start next week.

456
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,662
That's amazing.

457
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,372
Thanks.

458
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:36,998
It's weird, though.

459
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:40,919
Why is going to school more nerve-racking
than fighting aliens?

460
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,339
I... know the feeling.

461
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,217
So...

462
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,303
Why are you really here, Mark?

463
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:52,431
Okay.

464
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,310
I've been thinking
about this a lot, and...

465
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,479
...I want to see if we--

466
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,274
meaning you and me--

467
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,401
if-if we could, um,

468
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,404
you know, work together,

469
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:11,575
but, l-like, as people,
not-not work-work.

470
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:15,203
Are you... asking me out?

471
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:17,914
Uh, yeah.

472
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:21,002
I mean,
I'm just doing a terrible job at it.

473
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,840
April doesn't know, so don't blame her.

474
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:28,842
Even I only found out yesterday.

475
00:24:28,843 --> 00:24:31,052
I would've appreciated a call.

476
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,804
You found out anyway.

477
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:34,764
And I don't work for you.

478
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:37,142
I thought we agreed
to trust each other, Debbie.

479
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:41,271
I'm sorry, but Cecil, please.

480
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:44,316
Mark, and now Oliver,
are players in a game

481
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,694
that involves the entire Earth and beyond.

482
00:24:47,778 --> 00:24:51,323
And like it or not, Debbie,
you're a part of this, too.

483
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:54,951
Cecil, how many times
do we have to have this conversation?

484
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:58,788
My responsibilities
will always be to my family first.

485
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:00,498
And that's never going to change.

486
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,418
No matter what.

487
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:24,732
What the hell?

488
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,359
Oh, Jesus Christ.

489
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,195
Are you serious?

490
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:36,451
Cecil spends ten gajillion dollars
on Mark's fitness classes,

491
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,162
but can't fix our goddamn-- Oh!

492
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:42,332
What the fuck is this?

493
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,006
Lost contact completely.

494
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,841
- No response from the team.
- Over 100 earthquakes reported.

495
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,718
- I can't get anyone on the line.
- I need you to go in there

496
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:55,470
- and check it out.
- Sorry, it's all I know.

497
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,473
Sir, we have intense geological events
all over the country.

498
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,725
But, worse, we can't reach a single hero.

499
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,602
Even the Guardians have gone silent.

500
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,481
Most heroes carry a GDA tracker.
Th-Throw them up on the screen.

501
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,403
Show me Seismic.

502
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:13,947
Oh, no.

503
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:16,491
- Report, report.
- Code red, right now.

504
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,703
<i>I'm sorry,
but I can't agree to that.</i>

505
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,621
<i>It would only
be for a few hours a day.</i>

506
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,957
We can monitor his superpowers
more closely,

507
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:26,501
help him understand and control them.

508
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,753
There's that word again.

509
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,547
You know what I mean.

510
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:34,093
There's no way I'm letting you
take Oliver to your...

511
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,220
...lab.

512
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,306
The only reason I even let April in here
is because I trust her.

513
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,849
Ouch.

514
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,352
Cecil, I understand you have a job to do.

515
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:48,064
But I also know that everything else
is secondary to that job.

516
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:52,152
And that's why I can never trust you
with either Mark or Oliver's lives.

517
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:54,571
Other people have sons and daughters, too.

518
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:57,198
Sons and daughters
who aren't as lucky as your boys.

519
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,660
- That is not fair.
- What?

520
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:02,245
What are you talking about?

521
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:05,206
- What, every single one?
- What's going on?

522
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,375
Every superhero in America
has been abducted.

523
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:09,295
Except for two.

524
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,715
<i>Uh... Eve?</i>

525
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,342
Okay.

526
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:16,593
Okay?

527
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:19,013
Sure. Let's try.

528
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,264
Really?

529
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:22,849
I mean, it makes sense, right?

530
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,435
We're both superheroes,
we know what comes with the territory.

531
00:27:25,436 --> 00:27:29,397
I-I-- We've already been through a bunch
of life or death situations together.

532
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,441
So...

533
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,443
let's try and see what happens.

534
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,780
T-That's great.

535
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,281
Oh, man, I-I...

536
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:40,200
I just didn't want to leave you
hanging anymore.

537
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,785
What?

538
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:46,081
Leave me hanging? Uh, you asked me out.

539
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:47,875
No, I meant...

540
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:53,671
Remember that other you I told you about?

541
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,756
Yeah.

542
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,466
She just--

543
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,926
She said she always loved me

544
00:27:57,927 --> 00:28:01,137
and not knowing if I loved her back
was killing her,

545
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,848
so she told me I should
either ask you out or...

546
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,141
shut it down forever.

547
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:08,144
Wait, I-I'm sorry,
so you're only asking me out now

548
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:11,439
because the other me, who is not me,

549
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,776
told you how miserably she was?

550
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,153
Wait, uh, no, that-- that's not it.

551
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:19,656
Did you have feelings for me
before you met her?

552
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,074
Eve, I mean-- Of course.

553
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:23,701
Or are you only here
because you feel sorry for me?

554
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:28,165
Oh, God, no. I--
That's not what I meant. I...

555
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,544
Cecil, please, not now.

556
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,255
What do you mean?

557
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:38,174
Just Eve and I?

558
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,387
Eve, there's, uh, a problem.

559
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,473
This better be fucking cataclysmic.

560
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,573
Uh-oh.

561
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:05,660
<i>Patience is a virtue.</i>

562
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:08,413
<i>It took months for me and my friends</i>

563
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:12,333
<i>to learn all of your
particular vibrations.</i>

564
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,294
<i>How you move,</i>

565
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:16,797
how you breathe.

566
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:21,759
The pitter-patter
of your black, little hearts.

567
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,761
I think you'll agree

568
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,597
it was worth

569
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,933
every minute of my incarceration.

570
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,271
I tried to change your corrupt system.

571
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,315
Tear down your false idols.

572
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:38,651
Take back what you stole from the earth.

573
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,403
But every time I was stopped

574
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,740
by you superpowered fascists,

575
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:47,243
fighting to keep
your capitalistic slave machine running,

576
00:29:47,244 --> 00:29:49,454
until now.

577
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,499
You haven't stopped a thing!

578
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:56,294
You're crushing us.

579
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:59,172
Aw, shit! Stop!

580
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:01,508
<i>See? You're toxic,</i>

581
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,551
<i>even to your own compatriots.</i>

582
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,471
- Any luck?
- - I've diverted all power to my transmitter.

583
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:08,806
It should just reach
the GDA surveillance network

584
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,225
from this far underground.

585
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,728
Oh, what do you want, Seismic?

586
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:17,273
Oh, didn't I make that clear?

587
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:21,361
Soon, you'll all feel the full weight
of the evil you've done

588
00:30:21,362 --> 00:30:23,656
to support your failing human race.

589
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,959
For you are all dust.

590
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,712
And to dust you shall return!

591
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,424
Huh? What?

592
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:45,843
What is that sound?

593
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,907
Ah. Someone upped their game.

594
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,367
I know. I'm impressed.

595
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,661
Well, well, well.

596
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:17,250
It's my old friends Token Diversity
and Gender Stereotype.

597
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:20,503
Um, I wouldn't talk,
Generic Mad Scientist.

598
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:23,047
Now set everyone free
before this turns ugly.

599
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,258
It turned ugly the day Homo sapiens

600
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,469
took their first step onto land.

601
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,433
Hmm.

602
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:36,185
I take it back. I'm not impressed anymore.

603
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:38,938
Oh, that wasn't an attack.

604
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,357
That's how we talk.

605
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,568
<i>Cecil, our situation
is rapidly becoming dire.</i>

606
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:29,155
How does a nobody like Doc Seismic
pull shit like this?

607
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:33,201
He seems to have found allies
from somewhere deep inside the earth.

608
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:35,495
I can't see that, Donald.

609
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,582
Who do we have if Mark and Eve go down?

610
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,959
No one close, sir.
He's cleaned us out.

611
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,421
Open up the darkroom
and ready drop-pods one through three.

612
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,506
Yes, sir.

613
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,761
I didn't mean anything.

614
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:54,263
But Cecil said
all the superheroes were gone.

615
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:57,392
So I wanted to go out
and help until they got back.

616
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,395
And I'm glad you wanted to help,

617
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,815
but why didn't you talk to me first?

618
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,733
I don't know.

619
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,404
Because you knew I'd say no?

620
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,739
Hmm.

621
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,826
Maybe that's a clue
that you shouldn't be trying to sneak out.

622
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:16,286
I guess.

623
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:18,996
I'm sorry, Mom.

624
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:22,208
It's okay. I understand.

625
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,502
You just want
to be like Invincible, right?

626
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,629
- Yeah!
- Well...

627
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,548
you know who's Invincible's mom?

628
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:33,886
Mm-hmm. That's right. Me.

629
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:36,514
And since he always listens to his mom,

630
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,307
I'll ask him to start training you

631
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:41,227
so someday you can be
a hero just like him.

632
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,356
As long as there's
no more secrets between us.

633
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,691
Promise?

634
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,653
I promise, I promise, I promise!

635
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:05,586
Yah!

636
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,646
You think you're strong?

637
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:29,484
These creatures were born deep in the fire

638
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:31,903
and pressure of the earth's womb!

639
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,411
Mark, he's not lying.

640
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,337
Free the others! I'll cover you.

641
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,803
Stop her!

642
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,889
Whoa! Whoa!

643
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,106
Go!

644
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,611
Goodbye.

645
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,668
Eve!

646
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,982
Eve?

647
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,567
Are you okay?

648
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,153
Eve.

649
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:00,700
You're not supposed
to be this tough.

650
00:36:00,701 --> 00:36:03,661
You're not supposed to win.

651
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:10,043
Things change.

652
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,548
<i>Invincible!</i>

653
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,012
Invincible, wake up!

654
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,808
Wake Eve up!

655
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,560
She can get us out of these things.

656
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,271
Eve! Eve, wake up.

657
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,486
Aw, fuck!

658
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:43,451
Don't feel bad you're being
returned to Mother Earth.

659
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,119
- Your remains will help feed a new,
- Eve, please.

660
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,788
- better kind of life,
- We're in big trouble.
- Mark?

661
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,584
free of your oppressive violence.

662
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:54,879
We're running out of time, man!

663
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,423
- Five...
- What happened?

664
00:36:57,424 --> 00:36:59,050
You got to get us out of here.

665
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,552
...four...

666
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:04,639
No final quips before your deaths?

667
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,141
Eat your own dick!

668
00:37:07,142 --> 00:37:08,100
- ...three...

669
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,186
Then, with that final display

670
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,355
of wit and intelligence...

671
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:13,272
...two...

672
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:15,609
...goodbye forever.

673
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,654
I don't think so.

674
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:20,739
...one.

675
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,383
What the fuck?

676
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,103
You haven't stopped anything!

677
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,131
Mark!

678
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,804
No!

679
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,066
If I'm going down,

680
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,985
so is everyone!

681
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,115
Shit.

682
00:39:53,934 --> 00:39:56,061
Yes! Yes!

683
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,271
Fuck yes!

684
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,774
Up top!

685
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:05,569
Yeah! Down low? Oh, ho, no?

686
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,738
You know what? That's okay.

687
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:11,408
We won, my dick's out and I don't care.

688
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:14,703
Guardians of the Globe, baby!

689
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,372
Where's Doc Seismic?

690
00:40:16,373 --> 00:40:18,874
He was in the Shadowverse.

691
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,418
Soon, he'll be back in prison.

692
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,419
Darkwing?

693
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,172
Darkwing Two, technically. But, yes.

694
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,096
Why the hell is he here?

695
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,807
And why the fuck are those things here?

696
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,143
He's a murderer.

697
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:41,063
And those things-- the guy
who made those things killed people.

698
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,648
They almost killed my best friend.

699
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:44,024
He's right.

700
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:46,443
I did terrible things.

701
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,320
But that was before.

702
00:40:48,321 --> 00:40:50,072
I'm better now, thanks to Cecil.

703
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,283
Better? You should be in prison.

704
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,660
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

705
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:57,955
Cecil said he put Sinclair away,
and Darkwing, too,

706
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,165
and now they're both working for him?

707
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,458
We don't know everything yet.

708
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,295
I don't need to know everything
to know this is wrong.

709
00:41:04,296 --> 00:41:07,131
Jesus. I was an idiot to believe Cecil.

710
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,841
Even my mom warned me about trusting him.

711
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:11,010
Stand down, Invincible.

712
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:14,513
They saved us. They saved everyone here.

713
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,390
We can get to the bottom of this together.

714
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,727
Oh, I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this right now.

715
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,812
Mark, wait.

716
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,897
I can't, Eve.

717
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:25,232
I'm sorry.

718
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,194
And I'm sorry about before, too.

719
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,322
I messed it all up.

720
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,744
He's coming.

721
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,082
Are you working with D.A. Sinclair?

722
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,751
Calm down.

723
00:41:43,752 --> 00:41:45,961
He turned people into monsters.

724
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,631
He almost killed William.
He should be in prison.

725
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:51,091
He can't fix his mistakes in prison, Mark.

726
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,468
Neither can Darkwing.

727
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,470
What are you even talking about?

728
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:59,183
D.A. Sinclair's a genius.

729
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,061
Darkwing cracked from fighting
endless crime in Midnight City.

730
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:04,772
You don't waste people like that,
you reform them.

731
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:06,232
Repair them.

732
00:42:06,233 --> 00:42:08,609
Let them make restitution
for their mistakes.

733
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,946
Mistakes? They murdered people!

734
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,698
Rick still isn't right
after what Sinclair did to him.

735
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:18,035
Sinclair's new Reanimen
are made with donated corpses.

736
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,204
Darkwing will never kill again.

737
00:42:20,205 --> 00:42:23,792
They both went through severe
psychological reprogramming.

738
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,586
They save lives now, Mark.

739
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,256
And repaying the very
substantial debt they owe us all.

740
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,716
That is bullshit and you know it!

741
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,511
Is it? You killed Angstrom Levy.

742
00:42:35,512 --> 00:42:36,929
Should I lock you up, too?

743
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,889
Throw away the key?

744
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,432
You-you know that was different.

745
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,226
A man's still dead because of you.

746
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,770
And I think about it every single day.

747
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,398
But he almost killed my mom and brother.

748
00:42:47,399 --> 00:42:48,816
Exactly.

749
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,318
You were trying to save lives,

750
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,570
which is what I'm trying to do, so

751
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,864
how about you extend me
the same privilege

752
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,408
- and go home.
- No.

753
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,576
No way. I'm not going anywhere

754
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,497
until Sinclair and Darkwing
are both back in prison.

755
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,503
Did you hear me?

756
00:43:10,297 --> 00:43:11,880
Go home, Mark,

757
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:13,799
before you do something you'll regret.

758
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,802
I told you, I'm not leaving unt--

759
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,137
Wait, why are we in here again?

760
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,680
Please go.

761
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:20,931
What are you hiding in here?

762
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,683
Who else is working for you?

763
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:25,060
The white room is for my protection.

764
00:43:25,061 --> 00:43:26,562
Protection from what?

765
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:29,774
From you, Mark. From you.

766
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,283
<i>Viltrumites have conquered
thousands of planets.</i>

767
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:44,204
<i>Waged war across hundreds of light years.</i>

768
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:49,669
<i>They rule over the largest empire
the universe has ever seen.</i>

769
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,381
<i>But, man, their prison food sucks.</i>

770
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:55,674
<i>I really thought it would be better.</i>

771
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,134
<i>I mean, I-I know, it's prison food,</i>

772
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,179
<i>but still, if I'm being honest,
I was expecting more.</i>

773
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,431
<i>We usually kill our enemies,</i>

774
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,558
<i>not feed them.</i>

775
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,934
<i>Yeah, well it shows.</i>

776
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:07,811
<i>I don't know
how much more of this I can take.</i>

777
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,772
<i>This is not good.</i>

778
00:44:09,773 --> 00:44:11,857
<i>If you don't like it,
you should go.</i>

779
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,901
<i>What are you talking about?
I'm in prison.</i>

780
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:16,695
<i>It is the one place
you can't just go from.</i>

781
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,240
<i>You're stronger
than when we first met.</i>

782
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,118
<i>Strong enough to break out of here,
if you tried.</i>

783
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,830
<i>First, I'm very flattered
you noticed that. Thank you.</i>

784
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,375
<i>Second, like I've said
a hundred times before,</i>

785
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:30,918
<i>I am not leaving here without you.</i>

786
00:44:30,919 --> 00:44:34,463
<i>And I'm never leaving. So go.</i>

787
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,841
<i>Before they laser you open
to figure out how you're so strong.</i>

788
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,386
<i>Hmm. Why do you care so much?</i>

789
00:44:40,387 --> 00:44:42,971
<i>I don't. Live, die.</i>

790
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,306
<i>It's your choice.</i>

791
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:47,684
<i>Then, in that case,
you are not getting rid of me that easy.</i>

792
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,813
<i>Besides, like you said,
I am incredibly ripped now,</i>

793
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:53,566
<i>so it would take a pretty big laser...</i>

794
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,861
<i>...to do me in.</i>

795
00:44:57,862 --> 00:45:00,197
Guys. Uh, okay. One second.

796
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:01,740
Can we just talk about this
before we, uh...

797
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,171
<i>So, that sucked.</i>

798
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,465
<i>But I was right.</i>

799
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,467
<i>You're alive?</i>

800
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,762
<i>Of course, how else--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

801
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,764
<i>Wait. Wai-wai-wai-wai-wait.</i>

802
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:28,016
<i>Were you worried I was gonna die?</i>

803
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,144
<i>Wha-- I-I-I...</i>

804
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,606
<i>This is great. This is progress.</i>

805
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,732
<i>You care about me.</i>

806
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:37,485
<i>I feel like you're halfway
to joining the cause.</i>

807
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,280
<i>Hello, Nolan? Hello?</i>

808
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:43,991
<i>Oh, I get it. You're ignoring me.</i>

809
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,951
<i>Very mature.</i>

810
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:49,413
<i>Also, not how new best friends
should treat each other.</i>

811
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,665
<i>Hello? Nolan. Come on.</i>

812
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,251
<i>Come on, seriously. Stop.</i>
