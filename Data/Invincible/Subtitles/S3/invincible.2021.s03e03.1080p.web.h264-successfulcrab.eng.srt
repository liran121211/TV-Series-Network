1
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:06,256
<i>The artificial skin took.
They missed a spot.</i>

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:08,258
<i>It was all that was left
of my real skin.</i>

3
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:10,427
<i>It's a reminder that I messed up.</i>

4
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:11,594
And to never let it happen again.

5
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:15,640
<i>You can be the good guy
or the guy who saves the world.</i>

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>You can't be both.</i>

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>It's my job to defend
the planet from threats.</i>

8
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,854
There's a thing in my head.
You got to get it out

9
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,522
- before Cecil finds me.
- Everyone step back.

10
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,024
<i>This has nothing to do with you.</i>

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,067
<i>Hell it doesn't.</i>

12
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,653
I will never work for you again.

13
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:29,988
We don't have to put up with it anymore!

14
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>The door is over there.</i>

15
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:32,991
Do you think I should help

16
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:34,409
<i>this Titan guy out?</i>

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,578
Well, whatever you told that kid
to get him on your side, it fucking--

18
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:37,704
I told him the truth.

19
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,330
I'm gonna make this city better
for a lot of people.

20
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,709
I didn't get my powers
until I was way older than... you.

21
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,085
When you never called me back,
I figured

22
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,587
maybe you weren't interested.

23
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:47,548
<i>Let's give it a try.</i>

24
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,263
{\an8}What are you doing here?!

25
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,807
You promised you wouldn't use
your powers without me.

26
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,100
You could have gotten hurt!

27
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,144
I just wanted to see you
beating up bad guys.

28
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:20,231
But they were gonna pour lava
in your face, so I had to help.

29
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,192
And I'm not using my powers
without you. You're here.

30
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,864
We're leaving.

31
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,449
- But I want to stay and watch.
- I said

32
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,870
we're leaving.

33
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,417
Am I in trouble?

34
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,127
What do you think?

35
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,714
Go to your room. Your brother and I
need to discuss what you've done.

36
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,302
And what have I said
about flying in the house?

37
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,305
Mom...

38
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,894
Ugh.

39
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,565
I was worried this was gonna happen.

40
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:06,485
I know, but asking him to not use
his powers isn't realistic.

41
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,404
And you did promise I'd train him.

42
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,907
He's so young, Mark.

43
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,618
Yeah, but he's tough.

44
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,578
You should've seen him today.

45
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,416
{\an8}I just want him to have
a normal childhood,

46
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,252
{\an8}or as normal as we can give him.

47
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:26,047
I'll be careful, I promise.

48
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:29,050
I won't let him get hurt,
and I won't let him hurt anyone else.

49
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,761
{\an8}I know you didn't ask for this.

50
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:35,681
Neither did you, but we're a family.

51
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,143
We'll figure this out together.

52
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:41,979
<i>Did that make any sense to you?
I mean, it's supposed to be</i>

53
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,106
an introduction to architecture.

54
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,650
Yeah, it's pretty complicated,

55
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,486
but I like applying what we learn.

56
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:51,739
Um, where exactly
are you applying this stuff?

57
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,326
{\an8}Oh, uh, just like building models
and stuff.

58
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,702
Eve? Oh, my God.

59
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,538
- I thought that was you.
- Amber.

60
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,624
I'll see you in class next week.

61
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,501
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

62
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:07,797
Oh. No, no, it's fine.
It's-it's really good to see you.

63
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:09,757
I didn't know you'd enrolled.

64
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:15,513
Just part-time, but, yeah, I'm taking
some architecture and engineering classes.

65
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:17,473
I want to get better at using my powers,

66
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,227
and since I make and build stuff,
this, you know, kind of made sense.

67
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,521
Ah, I guess I never really
thought about superheroes

68
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,773
having to learn to use their powers.

69
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,109
It's not all tights and fistfights.

70
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,946
Are you busy?

71
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,075
Do you want to grab coffee
and, like, catch up for real?

72
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,662
But Debbie and Oliver are okay?

73
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,832
Yeah, Mark rescued them
from this Angstrom Levy guy.

74
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,751
It was rough, but they're all
doing much better now.

75
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,004
Oh, thank God.

76
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,798
And then Mark and Cecil
got in a huge fight,

77
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,676
so Mark's on his own right now.

78
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,470
And, uh, hmm...

79
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,597
Speaking of Mark,

80
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,475
I should probably tell you something.

81
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,102
You two are dating.

82
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,939
It's okay.

83
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,816
William told me.

84
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,943
I'm happy for you both.

85
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,155
I didn't want it to mess up
anything between us.

86
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:18,326
I mean, I'm glad it didn't happen
the next day,

87
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:22,496
but honestly I always wondered if you two
would get together after we broke up.

88
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:26,709
It's obvious to everyone
but us, huh?

89
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,878
Maybe a little.

90
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:34,091
But, seriously, Mark and I...

91
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,177
Our worlds were too different.

92
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,220
But you and him,

93
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,889
that's where you both live.

94
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,976
Yeah. And I have to be honest,
it feels good.

95
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,646
It's exciting but also... comfortable.

96
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,065
Do you know what I mean?

97
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:52,234
Hmm. I do, in fact.

98
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,195
Wait.

99
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,197
Well...

100
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,199
there's this guy Kyle.

101
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,744
- And...
- Go on.

102
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,875
Ta-da!

103
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,710
It's not buried under a mountain

104
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:14,006
and it doesn't have a pool, but it's ours.

105
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,133
Technically the deed is in my name--

106
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,636
We're gonna make a mint
when we finally sell it,

107
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:21,847
but for now it's good to be home, baby.

108
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,307
It's bigger than I thought.

109
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,268
That's what she said.
Okay, wait, hang on.

110
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,978
Sorry. Old me again.

111
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,232
Did I do that?
Anyway, it's pretty big.

112
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,984
A little dusting, some new furniture,

113
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:38,614
and it'll be the perfect crime-busting
fight palace once again.

114
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,950
Come on, I'll give you the tour.

115
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,880
We can find you a room
before the others take first pick.

116
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,676
You want a window, right?

117
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,270
Wow, this is... embarrassing.

118
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,731
I really didn't remember
my old room being so...

119
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,483
You?

120
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,028
Yeah, oy, I guess.

121
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,740
You all look so happy.

122
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,993
And you fought actual supervillains.

123
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,703
Well, same as you, right?

124
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,080
You've been a superhero
since you were a kid.

125
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,082
Yeah, but not like this.

126
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,544
When my parents discovered I had powers,
they went all in on it.

127
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,797
Suddenly, instead of soccer
in the backyard,

128
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,009
I'm learning chokeholds and bomb defusals.

129
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,635
I worked solo in our town.

130
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,471
But it was all small stuff.

131
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:46,182
Gangs, bank robberies, lost pets.

132
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:48,601
I think we had
one bad guy with superpowers

133
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,978
in a 200-mile radius.

134
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,105
Ah, at least you had parents.

135
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:56,484
Mine sold me to the government
for the price of a steak dinner,

136
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,737
so I got scientists instead.

137
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,739
Same ones who cut me open

138
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,201
and grafted shit
up and down my nervous system.

139
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,244
I'm sorry.

140
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,621
That must have been hard.

141
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,499
Eh, it's better than being a nobody, huh?

142
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,585
And everyone has fucked-up childhoods.

143
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,588
Mm, not like ours.

144
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,884
Man, I would've killed for a place
like this when I was a teenager.

145
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,554
This is the first time
I've actually been here.

146
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,517
Oh, I kept my real body
at another location.

147
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,520
Teen Team was always a bit of a misnomer.

148
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,606
Uh, we're not going back to that, are we?

149
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,191
I'm a grown-ass man.

150
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,317
He's right.

151
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,985
We definitely need a new name.

152
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,154
Rex and the Splosions.

153
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,656
Rex and his Exes.

154
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:47,953
Rex Splode and a bunch of other people
whose names you don't really need to know.

155
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:52,332
What? I'm just giving
the people what they want.

156
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,297
Amanda, wait,
that's a pet project of mine.

157
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,799
Okay.

158
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,676
Sorry. It's, uh...

159
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,302
not ready to be shared yet.

160
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,304
Huh.

161
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,306
So much for my spare apartment
in the city.

162
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,725
Oh, you're welcome to stay, Eve.

163
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,102
There's enough room for all of us.

164
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,062
Or, you know,

165
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,314
you could rejoin the team.

166
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,859
Thanks, but it wouldn't be the same.

167
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,655
I can't believe Kate chose
to stay with the Guardians.

168
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,574
She's marrying the Immortal.

169
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,368
Eh, guess we won't be invited
to the wedding now.

170
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,078
Where will you go?

171
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,290
I'm moving back in with my folks.

172
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,749
Seriously?

173
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,209
Why?

174
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,421
Because they're my parents
and I need to fix things between us.

175
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,506
And...

176
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,009
you want to be closer to Mark, right?

177
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,054
I thought you weren't
such a jerk anymore.

178
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,931
Baby steps, Eve.

179
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,434
Baby steps.

180
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,653
<i>This is unacceptable.</i>

181
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,239
<i>My best assassin rots</i>

182
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,950
in one of your disgusting American prisons

183
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,621
and you do nothing about it.

184
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,498
Because it has nothing to do with me.

185
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,667
You seized Machine Head's empire,

186
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,921
so you inherited
his obligations to The Order.

187
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,466
Mr. Liu, with all respect,

188
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,384
I don't care about your Order.

189
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,678
I took the city, and that's all I want.

190
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,139
You and your pals can keep
everything else.

191
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,684
That's not how this works.

192
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,686
You are now a member of The Order

193
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:42,232
and you will handle this issue
in your territory.

194
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,527
Even if I agreed with you, which I don't,

195
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,197
this was a private vendetta.

196
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,741
Multi-Paul got himself into this mess,

197
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,619
so he can get himself out.

198
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,497
Boss, uh...

199
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:58,333
a word?

200
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,961
I know you do things your own way,

201
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,048
but even Machine Head bent a knee
to The Order.

202
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,425
They got the whole world
split up between them.

203
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:11,136
Just make 'em happy,
and they'll leave us alone.

204
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,763
Or what?

205
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:14,973
Or they replace you with the next guy.

206
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,266
Their guy.

207
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,643
And he does it.

208
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,896
And you, me, and your family
are all six feet under.

209
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,732
We just got the East Side under control.

210
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:25,818
{\an8}The last thing we need is the kind of heat

211
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,821
{\an8}that breaking out Multi-Paul
is gonna bring down on us.

212
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,823
We don't have a choice.

213
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,574
And I can't teleport him out of there.

214
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,952
They got a energy field up or something.

215
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:37,579
Hmm.

216
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,958
Maybe Machine Head knew a thing or two.

217
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,003
Okay, tell Liu I'll take care of it
this one time.

218
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,883
But then I don't want to see
his fucked-up face in my city again.

219
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,636
I mean, I ain't gonna tell him that, but--

220
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,181
You got it, boss.

221
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,570
Wait up!

222
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,531
Whoa! Whoa!

223
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,367
Come on, you can do better than that.

224
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,618
It's not fair.

225
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,288
You're way faster.

226
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,251
Hey, I said we'd start training.

227
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,795
I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

228
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,839
When are you gonna teach me how to fight?

229
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,508
I've been practicing stuff
I saw on the Internet.

230
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,012
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

231
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,430
One thing at a time.

232
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,890
Flying first.

233
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:39,641
Fighting second.

234
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,644
You'd better keep up,
we don't want to be late.

235
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,105
Late for what?

236
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,732
Wait up!

237
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,240
This is so awesome.

238
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,992
Remember our deal.

239
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,452
I know, I know.

240
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,871
No using my powers
in public without permission.

241
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:02,539
That's right.

242
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,249
Thanks again for doing this, Art.

243
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,293
Eh, it's my pleasure.

244
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:08,253
I'm glad to finally meet the little guy.

245
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,379
All right.

246
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,548
Get ready, because...

247
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,053
...Kid Omni-Man is here!

248
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,014
Oh, geez.

249
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,642
He told me the "O" was for "Oliver."

250
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,977
Can you give us a minute?

251
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:26,105
Yeah, of course.

252
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,069
You don't like it?

253
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,737
Costume's great.

254
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,073
It's the name that's the problem.

255
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:38,200
Why?

256
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,036
People are gonna hear that name
or see that symbol

257
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,329
and think of Dad.

258
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,456
I know, it'll be great.

259
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,083
Oliver...

260
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,127
Dad did terrible things here.

261
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,338
Things people aren't gonna forget
anytime soon.

262
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:54,049
{\an8}But you said he's different now.

263
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,719
{\an8}And when I save people in this costume,
they'll get it.

264
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,180
It's more complicated than that.

265
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,641
It's gonna take a long time

266
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,102
and a lot of work
for everyone to forgive him.

267
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,564
Maybe someday that might happen.

268
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,566
But we're not there yet.

269
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,234
Not even close.

270
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,695
Do you understand?

271
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,322
I think so.

272
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,325
Word on the street is,
you cut ties with Cecil.

273
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,869
Yeah.

274
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,620
It's time for a change.

275
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,372
In more ways than one.

276
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,623
What's this?

277
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,043
A fresh start.

278
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,384
Whoa!

279
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,348
You look amazing!

280
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,683
I don't know.

281
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,184
Feels a little serious?

282
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,687
<i>We interrupt
our afternoon classics with breaking news</i>

283
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,772
<i>of an attack at Payton Penitentiary.</i>

284
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:54,776
<i>Early reports indicate
superpowered individuals are involved.</i>

285
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,529
Oh, man, this is perfect.

286
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,615
We can try out our new suits.

287
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,033
Okay.

288
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,035
You can come along, but--

289
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,120
I know, I know. I won't fight.

290
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,414
I'll just watch.
Let's go already, we're gonna miss it.

291
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,374
Hey, say thank you to Art.

292
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:10,500
Thank you, Art.

293
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,170
It's a pleasure.

294
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,342
He has no idea where we're going.

295
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:23,598
Reminds me of another kid I knew.

296
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,312
It's about time.

297
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,815
Look at these fools.

298
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,818
Their weapons are like tiny tickles.

299
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,529
Their body armor is thin,

300
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,158
- like cheap toilet paper.
- Yeah!

301
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,661
Whoa, who are those guys?

302
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:46,995
That's Kursk.

303
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,747
He's got electricity powers.

304
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,457
The other guy's Furnace.

305
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,918
{\an8}Inside that suit
I think he's made of lava or something.

306
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,378
{\an8}I've fought them before.

307
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,380
Then let's go get 'em, Mark.

308
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,423
- Whoa. H-Hold on.
- Huh?

309
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,300
First, when we're out in public,

310
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,761
you got to call me Invincible, not Mark.

311
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,973
And you can call me Kid Omni--

312
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,017
Wait, I haven't figured out
a new name yet.

313
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,728
That's fine,
because I'm not calling you anything

314
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:14,147
because you're just gonna stay here

315
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,858
and watch.

316
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,736
Those guys need help.

317
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,823
Oliv... Kid... Oh, my... Just stop!

318
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,996
Furnace, is raining boy!

319
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,002
Aah!

320
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:40,257
Leave him alone!

321
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,778
Oliver, are you okay?

322
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,574
I thought we weren't supposed
to use our real names.

323
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,909
Oh, thank God.

324
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,495
You didn't save one for me?

325
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,748
Are you kidding me?

326
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:14,958
I told you to just watch.

327
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,418
You almost got yourself killed!

328
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,586
I'm fine.

329
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,962
It barely hurt.

330
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,423
Don't ever do that again.

331
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:22,466
But those guys--

332
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:24,259
I don't want to hear it.
You either listen

333
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,720
or you go home.

334
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,138
Got it?

335
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,266
Okay, sorry.

336
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,269
Sorry.

337
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:39,275
Thank you.

338
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,611
Like this?

339
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:43,779
Mm-hmm.

340
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,322
Then smell it.

341
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,948
Mm.

342
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,617
Now taste.

343
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,577
Mmm.

344
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,162
You should get

345
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:53,955
black currant,

346
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,749
dark cherry,

347
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,626
uh, wet earth.

348
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,127
Mmm.

349
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,879
That's amazing.

350
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,464
How'd you learn all this?

351
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,175
Nolan and I did a lot of wine touring.

352
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,428
You know, before...

353
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:12,015
Benefits of being married
to a travel writer, I suppose.

354
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:14,352
Yes, exactly.

355
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:16,853
What?

356
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:19,815
You're just so full of surprises.

357
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,609
Liking wine is hardly a surprise.

358
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,569
I just... after our last date,

359
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,947
I didn't think I was getting another.

360
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:28,990
Oh. Oh, Paul,

361
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,951
I'm sorry.

362
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,786
I didn't mean to make you feel that way.

363
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:35,705
It wasn't you. It was just...

364
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,415
a lot.

365
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,917
No, it's fine.

366
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,461
I-I thought maybe
you weren't ready to date again,

367
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,171
which would have been understandable,

368
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,633
what with everything
you've been going through and...

369
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,471
Paul, I want to be here tonight.

370
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,143
I appreciate you being honest with me.

371
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,519
Oh.

372
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,354
- Of course.
- Mm.

373
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,856
Ooh!

374
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,607
There's that wet earth.

375
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,902
Ooh, mmm.

376
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,238
- Paul?
- Debbie?

377
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:12,951
We've known each other for years.

378
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,745
But... you don't know me.

379
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,915
Not really. And I don't want to lie to you

380
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,834
like Nolan lied to me.

381
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:22,460
I...

382
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,171
uh...

383
00:24:24,172 --> 00:24:26,131
Okay.

384
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,676
Nolan wasn't a travel writer.

385
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,096
And he's not dead.

386
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,149
So all that stuff in Chicago,

387
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,234
that was Nolan and Mark?

388
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,611
Yes.

389
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:49,070
And the new kid is from...

390
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,447
Another planet.

391
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:55,410
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

392
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:58,663
No, it's just, I, uh...

393
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:00,541
Maybe I should go.

394
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,793
Wh-What? Why?

395
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:09,049
Well, Debbie, I'm-I'm just a normal guy
with thinning hair and a bad back.

396
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,428
I-I can't fly. I can barely jog.

397
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,639
You don't want to waste your time
with someone like me.

398
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:19,392
Paul, you're so much more than that.

399
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:21,353
You're smart and kind,

400
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,064
and you pretend to like wine
that tastes like dirt.

401
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:27,150
And... I like your hair.

402
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,152
- Really?
- Really.

403
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,490
Mmm.

404
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,533
<i>This is a normal family.</i>

405
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,203
<i>You used to say that all the time</i>

406
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,747
when I was a kid.

407
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,208
But we both know it's not true.

408
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,835
It was never true.

409
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,088
I know my powers make you uncomfortable.

410
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:50,465
Sometimes...

411
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,926
they make me uncomfortable, too.

412
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,971
But they're part of me
and they always will be.

413
00:25:55,972 --> 00:25:59,767
So I'm asking you to finally accept that.

414
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,354
So, this is how it's gonna be?

415
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:06,481
You have powers

416
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,735
so you think you can just deliver
ultimatums to your parents?

417
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:13,154
No, Dad, but...

418
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:16,574
if you can accept
your daughter has powers,

419
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,954
I can accept that you don't want me
to use them in the house.

420
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,083
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop using them to help people.

421
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,711
- Hmm.
- I want us to have a relationship

422
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:32,842
because I love you both
and I know that you love me, too.

423
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,970
But you have to accept me for who I am.

424
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,055
All of me.

425
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:40,890
Otherwise...

426
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,726
I'm not gonna see you anymore.

427
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:48,690
I am tired of feeling like a freak
and a failure every time I come home,

428
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,233
and I don't deserve it.

429
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,903
- Samantha--
- I am serious.

430
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:57,407
That is the deal.
I won't use my powers in the house,

431
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,577
and you won't make me feel bad
for being who I am.

432
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:03,163
Oh, honey, of course we accept you.

433
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,543
Adam, she's your daughter.

434
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,216
All right.

435
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,510
- It's a deal.
- Oh.

436
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,597
Oh.

437
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,558
I need a beer.

438
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,480
Also, is it okay
if I move back in for a while?

439
00:27:28,606 --> 00:27:30,273
I just don't know what it's gonna take
to get through to you.

440
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,026
- Mmm.
- Uh...

441
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:36,780
- Um...
- Oh! Oh, um... you're back.

442
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:39,866
Uh, you... uh, you remember Paul, right?

443
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,453
Hi... Mark. Hi. Hi, Oliver.

444
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:46,748
Uh, the-these are, uh...

445
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,376
We-we were at a comic-book store opening.

446
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:51,669
Are you guys gonna mate now?

447
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,507
Uh, your mom and I,
not sure if she told you, but

448
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,426
we've been talking a lot lately, and I--

449
00:27:58,427 --> 00:28:00,720
Oh, look.
You-you-you boys are on the news.

450
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,597
We are?!

451
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:05,266
Oliver!

452
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,936
I'm fine! It was awesome!

453
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:11,690
Whoa, tha-that's not us. How...?

454
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:16,194
You told him?

455
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,196
- Mark.
- It's okay.

456
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,614
I can keep a secret.

457
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:23,451
I once sold a house to a famous rock star
and never told a soul.

458
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:24,953
Oh, yeah? Who?

459
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,081
Exactly.

460
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,459
<i>With a costume clearly inspired</i>

461
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,711
<i>by Invincible,
we don't know who this new hero is.</i>

462
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:38,133
{\an8}<i>But social media is referring
to him as Invinciboy.</i>

463
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,969
- You're Invinciboy now?
<i>- In other news, stocks took a tumble today</i>

464
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,555
<i>with reports that some of the...</i>

465
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,017
Hey.

466
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,145
How'd it go with your folks?

467
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:52,230
Better than expected.

468
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:55,150
I explained how I felt
and delivered my ultimatum.

469
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:56,734
And?

470
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,572
- We have a deal.
- Yes.

471
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:04,409
That's so good.
Did you tell them you're back at school?

472
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,412
Yeah, oh, and speaking of that,

473
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,581
I ran into Amber on campus.

474
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,332
Oh, wow.

475
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,293
How-How's she doing?

476
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,838
She's good. College life suits her.

477
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,215
You look a little rough, though.

478
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,259
How are you doing?

479
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,761
Where do I start?

480
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,890
Art made new suits for me and Oliver,
so that was kind of cool.

481
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,767
Uh... but then Oliver followed me
into a fight at Payton Penitentiary

482
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,519
and almost got himself killed.

483
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,938
What? Shit.

484
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,440
He's fine.

485
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,651
He was even annoyed that I took out
Kursk and Furnace by myself.

486
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:40,111
But then we got home

487
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,280
and I find out my mom told
her new boyfriend my secret identity

488
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:44,324
without even asking first.

489
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:47,494
Wow, you have had a day.

490
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:50,330
I-I don't think I can do this.

491
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:54,375
How can I be a son,
a brother, a boyfriend,

492
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:56,837
and a superhero all at the same time?

493
00:29:58,172 --> 00:30:00,381
I'm just gonna let everyone down again.

494
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:04,385
Mark... you're looking at it wrong.

495
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,429
Those people who depend on you?

496
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,306
Your mom, Oliver, me?

497
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,476
We're also here for you to depend on us.

498
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:14,062
You're not alone.

499
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,731
Invinciboy.

500
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,651
Aw, man. You saw that?

501
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,402
Saw it?

502
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:24,030
I saved a clip on my phone.

503
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,450
Mmm.

504
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,173
Jesus, I hope that's decaf!

505
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,717
Oh, God.

506
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:48,179
Sorry, Nate.
This place just gives me the creeps.

507
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,390
Well, don't you think
you're being a little paranoid?

508
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:52,559
Y-You didn't see it, okay?

509
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:55,980
The Lizard League tunneled
into the base right here.

510
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,692
And I was part of the cleanup detail.

511
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:03,152
There was so much blood.

512
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,530
So many... parts.

513
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,866
I heard.

514
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,453
But the safest place to stand
is where lightning's already struck

515
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:16,916
because lightning never strikes
the same place twice, you know?

516
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:19,335
Yeah, that's not how lightning--

517
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,799
That was easier than I thought.

518
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,968
That's the U.S. military for you,

519
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,887
always fixing things
as cheaply as possible.

520
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,931
Oh, look.

521
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,100
New friends.

522
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,479
Another stupid, different bolt.

523
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,316
Who designed this piece of junk?

524
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,321
Hey! Watch it!

525
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,115
Nukes don't go off from impact, idiot.

526
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:52,243
They still hurt
if they land on your head, jackass!

527
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:56,080
Here they come.

528
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:58,124
Finally.

529
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,210
Took them long enough.

530
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,465
Give it up. You're outnumbered.

531
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:07,717
- And outclassed.
- And out of luck.

532
00:32:07,718 --> 00:32:10,428
And now I say something.

533
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,013
Where's the rest?

534
00:32:12,014 --> 00:32:14,432
We're more than enough

535
00:32:14,433 --> 00:32:16,434
They've downgraded us.

536
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:20,980
What? We deserve the right
to murder their whole team.

537
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:24,359

{\an8}<i>To recap, the Guardians of the Globe</i>

00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,865
{\an8}<i>no updates since they entered the silo.</i>

00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:56,368
{\an8}<i>We'll continue

568
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:01,831
I don't work for Cecil anymore.

569
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,917
- But--
- You still help people.

570
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,296
Yeah.

571
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,841
Then I guess it's settled. Just...

572
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,344
...be careful.

573
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,390
Why not leave them out there?

574
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:23,227
Let the engine cook them during launch.

575
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,605
You never kill a hostage
before you need to.

576
00:34:25,606 --> 00:34:28,733
Besides, I think they can still
kind of tell what's going on,

577
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,445
and I want them to know they lost.

578
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:36,741
Your sentimentality is
gonna get us killed one day.

579
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,868
Coordinates are set.

580
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,830
Do you concur
that it's time we controlled the world?

581
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:44,041
I concur.

582
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,047
Step away from the computer.

583
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:53,174
Who the hell are you?

584
00:34:53,175 --> 00:34:55,176
That's Invinciboy.

585
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:56,803
I saw him on TV.

586
00:34:56,804 --> 00:34:58,930
He's new.

587
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:01,140
He was new.

588
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,477
Where's Mark?

589
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:06,103
- We're supposed to go flying.
- - <i>There's still no sign of activity</i>

590
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,314
<i>since Invinciboy entered the silo.</i>

591
00:35:08,315 --> 00:35:11,067
<i>I'm told the attackers
have cut all communication with--</i>

592
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,026
Oliver.

593
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,362
Holy crap. Mark's there?

594
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:15,988
Hold on. I don't want you to--

595
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,908
- He might be hurt!
- Oliver!

596
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:30,461
Aw. You want to call for help?

597
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,922
Too bad. You can't.

598
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,174
And no one else will be able to either

599
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,760
once we destroy the entire planet's

600
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:40,763
communications network
with our EMP missile.

601
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:45,101
You'll have to pay
to use our shielded system instead.

602
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:48,896
Oh, we're so much worse
than supervillains now.

603
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,982
We're businessmen.

604
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,068
Huh, look at that.

605
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,154
He's tough for a guy
with "boy" in his name.

606
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,701
Shoot him again and
let's get this thing launched.

607
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,627
You guys are in big trouble.

608
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,463
Did school just get out?

609
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,798
Just get him.

610
00:36:18,802 --> 00:36:20,678
What are you doing here?

611
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,222
Saving you.
I was worried you were dead.

612
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,849
You're both dead.

613
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,697
Get out of here.
I can handle this.

614
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:41,073
So can I.

615
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,170
I said get out of here.

616
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:55,630
I'm fine.

617
00:36:55,631 --> 00:36:57,256
You just distracted me.

618
00:36:57,257 --> 00:36:59,842
I'm not saying we're gonna lose, but...

619
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,595
Just in case.

620
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,235
I'm going after it.

621
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,280
Go home now.

622
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,583
You heard Invinciboy.

623
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,210
Like I said before,

624
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,629
you guys are in big trouble.

625
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,173
We don't usually murder children,

626
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,510
but there's always a first time.

627
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:55,190
{\an8}We warned you, you little shit!

628
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,780
Yikes.

629
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:05,158
You're gonna need surgery.

630
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:08,661
And even then,
I don't know if we can fix...

631
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,827
Holy shit!

632
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:52,997
That's what happens

633
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,749
when you're a bad guy.

634
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,882
I give up. I give up.

635
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,217
I give up!

636
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:06,218
Too late.

637
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:18,898
You...

638
00:39:18,899 --> 00:39:22,068
you...

639
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:23,361
child.

640
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:36,707
I didn't mean it.

641
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,835
It was an accident.

642
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,923
I didn't mean to kill them.

643
00:39:43,924 --> 00:39:45,591
I saved you guys.

644
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,636
They're just stunned, Oliver.

645
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:56,769
Even superheroes
aren't used to seeing kids

646
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,020
do something like this.

647
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:00,731
But I know you were just trying to help--

648
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,987
I told you to stay away from my family.

649
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:10,324
I'm just here to clean up
your brother's mess.

650
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,659
Wait.

651
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,202
Looks like you've been training him

652
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,163
in the family business.

653
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:28,217
What? I stopped them, didn't I?

654
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,137
Sky. Now.

655
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,392
What the hell were you thinking?

656
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:38,687
I told you to go home.

657
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,564
Why are you so mad?

658
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:44,108
We won. I beat the bad guys.

659
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:46,694
You-- I--

660
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,070
You killed them!

661
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,489
I didn't mean to, but now they won't

662
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,283
hurt anyone else.

663
00:40:52,284 --> 00:40:54,869
Didn't you listen to
anything Mom or I said?

664
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,537
We don't kill!

665
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,165
Stop yelling at me for saving you.

666
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,500
I saw the news and
I thought you might be hurt,

667
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:02,960
so I tried to help you,

668
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,379
and now you're mad at me?

669
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,006
Oliver!

670
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:08,883
Oliver, wait!

671
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,568
Damn it, when did you get so fast?

672
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,536
Stop!

673
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,628
Just listen, okay?

674
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:48,214
I get that you didn't mean
to murder the Maulers.

675
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:51,342
You were scared for me
and you wanted to help.

676
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:53,052
You can't just kill people

677
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:54,763
and pretend it's no big deal.

678
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,599
You killed the guy who broke Mom's arm.

679
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,643
That was an accident.

680
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,311
So was this.

681
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:05,064
Oliver, it's wrong.

682
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,608
Why? You and Mom say

683
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:10,194
I need to be responsible with my powers.

684
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,363
Isn't it responsible to
make sure that the bad guys

685
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,073
never hurt anyone else?

686
00:42:14,074 --> 00:42:16,200
Life is precious.

687
00:42:16,201 --> 00:42:18,661
We don't just... take it.

688
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,663
It's not precious.

689
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,831
People kill each other all the time,

690
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,125
and most people
aren't even special like us.

691
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,379
They're just normal.

692
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,215
You sound just like Dad.

693
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:32,841
So?

694
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,510
Why is that bad?

695
00:42:34,511 --> 00:42:36,303
You act like you know everything,

696
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:40,058
but do you ever think that
maybe Dad was right?

697
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,321
- Shit.
- Hey.

698
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,618
Oh, I am so sorry.

699
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:01,537
I can't believe I'm late
to our first date.

700
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:04,164
It's okay. I saw the news.

701
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,792
No, it's-it's supposed to be special and--

702
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:09,211
Mark, stop.

703
00:43:09,212 --> 00:43:11,213
We both know how this works.

704
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:14,467
Really?

705
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:17,970
Really.

706
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:20,764
How'd I get so lucky?

707
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:22,224
I don't know.

708
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:27,730
Well, Cecil made sure
this wasn't in the news,

709
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,815
but Oliver followed me
to the missile silo.

710
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,025
He saw the Maulers

711
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:34,361
attacking me and he just... killed them.

712
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:36,488
What? Oh, God.

713
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:37,823
Yeah. I mean maybe

714
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:39,325
killing the first Mauler was an accident,

715
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,828
but the Immortal told me
the second surrendered first.

716
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:44,914
What are you gonna do?

717
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,333
I don't know.

718
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:54,340
I am not trying to minimize what he did,

719
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:56,217
but he's just a kid...

720
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:59,763
...with powers he doesn't know
how to control yet.

721
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:02,806
Yeah, but...

722
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:05,643
he doesn't seem sorry or upset about it.

723
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,022
Just like my dad.

724
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:18,322
I don't know what I'm doing, Eve.

725
00:44:18,323 --> 00:44:20,741
I don't know how
to raise a kid like Oliver.

726
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,034
You're forgetting about your mom.

727
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:25,079
She did a pretty good job with you.

728
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,122
That was before
she outed my secret identity

729
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:28,917
to her new boyfriend.

730
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:32,586
You lost your dad,

731
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,464
but she lost her husband.

732
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:39,510
Doesn't she deserve someone in her life?

733
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:42,137
And, yeah, she told Paul
who you are, but honestly,

734
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,305
who is he gonna tell?

735
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:45,266
Who would even believe him?

736
00:44:47,394 --> 00:44:49,270
Where would I be without you?

737
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:53,024
Probably still looking for Mount Rushmore.

738
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,985
Sounds about right.

739
00:44:57,362 --> 00:45:00,155
This is a weird first date.

740
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,492
I've had worse.

741
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:08,497
That was a short date.

742
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:12,000
Yeah, we decided to reschedule.

743
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,253
- Where's Oliver?
- Up in his room.

744
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:16,964
I said we were going to have a talk

745
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,799
when you got home.

746
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,426
Want me to take over?

747
00:45:20,427 --> 00:45:22,136
No, I'm fine.

748
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:23,637
I need this right now.

749
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,431
It helps me feel normal.

750
00:45:25,432 --> 00:45:27,100
Sure.

751
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,893
You wash, I dry?

752
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,271
Works for me.

753
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,942
I'm sorry I was mad about Paul.

754
00:45:36,985 --> 00:45:39,486
You need someone you can talk to.

755
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,238
About everything.

756
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,574
Like I can with Eve.

757
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,118
Yes.

758
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:48,787
And I should've talked to you

759
00:45:48,788 --> 00:45:50,331
about it first.

760
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,044
This is uncharted territory.

761
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,797
For all of us.

762
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,136
<i>You told Mark
that life isn't precious,</i>

763
00:46:04,137 --> 00:46:07,014
that it's okay if some people die.

764
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:09,183
Is that really how you feel?

765
00:46:09,184 --> 00:46:10,810
Kinda.

766
00:46:12,187 --> 00:46:14,104
Do you think my life isn't precious?

767
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,523
Would you care if I died?

768
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:17,900
Of course I'd care.

769
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:18,901
I don't want you to die.

770
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:20,194
I love you.

771
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:21,904
I love you, too.

772
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:24,948
But think about all the other
people on this planet.

773
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,242
They all have friends and families

774
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,827
who would be sad if they died.

775
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,455
So, just because
you don't know these people

776
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,999
doesn't make their lives less important.

777
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,585
Do you understand?

778
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:39,214
The Maulers didn't have friends or family.

779
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:44,843
I understand.

780
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,971
I won't do it again.

781
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,975
You need to really mean it.

782
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,061
I do, Mom.

783
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,605
Okay.

784
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,274
Come here.

785
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,777
Huh?

786
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:07,033
Gotcha.

787
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,248
Mark, are you okay?

788
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,417
What was that?

789
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,753
I don't know.

790
00:47:26,261 --> 00:47:28,053
<i>Come here.</i>

791
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,489
Such a happy family.
