[Allen] <i>I'm not leaving here without you.</i>

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:06,465
[Nolan] <i>And I'm never leaving.</i>

3
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:07,508
[Allen] <i>Can we just talk about this</i>

4
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,677
<i>before we, uh...?
Well, that sucked.</i>

5
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,471
-[Nolan] <i>You're alive?</i>
-[Allen] <i>This is progress.</i>

6
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:13,514
<i>You care about me.</i>

7
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,682
<i>I feel like you're halfway
to joining the cause.</i>

8
00:00:14,765 --> 00:00:16,976
[Battle Beast] <i>I was promised, this world</i>

00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,728
<i>offered worthy opponents.</i>

10
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:19,812
[Donald] <i>Somebody appears to be</i>

11
00:00:19,895 --> 00:00:21,814
<i>stealing the Declaration of Independence.</i>

12
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,900
[Rex] <i>I'd rather quit
than work with a sanctimonious</i>

13
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:27,027
prick like you.

14
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,113
<i>It's not buried under a mountain,</i>

15
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,948
but it's ours.

16
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,992
Nolan wasn't a travel writer.

17
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:34,201
[Debbie moans]

18
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:37,079
Kid Omni-Man is here.

19
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,873
Oh, geez.

20
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,916
-[Mark] <i>What's this?</i>
-[Art] <i>A fresh start.</i>

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,877
-[Oliver] <i>I beat the bad guys.</i>
-[Mark] <i>You killed them!</i>

22
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,171
<i>I can't believe I'm late
to our first date.</i>

23
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:46,881
Got you.

24
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,678
[Rex groans]

25
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,764
You wanted to come, Rex.

26
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:59,518
Yeah, but I'd forgotten
how boring this is.

27
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,146
Come on, let's go get a drink.

28
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:03,606
We need groceries.

29
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,733
No one's gonna cook for us anymore.

30
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,569
What did you guys do before?
Back on Teen Team?

31
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,572
[clears throat] Hmm... Well...

32
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,324
Eve still lived at home,

33
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,659
Kate kept to herself. Mm...

34
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,870
I stole Robot's credit card number

35
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:19,830
and I lived off delivery pizza,

36
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,291
ramen noodles, and black coffee.

37
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,127
[laughs] I almost got scurvy once.

38
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:26,420
[munching]

39
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,381
I wouldn't be quite so proud of that.

40
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:31,509
Eh, rock and roll star,

41
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:33,594
rock and roll lifestyle, you know.

42
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,430
[chuckles] Oh, what about you?

43
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,682
Oh, my parents had me
on an engineered diet

44
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,268
since before I could eat solid food.

45
00:01:41,352 --> 00:01:42,353
[sighs]

46
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:44,104
Weird that a girl who could shrink

47
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,689
had to watch her weight.

48
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:50,611
So, you're actually gonna
make us dinner tonight?

49
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,112
I'm gonna try.

50
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,948
Is this a zucchini or a cucumber?

51
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,075
Uh, I didn't even get that far.

52
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,705
So, wait, you know how to cook?

53
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,874
No, but that's what the Internet's for.

54
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:08,003
Come on, I bet Robot's
credit card still works.

55
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,505
You don't have to eat it.

56
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:13,092
And you don't have to make it.

57
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,927
I want to make dinner, Rex.

58
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,722
I want to buy groceries,
prepare a meal, and then eat it.

59
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:21,684
You can either help or you can...

60
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,186
I don't know, go do something else.

61
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,362
[Rae gasps]

62
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,239
-[laughs]
-Rex.

63
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,117
[mumbling] Ha!

64
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,369
Parmesan cheese. I like cheese.

65
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,496
How about I'm in charge of that, okay?

66
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,541
You want to be in charge of cheese?

67
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,376
Hell, I'll take butter, too.

68
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,752
Ooh, and milk.

69
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,838
All the cow-type stuff.

70
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,632
You mean dairy?

71
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,802
Ah, whatever you want to call it,
I got it covered.

72
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,470
[explosion]

73
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,680
Huh?

74
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,348
[people screaming]

75
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,394
[roars]

76
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,690
Someone just signed up for an ass-kicking.

77
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,152
[laughs] Come on, Rae.

78
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:15,738
[groans] Fuck.

79
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,450
[entry bell jingles]

80
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,500
[Robot] Fascinating.

81
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,877
I'm glad you're impressed.

82
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,172
So, it just blew up when you grabbed it?

83
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,008
It was spying on me at my house.

84
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,509
[Monster Girl] Oh, shit.

85
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:40,638
So, someone knows who you
really are and where you live?

86
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,016
[sighs] It's worse than that.
They know about my family, too.

87
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,893
Hey, Rudy.

88
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,604
Wouldn't this go faster
with your undivided attention?

89
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,357
This is about analysis, not attention.

90
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,318
[Robot] And it is not the only
pressing issue on my plate.

91
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,736
[Monster Girl] Don't do that.

92
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,363
It's creepy.

93
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,406
[footsteps approach]

94
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,408
Whoa. What happened to you two?

95
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:03,160
Don't ask.

96
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,498
By the way, we're ordering
pizza for dinner.

97
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,211
Are we, like, too weird sometimes?

98
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,255
Should we just be more normal?

99
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:17,091
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:18,425
[Robot] I'm sorry, Mark.

101
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,594
This is too damaged
to ascertain who built it

102
00:04:20,678 --> 00:04:22,262
or who was controlling it.

103
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:25,099
-I believe that was by design.
-[Mark sighs]

104
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,101
You can't tell me anything about it?

105
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,852
[Robot] It's of Earth origin,

106
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:30,938
and it's extremely sophisticated.

107
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:32,106
That's all.

108
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:34,358
-You should be careful.
-[Monster Girl groans]

109
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,320
[Robot and Rudy] Sorry.

110
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:40,823
Whoever made this
has significant resources

111
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:41,907
at their disposal.

112
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,535
Significant resources, huh?

113
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,536
Hmm.

114
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,539
Shit, I know that look.

115
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:52,084
Tell me you're not about to do
what I think you're about to do.

116

120
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,034
What are you doing here, Mark?

121
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:27,578
Other than costing taxpayers
millions of dollars

122
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,289
and assaulting a government institution.

123
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,207
You know that's a felony, right?

124
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,251
Might even be treason.

125
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,295
You know exactly why I'm here.

126
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:39,798
Do me a favor and pretend I don't.

{\an8}[grunts]

128
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,261
{\an8}You're spying on us again.

129
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,144
Whatever that thing is, it's not ours.

130
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,938
Don't lie to me, Cecil.

131
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,024
If we wanted to spy on you,

132
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,026
you'd never know it.

133
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,444
Maybe think about that the next time

134
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,489
you decide to punch your way
into the Pentagon.

135
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,328

00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,711
Oh, don't let us keep you.

138
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,967
This. This is not over.

139
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,890
Well, that was a terrifying way
to start my morning.

140
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,683
Jesus, look at this mess.

141
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,439
What do we do if Mark decides
he doesn't believe us?

142
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:39,525
We hope to hell that doesn't happen.

143
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:42,319
Besides, it's the truth.

144
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,489
-But we are spying on the Graysons.
-Yeah,

145
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,242
but not with this, Donald.

146
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,869
And I'd really like to know who is.

147
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,789
I'll get the lab boys on it.

148
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,132
Ah, shit.

149
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,889
Sorry I'm late.

150
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,809
Hi, stranger. I thought you forgot

151
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,644
about our second first date.

152
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,771
I was busy committing treason.

153
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:20,482
I'll tell you about it later.

154
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,567
You know...

155
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,653
...I thought this would be weird.

156
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,906
Not just a date but like a date date.

157
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,825
But the weird thing is...

158
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,660
That it isn't weird?

159
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,078
Yes.

160
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,330
Exactly.

161
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,958
[groans]

162
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,502
Oh. Uh...

163
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,379
Did I misread that?

164
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,174
No, no, you didn't, but...

165
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,342
Please tell me that's not a glowing portal

166
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,303

167
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,973

how much I wish I could say that.

[people screaming]

169
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,229
It worked.

170
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,439
We found him.

171
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,441
I told you all that research
would pay off.

172
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,860
[sighs] Seriously? You guys again?

173
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,529
Invincible, you have to come
with us right now.

174
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,698
-It's life and death.
-There's no time to explain.

176
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,659
Nice one.

177
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,369
You know these jokers?

178
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:16,455
They stole the Declaration of Independence

179
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,706
when I was busy saving Rex.

180
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:20,375
Ah, you remember us. That's great.

What? No.

186
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,262
You guys should be in prison.

187
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,556
We had a good reason
to steal the Declaration.

188
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,141

You're lucky we're on a date,

204
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,514

205
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:19,059
Maybe you're not the hero
we thought you were.

206

But you're already here.
We'll prove we're the good guys.

00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,386
And if you help us,

219
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:56,179
we'll give you back
the Declaration of Independence.

Why'd I look so miserable?

to ask those kind of questions.

00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,718
[Drop Kick] Us versus him,

231
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,094

00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,932
You should have known
it was too much for me,

359
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,852
especially after so long.

360
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,229
I... left you to rule?

All of this is your fault!

I didn't want the responsibility.

364
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,492
I was tired, ready to move on.

00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:16,327
-[groaning]
-I told you that.

366
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,829
But you said...

367
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:21,207

Is this about Kate?

374
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:41,436
Did she... die?

375
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:43,438
Kate?

376
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,399
I don't know that name.

377
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:50,487
-I-Is that the red-haired woman you...
-No, not Eve.

378
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,740
Kate. You just got engaged.

379

In-in the past, I mean.

380
00:17:55,658 --> 00:18:00,079
[scoffs] I've had hundreds of wives.

Century after century after century?

384

-No, but...
-Of course you don't.

385
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,890
You were the lucky one.

386
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,892
The gifted one.

387

388
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:30,860
You, you need to repay
the debt you owe me.

What... what do you want me to do?

392
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,956

Be merciful. End my suffering
and the suffering of this planet.

No. Just quit.

Thank you.

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,156
That must have been hard.

Don't thank me.

That's not a reason t-to...
to kill someone.

He'd lived too long.

503

He killed people.

Enslaved the entire planet.

And it was all my fault.

511

the future version of me wasn't me?

Yeah.

00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,767
Well, the future version of you
isn't you either.

[Eve] Yeah.

520
00:25:29,654 --> 00:25:32,073
But it sounds like he was ready to go.

521
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,826
I know that doesn't solve this,

into a giant world-conquering dick,

Okay.

Hi. Um, hello. It's Allen.

716
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,316
Uh, I don't know who's in there,

717
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,443
but there is a party going on outside.

718
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,404
Do you want to bring the punch?

719
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,323
[deep chuckling]

[growling]

721
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,372
Who possesses the courage

722
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,667
to dare free Battle Beast?!

723
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,670
That, uh, that would be me.

724
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:13,547
Um... sir.

725
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:14,923
Sir Beast.

726
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:18,135
This party you speak of,

727
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:22,180
will there be opponents
worthy of my strength?

728
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:23,390
Uh, yes.

729
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:25,809
I-I mean, ab-absolutely. Yes.

730
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,352
Hmm.

731
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:28,562
Viltrumites?

732
00:36:28,645 --> 00:36:31,064
Oh, man, yes. We definitely got them.

733
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:33,442
[growls]

734
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,110
How many?

735
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,362
This is getting very specific.

736
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:38,655
Th-There's like three,

737
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,781
but one's a pal,

738
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:40,949
so hands off him.

739
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:42,284
But the other two,

740
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,494
they're fair game.

741
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,455
"Fair game."

742
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:49,875
This term pleases me.

743
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,960
[Allen] <i>Hold on, Nolan. We're coming.</i>

[Nolan] <i>What? No. Leave me be, alien.</i>

746
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:01,720
[executioner 2] We all know
the stories of the great Nolan.

The wars, the triumphs,

748
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,809
the civilizations you conquered.

749
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:11,021
What sickness could have changed you so?

[grunts]

751
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:14,775
Maybe it was in him all along.

752
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,985
We should investigate his lineage

753
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,987
in case the rot goes deeper.

754
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:28,455
-Yes! Check it out!

756
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:40,842
Was your betrayal worth death?

757
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,680
Answer me!

758
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,223
Yes.

759
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:49,935
And I'm sad you'll never understand.

Come on. He's this way.

763
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,162
You promised me Viltrumites.

764
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:14,167
These creatures offer me
no challenge whatsoever.

765
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,627
Yes, I know. Almost there.

766
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,968
I could have sworn this
was the execution room.

767
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,636
[growls] Deceiver!

768
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,888
You have no honor.

769
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:29,182
You promised me a glorious battle,

770
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,060
yet the only worthy opponent I see here

771
00:38:32,144 --> 00:38:33,520
is you.

772
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,896
Whoa. Hey.

773
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,356
Uh, hello? Let's just...

774
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,691
Uh, how about we just calm down?

[growls]

776
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,529
Okay. So it is now obvious to me

777
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:43,947
that was a dumb thing to say

778
00:38:44,031 --> 00:38:44,948
and you don't really do calm,

779
00:38:45,032 --> 00:38:47,242
so I apologize.

780
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,869

Oh, man. You look terrible.

793
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,694
Did you guys do this?

794
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:24,571
That's not very nice.

795
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,408
I told you to go.

796
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,202
You should have listened to him.

Viltrumites.

798
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:34,081
At long last,

799
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:37,042
my thirst for battle can be satiated.

800
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,376
Forgive him, he's a fan.

801
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,587
He's been really wanting to meet you guys.

[growls] Long have I waited

803
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,467
for such a worthy challenge.

804
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,803
I will savor this.

805
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,847
And if this conflict
brings about the end of my life,

Hold on, man.
