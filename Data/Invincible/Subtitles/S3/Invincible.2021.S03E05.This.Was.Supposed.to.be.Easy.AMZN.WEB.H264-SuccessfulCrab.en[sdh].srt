00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,648
Mom, uh, how much does it cost
to rent an apartment?

178
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:52,569
[chuckles] Since when did you
become interested in real estate?

179
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,656
E-Eve and I... um, we were talking.

180
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,034
After what happened with Angstrom,

181
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:00,786
maybe...

182
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,789
it's better
if we shared a place of our own.

183
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,916
Oh.

184
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,377
And you're seeing Paul now.

185
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,130
You know, you'd probably like it better
if I'm not walking in on you both

186
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,965
when I come home from a big fight.

187
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:16,843
[exhales sharply]
You're both adults,

188
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,596
and free to make your own choices.

189
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,974
But I like having you two around.

190
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,770
I know, Mom. I like it, too, but...

191
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,022
can't live at home forever.

192
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,360
But then who's gonna hang out with me?

193
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:37,197
Hey, I'm not-I'm not
leaving forever, Oliver.

194
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,117
I'll be, like, a five-second flight away.

195
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:52,379
When you brought up moving out,
I thought it was just talk.

196
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,840
But you're actually serious, huh?

197
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,508
If we had a place of our own,

198
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,094
we could just be together, you know?

199
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:01,430
Like a grown-up couple
who's in this thing for real.

200
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:03,014
[tender music playing]

201
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,892
That is, if you want to.

202
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:09,563
Nothing would make me happier
than waking up in our own apartment

203
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,065
to your handsome, drooling face.

204
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,318
Wait, I don't drool. Do I?

205
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:18,905
But you're in?

206
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,657
[chuckles] I'm in.

207
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:33,170
[sighs] Now we just have to figure out
how to afford it.

208
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,630
Mm. You already made a treehouse.

209
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,841
You could just make us a cool place
here in the city.

210
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,553
And put it where... the middle of the park?

211
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,598
The city has zoning laws
for those kinds of things.

212
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,476
Oh, right. Well,

213
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:51,271
maybe I can look for a part-time job
or something.

214
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,401
[indistinct radio chatter]

215
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:59,112
[Eve] I know the problems
your prison faces.

216
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,991
In the past year, Payton's had five riots,
three escapes

217
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,785
and too many attempted breakouts
to count.

218
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:09,581
How can I help you, Ms. Wilkins?

219
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:11,583
I get it.

220
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,710
You're suffering from overcrowding,

221
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,047
a criminally slow response from the GDA
during emergencies,

222
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,174
and a serious lack of funding.

223
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,343
None of that is your fault.

224
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,513
I'm here to offer you a solution.

225
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,431
Go on.

226
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:29,684
A superhero on retainer.

227
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:34,356
Available and ready to handle
any and all supervillain-related problems.

228
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:36,566
He can fly, he's got super strength

229
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,443
and he's practically invulnerable.

230
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,613
In fact, he stopped a breakout here
not too long ago

231
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,533
with minimal damage and zero casualties.

232
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,118
Imagine having someone of that caliber

233
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:50,038
just a text away, 24/7.

234
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,375
What company are you with again?

235
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,001
You look 19.

236
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,421
I'm the owner of a private security firm.
We're called...

237

00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,146
Uh, first call's free.

240
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,693
You failed!

241
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,445
You asked me to break Multi-Paul
out of prison,

242
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:25,282
and out of respect,
I hired a team to do it.

243
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,701
But the job went sideways.

244
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:30,161
Then try again.

245
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:32,664
[clears throat] No.

246
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,710
Or at least not now.

247
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,920
There's too much heat.

248
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,381
They've still got that
anti-teleport field up

249
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,842
and my sources say
the prison just hired a superhero

250
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,760
as their new guard dog.

251
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:49,180
Find a way to get my assassin back.

252
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,475
You have 24 hours.

253
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,228
And if I don't?

254
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,522
I hear little Fiona's

255
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,774
becoming quite the entrepreneur.

Nessa, where's Fiona?

261
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,874
Rodrigo drove her back an hour ago.

262
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,667
What did I tell you?

263
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,879
The expansion on the east side
was the right move.

264
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,757
-Fiona!

-Daddy?

Oh, sweet thing.
How was school today?

267
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:32,557
Everything okay?

268
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,227
School was great.
We had a math quiz and I got an A.

269
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,480
And I sold all my cookies.

270
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,231
That's my girl.

271
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,860
A tiny old man with a metal mouth
bought 'em.

[dramatic music playing]

273
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:50,492
You're staying at home with your mom
until I tell you otherwise. Got it?

274
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,203
Am I in trouble?

275
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,997
No, baby, it's just business.

276
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,457
Honey, what's going on?

I don't even know
how to set up my email,

280
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,341
and you created a whole business.

Thank me after we get our first paycheck.

And once I finish my classes,
I'll be out there with you.

284
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:18,728

I was just... Hmm?

Oliver's gone.

291
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,371
If Liu wants Multi-Paul so bad,

292
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,123
why doesn't he go get him himself?

293
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,876
Yeah, he wants Paul back,
but it's about more than that.

294
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,129
It's also him seeing
if you're gonna play ball

295
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,714
with The Order or not.

296
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,092
If you're gonna be a good boy
and do as you're told.

297
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,510
He crossed the line.

298
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:54,597
Boss, uh...
there ain't no line with The Order.

299
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,350
You think Multi-Paul
is their only assassin?

300
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:01,271
Hell, last guy who went up against Liu
got eaten.

301

Came out as fuckin' dragon shit.

302
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,819
How'd an asshole like Machine Head
survive as long as he did?

303
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,239
Believe it or not, he can shut up
when he has to.

304
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,367
But he was always angling for Liu's seat.

305
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,328
Wanted to run The Order himself.
[chuckles]

306
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,873
There ain't a game
more dangerous than that.

307
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:26,755
What if someone took him?

308
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,757
Could be whoever was spying on us.

309
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,216
We don't know that yet.

310
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,720
[Mark sighs] Maybe Robot could help?

311
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,390
Shit, do I need to call Cecil?
He's got cameras everywhere.

312
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,725

-Wait.

It's not fair. You can fly.

You got to do it
without using your powers.

Okay, okay, no flying.

Come on, you got this.

And they're just... playing.

338
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:53,883
Of course he made friends, Mark.
He's a kid.

339
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,386
It's just too bad
he had to sneak out to do it.

340
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,887
[teen boy] Beat it, shrimps.

341
00:18:57,971 --> 00:18:59,514
It's past your bedtime.

342

Nuh-uh. We were here first.

Duh. Why the hell are you purple?

345
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:12,277
Let's go. I'm-I'm getting tired anyway.

346
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,696
We're not leaving. You leave.

347
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:15,738
Oh!

734

I don't know.

742
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,549
What else could you have done?

743
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:47,636
You couldn't let Titan
break Multi-Paul out of prison.

744
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,679
Yeah. Instead,

745
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:52,307
I just helped him kill his biggest rival.

746
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,477
And almost died doing it. Again.

747
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,979
It would have been worse
if we'd done nothing.

748
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,815
That dragon could have killed everyone.

749
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,025
Plus, Multi-Paul's still behind bars

750
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:04,361
and the warden
thinks we did an acceptable job.

751
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:08,240
After I helped
rebuild the damage to her prison.

752
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:10,075
At least you accomplished something.

753
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:14,037
Hey, we got paid enough
for at least three or four months' rent.

754
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:16,998
About that. Maybe we should...

755
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:18,917
Hold off on the apartment?

756
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:23,421
With Oliver sneaking out,
it just doesn't feel right

757
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,966
to leave my mom
to look after him by herself.

758
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:27,968
He's my responsibility, too.

759
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:31,763
You don't need to explain.
I get it.

760
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:33,181
You're not upset?

761
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:35,851
No, of course not.

762
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,436
But as long as we're talking,

763
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,481
I have been feeling like
things were moving...

764
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:43,108
kinda fast.

765
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,819
With my classes and us dating
and everything,

766
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,155
it's been... it's been a lot of changes.

767
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:50,282
And...

768
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:52,826
I wouldn't mind slowing down.

769
00:40:52,909 --> 00:40:54,661
Hey, I get it, too.

770
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,413
[gentle music playing]

771
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,124
Now that we don't
need to pay rent anymore,

772
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,501
should we still keep Invincible Inc.?

773
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:05,297
Uh, those Séance Dog collectibles
aren't gonna pay for themselves.

774
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,135
[Debbie clears throat]

775
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:11,469
Hey, Mom.

776
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,222
Did Oliver sneak out again?
I'll find him.

777
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,016
No, he's in bed, reading.

778
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,143
We had a good talk about it.

779
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,811
You were right.

780
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:22,314
Oliver deserves to be a kid.

781
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:26,067
He's different, but he's, oh,
he's still just a kid.

782
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,195
And kids should have friends,

783
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,655
not parents who won't even
let them out to play.

784
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,410
Eve and I are not getting
an apartment anymore.

785
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,953
Oh, thank God.

786
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:43,251
I mean, uh,
is everything okay between you two?

787
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:44,711
If you need to talk...

788
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,505
No, no. Eve and I are good.

789
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:49,090
We just wanted to slow things down.

790
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,967
I hope you're not doing this
because of me.

791
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,928
I can handle myself.

792
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:55,055
Oh, I know.

793
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:57,557
I want to be an adult and protect the city

794
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,142
and be a good boyfriend.

795
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:02,854
And I also want to be here
with you and Oliver.

796
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:05,273
It feels nice living with
a little brother, you know?

797

I don't want that to end just yet.

-Oh, Mark. [chuckles softly]
-[sighs]

801
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,790
Oh, the biggest thing
I've come to learn about adulthood

802
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:24,834
is that nothing is ever black-and-white.

803
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:27,420
So I'd say, in terms of growing up,

804
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,547
you're doing just fine.

805
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:36,680
By the way, just have to say it...
I know you and Eve are having sex.

806

Mom! What?!

807
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,393
It's a natural part of life.
And I want you to know...

808
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,729
Okay! All done, Mom. Great talk.
Okay, good night.

[Machine Head] Oh, it's so good
to be back, amigos.

811
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:07,669
Did you miss me? Don't answer that.

812
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:11,006
Because we all know
the answer is you missed me so much

813
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,050
you didn't do shit about it.

814
00:43:15,427 --> 00:43:18,430
Now, given that I took our poor old friend

815
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:22,183
and previous leader Mr. Liu
behind the proverbial woodshed...

816
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:25,603
and let's be honest,
shot him in the fucking head...

817
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:28,565
that entitles me to his seat,
and therefore,

818
