1
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,250
It's about time.

2
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,166
Try it a little more like this.

3
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:25,166
Did you maybe push too far?

4
00:00:25,208 --> 00:00:26,291
Are you questioning me?

5
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,625
No one else
at scene of murders,

6
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,083
only Omni-Man.

7
00:00:34,125 --> 00:00:36,500
Put an A-6 surveillance team
on the Graysons.

8
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,221
I was thinking
finals are coming up,

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,809
maybe we could
go over everything together.

10
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:40,625
Works for me.

11
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:41,875
Today,

12
00:00:41,916 --> 00:00:44,166
we have lost Titans.

13
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:46,166
It is my pleasure
to introduce

14
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,791
the new Guardians of the Globe.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,375
We have a benefactor,
it seems.

16
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,916
I'd say I'll miss you, brother,

17
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,250
but I can always make
another one.

18
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,833
What are you doing
in my house?

19
00:00:57,875 --> 00:00:59,083
Seeking clues.

20
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,708
Answers.

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,666
Debbie?

22
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:02,666
You all right?

23
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm fine.

24
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:47,375
Your men are too slow.

25
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,708
The desert
is unforgiving, Zaeim.

26
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,750
Heh, not as much
as what's under it.

27
00:01:58,333 --> 00:01:59,125
Move.

28
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:00,291
Out of my way!

29
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:30,375
Master...

30
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,208
soon, you will once again
teach this world

31
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,833
what it means to truly suffer.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,083
Help me!

33
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,250
My God...

34
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,958
he's resurrecting Ka-Hor.

35
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,208
Gain some altitude!

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,958
You're messing up
the desert.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,833
Huh?

38
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,583
Uh... sorry.

39
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,125
And pick up the pace.

40
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,541
You need to push yourself

41
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,500
if you want to build
speed and endurance.

42
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,750
I can't believe I still
have to exercise.

43
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,333
What, you thought being
a Viltrumite was easy?

44
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,708
Show off.

45
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,708
Whoa!

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,291
Whoa, whoa!

47
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:49,166
Okay, okay,

48
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,291
let's take a break.

49
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,458
Now you're talking.

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,625
Last one to Mount Everest
does the dishes for a week.

51
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,666
Go!

52
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,125
Yeah!

53
00:03:58,125 --> 00:04:00,166
Wait... where's Mount Everest?

54
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:02,708
It's the high one!

55
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,458
Whoa!

56
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,541
Take deep breaths, buddy.

57
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:25,250
The air's thin up here.

58
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,375
No... kidding...

59
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,458
What the fuck?

60
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,833
Hi. Sorry.
It's okay.

61
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:32,875
I'm...

62
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,000
Sometimes, I forget

63
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:41,625
how beautiful
this planet can be.

64
00:04:41,666 --> 00:04:43,625
Too bad the human race

65
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,958
is hell-bent
on destroying it.

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,041
Good thing
they got us, right?

67
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,041
Huh.
Yeah, I guess.

68
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,458
So, is Viltrum that different?

69
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,916
Oh, it's very different.

70
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,416
We've ended wars
all over the universe,

71
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,250
brought peace
to thousands of galaxies,

72
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,750
lifted alien races
out of the mud

73
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:04,208
and into the future.

74
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,375
It's why I'm here
on Earth.

75
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:07,833
It's why you're here.

76
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,226
I still can't believe
you left everything

77
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,166
to come help a planet

78
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,458
you'd never even
seen before.

79
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,791
I told you,
I was part of the...

80
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,934
...world betterment committee.

81
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,125
Yeah, I know,

82
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:17,041
but that's still
not a reason.

83
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:22,708
Well, when
your grandparents died,

84
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,416
I was lost
for a long time.

85
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:29,416
They were
the only family I had.

86
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,500
Coming here
felt like a chance

87
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,125
to build something new.

88
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,458
You mean,
like with Mom?

89
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,041
Yeah, your mom
changed everything.

90
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,500
She turned this place
from a job to a home.

91
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,708
Then you came along
and changed it all again.

92
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,708
Huh.

93
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,500
I don't know
if I could do that.

94
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,458
Do what?

95
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,625
Leave everything behind.

96
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,833
Hey, keeping
the universe safe,

97
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:55,625
living up to
our people's heritage,

98
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:57,708
it takes sacrifice, Mark.

99
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,625
That's what
I'm trying to teach you.

100
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,625
Sure. I get that.

101
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:03,958
Okay.

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,208
All right,
one more round, huh?

103
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,059
Last one home takes out
the garbage for a month...

104
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,291
Ha, ha, ha!

105
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,333
Ha...

106
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,166
Ah, man...

107
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,291
Lies!

108
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,125
The GDA are snakes.

109
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,375
They don't care about us,

110
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:22,625
or my poor Josef.

111
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:23,458
Olga...

112
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,458
No Olga.

113
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,083
I am Russian, my dear,

114
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:27,583
I know how governments work,

115
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,458
and yours is no different.

116
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,875
Cecil's searching
for the killer...

117
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,208
Is he?

118
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,458
No one is in jail.

119
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,791
No one is on the news.

120
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,291
They know who did this,

121
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,458
and they don't care.

122
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,208
Why wouldn't they care?

123
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,142
I don't know, but I can tell
when people are lying,

124
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,583
and people are lying
about this,

125
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,333
which is why I'm moving
back to Moscow,

126
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,750
to my family.

127
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,750
You can help me
sell my house.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,750
Uh, yes, absolutely.

129
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,458
Olga...

130
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,375
Did Josef ever lie to you?

131
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,625
Of course,

132
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,916
all heroes do,

133
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,083
but I only made the mistake
of believing him once.

134
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:04,166
When he told me

135
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:08,041
everything was going
to be fine.

136
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,750
Boy, I am going to love

137
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,375
not taking out the garbage
for a month.

138
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,291
Yeah, yeah,
quit rubbing it in.

139
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,166
So, I spent all day

140
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,875
teaching our son
to break the sound barrier.

141
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,750
Turns out
the only motivation he needed

142
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,708
was getting ready
for a hot date.

143
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,541
A date? Hold up.

144
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,208
Tell me everything.

145
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,250
It's not a date.

146
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,559
Amber and I
are just hanging out.

147
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,125
Hanging out?
Wow.

148
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,458
Try not to sweep the girl
off her feet too much.

149
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,916
Guess where
they're going?

150
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:31,833
Out.

151
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,125
Ooh, out.

152
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:34,625
Every woman's favorite
destination

153
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:35,625
for a romantic evening.

154
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,458
I don't even know
what we're doing.

155
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,625
She planned the whole thing.

156
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:39,875
Oh, a take-charge girl.

157
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,875
I like that.

158
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,000
Are you both finished?

159
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,166
'Cause I have
six time zones to wash off.

160
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,250
What say we go out,
too, huh?

161
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:49,958
Can't let a couple
of teenagers show us up.

162
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,791
Olga wants me
to sell her house.

163
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,791
Ah, the poor woman's barely
holding it together.

164
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:58,708
She thinks there's a conspiracy
around the murders.

165
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,041
Ah, she needs to quit drinking.

166
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,041
Nolan...

167
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,458
What?

168
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,166
You remember last year's
Christmas party.

169
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,208
She was a wreck.

170
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,583
Mm...

171
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,208
This is, like,
all the best desserts in one.

172
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,541
Right?

173
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,642
I ate way too many of them
in the Philippines last summer.

174
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:19,750
What were you doing there?

175
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:21,083
Helping build schools.

176
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:23,375
It was one of those
group volunteer things.

177
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,250
Wow.

178
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:25,291
How was that?

179
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:26,791
It felt so good,

180
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,750
and it just made me realize

181
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,000
that we're in a total bubble

182
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:32,750
that keeps us from seeing
what the world's actually like.

183
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,625
How about you?

184
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,625
You done any traveling?

185
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,541
Uh, well...

186
00:09:36,583 --> 00:09:38,208
I've been to Mount Everest.

187
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,041
What?

188
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,000
You're kidding.

189
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,708
No, I, uh, visited with my dad.

190
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,041
A father-son trip thing.

191
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,500
That's unbelievable.

192
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:45,708
How did you like Nepal?

193
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,767
Or did you go through China?

194
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,791
Uh...

195
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,791
Wow, those are cool...

196
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,125
boxes.

197
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,166
They're called "bauls."

198
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,375
Um, "b-a-u-l" baul.

199
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,101
I wanted to bring one home
from the Philippines,

200
00:09:58,125 --> 00:10:00,500
but they don't exactly
fit in a backpack.

201
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,791
Maybe this is your lucky...

202
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,583
Oh, my God,
look at how cute those are.

203
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,833
Those are rice separators.

204
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,583
And so reasonably priced.

205
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,791
Thanks.

206
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:16,750
Just imagine all the rice
you're gonna separate now.

207
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:18,791
What exactly do you
separate it from?

208
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,166
Wondered if you'd come.

209
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,166
You were in my house.

210
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,666
You frightened my wife.

211
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:34,083
You murdered seven people.

212
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,541
Maybe it was you.

213
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,708
Maybe you came
to finish the job you started

214
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,041
with the Guardians.

215
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,625
You're the demon after all.

216
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,791
Hmm...

217
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:45,791
and demons know evil
when they see it.

218
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,416
If you threaten my family again

219
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,708
with your conspiracy theory
bullshit...

220
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,958
You'll kill me?

221
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,125
I won't have to.

222
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,517
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

223
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,958
Me or you.

224
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,250
Won't give up, Nolan.

225
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,833
Can't hide truth.

226
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,333
Wife already suspects.

227
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,916
How long until son does, too?

228
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,125
Go fuck yourself, Darkblood.

229
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,791

Hey, Tin-man!

264
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,541
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
were you napping?

265
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,208
I was defragmenting, Rex.

266
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,291
Okay, well, quit it.

267
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,750
You don't want to miss this.

268
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,833
Welcome to our new digs, baby.

269
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,583
I can't believe
I'm actually here.

270
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:16,666
Huh.

271
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,083
Whoa.

272
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,333
Good to be home again.

273
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,625
If I have to hear one more time

274
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:30,416
about how
you're an original member

275
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:31,375
of the Guardians
of the Globe...

276
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,833
You'll do what, exactly?

277
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,166
I dunno,
probably explode something.

278
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,333
Ooh!
Maybe your nuts?

279
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,125
Is it weird
that I'm nervous?

280
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,250
No.

281
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,250
I am, too.

282
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,708
Pick up your jaws.

283
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,958
You're not tourists.

284
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,166
This isn't a holy site.

285
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,666
This is your job.

286
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:50,333
The sooner you get up to speed,
the sooner people stop dying.

287
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,458
Hey, Cecil.

288
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,416
Uh...
you missed a spot?

289
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,333
Left that one there
as a reminder.

290
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,916
When you
prove yourselves worthy

291
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:06,625
of the heroes
who came before you,

292
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,416
it'll get cleaned off.

293
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,041
Until then, stare at it

294
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,625
whenever you think
you're hot shit.

295
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,583
Sir, Omni-Man is here.

296
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,583
He's asking to see you.

297
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,750
Settle in.

298
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,250
We'll talk later.

299
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,875
We're cool, right?

300
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:22,916
What?

301
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,208
Oh, you mean

302
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,250
after you knocked out
three of my teeth

303
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,583
and gave me a concussion

304
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:30,375
in front of the entire
superhero community?

305
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,166
Mm, you did kinda ask for it.

306
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,041
Yeah...
I guess I did,

307
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,000
but you know what,

308
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,000
all those other heroes,

309
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,000
total assholes anyway.

310
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:39,833
Huge assholes, right?

311
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,958
Oh, yeah, gaping, dirty,
filthy assholes...

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,083
Okay, that's fine.

313
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,958
Rex, please do not allow
your personal

314
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,125
and professional lives

315
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,125
to intersect.

316
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,375
Alienating Atom Eve

317
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,583
was the direct result
of your lapse in judgment.

318
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,333
Do not repeat it
with Monster Girl.

319
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:57,333
Tell you what,

320
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:59,083
when you grow a pair, Robot,

321
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,666
you can tell me
how to swing mine.

322
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:03,000
This isn't relationship
advice, Rex.

323
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:03,833
This is an order.

324
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,083
What, are you crazy, man?

325
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,791
She looks like she's 14!

326
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,625
Besides,
now that I'm a Guardian,

327
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,916
I can bang anyone I want.

328
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:11,916
Good.

329
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,333
I'm glad we have
an understanding.

330
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,250
Ow!
What the hell?

331
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:17,416
Oh, I'm sorry.

332
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,833
I must have pinched a nerve.

333
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,666
I forget how soft humans are.

334
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,875
Hey, you've been
working all night.

335
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:33,958
You're one to talk.

336
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,083
Where were you?

337
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:35,916
Eh, the usual.

338
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,583
Teaching someone a lesson.

339
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,666
How about we go to bed?

340
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:40,625
Nolan...

341
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,416
Okay, what's going on?

342
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:44,750
Nothing.

343
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,041
Just... work stuff.

344
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,375
Come on,
you're the wife

345
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,291
of the most powerful man
on Earth.

346
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:52,208
You shouldn't have
to deal with work stuff.

347
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,125
Did you seriously say that?

348
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,208
What?

349
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,458
I'm not just your wife, Nolan.

350
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,125
That's why
I deal with work stuff.

351
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,250
I like dealing with work stuff.

352
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,625
Yeah, and I love that
about you...

353
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,291
Oh, please,
don't give me that shit.

354
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:06,541
Shh...

355
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,125
Don't you dare shush me...

356
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,041
Nolan!

357
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,583
No... Nolan.

358
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:21,916
Hey.

359
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:24,083
Sorry.

360
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,958
I meant to teleport
to your front door,

361
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,583
but this thing isn't exactly
Swiss in its precision.

362
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:31,583
I almost killed you.

363
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,458
Yeah, I noticed.

364
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,125
Didn't expect you
on me so fast.

365
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,208
Yeah, I'm a little jumpy.

366
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,541
Maybe you can understand that.

367
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,916
Why are you here, Cecil?

368
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,875
That was the best night
of my life.

369
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,250
I mean, no one's done
a study yet,

370
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,708
but I feel safe going out
on a limb here and...

371
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,708
Too much?

372
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:50,833
Yeah...

373
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,791
but I like it.

374
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:55,458
I expect to feel
the same way next time.

375
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,000
When you plan the date.

376
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,083
That...

377
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,041
sounds like a commitment
to a second date?

378
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,101
♪ Let's do this right
let's do this right ♪

379
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,125

387
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,166
Hey...

388
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,666
Uh, what's going on?

389
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:37,791
NASA's about to launch

390
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,416
the first manned mission
to Mars.

391
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,250
Yeah, I saw that.
It's cool.

392
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:43,333
I need your father
to shadow the mission

393
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,125
and make sure
nothing goes wrong.

394
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:46,500
Only, he won't do it.

395
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,708
I'm busy training
my son, Cecil,

396
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,500
and with the Guardians gone,

397
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:51,750
I'm needed here on Earth.

398
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,000
If I didn't know better,

399
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,958
I'd say you were
trying to get rid of me.

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,208
It's because of
the Guardians' massacre

401
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,708
that I want you
on this mission.

402
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,767
The planet needs
a win right now,

403
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:00,833
and this is it.

404
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,666
You think people
are gonna care about Mars

405
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,041
if there's an attack
on Earth,

406
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,184
and I'm not here
to save them?

407
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:06,291
I think they're gonna care

408
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,253
if the first four people
to walk on another world

409
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:09,625
end up dying there.

410
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:13,000
My priority is to my family
and this planet.

411
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:14,291
End of story.

412
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:15,666
I guess this is the part

413
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:16,958
where I volunteer?

414
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,375
I mean, that's what happened

415
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,583
last time you came here
asking Dad to go to space.

416
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,541
Yeah, that was the moon, Mark.

417
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:23,833
That hardly counts as space...

418
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,767
You were just teaching me
I've got responsibilities.

419
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:26,750
Isn't this one of them?

420
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,250
Your responsibilities
are bigger

421
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,708
than four astronauts,

422
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,083
and Cecil
didn't ask you to go.

423
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,333
He asked me.

424
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,000
If the kid wants to go,
he'd be doing humanity a favor.

425
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:37,500
Debbie, help me out here.

426
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,791
I don't like
Mark missing school,

427
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,625
but I can't think
of a better reason

428
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:42,833
than keeping people safe.

429
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,750
How much school
am I really gonna miss?

430
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,431
I can zip up to Mars
and be back tomorrow.

431
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,958
The fact that you don't know
how far away Mars is,

432
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,291
is exactly why
you shouldn't be missing school.

433
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,375
It's a two-week mission.

434
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:54,541
Two weeks?

435
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:55,916
Dad's right, I'm not ready.

436
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,916
Things with Amber
are going really well.

437
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,041
Sweetheart...

438
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,750
Lots of people
are going to tell you

439
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,333
how to use your powers,

440
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,791
but it's up to you
to make these decisions.

441
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,166
You need to decide

442
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,041
what kind of hero
you want to be.

443
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,416
I'll do it.

444
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:18,125
Well, pack a lunch, kid.

445
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:19,625
You leave tomorrow.

446
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,291
Sir, we wanted
Nolan off-planet

447
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,250
so we could investigate him
for the murders

448
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,125
without arousing his suspicion.

449
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,625
What does sending Mark away
get us?

450
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:31,541
A chance to see
what this kid can do,

451
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:32,791
and more importantly,

452
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,142
if his heart's
in the right place.

453
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,375
And if it isn't?

454
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,000
One nightmare scenario

455
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:39,125
is enough to worry about
right now, Donald.

456
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:45,791
I don't want to lie
to Amber,

457
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:48,375
but I can't tell her
the truth either.

458
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,250
This is why dating
regular people

459
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:51,375
is a pain in the ass.

460
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:54,041
Sure, but it's not like
dating Rex worked out...

461
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,791
Changing the subject now.

462
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,208
As much as I'd love to help
with your very special crisis,

463
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,375
I've got my own crap
to deal with now.

464
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:05,666
I'll make you a deal.

465
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,791
You help me
with my Amber stuff,

466
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,291
I'll help you
with your Rex stuff...

467
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,083
It's not just Rex, Mark.

468
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,125
It's everything.

469
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,916
It's my parents,
and school, and college,

470
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,583
and I don't know
if being a superhero

471
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,041
is what I want to do
right now.

472
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:21,041
But what else would you do?

473
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:22,583
I don't know.

474
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,791
That's the problem.

475
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,416
I guess...

476
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,708
If you need anything
or want to talk about it,

477
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:29,750
I'm here.

478
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,434
After I get back from Mars,
I mean.

479
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,791
Thanks.

480
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,333
Look, once you tell someone
your secret identity,

481
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,416
that's it.

482
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:44,041
So if you're going
to tell Amber the truth,

483
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,041
you'd better be serious
about her.

484
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,208
Are you serious
about her, Mark?

485
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,958
...the weather
continues to hold

486
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,642
and we've been told
everything's looking good

487
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,458
as we enter
the last few minutes

488
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,934
before the launch...

489
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,708
...of the Mars mission shuttle.

490
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:02,708
Mark?

491
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,125
I figured
you'd need something

492
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,208
to store
your rice separator in,

493
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:10,166
and I found some extra change
in the couch, so...

494
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,750
That's very thoughtful.

495
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,500
Thank you.

496
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,375
Come on in.

497
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,375
Listen, um, Amber.

498
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,625
I'm, uh...

499
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:20,625
I'm...

500
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:21,458
You're what?

501
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,833
Volunteering,

502
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:23,958
just like you.

503
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,458
I'm-I'm going away
and helping people

504
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,458
for two weeks.

505
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,291
What?

506
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,208
Like far away.

507
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,791
Well, that's great.
When?

508
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:35,000
...just under
60 seconds to launch...

509
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,041
Um...

510
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:37,791
Any minute now.

511
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,541
- For real?
- More or less.

512
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,791
Where are you going?

513
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,583
You know, it's desert-y.

514
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:45,208
Hardly anyone goes there, um...

515
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,809
There's almost no buildings
or anything.

516
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,059
You don't know
where you're going?

517
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:49,458
I signed up last minute.

518
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,458
...the firing sequence

519
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,416
is armed and ready...

520
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,916
Amber, you're incredible,

521
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,267
and you make me want to be
a better person,

522
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,541
so at the risk of sounding
totally desperate,

523
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,375
please don't lose interest in me
while I'm gone.

524
00:21:59,416 --> 00:22:00,666
I figure you've banked

525
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:03,625
about two weeks
of interest...

526
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:06,833
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

527
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,458
Maybe three.

528
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,583
...six, five, four, three...

529
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,583
I'll bring you back
a souvenir!

530
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,642
...two, one...

531
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,083
And we have lift-off
of the Mars mission.

532
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:18,333
an international exploration
of the red planet

533
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,208
that will broaden
humanity's knowledge

534
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,291
in ways we can only imagine.

535
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,583
Whoa.

536
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,750
Cool.

537
00:22:43,583 --> 00:22:45,458
Cutting it close, kid.

538
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,458
I'm here, aren't I?

539
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,833
Yeah, you are.

540
00:22:47,875 --> 00:22:49,708
Okay, first thing,

541
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,291
stay out of sight
unless something goes wrong.

542
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:55,250
This is supposed to be a win
for human spaceflight.

543
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,375
I'm a ghost.

544
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,458
Second,

545
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,517
the main reason
you're on this mission

546
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,500
is the Martians...

547
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:00,958
What, there are Martians?

548
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,375
Where'd you think
Martian Man came from, Jupiter?

549
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,333
Uh, I...
never thought about it.

550
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,726
We don't know
much about 'em,

551
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,250
but we know
they live underground

552
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:09,500
and keep to themselves.

553
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,791
You shouldn't have any trouble.

554
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:12,791
Just keep an eye out.

555
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,833
Martians.

556
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:15,208
Way to bury the lede, Cecil.

557
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,458
Actually the lede

558
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,333
is "Make sure our astronauts
get home safe.

559
00:23:20,375 --> 00:23:21,708
Humanity's counting on you."

560
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,750
Ugh.

561
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:49,916
It's a waste of Mark's time.

562
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:52,375
It was his decision,
and I'm proud of him.

563
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,083
Isn't this
what superpowers are for?

564
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,416
He doesn't understand
his responsibilities.

565
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:57,916
He's 17, Nolan.

566
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,458
He hasn't had responsibilities
before now.

567
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,375
You know, ever since
Mark got his powers,

568
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:04,333
you've been different.

569
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,666
I'm trying to teach him.

570
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:06,666
You've been distant,

571
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:07,958
annoyed at everything,

572
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,208
and you've been mean.

573
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,666
I've been under
a lot of stress!

574
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,000
You've been talking about home.

575
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,958
You never talk about home.

576
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,375
I want Mark to know his people.

577
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:18,083
I don't even know your people.

578
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,250
I've never even met
another Viltrumite.

579
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,333
I've told you...

580
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,083
You-you've told me stories, yes,

581
00:24:23,125 --> 00:24:24,541
but that's not the same.

582
00:24:24,583 --> 00:24:26,291
You're hiding something from me,

583
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:27,416
and it hurts.

584
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:29,041
Okay, I'm-I'm sorry.

585
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,458
I didn't... I'm not...

586
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,500
You're not what?

587
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:35,000
I never thought
I would have a family,

588
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,416
and then you came along,

589
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:40,041
and I love you

590
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:41,583
and Mark

591
00:24:41,625 --> 00:24:43,708
so much,

592
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,958
but when I see Mark
with his powers,

593
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,666
and after what happened
to the Guardians,

594
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:51,583
I'm terrified
I could lose everything.

595
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,458
Me too.

596
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,666
So what do we do?

597
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:01,625
Well, Mark's gone
for two weeks.

598
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,833
And?

599
00:25:02,875 --> 00:25:05,250
Remember our first trip
together?

600
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,166
Nolan, I...

601
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:10,000
I told Olga
I'd sell her house.

602
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,666
Her house will still be here
when we get back.

603
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,625
Hey, you asked me
what we do.

604
00:25:15,666 --> 00:25:16,708
We do this.

605
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,416
Pack a lunch, my ass.

606
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,666
Sweetie...

607
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:48,916
L'Osteria Donato!

608
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:51,208
I can't believe
it's still here!

609
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,250
Oh, we'll never get in.

610
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:54,000
I made reservations.

611
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:57,250
You never make reservations.

612
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:10,791
Whoa...

613
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:31,541
We are down, Houston.

614
00:26:31,583 --> 00:26:33,583
It's a beautiful day on Mars,

615
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:36,416
and a beautiful accomplishment
for all humankind.

616
00:26:36,458 --> 00:26:37,658
Nice job, Hank.

617
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,791
Did you guys see that?

618
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:43,833
See what?

619
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,083
Eh, never mind.

620
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,625
Ah, maybe not the best
color scheme for this mission.

621
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:28,916
Gah... this sucks.

622
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:43,000
Maybe they have a charger
in the shuttle?

623
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:46,791
What?

624
00:27:51,875 --> 00:27:53,500
Shit...

625
00:27:59,916 --> 00:28:01,375
Julius Caesar,

626
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:03,750
one of Earth's
greatest conquerors,

627
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:05,416
reduced to that.

628
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:08,500
I think Caesar's doing
just fine history-wise.

629
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:09,708
Yeah, I suppose.

630
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,333
God, this takes me back...

631
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,333
It was only a few years ago.

632
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,708
Our first date
was 20 years ago, Nolan.

633
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,875
Huh.

634
00:28:18,916 --> 00:28:21,250
Mostly, I remember you
dumping me right after.

635
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:23,416
Well, yeah, because
you were a dick.

636
00:28:23,458 --> 00:28:24,833
Come on,
I flew you to Rome.

637
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:26,666
Yeah, and you
expected me to worship you

638
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:27,708
because of it.

639
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,416
I was new here.

640
00:28:29,458 --> 00:28:30,458
I got better.

641
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,291
You know what,
you only got a second date

642
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,291
because I saw you
save those kids on the news.

643
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,083
I'm glad we came.

644
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:41,000
But you still feel
something's wrong.

645
00:28:41,916 --> 00:28:42,916
Don't you?

646
00:28:44,208 --> 00:28:46,226
I don't know if it's
what happened to the Guardians,

647
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,041
or Mark,

648
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,625
or if it's just us,

649
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:51,125
but I feel like I'm standing
on the edge of a cliff,

650
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,750
and I'm the only one of us
who can't fly.

651
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:57,250
I haven't been honest
with you, Debbie.

652
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,583
About what?

653
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,250
About the murders.

654
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:01,750
Nolan?

655
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:05,625
Cecil thinks
I had something to do with...

656
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:07,083
what happened to the Guardians.

657
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:09,333
But you didn't.

658
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,541
I'm the only survivor,

659
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,750
and I'm not human,

660
00:29:12,791 --> 00:29:14,750
and Cecil's never liked me.

661
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:16,000
You have to talk to him.

662
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:17,333
I've tried.

663
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:19,000
This could get bad.

664
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:20,291
Oh, god...

665
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,333
What do we do?

666
00:29:21,375 --> 00:29:23,375
We stay together as a family.

667
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:25,166
You, me, and Mark.

668
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,000
All you have to do is trust me.

669
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,416
Nolan!

670
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,000
Do you trust me, Debbie?

671
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:36,083
There's-there's a dragon
behind you!

672
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:37,250
Please.

673
00:29:37,291 --> 00:29:38,333
Do you trust me?

674
00:29:39,291 --> 00:29:40,250
I trust you.

675
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:42,791
You have no idea

676
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,208
how much I needed
to hear you say that.

677
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,458
Okay, now do something!

678
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,041
I'm on vacation
with my beautiful wife.

679
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:53,000
Let Cecil earn his paycheck.

680
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:18,250
Hmm...

681
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,375
Hmm...

682
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,958
Hmm...

683
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:08,375
You can come out.

684
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:09,416
I'm not hiding.

685
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,250
Cecil.

686
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:17,083
Nolan warned us about you.

687
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,208
Shouldn't have any trouble.

688
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,625
Martians live underground.

689
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,208
Hmm...

690
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:52,166
No, no, no, no!

691
00:32:00,416 --> 00:32:02,125
Ah, Jesus...

692
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:18,416
The hell...?

693
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,125
Huh?

694
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,083
Do not move, human.

695
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,333
Whoa!

696
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,375
Hold on!

697
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,833
I'm-I'm not here
to hurt anyone, okay?

698
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:43,833
I'm just here
looking for, uh...

699
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:48,096
You guys need to keep
your dogs on a leash!

700
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,750
I assume those are, like,
Martian dogs, or something?

701
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:53,833
You are unaffected
by the sequids?

702
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,083
No, I am very affected by them.

703
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,458
I can still taste them.

704
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
The other humans,

705
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,500
in white,

706
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:01,500
are they like you?

707
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,416
The astronauts?

708
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,083
I mean, kinda,
but not exactly.

709
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:06,416
Wait, you know where they are?

710
00:33:06,458 --> 00:33:07,500
And you speak English?

711
00:33:07,541 --> 00:33:10,083
We speak Martian.

712
00:33:23,541 --> 00:33:26,500
Welcome to Mars, Earth-man.

713
00:33:26,541 --> 00:33:27,708
Thanks for having me...

714
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,791
Mars-man.

715
00:33:28,833 --> 00:33:30,333
Mr. Mars-Man.

716
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,291
Sir.

717
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,666
Your Highness?

718
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:40,250
What is your purpose here?

719
00:33:40,291 --> 00:33:42,166
It's funny, uh,

720
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,708
I was sent to protect
some of my fellow Earth-men

721
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,416
on a mission
to your lovely planet,

722
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,041
and if they don't get back
in one piece,

723
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:51,250
I'm really gonna
look like a dick.

724
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:52,333
Oh, hey, guys.

725
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,875
Uh, yeah, we don't know
who that is.

726
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:56,791
It was a secret mission.

727
00:33:56,833 --> 00:33:58,083
Well, you suck at it then.

728
00:33:58,125 --> 00:33:59,333
Mistakes were made,

729
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,666
but everything's
back on track,

730
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:02,166
so if you don't mind,

731
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:04,541
we'll get out
of your, um, hair,

732
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,541
and maybe keep
your little squid-dogs

733
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:08,583
under control this time?

734
00:34:08,625 --> 00:34:10,041
The sequids
are the very reason

735
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:11,291
I captured your people.

736
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:13,708
They are
a world-destroying race

737
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,208
who left a trail of destruction
across the universe,

738
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,458
before crashing onto our planet.

739
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,541
Alone, their group mind
is scattered and weak,

740
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:25,500
but with an appropriate host,

741
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:28,166
they become unified
and unstoppable.

742
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:32,750
Our shape-changing abilities
let us resist them,

743
00:34:32,791 --> 00:34:36,958
but if a single sequid
fuses with one of your people,

744
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,333
they would rise up as one
and savage Mars,

745
00:34:41,375 --> 00:34:43,458
and soon after,

746
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,000
Earth.

747
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:47,833
Oh.

748
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,416
Tell me, Earth-man,

749
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:51,791
how are you able
to resist them?

750
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,208
I'm part Viltrumite.

751
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,208
Ever heard of us?

752
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:57,416
I am the Emperor of Mars!

753
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:59,750
Of course, I've heard of you!

754
00:34:59,791 --> 00:35:00,833
Okay, well then,

755
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:03,291
you know we like to help out
wherever we can,

756
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,458
which is why I was sent
to protect these astronauts,

757
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,083
so if you're all good,

758
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:09,875
we'll finish our science
and head home...

759
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,083
Impossible!

760
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,708
The humans are scheduled
for immediate execution.

761
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:17,500
We cannot risk them
coming in contact with a sequid.

762
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:20,500
I understand.

763
00:35:23,625 --> 00:35:26,208
Go! Go! Go! Go!

764
00:35:40,041 --> 00:35:41,958
Grab hands!

765
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,291
Move, move, move!

766
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,791
- Coolant levels.
- Check!

767
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:57,458
- Oxygen levels.
- Check.

768
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,041
Fuck it!

769
00:36:02,375 --> 00:36:04,041
Let's do this.

770
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:28,250
Ha, ha, ha!

771
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,291
Huh?

772
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,916
Um, okay.

773
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:39,083
Can I lift that?

774
00:36:39,125 --> 00:36:40,500
I think I can lift that.

775
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Ow! Shit!

776
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,583
Ow! Ow!

777
00:36:53,375 --> 00:36:54,500
Come on, guys!

778
00:37:08,041 --> 00:37:10,083
No hard feelings, right?

779
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,250
I'm gonna take a rock
if that's okay.

780
00:37:12,291 --> 00:37:13,333
Yeah?

781
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,184
I've been
wanting to go to Mars

782
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,125
since I was a kid.

783
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:23,000
Now I never want
to go back.

784
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:25,708
Never
would be too soon.

785
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,309
...the world's
spirits were raised

786
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:52,416
as the first men and women
to walk on another planet

787
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,000
returned home
after a by-the-book mission...

788
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:15,291
Oh, hey, you're...
back early.

789
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:19,458
Wow.

790
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:26,083
Uh... how was Mars?

791
00:38:26,125 --> 00:38:27,416
By the looks of it,

792
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:30,416
less eventful than
whatever was happening here.

793
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,916
We'd love to hear more
over dinner.

794
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:33,208
Sweetie?

795
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,666
We're having chicken.

796
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:42,083
Mark!

797
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,476
That's the response
I was hoping for.

798
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,791
Wait, you were gone?

799
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:50,541
So, how was it?

800
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:52,500
Well, mostly boring.

801
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,166
Encountered
some local wildlife.

802
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,666
Met the king,
kind of a jerk.

803
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,041
Oh, but I did
actually help people.

804
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:00,458
Not sure how grateful they were,
but whatever.

805
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Huh.

806
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:03,833
That is a strangely
non-specific story.

807
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,708
Check it out,

808
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,458
I got you something.

809
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,125
Ooh, I've always wanted
one of these.

810
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,333
It's, um...

811
00:39:11,375 --> 00:39:13,291
Ugh!
What do they call them?

812
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,125
A...

813
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:15,416
Rock.

814
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,291
...rock?

815
00:39:17,333 --> 00:39:18,833
And not just any rock.

816
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,666
A M-earth rock.

817
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:22,041
It's an Earth rock.

818
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,791
Whoa... even more impressive.

819
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:25,375
Yeah, just make sure

820
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:26,875
you never show it
to any geologists,

821
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:28,875
or anyone who knows
anything about rocks.

822
00:39:28,916 --> 00:39:30,625
They might tell you
something crazy.

823
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:32,125
Well, thank you.

824
00:39:32,166 --> 00:39:35,666
For the beautiful,
regular Earth rock.

825
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:45,375
Guess what Donald found
when we searched your office?

826
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:46,416
Hmm...

827
00:39:46,458 --> 00:39:47,625
Disappointment?

828
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:48,791
Dried blood.

829
00:39:48,833 --> 00:39:50,458
Not much,
but enough to run for DNA.

830
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,041
Hmm.

831
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,458
The Guardians.

832
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,291
Yup.

833
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,541
Planted.

834
00:39:55,583 --> 00:39:57,291
Didn't kill Guardians.

835
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:58,958
Didn't try to kill Nolan.

836
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,958
I know.

837
00:40:01,958 --> 00:40:04,041
But I have to do this anyway.

838
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:15,625
Why?

839
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:16,791
Why?

840
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:17,892
Because you didn't listen to me

841
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:21,041
when I told you
to drop the goddamn case.

842
00:40:21,083 --> 00:40:22,791
Can't excise me.

843
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,958
Destroyed the book
you need for ritual

844
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,125
centuries ago.

845
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:29,541
The Demonius Ex Mortum?

846
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,416
I had a few of my guys
reconstruct it.

847
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:33,375
They used artificial
intelligence

848
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,458
to figure out
the missing words.

849
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,958
Technology, am I right?

850
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,958
"Dominari daemonium meam.

851
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,208
Mitte ad inferos..."

852
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,208
Never thought you'd be the one
to protect him.

853
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,958
See, that's the problem
with demons,

854
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,958
you only see good and evil.

855
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,958
Black and white.

856
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,875
Well, I need to keep things gray

857
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,976
until I can figure out
why Nolan killed the Guardians

858
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,291
and how to stop him.

859
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:01,291
Say I'd see you in Hell,

860
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,708
but there's a worse place
waiting for you.

861
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:21,916
...daemonium meam...
...ad inferos...

862
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,500
Um...

863
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:37,500
Oh, now you care
about the demon?

864
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:40,375
He's not dead,
he's just back in hell.

865
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,208
Isn't...

866
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,416
Isn't that worse?

867
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:31,083
This place is amazing.

868
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:32,750
Why did they decide to sell?

869
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:36,000
The wife had
an opportunity abroad.

870
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:38,000
Oh, that's nice.

871
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:39,208
I think we want it.

872
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:44,000
I'll start the paperwork.

873
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:09,166
Finally, phase one begins.

874
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:11,958
I know.

875
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,333
Two more sales

876
00:43:13,375 --> 00:43:15,333
and I'll break
the monthly record.

877
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,166
If anyone can do it,
it's you.

878
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,250
Oh, did you talk to Cecil?

879
00:43:19,291 --> 00:43:20,291
Yeah, get this,

880
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:22,000
some new evidence came up,

881
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:24,541
and apparently,
I'm in the clear.

882
00:43:24,583 --> 00:43:25,916
He even apologized.

883
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,458
Cecil never apologizes.

884
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,875
I know.

885
00:43:28,916 --> 00:43:31,375
So nothing to worry about.

886
00:43:31,416 --> 00:43:33,625
Everything's fine.
