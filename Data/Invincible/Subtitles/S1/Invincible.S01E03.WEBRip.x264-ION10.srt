[sonic boom]

4
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,291
I've fought the unimaginable

5
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,625
in defense of this world.

6
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,458
I've battled alien tyrants,

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,958
defeated nightmares
from the deep.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,791
Gone toe to toe
with ancient gods...

9
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:54,958
but no matter what threat
I faced,

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,875
I knew I wasn't facing it alone.

11
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,833
Darkwing.

12
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:01,375
Aquarus.

13
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,875
War Woman.

14
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,958
Green Ghost.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,041
Red Rush.

16
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,041
Martian Man.

17
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,708
Immortal.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,875
The Guardians of the Globe.

19
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:16,458
Today, we have lost titans,

20
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,375
protectors,

21
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:20,041
heroes,

22
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:22,625
and we are left to wonder...

23
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,625
who will save us now?

24
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:27,458
I will,

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,708
and so will others like me.

26
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,708
New heroes answering the call.

27
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,208
New champions
ready to risk everything

28
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:38,125
to keep this planet safe.

29
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:42,041
All inspired
by these great souls

30
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:44,625
who came before us.

31
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:47,041
You will have moments of doubt,

32
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,125
of fear,

33
00:01:48,166 --> 00:01:49,958
of uncertainty,

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
but in those moments,
have faith...

35
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,250
and look to the sky.

[woman sobbing]

37
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,166
[Mark] We seriously
have to put everyone

38
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,250
through this again?

39
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:09,375
The big one's for show,

40
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:10,458
but the public can't know

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,833
where the actual bodies
are buried.

42
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:14,541
Souvenir hunters.

43
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:15,958
Jesus.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,125
[Nolan] I was never
a Guardian of the Globe,

45
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:21,208
but it was the Guardians
who welcomed me

46
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,458
when I first arrived
on this planet.

47
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,875
They were my mentors.

48
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:27,791
My comrades.

49
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,708
My friends.

50
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,083
They knew the reality
of this life.

51
00:02:33,125 --> 00:02:36,416
Martian Man was exiled
from his own people.

52
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:38,625
War Woman
was from a different age.

53
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,333
Darkwing...

54
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,583
[chuckles ruefully]

55
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:42,833
[clears throat]

56
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:47,458
Well, Darkwing made
his own kind of solitude.

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,583
It was a rare, lucky few of us

58
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:54,541
who found someone
who understood our path,

59
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,541
even rarer
if they accepted it.

60
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,625
I hope they will rest in peace,

61
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,791
but at least
they will rest together.

62
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,125
[woman sobbing]

63
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,500
Get your hands off me!

64
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:09,500
[screams in anguish]

65
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,958
Olga, please, calm down.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,791
You wouldn't even
let me see him.

67
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:17,458
Josef is finally standing still,

68
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,708
and I still can't see him!

69
00:03:20,916 --> 00:03:21,875
I'd better...

70
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:22,958
Yeah.

71
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:25,708
You okay?

72
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,791
Me? I... I dunno.

73
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,250
It just doesn't seem real.

74
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,333
That could have been my mom,

75
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,333
putting my dad
in one of those holes,

76
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,625
or me.

77
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,208
If this could happen
to the Guardians of the Globe,

78
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,375
it means that none of us are...

79
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,625
[Olga sobbing]

80
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,458
[huffs]

81
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,708
This is a private ceremony,
Darkblood.

82
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,166
[grumbles]

83
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,708
Never get invited.

84
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,500
Show up anyway.

85
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,791
What do you want?

86
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,250
Same as you.

87
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:06,333
Discover clues.
Catch killer.

88
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,875
Bring to justice.

89
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,291
And buy yourself
a few more years out of hell.

90
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,750
Don't pretend you do this
because you care.

91
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:15,916
You just don't want to go home.

92
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:19,000
Maybe one day, you'll know why.

93
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:23,083
I already told Cecil
everything I know.

94
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,000
Saw nothing.
Heard nothing.

95
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:26,791
Attacked in darkness.

96
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,458
Left for dead.

97
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,625
Are you insinuating something?

98
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,958
[grumbles]

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,916
Didn't mean to offend.

100
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:38,291
Nuance of human conversation
difficult for me.

101
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,416
If you remember something...

102
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,625
[Nolan] I'll call you.

103
00:04:42,666 --> 00:04:43,625
[Olga] Josef...

104
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,875
[Debbie]
Let's get you in a car, Olga.

105
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,166
[Cecil] Robot!

106
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,916
You know, for a bunch
of computer code,

107
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,666
you run a mean superhero team.

108
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,791
You really saved our bacon
with those Flaxans.

109
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:55,791
[Robot] Thank you, Cecil.

110
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,541
That means a lot
coming from you.

111
00:04:57,583 --> 00:04:59,416
I know you've always
been independent,

112
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,666
but I want you
to come work for the GDA,

113
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,750
and build me
a new Guardians of the Globe.

114
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,250
Now, you'll pick the team,

115
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,541
you'll be in charge.

116
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:11,208
The only person
that you will answer to is me.

117
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,416
Forgive me,

118
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,041
but would Omni-Man
not be the natural choice?

119
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,083
Sure.

120
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:16,708
Except it's never gonna happen.

121
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,708
I've tried for a decade

122
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,166
to make him
an official Guardian.

123
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,333
He helps out, yeah,

124
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:22,916
but he's never taken orders,

125
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,041
not from me, anyway.

126
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,875
Then I don't know
what to say...

127
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,083
Easy.

128
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,083
Say you'll do it.

129
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,750
[door closes]

130
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,166
I'm feeling pizza.

131
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,333
I can be to Naples and back

132
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,416
before the cheese
stops bubbling.

133
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,375
Honey,

134
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,958
let the delivery guy
do it tonight.

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,791
Sure.

Why don't you call William?

144

And do what?

145
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,041
Hang out?
Go buy comic books?

146
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:05,916
After this?

147
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:06,750
[Nolan] Hey...

148
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:07,875
Watch the tone.

149
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:08,791
[Debbie] It's okay.

150
00:06:08,833 --> 00:06:09,916
It's not.

151
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,708
This is new, I get it,

152
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,250
but you need
to keep that separate.

153
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,500
What happens out there,
the mistakes,

154
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,666
even the victories,

155
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,875
you can't bring it home.

156
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,375
Okay?

157
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,833
Can I go to my room?

158
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,166
[sighs] Sure.

159
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:29,166
Hey, we'll do some more
training tomorrow, okay?

160
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,416
Just you and me.

161
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500

We just came from
your friends' funeral.

Co-workers.

164
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,708
And you're talking about pizza,

165
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,708
and telling Mark
not to feel anything?

166
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,750
This is the life.

167
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,166
Mark has to learn that.

168
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:47,500
What if Mark and I
were burying you today?

169
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,875
I'm not so easy to kill.

170
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:51,083
Yeah, well, I'm sure that's
what Red Rush told Olga.

171
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey, he could run fast, okay?

172
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,625
It's not exactly one of
your premier superpowers.

173
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,041
I'm sorry.

174
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,833
I didn't mean that,

175
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,750
but Mark and I can do
more good out there

176
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:06,416
than sulking in here.

00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,083

Just remember

178

that Mark's a 17-year-old boy.

than you think,

180

a broken family...

372
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,833
you must be compensating
for something.

373
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,250
[laughter]

374
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,583
Somebody ought to teach you

375
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,125
some mother-fucking...

376
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,083
What the fuck?

377
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,583
[glass shatters]

378
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:10,541
[screaming]

379
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,000
Oof!

380
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,416
[groans]

381
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,500
[heavy thud]

382
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,000
Guess you missed my try-out.

383
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:19,416
[growling]

384
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,375
[deep, rumbling voice]
Still think I'm adorable?

385
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:27,875
[groans]

386
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,125
You little bitch.

387
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,000
Aw...

388
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,875
Now, that's adorable.

389
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:43,791
I'm gonna blast that smile
off your stupid, green face.

390
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:46,000
Please, stop,
this is hardly constructive.

391
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:46,875
Ha!

392
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,083
[roars]

393
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:52,291
Uh... is this okay?

394
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,125
He asked for it.

395
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:57,000
[Rex grunting]

396
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:02,916
Okay, enough.

397
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,416
Get lost, boy scout.

398
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,250
[Mark] I said, enough!

399
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,083
[grunts]

400
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,333
[woman] Invincible hit
that little girl!

401
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,166
Oh... shit.

402
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:19,375
Uh, look, I'm so sorry.

403
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,041
Nah, my bad.

404
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,916
The kid thing
sets me off every time,

405
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,750
and then it's like, "Rah!"

406
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,000
Beast mode.

407
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:29,083
Sorry about the dick joke.

408
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,625
I'm sure your junk
is awesome.

409
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,125
[groans] It's fine.

410
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,458
I'm good.
You're good.

411
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,541
You can... punch hard.

412
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,375
[groaning]

413
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:40,791
Didn't need your help, asshole.

414
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,625
[groaning]
Aw, Christ...

415
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,333
[Robot] As I was saying,

416
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,750
welcome to
the Guardians of the Globe,

417
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,750
Monster Girl...

418
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,750
I'm gonna shit blood.

419
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,500
...along with Rex Splode,

420
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,583
once he's recovered...

421
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:56,750
and our final member,

422
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:59,125
Atom Eve.

423
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,166
Thank you all for coming today.

424
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,791
We'll be making
a public announcement shortly.

425
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,833
[Eve] Robot.

426
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,458
No need to thank me.

427
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I obviously needed
to remain impartial,

428
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:12,750
but I'm still delighted

429
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:15,083
so many members of the Teen Team
made the cut.

430
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:18,250
I can't be on the same team
as Rex and Kate.

431
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,541
What? Why?

432
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,541
Hey, wait!

433
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:22,875
Rex, what did you do?

434
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:23,833
[groans]

435
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:26,125
Thanks for the help, Robot.

436
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:29,625
Can't wait to be on your team.

437
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:33,916
Hey...

438
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,375
what's going on?

439
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,750
Rex cheated on me...

440
00:16:36,791 --> 00:16:37,750
What?

441
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,125
...with Dupli-Kate,
all three of her.

442
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,708
Whoa.

443
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,916
Whoa...

444
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,416
I walked in on them.

445
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:49,500
Rex told her you and me
were a thing? Ugh.

446
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:50,666
Huh, what?

447
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,000
That's... crazy.

448
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,958
I didn't want to say it
while you were dating the guy,

449
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,833
but what an asshole.

450
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,625
He wasn't always,

451
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,666
but... yeah.

452
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:00,625
[sighs]

453
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,833
Well, that sucks.

454
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,750
I'm sorry.

455
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,583
Thanks.

456
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,250
As soon as the forensic
investigation has concluded,

457
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,500
we'll be moving into
the Guardians' headquarters.

458
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:17,250
Until then,
we'll be training here.

459
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,208
Breakfast is at 6:00 a.m.,

460
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,583
then close-in combat exercises
until lunch.

461
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,833
Where is Kate Prime?

462
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,833
Had a thing.

463
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,166
I can fill her in.

464
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:28,583
Okay, just to make it clear,

465
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,500
there is no universe

466
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,583
in which I wake up at 6:00 a.m.

467
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,916
and the world isn't on fire.

468
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,666
Come on, Robot.

469
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,458
We don't need
this boot camp bullshit.

470
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,625
It's us.

471
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,875
We're not on the Teen Team
any longer, Rex.

472
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:42,958
Exactly.

473
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,500
I'm sure you've had
a lot of experience

474
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,833
wrangling teenagers,

475
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,875
but I was with
the Guardians from day one.

476
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,583
Wow, thanks, Dad.

477
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,041
Maybe if you didn't
lose your powers,

478
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,666
you might've been there
to help the Guardians

479
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:54,375
on their last day.

480
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:55,625
I don't know you yet,

481
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,625
so I'm going to assume
that was a joke,

482
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:58,958
and I don't need
to beat your ass

483
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,875
until all you wanna do
is call me Dad again.

484
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,541
I don't know you either,

485
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:09,500
but we need a leader
we can look in the eye.

486
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:10,875
Not a bunch of ones and zeros.

487
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:11,791
No offense.

488
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,958
That's actually super offensive,

489
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,875
so wait, you think
you should be in charge?

490
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,583
I am the most experienced.

491
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,958
Yeah, at losing your powers.

492
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,458
Didn't I crack
that joke already?

493
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,125
Why are we even
putting up with this guy?

494
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,666
He wears a suit!

495
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,666
It takes batteries.

496
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,458
Let's just get Eve
back in here.

497
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,166
I'm new
to this whole team thing,

498
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,125
but I thought
it involved teamwork.

499
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,916
As did I.

500
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:37,250
Call me when
you figure it out.

501
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:38,666
I'll be in the gym.

502
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,708
Me too.

503
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,166
I'll go supervise.

504
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,291
[Dupli-Kate] No, you won't!

505
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,458
[Rex laughs] I can do
whatever I like.

506
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,250
Good first day, Robot.

507
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,333
I can't do
three combat exercises a day.

508
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:00,125
I'm on a rather tight timetable
to get this team operational.

509
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,416
Whenever I transform,
I get younger.

510
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:05,333
It's part of the curse
that gives me my powers.

511
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:09,083
I don't look it,
but I'm 24 years old.

512
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,958
I used to go by Monster Woman,

513
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,750
but it got too hard
to explain, so...

514
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,375
if you don't want to start
changing my diapers,

515
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:19,166
three exercises a day
are too much for me.

516
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,416
I didn't...

517
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,666
Of course, my apologies.

518
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:24,416
It must be difficult.

519
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:27,375
Try having a normal relationship
looking like this.

520
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,500
The guys who are interested

521
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,083
are either
going through puberty,

522
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,416
or popping up
on sex offender registries.

523
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,000
I understand what it's like

524
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,666
for the world to look at you
and see one thing,

525
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,166
never knowing the truth
of what's inside.

526
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,416
How can you understand?

527
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,875
You're a robot.

528
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,916
Pathetic.

529
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,208
[William] This has gotta go.

530
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,666
Hide this.

531
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,541
Toss this.

532
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:54,708
What? Stop.

533
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,750
Hey, being a geek
is cool now, okay?

534
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,875
So, maybe Amber
likes comics, too.

535
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,041
You thought of that?

536
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:02,083
Ya dick.

537
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,458
I'm not talking about
the comics,

538
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,833
I'm talking about
the dirty clothes,

539
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,833
the dishes,

540
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,000
the tissues.

541
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,458
Uh...

542
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,166
Better.

543
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,833
Okay, I brought you
some homework.

544
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,041
A little Naomi Klein.

545
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:17,166
A touch of Margaret Atwood.

546
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,500
Some Ta-Nehisi Coates.

547
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:19,333
I haven't read any of those.

548
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,083
[sighs] But she has,

549
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,166
so get started.

550
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:24,625
It'll show Amber
you're interested in her.

551
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,375
She's also into spicy foods,
stand-up comedy,

552
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,916
and fourth-wave feminism.

553
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,416
What?
I read her file.

554
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,625
I asked around at school.

555
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,500
It's just a study date,
not a first date.

556
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,541
Mark, every date
should feel like a first date.

557
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,708
[doorbell rings]

558
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,458
[Debbie] Mark!
Your friend is here!

559
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:45,708
[dishes clattering]

560
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,833
Go! Out the back way.

561
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,083
You can thank me later
when you call me,

562
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,333
and tell me exactly
how it all went.

563
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,291
[Amber] Hi, Mrs. Grayson.
I'm Amber.

564
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,833
Um, William said
I should read it

565
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,708
to show you
that I'm interested-

566
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,083
interesting-

567
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,875
and I will,

568
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,541
but this is more me.

569
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:22,875
An honest man.

570
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,291
I like that.

571
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:25,541
So...

572
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,208
you're into comics.

573
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,625
Is it that obvious?

574
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,333
[chuckles]

575
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:31,375
What's your favorite?

576
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:34,208
Oh, man, I can't pick
a favorite,

577
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,666
but...

578
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,958
Ooh, this one is about a guy
who's an underwater welder,

579
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,500
and starts seeing ghosts
on the bottom of the ocean,

580
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,166
and this one is about
a Jack Russell terrier

581
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,291
who's a master
of the metaphysical arts.

582
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,541
Seance Dog?

583
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:48,708
Cool.

584
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,208
You mind if I borrow it?

585
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,208
I mean, just to show you
that I'm interested.

586
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,416
Yeah.

587
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:55,541
Absolutely.

588
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,458
[Mark's cell phone rings]

589
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,000
Okay...

590
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:04,833
don't know who that is.

591
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,916
Um, I figured we should start
with global issues, and then...

592
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,083
[cell phone rings again]

593
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:10,458
Sorry.

594
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,916
Must be a robo-call.

595
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,791
Ha, this should do it.

596
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,083
So Ms. Walker says
we should focus on the...

597
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,125
[phone rings]

598
00:22:18,958 --> 00:22:21,250
I'm gonna run
and use your bathroom

599
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,250
while you deal with that.

600
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:26,416
Yeah, uh, down the hall
on the left.

601
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,958
[beeping dismiss button]

602
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,916
Whoa!

603
00:22:33,958 --> 00:22:35,583
[sighing]
Christ almighty.

604
00:22:35,625 --> 00:22:37,083
I didn't think
she would ever leave.

605
00:22:37,125 --> 00:22:38,000
Hey!

606
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:38,833
Oh, what are you...

607
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,375
How did you know Amber...

608
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,125
Are you spying on me?

609
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:43,666
You wanna be
a super hero, right?

610
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,208
Fame, glory, get the pretty gal?

611
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,291
I mean, that's sexist, but okay.

612
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,666
Well, then, the whole concept
of personal privacy

613
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,083
or me time? [scoffs]

614
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,375
That's out the window.

615
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:58,375
When the world needs you,
you answer your goddamn phone!

616
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,208
Don't worry,
she hasn't flushed yet.

617
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,958
I don't even work for you!

618
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,208
And you never will,

619
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,125
not unless you show
a little respect,

620
00:23:05,166 --> 00:23:07,958
and decide if you want to be
a superhero or not.

621
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,041
Right now?

622
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,375
Yes, Mark, right now.

623
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:12,708
Okay, yes.

624
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,791
I want to help.

625
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:15,958
What's the problem?

626
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,541
Rogue supervillain.

627
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,458
Public in danger.

628
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,416
Eve's already en route.

629
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,958
Here, so we can talk on the go.

630
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,625
Eve's gonna be there?

631
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:24,666
Oh, did that just
sweeten the deal?

632
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:26,125
What? No.

633
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,208
I mean, um...

634
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,375
Where?

635
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,333
Where is this... at?

636
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,666
Mount Rushmore.

637
00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:35,041
Okay.

638
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:36,625
What state is that again?

639
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,958
What do they teach you kids
in school these days?

640
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,000
Who were you talking to?

641
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:44,291
Oh, um...

642
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:46,791
Yeah, the thing with the, uh,
the phone, it's, um...

643
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:48,333
It was a friend of my dad's,

644
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,458
and, uh...
I forgot I'd promised

645
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,416
I'd help him
with this thing, um...

646
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:55,916
Now?

647
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,625
How's it going in here?

648
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:02,708
I brought snacks.

649
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:06,083
[Cecil in earpiece]
South Dakota.

650
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,916
[Eve] We know where
Mount Rushmore is, Cecil.

651
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,291
[Cecil] I wouldn't be
asking for your help,

652
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,291
but Omni-Man's dealing with
a kaiju ten time zones away,

653
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,791
and the new Guardians
are a shit show,

654
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,458
so here we are.

655
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,875
Target is Doc Seismic.

656
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:19,791
He has a Ph.D. in seismology,

657
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,791
so the doc thing,
that's legit.

658
00:24:21,833 --> 00:24:24,166
Problem is, he made himself
a pair of earthquake gloves.

659
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,500
What's he want?

660
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:26,875
Even he doesn't seem to know.

661
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:28,458
Working theory
says brain damage

662
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,083
from a side effect
of those gloves.

663
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:32,750
He basically gets a concussion
every time he uses them.

664
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:35,583
So your basic
mad scientist deal.

665
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:36,625
Have fun, kids,

666
00:24:36,666 --> 00:24:37,875
and try to remember,

667
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:39,958
that's a national treasure
down there.

668
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,958
[crowd screaming in panic]

669
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,791
[ground rumbling]

670
00:24:46,625 --> 00:24:50,125
[evil laughter]

671
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:57,375
You've come to pray
at this obscene monument?

672
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,708
They were oppressors!

673
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,875
Racists!

674
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,458
Slave owners!

675
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,083
I give you a new god
worthy of worship!

676
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:09,166
Bow before Doc Seismic!

677
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,208
Rah!

678
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,041
Hah!

679
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:13,166
[ground rumbling]

680
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,416
[crumbling]

681
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,000
[panicked screams]

682
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:20,916
Run! This way!

683
00:25:22,666 --> 00:25:24,083
Hurry! Hurry!

684
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:27,333
[laughs wickedly]

685
00:25:27,375 --> 00:25:30,000
The great emancipator?

686
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,541
He'll emancipate you...

687
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:34,375
from your lives!

688
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:38,541
Wow, man,

689
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,333
I'm still working
on my one-liners,

690
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,166
but that one is really bad.

691
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:50,583
Ha ha!

692
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:53,625
That's how you get ahead
in life.

693
00:25:53,666 --> 00:25:55,458
See, it's not quite there,
it's not there.

694
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,625
No argument from me.

695
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:59,250
Now die!

696
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,416
[grunts]

697
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:03,250
Ah, thanks.

698
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,541
Anytime.

699
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:05,833
We need to take out
his gloves.

700
00:26:05,875 --> 00:26:07,083
[Mark] Those aren't gloves.

701
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,333
Gloves have fingers.

702
00:26:08,375 --> 00:26:09,541
They're more, uh...

703
00:26:09,583 --> 00:26:11,041
earthquake bracelets?

704
00:26:11,083 --> 00:26:13,458
Ha! You're wearing
earthquake bracelets!

705
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,875
[grunts with effort] H'yah!

706
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:21,833
Y'ah!
[cackling wickedly]

707
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:24,000
Y'ah!

708
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,875
You should be on my side!

709
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,375
We could tear down
the old power structure,

710
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,208
build a new order!

711
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,750
I mean, look at the costume
they've got you in.

712
00:26:43,791 --> 00:26:46,583
Talk about pandering
to gender roles.

713
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,708
I designed my own costume,

714
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,125
and I thought your doctorate
was in seismology?

715
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:52,958
Undergrad in sociology
and women's studies.

716
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I had a minor
in African Dance,

717
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:55,500
but enough politics!

718
00:26:57,625 --> 00:26:58,750
H'wah!

719
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,666
-[gasps]
-Oh...

720
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,833
[grunts]

721
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:11,250
-Whoa!
-Oh!

722
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:12,750
[ground rumbling]

723
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:17,250
[gasps]

724
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:20,833
[child screams]

725
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:25,875
[screaming]

726
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,875
Mark!

727
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,208
[screaming]

728
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,250
Shit!

729
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:48,500
[screaming]

730
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,625
Bah!

731
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,666
[crackling]

732
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:03,250
[panting]

733
00:28:05,916 --> 00:28:08,250
[grunts]

734
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,791
[yelps]

735
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:12,958
Oof! Oh...

736
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,958
[screams]

737
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:19,375
