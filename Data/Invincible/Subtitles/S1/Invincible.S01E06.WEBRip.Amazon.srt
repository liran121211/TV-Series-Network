00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,125
[Nolan]
Hey, I need my costume back.

2
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:12,125
It's classified,

3
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:13,458
and I want it back.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,500
Am I important to you, Mark?

5
00:00:14,541 --> 00:00:15,916
I'm gonna do better.

6
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:17,208
Maybe if you didn't
lose your powers,

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,291
you might have been there

8
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:20,708
to help the Guardians
on their last day.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,500
I'm not even sure
I want to do this anymore!

10
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,541
Welcome to the world
of the living, Clone.

11
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,375
I need your expertise
in tissue growth.

12
00:00:31,416 --> 00:00:32,666
I'm here for you.

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:33,750
Whatever you need.

14
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:35,208
You want to talk,
I'll listen.

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,583
[Machine Head] Murder.

16
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:37,625
These.

17
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:38,750
Assholes!

18
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:42,125
No! No, no, no!

19
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,541
[Amber] I thought
Mark would be here tonight.

20
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:51,583
I really did.

21
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,250

22
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:03,541

[burps]

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,958
Oh, hey, excuse me.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
'Sup, ladies?

28
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,458
What the hell?

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,416
You scared us,
you creep.

30
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:14,041
Why were you hiding
in the bushes?

31
00:01:14,083 --> 00:01:15,166
Oh, my god!

32
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,583
I wasn't hiding
in the bushes.

33
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:18,916
I was drinking
in the bushes.

34
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,250
But that's not important.

35
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,208
What's important-- [burps]

36
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,666
--is that I'm motherfuckin'
Doug Cheston!

37

Who?

40
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,208
My dad owns--

41
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,208
[body slumps]

42
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,833
My dad owns
Cheston Pharmaceutical,

43
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:38,833
and like, half this univer--

44
00:01:41,916 --> 00:01:43,791
--and like,
half this university.

45
00:01:43,833 --> 00:01:45,583
Didn't your dad
hike up prices

46
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,000
on that baby medicine
everyone needs?

47
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,166
Totally, yeah!

48
00:01:49,208 --> 00:01:51,625
Anyway, I'm gonna inherit
all that shit soon,

49
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,333
'cause my dad's mad old.

50
00:01:53,375 --> 00:01:54,208
So...

51
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:57,833
Do one, or, ideally, all of you,

52
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,083
want to have sex tonight,

53
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,083
and get in on the ground floor
of my inheritance?

54
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,125
-Gross.
-Ew! No way.

55
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,000
[scoffs] You don't know
what you're missing.

56
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:05,875
[laughs, scoffing]

57
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,000
Yeah, we so do!

58
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:07,833
It's me!

59
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:09,458
I'm what you're missing!

60
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500

00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:21,666
What the...?

65
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:23,458
Hey, where am I?

66
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,250
[DA Sinclair] Oh, hello.

67
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,250
[chuckles] I know,

68
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:27,416
you're confused,

69
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,833
but I'm sure
you're used to that.

70
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:31,583
Just stay quiet and still,

71
00:02:31,625 --> 00:02:34,333
and soon you'll be feeling
better than ever.

72
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:35,166
What?

73
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:36,250
What's going on?

74
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,333
You're going through
a metamorphosis,

75
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:39,416
a miracle

76
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:41,208
that will take you
from useless boil

77
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,708
on the behind
of this crooked world,

78
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,333
to a brave explorer

79
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,500

for all humanity--

80
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,416
Nerd!

81
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,375
[guffaws]

82
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:50,875
Who talks like that?

83
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:51,875
You do!

84
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,875

Let me up, asshole!

89
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,291
If this is some joke,
or some weird sex shit,

90
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,625
my dad's gonna sue you
into the Stone Age!

91
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,791
Oh, Jesus!

92
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,291
Oh! Oh, shit!

What the fuck is that?

00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,666
[DA Sinclair]
No histrionics, please.

97
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:17,791
What the fuck did you do?

98
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,208
Or I'll be forced to--

99
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,041
-Oh, my god!

[gurgling]

102
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,625
I think we can all agree

103
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,583
you're better
without vocal cords--

105
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,250
--and don't worry
about those prototypes.

You're going to be different.

You're going to be beautiful.

108

You're going to be--

-Pre-op!
-Clamp that vein!

Keep an eye on that for me.

I've got
multiple skull fractures

115

and cranial swelling.

116
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,791
She's convulsing!
Keep her airway clear.

117
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,875
These numbers
don't make any sense.

118
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:53,958
Watch out!

119
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,666

One, two, three.

121
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,125
She's drowning
in her own blood.

122
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:00,750
Get her intubated, now!

123
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,708
Toss me the saline.

Someone get Dr. Barclay in here.

I'm getting a line started.

127
00:04:05,416 --> 00:04:06,833
Find out what kind of blood
she can take.

128
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,375
The needle won't go in.

129
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:13,458
Shit!

130
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,333
Uh...

131
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,458
I've studied Monster Girl's
physiology extensively.

132
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,583
Please stand aside.

133
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,500
What?

134
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:27,916
Get him out of here!

136
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,041
You can attempt to remove me,

137

you may even succeed,

138
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,666
but then she dies,

139
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,916
or you can assist me,

140
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,083
and we can save her life.

141
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,583
Choose now.

142
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,208
Shh... I'm here now.

Monster Girl's only hope

144
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,041
is if we can activate
her innate healing abilities.

145
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,000
Begin a saline infusion
of 2% belladonna root,

5% wolfsbane.

147
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,791
We don't have that.

148
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:54,875
Then get it.

00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:26,833
No...

190
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,541
No, no, I was supposed to, um...

191
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,541
Amber--

192
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,041
It's okay,
I covered for you.

193
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:34,666
Told her you got hit by a bus,

194
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,541
which, from the looks of you,
isn't far off.

195
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:40,875
Black Samson?

196
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,166
Monster Girl?

197
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,708
Still unconscious.

198
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,000
It's not your fault.

199
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,583
Darkblood crack yet?

200
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,041
You know him.

201
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:07,333
He barely talks
when he wants to.

202
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:08,375
Let me take a swing.

203
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:09,625
I'll make him talk.

204
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,916
As fascinating
as it would be

205
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,791
to watch an unstoppable force
meet an immovable object,

206
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,750
I prefer to keep
these kind of things in-house.

207
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,708
Did he do it?

208
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,750
Did he murder
the Guardians?

209
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,250
We don't know.

210
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:26,791
What's more interesting to me
is why he would do it.

211
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,125
He's a demon.

212
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,166
There's your why.

213
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,250
I thought I knew him,
that's all.

214
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,208
Mark never told you

215
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,333
he was taking on
Machine Head

216
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,333
all by his lonesome?

217
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,708
Yeah, he told me.

218
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,291
Told me he wasn't
gonna take the bait.

219
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,250
[chuckles]

220
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,583
What's so funny
about that?

221
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,166
You're the most powerful man
on the planet,

222
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,250
but even your kid
won't listen to you.

223
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,958
What, this doesn't
happen on Viltrum?

224
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,833
No.

225
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:48,916
It doesn't.

226
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:50,541
[chuckles] Hmm.

227
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,958
Mark's a human teenager, Nolan.

228
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,333
It's what they do.

229
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,416
It's reassuring, really.

230
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,750
[Amber] You do look like
you got run over.

231
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,416
Yeah, that's me.

232
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,458
The guy who doesn't know
how traffic lights work.

233
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,250
I still can't believe

234
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,250
you wouldn't let me
see you in the hospital.

235
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,750
They had weird rules
about visitors.

236
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,000
Eve only knew I was there

237
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:14,916
because, um, she heard
from William.

238
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:15,916
What?

239
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,333
I'd basically already
dumped you that night.

240
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,416
I know...

241
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,041
and I've thought a lot
about that

242
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:23,916
these last couple of days.

243
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:26,291
Remember
when I first called you?

244
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,625
After you made Todd
give me your number?

245
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:28,625
Yeah.

246
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,041
I was terrified,

247
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,000
and I could barely
talk straight,

248
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,666
and I messed it all up,

249
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,166
but you let me
start over.

250
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:38,833
And?

251
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:41,166
Can we do that again?

252
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,166
Start over?

253
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,625
You're right.

254
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,625
Yeah, I don't deserve...

255
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,666
to start over.

256
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,666
Hey, handsome Mark Grayson.

257
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,833
I'm glad you've still got
that pretty face of yours.

258
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:00,875
[chuckles]

259
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,583
Me too.

260
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,583
So, uh...

261
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,916
wanna hang out sometime?

262
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,750
Sure.

263
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,916
[♪♪♪]

264
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:12,958
[William] Both ways, Mark.

265
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,916
You need to look both ways
before you cross the street.

266
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,791
Did you skip kindergarten
the day they taught that?

267
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,000
[chuckles]
Guess so.

268
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,166
Hey, we haven't hung out
for a while. We should--

269
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:24,166
Because someone's
the king of excuses.

270
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,250
"I've got to study."

271
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,083
"I need to help my dad
with work."

272
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,416
"I'm infectious."

273
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,333
Blah, blah, blah.

274
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:30,291
Okay.

275
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,583
Well, there's no school
on Friday.

276
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:32,583
Let's catch a movie
or something.

277
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,458
Love to.

278
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,291
Can't.

279
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,750
Remember Rick?

280
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,333
The guy you couldn't stop
talking about last summer?

281
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,083
You make it sound like
I was obsessed or something.

282
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,083
Anyway, he's at Upstate U.

283
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,583
I'm going for a tour on Friday.

284
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,500
Staying over.

285
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,000
They have
a very handsome

286
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,916
pre-med program.

287
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,583
Did I say handsome?
I meant "world-class,"

288
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:51,208
but also, handsome.

289
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,041
Can I come?

290
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,166
What?

291
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,041
I want to come.

292
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,041
Okay...

293
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,041
And I want to bring Amber.

294
00:09:59,083 --> 00:09:59,958
Hold on--

295
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,250
Please, William.

296
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,125
I need this.

297
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:10,458
[soft knock]

298
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,541
Eve!

299
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,500
Come in.

300
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,208
Mark, I wanted--

301
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,250
I never got to thank you

302
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,166
for talking to Amber
when I was hurt,

303
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:20,875
so... [sighs]

304
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,875
Thanks.

305
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:23,958
Going somewhere?

306
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,750
Oh, this guy
William's crushing on

307
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,083
goes to Upstate U.

308
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:28,541
William's going
for a tour,

309
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,750
and I convinced him

310
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,416
to let me and Amber
tag along.

311
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,291
Oh.

312
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,041
Oh, shit.

313
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,208
I'm sorry.

314
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,583
Um, if you want to come,
that's totally cool.

315
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,416
I'm just trying to start over
with Amber, you know?

316
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,291
Show her I'm serious this time.

317
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,291
That's okay.

318
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:43,708
I'm skipping college anyway.

319
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,291
What? Why?

320
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,625
Your grades
are way better than mine.

321
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,458
When I was at
the community center with Amber,

322
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,083
something clicked for me.

323
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,166
I think I can help more people

324
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,208
by just... helping them,
you know?

325
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,416
I don't have to wait
for some alien invasion

326
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,041
or the Lizard League's
next attack.

327
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,666
I can irrigate deserts,

328
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,250
stop natural disasters,

329
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,625
bring food to the starving.

330
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,666
You know,
make a real difference.

331
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:10,666
Yeah. I get it.

332
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:12,666
Huh.

333
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,833
I thought you'd try
and talk me out of it.

334
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:14,833
Rex would have.

335
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,541
I really messed up downtown.

336
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:18,916
Black Samson and Monster Girl
almost died

337
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,041
because of me.

338
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,375
So I get it.

339
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,416
Maybe fighting off
alien invasions

340
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,791
isn't in either of our futures.

341
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,041
Maybe we both need
a fresh start.

342
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,041
[Debbie calls] Mark!

343
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,333
William and Amber
are here.

344
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,625
Okay, Mom!

345
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:35,791
-[soft whoosh]
-So where are you--

346
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,208
You okay?

347
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,250
Yeah. Fine.

348
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,583
Just sore.

349
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,833
[bangs roof]
Come on, slowpoke!

350
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,041
Let's hit the road!

351
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:57,125
Okay, be careful.

352
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,916
Don't have too much fun.

353
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:00,000
No drinking.

354
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:01,250
No drugs.

355
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:02,375
And no sex!

356
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,458
[William laughs, Mark groans]

357
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,958
No sex. Got it.

358
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,541
I'll take good care
of them, Mrs. Grayson!

359
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,125
[♪♪♪]

360
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,791
[revs engine, tires squealing]

361
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,375
[horn honks, teens laugh]

362
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,083
Tell me more
about this Rick guy.

363
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, man.

364
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:24,291
I can't wait
for you to meet him.

365
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,458
He's like,
first of all, tall.

366
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,625
Amazing hair.

367
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,916
Thick as a horse's mane.

368
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:29,833
That's good?

369
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,583
-Yes.
-Yes.

370
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,750
Rick's style?
Incredible.

371
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,208
A perfect combo
of street and prep.

372
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,125

What about school?

It's also one of the best

[professor] It may look
the same from the outside,

00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,500
but the chance of heart failure
doubles

457
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,208
with each decade of life.

458
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,333
What can we do about that?

459
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:38,083
Eat better, sure.

460
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:39,458
Exercise helps.

461

But fundamentally

When you need to fly
to another country,

you don't flap your arms,

All human failings
