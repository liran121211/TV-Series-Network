00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:01,875
Ha. Ha.

188
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:02,708
Cute.

189
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,458
But I'm lactose intolerant.

190
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,458
Whoa, hold on.

191
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,916
Do you know me at all?

192
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,458
I filled them with beer.

193
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,125
You're welcome.

194
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,625
Guess how long
it took him to do that?

195
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,500
And how much milk
he wasted.

196
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,708
I poured it all down the drain.

197
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,041
Why are you never
this industrious

198
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:22,208
when it involves training?

199
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,458
[chuckles]

200
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,958
How come I get
my head beat in,

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,125
and it's a week
in the hospital.

202
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,208
You get your head beat in,

203
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,458
and your powers come back?

204
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,791
I figure it's karma
for putting up with this guy.

205
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:33,625
You're welcome.

206
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,791
[laughs]

207
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:37,541
I am delighted at
your recovery, Monster Girl.

208
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,208
Very much.

209
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,708
I wouldn't be recovered
if it wasn't for you.

210
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,250
You saved my life.

211
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:44,125
Of course.

212
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,916
I would never let you die.

213
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,708
Die. Die. Die.

214
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,625
[voice speeds up, glitching]
Die. Die. Die. Die. Die.

215
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,458
[rapid, robotic]
Die. Die. Die. Die--

216
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,708
[voice speeding
into percussive buzz]

217
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,125
[footsteps retreating]

218
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,875
My apologies.

219
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,125
A small programming error.

220
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,041
Soon to be fixed permanently.

221
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,458
[laughing]
Holy shit!

222
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,666
Well, that was creepy.

223
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:03,750
That was like

224
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:05,375
the creepiest thing
I've seen you do since--

225
00:08:05,416 --> 00:08:06,666
[gasps] Do you remember
that time

226
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:09,250
I caught you operating
on your own head?

227
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,208
I swear to god,

228
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,708
he had his head
on the bench,

229
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,208
and he was just
standing over it,

230
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,708
prying it open with
a Phillips head screwdriver.

231
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,208
Oh, my god.
Can I get another...

232
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,208
[radio interference
squeals and crackles]

233
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,208
You!

234
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,625
Get out of the truck.

235
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,500
[fires, glass cracks]

236
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:43,916
[grunts]

237
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,291
I said, get out of the--

238
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,916
Huh?

239
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:48,958
[hydraulics whirring]

240
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,125
Step back,

241
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:57,625
please.

242
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,208
[hydraulics whirr, metal clanks]

243
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,791
[pipes detach, hissing]

244
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:11,708
[Robot] Gentlemen.

245
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,041
[groans in disgust]

246
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:15,208
-What is that?
-[gags] Ugh.

247
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,291
[Robot] Come, now,

248
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,875
I believe you can answer
that question on your own.

249
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:22,208
It's the real Robot.

250
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,416
[metal pincers clap]

251
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,416
Well done.

252
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,791
Perhaps
you're the original, then?

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,541
We've been growing you
a new body.

254
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,666
And now introductions
are complete,

255
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:32,708
show me your work.

256
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,958
[metal legs clank and whirr]

257
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,583
[Robot] It's perfect.

258
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,833
We are professionals.

259
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:47,833
[Robot] Except for

260
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,083
the timed-release
mycotoxin sacs,

261
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,916
the embedded cortical override,

262
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,000
and the seven--

263
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:55,583
oh, sorry, eight,
synaptic transceivers.

264
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,125
Maybe I'm old-fashioned,

265
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,208
but I prefer to be
the only person

266
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,500
in control of my body.

267
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,375
Please.

268
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,250
I would have been disappointed
if you hadn't tried.

269
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,625
Remove all of that,

270
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:08,041
add in this small upgrade
of my own design,

271
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,000
and we can discuss your payment.

272
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:13,416
Let's discuss our payment
and we'll do all of that.

273
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:17,083
A Global Defense Agency
control collar

274
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,625
placates
the strongest of wills.

275
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:20,750
A highly-restricted technology.

276
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,000
It's encrypted.

277
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,250
Besides, a little trust
goes a long way.

278
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,166
Actions go further.

279
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,916
[cutters whine, circuits snap]

280
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:31,875
[crumbling]

281
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,250
[Robot] There.

282
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,583
I am alone and helpless.

283
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,000
Sheesh.

284
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,375
Alone, yes.

285
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,333
Helpless, I doubt it.

286
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,083
Do what he wants.

287
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,541
[Robot]
It needs to be placed on the--

288
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:51,958
Upper brainstem.

289
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,125
I recognize a neural-link
when I see one.

290
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,250
[William]
Yesterday was messed up.

291
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,583
I mean, is Rick
ever gonna be okay?

292
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,750
God...

293
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,125
What that Sinclair guy
was doing to people...

294
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,125
Cecil's team
knows what they're doing.

295
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,416
They'll help Rick.

296
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:10,750
I gotta say it--

297
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:13,375
If you had helped me find him
right away,

298
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,125
none of this
would have ever happened.

299
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,125
I know.

300
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,541
I'm sorry.

301
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:18,625
I suck.

302
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,250
It figures,

303
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,541
I finally fall for someone,

304
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:22,958
and then... boom.

305
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,708
Cyborg.

306
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,583
So this is why
I've hardly seen you

307
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,000
the last six months.

308
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:29,750
Because you're a superhero.

309
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,583
Not anymore.

310
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,791
What? Why?

311
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,958
Because I'm a terrible friend
and a worse boyfriend.

312
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,500
Because I'm gonna fail
my last year of high school.

313
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,000
Because I got everything
I ever wanted,

314
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,500
and I messed it all up.

315
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,958
I should've listened to my dad.

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,291
Your dad?

317
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,625
Omni-Man.

318
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,833
Oh.

319
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,041
Of course.

320
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:52,041
Your dad's Omni-Man.

321
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,416
How did I never see that?

322
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:55,791
I am such a screw-up.

323
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:56,750
[William] Okay, stop.

324
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,916
Enough with the sulking,
you big baby.

325
00:11:58,958 --> 00:11:59,833
What?

326
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:01,166
You can fly.

327
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,416
You're invulnerable.

328
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,000
Your dad's the greatest
superhero on Earth,

329
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,666
and your mom loves
and cares about you.

330
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:09,333
You just need to study,
and you can pull up your grades.

331
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,125
But you were
a terrible boyfriend to Amber,

332
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,333
and you got what you deserved.

333
00:12:12,375 --> 00:12:14,666
Sorry, not sorry.

334
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,333
If I can deal with almost losing
the hottest guy I've ever had,

335
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,750
you can deal with this.

336
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:20,750
What?

337
00:12:20,791 --> 00:12:21,791
Friends tell friends the truth.

338
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:22,750
Not like that, they don't!

339
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,291
I just got dumped, dude!

340
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,333
You got dumped weeks ago,
you just didn't realize it.

341
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:28,791
You're like a bad guy
in a samurai movie

342
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:29,833
who gets cut in half,

343
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:30,791
but thinks they're fine

344
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,625
until they're like, "Oh, my god,

345
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:35,125
my top half's sliding away
from my bottom half."

346
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,250
[mock groaning]

347
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,416
I love you, man,

348
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,250
but I need someone else
to talk to.

349
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,333
[indistinct chatter]

350
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:55,416
Debbie?

351
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,583
Good.
We need to talk about--

352
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,583
Nolan killed
the Guardians of the Globe.

353
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,708
I know.

354
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,625
[slap]

355
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,500
How could you know
and not tell me?

356
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:05,041
I couldn't risk Nolan
finding out we knew.

357
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,041
Not until we figured out

358
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,875
what he was doing
and how to stop him.

359
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:10,458
We failed on both those counts,
by the way.

360
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,333
What do you mean, stop him?

361
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,750
Do you mean kill him?

362
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:16,041
Cecil--

363
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,583
[Cecil] I'm not sure
we could kill him.

364
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:19,500
Not us, anyway.

365
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,500
[sighs heavily]

366
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,000
There's only one person I know

367
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,041
who might be able to go
toe-to-toe with Omni-Man

368
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,833
and come out on top, Debbie.

369
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,166
No.

370
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,875
No. Never.

371
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:31,750
You can't.

372
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,750
Where's Mark, Debbie?

373
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,750
Where's--

374
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,166
[exhales sadly]

375
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,833
Mark...

376
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,708
I killed
the Guardians of the Globe.

377
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,250
Wait, before you say anything,
just listen.

378
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:50,333
Please.

379
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:51,666
I'm not a monster.

380
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,708
I didn't want to do it...

381
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,083
but it had to be done.

382
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:59,291
It was my responsibility.

383
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,708
Other people
won't understand that,

384
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,000
but I know you can.

385
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:08,041
What I'm about to tell you
will change everything.

386
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:10,208
Just remember, you're my son,

387
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,125
and I love you and your mother
more than...

388
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,458
[sighs]
What am I doing?

389
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,500
[drill whirring]

390
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,750
Ugh. Disgusting.

391
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,125
I didn't design it
to be drained,

392
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:40,333
or ever opened.

393
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,833
What changed?

394
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,375
I met someone.

395
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,416
Make room, please.

396
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,250
[hatch blows]

397
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,208
[mechanisms whirr]

398
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,791
[retracts wetly]
[gasps, wincing]

399
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,291
[voice weakened]
Hurry, please.

400
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,041
Air is toxic to me.

401
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,000
It burns my-- my lungs.

402
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:05,416
[breath wheezing]

403
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,625
[gags] Yuck...

404
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,083
Don't make a face.

405
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,166
You lost the coin toss.

406
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,958
[wheezing]

407
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:17,833
This will be painful.

408
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,666
[Robot chuckles ruefully]

409
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:24,333
My entire life
has been painful.

410
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,583
[device whirring]

411
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,500
You realize

412
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,958
this procedure doesn't
transfer you to the new body.

413
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,916
It creates a copy of your mind.

414
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,833
For you, nothing will change.

415
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,458
For him, everything will.

416
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,375
I... understand.

417
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,708
Three, two...

418
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,666
[power surging]

419
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,125
[coughing and choking]

420
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,625
[circuits crackle]

421
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,333
Of course, his brain's abnormal.

422
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:19,875
You didn't think of that?

423
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:20,750
Look at him!

424
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,000
Shut up, will you?

425
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,333
His motor cortex
is the size of a pea.

426
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,000
Same for his occipital
and parietal lobes.

427
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,750
They've all been eaten alive
by his oversized cerebrum.

428
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,583
[gasping weakly]

429
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:38,125
The system wasn't designed
for neurons this dense.

430
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:39,500
Are you calling us stupid?

431
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:40,583
Yes.

432
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,916
I'm calling us stupid.

433
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,208
Compensating now,

434
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,791
but it's gonna be close.

435
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,625
[gasping]

436
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,125
[groaning]

437
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:12,125
[both groaning]

438
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,375
[power surging and crackling]

439
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,208
Idiot!

440
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,458
You just lost us
our control collars.

441
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,125
Just get the fire extinguisher
before we lose everything else.

442
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,333
[screaming in agony]

443
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,708
[groans]

444
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,416
[grunts]

445
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:01,833
[groans]

446
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,083
Which...

447
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,958
Which am I?

448
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,208
See?

449
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,958
It's not just us.

450
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,666
You won the coin toss, champ.

451
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:18,083
You're the new one.

452
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,958
I...

453
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
wasn't expecting this.

454
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,833
This feeling of continuance.

455
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,250
I closed my eyes...

456
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,208
and opened new ones.

457
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,000
I didn't know which one I'd be.

458
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,666
That's how it works.

459
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,458
We had to make it seamless,

460
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,000
otherwise one of us knows
he's the clone,

461
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,166
and that never ends well.

462
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,500
In your case,
it's a little more obvious,

463
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,750
but it looks like that problem
took care of itself.

464
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,583
[coughing]

465
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, shit, here we go.

466
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,250
I'm sorry it wasn't you.

467
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,541
D-Don't be.

468
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,125
Be... happy.

469
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,958
Change the... [wheezing]

470
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,583
...world.

471
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,333
Experience everything...

472
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,250
we never could.

473
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,791
[wheezing]

474
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,083
What are you...

475
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,458
w-waiting for?

476
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,666
This was always the plan.

477
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,416
[gasping]

478
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,166
I can put you back in the pod.

479
00:19:24,208 --> 00:19:25,833
We can both survive.

480
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:27,750
Change the world together.

481
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,583
[wheezing]

482
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,500
This is...

483
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:35,750
what I want.

484
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,166
Please.

485
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:45,833
[gasps a ragged final breath]

486
00:19:53,166 --> 00:19:55,708
It was an act of mercy.

487
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,000
We know.

488
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,333
We do it all the time.

489
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:01,291
Now... [clears throat]

490
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,708
our schematics.

491
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,875
The cryptographic key

492
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:17,458
is the entire text
of Frankenstein.

493
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,791
Look who has
a sense of humor after all.

494
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,208
And now that our deal
is complete,

495
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,041
it's time you both
returned to prison.

496
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,541
[laughing]

497
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,791
He's serious.

498
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:36,791
Yeah, he's also a teenage boy.

499
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:41,541
No, I'm a 30-year old genius

[chuckles]

502
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,041
That was your plan?

503
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:05,375
My plan was not to hurt you,

504
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,833
but here we are.

Just wait--

You've been spying on me?

Huh.
Who are you talking to--

551
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:21,666
The honor was all mine.

Even after evacuating
the neighborhood,

we had to keep

00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,000
Power up the teleporter.

741
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:07,583
You said we couldn't
teleport them yet.

742
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,208
It's not for them.

743
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,458
Then I received Cecil's alert,

744
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,750
and left for here
as quickly as I could.

745
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,583
Any questions?

746
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,958
Uh, yeah, a few!

747
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,583
First, why me?

748
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,791
I mean, sure,

749
00:31:22,833 --> 00:31:26,250
I get that anyone
would want to be me,

750
00:31:26,291 --> 00:31:28,333
but why specifically me?

751
00:31:28,375 --> 00:31:29,583
And second,

752
00:31:29,625 --> 00:31:31,791
why a kid version of me?

753
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:32,916
That's just weird.

754
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,666
Exactly.
It's messed up.

755
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:36,166
You didn't even ask first.

756
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,750
[Rex] That's what you think
is wrong with this?

757
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:40,416
There is so much
wrong with this.

758
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,083
He did it for me.

759
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,125
What?

760
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,833
What are you even
talking about?

761
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:47,041
We were both prisoners
in our own bodies.

762
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:49,541
Monster Girl slowly
getting younger,

763
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,500
and me trapped
in a mechanical tomb

764
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,666
of my own creation.

765
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,416
I escaped my prison.

766
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:55,833
Now I'll help you
escape yours.

767
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:56,666
No!

768
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,166
Don't give him any sympathy!

769
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:01,250
He still hasn't told me
why he stole my kid face!

770
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,875
You're ruining my childhood,

771
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:06,083
and that's hard
because it already sucked.

772
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:08,250
I adapted your DNA

773
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,875
because I noticed
Monster Girl found you...

774
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:12,000
interesting.

775
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,208
What?

776
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,791
Wait, what?

777
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:15,916
Oh, my God--

778
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,833
I don't even know
how to feel about that!

779
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:19,416
Goddamit, Robot!

780
00:32:19,458 --> 00:32:21,333
Will you please
stop fucking me up?

781
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:22,583
[Monster Girl]
So, you lied to us

782
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,625
about who you really were,

783
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,041
freed the Maulers from prison,

784
00:32:25,083 --> 00:32:26,500
stole Rex's DNA,

785
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:28,958
conspired with criminals
to grow yourself a new body,

786
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,666
and you expect us all to be
like, "Oh sure, who wouldn't?"

787
00:32:31,708 --> 00:32:33,041
I-- Yes.

788
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,166
I mean, I... did.

789
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:36,083
[sighs]

790
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:37,916
I need time to process this.

791
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:39,000
I bet everyone else does, too.

792
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,125
Ya think?

793
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,333
Hey!

794
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:44,000
I know why Cecil's
holding us at high alert.

795
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,791
What the fuck is going on today?

796
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,291
[explosions booming]

797
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,333
[gasps]

798
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:04,166
What is that?

799
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:08,125
Huh, I'll tell you
what that is,

800
00:33:08,166 --> 00:33:09,583
not our problem anymore.

801
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:10,708
We should check in with Cecil.

802
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,625
Forget it.

803
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,916
I'm done with all that.

804
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:13,916
So are you.

805
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:15,666
That's not why I came out here.

806
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,333
You came out here
to get away from Rex

807
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,583
and all that superhero bullshit.

808
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,916
Rex had nothing
to do with this.

809
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,083
I came out here because
I needed to start over,

810
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,000
but that doesn't mean
ignoring the world

811
00:33:27,041 --> 00:33:28,500
when it needs me.

812
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:30,333
The world was fine
before I came along.

813
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,125
It'll be fine
without my help.

814
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:33,333
Better, probably.

815
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:35,541
I get that
you're feeling shitty

816
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:36,791
because Amber dumped you,

817
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:37,916
but trust me,

818
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,166
you'll feel worse

819
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:42,666
if you sit here and do nothing
when you could save lives.

820
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:45,833
I doubt it.

821
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:46,750
Fine,

822
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:47,916
but I'm going.

823
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,083
[sonic boom rumbles]

[grunts]

825
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,375
You thought that could hurt me?

826
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,041
No.

827
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:07,541
That was just
to get your attention.

828
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:08,958

[chuckles]

832
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,041
Jesus, Nolan,
right for the throat?

833
00:34:17,083 --> 00:34:19,041
After everything
that we've been through?

834
00:34:19,083 --> 00:34:20,791
Keep out of this, Cecil.

835
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,458
[rocks crumbling]

836
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,375
[teleporter whoosh]

837
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:26,125
You know I can't do that, Nolan.

[pants, chuckling]

841
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,875
I've faced death more times
than I can count,

842
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34,041
but I'll be damned

843
00:34:34,083 --> 00:34:36,208
if that didn't put my balls
in my throat.

844
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,791
[teleporter whoosh]

845
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,541
I just wanna know why.

846
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:40,500
Every one of the Guardians

847
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:41,833
risked their necks for you,

848
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,875
over and over again.

849
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,875
I never needed their help.

850
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:47,125
They were weak.

851
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:49,250
They were your friends,

852
00:34:49,291 --> 00:34:50,875
and so was I...

853
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,000
which is why I know

854
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,958
you didn't kill them
for the fun of it.

855
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,625
You had a reason.

856
00:34:56,666 --> 00:34:58,291
You wanna get it off your chest?

857
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:02,000

00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:07,083
Fine, don't tell me,

860
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:09,041
but what about Debbie, huh?

861
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:10,333
Doesn't she deserve an answer?

862
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,083
Don't say her name.

863
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,083
Why not?

864
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:17,166
You hurt her, not me.

865
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:19,000
She and I have that
in common now.

866
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:22,041
I'm a good liar.

867
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm a very good liar,

868
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,541
but you, you're better.

869
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,583
You fooled her.

870
00:35:28,625 --> 00:35:32,000
Hell, you fooled all of us
for what, 20 years?

871
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:33,750
Wait,

872
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:36,958
does Mark know
that his dad's a murderer?

873
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,750
Does he know?

874
00:35:39,791 --> 00:35:41,500
No?

875
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:43,166
Well, what's he gonna do
when he finds out, huh?

876
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,791
This is pointless.

877
00:35:44,833 --> 00:35:46,166
You can't stop me.

878
00:35:46,208 --> 00:35:48,250
Yeah, you're right.
I can't,

879
00:35:48,291 --> 00:35:50,000
but I can do the same thing
I've been doing

880
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,500
since I figured out you were
a lying piece of shit.

881
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,250
I can buy us a little more time.

You want revenge?

Quit complaining

I built it exactly
to the schematics.

Good.

939
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,833
How do we know he'll revive?

940
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,750
Cecil couldn't bring him back.

941
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,083

Sure...

but we removed its pain center,

954
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,000
and juiced it up
with every drug, enhancement,

and upgrade we had.

956
00:38:59,291 --> 00:39:03,375

really pissed it off,

everything I've thrown at him,

if Mark is with his father,
