00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:32,958
Uh, Principal Winslow.

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,166
Uh... hi.

190
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:35,416
Mr. Grayson.

191
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:38,500
If you're planning
to attend college,

192
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,333
we need to have
a conversation

193
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,375
about your recent...

194
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:43,625
attendance issues.

195
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:48,791
Uh, what if I'm not planning
to attend college?

196
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,666
[alarms wailing]

197
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,708
[hydraulic motors whir]

198
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,291
Freeze!

199
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:04,833
Your lives worth
minimum wage?

200
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,416
Or do you wanna fire
your guns in the air,

201
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,583
say you tried your best,

202
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,250
and we all walk away happy,

203
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,583
and alive?

204
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,833
[gunfire rattling]

[Mark, in text]
"Hey, can't make it tonight.

206
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,541
Just got hit by something."

[Amber, in text]
"You're standing me up?

209
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:39,291
You tread on dangerous ground,
my friend."

00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,458
[Mark, in text]
"It'll be worth the wait

211
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,333
to see me
on my best behavior."

you hold dear, Mark Grayson."

218
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,000
Seriously?

219
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,166
Not even scratched?

220
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,208
Not bad for a guy

221
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,250
with gravel
for fingers.

222
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:25,791

[energy surging]

224
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,958
[moans] Oh... yeah.
Oh, yeah.

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,625
Yeah, that's...
that's nice.

226
00:09:32,666 --> 00:09:34,916
That works nicely.

227
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:35,875
[Titan] That's the last of it.

228
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:39,083
Paid in full.
I'm done.

229
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,541
Mm... nah.

230
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,375
Nah?

231
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,583
See, Titan,

232
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,500
your problem
is you're too useful.

233
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,083
You get shit done.

234
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,166
You take bullets like a champ,

235
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,583
and don't even whine about it,

236
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,583
unlike someone else
in the room.

237
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,916
It was
one fucking time.

238
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,791
-I said--
-Shut the hell up!

239
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,208
Yeah, yeah, sometimes,
you let people live

240
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,666
when they need to die,

241
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,208
but, man, you make an impact.

242
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,958
If you didn't just finish
paying off your debt,

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,958
we'd be talking bonus time.

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,583
I don't need
your money anymore.

245
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,833
Sure, you do.

246
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,416
Come on, like
you're gonna go clean?

247
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,833
Work the fry-station
at Burger-Mart?

248
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,208
That ship
has sailed, amigo.

249
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,000
This is your life now.

250
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,833
This is what you do.

251
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:21,791
No, it's not.

252
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:24,708
You're a walking
pile of rocks.

253
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,375
You break heads.

254
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:27,333
That's it.

255
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,291
That's all.

256
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,791
Own it already.

257
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:32,500
See, I know you're gonna
keep working for me.

258
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:33,500
The question is,

259
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,625
how painful do you
want it to be?

260
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:37,625
-[stone rumbling]
-What are you doing?

261
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,791
[laughs]

262
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,541
You think you can just
punch your way out of this?

263
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:43,708
I know where
your family lives,

264
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,333
and that means
you work for me

265
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,125
until I say
you're fucking done!

266
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,208
-[roars]
-Yeah, see?

267
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,083
See!

268
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,708
Impressive shit
like that

269
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,083
is exactly why

270
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,041
I'm never
letting you go!

271
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:02,916
Plus, now you gotta
pay for the desk, too.

272
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,333
This was imported
Italian maple.

273
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:06,375
[grumbles]

274
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:17,375
[♪♪♪]

275
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,541
[sighs in relief]

276
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,625
Now just
throw it back into space.

277
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,375
[gasping wearily]

278
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,125
[grunts]

279
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,500
[roars]

280
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,625
How does it feel
to save the world?

281
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:51,916
Or at least the country?

282
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:53,833
By the way,
that was a small one.

283
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,083
That was a small one?

284
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,541
Yeah, you should've
seen the asteroid

285
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,166
I diverted a few years ago.

286
00:11:58,208 --> 00:11:59,333
The size of Texas.

287
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,291
-[text alert beeps]
-Aw, crap.

288
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:02,375
I gotta run, Dad.

289
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:04,125
Hey, whatever that is,

290
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,333
your training
is more important.

291
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:07,500
Big picture, right?

292
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,583
I know, but it's Amber.

293
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,000
Mark, we talked about this.

294
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,083
[groans] Dad...

295
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,500
[sighs indulgently]

296
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,666
This one time, okay?

297
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,291
Yes!

298
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,500
[knocking on door]

299
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,250
I know I'm a little late...

300
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,958
I brought dessert.

301
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,208
[groans] Ugh.

302
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,333
Okay, that's fair.

303
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,958
You were right.

304
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,333
Your mom's
a great cook.

305
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:40,166
You should've
told her that yourself.

306
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,291
During dinner.

307
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,291
Two hours ago.

308
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,250
I tried to text you--

309
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,875
Am I important
to you, Mark?

310
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:46,916
Uh... yeah.

311
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:47,916
Of course.

312
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:50,041
Well, it really
doesn't feel like it.

313
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:51,541
Half the time
we make plans,

314
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,500
you're late,

315
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:53,541
or you cancel,

316
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:54,416
or you just don't show,

317
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:55,291
and your excuses suck.

318
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,291
Hold on--

319
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,416
But then you pick up
the sushi I like,

320
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,750
or you leave a note
in my locker,

321
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,583
or you surprise me after class,

322
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,666
and you're not a bad kisser,

323
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,958
but that doesn't make it okay
if you keep doing it,

324
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,041
and tonight was just definitely
not okay.

325
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,125
This was three months.

326
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,958
This was meeting my mom.

327
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:16,958
It's just...

328
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,875
I have these
family responsibilities.

329
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,458
I help my dad with work.

330
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,125
It's hard making it all fit.

331
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,875
Sure. That's fine.

332
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:28,375
Then make that choice,

333
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,333
but then this?

334
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:31,208
I'm not doing this anymore.

335
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,916
I've been down
this road before,

336
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:33,916
and once was enough.

337
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:34,791
Hold on--

338
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:35,833
Why?

339
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,916
Because...

340
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm, uh...

341
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,666
You're what?

342
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,625
I'm...

343
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:45,833
I'm gonna do better.

344
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:47,541
I promise.

345
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,583
Prove it.

346
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,625

Hey, Dad.

354
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:04,041
Mark,

355
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,708
I'm watching the Elephant
rob a store downtown.

356
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,708
He'd be perfect practice
for you.

357
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,208
I'm not really in the mood--

358
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,250
Mark...

[Elephant trumpeting]

360
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,083
Okay. I'm coming.

361
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,833
That's my boy.

Did somebody ask
for butterscotch ripple?

367
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,375
Mommy, he got my text!

368
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,375
Good.

369
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,333
Means we still have service.

00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,875
We're not out, are we?

00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:05,750
but Mark's one
of the good ones.

738
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:08,833
Yeah, his time management
is awful,

739
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,750
but he's super into you.

740
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,000
You're all he talks about.

741
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,958
Really? Hmm.

742
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,625
Well, thanks for that.

743
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:16,750
See you tonight?

744
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:18,666
Yeah.

745
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:20,041
[Titan] The only place

746
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:21,791
we're guaranteed
to find Machine Head

747
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,000
is 60 stories up.

748
00:28:24,041 --> 00:28:26,166
The room is lined with windows,

749
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,750
but they're bomb-proofed
with something.

750
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:30,166
There's a whole team
of ex-military assholes

751
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,291
patrolling the place,

752
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,916
packing the latest shit, too.

753
00:28:32,958 --> 00:28:35,833
[Mark]
Which is why you need me, hmm?

754
00:28:35,875 --> 00:28:36,833
I'm tough,

755
00:28:36,875 --> 00:28:38,166
but I'm not stupid.

756
00:28:38,208 --> 00:28:39,708
Can't the teleporter guy

757
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,041
just pull
Machine Head out

758
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,375
once we get close?

759
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:43,625
I took care of Isotope.

760
00:28:43,666 --> 00:28:44,750
How?

761
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,833
He's got a girl he sees
a couple of times a week.

762
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,041
I paid her extra

763
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,750
to keep him there
all evening.

764
00:28:49,791 --> 00:28:50,916
What?

765
00:28:50,958 --> 00:28:52,083
Oh... okay.

766
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:54,750
So we break
into the penthouse

767
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:55,958
and grab Machine Head.

768
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,833
Then what?

769
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:57,916
Don't you got friends

770
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,166
who can keep a guy
like him off the street?

771
00:28:59,208 --> 00:29:00,166
I could take him

772
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,208
to the Global Defense Agency.

773
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,166
See?

774
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,416
Doin' good already, hero.

775
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:08,208
That was your daughter,

776
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,208
back at Beckwell
Community Center, right?

777
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,250
What's her name?

778
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,250
Fiona.

779
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,083
You guys go there often?

780
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:19,166
It's her second home.

781
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:27,416
Okay, I'm in,

782
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,375
but we have to make it quick.

783
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,583
I've got plans later tonight.

Huh?

788
00:29:47,583 --> 00:29:50,583
I almost forgot
how good I look.

797
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,291
Don't start.

I'm the original.

[chuckles]

800
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,625
So the process
was a success.

801
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,250
[Robot] I'll never understand
why you do that.

808
00:30:48,666 --> 00:30:50,916
Not the replication
chamber, idiot!

809
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:53,083
As I was trying to say,

810
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:55,250
I need your expertise
in tissue growth

811
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:57,833
and DNA replication.

812
00:30:57,875 --> 00:31:00,416
I'll make it
worth your while.

Hi, honey.

816
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,208
If you have a sec,

817
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:14,041
could you pick up
a few things for dinner?

818
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,625
Well, I was thinking
some tagliatelle

819
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,083
from that restaurant in Rome,

820
00:31:18,125 --> 00:31:20,416
and maybe that wine
from Provence,

821
00:31:20,458 --> 00:31:22,125
the rosé.

822
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,166
Yeah.

823
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:25,166
Thanks, sweetie.
Love you.

[Mark] Get up.

We're taking you in.

It's over.

You're way
out of your league.

Carry the two...

00:32:44,958 --> 00:32:45,750
Oh, hello, Invincible.

847
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:47,958
Boss.

[Machine Head] You're right.

849
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:50,958
You're so strong,

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,083
and you...

851
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:54,416
you, you fly all over
the goddamn place.

852
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:55,375
It's amazing.

00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,458
Uh... thanks?

854
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,875
You know a lot about me.

855
00:32:58,916 --> 00:33:00,291
I also knew
exactly when

856
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,958
you and this giant
pile of shit

857
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,458
would walk in here
and ruin my doors.

858
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,541
Also, Italian maple,
by the way!

859

this coming--

what you think?

See, this is what happens
when your head's a fuckin' rock.

862

You said you took
care of him.

I know what I said.

00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,500
This little upgrade

00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:20,958
which is how I know

867
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,166
it's not worth
explaining to you two morons

868
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:25,625
what quantum probabilities are,

869
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,916
but it doesn't matter,

870
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:29,208

Invincible's right,

00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,375
I'm out of my league.

Drugs, viruses,

1113
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,791
bacteria, prions,

1114
00:44:52,833 --> 00:44:55,458
even nanobots and radioactives.

1115
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,583
Viltrumite cells
don't give a damn.

1116
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,458
They just won't die.

1117
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,291
Well, keep trying.

1118
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,583
I got a feeling
blood's still the answer.
