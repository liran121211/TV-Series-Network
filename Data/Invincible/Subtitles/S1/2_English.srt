I mean, it's impressive,

that many rooms?

It's not about rooms.

00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,000
It's about power.

00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:18,000
That building has one purpose.

11
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,666
To say, "I'm the Queen,
and you are my subjects."

[Matt] Huh.

You think so?

The Queen might look
like a nice old lady,

He probably got buried

Sorry, Debbie.

My dad never mentioned
you guys.

00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,791
[Donald] That's the idea.

79
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,833
We work with superheroes

We... hope so,

of Viltrumites in here.

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,791

00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:20,875

101
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,333
you've got a lot of nerve.

102
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:34,083
Someone murdered the Guardians
of the Globe last night.

103
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:34,916
Oh, my god.

104
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,000
[Cecil] All of them.

105
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,458
Tore 'em limb from limb.

106
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,208
Now, we tried like hell
to bring 'em back,

107
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,375
but Nolan was
the only survivor.

108
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:42,750
How is that even possible?

109
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,208
[Cecil] We don't know yet.

110
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,916
We also don't know why
your dad was at Guardians' HQ.

111
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:48,916
Now, working theory is,

112
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,125
whoever killed the Guardians
lured him there,

113
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,750

all out at once.

00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,375
Dupli-Kate...

00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,166
[grunts]

190
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,625
Keep doing what you are doing.

191
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,375
[energy crackling]

192
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,458
You! Get her to a hospital!

193
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
We can handle this.

194
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,708
You're Atom Eve...

195
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,916
What?

196
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:40,916
Just go!

197
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,833
[Flaxans groaning]

198
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:46,500
[Robot]
Admirable intention, Eve,

199
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,541
but I am not positive
we can handle this.

200
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:50,208
[grunts]

201
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,833
Ha! Huh...

202
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:55,833
[Rex laughs]

203
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,583
Oh.

204
00:08:58,625 --> 00:08:59,708
[yelps]

205
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,125
[screams]

206
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,208
[grunts]

207
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:08,250
Uh, guys?

208
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,708
I'm down to pocket change here.

209
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,583
[yelps]

210
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,000
They're killing me
faster than I can keep up.

211
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,208
[grunts]

212
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,125
We gave people time to escape.

213
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,750
That's what matters.

214
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,625
[Rex] Uh, no.

215
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:20,958
Me living is what matters.

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,291
[groans]

217
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,125
[Robot] Then I have bad news.

218
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,541
[speaking alien language]

219
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,291
[groans]

220
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,666
[grunting]

221
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,625
Ah!

222
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,333
[grunting and straining]

223
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,875
[growls]

224
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,333
[panting]

225
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,750
I don't know
what just happened,

226
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,041
but I think I speak
for everyone here

227
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:08,958
when I say

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,958
I never want it to happen
ever again!

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,250
[groaning weakly]

230
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:15,083
Y'ah!

231
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:16,708
[groans]

232
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,375
Indeed.

233
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:22,291
Help!

234
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,208
Anyone!

235
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,125
I need help!

236
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,416
Freeze.

237
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,541
She needs a doctor!

238
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,000
-[man] He's covered in blood.
-[paramedic] Come on!

239
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,250
Give her to us.

240
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,333
Clamp that vein
and get a drip started.

241
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,416
-Prep operating room six.
-[woman] Yes, doctor.

242
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,083
[GDA Tech-Trooper] He's clear.

243
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,333
Mark!

244
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,083
[Mark] I tried my best.

245
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:53,166
I tried to be like Dad.

246
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,916
[Debbie] It's okay.

247
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,125
It's okay.

248
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,666
[school bell rings]

249
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,708
Hey!

250
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,708
Hey...

251
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,125
Watch it!

252
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:18,000
Dick...

253
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,208
[William] Hey, Mark.

254
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,000
Mark.

255
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:22,666
Mark!

256
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,958
Whoa.

257
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,041
Are you okay?

258
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,916
My dad, um...

259
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,791
he got attacked.

260
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,083
What?

261
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,166
You're kidding.

262
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,541
Oh, god, you're not kidding.

263
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:37,791
Is-Is he okay?
What happened?

264
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,666
He's in the hospital.

265
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,916
They're doing, uh...

266
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,291
They're doing their best,
but it's...

267
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,625
It's messed up, William.

268
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,583
He's really hurt.

269
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:47,625
Jesus, Mark.

270
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:48,791
I'm so sorry.

271
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,125
Did they catch who did it?

272
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:51,875
No, not yet.

273
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,375
Speaking as someone
who's been attacked

274
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,791
in this stupid city,

275
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:55,916
I'm here for you.

276
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,125
Whatever you need.

277
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,000
You wanna talk, I'll listen.

278
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,875
You and Debbie need a lasagna,
I make a good one.

279
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,875
Actually, I make a great one.

280
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,791
Eve Wilkins...

281
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:07,125
[William] What?

282
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,125
Um...

283
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,458
Yeah, that's her.

284
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,708
I need to talk to her.

285
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,666
[laughs]

286
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:12,750
You and all the other
straight boys

287
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:13,958
in a ten-mile radius.

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,041
Good luck with that,

289
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,791
and didn't you just get
your ass kicked last week

290
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,791
for Amber Bennett?

291
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,916
[Mark] Eve?

292
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,750
Hi, uh...

293
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,750
Oh, hey.

294
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,166
Mark, right?

295
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,750
Grayson, yeah.

296
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,250
Um...

297
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,958
thanks for saving
my butt back there.

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,375
Y-Yesterday, I mean.

299
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,583
Yesterday? Oh.

300
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,708
Oh!

301
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,333
That was you?

302
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,125
In the blue and the yellow?

303
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,541
[chuckles] Yeah.

304
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,750
That was me.

305
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:45,416
I'm, um...

306
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:46,666
[whispers] Invincible.

307
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:50,833
God, that sounds dumb
when I say it like that.

308
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,375
It sounds a little
optimistic maybe.

309
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,458
[quietly] I'm Atom Eve,

310
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,250
but the rest of the team
just calls me Eve.

311
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,375
So does everyone else.

312
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,166
Right, since it's
kind of a normal name,

313
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,625
and not something like...

314
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,708
Invincible?

315
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,958
Invincible, yeah.

316
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,958
Do you want to talk
about yesterday?

317
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,625
You look like you need
to talk about yesterday.

318
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,791
[girl] I heard he just
let Todd hit him.

319
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:14,916
Like 20 times.

320
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,625
He didn't flinch
or anything.

321
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,083
Todd got so freaked out

322
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,666
he stayed home
for three days.

323
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,250
Are you talking about
Mark Grayson?

324
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,083
Duh. Of course, Amber.

325
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:26,125
You're the reason
Todd beat him up again.

326
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:30,666
[Mark] I never
recognized you before.

327
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,541
[Eve] No one does.

328
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:32,833
It's a psychology thing.

329
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,833
If you don't expect to see
a superhero in your school,

330
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:38,166
you don't see a superhero
in your school.

331
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,416
Hmm.

332
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:41,416
I even follow Teen Team
on Instagram.

333
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,500
[Eve] That's us.

334
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,208
Everyone's fourth favorite
superhero team.

335
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,291
[chuckles]

336
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,416
I like you guys way better
than Fight Force.

337
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,166
Oh, we're definitely
better than Fight Force.

338
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:51,666
Those guys are the worst.

339
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:55,000
They got their asses kicked
by the Lizard League last year.

340
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh, I remember
seeing that on TV.

341
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,291
So...

342
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,291
you're new to this, right?

343
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,875
Uh... I just got my powers.

344
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:04,541
That was my first big fight.

345
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,083
Ah, okay.

346
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:06,916
Explains a lot.

347
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:09,041
Still, not bad for a rookie.

348
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,041
Are you kidding?

349
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,166
I froze out there.

350
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,375
People got hurt.

351
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,166
People escaped because of you,

352
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,583
and everyone freezes
their first time.

353
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,583
I used to throw up
before every fight.

354
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,208
Barf my guts out.

355
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,000
[Mark chuckles] Really?

356
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:25,875
Like a fire hydrant.

357
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:27,125
You'll get used to it.

358
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,291
The fights, not the barfing.

359
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,583
Ah...

360
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,333
I just...

361
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,291
It wasn't what I expected.

362
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,208
I figured I'd punch some aliens,

363
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,416
and they'd go home.

364
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:41,625
It's not how it looks on TV.

365
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,208
No shit.

366
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:46,583
Thanks.

367
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,416
I charge 250 an hour.

368
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,458
Now I'm kidding.

369
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,333
You are new at this.

370
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,625
Why don't you come by
and meet the Team after school?

371
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:00,500
Teen Team?

372
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,041
I dunno...

373
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,958
I heard they were only
everyone's fourth favorite.

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,083
[sighs]

375
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,958
Meet me out front
after class, Invincible.

376
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,791
[whooshing]

377
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,416
[Cecil]
You kids did good, Robot.

378
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:21,666
Thank you, Cecil.

379
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,416
It's an honor to assist
the Global Defense Agency.

380
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,333
Though your use
of the term "kids"

381
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,416
might be considered
condescending.

382
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,041
But a victory?

383
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,208
No.

384
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,166
Do you know how many people
died here yesterday?

385
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,208
338.

386
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,750
338...

387
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,375
and it only stopped there

388
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:39,250
because whoever the hell
those assholes were, ran away.

389
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,208
-The Flaxans.
-What?

390
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,000
They call themselves
the Flaxans.

391
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:44,625
I reverse-engineered
their language

392
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,250
using recordings
from the battle.

393
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,375
Any idea why they left

394
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,083
just when they were
kicking our asses?

395
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,500
I have six ideas...

396
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:53,750
[metal creaking]

397
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:58,500
...but I believe that
narrows it down to one.

398
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,291
Oxidized and corroded.

399
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,291
For an alloy like this,
that should take years.

400
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,541
Time runs faster
wherever they come from.

401
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:11,625
They ran off because they...

402
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,375
Because they were dying
of old age.

403
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,500
Huh.

404
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,791
Well, if they come back,

405
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,416
maybe I'll just
evacuate the area

406
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:19,458
and wait till they get cancer.

407
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,125
How did that new kid do?

408
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,291
Invincible?

409
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,375
He has promise,

410
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,583
but he seems unprepared

411
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:28,125
for the more realistic aspects
of super-herodom.

412
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,125
Well, he'd better toughen up.

413
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:31,333
We're gonna need his help.

414
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:32,291
Why?

415
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,458
From one giant shitshow
to another.

416
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,291
Give me some good news, Donald.

417
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,625
Whoever did this cut the power
and the backup.

418
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,625
They killed the cameras
and the security systems.

419
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,458
Forensics, frankly, is stumped.

420
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,958
I told them to start over
and try harder.

421
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,958
That's not good news.

422
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,416
That's not good news at all!

423
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:54,041
I asked you
for some good news, Donald!

424
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,625
Get the hell out.

425
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,125
Everyone.

426
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,375
Come on, you heard the director.
Move it!

427
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,375
[low growling]

428
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,083
Come on out.

429
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:09,375
I know you're there.

430
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,208
Wasn't hiding.

431
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,291
[Donald] Sir, who the hell...

432
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,125
Damien Darkblood,
demon detective.

433
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:27,375
[screaming]

434
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,291
Huh...

435
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,375
Seven superheroes murdered.

436
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:35,166
Strongest man on the planet
almost dead.

437
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,625
No suspects. No leads.

438
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,458
How does he...

439
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,458
I don't know.

440
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,583
Demon magic or something.

441
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:42,333
If you're asking
if we need your help...

442
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,333
[Damien Darkblood]
Wasn't asking.

443
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,541
[screaming]

444
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:49,000
Fine. Knock yourself out.

445
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:52,125
Help us solve the case,
oh, Great-horned Holmes.

446
00:17:52,166 --> 00:17:54,458
Sir... are you sure?

447
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,125
You got a problem
with the demon?

448
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,458
I thought you were
an atheist, Donald.

449
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,916
Th-theoretically.

450
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,000
[growls]

451
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,375
[Amber] Hey.

452
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,458
I heard you took

453
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,875
a few on the chin
for me again.

454
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,291
[Mark] Oh, hey, Amber.

455
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:10,875
Uh, yeah, but don't worry,

456
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,125
I've got this amazing
new strategy

457
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,708
for dealing with Todd.

458
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,708
I let him hit me

459
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,875
until he gets bored
and goes home.

460
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,583
Hmm... nice.

461
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,041
He'll never see it coming.

462
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,791
Unfortunately,
neither will your face.

463
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,041
Eh, people always told me
I was too pretty anyway.

464
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,041
I gotta run.

465
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,708
Catch you later?

466
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,583
Ready?

467
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,875
[♪♪♪]

468
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,625
[chuckles]
Try to keep up.

469
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:41,791
[♪♪♪]

470
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:49,625
[grunts]

471
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:52,625
[♪♪♪]

472
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:55,875
Eve?

473
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:56,958
Eve!

474
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,958
Whoa! Shit!

475
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,333
[yelps]

476
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,583
Oof! [grunts]

477
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,625
[panting]

478
00:19:06,666 --> 00:19:07,500
[grunts]

479
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,833
[chuckling] Okay.

480
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's try this again.

481
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,916
[♪♪♪]

482
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,333
Follow me.

483
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,375
[♪♪♪]

484
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:33,666
[clears throat]
Now what?

485
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:34,583
Oh!

486
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,875
Cool.

487
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,750
[Rex] Ha!

488
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,666
[ping pong balls bouncing]

489
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:45,541
Babe.

490
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,166
[kissing]

491
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,291
[laughs] Oh, hey!

492
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,916
It's the iceman.

493
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,041
Rex...

494
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,833
Couldn't have won
that fight without you.

495
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,916
Oh! Except we did.

496
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:58,875
They got old.

497
00:19:58,916 --> 00:19:59,916
And ran away.

498
00:19:59,958 --> 00:20:01,500
Still counts.

499
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:02,625
[Robot] Welcome, Invincible.

500
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,041
My name is Robot.

501
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,833
Apologies for Rex Splode.
He's...

502
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,583
Unbelievably awesome.

503
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:08,500
Incorrigible.

504
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,625
And rude.

505
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,166
And bored of this.

506
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm Dupli-Kate.

507
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,166
Invincible.

508
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,958
Which one of you do I
look at when we talk?

509
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,666
Hey, Robot,
find anything at the site?

510
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,375
The Flaxans
come from a dimension

511
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,375
with a faster temporal rate.

512
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,666
As a result,

513
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,750
the tachyons they emit
spin more rapidly than our own.

514
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:30,625
I've created this detector
to warn us if they return.

515
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:33,500
Ah, because we almost
missed all the explosions

516
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,875
and the screaming and the chaos.

517
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:39,583
It should give us
a few minutes of early warning.

518
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:40,625
Cecil and the GDA

519
00:20:40,666 --> 00:20:42,125
have also requested
to call on us

520
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,166
for any possible emergencies.

521
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,250
Since the Guardians
are apparently indisposed,

522
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,916
Invincible, may we count on you
in the future?

523
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,708
You sure you want my help?

524
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,166
Yeah, I mean, of course.

525
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,541
Just text me, I guess.

526
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:00,416
Oh, right, you need my number.

527
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I know you don't like
teams much,

528
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:06,583
but they were all pretty cool.

529
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,250
Except Rex Splode.

530
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,750
I do not know
what that guy's problem is.

531
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,250
I think he and Eve
are a thing maybe.

532
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,416
Who's Eve?

533
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,500
Uh...

534
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:17,583
No one.

535
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:19,000
Just-just a friend.

536
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,500
Mm-hmm.

537
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,416
Did you find the dinners
in the freezer?

538
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:24,333
Yeah.

539
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:25,333
Thanks, Mom.

540
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,416
Oh, Mark, I'm sorry.

541
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:31,875
I've been so focused on your dad
that I've forgotten about you.

542
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:32,916
Are you okay?

543
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,750
Donald said you saved
a lot of lives.

544
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,208
Yeah. It was just, um...

545
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,416
harder than I thought.

546
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,333
Dad didn't talk about this part
of being a superhero.

547
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,791
Your dad's good at
a lot of things.

548
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,500
Talking about his feelings
isn't one of them...

549
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:48,583
but we can talk.

550
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,458
Is, uh...
is she okay?

551
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
[doctor] Her name's Maya.

552
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:03,791
Doesn't she have
any family?

553
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,375
We've contacted them, yes,
but this is a secure facility.

554
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:08,500
She's not strong enough

555
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,791
for us to transfer her
to a normal hospital.

556
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:12,458
But she'll be okay?

557
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,916
Well, it's too soon to tell,
but I hope so.

558
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:23,166

00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:28,833
Don't hit me where I am,

748
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:30,041
hit me where I'm going...

749
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,625
[laughs] Thanks for the tip.

750
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:36,791
You know, you have to be able
to take a hit, too.

751
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:37,916
[Debbie] Nolan!

752
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:44,083
Oh, great.

753
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:45,833
We picked this up
near Mars an hour ago.

754
00:30:45,875 --> 00:30:47,708
Moving fast.

755
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,833
He's back.

756
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:51,250
15 minutes
till he's breathing our air.

757
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:53,208
I wouldn't ask, Nolan,

758
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,958
but with the Guardians gone...

759
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,416
I'll stop him.

760
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:57,500
Who's he?

761
00:30:57,541 --> 00:30:58,916
Nolan's been home a week,

762
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:00,666
and you want to send him
to space?

763
00:31:00,708 --> 00:31:02,541
No. No way.

764
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:03,666
He doesn't work for you.

765
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:04,625
[Nolan] Sweetie...

766
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,250
There's no one else, Debbie.

767
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,083
I'll go.

768
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:08,750
-Sweetie...
-I said, no.

769
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:09,833
You're still injured.

770
00:31:09,875 --> 00:31:10,666
I'll go.

771
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:11,833
Okay.

772
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:13,750
-What?
-Why not?

773
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:14,750
He's not that tough.
Mark can take him.

774
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:16,416
[Debbie] Oh, wonderful.

775
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,333
That's your solution?

776
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:19,958
Could you define
"not that tough"?

777
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,291
Just knock some sense
into the guy

778
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:22,583
and throw him
back where he came from.

779
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:23,625
Easy.

780
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,500
How do I breathe in space?

781
00:31:27,541 --> 00:31:28,833
[Nolan] That's the neat thing.

782
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,875
You don't.

783
00:31:30,916 --> 00:31:32,416
12 minutes.

784
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,250
[nervously] Okay...

785
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,166
[inhales deeply]

786
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,291
[grunts]

787
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:59,333
[communicating telepathically]
Hey, you're early!

788
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,333
And you shaved your mustache.

789
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,166
[replying telepathically]
Stay away from my planet!

790
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:06,625
[grunting]

791
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,083
Not bad,

792
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:15,041
but if you're trying
to tackle me into something,

793
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,708
your moon is that way!

794
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,291
Why can I hear you in my head?

795
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:25,958
Where else
do you keep your brain?

796
00:32:27,833 --> 00:32:28,875
[grunting]

797
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:35,333
That's what you call
protecting your planet?

798
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,375
I am sad for your people!

799
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:38,791
[gasping for breath]

800
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,583
[roaring, Mark grunts]

801
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,291
[panting]

802
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,375
[inhales deeply]

803
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,375
[♪♪♪]

804
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,750
Are you sure you're the same guy
I fought here three years ago?

805
00:32:57,791 --> 00:32:59,708
What? No, I'm not the same guy!

806
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,333
Well, sucks to be you then.

807
00:33:01,375 --> 00:33:02,208
Ah, my eye!

808
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:03,958
[grunts]

809
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,791
Really?

810
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:06,291
-You tried this already.
-Huh?

811
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,791
Ha!

812
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,625
Maybe you'll do after all.

813
00:33:15,666 --> 00:33:17,791
What are you talking about?

814
00:33:17,833 --> 00:33:18,750
[grunting]

815
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,333
Wait! Stop! I...

816
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:23,916
Hold on, I just wanna...

817
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:24,833
I wanna talk!

818
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:27,875
Are you using your time out?

819
00:33:27,916 --> 00:33:29,708
I get a time out?

820
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,875
Why do I get a time out?

821
00:33:30,916 --> 00:33:32,791
Hey, I didn't invent the rules.

822
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,875
What rules?

823
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,791
I don't even know who you are!

824
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,875
Oh. You don't?

825
00:33:52,791 --> 00:33:54,416
All right, um...

826
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:57,291
I'm an evaluation officer
for the Coalition of Planets.

827
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:59,625
I drop by little dirtballs
like yours

828
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:02,208
to make sure there's someone
capable of defending them

829
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,583
against, you know,
planet-conquering monsters,

830
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,333
things of that nature.

831
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:10,291
I literally have no idea
what any of that means.

832
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,625
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, man.

833
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,500
Your planet signed up
for the program.

834
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:14,500
See?

835
00:34:14,541 --> 00:34:15,750
Request from Urath
for evaluation.

836
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:16,750
Urath!

837
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,083
This is Earth!

838
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:22,000
Earth?

839
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,083
Yes!

840
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,583
Not Urath?

841
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:25,666
No.

842
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:27,750
Is that with an "E"
or a "U"?

843
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,791
"E"!

844
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,541
Oh, I'm in so much trouble.

845
00:34:31,583 --> 00:34:33,291
Well, thanks
for letting me know.

846
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,458
I'm Allen, by the way.

847
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,708
Invincible.

848
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,000
[chuckling]
Oh, yeah?

849
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:39,500
A little optimistic, isn't it?

850
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:40,416
Yeah, I know.

851
00:34:40,458 --> 00:34:41,416
I just fought you,

852
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,833
and I think
you're quite "vincible."

853
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,833
Okay, well, as long as
I don't get fired,

854
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,750
I'll see you around, Invincible.

855
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:49,833
Sorry about all the...

856
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:51,708
you know.

857
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,291
What the hell was that?

858
00:34:57,958 --> 00:35:00,625
Wow.

859
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,083
Cool.

860
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,833
Before I go...

861
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:07,125
I already told you
everything I remember.

862
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,708
Right.

863
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,416
Right, just go over it
for me one more time.

864
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:15,083
I got a distress call
from the Guardians,

865
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:18,333
but when I arrived,
everything seemed fine.

866
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:21,041
Then the lights went out
and someone attacked me.

867
00:35:21,083 --> 00:35:23,708
I fought with them
until I passed out.

868
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,166
Woke up in your hospital.

869
00:35:25,208 --> 00:35:26,250
That's it.

870
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,708
That's it?

871
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,958
Hmm.

872
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,666
Must have been
a pretty tough bastard

873
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,791
to take you down.

874
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:35,791
I've never seen you lose
like that before.

875
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,750
Yeah.

876
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,333
Do you have any leads yet?

877
00:35:41,375 --> 00:35:43,250
Someone thinks
they're too clever for us.

878
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,458
They all think that at first.

879
00:35:54,958 --> 00:35:56,375
[woman] Oh, my God!

880
00:35:56,416 --> 00:35:57,416
[student shouts] Ow!

881
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,291
Oh, great.

882
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,875
[student] Excuse you.

883
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:02,625
Look, Todd.

884
00:36:02,666 --> 00:36:03,833
Why don't we just...

885
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:04,916
Shut it, Grayson!

886
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,166
-I'm sorry.
-What?

887
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:09,500
I'm sorry I kicked your ass.

888
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,500
I don't know
what you're saying.

889
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:17,625
I'm sorry
I kicked your ass, okay?

890
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,958
Oh.

891
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,166
Thanks, I guess?

892
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,375
Amber Bennett
also wants to know

893
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,041
-if you'd like her number.
-What?

894
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,166
Do you want Amber's
phone number, nerd!

895
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:30,333
Yes, but why are you...

896
00:36:30,375 --> 00:36:32,250
Because she found
some old photos of me, okay?

897
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:34,708
Photos she said she'd delete
if I did this one stupid thing,

898
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,833
and then never
talked to you again.

899
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,333
There.

900
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:38,625
Have a crappy life with her.

901
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,208
You both suck.

902
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:45,041
[Mark] Photos of what, Todd?

903
00:36:45,083 --> 00:36:47,333
Don't push your luck, Grayson.

904
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,291
[cell phone rings]

905
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,208
Amber?

906
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,625
I-I mean, uh, hello?

907
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,208
[screaming]

908
00:37:05,041 --> 00:37:06,500
Brax moy!

909
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:12,750
I have bad news.

910
00:37:12,791 --> 00:37:14,333
[sarcastically] Oh!

911
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:16,625
Robot's got bad news, everybody.

912
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:17,750
Did ya hear that?

913
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:20,583
Hey, Robot,
what's the bad news?

914
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:21,791
[Robot]
There are too many of them,

915
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,500
their technology
has advanced too far,

916
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:26,708
and they've rendered themselves
immune to our time stream.

917
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,500
We should consider
the city lost.

918
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:31,333
I will contact Cecil
and suggest a nuclear response.

919
00:37:31,375 --> 00:37:32,625
What? No!

920
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,875
No way!

921
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:39,000
We're not nuking anyone, Robot,
and we're not giving up.

922
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:41,041
What are we, Fight Force?

923
00:37:41,083 --> 00:37:42,041
I love you, man,

924
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:45,458
but sometimes,
you've got a screw loose.

925
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,083
I don't use screws.

926
00:37:47,125 --> 00:37:49,458
My fastenings are all
magnetic interlocks.

927
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:54,125

928
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,416

938
00:38:18,833 --> 00:38:19,833
Invincible!

939
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:22,375
Ah!

942
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:35,791
[quietly] Help.

[cackles]

944
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,208
Die.

[groaning]

946
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,500
Are you okay, Mark?

[grunting]

948
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,750
[blasters all firing]

949
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,750
My turn.

950
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:09,958
H'ah!

951
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:17,833
H'ah!

952
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,791

[grunting in alien language]

954

[roaring]

957
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:47,541
Dad!

958
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:50,708
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

959
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,541
Omni-Man's your dad?

960
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,750
[sighs]

961
00:40:04,708 --> 00:40:06,541
[gasps]
What happened?

962
00:40:06,583 --> 00:40:09,166
Dad saved us from the Flaxans...

963
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:12,375
but he went into
one of their portals.

964
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:13,333
Oh.

965
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,541
So he'll be late for dinner?

966
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,125
I was worried before

967
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,750
because I've never seen
your father so badly hurt,

968
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,750
but taking on aliens
in another dimension?

969
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,250
That's just Tuesday.

970
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:31,041
I'm sure he's explaining nicely
why they should leave us alone.

971
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:33,416
[♪♪♪]

972
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:35,916
You don't seem to understand.

973
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:39,583
Earth isn't yours to conquer.

974
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,708

[♪♪♪]

978
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:27,541
I need a shower.

979
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,791
Dad!

980
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,708
[news report theme plays]

981
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:37,708
I'm-I'm at a loss
for how to report this,

982
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:43,041
but the Guardians of the Globe
are dead.

983
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,916
Get an extraction team
out there now.

984
00:41:51,958 --> 00:41:54,833
Tell the French President
we have it covered.

985
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:56,000

986
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,333
[sighs]

987
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:01,416
I need the room.

988
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,583
Now!

989
00:42:05,708 --> 00:42:07,875
Well? Enlighten me.

990
00:42:07,916 --> 00:42:10,000
Know one thing for sure.

991
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,458
No one else at scene of murders.

992
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,541
Only Guardians.

993
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:16,000
Omni-Man.

994
00:42:16,041 --> 00:42:19,041
Which means killer must be
one of them.

995
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:20,375
[Cecil] One of them?

996
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,583
There's a hundred super-villains
who don't leave a trace.

997
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,500
Who turn into smoke,
or living electricity,

998
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:28,250
or only exist in dreams.

999
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,500
I know.

1000
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,000
You don't listen to me.

1001
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:32,083
You listen!

1002
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:34,250
Now, you mention
your idiotic thoughts to anyone,

1003
00:42:34,291 --> 00:42:35,708
and I mean anybody,

1004
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,708
I'll make sure they're
the last thoughts you ever have.

1005
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,083
You understand me?

1006
00:42:39,125 --> 00:42:41,000
Now, get out.

1007
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,541
Get out!

1008
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:45,583
Before I send you
back to hell myself.

[growls]

1010
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,500
Blind old man.

[sighs]

1012
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:53,208
Put an A-6 surveillance team
on the Graysons.

1013
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,500
[Donald] Sir?

1014
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:56,791
The killer's
still out there, Donald.

1015
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,291
Might decide
to finish the job.
