- Yeah, light day.
- [MARK] Dad.

899
00:50:42,081 --> 00:50:44,000
Dad, look.
I'm gonna be...

900
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,294
Duct Tape Man.

901
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,795
Like, even if
I don't get powers,

902
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,839
I can just tie people up
with duct tape.

903
00:50:49,922 --> 00:50:52,592
You can do anything
with duct tape.

904
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:57,096
I don't know if
that's gonna work as well as

905
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:58,973
you hope it will, kiddo.

906
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:03,436
And you might rethink
that as we peel all this off.

907
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:07,106
Go upstairs and run a bath.
That should... help.

908
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,067
A little. [CHUCKLES]

909
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,945
That boy is never
getting his powers, is he?

910
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:14,447
Don't ask me.

911
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,824
You're the superhero
space alien.

912
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:21,162
But even if he doesn't,
we'll love him just as much.

913
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:23,664
Finish dinner
while I untape the boy.
