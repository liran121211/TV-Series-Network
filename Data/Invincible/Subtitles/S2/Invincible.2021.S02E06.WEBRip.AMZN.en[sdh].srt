Okay, can I just say

369
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,512
this feels like a first date?

370
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,764
Yeah, a bad first date.

371
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:55,974
[weak chuckle]

372
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,685
I missed you.

373
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,396
I missed you, too.

374
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,981
[sighs]

375
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,650
I really thought college
would be different.

376
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,152
Right?

377
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,154
You know, like,
late night study sessions,

378
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:11,156
secret dorm parties,

379
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,241
spending time
with my girlfriend.

380
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,329
Instead, we hang out
less than we did

381
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,123
before we went to college.

382
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,335
Whenever my friends here
ask where you are,

383
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,088
I'm always like, "Oh, Mark's
studying for an exam"

384
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,132
or "He went home
for the weekend."

385
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,510
I hate lying to them, Mark.

386
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,013
And I have no one
to talk to about it. I mean,

387
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:36,389
sure, there's William,

388
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,266
but he's more your friend
than mine.

389
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,935
Yeah, I know.

390
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,437
It's our first year of college,

391
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,855
our first time
living on our own,

392
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,483
and it feels like
we're missing it.

393
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,360
Yeah, sometimes I wish
I never got powers.

394
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:53,198
Then I could just be with you

395
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:55,366
and forget about
everything else.

396
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,994
But you do have powers.

397
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,746
And that means
you have an obligation

398
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,331
to make the world
a better place.

399
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,500
And if you didn't feel that way,

400
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,376
we wouldn't be dating
to begin with.

401
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,671
So...

402
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,882
what do we do now?

403
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,099
[exhales]

404
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:24,312
Mark, look who's back.

405
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,524
- Whoa, Rick.
How are you feeling?
- Hi, Mark.

406
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,026
Um, I-I guess

407
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,028
I'm fine.

408
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,030
He's doing great.

409
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,615
Doctors gave him
a clean bill of health.

410
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,243
Donald says he can
come back to Upstate, right?

411
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:41,704
I'm here to help facilitate
his transition.

412
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,458
If there's anything I can do,
just call me.

413
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,669
That is so kind. Thank you.

414
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,838
Come on, Rick,
I guilted the college into

415
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,464
giving you a private room
in the dorm next door.

416
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,759
I already decorated it.

417
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,594
Wow, Rick looks
exactly the same.

418
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,596
It's like nothing happened.

419
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,932
[Donald] But something
did happen.

420
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:04,143
He went through intensive
body reconstruction.

421
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,230
That kind of trauma can...

422
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,107
resurface.

423
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,110
Donald, are you okay?

424
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,531
Tell William I'll check in later

425
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,492
- to see how Rick's doing.
- Uh, okay.

426
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,785
Bye.

427
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:24,455
<i>[Rex] Well, you look</i>

428
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,082
like shit.

429
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,502
And that's coming from a guy
that looks like this.

430
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:31,379
[chuckles] Heard you're getting

431
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,714
a new hand, too.

432
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:36,551
[laughs] Yeah. Lucky me.

433
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,761
How's Ray?

434
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,722
Holding in there.

435
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:45,852
You know, when that bullet
went through my head,

436
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,105
I saw my life flash
before my eyes.

437
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:53,902
Yeah, that's always sounded
like bullshit to me, too,

438
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,570
but it's not.

439
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,240
And I didn't like what I saw.

440
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:02,952
I was such a dick to Kate.

441
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:05,246
To Eve, too.

442
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,083
To every woman I've ever dated.

443
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,836
None of them deserved it.

444
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,797
I don't know why I had to get

445
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,467
my brains blown out to see that.

446
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,553
What is it about
being a superhero

447
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:24,098
where we go around saving lives

448
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,434
while ruining them
at the same time?

449
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,438
Aw, Jesus.

450
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:33,733
- All right, let's hear it.
- Hear what?

451
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:36,110
Eh. The reason your face

452
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:40,114
looks all... like that.

453
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:43,618
[sighs] I don't know.
You know, sad and shit.

454
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,087
[gasps]

455
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,130
Uh, Mark.

456
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,049
Oh, hey, Eve.

457
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,842
You here to see Rex?

458
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:03,262
Yeah. I try to stop in
when I can.

459
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,266
Oh, these? Uh, um,

460
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,979
turns out Rex really likes
home decorating magazines.

461
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:15,733
I think it's because he's never
really had a home.

462
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,778
Hey, I haven't seen you
since Kate's funeral.

463
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,488
Are you okay, Mark?

464
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,865
Yeah. No, um,

465
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,993
I'm fine. [chuckles]

466
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:28,830
Anyway, I-I got to run,
so I'll see you around.

467
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,373
Okay.

468
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,625
Bye.

469
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,585
- [door opens]
- Eve!

470
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:37,505
[grunts]
The bearer of spring colors

471
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:41,092
and waterfall countertops.
[groans]

472
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,804
You're the only person I know
who still reads magazines.

473
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,141
Whoa, ho, ho, ho!
I'm cultured like that.

474
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:50,935
And plus, the Internet sucks.

475
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,855
So, I just

476
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,690
- ran into Mark, and...
- Ugh.

477
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,358
I know, right?

478
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,695
He and Amber are...
[blows raspberry]

479
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,448
Wait, what does that mean?

480
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,158
Oh, oh, oh! [grunts]

481
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,285
Ten best bedroom makeovers?

482
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,203
[chuckles] Yes, please.

483
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,373
{\an8} <i>[Debbie] So, Helga,</i>

484
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,792
{\an8}you've been a nanny
for 30 years.

485
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,545
{\an8}- Children are my life.
- [Oliver laughs]

486
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,548
Your résumé's very impressive.

487
00:22:20,631 --> 00:22:22,258
Yes.

488
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,177
But I don't think
you're the right fit for us.

489
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,554
- No?
- No.

490
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,431
I'm not comfortable
hiring a spy.

491
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:32,351
Spy? I... I don't understand.

492
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,187
I was married to Nolan
for 20 years.

493
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,773
I can spot Cecil's people
a mile away.

494
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,275
So, thank you. Bye-bye.

495
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,570
[scoffs] That man
cannot take a hint.

496
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:44,197
[knock on door]

497
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,617
Hi. I'm April Howsam,

498
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,243
here for the nanny position.

499
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:52,789
Before we begin, you should know
that Cecil sent me.

500
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,248
Now, I wasn't
supposed to tell you,

501
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,583
but I think it's unacceptable

502
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,752
to mislead a potential employer.

503
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,879
Especially one
looking for someone

504
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,923
to take care of their child.

505
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,053
Please come in.

506
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,807
{\an8}As you can see,
I have extensive experience

507
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,183
{\an8}working with gifted children

508
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,477
{\an8}ranging from newborns
to late teens.

509
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,229
So, you know that Oliver is...

510
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,231
Half Thraxan, half Viltrumite.

511
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:22,068
I also know that Nolan Grayson,
or Omni-Man, is Oliver's father.

512
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,946
And that your son Mark,
also Invincible,

513
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:26,697
is Oliver's half-brother.

514
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:29,033
You've been
thoroughly briefed, I see.

515
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:31,994
My philosophy
on child rearing is simple.

516
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:36,916
Encourage a child's natural
curiosity for the world...

517
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,751
Here you go, buddy.

518
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:42,547
While giving him structure

519
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,174
and a safe space
to grow and learn.

520
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:48,094
I also play a mean lullaby

521
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,470
on the ukulele.

522
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:52,056
I appreciate
your honesty, April.

523
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,101
But I don't want
a GDA agent in my house

524
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:58,771
running interference for Cecil
on how to raise Oliver.

525
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:02,733
There's only a handful of people
in the world with my skill set.

526
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:05,027
This allows me job security

527
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:07,697
and freedom
from government oversight.

528
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,907
I work for you, Ms. Grayson,

529
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:12,869
not Cecil. Period.

530
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,287
You're the boss.

531
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,205
{\an8}Not him.

532
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,082
{\an8}[short chuckle] Mama boss.

533
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,918
[laughs] See?

534
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:23,171
Oliver knows who's in charge.

535
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,506
[coos] Mama boss.

536
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,973
[Cecil] Real nice place
you made here, Eve.

537
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:35,183
Cecil?

538
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,351
[Cecil] Reminds me
of where I grew up.

539
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,106
I wanted to thank you,
personally, for helping out

540
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,525
with the whole sequid business.

541
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:47,528
And to once again offer you
a spot on the Guardians.

542
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:51,115
- [sighs] Cecil...
- Dupli-Kate's dead.

543
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,368
Rae and Rex are in the hospital,
and Immortal is...

544
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:57,788
well, let's be frank... his head
is not in the game right now.

545
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,958
So, what do you say?
Ready to join the team?

546
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,628
You're old friends
with half of 'em anyway.

547
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,672
[sighs] Cecil...

548
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:10,635
uh... you know,
I'm still figuring out

549
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:12,303
what kind of hero I want to be.

550
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,222
And that's not
the kind of person

551
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,848
you need on the Guardians.

552
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:20,186
But you know how to find me
if you need my help again.

553
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:23,606
And you know where to find me
when you change your mind.

554
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,024
Thanks for your time, Eve.

555
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:27,109
I'll leave you
to your guest now.

556
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:29,362
What guest?

557
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:30,988
[Amber] Eve?

558
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,114
You up there?

559
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,659
Amber?

560
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:37,954
{\an8}[panting] Your place really
blends in with the trees.

561
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,539
{\an8}I walked past it,
like, five times.

562
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,376
Can we talk?

563
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:46,754
[up-tempo jazz playing quietly]

564
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,307
[door opens, closes]

565
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,394
I told you it's gonna be
another four hours.

566
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,729
You want it done fast
or done right?

567
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,023
[Mark] Hey, Art.

568
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,942
Mark.

569
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,777
Sorry, I-I thought
you were someone else.

570
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,153
Just leave your suit

571
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,281
and I'll have it fixed
by morning.

572
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:15,700
I actually came to talk.

573
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,827
But if you're busy, I can...

574
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:21,205
- What's on your mind?
- Well, um...

575
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,835
Ah, I see.

576
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:26,961
[laughs]

577
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,254
Girl trouble.

578
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,589
That obvious, huh?

579
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,925
It's all over your face, kid.

580
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:34,135
Pull up a chair.

581
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:42,393
And I, I love Amber and I want
to be with her, but...

582
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:45,730
it-it feels like the universe
is conspiring against us.

583
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:50,067
Ugh. It doesn't matter if you're
a superhero or an ordinary Joe.

584
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:52,987
Relationships aren't easy.
I should know.

585
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,031
I've been
in plenty of them in my day.

586
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,658
I-I've only dated one guy.

587
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:00,786
Rex was my first
serious boyfriend.

588
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,374
Which is sad and embarrassing
to admit out loud.

589
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,084
We all got to start somewhere.

590
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,128
You know, we'd known
each other for years,

591
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:11,130
it just kind of made sense,
and...

592
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:13,966
and it was good for a while.

593
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,469
Until I finally had
enough of him cheating on me

594
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,722
every time he left the tower.

595
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,767
It was the lying that hurt more.

596
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,728
He made me feel like I was crazy
when I started figuring it out.

597
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,063
That really sucked.

598
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,691
Yeah, the lying was
the worst part for me, too.

599
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,193
But I thought
after we got over that,

600
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,236
it'd work out.

601
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,364
Mark puts himself on the line
for people he doesn't even know,

602
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,366
and that takes real...

603
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:41,869
...guts to not care what
anyone else thinks, you know?

604
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,371
And Amber always does
the right thing.

605
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:46,624
It's inspiring.
She makes me a better person.

606
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:50,086
A real catch.
So what's the problem?

607
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,964
The problem is, I'm...

608
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,466
Invincible.

609
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:56,842
Whether it's a tsunami

610
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,428
or some psycho with rocket
launchers for arms,

611
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:00,721
when bad things happen,

612
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:02,598
Mark has to drop
everything and go.

613
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:07,019
Yeah. Everything.

614
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,437
Including you.

615
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:13,275
I don't care when Mark cancels
our date or forgets to text.

616
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,862
I mean, he's saving the world.
It's, it's not that.

617
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,448
It's that it makes me
feel like a...

618
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,826
...jerk, because
I'm doing exactly to her

619
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,161
what my dad did
to me and my mom.

620
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,038
But we never complained

621
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,165
because A) it made us
feel like assholes,

622
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,167
and B) we didn't want
to distract Dad

623
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,086
from saving the world.

624
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:37,550
[sighs] I-I don't want
that kind of life for Amber.

625
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,926
She deserves better.

626
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,012
Well, if you guys can't
always be together,

627
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,932
then make the times
you are together count.

628
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,934
That doesn't work either.

629
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,061
When we're together,
I feel guilty.

630
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:52,606
Like I'm taking him away
from people who really need him.

631
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,275
Mark needs someone who...

632
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,818
...is there for her.

633
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,361
Who really understands

634
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,989
what she's going through
in college and...

635
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,908
...what it's like
dating a superhero.

636
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,493
I can't talk to anyone about it.

637
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:06,579
Not my friends.
Not my family.

638
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,832
So now I'm the liar
instead of him.

639
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:11,959
I knew dating Mark
would be difficult.

640
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,003
I just didn't know
it would be so lonely.

641
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,256
- I feel like I'm failing Amber.
- I feel like I'm failing Mark.

642
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,009
You're not saving
the world right now.

643
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,719
And Mark's back on Earth.

644
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,680
So I guess the question
you have to ask yourself is...

645
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,892
[both] Why are you here talking
to me when you should be talking

646
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,226
- to him?
- to her?

647
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,103
Go home, Mark.

648
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:34,648
Go home and be
with your girlfriend.

649
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,611
Yeah. Thanks for listening, Art.

650
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,696
Hey, your mom told me
what happened

651
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,698
with your dad on Thraxa.

652
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,577
That had to be tough.
Seeing him again.

653
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,288
[Mark] Even after everything
he did,

654
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:52,082
I didn't realize
how much I missed him.

655
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:53,375
I don't know.

656
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:56,504
Maybe that makes me
a bad person or something.

657
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,465
It makes you human.

658
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,716
And then the last thing
he told me

659
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,093
before the Viltrumites
took him away wasn't

660
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,138
"I love you" or "I'm sorry."

661
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:08,766
It was, "Read my books."

662
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,976
[chuckles] Why did he say that?

663
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,269
I don't know.

664
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:14,855
My mom threw out
all his stuff when I was away.

665
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,690
I got his travel books
from the library,

666
00:30:16,774 --> 00:30:18,776
but nothing popped out.

667
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,612
Nolan wrote more
than just travel books.

668
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:22,738
What?

669
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,323
He wrote sci-fi novels

670
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:26,784
under a pen name
when you were a kid.

671
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:30,037
None of them sold great,
so he gave it up.

672
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,165
Can you believe he gave them
to me as a tip once?

673
00:30:33,249 --> 00:30:37,253
[laughs] A big spender,
your dad was not.

674
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:41,924
[Mark] <i>Lost Inside
the Chasm to Oblivion?</i>

675
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,093
<i>Hate Tribes on the Planet Wrekk?</i>

676
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,721
I told Nolan they were great.
Real exciting.

677
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,891
Uh... I never read 'em.

678
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,354
[William] After the quad
got destroyed,

679
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,065
they just rebuilt it
exactly the same.

680
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,485
A missed opportunity,
if you ask me.

681
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:02,736
I...

682
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,906
I don't remember this.

683
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,161
It, uh, commemorates
D.A. Sinclair's, uh... victims.

684
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,622
Victims?

685
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:17,585
You're the only one
who, uh... recovered.

686
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,462
You hungry? [chuckles]

687
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:24,466
They did upgrade the waffle
maker in the cafeteria.

688
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,094
I see flashes sometimes.

689
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:31,056
Sinclair's face, a, a scalpel.

690
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,852
But it's like I'm watching
someone else's nightmare.

691
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:37,646
Am I... me again, William?

692
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,857
What? Of course you're you.

693
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,569
D.A. Sinclair took
so much of me away.

694
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,362
I don't think they found it all.

695
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:50,284
Who am I if I can't even
remember what I'm missing?

696
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,578
Rick, I'm so sorry.

697
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,374
It's going to be all right.
I promise.

698
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:00,753
We'll get through this together.

699
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,052
<i>The Man with the Invincible Gun.</i>

700
00:32:08,135 --> 00:32:10,346
[scoffs] Catchy title, Dad.

701
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,724
<i>"Little was known
about the Space Rider.</i>

702
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,644
<i>He was a mystery.
The stuff of legends.</i>

703
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:18,812
<i>[Mark and Nolan] Stories
about him stretched across..."</i>

704
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,481
<i>[Nolan] ...the 12 galaxies.</i>

705
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:21,732
<i>But in all of them,</i>

706
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,901
<i>one detail remained constant.</i>

707
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,737
<i>The Infinity Ray.</i>

708
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,783
<i>It was said to emit
an unstoppable energy wave</i>

709
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,452
<i>that destroyed
anything in its path.</i>

710
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,580
<i>But it required a steady hand</i>

711
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:41,043
<i>and, more importantly,
a steady mind.</i>

712
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,965
<i>For it wasn't a weapon
to be used in haste.</i>

713
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,137
<i>No one has ever gotten
close enough</i>

714
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,265
<i>to study the Infinity Ray
for themselves.</i>

715
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:04,233
<i>The Space Rider always
makes sure of that.</i>

716
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:23,961
<i>If the Infinity Ray
is indeed real</i>

717

00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:23,839
and how you can help.

888
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,216
Grab your stuff Mark,
we got to boogie.

889
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:27,717
What? No.

890
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,344
I-I just got back from space.

891
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,931
Twice. I'm not going back
just to talk to your boss.

892
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,851
This could be our chance to end
Viltrumite tyranny for good.

893
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,352
Isn't that what you want?

894
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,563
Of course.

895
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:42,607
But Amber and I
are in a weird place,

896
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:44,818
and now that my mom's
looking after my half brother,

897
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,528
I can't just ditch her.

898
00:40:47,696 --> 00:40:49,948
Are we gonna have to fight now?

899
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,325
Nah. I don't fight friends.

900
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:55,203
Because I would win
and then I'd feel terrible.

901
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,705
It's a vicious cycle.

902
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,540
But... I should get going.

903
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,083
Thaedus will not
be happy with me.

904
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,419
Maybe I can help with that.

905
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:07,465
I have a hunch about something,

906
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:09,092
but I need a second opinion.

907
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,014
Huh, this place
sounds kind of familiar.

908
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,019
Hey, is that Space Racer?

909
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,147
It's Space Rider in the book.

910
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,857
It's Space Racer in real life,

911
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,609
and he is legendary,

912
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,777
in that no one is sure
if he's real or not.

913
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:31,948
Okay, so I think everything
in these books is real.

914
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,993
And it's all stuff
that can hurt Viltrumites.

915
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:37,120
That's why my dad
wanted me to read his books.

916
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,955
He's telling us
how to defeat the Empire.

917
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,582
Oh, shit.

918
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:43,919
Can I, uh, can I scan these
to take back to the Coalition?

919
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,337
Of course.

920
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,172
Thaedus will be
a lot less pissed

921
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,257
when I show him all of this.

922
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,473
All right. Got it.

923
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,849
It was good seeing
you again, Mark.

924
00:41:57,933 --> 00:41:59,643
Thank you. And I'm very sorry

925
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,645
about your father's impending

926
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,855
or already completed execution.

927
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:05,815
Uh, thanks.

928
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:08,235
I-I still don't get why
they took him away

929
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,403
when they could've just
killed him on Thraxa.

930
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,864
I've heard rumors
of a Viltrumite prison

931
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,741
somewhere in space.
Maybe they took him there.

932
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:16,368
Want me to ask around?

933
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:18,286
I'd appreciate that.

934
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,083
Tell Thaedus that
when it's time to attack,

935
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:26,294
when you need someone
for the actual fight,

936
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:28,171
I'll be there.

937
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,590
Count on it.

Are you and Amber done yet?

941

That sock's been
on the door for hours,

942
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,850

949

there is a path to redemption.

950

Rejoin your people, Nolan.

brought glory to the Empire.

greatest warriors.

956
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:30,275
turn you into a weak,
