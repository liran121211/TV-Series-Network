1
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,319
<i>Target is Doc Seismic.</i>

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,847
Huh?

3
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,117
{\an8}We're going
to college together.

4
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:18,060
<i>I guess I get to keep my
superhero boyfriend after all.</i>

5
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:19,729
The Immortal's now in charge.

6
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,689
{\an8}<i>We are down,
Houston.</i>

7
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,567
{\an8}<i>If a single
sequid fuses with</i>

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,070
{\an8}<i>one of your people,
they will rise up as one.</i>

9
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:29,905
Finally, some action!

10
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,117
<i>I always wanted
to be my dad.</i>

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,411
What if that happens?

12
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,663
It's been an honor, sir.

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,624
<i>I'm better.</i>

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,793
- I'm stronger. I'm ready.
- No, you're not.

15
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,003
<i>I'll work for you,</i>

16
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,505
<i>just put me back out there.</i>

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,134
For some
of you,

18
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:54,054
it probably seemed like
this day would never come.

19
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:55,973
For others,

20
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:58,642
it came far too quickly.

21
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:02,605
Maybe you're even wondering
if you're ready for this.

22
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,483
For what comes next.

23
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:08,402
You are.
I look out at this class

24
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:10,988
and I see hope.

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,992
I see a bright new world
with a special place

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,038
for each and every one of you.
You may not know yet...

27
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:23,125
Mark's not seriously gonna miss
his own graduation, is he?

28
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:24,489
He's just running a little late.

29
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,796
This is why I quit superheroing.

30
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,257
I mean, you only get to say
goodbye to high school once.

31
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,926
It needs to be enjoyed.

32
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:34,970
Appreciated. Savored.

33
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:36,931
He'll be here. He promised.

34
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,726
Look at you.
You're thieves! Rapists!

35
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,895
Criminals.

36
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,606
All so ignorant of your

37
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,817
true crimes
against terra therma.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:52,196
What is it with you and
historical monuments? S... Uh,

39
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,323
Professor Seismic, right?

40
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,033
Doc Seismic.

41
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,576
I never taught.

42
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,621
Didn't you fall into,
like, a huge pool of lava?

43
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,833
I fell into a new realm
of understanding.

44
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,668
Do you know what this obscene

45
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,628
phallus is constructed from?

46
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,548
He asked, expecting
some idiotic answer.

47
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,008
Uh...

48
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:15,094
Granite stolen from the Earth.

49
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:18,097
Iron ripped from her loins.

50
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,808
Bricks made of the clay
she bleeds

51
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,936
from humanity's
endless ruinations.

52
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,605
Isn't that most buildings?

53
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:32,194
You can keep the ones
made of wood.

54
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:35,573
Everything else,
we're taking back.

55
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,116
Ha!

56
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,039
Ah!

57
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:51,442
I made
a few new friends

58
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:54,091
during my time underground.

59
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,553
Meet my Magmanites.

60
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,936
I liked you better
when you just hated presidents.

61
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:09,440
As you find your place
in the world,

62
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,734
know that it
won't always be easy.

63
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,653
Sometimes, life hits you
with everything it's got.

64
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,785
Huh?

65
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:44,600
{\an8}The Earth reclaims
her stolen flesh.

66
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,994
<i>When you find yourself</i>

67
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:49,188
<i>in the shadow of adversity,
do not be afraid.</i>

68
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,273
For without adversity,

69
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,943
there can be no triumph.

70
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,945
Without testing your limits,

71
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,323
you will never know
how strong you truly are.

72
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,640
<i>You're
running out of time, kid.</i>

73
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,142
I know.

74
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,480
Aah!

75
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,987
See? Even your greatest heroes
are useless

76
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:41,490
against the power of Doc...

77
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,170
<i>Nice save, Mark.</i>

78
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:57,315
<i>Would've been better if you had
stopped him before he destroyed</i>

79
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,216
<i>another one of America's
greatest treasures.</i>

80
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,760
It's not destroyed.

81
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:05,097
I could, you know,
I could try pushing it back out

82
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,058
- to, you know...
<i>- Do not do that.</i>

83
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,727
<i>We'll take it from here.</i>

84
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,103
<i>As the great</i>

85
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,896
Abraham Lincoln once said,

86
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,525
"Whatever you are,
be a good one."

87
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,403
Did he, though?
Did he really say that?

88
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,530
Doesn't sound very Lincoln-y.

89
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,323
So,
all I missed were the

90
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,743
made-up inspirational
quotes? Cool.

91
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,078
Hey there, hero. Good timing.

92
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,162
- Mm.
- Mm.

93
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,083
Is that... sulfur?

94
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,252
Oh, man, wait till
I tell you about this guy.

95
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,172
He's a case
against higher education.

96
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,258
Amber
Justine Bennett.

97
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,179
Yeah!

98
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,139
William
Francis Clockwell.

99
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,184
I'd say it's been fun,
but, you know...

100
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,477
high school.

101
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,812
Markus
Sebastian Grayson.

102
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,732
Let's go, Markus.

103
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,068
Samantha
Eve Wilkins.

104
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,740
Markus Sebastian?

105
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:07,951
I thought we weren't keeping
secrets from each other anymore.

106
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,828
Some secrets should never

107
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,414
be revealed... Justine.

108
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,628
Everyone, please rise.

109
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,880
Congratulations, graduates.

110
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,757
Yeah!

111
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,303
Ooh, crap.

112
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:29,723
Remember, be bold,

113
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:32,726
be original, be...

114
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,995
I don't know.
I don't feel any different.

115
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:56,041
It's graduating high school,
not losing your virginity.

116
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,419
Amber, summer plans. Go.

117
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:01,797
Nothing but swimming pools
and sleeping late

118
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,508
for two whole months.

119
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,218
I mean...

120
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,053
on the weekends, maybe.

121
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,347
I'm at the community center

122
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,349
Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.

123
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,268
Oh, and did I tell you guys
I'm volunteering

124
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:15,978
for the Katie Giles campaign?

125
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,981
That's your idea
of a summer vacation?

126
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,567
Hey, Giles is the real deal.

127
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,902
Do you even know
your state comptroller?

128
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:27,573
I don't even know what a state
comptroller is, but you do you.

129
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,200
I'm gonna find
the trashiest reality show

130
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,537
I've never heard of
and binge every episode twice.

131
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,248
Eve, please tell Amber
how to properly vay-cay.

132
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,085
I'm, uh, gonna go help
finish the reconstruction,

133
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,962
up in Chicago.

134
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,507
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make that

135
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,050
weird for you or...

136
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:50,179
No, that's... that's amazing.

137
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,890
Do you ever miss punching
bad guys in the face?

138
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,474
Seems cathartic.

139
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,895
Right now, I'm just happy
helping people.

140
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,398
Speaking of...

141
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,738
God, I love having
superhero friends.

142
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,239
I mean Eve, specifically.

143
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,701
Mark won't even take me flying
anymore. Boo. Hiss.

144
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,121
To graduation
and new beginnings.

145
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,456
Mark?

146
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,583
I'm on call.
Cecil might need me.

147
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,960
You're always on call now.

148
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:24,504
- That's the job.
- It's all right.

149
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,507
Here.

150
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:29,801
What's this?

151
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,678
Virgin mai tai.

152
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,223
Very funny.

153
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,600
Cheers, guys.

154
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,435
To the best summer ever.

155
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,020
<i>♪ Just another day ♪</i>

156
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,521
{\an8}<i>♪ Lucky that you got that ♪♪</i>

157
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,208
{\an8}<i>I'm telling you,
this Martian problem</i>

158
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:44,900
{\an8}isn't gonna fix itself.

159
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,735
They were gonna execute us.

160
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:48,820
We-we barely got off
that rock alive.

161
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,114
Come on. They were trying
to save their planet.

162
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,741
From their own slaves.

163
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,744
If those sequids ever take over,
Earth is next.

164
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,537
We need to strike first.

165
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,581
Send up that
Invincible guy again.

166
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,876
You're talking about
starting an interplanetary war.

167
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,339
Hm...
Livingston?

168
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,801
Uh... What-what-what?
Well, what-what makes you

169
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,012
think I know anything
about Martians?

170
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,823
Is that how
you say it... Martians?

171
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,434
I, um, I have to visit...
the urination chamber.

172
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,857
Get a grip. Get a grip.

173
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,444
You are a smart Earth astronaut.

174
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,198
Say, uh, everything okay, Rus?

175
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,535
Fine. Everything...
everything's okay, yeah.

176
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,054
Sorry, how long have you
been standing there?

177
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,956
Not that it matters,
because I have nothing to hide.

178
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,457
Well, I, uh, l-listen, son,

179
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,335
I know things haven't
been easy since Mars.

180
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,754
After what you all
went through up there,

181
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:51,758
no one can blame you
for being a little, uh...

182
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:59,349
Uh... not yourself.

183
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:03,353
But it's been months,
and quite frankly, Livingston,

184
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,606
this is the
U.S. Space Administration,

185
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,108
not therapy.

186
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,361
Oh, God. No.

187
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,448
Well, I-I don't know
how else to say this...

188
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,033
{\an8}Please don't kill me!

189
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,159
What?

190
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,329
Spare me!
I won't fail you again.

191
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,289
I swear on my
three-chambered heart.

192
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,333
Just please do not stab
all three of them.

193
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,376
Uh, Christ on a Christmas tree.

194
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,046
No one's killing anybody.

195
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,507
But effective immediately,
you're taking a temporary leave

196
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,259
till you can get
your head on straight.

197
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:49,358
Holy shit.

198
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,820
Um...

199
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,961
Whew. There.

200
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,547
Saved you some work.

201
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:16,218
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

202
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,804
You scared the piss out
of my entire crew.

203
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,265
Uh, I'm just trying to help.

204
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,184
How do I know that's to code?

205
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,228
You know what?

206
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,313
Go stuff your code up your ass.

207
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:29,773
I live in that building.

208
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,775
And if it was up to
the bureaucrats,

209
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,653
we'd be sleeping in high school
gyms until Labor Day.

210
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,282
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

211
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,786
Mommy, does this mean
we can go home now?

212
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,539
It's about time someone
cut through all the red tape

213
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,917
and did something, instead
of just talking about it.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,645
You know how long
I've been begging the city

215
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,045
to clean up that mess?

216
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:54,714
Six years.

217
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,967
Oh, but unless
you know somebody?

218
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,468
Good luck.

219
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,638
You know me, don't you?

220
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,755
- Wow.
- That is so cool!

221
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:44,139
Hey, Mom.

222
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,392
No, no, everything's fine.
Great, actually.

223
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,187
I was just thinking
about you, and... Wait.

224
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,272
Is something wrong?

225
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,401
- Hey, Mom.
- Morning.

226
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,113
Since when do you drink coffee?

227
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:01,990
Since I got my powers.

228
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,786
Oh. I hadn't noticed.

229
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,622
Mm.

230
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,834
It keeps doing that.

231
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:16,838
I told Cecil those contractors
he hired were total amateurs.

232
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,798
Yeah, well, at least
he fixed our house.

233
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,383
His people shot it up.

234
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,720
Can we please
not do this right now?

235
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,639
Sorry.

236
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,683
I guess we're both
still a bit raw.

237
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,435
So...

238
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,604
how about we take
a little break?

239
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,065
I found some crazy deals online.

240
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,776
I'm-I'm thinking beach trip.

241
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:42,489
You and me. Somewhere tropical
with a-a fancy hotel.

242
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,657
Bermuda.

243
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,117
- Maybe Saint Lucia.
- Seriously?

244
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,119
Call it a graduation present.

245
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:52,791
I mean,
I want to, but...

246
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,074
Cecil told me the Guardians
are working out some issues,

247
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,046
and I don't know if I can
take off right now.

248
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,006
Well, what about
taking the time to enjoy

249
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,800
your last summer being a kid?

250
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,095
I'm not a kid anymore.

251
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,514
Yes, I know that.
You're an adult.

252
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,432
But that means
making your own choices.

253
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,827
- You don't have to do everything Cecil tells you.
- Yeah, Mom,

254
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,478
I kind of do.

255
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:17,107
The last time I did this on my
own, half a city got destroyed.

256
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,609
- I understand.
- No, you don't.

257
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,778
Let me finish.
I understand why you think

258
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,281
you have to prove yourself,
but you don't.

259
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,699
You're a good person.

260
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:27,552
No one thinks you're gonna
turn out like your father.

261
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,536
Well, then why
would you even say it?

262
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,871
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.

263
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,082
<i>Mark,
I need you.</i>

264
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,418
- Thank God.
- What?

265
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,461
- I have to go.
- Wait, Mark. Wait.

266
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,930
I quit.

267
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:52,392
I'm done.
Fuck your training, man.

268
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,939
People try and kill me

269
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,649
every single day.

270
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:02,527
Look, I don't need
that shit at home.

271
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:06,239
Somebody got me
in the balls.

272
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:07,532
Maybe if you trained more

273
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,409
and complained less,
we could get back

274
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,245
to saving lives.

275
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:14,706
We just stopped him
from being that guy,

276
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,875
and now we've got you?

277
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,920
Ugh, fuck my life.

278
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,180
Kate? Is that you?

279
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,765
I've got a boo-boo

280
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:34,184
that could use
some dupli-kisses.

281
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,937
First of all,

282
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,731
We are not dating.

283
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,651
And second, that's inappropriate
language for the workplace.

284
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,195
So kiss your own boo-boo...

285
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,740
boo... boo...

286
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,867
Wait, I know that look.

287
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,328
Oh,

288
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,038
are you shitting me?

289
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,249
You goddamn geriatric hypocrite.

290
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:01,127
This is none of your business.

291
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,421
- Aw, come on!
- You and I were never a thing.

292
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,549
The Immortal and I are.
Deal with it.

293
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,842
Kate.

294
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:11,721
Don't do this. Please.

295
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,225
<i>We called them heroes,</i>

296
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,019
<i>role models, protectors.</i>

297
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,355
<i>But no one ever expected to call</i>

298
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,233
<i>the Guardians
of the Globe victims.</i>

299
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,944
<i>Welcome to our first annual
commemoration</i>

300
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,113
<i>of the massacre
that shook the world.</i>

301
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,449
<i>We begin by honoring Aquarus, King of Atlantis.</i>

302
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:33,284
<i>Aquarus first won hearts</i>

303
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:35,453
<i>and minds when he
singlehandedly rescued...</i>

304
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,122
Hi, Rus.

305
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,498
Yes, Rus.

306
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,709
I know you lost your job,

307
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,212
but the rent's been due
for months. So, you know...

308
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,817
- I do?
<i>- ...served as a symbol for those of us</i>

309
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,384
<i>who feel different...</i>

310
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,736
Just find a way
to pay your bills,

311
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,221
or I need you out
by the end of next week.

312
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,473
<i>Next,
we honor the Guardians'</i>

313
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:57,684
<i>fallen green do-gooder:</i>

314
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,310
<i>Martian Man.</i>

315
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,396
{\an8}<i>He may have come
from the stars,</i>

316
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,189
{\an8}<i>but Martian Man will always be</i>

317
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,151
{\an8}<i>one of Earth's
greatest superheroes.</i>

318
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,444
{\an8}<i>While taking on bigger threats</i>

319
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,195
{\an8}<i>was part of his job
as a Guardian,</i>

320
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,989
{\an8}<i>Martian Man always</i>

321
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,576
{\an8}<i>made time to help
first responders on the scene.</i>

322
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,327
{\an8}<i>With his gentle nature</i>

323
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:19,289
{\an8}<i>and kind spirit,
Martian Man made Earth</i>

324
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,874
{\an8}<i>his home.</i>

325
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,442
<i>Here's the need-to-know.</i>

326
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,217
<i>We've had multiple</i>

327
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,261
<i>corroborated sightings
of Darkwing,</i>

328
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:36,181
which is perturbing to me,
considering that I personally

329
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:39,142
ID'd what was left
of his rib cage last year.

330
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:42,729
Oh, uh, sorry.

331
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,398
It's okay.

332
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,567
So, observe and report?

333
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,903
<i>That's why you're
employee of the month, kid.</i>

334
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:53,907
<i>Midnight City.</i>

335
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,450
<i>Been a virtual no-man's-land</i>

336
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,453
<i>since the Midnight Magician
cursed it back in '02.</i>

337
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,079
So when you say "cursed,"

338
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:02,373
is that, like, a metaphor or...

339
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,377
What the hell?

340
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:07,879
<i>I mean it's cursed.</i>

341
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,673
<i>Permanent midnight,
perpetual darkness.</i>

342
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,759
<i>Summer on the dark side
of the moon.</i>

343
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,810
So weird.

344
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,688
Hm...

345
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,066
<i>Let me know when
you're done playing tourist.</i>

346
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,950
Oh, oh, God. Help. Help!

347
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,285
Please, somebody help me!

348
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:42,831
Ple...

349
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,667
Aah!

350
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,961
Please...

351
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,338
s-somebody help me.

352
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,468
I am helping.

353
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,557
Helping make sure scum like you

354
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,351
never hurt another
innocent person again.

355
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,821
Come on, man.

356
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,656
Darkwing was at
my 12th birthday party,

357
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,242
so I'm pretty sure
he doesn't kill people.

358
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:21,286
Also, pretty sure he's dead.

359
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,621
Killed by your father,
Invincible.

360
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,415
Which is why
I carry on his work.

361
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,584
I was Night Boy, his assistant.

362
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:30,461
Assistant?
Wait, you mean sidekick?

363
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,881
We don't use that term.

364
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,384
It's degrading.

365
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,220
<i>Okay, bring him in.
He's lost it.</i>

366
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,305
You think?

367
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,098
- You hear them, too?
- Huh?

368
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,267
The voices.

369
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,563
Oh, man... Hey, you're coming
with me. Okay?

370
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:52,066
I'm not going anywhere
with the son of a psychopath.

371
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,737
Hey, I'm being nice,
so watch it.

372
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,824
Huh?

373
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:07,206
Ow.

374
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,917
I felt that.

375
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,501
My predecessor developed

376
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:12,629
this exoskeleton
to help even the field

377
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,130
against those like you.

378
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:17,508
But that's not what you
should be worried about.

379
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,428
Hey, man, I said I felt that
punch. I didn't say it hurt.

380
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,105
Aah!

381
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:34,192
Welcome to the Shadowverse.

382
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,527
There are dark things here.

383
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,696
Hungry things.

384
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,282
Even I don't dare
to stay too long.

385
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,285
But I hope you like it,

386
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:48,706
because you are never leaving.

387
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,250
I liked the old Darkwing better.

388
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,377
I'm the hero here!

389
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,087
I'm saving the world

390
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,297
from Omni-Man's son.

391
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,718
Hey, don't call me that.

392
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,930
Let go.

393
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,099
Not until you take me back.

394
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:12,063
Hmm. Guess who
they'll eat first.

395
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,112
You would never.

396
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,323
Like you said,
I'm Omni-Man's son.

397
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:26,160
You have no idea

398
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,454
what I'm capable of.

399
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,294
There. Now let go of...

400
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,678
<i>Mark?</i>

401
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,930
<i>We lost you for a minute.
Where were you?</i>

402
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:47,890
You'll have to ask
Darkwing's sidekick.

403
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:51,477
When he regains consciousness.

404
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,396
<i>Okay.
Bring him in.</i>

405
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:55,940
<i>I got to sign off.
Something just came up.</i>

406
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,608
Anything I can do?

407
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,068
I doubt it.

408
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,572
Debbie,
what a pleasant surprise.

409
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,323
What can I do for you?

410
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:05,742
Mark almost missed

411
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,952
his high school graduation
because of you.

412
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:09,746
He only gets one of those.

413
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,748
He's barely 18, Cecil.

414
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,083
Mark came to me.

415
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,836
I'm looking out for him. I'm
easing him back into the job.

416
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,506
It's not a job. And he's not
your... your-your soldier.

417
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,216
You can't just order him around.

418
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,427
Well, at least
he follows orders.

419
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,139
Debbie, I didn't mean that.

420
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,932
That's what this is about,
isn't it?

421
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,893
That you're in control, not him.

422
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:33,561
That he's not like his father.

423
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:36,314
- Debbie...
- I can't believe you'd even think that

424
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,149
after everything
Mark went through.

425
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:40,860
And what if you decide
you can't trust him? What then?

426
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,278
That won't happen.

427
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,489
I wish I believed you.

428
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,699
Debbie...

429
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,160
I meant what I said,
about looking out for Mark.

430
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:51,871
No dangerous stuff
until he's ready.

431
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,916
And he calls the shots.
You have my word.

432
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,335
Sir, the Mars file
you requested.

433
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:01,798
D... Donald?

434
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,884
Debbie. Are you okay?

435
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,552
She was just leaving.

436
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,932
That was Donald.

437
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:18,064
Huh.
Wonder what that was about.

438
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:20,483
<i>I told you, sweetie.
Everything's fine.</i>

439
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,027
You don't sound fine, Mom.

440
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,403
Are you and dad fighting again?

441
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:27,281
- No, nothing like that.
- Well, then what?

442
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:30,535
Mom, it's me.

443
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:34,163
I'll put on some tea
and we can just talk, okay?

444
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,582
Things have been a little tight
lately, financially,

445
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:39,210
but we're fine. Really, sweetie.

446
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,562
Mom, why didn't you
say something?

447
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,712
You know I can help out.

448
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,049
Samantha.

449
00:23:47,135 --> 00:23:49,428
- There.
- Turn it back, please,

450
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,055
before your father gets home.

451
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,850
Why? What's going on?

452
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,310
Samantha?

453
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,020
Dad?

454
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,106
What are you doing
in a Burger Mart shirt?

455
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,859
It's called
an honest day's work.

456
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,486
But the furniture store...
you've been there for 20 years.

457
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,197
Until you people turned
the Chicago corporate office

458
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,699
into a pile of rubble.

459
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,492
Ugh, God.
Why didn't you tell me?

460
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,911
Maybe you should have asked,
instead of flying off

461
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:16,289
to God knows where
doing God knows what.

462
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,749
All right, well,
I'm here now.

463
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,669
Okay? You don't have to work
some minimum wage job

464
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:24,839
like a teenager. I can give
you and mom whatever you want.

465
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,759
I've provided for this family
longer than you've been alive.

466
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,264
There. 24 karat.

467
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,825
- You can sell this and...
- Turn it back.

468
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:37,977
Ugh. You're being stubborn
for no reason.

469
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,022
I said change it back.

470
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,027
I have to run.

471
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,654
The <i>Times</i> wants to interview me
about my work in Chicago.

472
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,948
I will visit in a few days
to check in.

473
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,452
And make dad sell this. Bye.

474
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,831
<i>Hi there. I'm calling</i>

475
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:00,333
on behalf
of the Katy Giles campaign

476
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,584
to ask for your vote

477
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,711
in next month's
state comptroller election.

478
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:06,422
No, comptroller.

479
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,176
You know, overseeing budgets,
auditing state finances.

480
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,428
It's critical work and...

481
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,013
Hello? Hello?

482
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,098
I think you need a new slogan

483
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,517
that doesn't have the word
"audit" in it, or

484
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:20,436
"comptroller."

485
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,148
Local politics might not be as
sexy as flying around in tights,

486
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:27,235
but that doesn't mean you're
the only one saving the world.

487
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:29,904
See? That's a better slogan.

488
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:34,075
Shouldn't you be off
punching things into space?

489
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:36,577
Surprise.

490
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:39,622
I'm taking you to lunch.

491
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,625
Ooh. Unexpected,
but appreciated.

492
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,335
Let me go grab my bag.

493
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:46,837
There's this great Thai place
down the street.

494
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:51,217
Uh, I had
somewhere else in mind.

495
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,850
I said I'd be back at 1:30.

496
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,520
We're almost there.

497
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,398
<i>♪ Lighter than air weighs,
cleaner than romance ♪</i>

498
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,732
<i>♪ And easier...</i>

499
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:10,236
Okay. You can look now.

500
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,281
Oh... my God.

501
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:16,284
You brought me to Paris?

502
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:18,703
Sort of.

503
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,454
Is that a casino?

504
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:22,456
<i>♪ All you need to know

505
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,669
Okay, yeah,
so it's just Las Vegas,

506
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,296
okay?

507
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,524
You only get an hour for lunch,
and I can't fly you to Europe

508
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:33,009
that fast without
your skin ripping off, so...

509
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,096
Can I kiss you anyway?

510
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,310
You get an A for effort.

511
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:45,646
And for letting me
keep my skin on.

512
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,024
Well, I didn't want to get you
all the baggage

513
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:51,152
of dating a superhero
without any of the perks.

514
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,405
<i>Mark,
I need you.</i>

515
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,282
Give me a sec.

516
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,453
Dinner tonight instead?

517
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,082
Go save the world, Invincible.

518
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,418
Just make sure
the voice in your ear

519
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:09,503
isn't the only one
you listen to.

520
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,424
You're way too good for me.

521
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,804
Mm.
Also, I need to take you

522
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:22,224
back to work first.

523
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,993
- You're late.
- For what... low tide?

524
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,287
Something like that.

525
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:45,539
Turns out the Atlanteans
are sore about Omni-Man

526
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,875
murdering their king, Aquarus.

527
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,669
And since your dad vanished
like a fart in a hurricane,

528
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:52,880
Atlantean law dictates
that his sentence falls

529
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,175
to his next of kin. You.

530
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,635
That's a stupid law.

531
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,679
Maybe. But Atlantis
controls the oceans.

532
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,449
They've threatened to erase
the Eastern seaboard

533
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:03,974
if we don't deal with this.

534
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:06,018
You want me to go to war
against an entire

535
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:07,770
underwater civilization?

536
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,814
Who said anything about war?

537
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:12,400
According to Atlantean custom,
the only way to atone

538
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:15,194
for the king's murder
is to marry his widow.

539
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,445
What?

540
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,614
It's an honor,
if you think about it.

541
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,450
I can't marry a fish.
I have a girlfriend.

542
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,786
Relax. It's strictly symbolic.

543
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,138
All you have to do
is go through the ceremony.

544
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:27,581
Maybe kiss the bride.

545
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:29,476
Then all is forgiven and
everyone moves on. It's easy.

546
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,795
Okay, but, like,
will I have to, you know...

547
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:35,881
All right, what exactly
am I looking at?

548
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,259
Your ride.

549
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:44,056
Sorry, kid,
I got another fire to put out.

550
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,934
Good luck down there.
I'll be listening.

551
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,438
Talk to me.

552
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:51,939
It's the Lizard League, sir.

553
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,125
You called me back
for the Lizard League?

554
00:28:56,152 --> 00:28:58,487
They've hit a bio-research lab
outside of Dallas.

555
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:01,282
How? We got King Lizard
rotting in a prison cell.

556
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,533
Uh, it appears

557
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:03,816
<i>that Supreme Lizard has seized</i>

558
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:05,220
<i>control in his absence.</i>

559
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:08,372
Send in the Guardians.

560
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:09,915
A-Are you sure they're ready?

561
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,792
If they can't take down
the Lizard League,

562
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,252
they'll never be ready.

563
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:20,551
Nope.

564
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,262
Not this bullshit again.

565
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:26,599
I'm not doing another me.

566
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,185
That me better not be you, Rudy.

567
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,269
It's not.

568
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,941
Who are you?

569
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:39,778
I call me... the Shapesmith.

570
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:45,826
Guardians.

571
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,371
Things usually this weird
around here?

572
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,415
You have no idea.

573
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:02,134
Whoa.

574
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:04,136
Wear this.

575
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:35,834
Welcome, son of he
who slayed my husband.

576
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:36,961
About that...

577
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:39,630
You will address her
as Your Majesty,

578
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:40,923
air-breather.

579
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,716
Right. Your Majesty,

580
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,052
it's an honor to meet you.

581
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,471
And I'm very sorry

582
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:49,682
for what my father did,

583
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:51,267
but I can't do this.

584
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,727
And definitely not here
in front of everyone.

585
00:30:53,811 --> 00:30:55,938
Okay. Uh, Th-This is
kind of awkward, but

586
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:57,731
I have a girlfriend...
name is Amber...

587
00:30:57,815 --> 00:30:59,858
and we're finally
in a good place,

588
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:02,319
so, even though, you know,

589
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,988
you seem super nice,

590
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,991
it-it just wouldn't
feel right to...

591
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:09,034
What do you speak of?

592
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,787
Isn't that why I'm here?
To be your new king?

593
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,372
Why would I need a king?

594
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:16,542
I commanded this kingdom
for a decade

595
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,336
while Aquarus played dress-up
with you humans.

596
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,631
Oh, then we're not
getting married?

597
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:26,218
We abolished
that barbaric custom.

598
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,887
What do you think we are,
savages?

599
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,849
Oh, my... Oh, thank God.

600
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:35,311
{\an8}I mean, uh,
thank you, Your-Your Majesty.

601
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,771
G-Great.

602
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,481
So, what's the new law?

603
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,737
Trial by combat.

604
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,282
Release the Depth-Dweller!

605
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:55,998
Aw, man.

606
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,469
Wait, you want me to fight that?

607
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,847
Seems a little unfair.

608
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,771
Okay. I win. Can I go now?

609
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:21,732
Whoa.

610
00:32:26,362 --> 00:32:29,031
Uh...

611
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:32,284
Oh, that makes a lot more sense.

612
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,754
Seriously?

613
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:52,596
{\an8}Uh, if you're not
feeling ready...

614
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,848
{\an8}- Paul.
- Yeah?

615
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:58,727
- Let's sell this bitch.
- Okay.

616
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,646
Oh, wow.

617
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:03,190
{\an8}This place is adorable.

618
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,444
Hi.

619
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:11,365
So pleased to meet you.
Come on in.

620
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:13,867
<i>And last</i>

621
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,370
but not least, the living room.

622
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:17,955
I love it.

623
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,581
It looks recently renovated.

624
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,835
It looks like they didn't
even know what they were doing.

625
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,504
I-It was professionally redone
only two years ago.

626
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:26,922
When are you taking offers?

627
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,590
- Wednesday.
- Whoa!

628
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,093
- Slow down.
- I was just asking.

629
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,761
Yeah? Well, don't bother.

630
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:35,055
We're definitely
not offering on this place.

631
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:37,766
It's in our price range. We like
the location. The schools...

632
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,101
It's too far from the office.

633
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,370
You want me to
get home even later?

634
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:42,229
There's excellent local transit.

635
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:43,912
Of course I don't.
I just think...

636
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,232
It's not happening.

637
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,359
When you earn the money,

638
00:33:47,443 --> 00:33:49,945
you can decide where we live.

639
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,530
She's not your pet.

640
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,574
What was that?

641
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,200
Did we mention
the spacious garage?

642
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:57,262
Why don't you all go ahead?
I'll meet you there in a jiffy.

643
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,928
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

644
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,460
I'll call you later.

645
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,944
<i>What
the hell's going on down there?</i>

646
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:35,282
Your file on Atlantean law
needs some serious updating.

647
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:36,825
<i>- This wasn't the deal.</i>
- Huh.

648
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,619
<i>I'm pulling you out.
Backup's on the way.</i>

649
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,710
Huh.

650
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,842
Oh, shit!

651
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,856
<i>Talk to me, kid.</i>

652
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:13,529
That... sound.

653
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:27,042
How far away is that backup?

654
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,126
<i>Incoming.</i>

655
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,511
<i>Now's your chance.
Get out of there.</i>

656
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,943
Huh?

657
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,159
Cecil, that thing got loose.
It's killing everyone.

658
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:02,762
<i>Well they should have
thought about that before they</i>

659
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,121
<i>brought it home from the store.</i>

660
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:06,081
I can't leave
those people to die.

661
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,084
<i>They tried to kill you.
They were cheering.</i>

662
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,045
All they wanted was justice
for what my dad did.

663
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:16,800
<i>You're not your father, Mark.</i>

664
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,264
That's why I'm going back.

665
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:53,670
Okay, now we can do this.

666
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,546
Um...

667
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:56,233
Aah!

668
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,194
Ugh... Ah...

669
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,489
<i>You got lucky this time.</i>

670
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,824
Lucky?

671
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:05,158
<i>Atlantis is calling it even</i>

672
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,369
<i>since you saved
the Queen's life.</i>

673
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,163
<i>The next time
I give you an order,</i>

674
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:12,332
you listen.

675
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:15,127
Pull up the audio
from that fight.

676
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,235
Get it to the boys in R & D.
I want a report in a week.

677
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,385
Yes, sir.

678
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:30,267
Sir, when Debbie came to speak
with you, she seemed, uh...

679
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:33,520
distressed when she...
when she saw me.

680
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,883
Well, she's a distressed person.

681
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,398
After the number
Nolan did on her,

682
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,734
who knows what's going
through her head.

683
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,277
Anything else, Donald?

684
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,239
No, sir.

685
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,539
Ugh.

686
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,126
Why would you do that?

687
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:58,086
We don't want your fake food

688
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:00,505
or your fake gold.

689
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,591
They're not fake.

690
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:05,469
But... I get it.

691
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,264
You had your job for years
and losing it must feel awful.

692
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,350
I know how hard you worked
to provide for mom and me.

693
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,436
No one is trying
to take that away from you.

694
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,605
But you got to
get over this stupid

695
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,249
"man of the house" thing.
I'm trying to help.

696
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,983
Oh, yeah?

697
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,235
Like you helped Chicago?

698
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,071
- Adam, don't.
- What?

699
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,781
The whole lot

700
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:28,075
was unstable, that's why

701
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:29,785
the city never built there.

702
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:33,163
It's a miracle
nobody was killed.

703
00:39:33,246 --> 00:39:35,415
This is what happens
when you think rules

704
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:37,876
are just for us
pathetic normal people.

705
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,378
Your powers
don't make you a hero.

706
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:43,256
They make you dangerous.

707
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,550
I have to go.

708
00:39:45,634 --> 00:39:49,596
Don't come back until
you've figured that out.

709
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:20,836
Fuck you, motherfucker!

710
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:25,692
And over here
is our training room.

711
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,820
Wow. Look at all those...

712
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,697
those things.

713
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,408
Ooh why don't you show him
the shower, Immortal?

714
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,076
It's super roomy.

715
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,996
You could do anything
in there, right?

716
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,332
And you all get to live here?

717
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:43,251
Play your cards right
and maybe you can, too, someday.

718
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,587
The Guardians could use
someone with your talents.

719
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,088
Really?

720
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:49,841
Forgive me for questioning
your authority, Immortal,

721
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,302
but we don't know anything
about the Shapesmith.

722
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:53,637
I can tell you.

723
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,097
I can tell you. I can tell you.

724
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:58,183
I was born a baby human,

725
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:01,436
right here
on the planet of Earth.

726
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:15,867
I got my superpowers
in a random industrial accident.

727
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:28,964
I swore to use my abilities
for good and to help people

728
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:32,509
and to protect my planet,
no matter what.

729
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,225
Because I am a normal

730
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,394
human superhero.

731
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:46,773
Am I in?

732
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:54,322
<i>Yes,
we were defeated. Yes,</i>

733
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,866
it was embarrassing.

734
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,954
Yes, it was my plan.

735
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,623
But we are not a joke,

736
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:08,003
no matter what
social media says.

737
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:10,422
We are the Lizard League,

738
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:14,259
and we are unstoppable.

739
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:18,430
We're unstoppable.
We're unstoppable.

740
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,433
And under my leadership,

741
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:24,394
instead of that fool,
King Lizard,

742
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:27,397
we will rise again,

743
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,941
any day now!

744
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,986
All hail Supreme Lizard.

745
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:34,571
All hail S...

746
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,248
If anyone is going to

747
00:43:45,332 --> 00:43:47,876
turn this organization around,

748
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,795
it's going to be King Lizard.

749
00:43:50,879 --> 00:43:52,672
Any objections?

750
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:11,107
Why should I tell you anything?

751
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,901
Who the hell are you, anyway?

752
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:16,237
Think of me as an old friend.

753
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,073
An old friend who can help you,

754
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,867
given your current predicament.

755
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,453
Fine.

756
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,998
They were smart.

757
00:44:27,082 --> 00:44:29,250
After our ultimatum,
they ambushed my dad

758
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:31,753
with experimental quantum bombs.

759
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,172
Still cost them most of Europe.

760
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:38,343
Then they just...

761
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,887
wore me down.

762
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:43,973
Caught me when I finally
had to sleep.

763
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,602
Hmm. Interesting.

764
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,398
- Freeze!
- Who the hell are you?

765
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:55,860
- That's what I said.
- Me? I'm not your problem.

766
00:44:55,944 --> 00:44:59,322
Then whose problem are you?

767
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:02,659
His. Well, not his, but...

768
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,246
...close enough.

769
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,915
Make him pay for what he did
to your world.

770
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:10,583
What?

771
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,670
Stop. Hey, you promised
you'd help me. Hey.

772
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:16,589
Don't leave me here! Hey!
