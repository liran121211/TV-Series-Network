- [glass clinking]

What's wrong is D.A. Sinclair
took me apart

530

put me back together again,

531

No.

539

But others like him did.

540
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:49,655

just like they rebuilt you.

they brought me back,

less of me to save each time.

the official number,

I'm about 98% machine.

How... how can you
live with that?

551

Each time I died, each time
I was put back together,

it was because I helped
make this world a little better.

fought back against Sinclair,

No, it's fine.

I talked to the Guardians, and
they said they'd cover for me.

a week off going forward.
