1
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:09,343
If anyone
is going to turn

2
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:11,804
this organization around,

3
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,056
it's going to be King Lizard.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,101
<i>If those sequids
ever take over, Earth is next.</i>

5
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,894
Forgive me, Allen.

6
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,813
Hello, son.
It's been a while.

7
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,314
This is your little brother.

8
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:25,401
I never even fucking knew you.

9
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:26,777
You don't need the bum.

10
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,823
I need help here!

11
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,951
<i>Viltrum knows
I've left my post.</i>

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,345
<i>- They'll track me.
- Are those...</i>

13
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,430
Viltrumite soldiers.

14
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:39,582
Why do I care about them?

15
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:41,792
<i>You need to fight
like a Viltrumite.</i>

16
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:42,960
I don't kill people.

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,088
Your father will be executed.

18
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,048
You will assume his mission

19
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:50,551
and prepare the planet
for our rule.

20
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,261
It's the emperor's other son.

21
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:35,471
Is he dead?

22
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,890
His chest is moving.

23
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,976
What is all that red liquid?

24
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,770
It must be his blood.

25
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:44,897
He has a hole in his body.

26
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,775
The city.

27
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,653
Andressa.

28
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,696
We can take you there.

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,395
Mark.

30
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,355
Nolan.

31
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,940
Where's Nolan?

32
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:32,152
The Viltrumites took him.

33
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,907
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,912
The city, these people,
it's all our fault.

35
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,832
Mark, you saved my life.

36
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,585
And your brother's.

37
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,091
If my dad and I
hadn't been here...

38
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,678
...none of this
would've happened.

39
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,223
If your father hadn't been here,
I wouldn't have a son.

40
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:05,936
And if you hadn't been here,
we both would've died.

41
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,399
Thraxan lives are short
compared to yours.

42
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,193
Our culture
doesn't assign blame.

43
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,071
We only look forward.

44
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,744
We will rebuild, Mark.

45
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,662
Count on that.

46
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,681
Mark Grayson!

47
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,477
Oh, hey. Nuolzot.

48
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,272
I have good news.

49
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,067
We've completed a ship
to take you home.

50
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,277
You can return to your planet

51
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,363
and your center
for learning and drink.

52
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:01,492
Um, thanks, but I can't go yet.

53
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,369
There's still so much to do.

54
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:06,288
Oh, the city will be
whole again soon.

55
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,749
Your people must need
your strength.

56
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,126
Eh, there's tons of heroes
on Earth.

57
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,420
I'm sure they got it covered.

58
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:19,760
Behold, the might of Omnipotus!

59
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,596
Tremble before

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,059
my unlimited power!

61
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,523
No.

62
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,484
I'm sure you know
your planet best.

63
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,157
- Empress.
- Nuolzot.

64
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,034
Did you give Mark the news?

65
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:46,036
I thought he'd be more pleased.

66
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,080
Humans are very confusing.

67
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,707
I am pleased.

68
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,961
Yeah, I-I want to see my mom
and my girlfriend.

69
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,588
But there's more to do here,
and I...

70
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,007
You've helped enough.

71
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,884
It's time you return home.

72
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,971
But there is something else
I must ask of you.

73
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,223
Take your brother with you.

74
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,475
Home to Earth.

75
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,185
What?

76
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,645
What are you talking about?

77
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,272
You're his mom.

78
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,025
Mark, look at me.

79
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:19,987
Look how much older I am
than when you first arrived.

80
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,661
You brother ages
quicker than you

81
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,456
but far slower than my people.

82
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,709
I'll be gone before
he can form a sentence.

83
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:36,003
When Nolan was here,
that was fine.

84
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,839
He could be raised
by his father.

85
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,133
But now...

86
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:43,594
everyone he knows here
will soon be dead.

87
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:48,307
Generations will pass
before he's even an adult.

88
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,061
What mother would abandon him
to a life like that?

89
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:55,731
My dad was worried
about that for me, too.

90
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,026
Nolan changed me.

91
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:03,113
I see life now on a longer scale
than most Thraxans.

92
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,573
But to me,

93
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,367
your centuries are still
just a concept.

94
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,997
To you and your brother,
it's the life you must live.

95
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,834
I just keep hoping
my dad's okay.

96
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,962
I hope that, too.

97
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,923
But if he lives,

98
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:23,217
he'll go searching
for you, not me.

99
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,676
Wait, no, that's not...

100
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,137
My time with Nolan
was special.

101
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,140
But he will know

102
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:32,726
my life has run its course.

103
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,855
Remember me, child.

104
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:39,066
Someday,
I hope you'll understand

105
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,026
why I had to let you go.

106
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,905
Please?

107
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,199
Very soon, you'll be all he has.

108
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,409
And he will need someone.

109
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,717
Thanks, Paul. See you tomorrow.

110
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:08,345
Debbie?

111
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,264
Wait, uh...

112
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,224
Forgot to give you this.

113
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,518
It's from all of us
at the office.

114
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,436
For the house we sold?

115
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,522
Kind of. Uh...

116
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,773
Well...

117
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,151
We all know...

118
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,612
...how hard it's been for you.

119
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:30,284
But it's good to have you back.

120
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,955
Thanks. Thank you, Paul.

121
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,051
Hmm.

122
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,646
Hey, Mom.

123
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,357
Mark! Oh!

124
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,904
Jesus, Mark.
It's been two months.

125
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,406
I try not to worry,
but even Cecil's been frantic.

126
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,699
He's...

127
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:11,867
Oh.

128
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,829
Who is that?

129
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:26,256
I-I-I don't even have the words.

130
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,010
This morning, I didn't even know
if Nolan was alive.

131
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,180
I-I didn't even know
if I wanted him to be alive.

132
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,016
Now he's left another planet
in ruins and his...

133
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,603
his new kid
is sitting in my kitchen.

134
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,438
The Viltrumites took him, Mom.

135
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,232
Dad didn't have a choice.

136
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,483
Oh, like hell he didn't.

137
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,485
He didn't have to go
to that planet.

138
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,737
He certainly didn't
have to find a new partner

139
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,489
and have a new baby.

140
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,662
He's never on the hook
for the lives he destroys.

141
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,580
Just leaves it for
everyone else to clean up.

142
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:01,291
Again and again.

143
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,585
I know, I know.

144
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:07,881
What are we supposed to do
with him?

145
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,842
Children that age
need constant care.

146
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:12,636
He doesn't even had a name.

147
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,138
Well, he ages fast.

148
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:18,058
He won't stay a toddler
for long.

149
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,894
Maybe I can take a year off
from college to look after him.

150
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,896
What? No. Absolutely not.

151
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,940
I've been gone for two months.

152
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,234
It's not like my grades
are gonna be amazing anyway.

153
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,280
And I changed a lot of diapers
on the way home.

154
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,075
What about Cecil?

155
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:36,493
We can't.

156
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,120
There's got to be other options.

157
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,248
Like what? He's purple.

158
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,339
I can't give him to a stranger,

159
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,509
and I don't want to leave
college, but...

160
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,470
Y-You're right about Dad
leaving his problems

161
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,556
for other people to fix.

162
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,393
But he's my brother.

163
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,896
And I-I can't just abandon him.

164
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,277
Well, you must get it
from my side of the family.

165
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:20,787
Don't quit
school, Mark.

166
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,664
I'll take some time off of work

167
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,875
and look after him
for a few days.

168
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,752
I'll figure something out.

169
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,759
Mm, but you're changing
that diaper

170
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,677
before you go anywhere.

171
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,949
All right, have someone
look into the sighting.

172
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,142
It's probably a hoax,
but we can't risk it.

173
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,561
I want a report in an hour.

174
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,318
Sir, may I have a minute?

175
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,905
We're a little busy, Donald,
if you hadn't noticed.

176
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,865
I need you to make time for...

177
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,160
...this.

178
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,209
Everybody out!

179
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,465
You heard me!

180
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:14,966
I need the room.

181
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,426
Now.

182
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,484
Okay.

183
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:35,070
You've got my attention.

184
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,781
After Omni-Man
went bad last year,

185
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:41,410
we blew up our surveillance
house to stop him.

186
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,829
You triggered it after
getting everyone to safety.

187
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,540
You barely made it out
alive yourself.

188
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,835
So why don't I remember it?

189
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,379
You were in shock.
You got burned pretty bad.

190
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,881
Burned?

191
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,925
Is that what you call...

192
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,927
this?

193
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,764
With respect, sir,

194
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,100
what did you do to me?

195
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,312
Oh.

196
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,862
I thought I was on
the White Room list.

197
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,865
You are, for most of it.

198
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,366
Lights.

199
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,204
What is that?

200
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,417
It's what we did to you.

201
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,962
State of the art.
It's expensive as hell.

202
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,882
Damn sight better than
your old one, if you ask me.

203
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,217
How?

204
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,760
You were lucky.

205
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:43,555
Omni-Man's body shielded you
from most of the blast.

206
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,974
When we pulled you out,
your brain was intact.

207
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,018
The rest of you, not so much.

208
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,896
The r-rest of me?

209
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,815
Cecil,
what the hell am I now?

210
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,192
You're you.

211
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,278
But better, stronger.

212
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,988
Alive.

213
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,490
Uh...

214
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,910
I-I don't remember...
I don't remember any of it.

215
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:08,788
All these people knew
and I didn't?

216
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,040
PTSD's a bitch.

217
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,726
We figured you'd be
better off without it.

218
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,793
You mean you'd be better off.

219
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,545
You had no right.

220
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,548
What do you want, Donald?
Would you rather be dead?

221
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,593
You know the world we live in,
what the job is.

222
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,345
There's no time
for existential angst.

223
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,473
Angst? That's what you call it?

224
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,141
Jesus, Cecil.

225
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:30,036
I knew you were cold,
but I never knew you were...

226
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,520
Uh, sirs?

227
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,480
- What?
- What?

228
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,696
And that's more than enough
philosophy for today.

229
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,076
Hmm... Hmm?

230
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:49,829
Hmm?

231
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,040
Since when did you start
locking the window?

232
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,960
Mark. Holy shit.

233
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,711
Um, I started locking it

234
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,506
after that giant bug
dressed like a dog showed up.

235
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,383
Did you save them
from those meteors?

236
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,635
Meteors? Oh, right.

237
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:05,303
Um...

238
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,222
Yes and no?

239
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:09,307
Um, it got...

240
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,978
It got weird... for me.

241
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,312
Yeah, I kind of figured.

242
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,730
You were gone a long time.

243
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,524
Like forever in college years.

244
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,736
You need to go see the dean,
by the way.

245
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,364
Something about
academic probation?

246
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,283
You said you'd cover for me.

247
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,118
I did, for a while.

248
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,369
Two months, Mark.

249
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:31,830
That's more excuses
than anyone can make up.

250
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:32,914
What happened?

251
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:36,334
Uh, a lot.

252
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,212
I saw my dad.

253
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,338
Your dad?

254
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,965
Look, I'll-I'll tell you
all about it,

255
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,343
but I need to see Amber first.

256
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,847
Oh, sure, ditch me for
your girlfriend, why don't you?

257
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,684
It'll give you time
to put all my posters back up.

258
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,185
All of them.

259
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,692
And when exactly

260
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,361
were you planning to tell me
you were back?

261
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,573
I mean, it's not like
you didn't know.

262
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:09,117
I ordered you not to go.
You were gone two months.

263
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,535
Now you don't even check in?

264
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,954
I needed to see my mom
and my girlfriend first.

265
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:14,998
We had a deal, Mark.

266
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,641
You promised,
if I put you in the field,

267
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,001
you'd follow orders.

268
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,854
You don't get to pick
and choose when that applies.

269
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:21,838
I saved millions of lives
out there, Cecil.

270
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,132
And it looks like
everything here was just fine.

271
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,761
Yeah. Things were just peachy.

272
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,034
The Guardians almost died
saving the planet

273
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,745
while you were off
gallivanting with space bugs.

274
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,666
What I did out there,
wh-what I found was important.

275
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:03,213
You already know, don't you?

276
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,302
We keep an eye on Debbie
for her protection.

277
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,054
Passive monitoring, mostly.

278
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,181
Certain keywords
trigger a closer listen.

279
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,100
Unbelievable.

280
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,852
You're angry about me
not reporting in?

281
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,270
I don't need to.

282
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,106
You got cameras
in my mom's house.

283
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,359
It's not cameras.
We would never do that.

284
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,112
All right, since you
already know everything,

285
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,364
I'll go see my girlfriend
like I planned.

286
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,532
Fine by me.

287
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,367
I'll send a team
to pick up Nolan's kid.

288
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,077
You can't.

289
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,538
What are you gonna do?
Leave him with your mom?

290
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,790
He's an alien.

291
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,917
We're more qualified
to take care of him.

292
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,837
He's my brother,
not a science experiment.

293
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,255
Call your people off.

294
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:47,298
They're already on their way.

295
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,552
Call them off.

296
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,303
Now.

297
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,141
I'll check in tomorrow.

298
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,898
Fine.
I'm sure your mom will love

299
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,526
looking after
her ex-husband's new kid.

300
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,325
Coming.

301
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:17,787
Mark.

302
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,123
Oh, my God, you're back.

303
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,502
I missed you so much.

304
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,088
I didn't mean
to be gone so long.

305
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,340
They took me
to this insane planet...

306
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,928
...tarium in, uh, Philadelphia

307
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,848

He's been gone a while
dealing with family stuff.

311
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,857
Mark, this is Bridget,
Jannie and Corey.

312
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,193

Nice to finally meet you.

313
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:50,987
Wow, so he is real.

314
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,282
I thought Amber was just trying
to brush off creepy dudes.

315
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,492
Yep.

316
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,410
Yep, very real over here.

317
00:17:57,494 --> 00:18:00,872

For now.

329
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,815
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

330
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:29,442
And I thought
I had a crazy few months.

331
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:33,154
Shit, I'm sorry, I...

332
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,406
I've been talking
about myself this whole time.

333
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,618
No, I-I mean, you've been
through a lot, I get it.

334
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,411
No, really, I...

335
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,330
I want to know
everything I missed.

336
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,168
Well, college is no joke.

337
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:51,297
I failed a sociology test that's
worth a third of my grade.

338
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,675
Seriously? You?

339
00:18:53,758 --> 00:18:55,552
Yeah.

340
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,429
My grandpa died.
I didn't take it too well.

341
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,306
Oh.

342
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,351
Yeah, I got through it.

343
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,979
The funeral, coming back here.

344
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,023
You know, people asked
where you were.

345
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:12,110
Having to lie about it
wasn't awesome.

346
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:16,322
I didn't think
it would be this complicated.

347
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,615
It's okay.

348
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,159
I knew the deal
when I signed on.

349
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,579
Not just the superhero thing.

350
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,038
All of it.

351
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,457
I thought, with my dad gone,

352
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,460
he was at least done
ruining my life, but...

353
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:33,006
Hey. He can't change
how I feel about you,

354
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,091
no matter how many
planets he destroys.

355
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,802
That's the important thing.

356
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,974
I'm glad you're back.

357
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:11,002
Help.

358
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,338
Help me.

359
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,132
Please.

360
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,094
Sir? Sir?

361
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,805
Are you all right, sir?

362
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,224
Wh-What is it?

363
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,185
There's something
you need to see

364
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,104
on our long-range scans, sir.

365
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,234
This is stupid.

366
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:37,195
I can see in the dark.

367
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,822
That assumes
you still have your eyes.

368
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,752
Time.

369
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:55,046
Monster Girl, Kate, shower off.

370
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,924
Bulletproof, Shapesmith,
you're up.

371
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,888
Immortal, if I may
have a moment,

372
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,641
m-may I remind you that
Monster Girl's transformations

373
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,435
cause her to age in reverse.

374
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,063
I know how
my team's powers work.

375
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,481
Then you must understand

376
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:15,444
that this kind of training
is hazardous for her.

377
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,405
- I've developed a simulation...
- Hey.

378
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,320
I can hear you, you know.

379
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,280
Amanda, I-I noticed the Immortal

380
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,758
wasn't tracking
your transformations.

381
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,576
It's not his job to track
my transformations.

382
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,578
And it's not yours, either.

383
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:30,581
But logically if there's a way
to mitigate your lost time...

384
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,542
If you get this controlling
after one date,

385
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,460
there's not going to be
another one.

386
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,256
Oh no!

387
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,717
Is eighth-grade prom canceled?

388
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,135
Don't tell me...

389
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,387
Aah! Motherfucker!

390
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,931
Oh, fuck.

391
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,175
You know people try to kill us
every single day, right?

392
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,853
Just call, please!

393
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,188
We have a problem.

394
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,820
It's coming from Mars,
headed directly for Earth.

395
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:03,948
We've tried calling,
but they're not answering.

396
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,117
It may be unmanned.

397
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,578
Except it's packed
to the gills with bio-matter.

398
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,792
Ship's coming from Mars, huh?

399
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,628
I wonder if there's anyone here
with insider knowledge...

400
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,672
of Mars.

401
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,636
Um...

402
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,431
Friends,

403
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,601
I have a secret to unbury.

404
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:36,773
I am not a human person from
Earth like I once told you.

405
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,191
Prepare yourselves,

406
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,085
for the truth may be more
than you can handle...

407
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,986
We know
you're a Martian.

408
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,088
What, you thought we'd let you
join the team

409
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,238
without figuring that out?

410
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,615
You all knew that?

411
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:47,200
Son of a bitch.

412
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:48,951
What we don't know...

413
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,205
is how you got to Earth
and why you're here.

414
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,499
Okay, well...

415
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:58,086
Um, I was born a baby Martian,

416
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:01,005
<i>far away on the planet Mars.</i>

417
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:04,509
<i>Like all Martians,
we used sequids as our servants</i>

418
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:07,095
<i>since they couldn't penetrate
our shape-shifting skin,</i>

419
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:10,890
<i>which is something they
very much like to do.</i>

420
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,976
<i>Even as a young Marsling,</i>

421
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,895
<i>I hated living underground.</i>

422
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,481
<i>I wanted to see the stars.</i>

423
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,317
- Wow.
- This way! Run!

424
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,366
<i>So, when the
opportunity presented itself...</i>

425
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:31,702
<i>...I took it.</i>

426
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,665
<i>I hitched a ride to Earth
with your space people.</i>

427
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,501
<i>And when I got here,
I was inspired to do good.</i>

428
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:39,919
<i>I met all of you...</i>

429
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,230
<i>Wait a second.</i>

430
00:23:41,254 --> 00:23:42,839
<i>What happened
to the real astronaut?</i>

431
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:47,677
Well?

432
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,720
M-My people were
right behind us in the tunnels.

433
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,265
I thought they'd find him
before the sequids did.

434
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,267
Find him and kill him, you mean.

435
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,060
But they didn't
find him, did they?

436
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,603
Something else did.

437
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,647
I know... I don't know.

438
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:04,068
Well, okay, given
our present situation

439
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,945
and that big ship
on its way here,

440
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,780
<i>one might assume...</i>

441
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,448
<i>Well, I mean, one might guess</i>

442
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:12,451
<i>that m-maybe...
and, but this is a maybe...</i>

443
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,580
<i>he possibly became...</i>

444
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,373
<i>a possessed host
for the singular</i>

445
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,584
<i>and terrifying sequid hive-mind.</i>

446
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:22,670
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

447
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:25,548
Ah, okay, so we have

448
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,884
God knows how many
of those things headed here,

449
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,511
they possessed
the real Rus Livingston

450
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:32,763
and they're capable of
possessing a million more of us.

451
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,183
And it's all your fault.

452
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,019
Yes, you understand now.

453
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:40,646
Oh, that's bad.

454
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:41,647
Hang on.

455
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:42,891
We're gonna believe this guy?

456
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,109
He lied to us the whole time.

457
00:24:45,193 --> 00:24:47,195
No,
before, I was lying.

458
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,487
Now I'm telling the truth.

459
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,780
It's very different.

460
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,950
You left an American astronaut
up there to die.

461
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:56,412
I... apologize?

462
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,080
Shut up, all of you.

463
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,500
There will be
consequences for this.

464
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:03,424
But that ship cannot
be allowed to reach Earth.

465
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,731
And Shapesmith is the only
source of intelligence we have.

466
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:08,257
We need him. For now.

467
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:11,552
The team will be me,
Bulletproof, Black Sampson,

468
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:13,346
Monster Girl and...

469
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,348
Shapesmith.

470
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:17,892
Rex, Shrinking Rae,
Kate and Rudy,

471
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,393
you'll hold things down here.

472
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:20,895
It's an alien spacecraft,

473
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,022
so you'll need
my technical expertise.

474
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,899
I'll be protected in my suit.

475
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:27,026
Agreed. Rudy, you go, too.

476
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,152
No, you don't understand.

477
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:29,946
There are millions
of sequids on that ship.

478
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,323
Maybe hundreds of millions.
We won't be enough.

479
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:36,244
Look, I realize this is
out of character, but...

480
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,079
I have an idea.

481
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:54,136
<i>♪ Skipping stones
out on the shore ♪</i>

482
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:58,766
<i>♪ Still not sure
what you asked me here for...</i>

483
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:03,271
<i>♪ But I'm scouring the earth
on the forest floor...</i>

484
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,652
<i>♪ Skipping stones
till my arm is sore... ♪</i>

485
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,946
Shit.

486
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,407
You know, it's been
like five years

487
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:17,576
and your parents still haven't
fixed the lock on your window.

488
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,580
I'm starting to wonder if maybe
they want you to be abducted.

489
00:26:21,664 --> 00:26:23,499
I'm not in the mood, Rex.

490
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,502
And I'm not here
to make fun of you.

491
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,795
Seriously.

492
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,298
Ugh. Or to get in your pants.

493
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,384
Or whatever you think
I'm here to do.

494
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:36,387
But when I heard
you were back here,

495
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,431
I knew something was wrong.

496
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,765
Mm.

497
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,226
I don't need your pity, Rex.

498
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:45,396
Since when
do I do pity?

499
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,483
Did you see what I did
in Chicago?

500
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,152
The park collapse?

501
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,820
I heard about it, yeah.

502
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,905
Yeah, I messed up.

503
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,408
People almost got hurt.

504
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,702
And then I took it out
on Killcannon

505
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,288
and people did get hurt.

506
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:04,332
I try to help,

507
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:07,084
and all I do is cause
more problems.

508
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:10,963
My parents were right.
Who do I think I am?

509
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,381
Everybody fucks up.

510
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,300
To fuck up is human.

511
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,594
Eh, Shakespeare said that.

512
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,096
The Immortal. Black Sampson.

513
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,556
Freaking "Robot,"

514
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,933
or Rudy or whatever
he calls himself now.

515
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,102
They've all shit the bed
at least once.

516
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:28,564
Having powers isn't easy, but...

517
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:30,399
we do our best.

518
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,028
Even assholes like me.

519
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:37,073
Just do the math, Eve.

520
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:41,911
You are so far in the black
that it's stupid.

521
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,416
You showed this to me
the week we met.

522
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:53,130
You were still pretty beat up
from losing them.

523
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,720
I hardly think about them now.

524
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:02,723
Because you got through it.

525
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:06,143
And then you got through my
douchebag teenage ass

526
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,020
dumping my problems on you.

527
00:28:08,104 --> 00:28:10,689
And hiding in your bedroom
for a year and a half.

528
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:13,859
Then a hundred other battles
with teen team.

529
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,736
Through all of that,

530
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,739
you've saved so many people.

531
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:23,452
And each time, you made this
shitty, awful, terrible world

532
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,621
a little bit better.

533
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,584
Also, I checked on that couple
you pulled from the river.

534
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,962
They're gonna make
a full recovery.

535
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,922
Because of you.

536
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:36,465
So, dry your tears,

537
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,926
tell your parents
to go shove it up their asses

538
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:41,137
and get back out there, right?

539
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,640
All right.

540
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,977
Thanks, Rex.

541
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,855
Now what do you want?

542
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:54,525
I am offended.

543
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:58,904
But yes, I do have a tiny favor
to ask

544
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,948
that involves
a space rocket ship.

545
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,575
Pew-pew-pew?

546
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,285
<i>Okay.</i>

547
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,914
Open. Delicious.

548
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,210
It's delic...

549
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:15,838
What are we gonna do with you?

550
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,841
You've got to like
at least one human food.

551
00:29:21,552 --> 00:29:24,472
Mark. We have
a front door, you know.

552
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,307
Sorry.

553
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,976
Oh, oh, hey, Mr. Messy.

554
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,352
How's he eating?

555
00:29:30,436 --> 00:29:32,855
Well, so far,
he hates everything.

556
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,483
I guess he'll fit right in
with the human kids.

557
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,276
Uh, sorry.

558
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,278
Hey, do you know
where Dad's stuff is?

559
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,530
I got rid of most of it,
gave it to charity.

560
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,575
What? Y-You could've
asked me first.

561
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:46,452
Well, you were gone
for two months.

562
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,870
And I could've live in limbo

563
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,456
just waiting for you
to come back.

564
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,251
I'm sorry.

565
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,420
- W-What were you looking for?
- It's just...

566
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,714
When the Viltrumites
were taking Dad away,

567
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,091
he told me to read his books.

568
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:05,012
What if he hid something them,
like slid it between the pages?

569
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,186
It's not a good time, Cecil.

570
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,688
Sorry, Debbie, it's urgent.

571
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,774
Mark, I need you
to go to space again.

572
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,401
What? I just got back
from space.

573
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,987
You were actually
pretty pissed about it.

574
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,156
Think of this
as your redemption tour.

575
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,675
We got a ship full
of those sequid things

576
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:27,034
coming in hot from Mars.

577
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:28,202
You remember them?

578
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:29,537
Yeah...

579
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,722
If they get their tentacles
on Earth,

580
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,456
they'll be pulling
our strings forever.

581
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,208
We need to stop them.

582
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,961
Sure. Of course.

583
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,421
You need any help
with the new kid?

584
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,965
We're fine. Thank you.

585
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,484
Well, think about
when you go back to work.

586
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,735
You'll need a trained caretaker,

587
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:45,844
not some neighborhood
babysitter.

588
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,347
- We have people for that.
- That's our decision.

589
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,890
Not yours.

590
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:54,311
Just consider it.

591
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,938
Please?

592
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,696
But you just got back
from space.

593
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,656
<i>Well,
they're heading for Earth.</i>

594
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,324
<i>And it's serious.</i>

595
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,326
<i>And, uh, a lot of people
could get hurt.</i>

596
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,203
<i>So, I...</i>

597
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,665
Just come back safe, okay?

598
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,333
<i>Always.</i>

599
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:27,219
Hey, Jannie,
you guys got plans tonight?

600
00:31:28,345 --> 00:31:29,847
Nah, everything's fine,

601
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:32,808
just want to take my mind
off things.

602
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,942
Invincible, I didn't
know you were joining us.

603
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,903
Yeah, well, this didn't
sound super optional.

604
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,740
- Got room for one more?
- Eve!

605
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:55,497
Hi. R-Rex said you guys
could use a hand.

606
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:56,957
We could indeed.

607
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,126
But will you be vulnerable
to these creatures?

608
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,963
Uh, you're not the only one
who can make a suit of armor.

609
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:08,677
Hmm.
Two minutes to launch.

610
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:12,431
Well, that's my cue to leave
you brave little astronauts

611
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,683
to the endless darkness
of space.

612
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:18,437
If you succeed, well, I taught
you everything you know.

613
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,439
If not...

614
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:22,274
I guess we're all fucked.

615
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:28,781
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

616
00:32:30,115 --> 00:32:32,409
<i>We have ignition.</i>

617
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:34,870
So...

618
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,997
you two may not know this,

619
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:38,749
or acknowledge it any way,

620
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:43,629
but this guy's now
the ranking Guardian on Earth.

621
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,631
Says who?

622
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,133
Uh, me. Just now.

623
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,220
It's like calling shotgun.

624
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,349
Okay, first rule,
no rolling those eyes.

625
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,309
Second rule, get ready.

626
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:59,978
Because we are
just gonna chill out

627
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,022
until those losers get back.

628
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,607
And...

629
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:05,359
there is no third rule.

630
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,278
We're supposed to monitor other
threats while they're gone.

631
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,864
Oh, sure, like there's gonna be

632
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:15,619
two huge world-shattering
emergencies at the same time.

633
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:17,621
Oh, no!

634
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:20,207
I'd like to see that, Rae.

635
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,218
Hey. Who's there?

636
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,304
Sorry, Sarge.

637
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,182
For fuck's sake, Jerry.
You scared the shit out of me.

638
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:39,351
I-I know, I know
it's not my break,

639
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,145
but I-I missed lunch.

640
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,231
Get your damn snack
and get out of...

641
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,735
Ah, hell!

642
00:33:59,037 --> 00:33:59,955
Move!

643
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,540
Yes, sir.

644
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,334
And remember,

645
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:08,172
kill first, ask questions later.

646
00:34:12,301 --> 00:34:14,636
We have a problem.

647
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,638
What's a problem

648
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:19,558
but an opportunity in disguise?

649
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:23,020
You want them to know
we're here?

650
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,521
Of course.

651
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:27,858
This just
speeds things up a bit.

652
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,069
<i>Man, my dad's a dick,</i>

653
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:34,156
but you win the Shitty
Dad Contest hands down.

654
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,534
Yeah, but it was
worse than that.

655
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:39,161
I was gone for so long,

656
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,289
I wasn't there for Amber,
my mom, you.

657
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,291
And you guys needed me.

658
00:34:44,374 --> 00:34:46,960
<i>I'm sure you'll get a
chance to make it up to me soon.</i>

659
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:48,337
<i>Listen up.</i>

660
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,672
We need more information
about the Martian ship.

661
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,758
Its weapon systems,
what kind of resistance

662
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,843
we can expect
once we're on board.

663
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:56,428
So, Shapesmith here

664
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:59,181
is going to answer
all of our questions.

665
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:03,685
I'd rather not, since those are
Martian military secrets.

666
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,312
But I will, though.

667
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:07,940
That ship is one
of our warships.

668
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:10,943
It's very big. There could be
millions of sequids on it,

669
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:12,236
but hopefully not.

670
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:14,822
They're small, but very strong
for their size.

671
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:18,033
A ship full of demon jellyfish
with super strength.

672
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,159
Great.

673
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,702
There must be
Martians on board, too.

674
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,506
The sequids can't
pilot a ship on their own.

675
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,331
We should seek
these Martians out.

676
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,624
Make contact.

677
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,168
Ah, yes, my old chums.

678
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,545
They, um...

679
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,464
They may not be
enthusiastic to see me.

680
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:34,049
I imagine not.

681
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,343
Robot, what's your plan
to get us on board?

682
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:38,637
In just a minute,
I'll cut the shuttle's power.

683
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,722
Like Shapesmith says,
the Martian ship is large,

684
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,683
so we'll look
like debris to them.

685
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:44,786
Then we'll clamp on and cut
an entry hole in the hull.

686
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,936
Good.

687
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:48,272
So good. But it won't work.

688
00:35:48,355 --> 00:35:50,482
Why not?

689
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:52,210
<i>The warship's
sensors are very powerful.</i>

690
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,234
<i>They'll know the difference
between space garbage</i>

691
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,154
<i>and whatever we are.</i>

692
00:35:56,238 --> 00:35:57,322
You're telling us this now?

693
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,199
Yes, I'm telling you this now.

694
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:01,493
Also, they won't hesitate
to fire missiles

695
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:02,744
when they spot us coming.

696
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,121
Shapesmith...?

697
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,306
Yes, those. Look.

698
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,499
Th-Those are the missiles
I was talking about.

699
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,334
<i>Don't we have
shields or something?</i>

700
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:11,104
This isn't <i>Star Trek.</i>
We're unarmed.

701
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:12,838
Everyone, close to me. Now!

702
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,977
Half pepperoni,
half mushroom,

703
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,396
an order of garlic knots
and some wings.

704
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:30,856
Two garlic knots.

705
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:32,357
Two garlic knots.

706
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:36,028
Uh-oh.

707
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,238
No, no, no. Keep ordering, Rae.

708
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:39,924
Cecil's just checking in
to say hi, right?

709
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,909
Cecil? Right?

710
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,206
- Oh, God.
- We need a plan.

711
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,541
I'm gonna barf.

712
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,168
Close your damn eyes, then.

713
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:52,711
Please, calm down.

714
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,838
We have enough oxygen
for at least ten minutes.

715
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,549
I'm not sure I can hold
this together for ten minutes.

716
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:01,136
Everyone who can fly,
push towards the ship.

717
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,449
Hello, fellow Martians.

718
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:24,701
Nice to see you all again.

719
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,662
I was just on Earth and, um...

720
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,664
Earth? You're the one!

721
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,582
You let all of this happen!

722
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,834
I know he is the cause
of all this,

723
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,962
but we are here to help.

724
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,964
You're humans.
They'll enslave you immediately.

725
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,840
We're not like
the rest of our kind.

726
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,301
- We can withstand them...
- Ugh!

727
00:37:41,385 --> 00:37:43,220
- Gross.
- No!

728
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,683
Got it.

729
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,935
They share minds! Now all
the sequids know you're here!

730
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,825
You got any instructions, boss?

731
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,244
Mm, get a soda.

732
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,204
And relax.

733
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,747
The king has a plan.

734
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:12,833
Those are nuclear blast doors.

735
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,835
Impenetrable from the outside.

736
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:18,880
We sealed the tunnel,
so there's no other way in.

737
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,674
Now, we just sit here and wait

738
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:23,427
for the government to comply
with our demands.

739
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:28,473
Otherwise, New York,

740
00:38:28,557 --> 00:38:30,809
Los Angeles,

741
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,436
Chicago...

742
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,650
Die fast, assholes.

743
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,986
My pizza's getting cold.

744
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,575
Ah, humans.

745
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:50,120
You think you can stop us?
You cannot.

746
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:51,580
You.

747
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,206
We remember you.

748
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,375
We can't pierce your skin.

749
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:59,087
No matter. There will be others
for our purposes.

750
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:00,547
Get them off him!

751
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,549
It's the only way.

752
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,936
There's too many!

753
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,314
We need a new plan.

754
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:25,506
I disrupted
their nervous systems,

755
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,199
but they'll be awake again soon.

756
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,618
Kill as many as you can
while they're out.

757
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:40,837
- Oh, shit.
- Get close.

758
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,196
I thought...

759
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,864
These guys...

760
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:09,533
Were supposed...

761
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:12,994
To suck.

762
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,341
Hey, Kate!

763
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,261
Remember, whoever dies first
pays for pizza.

764
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:43,608
Rex. R-Rae.

765
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,779
Help. Help.

766
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,865
Hold on!

767
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,792
Kate!

768
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:06,256
Oh, God, no!

769
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:14,931
Come on, Eve. You can do this.

770
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:18,935
Are you crazy?

771
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,562
I can use my suit
to build an amplifier

772
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,022
for the pulse I used earlier.

773
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,857
It'll hopefully stun them
long enough

774
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,734
for us to get Rus off this ship.

775
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:28,069
But you'll need to protect me
until I'm done.

776
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:29,487
How long?

777
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,031
Five minutes.

778
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:42,250
You're gonna fucking pay
for that.

779
00:42:09,194 --> 00:42:10,612
Hey, idiot.

780
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,323
She doesn't stay small.

781
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,141
Yum.

782
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,686
Uh...

783
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,198
Oh, this isn't happening.

784
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:58,201
This isn't happening.

785
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,755
Jesus!

786
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,024
Fuck.

787
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,692
Hmm.

788
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:33,820
So brave.

789
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,781
But is it the brave man
who survives

790
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:39,200
or is it the one who waits

791
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:43,371
until his opponent
is too injured to fight?

792
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:46,666
Just do it, you prick.

793
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,628
You got this.

794
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,298
Come on, hold it together.
You got this.

795
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,841
Can't hold it.

796
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:57,052
No. No, no, no. Eve!

797
00:44:22,118 --> 00:44:24,496
Oh, wow.

798
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:29,084
Wow.

799
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,544
Oh, wow.

800
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:33,755
I'm not dead.

801
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,924
I was pretty sure I was dead.

802
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,550
Felt like I was dead.

803
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,677
This is...

804
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,389
Oh, this is a nice surprise.

805
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:44,224
Um...

806
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,850
Hello?

807
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:48,728
Hello?

808
00:44:48,812 --> 00:44:51,773
Someone want to let me out
of this, uh, thing?

809
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:56,569
Well, this is great.

810
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:02,534
Oh, no. Oh, I'm sorr... sorry!
Oh, God, oh, crap.

811
00:45:02,617 --> 00:45:05,537
Oh, I broke... I broke it.
I broke it.

812
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,581
Oh, this thing, I bet this is...
Oh, I bet this is expensive.

813
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,458
Oh, God.

814
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,210
Huh.

815
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:13,878
Huh.

816
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:16,047
Would you look at that?

817
00:45:16,131 --> 00:45:20,301
I am glad to see you
in one piece, Allen of Unopa.

818
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:24,305
Yeah. One very large
and ripped piece.

819
00:45:25,348 --> 00:45:27,142
Yes.

820
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,893
I'm afraid I owe you an apology.

821
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:32,272
When we brought you here
after the Viltrumite attack,

822
00:45:32,355 --> 00:45:34,983
I turned off
your life-support machine

823
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,985
and left you
to fend for yourself.

824
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:40,488
What? Why?
W-Why would you do that?

825
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:43,241
I knew, without it,
you would either die

826
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:45,827
or recover stronger than before.

827
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,038
I am sorry I gambled
with your life,

828
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:51,458
but it has paid off.

829
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,835
You may now be able
to stand your ground

830
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,837
against a Viltrumite.

831
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,839
Yeah, I doubt that.

832
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,674
They hit me so hard
my eye came out.

833
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,051
I remember seeing that,
like, from my own eye.

834
00:46:02,135 --> 00:46:04,471
It was very strange.

835
00:46:04,554 --> 00:46:07,182
You underestimate yourself,
Allen.

836
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:10,018
Yeah, well, I appreciate
your vote of confidence,

837
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,645
but I'm not gonna ask
for a rematch anytime soon.

838
00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:15,106
If I even see another
Viltrumite, I'm gonna...

839
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:24,782
Holy shit. You're a Viltrumite?

840
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:28,411
No, I am something much worse.

841
00:46:28,495 --> 00:46:33,833
I am the only Viltrumite to ever
rebel against the empire.

842
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:39,464
At least, until you told me
about Invincible.

843
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,299
Allen,

844
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,052
I need you to go back to Earth

845
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,888
and bring Invincible here.

846
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:52,227
He is the key
to turning the tide of this war.
