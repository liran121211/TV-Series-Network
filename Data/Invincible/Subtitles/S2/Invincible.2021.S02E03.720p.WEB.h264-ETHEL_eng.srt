5

00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:21,939
I don't have
anyone to talk to,

10
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,733

to Thaedus

158

that the breeding camps
were also

162
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,547

Until... Allen.

164
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,804
He was
the first and only success.

165
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,057
From the day he was born,
Allen was trained to be

166
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,435
the greatest fighter
the universe had ever known.

167
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,689
Even before adulthood,
an opponent could not be found

168
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,108
who didn't fall to his might.

169
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:33,198
Soon, it was time for Allen to
embark on his first mission.

170
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:36,243
But while stronger than
most of the universe,

171
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:38,161
Allen still couldn't match

172
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,956
even a single Viltrumite
in combat.

173
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,625
The program was considered
a failure

174
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:45,585
and ended.

175
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,965
Instead, Allen was made
a planetary evaluation officer

176
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,801
and sent to discover
any being able to defeat him

177
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,845
in hope of finding

178
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,014
an ally strong enough
to withstand a Viltrumite.

179
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,767
And while it may be true
that Allen was supposed to be

180
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,687
keeping tabs on the planet
Urath and accidentally

181
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,647
went to Earth instead,

182
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,191
his mistake led him
to Mark Grayson,

183
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,444
a half-human, half-Viltrumite

184
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,071
sympathetic to
the coalition cause.

185
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:17,743
Because sometimes,
to change the entire universe,

186
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,828
you have to be...

187
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,516
♪ Trouble's on
when you travel light ♪

188
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,144
♪ Dropped call
in the dead of night...

189
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,021
Home sweet home.

190
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,399
♪ Will you answer me? ♪

191
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,234
♪ Ah ♪

192
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,321
♪ Make amends
on another strike...

193
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,824
This time
Allen bears a rare

194
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:00,660
and valuable gift
for the coalition.

195
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,287
Hope.

196
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:07,376
Data log.

197
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,877
Hello to you, too.
Here you go.

198
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,589
Hmm.

199
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,972
You found the right planet
this time.

200
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,016
Yes, I found the right planet.

201
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,103
Because it was the wrong planet
you already found before.

202
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,272
- Sure, but that's not really...
- Most of our agents don't make

203
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,608
so many astronavigational
mistakes.

204
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,110
Listen, sparky.

205
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,904
Is it still a mistake if
it ends up saving the universe?

206
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:37,864
- Yes.
- Yeah.

207
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:40,617
You're late.

208
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,868
General Telia.

209
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,579
My apologies.
I got here as soon as I could.

210
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,999
The Viltrumites hit Aikreon
while you were gone.

211
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,669
What? But they just
joined the council...

212
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,587
It's terrified the sector.

213
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,549
Other planets we were talking to
cut all communications.

214
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:57,551
We need more allies.

215
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,471
And they're making it
very difficult.

216
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,266
Then good thing I found us one.

217
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:07,853
What news, Allen of Unopa?

218
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,230
Did you warn the Earth champion

219
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:13,108
that a Viltrumite lives
among his people?

220
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,443
Yeah, I did.

221
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:17,487
But it turns out
he's a Viltrumite, too.

222
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:21,992
His name is Mark
and he's only half-Viltrumite.

223
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:24,911
Unbelievable.

224
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,205
I know, I know.
It sounds bad.

225
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,541
But he is not like them.

226
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,501
He didn't even know
what a Viltrumite was

227
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:32,502
until recently.

228
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,551
How is that possible?

229
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,052
No one told him, I guess.

230
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,345
When he got his powers,

231
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,514
all he wanted to do was
help other humans.

232
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:47,309
Then his father decided it was
time to conquer the planet,

233
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,811
so they, they got
in a fight about it.

234
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:53,023
Viltrumite against Viltrumite?

235
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,152
That has not happened
since the great purge.

236
00:12:57,235 --> 00:13:01,490
And get this.
After they fought, his dad left.

237
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:04,284
Like, left the planet.
Disappeared completely.

238
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,995
We could never trust
one of them.

239
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,456
Mark isn't like
other Viltrumites.

240
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,209
He just wants to
protect his world.

241
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,587
And conquer others in its name.

242
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,298
No, stop.
That is not his deal.

243
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,884
He's a good guy,
not a conqueror.

244
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,719
So far.

245
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,138
Have you guys been
listening at all?

246
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,266
For years we've been
searching for a hole

247
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,726
in the Viltrumites' armor.

248
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,645
This could be it.

249
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,147
Thaedus, you can't trust
this report.

250
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,943
Allen is right.

251
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:42,030
Viltrumites never abandon
their missions.

252
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,866
Yet one has.

253
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,578
Viltrumites
do not battle each other,

254
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:52,582
but a son defies his father.

255
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,043
These are weaknesses.

256
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,256
The first we've found

257
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,718
and ones we must
learn to exploit.

258
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,930
Perhaps Viltrum's grip
on the galaxy is not

259
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:10,600
as steady as we imagine.

260
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,228
You have done well, Allen,

261
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:16,648
and given us much to discuss.

262
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:20,068
We will call on you again soon.

263
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,445
Thank you, great Thaedus.

264
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,990
I'm honored to serve.

265
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,458
They have no idea
what this means.

266
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,168
If there are other
Viltrumite kids out there,

267
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,463
maybe we can turn them
against their parents, too.

268
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,674
Also, why are they
breeding with other races?

269
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,884
I thought Viltrumites believed
in racial purity.

270
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,595
See? That's a good question.

271
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,013
Why didn't they ask
stuff like that

272
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,431
instead of shouting at me?

273
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,600
Allen, before you depart,

274
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:53,101
a word?

275
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,188
Of course, wise Thaedus.

276
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,529
I find it convenient
and somewhat alarming

277
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:10,535
that Aikreon was hit so soon
after joining the coalition.

278
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:13,038
It's as if the Viltrumites
had knowledge

279
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:15,540
from inside the council.

280
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:20,086
You want me to discover
if someone's betrayed us.

281
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:24,132
Ah, Allen, you continue
to prove yourself

282
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:27,719
the coalition's most
valuable asset.

283
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,220
Thank you, sir.

284
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:31,848
If there's a mole,
I'll find them.

285
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,081
Hey, Vorg.
Hey, little buddy.

286
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:59,209
Did you miss me?

287
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,212
Yes, you did.
Yes, you did.

288
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,714
You did miss your daddy,
didn't you?

289
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,634
Shh.

290
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,182
Huh?

291
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,767
Did you miss me?

292
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,144
Oh, I missed you.

293
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:20,605
- Yeah? How much?
- The most.

294
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,608
Or like ten times that amount.
Maybe more even.

295
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,777
Oh, let's see if that's true.

296
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,825
Oh, goodness.
Tentacles.

297
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,368
I, uh...

298
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,371
Perhaps now would be
a good time to return to Earth

299
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,082
and rejoin Amber Bennett
and Mark Grayson

300
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,000
as they begin their studies

301
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,212
at the prestigious
Upstate University.

302
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,631
Oh, I see, uh...

303
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,883
No. Let's not do that, then.

304
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,764
Well, um...

305
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,641
Aha, aha.

306
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,310
Here we find
the Unopan feline.

307
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,979
Perhaps unsurprisingly,

308
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:04,398
he has one large eye
in the center of his head.

309
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,276
But that doesn't
stop him from having

310
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,904
all manner of
household adventures.

311
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:18,413
Oh, man,
I have been dying for this.

312
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,208
I don't know
how you eat kanzlok.

313
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,710
It's disgusting.

314
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:26,378
He doesn't think so.

315
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:39,184
Mmm... Mm?

316
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,900
No matter how far I travel,

317
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:48,610
Talescria's still
the most beautiful planet

318
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,069
I've ever seen.

319
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,655
There's hundreds of planets
that look exactly like it.

320
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,492
Sure. But only one has you.

321
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,286
Wow.

322
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,956
Hey, what did Thaedus
want to talk about

323
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,374
after the council meeting?

324
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,543
Um...

325
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,296
Look, I'm not really
supposed to, uh...

326
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:10,715
Okay, okay, fine.

327
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,469
Thaedus thinks there's a mole.

328
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,679
And I am supposed to...

329
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,690
Allen!

330
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,956
Oh, fuck.

331
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:46,376
Unopan,
answer our questions

332
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,962
and we will consider
sparing your life.

333
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,421
That is not your style.

334
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:53,758
Isn't it kill first,
ask questions... never?

335
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,301
You will tell us everything

336
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,804
about your encounter with
the Viltrumite of Earth.

337
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:01,057
I mean, not technically
a question if...

338
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,770
Are you certain
he sired an heir?

339
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:08,398
Are you certain
he abandoned his post?

340
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,233
Who told you that?
I mean it.

341
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,402
I'd really like to know
because...

342
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,497
Where's the father now?

343
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,794
The father?
Which one was he again?

344
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,005
You biclops all kind of
look the same to me.

345
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,188
♪ ♪

346
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,293
Great Thaedus.

347
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,505
How is he?

348
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,883
Uh... alive. For now.

349
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,011
It may not seem like it,

350
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,973
but that is cause
for celebration.

351
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:09,852
They once again underestimate
the Unopan will to survive.

352
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,858
I know you and Allen are

353
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,653
special to one another.

354
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,363
Thank you, sir.

355
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,701
To come here,
attack Allen at home,

356
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,787
the Viltrumites must know
we've discovered something.

357
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,331
Something that scares them.

358
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:32,834
And we will exploit it.

359
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,585
You should get some rest.

360
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,087
Go.

361
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,715
I will watch over him.

362
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:02,905
Forgive me, Allen.

363
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,254
Come on.

364
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,464
- Two more.
- Come on.

365
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,424
Two more.

366
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,813
Are we gonna talk about this,

367
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:37,732
or is it just gonna be
awkward forever?

368
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:41,235
Uh... the second one?

369
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:44,447
God, why do you have to be
so immature?

370
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,866
I'm immature? Uh,

371
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,911
you cheated on me
with the Immortal.

372
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,955
That's what you think happened?
Seriously?

373
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,874
And even if that was true,

374
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,043
you were cheating on Eve
with me first.

375
00:22:58,127 --> 00:23:01,798
Okay, but that worked out
in your favor.

376
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,966
You are unbelievable.

377
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,052
And you're gross.

378
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:09,889
The Immortal's like
2,000 years old, you know.

379
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,768
Not that I have to justify
anything to you ever,

380
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,394
but if you add up
the amount of time

381
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:19,232
my duplicates and I have lived,
we are probably the same age.

382
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,275
Oh, okay, okay.

383
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,029
So I'm too young for you now?
I-I-Is that it?

384
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,032
No, Rex.
You're just an asshole.

385
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,284
Well, how is that news?

386
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:35,206
Look, come on, Kate, talk to me.
What is this about?

387
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:38,584
You really want to know, Rex?

388
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,420
Yeah, I kinda do.

389
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,298
Fine.

390
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,802
The Immortal's
the only person I've ever met

391
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,888
who's died
as many times as I have.

392
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:53,182
Maybe you don't understand that,

393
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,226
but it means something.

394
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:57,937
He gets it.

395
00:24:01,816 --> 00:24:04,944
And... Rex doesn't.

396
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,825
I get that you
shouldn't be eavesdropping.

397
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,536
So please fuck
the fuck off already.

398
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,288
It's not your gym, dickbag.

399
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:16,914
What? Are you gonna knock
my teeth out again?

400
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,250
- Don't be a jerk, Rex.
- Too late.

401
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,085
Uh, at least I'm not a cheater.

402
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:24,422
- But you literally are!
- But that was before!

403
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm not now.

404
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,014
Oh, hello, chums.

405
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:36,434
I'd like to run while remaining
in a stationary location.

406
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:37,935
Is that cool beans?

407
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,898
Where are you from?

408
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,108
For real.
Where are you from?

409
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,651
Go ahead, Shapesmith.

410
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:46,777
I'll just be over there.

411
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,487
In a stationary location.

412
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,079
Well, this has been
about as much fun

413
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,789
as eating a light bulb.

414
00:25:22,063 --> 00:25:24,649
Hey, Mozart, what's all this?

415
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,945
Uh... it's Strauss, actually.

416
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:33,115
Is that a brain?
Is that your brain?

417
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,284
Uh... yes.

418
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,664
You're gonna make me ask,
aren't you?

419
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,707
I was less than satisfied

420
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,709
with my performance
against the Giant.

421
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,002
Oh, yeah.

422
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:47,004
You totally shit the bed
on that one.

423
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:50,299
It sucks actually
feeling fear, doesn't it?

424
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,427
It was...

425
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,638
unacceptable.

426
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:56,722
Sorry.

427
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,892
Sensitivity's never been
my strong suit.

428
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:00,935
No, you're right.

429
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:02,687
I-I don't need you
to sugarcoat it.

430
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,023
Which is why I've decided
to resolve the problem.

431
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,025
I set up
this visual feedback system

432
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:09,944
so I could practice controlling
my fear response

433
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,280
via meditation
and active thought.

434
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:14,365
Are you sure that's a good idea?

435
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:16,367
People feel fear for a reason.

436
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,161
And it's usually a good reason.

437
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,914
Fear is an extraneous emotion

438
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:24,917
that serves no real purpose
for someone like me.

439
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,753
I strongly disagree, but...

440
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:29,755
I guess
you'll find out the hard way.

441
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:32,800
Have fun next time you fall
off a cliff or something.

442
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,065
Amanda?

443
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,822
Fear hasn't just made me useless
in battle.

444
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,574
It-It's prevented me
from doing something else

445
00:26:56,657 --> 00:26:57,575
I've wanted to do

446
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,410
for quite some time.

447
00:27:01,078 --> 00:27:03,331
Will you go to a movie with me?

448
00:27:03,414 --> 00:27:05,958
A... movie?

449
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,543
Oh.

450
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,627
Sure.

451
00:27:08,711 --> 00:27:09,795
Sure, Rudy.

452
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:12,089
I'll-I'll go to a movie
with you.

453
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:18,220
It feels like vertigo.

454
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:21,140
They talk about
the physical symptoms of grief--

455
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,059
depression, lethargy, all that.

456
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,393
Uh, but...

457
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,645
when the thought of her
takes me by surprise

458
00:27:26,729 --> 00:27:27,730
in the middle of the day,

459
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,899
it's like I'm falling.

460
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,779
I try to grab on to something
but there's nothing to grab.

461
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,113
It's terrifying

462
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:38,741
and exhausting, and I just...

463
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,328
I still miss her so much.

464
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,830
That's all I got.

465
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,499
Thanks, Theo.

466
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:51,587
Okay, let's take a few,
everybody.

467
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,589
Carol?

468
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,508
Hi! You must be Debbie.

469
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,176
I'm so sorry
about the other day.

470
00:27:57,259 --> 00:28:00,596
My three-month-old has
the worst colic right now.

471
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,931
Ugh, I remember.

472
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,141
My son,
he was such a fussy baby.

473
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:07,186
How old is he now?

474
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,938
Eighteen.

475
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,524
Practically a man.

476
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,068
He is.

477
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,579
So, um, ground rules.

478
00:28:25,663 --> 00:28:27,706
We're not that different
from other support groups

479
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,709
except we're even more strict
when it comes to identity.

480
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,003
First names only.

481
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:35,756
You aren't required to share
till you're ready,

482
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,676
but that's why we're
all sacrificing a Tuesday night,

483
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,095
so might as well
make the most of it.

484
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:42,596
Bathroom's down the hall.

485
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,182
Coffee tastes like battery acid.

486
00:28:45,266 --> 00:28:47,017
Any questions?

487
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,436
I think you covered it.

488
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,729
Great. Have a seat.

489
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,898
All right, everybody, who's up?

490
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:59,029
Hi. I'm Lucinda.

491
00:28:59,113 --> 00:29:01,532
Hi, Lucinda.

492
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,552
I didn't say much
at my first meeting either.

493
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,639
Took me almost a month
to talk to anybody.

494
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,266
Now they can't shut me up.

495
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,435
I see.

496
00:29:30,478 --> 00:29:31,479
Sorry.

497
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:33,105
I can leave you alone.

498
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,523
N-No, it's fine. I j...

499
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,860
Uh, I dropped my son off
at college today.

500
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,487
Empty house?

501
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,738
Yeah.

502
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,073
It's okay. I totally get it.

503
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,283
We all do.

504
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,078
Hey, don't take this
the wrong way,

505
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,914
but there's a bar
down the street

506
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:52,291
some of us like to go to
after group.

507
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,667
Oh.

508
00:29:53,751 --> 00:29:55,085
Uh, I just figured,

509
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,505
since it seems like neither
of us wants to go home.

510
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,590
But no pressure, of course.

511
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:04,303
Sure.

512
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,638
I could use a drink.

513
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,890
It's, uh, it's kind of a dive.

514
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,143
The best ones are.

515
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:13,771
Never?

516
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:16,148
Of course I've watched films,

517
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:18,484
but, no,
I've never attended one.

518
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,781
I had more important things
to do.

519
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:25,157
And I, uh...

520
00:30:25,241 --> 00:30:27,034
wouldn't have fit before.

521
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:30,287
Someday you'll have to tell me
all about your childhood.

522
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:34,083
Oh, we're already seeing
a horror movie tonight.

523
00:30:37,503 --> 00:30:41,257
Hey. You wanted to test
your fear response again.

524
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,968
Uh, two tickets
for Midnight Slaughter.

525
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,344
That's rated "R."

526
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,679
I see.

527
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:47,846
And?

528
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,516
You need your parents to buy you
R-rated tickets.

529
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,934
That's ridiculous.

530
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,269
How does a parent's presence

531
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,604
change a film's suitability
for the underage?

532
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,815
It changes it
in that I don't get fired

533
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,817
- for selling you a ticket.
- Hey.

534
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,820
It's fine. They're my kids.
They can see the movie.

535
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:06,657
What?

536
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,534
You want to do a DNA test now?

537
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:14,498
- How...
- This might be your
first movie, but it's not mine.

538
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:17,835
You'd be surprised what people
will do for ten bucks.

539
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:20,754
Wait, if this is
your first movie,

540
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:23,841
what other normal stuff
haven't you done?

541
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,765
This is supposed
to be appetizing?

542
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,310
Says the guy who used
to eat food through his butt.

543
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,352
That's not how...

544
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,271
It entered through my...

545
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,651
Mmm.

546
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:44,486
Is it appetizing now?

547
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,488
Mmm.

548
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:48,741
I know these aren't good for me,
but...

549
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,327
Oh, shut up.

550
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,578
A good burger and fries

551
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:54,747
is one of the greatest pleasures
in life.

552
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,666
Yes. Mmm. I'm discovering that.

553
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,504
Oh! Oh! I'm sorry!

554
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,757
Let me get you some more.
Uh, waiter?

555
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,925
Waiter, uh, more fries, please.

556
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,722
Rudy, there's no waiters
in Burger Mart.

557
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,063
Did you move
after your partner

558
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,482
passed away?

559
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,983
I moved the furniture.

560
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,526
Couldn't afford to relocate.

561
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,611
You?

562
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,530
I stayed for my son, but... now?

563
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:29,823
I don't know.

564
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,076
Maybe it's time for a change.

565
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,243
Change is good.

566
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:34,411
Yeah.

567
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,205
Problem is, where would I go?

568
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:37,623
Somewhere new.

569
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:40,292
So much of it
still feels connected to him.

570
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:43,128
When we wanted Indian food,
we'd go to India.

571
00:32:43,212 --> 00:32:45,839
We'd fly to Tokyo and back
on a Wednesday night.

572
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:48,384
Oh.
One Christmas Eve,

573
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,095
we even made a snowman
at the North Pole.

574
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:53,681
My son cried when he didn't see
Santa's workshop,

575
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,600
so we told him we'd gone
to the South Pole by mistake.

576
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,563
Sounds like you two had
a pretty amazing life together.

577
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,149
We did.

578
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,320
You can still be angry.

579
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:10,364
That's okay. God knows I am.

580
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,157
Thanks.

581
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,702
It's good to talk
with someone who understands.

582
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:16,620
I wish
I could tell you it gets easier,

583
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,622
- but Alana's been gone
nearly a year...
- Uh...

584
00:33:18,706 --> 00:33:22,668
...and I still reach across
the bed for her every morning.

585
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:24,795
Alana?

586
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,380
- You mean...
- Yeah.

587
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,550
She was the Green Ghost.

588
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,761
Guess I just broke
rule number one of SOS.

589
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,264
Not that it matters now,

590
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:38,809
since she got murdered
by that alien psychopath.

591
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,395
I-I didn't know
she had a partner.

592
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:43,731
We used to fight about that.

593
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,858
She wanted to protect me.

594
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,780
I need to use the restroom.

595
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:52,990
Are you okay?

596
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,075
No, I'll-I'll be right back.

597
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:10,757
Oh, my God.

598
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:12,092
You had sex with Amber.

599
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,469
Whoa, what?

600
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:14,928
- William.
- How was it?

601
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,804
- I want all the details.
- Gross.

602
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,141
No. No way. No.

603
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:22,186
We're roommates now. This is
what roommates talk about.

604
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:23,437
Okay, well, what about you?

605
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,106
How was Mr. Is This Your Stuff?

606
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,107
What are you talking about?

607
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,942
That hot guy from earlier.

608
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,779
I came back, and you had
the sock on the door.

609
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:33,864
Oh.

610
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,866
Ugh, I wish.

611
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:38,284
I must have forgotten to take it
off after my demonstration.

612
00:34:38,368 --> 00:34:40,370
Wait, y-you thought

613
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:41,996
h-he and I...

614
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,165
Uh, yeah.

615
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,166
Hmm.

616
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,918
Super flattered.

617
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:49,713
But I'm kind of still screwed-up
about what happened to Rick.

618
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:52,674
I always imagined we'd be here
at Upstate together.

619
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,594
Cecil said he's doing better.

620
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,514
He should be released
in a month or so.

621
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,140
I know.

622
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,975
Sorry, I wasn't trying
to make you feel bad.

623
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,186
No, it's, it's okay.

624
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:11,819
Hey, I bet that's somebody ready
for round two.

625
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:13,403
Coming, Ambers.

626
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:14,988
It's not Amber.

627
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,573
We made plans
for tomorrow night.

628
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,659
I bet you did.

629
00:35:18,742 --> 00:35:20,452
Mark Grayson?

630
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,046
It's for you.

631
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,260
Mark Grayson.

632
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:38,720
I need your help.

633
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,559
Who are you?

634
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,853
Why, it is I, Séance Dog.

635
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,439
Fight fire with fire,
fight evil with magic.

636
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:51,108
That's me.

637
00:35:51,191 --> 00:35:54,194
Huh?

638
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,656
Mark.

639
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,075
I come with an important...

640
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,664
Séance Dog isn't real.

641
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,541
He's a comic book character.

642
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:09,167
In your dimension, yes.

643
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:11,378
But there exist myriad
other worlds

644
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,715
where dogs and magic are
as real as the air you breathe.

645
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:16,967
We have dogs.
Dogs are real.

646
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,386
Well, then you're halfway
to understanding.

647
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:21,930
Open your mind and let me help
you reach the other side.

648
00:36:22,014 --> 00:36:25,851
Hey, well, whatever you're
doing, don't, I'm warning you.

649
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,688
Mark Grayson, I come because...

650
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:34,276
Wait! Please!
You don't understand.

651
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,452
Last chance.

652
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,580
Who are you,
and what do you want?

653
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:02,429
I'm sorry, my disguise
was meant to disarm you.

654
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,723
I thought if I appeared
as something you love...

655
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,017
- Disarm me for what?
- Please.

656
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,518
I'm not a threat.

657
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,104
The journey to your world
has taken me most of my life.

658
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,481
May I rise?

659
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:14,983
If you answer my questions.

660
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,820
My name is Nuolzot.

661
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,572
I am from the planet Thraxa.

662
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,991
My people sent me
to plead for your help.

663
00:37:23,075 --> 00:37:24,284
Thraxa?

664
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:25,994
It's a couple galaxies away,
uh, give or take.

665
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:29,206
I mean, not very far.
You go... It doesn't matter.

666
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,041
How do you know who I am?

667
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:33,168
Rumors of the one
they call Invincible

668
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,795
have spread like wildfire.

669
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:36,672
Your speed, your strength.

670
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,465
You are the only one
who can save our people

671
00:37:38,548 --> 00:37:40,717
from the meteor showers
destroying our world.

672
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:45,180
Okay, listen, um...

673
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,348
Nuolzot.

674
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,142
Nuol... zot.

675
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:51,228
I just got to college, man.

676
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,981
I haven't even had
my first day of classes yet.

677
00:37:54,064 --> 00:37:57,275
Are you kidding me,
Mark?

678
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,696
Nuolzot came all the way here
from...

679
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,573
to beg for your help,
and you're too busy?

680
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:06,827
How many bug people
are in danger?

681
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,328
All of them.

682
00:38:08,412 --> 00:38:09,913
But, like, a number.

683
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:13,917
Oh. Forty-two billion.

684
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,460
Don't worry about your classes.

685
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,338
I'll cover for you somehow.

686
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:21,133
Why do you care so much?

687
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:24,177
Because last time you didn't
want to help someone,

688
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:27,055
we both regretted it.

689
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:31,893
We believe in you,
Mark Grayson.

690
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,568
No,
you can't just go

691
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:41,820
to some random planet
with some random alien.

692
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,321
Are you insane?

693
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,782
The Guardians can keep an eye
on things while I'm gone.

694
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:48,702
I won't be more than
a few weeks. A month tops.

695
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,078
Depending on asteroid traffic.

696
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,538
Oh, it shouldn't be
that bad.

697
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:53,165
It shouldn't be that bad.

698
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:58,170
You work for me
here on Earth.

699
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,590
Look, a-a lot of people
died because of me, Cecil.

700
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,508
This is a chance to save lives.

701
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:04,760
Billions of them.

702
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,221
And this is an order: do not go.

703
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,269
I need to listen to myself
before I listen to you.

704
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,814
Your father felt the same way.

705
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,319
Well, I'll check in
when I get back.

706
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,574
Goddamn it, Mark.

707
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:30,327
Fucking kid.

708
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,122
You're a good human,
Mark Grayson.

709
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,877
Hey, when I'm in this outfit,
I'm Invincible.

710
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,295
So far.

711
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,090
No, I'm saying, like, you have
to call me Invincible.

712
00:39:43,173 --> 00:39:44,591
It's like a secret identity.

713
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:48,178
Oh, right, of course.
Invincible.

714
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:51,056
We need to make
a quick stop first.

715
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:04,236
Hey, you. How's it going?

716
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,321
Hey. Come to your window.

717
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:10,867
And?

718
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,161
Look up.

719
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,997
Mark?

720
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,251
Uh, I have to go away
for a few weeks.

721
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:20,585
To space again.

722
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,379
Like, right now?

723
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,464
A lot of people are gonna die
if I don't.

724
00:40:24,548 --> 00:40:26,299
- I'm sorry, but I...
- No, stop, stop.

725
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:27,634
Don't apologize.

726
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,469
Never apologize
for saving lives.

727
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:32,472
This is the deal,
and I'm good with it. Go.

728
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:36,935
Thanks.

729
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,110
Can you tell my mom, please?

730
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:46,945
Yeah, of course.

731
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:51,449
Be careful.

732
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,243
Always.

733
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,829
Amber, I, uh...

734
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,455
Yeah?

735
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:59,082
I love you.

736
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,018
Are you comfortable,
Mark Gray...

737
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:19,978
Uh, sorry. Invincible?

738
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,355
Yeah. Thanks.

739
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,608
Hey, how long until
we get to Thraxa?

740
00:41:24,691 --> 00:41:27,569
Approximately six
of your Earth days.

741
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,781
Space sucks.

742
00:41:44,544 --> 00:41:47,964
Debbie. Are you okay?

743
00:41:48,048 --> 00:41:50,342
Di-Did I say something wrong?

744
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,929
I'm sorry. Tonight...
Tonight's been a little much.

745
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,514
I get it. I-It's a lot.

746
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:59,517
I haven't talked to anyone
about any of this,

747
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,270
except my son,
and that probably makes me

748
00:42:02,354 --> 00:42:04,105
a bad parent on top
of everything else.

749
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,607
Hey,

750
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,484
it takes time to heal.

751
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:11,154
I can't heal because
my husband's not dead.

752
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:13,823
He's just gone.

753
00:42:15,242 --> 00:42:18,370
He's gone because...

754
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:21,539
because he murdered Alana
and the other Guardians

755
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,208
and almost killed my son, too.

756
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:27,754
Your husband.
Your husband's Omni-Man?

757
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,424
I thought he was Nolan Grayson,
but that wasn't true.

758
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:35,178
The last 20 years of my life
have been a lie.

759
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:38,974
I wish he was dead.

760
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,518
I wish I could grieve
and move on, but I ca...

761
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,686
I-I can't.

762
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,479
I wish he was dead, too.

763
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,481
But not for your sake.

764
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,693
You shouldn't come back
to the group.

765
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,028
It wouldn't be a safe space
with you there.

766
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:53,822
I didn't know.

767
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:56,449
I didn't know who he was.

768
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,744
You should have.

769
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,602
Invincible?

770
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,938
Invincible.

771
00:43:27,022 --> 00:43:28,815
- Invincible.
- Huh!

772
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:30,650
We're here.

773
00:43:54,758 --> 00:43:57,510
Uh... hi?

774
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,100
Oh, don't mind them.
Come.

775
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,853
The monarch wants
to meet you at once.

776
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,738
Wait, what exactly about
this planet needs saving?

777
00:44:16,821 --> 00:44:18,448
Where are the meteors?

778
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,575
Meteors?
What meteors?

779
00:44:22,577 --> 00:44:26,456
The ones that are
killing billions?

780
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,667
Oh, yeah, those meteors.

781
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:31,628
You know, must be
a touch of dementia.

782
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:34,506
We age much quicker
than you humans, you know.

783
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,801
Uh, don't worry,
the monarch will explain all.

784
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,436
Your Majesty.

785
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:54,234
May I present Invincible
of Earth.

786
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:56,903
Oh.

787
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:08,540
Hello, son.

788
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:09,749
Huh?

789
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,877
It's been a while.

790
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:16,840
Dad?
