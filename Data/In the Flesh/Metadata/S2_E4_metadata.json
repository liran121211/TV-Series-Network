With no support from the family he seeks out Simon, but Amy tells him that Simon has gone to the city. Simon was, in fact, the First Risen at the Rising, where he unwittingly killed his mother, and was the subject of horrifying experiments by sadistic Dr John Weston and his apparently kinder colleague Victor Halperin to study and control him. Such treatment caused him to espouse the ULA and now he is told by the anonymous Undead Prophet that he must return to Roarton and kill Kieren in order to effect a Second Rising. Maxine's spies however have alerted her to his mission.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3754898", "rating": 7.9, "votes": 223, "number_of_episodes": 9}
