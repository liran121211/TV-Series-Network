1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
-Oh! I've got to save the princess.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,217
Hey, where's the Bowser?

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,613
He's usually in here.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,338
[Orange laughs]

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,260
What was that?

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,580
Sounded like it came from over here.

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,340
Princess? Toad?

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,173
-I'm not a toad. I'm an orange.
[laughs]

9
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,780
-Whoa... what did you do
with the princess and Toad?

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,777
-Toad?
Is that like a frog?

11
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,380
-No, is more like,
you know, mushroom.

12
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,655
-I know him.
He's a "fun-guy."

13
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,636
[laughs]

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,590
-All right, enough of the funny stuff.

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,854
Are you ready to a-fight?

16
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,480
-Not really. I'm kinda hungry.

17
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,802
-Well, then try out one
of my spicy meatballs.

18
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,352
-[laughs]

19
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,357
Meatballs?
More like you're throwing boogers.

20
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,320
Stop throwing boogers,
Mr. Pick-and-Flick.

21
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,760
-Is not a booger, and
I'm not Mr. Pick-and-Flick.

22
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,200
I'm Super Mario.

23
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,311
-SpaghettiOs?
I love SpaghettiOs! [laughs]

24
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,980
-No-no-no-no-no, it's Super Mario,
not SpaghettiO.

25
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,020
-Uh-oh.
-What do you mean, uh-oh?

26
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,296
-Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs. [laughs]

27
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,920
-[frustrated groan]
Fireball.

28
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,660
-Hey SpaghettiOs,
use a Kleenex already, geez.

29
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,611
-Well, you no-good two-bit orange.

30
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,340
-Two-bit?
I'm at least eight bits. [laughs]

31
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,720
-[groans]
Don't make me take-a my gloves off.

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,717
I can get-a real mean when I want to.

33
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,531
Just you ask my brother Luigi.

34
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,518
-Did you say linguini?

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,236
Your whole family's made of pasta.

36
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,560
You have a sister named Ravioli?
[laughs]

37
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,980
-[groans loudly] You tell me
where the princess is or else.

38
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,420
-Or else what? Shell?
-Shell?

39
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,974
What are you a-talking about,
you crazy orange?

40
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,070
-Turtle shell. [burps]

41
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,100
-Oh!

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,700
-Whoa! SpaghettiOs is bite-sized.
[laughs]

43
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,372
-Oh great, you a-shrunk me.

44
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,420
You're like a big orange Rick Moranis.

45
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,880
-Oh, don't worry, bite-size SpaghettiOs,
it could be worse.

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,380
-Could be worse?
Now I'll never find the princess.

47
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,860
How could it possibly be worse?

48
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,740
-I don't know. Bullet.

49
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,078
-What?
-Bullet.

50
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,140
-Huh?
-[Orange laughs]

51
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,858
Ohh... Super Mario.

52
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,620
More like Stupid Mario, right guys?

53
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,830
[Peach and Toad sigh]

54
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,698
I defeated Bowser and
saved you guys hours ago.

55
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,139
-Yeah, if by defeated Bowser, you mean

56
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,598
you annoyed the living crap out of
him until he just got angry and left.

57
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,950
-Whatever, Princess Apple.

58
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,980
-That's Peach, thank you very much.

59
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,900
-You're an apple. [laughs]
-[frustrated sigh]

60
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,336
-Hey, you guys are still here?

61
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,960
I told you already, get out
of my dungeon, you freeloaders.

62
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,960
