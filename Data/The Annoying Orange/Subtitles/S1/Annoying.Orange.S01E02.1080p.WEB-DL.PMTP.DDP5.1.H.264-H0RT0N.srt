-Hey, Plumpkin!
-What?

25
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,900
-Can you touch your
eyeball with your tongue?

26
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,120
-No.
-You haven't even tried it yet.

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,840
Try it! Errl...

28
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,510
-I don't want to try it.

29
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,110

-I almost got it.

32
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,430
-Orange, knock it off!

33
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,690
-You're not trying.

34
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,360
-Oh, my God, stop it!
-What?

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,570
-You know,
I'm a pretty relaxed guy most of the time,

36
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,860
and it takes a lot to get me riled,

37
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,860
but you,
you are driving me crazy,

38
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,780
and I've only been here--
what?--a minute.

39
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,280
You don't shut up!

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,320
And it's Pumpkin! Pumpkin!

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,770
Not Orange, not Plumpkin,
and I'm not your brother.

42
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,310
What? What is it?

43
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,910
Why are you mumbling
and making that face?

44
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:29,160
-Knife.
-Huh?

00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,130
[screaming]

46
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,920
-Somebody should take
that guy's knife away.

47
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,010
Right in the head.

48
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,470
Oh no, he's tearing your insides out.

Hey, Plumpkin! Hey!

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,350
Hey Plumpkin,

53
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,310
somebody carved a face on your butt.

55
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,490
Oh...
