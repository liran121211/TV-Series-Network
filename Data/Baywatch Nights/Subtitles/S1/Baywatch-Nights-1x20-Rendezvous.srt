00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,160
too specific if you don't tell us what's

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:17,250
going on we can't help you can't do that

254
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:19,230

enough what are you a priest now no but

256
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,790
there are lives that depend on my

257
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:27,929
keeping that oath you coming to us to

258
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:29,429
find this guy's personal isn't it when I

259
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:32,130
went through his file I noticed there

260
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,390
was a wife and child after the

261
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:36,690
arraignment there's no mention of them

262
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,010
there's no address no nothing does him

263
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,549
being here have anything to do with that

264
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,549
wife and child

265
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,770
yeah

266
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,170
so she didn't testify against him but

267
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:51,470
she blew the whistle testified for the

268
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,470
grand jury

269
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:58,289
and now she's in some variation of the

270
00:17:56,279 --> 00:18:00,509
witness protection program but somehow

271
00:17:58,289 --> 00:18:01,709
he found out where she is which I can

272
00:18:00,509 --> 00:18:03,029
understand how that happens because

273
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:05,599
those people are so careful unless

274
00:18:03,029 --> 00:18:05,599

00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:28,660
wants to kill her take his daughter

280
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,350
