1
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,610
In the city of Angels,

2
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,210
people drowned in the sea.

3
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:39,883
Devil

4
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,890
rain for time.

5
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,323
The

6
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:25,563
after the.

7
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,760
These are go weapons.
Don't screw 'em up. Rose.

8
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,540
Dam it. Nicky, what did I just say?

9
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,540
Sorry dude.

10
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,020
This is your first job, so you gotta
chill, man. That's real important.

11
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,400
You meditate?

12
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,373
Yeah, I'm cool.

13
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,740
All right, let's go through
this one more time. Manny.

14
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,270
Everybody's on the floor.
Get the register, cover you.

15
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,673
Nicky.

16
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,400
I stay with the car. After three
minutes I pull up to the door,

17
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,080
keep the engine running.

18
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,990
Come on, come on. What else?

19
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,693
What else?

20
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,790
Keep an eye out for cops.

21
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,710
And what's Nuro uno?

22
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,490
We're family and we stick together.

23
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,770
Oh, one more thing. Just gotta
go down quick. Boom, boom, boom.

24
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,653
Here you go.

25
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,100
Yo, chicken little. We ordered like
three Dino wings with corn feet,

26
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,339
I guess like chickens here. Can't count.

27
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,660
Let me ask you something, kid.

28
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,180
Have you always been a knucklehead or to
something you picked up along the way?

29
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,980
And have you like always been
a stupid chicken to work?

30
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,250
Have you ever stopped to think about
some of the things we do to survive?

31
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,250
Survival is primal and
we do what we have to,

32
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,930
but sometimes we cross over the line,

33
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,490
which is exactly what happened to me and
Garner when we took an undercover case

34
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:17,690
at a fast food restaurant that
had been robbed five times.

35
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,970
How's it going out there? Garner?
You really want to know? Not really.

36
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,050
I hate these cars. I hate the people
in the cars. I hate this heat.

37
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,410
Another sugar coated.

38
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,450
Ball. Tell me how you really feel.

39
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,170
I hate being in a chicken suit sweating
like a pig while you're sitting in air

40
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:32,930
conditioned.

41
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,330
Splendor. Oh yeah. Yeah.
How like it so lucky? I.

42
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:37,362
Don't

43
00:05:56,589 --> 00:06:01,279
You ready little bro? No.

44
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,880
Screw up. Sneaky. Three minutes.

45
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,560
I said I'm cool dude.

46
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,960
All right, let's do this Manning.

47
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,160
Hold on to the air
conditioning. It blew up. Oh.

48
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,760
What are you doing in here.

49
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,593
Anyway?

50
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,440
Well, I thought I'd line the
nest for a while. Maybe Lazy May.

51
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,560
Oh, when will these perps show? Oh God.

52
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,873
Everybody on the.

53
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,839
You took a little on the now.

54
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,213
Got it.

55
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:16,480
You're.

56
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,000
Hoping to say halal. I want the payroll.

57
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,720
Take Get easy marriage.
It's on time left. How long?

58
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,880
Six hours and.

59
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,040
Change now. You waiting six hours. I'm.

60
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
Telling you, man. I'm sorry. I.

61
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,913
The.

62
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,960
Freeze. Put the gun down.

63
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,680
You put your gun down, man.

64
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,280
I'll cut her. Man.

65
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,713
We both cut.

66
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,200
One. What the hell you doing?
Cops don't take hostages.

67
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,360
We're not cops.

68
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,653
You okay?

69
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,440
Leave me here, bro. I'll
figure something out.

70
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,900
You hang tight. Penny. You punks are dead.

71
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,693
Go, go, go.

72
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Are you be wearing your butt for a hat?

73
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,970
Wearing your butt for a hat.
It's colorful. Mr. Buchanan.

74
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,410
Hey. Hey, Garner. Oh no. Not Decker.
So I always wanted to ask you,

75
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,929
why the hell did you cross that road?

76
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,683
My brother gets.

77
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,443
Perfect.

78
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,150
Hey. Hi. Hello.

79
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,123
Car trouble.

80
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,710
Yeah, one of those dudes.

81
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,510
I've had those masquerade party.

82
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,429
Actually, I'm on my way home from work.

83
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,150
Really? Uh, you're a professional chicken.

84
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,320
<Laugh>? No, I'm a private investigator.
Uh, undercover job. Uh, Steakout.

85
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,083
At the coup.

86
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,953
<Laugh>.

87
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,120
Yeah. You you're funny. I like that.

88
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,080
So are you. So do I.

89
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,320
Well, you know, Birds of a fella.

90
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,693
I'm summer.

91
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,813
I'm gone.

92
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,920
I'm an attorney. Do you need one?

93
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,200
Um, well, no, but um,

94
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,160
I don't suppose you feel like picking
up a little chicken on the way home.

95
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,679
Well pop in. I just love
a man in a foul move.

96
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,480
A hundred dollars and 2 cents.

97
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,960
We nearly die of heatstroke
growing chicken suits for two days.

98
00:12:38,309 --> 00:12:43,160
I get a gun to my throat and we get
paid a hundred dollars and 2 cents.

99
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,600
The corporation that owns a franchise
says that you only caught one

100
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,480
robber, insulted numerous
customers and hurt their business.

101
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,720
We also stopped at our robbery.

102
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,000
I thought they got everything
in the cash register.

103
00:12:58,929 --> 00:12:59,762
Oh.

104
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,760
That, Well, they did not.
They didn't get the safe.

105
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,440
I thought there wasn't
anything in the safe.

106
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,160
Oh, picky, picky, picky.

107
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,800
Well, corporation says it. We're
lucky they're not gonna sue.

108
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:16,720
Sue, Sue a hundred bucks. Sue.
A great American tradition.

109
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,559
We isn't that white.

110
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,600
Michael. Uncle Jerry used to say, Leg
stinks. You lose your keys, you die.

111
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,600
But I like to think of myself as one of
those people who sees the cup as half

112
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:32,920
full. Still.

113
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:37,720
Sometimes we get dealt to bad card and
the chicken caper definitely came up A

114
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,554
deuce.

115
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,480
I don't know about this Duke. I
mean, we're talking murder, man. Hey,

116
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:06,040
I do the killing little bro. You
just cover my butt. You understand?

117
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,800
Hey, listen to me, Nicky. You
and me and Manny are family

118
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,520
and we stick together no
matter what. Yeah, I know,

119
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:20,200
but why does somebody have to die this?

120
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,440
And right now we're gonna get Manny
back and nothing else matters. Nothing.

121
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,480
You understand? I understand.

122
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,320
Childproof. I tell you what. Let's
call the kids openness thing.

123
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,680
That's a good idea.

124
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,610
There you go. Are you sick? Of what?

125
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,080
No, no, no, no, no. I got sign his
headaches. He's knocking right out.

126
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,183
Thanks Lou.

127
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,960
Oh, hey, Fell. Sorry we haven't
opened yet. We got another hour.

128
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,800
I'm looking for Mitchell
Buchanan and Garner.

129
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,320
Er b I have a job that
might be interested in.

130
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,360
Um, Mitch is patterning
his nose. I'm his partner.

00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:13,200

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,840
Oh, there he is. Mitch. This is.

All right. And I want you to call lapd.

138
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,040
I want you to say you've got a hostage
situation and I want you to tell him to

139
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,720

Flash copy.

141
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,880

Take care.

144

What are you doing here, Decker?
All I did was kiss her goodbye.

145
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,690
We just gotta call him about a host
situation. Host situation here.

146
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,410
Is that the SWAT team? Nicky?

147

Ryan. That's right
Brian. It's a nice name.

151
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,833
A.

152
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,170
Sit down. Hey.

153
00:17:44,609 --> 00:17:46,930
Easy man. Oh.

154
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:51,600
There's nothing I'm gonna like more

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,240
But that comes later now. Ryan,

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,280
That is one fine woman.

158
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,513
Hey.

159
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,609
Hey. I told you not to move Mitchell.

160
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,170
Next time I get serious.

161
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:19,330
Yeah. Mitch Mitchell can't
talk right now. He's a hostage.

162
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,530
Who the hell is this?

163
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:37,609
I'm Lieutenant Amanda Cash Hostage

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,609
Do you have some information I can use?

175
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,570
No, but I know someone who does.

176
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,250
Just what I need the queen of trash.
Stormy Walters. You let her in.

177
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,570
You'll be checking parking meters.

178
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,220
How old are you, Nick?

179
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,253
Hey. 10 18.

180
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,300
That's old enough.

181
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,192
For what?

182
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,340
Stand trial as an adult.

183
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,300
Well, it's stand a no trial man.

184
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,540
Hey kid, there's only two
ways to get outta here.

185
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,540
Handcuffs or body bag.

186
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,540
Saw the conversation about

187
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,540
shut the hell up.

188
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,763
Yeah.

189
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:40,020
This is Lieutenant Amanda Cash Hostage
Unit lapd. To whom am I speaking?

190
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,340
I ask the questions for now. You in.

191
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,173
Charge? I am.

192
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,580
I have three hostages here and they
all die unless you do what I say.

193
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:47,290
You got that.

194
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,140
Understood.

195
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,660
Since Stormy Walter's in here for an
interview, I want to go on live tv.

196
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,463
Is that it?

197
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,859
Watch Stormy. You'll see what else I need.

198
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,260
He's got three hostages.

199
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,020
Three. Did he give any names?

200
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,820
Negative. But guess who
he wants to talk to.

201
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:09,700
Here.

202
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,533
We're ready.

203
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:17,853
Hang in there. Mitch.

204
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,340
You ready to.

205
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:24,820
Here? Let's do it. Okay.

206
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,619
You're live in five seconds. 4, 3, 2.

207
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,820
This is Stormy Walter's live
from Venice Beach, California,

208
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,340
where Armed fugitive Duke Sosa has taken
three hostages and has chosen flash

209
00:22:37,341 --> 00:22:40,180
copy to issue his demands. Duke,

210
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,660
millions of flash copy
viewers await your words.

211
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,940
Most stormy. There's two things
I want. Are these people die?

212
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,200
That's Ryan, my other partner
in Lou Raymond who owns.

213
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:58,869
The club.

214
00:22:58,869 --> 00:23:01,800
Okay. Duke, what do you
want? America's waiting.

215
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:06,000
I want my brother Manny Soso
released from prison, brought here.

216
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,320
It's a million dollars in unmarked
cash and I want it two hours.

217
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,473
You want me to agree with that?

218
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,613
Not a chance.

219
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,600
Tell me a little bit
about yourself. Mr. Sosa.

220
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,623
Call me Duke.

221
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,170
Duke. What has brought you to
this critical moment in your life?

222
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:30,040
Well, I think it all started when I was
10 years old and stole my first car.

223
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,280
I had my own gun by the time I was 13.

224
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,320
And what about your parents?

225
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,160
My old man was in jail the
whole time I was growing up.

226
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,440
They're never gonna release.

227
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,280
His brother from prison.

228
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,200
I'll get his fool in million dollars.

229
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,720
Either way, anything gonna kill.

230
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,553
Us? It's tragic.

231
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,160
How old.

232
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,760
Were you? Oh, that's a
very comforting, Mitch.

233
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,040
What we gotta do is find a way outta here.

234
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,760
What we need is a miracle.

235
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,200
And your brothers.

236
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,960
I raised them myself.

237
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,600
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is an incredible story.

238
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,000
What's.

239
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,833
This stuff too?

240
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,960
Well, there's just like painkillers
that make you kind of drowning.

241
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,480
How many left? Forced to bring three
or four awful of circumstances.

242
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,400
And is now in the most difficult
struggle of his young life.

243
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,000
That should be enough. Trying
to protect your brothers.

244
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:24,560
Have you ever had any problems
with the one or two times? I

245
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,800
What do you think you'll
accomplish by? Hey.

246
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,800
You ever done any time before?

247
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,640
Nah, that chicken joint was my first job.

248
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,080
Well, hey, maybe you better think
about what's happening here, man.

249
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:40,840
Cause you know, for murder
you can get 20 years. Man.

250
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,960
The one thing you don't want
to do is wind up in the joint.

251
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,760
And there you have it, Mr. And
Mrs. America. An exclusive wallet.

252
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:50,360
It's happening.

253
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,520
Interview with Armed Fugitive Duke
Sosa holding three hostages in Venice,

254
00:24:54,521 --> 00:24:56,640
California. He threatens to kill.

255
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,863
Unless.

256
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,713
It's to mad or met.

257
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,040
You're sitting them in.

258
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:09,720
I have no choice. The situation is
non-negotiable. I have my orders.

259
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,240
Oh, come on. Give the guy what he wants.
So lies with three people that rich to.

260
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:17,520
I realize that I talk with my
superiors and the answer's no. Then.

261
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,200
Try again. You saw this guy's
rap shootings. A psycho.

262
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,200
When the queen of trash comes
out, the SWAT team goes in.

263
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,280
I'm sorry, Garner.

264
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,760
Position. I watch Door.
Don't show. We're coming.

265
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,640
Go, go, go. Keep train the door.

266
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,930
No, no. I think SWAT's about to go in.

267
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:04,763
There's no way.

268
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,730
The Hostage unit, which is pushing
us all back and quarter from Mile.

269
00:26:08,731 --> 00:26:11,570
There's nothing I can do. Hey, hey,
hey. What are you doing? Hey, what's up.

270
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,970
With you fella? Look, it's okay.
The hostages of my friends.

271
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,810
So hear me out Stormy. I have a plan
that could make you bigger than her.

272
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:19,644
Geraldo.

273
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,003
Ah,

274
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,530
it's all happened A little bro. <laugh>.

275
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,890
<laugh>. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,880
Manny's coming back and we're
gonna be Richard famous.

277
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,480
So much for that plan.

278
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,400
Net. Na Hayes wore some warm
beer. I need a cool one, Ryan.

279
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,713
Sure.

280
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,520
Boy. Ryan, I gotta tell you,
I love the way you walk.

281
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,560
We can distract this.

282
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,720
Guy. Well, he seems to be taken with Ryan.

283
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,480
Hey Nicky, come here and get a beer.

284
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,920
Maybe Ryan can get him to dance with her.

285
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,520
So Duke, is that your real name?

286
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:43,880
Yeah. Mile Man had a
thing about John Wayne.

287
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,800
Well then why isn't your name John?

288
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,480
Okay? Do you dance Duke?

289
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,520
What are you talking about?

290
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,080
Well, I mean, you might as well
pass the time somehow. Huh?

291
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:14,359
I think she likes me.
Nikki, What's matter? Duke?

292
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,353
Are you afraid of me?

293
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,480
I ain't afraid of nothing.

294
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,063
Good then.

295
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,160
Why don't you play as something.

296
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,400
I can do that.

297
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,040
Make it real slow and sexy.

298
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:50,873
I've got a room.

299
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,040
I've got a room with a view.

300
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,240
I've got a room. Um,

301
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,560
I've got a room with a view.

302
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,480
I've got a house full of

303
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,080
and a room with a view of the blue.

304
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,520
I said these walls,

305
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,840
they are closing in on me.

306
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,880
I'm talking about these walls.

307
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,320
They are closing in on me.

308
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,440
I don't have no.

309
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,920
He's singing about him himself. You know.

310
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,640
No way. I don't even have a tv.

311
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:05,743
Really?

312
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,880
He killed somebody Now listen.

313
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:13,400
Yeah. Yeah. His wife. It's 17 years.

314
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,233
Altra.

315
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:16,640
Why.

316
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,240
You? I think long and hard about
throwing rest of my life away.

317
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,680
Bed. Only room.

318
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:28,920
I have a room with a view.

319
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,480
Hey, hey, hey. And on the
first day at Big Noise, I'm.

320
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Through in,

321
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,680
I don't even see you.

322
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,303
I said,

323
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,360
I'm in a house full of and a room with a.

324
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,600
You think I'm stupid?

325
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,103
What?

326
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,400
I get anywhere near that door and
there's two SWAT snipers out there just

327
00:31:31,401 --> 00:31:32,234
waiting to pop me.

328
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

329
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,800
Yeah. Then you go stand there and
see how long it takes to be dead.

330
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:39,760
Then.

331
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,560
They would shoot me too.
I'm not a cop. I'm a pi.

332
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,160
We ain't finished dancing yet.

333
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,400
Sometimes life deals you ace.

334
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:03,200
It's one of those rare moments when
everything seems to come together at just

335
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:07,480
the right place and the right time and
it looks like the pot is all yours.

336
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,800
This wasn't one of those times.

337
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,880
Cool it, man. Yeah.

338
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,480
Duke, you're a hit. America wants to
see more of you. Are you interested?

339
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,240
Hell yes. When.

340
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:28,120
Your call, the sooner the better.

341
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,400
We don't wanna give the
advertiser sweaty palms.

342
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,040
My brother here yet, he's.

343
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,120
In route. But I think we should come in
now. We can do a family portrait later.

344
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,480
All right, let's do it. Great.

345

You really captured the heart of
America. I mean, what can I say?

00:35:29,821 --> 00:35:30,820
They're just begging for more.

00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:14,250
Don't do it. Nick. You can never
take this moment back, man.

00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:15,483
Shoot him.

00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,930
No, don't make me do it too.

00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,560
Let these other people

00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,120
You don't get him outta here. He's
gonna die. He dies. You take the fall.

398
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,520
We're talking the rest of your life,
kid. I don't wanna kill anybody.

399
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,600
Duke Randall. Go, go, go.

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,520
Me the piece. It ain't right, Duke.

402
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,840
They said they were gonna release
Manny, but it ain't gonna happen.

403
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,880
Nikki Duke is the one who lied.

404
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,840
That's what team is sitting out
there just waiting to pop us.

405
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:27,239
Unless we show him we're
calling the shots. Shoot him.

406
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,920
You still got a life kid.
You still got a life.

407
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:38,560
What kind of life? There's
nothing there, man. Nothing.

408
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:41,960
Not a thing. Shoot him.

409
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,320
I ain't shooting nobody, Duke.

410
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,873
Ah,

411
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,550
I'm sorry man. I'm sorry. You scared me

412
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:38,500
on Big Daddy. Oh.

413
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,739
Yeah. Now I know how
I move when I get old.

414
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,260
Imagine how I feel. I've been moving
like this for many years, man.

415
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,260
Crying. The wars over. We're here.

416
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,260
You sure was nice riding to Maker's
lunch. I didn't know if she could cook.

417
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,980
Yeah. Well you ever tasted her
coffee? What do you mean? Ah.

418
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,253
Might assume it's revenge.

419
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,380
Hello gentlemen. I hope you're hungry.

420
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,460
Hell, after two days of hospital
food, home cooking sounds great.

421
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,180
<Laugh>, after two days of listening
to you snore sleeping. Sounds great.

422
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,060
Well, at least I don't sing in my sleep.

423
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,300
How did you two end up
on the same room anyway?

424
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,460
A trick of faith. <laugh>.

425
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,683
Well.

426
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:21,940
I hope you like it.

427
00:41:27,469 --> 00:41:29,190
Compliments of California roasters.

428
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,263
<Laugh>.

429
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:34,360
Mr.

430
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,193
Buchanan.

431
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:01,520
It can blow dreams. There's a,
