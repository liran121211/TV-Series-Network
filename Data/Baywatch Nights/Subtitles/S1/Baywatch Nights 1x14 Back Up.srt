unusual about the blood workup a blood

256
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,089
workup hasn't come back in did you treat

257
00:16:02,089 --> 00:16:04,390
this like a accident or a murder

258
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,459
accident most drownings are would you

259
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,110
have treated anything differently if

260
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,220
they had said it was a murder

261
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,940
come on McBride 27 bodies come in here

262
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,430

that's exactly what I think

271
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,829
it was a murder based on what based on

272
00:16:45,829 --> 00:16:46,880
the fact that the man was already

273
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,089

on the hip man to call how you doing

296
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:25,950
well you're drowning is very suspicious

297
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,419
there's no trauma to his hands his legs

298
00:18:28,419 --> 00:18:29,230
or his feet

299
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,820
Brian people don't drive without a

300
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,769
struggle they kick and fight yeah that's

301
00:18:32,769 --> 00:18:34,929
right but from the contents of his lungs

302
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:36,700
he did drown and he did drown in the

303
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,830
ocean there's no alcohol there's no

304
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,690
drugs except for insulin but that's cuz

305
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,059
he was a diabetic now the complete blood

306
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,859
workup won't be ready until tomorrow so

307
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,389
I'm having them run tests on the liquid

308
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:49,210
from his lungs looking for carbon

309
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,859
residue if there's no carbon residue

310
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,090
from the smoke then that would mean that

311
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,739
he was dead before the fire started

312
00:18:53,739 --> 00:18:56,379
which explains why Eddie didn't see him

313
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,210
and he wasn't looking for a dead guy

314
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,359

479
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,250

480
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,460

the man's a very determined item you

485
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,480
wouldn't buy off and I don't think we

486
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,960
scared him off I overheard him say that

487
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,540
he was gonna dive on the wreck and my

488
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,820
guess is he's still gonna do it

489
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,030
well then we'll stop him this is getting

490
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:06,630
totally out of hand well whose fault is

491
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,020
that

492
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,900
you know marty was your problem from the

493
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,240
beginning you married him you make him

494
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,040
crazy you drive him to a divorce and

495
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,110
then you tick him off so bad he won't

496
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,780
settle with you I told you that a

497
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,640
contested divorce would ruin us

498
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,320
but you didn't listen to me he'd never

499
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,020
listen to me the courts open up the

500
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,700
company books and in two seconds they

501
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,020
can prove we've been skimming for the

502
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,170
last seven years I offered him money too

503
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,670
late and too little

504
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,110
you thought marty was such a pushover

505
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:36,060
god you're the one I should have left

506
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,690

516
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,890
hundred yards suffer since women

517
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,490
all right here's what I think it

518
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,380
happened way from the brother on the

519
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,780
process of killing Marty they ripped out

520
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,730
the water cooling lines floods a boat

521
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,480
the open a fuel line issued a flare into

522
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,860
the engine compartment which starts a

523
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,670
fire burning up all the evidence now

524
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:58,930
everything is working perfectly then

525
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,340
Eddie happens to come along

526
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,780
they should have panicked but didn't I

527
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,010
know instead they stuffed Marty in the

528
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,070
seat Locker and they tie a bobber into

529
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,630
the latch the boat sinks the water rises

530
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,220
the latch comes loose the bobber lifts

531
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,600
up the cover on the seat Locker and out

532
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,500
floats Marty

533
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,780
well can we prove it Ryan well it'll

534
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,890
need more than that but it's enough to

535
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,270
get Eddie off the hook and that's pretty

536
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,130
much all we care about well let the cops

537
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,960
worry about the rest all right let's get

538
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,580
