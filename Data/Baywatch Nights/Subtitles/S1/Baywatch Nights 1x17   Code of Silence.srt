In the city. Ofs under of night.

Well you're not giving me a lot. Three
Asian men in a black Lincoln town car.

00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:30,570
I think they were pros. Did
they leave her on purpose?

39
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,529
No. No, No. They wanted her too.

40
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,890
Have you seen the woman or child out here.

41
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,089

Oh, we found this coat by
the phone to look familiar.

58
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,630
Her mother had it around her shoulders.

59
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,310
She's got some white powder on it.

60
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:43,710
It.

61
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,543
Looks like talum.

62
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,029
No, it's uh, it's corr.
It's grainier than Tal.

63
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,110
You wanna ride with me? All.

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:07,690
Hey.

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:08,523
Lou. Raymond.

70
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,433
Hi babe.

71
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,750
You look great Lou.

72
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,670
Well thanks. So do you. Thanks.

73
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,510
Hey, what brings you back to Malibu?

74
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,150
Well, I got a gig in
Santa Monica tonight. See?

75
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,070
So I thought I'd stop by
and see what's going on.

76
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,110
Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Gonna get you.

77
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,830
Something. Cup of coffee. Be fine.

78
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,763
You got it?

79
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,463
Cool.

80
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,550
But this is no joke. Is it Lou?

81
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,190
Yeah. Wish it was.

82
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,230
But how do they keep getting away with it?

83
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:41,750
Well, you see money talks.
They're from rich families,

84
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,030
so they got nothing but
time on their hands.

85
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,350
So they get their kicks by trashing bars.

86
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,750
That's not the worst of it.

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,150
They're coming here when?

88
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,150
Well, my friend says today.

89
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,110
Your friend. How does
your friend know this?

90
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,950
I can't tell you that, babe.

91
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,790
Okay, but he's reliable, right?

92
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,190
Yeah, he's reliable.

93
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,590
So Lou says the source is reliable.

94
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,950
Says he is the best.

95
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,540
Hey guys.

96
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,150

98
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,790
Griff. Hey Griff.

99
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,230

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,990
Man. It is. What's going on?

00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,950
Oh yeah, Can help.

102
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,790
There's a trio of want to be tough,
rich kids going around trashing bars.

103
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,750
Looks like nights may be next on my list.

104
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,430
Oh, when do they think
this is gonna happen?

105
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,350
Today or tonight? What.

106
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,070
Do you guys call the.

107
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,350
Cops? No, no, no.

108
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:33,790
What I don't need is for nights to
get a reputation is a trouble spot.

109
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,350
Yeah, I'm sure we'll handle this
little problem. Uh, you house.

Where's the child?

112
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,260
The mother was on the phone.
There's too many people.

113
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,740
We have to leave the child.

114
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,140
Take her to some.

115
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:38,530
It's okay. It's okay
honey. Come on. Come on.

116

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,713
Hi. What can we do?

128
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,000
Well we can see if we can help
locate the mother. I mean,

129
00:10:57,001 --> 00:11:01,929

besides finding missing
people is one of the things

130
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,763

131
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,850
You know why I like you?

132
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,970

00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,250
Three.

137
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,410
Knuckle. Yeah.

138
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,170
They don't look so tough. Rack them
up. Just little. Thank you sir.

00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,610
Live Minnesota fence. Action. Here we

Hi guys. Mind if I join you?

144
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,813
Not at all.

145
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,720
So are you having a good time?

146
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,320
It's better now that you're here.

147
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,640
No, I heard a vicious rumor.

148
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,703
Really?

149
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,960
But some guys are going around bashing
bars and generally acting like idiots.

150
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,120
We heard about those guys.

151
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,400
Well, it's not gonna happen here.

152
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,253
Why not?

153
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,080
Okay, just why don't you,
you know, just relax. Huh?

154
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,800
Who the hell are you?

Jack. Jack.

159
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,040
Why don't we settle this peacefully
with a game of pool? You win.

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:50,520
You can stay drinks on me, You lose, you.

Ball. Corner pocket.

170
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,080
Man. I've been hustled
before, but what a ride.

171
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,433

This is Detective Harrison.

177
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,240
Yeah, Detective, what's up?

178
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:19,440
Do you have that little
girl? Because if you do.

179
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,480
No, I don't have her. You're telling
me you lost her. How could that happen?

180
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,000
This isn't a jail. No one picked
her as a runner. She makes contact.

181
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,320
Let me know immediately. Okay?

182
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,173
You do the same.

183
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,480
Maco took off. I'm gonna go look for her.

184
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,040
You want some company?

185
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,360
No, no. Just stay here in case she calls.

186
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,160
Okay? Thanks.

187
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,960
Have you found a child?

188
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,680
Not yet. What? Have your
progress Master smile.

189
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,600
More difficult than I
had thought. One thing,

190
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,530
we must not have another incident.
Like what happened at the beach?

191
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,090
That was your plan. Not ours.

192
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,180
Now you'll listen. Na, you
are sent here to work for.

193
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,860
Me. I will sit here from Japan
to work, but not for you.

194
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,540
I work for the men in
Tokyo or at the moment,

195
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,780
not pleased with the
decisions you are making. I.

196
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,900
Will this operation from nothing.

197
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,860
Some people say you are slipping.

198
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,020
How dare.

199
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,380
You? This whole tobacco,

200
00:16:41,381 --> 00:16:45,740
starting with the murder is
your doing The computer disc,

201
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:48,060
her lover is stole. Could
bring us all to our knees.

202
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,060
It has all the number codes to
bank accounts, deposits, payments.

203
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,420
Every illegal transaction is on that disc.

204
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,180
I'm aware of its importance.

205
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,340
Things got just a little out of hand.

206
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,500
Maybe it's you who are out of hand.

207
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,140
How are you feeling? Heroku.

208
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,740
Your daughter has run
away from the police.

209
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,260
Then you do not know where she is.

210
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,460
She will be found. We're not criminals.

211
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,300
What do you call kidnapping?

212
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,533
Necessity.

213
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,220
The disc you hold could ruin us all.

214
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,220
You have my word that you and your
daughter will be sent to Japan where

215
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:45,940
you'll be well cared for.
You've only to give me the disc.

216
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,560
When I know my daughter is
safe in Nagoya with Father.

217
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,160
Then you will get the disc.

218
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,880
I did not come here to waste time.

219
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,730
The beauty of this instrument is that
it causes great agony, even death,

220
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:10,770
but leaves no marks.

221
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,890
I am not afraid to die.

222
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:18,530
My guests are waiting.
By all means, join them.

223
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,290
Excuse.

224
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,130
Me. I'm trying to find

225
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,890
mother. Why?

226
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,813
Yes?

227
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:53,160
Tell me you have the child.

228
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,280
No, Mr. Summa. I am still looking.

229
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,990
Report to me tomorrow.

230
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:01,773
I will be there.

231
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:10,109
Hey, come here

232
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,630
man. You wanna make some
money? Seen this girl?

233
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,040
Yeah. Want you to look around,

234
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:29,570
See what you can find out for me.
Hey, call me at this number. Got.

235
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:55,290
Hey. Hey. Uh, she's
gone. I mean she is gone.

236
00:21:55,291 --> 00:21:58,050
I looked all over Little
Tokyo. No sign of her.

237
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,490
Up early. Hum Mitch.

238
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,170
Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. I thought of
that little girl out in those streets.

239
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:06,890
You know, if this was a ransom kidnapping,

240
00:22:06,891 --> 00:22:08,690
we would have a note
demanding money from someone.

241
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,930
Right? What? Who?

242
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:14,850
If it's not Rico's mother could be dead.

243
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,170
You know, I got one piece
of information to move on.

244
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,930
Do you remember the powder
on the mother's coat?

245
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,753
Yeah.

246
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,010
The detective said that it
wast, but I didn't think so.

247
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,810
So I snuck a sample to check it out.

248
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:30,690
It turns out it was a heavy rice
powder that only Japanese geisha use.

249
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,369
Japanese cas. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Uh,

250
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,530
I'm right back.

251
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,810
Good morning. Um, well I know you.

252
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,210
I wasn't sure it was you Mr. Buchanan.

253
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,450
I am Captain King Nara
Imperial Japanese Navy retired.

254
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,810
Mari is my granddaughter and
her mother is my daughter.

255
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,770
I went to the police.

256
00:23:03,109 --> 00:23:06,770
But they tell me Marco is gone
and no one knows where she is.

257
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,450
Now I have come to ask for your help.

258
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,770
I saw your picture in the newspaper.

259
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:20,530
You saved my granddaughter. And
because you are a private detective,

260
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,890
you and I might have a
better chance than the.

261
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,670
Polices naka here. What can you tell us
that will help us find your daughter?

262
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:35,240
Huh? In Nagoya, My daughter
was a geisha for many years,

263
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:38,480
but when her husband
died, she came to America.

264
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:39,880
To work as a geisha.

265
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,560
Yes. Unfortunately, I do not know where,

266
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,720
I did not approve of her live Japan.

267
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,920
And we have not spoken
much since until yesterday.

268
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,960
Why? What happened?

269
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,080
She called very upset,

270
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:59,160
told me she was in trouble and
afraid for her and medical's lives.

271
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,000
Did she say why?

272
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,680
Only that she had
something somebody wanted.

273
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,359
Did she say what?

274
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,200
No, but she was frightened
and she disconnected.

275
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,320
Does your granddaughter speak
English? Mr. Nacara? Hi.

276
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,760
Very good English talk in a school class.

277
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,880
She wouldn't talk to anyone. I mean
she wouldn't even say her name.

278
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,920
It can only mean she has
pledged a code of silence.

279
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:36,330
Code of silence. Why?

280
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,780
To honor her mother's wishes.

281
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,623
Yeah.

282
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,493
Hey.

283
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,600
Yeah. It's me. Okay, listen. I talked
to the people at the Japanese Museum,

284
00:25:24,601 --> 00:25:27,520
Museum and they said they don't know
of any local Japanese restaurant,

285
00:25:27,521 --> 00:25:30,520
nightclub, anything that's got
geisha as part of its scene.

286
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,560
It's not our day.

287
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,160
Yeah, but I do have some good news.

288
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,600
Please. I need some.

289
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,760
Well, I started thinking about the
costumes. So I checked them out.

290
00:25:37,761 --> 00:25:40,440
I got a long list of people who
make the GE costumes itself.

291
00:25:40,441 --> 00:25:41,760
But then I started thinking about the wig.

292
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:45,960
You know that black shiny pompadour
thing with the ivory come in it? Yeah.

293
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,160
Right. Well, there's only one lady in
LA who makes the repairs then. Yeah,

294
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:53,280
her name is Lily and she's
at 9 1 1 Spring Street.

295
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:54,692
I'm there now.

296
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,000

297
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,993
Gotta leave.

298
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,533
Can I help you?

299
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:31,980
Hi, uh, my name is Ryan McBride.
I'm a private investigator.

300
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:37,740
I'm looking for this little girl. Her
name is Maria Nacara. I was wondering,

301
00:26:37,741 --> 00:26:38,574
have you seen her?

302
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,540

Uh, no, no, no. I, I'll
get it. Okay, I'll see.

314
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,920
You are very brave. But
the odds are hopeless.

315
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:55,800
You'll get yourself and the
people you are trying to save.

316
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,783
Killed.

317
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,253

Mr. Nu. Here, stay here.
Oh, look, I must help.

319
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:25,230
You can help me if you stay here.

320
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,093
I dunno.

321
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,873
Look over

322
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,573
you. All right,

323
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,080
Ryan, Mom.

324
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,760
Mitch. There are three of them.
They're armed and they've got.

325
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,040
Marico. No, no, we got her. She's
okay. Time to come on the cops. No.

326
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,800
No. When.

327
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
They see the police, they
will kill my daughter.

328
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,440
Please Mitch. Don't
let them kill my mommy.

329
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,160
No, no, no. It's not gonna
happen. I promise. Okay.

330
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,880
Really? Is there any place that you know
of in Los Angeles where Geisha actually

331
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:32,560
performed? Hi. At the private
compound of Manoa. Samora. Come.

332
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,553
On.

333
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,440
Here you go Don. How is it? Good.

334
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,880
Vi You remember my man Scott Mooto works
in the Asian investigation section in

335
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:56,743
lapd?

336
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,583
Yeah. What's.

337
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,600
Up? Well it seems they've had their
eye on spiral industries for quite a.

338
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,553
While. Oh, before.

339
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,240
Couple of months ago, one of
their executives was murdered.

340
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:06,080
The case is still open. But
here's what's interesting.

341
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:09,640
They have lots of business parties
and at those parties there are.

342
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,480
Geisha girls.

343
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,440
You bet more or less young women dressed
as geishas who speak fluent Japanese.

344
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,480
Some born in the us some born in Japan.

345
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,480
Does this sound like applies
that hero might work? It.

346
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,560
Is possible, yeah. Why would
somebody kid a geisha girl?

347
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,640
I don't know.

348
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,240
But what could your daughter have that
these guys want badly enough to kill for?

349
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,063
I don't know.

350
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,400
Well, guess what folks? There's more.

351
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,280
Hey, this is the guy
that grabbed Mario today.

352
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,213
Who is he.

353
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:42,640
Name? Odeo business executive. Uh, part
suspected shooter for the Japanese.

354
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,080
Za. Can Ryan's positive
Id get us a search.

355
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,200
Warrant. Oh yeah. In fact, we even have
the address to some our industries.

356
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,553
How long for the warrant?

357
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,600
Three, four hours.

358
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,040
Oh, we cannot wait. No, we're not gonna
wait. Ryan, would you? Yeah, let's.

359
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,390
I'm not a violent man. Hero.

360
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:21,190
Go. Please.

361
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,550
Don't make me do this.

362
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,290
Where is the girl? Any luck?

363
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,393
Step aside.

364
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,690
Last chance.

365
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,790
Where's the disc?

366
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,940
I would've given the disc to tomorrow,

367
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,140
but never to You.

368
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,000
Have the plane ready in two hours.
Any covering flight plan filed?

369
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,160
If there are any problems,
call me immediately. Ato,

370
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,840
The van has left. His
body will never be found.

371
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:41,239
He had a long life and a brilliant career.

372
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,360
Just the end was a little sloppy.

373
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,180
Somewhere in here is one bullet

374
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,860
the blood of a summer. I
may run through your veins,

375
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,300
but you have the mind of a pe.

376
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,180
How long can you hold
your breath? Long enough?

377
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,693
Thank

378
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,520
hero. Hero.

379
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:31,322
It's okay.

380
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,683
It's alright.

381
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,060
Ma Rico safe. He don't.

382
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,820
He don't. Go guys over. Father, are you.

383
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,340
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

384
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,940
Thank you for being so kind to my dad.

385
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:58,683
It's okay.

386
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,300
Rich song. Hey, these are for you.

387
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,860
Is this the souls of the Samurai?

388
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,340
Kenji? I'm honored, but I I
can't accept this gift is too.

389
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,180
Much. Oh, it is not a gift. The
souls of the I'll never given,

390
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,523
only earned.

391
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,060
You have demonstrated the heart
of a true Japanese warrior.

392
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,860
Take them and continue
to bring them. Honor.

393
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,813
Welcome.

394
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:42,060
It is time for us to leave. Where is Mari?
Oh, I will get her. No, no, no. Just,

395
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:42,739
just a minute.

396
00:40:42,739 --> 00:40:43,572
Let

397
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,993
Oh you.

398
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,920
Hey. I got a present for you,

399
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,543
uh,

400
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:30,469
from me to you. Remember the
first time we met the Seago?

401
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:36,960
It's for you. Thanks Mitch. I love you.

402
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,780
I love you too.

403
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,180
Can blow your dreams. There's a

404
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,060
in the, the,

405
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,100
you can.
