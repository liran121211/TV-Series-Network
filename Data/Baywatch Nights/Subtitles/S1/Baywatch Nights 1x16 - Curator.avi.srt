drowning victim okay Chris be the victim

172
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,970
help al Donna what's the procedure

173
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,710
approached the victim heads up so he can

174
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,500
see me offering the can tell him to take

175
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,620
the can what if he doesn't take it then

176
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,839
leave the can and leave the victim

177
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:38,450
that's exactly right

178
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,010
see if Donna had tried to fight him they

179
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,149
could have gone down they both would

180
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:44,520

Garth had only taken his Prozac yeah

203
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,820
listen to this it was an unusual Alpers

204
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,500
caused by the failure to take prescribed

205
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,480
medication highly unlikely to occur

206
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,110
again quote unquote well he's in jail

207
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:29,089

that he'd take his medicine and nothing
