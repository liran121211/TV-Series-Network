1
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,183
In the city,

2
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,310
drown in the sea.

3
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,983
Devil.

4
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,030
Rain for time.

5
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,143
After the.

6
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:31,180
Okay. Whoa, Ill dignified.

7
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,100
Oh, baby. What's it mean? Turmoil. See,

8
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:40,860
this is the hang man. Dishonesty.
Some, uh, lies have been told.

9
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,300
Hey, this is all mumbo
jumbles at the beach. Okay.

10
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,980
I'm not all that superstitious.
I'll walk under ladders.

11
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,840
Black cats don't freak me out. But
last night there was a full moon.

12
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,760
It's my opinion that if bad
things are gonna happen,

13
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,880
they're gonna happen during a full moon.

14
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,960
I broke my leg skiing during
a full moon. My wife Gail,

15
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,720
filed for divorce during a
full moon. Ah, the memories

16
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,320
a full moon. And our client, Mrs.
Vander, Kellen wanted to Noah,

17
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,120
her husband was being a wayward boy.

18
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,080
The old playing her with wine routine.

19
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,513
Okay.

20
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,320
<Laugh>. Wow. What's he doing?

21
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,953
Warm enough?

22
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,200
Here comes the.

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,233
Pitch.

24
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,170
What, what.

25
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,650
Range? Rota. But that's one big rock.

26
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,130
Uhhuh. Huh?

27
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,650
See a tower big with three,

28
00:04:15,651 --> 00:04:17,490
three peaks empty.

29
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,210
A chimney at my house. It's
incredible. How'd you know?

30
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,230
Well,

31
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,890
the tower card and the
chariot card has one to three

32
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:31,450
easy little peaks. Cosmic combo.

33
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,203
I'm.

34
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,730
Okay. We gotta hear what
old bad boy Burt saying.

35
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:54,970
So how do we get this over there?

36
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,050
Yeah. Getting ready to fetch. Boy.

37
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,650
<Laugh>. All alright. Come on.

38
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,003
Right.

39
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,930
Ah, excuse me. Excuse me.
Oh, excuse me. I'm so sorry.

40
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:19,770
We're not very good at this. I'm
sorry. Excuse me. Go ahead. Excuse me.

41
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,410
Wow. Victoria, that is a beautiful ring.

42
00:05:30,411 --> 00:05:32,890
Thank you very Watch Destiny. Wow.

43
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,010
Let's see. Ace of Cups, the lover's card.

44
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,570
I see a new man in.

45
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,050
Your life. A handsome la Ladia.
Hope deity. Oh, to die for

46
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,400
Uhoh.

47
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,150
Your Or just hiccuped
something wrong. Well.

48
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,230
I cannot shake the feeling
something bad's gonna happen.

49
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,100
Yeah.

50
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,960
I can feel that. You know what? You
should go see my friend Mitch Buchanan.

51
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,000
He's a private investigator. He
could quiet your karma. Thanks.

52
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,480
Oh, baby, I just love this necklace.

53
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,440
You mean the looks so beautiful.

54
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,353
Good contact.

55
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,993
Oh, baby.

56
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,120
A hang man.

57
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,339
And the 10 of swords.

58
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:29,820
What?

59
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,700
It's bad news.

60
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,760
Death. Someone close to you.

61
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,680
Excuse me. Would I find
a Buchanan? Upstairs?

62
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,400
Actually, you find him right here.
A Mitch, What can I do for you?

63
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,560
Well, um.

64
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,360
It's a little embarrassing.

65
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,480
Get outta.

66
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,313
Here.

67
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,563
For me.

68
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,110
You shouldn't have.

69
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,313
Oh baby.

70
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,080
For you we're private. Invest. You're, uh.

71
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
What? I Yes, wife.

72
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:26,040
Yeah, Mom, about you were cheating
on her and stealing her jewelry.

73
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:27,760
Nice necklace.

74
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,240
Taping.

75
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:31,430
This.

76
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,410
Well, you've been a very bad Ooh
baby. That is your name, isn't it?

77
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,803
Why?

78
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,763
Yeah.

79
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,313
I.

80
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,770
Time out. Huh? Time out.

81
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,930
Okay, time in.

82
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,720
How much does he want for this?

83
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,320
Hundred bucks.

84
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,760
Do you think it's.

85
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,593
Worth it?

86
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,440
I don't know in bad shape.

87
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,040
Why don't you buy a car? I.

88
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,320
Don't wanna drive. Mitch.

89
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,800
Like harmony.

90
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,633
With nature.

91
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Carbon.

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,720
Monoxide makes Mother earth cough.

93
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
Bugs are four. Hey. Yeah.

94
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,600
What happened to my friend Victoria?

95
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:52,640
I told her, wait, but soon as I
got back she was gone. She split.

96
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,773
Huh?

97
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,383
Um.

98
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,590
Tell me, hang on, tell me. Hang on.

99
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,270
Grab my, come on, come on.

100
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,550
That's come on.

101
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,503
Frigo kid.

102
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,543
They're live and.

103
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,150
Hey, hey.

104
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,230
We have yet to get any
official sheriff's department.

105
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,470
What's the deal? She's okay.

106
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:57,910
Crew.

107
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:01,110
Bug you. Pardon? Crew right's.
A vegetable. That's old.

108
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,750
Crap. Eck crew is an offwhite
color a stately. Powerful.

109
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:06,860
Yet.

110
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:07,750
Graceful color.

111
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,070
Stately. Powerful. Yeah.
Yeah. Grace. Graceful.

112
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,350
It's a good professional
color. Don't you think? It's.

113
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,950
So female.

114
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,110
Sorry. I went with my instincts. What
would be a good male color? Blue.

115
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,870
Black.

116
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,350
Black and blue. Great.

117
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,030
Our office will look
like a furnished bruise.

118
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,830
Er was named a client friendly color
and nine out of 10 designer oriented

119
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:32,664
surveys.

120
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,390
Nine outta.

121
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,223
10.

122
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,423
Black and blue.

123
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,160
The nightmare.

124
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,670
Exactly. You like that.

125
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:42,830
Group in a salad? It's like Aveta
myth, which just happened on my bike.

126
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:47,190
You know, it was just like cart's
nightmare. And the forest of the screams.

127
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,110
Remember?

128
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,943
Uhuh.

129
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,463
Uhuh. Well.

130
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,590
He saw the world through the
eyes of the predator, right?

131
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:54,340
Excuse me.

132
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,309
That's what I did.

133
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:56,860
Story.

134
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,390
I don't know.

135
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,590
Heidi, what do you have in the.

136
00:10:58,710 --> 00:10:59,309
Face? Death. The.

137
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:02,150
Body was discovered by a
jogger just a short time ago.

138
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:05,910
The coroner's office has initially listed
the cause of death as strangulation.

139
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,043
The victim,

140
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,630
Victoria Magruder had recently moved to
the Venice Beach area from her Native

141
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,220
Scotland.

142
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,990
I saw her strangled through his eyes.

143
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:15,429
You saw who strang.

144
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,429
Her? The princess of the shining flame.
Remember that, right? Had I sent you.

145
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:19,990
Yesterday?

146
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,110
Yeah. Well, I read her TA cards and,

147
00:11:22,309 --> 00:11:24,870
and she got the Ace of Cups and
the Lovers card, and I told her,

148
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,350
You're gonna meet a man to die for.

149
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,270
Guess.

150
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,103
It was right.

151
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,630
Destiny says she saw the
lady from Scotland strangled.

152
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:47,230
She wasn't physically there.
She was psychically there. Okay.

153
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,670
It's weird, but who knows? I mean, there
are some things we just can't explain.

154
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,120
Hope we got an a, a in algebra.
Nobody can explain that. Anyway,

155
00:11:56,121 --> 00:11:58,440
I was headed for the coroner's
office and they were.

156
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,559
Re chasing the roots. Why.

157
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,200
Goi? Oh, come on. Tell me.
You know about Gari? Well.

158
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,033
Sure.

159
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,080
Gari, uh, a nice color shade darker than.

160
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,640
He's on a color. He was a killer.
Direct was a guy back in Vermont,

161
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,030
killed a full 10 year
old girl in the forties.

162
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,840
Her best friend saw the whole
thing. So intense for mine.

163
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:30,280
Totally blocked it out. So you're like
20 years uhhuh. 20 years to recall it.

164
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,953
For press memory.

165
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,793
Sally, just your.

166
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,240
Rafael, Sally, Jesse
had repressed, remember?

167
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,480
No.

168
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,400
She did a show about people.

169
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,320
Who did? I didn't see.

170
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,760
That one. I have it on tape. Oh my God.
Why did I leave New York? All right,

171
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:45,110
listen, this woman, you write her
terra cards a lot of times, right? Huh?

172
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,750
All right. She told you a lot
of things about her life. Yeah.

173
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,590
She told me about Scotland and she told
me about her grandmother's diamond ring.

174
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,950
Oh, um, he took it, by the way. Killer.

175
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,003
There.

176
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:09,330
Well, there's your Scotland,

177
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,330
your princess with a
diamond on top of her head.

178
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,640
Your romance to die
for and your strangler.

179
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,210
The hangman's news.

180
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,429
What, what are you saying? The destiny
bottled up her memories about this woman.

181
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,390
Then the cork popped and she
imagines she saw a strangle.

182
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,910
If the metaphor fits, wear it.

183
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:47,190
Because she's your mom. That's why hoby,

184
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,870
it won't kill you. Now, don't,
don't, don't, don't do that. Ow.

185
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,070
Call waiting is not a
good thing. By the way,

186
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,750
Destiny was right about the diamond ring.

187
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,550
Speculation. No.

188
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,390
No, no. I talked to the corner
and they found marks on a ring.

189
00:14:04,391 --> 00:14:07,910
Finger marks could have been
made by a ring being yanked. Oh.

190
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,190
Could have, could have been nicked
slicing carrots. Look, Mitch,

191
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:15,550
I like destiny. It's hard not to,

192
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,910
but you gotta admit the girl
is a little sp at at times.

193
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,790
She's harmless.

194
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,150
You got the hots for her.

195
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,750
Hey, <laugh>. But you got a bigger
name on the other line. Ooh,

196
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,183
Kelsey. Huh?

197
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,383
Well, look who's here.

198
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,910
Who baby? What do you want?

199
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,910
I just wanted you to know that
since you medaled in my life,

200
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:51,070
the former miss is wonderful
is throw me out of the house,

201
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,200
cut off my allowance and
filed for divorce. Well,

202
00:14:55,201 --> 00:14:59,000
you were a bad boy cooking. Yeah.
Well, don't be surprised if I get.

203
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:07,910
Money.

204
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,410
You see any money? The, uh, lottery edit.

205
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,370
I see loneliness.

206
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,650
Me. Wrong guy. Never lonely.

207
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,410
I've got the job of my
dreams. I've got my cat.

208
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:26,210
I've got cable. Okay. A little bit.

209
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,650
Ooh. But I also see.

210
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,483
A new love life.

211
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,130
Oh, terrific. Uh, try to
see, we about five, seven,

212
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,410
that short little haircut and,
uh, whole eggs <laugh>. Yeah.

213
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,153
What's the matter.

214
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,130
Burner? Do you believe.

215
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,210
Me? What about her?

216
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,410
No. Uh, about the murder I saw.

217
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,530
Well, I know. I figure,
uh, if I believe one,

218
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,010
I gotta believe the
other in, you know what?

219
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,650
I sure could use a new love life.

220
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,170
No. No.

221
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,210
What what is it? Don't,

222
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,250
She's saying something
again, Mitch. Whatever it is,

223
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,130
it's scaring the hell out of.

224
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,890
What? Talk to me. What do you see?

225
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,810
It's the man, the king of Why? Who's that?

226
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,410
I read a serial card. No, negative.

227
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,290
He's a really bad danger. Where is he?

228
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:30,330
I see water and canal and breaches.

229
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,570
That's Venice Beach. Come on. Come
on, come on. Let's go. Come on now.

230
00:16:33,571 --> 00:16:35,210
Keep talking. Just describe it. It's.

231
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,490
Okay. It's a house, like a, like kids,
like gle, like a gingerbread house.

232
00:16:39,491 --> 00:16:43,610
And it has melty windows and,
and a tower with three feet. I.

233
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,443
Think I know the house.

234
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,210
I don't know. I don't.

235
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,850
It's okay. Look at me. Look at me. I
promise you nothing will happen to you.

236
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:50,970
Now. Come on. Come on.

237
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,450
In. Let's go. Let's.

238
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,013
It's.

239
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,340
I don't want to, I know
he's in there. It's.

240
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,900
The glass door. Call the paramedics.

241
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,859
He's not breathing. Yeah. How many of
the paramedics at 4 0 1 Dell Street,

242
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,693
please.

243
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,813
3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5.

244
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:07,973
1, 2, 3, 4.

245
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,653
I'll check.

246
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:13,900
Would've.

247
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,859
Been our first anniversary
come November 8th or ninth.

248
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,940
But I get confused.

249
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:21,940
Tony was my fourth husband.

250
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,060
He was my stepfather.

251
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,180
I'm li ad I I tried to fight the
guy off, but, but he was huge.

252
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,380
You're strong. He was
choking me big time and I,

253
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,020
I couldn't breathe. Why do you think
he broke in, sir? I don't know. Maybe.

254
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,460
Maybe. He thought we had money
in the house or something. Uhhuh.

255
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:44,540
And I see through the killer's
eyes. What do you mean, man?

256
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,940
I saw him strangled.

257
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,813
Could we finish this letter?

258
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,340
Sure. Thanks.

259
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,820
I don't wanna do it. Watch it ever again.

260
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,940
Don't ask me. Okay.

261
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:06,692
It's over, huh?

262
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,619
The Muscle Beach type. You know,
tattoo ponytail, the gnarly beard.

263
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:21,780
Hi, Destiny. I guess you were right.

264
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,740
Someone close to me did die.

265
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:49,400
Looking for you.

266
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:50,220
Hi.

267
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,053
You okay?

268
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,310
Yeah. Just, uh, spring
cleaning my aura. You know,

269
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,950
I've been thinking a lot
about what Lion said.

270
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,750
Yeah, me too.

271
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,413
I mean,

272
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:06,670
storing away memories of people then
letting my imagination trick me.

273
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,710
It's weird, but I guess it could happen.

274
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,590
What I don't get is how did I know there
was gonna be a murder before there was

275
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:15,424
a murder?

276
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,470
Destiny heard about these
tests. They do in Russia.

277
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,350
I put one person in one room and
another person in another room.

278
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,910
One person can tell with
the other person is doing.

279
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,109
Saying and thinking. It's called.

280
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,270
Uh, Empathics.

281
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,970
Right? Empathics. You
can do that, can't you?

282
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,810
Destiny? That's a gift.

283
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,090
Like a curse. It's just so
confusing. You know? I just,

284
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,570
I've decided to keep my
brain empty of all Fox.

285
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,290
Well, if anyone can do that, you can.

286
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,153
A cup of coffee.

287
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,280
She's.

288
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,560
So scared. She won't read cards anymore.

289
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:31,240
Well, then she can read the
bumps on people's heads.

290
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,800
You're not got an idea. I don't
think I want to hear it. I.

291
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,840
Think we should hire Destiny.

292
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:41,160
I knew I didn't want to hear
it. No, I'm not kidding.

293
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,680
Her. No. She figured out the files.
She exercised the phone system. She.

294
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,560
Can cook. Which tofu isn't
food. It's a fungus mean.

295
00:24:50,561 --> 00:24:54,119
Come on. I like the girl, but
work with her for my dead body.

296
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:04,913
Thank you.

297
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,800
No, You know what? I'm sorry. She's
a nice girl. I feel bad for her.

298
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,320
She's going through a lot of hell right
now. I wouldn't wanna be in her shoes.

299
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,400
Hey, found this. Sitting at the bar.
Somebody's got a secret admirer.

300
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,760
Secret Admirer, huh?

301
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:20,952
Yeah. Card says Destiny.

302
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,880
Oh God. Hers, the princess
of the Shining flame.

303
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,400
Who's.

304
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,800
Victoria? The, the
redhead who died. Oh God.

305
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:42,843
He was here.

306
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:43,960
Well, still is.

307
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,359
Let's go. I on the, Wait a minute.

308
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,520
We know a guy who steals jewelry from
women and gives it to other women.

309
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:50,720
Ooh.

310
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,553
Baby. Absolutely.

311
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,080
Well, only the killer could have
the Ring and Destiny could be his.

312
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,240
Next target. And we don't take
our eyes off. Destiny 24 7.

313
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,080
Okay, wait a minute, y'all, I mean,
let's listen to the description here.

314
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:05,359
Muscle Beach type, blonde hair
long. That's not, Ooh, baby.

315
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,640
Well, maybe he wore disguise or something.

316
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:11,920
Nobody wears disguises.

317
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,359
Since Ryan was busy tailing.
Ooh, baby. Burt around town.

318
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:20,880
It was up to me and Garner
to watch over. Destiny.

319
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,040
The key to surveillance is the
ability to blend in your surroundings.

320
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,200
If the obstacle is now this card, well,

321
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,800
it represents danger. So you might
wanna take up to new extra precautions.

322
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,280
Be a little more careful. The, if the,

323
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,073
It's, uh.

324
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,113
Understand.

325
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,200
Mines don't talk. Oh.

326
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,960
Let me tell you. See the eyes.

327
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,400
That blue is the where? The
color gold. What your teeth bud?

328
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,480
What your teeth. What your teeth.
Papa Mama. What? Your teeth?

329
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,320
Your hair. Straight. Hey, he's about.

330
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,720
Six, two big old belly orangey
kind of hair spiked out.

331
00:28:20,721 --> 00:28:22,280
Like he stuck his finger in a socket.

332
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,359
You've seen him? No.

333
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,000
Give to

334
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,433
you.

335
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,233
Okay.

336
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,320
Wrong guy.

337
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,153
Forget.

338
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,553
Fool.

339
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,273
Bad things.

340
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,870
Was in the office looking for me.

341
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:22,990
Maybe.

342
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:25,150
The connection isn't with the victims.

343
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,430
Destiny made me the
connections with the killer.

344
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,783
Maybe

345
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:36,990
all I know is that I keep seeing people
getting killed and that I might be

346
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:40,840
next. I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

347

We shared the same spirit for a while.

423
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,710

I just, I can't explain it. You know.

426
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:22,670
I can't explain it away either.
So, what do you wanna do with this?

427
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,630
Carto could only escape
the forest of screams

428
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,870
by covering the eyes of the predator.

429
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:37,510
The guys are downstairs. You wanna join

Why are you so fidgety?

435
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:30,469
I feel like somebody's,
somebody's watching me

436
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,880

437
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,440
