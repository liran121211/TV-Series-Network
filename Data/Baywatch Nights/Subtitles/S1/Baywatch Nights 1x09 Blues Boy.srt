00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,259
the difference between being a lifeguard

108
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,839
and a private eye is that a lifeguard

109
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,199
has to spot trouble and respond Private

110
00:09:52,199 --> 00:09:53,790
Eye gets hired by someone who's already

111
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,269
in trouble either way a stranger's life

112
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,779
is suddenly in your hands

113
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,040
unfortunately private eyes can't always

114
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,100
spot the victims as easily as lifeguards

115
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,970

207
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,710
child who's the man that's Ned Simon the

208
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,670
boy's father

209
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,170

210
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,550
father no he's been ID'd on the beach he

211
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:58,270
is a musician he is Ned Simon

212
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,670
he may be Ned Simon but he's not the

213
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,260
child's father why is that

214
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,420

215
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:10,780
Logan are you sure certainly I'm not

216
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,540
surprised that the name is Logan know

217
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,089
that she's certain hmm he's been in the

218
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:24,569

219
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,329

221
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,170

223
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,260
tough for all of us who work in the

224
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,410
system it's burdensome he's been placed

225
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,060
in foster homes time and time again and

226
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,190
every time he runs away

227
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,550
it is so troublesome now we haven't come

228
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,610
across him for the past 18 months where

229
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,660

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,470
he'll run away again

237
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,680
