411
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,170
powerful very dangerous man who in many

412
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:36,850

in here than we do I'm sorry I don't

414
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,820

427
00:26:21,929 --> 00:26:25,099
interesting career choice for a woman

428
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:28,339
let's just say I like being my own boss

429
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,409

be able to get anything he wants even in

440
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,649
