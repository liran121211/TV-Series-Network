1
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,280
In.

2
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,919
The city of.

3
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,560
People.

4
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,160
Are drowned in the sea.

5
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,913
And part time

6
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,233
the.

7
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,300
You can.

8
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,430
Good morning, Buchanan, It's me.

9
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,430
Hey you, you at the office?

10
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,230
Not even float. Check the
bluff behind your tower.

11
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,463
<Laugh>.

12
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:58,550
Wow. You real heartbreaker Ry when
you got a hot date or something?

13
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,870
Yeah. I wish more like the
Malibu Women's Club luncheon.

14
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,710
I'm lecturing on the
pitfalls of being a woman pi.

15
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:08,510
And then after that I'm gonna network
those rich ladies right outta their

16
00:05:08,511 --> 00:05:09,550
faragamo pumps.

17
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,150
<Laugh>. I'm sure you will.

18
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,270
Listen. A potential client wants to meet
with you today. Her name is Jerry Ross.

19
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,990
Our office five o'clock. Okay.

20
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,823
I'll be there.

21
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,103
All right. Good luck.

22
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,110
Thank you ladies.

23
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,870
Thank you. You guys
were fantastic as usual.

24
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:42,070
Thank you Byebye sweetheart.

25
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,023
Use me.

26
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,190
It's your life, right? That's your step.

27
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,970
A tough day at the office, huh?

28
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,920
Hey, anytime you want to trade. Mitch.

29
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,800
Are you in a new case?
I'll know in three minutes.

30
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,243
Oh yeah.

31
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
Wow. What kind of case?
I don't know, Greg.

32
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't tell me. I bet it's a murder, right?

33
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:16,880
A beautiful Malibu social like it's
whacked by a young jealous lover. Huh.

34
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,279
Uh. I'll know about, uh, two minutes.

35
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:25,000
This is gonna be big Mitch. I could
feel it. I could feel it. Just like, um,

36
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:29,720
the bogie multis falcon or, or
dub indemnity? Barbara Stanwick.

37
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,279
Mitch Buchanan.

38
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:33,839
Miss uh.

39
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:34,960
Jerry Ross.

40
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,520
Pacific Coast Yacht Club.

41
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,360
Right? Right. Very nice to meet you. Good.

42
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,880
What? Oh, <laugh>. Oh yeah, yeah, sure.

43
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,873
Uh, coffee.

44
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,600
Perhaps two. Motor yachts were robbed
during the past week. Mr. Buchanan.

45
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,720
The most recent occurring last night.

46
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,160
What about the police?

47
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,640
Strict orders, No publicity.

48
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,279
Now since the thief apparently
boarded the boats from the water,

49
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,640
our club directors felt
that perhaps your, um,

50
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,280
lifeguard experience could serve
us well. Are you interested?

51
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,720
Yes. Yes, of course. Okay.

52
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,760
All pertinent information
concerning the two boats,

53
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,440
as well as I trust a sufficient retainer.

54
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Um, this will be fine.

55
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,920
Tomorrow night launches our
affiliate marina golf tournament.

56
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,000
Folks are coming in from all over
California and we don't need any more

57
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:44,480
robberies. Understood.

58
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,040
Understood. Good.

59
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,840
Hmm. Clyde, I hope I spell Cline to you.

60
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:55,880
You're not serious.

61
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,160
This spells Clive to me.

62
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,160
Security guard.

63
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,993
Hey.

64
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,720
I'm up top, top making my rounds right?

65
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:22,880
Smoking a cigarette mind
and my own business.

66
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,960
All of a sudden I see a flashlight
now, another people out of town.

67
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,360
So I come up around here to check
it out. Oh, out of the blue,

68
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:34,000
this guy knocks me off on my. Down
the steps. Chase up the steps here.

69
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,040
Right around. Leave downs off the
side, man. Don't even see him again.

70
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:38,874
Just like that.

71
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,240
And after he knocked me down the
stairs, he ran up to the bridge here.

72
00:08:45,241 --> 00:08:48,240
Climbed out that window.
Dove off right there.

73
00:08:55,059 --> 00:08:55,480
Now.

74
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,920
Who might you be? Handsome.

75
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,200
It should all look like a law man.

76
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,800
Maybe I can mix a little
pleasure with business.

77
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,273
Hey.

78
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,559
Found this on the swim step. What is it?

79
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,320
Tape from the o ring on a scuba tank.

80
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,223
West.

81
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
Sea, maybe West Coast Divers.
You wanna check it out? Yeah.

82
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,600
Along with that security guy.

83
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,480
Mr. Buchanan. Hey.

84
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,720
Jerry Ross, I like you to
meet my partner. Garner lb.

85
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:52,480
How.

86
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,313
Do you do.

87
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
Ms. Ross? You know, if the owners
are this boat or scuba divers.

88
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,080
Mr. Buchanan, they're in their
late sixties. They drink martinis.

89
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,360
Very nice. Dana. This is
a very good night's work.

90
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,160
It's reward you for your
work. I'm gonna give you

91
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:15,950
$30,000.

92
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,360
You're dreaming again, Carl.

93
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,720
Okay? Nina, I'm in a good mood today.

94
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,280
Why don't we say 50 k?
Put a whole package.

95
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,400
I don't think I heard you.

96
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:34,040
Nina. Want you to listen Very careful
to me. Cause it's gonna be my last off.

97
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,793

98
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,713

99
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,520
Tough Nina. Okay, 75 deal. Done.

100
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:53,720
So tell me something, Nina. What
we're gonna do with all this money?

101
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,880
Two more deals and I'm done.

102
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,520
Don, what the hell do you mean? Done.

103
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,080
Means I made my net and
I'm out of the business.

104
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,200
If you can't quit, you're
natural. Hey, you and me,

105
00:11:06,201 --> 00:11:09,640
we could work the whole West coast, make
some real money. You know, something.

106
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:11,920
They got. Marin is all over the world.

107
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:20,120
Tonight and tomorrow
night, and then I'm done.

108
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,120
You're kidding yourself, Nina.
Once this gets in your blood,

109
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:28,920
it doesn't go away overnight. I've seen
it before. It never leaves your system.

110
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,553
Never.

111
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,443
Hey.

112
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,100
Hey.

113
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,110
You're looking for me.

114
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,183
Just gonna borrow your water.

115
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,703
Oh.

116
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:15,950
Hey, hey, hey. There's a restroom for.

117
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,390
That. I don't need a restroom.

118
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:35,510
Hello? Oh, no, no, no, baby.

119
00:12:35,511 --> 00:12:40,230

into a real money maker. Yeah,

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,760

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,520
Run, swim run, Huh? In
training for something special.

123
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,280
<Laugh>? Yep. I'm gonna be
a lifeguard just like you.

124
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,793
So let's walk away.

125
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,790
Oh.

00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,623
Okay.

127
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,000
Is that something about the fish burglar?

128
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,600
Oh, uh, no. It's nothing that exciting.

129
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,800
It's just insurance photos
from stolen jewelry.

130
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,400
Whoa. These are some serious dimes.

131
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,960
Yeah. Very serious.

132
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,400
This is one very cool case. You know,
it's all about money, power, and sex.

133
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,760
Are we talking about the same case here?

134
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,480

Don't tell me you're gonna
gimme a speeding ticket.

No, but it means I'm gonna give you a
warning. Will you slow down, please?

Yes, sir. Nina. Cutter.

I promise to slow down if you
let me repay your fees. So.

160
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Kind. Well, that's not
necessary. I'm glad you're okay.

161
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,593
You like lobster?

Excuse me. Hey.

169
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,180
Hold on your breath now.

Well, that's good. We just
go so far. We got Didley.

174
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,700
I checked out a security guard. He's
got a record for stolen cars, man.

175
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,740
This is way out of his league.

176
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,340
So what's your.

177
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,020
Idea in on and underwater surveillance.

178
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,660
So what are you gonna do, Mitch?

179
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:07,380
You're gonna wait in the water until
this boat burglar makes his move.

180
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,700
Yeah.

181
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,460
That's it.

182
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,220
Probably. Come on. There must
be a thousand boats in the ver.

183
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,500
Concentrate on the 15. Visiting
yachts with Liverboards.

184
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:16,619
They're all in for a
convention and dock. Same area.

185
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,260
All you guys gotta do is drink
bag coffee and eat donuts.

186
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,260
How.

187
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,093
You doing, Mitch?

188
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,780
Okay. I was starting to feel the cold.

189
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,220
Listen, I'll head down one more
time and cold tonight, huh?

190
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,540
Yeah, Roger that.

191
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,133
Yeah.

192
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:19,700
I had him. He disappeared and headed
west. I'll keep looking in the zodiac.

193
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,020
Watch your back.

194
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,980
You see any movement up there?

195
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,660
No. No place is like a morgue.

196
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,310
Hold it right there.

197
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,520
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey,
Nina. Who is it? Mitch.

198
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,680
Mitch Buchanan.

199
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,713
Mitch.

200
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,080
I thought you were that cat where we've
been hearing so many rumors about.

201
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:01,440
No cats here. Size. Say, hey, water.

202
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,720
You look like you could eat some tea.

203
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,663
What's up?

204
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,520
Look, I've searched the whole
channel for him. No sign.

205
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:14,840
What do you say We call it tonight,
huh? We'll see you guys tomorrow.

206
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,119
See you tomorrow. Where are
you? Uh, I'm worth a friend.

207
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,143
A friend.

208
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,080
Affirmative. Over and out.

209
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,463
A.

210
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,840
No Mitchell's, lots of friends.

211
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,313
Oh, you're right.

212
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:42,310
I, uh, noticed all your
swimming trophies. Sprinter.

213
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,190
Backstroke.

214
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,750
Ah, backstroke. How far did you get?

215
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,510
Almost to the Olympics till a bad
rotator cuff ended that dream.

216
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,030
Hardly swim at all anymore,
but I love being by the.

217
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:00,310
Water. You ever do any, uh,
springboard diving or platform?

218
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,310
I love them both.

219
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:03,400
Scuba?

220
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,750
No, I'm a surface summer,

221
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,790
bad inner ear.

222
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,869
I think you have very nice ears.

223
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,733
Really?

224
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:17,390
I always thought they were kind of big.

225
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,310
No, no. I think that they're just right.

226
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,990
Better be careful. It's
one of my weak spots.

227
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,830
What about your left?

228
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,310
Especially the left.

229
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,390
I thought you didn't have time to play.

230
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,573
I don't.

231
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,910
Oh, wait, wait a minute. I, My
tickets. Oh, come on. Fifth row.

232
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,310
Oh, all right. They're yours.
You're killing me, man.

233
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,590
I just gave up my fifth row king tickets
for nothing. This is gonna cost you.

234
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,810
What?

235
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:06,310
You asked me to run the name Nina Cutter
through the police computer, right?

236
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,630
Well, this woman has no arrest, no
moving violations, no parking violations,

237
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,990
no nothing. The name in
the cutter is so clean.

238
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,590
It squeaks by who isn't in the cutter.
And why does Byron have my king tickets?

239
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,390
Like I told Ryan, I I met her yesterday.

240
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:23,109
I bumped into her again at the
marina last night. And, uh, well,

241
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,869
she lives on a boat, so I
just, when I check her out.

242
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,190
Oh, oh, oh, oh. I see. So there's a
little flutter of the heartstrings.

243
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:32,910
Whose heartstrings are a flutter.

244
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,750
Private investigations
may ask who's calling

245
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,190
Nina Cutter online one.

246
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,063
You very much.

247
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,253
Hey, you.

248
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:56,240
Hi. I just wanted to call and say that
I had a very nice time last night.

249
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,600
Yeah. So did I. You make
a wicked cup of tea.

250
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,359
How are your ears?

251
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:09,800
They're still tingling. I'd like
to make you that lobster dinner I.

252
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,080
Promised. Sounds good.

253
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,800
Are you busy tonight?

254
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,143
I am now.

255
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,473
Seven 30.

256
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,640
Seven 30 for lobster.
Looking forward to it.

257
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,880
See you then. Bye.

258
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,600
What? She's gorgeous.
Wants to cook me lobster.

259
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,760
She's got great ears.

260
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,760
So you're taking you to dinner?

261
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:43,440
No, no. She's taking me.

262
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:45,440
Well, that's really stupid.

263
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:46,869
Stupid.

264
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:48,920
That's what I said. Stupid.

265
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,680
What's your problem?

266
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:53,280
It's not my problem. You're the
one making a fool outta yourself.

267
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,840
Well, of having dinner with a
beautiful woman makes me a fool. And.

268
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,880
And you're jeopardizing
this investigation.

269
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:58,560
No.

270
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,160
I'm not. She's a suspect. We.

271
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,993
Checked her out.

272
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,640
Right? You wanted to have her
eliminated. So we eliminated her.

273
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,240
But she's a champion.
Swimmer lives on a bow.

274
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,600
She doesn't scuba dive.

275
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,560
Maybe she lied.

276
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,880
Maybe you're jealous.

277
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,500
Jealous. Is that what you think?

278
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:22,060
That's exactly what I think.

279
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,093
That I'm jealous.

280
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:27,660
Yes. Me having a wonderful lobster
dinner with a beautiful woman.

281
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,630
Think of that as a pre lobster
dinner appetizer. Have a good time.

282
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,350
You got a shirt I can borrow?

283
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,670
Yeah, sure.

284
00:27:29,109 --> 00:27:30,040
I used to.

285
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:34,040
It was worth the pain.

286
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,833
I'll go get some more.

287
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,353
Okay.

288
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:20,920
Yeah.

289
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:24,040
Mitch, we finished the dive shop proceeds
and came up with some possibility.

290
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,640
Nina cutters on the top of the list.

291
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:32,103
Yeah.

292
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:36,640
Yeah. She, uh, field tanks on the days
of both the robberies and this morning.

293
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,360
Sorry man.

294
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:41,863
Thanks.

295
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,850
Mitch. What's wrong?

296
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,610
Oh, um, I gotta go.

297
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,443
Oh.

298
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,410
I hope it's nothing serious.

299
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,170
No, no. I, I just forgot. I'm working
the late shift for a very unhappy client.

300
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:11,290
Well help your clients big and
ugly there some beer. No teeth.

301
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,203
Bye.

302
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,780
She's pretty hot looking, Huh?

303
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,033
Who?

304
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:39,660
Nina. Cutter.

305
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,640
Yeah, she is.

306
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,120
And you like her a lot?

307
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,600
And what if she turns out
to be this cat burglar?

308
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,800
She'll go to prison and
I'll never see her again.

309
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,840
So what did you dry out
your wetsuits together?

310
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,840
She's got company.

311
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,670
All right.

312
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,320
I'll have Garner on the license plate
on that Lincoln through the computer.

313
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,000
This has gotta be his car.

314
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,280
I need a hundred thousand
Carl. Non-negotiable.

315
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,120
All right. Conditional that you
don't retire for another month.

316
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,360
Me and I got some ideas that
could make us both very rich.

317
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,080
Can't do that. Carl. Now
are you interested or do I
have to go somewhere else?

318
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,600
You must love your brother very much.

319
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,190
What did you just say?

320
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,110
Come on, Nina. I know what
you're doing with the money.

321
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:51,150
Lawyers fees for your brother. You
see, he used to work for this, uh,

322
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:55,590
yacht club until he was convicted for
embezzling half a million dollars.

323
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,270
My brother didn't do it.

324
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:01,840
He was framed by the board of directors
who were trying to cover up some shady

325
00:31:01,841 --> 00:31:05,520
investments. How the hell did
you know about this? Anyway.

326
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,520
I got friends in low places. Nina.

327
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,320
I really admire your spirit,
but you're wasting your time.

328
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,120
Get outta here, Carl. This is over. Like.

329
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,080
Hell. It's over. Hey, we got a deal.
You don't just walk out on a deal.

330
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,480
Get out.

331
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:29,880
I see a point. It's just leaving.

332
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,560
He's a fence.

333
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,880
Yeah. Carl James Benke
specializes in jewelry.

334
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,280
He's been keeping a low profile lately,
but he's done six years of our time.

335
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,833
Is he still with Nina?

336
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,823
Yeah.

337
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,400
About two minutes away when bands
comes out, Sit on it. Uh, until I get.

338
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,920
Theres, Yeah, I Investigators,
You know, a Nina Cutter?

339
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,360
Yeah, I don't. Nina Cutter.
That's her boat right over there.

340
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,400
We know all about you Bains. In fact,

341
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:15,280
I've got some partners down in LAPD
who've been wondering where you've been.

342
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,720
Yo, you tell 'em that I've been clean
for the last three years in counting.

343
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,640
Well, maybe they'd like to know why you
just visited a suspected jewel thief.

344
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,440

Hang on guys. I got something.

380
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,600
You see any boats coming
in from the south?

381
00:35:12,989 --> 00:35:15,320
Yeah. You got one sailboat
backing out from a dock.

382
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:20,719
It's too far out in the channel
or it's too big to be a fish.

383
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,680
Guys, this may be Nina,

384
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,560

00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,093
No sign of her.

I repeat traffic from the south. Keep
your head up, man. Traffic from the south.

00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,820
Got it. Griffin, bold. I see her.

Remember sued. She's headed South.

396
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,820
South. Mitch, that boat traffic
is coming from the south.

397
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,020
I don't see it yet.

398
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,380
Mitch, that boat is getting
close. Do you see it? It's right.

399
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,660
There. I don't see it. I don't see it.

400
00:38:30,219 --> 00:38:32,620
Mitch, that boat right on top of you Now.

401
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:36,120
See it. I see.

402
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,840
It's coming right at
her. Nina, stop. Nina.

403
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,719
She's hit it. She lost her air.

404
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,200
God. God, She's hung out on the keel,
so she's gonna drown going after her.

405
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,800
Stop the boat.

406
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,920
There's no time. Mitch,
how do we stop the boat?

407
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,640
I got an idea.

408
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,480
I don't know, man. Stopped.

409
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,880
I got her golfer back.

410
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,393
I'm on the surface.

411
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,200
Mitch. Mitch.

412
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,320
Okay. Okay. Okay, girl.
Easy. Just spit it out.

413
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,360
Slow and easy. Give a jacket.

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,313
It easy. I.

415
00:40:52,989 --> 00:40:57,719
I checked into Nina's background
and found out some things

416
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,000
that you might wanna know about.

417
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,080
Wrong. I don't want to know.

418
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,743
Okay.

419
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,600
Nina has a brother in prison serving
three to five from embezzling,

420
00:41:12,601 --> 00:41:14,880
half a million dollars from
the Pacific Coast Yacht Club.

421
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,120
Nice one. The family.

422
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,840
She thought he was innocent and then it
was a Senate she was stealing in order

423
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:26,800
to pay for the lawyers and
get her brother a new trial.

424
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,280
Still doesn't make it right?

425
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:32,400
No, it doesn't. But it shows
that she had good intentions.

426
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,880
