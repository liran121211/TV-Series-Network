1
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,103
In the city,

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,110
drowned in the sea. Devil

3
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:46,909
rain for time.

4
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,343
The

5
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,583
after the.

6
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,980
Hey, the water looks great. I'm going in.

7
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,443
Hi, down now.

8
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,160
Barnett. Good job. You.

9
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,400
Got her? Okay. Bring her over here.

10
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,433
Hey, give us a hand.

11
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,080
Good. Good. You ready? Give me a hand.
All right. 1, 2, 3. Go. Grab her arm

12
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,640
all healthy. Push her up. Push her
up quick. Pull her up. You got her.

13
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,633
It's a man.

14
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,713
What? Huh?

15
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,520
There.

16
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,560
Are many differences between
being a lifeguard and being a pi.

17
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:52,080
Lifeguards run on sand.
PIs have run on everything.

18
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,320
I realized that as I chased
after a boardwalk con. Man,

19
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,640
we've been staking out all day.
You know, John Len once said,

20
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,040
and it's a wise proverb too,

21
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,360
that life is what happens
when you're busy making plans.

22
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,720
I didn't plan on meeting a beautiful
woman during a fist fight. Back off, man.

23
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,800
Just leave me alone. No way,
man. I chase you too far.

24
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,920
I'll let you go now.
Come on. Give it up. Huh?

25
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,880
You want me to hurt her?
What's your name? Cindy.

26
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,520
Cindy, sorry. About

27
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,339
a drowned man wearing a woman's dress.

28
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,660
A knockout named Cindy and
a man and a Nixon mask.

29
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,980
Funny how one thing can lead to another
even if they don't seem to have anything

30
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:17,380
in common at all.

31
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,803
Yeah.

32
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,723
What?

33
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,200
It's been a wonderful night, Miss.

34
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,760
Like we miss gorgeous,
witty, intelligible.

35
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,640
Handsome man. A delicious
candlelight dinner.

36
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:33,160
Dancing all night.

37
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,640
Life. The plane. It's a wonderful
too. Didn't you like it?

38
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,880
Yeah, it was okay. It was long.

39
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:44,000
Really? You didn't seem that way to me.

40
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,520
It actually three hours and five minutes.

41
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,120
<Laugh>. I didn't notice. It was so sad.
I must have gone through 20 Kleenex.

42
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:52,400
I.

43
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Know you went through 25.

44
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,880
And how made you go through Mr. Macho?

45
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,240
Me. Oh, I, I think I sniffled once.

46
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,559
How could you not cry? So sad.

47
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,080
They were so in love. And when she died.

48
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,890
Uhoh, Here we go again. <laugh> 26.

49
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,270
You know what the problem with men is?

50
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,190
Well, I, I've heard that
we're, uh, oversexed ill,

51
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,710
mannered insensitive workaholics.
Hate to ask for directions.

52
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,510
Uh, stop me when I'm wrong.

53
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,750
I will. You're missing the big one.

54
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:34,523
The big one.

55
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,830
Men are not in touch
with their feminine side.

56
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,133
What?

57
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,390
Look, Mitch, you're a great guy,

58
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,350
but it wouldn't have hurt if
you got in touch with yours.

59
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,429
Got in touch with what? Where you going?

60
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,429
Wait, Cindy, wait a minute. What.

61
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,270
What, what happened?

62
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,350
I don't know. We went to
dinner. I was witty. Charming.

63
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,870
We danced all night. I
was graceful, attentive.

64
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,510
We drove up the coast
to watch the sunrise.

65
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,790
And the next thing I
know is we're arguing.

66
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,590
Ah, get your mind off
it. Come help me. Look.

67
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,590
Ah, I don't want to get sand in my
shoes. What are we looking for again?

68
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,470
The Meritorious Moose.
Stan Feldman's Lodge. Man.

69
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,110
Will you hang up the phone? Cindy

70
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,360
Meritorious Moose Bogard is hired
to find the Malt Falcon and we are

71
00:11:54,361 --> 00:11:56,720
hired to find the
Meritorious Moose partner.

72
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,559
A gig. A gig. That what this
all about with you and Cindy.

73
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,679
Well, she said I wasn't in touch
with my feminine side. She.

74
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,000
You know.

75
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,040
What? My feminine side. Oh.

76
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,760
She's right. Most men are. Yeah.

77
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,640
How do you know that?

78
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,360
Charlie. Jesse, right? Yeah. Uh,

79
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,920
hey, hey, hey. Come on. Let

80
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,840
get outta here. Hero.
Gerald says, same thing.

81
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,320
Hey. Hi.

82
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,620
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry to,
I don't know what happened,

83
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,559
but I don't know what the
whole thing was about. Okay.

84
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,559
Ah, good. Good dog. Good, good boy. Good.

85
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,483
Me. I'm,

86
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm moose hunting. Found it.

87
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,280
Okay. See you later.

88
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,713
Darling's. Best friend.

89
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,623
Tired.

90
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,350
Dog. Chad.

91
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:30,823
Did you get the moose medal?

92
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,230
Recover? Is and got it.

93
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,223
Oh.

94
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,110
Well, I have some good news
too. We might have a case.

95
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,429
Oh, I hope it's somebody
who's got some money.

96
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,830
Same it. Chris Vogel. He called this
morning. He sounded really scared.

97
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,093
What's the problem?

98
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,090
I don't know. Are you supposed
to meet tonight in 15 minutes?

99
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,490
Give us the whole story. Where's Mitch?

100
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,920
Hey, Inside calling
Cindy. But you got there.

101
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,240
Mine. Don't even think about it.

102
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,880
Hey, you gotta handle the bills now.
I cannot handle the bills. Okay. I.

103
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,600
Know when they handle em all
the time and I handle 'em.

104
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,633
Just, Whoa.

105
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,880
Ben Miller and the snow.

106
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,720
And there's Cher.

107
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,680
And Madonna.

108
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,360
There's Marilyn and Ross. Who?

109
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,393
And she's dead.

110
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,080
Who are these people? Female.
Impersonate, sweeper. On a hell of a show.

111
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:46,303
Ryan?

112
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,453
Yes.

113
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,320
Hi, I'm Chris Vogel.

114
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,483
Hi.

115
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,370
Hi.

116
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,280
We need to hire private detectives.

117
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,800
It's been two days since I was attacked
and the police still got no leads.

118
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,880
We thought we were scared before,
but now at these phone calls.

119
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,400
How many calls?

120
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,240
One last night and one this morning.

121
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,800
What does he say?

122
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,440
Death threats to all of us.

123
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,280
You mean you and the other performers?

124
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,800
Yeah. Myself, Randy, and Steve. Uh, just.

125
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,280
For the record, I think we can handle
this ourselves. We don't need you guys.

126
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:19,600
No.

127
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,600
Offense. No, no. None taken. But what
if you can't handle it without us?

128
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,260
No offense. Okay.

129
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,020
What's his.

130
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,820
Name? That's Randy Dillon.
Listen, don't take it personal.

131
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:35,220
He's plenty scared himself.

132
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,900
Now, uh, Chris, about our uh, feet.

133
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,700
Look, we pulled our money and we came up
with $600. Steal all your next. Chris,

134
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:46,980
you wanna strike your gotta go. Okay.
We're getting our stuff off. Stage.

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,620
600. Come on.

136
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,940
You guys just gotta come a time when we
stand by our 300 bucks plus expenses.

137
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:54,060
Come on. Yeah.

138
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,300
I say we max this thing out in
two days or ask for more money.

139
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,020
I say, you're right. That's
usual. I didn't say that.

140
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:13,020
Yeah, about what that was. The balls
are, We've had a girl who good.

141
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:17,340
I would call it wish I had a rabbit and
a hat with a back and a six to ball.

142
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:22,060
I wish I was like six nine so I can
give it Leo. Cause she don't know me.

143
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:24,940
But yo, she's really fine. You know,
I see her all the time. If you,

144
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,900
I don been in my dreams, like
I see my way, make her mind.

145
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,420
Cause I know she's living back. Her
boyfriend's tall and he play ball.

146
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,060
So how am I gonna compete with that?
Cause when it comes to playing.

147
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,140
I'm to be picking.

148
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:39,260
It and catch up. Pick it
off so I can up on the wall.

149
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,420
But sit up in Thes with the
girls who came to watch. You.

150
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,140
Know, I hear that cutting edge thing
in your music up there, but, uh,

151
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,660
go listen to some muddy and some
T-bone. You know what I'm saying?

152
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,420
Then come on back, we'll
talk about it. Thanks.

153
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,660
Hello. Listen.

154
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,740
Take this case and you're all.

155
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,140
Dead. Hello? Hello.

156
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,533
Cindy.

157
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,980
No, somebody's not too
happy. We're on the case.

158
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,460
Luck the guy.

159
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,300
Chris, what else can you
tell me about this guy? Man,

160
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:26,780
we don't have a whole
heck of a lot to go on.

161
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,340
Let's see the bat. The Nixon mask,
his weird voice. Oh, wait a second.

162
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,460
He said something when he was
chasing me. Something like, uh,

163
00:17:35,461 --> 00:17:37,100
wait till your father gets home, Junior.

164
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,260
Okay, thanks.

165
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,380
Just wait till your father gets
home Junior. I'm telling you.

166
00:17:47,381 --> 00:17:48,710
I know that line from somewhere.

167
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,600
Maybe it's from a movie or something.

168
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,160
Wait a minute, guys.

169
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,920
That phone call I got downstairs
was from the attacker. He said,

170
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:02,200
You better back off the
case or you're dead. Oh.

171
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,680
I mean, great. So now we're
risking our butts for 600 bucks.

172
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,073
Oh, don't pout.

173
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,280
I'm not ping.

174
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:09,619
So where do.

175
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:12,340
We start? First thing we should
do is check with the lapd. Huh?

176
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,820
See what your buddies
can dig up on the attack.

177
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
Yeah, sure. But one of us ought to
stick with Chris and his friends. Eh?

178
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,403
What's this.

179
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,020
Duncan's script?

180
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,580
Man, we better return this. You know how
he feels about it. Wait, wait. Hang on.

181
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,940
Bear's fair big a number
between one and 10. Five.

182
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,933
Seven.

183
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,483
It's two.

184
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,180
Five lower than seven here. This.

185
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,900
How come you always
get to pick the number?

186
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,380
I'm not pouting.

187
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,300
Say hi to Dunin for us, Mr. Vie. Thank.

188
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,133
You.

189
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,940
My funny Valenti.

190
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,493
Sweet.

191
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,173
Valenti.

192
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,063
Your looks.

193
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,270
Oh.

194
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,109
Mom, you're the best.

195
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,183
It's open.

196
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,470
Dunin. Hi.

197
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,910
Ryan. Oh, what a nice surprise. Come here.

198
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,230
Hey, who do you think should play
me in the movie? Uh, Macaulay Kin.

199
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,030
Sure, sure. Uh, I forgot your script.

200
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,790
Oh God. Thank you. Thank you.
Can I get you something to drink?

201
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,869
No wine, juice, water. No, no,
no. That's okay. No, no, no.

202
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:46,070
I'll just take a second. You know,

203
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:48,840
I'm waiting for a call from New
York about the paperback rights.

204
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,080
Now they're talking about putting
out the paperback before the movie.

205
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,200
I had no idea.

206
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,520
Mother was quite an amazing woman.

207
00:20:57,859 --> 00:21:01,240
All those lies about a drinking
problem and a violent temper.

208
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,720
She was the perfect mother. Sweet, gentle,

209
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,200
kind. Just like on the TV show,

210
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,400
my movie will tell the truth
about Dahlia Valentine. Hey,

211
00:21:13,401 --> 00:21:17,240
did you know that my funny Valentine was
the number one show for eight years in

212
00:21:17,241 --> 00:21:19,600
the seventies? Mother was
bigger than Lucie Ball.

213
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,600
Are the awards hers? Yeah.

214
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,960
She received two for this
episode. Performance and writing.

215
00:21:26,961 --> 00:21:29,880
Lucy didn't get one for that.
Hey, can I play it for you?

216
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:35,040
No. No. Oh, Duncan. No, I'm sorry. I
really have to go. Okay. I'm sorry.

217
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,359
Then maybe some other time. Oh.

218
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,880
See you later. Okay.

219
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:54,119
Hey, Carrie, How about a chili dog
with the works? Huh? All right. Uh,

220
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,119
hold the mustard, the relish,
the onions and, and the chili.

221
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,313
Okay.

222
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,640
Hey, you. Hi. You, uh,
you want a chili dog?

223
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,320
I think that to talk.

224
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,993
No problem.

225
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,680
I was outta line. I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings.

226
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,560
No, no. It's okay. It's
just that, that, uh,

227
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,960
think about the feminine side. Well, it,
uh, <laugh> got me a little confused.

228
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,833
Right?

229
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Can I get you some of the drink with.

230
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,993
That?

231
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,119
Can I ask you something?

232
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,393
Anything?

233
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
The last time, when was it?

234
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,680
<Laugh>? Uh, that's kind
of personal, isn't it?

235
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,720
I'll tell you when my last.

236
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Time was. No, no. I don't want know. Or

237
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,593
when?

238
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:49,859
Half hour ago.

239
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,740
Half hour ago. On the bus. On the bus.

240
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,780
Perfectly natural for a
woman. My car broke down.

241
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,859
It's gonna cost a lot to repair. I have
to catch the bus to work. I was late,

242
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,859
so I did it. I just broke down and cried.

243
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,580
It's a catharsis. It's healthy.

244
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:14,340
Okay. All right. My last time, um,

245
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,240
I got it. That movie Field of Dreams,

246
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:22,560
Kevin Costner looks at his dad
coming out of the cornfield and says,

247
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:28,590
We play catch. One more
time. I cry. Great.

248
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,470
See, now that's progress.

249
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,743
Thank you.

250
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,310
Mitch. I have something else to ask you.

251
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,270
It's sensitive.

252
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,450
No, it's okay. Go ahead. I'm on a roll.

253
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,750
Can I borrow your car.

254
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:50,090
My car? Just for a little
while? Oh, you're right.

255
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,050
It's too much to ask. No, no. It's
quite all. Alright, take the car.

256
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:00,983
Thanks.

257
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,003
Have fun.

258
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:23,563
Think I'm gonna cry.

259
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,650
Ryan. C.

260
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,170
Oh gosh. Here comes darn.

261
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,490
Oh, he wants to thank us again. Any ideas?
Uh, urgent meeting. Okay. Top seeker,

262
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,930
very hush hush. Government. Will.

263
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,490
You have a devious mind?
Ryan? I like that woman.

264
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,490
Hi guys. Oh, what a beautiful day.

265
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:47,369
You would not believe the casting
problems I'm having on Viva Valenti Med

266
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:52,250
Ryan wanted to do it. Get this for scale,
but you know, I had to turn it down.

267
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:52,651
See,

268
00:24:52,651 --> 00:24:56,690
I don't need the persona of some big
star interfering with my mother's essence

269
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,170
as a human being. I mean, you understand.
Do you understand though? You.

270
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,490
Absolutely. Definitely.

271
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:01,810
Right.

272
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:06,609
The actress that I cast will
have to understand who my
mother was on the inside.

273
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:13,170
Um, that's great. But we
have to, uh, go and Oh, oh.

274
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:16,090
Oh. Right, right, right. Did I tell
you guys I got all the domestic rights,

275
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:19,210
International rights
video and CD ROM rights.

276
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,369
I'm just waiting for New York to sign
up on the paperback rights and it is a

277
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,203
done deal.

278
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:27,010
Whoa. Look after the time. Uh, but we,

279
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:30,770
we have that meeting right to go.
Right, Right, right. Gotta go, gotta go.

280
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,690
Hang on just a second. Did I tell you
guys about Letterman and Lano? I did not.

281
00:25:34,691 --> 00:25:38,650
I know that. I did not. They
possibly want me to produce. Right.

282
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:42,490
And maybe you crossed your fingers.
Direct a TV movie based on their lines.

283
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,410
What might be feature might be tv,
but most Likely's going to air.

284
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,690
If you guys are, You guys
are good. You guys are nice.

285
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,770
I will let you guys have a small part.

286
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,970
Hey, back at you.

287
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,970
I talked to Mitch. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

288
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,570
He said that the police don't have much
except that Steve Cutter served six

289
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:04,609
months on an assault charge.

290
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,490
And I'll check it out.
How was, uh, Duncan?

291
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:09,730
You.

292
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,850
Wouldn't believe his house?

293
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,923
Yeah. Would.

294
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:40,970
Just like, until your
father gets home. Junior.

295
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,413
You in there?

296
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,173
Steve,

297
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,103
you the.

298
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,373
Hey, Steve.

299
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:31,803
Oh God.

300
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,520
You sure you didn't see
anything? The room was dark.

301
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Somebody popped me from behind. The
lights were What about, uh, Randy di No.

302
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,400
He said he was asleep
in his dressing room.

303
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,713
Kept coming up here.

304
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,640
You were lucky we got nail this guy

305
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,280
Chris. And he's got a bit of an attitude.

306
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Duncan, just wait till
your father gets home.

307
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,720
Junior that line. It's.

308
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:17,119
Right.

309
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,119
On the tip of my tongue.

310
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,880
It's gotta be something else, huh?

311
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,080
You know something
besides both victims being

312
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:33,000
female. Impersonators. I'm
telling you the keys here.

313
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,680
I just don't know what it is.

314
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,400
Buchana, Alabama rider. Oh, hey
Cindy. How you doing? No, no, no.

315
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,840
Of course. Yeah. He's
sitting right here on,

316
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,080
Hey, honey, I left my keys.
No, no, no. That's okay.

317
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:58,040
I got a spare set. You sure?
All right, See you later. Bye.

318
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,353
<Laugh>.

319
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:05,160
<Laugh>. Very funny.
Cool. Wait a minute. What?

320
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,640
I got it. I got it. I got it. I got
the connection. Dahlia Valentine.

321
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,193
Dahlia Valentine,

322
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,080
The guy who played Joan Rivers said
the only person who didn't do Dahlia in

323
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,280
their act was Sid. Right? Yeah.
What does that give us? Uh, yeah.

324
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,280
What does that give us? That gives us,
I don't know. What does that give us?

325
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:34,080
My funny Valentine. My funny Valentine.
Come on. Come on. The theme song.

326
00:29:34,081 --> 00:29:37,680
A dahlia's TV show. Just wait till
your father gets home, Junior.

327
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:40,760
Just wait till your father gets
home. Junior. That's what she always.

328
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,240
Said to her TV Key Duncan.

329
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,000
I'm lost. You're.

330
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,720
Too young. Uh, he.

331
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,680
Was a child star. He, he
played her son on the TV.

332
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,560
Show. You think Duncan did this?

333
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,840
I don't know, but there's
one way to find out.

334
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,880
We could just set a trap and have one
of the impersonators do. Dahlia got.

335
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,120
Huh? Which one? They're all
scared to death. Yeah. Um,

336
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,230
what?

337
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,880
He's a little tall, nice legs,

338
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,240
decent voice. Not great, but not bad.

339
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,760
What might even help him get
in touch with his feminine

340
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,513
<laugh>?

341
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,720
Don't even think it.

342
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,233
<Laugh>.

343
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,680
Even when a guy is hopelessly lost, he
will not stop and ask for directions.

344
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,360
Women think we're too proud
or too stupid. I don't know.

345
00:30:36,361 --> 00:30:39,560
But I have a feeling that I
may have just missed a turn.

346
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,080
Okay, Now.

347
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,840
Just hold still.

348
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,150
Oh.

349
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,120
Stop pouting.

350
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,953
Oh.

351
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,760
Ooh. You going to be hot, baby?

352
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:37,920
Okay. You can gimme your honest opinion.

353
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,840
Alright? Okay.

354
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,720
Okay. Turn around.

355
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,400
So, Oh, you look great. Just like, uh,

356
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,560
Dolia Valentine. Except for
one thing. What? You're, uh,

357
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,553
boxed small.

358
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,040
You know, I'm gonna knock you.

359
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,320
To very funny.

360
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:17,240
You.

361
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,720
Know, this was not my idea. All right.

362
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,703
Hey, Cindy.

363
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:32,883
Matt.

364
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,143
Oh.

365
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,790
It's not what you think. Honest.

366
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,080
I knew you were too good to be true. I
knew it. I knew it. I didn't understand.

367
00:32:43,081 --> 00:32:45,160
It's for a case. God. It's for a case.

368
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,993
Your keys.

369
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,880
Buy. Oh, wage. It's for a case. Nice.

370
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,713
Try, Mitch.

371
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,000
Well, you told me to get in
touch with my feminine side.

372
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,300
Hey, big girl. Okay, Ryan.
So, so what's the pledge?

373
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:08,220
Well, you'll find out in a minute.
Okay. Where do I get the feeling?

374
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:13,060
I'm gonna hate it. You stuck.
It's not that bad. See, look

375
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,443
what.

376
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,053
Whoop be Goldberg.

377
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:20,940
Me.

378
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,540
Will be Goldberg in that dress.
Now you must be dreaming.

379
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,410
No.

380
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:27,820
Garner mean. Well. I'm out in
front watching the audience.

381
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:31,380
You gotta be in the back, you
know, Undercover. Low profile.

382
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,180
Low profile in a dress.
Not me, babe. Come.

383
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:35,380
On.

384
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,940
This is the only way to do it. I
mean, you know, when in Rome, Duaz,

385
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,060
No. Garner, please look, it's your
size. It's your color. It's good. Yeah.

386
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,940
Read my lips. No.

387
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,780
Great shoes.

388
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,220
No. No.

389
00:33:59,110 --> 00:33:59,943
Is it true about.

390
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,940
It's showtime and I definitely
had a case of the jitters. I mean,

391
00:34:06,941 --> 00:34:09,780
it wasn't bad enough that I had
to go on stage dressed as a woman,

392
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:10,980
but I was also.

393
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:12,572
Baked.

394
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,940
Let me a choice, please. Will you
sit down? You made me so nervous.

395
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,660
I've had four cups of coffee.
I don't even like coffee.

396
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:21,453
Yes, son. Dunk.

397
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,660
Yeah, he's in the audience alone.

398
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,620
Where's Garner?

399
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:31,060
He's watching the crowd. He's
fine. Everything's fine. Um,

400
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,380
Mitch what? Mitch.

401
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:34,883
What?

402
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,060
Well, um, your,

403
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,620
your left one is higher
than your right one.

404
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,940
Oh. Um, can you fix it?

405
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,493
Yeah. You want me to fix.

406
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,540
Fix it? I'm not touching
though. Yeah. Two minutes,

407
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:56,500
Mitch. Very good. Good luck. Okay.

408
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,340
Okay. I'm ready.

409
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:18,219
Don't change your for me.

410
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,660
Not if you,

411
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,650
Mitch, Mitch.

412
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,530
Mitch, Mitch Whoopie.

413
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:40,330
It's me. Mitch. Am I Hell,
Mitch, are you alright? Who?

414
00:36:41,469 --> 00:36:45,170
I'm alive. Thanks for that vest. Huh?
Could you, could you make off the shooter?

415
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,363
No.

416
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,833
I'll call 9 1 1.

417
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,753
Go, go.

418
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,760
Come on Duncan. Give it up, man.
What the hell's going on here?

419
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,670
Randy, put the gun down, man.
And we'll talk about this. Huh?

420
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,910
What the hell are you doing? Shut
up to, This is all your fault.

421
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:34,710
You should have cast me in
your movie. What? You're a man.

422
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,600
I am Dahlia Valentine.

423
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,340
This is my house. And you are a dead man.

424
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,690
Wait a minute. Uh, Duncan,
uh, talk to your mother.

425
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,890
She'll listen to you.

426
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,690
Mother. It'll be a great movie.

427
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,890
Everyone will want to come see it.

428
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,770
Who will play me?

429
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,410
Well, you, you are, you dia no
one, no one else could play you.

430
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,753
They tried.

431
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,969
I stop them.

432
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,610
You're the star mother as always.

433
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,170
Just wait.

434
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,730
Until your father gets home.

435
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,363
Junior,

436
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:42,050
Randy, man.

437
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,130
Bad call on our part. You got that right?

438
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,489
Thanks again, guys. Now
I really owe you. Hey,

439
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,770
did I mention that every a-list director
in town is fighting to do my movie?

440
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,489
I mean, every director. But to tell you
the truth, I'm gonna direct it myself.

441
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,010
I mean, you know, after all, who
knows mother better than me. I mean,

442
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:06,450
I've only had my whole
life to study her moves.

443
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:08,410
I know every inch of her up and down.

444
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,443
Yeah.

445
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,570
This $600 paycheck gotta almost pay our.

446
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,730
Rent. I not you to make
Lou almost halfway.

447
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:21,322
Mitchell Buchanan.

448
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:25,530
Yes. I'm Mitch. You're
not from the irs. Are you?

449
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,570
Not even close.

450
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,930
I figured you can get in
touch with your feminine side.

451
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,770
I could get in touch
with my masculine side.

452
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,250
I like it.

453
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,290
Ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Lou.

454
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,603
Raymond.

455
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:54,322

459
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:16,683
wash my clothes.

460
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,210
I don't want you keep my home.

461
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,690
I don't want your money to, I said

462
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,320
love.

463
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,153
