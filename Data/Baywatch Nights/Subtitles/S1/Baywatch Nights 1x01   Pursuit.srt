1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:06,510
You know, some people think the beach
closes after the sun goes down, Uhuh.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,630
That's when it really starts to
heat up, especially if you're a pi.

3
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:14,710
Now I know what you're
thinking. Mitch is a lifeguard.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,270
What does he know about
being a pi? Well, uh,

5
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:20,510
they both involve rescuing people.

6
00:00:20,989 --> 00:00:25,510
Turns out my best friend Garner went
partners in a bankrupt detective agency

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,190
with a beautiful brunette Pi who left
New York for the California son and

8
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:33,630
adventure. What can I say?
When someone yells help,

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,990
I jump in with both feet.
And I hope you do too,

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,110
as we introduce a new series of private
eye adventures called Baywatch Nights.

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,670
Sit back and enjoy the ride

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,160
in the city of angels under of night.

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,440
People.

14
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,920
Are drowned in the sea of life.

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:23,830
The.

16
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,040
Devils hold in.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,760
Rain for time.

18
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,840
After the

19
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,953
the.

20
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,130
My dad told me that every once
in a while you meet a woman.

21
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,490
So beautiful that it knocks the wind
outta you. Maybe today was my turn.

22
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:13,610
Fantastic. Fantastic.
Great. Right? Wonderful.

23
00:05:13,611 --> 00:05:18,050
That's wonderful, darling. Work
it. Come on now. You love it, baby.

24
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,450
That's wonderful, darling. Beautiful,
beautiful. Give me more of that.

25
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,690
That's wonderful. Wonderful.
Okay, now make a love to it.

26
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:35,850
Fantastic. Yeah. I need to
reload. Okay, let's take five.

27
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:37,930
Let's take as long as I want. Love.

28
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,643
Actually.

29
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:45,670
Hey Ken. I'm a <inaudible>
reading business.

30
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,390
Bummer. I'm totally
thinking about quitting.

31
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,390
Oh no. Future in reading futures.

32
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,550
How would I know?

33
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,380
Is that uh.

34
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,533
What I think she is?

35
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,640
Depends. Who do you think she is?

36
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,201
You know,

37
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:04,400
you know it's a drill on the TV ads with
pearls and the champagne and the diving

38
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:05,290
Bloods.

39
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,123
Cassidy.

40
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,640
Cassidy. Right. Model
of just a first name.

41
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,200
It's a photo shoot for a magazine.
Um, more perfume, I think.

42
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,753
What's.

43
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,160
Perfume called? Lust.

44
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,839
No, you're Aura.

45
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,040
I feel lust. You're radiating.

46
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,270
Mind your own aura.

47
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,653
Well, you're a but. Huh?

48
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,500
How you doing? I stud.

49
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,793
Fine. Thanks.

50
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,250
Not you. Him. That's his name.

51
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,883
<Laugh>.

52
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,273
I knew that.

53
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,460
Mom. Cassidy.

54
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:52,130
Hi. I know I'm Mitch.

55
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,290
So.

56
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:55,990
Welcome to our turf.

57
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,970
And what does that mean?

58
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,890
I work.

59
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,723
Right up there.

60
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,930
And what's right up there?

61
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,529
Private.

62
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:02,490
Detective agency.

63
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,330
Really? Yours?

64
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:07,050
Um, not so private. I have two partners.

65
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,250
But no. Ready?

66
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,650
I gotta go to work. Come on, stud.

67
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:17,610
Uh, I can, I gotta go to work too. See ya.

68
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,010
Ryan McBride grew up in Texas and got
our PI license in New York. You know,

69
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:30,650
women can really complicate your life,
especially if your partners with one.

70
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,530
It's an explosive combination. Hey
guys. Hey. Trust me. Anything happening?

71
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,210
We.

72
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,043
Got a job.

73
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,203
Great.

74
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,570
<Laugh>. What? Missing body.

75
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,570
No, no, no. It's not Missing
bodies. Missing persons. Missing.

76
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,970
Persons. Body. Body. The Crabtree
funeral home somehow misplaced.

77
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:50,610
The dearly departed Mrs. T whistle.
They'll pay us real money to find it.

78
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,530
Oh God. We sunk that low.

79
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,170
I.

80
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,250
Have Now we need a contract found
the other day under the letter R.

81
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,330
No contract should be under the letter
C I would be rebound relationships. I.

82
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,810
You set up the file
twisted Nikki Pine did.

83
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,003
Fight my head up.

84
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,370
Hello? LB McBride. Buchana
alphabetical alphabet. Hello? Hello?

85
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,250
Hello? Hello. It's.

86
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,450
The blinking one. Mr. ER.

87
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,730
Banks. They are all blinking. Ms. McBride.
Hello? No, we we didn't order any.

88
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,010
Hang on anybody if you like
Pepper. Any pizza. They.

89
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,843
Take check.

90
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,283
We're good.

91
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,250
Our name was Alexa,

92
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,330
a supermodel whose photograph was
on the cover of a hundred magazines.

93
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,210
But this was our last photo session

94
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,120
when I was eight. I got my
first major league baseball.

95
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,120
One day he met McGinty. Uh, he was 12.
Well, he walks up to me and he says, Hey,

96
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:12,559
gimme your ball. I said, Make
me, He did. I was a mistake.

97
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,120
I've never forgotten. Look.

98
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,280
At, go away and leave me
alone. Were you clean?

99
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,360
Hey. Hey. Leave a lady
alone. You okay? Cassie.

100
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,720
Go away. This is none your.

101
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,440
Business. P just.

102
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,200
Get the hell outta here. Just calm
down. Will you? I'm piece of me. No,

103
00:09:26,201 --> 00:09:29,240
I don't want a piece of you. You just
let the lady go her way. You go Yours.

104
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:31,480
Okay. Come on. You and
me right here, right now.

105
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not gonna break my
knuckles on your brick head.

106
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,433
Not over.

107
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,800
Not over you. Okay.

108
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah. What's his problem?

109
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,440
Glad I could help. Don't
mention it. You're welcome.

110
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:01,250
Oh, Lot of tea whistles.

111
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,850
<Laugh>. If you find a relative,
what are you gonna say?

112
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:07,850
I represent your dead aunt's funeral
home. And uh, I ain't got nobody. Oh,

113
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,330
you wanna come across a hammer?

114
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,210
Uh, yeah, I saw them in the
files. Hammer's under d.

115
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,473
D.

116
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,250
I don't know why. And I don't know
why this computer keeps saying,

117
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,090
What's the password? Butt
head. I just don't know.

118
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,730
You count. Beep.

119
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,603
Hello?

120
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,123
Garner.

121
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,573
Oh.

122
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:36,210
Shoot. I thought I had it beat this
time. How does this devil phone.

123
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,043
Work?

124
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:44,130
Mitch? I, uh,

125
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,633
help.

126
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,850
Sick. Little Valentine.

127
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,170
It's not the first time. Other
letters. Heavy breathing on the phone.

128
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,610
Hangups. You have any
idea who it could be? No,

129
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,490
I don't know who he is, where
he is or why he's doing this.

130
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,890
Have you gone to the police?

131
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,170
Yes. They said they can't
do anything unless he.

132
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,570
Restraining order. But if he's
a serious darker knucklehead,

133
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,610
it probably won't do much.

134
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:22,690
Good. What about that guy with the go
tea today? The big guy who hasling you?

135
00:11:22,691 --> 00:11:23,530
Could he be the guy?

136
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,050
I don't know. He could be, but
Paparazzis are always sneaking around.

137
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,850
I I don't know who he is.
Look, I'm scared to death.

138
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,690
I wanna hire you guys to protect me.

139
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,010
Um, bodyguard.

140
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,250
Around the clock. I'll
pay you whatever it costs.

141
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,633
Sorry.

142
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,583
It's okay.

143
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,240
I was uh, just checking the locks
on the windows and the doors. Okay.

144
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,233
Go ahead.

145
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,600
What's that for?

146
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,870
It's like my sleeping pill with
it Here. And you downstairs.

147
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:44,790
I know I can sleep.

148
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:46,903
<Laugh>.

149
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,230
Uh.

150
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,830
Don't worry. I took lessened.

151
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,373
Okay.

152
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,350
Can I ask you a question?

153
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,573
Sure.

154
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,630
Guy with a goe. He you
right in front of me.

155
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:05,990
Seems kind of weird, don't you think?

156
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:09,390
Well, we've been shooting
on the beach show a week.

157
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,910
Probably followed me around to get
some photos and 'em to the tabloids.

158
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:17,230
That's what they do.

159
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,453
Yeah.

160
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,230
Try not to worry.

161
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,330
Why worry? I got a
bodyguard and a lifeguard.

162
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,770
Round The clock protection
means three eight hour shifts.

163
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:03,330
And I got the graveyard after a
bottle of Merlot and then some

164
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,250
Cassidy was definitely
out for the evening.

165
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,570
Oh.

166
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,290
My god. God. He was standing right there.

167
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,970
I hired you to protect me.

168
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,250
Cassidy. He didn't get past
me. The alarm didn't go off. I

169
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,553
wait a minute.

170
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,440
I checked this last night. It was locked.

171
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,960
I open it. I always sleep with it open.

172
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,560
Well, is it connected to the alarm system?

173
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,360
Yes, but I kept it out of the
loop. Look, it's upstairs.

174
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:06,040
There's nothing for him
to climb on outside.

175
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:09,560
Oh my God.

176
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,403
Oh my god.

177
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,880
And Little league. I was a pitcher by
catcher and I communicated through signs.

178
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,640
One finger was a fastball.
Two fingers a curve.

179
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,800
Holding hands is a sign too.

180
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,720
But I didn't know the game
she was playing or the rules.

181
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,280
Only one way to find out.

182
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,000
A very professional holding hands.

183
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,173
The boss.

184
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,273
Oh, I'm just scared.

185
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,380
Oh, you're real lucky. All I
wanted to take was pictures.

186
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:55,820
It's not the first time
models and actresses.

187
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,620
If they in the spotlight weirdos
try to get at them all the time.

188
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,160
This is the first time anybody's
gotten this close in my house.

189
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,603
My bedroom.

190
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,840
He won't again. Okay.

191
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,380
You last night that got
me thinking about Alexa.

192
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,753
Do you know?

193
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,870
No. Who is she?

194
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,803
Well.

195
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,010
She was a friend of mine, My
best friend. Another model

196
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,360
I found her body at the bottom of a cliff.

197
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:39,440
Police said it was
suicide. I know it wasn't.

198
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,230
Why do you say that?

199
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,590
Everybody said that she was
depressed, drinking and taking drugs,

200
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,870
but she was never happier. Look,

201
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:53,750
I had just turned down a perfume
campaign because I was too busy with the

202
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:57,390
swimsuit calendar. I
suggested her and she got it.

203
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,470
She was on top of the world.

204
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,030
So you're saying why can make suicide?

205
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,550
I was in Denver the night that
she died and I called her.

206
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,550
She told me that somebody was
stalking her. Threatening her.

207
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:17,440
You think he pushed her off the cliff?
Wait a minute. Do you think he's our guy?

208
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,200
Yes. Cassidy. Why didn't
you tell me this before?

209
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,920
I I didn't wanna believe it. Okay. This,

210
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:28,600
this guy was in my room taking
pictures of me while I was sleeping.

211
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:35,810
I'm just so happy that
you're here with me.

212
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:36,840
Cause.

213
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,210
I don't think I would get through.

214
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,043
This.

215
00:17:42,619 --> 00:17:46,190
It's okay. You want to have to

216
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,609
Three fingers was a change up.

217
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:58,170
<laugh> change up always
caught you by surprise.

218
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,450
You knew you shouldn't swing at
it, but you just couldn't help it.

219
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,020
All right. You'll be with her during the
photo shoot this morning, right? Every.

220
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,340
Second and Gar. Spell
me in the afternoon and.

221
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,940
We'll all be there for the fashion show.

222
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,773
Yeah.

223
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,123
What?

224
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,619
Something's.

225
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:33,970
Wrong.

226
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,803
What?

227
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,700
Ah, this is not your color.

228
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,540
<Laugh>. Let your guard
down. She'll kiss you too.

229
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,020
We gotta break in the T Whistle
case. His name Raja Rajari.

230
00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:54,940
Beji <laugh>. He was inside
Mrs. T. Whistle's. Coffin.

231
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:58,900
I guess you'd call Raja Madre.
Kind of a bookkeeping era.

232
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,420
Six foot five, six. Uh, go
tea. Built like the Terminator.

233
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,180
Are you looking for a
paparazzi or a viking? <laugh>.

234
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,500
That's our Cassidy file. If your
guy's taking pictures of her,

235
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,220
he's gonna be trying to sell
them to me. He's not Bunny.

236
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,900
Ah, no thank you. A bunny.

237
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,173
Ah, no thanks.

238
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,740
Why the dollar sign.

239
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,859
Money shop? Oh, front page. Cassidy
and Jag are caught in steamy Denver.

240
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,820
Love trust. That's not big Jager. I know,

241
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,580
but it sure looks a lot
like him. Don't you think?

242
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,700
He's a Denver undercover cop? But I
thought it was close enough to go.

243
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,660
For it. By the time he won. Sus
you sell a million copies. Exactly.

244
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,980
But my boss thought it was too
risky and he killed it. Too bad.

245
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,060
Not really. Publisher fired
him and I got his job.

246
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,173
<Laugh>.

247
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,020
I like the way you guys think. You
got the instincts for this field.

248
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:14,060
Do you wanna do a little snooping
around and see what you can dig up?

249
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,300
What about the truth.

250
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,023
Exactly?

251
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,740
Oh, I, uh, almost forgot.
I found this picture.

252
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,060
The rag mag. What can
you tell me about it?

253
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,580
It's just me. At the new Denver airport.

254
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,540
We threw party and kick
up the swimsuit calendar.

255
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,260
Is that the night Alexa died?

256
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,083
Yeah.

257
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,200
I called her from the hotel. She had
just gotten a new Tama perfume campaign.

258
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,040
But I told you all of this. I got home
two hours after they found the body.

259
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,640
You know, you almost
sound suspicious of me.

260
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:02,760
Excuse me. You know you really shouldn't
be here. Oh, <laugh>. Yeah. Um,

261
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:05,280
I, uh, you're right in.

262
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,080
The middle of a major girlfriend.
Let's try. You go outside and do.

263
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,760
Your guy thing. Oh, come on.
They're professionals. They don't.

264
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,600
Care. I do.

265
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,673
There by the.

266
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:46,952
Is.

267
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,680
I thought you were watching her.

268
00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:30,080
I was. I wasn't watching the mirror.
He got within 20 feet of her.

269
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:34,760
It got busy back here. I'm sorry.
Maybe I can get some prints.

270
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,680
Hey, take me home. Yeah, yeah. Come on.

271
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,593
Sorry sister.

272
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:49,760
When she's not reading
ta cards on the beach.

273
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:52,119
Destiny likes to help out in the office.

274
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:56,160
It sure would be nice if she
came with a set of instructions.

275
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,640
Ever look at something now You
should be able to figure it out.

276
00:25:00,641 --> 00:25:03,640
You just can't drive you absolutely nuts.

277
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,560
Yeah, I checkbook. Huh? It's
got a real negative aura.

278
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,993
<Laugh>.

279
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,080
Your contracts.

280
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:16,480
You figured this mess out.

281
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,600
It's not a mess. It's in perfect
numerological harmony. See,

282
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,520
every letter has a number and you
add them up. And contract is a four.

283
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:27,840
The rest of the fours are filed under f.

284
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:33,000
C is under F? Yeah. Oh. Where
would you look for a hammer.

285
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:34,160
In hardware store?

286
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,520
No, no. <laugh>, I mean filing.
You know Numerologically speaking?

287
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,240
Oh, um, Hammer. D.

288
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:46,600
D Oh, uh uh. What's wrong?

289
00:25:46,601 --> 00:25:49,040
The telephone. It's haunted.

290
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,160
What are you doing?

291
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,480
We're skiing away the evil papers.
Oh. Hello? Buchanan. L being McBride.

292
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,680
Oh sure. Cool. It's Gardner. How'd.

293
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,160
You do that? Hey buddy. Justin.

294
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,560
Oh, Butthead. How beg your pardon? The
password for the computer. You know,

295
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:17,400
what's the password? Butthead.
It's butthead. Kind of cute. Huh?

296
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,119
What's wrong? Uh, yeah, I
can come over early Howard.

297
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,793
Be there half hour.

298
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,400
Oh great. All I got.

299
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,160
Is women who sleep with their son's,
girlfriend's, father's all operates.

300
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,400
A repeat or try watching her all though.

301
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,200
I'm no good at math. Help me. Uh.

302
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,119
Add something up here.

303
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:39,952
Sure.

304
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,240
One. I dusted it.

305
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:45,440
There are no suspicious fingerprints
and it's not in his own handwriting.

306
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,400
He doesn't want to get caught.

307
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,230
<Laugh>.

308
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,400
I talked to some shrinks
and obsessive stalkers.

309
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:56,359
Usually want their victims to know who
they are. Like how much they adore them.

310
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,960
Two. Do you find it odd
that Goe has his little Ted,

311
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,720
Ted with her, like right in
front of your lifeguard tower?

312
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,080
Yeah. I asked her the same thing.

313
00:27:06,081 --> 00:27:09,200
She told me she'd been filming up and
down the beach all week and that she was

314
00:27:09,201 --> 00:27:10,034
easy to find.

315
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,840
Okay. Three.

316
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,320
She got very bad reviews from her
buddies backstage at the fashion show.

317
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,303
Jealousy.

318
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,240
Maybe, maybe not.

319
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,080
Did you know that she lost
a Tamar perfume campaign?

320
00:27:23,081 --> 00:27:25,760
Because she has a drinking problem.

321
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,200
Ryan, these are all very good questions,

322
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:30,600
but so far Cassidy has very good answers.

323
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:35,720
Okay? For and foremost, I saw
you kissing a client. <laugh>.

324
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,160
Oh.

325
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,840
God. Hey, it's wrong to get involved.

326
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,440
Is that what this is all about?
I mean, come on. It was a moment.

327
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:46,720
She was needy. She was scared. I was
hired. We were hired to protect her.

328
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,190
Oh.

329
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,320
What is that? Is it, what
is that testosterone.

330
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,483
I

331
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,453
search for

332
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,153
No.

333
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,450
Cassidy. What?

334
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:17,210
We gotta talk. We will later.
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

335
00:31:17,211 --> 00:31:20,330
This whole thing is happening
way too fast. I wanted to,

336
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,803
Who was that?

337
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,083
Um.

338
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,013
Yeah.

339
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,013
Okay.

340
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,750
Should you call the police or something?

341
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,413
Yeah.

342
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,150
It's okay now. Huh? It's over.

343
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,600
Yes. I'd like to report a death.

344
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,120
I got halfway to the plate before I
realized I misread the sign I got tagged

345
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:53,560
out at home. Even if you only miss
by half a step, you'll still miss.

346
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,040
But I still had one more bat. I.

347
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,360
Know when you came to the precinct
and showed us the letters,

348
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,200
I thought it was some per
getting his sick kicks.

349
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,133
Who was he.

350
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,880
Not carrying any id, But we'll find out.

351
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,080
She saved your life tonight and
a bad guy's outta yours forever.

352
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,400
Everybody was lucky tonight except Tim.

353
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,640
Oh god, it's over.

354
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,239
Well, I guess you won't be needing
your bodyguard anymore, huh?

355
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,263
I guess I want

356
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,120
What's wrong? What's the matter?

357
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:56,880
It's been a hell of a
night, huh? Look, I, uh,

358
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,239
I think I'm gonna take off.

359
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,840
I'll see you soon, Mitch.

360
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:06,800
I couldn't have done it without you.

361
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,640
Hey, we heard on the radio. That
was a close one. You okay? Yeah.

362
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,673
You were right.

363
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,660
No, you have to narrow that down.
I usually am. Okay, come on.

364
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,980
I'm sorry. Hey, listen, it
all worked out for the best.

365
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,900
No. No it didn't.

366
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,260
And when I'm working as a lifeguard,
I know the ocean. I know the sand.

367
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:46,780
I know the people. I know what kind of
trouble they're gonna get into. Man.

368
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:51,070
I gotta learn to trust my instincts.
I'll being a private investigator,

369
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:59,730
I saw it coming. Check these out.

370
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,170
The stalker took these when she was
asleep. Each one's a little different.

371
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:07,930
The blankets have moved
the pillows in a new spot.

372
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,613
So what are you saying?

373
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,410
She took them herself
with an automatic timer.

374
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,930
Everything got moved when she climbed
back in the bed for the next picture.

375
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,643
The letters.

376
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,250
She made him herself and I bought it.

377
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,610
It'd be so hard on yourself. You weren't
the only one who dropped the ball.

378
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:34,450
Dropped the ball, Huh? Man's
dead. If I've been sharper,

379
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:35,489
he might still be alive.

380
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,650
You're not gonna do something stupid.

381
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,530
Nope. Been there, done
that. Watch some help. Nope.

382
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,250
This one's mine.

383
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:24,203
Huh?

384
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,890
Mitch, you scared me.

385
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,530
Haven't even started yet.

386
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,153
Had you know that I was here.

387
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,960
I followed you. He took his wallet.
So you knew where he lived, huh? Hmm.

388
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,040
Gotta be in here somewhere.
What? Oh, you know.

389
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,223
What.

390
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,920
Photographs of you pushing
Alexa off the cliff.

391
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:56,160
Are you crazy? I was in
Denver when she died.

392
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:57,920
I can prove it.

393
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,920
Oh, you don't have to. I have a
picture of you at the airport.

394
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,840
I didn't land in LA until two hours
after they found the body. Uh.

395
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,440
Uh. That's when you were supposed
to land. Remember? You know Cassidy,

396
00:38:11,441 --> 00:38:15,560
Something about this picture
kept up me look real close.

397
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,239
There's a clock on the wall.

398
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:22,200
You were at the airport five hours before
your plane was scheduled to take off.

399
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,680
You must have had a lot
of bags to check. Huh?

400
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,800
I had to ticket on the nine 15.

401
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,920
Flight. You didn't use it.
I checked with the airport.

402
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,239
You took an earlier flight. You
were home hours before Alexa died.

403
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:34,790
Look.

404
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,680
I really don't wanna talk about Alexa.

405
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,560
No, I know. And I know why.

406
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:47,060
When I was out by the pool, you went
inside. You took your cell phone.

407
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:50,700
So I wouldn't notice you called
him, said something like,

408
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,180
You in I'll pay you the money. I want
the photographs and the negatives.

409
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,300
Come over tonight. Leave the
alarm off in the door unlocked.

410
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,380
I didn't do any of that. Mitch. I swear.

411
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:11,860
This is your cell phone.
I'm gonna press redial.

412
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:22,620
Yeah, it's grim. I'm gone.
Leave a message grim <laugh>.

413
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,940
He has a name. You know,

414
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:29,940
I couldn't figure out why you would go
through a dead man's pockets unless you

415
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,900
were hoping to find something
before the police did like his id.

416
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,140
What are you.

417
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,580
Trying to, You killed Alexa
Crimes was a SLE ball.

418
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,980
But he wasn't stalking you. He
was just blackmailing you. Me,

419
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,460
I'm the sucker. You hired for an alibi.

420
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,200
Sorry. Cause I really
had a good time with you.

421
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,793
You won't shoot me.

422
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,719
I'm not going to prison. I've
already killed two people.

423
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,320
What makes you think
I'm not gonna kill you?

424
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,800
Failure is not in my vocabulary.

425
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,120
But as I sat in nights
feeling sorry for myself,

426
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:36,600
I realized that my first case is a pi
was about as successful as my first day

427
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,360
as a lifeguard. I had a lot to learn.

428
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,520
At least Cassidy wouldn't be doing
any photo sessions for a while,

429
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,960
but a man named Grimes might still be
alive if I had trusted my instincts.

430
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,040
From.

431
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,560
The funeral. Our first We Money.
Oh, it's a beautiful thing.

432
00:41:02,469 --> 00:41:04,600
A telephone bill from the phone company.

433
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,080
Do you know what it cost to call Calcutta?

434
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,440
Oh. How did Raja Andre's
family take the news?

435
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:18,080
Not well. Can't blame him when they
took it a lot better than the, uh,

436
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,000
t whistles are going to.
They cremate in Calcutta.

437
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,473
Oh.

438
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:26,480
And he is being FedExed
home in an envelope.

439
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,880
Who gets to make that phone call?

440
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,880
Uh, wait a minute. Uh, wait.

441
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,160
A minute. Hey, hey, wait a minute guys.

442
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,160
And then you, I in my garden

443
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,600
and you went straight for my erritory.

444
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:58,680
It.

445
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,840
Can blow your dreams.

446
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:02,600
There's.

447
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,800
A, you got.

448
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,440
You.

449
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,273
Can.

450
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,520
In the.

451
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,313
Sirens,

452
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,793
Devil.

453
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:32,520
You.

454
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,080
Can hear.
