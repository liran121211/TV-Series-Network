1
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,910
Sure you don't want to go up today.

2
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:16,630
Now I'm gonna gather.

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,150
The kids and feed them. Okay.
I'll try not to stay up too long.

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,903
See ya.

5
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,363
Oh my God.

6
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:51,252
After the.

7
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,220
In the city ofs under of night,

8
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,060
people are drowned in the sea.

9
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,333
The.

10
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,860
Devils hold in your life. Online.

11
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,780
Rain for time.

12
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,540
After.

13
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,373
The.

14
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,780
Someone's gonna die.

15
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,839
Hi. Hi.

16
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,440
Wow. All shined up. We ready for business?

17
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,040
Good morning, ladies. Good
morning. Why are we here? Um,

18
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,370
oh.

19
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,520
They're here to find out if
they're gonna keep their jobs.

20
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,240
And.

21
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
We're here to meet the new
owner and to sign this lease.

22
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,200
DG Marco, what's uh, DG stand for? I.

23
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,920
Don't know, but whoever this Marco is,

24
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:17,960
he's done a really nice job
with renovating Lous place.

25
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,600
Take him inside. That's good.
Over by the bar. Why? Goodness.

26
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,880
Maybe we should have brought a present.

27
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,040
I don't know. It looks like somebody died.

28
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,640
Hi, I'm, uh, Mitch
Buchanan. And, uh, well,

29
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,600
if you're going to be one
of the new waitresses here,

30
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,320
let me assure you that you'll be getting
all of my business. Well, thank you.

31
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,880
Sugar. I'm the owner.

32
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,880
Oh. But I will appreciate your
business. You're DG Marco,

33
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,760
Please call me Donna. You must
be garner eler. B I must be.

34
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,240
And of course, Ryan McBride. Hello.

35
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,520
I use the initials in
business cuz it's easier.

36
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,120
Change.

37
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,680
Is good. I I like it here. I do. Yeah.

38
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:25,880
Oh, that's awfully sweet of him.
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. Hi girls.

39
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,320
Hey. Oh, you're also
lovely. Thank you so lot.

40
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,000
I think the customer should be paying
attention to you, not the prices. Oh,

41
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,880
that's so sweet. Those
uniforms have to go.

42
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,200
Oh, so do we. It's.

43
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Nice to meet you. Okay. All
right. See you later. Bye.

44
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,960
So their corporate controller is killed
in an accident and three days later they

45
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:07,120
have.

46
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,953
A party.

47
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,920
Evidently, the party was planned about
three months ago after these people,

48
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,600
their clients fall in
from all over the country.

49
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,080
Wall Street, big bucks.

50
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,313
Why you?

51
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,320
Because I'm an old friend
and a very good dancer.

52
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,520
Guess those dancing lessons paid off, huh?

53
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,400
Yeah.

54
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,320
And speaking.

55
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,360
Of getting paid, what are we doing here?

56
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,200
All work, work, work. Will you just
lighten up and a enjoy of the day?

57
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,143
Look it.

58
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm not real sure about this.

59
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,360
Don't worry, I won't. But.

60
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,920
You better not Well.

61
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,440
Not that hard anyway.

62
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,520
Hey Mitch. Oh, there.

63
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,840
There's that guy. Follow me.

64
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,040
Ah, ladies first. Hey yo.

65
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,600
Oh, thank you.

66
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,560
You look terrific. Thank you. You
too buddy. Yay. <laugh>. Ryan,

67
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:07,800
I'd like you to meet Red
and Deborah. This is my.

68
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,840
Pleasure. Nice meet. Hi. Nice to meet
too. It's a pleasure. Nice to meet you.

69
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,400
All.

70
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,200
Of us tried to got here.
Yeah. Well, you know,

71
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:15,800
we're just putting up a
good front for the clients.

72
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,880
We're all still pretty numb
about what happened to Doug.

73
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,600
Sorry to hear about that.
It's a terrible accident.

74
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,520
Mitch. We don't think what happened
to Doug was necessarily an accident.

75
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,440
Look.

76
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,960
Let's go grab a bite and we can talk.

77
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,640
Last month our senior legal
counsel died back east,

78
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:49,160
fell asleep in his hotel
room, smoking in bed.

79
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,320
You don't think that was
an accident either, Mitch.

80
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,400
This was a five star hotel.

81
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,360
The smoke detector in his
room mysteriously fails along
with the hotel sprinkler

82
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,200
system. I don't think so.

83
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,360
So you've had two deaths.

84
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,640
What.

85
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,410
Are the cops say?

86
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:09,320
We haven't pushed the police
as far as everyone's concerned.

87
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:12,360
These are two separate accidents.
We're a public company.

88
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,880
The press will crucify us.

89
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,360
It could be just that
a coincidence. Anyway,

90
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,480
Brian, we've known Mitch since high
school. We need someone we can trust.

91
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,400
Someone who'll be discreet.

92
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,920
If this is our imaginations, just
tell us. And what if it's not?

93
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,240
We'll take whatever you find the
authorities and push like hell.

94
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,920
So is this the kind of thing you can do?

95
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,600
Oh yeah, definitely.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,360
Great. I feel better already.

97
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,679
Oh, Wayne, can you start? Well, and.

98
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,880
It seems all your executives and
most of your clients are here.

99
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,600
So I'd say we can start tonight. That's.

100
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,433
Great.

101
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,913
Nick. Donald.

102
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,480
Hi. Hi. I've been looking.

103
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,720
For you too. Yeah, there's plenty
of time for that. First listen,

104
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,160
I want you to meet an old friend
of mine, Mitch Buchanan. Hi.

105
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:13,360
And his associate Ryan McBride.
Nikki Shater and Donald Janssen.

106
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:14,559
Two of Rankers best people.

107
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:18,480
Hello. Hello. Nice to meet you.
Bye. Very nice to meet you. Oops.

108
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:21,920
That's me. <laugh>. I gave a
couple of folks. Mom, Omaha,

109
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,640
my little Harbor tour tied off
and some other guy slipped. Uh,

110
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,920
sounds like he's back.

111
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,873
<Laugh>.

112
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,960
Looks like the buddy's working. Well,
the Tommy's a little awkward for us,

113
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:35,760
that's all. Well, Mitch and Ryan are gonna
help us find out what really happens.

114
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,840
Doug. Oh, the private investigators.

115
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:43,640
Look, I wish you the best of luck, but
I really must get out of this night.

116
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,480
Air my hate, fever's killing me.

117
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,480
Dawn. Well,

118
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,880
I'm sure glad we're finally getting
some help here. And um, listen,

119
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:58,120
if there's anything I can do, please
let me know. We'll let you know.

120
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,960
Uh, there are a couple other people
I'd like you to meet. See you later.

121
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,160
Nice to meet you. Have fun.

122
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,360
Well, you got.

123
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,193
Any ideas?

124
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,213
Not a clue.

125
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,283
9 1 1.

126
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,679
Hey. Hi. How's I doing?

127
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:51,200
It's hard to say. They've got him
so doped up, but Deborah's whooping.

128
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
She's been here all night.

129
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,160
What do the cops find? Anything?

130
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,160
They still think it's an accident.

131
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,520
They haven't made a connection
between the other two.

132
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,720
Oh, they will. I need to know
more about what goes on at Ranker.

133
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,559
Right now. I have an office full
of people waiting for me. Well.

134
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:10,640
Can you meet me later for dinner?

135
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,200
What's both threaten and
Deborah out of the loop.

136
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,240
I really do have my hands full.

137
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,160
Nick, I need some information.

138
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:20,720
And I don't think Debbie's up
to a lot of questions right now.

139
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:21,983
Like what?

140
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:25,720
Well start off with. Who,
why? What's the motive?

141
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,360
Think corporate sabotage.
Someone's trying to ruin us.

142
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:32,040
Set us up for a hostile takeover
by destroying our management.

143
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,760
Team. All right. That's the
motive. But who, I mean,

144
00:14:34,761 --> 00:14:36,760
who would want it bad
enough to kill three people?

145
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,160
I see what you mean. Okay. Where nights.

146
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,230
Love on the beach.

147
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,720
I'll find it. 10 o'clock.

148
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,080
10 O'clock. Thanks. Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

149
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,120
Hey, how's he doing?

150
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,240
We've got him from touching
God to holding his own.

151
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm afraid to ask anymore.

152
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,650
No. When RET and I were in college,

153
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,370
we played on the varsity water
polo team together. Right? Well,

154
00:15:19,371 --> 00:15:23,450
we were sophomores so we didn't
get much playing time. Well,

155
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:25,370
when re finally got a shot, he comes in,

156
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:29,330
he gets slammed to the side
of the pool by two seniors.

157
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,450
He broke his wrist. But you
knew he kept on playing.

158
00:15:33,451 --> 00:15:35,290
He didn't ask to be
taken down to the game.

159
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,290
Pat never told me that.

160
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,010
Kept on playing and he
scored two goals of this man

161
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,850
knows how to fight pain
and he knows how to win.

162
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,570
Cause no way he's gonna
lose his fight. Yeah,

163
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,970
but you gotta hang in and give him
all the strength. You can kill him.

164
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,803
I will.

165
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,690
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

166
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:10,450
So what'd you get from
the guys downtown Garner?

167
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,850
These were taken by the Malibu.
Sheriff's accident investigators.

168
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,130
Mm-hmm. <affirmative>. See this?
This is the aluminum glider strut.

169
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:22,890
You see these marks on
it? Mm-hmm. <affirmative>.

170
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,810
I don't think those are mal fatigue.

171
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,810
Are you saying that
somebody cut that hang.

172
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,970
Glider frame? That's possible. I
need to take a look at that strut.

173
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,930
Hey, did you know that Deborah
falls for divorce last year?

174
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,570
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.

175
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:39,690
But I also heard they patched
the whole thing up, but they.

176
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:40,800
Right.

177
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,130
Worked it out. What did the
police find at the marina?

178
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,530
Well, they pulled the boat up first thing
this morning. It was, uh, loose wires,

179
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,210
faulty fuel pump, leaky gas line.

180
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,450
Accident.

181
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,283
It looks like waited in.

182
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,690
Don't buy that at all.

183
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:56,370
Can you go in a favor downtown?

184
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:57,563
Probably.

185
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,570
Have him check for something sophisticated
like Gill Ignite or plastic laid

186
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:06,170
against the fuel tank and a
remote trigger, not a timer.

187
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,330
Well, that'll cost me a lot of
favors, but I'll see what I can do.

188
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,410
Also think I'll put in some undercover
time at Rain Corp. Pile around.

189
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,369
See if I can do up some dirt.

190
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:15,850
Gas, man again.

191
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,210
Oh, I think maybe telephone
man, this time. That's always.

192
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,210
Interesting. Very good. And you?

193
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,890
Well, I wanna find out what's
changed, Who's new, who's angry,

194
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,330
who profits, and who suffers
from all this. Great.

195
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:31,952
What about you?

196
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,290

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:34,890

Really a private dick.

201
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,090
Not my favorite choice of words.

202
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,730
I'm sorry. Would you like to sit down?

203
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:27,442
Uh, no thank you.

204
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,690
It's just you're the first woman that
I've met in this line of work. Uh,

205
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:32,290

Yes. She said to, uh, cooperate.

Um, pool table, bumper.

236
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,000
No regulation.

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:25,280
Competition. Size four and a half
by nine. Or bar size? Four by.

238
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,440
Eight. Four by eight.

239
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,573
You got it.

240
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,119
Just like that. Just.

241
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:30,952

00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:32,452
Why?

243
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,880
So you'll spend your time.

244
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,200
And spend your money.

Island?

253
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,400
No, strictly West coast.

254
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,800
Uh, I'll have the same bed.
Okay, so you have questions?

255
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,320
Yeah. Yeah. I got a few.

256
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,680
Do you have a list of suspects?

257
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,760
Well, I'm working on.

258
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,920
That. Am I on it?

259
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,840
Should you be?

260
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,760
Where did you get the
suspicious size police?

261
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,920
Fbi. Cia.

262
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,280
Uh, trying lifeguard.

263
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,480
<Laugh>. Lifeguard as in.

264
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,840
Beach as in the sand.

265
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,000
What's the connection between being
a lifeguard and doing pi work?

266
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,840
I don't know. Maybe I just
like helping people in trouble.

267
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,160
Ah, sounds like a white night complex.

268
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,080
Here's two nights of shining arm.

269
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,280
And damsels and distress.

270
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,560
Well, thanks again for coming, huh?

271
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:57,680
Wow. I hope I was up some
help. Anyway, I'm glad I came.

272
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,240
I needed to relax the.

273
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,359
Little relax. Must look at
your watch a dozen times.

274
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,233
For some habit.

275
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,160
Thank you. I feel a lot better knowing
that you and your team are on this case.

276
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,920
Hang on. I get it.

277
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,680
Have to wait until there are some
investigators. Uh, go through the rest of.

278
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,413
You. All right.

279
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,320
No, I'm not even close to, All right.

280
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,200
Police kept asking who wants to kill you?

281
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,280
Like I can pull out a list
or something, but you know,

282
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,000
then I kept thinking she's right. Someone,

283
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,320
someone I probably know wants me dead.

284
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,160
I'm scared I want to go home.

285
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,140
Maybe I can't go home.
Maybe it's not safe, right?

286
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,780
No, it's not safe.

287
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,710
I couldn't do much.

288
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,343
Come here.

289
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,550
There's a phrase that
lifeguards use. It's relax.

290
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,340
I gotcha. I gotcha. And if you want,

291
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,619
you can spend the night at my place
and I guarantee you'll be safe.

292
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,753
And tomorrow.

293
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,660
And tomorrow when the
sun comes up. We'll, uh,

294
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,660
we'll try and make some sense of
this. Make sure we keep you safe,

295
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,740
okay? Okay. Okay, let's go.

296
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:03,350
You.

297
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,750
Are quite the gentleman.

298
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,230
You.

299
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:34,700
Alright?

300
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,533
Yeah.

301
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,190
I heard you and Nikki was killed.

302
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,670
Exactly. Almost. We were almost killed.

303
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,990
Just enough time to get away.

304
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:44,800
Well, you were lucky.

305
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:48,560
Yeah, that's what I thought too. Except
the timing was just perfect. I mean,

306
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:52,840
it was too perfect. Other couple of
seconds, parts of me would be in Oxnard.

307
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,090
Do me a favor, Will you? We're
on a check on this and see.

308
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:00,109
If, uh, they can trigger
an explosion. Yeah.

309
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,760
Yeah.

310
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,593
No problem.

311
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,550
10 To one. I find you here.

312
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,710
Gee, there's a safe bet.
I got no life, Mitch.

313
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,430
I'm either with the federal building
or I'm here. Take it for me. Way out.

314
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,430
Sad, isn't it.

315
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,790
Breaking my heart? Your
buddy. I need a favor.

316
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:28,869
Official. No, actually off the
record, I'm gonna background check.

317
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,623
Very deep.

318
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,760
That's gonna cost you own
buddy. Desperate, lonely man.

It's need to meet a woman. Oh my.
Now you're surrounded by woman.

But you don't think so? Okay.
I run from get up to get gone.

Round five.

342
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,850
After five.

343
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,810
Evening.

344
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,643
Sir. Good evening.

345
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,490
Good evening. How?

346
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,513
Hello

347
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,913
sir?

348
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:38,630
Hey Don. I need a favor. There's
a guy I want you to meet.

349
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,190
A guy he want me to meet.

350
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,110
Uh, actually I said that
wrong. He wants to meet you.

351
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,590
It amounts to the same thing.

352
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,270
It's just an introduction.

353
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:52,110
Introduction leads to
conversation, to invitation.

354
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:57,550
Then it's dinner. He's
charming. We dance. He's cute.

355
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:02,390
He says this. I say that. We
leave. He wants to go to my.

356
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:05,310
Place. It's not like that. Really?
I mean, well not this time.

357
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,150
Okay, How about if I came to
you and said I wanna set you up.

358
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,230
All you gotta do is say hello Donna.

359
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,590
The guy did me a tremendous favor.

360
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,533
What favor?

361
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,350
I needed some information on
someone and he got it for me.

362
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,830
How's he able to do that?

363
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,590
Well, he works for the federal
government. Treasury department.

364
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,310
Treasury department.
Why didn't you say so?

365
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,063
Then you'll do it.

366
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:36,950
She'll do it.

367
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,080
So what'd you get on
Janssen? Carbon monoxide.

368
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,640
Turns out older. Less seric
acid in his humidifier.

369
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,280
They've got him in a hyperbaric chamber.
Tell you the cops all over this now.

370
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,353
Knee deep and rising.

371
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,080
You can, Yeah.

372
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,480
Well thank you very much. Yeah.
Yeah. I told you after five

373
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,460
Ned Jud.

374
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,293
The Fed.

375
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,760
I wrote a background
check on Nikki. Dirty.

376
00:33:09,761 --> 00:33:13,320
Looks like little Nick was in the
intelligence branch of the special forces.

377
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,560
The experts on sabotage and explosives.
Okay. She's got a working knowledge,

378
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:18,760
but, uh, what's the motive?

379
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:23,960
Father committed suicide. Turns out his
company was absorbed by rankers legally,

380
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,880
but uh.

381
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,280
She feels they steam more. Go revenge.

382
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,520
Hey guys, you were right.
This thing was modified.

383
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,480
I mean, it's not gonna
open any trucks. Bill.

384
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:36,680
Definitely light up the parking lot.

385
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,580
Get to the hospital and.

386
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,660
Uh, sit with Rick. Debbie.

387
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,700
She's got a condo at the marina.

388
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,533
Let's do it.

389
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,620
Nikki's really lost it, killing all those
people just to bring a company down.

390
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,020
Yeah. I just hope Debbie's
not her next victim.

391
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:06,820
You're crazy. Why are you doing this?

392
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:10,500
I said shut up. We can talk
this out. It's too late for.

393
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,900
That. Well.

394
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,780
You can get in the boat.

395
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,060
Come on. Come on. Move.

396
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,219
Sit down in the corner. What?
Sit down. God, you don't.

397
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,380
Have to do that. I'm never gonna
give you any trouble. I promise.

398
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:25,540
Yeah, that's what your
lawyer sold my father.

399
00:34:25,541 --> 00:34:27,660
Just before they bought him
out at 10 cents on the dollar

400
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,213
before they crushed him.

401
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,370
Taking into the water. Now
col looks back up. Huh?

402
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,753
What

403
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,793
you

404
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,693
It's a bomb.

405
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,320
It's ready to go off.
If it's pulled loose.

406
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,000
I kick it out.

407
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,280
Hang on, hang on. I'll get you out here.

408
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,072
Come,

409
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,163
go, go, go.

410
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,900
You okay now? Come on.

411
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,260
So you're telling me that she had
the chance to jump and didn't?

412
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,500
Yeah, I guess she knew it was over.

413
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,570
Oh.

414
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,403
That's heavy.

415
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:29,180
What's that thing about? Uh,
vengeance. You're alpha revenge.

416
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,380
Dig two graves one for yourself.

417
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,460
Uh, speaking of digging
a grave for yourself,

418
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
how's that deal with Donna coming along?

419
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,739
<Laugh>? I'm about to find out. Excuse me.

420
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,100
Hey.

421
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,933
Mitch.

422
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,940
Hey, say bud. How are you? I'm good.
I looked at you. You look terrific.

423
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:51,940
Oh my gosh. She's.

424
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,660
More incredible than.

00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,020

00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,300

here And what I'll do is I'll just,

427
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,260
you know, smooth things over. Let her
know you're here. Okay? Yeah. All buddy.

428
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,413
You look great. Nice.

429
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:06,610
Ah.

430
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,620
Excuse me. He's here.

431
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:10,920
Who?

432
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,753
Him?

433
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:13,730
Him?

434
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,540
Yeah. The.

435
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,260
Guy I told you he wanted to meet you.

436
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,340
Yeah. No, I don't think so.

437
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,700
Donna, you promised. No, I.

438
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,180
Didn't promise.

439
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,260
Okay. Well you didn't promise. But
look, the guy, gimme a huge favor.

440
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,340
Please don't let me down.

441
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,380
You know, it's very dangerous, this
business of meeting men in bars,

442
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:34,420
strange men, even familiar bars.
It always leads to problems.

443
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:37,900
Don't do this to me. Just an introduction.

444
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,340
Isn't that how it always starts?

445
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,100
How do we have this conversation?

446
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,860
And I'm still concerned.

447
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,460
Ah, did I mention he is with
the Treasury Department?

448
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:49,700
Yes. What if I find him interesting?

449
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,460
Are you messing with me?

450
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,940
I don't know. Am I?

451
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,633
You owe me.

452
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,380
Hi Ned, right?

453
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,040
Uhhuh.

454
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,620
I'm Donna. Welcome tonight.
Thanks. Pleasure to meet you. My.

455
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:16,980
Mind.

456
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,260
Nine too. Mitch tells me you're
a man in the know. Oh really?

457
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,700
Well, not, not exactly.

458
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,380
Well one thing you learn running a
bar, confident, good looking men.

459
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,219
Never have to brag. I
love that. It's very sexy.

460
00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:32,860
So this is your first time at
night. It's allow me to buy your.

461
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,440
First. Oh, thanks. Have you
seen the patio? Oh, you love it.

462
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,840
So the department is that likers

463
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,520
only reason that I

00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,400
blow dreams. There's a,

465
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:13,200
