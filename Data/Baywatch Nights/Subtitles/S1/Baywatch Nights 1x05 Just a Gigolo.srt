00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,330

6
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,940
it words

7
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,290
six months ago I met a man at the

8
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,750
mission club his name is Grant Stiles

9
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,000
handsome charming and very young we

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
started seeing each other and before I

11
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,890
knew it he had swept me off my feet

12
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,329
god this is humiliating

13
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:35,640
it's okay Julie we're friends well first

14
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,409
I started giving him little gifts you

15
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:40,829
know weekend trips to a white and we

16
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,900
became very close so when he asked me

17
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,730
for money to invest in this business I

18
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:53,190
didn't hesitate how much $100,000 what

19
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,409
kind of business was this I don't know

20
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,620
some sort of investment company then he

21
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,180
said he had lost the money in the stock

22
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,519
market and could he have some more well

23
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,739
I told him no and then when he stopped

24
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,389
seeing me I realized he was some sort of

25
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:09,959
gigolo well the problem is he hasn't

26
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,540
broken any laws yeah I know I know but

27
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,159
you know I found out I wasn't his only

28
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,139
victim and that's why I'm here I just

29
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,819
don't want him preying on other lonely

30
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:25,319
women okay what do we care yeah where is

31
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,919
this guy now at the Mission Club to

32
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:31,139
catch a gigolo I decided to become a

33
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:33,569
gigolo so I worked out a little harder

34
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:35,760
that week borrowed from serious threads

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,569
copped an attitude and voila

mission club that Margo the social

42

there Marga was somehow in on the action

45
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:41,599

00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,939

the hill yet living in a town of hard
