1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:03,303
Hope
you're ready to howl.

2
00:00:03,336 --> 00:00:04,137
On this show,

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:05,405
we're bringing you

4
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:08,208
more of the hysterical
animal clips you love,

5
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,177
including a crazy catastrophe,

6
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,313
a fast food freeloader,

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,949
and improbable punk quick guard,

8
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:18,318
and a daughter-doggy dance.

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,854
You're watching "World's
Funniest Animals."

10
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,823
Hey, and welcome
to another episode

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,725
of "World's Funniest Animals."

12
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,128
I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton.

13
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,996
Today I'm joined by
my trusty psychics,

14
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,197
Hank and Ruby,

15
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,233
and a few friends,
and panelists,

16
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,901
as well as our celebrity guest,

17
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,002
Jennifer Veal.

18
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,037
- Hi, everyone.

19
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,605
Happy to be here.

20
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,874
I cannot wait to see what
we have in store tonight.

21
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:42,308
- Thanks for being
here, Jennifer.

22
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,576
On tonight's show,

23
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,211
we've got more of the
stuff you love the most.

24
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,715
Silly animal videos that
are sure to make you laugh.

25
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:51,684
Plus plenty of animals
that are just plain cute.

26
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,254
Brought to you with commentary
from our first panelists,

27
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,256
actor Carmen Hodson.

28
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,757
- Hey, Liz.

29
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:00,527
- This next part features some
adorable animal affection.

30
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,661
- This sounds really good.

31
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,943
This is so adorable.

32
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,885
- Our next panelist is
the amazing comedian,

33
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,353
Brian Cooper.

34
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,621
- Hey Liz.

35
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,957
- We have some animal
cuddling in this clip.

36
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,059
- I do not think
I can handle this.

37
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:43,036
And this was when they started
as best friends for life.

38
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,341
- Now we are joined by
actor, writer, producer,

39
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,176
Noah Matthews.

40
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,478
- Hey, Liz.

41
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,546
- We have some animals
cuddling in this clip.

42
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,849
- I love these kinds of videos.

43
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,659
The most comfortable
pillow in the room

44
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:07,961
is your brother's head.

45
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,166
- For our final panelist,

46
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,802
we have singer, actor,
comedian, radio host,

47
00:02:15,835 --> 00:02:16,769
Mikalah Gordon.

48
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,338
- Hi, Liz.

49
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,572
- Are you ready for an animal

50
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,007
who just wants to
give some love?

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,208
- What?

52
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,710
I need to see this.

53
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,390
Look at his butt.

54
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,459
Look at him trying to get out.

55
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,298
- We're back with a fan favorite

56
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,299
"Hidden Talent."

57
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,851
- Another slam dog,

58
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:09,556
I am on fire!

59
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,294
- Okay, I've never
done this before.

60
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,262
Is this how you stand on it?

61
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:17,330
It's getting bro, move over,

62
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,198
I'm gonna ride.

63
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,448
Look mom, no hands!

64
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,088
- This dog is better
balanced than me.

65
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,770
- She just couldn't find

66
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,439
another dance
partner her height.

67
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,344
- It's that time again,

68
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,145
where we visit a celebrity
guest in their home

69
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,513
and get to know their pet.

70
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,649
Tonight's celebrity
guest is my good friend,

71
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,583
Jennifer Veal.

72
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,452
from "Jessie" and "This Just In"

73
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,286
Hey, Jenny.

74
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,454
Thanks for being here.

75
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,688
- Hey, Liz.

76
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,223
- I see you have
someone there with you.

77
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,258
Tell us about them.

78
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,994
- This is called Melina,

79
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,895
also known as Lilly for sure.

80
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,831
And she is quite a diva,

81
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,332
but she's my best
little friend.

82
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,567
Aren't you?

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,302
- Have you ever worked
with any animals on set?

84
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,837
- Lizzie, I don't know how we...

85
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,238
I haven't thought this before,

86
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,874
but you and I have had
an animal encounter.

87
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,342
When we were in India,

88
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,911
we went to the Monkey Temple.

89
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,780
And I was on the
impression that maybe

90
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,384
like one, two, three monkeys.

91
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,119
No, that wasn't,

92
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,053
was that, Lizzie?

93
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,855
There was about 5,000 monkeys

94
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:50,990
climbing on top of my head.

95
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,825
Picking things out of my hair.

96
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,261
I think I have a picture of
one on my head somewhere,

97
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,630
but I mean, it was an
amazing experience.

98
00:04:57,664 --> 00:04:59,999
- Hey Jenny, can your
dog do any tricks for us?

99
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,100
- Yes, Lizzie.

100
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,036
She does Lizzie,

101
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,071
and I'm so glad he loves.

102
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:05,938
Lilly,

103
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,342
do as you please.

104
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:14,614
See, she's really good
at doing if she pleases.

105
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,182
That's whatever she wants.

106
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,952
Oh, Lilly, of course
you're very cute.

107
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,288
- Thanks so much for
stopping by, Jenny.

108
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,723
Coming up,

109
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,025
we have pets who are
clearly the jealous type.

110
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,260
That's not me.

111
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,696
Next on "World's
Funniest Animals."

112
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:39,772
They can't talk,

113
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,007
but if they could,

114
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,042
these next pets can
definitely be saying,

115
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,677
"Hey, that's not me."

116
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,098
- Okay, this dog is like,

117
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,966
"I'm the only one freaked out.

118
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:08,768
Guys, it's a tiger!"

119
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:17,844
- Wait for it.

120
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,249
Peekaboo.

121
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,146
- Just a little closer.

122
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,981
Oh, come on, I dare you.

123
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:56,749
Oh, you're lucky,
I can't reach you.

124
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,251
Oh, okay, too close.

125
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:04,090
- To be young and in love.

126
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:06,292
Here's our absolutely
adorable segment,

127
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,994
"Puppy Love."

128
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:15,735
- Oh, this is so cute.

129
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,537
But little do we know,

130
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,772
they were playing
with glue before this.

131
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:23,543
Super glue.

132
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,461
This is cuteness overload.

133
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:02,415
- I can't tell if this bear
is nice or this guy is insane.

134
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:08,721
- See, this is always
one of those videos

135
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,656
they show after the fact.

136
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,105
- I have no idea
what's going on here,

137
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:27,640
but I just know it's cute.

138
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,279
And just
in case you cat lovers

139
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,514
are feeling left out,

140
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:36,549
we present for your enjoyment,

141
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,185
a montage of cozy kitties.

142
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,162
- Oh, little
baby kittens!

143
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,510
He's hugging her arm.

144
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,093
Not yet, you're not
done petting me.

145
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,396
I will tell you
when you're done.

146
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,632
- Coming up,

147
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:30,069
these pets have been
caught red handed, guilty.

148
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:32,305
Next on "World's
Funniest Animals."

149
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,783
Do you guys have
a good poker face

150
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:46,986
or can someone usually
tell when you're lying?

151
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,622
Well, while some may be
good at hiding their shame,

152
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:52,325
others wear it right
on their faces,

153
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:55,595
like the animals in our
next segment, "Guilty."

154
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,340
- Yeah, I was wondering
why the housekeeping

155
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,442
at this hotel was so bad.

156
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,782
- Yeah he ran out of the
little mince an hour ago,

157
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:17,950
now he's just eating soap.

158
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,264
He stole it.

159
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,000
- When he can't eat just one.

160
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:40,139
The only way to
show you what just happened

161
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,340
is by video.

162
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,611
Charlie got the yogurt

163
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,181
and ran with it,

164
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:53,486
and the yogurt was.

165
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,589
- Man, this guy's
house is a pig sty.

166
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,993
Oh my God, what a mess!

167
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,029
- That I think is,

168
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:05,097
this guy has four pigs
that live with him,

169
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,966
and he's surprised
they made a mess.

170
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,578
- Do you think this
has happened before,

171
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,080
or does this person just always

172
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,715
wanna keep an eye on his fridge?

173
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,593
- I don't know what's weird.

174
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,796
The fact that this man was
gonna swallow a whole fish,

175
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,498
or that the bird instead
went for the fries.

176
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:46,872
- To our pets, we
are the whole world.

177
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,842
We feed them, walk
them, take care of them.

178
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,910
So naturally,

179
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:52,945
they can be a bit possessive.

180
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,458
- There can be only one.

181
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,176
- Oh, not sure which is worse.

182
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,146
The fact that this cat
is jealous of everything

183
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,483
or that this woman
pets household items.

184
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:49,935
- Think about it this way,

185
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:52,371
if your girlfriend met
an exact puppet of you

186
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:54,039
and started going
on dates with it,

187
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,007
how would you feel?

188
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,678
- Puppy giving kisses.

189
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:00,846
Hi, puppy.

190
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,384
Give me a kiss.

191
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,090
Give Annie a kiss now.

192
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,829
You are not a person.

193
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:17,763
He's not a person,

194
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,665
but he does have feelings,

195
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,900
like jealousy.

196
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,901
No, no, no.

197
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:45,090
Hey, hey,
don't eat the camera.

198
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,091
- Really?

199
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,926
Really.

200
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:49,662
That's my camera.

201
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,465
That's not funny.

202
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,237
It's expensive.

203
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:06,212
Hey, Riches, Riches.

204
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,112
- Really?

205
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,013
Really.

206
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,084
- You won't believe some
of the amazing tricks

207
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,485
people's pets can do.

208
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,189
"Mad Skillz" next on
"World's Funniest Animals."

209
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:28,367
Welcome back.

210
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,803
You're just in time for one
of my favorite segments,

211
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,906
where we get a close look at
some pretty, skilled critters.

212
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,175
I mean, very skilled,

213
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,576
"Mad Skillz."

214
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:54,727
- This is taking bobbing for
apples to a whole new level.

215
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,263
More like launching for apples.

216
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,177
- Oh yes, you guessed it.

217
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,545
The downward dog.

218
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,289
- I feel so relaxed.

219
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,628
Beer me.

220
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:40,806
Good, shut the door.

221
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:43,075
Shut the door.

222
00:15:44,476 --> 00:15:46,478
Can you give me a crizy?

223
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:49,581
Good boy.

224
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,450
Here, throw this away.

225
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,319
Throw it away.

226
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,186
Throw it away.

227
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,388
Good, here.

228
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,559
Go throw it away.

229
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:01,727
Throw it away.

230
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,564
Oh, good, throw it away.

231
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,399
Good, shut this door.

232
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,334
Shut it.

233
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:09,635
Good boy.

234
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,071
- This is every man's dream dog.

235
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,540
- Now it just needs to
learn to order pizza.

236
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,594
- Okay, my favorite
part about this

237
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,696
is when the other dog
whites out on a surf board,

238
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,899
and then so he jumps
onto his friend's board.

239
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,472
- These next pets
have been caught

240
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,639
red handed.

241
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,919
- I told you the toilet
paper goes over not under.

242
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:13,632
- Well, next time
you get the creamer.

243
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:18,871
- Yoink!

244
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,182
Oh, snap!

245
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,436
- This seems pretty calm

246
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,871
until the other monkey
jumped on the camera.

247
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,614
- How many bananas
does this guy have?

248
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,458
- Oh my God!

249
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,059
Wait for it.

250
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,160
Wait for it.

251
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,767
- I told you not to
vlog while driving.

252
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,001
Now that's what you get.

253
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,504
- Teddy.
- Teddy,

254
00:18:25,537 --> 00:18:26,638
what did you do?

255
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,940
What did you do?

256
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:29,708
- Teddy, come on.
- You bad girl.

257
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,343
Hey, what happened here?

258
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:32,744
What happened here?

259
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,880
- What happened?
- Who did it?

260
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:35,848
Who did it?

261
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,989
- Well, that's almost ii for us,

262
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,557
but just in case
you missed anything,

263
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,961
here's a quick recap of
all the funniest moments.

264
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:50,095
Possessive pooches,

265
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,497
a resentful reptile,

266
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,397
cuddling cats,

267
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,499
a swindling seagull,

268
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,867
a Yogi Yorkie,

269
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,802
a monkey misappropriating
room service,

270
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,103
a dancing dog,

271
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,707
and a German shepherd
who can just about fly.

272
00:19:09,114 --> 00:19:11,483
That's it for this episode of
"World's Funniest Animals."

273
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,252
A special thanks to our panel

274
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,554
and to our celebrity
guest, Jennifer Veal,

275
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,156
for joining us and talking

276
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,490
all things animals.

277
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,625
- Oh, and thanks Liz.

278
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,760
It was our pleasure.

279
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:23,462
- I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton,

280
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,797
and I'll be back with
more hilarious videos

281
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,866
on "World's Funniest Animals."

282
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,767
See you then.
