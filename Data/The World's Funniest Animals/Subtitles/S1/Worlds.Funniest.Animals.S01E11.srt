1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:05,372
- Time to plop down
after a long day

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,806
because today on the show,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,042
we have karate kicking cats,

4
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,679
a helicoptery hamster,
a turtle taxi,

5
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,181
and a floor sweeping fowl.

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,716
Settle in for a good laugh,

7
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,819
because you're watching
World's Funniest Animals.

8
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,357
Welcome back to World's
Funniest Animals,

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,559
I'm your host Elizabeth Stanton.

10
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,395
Today I'm joined by
my trusty sidekicks,

11
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,362
Hank and Ruby

12
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,431
and a few friends and panelists

13
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,534
as well as our celebrity
guest, Kelli Goss.

14
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,137
- Hi guys, we're so
happy to be here.

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,104
We're excited to see

16
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:39,305
what you have in store tonight.

17
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,573
- Thanks for being here Kelli.

18
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,808
We're bringing you
some of the best

19
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,943
animal bloopers you've
ever laid eyes on,

20
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:47,213
but enough talking about
them let's get started.

21
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,882
You know while it's always
nice to have friends

22
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,216
with things in common,

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,085
sometimes it's nice
to learn from others

24
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:54,187
who come from
different backgrounds.

25
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,922
I'm not sure if that's
what these animals

26
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:56,956
had in mind,

27
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,691
but check out these odd pairings

28
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,428
on this segment
opposites attract.

29
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:02,896
Brought to you with commentary

30
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,165
from our first
panelist actor, writer,

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,934
director and musician,
Maiara Walsh.

32
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,103
- Hey Liz, show me what you got.

33
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,438
- Are you writing
for some animals

34
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,273
you would not expect
to be friends?

35
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,375
- Sounds like my
new favorite clip.

36
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,017
This could be seen as cute

37
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,119
or the cat version
of me falling asleep

38
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:28,455
with a bag of chips on my lap.

39
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,259
- For your next clip

40
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,995
we have the hilarious
comedian, Brian Cooper.

41
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,631
- Hi Liz, this is gonna be good.

42
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,488
This cat is a dog whisper.

43
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,669
- Now we have musician,

44
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,072
singer songwriter,
Brandon Rogers.

45
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,306
- I'm so pumped

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,041
I cannot wait to see
what we have tonight.

47
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:23,143
- Are you ready

48
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,044
for some interspecies
friendships?

49
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,248
- Well don't keep me
waiting, this I have to see.

50
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,626
when you cuddle with
your best friend.

51
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:47,934
I can't tell who's
enjoying this more,

52
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:49,736
the dog or the cat.

53
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,138
- For our final panelist

54
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,873
we have singer actor comedian

55
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:55,909
radio host, Mikalah Gordon.

56
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,410
- What's going on, Liz?

57
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,646
What clips do you
have for me tonight?

58
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,933
Ah love is love, no
matter what species.

59
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,483
- Who doesn't love nestling
with a little kitten.

60
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,792
This taxi service is so slow.

61
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,998
- At this rate, I'll
reach my food bowl

62
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,132
by next week.

63
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,236
- I'm pretty amazed
that so many animals

64
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,905
seem to be skilled
escape artists.

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,208
Uh-oh, someone sound the alarm,

66
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,144
we've got another set
of jailbreak videos.

67
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,283
- Good boy.

68
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,233
- Not sure why this
guy left me a ladder.

69
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,250
- No, I can
fit it, you're wrong.

70
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:18,851
I just need to
move a little more

71
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:22,288
and there you go, like a glove.

72
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,232
- Now this is an
actual jailbreak.

73
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,504
Not exactly a high
speed pursuit.

74
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,010
- It's that time again

75
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,846
where we visit a celebrity
guest in their home

76
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,214
and get to know their pet.

77
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,449
From The Ranch and The
Young and the Restless

78
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:25,084
Kelli Goss. Hey Kelly,

79
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,185
who do you have there with you?

80
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,721
- Yeah, this is Teddie Sue,

81
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,356
this is my little rescue dog,

82
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,360
she's about a year old
and she's still a pup,

83
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,295
so she's got lots
and lots of energies,

84
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,231
you can see, she can
barely sit still,

85
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,501
but she is the light of my life.

86
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:43,069
- Hey, in your
time as an actress,

87
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:44,971
have you ever worked
with an animal on set?

88
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,239
- Working on the ranch,

89
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,940
we had animals on
set all the time,

90
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,710
every type, every size,

91
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,945
and one time I had a
scene with Sam Elliott

92
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,714
who I love and a cow,

93
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,982
and it was supposed
to be a really

94
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,917
sentimental scene
and really sweet.

95
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,685
But the entire time, the cow,

96
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:00,887
I guess had taken a liking

97
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,588
to the shirt tied
around my waist

98
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,490
and was nighing on
it the whole scene.

99
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,193
So, I'm trying to be all
sweet and into the scene

100
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,829
and I just feel this
cow tugging on me,

101
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:11,197
and then after every tape

102
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,398
we'd have to replace the shirt

103
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,167
because it had just been
chewing on the shirt

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,701
and getting it sopping wet.

105
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,104
- Hey Kelli, does Teddie Sue

106
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,839
have any cool tricks to show us?

107
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,140
- She's kind of a wild child

108
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,575
but here look, wanna
show them a trick,

109
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,810
can you sit?

110
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,511
Hey Teddie, can you
give me both paws?

111
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,181
Can you give me both paws?

112
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,216
Oh, give me both

113
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,318
yeah, good girl.

114
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,387
- That's awesome. Thanks
for coming on Kelli,

115
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,055
and thank you Teddie Sue.

116
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,125
We have some animals
going along for the ride

117
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,828
coming up on World's
Funniest Animals.

118
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,271
You know how your pet

119
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,307
never wants you to
leave the house,

120
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,342
well, this next segment
is full of clips

121
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,045
that show how they might
try to catch up with us

122
00:07:59,078 --> 00:08:00,513
when we do.

123
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,217
You'll see what I mean
in along for the ride.

124
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:17,463
- Bird on a wire, no bird
on a windshield wiper.

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,835
Does this count as
distracted driving?

126
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,431
- Housework is so tiring.

127
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,686
- Don't you hate when
the plane just circles

128
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,755
the tarmac? Land already.

129
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,960
- Some pets are just
big balls of energy.

130
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:24,196
And these next clips
showcase exactly that,

131
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,032
here's flipping out.

132
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,211
- Men, this cat gets some air.

133
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,756
- Be quite, they will
notice we are here

134
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,092
telling you be quiet.

135
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,796
- This kitten was waiting

136
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,898
for the perfect
moment to strike.

137
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,440
- We need to see
that in slow mo.

138
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,754
- Oh my Gog, that
was a bad move.

139
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,558
- Okay, this dolphin

140
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,927
is totally showing
off these surfers.

141
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:43,843
- Sneak attack.

142
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,316
- Stay tuned, you
don't wanna miss

143
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,652
the hilarious pets coming up.

144
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,953
- We'll be right back

145
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,521
with more World's
Funniest Animals.

146
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,432
- They may be worlds apart

147
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:08,768
but these interspecies
relationships

148
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:13,072
are thriving. Here's
a world of difference.

149
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:25,184
- This dog will not give
up on hitting this bird.

150
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,086
Stand up for yourself.

151
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,005
- What are you
doing with a kitten

152
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,343
- I'm not sure if we
should be concerned or not

153
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:04,757
- Dog riding a horse,
what's weird about that.

154
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,044
- I love him and squeeze him

155
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,546
and pet him so gently.

156
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:39,058
- When your normal stylist
is booked you adapt.

157
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,795
- This monkey loves this kitten.

158
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,670
- Our pets may be domesticated,

159
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,339
but that doesn't mean
they won't always try

160
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,508
and run wild, planned escape.

161
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:41,086
- Those metal
squares are so small

162
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,788
who would guess that?

163
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,609
- Okay, as soon
as he steps in

164
00:14:03,642 --> 00:14:07,413
I pull the string,
almost, one more step

165
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,950
and I'll pull it, the rope broke

166
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:12,284
I'm out of here.

167
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,854
- Never try to trap
a flying squirrel.

168
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,831
- It's mostly fur weight.

169
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,574
- Trust me man.

170
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,509
This gate is made
from stainless steel.

171
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,578
Nothing can penetrate this cage.

172
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,716
- We've one of my
favorite categories

173
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:46,352
up next on World's
Funniest Animals.

174
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,763
Imagine if you lived in a world

175
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,398
where you couldn't communicate

176
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,867
how you felt to
anyone around you

177
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,369
how would you act?

178
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,104
The animals in
this next segment,

179
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:08,841
give us a few good
options. Losing it.

180
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,726
- I got it, I got it,

181
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,095
I don't got it.

182
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,244
- Look mom, did you see it?

183
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,713
Okay, I'll do it again.
Are you watching?

184
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:51,517
Okay, oh, okay. I'm
starting to get dizzy.

185
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,894
- I've been excited to relax

186
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:05,597
but this dog is taking
it to the extreme.

187
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:19,445
- But you won't escape
my signature move.

188
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,312
The jump in land.

189
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:41,000
- Ride sharing is so
popular these days

190
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,068
even our pets are car pooling.

191
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:00,185
- Let your tongue hang loose.

192
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,904
- Okay, go forward.

193
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:22,207
Now right, now head
over to the sun.

194
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:24,143
Yeah, yeah that's the spot.

195
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,157
- We agreed, you do the dishes

196
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,125
and I do the floor.

197
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,373
- Okay, now I want a hamster.

198
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,942
I had no clue they
had pilot licenses.

199
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,317
- The hamster is
the double threat.

200
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,519
He's cute, he's a pilot,

201
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,954
it sounds like all
my girlfriends list

202
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,022
of their perfect guy.

203
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,043
- Oh guys, you know those days

204
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,278
you just can't seem
to get anything done

205
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,948
and it feels like you have
a monkey on your back.

206
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,721
- Well, that's almost it for us,

207
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:44,590
but just in case
you missed anything

208
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,691
here's a quick recap

209
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,726
of all of our funniest moments,

210
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,095
a breakout bunny,
a dastardly dog,

211
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,563
two adorable best friends,

212
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:53,832
a good old fashioned
dog and pony show,

213
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,168
a hovering hamster,
calisthenic cats,

214
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:57,569
daring dolphins, and a bird

215
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,304
who has decided to
hitchhike their way

216
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:02,674
into their final destination,
wherever that is.

217
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:12,184
That's all for now, a
special thanks to our panel

218
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,086
and our celebrity
guest Kelli Goss

219
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,156
for joining us on
World's Funniest Animals.

220
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:18,724
- Thanks so much for having us,

221
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,993
bye guys, say bye Teddie.

222
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,195
- I'm your host
Elizabeth Stanton,

223
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:24,463
and I'll see you back here

224
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,564
as soon as I can come up

225
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,233
with some more
hilarious animal clips.

226
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:30,936
Thanks for watching
