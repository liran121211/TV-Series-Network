1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,203
- Get ready to laugh

2
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:06,039
because today on the show,
we have a hopping husky,

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:10,577
a doting duck, a canine
with cowboy aspirations

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,679
and a photogenic flamingo.

5
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:14,647
These clips and
much more to come

6
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,516
here on World's
Funniest Animals.

7
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:22,789
Hey there and welcome to
World's Funniest Animals.

8
00:00:22,822 --> 00:00:24,758
I'm your host Elizabeth Stanton

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,694
and these are my trusty
sidekicks, Hank and Ruby.

10
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:30,497
Joined today with a few of
my friends and panelists,

11
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,900
as well as a celebrity
guest, James Maslow.

12
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:34,868
- Hey everybody?

13
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,403
Blue and I are happy to be here.

14
00:00:36,436 --> 00:00:38,872
And we're excited to see
what is in store tonight.

15
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:40,473
- Thanks for being here, James.

16
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,509
Our pets are so cute

17
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,711
that we just wanna
kiss and squeeze them

18
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:47,380
because we can't stand
at how cuddly they are,

19
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:50,350
but sometimes they just
wanna be left alone.

20
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:51,718
Let's take a look
at what happens

21
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:53,019
when animals feel like

22
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,588
their personal space
has been invaded,

23
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,057
Don't mess with me.

24
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,859
Brought to you with commentary
from our first panelist

25
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,163
actor, writer, director
and musician Maiara Walsh.

26
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,464
- Hey Liz.

27
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:05,832
Thank you so much for having me,

28
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,368
I'm so excited to
watch these clips.

29
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,271
- This video shows us a
dog owner taking a selfie

30
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,106
with their less
than pleased pet.

31
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:14,607
- Now if an animal is angry,

32
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,044
I'm making a 180 and getting
out of there immediately.

33
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:18,878
- Hey selfie ready?

34
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,313
Go!

35
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,414
- I mean, what could go wrong?

36
00:01:26,653 --> 00:01:29,389
- For your next clip we
have the hilarious comedian,

37
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,490
Brian Cooper.

38
00:01:30,523 --> 00:01:31,958
- Hey Liz.

39
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,193
I'm happy to be here ready
for some funny clips.

40
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,327
Let's do this!

41
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,203
Play stupid games,
win stupid prizes.

42
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,676
- Now we are joined with one
of my favorite comedians,

43
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:50,543
Neel Ghosh.

44
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,845
- Hey Liz?

45
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,480
- We have a video
with an angry goat

46
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,715
and a girl trying to
take a video with him.

47
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,585
- Angry goat, brave girl.

48
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,919
Can't wait to see
how this turns out.

49
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,829
- It's trying to
head pat me bro.

50
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,834
- That's a concussion.

51
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:16,970
- It's trying to
head pat me bro.

52
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,341
- And now our final panelist,
actress, Carmen Hodgson.

53
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:22,275
- Hey Liz?

54
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,511
Yes, I'm so excited for these

55
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,714
because animal videos are
seriously my favorite videos.

56
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,194
Next time bring the carrots!

57
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,032
When this guy
is asked how he relaxes,

58
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:47,333
he pets his little dog

59
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,836
who is clearly not a
fan of being touched.

60
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,604
- You see petting your dog

61
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:54,941
is one of the most relaxing
things you can possibly do.

62
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:59,946
It releases a hormone called
oxytocin, which reduces stress.

63
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,583
Also it lowers your heart rate

64
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,486
and it lowers your
blood pressure.

65
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,423
Plus people who pet their dogs
are five times more likely

66
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:13,326
to live longer than
people who just have cats.

67
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,595
Plus--

68
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,997
- Some of my favorite movies
feature a great escape,

69
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,433
with the main character
against all odds

70
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,235
manages to sneak away.

71
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:25,338
These animals must have similar
tastes in entertainment.

72
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,573
Here is Jailbreak.

73
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,889
Okay, can we get a freeze
frame on that face?

74
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,600
Cats are pretty genius!

75
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,767
Easy.

76
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,369
He does this every day.

77
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,837
- Where there's a
will there's a way.

78
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,020
- Not even a thank
you from the dog.

79
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,065
- So the myth that
cats don't have bones

80
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,201
obviously it's true,
there's no way.

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,041
- On today's episode,

82
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:37,810
we've got James Maslow
from Big Time Rush.

83
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,179
We love animals,
you love animals

84
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,116
tell me, have you ever worked
with any animals on set?

85
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:45,418
- You remember a
film with a snake?

86
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,653
It was an episode
of Big Time Rush

87
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:49,656
it had this huge
yellow boa constrictor

88
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,590
something around there.

89
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,325
- A boa constrictor?

90
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,960
You're braver than I am James.

91
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,395
- I'm not a huge fan of snakes.

92
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,130
And they're like, oh
always cool I'm like okay,

93
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:59,198
I'll take one for the
team and I'll do it.

94
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,533
We did like three or four takes

95
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,602
and he started
tightening a little more.

96
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,472
Eventually I just had to stop
it honestly freaked me out.

97
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:10,543
It was a nice snake, but like
there's still wild reptiles,

98
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:15,581
I don't know, I just don't need
a, eight foot snake murder.

99
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,651
- If you think that's funny,
just wait for what's coming up.

100
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,721
We have a robotic cat
feeder, a dumbfounded dog

101
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:25,458
and a horse who has decided
it's time to leave the stable.

102
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,161
All these and more, next on
World's Funniest Animals.

103
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:39,505
Getting excited to eat

104
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,941
is definitely something
I can relate to,

105
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:44,777
but these animals take
it to another level.

106
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,580
The hunger is real
in this next segment

107
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,649
when it's Dinner time.

108
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,933
- You know what would
make this clip better?

109
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:07,867
Skates.

110
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:20,580
Hello?

111
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:22,548
I would like to speak
to your manager.

112
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,596
- Wow!

113
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,064
Way too much time on your hands?

114
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:48,174
How the cat clearly
terrified clearly horrified,

115
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,709
please why don't
you just feed me?

116
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,316
- Variety is the spice of life.

117
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,586
These next animals would
have to agree in our segment,

118
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,121
Opposites attract.

119
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,766
- Okay, this has to be
one of the cutest things

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,234
I've ever seen.

121
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,904
No offense Blue you are
out there too but you saw it.

122
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,047
- No, that is a baby goat.

123
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,849
Hey look, it's Tom Brady's son.

124
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,058
When did this scene of
Harry Potter come out?

125
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,373
- Aaaw cute!

126
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,383
- How's it going James?

127
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,718
- All right Blue?

128
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:08,087
Or just say hi, wave, hi.

129
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,522
- Blue seems like a good boy.

130
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,823
Does he know any tricks?

131
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,159
- He didn't learn a
whole lot of obedience

132
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,760
wherever he was before this.

133
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:17,497
Blue is good though
at walks and runs,

134
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,732
we do like six or
seven miles a day

135
00:08:19,765 --> 00:08:22,068
'cause he is a gigantic beast.

136
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,936
He's also good at eating things,

137
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,540
whether it's food in his
bowl or food on your plate,

138
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:30,610
or your socks or your hands

139
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:32,845
when you give him
out for a snack,

140
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,615
he might just eat
those, kidding, kidding

141
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,984
but also not kidding.

142
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,218
What else is he good at?

143
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:43,990
Annoying Dad!

144
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,725
He's so good at annoying me.

145
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,963
- Even more surprises
from the animal kingdom

146
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,266
when we come with
World's Funniest Animals.

147
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:06,012
Don't you hate when you're stuck
at home with nothing to do?

148
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,446
I know I do.

149
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,650
Sometimes you just gotta
escape and get some fresh air,

150
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,152
turns out animals
feel the same way

151
00:09:13,185 --> 00:09:16,689
as we found out in this next
segment, Planned escape.

152
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:24,330
- Oh, that's flexible!

153
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:26,165
That's how you know
yoga is paying off.

154
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,178
- The stable door is securely
locked because otherwise

155
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,279
the horse would just,

156
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:43,482
nevermind.

157
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,260
- That's a high fence!

158
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,228
I know humans that
couldn't climb that.

159
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,168
- If this dog jumps,
I'm gonna flip out.

160
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,236
Don't do it!

161
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,404
Don't do it!

162
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,839
Don't jump.

163
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:08,107
Owh, okay.

164
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,911
- And he clears it, okay.

165
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,461
If I can just squeeze.

166
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,098
There's gotta be a way
to get out of here.

167
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,799
Hold on wait a second.

168
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,501
There it is!

169
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,736
I knew I shouldn't
have that last snack.

170
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,184
Cats can open doors,
escape through windows.

171
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,486
If you have a cat,

172
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,320
you just need to be
contained with them

173
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,287
going where they want.

174
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:58,924
- Sometimes you just
wanna be left alone.

175
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,594
Everyone needs to recharge
every once in a while

176
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:03,729
and our pets are no exception.

177
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:05,531
Take a look at
these grumpy animals

178
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:08,134
in our segment, Up the wall.

179
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,935
- Trying to get a
selfie with you.

180
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,574
- Flamingo slap!

181
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,243
- We need to see
that in slow mo.

182
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,379
- Just a five foot tall bird

183
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,782
what's the worst
that could happen?

184
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,517
- It's what you get,
trying to outdo a flamingo

185
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,351
at the beach.

186
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:34,694
- It's not a horror
movie that's like

187
00:11:34,727 --> 00:11:35,928
an espionage film.

188
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,464
'Cause like the
ocean sent the seal

189
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:40,132
to remove its oxygen source.

190
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,556
- Oh, the cat's a
vegetarian that's it.

191
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:13,466
- Duck duck, you're gonna
get stumped, I can tell.

192
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,572
- That cat is more
patient than I am.

193
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,651
Eat your vegetables, eat up.

194
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,095
- Oh my God!

195
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,263
Me and this dog are the same,

196
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:45,765
we don't like
housekeeping chores.

197
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:53,806
Just a good Samaritan
trying to help a baby goose

198
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,774
off the curb.

199
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,142
They gonna peck you.

200
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,845
Mama goose
is not having it.

201
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,088
At least that little guy is
safe and off the streets.

202
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,631
- Play with me Mom, play
with me, play with me.

203
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,099
Huh?

204
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,033
Why can't you just stick
your head out of the window

205
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:21,867
like a normal dog?

206
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,970
A kitty
slap from the stairs?

207
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,472
- Owh!

208
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,139
That's what you
get for taking a selfie.

209
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,083
- Just like hey man, can I
chill on the couch with you?

210
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:40,252
It's a nice chair, can we hang?

211
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:41,787
No!

212
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,689
- Coming up on World's
Funniest Animals,

213
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,991
unlikely animal friendships.

214
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,727
- We'll be right back with more
of World's Funniest Animals!

215
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:00,906
- Cats and dogs are
like oil and water,

216
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,775
they don't usually mix well,

217
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:05,744
at least that's what cartoons
I used to watch taught me.

218
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,447
But we found some pretty
cool animal pairings.

219
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,283
I know I was surprised what we
discovered for this segment,

220
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:13,252
A world of difference.

221
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,967
- Hey, this ain't no
dog and pony show.

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,102
- Nevermind that's
exactly what it is.

223
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,537
That dog seems so happy.

224
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,639
Could it be the fact
that he's riding a horse?

225
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,208
Or it could be because
he has an amazing outfit.

226
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:45,551
- That's real love right there.

227
00:14:50,422 --> 00:14:51,924
- Oh my gosh!

228
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,993
My heart melts when I see
the dog kiss the cow back.

229
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,235
- Oh yeah that's the spot,
you get in there bestie,

230
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,338
you get in there,
like a massage.

231
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,425
- I wish I made friends at the
beach as easily as that dog.

232
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:39,738
Now I wanna know
what the plans to do

233
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,373
if he does catch the dog.

234
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:43,676
- It's about the thrill
of the chase sometimes.

235
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,023
And you can stop hogging
all the attention.

236
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,536
- I absolutely love to eat
and I know my pets do too.

237
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,105
Get ready for our next
segment, Supper club.

238
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,553
- People put actual
vegetables on their snowman?

239
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:28,587
Hair noses and stuff?

240
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,963
- You see the other deer runaway

241
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,798
like oh man, get outta here.

242
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,837
- If someone asks me if I
want a snack and I say no,

243
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,273
I always regret it and
look exactly like this dog.

244
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:11,864
- This dog is like
the Oprah of carrots.

245
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:15,334
You get a carrot, you get a
carrot, everyone gets a carrot.

246
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,946
- I just love the salad bar.

247
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,882
Always fresh, always organic.

248
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:30,849
Me too Mich

249
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,184
but the early bird special

250
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,486
is getting out of
control these days.

251
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,662
- All right and the
test results are in.

252
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:48,700
You appear to be 70% fluff
and 30% celery, healthy.

253
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:52,137
- My doctor told me I have to
chew up to 30 times per bite.

254
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:02,748
- Oh my goodness!

255
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,383
What is this stuff?

256
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:17,796
- Give me food, give me food!

257
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,565
Must eat food!

258
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,876
- I'm not sure if she
realizes she's a bird.

259
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,713
- Well, that's almost it for us,

260
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,815
but just in case
you missed anything.

261
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,785
Here's a quick recap of all
of the funniest moments,

262
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,721
a bouncing sibling rivalry,
an interesting pairing,

263
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,959
a wild west woofer, a flamingo
who is totally over tourists,

264
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,827
a dog who has no
time for chores,

265
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,929
some bunnies with
their very own butler

266
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,498
and a horse who has decided

267
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,200
it's finally time to move
out of their parents' house.

268
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,910
That's all the time
we have on our show.

269
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,311
Thanks again to our panel

270
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,647
and to our celebrity
guest, James Maslow

271
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,116
for bringing his pup
by to chat with us

272
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,118
on World's Funniest Animals.

273
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,487
- Thank you so much,
Liz it was our pleasure.

274
00:19:15,521 --> 00:19:17,222
Blue has had a good
time being on the couch,

275
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,457
which he's not
usually allowed to be.

276
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,493
So say thank you
and say bye, bye.

277
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:23,795
- I'm Elizabeth Stanton
we'll see you again soon

278
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:27,266
with more crazy animal
clips, until next time.
