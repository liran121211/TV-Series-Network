1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:02,869
Time to cozy up

2
00:00:02,902 --> 00:00:04,504
with your very best friend.

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,272
Because on the show,

4
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,774
we've got a dancing ostrich,

5
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:11,211
an elephant who clearly doesn't
understand personal space,

6
00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:12,712
and the Tony Hawk of monkeys,

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,449
plus the most talented
dogs you've ever seen.

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,519
Don't forget about the cats.

9
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:21,054
Hold on tight for
a stunning display

10
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,956
of aerobic skill.

11
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,424
And if that's not enough,

12
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:27,327
we take to the skies and
also learn new tricks

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,561
with our feathered friends.

14
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:30,897
All this and a lot more

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,766
on "World's Funniest Animals".

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,871
- Welcome to World's
Funniest Animals,

17
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:39,139
your one stop shop

18
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,574
for the most hilarious
animal clips out there.

19
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:43,076
I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton.

20
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,278
And these are my
trusty sidekicks Hank

21
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,113
and Ruby joined today with a few

22
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,784
of my friends and panelists as
well as two celebrity guests.

23
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:51,951
Tom Arnold.

24
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,153
- Hey everybody.

25
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:55,588
- And our next guest,
Natalie Lander.

26
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,991
- Hey, thanks for
having us, Liz.

27
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,659
- While some animals are content

28
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:01,928
to cozy up in a comfy dog bed.

29
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:04,764
Others prefer to stretch
their legs in their natural

30
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:07,467
or not so natural habitats.

31
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,536
It's a wildlife.

32
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,672
- Brought to you with commentary
by our first panelist,

33
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:14,174
singer, actor, comedian,

34
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:17,010
radio host extraordinaire
Mikalah Gordon.

35
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,511
- Hey, Liz.

36
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:21,648
- Hey Mikalah, check out
this clip of this fat seal

37
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:23,817
and the unusual
way it gets around.

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,752
- Oh my gosh, I'm so ready.

39
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,466
Oh, that was sad feels
like me at the beach.

40
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:43,036
- For our next clip,
actor, writer, producer,

41
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:44,971
Noah Matthews breaks it down.

42
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:45,939
- Hey Liz.

43
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:48,041
Yes, so ready let's get started.

44
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,878
This husband has
designed a prank destined

45
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,247
to have him sleeping
on the couch tonight.

46
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,949
He has a live snake
that he's about

47
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,351
to sneak up on his wife with.

48
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,586
If someone did this to me,

49
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,721
I would have some
serious trust issues.

50
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:11,831
- Oo ooh, these wild animal
clips you never know.

51
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,936
- Top-notch comedian Brian
Cooper is also on our panel.

52
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,171
- Hey, Liz,

53
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:18,972
I'm happy to be
here and I'm ready

54
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:19,906
for some funny clips.

55
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,040
- Hey Brian, what do you think

56
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:23,243
of these girls wrestling
a baby elephant?

57
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,852
- Elephants never forget people.

58
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,354
So three to four years from now

59
00:02:34,387 --> 00:02:36,689
these girls might be ready
for the heavyweight rematch.

60
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,864
It's
feeding time at the zoo

61
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,132
for these adorable lemurs.

62
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,436
I'm kinda jealous at
this guy right now.

63
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,471
Wait a second.

64
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,306
Does he even work there?

65
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,707
How do I get to feed lemurs?

66
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,685
- Our fourth and final
panelist is a rising star up

67
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,154
and coming actress
Carmen Hodgson.

68
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,689
- Hey, Liz.

69
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:13,426
Yes, animal videos are my
favorite, favorite videos.

70
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,728
- Well perfect then
I've got one for you.

71
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,665
Let's see if you can tell
what's happening here.

72
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,901
♪ I'm so tired of
the same thing ♪

73
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:25,238
♪ Nothing all right ♪

74
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,940
♪ It's still good ♪

75
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,309
- Oh please mom, can
I please just go play

76
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,143
with my friends?

77
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,745
♪ No where to escape ♪

78
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,315
♪ It tasted good ♪

79
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,549
- And I'm excited to jump right

80
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:38,751
into our category,
hidden talents.

81
00:03:38,785 --> 00:03:40,620
Where you'll probably
be pretty jealous

82
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:42,922
after checking out the
skills shown up by man

83
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,924
and woman's best friend.

84
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:45,959
I know I was.

85
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,161
Hidden talents.

86
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,875
- I'm gonna hire this
guy for my next gig.

87
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,244
I've been getting it wrong.

88
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,254
- I play for treats.

89
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:26,599
- Don't you hate it when
you get crumbs in your keys?

90
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,672
Arthur, can
you go play the piano?

91
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,180
Ah, now singing too.

92
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,015
Very nice.

93
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,754
Very good boy playing piano.

94
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,095
- Is it still considered
a layup if you're

95
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,497
on all fours.

96
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,136
Let's go.

97
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:04,003
Load up.

98
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,241
- Wait.

99
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,242
Let's see that in slow mo.

100
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,078
I
would never be late

101
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,147
to anything if I could
jump in the car that fast.

102
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,748
They must be going to the park.

103
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,531
- Why is this dog 10 times
more coordinated than me.

104
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,933
- Imagining getting your
waves stolen by a dog?

105
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,508
- I can't believe I'm
considering asking a dog

106
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:43,476
for surfing lesson.

107
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,284
On your
marks, get set, go.

108
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,392
What a top
of the line security dog.

109
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:01,894
He's scanning the
perimeter like a pro.

110
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:09,869
- I'm really excited
for this part

111
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:11,437
of the show where
we bring you right

112
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,606
into the homes of
celebrities and their pets.

113
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,041
- Hey Liz.

114
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:16,075
Happy to be here.

115
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:16,976
- With all you've done

116
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:18,144
in TV and film.

117
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:19,278
Do you have a
story about working

118
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,646
with animals on set?

119
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,849
- I worked with
a famous elephant

120
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,884
on the set of "Saving Flora"

121
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,920
and this elephant had
better credits with me

122
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,857
and she was in a
ton of great movies.

123
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,793
"Water for Elephants" and
"Operation Dumbo Drop"

124
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:37,096
and I noticed that
she was always

125
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,998
on the right spot
better prepared

126
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,467
than me to do all of her lines.

127
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,771
I can't even explain it
just this gentle, beautiful,

128
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,205
40 year old elephant.

129
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,174
- It's crazy to think
that some animals

130
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,109
are career actors themselves.

131
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,111
You don't wanna
miss what's coming next,

132
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,780
some of the craziest antics

133
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:56,416
of animals ever caught
on tape, and later,

134
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,151
the show's gone to the birds.

135
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,253
- We'll be right back

136
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,320
with more "World's
Funniest Animals".

137
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,700
- Cats usually sleep
anywhere from 12

138
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,169
to 16 hours a day,

139
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,771
lounging around all
afternoon stretched out

140
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:19,705
in the sun.

141
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,507
Sounds pretty nice, doesn't it?

142
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,110
Well, since cats are
known to be so relaxed,

143
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,379
this next segment
might surprise you.

144
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,515
Check out some of
these crazy felines.

145
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,483
Flipping out!

146
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,460
- Honey, I think
we broke the cat.

147
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,209
- My money is on him in the
feline Olympics definitely.

148
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:06,719
- Maple leafs are
just Canadian cat nip.

149
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:24,136
- Touchdown house gangs.

150
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,709
- We are back with one

151
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,944
of my favorite
segments wild animals.

152
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,779
I can't wait to
show you what antics

153
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,815
these wild ones have been up to.

154
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,557
- Okay, this has to be one

155
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,227
of the best bucket list
things I've ever seen.

156
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,929
Oh, I'm so jealous.

157
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:11,350
- Wow, wow, wow, come
on one bear per hammock,

158
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,518
you know the rules.

159
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,489
Can you just relax for once?

160
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,157
It's supposed to be peaceful.

161
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,025
Don't stand why
are you standing?

162
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,126
Oh no.

163
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,829
Corny,
corny, corny pick.

164
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,300
There you go.

165
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,170
Oh my god.

166
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,306
Imagine
going on safari

167
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,774
with your family with the hopes

168
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,711
of relaxing seeing a
few animals and bam,

169
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,446
bird food everywhere.

170
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,281
They merely lost
the whole bucket.

171
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,755
This photographer is trying
to be as still as possible.

172
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,860
You can't outrun a cheetah
so your best bet is

173
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,063
to just not move.

174
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,405
Are you eating the bouquet?

175
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,041
Are you guys here for
Johnny Kelly's wedding?

176
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,345
- We were told it was cool
to take the centerpieces

177
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:14,246
or is that not cool?

178
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,687
I don't remember this
level in Tony Hawk.

179
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,688
- Is that parkour?

180
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,159
Up
next, the show's gone

181
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,728
to the birds.

182
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,930
- Don't go away "World's
Funniest Animals"

183
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:32,732
will be right back.

184
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,312
Did you know there are
around 18,000 species

185
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,780
of birds in the world,

186
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,849
and over 1100 of them live

187
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:51,283
in the United States.

188
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,052
Not only is that pretty crazy,

189
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,553
but it means that some have

190
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,122
to work a lot harder than others

191
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,657
to get attention.

192
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,991
If pumping up their feathers

193
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,960
isn't enough birds can resort

194
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,696
to some pretty
bizarre behaviors.

195
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,231
Watch me.

196
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,202
- Hey, Bill.

197
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,338
Hey Bill.

198
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,639
Look, I'm upside down.

199
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,013
Ah, a
nice trip to the farm.

200
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,584
This chicken is not having it.

201
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,306
- Wait is it playing in tune.

202
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,075
- I took guitar
lessons for two years.

203
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,276
I'm not kidding you

204
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:52,278
and this bird is
still better than me.

205
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:02,955
- So are they flying?

206
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,356
This is actually cool.

207
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:16,736
- Please get on the bike,

208
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:17,937
please get on the bike.

209
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,373
He's on the bike.

210
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,783
- These next animals
aren't just all bark.

211
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:31,951
They really have the skills

212
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,185
to back it up.

213
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,787
Let's jump into
our next segment.

214
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,255
Pets have talent.

215
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:47,366
- Yes, people it's all
about the matching outfit.

216
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,513
Ah, that was brutal.

217
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,148
- We need to see
that in slow mo.

218
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,499
- No the dog is not
putting itself to bed.

219
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:28,841
This cat just
might have a better memory

220
00:13:28,874 --> 00:13:30,075
than I do.

221
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,510
He is a total pro
with this game.

222
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,014
See if you can play
along it's tough.

223
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:49,862
Now that is difficult.

224
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:04,643
- On his way to steal yo girl.

225
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:07,913
Good job buddy.

226
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:08,781
Good job.

227
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,401
- This dog is on my team
for any board game please.

228
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,975
- Natalie, what about your pup?

229
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,243
Can Billy do any tricks?

230
00:14:37,276 --> 00:14:38,711
- Yes.

231
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,546
Billy can do one trick.

232
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:41,714
Ready?

233
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:44,250
Billy stare.

234
00:14:48,487 --> 00:14:49,622
You're a star.

235
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:53,225
- Hey Tom, can your pet
do any tricks like that?

236
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,829
- My pet is good at
running in circles.

237
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:59,031
- Hold on a minute
running in circles.

238
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,266
A dog.

239
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,267
What kinda pet do
you have there?

240
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,002
- I'm very proud of these guys.

241
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,304
But they seem to get in
this low pair of sight

242
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,072
and just making noise.

243
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:08,340
- Wow, impressive.

244
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,876
- Guys, you wanna get
in there do some loops

245
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,445
for the people at home.

246
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,714
Gonna wanna do a little get

247
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,149
to do though.

248
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,918
Okay, they don't
like to show off.

249
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,286
- I get it Tom no one wants

250
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,221
to flaunt their
talents too much.

251
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,822
It's rude.

252
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:25,024
Coming up,

253
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,193
these animals are
absolutely losing it.

254
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,230
Next on "World's
Funniest Animals".

255
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,432
- Grab a snack and your
pet's favorite tree

256
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,502
and I'll grab some more
hilarious animal clips for you.

257
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,939
When we return to "World's
Funniest Animals".

258
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,552
There are certain phrases
like walk or treat

259
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,255
that can cause our
pet to totally freak.

260
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,357
These clips show
those exact moments

261
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,926
where animals are losing it.

262
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,065
- I wanna swing

263
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,499
from the chandelier he
loves Sia makes sense.

264
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,136
- That's a good cat.

265
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,571
That's a strong cat.

266
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,505
That's a real cat.

267
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,986
- Honestly I just feel bad
for the Roomba at this point.

268
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,488
I mean, how is it ever
supposed to finish it's job?

269
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,199
- That's mission
impossible I can tell.

270
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,316
- Aww, it's so sad.

271
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,818
I love the moment where
the cat realizes mid air

272
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,587
that they haven't
made the catch.

273
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,528
- We are joining the
rest of the flock

274
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:13,565
as we start our next
segment feathered friends.

275
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,735
- Alexa Christmas lights on.

276
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,936
Okay.

277
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,740
- Dude half the time I use talk

278
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:24,143
to text it comes out
as just gibberish.

279
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,612
But this bird can work
the Christmas lights

280
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,047
with voice recognition.

281
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,650
- Alexa Christmas lights on.

282
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:32,785
Okay.

283
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:38,724
- And here we are ladies

284
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:42,628
and gentlemen at the first
annual parakeet dunking contest.

285
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,669
- Flamingo with the
dance fever I like it.

286
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,276
And
there goes your hat.

287
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,321
- For your dining entertainment
we bring you Marty

288
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,923
with his mating dance.

289
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,527
- Imagine trying to eat dinner

290
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,563
and some guy is doing this
right in front of you.

291
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,534
- She's just not into you.

292
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,682
No what is it like a
carnival for chickens?

293
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:42,688
- I have a weird
feeling about chickens.

294
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,124
I don't trust them.

295
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:49,061
- Well, that's almost it for us.

296
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:51,396
But just in case
you missed anything,

297
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,931
here's a quick recap of all

298
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,234
of the funniest
moments, rolling seals,

299
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:56,735
a cat spinning out of control,

300
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,704
an aspiring dog pianist,

301
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,539
a cat who has turned
their owner's table

302
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,707
into jungle gym,

303
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,709
a dog who is a pro on a scooter

304
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,944
and let's not forget
that amazing dress,

305
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,713
an Olympic gymnast hopeful cat,

306
00:19:07,746 --> 00:19:08,981
a BMX bird,

307
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,215
a thrill seeking monkey,

308
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,718
a burrito enthusiast pup
and an owner who bite

309
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:15,020
off more than they could
chew with their dog

310
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:16,755
on a skateboard.

311
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,823
Whoa.

312
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,731
That's all the time we
have on this episode

313
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,499

314
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,334
