1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,538
- Get the game together,

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,674
you're not gonna wanna
miss, a minute of the show.

3
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:10,210
Where we have, a silly spinner,

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:14,615
a bobby leaving bad boy,
an utterly clean otter,

5
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:17,351
and these babysitting buddies,

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,721
right here on, "World's
Funniest Animals."

7
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,292
I'm your host Elizabeth Stanton,

8
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:28,228
and you're watching
"World's Funniest Animals."

9
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:30,664
Today, I'm joined by my
sidekicks, Hank and Ruby,

10
00:00:30,664 --> 00:00:32,666
and a few friends and panelists,

11
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:35,936
as well as our celebrity
guest, Stephen Kramer Glickman.

12
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,938
- Hey everyone,
happy to be here,

13
00:00:37,938 --> 00:00:40,741
and excited to see what
we have in store tonight.

14
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,510
- Thanks for being here,
Stephen, these next animals,

15
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,045
well, there are no words

16
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,180
just get your ohs and ahs ready,

17
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,750
because these critters,
are just plain cute.

18
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,287
Brought to you with commentary
from our first panelist,

19
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,923
the hilarious
comedian, Neel Ghosh.

20
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,424
- Hey Liz, happy to be here.

21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,694
- We have one of the cutest
clips, I've ever seen right now.

22
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,930
- These cute segments
are too much for me.

23
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,531
What are you guys
trying to do here?

24
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:11,605
I kinda like these gloves?

25
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,472
Anyone else have a problem?

26
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,247
- Our next panelist, is the
amazing comedian, Brian Cooper.

27
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,782
- Hi Liz.

28
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,351
- This next clip features,
a very hyperactive animal.

29
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,819
- This is gonna be good.

30
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,207
And from that moment on,

31
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,476
Timmy believed that
he too, was a dog.

32
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:52,012
- Now you're joined
by actor, writer,

33
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,214
director, and
musician, Maiara Walsh.

34
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:55,649
- Happy to be here, Liz.

35
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:56,616
- Are you ready for something

36
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,919
that is just too cute to handle?

37
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,487
- I can't wait for this one.

38
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,402
That was some pretty good form.

39
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,810
- And now, our final panelist,
actress, Carmen Hodgson.

40
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,545
- Oh my God, I'm so
ready for tonight.

41
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,481
What clips do we have?

42
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,517
- Are you ready for the
cutest animal I've ever seen?

43
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,785
- Awesome, let's see it.

44
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:47,634
Oh man, I hate it when
I get shampoo in my eye.

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,941
- There's certain phrases,

46
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,312
like walk or treat, that can
cause our pets to totally freak.

47
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,648
These next clips show
that exact moment,

48
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:04,217
where animals are "Losing It".

49
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,428
- Parkour cats.

50
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,163
Yeah, that's a thing.

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,715
- This cat learned how to do
this from the Caddyshack gopher.

52
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:05,712
- That dog just turned that
hammock, into a seesaw.

53
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,464
- Catch a rabbit, no problem,

54
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,933
catch his tail, a lot harder.

55
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,807
- Hey, what's up dog?

56
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,408
I don't know, but I don't
think that was Decaf coffee

57
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,710
they just gave me.

58
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:49,389
Are ball pits the equivalent
of catnip for dogs?

59
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,226
- From the television
series, "Big Time Rush,"

60
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,996
we've got Stephen Kramer
Glickman with us here tonight,

61
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:57,430
is that a pug I see?

62
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,565
What's their name?

63
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,567
- Hey Liz, this is Jelly Donut.

64
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:02,469
She's like a member
of our family

65
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,539
and she's a pillow
with eyeballs.

66
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:06,706
- Jelly Donut?

67
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:07,974
What a fun name?

68
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,443
Jelly Donut looks
pretty adorable,

69
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,445
does she happen to
know any tricks?

70
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,715
- Liz, she doesn't do
the trick on demand,

71
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,817
because she has
performance anxiety,

72
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,187
but she does sleep
70% of the day.

73
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,789
So, she's basically a magician.

74
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,392
- So, we talked to James
Maslow in a previous episode,

75
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:28,728
where he had a run-in with
a Boa constrictor on set.

76
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,298
Did you have any scenes
with animals on that show?

77
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:34,034
- Well, Elizabeth,
on Big Time Rush,

78
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,336
we got to work
with a chimpanzee,

79
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,271
we got to work with a skunk,

80
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:43,009
and when I played "The Pigeon",
in the movie, "Storks,"

81
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,312
my mom bought me
an actual pigeon.

82
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:48,081
It was pretty crazy.

83
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,217
- Thanks again for coming
on the show, Stephen,

84
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,918
I guess we'll just
leave Jelly Donut

85
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,820
to do her, favorite trick.

86
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,223
Some of the most playful pets

87
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,326
coming up next, on,
World's Funniest Animals.

88
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:10,837
Every now and then I
have a lot of work to do

89
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,608
and Ruby here, just
won't stop pestering me.

90
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,277
Even though it may make
me fall behind a bit,

91
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,813
I can't resist that
cute little face.

92
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:22,749
Check out these other animals
who just wanna have fun,

93
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,318
on our next segment,
"Play With Me".

94
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,295
- Come on mom, hold still honey,

95
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,231
have a colic and
something on your face.

96
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,711
- What did I say about
too much Red bull?

97
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,860
- Don't feel like studying?

98
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,561
Need a distraction?

99
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,596
Bingo.

100
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:23,743
- You know honey, if you keep
getting that ball for him,

101
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,879
he's never gonna learn
how to fetch on his own.

102
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,236
- Yeah, he can set,
but can't he spike?

103
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,187
- Just make sure
that you feel good.

104
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,422
About you, it is
about you today.

105
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,828
- Crack open the notepad,
because these expert trainers,

106
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,896
are going to show you
some amazing tricks,

107
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,531
they have taught their pets.

108
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,899
Here's training day.

109
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,778
- And you grab your
partner and Dosey-doe.

110
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,723
- Come on let's go.

111
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,593
Through, wait, come
on get up, okay.

112
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,836
- Okay, is it like a school,

113
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,772
to teach dogs these
stuff or something?

114
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,360
- Oh, that is so cool,
a hand stand on a hand.

115
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,106
- That's incredible!

116
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,983
- Emma wants to
know, what's going on.

117
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
- Poop!

118
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:54,994
- Yeah, Jerry good job!

119
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,731
- Make sure you go downstairs.

120
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:00,567
Ready?

121
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:09,142
Bring me that ball back..

122
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,283
- He
brought it back, huh?

123
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,118
- I've never seen a cat
play catch

124
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,321
and actually bring it back.

125
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,256
- Coming up, we
have some animals,

126
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,191
who just about had enough,
"Flipping Out,"

127
00:10:26,426 --> 00:10:27,694
next on World's
Funniest Animals.

128
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,640
Did you know, that a
hummingbird can beat its wings

129
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,009
up to 88 times per second?

130
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,512
You heard me right, per second!

131
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,681
While these animals may
not have that much energy,

132
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:52,018
it's clear that something's
driving them crazy.

133
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,152
Flipping out.

134
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,195
- Spinning butt attack,
can't defend it.

135
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,708
- Now I've heard of a Tasmanian
devil, but the

136
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,377
Tasmanian Pitbull?

137
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,552
- Sign that dog up for the NFL!

138
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,806
- Every day, it's another bill,

139
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,375
a piece of junk mail
or collection notice.

140
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,945
Where's that mail
order bone I ordered?

141
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,117
- Please rip-up
all my bills too.

142
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,041
- And then he just went crazy.

143
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,477
- But he's having so much
fun, you can't get mad.

144
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,023
- Somebidy's gonna
attack somebody

145
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,958
soon, I can feel
it, I can feel it.

146
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,510
Don't just sit there, videotape
me for all your friends!

147
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,212
Help me get up!

148
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,323
- What to do when there's no TV.

149
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,227
Stick something on the wall
and watch your cat for hours.

150
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,667
- Even though this is
World's Funniest Animals,

151
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:23,036
while we were searching the
web for hilarious videos

152
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,570
to bring you,

153
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,340
there were a few that were
just too cute to pass up.

154
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,677
No laughs about it, these
clips are too adorable.

155
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,647
Hi,
spin, turn!

156
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:39,585
- Good gril, wave, wave.

157
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,255
Are you sad?

158
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,490
Be sad!

159
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,626
Are you sad?

160
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,730
Good girl, can you hi-five?

161
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,032
Good job, can you pray?

162
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:54,834
Put your paws out,
put your paws out

163
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:56,736
Can you pray?

164
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,241
Good girl, goodbye!

165
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,128
- Okay, my dog has poops,
that are bigger than this dog.

166
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,971
- 5% dog, 95% fluff.

167
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:46,786
- Man, if only someone could
keep me occupied like this.

168
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,798
- Patty cake, Patty cake,

169
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,266
baker's man, bake me a
cake, as fast as you can

170
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,673
so pat it and roll
it, good girl!

171
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,977
- Does this dog take double
A or triple A batteries?

172
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:12,712
- Pat a cake, pat a cake

173
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,081
as fast as you can.

174
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,984
- Patty cake, Patty
cake, producer man,

175
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,319
get me this dog as
fast as you can!

176
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,071
- Don't go away, World's
Funniest Animals,

177
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,006
will be right back.

178
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,618
Don't you hate when you're stuck
at home with nothing to do?

179
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,053
I know I do.

180
00:15:54,053 --> 00:15:57,256
Sometimes, you just gotta
escape, and get some fresh air.

181
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,759
Turns out, animals
feel the same way,

182
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,830
as we found out, in this next
segment, "Planned Escape".

183
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,902
Jump over the fence.

184
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,372
That is too crazy, oh man!

185
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,344
- That was perfect timing,
when he said to jump.

186
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,546
- Jump over the fence.

187
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:31,891
- This giraffe, has had enough

188
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:34,427
of being a tourist attraction.

189
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,570
I think
we've reinforced this,

190
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,406
locked off the windows, so,
he can't break through that,

191
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,942
extended the door,
double locked,

192
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,346
I think, now I may
be speaking too soon,

193
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,049
but I think, we found a
way to keep stinky in.

194
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,519
Don't think you can
break through those,

195
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,755
Yep, all the way to
the ceiling, bud.

196
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:06,959
No jumping on the...

197
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,027
Are you kidding me?

198
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,264
- I have to see that again.

199
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,433
No jumping on the...

200
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,701
Are you kidding me?

201
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,706
Alright, is that
how you do it, huh?

202
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,576
Perfect.

203
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,421
- This dog has definitely
done this before.

204
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:44,397
- If you have a pet,
you know how sometimes

205
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,999
they just can't stop
begging for attention.

206
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,501
These next clips feature

207
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:51,704
animals asking for attention,
in some unconventional ways.

208
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:54,507
"I will not be ignored."

209
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,417
- Okay, big deal, your
tail is longer than mine,

210
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,820
you don't have to keep
whacking into my face.

211
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,099
- Spin around.

212
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,279
- This is one of
my favorite things

213
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,981
that dogs do with the hose.

214
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,052
- Washing two hogs and a dog.

215
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,190
- Wow, that's almost it for us,

216
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,359
but just in case
you missed anything,

217
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:50,463
here is a quick recap of
all of our funniest moments.

218
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,498
fetching furballs,
dizzy dogs a berserk

219
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:56,402
parker, a cat who refuses to be
beat on the green

220
00:18:56,402 --> 00:19:00,239
a frisky feline, the smallest
puppy I have ever seen,

221
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:01,841
and a Patty cake,
playing kitten.Aww!

222
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,684
Well, that's all the time we
have for you on this episode

223
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:13,552
of World's Funniest Animals,

224
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,655

227

and I'll be back with
more hilarious videos

229
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,466
on World's Funniest Animals.

230
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,776
- Can you pray?

231
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,892
- Jump over the
fence, jump, jump,

232
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,561
oh, wow, that was too crazy.
