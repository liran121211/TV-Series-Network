1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,704
- Are you ready to
leap into action?

2
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:04,938
Because today on the show,

3
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,440
we've got a monkey,

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,508
who just wants to be left alone,

5
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,611
a virtual driving dog,

6
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,679
a very casual cat,

7
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,550
and a cup full of cute.

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,951
All this and more,

9
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,621
on this episode of
world's funniest animals.

10
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,825

Elizabeth Stanton,

11
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,727

special treats,

00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,128
in store for you tonight,

13
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:29,997
on world's funniest animals.

14
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,499
Tonight I'm joined by my trusty
side kicks Hank and Ruby,

15
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,735
and a few friends and panelists,

16
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:37,671
as well as our celebrity
guest Griffin Gluck.

17
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,673

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,974
and let's get to it.

19
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,542
- Thanks for being here Griffin,

20
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,778

00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,914

Actor Carmen Hodgson.

27
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,894
- What's up Liz.

28
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,496

00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:04,197

clips I've ever seen?

30
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:05,966
- I can't wait to see this.

31
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,208

friends are for.

00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:23,116
actor, writer,

34
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,051

36
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,620
just about the cutest
little guy ever.

37
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,022
- All right I have to see this.

38
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,871
- Yeah I'll have a glass of the
incredibly cute kitten please.

39
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,373

40
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,242
singer, actor, comedian,

41
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,811
- What's going on Liz?

42
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:53,413
- We have one of my
favorite clips right here.

43
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,948
- Sounds like a blast,

44
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,483
I'd love to join in.

45
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:11,064
- I mean that's one
way to get belly rubs.

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,968
- For our final panelist,

47
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,671
We have top-notch
comedian Brian Cooper.

48
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,172
- Hey Liz,

49
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,108
- Are you ready for your
new favorite furry friend?

50
00:02:21,108 --> 00:02:23,410
- Oh this sounds
like a good one.

51
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,289
- Cuteness overload.

52
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,293
- Some animals
are best observed,

53
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,095
in their own habitats.

54
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,363
Where they can stretch out,

55
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,399
and just live their lives.

56
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:46,633
Take a look at these clips,

57
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:49,536
showcasing animals in
their natural habitats.

58
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:52,873
Well, most of them
anyway, it's a wild life.

59
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,947
- You're not getting my good
angle.

60
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,317
- Let me see that thing.

61
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,037
- Oh no don't mind my tiger,

62
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,338
he's just thirsty.

63
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,074
He's fine with tap.

64
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,349
- Actually this is an
inter-species bathroom.

65
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,102
- That's honestly
exactly how my parents,

66
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,603
would react when my brother,

67
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,738
and I would be throwing
each other around the house.

68
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,080
- Kids, enough now

69
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,316
your parents are trying to tan.

70
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,403
- I'm so excited for
this part of the show,

71
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,239
where we get to visit
celebrity's homes,

72
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,473
and meet their pets.

73
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,041
You might recognize
tonight's guests,

74
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,510
from shows like Lock and Key,

75
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,712
an American Vandal,
Griffin Gluck.

76
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,981
Just who all do we have here?

77
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:43,683
- So this butt belongs to Petie.

78
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,721
We've got Poe down
here to my left.

79
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,658
We've got Bear sitting
over there in the corner.

80
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:53,627
This one's Mochi,

81
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,629
and that's Max over there,

82
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,832
and then can't forget
Lulu right here,

83
00:04:58,832 --> 00:05:01,201
and Bubba right here.

84
00:05:01,201 --> 00:05:03,403
These two are their babies too.

85
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,172
That's their mom and dad.

86
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,274
- That's quite a few pets,

87
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,508
You obviously have a ton,

88
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,210
of experience with
animals at home,

89
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,811
but my question is,

90
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,947
have you ever worked
with animals on set?

91
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,782
- Yeah, one of my first jobs,

92
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:16,883
"Just Go With It",

93
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,219
I've got to swim with a dolphin,

94
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,521
and one of the
world's only wolfins,

95
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,558
which is killer whale
mixed with a dolphin,

96
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:29,129
and that was I mean the
coolest, that was the best.

97
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:31,998
- Swimming with dolphins is
definitely a bucket list item.

98
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,333
- Also on "Why Him,"

99
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,536
there were a bunch
of farm animals,

100
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,505
and so during breaks,

101
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,739
I would go and hang out,

102
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,842
with like two pigs,
peacock, a sheep.

103
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,111
I was hanging out
with those guys,

104
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,881
like every second of the day.

105
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,816
- Thanks so much for coming by,

106
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:52,152
and sharing your
pets with us Griffin.

107
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,486
- Up next take a deep dive,

108
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:56,990
with this to discover
some fishy situations.

109
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,225
Don't go away,

110
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,227
more World's funniest
animals coming right up.

111
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,205
- There's something about
the calmness of the ocean,

112
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,407
that really makes
you feel at peace.

113
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,643
It's also just really cool.

114
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,878
Take a look at the
fishy situations,

115
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,314
We've compiled in
this next segment.

116
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,682
Fishy situations.

117
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,193
- Hey, you got any snacks,

118
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,427
in that thank of yours

119
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,997
care to share.

120
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,025
- Whale slap.

121
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:09,663
- I hope you have
insurance, life insurance.

122
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,994
- I consider myself
pretty tech savvy,

123
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:41,895
but you know,

124
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,630
I'm also human.

125
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,864
Check out the ways,

126
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,833
some of these amazing
pets use technology,

127
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,102
in our next segment, Pet Tech.

128
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:03,850
- Oh what,

129
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,254
did the cat just come
out the TV screen.

130
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,464
- Did you see what
Karen posted last week?

131
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,232
I can't believe her.

132
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,451
- I think the dog thinks,

133
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:39,753
that it's voice activated.

134
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,912
- What is wrong with you?

135
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,089
- I wanna go fast,
I wanna go fast

136
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,708
- We take a trip
to the wild side,

137
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,910
coming up next on,

138
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,311
world's funniest animals.

139
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:50,390
- We're back with one
of my favorite segments,

140
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,258
I can't wait to show
you what antics,

141
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,427
these wild ones have been up to.

142
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,163
Let's take a walk
on the wild side.

143
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:16,516
- Do you think they
know each other?

144
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,504
- Here comes a bear hug.

145
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:51,217
- This wildbeest has been
hanging out with the Honey

146
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,152
badger, he just does not care.

147
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,606
- To be fair,

148
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,074
they kind of deserve that
for spraying him, okay

149
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:29,055
- Well he was thirsty.

150
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,457
- This one is a
little bit funny,

151
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,926
a little bit terrifying,

152
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,328
and a whole lot of amazing.

153
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:49,976
- Okay this cheetah
is really debating,

154
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,811
whether or not this
woman is a snack.

155
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:13,232
- These next animals,

156
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,901
well, there are no words.

157
00:12:14,901 --> 00:12:17,704
These creatures are
just plain cute.

158
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,318
- Okay, I have so
many questions,

159
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,220
where can I get one?

160
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,055
What is he all dressed up for?

161
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,890
How does something
look this cute,

162
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,626
and is missing
most of its shirt?

163
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,961
Like what is going on?

164
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:49,769
- Is the bow tie what
makes him a French

165
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,071
bulldog?

166
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,418
- Bear cubs are so cute.

167
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,356
- Oh my goodness,

168
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,726
you can't even tell these are
bears they look like puppies.

169
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,076
- Witnessing his first
climb, it melts my heart.

170
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:39,018
- So much focus, look him go,

171
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,833
- Now if kittens stay this
cute I would have 80 of them,

172
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,983
- Somebody wants sushi?

173
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:16,389
- We have some animals,

174
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,890
going along for the ride,

175
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,359
coming up on world's
funniest animals.

176
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,772
- Ride sharing is so
popular these days,

177
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:36,476
even our pets are carpooling
along for the ride.

178
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,086
- This is how I now go to
the kitchen for snacks.

179
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,733
- These duo is the
definition of cool.

180
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,743
- Yeah, cats know

00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,067

- No one else is worried about,

195
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:07,193
the giant fish
circling around them.

00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,262
They are heavily outnumbered.

197
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,237
- Surfers and dolphins,

198
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,206
what could possibly go wrong?

199
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,644
- Great idea let's go

- All that little
dog wants to do,

205
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,378
is check swimming with dolphins,

206
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:33,980
off his bucket list.

207
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,315
Let him live.

00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,887
- Well, that's almost it for us,

209

and a fish tank
that drives itself.

215
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,506

a market for that.
