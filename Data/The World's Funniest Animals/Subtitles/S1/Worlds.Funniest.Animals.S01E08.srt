1
00:00:02,969 --> 00:00:04,104
Grab your
favorite furry friend

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,872
and take a seat.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:06,906
We'll be checking out,

4
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,808
a fish feeding frenzy,

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,577
a bread loving bear,

6
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,379
a slippery swine,

7
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:14,647
and a canine carousel.

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,916
Stay tuned for
this and much more

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,319
on "World's Funnies Animals."

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,657
- Welcome back, I'm your
host Elizabeth Stanton.

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,560
And these are my trusty
sidekicks, Hank and Ruby

12
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:30,530
joined today with a few
friends and panelists,

13
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:33,666
as well as our celebrity
guest, Danielle Nicolet.

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,168
- Hey everyone.

15
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:38,271
I'm so excited to be here
and I am super excited

16
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,173
to see what we have
in store tonight.

17
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,107
What do you think Biggie?

18
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,709
Are you excited?

19
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,977
Oh, he's excited.

20
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,278
- Thanks for being
here, Danielle.

21
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:47,647
Getting excited to eat
is definitely something

22
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,983
I can relate to, but
these animals take

23
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,751
it to another level.

24
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,621
The hunger is real
in a segment we call,

25
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:56,122
"Dinner Time,"

26
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,091
brought to you with commentary
from our first panelists,

27
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,693
the hilarious
comedian, Neel Ghosh.

28
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,995
- Hey Liz.

29
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:03,196
- This next clip
features an animal

30
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,964
getting ready to
dig into their meal.

31
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,166
- Ah, perfect.

32
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,867
I haven't eaten all
day, so let's get to it.

33
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,445
This isn't coffee!

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:21,881
What is he making, it looks
like a power, smoothie?

35
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:32,759
Okay, I'm not
eating any of that.

36
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:35,028
First of all, the monkey
sniffs everything,

37
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:38,364
and second, he scratches his
butt with that same hand.

38
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,599
Ugh!

39
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,770
- Our next panelist is
actor Carmen Hodgson.

40
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,405
- I'm happy to be here Liz.

41
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,341
- This next clip features
a very hungry animal.

42
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,977
- Ohm, can't wait to
see what we got tonight.

43
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,790
Seriously, again?

44
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:06,926
I'm gonna film you eating and
see how great you look, okay.

45
00:02:11,064 --> 00:02:12,365
- Now, we are joined by actor,

46
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:15,001
writer, director,
musician, Maiara Walsh.

47
00:02:15,034 --> 00:02:16,236
- Hi Liz.

48
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,238
- We have an animal
who can't wait to eat.

49
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,772
- Let's see how this pans out.

50
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:22,542
Ooh!

51
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,111
Ooh!

52
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,647
And he shoots, and he scores.

53
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,217
- For our final panelist.

54
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,053
We have top notch,
comedian Brian Cooper.

55
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,488
- Hi, Liz.

56
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:37,924
- Are you ready for some animals
digging into their dinner?

57
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:40,693
- This sounds interesting.

58
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,932
Hello.

59
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,668
Hey guys, this is the place.

60
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,936
Trust me.

61
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,471
You just knock and
they bring food.

62
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,878
This bread better
be gluten free.

63
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,187
- This is horrifying.

64
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,355
This man has lost his mind.

65
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,993
What happens when
he runs out of food?

66
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,863
Fish just swarm him and
start eating his body?

67
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,214
♪ Ring around the Rosie ♪

68
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,149
♪ 'Cause this food
is delicious ♪

69
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,085
- After watching so many
of these animal videos

70
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,587
I kinda know what
they're thinking

71
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,188
when I look into their eyes,

72
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,159
and these next animals are
all thinking the same thing.

73
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,193
Don't mess with me.

74
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,618
- This is the dog's
version of shotgun.

75
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,488
I thought we settle this.

76
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,723
I get it for 10 minutes

77
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,191
and then you get
it for 10 minutes.

78
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,374
- Get your hands off my man.

79
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,800
This is one hangry dog.

80
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,247
- This cat wants
to go on vacation.

81
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,381
I can be a carry on.

82
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,183
Just put the zipper on.

83
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,456
- I love this part of the show,

84
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,492
where we visit celebrities
and meet their furry friends.

85
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,329
Our celebrity guest is the
amazing Danielle Nicolet

86
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,231
from "The Flash" and
"Central Intelligence."

87
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,901
Hey Danielle, I see you
have someone there with you.

88
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,135
Tell us about them.

89
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,238
- This is the one and
only Biggie Smalls.

90
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,606
I know there's
another Biggie Smalls,

91
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,874
but don't tell him
he doesn't know.

92
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,543
He's very sensitive.

93
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:44,677
As I was saying,

94
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,846
the one and only Biggie Smalls.

95
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,582
He is the love of my life.

96
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,086
My greatest hangout
partner, my travel buddy,

97
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:54,887
and also my snuggle pal.

98
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,257
- Hey Danielle, can your
dog do any tricks us?

99
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,260
- I'm gonna to say that I
think Biggie is the best pug

100
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,762
in the whole entire world

101
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:06,032
because he's the only pug
I've ever known that will do

102
00:06:06,065 --> 00:06:07,266
what you ask him to do.

103
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,469
For example, Biggie, lips.

104
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:12,138
Lips.

105
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,173
Lips.

106
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,909
Lips.

107
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,111
Yes.

108
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,512
Biggie's also very
good at other things.

109
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,747
For example,

110
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,850
should I ever remove
my sock from my foot,

111
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,820
he will promptly
take it and eat it.

112
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,759
- Coming up, we take a
trip down to the rodeo.

113
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,427
Next on the, "World's
Funniest Animals."

114
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,408
Yeehaw, it's time for a
new segment on this episode

115
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,510
of "World's Funniest Animals."

116
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,278
Our animal rodeo.

117
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,647
Lucky us these animals
have been practicing

118
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,083
long before their
day in the arena.

119
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,184
Take a look.

120
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,252
Rodeo.

121
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,569
- Ah, man, I know I'm
gonna regret this picture

122
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,570
when I grow up.

123
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:24,076
Stay, stay, whoa.

124
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:26,546
Stay.

125
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,382
I can't tell who the
woman is talking to,

126
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:30,483
because the horse stopped,

127
00:07:30,516 --> 00:07:31,951
but the dog was like "No."

128
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,755
Stay.

129
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,339
- Look how cute.

130
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,907
I want baby goats
as my step trackers.

131
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,076
Get your steps in.

132
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,660
- Heehaw, little doggie.

133
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,966
- Even animals get
annoyed sometimes.

134
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,634
Whether it's personal space,

135
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,236
or they're trying to rest,

136
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,704
if they don't want attention,

137
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:27,073
they will be sure
to let you know.

138
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,674
Get ready for our next segment,

139
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,076
"I don't think so."

140
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:44,924
- You still haven't
got me my milk?

141
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,053
♪ I've got a peanut ♪

142
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,422
♪ I've got a peanut and
you can't have none ♪

143
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,091
♪ And you can't ♪
Dang it.

144
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,739
- I'm wondering who likes
it more the dude or the cat?

145
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:50,556
- What this woman doesn't know,

146
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,158
this the leg of the
last person who tried

147
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,826
to touch him when he was eating.

148
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,031
- Getting my work out for the
day.

149
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:00,166
Now here's the training center.

150
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,950
Lave me alone.

151
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,464
- Okay, this is my side

152
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,699
and so is that side.

153
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,239
- Our celebrity guest is the
amazing Danielle Nicolet,

154
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,708
from "The Flash" and
"Central Intelligence."

155
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:43,943
Hey Danielle,

156
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,878
have you ever worked
with any animals on set?

157
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:49,315
- Yes, I have actually worked
with animals, quite a few.

158
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:52,318
I seem to have the biggest
issue with goats, though.

159
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,820
I was doing an episode of
"Real Husbands of Hollywood"

160
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:57,490
with Kevin Hart, when
a goat was in the scene

161
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,559
and that goat pooped on my foot.

162
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:02,695
And I thought that
would be the last time

163
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:03,496
that a goat ever pooped on me,

164
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,997
but it turns out no.

165
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,233
Last year I was doing an episode

166
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,468
of my friend, Katee
Sackhoff show,

167
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,571
and we did goat yoga on the show

168
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:14,540
and the goats helped
stretch my back

169
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:18,177
and then he pooped on
my foot and on my back.

170
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,178
Go goat go!

171
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,046
Oh, no.

172
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,249
- Why's it me?

173
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,650
It's the poop.

174
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,185
- Well, I think we
know we won't see you

175
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:27,720
at the State Fair Petting Zoo.

176
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:29,221
- I don't know why
goats don't like me?

177
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,523
I'm a vegan.

178
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,091
- Well, thanks for
stopping in Danielle

179
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:34,093
and introducing
us all to Biggie.

180
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,761
- It's been my pleasure.

181
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,096
Our pleasure.

182
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:39,331
Thank you so much Liz.

183
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:43,335
- Coming up, we find out that
animals are just like us?

184
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,771
Next on "World's
Funniest Animals."

185
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,551
- Did you know that 90%
of human genes are similar

186
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,786
to those found in domestic cats?

187
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,256
It's pretty crazy how similar
we are to our animal friends.

188
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,660
I mean, some even sing,
dance and enjoy fine dining,

189
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:08,661
just like us.

190
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,964
- Do a stare.

191
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,726
- People have way too
much time on their hands.

192
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,362
There's a person underneath
this goat right now.

193
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:44,797
We need to understand this.

194
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,467
There's a human being with
feelings and thoughts underneath

195
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,636
the shirt, hand
feeding a goat wine.

196
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,243
You want something?

197
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,278
You want something?

198
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,713
You want something?

199
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:03,449
- I think the woman's
actually talking to the man.

200
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,260
- I asked for a lap pool.

201
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,596
This is not a lap pool.

202
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,145
- They lure you in
the bathtub with wine,

203
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,981
and duckies and then bam,
they turn on the water.

204
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:39,985
- I absolutely love to eat

205
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,887
and I know my pets do too.

206
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:44,423
Get ready for our next
segment, "Supper Club."

207
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,463
- Well, I thought
that was for me.

208
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,532
Give me that.

209
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,601
Get your kid out of here.

210
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,870
The time to play with
you, dinner time.

211
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,247
- Sir, please chew
with your mouth closed.

212
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,082
I mean, this guy's
tables manners

213
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,984
are utterly unbelievable.

214
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,365
- Hey, mine was
good, but I wonder.

215
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,405
Oh, yeah, yours is
definitely better.

216
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,613
This little guy
had a rough night,

217
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,150
but a sunflower seed
is just the right cure.

218
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,728
This is the ultimate supper
club, a turtle an iguana,

219
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,431
a bunch of bunnies and a
chicken all at the same buffet

220
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,278
That is an epic fail, love it.

221
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,552
- Don't go anywhere more
amazing animals after this.

222
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,355
"World's Funniest Animals,"
we'll be right back.

223
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:35,267
You know, they
always say how pets

224
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:36,802
and their owners
start to look alike

225
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,704
after a certain amount of time.

226
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,039
Well, in this next segment,

227
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,642
it seems like they even
start to act the same,

228
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,810
"Two of a Kind."

229
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,055
You and
Bruno are literally

230
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,057
exactly the same right now.

231
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,892
- This impression is uncanny.

232
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:03,162
An odd case of twins
separated at birth.

233
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,543
- And one, and two, after
this we'll cool down

234
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,777
with a downward dog.

235
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,626
- Okay, that's
what you look like.

236
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,928
Maybe I should have
gotten glasses,

237
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,429
before I decided to move in.

238
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:46,438
- Yo, what's up?

239
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,406
Catch you on the flip side.

240
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:02,654
- A boy and his
dog, two of a kind.

241
00:17:13,932 --> 00:17:17,169
- The rodeo is synonymous
with bull riding,

242
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,171
horse tricks and farm animals.

243
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,474
Let's saddle up,
"Home on the Range."

244
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,056
- And the world keeps
going round and round,

245
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:40,392
round and round.

246
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,761
- And he's a good guy.

247
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,830
He probably--

248
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,697
One time.

249
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,302
Did you get it?

250
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,012
I've got you.

251
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:00,946
I'll get you.

252
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,282
- Sure, just go get the mail.

253
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,683
It's easy, you said.

254
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,219
Ha-ha, very funny.

255
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:21,867
And I'll lick, and will
lick your house down.

256
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,517
- How far are you going?

257
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,418
About two feet.

258
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:41,220
Fine with me.

259
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,291
- Well, that's almost it for us,

260
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,427
but just in case
you missed anything,

261
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,830
here is a quick recap of
all of the funniest moments,

262
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,833
A bull riding boxer, slippery
swine, galloping goat,

263
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,969
a berating bird,
a displeased dog,

264
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,338
filching foul, a pup
who's not yet mastered

265
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:00,539
the art of catching,

266
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,442
and a monkey who can
make their own lunch.

267
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,276
Wow, that's really impressive.

268
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,452
Well, that's all the time
we have on this episode

269
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,521
of "World's Funniest Animals."

270
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,222
Thanks to our panel
for guiding us

271
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,258
through these crazy clips.

272
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,026
I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton,

273
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,529
and I'll be back with
more hilarious videos,

274
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:25,664
on "World's Funniest Animals."
