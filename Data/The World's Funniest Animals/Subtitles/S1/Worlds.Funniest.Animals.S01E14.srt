1
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:04,571
- The show is about to start.

2
00:00:04,604 --> 00:00:06,406
You won't wanna miss this.

3
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,075
A five finger female feeding

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,011
these dooling deer

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,412
a tail biting tagalong

6
00:00:13,546 --> 00:00:16,649
or this crazy
kangaroo knockout.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,285
These hilarious
animal clips and more

8
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,288
next on "World's
Funniest Animals".

9
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,727
Welcome back to "World's
Funniest Animals".

10
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:29,929
I'm your host Elizabeth Stanton.

11
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,798
Today I'm joined by
my trusty sidekicks,

12
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:34,100
Hank and Ruby, and a few friends

13
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:38,405
and panelists as well as our
celebrity guests, Toby Rand.

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,141
- Hi everyone, I'm
really looking forward

15
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,510
to getting stuck into
tonight's festivities.

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,979
- Thanks for being here Toby.

17
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,348
Hank, Ruby and I are
excited to introduce you

18
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,484
to some of the best clips of
some of your favorite animals

19
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,019
that we could find.

20
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,355
Trust us you're not gonna
wanna miss what's coming up.

21
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,223
Why is it that the smallest pets

22
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:59,325
tend to be the most scrappy?

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,361
In our next segment,
"Mighty Mini",

24
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,396
we get to root for
the little guy.

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,466
"Mighty Mini" brought
to you with commentary

26
00:01:06,499 --> 00:01:09,002
by our first panelist
singer, actor,

27
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:13,173
comedian, radio host
extraordinaire, Mikalah Gordon.

28
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,107
- Hi Liz.

29
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,442
- Are you ready for a little guy

30
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:17,811
to finally stand
up for themselves?

31
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,113
- The suspense is killing
me, play the clip.

32
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:30,356
This duck is like
come back here,

33
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,624
you have not paid the bill.

34
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,996
- Now we are joined
by actor, writer,

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,532
director, musician,
Maiara Walsh.

36
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:40,800
- Hi Liz.

37
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,602
- Are you ready for a
clip with this animal

38
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,338
who I am convinced has
a Napoleon complex?

39
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,306
- Let's see it.

40
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,522
Yeah, buster I might be
small, but I have a big roar.

41
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:09,262
- Our next panelist is the
amazing comedian, Brian Cooper.

42
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,430
Hi Liz.

43
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,798
- This next clip
shows us some animals

44
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,166
who just wanna play.

45
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,234
- Let's see it.

46
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,811
Two dogs, one toy.

47
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,823
- Now we have musician, singer,
songwriter, Brandon Rogers.

48
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:37,824
- So happy to be here Liz.

49
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,325
Nice to see you.

50
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,327
- We have a little guy
whose bite is just as big

51
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,029
as his bark in this clip.

52
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:43,830
- I gotta see this.

53
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:44,998
This is crazy.

54
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,047
I'm more impressed how the
other dog doesn't even move.

55
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,155
- This puppy is so cute.

56
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,024
He just wants to
play or is he hungry?

57
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:12,125
I can't tell.

58
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,715
- Oh, so cute.

59
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,807
- That is utterly adorable.

60
00:04:05,144 --> 00:04:07,547
- For some reason
my little Ruby here

61
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,048
thinks it's funny
to hide from me

62
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,351
whenever I'm looking
for her in the house.

63
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:14,887
But there's one thing that
always works, dinner time.

64
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,670
- That one dog is
just watching them,

65
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,372
like, "What are you guys doing?"

66
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,048
- This is the kind of
competition I've

67
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:42,915
been waiting for.

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,194
- Honestly, this is how I feel

69
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,996
when I'm waiting for
everyone else's food

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,164
to get to the table.

71
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,108
- This dog is so excited to
eat, but he's being so good.

72
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,632
- I think at this point
you just got to invest

73
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,067
in a lock and key.

74
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,431
- Today on "World's
Funniest Animals",

75
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,734
we're excited to bring a
special celebrity guest

76
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,469
to chat with us about their pet.

77
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,171
Please welcome
rockstar, Toby Rand.

78
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,706
Thanks for being here Toby.

79
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,608
I see you brought your
cat with you today.

80
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,610
- This is Tripp.

81
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,078
He's having a bad day.

82
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,314
He's like a part of
furniture, aren't you buddy?

83
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,648
But he doesn't leave
any hair anywhere.

84
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,150
So we're pretty
happy about that.

85
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,786
- I mean, no cat hair
is definitely a plus.

86
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,055
Have you ever worked with
any animals professionally?

87
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,957
- As you can see, I have
a real affinity with cats.

88
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,859
And this amazing thing
happened on scent once

89
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:35,128
when we were in
a line enclosure,

90
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,364
the line turned around lifted
its tail and peed all over me.

91
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,732
You heard that, didn't you?

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,635
- Thanks Toby and
Tripp for stopping by.

93
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,170
Great to see you both.

94
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:46,205
- Say goodbye Tripp, yeah
go and get lost somewhere.

95
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,940
Go on off you go, see ya.

96
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,877
- Some of the most playful pets

97
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,446
coming up next on "World's
Funniest Animals".

98
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,425
Remember that one toy
you couldn't let go of

99
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,494
when you were a kid,
also to these animals,

100
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,329
let's take a look at
some of these cuties

101
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,433
at play in our next
segment "Playtime Pooches".

102
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,918
- Girl, just put the
cushions wherever you want.

103
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,154
Feel free to
redecorate, whatever.

104
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,862
This puppy has
some new friends, Guinea pigs.

105
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,433
Hi there are, how are you?

106
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,601
Hello again?

107
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,770
Hi, nice to meet you.

108
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,239
What you doing?

109
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,008
Hi, wanna play?

110
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,625
- How would you be
able to pick just one?

111
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,715
- This is why our
pets need pets.

112
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,366
- Can we play back
the part when the dog

113
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,735
actually rolls over the balloon.

114
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:18,658
- We are back with one

115
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,826
of my favorite
segments, wild animals.

116
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,662
I can't wait to
show you what antics

117
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,097
these wild ones have been up to.

118
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,265
It's a wildlife.

119
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,648
- Wow, this family
has some skills.

120
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:44,550
Where do I sign up for this?

121
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,527
- What did I just watch?

122
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,662
Did he just flip
over on purpose?

123
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,787
- This guys are
really going at it.

124
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,079
- I mean, come on.

125
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,649
Who doesn't want to be a
part of this wrestling match?

126
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,935
Sometimes it's
tough to get comfortable.

127
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,312
Looks like he's just giving up.

128
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:25,084
- Definitely don't see
those in my backyard.

129
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,186
- A buck and a doe
ran into a carwash.

130
00:11:29,722 --> 00:11:32,658
Well actually only one of
them ran into the carwash.

131
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,694
The other ran through it.

132
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,030
Thank you, come again.

133
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,567
You're watching "World's
Funniest Animals".

134
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,802
We'll be right back.

135
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:55,514
I absolutely love to eat
and I know my pets do too.

136
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,285
Get ready for our next segment,
it's time to "Chow Down".

137
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,965
I don't know if I've seen
a dog eat a watermelon.

138
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,239
- He's on a diet.

139
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,141
He only has fruits and
veggies for treats.

140
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:35,888
- Who's down to cover my
full body in peanut butter

141
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,590
so I can do this?

142
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,879
- You know, when your
partner makes annoying noises

143
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:00,679
when they eat?

144
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:11,290
Once you pop the fun,
don't stop y'all.

145
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,827
- As cute as many of the animals

146
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,829
in our next segment may be.

147
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,431
Their behaviors remind
us that sometimes

148
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,234
it's best to leave
them in the wild.

149
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,436
Check out some of
these untamed beast

150
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,338
in "Rumble in the Jungle".

151
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:39,885
- This golf course takes playing

152
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,588
in the rough to a
whole another level.

153
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,798
- Help I'm falling I can't
get up, oh I'm good.

154
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:58,097
- This is amazing, imagine
seeing this in person.

155
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,035
- The people on this
whale watching tour

156
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,937
definitely got
their money's worth.

157
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:13,245
- Remember size matters
not small but strong.

158
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,981
Coming up next on "World's
Funniest Animals".

159
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,159
Sometimes it doesn't matter

160
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:28,627
how small you are.

161
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,297
If you have a big enough
bark, that could be enough.

162
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,098
Small but strong.

163
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,115
This goat is like
a boxing trainer.

164
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,184
Like come on, Rocky
hit me, hit me harder.

165
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:53,519
Is that all you got?

166
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,934
- Cats are so evil.

167
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,179
- Okay, remember the rules.

168
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:23,515
No face hits, that's
my money maker.

169
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,150
Hey, I said not the face.

170
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:41,233
This dog is like, "Thanks
mom I love my new toy."

171
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,208
- Okay, hear the
rule, we can play.

172
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,579
But the minute you get too
close, you got to close.

173
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,995
- This puppy is like, "Okay,
so if I win the tug of war,

174
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,230
"What do I get?

175
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:12,131
"A treat?"

176
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,066
All right a treat it is.

177
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,516
- Okay, I said you can play
with my toy for a minute.

178
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,051
It is now getting out of hand.

179
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,854
Let go, let go.

180
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:42,661
- Sometimes the best playmate
for your pet is another pet.

181
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,664
Get ready to "Party
All The Time".

182
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,906
- Got to love
community pool day.

183
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,248
- Pool party.

184
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,291
- Something tells me
that they're not sticking

185
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,393
to the no peeing
in the pool rule.

186
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,373
- These beers are
having so much fun

187
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:29,608
but look at their reactions.

188
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,443
They know they
don't belong there.

189
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,984
- Well, that's almost it for us

190
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,819
but just in case
you missed anything

191
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,089
here is a quick recap of
all of the funniest moments.

192
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,960
Squeaking swine, silly Sloss,
daring dogs, friendly foxes

193
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,329
courageous Courtneys,
tight tigers.

194
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,631
Somebody's heads
on the golf course

195
00:18:52,664 --> 00:18:56,335
and an owner who had an eating
competition with his dogs.

196
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,403
Maybe I should try
that, probably not.

197
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:07,846
Well that's all we have
time for on this episode

198
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,781
of "World's Funniest Animals".

199
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,550
A special thanks to our panel

200
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,052

guest, Toby Rand.

201
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,521
Thanks for joining us.

202
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:17,222
- Bye everyone, thank you
so much for having me.

203
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,991
Be safe

204
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,659

00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,061

soon for more insane

206
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:27,032
