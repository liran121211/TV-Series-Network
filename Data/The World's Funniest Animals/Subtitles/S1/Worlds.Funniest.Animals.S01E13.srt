1
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:06,340
- Get ready for more
hilarious animal antics.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,776
We've got a bad to the
bone bulldog, a hind leg

3
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:14,248
hopping hound, and a kitty
who doesn't want to be caught.

4
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,650
You're watching World's
Funniest Animals.

5
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,523
I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton.

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,759
Welcome back to World's
Funniest Animals.

7
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:28,495
Today, I'm joined by my trusty
sidekicks, Hank and Ruby.

8
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:30,430
And a few friends and panelists,

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,233
as well as our celebrity
guests Bradford Anderson,

10
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,501
Hi Liz!

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,869
We're so happy to be
here, right buddy?

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,337
- And Breille Barbusca.

13
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,473
- Hey everyone, We're
super happy to be here

14
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:42,009
and excited to watch all
of the videos tonight.

15
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:43,543
- Thanks guys.

16
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,380
Hank, Ruby, and I are excited
to introduce you to some of

17
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,016
the best clips of some
of your favorite animals

18
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,217
that we could find.

19
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,119
If your pet is
anything like mine,

20
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:55,489
they don't think there's
anywhere that they can't go.

21
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,626
These next animals don't have
a sense of boundaries either.

22
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:00,894
Let's take a look.

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,096
Wild
Animals at Home.

24
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,065
Brought to you with
commentary from our first

25
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,601
panelists, actor Carmen Hodgson.

26
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,403
- What's up Liz.

27
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,904
- Are you ready for
some animals who have

28
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,940
snuck into places
they don't belong?

29
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,409
- Ooh, Awesome. Let's see it.

30
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,419
- Okay, This is so crazy.

31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,721
The fact that everything
is just so calm before,

32
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,755
and then BAM!

33
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,564
Oh my God, I think I
have the wrong house.

34
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:48,041
- Our next panelist is the
amazing comedian Brian Cooper.

35
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,509
- Hi, Liz.

36
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,611
- This next clip features
an animal who is not

37
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,946
in their natural habitat.

38
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,816
- Now I've got to see this.

39
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,650
Wow!

40
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:00,687
- Ah, ha!

41
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,459
- Bro!

42
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,293
Oh my God, what are you doing?

43
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,696
- Narration is the best.

44
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:10,530
Wow!

45
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,135
Now we are joined by
actor, writer, producer,

46
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,403
Noah Matthews.

47
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:17,237
- Hey, Liz.

48
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:18,605
Show me what you got.

49
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,207
We have an animal who
has managed to get

50
00:02:20,207 --> 00:02:22,175
into a pretty sticky situation.

51
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,177
- Oh, yhis should
be interesting.

52
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:28,048
Slowly open it.

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,318
Okay, open it up dear.

54
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,286
There you go.

55
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:35,589
There you go.

56
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,193
- We got two big ways
for him to get out

57
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,828
and he just won't go either way.

58
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,398
Okay, mind if I
snap a picture or two as well?

59
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,232
Yeah.

60
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,541
We didn't want
him coming down this way,

61
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:56,710
so I've kind of
guarded this area.

62
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,944
- Okay.

63
00:02:57,944 --> 00:02:59,279
He's almost
there, come on.

64
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,914
Go for it, man.

65
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,149
- That turkey is like

66
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,251
"Okay, only one of you
tell me which way."

67
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:05,352
I am getting confused.

68
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,621
It's right there. You
know.

69
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:13,260
There he goes.

70
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,094
There he goes!

71
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,666
- For our final panelist,
we have singer, actor,

72
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,569
comedian, radio
host, Mikalah Gordon.

73
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,837
Hi Liz.

74
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,872
- Are you ready for
some wild animals

75
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,507
in a not so wild setting?

76
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:28,742
- What?

77
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,377
I need to see this.

78
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:33,980
Ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

79
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,015
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

80
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:35,949
Get down!

81
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,617
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

82
00:03:37,617 --> 00:03:38,452
Come on!

83
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,520
Prose.

84
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,522
Prose!

85
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:44,691
Go on out!

86
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,126
- It seems like
this has happened

87
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,828
enough times where they've
now named the bear.

88
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:50,597
Prose!

89
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:51,731
Go on out!

90
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,566
Ah!

91
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:54,801
Go on out.

92
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,269
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

93
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:00,674
Come on!

94
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,642
- Did you know that brown bats
have been known to hibernate

95
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:05,145
for up to a year at a time?

96
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:08,415
That's a napping talent I
really wish I have myself.

97
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,318
But the animal skills
we're about to see

98
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,820
will really make you envious in

99
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,822
our next segment, Hidden
Talent.

100
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,034
- Did that dog just catch
a bucket, and then catch

101
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:29,636
balls in the bucket?

102
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,439
Wait a second.

103
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:55,529
- Such a good and patient pup.

104
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,585
- This is how
champions are trained.

105
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:19,452
Horse yoga.

106
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:26,059
- It's time for my favorite
segment of the show,

107
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:27,794
where a celebrity
guest and their pets

108
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,396
come to us from their home.

109
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,798
From Modern Family
and The Starter Wife,

110
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,301
the amazing Brielle Barbusca.

111
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:36,403
Hey Brielle, thanks
for joining us.

112
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,771
So who
do we have here?

113
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,907
Hey Liz, this is my dog Lola.

114
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,375
She's my best friend.

115
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:44,811
Even though she doesn't want
to stay here with me right now.

116
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,313
- Do you think
Lola has any tricks

117
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,981
that can make her go viral?

118
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:51,151
- Now, Lola does
not have many tricks

119
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:53,587
that would make her
an internet star.

120
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,256
Besides stealing my snacks.

121
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:58,358
- Brielle, I hear you
had an experience on set

122
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,795
that turned into a bit
of a dog and pony show.

123
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,330
Tell us about that.

124
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,832
- I worked on a movie last
year called The Adventures

125
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:09,903
of Dally and Spanky, and onset
there was a pony and a dog.

126
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:14,107
And the dog would literally
ride the pony around set.

127
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,976
I think they became
internet stars.

128
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,877
- Thanks again for
joining us Brielle.

129
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,547
Some of the
best train pets coming up

130
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,449
next on World's
Funniest Animals.

131
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,360
- I used to have
a coach who said

132
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,396
"perfect practice
makes perfect."

133
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,332
If that's the case, the
animals in our next segment

134
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:43,336
have been practicing
perfectly for a long time.

135
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,472
Let's check out their
insane abilities

136
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,641
in Training Day.

137
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,123
- I got to work on my moves

138
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,724
and my dog's moves
at this point.

139
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,154
- Yay!

140
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,722
The jump
is the best part.

141
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:38,491
- Yay!

142
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:41,227
Up.

143
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,297
Up.

144
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:49,202
Up.

145
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,171
- Not sure who's better
- the dog jumping

146
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:52,939
on his hind legs, or his friends

147
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,708
that trust him and don't move.

148
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,045
Up.

149
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,047
Up.

150
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:02,916
Up.

151
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:17,831
- Oh, Okay, he's
just a big baby.

152
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,998
That's adorable!

153
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:25,038
- I'm excited to introduce
our celebrity guests

154
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,906
to World's Funniest Animals.

155
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:29,676
And I'm even more excited
that they brought their pet.

156
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,479
From General
Hospital, it's Bradford Anderson

157
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,980
Bradford, who do you have here?

158
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,249
- This is Dublin,
our 15 week old

159
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,751
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

160
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,919
Can you say hey, bud?

161
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,924
- I have to ask, even though
Dublin is just a puppy,

162
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,126
does he know any tricks?

163
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,360
- He's got many talents.

164
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,931
Some of his favorite things
to do are to chew shoes,

165
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:54,200
especially little
kids water shoes.

166
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,435
Right?

167
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,669
That smell good?

168
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,505
And then of course
mommy's nice shoes.

169
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,739
Oh, very exciting.

170
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:03,877
But, beyond shoe
chewing and waking us up

171
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,213
three times a night, he's
an incredible soccer player.

172
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,867
- These are some pretty
serious defense skills he has.

173
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,069
Thanks so much for
sharing with us Bradford.

174
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,404
- Thank you so much, Liz.

175
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,273
It was such a blast
being here with you.

176
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:34,374
Right, bud?

177
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,575
Yes.

178
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,409
Yes.

179
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,243
Yes, yes.

180
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,478
Yes.

181
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:40,513
They say that
imitation is the most

182
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,882
sincere form of flattery.

183
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,185
If that's the case,
these next animals are

184
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,054
really working it to
try and compliment their

185
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:49,689
human counterparts.

186
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:50,990
In our next segment,

187
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,825
Just Like Us.

188
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:09,042
- That's about as cute
as it gets right there.

189
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,248
- Oh my God, hey!

190
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,816
It's Elton John's dog!

191
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,990
- Did they have to
hand-make that outfit?

192
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,692
Where do you even
buy one of those?

193
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:40,039
- Obviously trust fund kids.

194
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,107
Am I right?

195
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:56,022
- I'm telling you, I only
doggy paddle with my shades on.

196
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,030
- Some of the cutest
clips I've ever seen,

197
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,966
coming up next on
World's Funniest Animals.

198
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,645
- These next animals
aren't all bark.

199
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:20,713
They have the skills
to back it up.

200
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:21,881
Mad Skillz.

201
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:40,199
- This little dog is
having so much fun.

202
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,342
- This is the way that
I want to walk my dog

203
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:52,078
on the beach every time.

204
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,785
- Hey guys, this is
what you look like.

205
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,159
Here we go.

206
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:23,476
- This puppy's amazing!

207
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:25,478
Good job!

208
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,312
Come on.

209
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,623
- Most of the time, wild
animals belong in two places:

210
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,292
out in nature to be
admired from afar,

211
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:42,161
and on our televisions
making us laugh.

212
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:45,164
But these next critters
stuck their noses, and their

213
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:48,334
antlers and trunks
where they shouldn't be.

214
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,003
And it's pretty great.

215
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,872
Animals Where They Don't Belong.

216
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,783
- Oh, this video is so deer.

217
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,913
- It's a bear.
- Holy...

218
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,716
It's a bear.

219
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,654
It's a bear!

220
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,491
What are you doing?

221
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,026
- This bear is like
"yeah, I'm not interested

222
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,194
in that kind of party."

223
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,497
I've never
seen a bear in a hotel.

224
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,936
I've never
seen a bear.

225
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:04,010
There's a raccoon.

226
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,760
- Can you imagine declaring
that on your insurance?

227
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,595
Yes, the dent came
when I was attacked

228
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,464
by a group of bison.

229
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,108
- More unbelievable
animals to come on

230
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,243
World's Funniest Animals.

231
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:48,287
- They say that
imitation is the most

232
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,623
sincere form of flattery.

233
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,392
If that's the case, these
next animals are really

234
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:57,430
working it to try and compliment
their human counterparts.

235
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,631
In our next segment,

236
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,566
You Look Familiar.

237
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,308
- Yeah, I just like to swing.

238
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,794
- I'm just waiting for this
cat to bite his own fingers.

239
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:30,463
That is what I want to see.

240
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,814
- I got the car, I
got the clothes,

241
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,149
the hat, and the shades.

242
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,951
What else do you need ladies?

243
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,275
- This looks like every couple

244
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,878
that's been married
over 20 years.

245
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,582
Harry, Harry!

246
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,551
Yes, dear.

247
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:32,058
- Crack open the notepad,

248
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,293
because these expert
trainers are going

249
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,096
to show you some amazing tricks
they've taught their pet.

250
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,331
Pets Have Talent.

251
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,550
- Nothing funny here,
just impressive.

252
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,961
- Okay, this is
just one of those...

253
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,062
wow videos.

254
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,965
I'm speechless.

255
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,906
- I do this every Saturday,

256
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:20,940
with double dutch.

257
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,177
- Want to do some tricks?

258
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:26,012
Go under.

259
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:26,846
Good boy.

260
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,381
Lay down.

261
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,582
Lay down.

262
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,850
Roll over.

263
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,684
Oh, so fast.

264
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:32,919
High five.

265
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,087
- I think it would make
my absolute day if my

266
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,089
dog high five me.

267
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:39,625
Like, it would make me so happy.

268
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,795
- Go around.

269
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,596
Can you go under?

270
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,264
Can you jump over?

271
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:46,499
Ooh, good boy!

272
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,600
- Okay, I will do
all these things

273
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,368
if I got a treat every time.

274
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,304
Come on, someone
give me some candy!

275
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,673
- Can you do some dancing?

276
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,974
Give me kisses.

277
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,442
Thank you.

278
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,083
Oh!

279
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:06,218
Good job, Poop.

280
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,896
- I balanced on the
beam, and then the stick,

281
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,230
and you keep
putting stuff on me.

282
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,799
What is next?

283
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,200
I just want to be a dog.

284
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:36,015
Speak.

285
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,683
Whisper.

286
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:39,552
Whisper

287
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,588
- I have a few neighborhood
dogs that can learn how

288
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:43,622
to whisper

289
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,623
Speak.

290
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,392
Whisper.

291
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,893
- Well, that's almost it for us,

292
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,763
but just in case you missed
anything, here's a quick recap

293
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,999
of all of the funniest moments.

294
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:56,802
A defrauding deer, a bevy of
bison, an encroaching elephant

295
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,106
munching monkeys, driving
dogs, a horse doing yoga,

296
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,874
and a bear who has
decided he wanted to

297
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:04,276
take a load off indoors.

298
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:14,653
Well, that's it
for this episode of

299
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,455
World's Funniest Animals.

300
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,324
A special thanks
to our panel and

301
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,593
to our celebrity
guests for joining us.

302
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,161
- My pleasure, thanks Liz.

303
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,329
- Thanks for having us, Liz.

304
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,530
Off to play.

305
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,332
I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton,

306
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,768
and I'll be back with
more hilarious videos

307
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,603
on World's Funniest Animals.

308
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:31,670
Until next time.

309
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,085
Oh, God!

310
00:19:58,397 --> 00:19:59,565
There we goes!
