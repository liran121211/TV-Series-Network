1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,970
Take a seat
and make sure to buckle in,

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:05,238
because on this show,

3
00:00:05,271 --> 00:00:07,407
we've got a buffet fit
for a group of geckos,

4
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,442
grand buffet,

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,512
street-crossing salmon,

6
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:14,547
a seat-stealing seal,

7
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:17,350
and a pig who loves parkour.

8
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,919
You're tuned in to
World's Funniest Animals.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,224
Here at World's
Funniest Animals,

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,226
humans take a back seat for once

11
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,229
and we put the spotlight on
some of the best animal clips

12
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,131
the internet has to offer.

13
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,799
I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton,

14
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:35,635
and these are my trusty
sidekicks, Hank and Ruby,

15
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,338
joined today with a few of
my friends and panelists,

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,306
as well as our celebrity guests,

17
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,075
Ace Young and Diana DeGarmo.

18
00:00:42,108 --> 00:00:44,344
- Hey, Liz!
- Hey, Liz!

19
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,346
We're so excited to
get this started!

20
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,548
- I'm so excited to show you

21
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,617
some compilations of
our favorite home videos

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,386
of animals being
absolutely hilarious.

23
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,155
Let's dive in.

24
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:56,689
Dinner time!

25
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,259
Brought to you with commentary
from our first panelist,

26
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:01,828
the hilarious
comedian, Neel Ghosh.

27
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,096
- Hey, Liz.

28
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,964
- Are you ready for
some hungry animals?

29
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,599
- I'm feeling a
little hungry myself.

30
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,676
I should start doing this.

31
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,279
This would make eating and
watching TV super convenient.

32
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,614
It's like half
eating, half grooming.

33
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,684
- Our next panelist is
actor, Carmen Hodgson.

34
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:26,152
- What's up, Liz?

35
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,488
- This next clip features
a very hungry animal.

36
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,557
- So I could definitely
relate to this.

37
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,567
Yeah, sure, everyone gets a
knife and a piece of bread,

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,068
but no, I have to lick the jar.

39
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,369
This is degrading!

40
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,107
- Now we're joined
by actor, writer,

41
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,442
director, musician,
Maiara Walsh.

42
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:50,710
- Hey, Liz.

43
00:01:50,743 --> 00:01:52,779
- We have an animal
who can't wait to eat.

44
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:53,613
- Perfect.

45
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,819
I got this.

46
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,554
I don't need your
help, I got it.

47
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:09,028
Okay, help me.

48
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,335
- For our final panelist,
we have top-notch comedian,

49
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,603
Brian Cooper.

50
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,037
- Hi, Liz!

51
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,440
- Are you ready for some animals
digging into their dinner?

52
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,276
- Sounds like I came
here at the perfect time.

53
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,210
Bring on the food!

54
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,990
Yeah, really funny, Mom.

55
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,058
Can we just get two bowls?

56
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,502
- Birds of a feather
flock together,

57
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,237
or so the saying goes,

58
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,772
but some of the best
friendships come

59
00:02:52,805 --> 00:02:54,807
when we meet people, or animals,

60
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,943
that are completely
different from us.

61
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,078
Let's check out some
unexpected pairings

62
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,381
in our segment,
Opposites Attract.

63
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,450
Animal friendship.

64
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,865
- If this is a Mortal Kombat
between Bambi and a puppy,

65
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:21,401
I'm sorry, I'm going
Bambi every time.

66
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:32,212
The best part of this
is the kid's commentary.

67
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:38,484
That is the
cutest thing I ever saw.

68
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,696
- Baby cows are so adorable.

69
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:02,408
- Oh, this is "Lion
King" part four,

70
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,676
they replaced Timon.

71
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,144
Yeah, I know this.

72
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,058
Hakuna matata, everyone!

73
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,737
- This dog is so chill.

74
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,343
- I'm so excited for this
next part of our show

75
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,979
where we talk to a celebrity
guest and their pet,

76
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,048
and today, I'm even more excited

77
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,317
because we have on
a celebrity couple.

78
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:48,021
From "American Idol," welcome
Diana DeGarmo and Ace Young.

79
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,489
- Hey, Liz!
- How are you?

80
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,958
This is our foster puppy, Amber.

81
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:53,192
- She's very sleepy right now,

82
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,794
it's hard being a puppy.

83
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,896
- I get it, Amber,
I can only imagine

84
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,498
what being a puppy must be like.

85
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,033
Sounds exhausting.

86
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,569
Diana, I hear you have a
pretty interesting story

87
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:05,872
about working with
a horse in a movie.

88
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,473
That, I have to hear.

89
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:12,345
- Okay, so this one time, I was
on a set for a western film.

90
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,882
We're in Southern California,
we're atop this beautiful hill

91
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:19,352
overlooking the countryside,
my human co-star

92
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,521
is on his horse, I'm on mine,

93
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,624
and then the poor horse

94
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:28,528
had gastric distress.

95
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,197
For hours.

96
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:34,200
Needless to say,
what should've taken

97
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:36,869
maybe 30 minutes to film

98
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,039
took all day.

99
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,542
But I think he was
feeling better at the end.

100
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:43,943
Coming
up, we have some pets

101
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,612
who have definitely
had better days.

102
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:49,916
Don't Mess With Me, next on
World's Funniest Animals.

103
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,795
Sometimes, you just
want to be left alone.

104
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,531
Everyone needs to recharge
every once in a while,

105
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,667
and our pets are no exception.

106
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,636
Take a look at these grumpy
animals in our segment,

107
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,771
Don't Mess With Me.

108
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:17,276
- Uh oh, torpedo cat.

109
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,180
Engage.

110
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,816
Three, two, one.

111
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,017
Bang!

112
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,024
I love the ending where
the cat just stares.

113
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,560
Like, "I almost had you."

114
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:53,079
- That's how I sound
in the morning.

115
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,489
I would be yelling too

116
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,558
if that guy kept
tapping me on the head.

117
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,536
- Wow, he is so gentle,

118
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:20,406
he's so majestic, just
look at his proud stride.

119
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:23,075
Roll the windows
up, roll them up!

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,449
- Wait a minute, one
more time on that.

121
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,002
- Who did it better?

122
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,919
- You know when you just judo
chop your cat in the forehead?

123
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,688
Yeah, that's what you deserve.

124
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,326
- If you're like me, you
probably have a doggy gate

125
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:14,560
set up where you live.

126
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,462
For my pets, it works.

127
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,097
For these next animals,

128
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,233
that could hardly
hold them back.

129
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,834
Here's Jailbreak.

130
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,978
'Sup, little guy?

131
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,083
- Squirrels do not mess around.

132
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,418
'Sup, little guy?

133
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,374
- Okay, this is
definitely pig parkour.

134
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,150
- And here we are at the
200 meter hurdle race

135
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,619
and oops, he's
immediately disqualified.

136
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:31,070
- Okay, one thing I've learned
from all of these clips

137
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:33,105
is that you have to
put a roof on stuff.

138
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,075
- Hey guys, excited to
chat with you today.

139
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:38,578
So I know Amber is pretty tired,

140
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,347
but does she happen to
know any tricks we can see?

141
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,015
- Is being cute a trick?

142
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,685
'Cause she is incredible
at being cute,

143
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,354
and she's really
good at sitting,

144
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:53,392
and jumping, we think she
might be part kangaroo.

145
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:55,795
We're waiting on
the DNA results.

146
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:58,364
- We'll wake her up, we'll
try some tricks for you.

147
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,332
Come here!

148
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,199
Come here, Amber!

149
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,535
Yeah!

150
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:03,970
There's our girl!

151
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,238
- Well, after all that,
I can definitely see

152
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,974
why she is so tired.

153
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,210
Coming up, we have
some friendships

154
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,779
that go against everything
cartoons taught us.

155
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,750
- We'll be right back with
more World's Funniest Animals.

156
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:29,128
- Dogs and cats, cats and birds,

157
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,331
cats and pretty much any animal,
now that I think about it,

158
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,301
conventionally, are not
supposed to get along.

159
00:10:35,334 --> 00:10:38,437
These next clips break
all the stereotypes.

160
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,739
A World of Difference.

161
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,089
- This is the cutest
thing in the world.

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,571
"Are you my mother?"

163
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,315
- "Yeah, man, come on,

164
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,250
"I'm gonna show you
right where the oats are.

165
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:26,152
"Yep, just follow me, I got you.

166
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,888
"You know I always take care
of my boys, come on, let's go."

167
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,830
"Yeah, yeah, so dude came
at me and I was just like,

168
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,599
"and then
he was like,

169
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,134
"and then I was like 'whoa!'"

170
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,004
And the duck's just like,
"Man, get out of here!"

171
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,859
- The dog's face when he turns
around and looks at the cat.

172
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,962
Like, did he not know
who was doing that?

173
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,711
- This bed's too soft.

174
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,179
This bed's too hard.

175
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:34,186
This one's just right.

176
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,657
- Now one of my
favorite segments,

177
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:42,495
because I absolutely love to
eat and I know my pets do too,

178
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,096
get ready for our next segment,

179
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,131
Supper Club.

180
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,074
- This chinchilla looks
really deep in thought.

181
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,475
I wonder what it's thinking.

182
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,713
"If this woman
doesn't stop filming me

183
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,815
"eat every meal, I'm
gonna freak out!"

184
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,427
Man, don't you
hate going into a restaurant

185
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,630
with your friends and
there's the one person

186
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,999
who eats way too slow?

187
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:24,637
This is that person.

188
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,812
- Try some of that.

189
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:34,580
Oh, no.

190
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,982
Whatever you say.

191
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:44,557
- This Crocodile Dundee son
having lunch with animals

192
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,393
and letting the animals
eat off of his plate, okay.

193
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:48,661
- Wanna try some of that?

194
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,065
Good, right?

195
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,569
Come up here if
you want the rest.

196
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,470
Cereal and
a bottle of wine.

197
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,641
It's always nice to have a
sit-down dinner with the family.

198
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,484
"Jerry, that's mine.

199
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,953
"Dude, quit licking my food.

200
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,723
"Come on, Dave, you too?"

201
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:25,698
- Coming up, some pets
just can't be contained.

202
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:28,300
We have some escape
artists in these next clips

203
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,102
on World's Funniest Animals.

204
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,182
Did you know that Houdini
one staged a harrowing escape

205
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,351
from inside a sea monster?

206
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,585
Really!

207
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,021
This next segment may
not be as cool as that,

208
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:51,590
but I bet even Houdini
could've learned something

209
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:53,959
from these canine jail breakers.

210
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,227
Planned Escape.

211
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,835
Why do we even
take dogs to the park anymore?

212
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,103
Do they even really need us?

213
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,505
You can just give them
the car keys by now.

214
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,576
Good boy!

215
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,427
"See,
Barry, the key to

216
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,529
"opening up doors
without thumbs is simple.

217
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:32,564
"You gotta proportion
your weight.

218
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,467
"Yeah, there we go.

219
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,236
"Ah, yep, see, it's
in your weight."

220
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,415
Wow.

221
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,883
The one thing a horse
is supposed to do

222
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,718
is jump over a fence.

223
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:56,722
Run, Forrest, run!

224
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,737
- Why did the fish
cross the road?

225
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,405
Because the river
ran through it.

226
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:23,082
- Finally, I can take
my fish for a walk!

227
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:26,151
I could be a
wish-walker!

228
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:28,988
- Everyone has their good
days and their bad days.

229
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:31,190
These next animals
are definitely not

230
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:32,291
having a good day.

231
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,225
Up The Wall.

232
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,673
- Yeah, this dog is
not being subtle,

233
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,408
he does not want
to share his bed.

234
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:04,490
Which one's the robot?

235
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,224
I can't even tell.

236
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,232
- Actually, this really
isn't a good time,

237
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:15,968
he takes his meal
time very seriously.

238
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,041
No,
you've had enough.

239
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,643
Your breakfast is gone, move on.

240
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,113
No, you'll get more tonight

241
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,783
at supper, you are not starving.

242
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,652
No, you're not,
you're on a diet.

243
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,098
No--

244
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,667
No more breakfast!

245
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,770
Listen--

246
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:02,047
Oh, my--

247
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,282
What just happened,
did he hit you?

248
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:04,883
- Oh man, he hit
me really strong!

249
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,418
Are you okay?

250
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,087
- We need to see
that in slow-mo.

251
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,027
- That had to hurt.

252
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,770
- Permission to approach
the bench, denied.

253
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:33,745
- Yeah, I would get right up

254
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,680
if a seal growled
at me like that.

255
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:35,781
Have you seen their teeth?

256
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,784
- Well, that's almost it for us,

257
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,919
but just in case
you missed anything,

258
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:44,123
here is a quick recap of
all of the funniest moments.

259
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,024
A haywire horse, a daring dog,

260
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,060
a clip that took the
term "dog and pony show"

261
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,462
to a whole new level,
an exasperated elephant,

262
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,664
a tourist who was rudely
kicked out of his seat

263
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:55,067
by a local sea lion,
and a cowboy who must

264
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,469
really enjoy his family dinners.

265
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,937
We've really covered a lot!

266
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,179
Our time's up on
this week's episode

267
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,981
of World's Funniest Animals.

268
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,316
A huge thanks to
our fantastic panel

269
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,553
and to our celebrity guests,
Diana DeGarmo and Ace Young,

270
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,555
for bringing their
pet on the show.

271
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:18,657
- Thank you, our pleasure.

272
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,325
- Amber's, too.

273
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:22,794
- I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton,

274
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,596
and Ruby and I
are off to uncover

275
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,632
some more interesting
animal clips.

276
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,933
See you next time!

277
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,001
Can you wave bye?

278
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:30,135
Wave bye-bye?

279
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:48,587
'Sup, little guy?
