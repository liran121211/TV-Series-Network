Get
your friends together.

2
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,672
The show is about to start.

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:06,940
We're bringing you,

4
00:00:06,973 --> 00:00:08,742
some running rovers,

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,177
a few fidgeting felines,

6
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:13,013
some peeking pooches,

7
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,548
and laugh inducing laughs.

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,783
All this and more

9
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,785
on "World's Funniest Animals".

10
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,657
Welcome back to "World's
Funniest Animals",

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,493
I'm your host Elizabeth Stanton.

12
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,763
And these are my
curators Ruby and Hank.

13
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,898
They are great at their job.

14
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:33,366
Which is good news for you

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,135
because tonight's
episode features

16
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,805
loads of new hilarious clips
that you won't want to miss.

17
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,307
Today I'm joined by a
few friends and panelists

18
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,077
as well as our celebrity
guest Dan Sperry.

19
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,412
- Hey Liz thanks for having me.

20
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,714
Hi everyone I'm shock
illusionist Dan Sperry

21
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:48,915
coming to you from Las Vegas

22
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:50,817
with my best friend Spike.

23
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,885
- Thanks guys.

24
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,887
So let's get right into it.

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,622
Is it just me or is there

26
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,825
a lot of pressure to
stay in shape these days?

27
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,127
Every where we turn there's
a new work out routine,

28
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,329
or supplement that
we've got to have.

29
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,165
But it turns out
the animal kingdom

30
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,599
is no different.

31
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,502
And our furry friends
strive to stay in shape too.

32
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:11,838
Animals Exercising
brought to you

33
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,940
with commentary from
our first panelist

34
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,509
the hilarious
comedian Neel Ghosh.

35
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,011
- Hey Liz happy to be here.

36
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,346
- Are you ready for a
little animal exercise?

37
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,048
- Well don't keep me
waiting for this long,

38
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,783
the suspense is killing me!

39
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,028
Ah hey man can you
check on my delts?

40
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,100
You might be getting a workout,

41
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,402
I just really don't
like this tire.

42
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,505
- Our next panelist is
actor Carmen Hodgson.

43
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:47,841
- Ooh what clips do you
have for me tonight Liz?

44
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,375
I'm so excited!

45
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,245
- This next clip features
an animal work out partner.

46
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,180
I need a furry friend
for my work outs.

47
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,549
- I can't!
- Push up.

48
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,750
I can't!

49
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,718
Yes you can.

50
00:01:58,751 --> 00:01:59,953
Yes you can see look at that.

51
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:02,655
Look at you!

52
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,157
That's one.

53
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:07,627
- Is this considered
resistance training?

54
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,895
- Now we are joined by

55
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:11,631
Actor-Writer-Director-Musician
Maiara Walsh.

56
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:13,133
- Happy to be here Liz.

57
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,835
- Are you ready for
some exercising animals?

58
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,170
- Talk about motivation!

59
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,815
Burpees to the extreme!

60
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,587
- For our final panelist

61
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,657
we have top notch
comedian Brian Cooper.

62
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:38,892
- Happy to be here Liz!

63
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:40,960
Can't wait to see
what we've got today.

64
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,295
- We have an owner working out

65
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,464
with their pet in
this next clip.

66
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,032
- This has got to be good.

67
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,945
You think you can outstretch me?

68
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:00,747
You will be sorely mistaken.

69
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:10,089
- Even though this is
World's Funniest Animals,

70
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,492
while we were searching the
web for hilarious videos

71
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,628
to bring you, there were a
few that were just too cute

72
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:16,763
to pass up.

73
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:17,964
No laughs about it,

74
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,466
this segment is Just Plain Cute.

75
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,117
- This cat has skills.

76
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,896
- Aw so cute!

77
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:05,078
- This dog just expects
pets at every moment.

78
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,195
Get the water!

79
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,029
Get the water!

80
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:24,430
Get the water!

81
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,515
Oh is this a little pencil case?

82
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,983
Go back to school shopping?

83
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,257
- That is a fast kitten.

84
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,493
- I'm excited to introduce
our celebrity guest,

85
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,295
to "World's Funniest Animals".

86
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:58,264
And I'm even more excited
that they brought their pet.

87
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,334
In this case Las Vegas
magician Dan Sperry,

88
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,570
has a pet who is also
a lifelong coworker.

89
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:07,206
- Spike is a 16 year
old umbrella cockatoo

90
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,976
and I've had him since he
was about five months old.

91
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,912
And he can live to be
upwards of 60 years old.

92
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:15,615
And over the years we've
traveled all over the world

93
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,916
and met a lot of people,

94
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,418
encountered a lot
of crazy things.

95
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:20,520
So we've got plenty
of road stories,

96
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,954
isn't that right?

97
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,691
- Pets, performers or not,
always love attention.

98
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:26,592
Does Spike know any tricks?

99
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:27,527
- He likes to give kisses.

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,695
He does a couple tricks.

101
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,629
You gonna play dead?

102
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,797
Okay ready?

103
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,831
Bang!

104
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,700
Oh and then he's dead?

105
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,335
Can you come back to life?

106
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,402
Okay now he's back to life,

107
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:37,570
he's come back to life.

108
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,404
That's a big boy!

109
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,906
Good job buddy!

110
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,042
- So I hear that Spike is
a big fan of rock music.

111
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,477
You'll have to show us!

112
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,845
- He likes to listen
to Rob Zombie,

113
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:47,447
especially when we're
driving in the car.

114
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,823
When I'm backstage I usually
set up two folding chairs

115
00:05:56,856 --> 00:06:00,259
and let him fly the lengths
of the hallways backstage.

116
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,861
And we have, we
have a lot of fun.

117
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,197
- Thanks for stopping
by and joining us Dan.

118
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,264
- Thanks for having me.

119
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,232
Thanks everybody.

120
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,667
We'll see you guys later.

121
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,802
- Pets working to get
their owners' attention.

122
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,071
Coming up next on
World's Funniest Animals.

123
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,050
No one likes to be ignored,

124
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:26,919
but these animals in our
segment insist that you pay

125
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,455
attention to them at all times.

126
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,158
Some of these videos are
absolutely hysterical.

127
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,259
Check them out.

128
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,127
Play with me.

129
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,342
- This new cat hat will
keep you warm year round.

130
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,227
If we're going to continue
to play this game,

131
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,063
we're going to definitely have
to get you some deodorant.

132
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,892
- Aw, this is the
sweetest alarm clock.

133
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,497
It looks so much fun.

134
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,833
Can I play?

135
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,267
Can I?

136
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,135
Can I?

137
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,471
Come on, move over.

138
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,877
Never mind, I don't
want to play anymore.

139
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,527
- I can't tell if this
guy's the world's best gamer

140
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,596
who just really
can't be distracted,

141
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,731
or the world's meanest owner.

142
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,733
Play with him!

143
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,503
- You want to go for a walk?

144
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,204
You want to go for a walk?

145
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:32,345
- You better have taken
that dog on a walk.

146
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,614
- It's time for one of
my favorite segments,

147
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,750
curious pets, where we
see animals discovering

148
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:41,654
the world for the first time,
and it's pretty dang cute.

149
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,922
Curious pets.

150
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,175
- Ah, cat's favorite
pastime, hitting stuff.

151
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,530
- Here I am.

152
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,398
Now I'm not.

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,936
Oh, Hey, I'm back.

154
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:30,803
Peekaboo!

155
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:42,848
- This is how I would be,
if I worked in a cubicle

156
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:45,284
at an office, hey guys.

157
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:46,953
What's for lunch?

158
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,853
We're out of creamer.

159
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:49,989
Hire me.

160
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,257
- Hey guys, guys, give
you a little help in here.

161
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,362
- Smells good in here though.

162
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:32,064
- Some of the cutest
clips I've ever seen,

163
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,734
coming up next, on
World's Funniest Animals.

164
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,578
Are you ready for some animals

165
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,279
who just want to give some love?

166
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,281
These clips are
just too precious.

167
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,591
- Yay a snow day!

168
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,429
- This is every dog's dream.

169
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,103
Sit.

170
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:11,971
Sit, sit.

171
00:11:18,077 --> 00:11:20,046
- Well at least
the boy's trained.

172
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:21,881
Sit.

173
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:22,748
Sit.

174
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,454
- That's not fair, the kid
didn't even get a treat.

175
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,140
- This dog knows what he wants.

176
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,487
- This is the most
adorable wrestling match.

177
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,566
Look at that flow
between each other.

178
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:15,401
Each know each other's moves.

179
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,454
- That is what you
call a euphoric meal.

180
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,395
- Hank and Ruby are
my best friends.

181
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,097
We do everything together.

182
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,234
However, I'm surprised I
never thought of working out

183
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:49,735
with them.

184
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,670
These pets and their owners
have figured it all out.

185
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:16,896
- I need to limber up, I have
a walk plan for later on so.

186
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,943
- This is the only way I can
get this woman to exercise.

187
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,683
- No we're gonna get
there someday, I promise.

188
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:38,551
Oh never mind.

189
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:48,794
- And that pose earns
you a kitty kiss.

190
00:14:01,106 --> 00:14:03,509
- It almost looks like there's
one dog and one person,

191
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:04,710
but just double.

192
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:19,091
- Are you feeling
like you're all fluff?

193
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:20,860
Well we're gonna take
you to the next step

194
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:23,162
and make you an alpha dog.

195
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,882
- Okay, this dog is like,

196
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,784
ah, I told you I
wanted the blue one.

197
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,208
And one and two and three,
come on, let's keep it going.

198
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:17,449
Now this is the kind of
workout partner I want.

199
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,339
- It's very dangerous to do
lunges on a wood floor in socks.

200
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,626
- Didn't say I wanted
to kiss, all right?

201
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,294
I'm just lazy.

202
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,997
- The world's most curious
pets coming up next,

203
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,765
on World's Funniest Animals.

204
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,411
Welcome back let's jump right
into the fan favorite segment,

205
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,447
Investigative animals,

206
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,025
- DJ kitty scribble
kibble into his house.

207
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:37,262
- Yes, that last song
was Cat Scratch Fever.

208
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,364
One of my favorites.

209
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:53,312
- Hey mom, how do I have
cat fur in my water?

210
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:09,528
- The cat's just
like, hey, come on in.

211
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:12,631
It's warm in here,
you can trust me.

212
00:17:25,177 --> 00:17:28,147
- Now that is a
thorough carwash.

213
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,923
- Yeah you gotta pay a lot
extra for the cow tongue wash,

214
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,458
it's a delicacy.

215
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,895
- No matter how much tug
of war or fetch you play,

216
00:17:42,928 --> 00:17:44,897
it'll never be
enough for some pets.

217
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,599
These clips are a
prime example of that.

218
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,735
I will not be ignored.

219
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:09,621
- This kitten is like
stay away from my woman,

220
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,543
I'll blend
in with the cabinets.

221
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:35,514
So maybe he won't
see me, if I..

222
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:41,920
Oh!

223
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,188
That's right, I got ya.

224
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,057
- Okay.

225
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:51,330
Oh my god!

226
00:18:51,363 --> 00:18:52,364
- Oh my god!

227
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:02,374
- This goes from super cute
to super scary real quick.

228
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,644
- Um, a little problem here.

229
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,714
- Well that's almost it for us,

230
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:10,649
but just in case
you missed anything,

231
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:13,952
here's a quick recap of all
of the funniest moments.

232
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,656
A collapsing cat, a curious
cow, a workout drill dog,

233
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,359
rollicking red pandas,
a devious Dalmatian,

234
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,861
a robbing retriever, and
a couple who has managed

235
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,063
to turn their pets
into workout equipment.

236
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:25,898
That's a new one.

237
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,142
Well that's it for this episode
of World's Funniest Animals.

238
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,777
