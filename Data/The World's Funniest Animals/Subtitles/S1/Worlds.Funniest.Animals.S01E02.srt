1
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:05,572
You won't want
to miss what we've got in store

2
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,509
because today on the show we
have a piano tuning pooch,

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:11,244
a cat who loves camo,

4
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,913
and one of the cheekiest
chipmunks you've ever seen

5
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:18,251
all on this episode of
World's Funniest Animals.

6
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:20,620
You're watching World's
Funniest Animals.

7
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,489
I'm your host, Elizabeth Stanton

8
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,392
and these are my trusty
sidekicks, Hank and Ruby.

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,927
Joined today with a few of
my friends and panelists,

10
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,964
as well as our celebrity
guest, Dee Wallace.

11
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,465
- Hey Elizabeth.

12
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,000
Hey everybody.

13
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,935
- Animals are the absolute best.

14
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,637
They greet us when we come home,

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,906
they can sense when we're
sad, and every now and then

16
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:42,175
they can give us those big eyes

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,511
and tuck their tails
back between their legs

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:49,149
and let us know they've
done something guilty.

19
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,951
Brought to you with commentary
from our first panelist

20
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,855
actor, writer, director,
and musician, Maiara Walsh.

21
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,491
- Hey Liz, thank you
so much for having me.

22
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,127
I'm so excited to
watch these clips.

23
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,596
- This clip features a dog
who may have gotten their head

24
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,898
stuck in the trashcan.

25
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:09,903
Module, did
you go in the garbage?

26
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:17,644
Let me see, the laundry basket.

27
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:21,915
The garbage, you are so naughty.

28
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:24,984
- Oh, just look at this dog,
he knows he's been caught.

29
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,020
Was it delicious?

30
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,725
- For our next clip,
singer, actor, comedian,

31
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,728
radio host, extraordinaire
Mikalah Gordon.

32
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,996
- Hey Liz.

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,298
- This clip has a monkey

34
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:40,767
who has decided to
take a selfie or two

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,069
for this lucky tourist.

36
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,337
- So excited.

37
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,115
Oh my God, did he
just knock the camera

38
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:56,883
out of the person's hand?

39
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:08,695
Oh yeah baby, yes, he
knows he looks good.

40
00:02:08,728 --> 00:02:10,597
- Oh, he still has that
camera to this day.

41
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,466
His social media
content is fire.

42
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,201
- We are now joined
by the hilarious

43
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:16,870
comedian, Brian Cooper.

44
00:02:16,903 --> 00:02:18,371
- Hey Liz, I'm happy to be here.

45
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:20,940
Ready for some funny
clips, let's do this.

46
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,576
- We have a chipmunk who may
or may not have found his way

47
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,112
to an all you can eat
buffet at the bird feeder.

48
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,119
What are
you doing mister?

49
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,130
- Who me?

50
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,834
I don't have
anything in my cheek.

51
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,470
That's kind of gross.

52
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,106
- And for our final panelist,

53
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:56,342
we have musician, singer
songwriter, Brandon Rogers.

54
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,977
- Hey Liz, so nice to see you.

55
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,112
Let's do this.

56
00:02:59,145 --> 00:03:00,580
- Hey, Brandon, what
do you think of dogs

57
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:02,549
chewing holes in walls?

58
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,017
Come here.

59
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,753
Come here.

60
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,921
Did you do this?

61
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,857
I think you did.

62
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,058
I think you did it,

63
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,093
I think you're giving
the clues away.

64
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,064
I think we know the culprit.

65
00:03:18,097 --> 00:03:18,898
Here, come here.

66
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,071
This is all about you, isn't it?

67
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:28,975
You don't
have to shame me.

68
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,643
The wall just jumped
in front of me.

69
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,911
It's the wall's fault.

70
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,581
So now I ask you

71
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:39,085
who took the cookie
off the counter?

72
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,423
- I think it's crazy

73
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:44,490
how people keep talking
to these animals

74
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:45,658
like they speak English.

75
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,126
I ask you again guys

76
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,465
who stole the cookie
off the counter?

77
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:58,271
These two
raccoons are up to no good.

78
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:08,881
Busted.

79
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,357
Oh, just a normal
day at the weight room.

80
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:20,927
Everybody getting some workout
in and boom in jumps up a,

81
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,861
what was that, a kangaroo?

82
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,962
I don't even know what that was.

83
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,267
- Wait, let's see
that in slow-mo.

84
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:34,741
Yup, it's a deer all right.

85
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,143
You know, some pets
hate being left alone

86
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,112
and need more
attention than others.

87
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,614
They bark or whine
or paw at your leg,

88
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:44,751
but every now and then
animals break out the big guns

89
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,287
when they really want
to get our attention.

90
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,757
In this segment, we take a
look at eye grabbing animals,

91
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,991
hidden talents.

92
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:00,967
- Oh no!

93
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,436
- We need to see
that in slow mo.

94
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,291
- This escalator sucks.

95
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:41,341
- Wee!

96
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,555
Okay, get it girl.

97
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,590
Yeah.

98
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,460
- Aw yeah, that's my jam.

99
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:04,997
He's not gonna make
it, he's not gonna make it,

100
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,765
he's not gonna make it.

101
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,733
Does he clear that?

102
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,901
Let's go!

103
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,703
- I have to see that again.

104
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,445
- You know, I can't even
walk through a doorway

105
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,047
that gracefully.

106
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,549
- I love this part of the show
where we visit celebrities

107
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,351
and meet their furry friends.

108
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,254
You'll recognize our next
guest from her roles in films,

109
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:31,958
ET and Cujo, Dee Wallace,
welcome to our show.

110
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,128
- I'm really excited to be
here because I love animals

111
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,965
and I really love funny,
silly, stupid animals.

112
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:40,867
- What furry friends do
you have with you today?

113
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,869
- This is my Freedom.

114
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,906
She's a rescue, all my
dogs have been rescues.

115
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,907
Yes.

116
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,242
Yes.

117
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:51,944
- Dee, I know you have some
experience working with animals.

118
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,614
Tell us about your time on
the set of the new Lassie.

119
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,948
- Actually, we
did the new Lassie

120
00:06:55,982 --> 00:07:01,120
because the producers happened
to find an actual ancestor

121
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,222
of the original Lassie.

122
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,824
This dog had not been trained.

123
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,493
We got on the set to
do the first shoot

124
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:12,064
and it was this complicated
story of these smelly old socks.

125
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,100
We bring Lassie and
the attorney goes,

126
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,403
"Oh no, you can't throw
socks to him or anything

127
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,872
because he's too scared."

128
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:24,010
So working with animals, you
have to have a lot of patience.

129
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,945
- Wow Dee, I can only imagine.

130
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:30,550
Coming up, we're joined by some
aspiring musicians for pets

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:33,920
sing along next on
World's Funniest Animals.

132
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,989
- We'll be right back with
World's Funniest Animals.

133
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,635
- These days, karaoke has
become a pretty popular activity

134
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,604
for people to do
with their friends.

135
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,974
But it's not just humans who
are getting in on the act,

136
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:58,511
animals like to strut
their stuff to, sing along.

137
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,150
♪ I've got a lovely
bunch of coconuts ♪

138
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,651
Okay, I'm done.

139
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,820
Okay, I'm back.

140
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,324
♪ Dilly D, they they
are standing in ♪

141
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,368
- At first I thought
he was whistling,

142
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,303
now it looks like he's DJ-ing.

143
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,852
- I don't care what this
dog plays, it's so cute

144
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,355
he can literally do
whatever he wants.

145
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,862
A little bit off key though.

146
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,836
Translation, please
stop playing the harmonica.

147
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,580
They're both
such great performers.

148
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:10,616
Just walking by, I would assume
they are a professional duo.

149
00:09:12,785 --> 00:09:14,020
Let's take a look
at some animals

150
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,888
who belong in the doghouse

151
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:19,659
in our next segment,
caught red handed.

152
00:09:23,863 --> 00:09:26,065
Hey, didn't
I just say no more?

153
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,038
- Meredith, if you are
hiding my bananas in this bag

154
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,039
so help me.

155
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,080
All right, are
you allowed in that bag?

156
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,116
- I swear my monkey
ate my homework.

157
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,553
- Babe!

158
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,627
- Your eyeliner
still looks great.

159
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,103
You've
done it this time.

160
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,474
- What's the big deal?

161
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:09,942
You have a Rumba.

162
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,749
Hey babe, I got
the new memory foam.

163
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,818
You want two pillows or one?

164
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:21,988
- I can't believe this
guy is letting me do this.

165
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,068
What did you do?

166
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:37,303
What did you do?

167
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,213
Come here.

168
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,318
- Who uses that
much toilet paper?

169
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,519
Especially these days.

170
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,324
Coming up
there are purring, crying,

171
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,227
and inquiring
animals, curious cats

172
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,663
next on World's
Funniest Animals.

173
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,907
Now, I'm not really
a fan of the saying

174
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,642
curiosity killed the cat.

175
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,745
So in this segment, we checked
out what really happens

176
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,648
when curiosity gets the
best of our animal friends.

177
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,651
Spoiler alert, it's
usually hilarious.

178
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,020
Check out some of these
clips of curious pets.

179
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:45,438
- Doesn't that cat
know how to knock?

180
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,047
That is me, yeah
I'm fine, let me kiss myself.

181
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,429
Do not play
this cat for money.

182
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,036
Oh no, what happened?

183
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,771
- That looks like my
hair without a blowout.

184
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:25,077
- Yeah, I'm the same
way in the morning,

185
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,580
that dog has not
had his coffee yet.

186
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,785
- These next animals
aren't just all bark.

187
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,054
They really have the
skills to back it up.

188
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,023
Let's jump into our next
segment, pets have talent.

189
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:44,096
Welcome everybody
to the handball finals

190
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,532
where Tabby the cat
still has the lead.

191
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,642
- Who put this
dog in that truck?

192
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,884
My dog never
does chores, I'm jealous.

193
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,130
Oh yeah, I like the moves.

194
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:32,945
- This dog is friends
with everybody.

195
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,926
- This dog has the whole
neighborhood trained.

196
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:02,908
You should see when
they play against the lions.

197
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:03,909
- What about you Dee,

198
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,444
does your dog have
any tricks to show us?

199
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,546
- Her best trick I think,

200
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,218
is we go out and
play balls every day

201
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,187
and I flip the ball and I
don't know how she does it,

202
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,024
but she tracks it and
she catches it in midair.

203
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,392
Good catch!

204
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,927
Good girl.

205
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:24,296
- Thanks for coming and bringing
your pet to see us today.

206
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,399
Coming up, it's time
to join the band.

207
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,635
Grab a snack and your
pet's favorite treat,

208
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,738
and I'll grab some more
hilarious animal clips for you

209
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,140
when we return to
World's Funniest Animals.

210
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,654
Sometimes I like to just
play my favorite songs

211
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:49,922
and sing along.

212
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,091
I just wish my
pets would join in.

213
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:55,761
In this next segment, these
animals are doing exactly that.

214
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:56,595
Join the band.

215
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,010
- That's literally
me annoying anybody

216
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,445
while they're doing
anything at all.

217
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,787
♪ If you're hungry and
you know it say meow ♪

218
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,290
♪ If you're hungry
and you know it ♪

219
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,025
♪ And you really wanna show it ♪

220
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:31,063
♪ If you're hungry and
you know it say meow ♪

221
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,065
Are you hungry?

222
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,601
- Lady, I'm hungry.

223
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,303
How many times do
I have to say it?

224
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,805
- And now the
Portuguese version.

225
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,988
- This is taking
singing for your dinner

226
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:57,656
to a whole new level.

227
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,069
- What, this is how we pay rent.

228
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,951
He ain't nothing
but a hound dog, howling.

229
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:30,255
Do you want to sing?

230
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,095
So is anyone not
impressed how big that dog is?

231
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,830
That's easily a queen size bed.

232
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,909
Why is
this so impressive?

233
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,411
You can obviously
see he's cheating.

234
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,079
You can see the keys light up.

235
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,054
- Do you have a pet who
sticks their nose in the room

236
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,756
every time you
open a bag of chips

237
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:07,559
or chases after a sound when
it hears an unfamiliar noise?

238
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,695
These next clips feature animals

239
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,664
who are just as
inquisitive as your pets,

240
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,167
and maybe even a little
more in our segment,

241
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,869
investigative animals.

242
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:26,912
Huh?

243
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,914
Where did, where did he go?

244
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,956
Oh, you
wanted that there?

245
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,491
Well, I wanted it on the floor.

246
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,931
Hey neighbor.

247
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:46,999
Hi.

248
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,302
What you doing?

249
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
Hey.

250
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:51,904
Hi.

251
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:52,971
You want to hang out?

252
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,743
- Yeah, yeah, don't mind them.

253
00:17:57,776 --> 00:17:59,611
- Just a couple
of nosy neighbors.

254
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:11,957
You're not from
around these parts are ya?

255
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,962
I mean, that's no way
to greet a stranger.

256
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:21,934
Hey.

257
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:25,104
Bear get out of there!

258
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,949
He's taking the
Legos, he's taking the Legos!

259
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:37,950
- Forget the food.

260
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,385
Do you know how
expensive Legos are?

261
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,187
- Well, that's almost it for us,

262
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,890
but just in case
you missed anything,

263
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:47,392
here's a quick recap of all
of the funniest moments,

264
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,896
a dancing cat with sombrero,
a piano playing pug,

265
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,698
a cat who has found
his new favorite toy,

266
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,533
a chipmunk who has
hit the jackpot,

267
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:55,801
a monkey with a new backpack

268
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,402
to show off to all
of his friends,

269
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,105
a deer who was trying to
get some reps in at the gym

270
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,174
and a couple of dogs on
the neighborhood watch

271
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:03,408
jumping at the bet.

272
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,184
Thanks so much to our panel

273
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,186

281
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,305
right here on World's
Funniest Animals.

282
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,376
You got
food in the car?

283
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,577
He's taking the Legos!

284
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,379
- Babe!

285
00:19:42,147 --> 00:19:44,683
Was it delicious?

286
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:52,391
What did you do?
