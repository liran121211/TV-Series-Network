1
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,740
Prepare
to be amazed.

2
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,576
Or at least amused.

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,679
Because today on the show,
we found a sandwich stealing

4
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:16,316
seagull, a deer who
dines and dashes,

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,818
and a cat who thinks,
he's computer savvy.

6
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:21,755
Give it back to me.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:24,024
- All, right here,
on this episode,

8
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,592
of World's Funniest Animals.

9
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,998
- I'm your host Elizabeth
Stanton, and I'm here with,

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,701
my two best friends,
Ruby and Hank,

11
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,771
and welcome to World's
Funniest Animals.

12
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:40,306
I'm joined today, with a
few friends, and panelists,

13
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,643
as well as our celebrity
guest, Jennifer Taylor.

14
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:44,911
- Hey Liz.

15
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:46,379
- Thanks for being
here, Jennifer.

16
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:49,149
Did you know the phrase,
"flipping out", began because,

17
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,818
when people, would get
really excited or upset,

18
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,187
their wigs would flip right off?

19
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,289
Well, the animals in
this segment

20
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:57,991
aren't wearing hairpieces,

21
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:01,594
but if they were, they'd be
flying all over the place,

22
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:02,996
flipping out.

23
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,765
Brought to you with commentary,
from our first panelist,

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,867
actor, Carmen Hodgson.

25
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,470
- I can't wait to see
what we've got today.

26
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:13,173
- This next clip features,
a very hyperactive animal.

27
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,874
- That's my favorite.

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,616
This cat, has great cardio.

29
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:30,190
- Our next panelist, is the
amazing comedian, Brian Cooper.

30
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,558
- Let's see it.

31
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,437
- When I get real excited,
for food, I dance too.

32
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,476
- Now we are joined by,

33
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,278
actor, writer,
producer, Noah Matthews.

34
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,546
- Happy to be here, Liz,

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,855
You know, when you
think you're alone,

36
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,224
and you're not, that's as bad.

37
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,091
He's going at it.

38
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,729
- For our final panelist,

39
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,699
we have singer, after-comedian
radio host, Mikalah Gordon.

40
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,967
- Liz!

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,402
- Are you ready, for
a wild animal clip?

42
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,770
- So excited!

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,823
- This deer, really
did not enjoy its meal.

44
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,526
- We all need a
little RNR sometimes,

45
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,562
but these animals, can't seem
to get enough of playing,

46
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,097
no matter what!

47
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,466
check out, what I'm talking
about, in our next segment.

48
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,467
Play With Me.

49
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,447
- This poor puppy, this
cat is obviously skilled,

50
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,550
in grappling. It's not fair.

51
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,832
- I don't know why
this kid is so excited,

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,034
his shot just got blocked.

53
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:23,469
- We need to see
that in slow-mo.

54
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,214
- They seemed so proud,
once they finally find her.

55
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,427
- How many times, does this
happen with your sibling?

56
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,929
They never want to play.

57
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,147
- Over here, now
here, and then there,

58
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,250
You missed a spot.

59
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,126
- I'm always
excited, to introduce

60
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,727
this next segment of our show,

61
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:56,963
where we go into a home,
of a celebrity guest,

62
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,032
and their pet, for a chat.

63
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:01,501
Today on World's Funniest
Animals, you may know,

64
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:04,270
our celebrity guest, from
shows like, Two and a Half Men,

65
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,539
Shameless, and The
Young and the Restless.

66
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,874
It's Jennifer Taylor.

67
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,909
Thanks for being here
with us today, Jennifer.

68
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,644
I see, you have your
dog, here with you.

69
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,946
At least, I think I do.

70
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,884
- Okay. So, this
is Buddy. Buddy!

71
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,853
Come on up. He's
a little shy, too,

72
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:24,891
come on, come up, and say
hi to Liz.Say hi, Liz?

73
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:26,559
Buddy?

74
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,897
Oh, he's being shy, shy boy.

75
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:32,932
- It's okay, Buddy.

76
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:34,934
It's mom's, job to be
in front of the camera,

77
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:36,669
you keep doing,
what you're best at.

78
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,038
- Buddy, does do some tricks.

79
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,408
He has the trick of trying to
disappear.

80
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,344
Were are you going? No,

81
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:51,017
Buddy, Come here, come
on, give me some sugar.

82
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,685
Who's my good boy!

83
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:58,558
- Coming up, we have
some very stubborn pets,

84
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,960
in our segment,
I Don't Think So.

85
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,296
Next on World's
Funniest Animals.

86
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:15,341
When we think of animals,
usually we think about them,

87
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,377
living in packs or herds.

88
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,279
But sometimes, they just
want to be left alone.

89
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:24,183
A feeling, we can all relate
to. Well, I can anyways,

90
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,786
check out our segment,
I don't think So.

91
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,195
- What a nice day,
to be at the beach,

92
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:41,234
with a nice view, what a nice
sandwich, and, there it goes!

93
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,916
- I told you, this is my space,

94
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,987
and you need to find another
place for your stuff.

95
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,007
- Alright guys, single
file line, Come on.

96
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,175
Let's go. Single file.

97
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,177
Jamal. Get back in line.

98
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,945
Move it, or lose it, ladies.

99
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,281
You got a lagger back
here. Let's go. Come on.

100
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,251
If you don't get your tail in
line, what's wrong with you?

101
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,887
Holding everybody up.
Let's go, come on,

102
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,232
Stop pushing the mail out.

103
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,379
- And this mailman is having
a blast, with his job,

104
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,619
- There are certain
phrases, like walk or treat,

105
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,355
that can cause our
pet, to totally freak.

106
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,492
These clips, show those exact
moments, where animals are,

107
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:13,493
losing it.

108
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,728
- Don't be sheepish.
Come on down the road,

109
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,595
you can trust me.

110
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,946
- This is so cute,
but I think it's fake.

111
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:15,321
- My question is what
happened to the first dog?

112
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:18,357
- Somebody needs to help me,

113
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,459
there was this bird
on my driveway.

114
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,501
There was a bird in my driveway,
so I thought it was dying,

115
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:32,305
so I picked it up,

116
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,079
- Why would you bring a
bird, into your bathroom?

117
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,648
This doesn't feel
totally thought out.

118
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:48,220
- I was going to the
bathroom, then it flew

119
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,889
and I can't get a hold of it.

120
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:15,247
- Thanks for being
with us Jennifer,

121
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,749
we know, you have a
ton of experience,

122
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:19,352
working with animals on
set. What's that like?

123
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:22,855
- Yes, Liz, I have worked
with animals on sets.

124
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,893
I've worked with, dogs and cats
and horses, and even a pig.

125
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:33,466
I worked on this one movie,
where we had this little,

126
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:36,535
baby pig.And he was so cute.

127
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:40,006
Now, pigs, they actually
mature rather quickly.

128
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,541
So during the time
of this movie,

129
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,011
the pig started going
through adolescence.

130
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,579
And when they go
through

131
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:51,083
adolescence, they
get this smell,

132
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:55,988
so, that cute little piggy,
left the smell, everywhere.

133
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,959
- So, I'm not so surprised
by that pig story.

134
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:03,462
- My character on Two and a
Half Men, actually had a cat.

135
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,563
You know very well,

136
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:06,298
that's Sir Lancelot's
litter box.

137
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,134
I'm highly allergic to cats.

138
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:11,103
Of course I didn't tell them
that, cause I didn't think,

139
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,139
it was pertinent information.

140
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,976
My allergies just went
like, off the charts.

141
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,979
I ended up having to
borrow, somebody's inhaler.

142
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:22,448
- Thanks for sharing
with us, Jennifer.

143
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:23,749
So, glad you were
able to join us.

144
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:26,385
- All my pleasure, thanks Liz.

145
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:30,690
- Coming up, these days,
everyone is fairly tech savvy.

146
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:32,792
Even our pets, Pet Tech,

147
00:11:32,825 --> 00:11:35,261
Next on World's
Funniest Animals.

148
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,441
Look, we love our pets,
and we love our tech.

149
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,475
But most of the time,

150
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:51,744
these two things don't mix well.

151
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:54,880
At all. You'll see, what I
mean, in this next segment,

152
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:55,715
Pet Tech.

153
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:05,624
- Even birds, Know we need
to reduce our screen time.

154
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,579
- I don't even have a tablet,

155
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,047
and they're giving
one to their dog,

156
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,715
Must be nice.

157
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,168
- Okay, hold still,
I just wanna to talk.

158
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,376
- Let it go. Drop it, drop it.

159
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:00,946
Good boy, I'm going to
put it back. Don't do it.

160
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,220
Hey, give it back to me.

161
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,088
It's mine.

162
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,459
- Sometimes, you just
want to be left alone.

163
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:16,195
Everyone needs to recharge,
every once in a while,

164
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,330
and our pets, are no exception.

165
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,333
Take a look at these grumpy,
animals in our segment,

166
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,368
Don't Mess With Me.

167
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,148
- I would smack her too if
she kept blowing in my face,

168
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,260
Oh my gosh!

169
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,705
- What's up behind that fence?
Just wait till I jump over.

170
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,545
- Thirsty?

171
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:17,823
- No good deed, goes unpunished.

172
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,610
- Okay, these two are
the worst singers,

173
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,578
in the entire animal kingdom

174
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,887
- Coming up, It's
not just us humans,

175
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,689
that are attention
hogs, pet can be too.

00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,826
Play With Me, next on
World's Funniest Animals.

177
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,372
- If you have a pet,
you know how sometimes,

178
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,041
they just can't stop
begging for attention.

179
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,810
These next clips, feature
animals asking for attention,

180
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,147
in some unconventional
ways. Hogging The Limelight.

181
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,728
- I need him for
a workout partner,

182
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:42,141
- Honestly, dogs can
motivate you to do anything.

183
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:43,776
Trust me. I wouldn't
even leave my house,

184
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,678
If it wasn't for my dogs.

185
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:48,280
Apparently, they have
to walk, outside,

186
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:53,953
This dog keeps throwing,

187
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:57,589
its toy over the
fence, look at this,

188
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:03,696
I'll pick it up, and throw
it over, get to leave. Right?

189
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,701
In your home,
no. Drops it again.

190
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,837
- This dog knows how
to get what it wants.

191
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,205
I
Can't just leave, the toy.

192
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,541
He's got me trapped I'm
gonna be here forever.

193
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,050
Stop it.

194
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:38,063
- Look at that little sea
otter, I love sea otters.Hi?

195
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:43,102
I never, ever,

196
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,372
- Is it illegal to
have them as a pet?

197
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,272
Can I have one?

198
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,988
- I just think he needs to
hold hands, and calm down.

199
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,529
- Okay, this dog's
whole demeanor changes,

200
00:17:10,562 --> 00:17:13,499
so, much after he gets
attention. I'm the same way.

201
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:35,187
- He not only hit the camera,
but he missed the treat.

202
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:43,996
- These days, everyone is fairly
tech savvy. Even our pets.

Wild Electronics.

204
00:17:47,099 --> 00:18:01,780
- What, what do you
want? I am working.

205
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,884
- Okay, if this was my dog, I
could never get any work done.

206
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,014
- Something fishy
is going on here.

207
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,798
- I'm tired of you working
like, a dog all day,

208
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,770
- Well, that's
almost, it for us,

209
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,672

A dog who has outsmarted
the neighborhood,

214
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:11,517
a FIFA inspired feline,
hyperactive horses,

215
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,186
and a puppy who shrinks
right before our eyes.

216
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,428
Well that's all the
time, we have for you,

217
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:25,464

- Oh, Liz, It was my pleasure.

224
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,280
Now, I think it's time
to take a nap with Buddy.

225
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:43,148
- I'm your host
Elizabeth Stanton.

226
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,552
I should probably, go hide
all my chargers from my dogs.

227
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:48,053
I mean, they're
usually pretty good,

228
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,857
but some of those videos
made me pretty nervous.

229
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,194
Well, see you next time, on
