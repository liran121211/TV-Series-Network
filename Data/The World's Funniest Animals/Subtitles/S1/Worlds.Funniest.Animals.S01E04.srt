1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,470
Are you
ready to leap in action?

2
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:04,804
Because today on the show

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:07,173
we have a goose with
an attitude problem,

4
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:10,643
a map-stealing monkey,
and a reluctant retriever.

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,146
This and more on today's episode

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,881
of "Worlds Funniest Animals."

7
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,653
Welcome back to "World's
Funniest Animals,"

8
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,622
I'm your host Elizabeth Stanton,

9
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,558
and these are my trustee
sidekicks Hank and Ruby.

10
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:28,261
Joined today with a few of
my friends and panelists,

11
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:31,331
as well as our celebrity
guest, Murray SawChuck.

12
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:33,967
- Hey Liz, thank you so much
for having me on your show.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,570
I'm just absolutely excited
to be on this type of show

14
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,938
'cause I love animals.

15
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,173
- Thanks, Murray.

16
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:43,009
If you're anything
like me and Ruby here,

17
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,713
and love a good funny animal
video, you're in luck.

18
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:50,283
We've hunted the web for the
wildest animal clips out there,

19
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,652
and I can't wait to show
you what we've found.

20
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:54,454
Ever have one of those lazy days

21
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,190
where you don't feel like
doing anything at all,

22
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,859
even when you actually
have a ton to do?

23
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,196
Turns out animals can be just
as stubborn as us humans.

24
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,031
Check out how
stubborn they can be

25
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,267
in the segment,
"You Can't Make Me,"

26
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,003
brought to you with commentary
from our first panelist,

27
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:12,639
the amazing comedian,
Brian Cooper.

28
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:13,573
- Hey, Liz.

29
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:14,641
- Are you ready for this clip?

30
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:16,176
- Show me what ya got.

31
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,749
Sometimes you lose
motivation mid-sprint

32
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,856
- Now we joined by
by singer, actor,

33
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,959
comedian, radio
host Mikalah Gordon.

34
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,794
- Hi, happy to be here, Liz.

35
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,198
- This next clip features an
animal who is not very patient.

36
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,100
- So excited.

37
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:49,109
Oh no!

38
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,911
After long day of
dealing with tourists,

39
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,548
sometimes you gotta just
give one a good toss.

40
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,385
- Our next panelist is rising
star, actor, Carmen Hodgson.

41
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,321
- Hey, Liz, I'm so
happy to be here.

42
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:04,257
- This next clip
features some lazy dogs.

43
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:07,060
- Ooh, okay, this I have to see.

44
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,330
Come on.

45
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,339
Let's go, come on,
come on, let's go.

46
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,608
- I said I don't wanna go.

47
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,776
- For our final panelist,

48
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,980
we have actor, writer,
producer, Noah Matthews.

49
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,481
- Hey, Liz.

50
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,016
- We have an animal who
does not wanna be bothered

51
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:30,984
in this clip.

52
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,085
- Let's get into it.

53
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:38,458
Noga, you're so lazy.

54
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,366
Look, I'm glad you're
on this fitness journey,

55
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:50,436
but I've taken five walks
today, and I'm over it.

56
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:58,778
I only agreed on
you going on a walk,

57
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:00,480
I didn't say I would.

58
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,749
- Even animals get
annoyed sometimes.

59
00:03:02,782 --> 00:03:04,417
whether it's personal space

60
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,019
or they are trying to rest,

61
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,453
if the don't want attention

62
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:09,822
they will be sure
to let you know.

63
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,926
Get ready for our next
segment, "I Don't Think So."

64
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,130
Is
she squishing you?

65
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,667
Tilly, you're
squashing the baby.

66
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,403
Tilly!

67
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,373
- She looks terrified,
but he looks so cozy.

68
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,109
Matilda!

69
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,611
He's as
happy as he looks.

70
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,046
It's me and my wife, guys.

71
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,384
We
got witnesses, boy.

72
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,424
- I understand why
chickens are so aggressive.

73
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,159
Everyone's trying to eat 'em.

74
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,268
Okay, now remember,
when getting attacked

75
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,538
by a vicious goose, just
call for some school children

76
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,940
to come and save you.
- Oh, okay.

77
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,078
- Unfortunately though,
they won't be able to save

78
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,145
your dignity but.

79
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:25,131
- This is what it feels
like sharing a plate

80
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:26,733
of nachos with someone.

81
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,868
Stop stealing all the good chips

82
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,375
- Here's a thought.

83
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:37,610
When you have a giant thieving
bird in the neighborhood,

84
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,646
maybe not such a great idea

85
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,148
to leave the kitchen
door wide open.

86
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,684
- Hey Murray, who
do we have here?

87
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,052
- I have long hair chihuahuas.

88
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,020
They are all rescues.

89
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,822
This is Smudge, yes, it is.

90
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:52,659
And this is Kahlua,
and this is Bailey.

91
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:55,461
- Do you ever use these
little guys in your magic act?

92
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,263
- I am always asked if I use
them in my magic show

93
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,931
here in Las Vegas and I don't.

94
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,067
I have brought them on
stage 'cause every year

95
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,636
I do a charity show
that raises money

96
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,473
for rescue dogs and animals,
and it's our 8th year this year

97
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:09,509
and I call it
"Begging for Magic."

98
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:10,576
And we have all sorts

99
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,211
of entertainments
here in Las Vegas,

100
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,914
and we were about on stage
just to show everybody the pups

101
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:16,215
and they got to meet them
and get pictures with them,

102
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,650
but that's all we do with them.

103
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,952
We don't usually use
them in any magic tricks.

104
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,422
- Wow, magic for
an amazing cause.

105
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,490
So do your dogs know any tricks?

106
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,558
- Yes, they do some tricks.

107
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,160
They're not ridiculous tricks.

108
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,262
Actually, Smudge does
have ridiculous tricks.

109
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:33,466
Smudge is actually the only
chihuahua bowling ball.

110
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,836
She runs up to me, falls on
her back and you push her away,

111
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,072
she slides on her back,
gets up and runs right back

112
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,239
and she absolutely loves it,

113
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:41,607
so we'll demonstrate
that for you.

114
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,608
Smudge, come here!

115
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,077
We can do it, come here!

116
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,144
That's my little girl, ready?

117
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,479
And away she goes!

118
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,347
Come on!

119
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,050
Oh wait, one, two,
three, and away she goes.

120
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:53,419
Come here, baby,
and one more time.

121
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,854
Away you go!

122
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,089
Come here.

123
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:59,826
That's my girl, that's
my girl!

124
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,760
That's our Smudge.

125
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,262
Bailey and Kaluha they're
great at rolling over,

126
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,765
shaking a paw, sitting up.

127
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,166
Sit, sit!

128
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,936
Good girl! That's funny.

129
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,537
Roll over, let's roll.

130
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,473
Good girl!

131
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:14,707
Such a good girl.

132
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,309
Also they actually
do a training course

133
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,577
which I take them every week.

134
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,412
They go up and down
different partitions

135
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,980
and through tubes
and all that stuff.

136
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,316
They've been all doing it
for a couple of years now.

137
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,432
- Wow, that is quite
the agility course

138
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,434
I'll have to bring
Hank and Ruby someday,

139
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,569
and we can have one
big pet play date.

140
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:46,706
Coming up, we have a
gregarious giraffe,

141
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:50,176
a gruff goat, a monkey
stealing a bus driver's lunch,

142
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,044
and a dog dancing
their heart out

143
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,813
in the middle of the pet store.

144
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:56,916
All this and more next on
"World's Funniest Animals."

145
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:09,495
Did you know that butterflies
can taste with their feet?

146
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,597
Pretty cool, but
not exactly a talent

147
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,400
I think I'd want myself, yuck.

148
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,803
But there are few that
I wouldn't mind having

149
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,272
in the segment "Hidden Talents."

150
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,646
- A dog that does laundry?

151
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,259
I've never been more jealous,

152
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,663
Oh, now he's taking
them out of the dryer.

153
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:46,599
He does laundry better
than me, and I have thumbs.

154
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,808
- Okay, here is
the real question.

155
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:59,679
Shouldn't the dog's sneakers
be on the front paws?

156
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,320
This is the same
way Rocky trained

157
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,288
when he beat Clubber Lang.

158
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,798
- We get it, you're cool,
and your dog's cool too.

159
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,533
Meanwhile, I can't
even can't let my dog

160
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:22,502
off leash at the beach.

161
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:34,714
- One, two!

162
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,584
- Come on down, chest
down, elbows out.

163
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,787
- One, two, one, two, one!

164
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,059
- The real question
here, who's training who?

165
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:47,927
- One, two!

166
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,441
Wow, this
cat is seriously shredded.

167
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,377
He's Olympic material for sure.

168
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,581
Watch out, Shaun White.

169
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,587
No one likes being
ignored, even animals.

170
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,689
In fact, some will
go out of their way

171
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:20,726
to get your attention and end
up hilarious when they do.

172
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,895
Check out these
attention-hungry animals

173
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,097
in the segment, "Look at Me."

174
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,042
Why are seals so cute?

175
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,043
I think I want one.

176
00:09:46,852 --> 00:09:48,921
Boom, that thing is long.

177
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,459
Hello, I
look good, look at me.

178
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,428
Ooh, yeah gimme a kiss.

179
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,630
Yeah, you haven't had
enough love.

180
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,843
- Wait, did that bat just wave?

181
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,629
- You're gonna get
up and feed me,

182
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:31,597
even if I have to
take it all off.

183
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,438
Welcome back to the
little pug's camera view.

184
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,907
So far this camera
strap is holding up.

185
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,186
Why are
small dogs so brave?

186
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,726
Coming
up, we see some animals

187
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,597
who've decided they cannot
be bothered, not today.

188
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,133
Next on "World's
Funniest Animals."

189
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:19,445
The animal kingdom can
be an unforgiving place

190
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:22,348
and sometimes it's
survival of the fittest

191
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:25,351
or at least the bossiest
to survive and prove

192
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,087
that you are the
alpha, "Not Today."

193
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:31,891
You call that a bark?

194
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:34,860
This is a bark.

195
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,862
Never mind.

196
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,465
She doesn't
see that one coming.

197
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:48,207
Boo!

198
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,442
- It's a sneak attack!

199
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,479
- Don't drop it on the floor.

200
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:55,047
What's wrong with you?

201
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:00,653
Say bye to everyone.
- Bye!

202
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:02,488
Say goodbye to everyone.

203
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:05,491
- He just stole his lunch.

204
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:06,959
- I have to see that again.

205
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:30,583
- So that's how dogs learn
how to swim, it's by ducks.

206
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,218
It's your turn to chase me.

207
00:12:33,385 --> 00:12:35,154
Guess you guys are
gonna leave now?

208
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,623
Okay, the dog
is doing the dog paddle

209
00:12:37,656 --> 00:12:41,093
and the ducks are doing fly
the heck out of this place.

210
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,663
Oh, you think you
are so cool with the toy.

211
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,132
I'll show you.

212
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,199
Here I come!

213
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,940
- You'll be left in awe by
some of these furry feats.

214
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,810
Coming back to part two
of the fan favorite,

215
00:12:57,843 --> 00:12:59,111
"Pets Have Talents."

216
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,395
- Five, six, seven eight.

217
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,700
So am just picturing
them in their living room

218
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,536
going over these steps.

219
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,138
It's not weird at all.

220
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,958
Seriously, do
I have to do everything

221
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,226
myself around here?

222
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,029
He's just a delivery guy
bringing in some lunch

223
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,631
to some lazy cows
on Moober Eats.

224
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,041
I'm doing
an obstacle course

225
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:06,579
and the only obstacles are
all the other darn cats.

226
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:07,446
Move!

227
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:16,388
- Oh my God, it's like
ninja warrior cats style.

228
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:31,537
Well,
now I've seen it all.

229
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,341
and he's actually riding the
bike around the neighborhood.

230
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,442
- Mischief, can you say hello?

231
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,078
- Hello.
- Good bird.

232
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,314
He does all sorts of voices.

233
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,316
Can you say hi?
- Hi.

234
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,518
Good job.

235
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,823
And sometimes he hears people
who have a cold.

236
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,827
Good job, Mischief.

237
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,161
Can you say hello?

238
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,832
No, hello.

239
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,568
He's all excited.

240
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:04,837
- I mean, he's
technically saying hello.

241
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,172
- Hello.

242
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,609
Hi, hi.

243
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,744
- Hello.
- Hi.

244
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,282
- This isn't working
out too well.

245
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,919
- Quoth the raven, just
give me the treat, lady.

246
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,321
Coming up,
some animals just want

247
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,924
all the attention,
"Hogging the Limelight,"

248
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,426
next on "World's
Funniest Animals."

249
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,505
What would the internet
be if it wasn't for people

250
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,840
constantly seeking attention?

251
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,678
Well, it's not just people
and lucky for us sometimes

252
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,212
it's even caught on camera.

253
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,415
"Hogging the Limelight."

254
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,582
- Smile for the camera.

255
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,753
Guess what, I'm not taking a
picture, I'm taking a video.

256
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,155
Yeah, got you, ha.

257
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,491
Still smiling though.

258
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,160
Good job.

259
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,095
- Don't you hate it when
someone takes a picture

260
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,463
of you when you're eating?

261
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,571
- No, insurance lady,
I said goat prints.

262
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,841
What you mean, I'm not covered?

263
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,559
It's not showing
off when you have talent.

264
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,366
Absolutely amazing.

265
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,141
- Oh, whoa, cool
guy with my shades.

266
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,446
Okay, they
reversed this video, right?

267
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,714
This cannot be real.

268
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:02,187
Good girl, good girl.

269
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,655
Seriously, mom?

270
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,425
You're a good girl.

271
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,227
This
is a joke, right?

272
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,597
Gimme that.
- Hey! Sadie!

273
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,536
- Some days you just can't
be bothered to do anything.

274
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,438
These pets are having
one of those days

275
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:21,373
in our segment "I Don't Wanna."

276
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,679
This dog is taking a nap
and falling ever so slowly.

277
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,085
Great, now the cat's awake too.

278
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,829
- Went down, collapse
on the ground.

279
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,764
Works for me when I
don't wanna do something.

280
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:56,508
Now it's
time to come home.

281
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,414
- This cat has dug her
claws into this decision,

282
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,516
and she ain't moving.

283
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,888
Hey try picking up
the rock instead.

284
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:25,737
- He flipped him over like he
was a barbecue piece of meat.

285
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,413
These millennial
dogs are so spoiled,

286
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,082
wants everything done for them.

287
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,284
- Well, that's almost it for us

288
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,688
but just in case you missed
anything, here is quick recap

289
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,389
of all the funniest moments.

290
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:47,493
A not so scary goose,
a poking primate,

291
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:50,195
a canine workout
partner, sneaky lion cub

292
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,663
and a snowboarding cat.

293
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:55,000
I totally think it might
just make the pros.

294
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,308
Thanks so much for tuning
in and checking out

295
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,244
some of the world's
funniest animals.

296
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,212
And a special
thanks to our panel

297
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,548
and our celebrity
guest Murray SawChuck

298
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,384
for checking in and chatting
with us about your pets.

299
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,353
- Hey, Liz, thanks so much
for having me on your show.

300
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,322
Smudge, Bailey, and Kaluha
had such a great time.

301
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,790
Thank you.

302
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,527
- Until next time, I'm
your host Elizabeth Stanton.

303
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,862
I'll be back soon with
more hilarious clips

304
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,964
of your favorite
creatures right here

305
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,066
on "World's Funniest Animals."

306
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,010
You're
squishing the baby.

307
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,690
- Say bye to everyone.

308
00:19:51,723 --> 00:19:52,624
Bye!

309
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,393
- Say bye to everyone.
