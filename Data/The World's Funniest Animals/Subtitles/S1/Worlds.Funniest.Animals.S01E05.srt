1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:03,703
I hope
you're ready to laugh.

2
00:00:05,405 --> 00:00:06,840
Because on this episode,

3
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,442
we're bringing you a head
banging doggo,

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,713
an excitable elephant,

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:16,916
cross walking
cows,

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,086
and a raccoon who's
way too relaxed.

7
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,192
This and more on today's episode

8
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,661
of world's funniest animals.

9
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,600
- Hey and welcome to
world's funniest animals,

10
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:36,636
where we've curated some of
the most hilarious animal clips

11
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,004
just for you.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,706
I'm your host Elizabeth Stanton.

13
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:42,509
And these are my trusty
sidekicks, Hank and Ruby.

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,278
Joined today with a few of
my friends and panelists,

15
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,314
as well as our celebrity
guest Brittany Underwood.

16
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,451
- Hey everyone,
thanks for having me.

17
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,086
- Thanks for being
here, Brittany.

18
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,755
Some animals are content
with just chilling out

19
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,590
and relaxing all day.

20
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,561
But the animals I'm about to
show you are not the calm type.

21
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,663
In fact, they're pretty crazy.

22
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:05,131
Let's take a look
at some animals,

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:09,002
expanding energy in our
next segment, flipping out.

24
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:12,072
Brought to you with commentary
from our first panelist,

25
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:15,208
actor, writer, director,
and musician, Maiara Walsh.

26
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,576
- Hey Liz.

27
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:18,111
- Are you ready for a dog

28
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,413
who will not stop trying to
get their owner's attention?

29
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,381
- This sounds adorable.

30
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,248
I can't wait.

31
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,986
What you doing'?

32
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,889
Dog, stop it.

33
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,661
- Well, you know, at least
they have a free window washer.

34
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,496
Could
you please not?

35
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:39,466
Okay, and there's drool
all over the window.

36
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,870
- Our next panelist is the
amazing comedian, Brian Cooper.

37
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,872
- Can't wait to see
what we got tonight.

38
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:55,582
You think I can't fly?

39
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,616
Are you serious?

40
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,151
You guys haven't seen Dumbo?

41
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:00,553
I got this, watch this, hold
on, wait a second, I got this.

42
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:01,855
I got this, watch this.

43
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,699
- Now we have musician singer
songwriter, Brandon Rogers.

44
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:13,967
- Hey Liz.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,402
- Are you ready for
a very rowdy animal?

46
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,570
- Show me what you got.

47
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,758
what's the opposite
of spring cleaning?

48
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,566
- For our final panelist.

49
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,836
We have singer actor, comedian,
radio host, Mikalah Gordon.

50
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:52,939
- Hey Liz, what clips do
you have for me tonight?

51
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:55,642
- We have an animal who
is just a little excited.

52
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:56,776
- I can't wait.

53
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,059
- I mean, come on.

54
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:14,327
Who doesn't like to
play in the snow.

55
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,567
- Let's take a look
at some of the animals

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,368
who belong in the dog house.

57
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,504
In our next segment, guilty.

58
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,248
Hi.

59
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:49,929
- There's no way I'm
not losing my mind,

60
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:51,164
because if see this monkey,

61
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:53,566
you will see he has
LeBron's wingspan.

62
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,269
He can slap everybody in
that room from that balcony.

63
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,318
- So do you think he has
a favorite candy bar?

64
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,921
Or does he just grab
the first one he sees?

65
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:23,997
Look at that
bear, it's huge.

66
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:26,399
It's in the trash.

67
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:32,538
- This gas station's
prices are too high.

68
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,974
So I'm gonna take a
snack from in here.

69
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,786
- I have one of these
contraptions at home

70
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,790
and if I walk in and my
pet is drinking like this,

71
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,025
I'm not gonna lie to you.

72
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:53,793
I'm gonna be terrified
and also impressed.

73
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,562
- I'm always excited for
this part of the show,

74
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,765
where we introduce you
to a celebrity guest

75
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,033
and their pet.

76
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,567
Today bringing us
her fuzzy friend,

77
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,569
we have Brittany
Underwood from "The Bay"

78
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:04,837
and "One life to live."

79
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,874
- Just chilling here
with my buddy Skeeter.

80
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,108
He's already passed out.

81
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,810
He was like, "mom,
I'm exhausted."

82
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,979
Already it's mid-afternoon.

83
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,015
- Brittany I heard you
had a pretty funny story

84
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,950
about working with
an animal on set.

85
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,285
Do you mind sharing it with us?

86
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,654
- I worked with a
dog on this show.

87
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,456
I think it was an
English bulldog

88
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,824
and we're in the
middle of a scene

89
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,493
and he starts snoring
and we were like,

90
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,963
"Oh, okay."

91
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,399
But we just used it in
the scene and we laughed

92
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,667
and it ended up being fine.

93
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:37,003
So it wasn't like
a horror story.

94
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:39,539
Although I can imagine
that on any type of set,

95
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,808
working with animals,
there's always an option

96
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,011
and a possibility of
like terribly gone wrong.

97
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,746
But I've been lucky,
I've been lucky,

98
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,415
animals are, they've been
good with me I guess.

99
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,751
Right?

100
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,486
- Not every dog is a
consummate professional,

101
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,887
like Skeeter over there.

102
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,657
- Okay, sure.

103
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,393
- I can't to show you what
else we have in store.

104
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:03,896
A howling hound, a curious
cat, a mischievous monkey,

105
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,667
a rowdy raccoon and a dog who
just really wants some pizza.

106
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,837
All this and more next on
world's funniest animals.

107
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,081
Music is an art form.

108
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,351
It requires dedication,
rhythm and focus.

109
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,054
And I'm absolutely not promising

110
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,156
you'll get any of that
in these next clips

111
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:32,225
of animals jamming out.

112
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,660
Or at least
attempting to jam out.

113
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,528
Sing along.

114
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,374
- Looks like someone's had
one too many at the piano bar.

115
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:50,943
- I have to see that again.

116
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,298
- Yes, I prefer music
with my massage.

117
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,132
Thank you.

118
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:27,814
- Do you know how
to play the piano?

119
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,082
"Oh, well I just pick
at the keys a bit."

120
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,792
- Look it's Travis Barker.

121
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:41,561
Get it?

122
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,196
It's a dog.

123
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:01,547
- Nothing like a night
out at the opera huh?

124
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,963
- The funny thing
is that the bird

125
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,065
is much better than the guy.

126
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,567
Try that one,
try.

127
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:27,039
You beat me on that one.

128
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,042
- Do you have a pet who
sticks their nose in the room

129
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:32,178
every time you open
a bag of chips?

130
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:35,715
Or chases after a sound when
it hears an unfamiliar noise?

131
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,450
These next clips feature animals

132
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,353
who are just as
inquisitive as your pets,

133
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:44,223
and maybe even a little more
in our segment, curious pets.

134
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,466
- Nice birdie.

135
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,468
Must not eat, nice birdie.

136
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,074
- This is great.

137
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,309
Look how careful
that cat is being

138
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,610
it's like he doesn't
want a murder rap.

139
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,313
What are you doing?

140
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,817
No, no, no.

141
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:17,857
- When a ferret thinks he's
a better cook than you,

142
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,592
you was not be very good.

143
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,443
Oh very funny guys,
who greased the pole?

144
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,287
- Hey Brittany.

145
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,356
- Okay. Skeeter.

146
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,858
Don't you wanna come
say hi to everybody?

147
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,660
Come say hi Skeets.

148
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:57,830
He's got bedhead, couchhead.

149
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:59,265
Is that a thing?

150
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,834
- Well, Skeeter may have
couchhead, but he's adorable.

151
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,269
Does he know any tricks?

152
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:06,172
- Yes, Skeeter can
do some tricks.

153
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,640
Right Skeeter?

154
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:10,876
- It's Skeeters world,
we're all just living in it.

155
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,911
- Go get it.

156
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,583
Or he just watches me throw
it and looks back at me like,

157
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:19,752
"Are you gonna get that?"

158
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,956
He's like, "I
can't be bothered."

159
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,959
Cool, thanks Skeeter,
you're embarrassing me.

160
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,160
- It's okay, buddy.

161
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,162
It's mom's job to be
in front of the camera.

162
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,864
You keep doing what
you're best at.

163
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,067
- I feel like after this, I've
realized how slacking I am

164
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,403
on teaching Skeeter tricks.

165
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,639
I feel like I wanna teach
him the ones like bang!

166
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,641
And then the dogs go aah.

167
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:42,642
Are you scared?

168
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:43,476
Bang!

169
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:47,413
I'm sorry, I didn't meet it.

170
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:50,316
He just looked at me like,
"mom, did you just kill me?"

171
00:10:52,785 --> 00:10:55,054
Oh my God, his face
is like of betrayal.

172
00:10:55,087 --> 00:10:58,190
I'm so sorry, I don't
wanna teach you that trick.

173
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,159
I love you.

174
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,495
We're good, I promise.

175
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:04,764
- Thanks for coming and bringing
your pet to see us today.

176
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,499
- Well, thanks so
much for having me.

177
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,068
This was so much fun.

178
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,738
- Coming up, we have some
critters who are up to no good,

179
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,073
caught red handed.

180
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,043
Next on world's
funniest animals.

181
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,355
Pets are infamous for chewing
up important documents,

182
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:33,059
hiding socks and stealing
food off the dinner table.

183
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:36,195
These next furry guys have
been caught doing all that

184
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:40,733
and taken it even a step
further, caught red handed.

185
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,602
Okay, so
it's 7:30 in the morning,

186
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:48,441
I woke up and my
bedroom door was shut,

187
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:51,210
which my love left so
I could get some sleep.

188
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,713
But that's a very
dangerous combination.

189
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,915
And so I came out
to the living room,

190
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,616
where my dogs came
running to me.

191
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,455
it looked like this.

192
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:06,459
- I promise you, this was
like that when we woke up.

193
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:08,627
Well, I
did have two pillows,

194
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,131
see it over there,
that's the last one.

195
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,675
- Raccoon videos are
confusing, right?

196
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,176
Is this their pet?

197
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,812
Or are they going to have
to call animal services?

198
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:30,116
Who knows.

199
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:44,864
- Why pay for an expensive
shredder, when you have Max.

200
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,712
- These monkeys are
like velociraptor,

201
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:01,580
they work in teams.

202
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,983
Like stealing candy from a baby.

203
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,955
- Some dogs can sit,
stay and rollover,

204
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,391
but these next animals are
more musically inclined

205
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,559
with their tricks.

206
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:14,693
Join the band.

207
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:28,774
- I mean, I think everyone
has done this right?

208
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,677
Spin around and then
try to walk straight.

209
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,927
- The bird is like,
okay, I'll sing with you,

210
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,595
just quit spitting on me.

211
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,505
- Tonight we have the
two-cat duo playing,

212
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,274
"who even knows at this point."

213
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,479
- Don't go away just yet.

214
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,950
You'll be just as curious as
these animals in our next clip.

215
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,762
These next clips feature
animals who are just as curious

216
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,631
and maybe even a little more,

217
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,200
in our segment,
investigative animals.

218
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:37,810
- And now the new toy, kitty
in a bottle, hours of fun.

219
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:43,215
- Aww, so cute.

220
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:50,055
- In between teacup and
miniature I unveil to you,

221
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:52,024
Mason Jar Kittens.

222
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,174
- Safety first, you must
always hold the handrail.

223
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:26,058
- When you can't
kick the craving,

224
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,993
but you just started your diet.

225
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,387
What are you doing?

226
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:59,558
- Forget expensive water
jets, just get a pet.

227
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,399
- There are certain
phrases like walk or treat,

228
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,135
that can cause our
pet to totally freak.

229
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,204
These clips show
those exact moments

230
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:14,206
where animals are losing it.

231
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:25,451
- So is this a follow
the leader thing?

232
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,287
Or do they know something
that we don't know?

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,690
- Simon says,
"jump, jump, jump."

234
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,791
Oh yeah we got this.

235
00:16:36,695 --> 00:16:38,230
Hey, daddy's home.

236
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,244
Its been a long eight months.

237
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,649
- Now that is true love.

238
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,651
Why can't my roommate
do that when I get home.

239
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,629
- This is me growing up trying
to make sure everybody knows

240
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,132
that I'm not ticklish,
but in all actuality,

241
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:16,535
I'm very ticklish and
I hate being tickled.

242
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,004
- This dog's face is hilarious.

243
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,174
He knows it's coming,
but he can't stop it.

244
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,850
- What like you've never
had an existential crisis

245
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,719
on the couch with your family.

246
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,794
- This dog really loves
world's funniest animals.

247
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,480
- That's it, I'm drafting
him for very obstacle course

248
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,781
known to man.

249
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,783
Water's not slowing
him down, nothing.

250
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,156
- Ahhh, an open air mud bath.

251
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,772
- That's an impressive strike.

252
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,774
- Wait a minute, one
more time on that.

253
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,951
Well, that's almost it for us,

254
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,153
but just in case
you missed anything.

255
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:44,456
Here is a quick recap of
all of the funniest moments,

256
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,859
a cooped up cat,
a DIY dog jacuzzi,

257
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:48,393
a kleptomaniac squirrel.

258
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,796
I still wanna know
what candy bar he took.

259
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,764
Oh, and man's best
feathered friend,

260
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,566
a fatigued feline
trying to relax

261
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,068
during its owner's
piano practice.

262
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,504
A drumming dog and a
cockatoo has decided

263
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:01,507
he prefers his toys on the
ground instead of in the bin.

264
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,042
I might pass out.

265
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:13,085
That's all the time we
have for our show today.

266
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:16,021
Thanks to our fantastic panel
and to our celebrity guest,

267
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,924
Brittany Underwood, and
her pup for joining us.

268
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:22,394
- Look, good bye everybody.

269
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,364
- I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton,

270
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,900
that pizza made Ruby
and I both hungry.

271
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,501
So we're gonna place an order.

272
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,470
Come on, girl,
see you next time.

273
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,072
Right here on world's
funniest animals.

274
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,407
Are you hungry?

275
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,642
I'm hungry.

276
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,743
You're always hungry.

277
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,948
What are you doing?

278
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,129
But he's hungry
though look at him go.
