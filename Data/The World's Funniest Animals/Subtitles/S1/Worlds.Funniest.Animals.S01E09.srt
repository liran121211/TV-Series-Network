time to just chill out.

29

Yea get in there.

Ooh, yeah, a little belly
rub, that's the stuff.

40
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,537
Do I need to start asking
my friends when I go over,

41
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,873
if that's the monkey toothbrush?

42

When's my day off?

00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,067
- Someone said,
curiosity is one of

49
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:50,470
the great secrets to happiness.

50
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,871
That's sure seems to be the case

51
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,040
with the animals in
our next segment.

52
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,277
Who seemed pretty thrilled at
all of their new discoveries.

53
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,478
Curious pets.

54
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,952
- Does anyone know
how these things work?

55
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:15,361
The funny thing is, this
cat has the same reaction

56
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:17,564
as all of us, when
those first came out.

57
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,787
- That's right, Fado
you've been replaced.

58
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,162
He also doesn't need to be fed,

59
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,698
and, he cleans up after himself.

60
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:06,079
Don't worry everyone, I have
this situation taken care of.

61
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,667
- What is it with
cats and cucumbers?

62
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,023
- Okay, first things first,
this cat is adorable.

63
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,794
The cat reaches its little
paw out and does like,

64
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:55,928
a little tiny lick.

65
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,077
- What in the world,
where'd he go?

66
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,214
This guy is a magician.

- This is Dart, or
Dartagnan is his full name.

73
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:32,131
Named after the hot
musketeer and that Dash.

74
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,202
He, dash, is the very timid,
scared one and Dart...

75
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,670
They know theirs
treats in my pocket.

76
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:40,740
Dart is very confident
and outgoing.

77
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,976
Dash is very timid and
scared all the time.

78
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,812
Good boys, good boys.

79
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,647
Thank you for the
kisses, thank you.

80
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:50,917

dogs do any cool tricks?

81
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,752
- Do you just want
to go do some tricks?

82
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,720
Let's go.

83
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,391
And jump!

84
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,693
Oh ooh

85
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,796
And jump!

86
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,664
Oh ooh

87
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,568

jump over you.

88
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,470
- Oh, Oh, Oh.

89
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:15,508
Oh, this isn't a trick, but
he likes a belly scratch.

90
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:18,044
- Thanks for coming on
with your pups Garrett.

91
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,979
Coming up, what would you do

92
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,949
if you came face to
face, a wild bear?

93
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,951
- Animals where
they don't belong.

94
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,320
Next on World's
Funniest Animals.

95
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,865
We're back with one of
my favorite segments,

96
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,800
Animals, Where
They Don't Belong.

97
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,502
I can't wait to show
you what antiques,

98
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,704
these wild animals
have been up to.

99
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,552
- I'm telling you honey,.

100
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,021
They said this was a two
person tub, I promise.

101
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,963
All right,
that's far enough, buddy.

102
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,799
Come on, get outta here.

103
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,970
Go on, get out, come
on, get outta here.

104
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,276
The bear spaced
when he heard the guy,

105
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,577
and he stopped on dime.

106
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,481
All right, that is
Far enough, buddy, come on.

107
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:37,990
- Yeah, so the resorts
are all inclusive,

108
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,292
food and drinks for free.

109
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:49,769
Don't you hate
when you go down to the pool,

110
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,838
and it's just full
of rowdy kids?

111
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,813
- Canning ball!

112
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,453
- Donkeys are known as
some of the most stubborn

113
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,589
creatures in the animal kingdom,

114
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,791
but the animals we're
about to show you,

115
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,627
give them a run for
their money, trust me.

116
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,230
Nothing you could say would
make these animals move.

117
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,265
They are just Too Lazy.

118
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,276
- After a dog's day at
work this guy is exhausted.

119
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:44,257
- Okay, seriously guys,

120
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,392
you knew where I was
when you dropped the toy,

121
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:50,396
and now you expect me
to reach, not cool.

122
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,077
- Okay, move me over to my bowl.

123
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,950
No, I said my bowl,
no, not the door.

124
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,085
Ah great, now we're
just going in circles.

125
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,125
- What?

126
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,630
Okay, am not sure
what sales us more?

127
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,433
The Baggy t-shirt,
the cheese puffs,

128
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,403
or the fact that this dog looks
so normal in this position.

129
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,412
This dog thinks
shopping is a real drag.

130
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,051
Oh I know,
what a good boy.

131
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,321
- Coming up, there
are peering, crying,

132
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,056
and inquiring animals.

Grab a snack and your
pet spirit retreat,

134
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,328
and all grab some more
hilarious animal clips for you.

135
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,897
When we return to
World's Funniest Animals.

136
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,177
Do you have a pet who sticks
their nose in the room

137
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,279
every time you open
a bag of chips?

138
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:16,649
Or chases after a sound, when
it hears an unfamiliar noise?

139
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:19,619
These next clips feature
animals who are just as curious

140
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:22,321
and maybe even a little
more in our segment,

141
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,090
Investigative Animals.

142
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,815
- This is like those ships
in a bottle, but it's a cat.

143
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,189
This gives me anxiety, how
is he going to get out?

144
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,918
- Let's get out
here, what is that?

145
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,586
An alien, it is an alien, run.

146
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,934
There's four of them,
and I still think

147
00:11:41,967 --> 00:11:43,169
the toy is gonna win.

148
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,222
- I am a dog.

149
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:12,264
For a walk, for
a long walk.

150
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,104
- Look at these videos of
animals, living their best life,

151
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:22,274

- This is the
calmest cat in water

153
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,355
I've ever seen in my life.

154
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,336
Are these puppies
in the hammocks?

155
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,704
It's the cutest thing ever.

156
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:06,685
I smelled treats in the package,
are you going to open them?

157
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:07,520
Are you going to open them?

158
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,088
No? I'll open them myself.

159
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,961
What have you found?

160
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,400
- Yea it is for me baby.

161
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,338
Yummy.

162
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:29,708
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

163
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,127
- The little dog is like,
"I'll come to the party,

164
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,095
but I'm not wearing that hat."

165
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:55,668
- Coming up. We see some animals

166
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:58,304
who've decided they
cannot be bothered.

167
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,407
I don't wanna, next on
World's Funniest Animals.

168
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,419
After a long week, sometimes
you just can't be bothered

169
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,989
to get out of bed or off the
couch and do your daily chores.

170
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,992
Our pets have one thing
they have to do each day.

171
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,327
Go for a walk.

172
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,696
Here's some clips with
animals who are too lazy

173
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,731

174
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,735
Betty your
supposed to be walking.

175
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,407
- Wait, wait,

176
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,009
I have to get something
from the back.

177
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,079
Okay, that's what I
needed to get, a seat.

178
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:02,635
- Okay, this is the guy who
inspired the phrase, Cool Cat.

179
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:20,052
- Come on, you guys
all know it's so nice

180
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,787
jumping into fresh sheets.

181
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:33,465
I mean, you can make that bed,
but I am not moving a muscle.

182
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,244
- No, no, I'm now
working out today.

183
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,345
I am not doing it, no.

184
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,081
Gerry, no.

185
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,951
No, I am not doing it.

186
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:09,201
- Most of the time wild
animals belong in two places,

187
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,870
out in nature to be
admired from a far,

188
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,740
and on our televisions
making us laugh.

189
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,209
But these next critters
stuck their noses,

190
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:20,879
and their antlers and trunks
where they shouldn't be.

191
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,314
And it's pretty great.

192
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,350
Wild Animals at Home.

193
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,586
Oh my God, it's

194
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:36,929
It's in the room!

195
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,787
- I like how in
today's day and age,

196
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,590
everyone's reaction is,
"Well, better take a selfie."

197
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,901
- No kids, we're
just looking today.

198
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,003
No one's getting anything.

199
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,414
Nothing says
summer days like

200
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:31,283
jumping through a sprinkler
on the front lawn.

201
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,688
That's some serious refreshment.

202
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:41,827
Oh no, it's breaking.

203
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,295
It is breaking.

204
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:47,966
don't do that.

205
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:03,248
- It is an elephant pool party.

206
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,017
they are really thirsty,

207
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,721
look at them.

208
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:20,766
You guys better
get outta here man.

209
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:30,642
what?

210
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,978
- Don't you just hate
it when party guests

211
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:33,946
don't get the hint.

212
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,789
- Well, that's almost it for us,

213
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:45,624
but just in case
you missed anything,

214
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,927
here is a quick recap of
all of the funniest moments.

215
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,831
A curious cat, peach primates,
a lackadaisical Lassie,

216
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:56,668
a baboon break in, relaxing
rottweilers, puzzle pug,

217
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,437
a cat discovering ice cream,

218
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,206
and a dog who was convinced
their owner is a magician.

219
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,542
Great show.

220
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:12,551
That's it for our show, a
special thanks to our panel,

221
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:15,053
and to our wonderful celebrity
guests, Garrett Clayton,

222
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,322
and his pups, Dart and Dash.

223
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:18,557
- Anytime Liz.

224
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:20,058
- I'm your host,
Elizabeth Stanton.

225
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,661
And Ruby, Hank, and I
will be back next week

226
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,063
with more World's
Funniest Animals.

227
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,433
Until then, pamper those pets
like there's no tomorrow.

228
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,428
They are really
thirsty look at them.
