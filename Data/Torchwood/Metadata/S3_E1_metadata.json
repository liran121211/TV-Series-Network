Frobisher tells the Prime Minister, whose chief concern is hushing up a past mystery. Gwen goes to see Clem, the child who escaped the aliens years earlier in Scotland. He is a psychic who senses before she does that she is pregnant and believes his friends were abducted by aliens, now poised to return to Earth. After visiting his daughter Alice, Jack is lured into a government trap by a seemingly friendly young doctor, Rupesh. Rupesh is shot and Jack escapes but with a bomb implanted in his body. Clem senses that government agents are coming for him and goes on the run.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "The children of the world seem frozen in time momentarily and then snap out of it and carry on as if nothing has happened. With reports coming in of the worldwide impact of the phenomena, Torchwood offers its services in the investigation. They are also looking to recruit a new member whom they recently met at a local hospital and who seems to be quite keen. A second episode with children later that day foretells the coming of what is likely an alien entity. Gwen discovers that there is one adult who was affected much as the children and it appears the aliens may have visited Earth in the 1960s. For Torchwood, however, their offer of assistance is met by an attack by government forces.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1288549", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 1870, "number_of_episodes": 41}
