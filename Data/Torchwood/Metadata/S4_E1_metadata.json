Gwen and Rhys have a baby girl and live on the seaside, away from the hustle and bustle of the world. When Gwen gets a call from her friend Sgt. Andy Davidson, she expects the worse. What she learns is that for last two days, no one in the world has died. Immortality however is not necessarily a good thing as at the current rate, there will be severe food shortages in less than four months. Rhys is not at all keen on Gwen starting any kind of investigation. Capt. Jack Harkness meanwhile is in the United States where he rescues a CIA agent, Esther Drummond, from an assassination attempt. Her partner, Rex Matheson was severely injured but like everyone else on Earth, cannot die. Esther believes there is a connection between Miracle Day and Torchwood and Rex heads to the UK to find Gwen.
