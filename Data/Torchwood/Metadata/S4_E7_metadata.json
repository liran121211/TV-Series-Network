She's taken Jack prisoner and tells him she's convinced that it was something he did in his past that is at the root of Miracle Day. In flashbacks, we learn that Jack came to America in 1927 on a Torchwood mission. He befriends Angelo Colasanto and they are soon involved with bootleggers. When Colasanto realizes that Jack is immortal, he takes him prisoner, subjecting him to repeated deaths only to have him revive.
