Owen can't quite figure out the cause of death which appears to be from a gun or musket shot. Tosh meanwhile meets an attractive stranger named Mary in a bar who seems to know a great deal about Torchwood. She gives Tosh a pendant that allows her to hear people's thoughts. Initially, she's repulsed at actually hearing what other are thinking - about her, about those around them and so on - but when she overhears someone who is about to kill his wife and child and manages to stop him, she realizes that some good can come of it. She's not prepared for the revelation her new friend has for her when Tosh suggests turning the pendant over to Torchwood.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0852918", "rating": 7.2, "votes": 1432, "number_of_episodes": 41}
