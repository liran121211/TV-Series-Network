Hundreds of people have disappeared without a trace, but why is Jack obstructing attempts to find them? The answer seems to lie in the rift, and as Gwen follows the trail, she makes a shocking discovery.\u2014Anonymous", "Gwen's police friend, PC Andy Davidson, asks her to look into the case of 15-year-old Jonah Bevin who disappeared seven months ago without a trace. She empathizes with Jonah's mother for not knowing what's happened to him; this is perhaps the greatest burden she has to bear and something she would not wish on any parent. Tosh is unable to find any significant rift activity for the moment when Jonah disappeared but surveillance video shows that Jack was there not long after. When Jonah's mother starts a support group for people who have had loved ones go missing, a huge crowd shows up and Gwen realizes that Jonah's disappearance is not an isolated incident. When Tosh finds a minor anomaly in the rift data, they begin to wonder if the rift might be taking people away. Jack, however, orders Gwen's investigation shut down and is clearly hiding something. Gwen refuses to obey him but is not prepared for what she finds.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1190500", "rating": 8.1, "votes": 1175, "number_of_episodes": 41}
