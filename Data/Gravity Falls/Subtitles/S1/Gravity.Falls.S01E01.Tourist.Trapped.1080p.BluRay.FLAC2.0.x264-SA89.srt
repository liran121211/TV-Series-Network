348
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,382
That's for breaking my heart!

349
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:12,842
Ow! My face!

350
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,720
And this is for messing with my brother!

351
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,846
(GROANS)

352
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,931
- Wanna do the honors?
- On three!

353
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,641
- One! Two! Three!
- One! Two! Three!

354
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,230
(SCREAMING) I'll get you back for this!

355
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:27,773
(ALL SCREAMING)

356
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,650
Who's giving orders? I need orders!

357
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,652
My arms are tired.

358
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,946
Anyone else wants some?

359
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,951
(WHIMPERING)

360
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,162
(BLEATING)

361
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:42,580
(GNOME SCREAMING)

362
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,044
Hey, Dipper,
I'm sorry for ignoring your advice.

363
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,004
You really were just looking out for me.

364
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,507
Oh, don't be like that.
You saved our butts back there!

365
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,717
I guess I'm just sad

366
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,887
that my first boyfriend turned out
to be a bunch of gnomes.

367
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,098
Look on the bright side.
Maybe the next one will be a vampire.

368
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,684
Oh! You're just saying that!

369
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,478
Awkward sibling hug?

370
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,355
Awkward sibling hug.

371
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,440
- Pat. Pat.
- Pat. Pat.

372
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,983
(ENTRY BELL RINGS)

373
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,196
Sheesh! You two get hit
by a bus or something? Ha!

374
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,452
Hey! Wouldn't you know it?

375
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,663
I accidentally overstocked
some inventory,

376
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,666
so, how's about you each take one item
from the gift shop,

377
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,875
on the house, you know?

378
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,627
- Really?
- What's the catch?

379
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,963
That catch is do it before I change
my mind. Now take something.

380
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,174
- Hmm...
- Ooh! (CHUCKLES)

381
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,220
Hmm.

382
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,471
That ought to do the trick!

383
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,975
And I will have a grappling hook!

384
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,103
Yes!

385
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,397
Wouldn't you rather have,
like, a doll or something?

386
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,609
Grappling hook!

387
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:54,777
Fair enough!

388
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,867
DIPPER: <i>This journal told me there
was no one in Gravity Falls I could trust.</i>

389
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:05,037
<i>But when you battle a hundred
gnomes side by side with someone,</i>

390
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:08,749
<i>you realize that they've probably
always got your back.</i>

391
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,751
Hey, Mabel, could you get the light?

392
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,628
I'm on it.

393
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,256
It worked!

394
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,757
(BOTH LAUGHING)

395
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,050
Grappling hook.

396
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,011
<i>DIPPER: Our uncle told us there was
nothing strange about this town.</i>

397
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,433

are waiting to be unlocked?</i>
