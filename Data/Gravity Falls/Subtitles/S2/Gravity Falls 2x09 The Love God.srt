00:00:00,705 --> 00:00:04,308
<i>Whoa!
That cloud looks like a chipmunk.</i>

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,311
<i>- Barfing an airplane.
- It does.</i>

3
00:00:07,363 --> 00:00:10,480
<i>Uh, that cloud
looks like... uh, a cloud.</i>

00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:12,483
<i>- Boo!
- Thompson, stop being</i>

5
00:00:12,484 --> 00:00:15,552
<i>- the worst at everything.
- Sorry, guys.</i>

6
00:00:16,722 --> 00:00:18,722
Look at the clouds.

7
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:21,658
Ooh! That cloud looks like
a big heart-shaped balloon.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,544
Clouds don't come in colors.
That is a balloon.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,713
Oh, dude, it's the Woodstick festival.

10
00:00:26,749 --> 00:00:30,400
- Wait. The wood what?
- It's this annual outdoor concert

11
00:00:30,436 --> 00:00:32,569
featuring Oregon's
up-and-coming indie bands.

12
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:34,721
Hey. They're all coming.

13
00:00:34,757 --> 00:00:38,508
<i>Scarves Indoors, Wood Grain
On Everything, Love God.</i>

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,410
<i>You've probably seen
him in that viral video.</i>

15
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:41,812
<i>Who's ready to fall in love tonight?</i>

16
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:46,483
<i>Oh. Ow! Ow!
I hope nobody's filming this.</i>

17
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:48,685
Whoa, like a real concert concert?

18
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,488
I've... I've never actually
been to one of those before.

19
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:52,689
That's because you've
never had an awesome crew

20
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:54,825
- to roll with before.
- Come on, Thompson.

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,561
<i>Lick that sponge.
Lick that sponge.</i>

22
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:59,463
Oh! I can't believe he's doing it.

23
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:03,310
- What is he doing?
- When you're with us, you're in.

24
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:13,844
Ghosty sounds.
Cemetery ghosty sounds!

25
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:15,545
It's coming from that open grave.

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,384
- You look.
- No. You look.

27
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:21,651
Thompson, go look.

28
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:25,389
Heh. Nice use of Thompson.
Gaze upon death.

29
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:27,791
<i>Gaze upon death.
Gaze upon death.</i>

30
00:01:27,826 --> 00:01:29,393
<i>Gaze upon death.</i>

31
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:30,727

00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:17,231
Ugh! It's even
creepier than I expected.

35
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:22,636
Why did she leave me?

36
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,439
- Robbie?
- Wendy! Oh. Uh.

37
00:02:27,676 --> 00:02:29,476
Hey, what's up?

38
00:02:29,511 --> 00:02:31,612
Just hanging out in
this grave, you know.

39
00:02:31,647 --> 00:02:34,414
Regular. Regular day for me.

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,650
Whoa, dude, we haven't seen
you in, like, a million years.

41
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:38,285
Where have you been?

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,220
You're not still mourning
our break-up, are you?

43
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,455
What? No way.

44
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,691
Robbie, we split up forever ago.

45
00:02:44,727 --> 00:02:47,327
It's really sweet you'd throw
yourself into a grave for me,

46
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:49,329
but, man, time to move on.

47
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:51,365
What? I've totally moved on.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,333
<i>♪ Wendy, I miss you so much ♪</i>

49
00:02:53,369 --> 00:02:56,503
<i>♪ I'll never move on ♪
♪ never ever ♪</i>

50
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:59,373
That was a different Wendy.
Unrelated Wendy.

51
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:01,408
Dude, this is getting really awkward.

52
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:05,209
Yeah, the cemetery used to be fun.
Now it's just depressing.

53
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:15,389
Wait. You guys, he's in pain.

54
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:17,224
We can't just ditch him here.

55
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,259
Come on, Mabel.
It's Robbie.

56
00:03:19,295 --> 00:03:20,594
But he's suffering.

57
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:24,231
How can I be happy if I
know someone else is sad?

58
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:26,333
It totally throws off
my happiness chart.

59
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,304
Mabel, trust me.

60
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,505
If there's one thing
I've learned this summer,

61
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,441
it's not to get mixed up
in needless romantic drama.

62
00:03:34,476 --> 00:03:37,511
Besides, we're finally
in with Wendy's friends.

63
00:03:37,546 --> 00:03:40,347
With Robbie gone, there's
a good social balance.

64
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:43,016
Maybe we should just let
a good thing be, you know?

65
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:46,586
Just eat me already, man.

66
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,355
I was just being dramatic.

67
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,897
Quit it. Ow! Ow!
My face. Vulture!

68
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:55,696
Oh, man.
I'm sorry you guys had to see that.

69
00:03:55,731 --> 00:03:58,632
You know, what Robbie needs?
A new girl.

70
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,634
Romance is like gum.

71
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,903
Once it's lost its flavor,
you just cram another one in.

72
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,240
Mabel, it's not that easy.

73
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:10,177
It is if you're the
world's greatest matchmaker.

74
00:04:10,212 --> 00:04:12,346
I've never had an unhappy customer.

75
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:15,248
- Like Soos and Melody.
- Watch this.

76
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:16,650
Walking down some actual stairs.

77
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,220
- Did it look cool?
- The coolest.

78
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:21,588
Match made!

79
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:24,424
And then, of course,
there's Waddles and Gompers.

80
00:04:28,597 --> 00:04:30,330
Match made.

81
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:33,400
That might work for a goat and a pig,
but Robbie's a hopeless case.

82
00:04:33,435 --> 00:04:37,204
Hopeless case, e-e-e-e-eh...?

83
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:40,574
♪ Putting a rainbow wig
on a big white gorilla ♪

84
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:46,613
What the...?
Oh, no. Hot air balloons.

85
00:04:46,615 --> 00:04:49,332
Fixed gear bikes.

86
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,501
♪ Singing 'bout the open road ♪

87
00:04:51,537 --> 00:04:54,321
♪ my sandals are so open-toed ♪

88
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:58,258
Folk music!
It's the Woodstick festival!

89
00:04:58,293 --> 00:05:00,260
Soos! Lock down the
shack and hide my shirts

90
00:05:00,295 --> 00:05:02,496
before anyone tie-dyes them!

91
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:05,298
They're slow.
I can probably take a few down.

92
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,502
Wait, Mr. Pines!
I've been thinking.

93
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,571
Every year this festival
comes by and every

94
00:05:10,572 --> 00:05:12,606
year you shun what could
be potential customers.

95
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:14,641
You really think I can
make money off of these

96
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:17,477
free-loading,
kale-munching freak shows?

97
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:20,213
You just got to figure
out what appeals to them.

98
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:23,250
Hmm.
How do I appeal to young people?

99
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:30,290
So young people are into
hot air balloons, e-e-e-e-eh?

100
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:35,495
All right, Mabel.
Robbie's a broken teacup,

101
00:05:35,497 --> 00:05:37,631
and you're going to
piece him back together.

102
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,303
Okay, this could get intense.

103
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:47,641
- Howdy doo!
- Happy day!

104
00:05:47,676 --> 00:05:51,611
It is intense!
You're Robbie's parents?

105
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:52,646
I always thought he was, like,

106
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:55,315
raised by sad wolves or something.

107
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,417
Oh, well, he doesn't
like to talk about us.

108
00:05:57,453 --> 00:06:00,187
He always says we're too
cheerful for funeral directors.

109
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,440
Come in. Come in.

110
00:06:06,328 --> 00:06:09,463
- Cracker platter?
- Oh, no time for crackers. Sorry.

111
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,298
I'm here to cheer Robbie up.

112
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:13,366
Cannot have a dry
cracker mouth for that.

113
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:17,404
Robbie Stacey Valentino!
There's little a girl here to see you.

114
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,507
You go on up.
And could you bring him his lunch?

115
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:23,343
Lady, I like your style.

116
00:06:24,546 --> 00:06:27,180
You know who would look
good in a sweater like that?

117
00:06:27,216 --> 00:06:30,376
- Mrs. Grabelson's remains!
- Oh, absolutely!

118
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,297
Robbie, it's Mabel!

119
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:45,499
<i>Who?</i>

120
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:48,268
Remember me?
I'm like girl Dipper.

121
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:49,469
<i>Ugh, go away.</i>

122
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:51,238
I heard a "come in."

123
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,242
Ahh! Hey!

124
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:58,512
Listen, kid, nobody in the
Pines family is welcome here.

125
00:06:58,547 --> 00:07:03,019
In case you forgot, your stupid brother
is the one who ruined my life!

126
00:07:04,453 --> 00:07:06,520
And Mabel's the one who's gonna fix it.

127
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:10,557
Listen, Robbie, I always used
to see you as a creepy jerk.

128
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:13,260
Like the human version of rat poison.

129
00:07:13,295 --> 00:07:15,613
- Uh, go on.
- But when I saw you

130
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:19,316
in the cemetery today,
I realized, Robbie's not a bad guy.

131
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,234
He's just a heartbroken soul

132
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,171
who needs love... and
gloves with fingers.

133
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:27,240
- Hey, fingerless gloves look awesome.
- No, they don't.

134
00:07:27,276 --> 00:07:30,177
Robbie, you just need a good matchmaker.

135
00:07:30,212 --> 00:07:33,647
I guarantee I'll find you true love,
or twice your sadness back.

136
00:07:33,682 --> 00:07:36,883
If I say yes, will you leave my room?

137
00:07:38,453 --> 00:07:40,253
I guarantee it.

138
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:47,527
Okay, Gravity Falls, who
wants to go out with Robbie?

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,412
Okay. Lazy Susan, too old.

140
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:58,416
<i>Grenda, too young.
Multi-bear?</i>

141
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:01,152
I'm putting you in the "maybe" pile.

142
00:08:01,188 --> 00:08:04,589
<i>Who could it be?
Who could it be?</i>

143
00:08:06,326 --> 00:08:09,160
What's that, Gompers?
Someone we already know?

144
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:12,397
But who could possibly be superficial
and gothy enough for...

145
00:08:12,432 --> 00:08:14,499
Of course, that's it!

146
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:18,270
You two really are America's
favorite power couple.

147
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:21,606
<i>More snacks! More snacks!</i>

148
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:23,174
<i>More snacks!</i>

149
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,275
I'm just happy to be included.

150
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:27,612
Ha! This is brilliant.

151
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:30,348
The perfect way to sneak
cheap snacks into the concert.

152
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,584
- And it was all Dipper's idea.
- Whoo! Nice.

153
00:08:32,619 --> 00:08:34,352
- Well done.
- Ideas!

154
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,255
Kid, I sense greatness in you.

155
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:39,591
Oh, well, I don't know about...

156
00:08:39,626 --> 00:08:42,661
- Greatness!
- All right, now, everyone go home

157
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,396
and finish getting
ready for the concert.

158
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:48,199
- Hey, don't wait up, Tambers.
- Don't call me Tambers.

159
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:50,602
Classic Tambers.

160
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:56,441
"Tambry. You. Me. Date.
Bring that sweet, sweet bod.

161
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:58,641
Your secret admirer."

162
00:09:02,316 --> 00:09:06,217
Love is about to happen, Lazy Susan.
Watch and learn.

163
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,257
Ugh! Robbie?

164
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:15,360
- You're my secret admirer?
- Tambry? Ugh!

165
00:09:15,395 --> 00:09:17,262
This is just what I get
for trusting a toddler.

166
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,364
Listen, I don't think
this is gonna work out.

167
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:22,534
Dating somebody I already know?
It's kind of like admitting defeat.

168
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:26,137
- Um, way to assume I'm even interested.
- Tambry, let's be real.

169
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:28,239
If I wanted to date you,
I would have done it already.

170
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:29,607
I'm just a little out of your league.

171
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:32,444
Whoa, is that mustard?
Don't want to waste that bad boy.

172
00:09:33,647 --> 00:09:36,481
Status update.
On blind date with sociopath.

173
00:09:36,516 --> 00:09:39,384
Oh, sure. Bring out the phone.
Classic Tambers.

174
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,420
Hey, can I get some chili fries?
To go!

175
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,489
What? How is this possible?

176
00:09:44,524 --> 00:09:47,192
I'm supposed to be the
best matchmaker ever.

177
00:09:47,227 --> 00:09:48,193
<i>Did you hear that? Did you hear that?</i>

178
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:49,427
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

179
00:09:51,365 --> 00:09:56,167
Whoo-hoo!
Who's ready to fall in love tonight?

180
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,335
<i>Love God!</i>

181
00:10:00,273 --> 00:10:01,573
That's what they call me.

182
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:03,475
We're rewriting history tonight,

183
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,577
and it starts with you and you.

184
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:11,508
Love is real and it's in your face!

185
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:14,486
What's your name, you little angel?

186
00:10:14,521 --> 00:10:16,254
Meredith.

187
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,423
Meredith, Meredith, we got a problem.

188
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,393
That cutie right there is your soulmate
and you're living without him.

189
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:24,295
Oh, no.
What do I do?

190
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,697
Get it, girl.
You know what you love.

191
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:28,242
Pow! Match made!

192
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:29,567
Ha-ha!

193
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:32,337
I must know how this works!

194
00:10:33,607 --> 00:10:36,474
Hi. Love God?
Mabel here. Big fan.

195
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,477
Can I just say, that was some of the

196
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:40,445
finest matchmaking I've ever seen?

197
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,348
Can you please, please,
please tell me your secret?

198
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:46,384
Well, between you and
me, let's just say,

199
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,620
my name's not exactly a coincidence.

200
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,357
Oh. My. Love God.

201
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:55,693
- Are you an actual love god?
- Call me a cherub.

202
00:10:55,729 --> 00:10:57,695
The internet pretty much
does my job for me nowadays,

203
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,365
so I've taken some time
to focus on my rock career.

204
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,201
Boom. Cassette.
Boom. For you.

205
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:06,538
Oh! That's... great.

206
00:11:06,573 --> 00:11:09,340
So anyway, can you make
anything fall in love?

207
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:11,309
Like that snake and that badger?

208
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,513
Hmm.
Ah, gee, I don't know.

209
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,248
That might be kind of hard to...

210
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,516
Ka-boom! Match made!

211
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,557
They're gonna make a snadger.
How you doing that?

212
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:28,193
Love potion, yo. I got it all.

213
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:30,562
Summer love, young love, anti-love.

214
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:33,565
You just got to put a little
on your fingers and pow!

215
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,367
I need that potion.
How much would it cost?

216
00:11:36,386 --> 00:11:38,336
Um, would you accept
squirrels as payment?

217
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:41,239
Whoa-oh-oh!
No way.

218
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:42,640
You might think you know
what's best for people,

219
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:45,560
but this stuff can have
major social consequences.

220
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:48,480
That's why it can only be
used by a serious expert.

221
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,648
Love God!
Sign my face.

222
00:11:50,684 --> 00:11:53,351
Only if you sign mine,
baby. Let's get weird!

223
00:11:58,425 --> 00:11:59,457
Shh.

224
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:04,596
Mind if I add a little
something to these fries?

225
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,397
I don't see why not.

226
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:17,249
Whoa! Did your whole thing
suddenly get a lot more likeable?

227
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:21,246
You don't seem as needy as
I used to think you were.

228
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:23,515
Hey, you wouldn't want to
maybe get out of here and,

229
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,417
I don't know, go kiss in public a lot?

230
00:12:26,453 --> 00:12:29,554
For some reason, I do.
Status update.

231
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,224
You know what? Forget it.

232
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,560
Maybe I should stare at something
other than my phone for a while.

233
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:39,397
Match made!

234
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:45,436
All right, who's ready for the best
and most overpriced day of our summer?

235
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:47,238
<i>- Whoo-hoo! Yay!
- All right!</i>

236
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,307
I brought a baggie of trail mix

237
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:52,277
and safety whistles in
case we get separated.

238
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:54,014
Lame.

239
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:58,550
- This kid is a champion.
- We're just waiting on Tambry.

240
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:00,418
Can't leave without Tambry.

241
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:04,222
Sorry, guys, but Tambry's
a little busy at the moment.

242
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:05,390
Wink. Wink.

243
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:07,258
What does that mean?
Why are you winking?

244
00:13:07,294 --> 00:13:10,562
Let's just say she and Robbie
took a trip to smoochville.

245
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:12,497
Now everyone's happy!

246
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:15,266
Wait. Wait.
Robbie and Tambry?

247
00:13:15,302 --> 00:13:17,335
- This can't be happening.
- How's that?

248
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,637
He knew I liked her!
How could he do this?!

249
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,473
Whoa, hold it.
You like Tambry?

250
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:24,509
And you told Robbie but not me?

251
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:28,513
- You always make fun of my crushes, man.
- That's what we do, genius.

252
00:13:28,548 --> 00:13:31,416
Oh. Oh.
This is so like Tambry to do this.

253
00:13:31,451 --> 00:13:34,485
Date my ex behind my back.
I'm gonna tear her highlights out.

254
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:37,455
Guys! Guys! Calm down.
We're gonna be late for the concert.

255
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,357
Uh, news flash, kid.

256
00:13:39,392 --> 00:13:41,659
I'm not going to the concert.
Not with him.

257
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,394
Hey, that won't be a
problem 'cause I'm out.

258
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,529
Me, too.

259
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:46,564
Wait! Wait!
This group is all I have!

260
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,667
<i>Don't make me go back to
having no friends! Guys!</i>

261
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,351
Match... made?

262
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:58,346
Wait, guys. Don't go.
Not my mailbox!

263
00:13:58,382 --> 00:14:00,248
Ow!

264
00:14:00,284 --> 00:14:02,484
What did you just do?!

265
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,154
I've let these guys pick on me for years
to keep this group together.

266
00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:08,290
And now they've totally fallen apart.

267
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,425
But we were all starting to
finally hang out together.

268
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,227
I was one of the gang.

269
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:14,362
Well, unless you can break up
Robbie and Tambry immediately,

270
00:14:14,398 --> 00:14:17,265
there is no gang.
I have no more friends.

271
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:20,445
And neither do you.
I'm gonna eat this.

272
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:22,604
Mabel, what did I tell you

273
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,273
about staying out of
Robbie's personal life?

274
00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:29,177
I know. I know!
I just wanted to be a good matchmaker.

275
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:31,446
I never should have gotten
love potion from the Love God.

276
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:33,315
Wait, love potion?

277
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,217
If you did a spell, then
can't you, like, undo it?

278
00:14:36,253 --> 00:14:37,552
That's it!

279
00:14:37,588 --> 00:14:40,622
If I undo the spell,
then everyone will be friends again.

280
00:14:40,657 --> 00:14:42,591
But I'm gonna need your help.

281
00:14:42,626 --> 00:14:45,293
Also, you are not
pulling off that V-neck.

282
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,362
- I know.
- Burn it!

283
00:14:48,498 --> 00:14:50,131
<i>Oho! Ha! Ha!</i>

284
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:55,637
Balloon faster, Soos!

285
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:59,207
We need this thing up in the air
before the festival ends.

286
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:00,342
Are you sure that that
open flame should be

287
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:02,177
that close to that
dangling cloth and rope?

288
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:04,847
I'm sure about everything.
Now lube up those engine

289
00:15:04,848 --> 00:15:08,108
gears with some kerosene.
More kerosene!

290
00:15:11,154 --> 00:15:13,521
Unh! Come back, guys!
Come on.

291
00:15:13,557 --> 00:15:16,491
The tickets were 100 bucks.
I sold my watch.

292
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:18,326
You got to come to the concert.

293
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:21,196
Ew, and have to look at that?
No, thanks.

294
00:15:23,467 --> 00:15:25,550
Ugh, they're doing
that couple hug-walk.

295
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:28,303
Guys, you're in public!
People can see you!

296
00:15:28,338 --> 00:15:29,437
Dipper. Come on.

297
00:15:31,642 --> 00:15:34,142
Love God. Sound check for Love God.

298
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:36,611
Ow!
Let's make some miracles happen.

299
00:15:36,647 --> 00:15:39,147
Groupies, bed-head me.

300
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:42,217
Love God's about to get crazy.

301
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:43,385
Whoa. Hey, all right.

302
00:15:45,489 --> 00:15:47,255
Now's our chance.

303
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,191
Here we go. Let's see.

304
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:53,495
Puppy love, inter-species
love, love of country music.

305
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,529
Ew.

306
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:56,464
Oh! Anti-love.

307
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,533
To reverse the effects of love potion,

308
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:01,569
simply spray on your victim and
watch their heart die on the inside.

309
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:04,506
- Sounds good to me.
- Hey!

310
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:07,208
You're the one who's
been stealing my stuff.

311
00:16:07,244 --> 00:16:09,943
- I am not loving this.
- I'm sorry.

312
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:12,313
But I made a
mistake and I have to fix it.

313
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:15,483
Kid, I tried to tell you.
This stuff is way too dangerous.

314
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,153
On my oath as a god, I cannot let you...

315
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:19,187
Oh, hey, where did you just go?

316
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:21,523
<i>I'm sorry, Love God!
But it's for the good of my friends!</i>

317
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,158
Come back here!

318
00:16:25,262 --> 00:16:26,227
Dipper, catch!

319
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,436
Get those kids!

320
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:39,407
<i>- Halt!
- We mustache you to move!</i>

321
00:16:40,477 --> 00:16:41,476
Good one.

322
00:16:44,414 --> 00:16:47,132
Ooh! Thank you.

323
00:16:48,418 --> 00:16:50,502
No, no, no, everyone's
touching everything!

324
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:52,470
Give me back the potion!

325
00:16:52,506 --> 00:16:55,140
Oh, hey, what's up?
Here, have a cassette.

326
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:00,562
Dang it. Fly, tiny wings.

327
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:02,397
Get up there. Oh!

328
00:17:02,432 --> 00:17:04,232
I haven't had to use
these in a long time.

329
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:10,505
Dipper. Look.

330
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:16,444
Just one clean shot to
the back of their heads

331
00:17:16,496 --> 00:17:18,163
and everything's fixed.

332
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:22,383
Sorry, kids, but you've
left me no choice.

333
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:24,452
Visions of heartbreak past!

334
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,389
<i>We're back, Mabel.</i>

335
00:17:28,425 --> 00:17:30,425
<i>We like you now.</i>

336
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,595
<i>Yes. Definitely. Absolutely.</i>

337
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,197
Ha! You really think we'd fall for that?

338
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,367
Sure you can all marry me!

339
00:17:39,402 --> 00:17:43,438
Oh! Guy from the $10 bill.
I forgot I had a crush on you.

340
00:17:43,473 --> 00:17:45,406
Dang it, Mabel.
They're not real.

341
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:48,118
<i>Just give us the bottle, Mabel.</i>

342
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,178
Mabel, don't!

343
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:52,530
It's finally done.
When these idiots see this balloon,

344
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:54,382
they'll understand that
I love young people.

345
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:58,553
"I heart kids."
All right, let 'er rip.

346
00:18:00,157 --> 00:18:02,123
Oh. Oh, no! A letter rip!

347
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,324
What the H?!

348
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,334
<i> I eat kids?
But we're kids!</i>

349
00:18:13,386 --> 00:18:16,554
It's heaven's punishment
for our terrible taste in everything!

350
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:25,346
Mommy, is the floating
head going to eat us?

351
00:18:25,382 --> 00:18:27,448
Yes, Charlie!
Yes, he will.

352
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:34,155
Mabel, it's a trick!
Don't give him the...

353
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:35,290
Gotcha!

354
00:18:36,426 --> 00:18:39,227
Oh! Curse my oversized heart.

355
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:42,297
Sorry, kids, but that's what happens
when you mess with a god.

356
00:18:42,332 --> 00:18:44,299
Only a greater being from
the heavens themselves

357
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:47,168
could possibly stop...

358
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:48,369
<i>It's coming down!</i>

359
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:51,573
Whoooooa!

360
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,480
Oh, no.
I hope someone didn't die.

361
00:18:59,516 --> 00:19:03,184
Yes, that would be awful.

362
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,385
What's everybody crying about?

363
00:19:04,387 --> 00:19:07,055
In my day, Zeppelins fell
from the sky like raindrops.

364
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:10,325
It's him!
The horrible old man from the sky!

365
00:19:14,264 --> 00:19:17,565
You know what?
Being loved by the youth is overrated.

366
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:20,201
Being feared? Now that's priceless.

367
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:22,470
Love God, are you okay?

368
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,305
Please be immortal.
Please be immortal.

369
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:29,210
Dude. I am so over this!

370
00:19:29,246 --> 00:19:32,213
<i>Love God to the stage.
Love God to the stage.</i>

371
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:34,282
Look, kid, take it, okay?

372
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,150
Spray everyone for all I care.

373
00:19:36,186 --> 00:19:38,553
You want to mess with people's lives?
You want to play god?

374
00:19:38,588 --> 00:19:40,321
Do it. 'Cause I'm sick of it.

375
00:19:40,357 --> 00:19:44,259
Medic, I need... I need onion rings!

376
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:48,196
Okay, Mabel, now's our chance.

377
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:50,164
They break up and the whole
friend group gets back together.

378
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:58,339
Mabel!
Mabel, I just wanted to thank you.

379
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:01,142
I've been so miserable
since Wendy broke up with me

380
00:20:01,177 --> 00:20:02,543
that I thought my life was over.

381
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:06,147
But you were right.
I just needed to move on.

382
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:10,518
I'm... happy?
Weird, huh?

383
00:20:10,553 --> 00:20:13,854
<i>Robbie, people are
commenting on our pictures.</i>

384
00:20:16,376 --> 00:20:19,294
Dipper, maybe we shouldn't do this.

385
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:22,330
I mean, every time we've
played with people's fates,

386
00:20:22,365 --> 00:20:24,465
it's only made things worse.

387
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:29,270
They are kind of perfect for each other,
in a gross kind of way.

388
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:31,205
But what about our friend group?

389
00:20:31,241 --> 00:20:34,343
Well, maybe it'll sort itself
out. I mean, there's got

390
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:37,445
to be something that could
bring everyone back together.

391
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,796
Guys, I made a friendship cake.

392
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:43,179
So let's all get over this, okay?
Ugh!

393
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,618
My cake!

394
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:48,623
Hey! Food from the outside!

395
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:50,191
Ohhhh!

396
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,292
Get him!

397
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:54,395
- Who! Hey, look.
- Is that Thompson?

398
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:59,334
Oh, man.
Yeah, fight the machine, Thompson!

399
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:01,569
- Throw snacks at 'em.
- Use jerky as a weapon.

400
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:03,221
Thompson!

401
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:04,305
<i>Thompson!

402
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:06,207

404
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:09,510
<i>Thompson! Thompson!</i>

405
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,479
<i>Thompson! Thompson!</i>

406
00:21:11,514 --> 00:21:13,448
<i>Thompson! Thompson!</i>

407
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:15,283
<i>Thompson! Thompson...</i>

408
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:26,708
I think everything
just might be all right.

409
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,878
Maybe someone up there really
is a genius matchmaker.

410
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,663
All according to plan.
