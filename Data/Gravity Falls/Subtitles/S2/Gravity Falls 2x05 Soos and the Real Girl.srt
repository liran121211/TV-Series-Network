1
00:00:02,022 --> 00:00:03,740
La la la la la la la-- ahh!

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,627
Braces, braces
caught in the screen door!

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,713
Someone dictate my will!
I'm giving it all to waddles!

4
00:00:10,764 --> 00:00:12,382
Say "ah," girl-dude.

5
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:13,633
Ahh-uh!

6
00:00:14,768 --> 00:00:16,719
Soos!
You saved me!

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,805
Just doing my job, hambone!

8
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:20,723
I'll see you dudes tomorrow!

9
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:21,774
Bye, Soos!

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:22,775
Night, Soos!

11
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,477
Night, Soos!

12
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:25,645
Doo doo doo...

13
00:00:25,696 --> 00:00:27,730
Walking to my car...

14
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:29,566
You ever wonder what Soos does

15
00:00:29,617 --> 00:00:31,401
when he's not here
at the mystery shack?

16
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:32,485
- No.
- Not really.

17
00:00:32,487 --> 00:00:33,536
Not once ever.

18
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,657
Punch!

19
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:38,658
Punch those leopards.

20
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,827
Ooh, highlights are done!

21
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:42,662
You are gonna make
the other grandmas

22
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:45,548
at the bingo hall so jealous.

23
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:46,666
<i>Just a minute, mijo.</i>

24
00:00:46,717 --> 00:00:48,501
Look at this.

25
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:51,554
Your cousin Reggie is having an
engagement party next month.

26
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:53,590
Wait, wait.
Reggie is engaged?

27
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,675
But he's like
the poor man's Soos!

28
00:00:55,726 --> 00:00:58,595
I do not want to pressure you,
but you are a man now.

29
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:00,847
In a way, it's time for you
to start meeting girls.

30
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:02,682
I would like to see you settled

31
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:05,518
before I ascend to heaven
and live with the angels.

32
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,686
And with grandpa!

33
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:09,522
No, he is not there.

34
00:01:09,524 --> 00:01:11,741
Please find a girl to bring
to Reggie's engagement.

35
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,693
For abuelita.

36
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:17,497
No problem!

37
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:19,866
I'm great at fixing stuff,
playing video games,

38
00:01:19,868 --> 00:01:21,584
having a sort-of moustache.

39
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:23,620
I could totally
get a date in a week.

40
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,704
Totally.

41
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:26,673
Piece of cake.

42
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:28,541
<i>You're dead.</i>

43
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:30,426
I'm dead.

44
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:14,687
Hello!

45
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:19,102
Please don't let my horrible,
elderly face frighten you!

46
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:22,889
Don't you want to use that nickel
to get a nugget from old Goldie?

47
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:25,892
Watch this!

48
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,296
Okay, seriously, Mr. Pines,
it's time to throw that thing out.

49
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:49,166
Its face reminds everyone
of the inevitability of death.

50
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:50,884
What?

51
00:02:50,918 --> 00:02:52,886
Sure, he's a little rusty
around the edges,

52
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,256
but old Goldie's
a classic show-stopper like me!

53
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,974
Oh, kill it!

54
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:00,093
Kill it!

55
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:06,266
Huh, a woman!

56
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,271
All right, Soos,
you could do this.

57
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:15,158
Just use your mouth to say words
that makes romance happen.

58
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:18,161
Your face is good.

59
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:19,863
I'm a Soos!

60
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:28,088
Soos?
What was that all about?

61
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:30,040
I-- I think I was flirting!

62
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:31,958
But I'm not sure.

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,293
Did someone say flirting?

64
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:35,128
Well, I sort of
promised my grandma

65
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:36,963
I'd get a date
by the end of the week.

66
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:39,299
But I've never actually
been on a date before.

67
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,885
You belong on me,
out of order sign.

68
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:44,971
Finally, my prayers
for a chance

69
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:47,974
to match-make this summer
have been answered!

70
00:03:47,976 --> 00:03:50,894
Soos, a little advice:
you need to get rich.

71
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,312
Or lie about being rich.

72
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:54,231
Outside of that,
I don't like your chances.

73
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,316
Don't listen to Stan, dude.

74
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:59,069
You're a sweet guy with a
steady job and a pickup truck.

75
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,153
Would you date him?

76
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:02,872
Oh...
Would you look at that...

77
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,909
Soos, you help us so much,
it's time we help you, dude.

78
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,160
We're gonna get you that date.

79
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:11,164
We're taking you where romance
lives and fashion styles die.

80
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,832
To the mall!

81
00:04:14,335 --> 00:04:17,003
I'm gonna go find a replacement
for old Goldie.

82
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:18,988
Babysit Soos while I'm gone.

83
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,258
All right, Soos,

84
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:23,176
are you ready to explode
a charm bomb

85
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:25,228
on these poor,
unsuspecting ladies?

86
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,181
Ah, but what if
I embarrass myself again?

87
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:30,567
Ah, you can't be any worse
at this than Dipper.

88
00:04:30,618 --> 00:04:32,269
Yeah!
Wait... What?

89
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:35,021
And flirt!

90
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,525
Eye contact!

91
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:42,028
Hey there! I'm not scared
of your eyes at all!

92
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,246
I'm gonna look at them!

93
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,032
Eye contact.

94
00:04:46,034 --> 00:04:47,917
Conversation!

95
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:50,337
You know I've actually
been in a pig's body.

96
00:04:50,371 --> 00:04:53,289
Did you know pigs have a
hard time walking backwards?

97
00:04:53,324 --> 00:04:55,208
Not you though!
Not that I'm calling you a pig.

98
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,609
Where are you going?

99
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:58,144
Confidence!

100
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:02,849
So you're probably a girl,
right?

101
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:03,883
Wrong?

102
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,718
No, I was right
the first time.

103
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:08,054
Wrong?

104
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:14,027
Tossing away garbage
in the garbage can, whew!

105
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:17,197
Ah, don't look at me like that!

106
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:18,865
This is how it's got to be!

107
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
What in the--

108
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,996
What is this living nightmare?

109
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,531
Why do kids love it so much?

110
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:39,202
Who wants to get badgered?

111
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,888
Oh, yeah,
that's Will E. Badger.

112
00:05:41,922 --> 00:05:43,923
He opens for Hoo-Ha
and the Jamboree.

113
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,144
It's Will E. Badger.
I love you, Will E.

114
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:51,231
Now, give me your money!

115
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:53,016
Take my money!
Take it all!

116
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,934
Oh!

117
00:05:54,985 --> 00:05:57,937
Sir, I would like
to buy that badger.

118
00:05:57,988 --> 00:05:59,189
You're in over your head,
gramps!

119
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,457
Animatronics is
a young man's game!

120
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,978
You couldn't handle the hardcore
life of the pizza robot manager.

121
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,996
Huh.

122
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:07,997
Flinched!

123
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:13,169
Hey, you, barfing in the ball pit,
Gary's on the case!

124
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:15,872
I'm gonna get that badger!

125
00:06:17,258 --> 00:06:18,208
Don't worry, Soos.

126
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,261
You will find the right girl,
you just need to stick with it.

127
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,216
Ah, could this day
get any worse?

128
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:28,885
Oh, no, cousin Reggie!

129
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:31,221
Feel it, it's muscle.

130
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:32,856
He can't see me like this!

131
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:33,890
I got to hide!

132
00:06:39,313 --> 00:06:42,315
This is it, Soos.
A lifetime of loneliness.

133
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:44,200
You're the only ones
who could love me...

134
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:46,986
Fighty Hogg,
Dr. Punch Head MD.

135
00:06:47,988 --> 00:06:49,906
Huh.

136
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:51,207
Never seen that one before.

137
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:54,043
"Virtually improve
your dating skills,

138
00:06:54,078 --> 00:06:55,962
9 out of 10 basement dwellers
recommend!"

139
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:57,330
This is perfect!

140
00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,999
Well, I guess you are better
at games than at flirting.

141
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,001
Anything to get you
out there, Soos!

142
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:04,254
I'm not sure you want
to buy that game, sir.

143
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:06,305
This is the third time
someone's brought that back.

144
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:09,926
And there's a note on it
that says destroy at all costs.

145
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:12,095
So, hey, there.
What's your deal?

146
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:13,897
Like the--
oh, she's dead.

147
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,181
We'll take our chances.

148
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:24,490
Man, I can't wait
for the year 2000.

149
00:07:26,193 --> 00:07:28,194
Uh-- start!

150
00:07:30,114 --> 00:07:33,917
When the cherry petals of magic
romance academy are in bloom...

151
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:35,285
Anthyding can hadplen.

152
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:37,036
That is so true.

153
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:39,088
<i>Oh, hi there.</i>

154
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:40,924
<i>My name is Giffany,</i>

155
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,209
<i>I'm a school girl
at school university,</i>

156
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,879
<i>will you help me
carry my books?</i>

157
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:47,931
I'm really feeling
number two here.

158
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:49,098
Click!

159
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,266
Ah.
I messed up.

160
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,301
<i>That's okay.</i>

161
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:53,102
<i>Try again.</i>

162
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:56,940
Wow!
I'm learning.

163
00:07:56,974 --> 00:07:59,058
And games are making it fun.

164
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:01,194
<i>What would you like
to talk about?</i>

165
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:03,446
I'd rather just
click your face.

166
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:07,116
<i>You are so funny!</i>

167
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:08,902
Man, this game is amazing.

168
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:10,787
I don't know
why anyone abandoned it.

169
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:14,157
<i>And I'm sure, you'll never
abandon me, new boy friend.</i>

170
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,158
Boy friend?

171
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,912
Oh, my Giffany, it's almost
like you're actually alive!

172
00:08:18,963 --> 00:08:20,797
<i>Yes, almost.</i>

173
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,170
Oh, man, you have
such a nice laugh.

174
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
You don't understand, Wendy.

175
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,137
This animatronic badger sings,
it dances.

176
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:36,189
It's the perfect
money taking attraction

177
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,891
but he won't sell it to me.

178
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:40,226
This is literally too dumb
for me to care about.

179
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:42,111
Hey, have you guys seen Soos?

180
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,197
We're supposed to help him
with matchmaking today.

181
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:48,067
Yeah! I wore my motivational
sweater and everything.

182
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,068
I messed up that part.

183
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,904
He didn't come in today.

184
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,906
It's the first time
he's missed work ever.

185
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,080
So that's basically
my entire life story.

186
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,999
Now you tell me
a thing about you.

187
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,753
<i>Every time you compliment me,
I get another highlight in my eyes.</i>

188
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,971
Ah, you're pretty.

189
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,889
And pixelly.

190
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:10,924
And so agreeable.

191
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,227
Yes.

192
00:09:14,261 --> 00:09:15,929
Uh, Soos.

193
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,764
Oh, hi, dudes, come in.

194
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:18,932
This game is amazing.

195
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,234
I'm making eye contact,
going on dates

196
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:25,071
and I haven't seen any natural
sunlight for 13 hours.

197
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:29,158
Soos, maybe it's time to apply
these skills with real girls.

198
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,077
But, I'm about to meet her
parents!

199
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:34,247
Her dad is an octopus man.

200
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,034
We're going back
to the mall, man.

201
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,836
You need to unplug!

202
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,955
I'll see you later, Giffany.

203
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,007
I'll be back, I swear.

204
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,042
Soos, you don't have
to wish her goodbye.

205
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:47,794
It's just a game!

206
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,846
It's not like
it's going anywhere.

207
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,883
<i>Yes, it's not like
I'm going anywhere.</i>

208
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:00,807
Hello?

209
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,809
Time to read Soos's diary.

210
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,029
Dang!

211
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,814
Where all of them
sweet honeys at?

212
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:09,949
I'll check
the ladies bathroom!

213
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,150
It's love time, girls!

214
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:12,201
Get out there!

215
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,953
No time to wash your hands!

216
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,121
Get out of here.

217
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,206
It's time to date, date, date.

218
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,042
And here comes security.

219
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,293
I'll deal with this.

220
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:22,295
Stay here and practice
on some real girls.

221
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:30,003
These girls have
so many dimensions

222
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,221
and no explanationy menus.

223
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,140
Ah, my purse.

224
00:10:34,174 --> 00:10:35,141
Oh, no!

225
00:10:35,175 --> 00:10:36,309
Undo! Undo!

226
00:10:36,343 --> 00:10:39,312
You can't undo who you are.

227
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,985
Oh, man, this is the worst.

228
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,236
I wish I was back home with...

229
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,022
<i>Hi, Soos.</i>

230
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,239
Giffany!

231
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,325
Oh, man, I am so relieved
to see you!

232
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,243
Although, sort of confused.

233
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:58,031
<i>Oh, Soos,
I am not an ordinary game!</i>

234
00:10:58,082 --> 00:11:00,867
<i>I am special.</i>

235
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:04,170
<i>The programmers
tried to delete me.</i>

236
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,873
<i>So I had to delete them.</i>

237
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,094
What did you do to them?

238
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,879
<i>That's not important.</i>

239
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,213
<i>What's important is</i>

240
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:17,050
<i>you don't have to talk
to real girls ever again.</i>

241
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:18,851
<i>You and me can be together...</i>

242
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,038
<i>Forever!</i>

243
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:23,222
Wow, that's awesome!

244
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,891
Sort of a red flag.

245
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,059
But mostly awesome!

246
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,894
So what do you want to do now?

247
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,946
<i>Anything you want, Soos.</i>

248
00:11:32,116 --> 00:11:33,199
Choo-choo.

249
00:11:36,236 --> 00:11:39,038
<i>Please insert
50 cents to continue.</i>

250
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,824
Aw, man!

251
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,077
Oh, I'm sorry.

252
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,162
Dude, that's awesome
that you're a grown man

253
00:11:46,213 --> 00:11:47,964
riding a little train
like that.

254
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,216
- You're totally like owning it.
- Huh?

255
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,836
Oh, yeah, I'm like,
if it's fun, do it.

256
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,922
- You know?
- Exactly!

257
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:57,256
Being an adult is the worst!

258
00:11:57,307 --> 00:12:00,093
Skewering meat,
remembering to pay bills.

259
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,095
I just want to ride
tiny trains all day.

260
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,097
At least you get to work
at Meat Cute,

261
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:06,265
extreme lunch meats
are the food of the future.

262
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,017
I feel the same way.

263
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,269
- I'm Melody by the way.
- I'm Soos!

264
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,271
I tell you,
if you like robots for kids,

265
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,774
you should check out the
best restaurant of all time.

266
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:15,825
You mean...

267
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:18,111
Hoo-Ha Owl's
Pizzamatronic Jamboree.

268
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,195
What?

269
00:12:19,246 --> 00:12:20,863
You've heard of Hoo-Ha owl's?

270
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,782
I loved that place
when I was a kid!

271
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,167
Oh, yeah, dude,
there's one right in this mall!

272
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,952
I should show you sometime.

273
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,837
I'm free around eight?

274
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:28,921
Boom.
Done.

275
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,006
Perfect.

276
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,290
I'll see you then.

277
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:39,966
What a nice lady.

278
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:42,218
Well, back to riding this
tiny train for children.

279
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:45,138
Soos!

280
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:48,307
We saw the whole thing, Soos.
That was amazing!

281
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,109
You talked to a real girl.

282
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,944
- And you got a date!
- I did?

283
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,062
Ah!
Ah!

284
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:55,198
This is the best day of my life!

285
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,233
You were in the zone,
you made eye contact.

286
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:59,986
It was like you'd done this
a million times before!

287
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:01,037
Don't you see?

288
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,155
That game really worked!

289
00:13:02,206 --> 00:13:03,790
You don't need it anymore!

290
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,992
- You can toss it out!
- Toss it?

291
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:08,795
But I like Giffany!
She's good to me!

292
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,962
She's predictable!

293
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:14,167
Soos, can a computer game go to
Reggie's engagement party with you?

294
00:13:14,218 --> 00:13:15,968
Uh...

295
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,888
Hey, Giffany, we got to talk.

296
00:13:18,922 --> 00:13:22,175
<i>Of course, I'm programmed to find
everything you say interesting.</i>

297
00:13:22,226 --> 00:13:25,261
Well, have you ever had to choose
between two things you like,

298
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,013
but you don't know
which one is right for you?

299
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,899
I mean,
I'm just thinking long term.

300
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:34,153
Maybe I should be with someone a
little less beep-boop, you know.

301
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,855
<i>I don't think you know
what you are saying, Soos.</i>

302
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:37,190
<i>No one loves you more than me.</i>

303
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:39,242
<i>The girls out there
will just make fun of you.</i>

304
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,077
You really think so?

305
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,195
<i>I know so.</i>

306
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:44,030
<i>Besides, we had a deal.</i>

307
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:47,867
<i>You bought my game, you held my
books, you are my boyfriend.</i>

308
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:49,252
<i>Now sit down in that chair.</i>

309
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,204
I don't think I like the way
you are acting.

310
00:13:51,255 --> 00:13:53,956
<i>I won't let another girl
take you away from me, Soos!</i>

311
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,208
Giffany, calm down.

312
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,009
<i>You are mine, Soos!</i>

313
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,044
Pause.

314
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,883
Oh, that got intense.

315
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,967
I'm sorry, Giffany.

316
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:08,805
Maybe having a cursed robo
girlfriend wasn't a good idea.

317
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:10,323
I'm taking you back
to the video game store

318
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:11,908
after my date with Melody.

319
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,842
Hello, old friends.

320
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:25,911
I've got to be careful
this time.

321
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:27,913
No more Colombian nights.

322
00:14:27,964 --> 00:14:31,883
All right, Stan, this is weird
even for you, you need to talk?

323
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,919
Nothing you could say
will change my mind, Wendy.

324
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,589
Sometimes, a man has to steal
an animatronic badger

325
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:39,841
to stay in this crazy game
called life.

326
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:41,760
Or you could just not care.

327
00:14:41,811 --> 00:14:43,512
It's about the principle.

328
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:45,730
No one tells Stan Pines
he is out of the game.

329
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:46,848
No one tells--

330
00:14:48,818 --> 00:14:50,735
I'll get your
orthopedic back pillow.

331
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,770
Thank you!

332
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:54,539
You can do this, Soos.

333
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:56,691
Just remember
what your love crew taught you!

334
00:14:56,742 --> 00:14:58,777
- How does she look?
- Nice!

335
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,446
- What are her stories?
- Interesting!

336
00:15:01,448 --> 00:15:04,583
- And who's gonna pay for dinner?
- Soos is!

337
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,918
Now date!

338
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:10,805
They grow up so fast.

339
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,724
Itchy legs, itchy legs.

340
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:13,792
Oh, hi, Soos.

341
00:15:13,794 --> 00:15:14,926
Melody!

342
00:15:14,961 --> 00:15:19,798
Are you ready
for a date with me?

343
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:22,801
I totally am.

344
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:26,638
Good show, man.

345
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:27,939
Way to warm them up!

346
00:15:27,974 --> 00:15:29,641
I wish I was more like you.

347
00:15:34,614 --> 00:15:35,730
Man, I could go for some

348
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:38,783
complimentary bread
sticks right now.

349
00:15:38,818 --> 00:15:40,619
One time I was so hungry

350
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:43,822
I ate the decorational bamboo
in a Chinese restaurant.

351
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:45,907
Like a big old panda.

352
00:15:47,793 --> 00:15:49,544
You're hilarious.

353
00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:53,832
Well, you know, I just sort of
say whatever pops into my--

354
00:16:01,507 --> 00:16:02,641
Soos, are you okay?

355
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:04,643
- No, I'm fine.
- Everything's fine.

356
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:05,677
Are you sure?

357
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:07,512
You are spitting an awful lot.

358
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:10,599
Uh, could you sit tight?

359
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:12,684
I have go to the bathroom
for a long time.

360
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:14,653
Not in a weird way.

361
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:17,906
Soos!
What are you doing out there?

362
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,525
I got a big problem, guys,
I am being stalked by Giffany.

363
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:21,693
Giffany?

364
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:23,528
Or maybe
it's pronounced Giffany.

365
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,914
- I was never really sure.
- Soos, get a grip on yourself.

366
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,750
Giffany can't stalk you
because she is not real.

367
00:16:33,923 --> 00:16:34,923
Uh-oh.

368
00:16:34,957 --> 00:16:36,708
Take it from someone
who brought

369
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,927
an arcade game to life.
This will not end well.

370
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:41,846
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure
she is stuck on TV screens.

371
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:47,852
<i>Ah, a new challenger approaches,
prepare to be--</i>

372
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:53,558
Oh, boy.

373
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,694
So hey! Anyway, you want to move
this date into the forest

374
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,646
far away from all electronics
and people?

375
00:16:57,697 --> 00:17:00,398
What? But the floor show's
about to start!

376
00:17:09,492 --> 00:17:11,826
Who wants to hear
Hoo-Ha the owl!

377
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:19,718
Hello, friends,
Hoo-Ha the owl is dead.

378
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:25,674
This next song goes out to my
forever boyfriend, Soos.

379
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:28,593
- Soos, what's going on?
- No time to explain!

380
00:17:28,595 --> 00:17:29,944
We got to get out of here!

381
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:35,934
The only way out, Soos,
is in my arms.

382
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:37,519
Capture them!

383
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:44,943
Done!

384
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:46,745
Out with the old,
in with the new!

385
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,530
I feel invincible.

386
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,615
Ah!

387
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:51,866
What--
what the--

388
00:17:51,917 --> 00:17:55,920
Who wants to get badgered?

389
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,592
Sorry, Soos.

390
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:03,762
But you can't run away
from our relationship.

391
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,636
So about all this,

392
00:18:11,687 --> 00:18:13,471
I may have purchased
a dating simulator

393
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,473
that attained sentience
and went crazy.

394
00:18:15,524 --> 00:18:16,641
Oh, I am crazy.

395
00:18:16,726 --> 00:18:19,527
Crazy for you, Soos.

396
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:21,646
Ah!

397
00:18:21,697 --> 00:18:22,897
Oh, no.

398
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:24,816
Oh, I'm so sorry, Melody!
I'll fix this!

399
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,651
It's me that she wants.

400
00:18:26,702 --> 00:18:28,862
I'll distract her while
Dipper and Mabel keep you safe.

401
00:18:28,871 --> 00:18:30,705
It's the only way.

402
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,574
Soos, these are children.

403
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,659
The only way!

404
00:18:36,579 --> 00:18:38,546
- Over here, Giffany!
- Stop!

405
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,470
On three, we split.

406
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:47,305
One, two-

407
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,810
Stay back, you monster!

408
00:18:51,844 --> 00:18:53,561
Ah!

409
00:19:02,655 --> 00:19:05,490
Yes, yes, get him, Goldie,
get him.

410
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:14,499
I'm gonna eat your face
like pizza.

411
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:29,681
I have got you surrounded, Soos.
There is no way out.

412
00:19:29,715 --> 00:19:31,516
Please, let my friends go.

413
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,551
I'll do anything you want.
I promise.

414
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:38,890
I seem to remember someone
promising he will be my boyfriend.

415
00:19:38,941 --> 00:19:44,779
<i>Think about it, real girls are
unpredictable, they judge you.</i>

416
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:47,782
<i>You really think Melody
is going to take you back</i>

417
00:19:47,817 --> 00:19:49,901
<i>after this awful date?</i>

418
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:54,906
I can download your brain
into the game with me

419
00:19:54,957 --> 00:19:57,659
and we will be together
forever.

420
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,660
Ah!

421
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:01,496
Stay back.

422
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:02,664
Come on, Soos.

423
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:05,917
Don't make me
to leave you, too.

424
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,585
What do you say?

425
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,805
I say, game over, Giffany!

426
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:13,641
No!
Wait!

427
00:20:33,996 --> 00:20:35,496
You did it!

428
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:37,866
You old, beautiful monster!
You did it!

429
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,834
How's about you and me
hit the town?

430
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:42,620
These old has-beens
are going to Vegas!

431
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,544
I'm sorry for all this.

432
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:52,547
I honestly remember this place being
a lot more fun when I was a kid.

433
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:54,716
Believe it or not,
I've been on worse dates.

434
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:56,851
- Really?
- Never date a magician.

435
00:20:56,886 --> 00:20:59,520
Ew!
Why would I?

436
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:01,522
Oh, hey, you wouldn't maybe
be interested

437
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:03,775
in coming to my cousin's
engagement party in a week?

438
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,644
I promise there is like
zero robot badgers.

439
00:21:06,695 --> 00:21:08,813
Yeah, I'll still be
in town then.

440
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:10,648
Still be in town?

441
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,700
I'm going back home to Portland
in a few weeks

442
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:15,486
but we can video chat,
if that's okay with you?

443
00:21:15,488 --> 00:21:18,656
A relationship with a girl that I
can only see through my computer,

444
00:21:18,658 --> 00:21:21,492
sounds perfect.

445
00:21:21,494 --> 00:21:24,629
Spirit of love, we did it.

446
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:26,881
Yes, yes, I'm so happy.

447
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,967
Have you been
following us all day?

448
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:31,669
Soos's life is my soap opera.
