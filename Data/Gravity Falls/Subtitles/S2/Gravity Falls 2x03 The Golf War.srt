00:00:06,289 --> 00:00:08,824
Who wants Stan-cakes?

2
00:00:08,826 --> 00:00:11,793
They're like pancakes, but they
probably have some of my hair in 'em.

3
00:00:11,795 --> 00:00:12,694
Pass.

4
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:16,298
It's here! Oh, it's here! It's here!
It's here! It's here!

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,666
I've been waiting all morning

6
00:00:17,668 --> 00:00:19,201

"Pacifica Northwest declares
V-necks the look of the season."

12
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:32,414
What am I looking at here?

13
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:33,682
Wha-wha-what?

14
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:38,754
Looks like someone bought
their way to the front page.

15
00:00:38,756 --> 00:00:41,123
Is it legal for a child
to wear that much make-up?

16
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,891
Ugh. Pacifica.

17
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:44,726
She always ruins everything.

18
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:46,128
Aww, cheer up, Mabel.

19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,890
I mean, no one even reads
newspapers anymore.

20
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:48,931
Dudes!

21
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:51,266
V-neck season is upon us!

22
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,308
Who wants to help me get
ahead of the fashion curve?

23
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,643
I'm taking it one step further

24
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:57,072
with the W-neck!

25
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:59,474

my mind off this.

Hey, Mabel,
you love mini-golf!

36
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,867
She's been amazing at it
since we were kids.

37
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:27,135
What do you say, Mabel?

38
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:28,577
We've had a stressful
couple of days.

39
00:01:28,602 --> 00:01:29,938
How about
we take a break, huh?

40
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,441
Would kicking all our butts
at mini-golf cheer you up?

41
00:01:32,443 --> 00:01:33,475
Maybe a little.

Ah, Mini-Golf.
The sport of mini-champions.

51
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,209

but the fun is real.

61
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,012
Yes!

62
00:03:17,014 --> 00:03:18,280

If Mabel gets
a hole-in-one here,

71
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:42,371

Ah, don't worry about it, kid.
The thing's random.

75
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,462
Yeah, besides
the Bermuda's Triangle,

76
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:09,998
how mini golf works
is the world's greatest mystery.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,366
As far as I'm concerned,

78
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:14,469
you're still better than
anyone else in Gravity--

79
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:17,472
Oh, would you look at that?

80
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:20,041
I didn't know it was
"hobos golf free" day.

81
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:22,444
Pacifica!

82
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:24,513
Well, if it isn't
the Pines family.

83
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,983
Fat, old, lame, braces.

84
00:04:27,985 --> 00:04:30,552
Soos, would it be wrong
to punch a child?

85
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:31,386
I've got this.

86
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:34,556
Hey, Pacifica, how's that whole
your-family-being-frauds thing

87
00:04:34,558 --> 00:04:35,557
working out for you?

88
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,058
Great, actually.

89
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,326
That's the thing about money.

90
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,195
It makes problems go away.

91
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,197
Well, can't buy you skill.

92
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,666
You walked into the game
of the mini golf champion.

93
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:47,035
Sergei!

94
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,670
This is Sergei, my trainer.

95
00:04:48,672 --> 00:04:51,139
The Sportlympics had
mini golf once.

96
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:52,374
I took gold!

97
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:55,410
So if you don't mind moving out of
the way of the professionals...

98
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,323
Enjoy second place.
Give her a hand, folks!

99
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:11,493
Oh, yeah?

100
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:15,464
Well, I want a rematch,
you-- you--

101
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:19,167
walking one dimensional bleached
blonde valley girl stereotype!

102
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,605
Like, let's do this.

103
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,177
Hear ye! Hear ye!

104
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:31,246
Honk! Honk! Ow!

105
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,017
Stop at once!

106
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:38,119
The park is now closed
due to weather.

107
00:05:38,121 --> 00:05:40,722
The King of Mini Golf
has spoken.

108
00:05:40,724 --> 00:05:42,557
Oh, the King is down!

109
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:46,495
This isn't over.
You. Me. Midnight.

110
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,330
We'll see who's best.

111
00:05:48,332 --> 00:05:49,331
I'll be here.

112
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,672
I'll be here.

113
00:05:57,674 --> 00:06:00,742
Peh, peh!
Hair in my mouth. Peh!

114
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,358
Time to scratch mini golf off
my talents list.

115
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,692
Aww, don't give up, Mabel.

116
00:06:17,694 --> 00:06:21,229
Yeah, if you beat her at this, she
could never rag on you again.

117
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,297
Imagine it.

118
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,468
Um, the section for ugly
grandma clothes is over there.

119
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,636
Oh, yeah?

120
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:31,740
Well, the section for people who
lost at mini golf is over there!

121
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,677
We came as fast as we could.

122
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,113
We heard a little girl
got seriously burned!

123
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:39,581
Oh!

124
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,616
I'm ruined!

125
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:42,617
Up top!

126
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,618
Yay!

127
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,555
You're right, guys.

128
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:48,677
I just need to practice
a little more before midnight.

129
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:51,459
Go to the golf course
after dark, you say?

130
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:53,528
I don't know.
We'd have to break in and--

131
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,230
Just kidding!
Let's break in!

132
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:06,708
Oh, and, hey, Mabel!

133
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,647
Knock her dead, kid.

134
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,557
Darn!
Poo-peck-darn!

135
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,359
Ugh!
I don't get it!

136
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,860
What is wrong with this hole?

137
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,533
Did you hear that?

138
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,667
What?
What is it?

139
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,103
Grab your club.

140
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:04,265
We good?
We good?

141
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,106
Allright then!

142
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:10,472
Hi! Hello! I'm Franz.
And welcome to our home.

143
00:08:10,474 --> 00:08:11,573
What is this?

144
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,174
Yeah.

145
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:16,578
Are you guys tiny humans?
Or enormous mini-humans?

146
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,913
Neither.
We're lilli-putt-tians!

147
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,515
Lilli-- Lilli-putt...

148
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:22,477
The name makes more sense
written out than spoken.

149
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,636
And we control the balls!
Behold!

150
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:35,864
Wow!

151
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,577
That's incredible!

152
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:51,546
And so needlessly complicated.

153
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:52,781
Aw, shucks.

154
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,549
It's only our
life-long passion!

155
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,785
Would you like us
to elaborate through song?

156
00:08:58,822 --> 00:08:59,821
Nah, we're good.

157
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,193
So what are you hugelings
doing here anyway?

158
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:06,961
We kind of have to play
this golf tournament

159
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,197
against my rival, Pacifica.

160
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:10,732
Oh, rivals.
Rivals, rivals.

161
00:09:10,734 --> 00:09:13,535
Oh, we know all about rivals.

162
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,770
Put a clog in it,
ya windmill lubbers!

163
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,510
These really bottom popinjays are
terrible at controlling the balls!

164
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:25,447
We are the ball masters, says I!

165
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:29,718
Shut your mouths,
you showboating pirates!

166
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,687
Everyone knows the Eiffel
Tower hole is the best!

167
00:09:34,924 --> 00:09:38,660
Stay thee your comments,
ye scurrilous Frenchmen!

168
00:09:40,262 --> 00:09:43,331
None controllable is better
than the knights of...

169
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,233
Wiener castle.

170
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,468
Who wrote this?

171
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,710
We'll settle
which hole is best!

172
00:09:47,735 --> 00:09:48,603
Attack!

173
00:09:48,605 --> 00:09:49,637
Charge!

174
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,906
Ooh, I'm shiverin'
in me timbers.

175
00:09:51,908 --> 00:09:53,007
Get ready to die!

176
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:56,778
Long live the mini king!

177
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,681
Die, you evil scum!

178
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:00,749
Ow!

179
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:01,783
Yarr!

180
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:10,825
These guys are a riot.

181
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,628
Guys, guys, calm down.

182
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,564
Your fighting is
inadvertently adorable.

183
00:10:16,566 --> 00:10:19,734
Adorable we are, hugeling,
but our tale, less so.

184
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:22,370
Every hole in the park thinks
that it's superior.

185
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,974
From the cowboys in the east to
the grimy minors of the south.

186
00:10:25,976 --> 00:10:29,511
If only there was some way
to decide which side is best

187
00:10:29,513 --> 00:10:31,546
with maybe an award or,
like a trophy.

188
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,547
I don't know.

189
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,616
But, Franz, look!

190
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:40,522
The sticker.
The sticker could decide!

191
00:10:40,524 --> 00:10:42,590
It does say "the best" on it.

192
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:43,958
Decide for us, hugeling.

193
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,496
Choose which mini kingdom to give
the sticker to and end our war!

194
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:50,565
Uh,

195
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,833
I don't know, guys.

196
00:10:51,835 --> 00:10:56,304
I'm not sure I want to get involved
in your weird mini blood feud.

197
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:57,372
Psst!

198
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:58,573
Mabel, this is perfect.

199
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,775
These guys control the course.

200
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,609
Just tell them
you'll give the sticker

201
00:11:01,611 --> 00:11:04,312
to whichever group does
a better job of helping us win.

202
00:11:04,314 --> 00:11:05,680
I'm not sure, Dipper.

203
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:09,651
I want to beat Pacifica, but
doesn't this seem like cheating?

204
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:13,688
Pacifica's rich, Mabel.
She's cheating at life.

205
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,757
Hmm.

206
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,959
Thanks, man.

207
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,661
People of the 18 holes!

208
00:11:19,663 --> 00:11:21,863
We're going to have
a game of mini-golf!

209
00:11:21,865 --> 00:11:25,967
And whoever does the best job
helping me win gets the sticker!

210
00:11:25,969 --> 00:11:28,903
It'll be us, lass,
not these tulip munchers.

211
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,672
I will not be insulted

212
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:33,608
by a man with no depth
perception wearing earrings.

213
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,111
Just remember, as long as
you're helping me, no fighting.

214
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,618
Dude, I'm cutting
"W" s into all my shirts.

215
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,100
Got to give the public
what they want.

216
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,821
Well, the kids
are taking their time.

217
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,623
Looks like
it's gonna be a while.

218
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,535
Sure are a lot of stars
out tonight.

219
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:02,203
Well, this is gettin' weird.

220
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:07,909
Now remember, Pacifica,
winning is everything.

221
00:12:07,911 --> 00:12:10,612
Oh, oh, and also looks.
Winning and looks.

222
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,981
Dad, I've been practicing for,
like, a millions hours, okay?

223
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,449
I've got this.

224
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,450
You'll stay to watch, right?

225
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,852
Pacifica, darling.
We have a party to go to.

226
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:19,821
We'll just read about
your victory in the paper.

227
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,023
Sergei!

228
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,395
Oh, and whatever happens,
just remember one thing.

229
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:28,563
You're a Northwest.

230
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,031
Don't lose.

231
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,003
How much do you want to bet
they're no shows?

232
00:12:37,172 --> 00:12:38,673
Looking for someone?

233
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,909
Waiting in the dark,
not creepy at all.

234
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,176
Seriously, though?

235
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,678
I don't know
why you bothered to come.

236
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,679
Unless you've got something up your sleeve.

237
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,583
Oh, I guess you could say
we've got a little something.

238
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,084
Right? Right?

239
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:56,057
Eighteen holes.
Standard rules.

240
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,460
Winner lives in glory.
Loser wallows in eternal shame.

241
00:12:59,462 --> 00:13:03,197
On your mark,
get set, Mini golf!

242
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:17,946
What?

243
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,448
Yeehaw!

244
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,591
Out of my way!

245
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,464
Are you serious?

246
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:40,935
Yarr, I say!

247
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,642
Miner hole.

248
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:50,078
I wonder what cute silly things
are going on down there.

249
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:56,751
You can't go in there!
There's been a gas leak.

250
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,587
Anyone who goes in there
will die!

251
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,324
I will take it.

252
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,625
No!

253
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:07,195
Don't go, Big Henry!
We need you!

254
00:14:07,197 --> 00:14:08,963
Go home, Polly.

255
00:14:15,971 --> 00:14:17,672
Ahem.

256
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:22,944
Come on, Big Henry.
You can do this.

257
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,764
Aah! No!

258
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,633
Sergei! Soda! Now!

259
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:50,605
Okay, guys,
that was badonkulous!

260
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,087
Hey, hey.
Little high fives, everyone.

261
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,355
Little high fives all around.

262
00:14:53,357 --> 00:14:55,610
Nice one. You did it.
You're the man!

263
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:56,932
I don't want to
call it out early,

264
00:14:56,957 --> 00:15:01,215
but I think the Miners might have
one of these in their future.

265
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,854
Are you kidding me?

266
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:08,723
After everything
we've worked for?

267
00:15:08,725 --> 00:15:10,224
Calm yourself, Franz.

268
00:15:10,226 --> 00:15:12,894
There may be another way
to win the hugelings' favor.

269
00:15:12,896 --> 00:15:13,961
Knock on wood.

270
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,600
There's something going on,
Sergei.

271
00:15:19,601 --> 00:15:20,601
I can feel it.

272
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:23,738
Maybe they has little people
who control where the balls go.

273
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,107
We got to get you
English lessons.

274
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:27,829
I mean, think about it.
I'm globally ranked.

275
00:15:27,854 --> 00:15:29,421
It's ridiculous that
she's beating me.

276
00:15:31,146 --> 00:15:34,582
Ugh, Pitt Cola.
I always forget about the pit.

277
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:37,285
Get me a different one,
Sergei.

278
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:38,319
Huh?

279
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,500
This is bad.

280
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,727
I can't wait to see the look on
Pacifica's face when we win.

281
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:47,969
I'm thinking it will be like...

282
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,631
You know how she does that?

283
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:53,935
Dipper, is it bad that I feel
good about her feeling bad?

284
00:15:53,937 --> 00:15:56,070
Just enjoy your victory,
Mabel.

285
00:15:56,072 --> 00:15:58,339
Trust me,
Pacifica will be fine.

286
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:03,377
What's going on here?
Let me go!

287
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:07,348
What did I miss?

288
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:10,751
Let me go, you creeps!

289
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,620
Welcome, twins!
Welcome!

290
00:16:12,622 --> 00:16:14,062
I can tell
you're loving this, right?

291
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:15,690
Right? No?

292
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:16,924
What are you guys doing?

293
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,960
This wasn't part of the deal,
tiny Dutchman!

294
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:22,930
Okay, so we saw you were favoring
the Miners and we figured,

295
00:16:22,932 --> 00:16:24,899
what's better than
beating Pacifica?

296
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:26,200
Pfft!

297
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,668
Killing her, right?

298
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,171
As if.
I'm calling my parents.

299
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,305
Where is my phone?

300
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:33,374
Send.

301
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:34,909
Hey, hey!

302
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,411
So how about it, hugeling?
Who's the best now?

303
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,982
Not so fast, landlubbers!

304
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:43,417
If you're going to
play dirty, so are we.

305
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,754
Now give us the sticker
or he walks the plank.

306
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:47,955
No, give us the sticker!

307
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:49,557
The Miners!
The sticker's for the Miners!

308
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:52,260
Give it to us!
Give it to us!

309
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,895
Remember Big Henry!

310
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:54,962
Enough!

311
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,134
You know what?
No one gets the sticker!

312
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:04,205
No. No. Nuh-uh.

313
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:06,307
No booing.
Stop. No.

314
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:09,277
No one gets the sticker
'cause you're all being jerks.

315
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,379
I mean,
why can't you just get along?

316
00:17:11,381 --> 00:17:13,781
Because we hate each other.

317
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:16,417
That's kinda
how rivalries work, lass.

318
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:17,785
Well then maybe...

319
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,354
Maybe rivalries are dumb.

320
00:17:20,356 --> 00:17:23,291
Maybe you don't settle them
with petty competitions.

321
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:27,728
Maybe the only way to be "the
best" is by ending the fighting

322
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,896
and working together!

323
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,070
It's all so clear.

324
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,339
If we work together...

325
00:17:38,341 --> 00:17:41,776
Then we can cut open her belly
and get the sticker.

326
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:44,412
Get the girl!
Slice her open!

327
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,749
You guys aren't appreciating
the lesson here!

328
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,052
Sticker!
Sticker! Sticker!

329
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:56,891
Help!

330
00:17:57,893 --> 00:17:59,193
We've got to get out of here!

331
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,529
I have to save Pacifica first!

332
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,842
After her!

333
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,811
<i>Ah, Mr. Dipper!
Nyet! Nyet!</i>

334
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:19,113
Don't freak out, man!
The water's shallow!

335
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,082
There is literally
no way to drown.

336
00:18:24,052 --> 00:18:25,186
Seriously?

337
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,856
Ugh, took you long enough.
And watch the earrings!

338
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,324
They're worth
more than your house!

339
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:33,127
You know, on second thought,
maybe I won't untie you.

340
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:34,762
Untie me!
Untie me!

341
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:36,197
That's what I thought.

342
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:39,834
We have you
on miniature pencilpoint.

343
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:41,435
There's no way around us.

344
00:18:41,437 --> 00:18:42,937
You ready to putt?

345
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:44,272
Way ahead of you.

346
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:47,008
Huh?

347
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,978
Hey, you're actually
not that terrible.

348
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,979
A little rusty, but...

349
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:53,514
Just shut up and putt!

350
00:18:56,952 --> 00:18:58,286
Get on! Get on!

351
00:18:58,288 --> 00:18:59,387
Gun it!

352
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,990
Don't let them escape!

353
00:19:15,971 --> 00:19:17,938
Sergei overboard!

354
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,173
I'll get a new one.

355
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,076
They're shutting us in!

356
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:27,982
Don't even think about it.

357
00:19:27,984 --> 00:19:29,417
You call yourself a golfer?

358
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,553
Without us, that club
is useless in your hands.

359
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:35,589
Oh yeah?
What's ten minus six?

360
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,924
Ten-- Hang on.

361
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,159
Fore!

362
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:55,276
Stay out, you dumb hugelings!

363
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,912
We're done with you.

364
00:19:57,914 --> 00:19:59,513
What did you say,
you little trolls?

365
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:00,881
I will sue you.

366
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,117
I will sue you
and I will own you.

367
00:20:04,987 --> 00:20:06,454
You two.

368
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,356
I don't know what you did
or what's going on,

369
00:20:08,358 --> 00:20:10,858
but if you think just
because you saved my life, I--

370
00:20:13,528 --> 00:20:15,363
I'm sorry, Pacifica.

371
00:20:15,364 --> 00:20:16,364
We shouldn't have cheated.

372
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,500
You totally would've
beat me fair and square.

373
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:23,237
You're just lucky this sticker
looks fantastic on me.

374
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:31,379
Hey!
You're parents aren't here.

375
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:32,913
You want a ride home?

376
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:35,349
Puh-leaze,
as if I'd ride in your--

00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,186

Ugh!

381
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:46,560
Hey, I found two tacos!

382
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:50,931
You're allowed
to eat in the car?

383
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:54,201
Yeah, the car is where
secret surprise snacks happen.

384
00:20:54,203 --> 00:20:55,469
Want one?

385
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,471
Oh, I'm not supposed
to take handouts.

386
00:20:57,473 --> 00:21:00,341
Handouts?
It's called sharing!

387
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,310
You do know
what sharing is, right?

388
00:21:03,312 --> 00:21:05,212
Shar-- Shaar-ing?

389
00:21:05,214 --> 00:21:06,514
Just take it.

390
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,551
Thanks for the ride,
or whatever.

391
00:21:10,553 --> 00:21:12,520
Oh, and Mabel...

392
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:16,557
I can't believe I'm saying this
but I had fun.

393
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,592
And tell your servant
I like his W neck!

394
00:21:19,494 --> 00:21:21,395
Yes!

395
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:23,531
So are you guys, like,
cool now?

396
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,433
I think we made some progress.

397
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,967
The important thing
to remember is that

398
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:28,169
at the end of the day,

399
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,571
she's just an ordinary kid
like us.

400
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:37,044
Should've charged her
for that taco.

401
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:38,679
Agreed.

402
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:40,948
Hey, you got any more
of those surprise tacos?

403
00:21:42,485 --> 00:21:45,953
Laugh now, hugelings.
But Franz will have his day.

404
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:47,588
Franz will--

405
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,492

Now he gets it!

411
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,240
