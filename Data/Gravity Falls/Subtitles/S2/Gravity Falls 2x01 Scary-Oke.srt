1
00:00:27,243 --> 00:00:30,479
Thirty long years
and it's all led up to this.

2
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,080
My greatest achievement!

3
00:00:33,383 --> 00:00:35,183
Probably
should have worn pants.

4
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:38,487
Agh!

5
00:00:40,924 --> 00:00:42,491
Feisty, I like it.

6
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:55,237
If I finally pull this off, it
will all have been worth it.

7
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,644
I just need to keep
playing it cool.

8
00:01:02,646 --> 00:01:05,047
If anyone ever finds out
about this...

9
00:01:08,384 --> 00:01:11,086
Yeah, right.
I've come this far.

10
00:01:11,088 --> 00:01:13,355
Who could possibly
catch me now?

11
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,204
<i>See there, there it is again.</i>

12
00:01:29,206 --> 00:01:32,274
<i>We haven't seen
readings like this for 30 years.</i>

13
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:35,677
<i>Is it coming from deep space?
An enemy weapons site?</i>

14
00:01:36,913 --> 00:01:39,414
<i>Just as I suspected.</i>

15
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,351
Gentlemen, we're going
<i>to Gravity Falls.</i>

16
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,466
Oh, right.
Show time.

17
00:02:31,468 --> 00:02:34,603
<i>Welcome to the grand
re-opening of the Mystery Shack!</i>

18
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:37,205
Mystery Shack!

19
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:40,561
We're here to celebrate the defeat
of that skunk little Gideon.

20
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,043
Boo!

21
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,612
Please, please, boo harder.

22
00:02:43,614 --> 00:02:45,380
Boo!

23
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,182
But I didn't catch
that pork chop all alone.

24
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:49,618
These two scams deserve
some of the glory.

25
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,686
Oh!
Okay, okay.

26
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:53,021
Most of the glory.

27
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:55,257
Smile for the camera.

28
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,092
Your camera's
a cinder block, Toby.

29
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,995
I just want to be
a part of things.

30
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:01,696
Smile for a real camera.

31
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:03,698
Everyone say
"something stupid."

32
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,101
Something stupid!

33
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:09,371
And don't forget to come to the
after party tonight at 8:00.

34
00:03:09,373 --> 00:03:11,506
We're doing
a karaoke bonanza, people.

35
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,643
Lights! Music! Enchantment!
Phoo!

36
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:17,933
And an amazing karaoke
performance by our family band,

37
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,314
Love Patrol Alpha.

38
00:03:19,316 --> 00:03:20,715
Oh, I don't know about that.

39
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,350
I would never
agree to that ever.

40
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:23,952
Too late, I wrote your names
on the list.

41
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:24,686
It's happening.

42
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:27,556
Buy your ticket, people.

43
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:30,192
You know you don't have anything
else going on in your lives.

44
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:31,726
I'm talking to you, pizza guy.

45
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,662
Don't lame out on me.

46
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:35,530
Ha!
The town loves us.

47
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,732
We finally got that Gideon
smell out of the carpet.

48
00:03:37,734 --> 00:03:40,168
Everything
is finally going my way.

49
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,370
Hey, Grunkle Stan,
now that we have a moment,

50
00:03:42,372 --> 00:03:44,673
I've been meaning to ask you
for my journal back.

51
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:47,008
What? Journal?

52
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,311
Oh, you mean this old thing?

53
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:51,680
It was so boring
I couldn't even finish it.

54
00:03:56,086 --> 00:03:57,619
You didn't see nothing.

55
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,387
Wait, you're just gonna
give it to me?

56
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,223
Just like that?

57
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,905
What else do you want?
A kiss on the cheek?

58
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,392
I-- I got to go.

59
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:06,027
Whoa!

60
00:04:06,029 --> 00:04:07,429
I wouldn't mind
a kiss on the cheek.

61
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:08,587
Not gonna happen.

62
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,704
Mabel, we've got to talk.

63
00:04:15,706 --> 00:04:17,372
Almost losing my journal
made me realize

64
00:04:17,374 --> 00:04:19,074
that I'm halfway
through the summer

65
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,709
and still no closer
to figuring out

66
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,444
the big mysteries
of Gravity Falls.

67
00:04:22,446 --> 00:04:24,012
Gideon almost
destroyed the town

68
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,294
to get his hands
on this journal.

69
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,048
But why?
Who wrote it?

70
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,617
Where are
all the other journals?

71
00:04:28,619 --> 00:04:32,120
What was Bill talking about when he
said everything was going to change?

72
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:34,723
There's something huge
going on right under our noses.

73
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:38,326
And it's time we stop goofing
around and get to the bottom of it.

74
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:40,609
Bro, you've looked at that
thing, like, a bazillion times.

75
00:04:40,634 --> 00:04:42,264
There's nothing
left to discover.

76
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,132
Half the pages are blank,
remember?

77
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,803
I just feel like I'm one puzzle piece
away from figuring out everything.

78
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:50,372
Don't worry, Dipper.

79
00:04:50,374 --> 00:04:52,741
Lord Mystery Ham
is on the case.

80
00:04:52,743 --> 00:04:55,076
"I play by me own rules!
What? What?"

81
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:57,279
I don't know
why I tell you things.

82
00:04:57,281 --> 00:04:58,346
Do you hear that?

83
00:05:03,486 --> 00:05:05,353
Hey, Mr. Pines,
what's that code word

84
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,435
I'm supposed to yell
when I see a government vehicle?

85
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,460
Wait, what?
Government vehicle?

86
00:05:14,263 --> 00:05:17,098
The Mystery Shack is now closed.
Everybody out!

87
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,235
I will not hesitate to use
the hose on the elderly.

88
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:21,736
Uncle Stan, what's happening?

89
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,672
Yeah, you never
shut down the gift shop.

90
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,476
Welcome to the Mystery Shack,
gentlemen.

91
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:29,678
What can I get you?
Key chains?

92
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,446
Snow globes?

93
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:34,282
These rare
photos of American Presidents?

94
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:35,784
My name is Agent Powers.

95
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:37,118
This is Agent Trigger.

96
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,689
We're here to investigate reports of
mysterious activity in this town.

97
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,424
Activity.

98
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,793
Mysterious activity
in the Mystery Shack?

99
00:05:44,795 --> 00:05:45,860
You got to be joking.

100
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,696
I assure you I am not.

101
00:05:47,698 --> 00:05:49,664
I was born with a rare disorder
that makes me

102
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:52,100
physically incapable
of experiencing humor.

103
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:56,605
I don't understand that sound
you're making with your mouth.

104
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,674
Now if you'll excuse us, we're
conducting an investigation.

105
00:05:59,676 --> 00:06:01,276
Investigation.

106
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:02,711
Wait, wait.

107
00:06:02,713 --> 00:06:05,513
Did you guys say you're investigating
the mysteries of this town?

108
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:07,749
That information is classified.

109
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:08,883
But, yes.

110
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,785
Look, between you and me,

111
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,854
I believe there is a conspiracy
of paranormal origin

112
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,689
all connected to this town.

113
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:16,891
We're just one small lead away
from blowing

114
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:19,227
the lid off this
entire mystery.

115
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,795
Are you kidding me?

116
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,497
I'm investigating
the exact same thing.

117
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:25,834
I found this journal in the woods
which has almost all the answers.

118
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:28,370
If we work together,
we could crack the case.

119
00:06:29,905 --> 00:06:34,275
If you have evidence of these
claims, we should talk.

120
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:36,845
We can talk right now.
Please, please, come in.

121
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,647
I have so much to show you.

122
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,482
I'm sorry, agents.

123
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,219
Kid has an overactive imagination
and, like, a sweating problem.

124
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,654
Zing!

125
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:48,537
Paranormal town stuff,
it's just part of gift shop lore.

126
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:50,558
Sells more tickets, you know.

127
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,693
Pop-poro-po-po.

128
00:06:51,695 --> 00:06:53,862
Swag.

129
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:55,730
We have other spots
to investigate.

130
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:57,332
We'll be on our way.

131
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,694
I'm confiscating
this for evidence.

132
00:06:58,719 --> 00:06:59,668
Smart move.

133
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,336
Wait!
No, wait!

134
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:02,538
We have so much to talk about.

135
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:04,239
Hold it, kiddo.

136
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:07,442
Trust me, the last thing you want
around here in a party is cops.

137
00:07:07,444 --> 00:07:09,444
I'm confiscating that card.

138
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,312
And how's about
you go be a normal kid?

139
00:07:11,314 --> 00:07:13,314
Flirt with a girl,
or steal a pie off a windowsill.

140
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:14,949
But, Grunkle Stan,
you don't understand.

141
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:17,218
And don't go talking
to those agents.

142
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,889
That could have
been my big break.

143
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,924
Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan
is right.

144
00:07:22,926 --> 00:07:24,759
We're throwing
a party tonight.

145
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:26,661
Can't you go one night
without searching

146
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,897
for aliens or raising
the dead or whatever?

147
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:30,832
I'm not gonna raise the dead.

148
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,794
I just need a chance to show
those agents my book.

149
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,502
Trust me, Dipper.

150
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,504
The only book you'll need
tonight is right here.

151
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:37,706
Boo!

152
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:42,510
I say "kara," you say "oke."
Kara...

153
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:45,513
Kara...
Kara...

154
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,816
I could do this all day.

155
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,554
Agh!

156
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,796
Well, the confetti
cannon works.

157
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:57,792
And the karaoke machine
has all the best songs.

158
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:59,928
"We built this township
on rock and roll."

159
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,063
"Danger lane
to highway town."

160
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,966
"Taking over midnight"
by AmperSandra.

161
00:08:04,968 --> 00:08:07,469
Listen, kid, you do not want
to hear this voice singing.

162
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,370
Trust me.

163
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:12,307
Grunkle Stan, karaoke
isn't about sounding good.

164
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:15,009
It's about
sounding terrible, together.

165
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:19,380
Check it out! These black lights
make my teeth look scary.

166
00:08:21,016 --> 00:08:23,618
It's like a crime scene
in my mouth.

167
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,919
Come on, you'll love it.

168
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,654
It's not fair.

169
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:28,690
Finally I meet someone
who can help me

170
00:08:28,692 --> 00:08:31,459
solve the mysteries of this town
and Stan confiscates their card.

171
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,301
Dude, I probably
shouldn't be telling you this,

172
00:08:33,326 --> 00:08:36,965
but I'm pretty sure Stan hides
like everything in his room.

173
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:39,968
If I go into Stan's room,
I could get in so much trouble.

174
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,536
Yeah, you're probably right.

175
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:43,471
That's what
makes it fun, dummy.

176
00:08:44,974 --> 00:08:47,609
Man, I can't wait to smash
these Stanatas.

177
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,410
Smash!

178
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:51,312
Grenda has entered the party!

179
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:53,014
Stan's brains look delicious.

180
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,482
Girls!

181
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:57,285
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, Mabel!

182
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,953
Is that a boom box sweater?

183
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,388
See for yourself.

184
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,689
Poke!

185
00:09:01,691 --> 00:09:05,293
Yeah, yeah!
Work it! Ah!

186
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,830
Aw!

187
00:09:08,832 --> 00:09:10,698
I thought this was
gonna be a rave.

188
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,001
Thompson, take off your shirt
and make it a rave.

189
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:16,337
I'll do anything
for your approval.

190
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:17,772
Oh, come on.

191
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,407
I promise I won't
send it to anyone.

192
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:24,345
Who's got one good eye
and one good pie?

193
00:09:24,347 --> 00:09:25,847
These kegs are full of meat.

194
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,918
Tambry sends me
the craziest text.

195
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,688
The whole town is showing up and
no sign of those pesky agents.

196
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,057
Wendy, Dipper, how are those
posters coming along?

197
00:09:38,527 --> 00:09:39,761
Hmm.

198
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:44,499
I'll keep an eye out for Stan.

199
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,221
You go rustle through
his weird old man biz.

200
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,975
All right, Grunkle Stan,
where did you hide that card?

201
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:55,043
Nothing.

202
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:56,511
Nothing.

203
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,579
Nothing.

204
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,615
Ew!

205
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:02,050
Pretending I never saw that.

206
00:10:03,052 --> 00:10:04,485
Wait a minute.

207
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:07,555
Yes!

208
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:09,991
I got it!

209
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,429
<i>Agent Powers.</i>

210
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:16,097
Hi, this is Dipper.

211
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:19,534
The kid from the Mystery Shack, the
one with the, um, sweating problem.

212
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,569
I have that journal
I wanted to show you.

213
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,771
<i>And you're certain this journal
will help our case?</i>

214
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,473
I'm 100% positive.

215
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,842
<i>Very well.
We're on our way.</i>

216
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,613
Sorry, Dipper.
I got distracted.

217
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,548
Kid, why did you call
those agents?

218
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,270
I've told you once,
I've told you 100 times,

219
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:38,820
there's nothing supernatural
going on in Gravity Falls.

220
00:10:38,822 --> 00:10:40,455
Yes, there is.

221
00:10:40,457 --> 00:10:43,558
After everything that's happened,
you have to know that by now.

222
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,693
All I know
is that your dumb obsession

223
00:10:45,695 --> 00:10:48,096
is gonna get us all in trouble
one of these days.

224
00:10:48,098 --> 00:10:50,164
Now go enjoy
the rest of the party,

225
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,700
'cause when it's over,
you're grounded.

226
00:10:57,106 --> 00:10:58,940
Hmm.

227
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:08,116
Hey, boys, looking good!

228
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:09,851
Gorney, you clean up nice.

229
00:11:09,853 --> 00:11:12,420
Mr. Poolcheck,
move those crazy legs.

230
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,056
You-- You weird pool man.

231
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:16,891
What's the problem, officers?

232
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:20,561
Did you catch my face
going 90 smiles per hour?

233
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:23,131
We've got complaints about
the loudest party in town.

234
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,999
Three words.

235
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,067
We want in.

236
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,471
Welcome to your dreams.

237
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:38,012
Guys, I'm so glad to see you.

238
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:41,950
Working together, we can crack all
the big questions of Gravity Falls.

239
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,485
Trust me, this book is the lead
you've been looking for.

240
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:46,220
I'm thinking
full-scale investigation.

241
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:47,855
Forensics, researchers.

242
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,157
Do you guys have a helicopter?

243
00:11:50,493 --> 00:11:52,527
I'm sorry, "helicopters".

244
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,163
Kid, I'd love to believe you,
but this just looks like

245
00:11:55,165 --> 00:11:57,065
more junk
from your uncle's gift shop.

246
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:59,033
I mean, "leprecorn"?

247
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,636
I can't be the only one
that thinks that it's not funny.

248
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,738
I can confirm.
Not funny.

249
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,573
No, it's real, I swear.

250
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,141
You should
"send it to the lab".

251
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,143
Am I saying that right?

252
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,305
Your uncle was right about
that overactive imagination.

253
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,214
We've got paperwork to do, kid.

254
00:12:13,216 --> 00:12:14,949
- Boring paperwork.
- Wait!

255
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,584
This book is real.

256
00:12:16,586 --> 00:12:18,186
Gnomes, cursed objects, spells!

257
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:19,654
Listen!
Uh...

258
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,189
Uh...
Corpus Levitas!

259
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:24,692
Uh, Diablo Dominus!
Um, Mondo Vicium!

260
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:28,997
Huh?

261
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,098
Huh?

262
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:42,210
Ha, a zombie!
A real actual zombie, see.

263
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,112
Spooky journal, 100% real.

264
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:45,646
Now can we work together?

265
00:12:45,648 --> 00:12:48,216
- Mother of all that is holy.
- What do we do?

266
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,084
It's just one zombie.

267
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,953
Trust me, I see stuff like this
all the time.

268
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:57,966
Good thing
it was just that one.

269
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:05,900
Oh, my gosh.
You guys can help, right?

270
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:08,036
Kid, we've been chasing
the paranormal for years,

271
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,271
but we've never seen
anything like this before.

272
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,572
Get down!

273
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,846
Oh, my gosh.
What have I done?

274
00:13:20,849 --> 00:13:23,651
♪ What up, fools?
It's Blubs and Durls ♪

275
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,788
♪ Making all that money
and getting them girls ♪

276
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,589
Oh!

277
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,692
What do you say, guys?
Is this party legendary?

278
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,995
When I say Mabel,
you say Pines.

279
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,164
Mabel!

280
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,665
Mabel!

281
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,267
We're all gonna die!

282
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:40,269
Why does that never work?

283
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,070
Whoa, whoa.

284
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,871
I think it's an earthquake.

285
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:46,007
Hey, everybody, we got
to get out of here!

286
00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,575
We're all doomed.

287
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,776
Quick!
Into my getaway pouch!

288
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,280
Mabel,
escape while you still can!

289
00:13:52,282 --> 00:13:54,282
Wait! No!
Don't leave!

290
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:57,018
You haven't even done
our family karaoke song yet.

291
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:05,660
Dipper, what's the one thing
I asked you not to do tonight?

292
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,128
Raise the dead.

293
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,630
- And what did you do?
- Raise the dead.

294
00:14:11,868 --> 00:14:14,202
Get back, dudes.
This is about to get intense.

295
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,208
Sorry, one second.

296
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:23,437
You've got to admit
this is pretty cool.

297
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,317
Zombies!

298
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,819
Don't panic. Maybe they're just
a really ugly flash mob.

299
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:35,957
Dudes, stay calm.

300
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:38,659
I've been training for
this moment my whole life.

301
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,394
With all the horror movies
I've seen,

302
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:43,280
I know literally everything there is
to know about how to avoid zombies.

303
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,402
Second thought,
gonna flip the script.

304
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:51,739
Can I eat your brains?
Yay or nay?

305
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,341
Seeing some yay faces
over here.

306
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:01,449
Quick, the golf cart.

307
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,786
Oh, come on.

308
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:06,908
That's a bummer.

309
00:15:06,933 --> 00:15:08,156
Good news for me though.

310
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,857
Soos!

311
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:12,293
Sorry, dude, I just really
want those brains.

312
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:13,361
Stay back!

313
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:22,003
Give it up, dudes.

314
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,871
Your fighting only makes us
look more rad.

315
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,007
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?

316
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,775
How's he supposed to help?

317
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,497
He doesn't even believe
in the supernatural.

318
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:33,948
Those agents
could ruin everything.

319
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,349
Darn kid!

320
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,084
He has no idea
what he's messing with.

321
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,021
He's stubborn.
That's his problem.

322
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,823
Sort of like me, I suppose.

323
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,196
I got too much on my mind to
worry about those kids right now.

324
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:49,430
All right, let's see.

325
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,938
Take that, sucker!

326
00:16:01,476 --> 00:16:03,477
This thing's a surprisingly
good weapon.

327
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,948
We need to board up
all the windows.

328
00:16:12,854 --> 00:16:15,223
Okay,
maybe that will hold them.

329
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,258
- Oh!
- Hi, dudes.

330
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,620
By the way, I taught the zombies
how to get to the fuse box.

331
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,278
Among these dudes
I'm like a genius.

332
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:23,764
Get those brains, dog.

333
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:30,871
Dipper, isn't there something in the
journal about defeating zombies?

334
00:16:30,873 --> 00:16:33,174
No! There's nothing in here
about weaknesses.

335
00:16:33,176 --> 00:16:35,042
This can't be happening.

336
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,445
I wanted answers so bad
I put everyone in danger.

337
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:39,180
Now we're toast.

338
00:16:39,182 --> 00:16:41,215
It's all my fault
and no one can save us.

339
00:16:42,485 --> 00:16:44,085
No!
Mabel, I'm sorry!

340
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
Dipper!

341
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,465
You two, attic, now!

342
00:16:57,467 --> 00:16:59,066
Grunkle-- Grunkle Stan?

343
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:00,468
I said now!

344
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,305
All right, you undead jerks,
you ready to die twice?

345
00:17:06,175 --> 00:17:09,510
The only wrinkly monster
who harasses my family is me.

346
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:10,511
Take that!

347
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:12,213
And that!

348
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:16,317
Beat it, no-eyes.

349
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:21,489
Anyone else want a piece?

350
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,076
Oh! Ow!

351
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:43,444
Everything hurts.

352
00:17:43,446 --> 00:17:45,246
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!

353
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:46,347
Are you all right?

354
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:51,385
Well, at least, you can't deny
magic exists anymore, right?

355
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,054
Kid, I've always known.

356
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:54,955
Wait.
What are you talking about?

357
00:17:54,957 --> 00:17:56,857
I'm not an idiot, Dipper.

358
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:59,160
Of course, this town is weird
and the one thing

359
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,595
I know about that weirdness
is that it's dangerous.

360
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,867
I've been lying about it to try
to keep you away from it,

361
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:08,569
to try to protect you from it.

362
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:14,909
It looks like I didn't lie
well enough.

363
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:19,080
What do we do?
What do we do?

364
00:18:19,082 --> 00:18:20,548
Normally,
the journal would help us,

365
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,630
but there's nothing in there
about defeating zombies.

366
00:18:22,655 --> 00:18:23,984
It's hopeless.

367
00:18:23,986 --> 00:18:25,553
Wait, wait, wait, the text!

368
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,388
It's glowing
in the black light.

369
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,489
What?

370
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,960
All this time I thought
I knew all the journal secrets.

371
00:18:32,962 --> 00:18:35,229
But they're written
in some kind of invisible ink.

372
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:36,397
Invisible ink?

373
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,598
This is it.

374
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,300
"Zombies have a weakness!

375
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:41,369
Previously thought
to be invincible,

376
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,904
their skulls can be shattered by
a perfect three part harmony."

377
00:18:43,906 --> 00:18:46,107
Three part harmony?
How can we create that?

378
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:48,175
I have a naturally
high pitched scream.

379
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:50,911
I can make noises with my body.
Sometimes intentionally.

380
00:18:50,913 --> 00:18:52,580
Boys, boys.

381
00:18:52,582 --> 00:18:55,516
I think you're both missing
the obvious solution.

382
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:00,488
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

383
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,089
<i>Does this seem loud?</i>

384
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,327
Oh, <i>Gossiping Housewives</i> is on.

385
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,230
Eh, I already sat down.

386
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,138
Zombies and gentlemen,
I'm Mable,

387
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,507
they're Dipper and Stan
and together,

388
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:22,543
we are Love Patrol Alpha!

389
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:23,665
I never agreed to that name.

390
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,979
Hit it!

391
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,620

Thank you!

We'll be here all night!

420
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,466
Deal with it, zombie idiots!

421
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:54,702
Pines! Pines!

422
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,103
Pines! Pines!

423
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:00,741
I'm sorry about this, guys.

424
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,776
I totally ruined everything.

425
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:04,478
Dipper, are you kidding me?

426
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,182
I got to sing karaoke with my two
favorite people in the world.

427
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,451
No party could ever top that.

428
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:13,153
Kids, listen,
this town is crazy.

429
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,722
So you need to be careful.

430
00:21:14,724 --> 00:21:17,758
I don't know what I'd do with
myself if you got hurt on my watch.

431
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,194
I'll let you hold
onto that spooky journal

432
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,129
as long as you promise me
you'll only use it

433
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:25,165
for self-defense
and not go looking for trouble.

434
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,201
Okay, as long as
you promise me

435
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,205
that you don't have any other
bombshell secrets about this town.

436
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,239
Promise.

437
00:21:32,241 --> 00:21:33,474
Promise.

438
00:21:35,076 --> 00:21:37,745
Man, we have got a lot of
zombie damage to clean up.

439
00:21:37,747 --> 00:21:39,079
Where's my handyman anyway?

440
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:41,749
Brains! Brains!

441
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:42,816
Holy Moses!

442
00:21:42,818 --> 00:21:44,752
Wait!

443
00:21:44,754 --> 00:21:46,754
There's a page in here about
curing zombification.

444
00:21:46,756 --> 00:21:48,756
It's gonna
take a lot of formaldehyde.

445
00:21:48,758 --> 00:21:50,391
Ooh, and cinnamon.

446
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,792
Come on, Soos,
let's fix you up.

447
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:54,228
Brains! Brains!

448
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,429
Soos, cut it out!

449
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:56,630
Sorry, dude.

450
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,365
I can't believe it.

451
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:01,368
All this time the author's secrets
were hiding in plain sight.

452
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,671
A whole new chapter
of mysteries to explore.

453
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,376
That was insane.

454
00:22:09,378 --> 00:22:11,078
I've never seen
anything like it.

455
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,313
Who do we report to?

456
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,117
This is bigger than
we imagined.

457
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:18,819
We need to bring in
the big guns.

458
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,387
But they'll never believe us.

459
00:22:20,389 --> 00:22:22,122
Then we'll make them
believe us.

460
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:24,792
This is the town
we've been searching for.

461
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:26,627
Ba-- Ba-- Bam.

462
00:22:26,629 --> 00:22:28,329
Another zombie!

463
00:22:28,331 --> 00:22:29,851
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop your weapon!

464
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,533
Oh, okay,
it's just--

465
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:34,335
- Who is that guy?
- A very ugly man.
