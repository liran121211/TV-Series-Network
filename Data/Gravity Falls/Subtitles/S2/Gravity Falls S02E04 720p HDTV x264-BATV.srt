1
00:00:04,749 --> 00:00:06,051
All right, Mabel,
today is the big day.

2
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:07,084
Big day!

3
00:00:07,086 --> 00:00:09,754
Soos finally
fixed up the laptop.

4
00:00:09,755 --> 00:00:10,921
If this thing works,

5
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:12,455
we could learn the identity
of the author

6
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:14,924
and unravel the greatest
mysteries of Gravity Falls.

7
00:00:14,925 --> 00:00:15,957
You ready?

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,827
Oh, I'm ready, baby.

9
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:28,533
This is it.
This is it.

10
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:33,333
Ha ha! It worked!

11
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:37,407
Blip, blap,
bloobity bloop, twins.

12
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:43,744
Ugh!
Of course, a password.

13
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:45,446
Don't you worry,
bro bro.

14
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:48,581
With your brains
and my laser focus,

15
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:51,684
there is literally nothing
that can distract us from...

16
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:53,919

00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:56,053

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,361
I finally understand
what all the buzz is about.

23
00:01:08,363 --> 00:01:09,662
Reading.

24
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:11,463
Give me some
of that honey.

25
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:21,405
Oh, boy.

26
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,601
Thank you.
Thank you.

27
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:06,869
Just when I was getting
over Mermando,

28
00:02:06,871 --> 00:02:09,171
of course, you show up
at my doorstep.

29
00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,539
Oh, yeah, I forgot
about Mermando.

30
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:14,442
Did not care
for Mermandooo.

31
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:15,908
Okay,
this cryptology book says

32
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:18,646
there's 7.2 million
8-letter words.

33
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:20,612
I'll type, you read.
Okay, Mabel?

34
00:02:20,614 --> 00:02:21,713
Mabel?

35
00:02:22,948 --> 00:02:26,150

Hey, I'm Gabe Benson,
y'all.

38
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:30,820
Goodnight.

39
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,057
Hey, good job today,
you guys.

40
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,858
You were late
on your cue.

41
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,859
What?

42
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:39,525
Hey, hey.
Be good to each other.

43
00:02:39,528 --> 00:02:40,961
We're all stars.

44
00:02:40,962 --> 00:02:42,194
Hey!
Guess who's Mabel?

45
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,195
I am!

46
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,765
Care to learn more?
I bet you do.

47
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,932
You like to learn.

48
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:50,249
And I'm up!

49
00:02:50,265 --> 00:02:52,769
Oh, hey, I'm Gabe,
master of puppets.

50
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:53,870
Nice to meet you.

51
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:56,072
You're amazing
with those puppets.

52
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:56,601
Really?

53
00:02:56,602 --> 00:02:58,506
A lot of people
think puppets are dumb

54
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:00,442
or just for kids
or something.

55
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:03,677
Are you kidding me?
I'm puppet crazy.

56
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:05,811
People call me
"puppet crazy Mabel".

57
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:06,811
Really?

58
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,178
People used to call me
"puppet crazy Gabe".

59
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,013
So when's your
next puppet show?

60
00:03:10,012 --> 00:03:11,012
My huh?

61
00:03:11,012 --> 00:03:12,012
I mean, you can't truly love puppets

62
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:13,885
if you're not throwing
puppet shows, right.

63
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:18,120
Yeah, I mean I'm totally
working on a puppet show.

64
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:19,955
Oh,
what are the details?

65
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:23,924
There are
so many details.

66
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,450
So, how did it go?

67
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:31,795
Dipper, how hard
do you think it would be

68
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:34,164
to write and compose
a sock puppet rock opera

69
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:36,832
with light, original music and live
pyrotechnics by Friday?

70
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:39,669
What?
Mabel, are you serious?

71
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,036
I don't know
what happened.

72
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,006
I got lost in his eyes
and his ponytail

73
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,805
and I'm going to be
so embarrassed on Friday

74
00:03:44,809 --> 00:03:46,475
if I don't have
anything.

75
00:03:46,475 --> 00:03:48,241
But what about cracking
this password?

76
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:50,077
You know,
mystery twins?

77
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,980
If you help me with this
for just a couple of days,

78
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,813
I promise I'll help you
with the password.

79
00:03:54,814 --> 00:03:56,747
Please.
Pretty please.

80
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,651
It's for love, Dipper.

81
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:02,218
All right, okay.

82
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:04,086
Yes!
Thank you.

83
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:06,655
This guy,
he's number one!

84
00:04:06,656 --> 00:04:07,722
Okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

85
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:11,159
Man, I can't wait to get to
the bottom of this laptop.

86
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,660
We're close
to something big here.

87
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,159
I can feel it.

88
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:24,800
Ugh!

89
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:28,838
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

90
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,172
Come on.

91
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,015
All right, the play
is going to be called

92
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:46,850
"Glove Story-
A Sock Opera."

93
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:49,151
Just a warning,
people's eyes will get wet,

94
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,987
'cause they'll be crying
from laughing,

95
00:04:51,987 --> 00:04:54,087
from how tragic it is.

96
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:55,722
Yeah, that...
that sounds great.

97
00:04:56,722 --> 00:04:57,092
Come on, Dipper,

98
00:04:57,105 --> 00:04:59,259
you just got to roll
with Mabel's craziness.

99
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:01,061
It's what makes
life worth living.

100
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:02,295
♪ Puppet boy,
puppet boy ♪

101
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:04,061

00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:05,897

00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:09,132
Not even gonna ask.

104
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,835
Goodnight, my babies.

105
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:18,738
Soon, Gabe Benson.

106
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:21,042
Ugh, wrong password.

107
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,941
Wrong. Wrong! Ugh!

108
00:05:22,942 --> 00:05:24,075
Don't stay up
all night, Dipper.

109
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:26,111
Last time you got
this sleep deprived

110
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,778
you tried to eat
your own shirt.

111
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:30,748
Bleh.

112
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,883
Just a few more tries.

113
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:37,820
Ugh!
I can't take that sound anymore.

114
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,722
I hate you sound.

115
00:05:41,724 --> 00:05:44,124
There has to be
some shortcut or clue.

116
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,159
Who would know
about secret codes?

117
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,905
I think I know a guy.

118
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,007
Well, well, well,

119
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:09,075
you're awfully persistent,
Pine Tree.

120
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,275
Hats off to you.

121
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:14,311
You again!

122
00:06:14,312 --> 00:06:17,980
Did you miss me?
Admit it, you missed me.

123
00:06:17,982 --> 00:06:19,682
Hardly.
You worked with Gideon.

124
00:06:19,684 --> 00:06:22,151
You tried to destroy
my uncle's mind.

125
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:25,153
It was just a job, kid.
No hard feelings.

126
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:28,055
I've been keeping
an eye on you

127
00:06:28,056 --> 00:06:30,857
since then and I must say,
I'm impressed.

128
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:31,857
Really?

129
00:06:31,857 --> 00:06:33,156
You deserve a prize.

130
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:35,295
Here, have a head
that's always screaming.

131
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,800
The point is,
I like you.

132
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,867
How's about you let me
give you a hint, huh?

133
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:50,171
I only ask
for a small favor in return.

134
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,004
I'd never do
a favor for you.

135
00:06:52,006 --> 00:06:54,040
Don't forget who defeated
you last time.

136
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,142
Right,
you defeated me.

137
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:58,376
Well, if you ever
change your mind,

138
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,612
I'll be here for you
ready to make a deal.

139
00:07:02,345 --> 00:07:04,780
Hey, want to hear my impression
of you in about 3 seconds.

140
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,922
Hey,
I'm puppet Stan.

141
00:07:15,923 --> 00:07:17,156
Still ignoring this.

142
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,090
Hey, Mabel.

143
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,193
Whoa, bag check
for Dipper's eyes.

144
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:24,027
Nobody?

145
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:26,630
Dipper, I told you to get
some sleep last night.

146
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,765
Here, wake up
with some Mabel juice.

147
00:07:28,765 --> 00:07:31,399
It has plastic
dinosaurs in it.

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,068
It's like if coffee
and nightmares had a baby.

149
00:07:34,068 --> 00:07:35,068
Mabel, listen.

150
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,168
Last night I had
a dream with Bill in it.

151
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:39,404
Wait, hold up.
The triangle guy?

152
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:41,673
He said he'd give me
the code of the laptop

153
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:43,207
if I gave him
something.

154
00:07:43,209 --> 00:07:45,176
Like I'd actually
trust Bill, right?

155
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,077
Don't worry, bro.

156
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,077
Today is the day

157
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:49,045
that the mystery twins
are back in action.

158
00:07:49,045 --> 00:07:50,211
I'll help you
crack that code.

159
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:51,947
I just got to hand
off my puppet stuff

160
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:53,082
to my production crew.

161
00:07:53,082 --> 00:07:54,281
Production crew?

162
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:58,153
We read the script.
Very emotional.

163
00:07:58,154 --> 00:08:00,220
I cried, like,
eight times.

164
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,286
Hey, ladies.

165
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:04,923
Gabe!

166
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:05,922
I was just blading by.

167
00:08:05,925 --> 00:08:08,160
Helps me dry out my ponytail
after a shower.

168
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:12,094
Hoppity boppity.

169
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:16,262
It's so great to see you!

170
00:08:16,264 --> 00:08:19,266
I was just working on the
world's greatest puppet show.

171
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,733
It has puppets.

172
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:22,736
Your passion
is so refreshing, Mabel,

173
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:25,104
unlike the girl from
last night's puppet show.

174
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:28,140
Single-stitch on one puppet
and cross-stitch on the other?

175
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:30,675
I was like, uh-huh.

176
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,075
Cross... huh?

177
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:34,977
Naturally I deleted her off
my cell phone contacts list.

178
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,213
Naturally.

179
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,815
I know you won't
let me down though.

180
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:41,116
Based on what you
said the other day,

181
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,816
you must be
a puppet expert.

182
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:44,752
You know, Gabe,
you look pretty sweaty.

183
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:46,319
You should really
take your shirt off.

184
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:47,385
Right?

185
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:48,820
Aren't we all
thinking that?

186
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:50,455
Later, ladies.

187
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:56,060
We got to up
our game, girls.

188
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:59,062
Did you hear that thing
he said about the stitches?

189
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:02,032
Don't worry, Mabel,
your crew can handle it.

190
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,401
How many eyes does
a face have again?

191
00:09:07,367 --> 00:09:09,902
I got it. I got it. Oh!

192
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,705
I'm not okay.

193
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:15,707
Ah!
Okay, I'm back on fabrication.

194
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,042
Get me my lint roller.

195
00:09:17,042 --> 00:09:18,112
Oh, hey! You just said you were going to help me.

196
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:23,278
Dipper, this sock crisis just
bumped up to a code argyle.

197
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,179
The laptop can wait.

198
00:09:25,181 --> 00:09:26,314
Mabel,
do you seriously think

199
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:27,816
that your random
crush of the week

200
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:29,082
is more important
than uncovering

201
00:09:29,083 --> 00:09:30,216
the mysteries
of this town?

202
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,385
You're obsessed.

203
00:09:31,385 --> 00:09:32,451
I'm obsessed?

204
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:35,054
Look at you.
You look like a vampire.

205
00:09:35,054 --> 00:09:36,054
And not the hot kind.

206
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:38,022
But you said you were
gonna help me today.

207
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:41,191
Well, I can help
you with tickles.

208
00:09:44,994 --> 00:09:46,027
Okay, fine.
You know what?

209
00:09:46,031 --> 00:09:47,931
I'll do it on my own.

210
00:09:49,165 --> 00:09:51,466
Passwords, passwords.

211
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:54,734
Mabel is useless.

212
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,070
Oh, man.

213
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:59,270
<i>Too many
failed entries.
Huh?</i>

214
00:09:59,271 --> 00:10:02,072
<i>Initiate data erase
in 5 minutes.</i>

215
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:07,345
I'm gonna lose everything?
I only have one more try?

216
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:11,448
Well, well, well.

217
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:13,181
Someone's looking
desperate.

218
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:15,149
I thought I told you
to leave me alone.

219
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,315
I can help you, kid.

220
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:18,117
You just need to hear
out my demands.

221
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:19,986
Ugh!

222
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:21,354
What crazy thing do
you want, anyway?

223
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,521
To eat my soul?
To rip out my teeth?

224
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:27,024
Are you gonna replace my eyes
with baby heads or something?

225
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:30,127
Yeesh, kid, relax.
All I want is a puppet.

226
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:32,894
A puppet?
What are you playing at?

227
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:34,329
Everyone loves puppets.

228
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,297
And it looks to me like
you've got a surplus.

229
00:10:36,298 --> 00:10:38,265
I don't know, man.

230
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:40,533
Mabel worked
really hard on these.

231
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:43,169
Seems to me one little puppet
is a small price to pay

232
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:45,305
to learn all the secrets
of the universe.

233
00:10:45,305 --> 00:10:48,506
Besides, what's your sister
done for you lately?

234
00:10:48,507 --> 00:10:51,341
How many times have you
sacrificed for her, huh?

235
00:10:51,342 --> 00:10:54,043
And when has she ever
returned the favor?

236
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:00,848
Tick tock, kid.

237
00:11:01,782 --> 00:11:04,117
Just one puppet?
Fine.

238
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:08,520
So what puppet are
you gonna pick anyway?

239
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,789
Hmm, let's see.
Eenie meenie mynee...

240
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:13,790
You.

241
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:15,392
What?

242
00:11:16,492 --> 00:11:18,793
What?
This can't be happening.

243
00:11:18,795 --> 00:11:20,395
What did you
do to my body?

244
00:11:23,897 --> 00:11:26,265
Sorry, kid, but
you're my puppet now.

245
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,906
Oh, my gosh. This can't be happening.

246
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:31,977
This can't be happening!

247
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:38,308
Man it is been so long since I've
been having in a body!

248
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,009
Pain is hilarious!

249
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,860
And two eyes? This thing's deluxe!

250
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:49,751
I don't understand!
Why are you doing this?

251
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:50,492
I thought we had a deal!

252
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:54,833
Look kid, you've been getting way too
close to figuring out some major answers.

253
00:11:54,834 --> 00:11:57,900
I've got big plans coming and I
don't need you getting in my way!

254
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:01,905
Destroying that laptop was a cinch,
now I just need to destroy your journal!

255
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:03,326
Race you to the bottom of the stairs!

256
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,300
Hey.
Human soda.

257
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:17,236
I'm gonna drink
it like a person.

258
00:12:20,138 --> 00:12:22,039
So where do you keep
that journal anyway?

259
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,407
It's got to be around
here somewhere.

260
00:12:24,408 --> 00:12:26,075
Boy, these arms are durable.

261
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:27,074
I've hidden it! Somewhere

262
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:29,244
you'll never find it
in a million years.

263
00:12:29,242 --> 00:12:30,242
Hey Dipper!

264
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:31,911
I borrowed your journal
to use as a prop in the show.

265
00:12:31,911 --> 00:12:32,911
I hope you don't mind,

266
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:34,113
I'm gonna go before you
process this sentence.

267
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:35,481
Okay, bye!

268
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:40,119
Sure, sounds great, sister.
I'll see you at the show.

269
00:12:40,119 --> 00:12:41,618
Wait.
No, Mabel, don't listen to him.

270
00:12:41,622 --> 00:12:42,888
That's not me.

271
00:12:43,921 --> 00:12:44,921
You've got to hear me.

272
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,189
No, no. Wait. Stop!

273
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,292
Ha, welcome
to the mindscape, kid.

274
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,861
Without a vessel to possess,
you're basically a ghost.

275
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,226
Oh, hi, Dipper.
There you are.

276
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,463
What up, dude?

277
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:56,563
Soos. Wendy.
Help me.

278
00:12:56,565 --> 00:12:59,532
We're headed
to the theater.
Need a ride, Dipper?

279
00:12:59,534 --> 00:13:01,634
Anything for you, Red.

280
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,134
I'm gonna stop you, Bill.

281
00:13:03,135 --> 00:13:05,202
I'm gonna find that
journal before you do

282
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:06,638
and I'm gonna stop you!

283
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:11,875
But how can you stop
me if you don't exist?

284
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:21,616
Bill?
Bill!

285
00:13:21,615 --> 00:13:24,349
Got to get my body back before
he does something crazy with it.

286
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,054
Ah, nothing like
the theater, huh, toots?

287
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:31,354
Hey, Soos, want to hear

288
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,889
the exact time and date
of your death?

289
00:13:33,891 --> 00:13:34,990
Okay.

290
00:13:34,991 --> 00:13:36,491
Hey, guys,
you all made it.

291
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,490
Are you kidding me?

292
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:40,461
I would never miss
whatever this is.

293
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:43,129
By the by, Mabel, where'd
you put my journal again?

294
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:45,398
I used it as a prop
for the big wedding scene.

295
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:47,131
I still need
a reverend though.

296
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,034
Hey, what if I play
the reverend?

297
00:13:49,034 --> 00:13:51,201
I mean, someone's got to
hold that journal, right?

298
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:52,504
Great. Let's go.

299
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,337
Oh, no, wait.
Mabel!

300
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,911
The show is about to begin.

301
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:07,547
Please turn off
your cell phones,

302
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:10,016
unless
you're texting me, cuties.

303
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:17,120
Gather around
and let us sing

304
00:14:17,122 --> 00:14:21,091
about a girl who had
almost everything.

305
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,125
Look, it's Mabel.

306
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,193
Hey there.

307
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:26,394
Did you say stable?

308
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,028
No, he said Mabel.

309
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,030
Okay, hit it, boys!

310
00:14:30,031 --> 00:14:33,566
♪ Who's that girl
with the pig and the braces? ♪

311
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:37,169
♪ She put smiles
on everyone's faces ♪

312
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,438

318
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,180
Hey, what's up?
I'm Gabe.

319
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,783
So, hey, Grendo,

320
00:14:58,784 --> 00:15:01,084
where's that book prop I'm
using for the wedding scene?

321
00:15:01,086 --> 00:15:02,519
It's up in the wedding cake.

322
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,320
But that doesn't come
down until Act 3.

323
00:15:04,323 --> 00:15:06,190
So hold your horses.

324
00:15:06,189 --> 00:15:10,124
Oh, I'll hold my horses.
I'll hold them.

325
00:15:10,127 --> 00:15:11,426
You monster.

326
00:15:13,027 --> 00:15:14,461
Hey, listen.
Have you seen Mabel?

327
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:16,128
Hmm.

328
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:17,297
What did Bill say?

329
00:15:17,298 --> 00:15:19,331
I can't be heard
without a vessel?

330
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,033
Where would I find a...

331
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:25,502
Finally we're together.

332
00:15:25,504 --> 00:15:30,173
I'm sorry, Mabel, but I have
to go fight in the war.

333
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:39,579
I'll wait for you, Gabe.

334
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:41,080
I'll wait for you.

335
00:15:41,081 --> 00:15:44,149
Our intermission
has begun.

336
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:45,248
Mill about.

337
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:49,319
Ooh!
Okay, you can do this, Mabel.

338
00:15:49,321 --> 00:15:51,654
Only 36 more musical numbers.

339
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:56,523
Psst.
Mabel.

340
00:15:58,522 --> 00:15:59,102
It's come to life!

341
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:02,027
The puppet books
didn't warn me about this.

342
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:06,066
Mabel, it's me, Dipper.
You need to help me.

343
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,133
Wait, what?
Dipper?

344
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,035
But you're so much more
of a sock than usual.

345
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:13,769
Mabel, you have to listen.
Bill tricked me.

346
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,238
He stole my body and now
he's after the journal.

347
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,539
You have to find the journal
before Bill destroys it.

348
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:21,008
It's the only hope
to get me back in my body.

349
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,776
But my cue's
coming up any minute.

350
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:25,178
Hey, Mabel,
do you have a moment?

351
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,179
Gabe!

352
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,213
Ow!
Mabel.

353
00:16:29,214 --> 00:16:32,048
Mabel, it's clear to me now
that you really love puppets.

354
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:33,483
I mean you went whole hog.

355
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:35,384
And if you stick
the ending, well,

356
00:16:35,385 --> 00:16:37,519
maybe later you could
join me for a biscotti?

357
00:16:38,554 --> 00:16:41,355
You drive a biscotti?

358
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:42,624
I'll be waiting.

359
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:46,127
Did you hear that?
He loves it!

360
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:48,027
This play
has to be flawless.

361
00:16:48,028 --> 00:16:49,794
Can't we wait
until after the show?

362
00:16:49,796 --> 00:16:52,797
Mabel, you want me to be
a sock puppet forever?

363
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,799
I'm sorry.

364
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,100
It looks funny
when you're mad.

365
00:16:58,508 --> 00:16:59,098
Okay, okay, okay.

366
00:16:59,538 --> 00:17:03,740
Just take over for me until
I get back with the book.

367
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,107
Little puppet face.

368
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,042
Gabe, you're back
from the war.

369
00:17:09,043 --> 00:17:12,111
Want to kiss and sing
at the same time?

370
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,479
Okay.

371
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:17,347
Seriously?

372
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:28,357
Come on.
Come on.

373
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:34,426
I hope this kiss never ends.

374
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:38,830
There must be a way to
get Dipper's body back.

375
00:17:38,831 --> 00:17:41,666
Oh-oh, but why would
you want to do that?

376
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:46,802
Bill-Dipper!
Bipper.

377
00:17:46,803 --> 00:17:48,069
Shh.

378
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,203
You wouldn't
want to ruin the show.

379
00:17:50,206 --> 00:17:51,372
Whoops.

380
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:53,572
It's slipping.

381
00:17:53,577 --> 00:17:55,276
How's about you
hand that book over?

382
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,741
No way.
This is Dipper's.

383
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,843
I'd never give it away.

384
00:17:57,844 --> 00:17:58,877
Hmm.

385
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:00,278
You didn't seem
to have a problem

386
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,580
taking it for your own play.

387
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,180
Or ditching him
when he needed you.

388
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,115
So come to your senses.

389
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,749
Give me the book
or your play is ruined.

390
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,353
There it is.

391
00:18:10,353 --> 00:18:12,119
I mean, who would
sacrifice everything

392
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,256
they've worked for just
for their dumb sibling?

393
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:16,490
Dipper would.

394
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,489
Eh?

395
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:18,759
Oh!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

396
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,159
I'm giving you away.

397
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,093
You are a woman now.

398
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:24,262
Waddles, the rings.

399
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:25,363
Wait, what?

400
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:27,663
Oh, no.

401
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:33,369
Get out of my brother's body,
you evil triangle!

402
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,370
Whoa!
Children fighting.

403
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:36,705
I can sell this.

404
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:40,139
Aah!
You can't stop me.

405
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:43,142
I am a being of pure energy
with no weakness.

406
00:18:43,143 --> 00:18:46,812
True, but you're
in Dipper's body.

407
00:18:46,813 --> 00:18:49,280
And I know
all his weaknesses.

408
00:18:49,282 --> 00:18:50,448
What do you mean
"his--?"

409
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,449
Tickle, tickle.

410
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,516
Aah!
Body spasms.

411
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,685
What are these?

412
00:18:56,686 --> 00:18:58,419
A little note
about the human body.

413
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:00,955
You haven't slept
in over 24 hours.

414
00:19:00,954 --> 00:19:02,420
Also,
I got a full night's sleep

415
00:19:02,424 --> 00:19:04,591
and I'm on four
mega shots of Mabel juice.

416
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,426
What is this feeling?

417
00:19:07,426 --> 00:19:09,727
My body is burning.

418
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:12,229
I can't move
these stupid noodle legs.

419
00:19:12,229 --> 00:19:14,529
Curse you,
useless flesh sticks.

420
00:19:14,531 --> 00:19:16,865
Body shutting down,

421
00:19:16,867 --> 00:19:18,834
must scratch,

422
00:19:18,835 --> 00:19:20,501
mosquito bites.

423
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,141
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Hey!

424
00:19:30,876 --> 00:19:32,143
What?

425
00:19:32,144 --> 00:19:33,143
Yes!

426
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:34,578
I'm in my own body

427
00:19:34,579 --> 00:19:38,247
and it's just as
underwhelming as I remember.

428
00:19:39,315 --> 00:19:40,347
Everything hurts.

429
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:46,854
This isn't the last
you'll hear of me.

430
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:48,355
Big things are coming.

431
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,821
You can't stop me.

432
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:51,457
I'm sorry, Gabe.

433
00:20:20,944 --> 00:20:22,545
Don't worry.

434
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:24,883
I've seen enough movies
to know this is the part

435
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:25,882
where the audience thinks

436
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:28,649
it was all part of the show
and loves it.

437
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:30,484
Cue applause!

438
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:39,657
Gabe!

439
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:41,592
Stick around
for the wrap party?

440
00:20:41,594 --> 00:20:43,594
We got mini quiches.

441
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:45,529
Don't speak to me, Mabel.

442
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:47,798
You've made a mockery
of my art form.

443
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,263
Let's go, my loves.

444
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:53,935
Did he just make out
with his puppets?

445
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:56,638
I might have dodged
a bullet there.

446
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:02,541
Mabel,
I'm sorry about all this.

447
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:04,476
It's my fault
your puppets got ruined.

448
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:06,243
Well,
one of them survived.

449
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,212
And she has something
to say to you.

450
00:21:08,212 --> 00:21:10,312
I'm sorry, Dipper.

451
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:13,717
I spent all week
obsessing over a dumb guy.

452
00:21:13,716 --> 00:21:17,417
But the dumb guy I should
have cared about was you.

453
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,252
Mystery twins.

454
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:21,722
Mystery twins.

455
00:21:23,223 --> 00:21:24,889
What did
Bill do to my hand?

456
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:27,758
Nothing
a little sleep can't fix.

457
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:30,895
Come on, bro bro,
let's go home.

458
00:21:30,894 --> 00:21:32,694
Seriously, I need to
go to the hospital.

459
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:34,363
Hey, Dipper.

460
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:37,733
What did one sock puppet say
to the other sock puppet?

461
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:38,766
I don't know, Mabel.

462
00:21:38,768 --> 00:21:39,834
What?

463
00:21:39,835 --> 00:21:42,702
You look like
you could use a hand.

464
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,740
That joke
was really something.

465
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,942
Yeah, something terrible.
