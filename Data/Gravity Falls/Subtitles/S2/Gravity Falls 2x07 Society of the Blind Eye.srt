Good night, tiny men stealing my pie.

7
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:22,334
Wait. What?!

8
00:00:22,336 --> 00:00:24,602
Lift with your knees. No, your knees.

9
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:27,272
If I go one more hour without eating,

10
00:00:27,274 --> 00:00:29,574
I'm gonna resort to cannibalism.

11
00:00:29,976 --> 00:00:31,009
Ma'am.

12
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,345
Little magic men.

13
00:00:33,347 --> 00:00:35,847
What does it mean? What do I do?

14
00:00:37,183 --> 00:00:40,018
Yes, hi.
I'd like to report something.

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,853
I'm at Greasey's Diner.

16
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:43,621
You won't believe what I've witnessed.

17
00:00:43,623 --> 00:00:46,491
It's unbelievable.
It's indescribable.

18
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:48,326
It's...

19
00:00:50,029 --> 00:00:52,430
It is unseen.

20
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:58,937
Well, back to pie.

21
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:02,540
<i>I was this close to eating you, Steve.</i>

22
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:50,188
All right, author, who are you?

23
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:54,259
Who are...
Bleccch!

24
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:55,693
Not again.

25
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:59,597
Hey, bro-bro, look what I got.

26
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,666
Yay, a filthy green bottle.

27
00:02:01,668 --> 00:02:05,103
It's a bottle message
from Mermando, remember?

28
00:02:05,105 --> 00:02:08,106
He was part fish, part shirtless guy.

29
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:10,575
What if he wants
to get back together?

30
00:02:10,577 --> 00:02:15,513
- I wouldn't get your hopes up, Mabel.
- Too late. Hopes are way, way up!

31
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,121
"Dear Mabel..."
So far so good.

32
00:02:23,123 --> 00:02:26,591
"it is with a heavy heart..."
So far, so good.

33
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:30,128
"that I must inform you,
I'm getting married"?!

34
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,629
And there it is.

35
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:34,299
"In order to prevent
an undersea civil war,

36
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:37,635
arranged wedding,
Queen of the Manatees..."

37
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:41,739
And she's so beautiful.
This can't be happening.

38
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:44,576
Oh, Mabel, you'll get
over him eventually.

39
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,578
You don't understand, Dipper.

40
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,081
On my first day here, I made
this page for summer romances.

41
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,583
Look at my luck.

42
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,985
<i>Turned out to be gnomes, child psycho,</i>

43
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,254

44
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:58,156
<i>And now...</i>

45
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,059
<i>I wish I could just
forget about them forever.</i>

46
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:03,094
Hey, if it's any consolation,

47
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:04,996
my summer mission isn't
a huge success either.

48
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,398
I'm still trying to find
the author of this journal.

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,202
With his laptop smashed,
I've lost any lead in finding him.

50
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:13,505
Wait a minute.
Dipper, look!

51
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:15,640
- Through your bottle?
- Just do it.

52
00:03:18,344 --> 00:03:20,211
<i>"McGucket Labs."</i>

53
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:21,779
Wait. Old man McGucket?

54
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:25,483
- Dipper, you don't think...
- It couldn't be...

55
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:30,188
<i>Doesn't make any sense, unless...
this matches with this.</i>

56
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,623
<i>Then this goes over here.</i>

57
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,192
And then the name...
so that would mean

58
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,594
Old man McGucket wrote the journal?!

59
00:03:39,498 --> 00:03:41,699

Ugh! I can't get that
terrible song out of my head.

64
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:53,411
Oh, you mean "Straight Blanchin' "
by Li'l Big Dawg?

65
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:54,679
It's the catchiest song of the summer.

66
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:58,416
What is blanchin'?
Rappers can't just make up words.

67
00:03:58,418 --> 00:04:00,118
Rappers are visionaries, Wendy.

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,621
If they told me to eat my
own pants, I would do it.

69
00:04:03,623 --> 00:04:05,623
<i>♪ Eat your own pants,

70
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:08,221

Ta-ta-da.

71
00:04:08,256 --> 00:04:10,662
Wendy, Soos, we need to
go see old man McGucket.

72
00:04:10,664 --> 00:04:12,830
- We'll explain on the way.
- Gah!

73
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:17,769
Hey, what about work?
Kids!

74
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:19,804
Why is Soos eating his own pants?

75
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,141
<i>Old man McGucket, are you here?</i>

76
00:04:23,143 --> 00:04:25,577
<i>Here, hillbilly, billy, billy, billy.</i>

77
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:31,115
Took an hour to think of
this, but it was worth it.

78
00:04:31,117 --> 00:04:32,550
<i>Ha!</i>

79
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:37,622

00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:41,559
McSuckit.
They got me good.

81
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,227
Visitors!

82
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,597
Come, come.
Pull up some rusty metal.

83
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:48,099
You're just in time for my
hourly turf war with the hillbilly

84
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,734
what lives in my mirror.

85
00:04:49,736 --> 00:04:52,236
Quit starin' at me when I bathe!

86
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:55,740
You can drop the act, McGucket.
I know you're the author.

87
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:58,176
You studied the mysteries of
this town and wrote this book.

88
00:04:58,178 --> 00:05:01,245
Dude, you're the genius Dipper's
been searching for all summer.

89
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:05,583
Uh, genius?
I'm no genius.

90
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,586
I never done nothin'
worthwhile in my life.

91
00:05:08,588 --> 00:05:11,723
Everyone knows I'm no good to nobody.

92
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,658
I can't remember what I used to be,

93
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,161
but I must've been a big
failure to end up like this.

94
00:05:17,163 --> 00:05:19,731
But the laptop has your name on it.

95
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,533
What about this book?
Are you sure you didn't write it?

96
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,670
- Here, look closely.
- I told you, I don't recall.

97
00:05:25,672 --> 00:05:32,143

00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:36,714
Robes. The men. My mind.

100
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:39,384
- They did something.
- Who did?

101
00:05:39,386 --> 00:05:41,686
I... oh, I don't recall.

102
00:05:41,688 --> 00:05:43,588
Oh, you poor old man.

103
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,691
No wonder your mind's all

104
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:48,760
You've been through something intense.

105
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:52,296
What if McGucket learned something
he wasn't supposed to know,

106
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,832
and someone, or something,
messed with his mind?

107
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:56,901
We've got to get to the bottom of this.

108
00:05:56,903 --> 00:05:59,837
Think, dude. What is the
earliest thing you can remember?

109
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,207
Uh, this is, I think.

110
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:04,776
<i>The history museum.</i>

111
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,744

115
00:06:15,488 --> 00:06:17,555
I'll buy you a new one.

116

Hello? Anyone here?

117
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:25,496
All right, keep your eyes peeled
for anything suspicious.

118
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:27,765
Mabel, are you okay?

119
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,401
You just walked by a
cat without petting it.

120
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:31,969
Oh, Wendy, everything I look at

121
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:34,605
reminds me of my failed romances.

122
00:06:34,607 --> 00:06:38,743
That formaldehyde heart.
That romantic diorama.

123
00:06:38,745 --> 00:06:42,447
Even this poster of my
most recent ex-crush.

124
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,751
- Aw, come on!
- So your last memory was here.

125
00:06:46,753 --> 00:06:49,287
- Anything coming back?
- Guys, look!

126
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,659
<i>Hey, who's there?</i>

127
00:06:57,863 --> 00:07:01,399
Well, kettle my corn.
He vanish-ified.

128
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:06,337
It doesn't make sense.
Where did he go?

129
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:10,508
I feel like all these eyeballs
are a-watchin' me.

130
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,778
Wait.
They are.

131
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,847
Move aside.

132
00:07:25,357 --> 00:07:28,526
- Jackpot!
- A secret passageway.

133
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:29,927
We'll have to be stealthy.

134
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:31,896
I'll hambone a message
if there's trouble.

135
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:36,768
I have no idea what that means.

136
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:52,784
Who is the subject of our meeting?

137
00:07:54,387 --> 00:07:55,953
<i>This woman.</i>

138
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:00,358
Lazy Susan?

139
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,627
What is it that you have seen?

140
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:03,995
<i>Speak!</i>

141
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:07,431
Uh, well, uh, I was leaving the diner,

142
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,868
and I saw these little bearded doodads,

143
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,437
and I was, like, "whaaaa?"

144
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,608
There, there.
You won't be "like whaaaa"

145
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,310
for much longer.

146
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:22,647
What is that gizmo?
It looks like a hair dryer.

147
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,482
Are you guys barbers?

148
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:32,757
Lazy Susan, what do you
know of little bearded men?

149
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:35,927
My mind is clear, thanks to
the Society of the Blind Eye.

150
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:38,763
<i>It is unseen.</i>

151
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:42,667
Oh, my gosh.
They erased lazy Susan's memory.

152
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:53,328
Guys, are you seeing this?
They just wiped lazy Susan's memory.

153
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,230
They should've wiped
off that awful mascara.

154
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:57,532
I think she looks beautiful.

155
00:08:57,534 --> 00:08:59,601
She's doing the best she can, Soos.

156
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:00,702
Whoa, touched a nerve there.

157
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:04,405
Lazy Susan, how do you feel?

158
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:07,609
I feel great!
I can't even remember what was wrong,

159
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:11,379
<i>or what I'm doing here,
or if I'm a man or a woman.</i>

160
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:13,448
Your memories will be safe with us,

161
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,450
buried in the hall of the forgotten.

162
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:16,751
<i>Into the hall of the forgotten.</i>

163
00:09:16,753 --> 00:09:18,753
<i>Into the hall of the forgotten.</i>

164
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:22,256
Good chanting, boys.
Have you been practicing?

165
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,893
Meeting adjourned.

166
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:27,595
<i>- Unsee you later.
- Oh. Unsee you later.</i>

167
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:30,598
<i>- Unsee you later.
- Unsee you later.</i>

168
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:38,239
Amazing.
A secret society of evil mind erasers.

169
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:41,242
I'll bet they erased your
memory a long time ago.

170
00:09:41,244 --> 00:09:43,411
If we could find where your
memories have been hidden,

171
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:47,215
it could be the key to unlocking
all the mysteries of Gravity Falls.

172
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:49,417
All right, Mabel,
Wendy, you two stay here

173
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,252
<i>and make sure those robe
guys don't come back.</i>

174
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:53,855
- Whooo! Girls club.
- Soos, you, me, and McGucket

175
00:09:53,857 --> 00:09:55,857
are gonna go find the
hall of the forgotten.

176
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,425
Whoa!

177
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:58,926
Follow that hat!

178
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,466
<i>Halt! Is someone there?</i>

179
00:10:05,468 --> 00:10:08,436
Aah! What do we do?
Where do we go?

180
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:22,550
Man, these are really poorly made.

181
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:24,218
I could've sworn I heard someone.

182
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,455
Probably just the janitor
kissing that wax settler woman again.

183
00:10:27,457 --> 00:10:30,224
<i>Woof! Remind me to erase
that from my memory.</i>

184
00:10:30,226 --> 00:10:34,629
- Whew!
- There it is. Hurry!

185
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:50,511
<i>Whoa!</i>

186
00:10:50,512 --> 00:10:53,848
Honey fogelin', salt
lickin' skullduggery.

187
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,385
Man, you have got to teach me
some of those old-man swear words.

188
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:00,788
I just don't get it, Wendy.

189
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,558
I hug a lot, I can burp the alphabet,

190
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,493
I have scratch and sniff clothing.

191
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:09,297
- Why does every boy leave me?
- Pfft, who cares? Boys are the worst.

192
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:10,498
You shouldn't get hung up, man.

193
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,800
Maybe I come on too strong, you know?

194
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:15,703
Well, what's your opener?
Pretend I'm a boy.

195
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:18,539
Mmm, testosterone.

196
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:22,028
Hi. I'm Mabel!
I'm 12 and own a pig!

197
00:11:22,063 --> 00:11:23,464
Wanna get married?!

198
00:11:23,499 --> 00:11:26,481
Honestly? That was perfect.

199
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:28,516
You should just forget about guys, man.

200
00:11:28,518 --> 00:11:32,620
Wendy, that's it.
"Forget about guys!"

201
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:35,356
I just need to type "summer
romances" into this thing,

202
00:11:35,358 --> 00:11:37,859
and I won't feel bad about them anymore.

203
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:40,762
Whoa, hold up, Mabel. We don't
even know what that thing does.

204
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:42,430
You could accidentally erase, like,

205
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:44,665
learning to read or breathe or...

206
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:49,470
Or one of those terrible summer songs
you can't get out of your head?

207
00:11:49,472 --> 00:11:51,472
Look at all these tubes.

208
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:53,875
People must've been getting their
memories erased all over town.

209
00:11:53,877 --> 00:11:57,612
Whoa, look at this.

210
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:03,985
<i>Yes, Robbie, what is
it that you have seen?</i>

211
00:12:03,987 --> 00:12:06,387
<i>So I was attacked by
this magic kung-fu guy</i>

212
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:08,756
<i>that was throwing, like,
balls of fire at me.</i>

213
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:11,993
<i>- I kicked his butt, though.
- Robbie, speak honestly.</i>

214
00:12:11,995 --> 00:12:13,528
<i>I was saved by a 12-year-old.</i>

215
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,430
Why are they erasing people's memories?
I still don't get it.

216
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:19,834
Looky, fellers.
It's those words what people call me.

217
00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:22,670
Oh, dude, your memories.
We did it.

218
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,405
Grabby grabby.

219
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:28,376
I got it!

220
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:35,449
I don't know, Mabel. Are you
really sure this is a good idea?

221
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,385
All ideas are good ideas.

222
00:12:37,387 --> 00:12:39,654
Do you hear that?

223
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:44,525
The alarm in my brain
is a-ringin' again. Ah!

224
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:47,528
Halt! Who's there?

225
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,626
- Oh, no!
- Run.

226
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,566
<i>This way!
Get back here!</i>

227
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:54,602
Oh, you've really tarred
it up now, fiddleford.

228
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:56,571
This is all your fault.

229
00:12:56,573 --> 00:13:00,575
Why does my beard have a bandage?
Does that even make sense?

230
00:13:00,577 --> 00:13:02,743
Why has no one pointed that out?

231
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,815
Okay, I think we're safe.

232
00:13:07,817 --> 00:13:11,619
We playing "guess who"?
Dude, I know it's you, Dipper.

233
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,554
Such big, strong hands.

234
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:23,130
You shouldn't have come here.

235
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:25,800
We do not give up our secrets lightly.

236
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:29,737
- Who are you bathrobe-wearing freaks?
- Why are you doing this?

237
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:31,572
What's with your creepy British accent?

238
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:36,110
Well, I suppose we are going
to erase your minds anyway.

239
00:13:36,112 --> 00:13:38,012
<i>Toby Determined?</i>

240
00:13:38,014 --> 00:13:41,148
<i> - Bud Gleeful?
- That farmer guy?</i>

241
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,384
Creepy dude who married a woodpecker?

242
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:46,028
You, too? How's that
marriage goin', by the way?

243
00:13:46,063 --> 00:13:47,088
Oh, great, great.

244
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,023
Not great.

245
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:51,459
And you've never met me before.

246
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:54,395
And if you had, you wouldn't remember.

247
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:55,963
I am Blind Ivan,

248
00:13:55,965 --> 00:14:00,768
and we are
the Society of the Blind Eye.

249
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,537
Formed many years ago by our founder...

250
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,574
our founder... does
anyone remember who he was?

251
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:10,411
We've been usin' that ray on
our own brains an awful lot.

252
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:12,980
Why would you do all this?
What do you have to gain?

253
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,916
As you have no doubt discovered,

254
00:14:14,918 --> 00:14:16,717
<i>Gravity Falls is a town plagued</i>

255
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:18,853
<i>with supernatural strangeness.</i>

256
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:21,822
<i>No one knew how to stop the
things that went bump in the night,</i>

257
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:25,526
so our founder invented
the next best thing...

258
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:27,528
<i>a way for us to forget.</i>

259
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,165
<i>We took it upon ourselves to
help the troubled townsfolk</i>

260
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:34,502
<i>by erasing the memories of the
strange things they've seen.</i>

261
00:14:34,504 --> 00:14:36,537
<i>Now the people of Gravity Falls</i>

262
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:40,574
<i>go about their lives ignorant
and happy, thanks to us.</i>

263
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:44,178
And as a perk, we help ourselves
forget things that trouble us.

264
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,580
Everyone has something
they'd rather forget.

265
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:50,618
In fact, your own sister was
about to use that ray on herself.

266
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,585
Isn't that right?

267
00:14:51,587 --> 00:14:55,990
- Mabel? Seriously?
- Maybe...

268
00:14:55,992 --> 00:14:57,625
Don't you see? This is ruining lives.

269
00:14:57,627 --> 00:14:59,627
What about old man McGucket?

270
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:02,663
He lives in a hut and talks
to animals, thanks to you.

271
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:03,764
Don't you feel bad about that?

272
00:15:03,766 --> 00:15:05,900
Mmm, maybe a little.

273
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:08,903
But not anymore.

274
00:15:08,905 --> 00:15:11,739
<i>You won't be telling anyone
else what you've learned here.</i>

275
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:14,809
Say good-bye to your summer.

276
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,011
Huh. Guys, if we're
gonna forget everything,

277
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:19,113
I got some stuff I
wanna get off my chest.

278
00:15:19,115 --> 00:15:21,582
Mabel, for half the summer,
I thought your name was Maple,

279
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:23,818
like the syrup.
No one corrected me.

280
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,220
I only love some of my stuffed animals,

281
00:15:26,222 --> 00:15:28,622
and the guilt is killing me!

282
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:31,726
Sometimes I use big words and I
don't actually know what they mean.

283
00:15:31,728 --> 00:15:33,794
I mean, I'm supposed
to be the smart guy.

284
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:35,596
If I'm not the smart guy, who am I?

285
00:15:35,598 --> 00:15:39,066
Okay, I'm not actually laid back.
I'm stressed, like, 24/7.

286
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:40,601
Have you met my family?

287
00:15:44,272 --> 00:15:47,041
Oh, stop being a bunch of babies.

288
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,677
Owie!

289
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:51,846
<i>McGucket?!</i>

290
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:54,281
I raided the mining display for weapons.

291
00:15:54,283 --> 00:15:56,584
Now fight like a hillbilly, fellers.

292
00:15:59,187 --> 00:16:01,022
Nobody better mess.

293
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:04,525
They know too much.
Don't let them escape!

294
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:07,028
Get this song outta your head.

295
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,797
Dysentery's gonna get you, dawg.

296
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:12,566
McGucket's memory tube!

297
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:13,534
Oh, no, you don't.

298
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:17,487
Mabel, catch.

299
00:16:18,807 --> 00:16:21,308
I'll take that, thank you.

300
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,010
Give it up, boy.

301
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:26,233
You're no match for the
unstoppable power of... Ah!

302
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:29,216
That's right, I don't
wear nothin' under my robe.

303
00:16:29,218 --> 00:16:31,218
Not gonna apologize for that.

304
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,621
Maybe y'all should apologize
for bein' a bunch of prudes.

305
00:16:33,623 --> 00:16:34,755
<i>Eww!!</i>

306
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:36,924
Well, time to erase that forever.

307
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:39,293
- Give me that tube.
- Never!

308
00:16:42,864 --> 00:16:45,166
That memory belongs to McGucket.

309
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:47,568
The society's secrets belong to us.

310
00:16:53,008 --> 00:16:54,742
End of the line.

311
00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:57,378
By tomorrow, this will
all seem like a bad dream.

312
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,348
Say good-bye to your precious memories.

313
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:05,586
No!!

314
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:10,257
McGucket, you took a bullet for me.

315
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:12,760
Oh, my gosh! Are you okay?

316
00:17:12,762 --> 00:17:14,628
Okay as I'll ever be.

317
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,830
What?

318
00:17:15,832 --> 00:17:20,301
Why... isn't... this... working?

319
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:22,903
Hit me with your best shot, baldy.

320
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:25,606
My mind's been gone for 30-odd years.

321
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:28,342
You can't break what's already broken.

322
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:34,736
Say good night, Sally.

323
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,224
Unhand us!

324
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:45,726
It isn't so fun being tied up, is it?

325
00:17:45,728 --> 00:17:47,895
- Hey, wanna draw on their faces?
- What?

326
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:50,631
- Tra-la-la-la...
- Hey, stop that!

327
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:52,900
That's not funny.

328
00:17:52,902 --> 00:17:56,070
- It's pretty funny.
- It's, like, objectively funny.

329
00:17:56,072 --> 00:18:00,708
We'll have our revenge.
We'll never forget what you've done.

330
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,044
Oh, I think you just might.
Say cheese.

331
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,652
Thanks for visiting the museum
for gold miner appreciation night.

332
00:18:11,654 --> 00:18:14,155
Be sure to tip the gold
miner on your way out.

333
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:18,225
I'm sorry, but what's my name?
Where am I?

334
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,728
Oh, might have overdone that one.

335
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:23,364
Your name is Toot-toot McBumbersnazzle.

336
00:18:23,366 --> 00:18:27,401
You're a traveling banjo minstrel,
with a song in your heart

337
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:29,203
and funny tattoos on your head.

338
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:33,407
Yes, I am Toot-toot
McBumbersnazzle. Cheers!

339

♪ Toot-toot is my name ♪

340
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:39,847
All right, McGucket.
Are you ready to see your memories?

341
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:41,081
Find out who you really are?

342
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:45,052
I'm not so sure.
What if I don't like what I see?

343
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:47,454
We've come all this way. Go on.

344
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:55,996
<i>My name is
Fiddleford Hadron McGucket,</i>

345
00:18:55,998 --> 00:18:57,898
<i>and I wish to unsee what I have seen.</i>

346
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:00,534
Sweet sarsaparilla.

347
00:19:00,536 --> 00:19:03,470
<i>For the past year, I have
been working as an assistant</i>

348
00:19:03,472 --> 00:19:04,972
<i>for a visiting researcher.</i>

349
00:19:04,974 --> 00:19:06,874
<i>He has been cataloguing his findings</i>

350
00:19:06,876 --> 00:19:08,809
<i>about Gravity Falls in
a series of journals.</i>

351
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:12,313
<i>I helped him build a machine
which he believed had the potential</i>

352
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:14,715
<i>to benefit all mankind,
but something went wrong.</i>

353
00:19:14,717 --> 00:19:18,452
<i>I decided to quit the project.
But I lie awake at night,</i>

354
00:19:18,454 --> 00:19:20,487
<i>haunted by the thoughts
of what I've done.</i>

355
00:19:20,489 --> 00:19:23,241
<i>I believe I have invented a
machine that can permanently</i>

356
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:25,993
<i>erase these memories from
my mind. Test subject one.</i>

357
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:28,395
<i>Fiddleford.</i>

358
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:31,065
<i>It worked!
I can't recall a thing.</i>

359
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,400
<i>I call it the Society of the Blind Eye.</i>

360
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:37,204
<i>We will help those who want to
forget by erasing their bad memories.</i>

361
00:19:37,206 --> 00:19:39,306
<i>Today, I came across
a colony of little men.</i>

362
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:43,210
<i>Very disturbing.
I would like to forget seeing this.</i>

363
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:45,446
<i>I accidentally hit
another car in town today.</i>

364
00:19:45,448 --> 00:19:47,414
<i>I feel terri-bibble.
Terrible.</i>

365
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,817
<i>I've been forgetting words lately.</i>

366
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:51,885
<i>I wonder if there are any
negative side effects...</i>

367
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:55,222
<i>I saw something in the
lake, something big!</i>

368
00:19:55,224 --> 00:19:59,126
<i>My hair's been a-fallin' out, so
I got this hat from a scarecrow.</i>

369
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:00,928
<i>Hey, are my pants on backwards?</i>

370
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:13,907
Oh, McGucket. I'm so sorry.

371
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,345
Aw, hush. You kids helped me get my

372
00:20:17,346 --> 00:20:19,380
memories back, just like you said.

373
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:22,383
But did you want those memories back?

374
00:20:22,385 --> 00:20:25,519
After all these years,
I finally know who I am.

375
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:28,489
Maybe I messed up in the
past, but now that I've seen

376
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,458
what happened, I can begin
to put myself together again.

377
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:36,263
Still don't know what that means.

378
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:38,365
So, wait, you weren't the
author, but you worked with him.

379
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:39,900
Do you remember who he was?

380
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:43,237
It's beginning to come back,
but I need more time.

381
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:46,373
And reading glasses. Heck!

382
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,575
I got some rememberin' to do.

383
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:50,844
So, Mabel, you still wanna erase

384
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,514
those failed summer romances?

385
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,322
You know, no one likes
having bad memories,

386
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:05,326
but maybe it's better to remember
the bad things and learn from them

387
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:08,195
than to go all denial
crazy trying to forget.

388
00:21:08,197 --> 00:21:10,397
That's some mature
junk right there, Mabel.

389
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:12,466
Yep. Miss mature.
That's me.

390
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,335
Hey, you wanna help me
vandalize this picture

391
00:21:14,337 --> 00:21:17,137
<i>- of my jerky ex-crush?
- Ooh, yeah! - Yeah I never liked that guy.</i>

392
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,239
<i>Wait, let's give him buck teeth.</i>

393
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:23,322
Hey, you know what?

394
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,612
Going on this big adventure
actually made me get

395
00:21:25,614 --> 00:21:28,349
- that stupid song out of my head.
- Nice.

396
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:32,319
<i>- # Am I blanchin', girl, we blanchin' #
- Oh, come on!</i>

397
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:34,855
It's all so familiar.

398
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:37,558
It's almost like I can remember.

399
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:41,261
All right, you're getting closer.

400
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:45,933
Every day, it's getting stronger.

401
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:50,270
Yes! Ah!

402
00:21:51,439 --> 00:21:53,440
I don't care if it's dangerous.

403
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:54,975
I don't care how long it takes.

404
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:59,146
I'm gonna pull this off, and
no one's gonna get in my way.
