1
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,242
What do we do,
Chadley?

2
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,643
I thought
they were dead.

3
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,245
Far worse,
Trixandra.

4
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,882
They're nearly almost
dead but not quite!

5
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,722
Man, these movies
are a lot less scary

6
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,257
when you've actually
fought real zombies.

7
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:26,291
They're slow.

8
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:28,260
Just power-walk
away from them.

9
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,762
How much you want
to bet that guy dies first?

10
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,665
<i>Aah! My face
is being eaten a lot.</i>

11
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,169
Chadley ain't
pretty no more.

12
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:39,905
One second.

13
00:00:39,907 --> 00:00:42,074
Ugh, another text
from Robbie.

14
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,575
Oh, yeah, Robbie.

15
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:46,578
How's, uh,
how's all that going?

16
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,713
Ugh, I'm over him.

17
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,281
I just wish
he was over me.

18
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:50,816
Just look
at these texts.

19
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:51,884
Winky frown?

20
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,185
What does
that even mean?

21
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,720
And you're not...

22
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,756
not like, seeing
any other guys or...

23
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,591
Of course I am.

24
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:00,759
Meet my new
boyfriend, dude.

25
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,595
Right, right.

26
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,064
So...

27
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,966
So, you know, I was wondering
if maybe you wanted to,

28
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:10,269
I mean, if--if you
and me would ever,

29
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:12,971
I mean,
if maybe you...

30
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,576
Hmm, wanted to join me and Mabel
on this mystery hunt tomorrow.

31
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,811
Conspiracy stuff
and all that.

32
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:19,845
That's all.

33
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,080
Yeah, dude.

34
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,581
I love doing junk
with friends.

35
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:23,749
Yo, Chadley,
watch out!

36
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,219
Yeah.
'Cause that's what we are.

37
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,620
It's all we'll ever be...

38
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,027
Friends.

39
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,229
Dude, you're
lying on my bra.

40
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,639
Hey, easy with that.

41
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,940
It's genuine plastic.

42
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,275
And re-pave
the cracks

43
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,943
in the parking lot
while you're at it.

44
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:26,345
I don't want my car
falling into China.

45
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:30,182
Mr. Pines, what exactly
caused all this damage?

46
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,683
I need to write
a report.

47
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,252
Uh, a big woodpecker.

48
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,421
Keep the change.

49
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,393
I'm winking under
my eye patch.

50
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,661
Works for me.

51
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,365
Now where'd
those kids run off to?

52
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,703
Thank you all
for coming.

53
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,172
Hey, when there's
a mystery,

54
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:56,141
you can count
on your sister-ee.

55
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:57,342
That's an amazing rhyme.

56
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,311
"When you want
some good--

57
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:01,446
When, when
you need a Soos..."

58
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:03,949
You've-- Oh, gosh.
I don't know.

59
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:07,319
We're here to solve the number
one mystery in Gravity Falls.

60
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,988
Who wrote this journal?

61
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:13,058
Thirty years ago the author
vanished without a trace,

62
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,993
but according
to this new clue,

63
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:17,696
we may have found
his secret hiding place.

64
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:21,133
We find that author, we learn
the answers to everything.

65
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,936
We just need to figure out
a way to get down there...

66
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,370
Chop it down,
dudes.

67
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,438
Wendy.

68
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,207
Oh, hey.
You came.

69
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,242
Dude,
I'm so stoked about this.

70
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:32,411
I've been wanting to go
adventuring with you guys.

71
00:03:32,413 --> 00:03:34,446
Sure beats picking up
after my dad at home.

72
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:35,714
Ow!

73
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,015
Ow!
Ow!

74
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:38,016
Who put that wall there?

75
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,084
Ow!

76
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:41,320
Thanks
for the invite, man.

77
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:46,491
Any time you want to--
I'm-- We're always-- Us.

78
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,493
Uh-oh.

79
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,329
Inviting Wendy
on our mission?

80
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:52,497
Me thinks
there's romance afoot.

81
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,166
No, look Mabel.

82
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,335
I've thought this through,
and I'm over Wendy.

83
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,070
I've looked at it
from every angle,

84
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,471
and that thing
was going nowhere.

85
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,106
I know what matters
to me now,

86
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,175
and it's finding
the author of this journal.

87
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,843
Ha!
You're over Wendy?

88
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:08,146
Allow me to put
on my skepticles.

89
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:09,147
Bwoop.

90
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,315
I've moved on, Mabel.

91
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:11,817
You should, too.

92
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,986
Skepticles.

93
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,454
Hey, is it just me

94
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,389
or does that branch
kind of look like a lever?

95
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,957
Huh. Yeah.

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,792
But how do we
get up there?

97
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:22,961
Seems like
we'd need, like, a ladder.

98
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,130
Or, like,
ladder shoes?

99
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:26,865
Yeah, ladder shoes.

100
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,400
I'll get Soos
to draw up a prototype.

101
00:04:30,471 --> 00:04:31,403
Boosh.

102
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:33,005
Whoa!

103
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:34,172
Oh, yeah.

104
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,173
My dad used to made me compete

105
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,975
in these lumberjack games
when I was a kid.

106
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,443
Guess I kind
of ruled at it.

107
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,313
Whoa, whoa.
What is that?

108
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,350
Whoa.

109
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,952
Hey, hey.
Oh, no!

110
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:57,296
All right, guys.
This is it.

111
00:04:57,298 --> 00:05:01,166
Remember, whatever happens
down there, we tell no one.

112
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,006
Now, who wants
to go first?

113
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,946
Whoa.

114
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,181
Dude!

115
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,817
This is
so stupid cool.

116
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,119
It's like a fallout
shelter or something.

117
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,588
It must have belonged
to the author.

118
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,457
This is going
over my bed.

119
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,393
My face feels fuzzy.

120
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,028
This is incredible.

121
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,331
It's like he was
preparing for a disaster.

122
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,932
But what
kind of disaster

123
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,435
would need supplies
for over sixty years?

124
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,938
Oh, my gosh.

125
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,473
A Shmez dispenser.

126
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,908
I remember these things.

127
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,309
What's that?

128
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,346
Yes, I will have some
of your old-timey face food.

129
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,415
Ew. Dusty.

130
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,186
Wait, guys.

131
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,388
I think this can
was opened recently.

132
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,291
The author might
still be alive, down here.

133
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:00,525
Wait a minute.

134
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,068
I think I know where
he might have gone.

135
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,203
Whoa.

136
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,440
Whoa!

137
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:17,642
Oh, man.

138
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:20,078
Was this place built
in the past or the future.

139
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,214
Yeah.
This room is way creepy.

140
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,483
Not as creepy as Dipper's
Internet history.

141
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,384
Hey-oh!

142
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,993
What's going on, dudes?

143
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:42,367
It's hard to be scared
with caterpillars on your face.

144
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,338
Wall things.

145
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,273
Crazy wall things
happening right now.

146
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,175
Ugh.
It won't stop.

147
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,345
Dipper, what do we do?

148
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:54,579
Uh. Uh.

149
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,181
Come on, come on.

150
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,551
Find these four symbols.
Quick.

151
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:00,719
Everybody step on one.

152
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,021
One!

153
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,390
Two!

154
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,491
Three!

155
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:10,429
Four!

156
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:16,201
Run for it!

157
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,574
Yes! Yes!

158
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:24,476
That was...

159
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:26,211
That was nuts.

160
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:27,712
You ruled
back there, man.

161
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:29,247
Thanks.

162
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,516
Get a load of this
crazy surveillance room.

163
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,517
Check it out, dudes.

164
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,654
Soos.
Soos.

165
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:37,322
That is hilarious.

166
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,324
Hey, Bro,
you forgot your vest.

167
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,461
What the--

168
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,697
"Dear Wendy.

169
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,532
I've always had
a crush on--"

170
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,368
Oh, my gosh.

171
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,503
Hey, Dipper!

172
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:53,605
Look what I found.

173
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,074
What are you--
Give me that.

174
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,409
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it!

175
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:59,377
You're not over
Wendy at all.

176
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,347
And you were going
to tell her today?

177
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:04,216
No.
I changed my mind.

178
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:06,451
It's a bad idea,
I'd just embarrass myself,

179
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,320
and then I'd be another guy
she hates, like Robbie.

180
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,455
Dipper, you should
just tell her already.

181
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,291
One way or another,
you'll feel better afterwards.

182
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,461
Look, Mabel, I can't tell her
no matter how much I want to.

183
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:17,562
So just drop it, okay.

184
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,264
Dude.

185
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,399
Dipper, you got to check out
this weird metal closet.

186
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:24,469
I am a robot.
I have a metal closet.

187
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,470
Coming.

188
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:27,138
This never happened.

189
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,342
<i>He wants to tell her
but he's scared.</i>

190
00:08:30,344 --> 00:08:32,444
<i>Maybe he needs
a little push.</i>

191
00:08:32,446 --> 00:08:35,480
<i>Good idea, Mabel.
Thanks, Mabel.</i>

192
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,216
Brother,
whatever happens,

193
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,485
I just want you
to know something.

194
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,087
This is
for your own good.

195
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,455
What?
Aah.

196
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:46,057
What the--

197
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,459
Mabel!
Let us out!

198
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:49,127
Oh, I'll let you out,
Dipper.

199
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,529
As soon as
you tell Wendy

200
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:52,697
that thing you've been
wanting to tell her!

201
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,499
You'll thank me
for this later.

202
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,433
What is she
talking about?

203
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:57,035
Nothing.

204
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,237
Mabel's just been eating
raw sugar packets again.

205
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:02,374
That's besides the point.

206
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,242
Let me out right now!

207
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,545
Ugh,
where are the lights?

208
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,659
Whoa.

209
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,327
A hidden lab.

210
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,696
Maybe the author did
experiments down here.

211
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,334
Uh, what do you think
dug all these tunnels?

212
00:09:29,336 --> 00:09:30,368
Let's hope
we don't find out.

213
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,542
Mabel!
Open up for real!

214
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:39,477
There's a monster in here!

215
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:43,381
The only monsters are
your own inner demons, Dipper.

216
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:45,183
That is so wise.

217
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:46,484
Dipper.

218
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,286
Just say whatever
Mabel wants you to say

219
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,421
so she'll let us
out of here.

220
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:52,624
Come on, Dipper.
Now is the time, Bro!

221
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,227
Wendy, I-- I...

222
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,497
I'm gonna find
another way out.

223
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:00,565
Wait, what?

224
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,867
Dude,
where are we going?

225
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:08,740
Whoa.

226
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,178
What do we do?
I don't know.

227
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,485
Back!

228
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,654
Back, you heinous beast!

229
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,263
Well, I just ripped out
a monster's tongue.

230
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,766
It's you.

231
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:36,267
Hurry now.

232
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,404
I scared it off,
but it will regenerate.

233
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:41,406
I wasn't
expecting guests.

234
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,808
I've been down here
for a very long time.

235
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,877
Years.
Weeks maybe.

236
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,479
I miss orange juice.

237
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:48,780
You don't understand.

238
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,281
You're the guy
I've been looking for!

239
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:51,349
He's the guy?

240
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,417
Wendy,
it's the guy!

241
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,585
The guy?

242
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:55,687
I've got, like,
a jillion questions.

243
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,355
Why did you write
the journals?

244
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,591
Who was after you?
Why did you build this bunker?

245
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:02,661
My boy, I'd love
to discuss this in time.

246
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,496
But we have more
pressing matters.

247
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:05,897
It's one
of my experiments.

248
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,465
A shapeshifter.

249
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,768
Able to take the form
of anyone or anything it sees.

250
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,271
It broke free
from a cage of solid steel.

251
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,908
I've gone half-crazy trying
to catch the creature alone.

252
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,210
But now you're here.

253
00:11:19,212 --> 00:11:20,812
Will you help me catch it?

254
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:25,617
Sure are taking
their time in there.

255
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,553
Hey, do I look smarter
with this coat and briefcase?

256
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,355
I feel like
I look smarter.

257
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,424
Razzle dazzle!

258
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,225
Look at this tubey thing.

259
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,728
Frozen.

260
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,862
Unfrozen.

261
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,930
Frozen.

262
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,198
Unfrozen.

263
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,533
What's this biz?

264
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:44,436
"Experiment number two-ten:
The Shapeshifter."

265
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,670
Shapeshifter?

266
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,505
Uh, dude,
didn't Dipper say

267
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,574
there was a monster
in there with them?

268
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:51,376
I thought
he was just joking.

269
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,778
You know, Dipper's
jokes are terrible!

270
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,879
Dipper!

271
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,316
Come in.
Come in.

272
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,784
I apologize
for the state of things.

273
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:03,321
I don't get many
non-mole people visitors.

274
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,391
Now the beast must have some
weakness that we can exploit.

275
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:07,625
I used to have
my research on him,

276
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,895
but alas, I lost my journals
so many years ago.

277
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,363
Did you say journals?

278
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,465
Dude, I found
one of them.

279
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:14,833
It's how I tracked
you down here.

280
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:17,902
What?
Could it be?

281
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:21,473
My boy, I can't
express my gratitude.

282
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,241
Oh, yes.

283
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,643
After all these years.

284
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:29,447
Wendy!

285
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,949
Oh, it's so dark.

286
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,517
How will we
ever find them?

287
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,885
Leave that to Mabel.

288
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,522
Whoa!
Rad!

289
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,990
Although,
isn't electric clothing

290
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,525
kind of like
a fire hazard?

291
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:41,526
No.

292
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,594
It's a fun hazard.

293
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,529
Now let me light the way!

294
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,765
We're coming
for you dudes.

295
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,835
Yes, yes.

296
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,437
It's all here.

297
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,872
Wendy,
isn't it amazing

298
00:12:53,874 --> 00:12:55,440
we're actually meeting
the real author?

299
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,476
Dipper.
Look.

300
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,416
Uh, you know what?

301
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,485
We should probably
get going.

302
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,420
Can I have my
journal back?

303
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,527
You're not
going anywhere.

304
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,706
How do you like
my true form?

305
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,442
Go on, admit it,
you like it.

306
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,544
You!

307
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:33,678
What did you do
to the real author?

308
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,380
You'll likely
never find him.

309
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,683
That six-fingered nerd hasn't
been himself in thirty years.

310
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:41,052
But I do thank you
for bringing me his journal.

311
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,488
He used to write while
I was in my cage.

312
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,357
So many wonderful
forms to take.

313
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:52,931
We've got to get
that journal back.

314
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,500
Hey, body-snatcher.
Snatch this.

315
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,109
Run! Run! Run!

316
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,472
Oh, dudes.
Dipper! Wendy!

317
00:14:34,474 --> 00:14:35,573
Mabel! Soos!

318
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,408
Wait. Careful.

319
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,411
How do we know they're
not the shapeshifter?

320
00:14:40,413 --> 00:14:43,448
Maybe I am.
Mabel, inspect my shape.

321
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,482
Poke.

322
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,051
Do that again.
Poke.

323
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,621
Even better
the second time.

324
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:51,055
It's definitely them.

325
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,691
Oh, my gosh, Wendy,
you're bleeding.

326
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,460
It's cool.
It's cool.

327
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,461
It's just blood, man.

328
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,395
Don't freak out.

329
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,696
What happened?

330
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,098
We got attacked
by the shapeshifter.

331
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,634
He broke out of his cage,
pretended to the author,

332
00:15:02,636 --> 00:15:03,935
and wants
Dipper's journal.

333
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:06,871
Imagine if he escapes
into town.

334
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:08,673
He could transform
into anything.

335
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,075
We could never trust
anyone ever again.

336
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,110
What do we do?

337
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:13,444
Well.

338
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,979
He took us into his home,
tricked us,

339
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:17,582
and tried
to destroy us.

340
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,584
I say we return
the favor.

341
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,088
Dipper, my boy.

342
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,725
Come out.

343
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,727
I must speak with you!

344
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:35,433
Reveal yourself, you
single-formed human weakling.

345
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,935
Oh, boy, Dipper.

346
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:40,505
That book sure is full
of some great monsters.

347
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:41,606
There you are.

348
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,875
Ooh!
And a new one.

349
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,813
Should I be one?

350
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,214
Or the other.

351
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,582
How about both?

352
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,759
Guys, he's coming!
He's coming!

353
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,761
Now! Now!
Now! Now! Now!

354
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:04,996
It's not working,
dude.

355
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,467
Hey.
Let go.

356
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,601
You leave him alone.

357
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,804
Wendy!

358
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,785
Aah.

359
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,165
Wendy!

360
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,840
Wendy?

361
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,842
No, no, no, no, no!

362
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,076
Can you hear me?
Oh.

363
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,244
Please be okay.
Please be okay!

364
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,217
Oh, no, oh, no!
This is all my fault!

365
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,119
If I had told you when
we were in the closet

366
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:02,720
we wouldn't be
in this mess.

367
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:05,590
But I was too scared and now
you could be hurt or worse

368
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,191
and I never even got
a chance to tell you

369
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:10,528
I'm, like, in love
with you Wendy.

370
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,701
Uh...

371
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,536
Dipper?

372
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,271
Wendy?

373
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,572
Wait.

374
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,875
Then who is--
Look out!

375
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,309
Give me back
that journal!

376
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,811
Never!

377
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,548
Get off me.

378
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,555
Give it back.

379
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,956
It belongs to Dipper.

380
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,091
Hit her with the axe!

381
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,325
Don't listen
to her, Dipper!

382
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,293
She's the shapeshifter!

383
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,561
Ugh!

384
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,196
I don't know who's who!

385
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,297
Give me a sign!

386
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,681
Push him in!

387
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,320
Huh?

388
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,355
Frozen!

389
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,590
Boosh!
Boom!

390
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:18,129
No. No!
Let me out!

391
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,368
Let's get out
of here, dudes.

392
00:18:28,842 --> 00:18:31,676
You think you're so clever,
don't you, Dipper?

393
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,112
But you have no idea
what you're up against.

394
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:36,347
You'll never
find the author.

395
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,348
If you keep digging,

396
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,084
you'll meet a fate worse
than you can imagine.

397
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:43,688
And this will be
the last form you ever take!

398
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:53,030
Good luck
sleeping tonight.

399
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,703
Dude, I think
I'm kind of

400
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:00,171
adventured out
for a little while.

401
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:03,207
My face hurts
from doing this all day.

402
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,811
Yeah, but you got to admit
we're all total heroes.

403
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,413
Hey, who wants to go get
some heroes breakfast, huh?

404
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:11,282
Syrup on cereal!

405
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,351
Mabel,
you're a visionary.

406
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:18,356
Look, Wendy,
about earlier,

407
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,724
in the heat
of the moment

408
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,193
I might have said
some dumb things and--

409
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:24,996
Can't we just pretend
none of that ever happened?

410
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,131
Please.

411
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,400
Dude. Dude.
It's okay.

412
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:32,236
I always kind of knew.

413
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,804
Wait.
You did?

414
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:35,206
Yeah, man.

415
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,807
I mean, you think
I can't hear that stuff

416
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,943
you're constantly
whispering under your breath?

417
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,079
Oh, man.

418
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,247
Listen, Dipper.

419
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:46,050
I'm, like,
super flattered.

420
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,753
But, I'm too old for you.

421
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,688
I mean, you know
that, right?

422
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,123
Ugh.

423
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,759
Mabel said confessing
would make me feel better.

424
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,294
Well, how do you feel?

425
00:19:56,296 --> 00:20:00,431
Anxious. Scared.
Kind of itchy.

426
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,899
Dude.

427
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,234
Don't be itchy, man.

428
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,235
Let me tell you something,

429
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,371
this summer was super
boring until you showed up.

430
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,741
I have more fun with you than,
like, practically anybody else.

431
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:14,312
And if you ever stop being
my friend, I would, like,

432
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:16,981
throw myself
into the bottomless pit.

433
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:19,317
So, things won't
be too awkward now?

434
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,319
I just wrestled
myself, dude.

435
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,087
That was awkward.

436
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,388
If you can handle
that monster,

437
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,424
you can handle
a little awkwardness.

438
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,460
Friends?

439
00:20:29,462 --> 00:20:30,761
Yeah, dude.
Friends.

440
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:38,302
Oh, and hey, Dipper.

441
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,137
See you for movie
night tomorrow.

442
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:41,739
Your place
this time, okay?

443
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:51,515
So, how did it go?

444
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,951
What did you hear?

445
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,786
Everything.
All the time.

446
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:58,089
I'm not here.

447
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,491
Mabel, how can everything
be so amazing

448
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:03,394
and so terrible
all at the same time?

449
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:06,030
I'm sorry for being
so pushy, Dipper.

450
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:07,265
If it's any consolation,

451
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,366
I'm already
working on a list

452
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,468
of your potential
rebound crushes.

453
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,003
Thanks, Mabel.

454
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,940
I'm still bummed

455
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,508
we're no closer
to finding the author guy.

456
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,911
At least I got his sciency coat
and briefcase.

457
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,446
Whoa.
What the--

458
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,182
Soos, that's not a briefcase.
That's a laptop.

459
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:27,285
And a really
busted up one, too.

460
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,287
I bet I could get this thing
fixed up in a few days.

461
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,122
It's gonna take
a lot of duct tape.

462
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,490
This could be
our next clue.

463
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,995
Is it just me,

464
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:39,797
or does Gravity Falls TV
only have the worst movies?

465
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,967
<i>You're watching the Gravity
Falls Bargain Movie Showcase.</i>

466
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,335
<i>Coming up next,</i>

467
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,904
The Widdlest Wampire.

468
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:49,573
The Planet People
of Planet Planet!

469
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:52,176
Help!
My Mummy's a Werewolf!

470
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,412
Attack
of the Exclamation Points!!!

471
00:21:54,414 --> 00:21:56,580
The Man With No Taste.

472
00:21:56,582 --> 00:21:58,382
Ghost Turtle.

473
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:02,286
Help! My Mummy's
a Werewolf Two: This Again.

474
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,021
You want to never watch
this channel again?
