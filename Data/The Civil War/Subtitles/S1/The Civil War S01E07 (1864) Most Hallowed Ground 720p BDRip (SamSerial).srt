00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:15,266
"I REQUIRE ABLE-BODIED MEN
WITH GOOD HORSE AND GUN.

2
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:19,437
"I WISH NONE BUT THOSE WHO
DESIRE TO BE ACTIVELY ENGAGED.

3
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:23,649
"COME ON, BOYS,
IF YOU WANT A HEAP OF FUN

4
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,652
AND TO KILL SOME YANKEES."

5
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,863
NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST.

6
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,118
BEDFORD FORREST'S GRANDDAUGHTER
LIVED HERE IN MEMPHIS.

7
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,411
SHE RECENTLY DIED,

8
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:36,871
AND I GOT TO KNOW HER,

9
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:38,998
AND SHE EVEN LET ME SWING
THE GENERAL'S SABER

10
00:00:39,165 --> 00:00:41,876
AROUND MY HEAD ONCE,
WHICH WAS A GREAT TREAT,

11
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:46,464
AND I HAD THOUGHT A LONG TIME,
AND I CALLED HER AND SAID,

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,301
"I THINK THE WAR PRODUCED
TWO AUTHENTIC GENIUSES.

13
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:52,636
"ONE OF THEM
WAS YOUR GRANDFATHER,

14
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,889
AND THE OTHER
WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN."

15
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,975
AND THERE WAS A SILENCE
AT THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE,

16
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,902
AND SHE SAID,
"WELL, YOU KNOW, IN OUR FAMILY,

17
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,646
WE NEVER THOUGHT MUCH
OF MR. LINCOLN."

18
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,066
SHE DIDN'T LIKE MY
COUPLING HER GRANDFATHER

19
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,903
WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN
ALL THESE YEARS LATER.

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,739
SOUTHERNERS ARE VERY STRANGE
ABOUT THAT WAR.

21
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:28,672
THERE WAS FIGHTING
ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY--

22
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:32,426
AT THE SABINE CROSSROADS NEAR
THE TEXAS-LOUISIANA BORDER

23
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,553
AND DOWN THE RED RIVER,

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,931
ON THE LITTLE BLUE
IN MISSOURI,

25
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:40,684
AT POISON SPRING
AND JENKINS FERRY IN ARKANSAS,

26
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:43,354
AND FAR OUT
IN INDIAN TERRITORY.

27
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,197
BY THE SUMMER OF 1864,

28
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:57,034
THE UNION INITIATIVE
HAD GROUND TO A HALT.

29
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,204
DESPITE ITS POWERFUL
INDUSTRIAL MACHINE,

30
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:03,791
DESPITE INCREASING HARDSHIPS
FOR THE SOUTH,

31
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:07,586
THE NORTH WAS LOSING
CONTROL OF THE WAR.

32
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:09,964
AS THE CASUALTY LISTS
GREW LONGER,

33
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:12,967
OPPOSITION TO THE WAR
INCREASED.

34
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,557
WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN LOOMING,

35
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,518
ABRAHAM LINCOLN NOW KNEW
HE WOULD HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

36
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:25,312
THAT HAD NEVER
BEEN DONE BEFORE--

37
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:28,649
SUBMIT TO A POPULAR ELECTION
DURING CIVIL WAR

38
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:30,234
AND WIN IT.

39
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,196
"THE STRUGGLE WITHIN
AND WITHOUT,"

40
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:36,115
AN ADVISOR TOLD LINCOLN,

41
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,742
"IS FOR
OUR NATIONAL EXISTENCE."

42
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,125
AT PETERSBURG,
ROBERT E. LEE'S ENTRENCHED ARMY

43
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:48,753
CONTINUED TO RESIST
ULYSSES S. GRANT'S

44
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,130
TWO-MONTH-OLD SIEGE.

45
00:02:51,297 --> 00:02:53,424
TO END THE STALEMATE,

46
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,675
UNION TROOPS WERE DIGGING

47
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:58,012
DEEP BENEATH
THE CONFEDERATE LINES.

48
00:02:58,179 --> 00:03:01,056
NORTH OF ATLANTA,
WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN

49
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:03,767
WOULD HAVE TO BLAST THROUGH
AN IMPENETRABLE SYSTEM

50
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,061
OF TRENCHES, BREASTWORKS,
AND PARAPETS

51
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:09,690
TO TAKE THE CITY,
IF HE EVER GOT THERE.

52
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,946
THAT SUMMER, IN THE SWELTERING
MISSISSIPPI HEAT,

53
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,782
CONFEDERATE GENERAL
NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST

54
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,451
WOULD CEMENT HIS REPUTATION

55
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,996
AS THE MOST TERRIFYING CAVALRY
COMMANDER OF THE WAR.

56
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,457
MEANWHILE,
IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY,

57
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,627
A DIMINUTIVE UNION GENERAL,
PHIL SHERIDAN,

58
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,045
WOULD GLEEFULLY WRECK

59
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,048
EVERY FARM AND VILLAGE
HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON,

60
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,676
WHILE IN RICHMOND, JEFFERSON
DAVIS STRUGGLED DESPERATELY

61
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:42,056
TO KEEP THE IDEA
OF THE CONFEDERACY ALIVE.

62
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,475
AT THE END OF THE YEAR,

63
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:46,769
UNION QUARTERMASTER
GENERAL MONTGOMERY MEIGS

64
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,480
WOULD LOSE A SON
AND BRING HIS GRIEF

65
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:52,108
TO THE DOORSTEP
OF ROBERT E. LEE.

66
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,738
BY THE SUMMER OF 1864,

67
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,073
PEOPLE COULD HARDLY REMEMBER

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,327
THAT THERE HAD EVER BEEN
A TIME WITHOUT WAR,

69
00:04:03,494 --> 00:04:06,747
AND MANY DID NOT BELIEVE
IT WOULD EVER END.

70
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,125
"DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,

71
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,837
"THE TIDE IS SETTING
STRONGLY AGAINST US.

72
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,755

"AND THE IMPRESSION
THAT WE ARE FIGHTING,

76
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:11,145
NOT FOR UNION, BUT FOR
THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY."

77
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:12,563
HEN RY RAYMOND,

78
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,190
CHAIRMAN,
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE.

79
00:05:24,742 --> 00:05:27,578
THE SIEGE OF
PETERSBURG WENT ON.

80
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:30,622
MORALE HAD NEVER
BEEN LOWER.

81
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,584
"WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE
WARS LIKE THIS AGAIN,"

82
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:36,170
ONE UNION SOLDIER SAID.

83
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,172
IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS,

84
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:41,175
FROM THE WILDERNESS
TO SPOTSYLVANIA,

85
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,177
COLD HARBOR TO PETERSBURG,

86
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:46,597
GRANT HAD NEARLY
DESTROYED HIS ARMY.

87
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,807
"THE PEOPLE ARE WILD
FOR PEACE,"

88
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,601

NEVERTHELESS,
140,000 SOLDIERS

91
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:08,369
RE-ENLISTED
IN THE UNION ARMY.

92
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,205
PRIDE AND PATRIOTISM
HAD MUCH TO DO WITH IT

93
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,999
AND A DESIRE TO SEE
THE THING THROUGH,

94
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,211
BUT SO DID THE PROMISE
OF A MONTH'S FURLOUGH.

95
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,838

WROTE ONE SOLDIER,

00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,924
SOMEONE SAID THAT HE WAS
BORN TO BE A SOLDIER

172
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,345
THE WAY JOHN KEATS
WAS BORN TO BE A POET.

173
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:41,892
HE HAD SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES
THAT, WHEN YOU TRANSLATE THEM,

174
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,353
THEY FIT RIGHT
INTO THE ARMY MANUAL.

175
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,773
WHEN HE SAID, "GET THERE FIRST
WITH THE MOST MEN,"

176
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,025
HE'S SAYING,
"TAKE THE INTERIOR LINES

177
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,236
AND BRING SUPERIOR FORCE
TO BEAR."

178
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,821
HE HAD SOME VERY
SIMPLE THINGS.

179
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:58,408
HE USED TO SAY,
"HIT THEM ON THE END"

180
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,827
AND HE USED TO SAY,
"KEEP UP THE SKEER."

181
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,954
AND THESE ARE ALL
GOOD MILITARY PRINCIPLES

182
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,040
EXPRESSED IN FORREST'S
OWN WAY.

183
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:08,126
AND HE WAS ABLE TO LOOK
AT A PIECE OF GROUND

184
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,836
AND SEE HOW TO USE IT.

185
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,506
HE HAD A MARVELOUS SENSE
OF TOPOGRAPHY.

186
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:15,509
HE COULD SEE
THE KEY TO A POSITION

187
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,302
AND KNOW WHERE TO HIT.

188
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,138
"FORREST,"

189
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,848
WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN
LATER SAID,

190
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,851
"WAS THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN
OUR CIVIL WAR PRODUCED

191
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,020
ON EITHER SIDE."

192
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,731
HE WAS THE SON
OF AN ILLITERATE BLACKSMITH.

193
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,108
HE MADE HIMSELF
A MILLIONAIRE

194
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,486
SELLING LAND, COTTON,
AND SLAVES.

195
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,280
IN 1861,
HE ENLISTED AS A PRIVATE,

196
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,534
THEN QUIT TO RAISE AND EQUIP
AN ENTIRE CAVALRY BATTALION

197
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,537
OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET.

198
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:44,996
BY THE END OF THE WAR,

199
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,498
HE HAD BECOME
LIEUTENANT GENERAL,

200
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:50,001
THE ONLY MAN ON EITHER SIDE
TO RISE SO FAR.

201
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,422
HE WAS THE MOST FEARED
CAVALRY COMMANDER OF THE WAR,

202
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,507
THE "WIZARD OF THE SADDLE,"

203
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,592
WOUNDED 4 TIMES
IN BATTLE

204
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,179
AND FAMOUS FOR HAVING HORSES
SHOT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.

205
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,764
OLD BEDFORD FORREST,

206
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:06,727
HE'S THE MOST COLORFUL MAN
IN THE WAR.

207
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:10,480
HE KILLED MORE MEN THAN ANY
OTHER GENERAL OFFICER EVER HAS,

208
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,482
HAD MORE HORSES
SHOT OUT FROM UNDER HIM

209
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,151
THAN ANY OTHER OFFICER
EVER HAD.

210
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,570
HE HAD 30 HORSES
SHOT FROM UNDER HIM

211
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,071
IN THE COURSE
OF THE WAR,

212
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,657
AND HE KILLED 31 MEN
IN HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT,

213
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:23,702
AND HE SAID, "I WAS
A HORSE AHEAD AT THE END."

214
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:28,206
HE WAS A MASTER
OF THE LIGHTNING RAID

215
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:31,626
AND AN EXPERT AT WINNING
AGAINST LONG ODDS.

216
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,796
HE FOUGHT HIS BATTLES,
HE SAID, "BY EAR,"

217
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,923
AND HE COULD ANTICIPATE
AN ENEMY'S MOVEMENTS

218
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,010
WITH UNCANNY PRECISION.

219
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,554
HE WAS ONLY
SURPRISED IN BATTLE ONCE.

220
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,766
IT WAS A PLACE CALLED PARKER'S
CROSSROADS UP IN TENNESSEE.

221
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,601
HE WAS ON A RAID,

222
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,270
AND HE WAS CLOSING IN
ON AN OPPONENT

223
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,938
AND FIXING TO
FINISH HIM OFF

224
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,607
WHEN HE WAS ATTACKED
IN THE REAR

225
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,610
BY A FORCE THAT HE DID NOT
SUSPECT WAS WITHIN MANY MILES.

226
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:58,612
AND EVERYBODY WAS
TERRIBLY UPSET,

227
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,572
AND SAID, "GENERAL,
WHAT SHALL WE DO?"

228
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:04,117
AND HE SAID, "SPLIT IN TWO
AND CHARGE BOTH WAYS,"

229
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,411
AND DID AND GOT OUT.

230
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,790
IN JUNE 1864,

231
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,125
IN AN ATTEMPT TO CUT OFF
SHERMAN'S SUPPLIES

232
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,378
AT BRICE'S CROSSROADS
NEAR TUPELO, MISSISSIPPI,

233
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,632
FORREST OUTDID EVEN HIMSELF.

234
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,634
THE UNION ARMY
COMING TO STOP HIM

235
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:23,011
WAS NEARLY 3 TIMES
AS STRONG AS HIS,

236
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,472
BUT FORREST WAS UNIMPRESSED.

237
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,641
FACTORING IN
THE MUD-CLOGGED ROADS

238
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,643
AND THE BLAZING MID-JUNE SUN,

239
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,978
HE PREDICTED
THE UNION CAVALRY

240
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,648
WOULD ARRIVE WELL AHEAD
OF THE UNION INFANTRY,

241
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:38,652
GIVING HIM TIME TO WHIP IT
ON HIS OWN TERMS.

242
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,572
IT ALL HAPPENED
EXACTLY AS HE SAID.

243
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,661
NO ARMY, IT SEEMED,
COULD STOP HIM.

244
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,956
FORREST WAS FREE TO SLASH
AT SHERMAN'S FORCES,

245
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:53,708
SLOWING HIS APPROACH
TO ATLANTA.

246
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,883
"FORREST MUST BE
HUNTED DOWN AND KILLED

247
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,094
"IF IT COSTS 10,000 LIVES

248
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,472
AND BANKRUPTS
THAT FEDERAL TREASURY."

249
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,140
WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN.

250
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,569
"WHO SHALL REVIVE
THE WITHERED HOPES

251
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,321
"THAT BLOOMED AT THE OPENING
OF GRANT'S CAMPAIGN?

252
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,741
"ALL ARE TIRED
OF THIS DAMNABLE TRAGEDY.

253
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:31,454
"EACH HOUR IS BUT SINKING US
DEEPER INTO BANKRUPTCY

254
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,415
AND DESOLATION."

255
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,500
NEW YORK WORLD.

256
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:40,797
THE SUMMER OF 1864
WAS THE NORTH'S DARKEST HOUR.

257
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:43,466
GRANT'S LOSSES
HAD BEEN APPALLING.

258
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:46,720
HIS ARMY WAS STALLED
IN FRONT OF PETERSBURG,

259
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:50,265
HIS GRAND STRATEGY
APPARENTLY COME TO NOTHING.

260
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:55,145
FRANZ SIGEL'S ARMY HAD BEEN
ROUTED IN THE SHENANDOAH.

261
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,857
BEN BUTLER WAS BOTTLED UP
IN A LOOP OF THE JAMES RIVER

262
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,359
CALLED THE BERMUDA HUNDRED.

263
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:06,740
EVEN WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN
WAS STALLED OUTSIDE ATLANTA.

264
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,743
"MR. LINCOLN
IS ALREADY BEATEN.

265
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,912
"HE CANNOT BE RE-ELECTED,

266
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,789
AND WE MUST HAVE
ANOTHER TICKET."

267
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,000
HORACE GREELEY.

268
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:20,754
NO NATION
HAD EVER HELD AN ELECTION

269
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:22,839
IN THE MIDST
OF A CIVIL WAR.

270
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,841
NO PRESIDENT
SINCE ANDREW JACKSON

271
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,718
HAD WON A SECOND TERM.

272
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,678
LONG AFTER LINCOLN
WAS NOMINATED,

273
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:32,057
POLITICIANS IN HIS OWN PARTY
STILL HOPED TO RECONVENE

274
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,768
AND PICK ANOTHER NOMINEE.

275
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,563
EVEN LINCOLN BELIEVED
HIS RE-ELECTION UNLIKELY.

276
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:44,986
"WE CANNOT HAVE FREE
GOVERNMENT WITHOUT ELECTIONS,

277
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,072
"AND IF THE REBELLION
COULD FORCE US

278
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:50,783
"TO FOREGO OR POSTPONE
A NATIONAL ELECTION,

00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,453
"IT MIGHT FAIRLY BE CLAIMED

00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:57,415
TO HAVE ALREADY
CONQUERED AND RUINED US."

281
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,751
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

282
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:03,838
"AFTER 4 YEARS OF FAILURE
TO RESTORE THE UNION

283
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,882
"BY THE EXPERIMENT OF WAR,

284
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,301
"WE DEMAND
THAT IMMEDIATE EFFORT BE MADE

"FOR A CESSATION
OF HOSTILITIES

286
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:12,806
AT THE EARLIEST
PRACTICABLE MOMENT."

287
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,100
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL PLATFORM.

288
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,144
THE DEMOCRATS WANTED
AN END TO THE WAR,

289
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:20,563
WITH OR WITHOUT VICTORY.

290
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,233
THEIR NOMINEE WAS
GENERAL GEORGE McCLELLAN,

291
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,943
WHOSE AMBITION
HAD NOT SHRUNK

292
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,862
SINCE LINCOLN REMOVED HIM
FROM COMMAND.

293
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:33,326
"McCLELLAN WAS
OUR FIRST COMMANDER,

294
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,246
"AND AS SUCH, HE WAS ALMOST
WORSHIPPED BY HIS SOLDIERS.

295
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,206
"THE POLITICAL FRIENDS
OF GENERAL McCLELLAN

296

"WELL UNDERSTOOD THAT FACT,

"AND IT WAS A VERY CRAFTY THING
FOR THEM TO NOMINATE HIM

298
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:45,922
AS THEIR CANDIDATE
FOR THE PRESIDENCY."

299
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,217
THE SOUTH REJOICED
AT McCLELLAN'S NOMINATION.

300
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,885
"THE FIRST RAY OF REAL LIGHT,"

301
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:53,471
VICE-PRESIDENT
ALEXANDER STEPHENS SAID,

302
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,265
"SINCE THE WAR BEGAN."

303
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,144
WHEREVER IT COULD,

304
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,772
THE SOUTH EXPLOITED
ANTIWAR FEELING IN THE NORTH.

305
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,566
THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT
SENT MONEY

306
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,693
TO SUPPORT
THE UNION PEACE MOVEMENT

307
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,738
AND PAINTED LINCOLN
AS THE CANDIDATE OF WAR.

308
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,409
THE CAMPAIGN WAS UGLY.

309
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,871
DEMOCRATS CHARGED THAT
THE REAL GOAL OF OLD ABE'S WAR

310
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,706
WAS MISCEGENATION,

311
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:23,084
A NEW WORD FOR THE "BLENDING
OF WHITE AND BLACK."

312
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:27,839
REPUBLICANS CHARGED DEMOCRATS
WITH TREASON.

313
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:31,885
THE 1864 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

314
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:35,430
HAD BECOME A REFERENDUM
ON THE WAR ITSELF.

315
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,146
ALL THE WORD
FROM ALL REPUBLICANS,

316
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,898
EVEN ON A MOST
LOCAL LEVEL,

317
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,900
INDICATED THAT LINCOLN
COULDN'T POSSIBLY WIN.

318
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,986
THE FORTUNES OF WAR HAD TURNED TOO
BADLY, TOO SOUR FOR THE UNION.

319
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:54,115
AT ONE REALLY POIGNANT MOMENT,

320
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,118
LINCOLN SAT IN THE PRIVACY
OF HIS OFFICE

321
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,787
CONTEMPLATING THE FACT

322
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,497
THAT HE PROBABLY
WASN'T GOING TO BE RE-ELECTED

323
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:01,984
AND THAT McCLELLAN,
OF ALL PEOPLE,

324
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,250
WOULD REPLACE HIM
AS PRESIDENT.

325
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,546
"THIS MORNING,
AS FOR SOME DAYS PAST,

326
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,924
"IT SEEMS EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION

327
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,927
"WILL NOT BE RE-ELECTED.

328
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,762
"THEN IT WILL BE MY DUTY

329
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,556
"TO SO COOPERATE
WITH THE PRESIDENT-ELECT

330
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,266
"AS TO SAVE THE UNION

331
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:24,145
"BETWEEN THE ELECTION
AND THE INAUGURATION

332
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,564
"AS HE WILL HAVE SECURED
HIS ELECTION ON SUCH GROUND

333
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:29,984
THAT HE CANNOT POSSIBLY
SAVE IT AFTERWARD."

334
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,614
PRESSURED
TO DROP EMANCIPATION

335
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,783
AS A CONDITION OF PEACE
WITH THE SOUTH,

336
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,827
LINCOLN REFUSED.

337
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,539
"THE PROCLAMATION HAD PROMISED
FREEDOM," LINCOLN SAID,

338
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,458
"AND THE PROMISE BEING MADE,

THAT THE COMMANDING GENERAL

WAS UNABLE TO GIVE
THE ORDER OF EXECUTION.

389

WORKED TO DIG A 500-FOOT TUNNEL
BENEATH THE CONFEDERATE LINES

AND PACK IT WITH 4 TONS
OF GUNPOWDER.

TO BLOW A HOLE

IN THE PETERSBURG DEFENSES,

402
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:55,166

EVERY MAJOR BATTLE

407
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:06,010
FOUGHT BY THE ARMY
OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA.

408
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:13,309
AT DAWN ON JULY 30,
UNION SAPPERS LIT THE FUSE.

409
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,236
A GREAT CRATER
WAS TORN IN THE EARTH

410
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:28,074
30 FEET DEEP, 70 FEET WIDE,
250 FEET LONG.

411

THE STUNNED CONFEDERATES
FELL BACK.

412
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,164
THEN THE PLAN
BEGAN TO FALL APART.

413
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:36,666
A PRECIOUS HOUR WENT BY

414
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,668
BEFORE THE UNION ASSAULT FORCE
GOT STARTED,

415
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,253
AND WHEN IT DID,

416
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,005
3 DIVISIONS STORMED
DOWN INTO THE GREAT HOLE,

417
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,382
RATHER THAN AROUND IT.

418
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:47,969
THEIR COMMANDER,
GENERAL JAMES H. LEDLIE,

419
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,679
DID NOT EVEN
WATCH THE BATTLE,

HUDDLING INSTEAD IN A BOMBPROOF
SHELTER WITH A BOTTLE OF RUM.

421
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,772
ONCE INSIDE THE CRATER,
THE UNION SOLDIERS FOUND

THERE WAS NO WAY UP THE SHEER
30-FOOT WALL OF THE PIT,

AND NO ONE HAD THOUGHT
TO PROVIDE LADDERS.

424
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,700
GENERAL MAHONE ORDERED
HIS MEN BACK TO THE RIM

425
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,995
TO POUR FIRE DOWN UPON THEM.

426
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,247
SCORES OF BLACK TROOPS
WERE KILLED

427
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,207

AT THE CRATER,

DODGING SHERMAN'S
SUPERIOR FORCE

AND LOOKING FOR
THE RIGHT MOMENT TO ATTACK.

589
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:16,680
THE OPPORTUNITY NEVER CAME.

590
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,101

JEFFERSON DAVIS

REPLACEMENT

599

WAS 33-YEAR-OLD JOHN BELL HOOD
OF TEXAS.

600
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,714
HIS ARM HAD BEEN MANGLED
AT GETTYSBURG,

601
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:52,883
AND HE'D LOST A LEG
AT CHICKAMAUGA,

602
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,969
BUT HIS RECKLESSNESS
REMAINED INTACT.

603
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:59,890
HIS MEN CALLED HIM
"OLD WOODEN HEAD."

604

"HOOD IS A BOLD FIGHTER.

607
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,984
SHERMAN WAS DELIGHTED
WITH HOOD,

608
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:13,987
SURE HE WOULD BE
ATTACKED AT LAST.

609
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:17,825
MANY OF HIS UNITS WERE NOW ARMED
WITH HENRY REPEATING RIFLES,

610
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:21,912
CAPABLE OF FIRING 15 SHOTS
WITHOUT BEING RELOADED.

AND KEEP SHOOTING ALL WEEK.

614
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,216
TO CUT OFF ATLANTA'S RAIL LINKS

615
00:35:34,383 --> 00:35:35,300

EAST OF THE CITY.

619
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,102
MCPHERSON WAS A SPECIAL FAVORITE
OF SHERMAN'S--

HANDSOME, WARM-HEARTED,
INTELLIGENT.

621

SHERMAN PREDICTED,

"HE'LL OUTDISTANCE GRANT

623
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:56,947

THE UNION ADVANCE

624

AND DAILY PREDICTED
ATLANTA'S FALL.

625
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,956
BUT ON JULY 22nd,

626
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:09,459
HOOD RUSHED TO COUNTER
THE NEW UNION THREAT.

627
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:12,004
THE BATTLE OF ATLANTA
HAD BEGUN.

628
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,771
IT RAGED ALL AFTERNOON,

629
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,149
THE LINES FORMING,
FALLING BACK, REFORMING,

630
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:34,651
ATTACKING AGAIN.

AT 2:00,
GENERAL MCPHERSON HIMSELF

632
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:40,532
WENT TO INSPECT
THE IMPERILED UNION POSITION

633
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:44,328
AND RODE RIGHT INTO A BAND
OF REBEL SKIRMISHERS.

634
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:47,956
ORDERED TO SURRENDER, MCPHERSON
RAISED HIS HAT POLITELY,

635
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:51,293
TURNED HIS HORSE ABOUT,
AND RACED FOR THE UNION LINES.

636
00:36:53,086 --> 00:36:56,340
THE REBELS SHOT HIM
IN THE BACK.

637
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:59,676
SHERMAN COVERED
THE BODY OF HIS YOUNG FRIEND

638
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:01,053
WITH AN AMERICAN FLAG

639
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,096

"SATURDAY, AUGUST 21 st.

AND SUSPENSE HAS PASSED,

"AND THE FATE OF ATLANTA

THE NEXT VICTIM."

683
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:16,832
OUTSIDE ATLANTA,
THINGS WERE NO BETTER.

"THE ENEMY HOLD US
BY AN INFERIOR FORCE,"

00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,838
SHERMAN ADMITTED
AS THE SIEGE DRAGGED ON.

00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:26,174

00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,035
EVERY EVENING FOR A MONTH
DURING THE SIEGE,

691
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,873
A GEORGIA SHARPSHOOTER
PLAYED HIS CORNET SO BEAUTIFULLY

692
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,042
THAT MEN ON BOTH SIDES
STOPPED TO LISTEN.

693
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,789
FINALLY, ON AUGUST 31st,

694
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:40,832

00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,927
IN ONE MORE ATTEMPT
TO BREAK HOOD'S GRIP.

701
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,095
IT WORKED.

702
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,932
ON SEPTEMBER 1, 1864,

703
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,351
HOOD ABANDONED ATLANTA.

TO AVENGE SHERMAN'S
VICTORIES IN GEORGIA,

00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,810
6 CONFEDERATE AGENTS SLIPPED
INTO NEW YORK CITY

THE CITY'S MOST
FASHIONABLE HOTELS.

729
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,987

TO LIGHT 10 FIRES

P.T. BARNUM'S MUSEUM ABLAZE.

FIREMEN PUT EVERYTHING OUT.

732

"THE PEOPLE OF THE NORTH CAN'T BE
ROLLING IN WEALTH AND COMFORT,"

"WHILE WE AT THE SOUTH

736
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:54,758

THE UNION CAMP AT CITY POINT
ON THE JAMES RIVER

756
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:18,550
SUDDENLY FOUND ITSELF ONE
OF THE WORLD'S BUSIEST SEAPORTS,

757
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,261
WITH BAKERIES, BARRACKS,
WAREHOUSES,

758
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:26,182
A 200-ACRE TENT HOSPITAL,
MORE THAN A MILE OF WHARVES,

759
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:31,271
AND A NEW 70-MILE RAILROAD BUILT
BY HERMAN HAUPT IN RECORD TIME

760
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:33,356
TO BRING SUPPLIES
AND FRESH TROOPS

EXTRAVAGANCE," A VISITOR WROTE,

"SOLDIERS PROVIDED
WITH EVERYTHING."

764
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:51,207
AN INDUSTRIAL MACHINE
OF UNPARALLELED POWER

765
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:54,377
NOW KEPT THE WAR SUPPLIES
STREAMING TO THE FRONT.

766
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:57,172
IN CLEVELAND, OHIO,
WHEN THE WAR BEGAN,

767
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:00,592
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE FORGE
OR FOUNDRY.

768
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:03,636
WHEN THE WAR ENDED,
THERE WERE 21,

769
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,221
EMPLOYING 3,000 MEN

770
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:09,267
AND TURNING OUT 60,000 TONS
OF STEEL A YEAR.

ON THE HUDSON

773
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,484
WAS PRODUCING 7,000
ARTILLERY PROJECTILES A WEEK

774
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,611
AND THE MILITARY
TELEGRAPH SYSTEM

775
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:23,156
WAS CARRYING OVER
3,300 MESSAGES A DAY

776

781
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,925
FOR SHREWD
NORTHERN BUSINESSMEN,

782
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,928
THERE WERE QUICK PROFITS
IN ARMY CONTRACTS.

783
00:46:45,094 --> 00:46:46,930
PHILIP ARMOUR GAVE UP
GOLD MINING

784
00:46:47,096 --> 00:46:49,933
TO STRIKE IT RICH
PACKING PORK FOR THE ARMY.

785
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,602
SAMUEL COLT OF HARTFORD
TOLD HIS MEN

786
00:46:52,769 --> 00:46:56,689
TO "RUN THE ARMORY NIGHT AND DAY
WITH DOUBLE SETS OF HANDS."

787
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,900
JAY COOKE SOLD WAR BONDS,

788
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,945
RAISED MORE THAN $400 MILLION
FOR THE UNION,

789
00:47:02,111 --> 00:47:05,031
AND GOT RICH
ON THE COMMISSIONS.

790
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:09,702
UNSCRUPULOUS CONTRACTORS SOLD
THE WAR DEPARTMENT RUSTY RIFLES,

791
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:13,915
BOATS THAT LEAKED,
CAPS THAT MELTED IN THE RAIN.

792
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:16,209
WHEN ONE MANUFACTURER
WAS ASKED

793
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:19,087
WHY THE SOLES OF THE SHOES
HE SUPPLIED FELL OFF

794
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:20,964
AFTER A FEW MINUTES' MARCHING,

795
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,593
HE EXPLAINED THEY HAD BEEN MEANT
FOR THE CAVALRY.

796
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,800
"YOU CAN SELL ALMOST
ANYTHING TO THE GOVERNMENT

797
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:31,099
AT ALMOST ANY PRICE
YOU'VE GOT THE GUTS TO ASK."

798
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,023
I THINK THAT
THE NORTH FOUGHT THAT WAR

799
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,734
WITH ONE HAND
BEHIND ITS BACK.

800
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:43,778
AT THE SAME TIME
THE WAR WAS GOING ON,

801
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,947
THE HOMESTEAD ACT
WAS BEING PASSED.

802
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:48,700
ALL THESE MARVELOUS INVENTIONS
WERE GOING ON.

803
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,285
IN THE SPRING OF '64,

804
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,495
THE HARVARD-YALE BOAT RACES
WERE GOING ON,

805
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:53,997
AND NOT A MAN
IN EITHER CREW

806
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:55,999
EVER VOLUNTEERED
FOR THE ARMY OR THE NAVY.

807
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:58,293
THEY DIDN'T NEED THEM.

808
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:02,130
I THINK THAT IF IT HAD BEEN
MORE SOUTHERN SUCCESSES

809
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,673
AND A LOT MORE,

810
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,960
THE NORTH SIMPLY WOULD HAVE
BROUGHT THAT OTHER ARM OUT

811
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:07,635
FROM BEHIND ITS BACK.

812
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:11,055
I DON'T THINK THE SOUTH EVER
HAD A CHANCE TO WIN THAT WAR.

813
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:24,944
OUT WEST, BLOODY BILL
ANDERSON, A CONFEDERATE GUERRILLA

814
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:27,822
WHO RODE WITH UNION SCALPS
TIED TO HIS BRIDLE,

815
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,783
LED 30 MEN
INTO CENTRALIA, MISSOURI,

816
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,411
KILLED 24 UNARMED
FEDERAL SOLDIERS,

817
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,205
THEN AMBUSHED 116 MORE.

818
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,752
ON OCTOBER 26th,

819
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:43,755
ANDERSON HIMSELF
WAS AMBUSHED AND KILLED,

820
00:48:43,922 --> 00:48:46,382
BUT ONE OF HIS CLOSE
LIEUTENANTS, JESSE JAMES,

821
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:47,800
GOT AWAY.

822
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:54,390
IN TENNESSEE,

823
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:57,101
NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST'S MEN
SURROUNDED FORT PILLOW,

824
00:48:57,268 --> 00:49:00,730
HELD BY A UNIT OF TENNESSEE
UNIONISTS AND BLACK TROOPS,

825
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:02,982
AND DEMANDED ITS SURRENDER.

826
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:07,070
WHEN THE UNION COMMANDER
REFUSED, THE FORT WAS OVERRUN.

827
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:11,115
AS MANY AS 300 SOLDIERS,
MOST OF THEM BLACK, WERE KILLED,

828
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:14,577
MANY AFTER THEY SURRENDERED.

829
00:49:14,744 --> 00:49:17,038
"IT IS HOPED THAT THESE
FACTS WILL DEMONSTRATE

833
00:49:27,382 --> 00:49:31,636
"I SAID, <i>DON'T SHOOT ME,</i>

834

"I MADE A STEP OR TWO,

<i>"TURN AROUND. I WILL HOLD
MY HORSE AND SHOOT YOU, TOO.</i>

837
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:47,819
I NO SOONER TURNED AROUND
THAN HE SHOT ME IN THE FACE."

838
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:53,533
"I FELL DOWN
AS IF I WAS DEAD.

839
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,576

01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:37,635
THE BLOCKADE WAS WORKING.

1007
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,970
THEY COULDN'T
GET VERY SIMPLE THINGS

1008
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:43,599
LIKE NEEDLES TO SEW WITH--
VERY SIMPLE THINGS.

1009
01:00:43,766 --> 01:00:47,686
AND THE DISCOURAGEMENT BEGAN
TO SETTLE IN MORE AND MORE

1010
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:51,565
WITH THE REALIZATION THAT THEY
WERE NOT GONNA WIN THAT WAR.

1011
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,692
THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS
DID EVERYTHING THEY COULD,

1012
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:55,861
ESPECIALLY JEFFERSON DAVIS,
TO ASSURE THEM

1013
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:58,113
THAT THIS WAS
THE SECOND AMERICAN REVOLUTION,

1014
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,909
AND IF THEY WOULD STAND FAST,
THEY WAY THEIR FOREFATHERS HAD,

1015
01:01:02,076 --> 01:01:05,245
VICTORY WAS UNQUESTIONABLY
GONNA COME,

1016
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,039
BUT THE REALIZATION CAME
MORE AND MORE

1017
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:09,124
THAT IT WAS NOT
GONNA COME,

1018
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,126
ESPECIALLY THAT THEY WERE NOT
GONNA GET FOREIGN RECOGNITION,

1019
01:01:11,293 --> 01:01:14,213
WITHOUT WHICH WE WOULDN'T HAVE
WON THE FIRST REVOLUTION,

1020
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:16,882
AND ALL THOSE THINGS
CLOSED IN ON THEM.

1021
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,019
IN THE NORTH,

1022
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,647
THE RESERVOIR OF MEN
SEEMED BOTTOMLESS.

1023
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:34,858
WHOLE UNITS, LIKE THE 3rd
MASSACHUSETTS VOLUNTEERS,

1024
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,529
HAD STILL NEVER HEARD
A SHOT FIRED IN ANGER.

1025
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,615
LINCOLN NOW ISSUED
A PROCLAMATION

1026
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,492
MAKING THE LAST THURSDAY
IN NOVEMBER

1027
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:46,286
A NATIONAL DAY
OF THANKSGIVING.

1028
01:01:50,791 --> 01:01:52,501
IN THE TRENCHES
AT PETERSBURG,

1029
01:01:52,668 --> 01:01:55,504
120,000 TURKEY AND CHICKEN
DINNERS WERE SERVED

1030
01:01:55,671 --> 01:01:57,756
TO GRANT'S HUGE ARMY.

1031
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:00,884
ONLY YARDS AWAY,

1032
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:02,886
THE CONFEDERATES
HAD NO FEAST,

1033
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:05,013
BUT HELD THEIR FIRE
ALL DAY

1034
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,516
OUT OF RESPECT
FOR THE UNION HOLIDAY.

1035
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:15,524
LINCOLN CALLED FOR MORE MEN
TO FINISH THE WAR.

1036
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:18,652
THE SOUTH HAD
NO MORE MEN TO SPARE.

1037
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:24,950
AND WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN
HAD BEGUN HIS MARCH TO THE SEA.

1038
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:32,583
"WE LAY IN GRIM REPOSE

1039
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:36,670
"AND EXPECTED THE RENEWAL
OF THE MORTAL CONFLICT.

1040
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:38,672
"THE CONVICTION
EVERYWHERE PREVAILED

1041
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:42,593
THAT WE COULD SUSTAIN
BUT ONE MORE CAMPAIGN."

1042
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,721
CAPTAIN JAMES F.J. CALDWELL.

1043
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:53,228
ON THE NIGHT OF NOVEMBER 25th

1044
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:54,772
AT THE WINTER GARDEN THEATER

1045
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,440
ON BROADWAY,

1046
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:58,734
SHAKESPEARE'S
JULIUS CAESAR OPENED.

1047
01:03:00,486 --> 01:03:03,572
3 BROTHERS HAD
THE STARRING ROLES--

1048
01:03:03,739 --> 01:03:07,701
EDWIN, JUNIUS,
AND JOHN WILKES BOOTH.

1049
01:03:07,868 --> 01:03:09,953
AT ONE POINT
IN SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY,

1050
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:13,582
CASSIUS SPEAKS
OF THE ASSASSINATION OF CAESAR.

1051
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:15,959
"HOW MANY AGES HENCE

1052
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:19,713
"SHALL THIS OUR LOFTY SCENE
BE ACTED OVER,

1053
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:24,009
IN STATES UNBORN
AND ACCENTS YET UNKNOWN?"

1054
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:51,787
"CAPTAIN CLAPP, 77th NEW YORK.
WOUNDED AT PETERSBURG."

1055
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:58,293
"CAPTAIN SMITH, 77th NEW YORK.
WOUNDED AT WILDERNESS."

1056
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:03,632
"CAPTAIN TAYLOR,
61 st PENNSYLVANIA.

1057
01:04:03,799 --> 01:04:06,343
WOUNDED AT SPOTSYLVANIA."

1058
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:13,809
"CAPTAIN ORR, 77th NEW YORK.
LOST ARM AT CEDAR CREEK."

1059
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:20,816
"CAPTAIN DEFOE.
EYE SHOT OUT AT SPOTSYLVANIA."

1060
01:04:22,651 --> 01:04:28,824
"MAJOR ELLIS, 49th NEW YORK.
DIED OF WOUND AT SPOTSYLVANIA."

1061
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,662
"CAPTAIN HICKMOTT,
49th NEW YORK.

1062
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:36,164
KILLED AT WILDERNESS."

1063
01:04:37,875 --> 01:04:43,463
"LIEUTENANT LYON, 77th NEW YORK.

1064
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,677

01:04:48,844 --> 01:04:51,138

1066
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:57,102
"UNION OFFICERS.
ALL KILLED IN BATTLE."

1067
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,401
"IT REALLY LOOKS
AS IF IT WOULD NEVER END."

1068
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:07,696
"THE MOST INSPIRING SIGHT

1069
01:05:07,863 --> 01:05:10,574
"IS THE FLOCK OF BUZZARDS
CONSTANTLY HOVERING OVER US

1070
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:13,076
"AND WAITING
FOR THEIR FEAST.

1071
01:05:13,243 --> 01:05:15,704
"THOSE BIRDS ARE
AT LEAST IMPARTIAL

1072
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,123
BECAUSE THEY EAT
BOTH SIDES ALIKE."

1073
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:23,086
"THE SAME, I SUPPOSE,
IS TRUE OF WORMS."

1074
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,880
WASHINGTON ROEBLING.

1075
01:05:39,895 --> 01:05:41,730
BY THE SPRING OF 1864,

1076
01:05:41,897 --> 01:05:45,108
UNION DEAD COMPLETELY FILLED
THE MILITARY CEMETERIES

1077
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,819
OF WASHINGTON
AND ALEXANDRIA.

1078
01:05:49,905 --> 01:05:51,406
SECRETARY OF WAR STANTON

1079
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:54,117
ORDERED THE QUARTERMASTER
GENERAL, MONTGOMERY MEIGS,

1080
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:56,662
TO CHOOSE A NEW SITE.

1081
01:05:56,828 --> 01:05:59,790
MEIGS WAS A GEORGIAN
WHO HAD SERVED UNDER LEE

1082
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:03,085
IN THE PEACETIME ARMY,
BUT HE HAD DEVELOPED

1083
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:06,004
AN INTENSE HATRED
FOR ALL HIS FELLOW SOUTHERNERS

1084
01:06:06,171 --> 01:06:09,257
WHO FOUGHT AGAINST THE UNION
HE STILL SERVED.

1085
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,889
WITHOUT HESITATION,
HE PICKED THE GROUNDS

1086
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:17,891
OF ROBERT E. LEE'S
HOME AT ARLINGTON

1087
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:19,476
FOR THE NEW ARMY CEMETERY,

1088
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:21,895
AND ORDERED THAT THE UNION DEAD
BE LAID TO REST

1089
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:23,897
WITHIN A FEW FEET
OF THE FRONT DOOR

1090
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:25,983
OF THE MAN
HE BLAMED FOR THEIR DEATHS

1091
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:30,278
SO THAT NO ONE COULD EVER AGAIN
LIVE IN THE HOUSE.

1092
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:37,285
IN OCTOBER, MEIGS' OWN SON JOHN
WAS KILLED

1093
01:06:37,452 --> 01:06:39,913
BY CONFEDERATE GUERRILLAS
IN THE SHENANDOAH

1094
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,333
AND BURIED
IN MRS. LEE'S ROSE GARDEN.

1095
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:50,924
AT ONE POINT THAT YEAR,
THE UNION ARMY WAS SENDING BACK

1096
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:55,846
2,000 WOUNDED, MAIMED, AND DYING
MEN A WEEK TO WASHINGTON.

1097
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:02,894
NOW THE MEN GRANT WAS SENDING
TO FIGHT ROBERT E. LEE

1098
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:06,314
WERE BEING BURIED
IN LEE'S OWN FRONT YARD.

1099
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:14,448
AND THAT YARD BECAME
ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY,

1100
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,617
THE UNION'S
MOST HALLOWED GROUND.
