1
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,639
PRIVATE EDWIN TENNISON,

2
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:16,100
KILLED IN ACTION
AT MALVERN HILL,

3
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:19,145
JULY 1, 1862.

4
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:00,383
DURING THE CIVIL WAR,

5
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,022
PHOTOGRAPHERS FOLLOWED
THE ARMIES EVERYWHERE

6
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:06,400
TO MAKE PROUD PORTRAITS
FOR THE BOYS TO SEND HOME

7
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,110
AND TO CAPTURE
AS MUCH OF THE ACTION

8
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,528
AS CUMBERSOME EQUIPMENT

9
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,489
AND SLOW SHUTTER SPEEDS
ALLOWED.

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,993
NEAR THE BATTLE
OF FAIR OAKS, VIRGINIA,

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,204
CAPTAIN GEORGE
ARMSTRONG CUSTER

12
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,164
PAUSED TO HAVE
HIS PICTURE TAKEN

13
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,749
WITH J.B. WASHINGTON,

14
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,585
CLOSE FRIEND AND CLASSMATE
FROM WEST POINT--

15
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:26,253
AND NOW A CONFEDERATE
LIEUTENANT

16
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,421
WHO HAD JUST THAT MORNING

17
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,215
BEEN CAPTURED
BY FEDERAL PICKETS.

18
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,443
AS 1862 DRAGGED ON,

19
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,488
THE CHARACTER OF THE WAR
WAS CHANGING,

20
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:54,740
AND MUCH OF THE COUNTRY
WAS CHANGING WITH IT.

21
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:01,413
BY 1862, MORE THAN
A MILLION FARM WORKERS

22
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,125
HAD ENLISTED
IN THE UNION ARMY,

23
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,501
AND TRAVELERS
IN THE MIDWEST

24
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:08,129
SAW MORE WOMEN AT WORK
IN THE FIELDS THAN MEN.

25
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:23,227
THE YEAR, WHICH HAD BEGUN
SO PROMISINGLY FOR THE NORTH,

26
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:25,104
HAD NOW GONE AWRY.

27
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:28,107
U.S. GRANT'S TRIUMPHS
AT DONELSON AND SHILOH

28
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,402
WERE BEING OVERSHADOWED
BY DISASTERS IN THE EAST.

29
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,198
IN VIRGINIA, UNION GENERAL
GEORGE McCLELLAN'S ARMY

30
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,534
SAT OUTSIDE RICHMOND,

31
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,745
ITS COMMANDER IN POSSESSION
OF VASTLY GREATER FORCES,

32
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,414
BUT WITHOUT
THE WILL TO FIGHT.

33
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,671
MEANWHILE, THE CONFEDERACY
WAS BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE

34
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,590
THE BRILLIANCE
OF A NEW COMMANDER,

35
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,258
ROBERT E. LEE,

36
00:02:54,425 --> 00:02:56,510
WHO WOULD SOON
ESTABLISH A REPUTATION

37
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:59,430
AS ONE OF THE GREATEST
MILITARY LEADERS OF ALL TIME.

38
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,189
AND THERE WAS STILL
MORE TROUBLE FOR THE UNION.

39
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,607
AT BLACKBURN, ENGLAND,

40
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,151
A PUBLIC MEETING DECLARED
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE

41
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,987
FOR THE NORTH
TO VANQUISH THE SOUTH

42
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:17,489
AND CALLED FOR A NEGOTIATED
SETTLEMENT OF THE WAR.

43
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,953
WITH EUROPE POISED
TO RECOGNIZE THE CONFEDERACY,

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,624
THE UNTHINKABLE
LOOKED INCREASINGLY LIKELY--

45
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,667
THE UNION WAS GOING TO
LOSE THE WAR.

46
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,132
"WE MUST CHANGE OUR TACTICS
OR LOSE THE GAME,"

47
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:38,510
ABRAHAM LINCOLN
WROTE IN 1862.

48
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,095
TO LINCOLN,
IT WAS CLEAR NOW

49
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,472
THAT IT WAS
NO LONGER POSSIBLE

50
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,641
TO RESTORE THE OLD UNION.

51
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:47,102
ANEW ONE
HAD TO BE EMBRACED.

52
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,188
BY SUMMER, HE KNEW
WHAT TACTIC WAS NEEDED

53
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:52,650
TO WIN THE WAR--
EMANCIPATION--

54
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:54,296
BUT DOUBTED WHETHER
HE WOULD EVER HAVE

55
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:57,363
THE POLITICAL OR MILITARY
OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT.

56
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:06,205
"I FIND IT HARD
TO MAINTAIN MY LIVELY FAITH

57
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:08,499
IN THE TRIUMPH
OF THE NATION AND THE LAW,"

58
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,584
NEW YORK LAWYER
GEORGE TEMPLETON STRONG

59
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,420
CONFIDED TO HIS DIARY.

60
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,715
"THESE ARE THE DARKEST DAYS
WE HAVE SEEN SINCE BULL RUN."

61
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,720
WHAT NO ONE KNEW
WAS THAT THE YEAR

62
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,057
WOULD SOON SEE
THE BLOODIEST DAY OF THE WAR

63
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:26,392
AND THEN THE BRIGHTEST.

64
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,106
IT COULD HAVE BEEN
AVERY UGLY, FILTHY WAR

65
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:37,027
WITH NO REDEEMING
CHARACTERISTICS AT ALL...

66
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,532
AND IT WAS THE BATTLE
FOR EMANCIPATION

67
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,742
AND THE PEOPLE
WHO PUSHED IT FORWARD--

68
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,371
THE SLAVES, THE FREE BLACK
PEOPLE, THE ABOLITIONISTS,

69
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,040
AND A LOT
OF ORDINARY CITIZENS--

70
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:51,709
IT WAS THEY WHO ENNOBLED

71
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,045
WHAT OTHERWISE VVOULD HAVE
BEEN MEANING-LESS CARNAGE

72
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,380
INTO SOMETHING HIGHER.

73
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,438
OUTSIDE RICHMOND,

74
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,065
GEORGE MCCLELLAN CONTINUED
TO CALL ANXIOUSLY

75
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,400
FOR MORE TROOPS,

76
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,236
THOUGH HIS
110,000-MAN FORCE

77
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,448
ALREADY GREATLY OUTNUMBERED
JOSEPH JOHNSTON'S ARMY.

78
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,368
MEANWHILE,
WEST OF THE BLUE RIDGE

79
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,078
IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY,

80
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,080
GENERAL THOMAS J. JACKSON

81
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,458
WAS KEEPING
3 FEDERAL ARMIES BUSY.

82
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:50,142
"ALWAYS MYSTIFY, MISLEAD,
AND SURPRISE THE ENEMY.

83
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,436
"AND WHEN YOU STRIKE
AND OVERCOME HIM,

84
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,772
"NEVER LET UP
IN THE PURSUIT.

85
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,398
"NEVER FIGHT
AGAINST HEAVY ODDS

86
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,941
"IF YOU CAN
HURL YOUR FORCE

87
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,944
"ON ONLY A PART OF YOUR
ENEMY AND CRUSH IT.

88
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,572
"A SMALL ARMY MAY THUS
DESTROY A LARGE ONE,

89
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:07,701
AND REPEATED VICTORY
WILL MAKE IT INVINCIBLE."

90
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,161
GENERAL T.J. JACKSON.

91
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,124
HE WAS A TRUE ECCENTRIC.

92
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,419
HE BELIEVED THAT IF HE
HAD PEPPER IN HIS FOOD,

93
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,255
IT WOULD MAKE
HIS LEFT LEG ACHE.

94
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,966
HE WOULD NEVER
MAIL A LETTER

95
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,053
THAT WOULD BE
IN TRANSIT ON A SUNDAY.

96
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,639
HE WAS A STRICT OBSERVER
OF THE SABBATH.

97
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,016
AND YET SO MANY OF HIS BATTLES
WERE FOUGHT ON SUNDAYS

98
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:34,603
THAT THE SOLDIERS BEGAN TO BELIEVE
THAT HE VVOULD FIGHT ON SUNDAY

99
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,688
BECAUSE THE LORD
WOULD BE EVEN MORE WITH HIM.

100
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,610
JACKSON WAS A PIOUS,
BLUE-EYED KILLER,

101
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,197
UTTERLY UNTROUBLED
BY THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEATH.

102
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,658
IT WAS A MAN'S
"ENTIRE DUTY," HE SAID,

103
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,661
"TO PRAY AND FIGHT."

104
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:53,372
"HE WOULD HAVE A MAN SHOT
AT THE DROP OF A HAT,

105
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:55,624
AND HE'D DROP IT HIMSELF."

106
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,001
SAM WATKINS.

107
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,964
HE HAD A STRANGE QUALITY
OF OVERLOOKING SUFFERING.

108
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:05,592
DURING ONE OF THE BATTLES,
HE HAD A YOUNG COURIER,

109
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,079
AND JACKSON LOOKED
AROUND FOR HIM,

110
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,345
AND HE WASN'T THERE.

111
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:10,347
AND HE SAID, "WHERE IS
LIEUTENANT SO-AND-SO?"

112
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,933
AND THEY SAID, "HE WAS
KILLED, GENERAL."

113
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,645
JACKSON SAID, “VERY
COMMENDABLE, VERY COMMENDABLE.“

114
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,272
AND THEN PUT HIM
OUT OF HIS MIND.

115
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,192
"ALL OLD JACKSON GAVE US

116
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,362
"WAS A MUSKET, 100 ROUNDS,
AND A GUM BLANKET,

117
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,031
AND HE DROVE US LIKE HELL."

118
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,700
HIS MEN
DID NOT LOVE HIM.

119
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:34,037
HE WAS TOO GRIM, TOO REMOTE,
AND HE DEMANDED TOO MUCH.

120
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,956
SOME THOUGHT HIM MAD.

121
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:38,459
HE BELIEVED THAT ONLY BY
KEEPING ONE HAND IN THE AIR

122
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,628
COULD HE STOP HIMSELF
FROM GOING OUT OF BALANCE.

123
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,589
AND HE SUCKED
CONSTANTLY ON LEMONS,

124
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,258
EVEN IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE.

125
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,177
OTHERS WORRIED
THAT HIS RELIGIOUS FERVOR

126
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,179
WOULD CLOUD HIS JUDGMENT.

127
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,930
HIS COMMAND, JACKSON SAID,

128
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:54,057
WAS "AN ARMY
OF THE LIVING GOD,

129
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,102
AS WELL AS OF ITS COUNTRY."

130
00:07:57,269 --> 00:07:58,937
BUT HIS MEN
WERE WILLING TO ENDURE

131
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:01,899
THE 36-MILE-A-DAY MARCHES
HE DEMANDED

132
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,567
BECAUSE HE
BROUGHT THEM VICTORIES.

133
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:10,365
IT WAS JACKSON'S DUTY
IN THE SHENANDOAH

134
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:12,409
TO UNSETTLE THE UNION

135
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,120
AND KEEP WASHINGTON
FROM REINFORCING McCLELLAN.

136
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,167
OPERATING IN THE MIDST
OF 3 FEDERAL ARMIES,

137
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,587
EACH WITH MORE MEN THAN
HIS OWN FORCE OF 17,000,

138
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:27,257
JACKSON LASHED OUT
AT ONE ARMY AND THEN ANOTHER.

139
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,345
ARMED WITH A DETAILED MAP
THAT STRETCHED 8½ FEET,

140
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:33,639
HE SURPRISED THEM
EVERY TIME--

141
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,182
AT WINCHESTER,

142
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,433
FRONT ROYAL,

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,060
CROSS KEYS,

144
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,436
PORT REPUBLIC,

145
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,730
AND A HALF DOZEN
OTHER PLACES.

146
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,277
AFTER ROUTING
NATHANIEL BANKS' ARMY

147
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:48,737
AT THE BATTLE
OF WINCHESTER,

148
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,532
JACKSON CHASED IT
ALL THE WAY TO THE POTOMAC.

149
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,701
"STOP, MEN!" BANKS SHOUTED
TO HIS RETREATING TROOPS.

150
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,578
"DON'T YOU
LOVE YOUR COUNTRY?"

151
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,330
"YES, BY GOD," SAID ONE,

152
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,581
"AND I'M TRYING
TO GET BACK TO IT

153
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,041
JUST AS FAST AS I CAN."

154
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,518
JACKSON'S VALLEY CAMPAIGN
WAS A TRIUMPH.

155
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:22,646
IN JUST OVER A MONTH,

156
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,440
HIS MEN MARCHED
ALMOST 400 MILES,

157
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,985
INFLICTED
7,000 CASUALTIES,

158
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:31,280
SEIZED HUGE QUANTITIES
OF BADLY NEEDED SUPPLIES,

159
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,699
AND KEPT ALMOST 40,000
FEDERAL TROOPS

160
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,033
OFF THE PENINSULA.

161
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,998
"HE WHO DOES NOT SEE
THE HAND OF GOD IN THIS

162
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,458
IS BLIND, SIR, BLIND."

163
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,969
"THERE IS NO DOUBT
THAT JEFFERSON DAVIS

164
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,095
"AND OTHER LEADERS
OF THE SOUTH

165
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,097
"HAVE MADE AN ARMY.

166
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,558
"THEY ARE MAKING,
IT APPEARS, A NAVY,

167
00:09:59,725 --> 00:10:02,019
"AND THEY HAVE MADE
WHAT IS MORE THAN EITHER.

168
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,896
"THEY HAVE MADE A NATION.

169
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,982
"WE MAY ANTICIPATE
WITH CERTAINTY

170
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,526
THE SUCCESS
OF THE SOUTHERN STATES."

171
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,069
WILLIAM E. GLADSTONE.

172
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,116
CONFEDERATE GOSPEL
HELD THAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE

173
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:19,870
COULD NOT SURVIVE
WITHOUT SOUTHERN COTTON.

174
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,623
BEFORE LONG, ONE OR BOTH
WOULD SURELY INTERVENE

175
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,041
ON BEHALF
OF THE CONFEDERACY

176
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:27,127
TO END THE UNION BLOCKADE.

177
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,046
TO PUT MORE PRESSURE
ON EUROPE,

178
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:33,300
THE CONFEDERATES
CUT COTTON PRODUCTION 90%.

179
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:35,552
2.5 MILLION BALES
WERE BURNED

180
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,013
OR LEFT TO ROT
ON CON FEDERATE WHARVES

181
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,600
TO KEEP IT
OUT OF ENGLISH HANDS.

182
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,728
NOW, IN ADDITION
TO DIRECTING A WAR AT HOME,

183
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,730
LINCOLN HAD TO FIND AWAY
TO KEEP EUROPE

184
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,815
FROM COMING IN
ON THE SIDE OF THE SOUTH.

185
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,071
AND INCREASINGLY,
IN THE NORTH,

186
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,740
THERE WAS PRESSURE
FOR EMANCIPATION,

187
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,742
AND IT CAME
FROM UNLIKELY PEOPLE

188
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:00,202
IN UNLIKELY PLACES.

189
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,133
ON MAY 1, 1862,

190
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,678
LINCOLN NAMED
GENERAL BENJAMIN F. BUTLER

191
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:21,682
MILITARY GOVERNOR
OF OCCUPIED NEW ORLEANS.

192
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,392
BUTLER WENT RIGHT TO WORK.

193
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:24,810
HE HANGED A MAN

194
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:28,021
SUSPECTED OF HAVING DESECRATED
THE AMERICAN FLAG.

195
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,190
HE CLOSED
A SECESSIONIST NEWSPAPER,

196
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,566
CONFISCATED THE PROPERTY

197
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,568
OF CITIZENS WHO REFUSED
TO SWEAR ALLEGIANCE

198
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,903
TO THE UNION,

199
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,280
AND WAS GIVEN THE SCORNFUL
NICKNAME "SPOONS"

200
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,408
FOR ALLEGEDLY
POCKETING SILVERWARE.

201
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:46,206
NEW ORLEANS WOMEN ROUTINELY
INSULTED HIS TROOPS.

202
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,693
WHEN A WOMAN
IN THE FRENCH QUARTER

203
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,668
LEANED FROM A WINDOW
TO DUMP HER CHAMBER POT

204
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:51,837
ON THE HEAD
OF ADMIRAL FARRAGUT,

205
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:55,590
BUTLER ISSUED
GENERAL ORDER NUMBER 28.

206
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:59,302
"AS THE OFFICERS
AND SOLDIERS OF THE UNITED STATES

207
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:02,597

00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:07,894
"FROM THE WOMEN CALLING

209
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,980

217
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,921
GENERAL BENJAMIN BUTLER.

218
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,283
SOUTHERNERS
WERE OUTRAGED

219
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,260
AND CALLED BUTLER "THE BEAST."

220
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,804
A NEW ORLEANS ENTREPRENEUR
SOLD CHAMBER POTS

221
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,766
FEATURING BUTLER'S PORTRAIT
INSIDE THE BOWL.

222
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,227
IN CHARLESTON,
SOUTH CAROLINA,

223
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,647
A PRIVATE CITIZEN
OFFERED A $10,000 REWARD

224
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,025
FOR THE CAPTURE
OF "BEAST" BEN BUTLER--

225
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,985
DEAD OR ALIVE.

226
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,404
BUT THE HARASSMENT
OF HIS MEN STOPPED.

227
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,034
WITH THE UNION ARMY
SO NEAR,

228
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,621
UNREST ON LOUISIANA
PLANTATIONS INCREASED.

229
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:08,955
WHEN DESPERATE
SLAVE OWNERS

230
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,583
BEGAN COMPLAINING
OF REBELLIOUS BLACKS,

231
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,961
BUTLER DECLARED THE PLANTERS
DISLOYAL TO THE UNION,

232
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,798
THEN TOOK AWAY
THEIR SLAVES.

233
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:18,882
"GO TO THE YANKEES,"

234
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,635
ONE SLAVE-HOLDER
TOLD HIS SLAVES.

235
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,053
"THEY ARE KINGS HERE NOW."

236
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,225
"I HAVE BEEN READING
SO MUCH ABOUT THE YANKEES,

237
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,603
"I WAS VERY ANXIOUS
TO SEE THEM.

238
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,146
"THE WHITES WOULD TELL
THEIR COLORED PEOPLE

239
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,564
"NOT TO GO TO THE YANKEES,

00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,233
"FOR THEY WOULD
HARNESS THEM TO CARTS

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,987
"AND MAKE THEM PULL THE CARTS
AROUND IN PLACE OF HORSES.

242
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,032
"I ASKED GRANDMOTHER
ONE DAY IF THIS WAS TRUE.

243
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,660
"SHE REPLIED, CERTAINLY NOT,

00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,036
"THAT THE WHITE PEOPLE

00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,831
"DID NOT WANT SLAVES
TO GO OVER TO THE YANKEES

00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,333
"AND TOLD THEM THESE THINGS
TO FRIGHTEN THEM.

247
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,379
"I WANTED TO SEE THOSE
WONDERFUL YANKEES SO MUCH,

248
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:58,964
"AS I HEARD MY PARENTS SAY

249
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,093
THAT THE YANKEES WERE GOING
TO SET ALL THE SLAVES FREE."

250
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,053
SUSAN KING TAYLOR.

251
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:12,894
THE SLAVES UNDERSTOOD
THAT THAT WAR WAS ABOUT SLAVERY

252
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,814
BEFORE IT WAS A WAR.

253
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,524
THEY MADE A NUISANCE
FOR THE ARMY,

254
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:20,777
AND THEY ALSO MADE AN ISSUE
THAT THE ARMY HAD TO DEAL WITH.

255
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,571
AND IF THE ARMY
HAD TO DEAL WITH IT,

256
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,656
THE WAR DEPARTMENT
HAD TO DEAL WITH IT.

257
00:14:24,823 --> 00:14:26,700
IF THE WAR DEPARTMENT
HAD TO DEAL WITH IT,

258
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:28,577
CONGRESS HAD
TO DEAL WITH IT.

259
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,871
THAT MEANS THAT
EVERY FUGITIVE SLAVE

260
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,998
WHO MADE A NUISANCE
OF HIMSELF

261
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,666
TO THE LOCAL COMMANDER

262
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,002
EVENTUALLY MADE
A FIGURE OF HIMSELF

263
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,962
TO THE CONGRESS
OF THE UNITED STATES.

264
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:43,049
CONGRESS,
CONTROLLED BY REPUBLICANS,

265
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,217
NOW FORBADE THE ARMY

266
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,387
TO RETURN SLAVES
TO THEIR MASTERS.

267
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,638
AND IN JUNE,

268
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,016
IT OUTLAWED SLAVERY
IN THE TERRITORIES,

269
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:54,811
FINALLY REVERSING
THE OLD DRED SCOTT DECISION.

270
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,230
"ONLY THE DAMNEDEST
OF DAMN ED ABOLITIONISTS

271
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,816
"DREAMED OF SUCH THINGS

272
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,985
"JOHN BROWN'S SOUL
IS MARCHING ON,

273
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,571

GEORGE TEMPLETON STRONG.

275
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,827
"THE SLAVERY QUESTION

"INTO SOMEWHAT
CLEARER LIGHT.

SO, YOU SEE,
THE MAN MOVES."

282
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,256
SALMON P. CHASE.

283
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,512
"JULY 4, 1862.

288
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:40,649
LINCOLN CONTINUED
TO BACK A PLAN

289
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:43,985
TO PAY $400
FOR EVERY SLAVE FREED

290
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:45,654
AND THEN ENCOURAGE
THE FREED MEN

291
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,823

THE ABOLITIONIST
WENDELL PHILLIPS

293
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:55,288
CALLED ABRAHAM LINCOLN

294
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,332
A FIRST-RATE
SECOND-RATE MAN.

295
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,671
I LOSE PATIENCE
WITH THE ARGUMENT

296
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,715
THAT BECAUSE
OF SOMEONE'S TIME,

297
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:10,011
HIS LIMITATIONS ARE THEREFORE
EXCUSABLE OR EVEN PRAISEWORTHY.

298
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,889
IT IS NOT TRUE
THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE

299
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:14,599
IN THAT TIME AND PLACE

300
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,518

COMMENTING ON
ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S PROPOSAL

303
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:24,275
TO COLONIZE BLACK PEOPLE
OUT OF THE COUNTRY,

304
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,485
WAS SARCASTIC.

305
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,196
HE SAID,
"COLONIZE THE BLACKS?

306
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,907
"A MAN MIGHT AS WELL
COLONIZE HIS OWN HANDS.

307

"OR WHEN THE ROBBER
IS IN HIS HOUSE,

308
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,036

COLONIZE HIS REVOLVER."

00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:43,211
"EMANCIPATION IS
THE DEMAND OF CIVILIZATION.

00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,300

RALPH WALDO EMERSON.

313
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,153
ON THE VIRGINIA
PENINSULA, THE RAINS CAME,

314
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,988
INUNDATING THE BOTTOMLANDS.

315
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,117
ALONG THE ROADS
OUTSIDE RICHMOND,

316
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,703
GEORGE McCLELLAN'S FORCE
WAS DIVIDED IN TWO

317
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,371
BY THE FLOODED
CHICKAHOMINY RIVER.

318
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,293
THE REBELS
SAW THEIR CHANCE

319
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,837
AND ATTACKED THE SMALLER FORCE
ON MAY 31 st.

320
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,613
IN THE FIERCE FIGHTING
THAT FOLLOWED,

321
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:30,759
THE CONFEDERATES DID BEST

322
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:33,928
NEAR A CROSSROADS
CALLED SEVEN PINES.

323
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,055
THE UNION SOLDIERS

324
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,973
WERE MOST SUCCESSFUL
AT FAIR OAKS.

325
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,736
WHEN THE BATTLE
OF FAIR OAKS WAS OVER,

326
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:52,781
THE NORTH HAD LOST
5,000 MEN,

327
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,657
THE SOUTH, 6,000,

328
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,744

CHANGED A THING.

SEVERELY WOUNDED

332
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:03,291

FROM THE FIELD.

"THE SHOT THAT

343
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,944
NOW FOR
THE FIRST TIME IN THE WAR,

344
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,529
ROBERT E. LEE WAS PLACED

345
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,072
AT THE HEAD OF A MAJOR ARMY.

346
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,285
"I PREFER LEE TO JOHNSTON.

347
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:40,662
"LEE IS TOO CAUTIOUS

348
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:43,206

BY HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY."

352
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,757
GEORGE McCLELLAN.

353
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,509
McCLELLAN COMPLETELY MISJUDGED

354
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,678
THE NEW CONFEDERATE COMMANDER.

355
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,972
ROBERT E. LEE
WAS A FIGHTER.

356
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,640
WANTING TO GET AT
THE UNION MEN

357
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,725
WHO HAD DARED
INVADE HIS STATE,

358
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,187
LEE RENAMED HIS FORCE
THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

359
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:08,815
SEIZED THE INITIATIVE,
AND NEVER LET IT GO.

360
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,821
FIRST, LEE SENT
HIS CAVALRY CHIEF, JEB STUART,

361
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,157
TO RECONNOITER
McCLELLAN'S FORCES.

362
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,284
STUART NOW LED
1,200 TROOPERS

363
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,829
ON A POUNDING 3-DAY,
150-MILE RIDE

364
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,039
AROUND McCLELLAN'S HUGE ARMY.

365
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,793
HIS MEN BURNED
FEDERAL CAMPS,

366
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,753
CUT DOWN TELEGRAPH POLES,

367
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,006
TOOK PRISONERS
AND HORSES AND MULES,

368
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,592
AND SLOWED ONLY
TO ACCEPT BOUQUETS AND KISSES

369
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,677
FROM WOMEN ALONG THE WAY.

370
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:38,845
IN VAIN PURSUIT

371
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:40,847
WAS STUART'S
OWN FATHER-IN-LAW,

372
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:42,807
WHO HAD STAYED LOYAL
TO THE UNION

373
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,143
AND BECOME A GENERAL--

374
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,855
A DECISION STUART SAID
HE WOULD "REGRET BUT ONCE,

375
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,274
AND THAT WILL BE
CONTINUOUSLY."

376
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,285
THROUGHOUT
THE WHOLE CAMPAIGN,

377
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:03,786
LEE CAREFULLY OBSERVED

378
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,832
McCLELLAN'S TENTATIVE ADVANCE
UP THE PENINSULA.

379
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,792
AS MCCLELLAN
WAS PREPARING AT LAST

380
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,544
TO LAY SIEGE TO RICHMOND,

381
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,254
LEE SURPRISED HIM FIRST,

382
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,840
AT MECHANICSVILLE ON JUNE 26th.

383
00:20:16,007 --> 00:20:18,468
IT WAS A DARING MOVE.

384
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,845
DEFYING
ALL MILITARY CONVENTION,

385
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,097
LEE DIVIDED HIS TINY FORCE

386
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,558
AND THEN ATTACKED
THE HUGE UNION ARMY,

387
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,518
GAMBLING THAT McCLELLAN
WOULD BE TOO CAUTIOUS

388
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:28,937
TO MOVE INTO RICHMOND.

389
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,565
LEE'S ASSAULT DIDN'T WORK.

390
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,443
HE LOST 1,500 MEN
AT MECHANICSVILLE,

391
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,403
BUT HE WOULD NOT LET UP.

392
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,530
DETERMINED TO DRIVE McCLELLAN
OUT OF VIRGINIA,

393
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,324
LEE KEPT ON THE ATTACK.

394
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,992
AND SO IT WENT.

395
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,120
FOR 7 DAYS,
THE TWO ARMIES CLASHED.

396
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,873
FROM GAINE'S MILL...

397
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,043
FROM SAVAGE'S STATION

398
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,171
TO FRAYSER'S FARM...

399
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,298
AND MALVERN HILL,

400
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,092
WHERE FEDERAL GUNNERS
STOPPED THE CONFEDERATES

401
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:00,969
WHO CAME AT THEM
UP THE LONG SLOPE.

402
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:09,310
"OUR EARS HAD BEEN
FILLED ALL NIGHT

403

404

"BUT ENOUGH OF THEM
WERE ALIVE AND MOVING

00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:27,745

A SINGULAR CRAWLING EFFECT."

410
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,837
"EACH OF THE BATTLES
OF THOSE 7 DAYS

ALL BUT ONE OF
THE BATTLES OF THE 7 DAYS

423
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,262
WERE UNION VICTORIES,

424
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,390
YET MCCLELLAN
TREATED THEM AS DEFEATS,

425
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,892
CONTINUING TO BACK DOWN

426
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:33,019
UNTIL HE REACHED THE SAFETY
OF FEDERAL GUNBOATS

427
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,938
AT HARRISON'S LANDING
ON THE JAMES RIVER.

428
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,399
UNION OFFICERS URGED
A COUNTERATTACK.

429
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,110
LEE HAD LOST 20,000 MEN.

430
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:42,320
MCCLELLAN REFUSED.

431

ONE OFFICER SUGGESTED

432
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:47,283
HIS COMMANDER
WAS MOTIVATED

433
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,369
EITHER BY "COWARDICE
OR TREASON."

434
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:52,914
IN JUST ONE WEEK,

435
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,125
LEE HAD COMPLETELY UNNERVED
THE UNION GENERAL

436
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,794
AND DEMONSTRATED
FOR THE FIRST TIME

437
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,797
THE STRENGTHS THAT
WOULD MAKE HIM A LEGEND--

438
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,840
SURPRISE, AUDACITY,

439
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,510
AND AN EERIE ABILITY
TO READ HIS OPPONENTS MIND.

440
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,805
IN JUST 7 DAYS,

441
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,307
MCCLELLAN HAD BEEN
TOTALLY OUT-GENERALED.

"I AM TIRED OF THE SICKENING

446
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,825
ON JULY 7th,

447
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,119
AN EXASPERATED LINCOLN
SAILED DOWN TO SEE

448
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:33,246
HIS COMMANDING GENERAL.

449
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,873
HE HAD NOT LOST,
MCCLELLAN INSISTED.

450
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,917
HE HAD MERELY
FAILED TO WIN.

451
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:42,213
HE NEEDED 50,000 MORE MEN,
OR PERHAPS 100,000.

452
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,048
NO SUCH NUMBERS
WERE AVAILABLE,

453
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,175
LINCOLN TOLD HIM.

454

IF MCCLELLAN
DID NOT FEEL

455
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:49,095
HE COULD RESUME
THE OFFENSIVE,

456
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:53,141
HIS MEN WOULD BE WITHDRAWN
FROM THE PENINSULA.

457

HIS HAT, PROMOTION PAPERS
ATTESTING TO HIS VALOR,

00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:01,741
AND A CARTRIDGE BOX

555
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:02,947
IN WHICH
SOMEONE HAD PLACED

556
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:05,703
THE MANGLED BULLET
THAT KILLED HIM.

557
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,413
HIS MOTHER REFUSED
TO LOOK AT IT.

00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:12,042
THE MEN OF
THE REDUCED FISHING FLEET

559
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,003
STRUGGLED TO HARVEST
A CATCH.

560
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,713
WIVES TENDED KITCHEN GARDENS

561
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,080
AND SCRAPED LINEN FOR THE LINT

562
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,091
FROM WHICH ARMY BANDAGES
WERE MADE.

563
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:23,554
MORE BAD NEWS ARRIVED.

564
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:25,681
PRIVATE ALEX HENDERSON
HAD DIED OF DISEASE

565
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:28,350
AT FORT JACKSON, LOUISIANA,

566
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:30,060
LEAVING A WIDOW
AND SEVERAL CHILDREN.

567
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:36,901
AT CLARKSVILLE, TENNESSEE,

568
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,444
TENSIONS
BETWEEN THE TOWN

569
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,030
AND THE OCCUPYING
UNION ARMY RAN HIGH.

570
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,493
FEDERAL TROOPS VANDALIZED
STEWART COLLEGE,

571
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:47,912
WRECKING LABORATORIES
AND STEALING BOOKS,

572
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:51,373
THEN SET UP
HEADQUARTERS THERE.

573
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,667
SOLDIERS BURST IN
ON A CHURCH SERVICE,

574
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:56,587
ARRESTED THE PREACHER,
COMMANDEERED HORSES,

575
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:58,547
AND FORCED
RELUCTANT PARISHIONERS

576
00:29:58,714 --> 00:29:59,924
TO TAKE A LOYALTY OATH.

577
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:04,929
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE,
THE RESIDENTS STAYED AT HOME.

578
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,319
THE ANSWER TO--
A SOUTHERNER WOULD GIVE YOU

579
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,822
AS TO WHY ARE YOU FIGHTING
IF YOU WERE A NORTHERNER"

580
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,616
HE VVOULD SAY, "I'M FIGHTING
'CAUSE YOU'RE DOWN HERE."

581
00:30:25,783 --> 00:30:27,117
HE WAS BEING INVADED,

582
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:29,787
AND HE FOUGHT, AS HE
THOUGHT, TO DEFEND HIS HOME.

583
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:31,914
LINCOLN HAD
A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT JOB

584
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,123
OF SENDING MEN OUT

585
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,711
TO SHOOT UP
SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOME.

586
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,382
AND HE HAD TO UNITE THEM
BEFORE HE COULD DO THAT.

587
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:43,008
AND HIS WAY OF DOING IT
WAS DOUBLE.

588
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:47,346
ONE WAS TO SAY THAT THE
REPUBLIC MUST BE PRESERVED,

589
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,348
NOT SPLIT IN TWO.
THAT WAS ONE.

590
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,142
AND THE OTHER ONE
HE GAVE THEM AS A CAUSE--

591
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,604
THE FREEING OF THE SLAVES.

592
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:59,149
ON THE MORNING
OF JULY 22, 1862,

593
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:01,902
THE PRESIDENT CALLED
A CABINET MEETING.

594
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,531
WHAT HE SAID
TOOK EVERYONE BY SURPRISE.

595
00:31:05,698 --> 00:31:07,867
AFTER LONG THOUGHT,
HE TOLD THEM,

596
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,244
HE HAD DECIDED
TO EMANCIPATE THE SLAVES.

597
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,916
IT WAS A STUNNING MOMENT.

598
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,501
IT WAS AGAINST EVERYTHING

599
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:21,338
LINCOLN HAD PROMISED
ALL THE REPUBLICANS

600
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,424
AND INDEED THE COUNTRY--

601
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:25,885
THAT HE WOULD NOT
BECOME AN ABOLITIONIST,

602
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,346
HE WOULD NOT STRIKE AT SLAVERY
WHERE IT EXISTED.

603
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,473
AND HERE, SUDDENLY,
HE WAS CHANGING

604
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,725
THE CHARACTER OF THE WAR.

605
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:36,854
BUT SECRETARY
OF STATE SEWARD WORRIED

606
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,481
THAT UNTIL THE ARMY HAD WON
A REAL VICTORY,

607
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,025
EMANCIPATION WOULD SEEM LIKE

608
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,695
THE LAST SHRIEK
ON THE RETREAT.

609
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:47,031
LINCOLN AGREED
TO WAIT FOR A VICTORY.

610
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,536
IT'S HARD TO SEPARATE
ONE ISSUE FROM ANOTHER.

611
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:56,040
OBVIOUSLY, LINCOLN
HAD TO WIN THE WAR.

612
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:59,793
HE HAD TO KEEP
HIS RESPECTABILITY

613
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,170
AS PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY

614
00:32:01,337 --> 00:32:03,714
THAT WOULD NOT ALLOW ITSELF
TO BE DEFEATED

615
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,716
BY A GROUP OF REBELS.

616
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:07,676
SO THAT WAS ALWAYS AN ISSUE,

617
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:11,972
AND IT WAS ESPECIALLY AN
ISSUE, OF COURSE, IN 1862.

618
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,059
HE COULD NOT LET HIMSELF
BE MADE A FOOL

619
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:17,019
AND THE UNION BE MADE A FOOL

620
00:32:17,186 --> 00:32:18,562
BY STANDING UP FOR PRINCIPLES

621
00:32:18,729 --> 00:32:20,940
THAT COULD NOT BE VINDICATED
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

622
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:21,875
DESPERATE FOR A VICTORY,
LINCOLN REMOVED McCLELLAN

623
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:26,505
AND PUT TALL, BOMBASTIC
JOHN POPE IN COMMAND.

624
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,840
POPE SO OFTEN BRAGGED

625
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:29,925
THAT HIS HEADQUARTERS
WERE IN THE SADDLE,

626
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,302
PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY
HE HAD HIS HEADQUARTERS

627
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:35,931
WHERE HIS HINDQUARTERS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

628
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:37,641
LINCOLN WAS WARNED
AT THE START

629
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:41,729
THAT POPE WAS NOT TO BE TRUSTED
WITH TELLING THE TRUTH.

630
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,940
AND LINCOLN SAID, "I'VE KNOWN
THE POPES BACK IN ILLINOIS.

631
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:47,651
"KNOWN ALL OF THEM. THEY'RE
ALL LIARS AND BRAGGARTS,

632
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,654
"BUT I DON'T KNOW OF ANY PARTICULAR
REASON WHY A LIAR AND A BRAGGART

633
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,990
SHOULDN'T MAKE
A GOOD GENERAL."

634
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:57,911
POPE WASTED NO TIME
CHARGING INTO NORTHERN VIRGINIA

635
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,788
AFTER THE REBEL ARMIES,

636
00:33:59,955 --> 00:34:02,666
BUT HE WAS IN TROUBLE
FROM THE START.

637
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:05,335
FIRST, STONEWALL JACKSON
FOUGHT HIM TO A STAND-OFF

638
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,837
AT CEDAR MOUNTAIN.

639
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,505
JEB STUART HIT HIM NEXT,

640
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,673
RAIDING HIS HEADQUARTERS

641
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,801
AND GETTING AWAY
WITH $35,000 IN CASH

642
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:16,346
AND THE UNION COMMANDER'S
DRESS COAT.

643
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,599
THEN THE REBELS
SIMPLY DISAPPEARED.

644
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,605
IT TOOK POPE
TWO DAYS TO FIND THEM,

645
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:26,815
DUG IN ALONG
AN ABANDONED RAILROAD

646
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:30,319
OVERLOOKING THE OLD
BULL RUN BATTLEFIELD.

647
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,865
ON AUGUST 29th, POPE ATTACKED,

648
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:37,993
PROMISING TO "BAG
THE WHOLE CROWD."

649
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,787
BUT THE CONFEDERATES HELD,

650
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,956
JACKSON'S MEN HURLING ROCKS
WHEN AMMUNITION RAN LOW.

651
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,378
AT 2:00 THE NEXT AFTERNOON,

652
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:50,631
CONFEDERATE GENERAL
JAMES LONGSTREET

653
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:53,717
SENT 5 DIVISIONS
STORMING INTO THE UNION FLANK.

654
00:34:56,637 --> 00:34:58,514
IT WAS ANOTHER
UNION DISASTER.

655
00:35:06,814 --> 00:35:10,025
25,000 MEN WERE KILLED,
WOUNDED, OR MISSING

656
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,361
AT SECOND BULL RUN,

657
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,529
FIVE TIMES THE FIGURE

658
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,489
THAT HAD SO HORRIFIED
THE COUNTRY

659
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:19,326
THE FIRST TIME
NORTH AND SOUTH FOUGHT THERE.

660
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:21,787
LINCOLN SENT POPE WEST
TO MINNESOTA

661
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:24,331
TO DEAL WITH AN UPRISING
AMONG THE SIOUX

662
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:26,416
AND RELUCTANTLY
PUT GEORGE MCCLELLAN

663
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,710
BACK IN COMMAND.

664
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,587
"WE MUST USE
THE TOOLS WE HAVE,"

665
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:31,630
LINCOLN SAID.

666
00:35:35,092 --> 00:35:36,593
MCCLELLAN TOLD HIS WIFE

667
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,595
HE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON
TO SAVE THE COUNTRY

668
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,721
ONCE AGAIN.

669
00:35:48,939 --> 00:35:50,499
"WE WOULD ASK
THE NORTH CAROLINIANS

670
00:35:50,566 --> 00:35:51,942
"IF THEY HAD ANY TAR

671
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,111
"AND CALL THEM TAR HEELS.

672
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:56,697
"THEY WOULD REPLY
THAT THEY WERE JUST OUT

673
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,366
"AS THEY HAD LET US VIRGINIANS
HAVE ALL THEY HAD

674
00:35:59,533 --> 00:36:01,827
"TO MAKE US STICK
IN THE LAST FIGHT

675
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:03,537
"AND CALL US SORE BACKS,

676
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,464
"AS THEY'D KNOCKED ALL
THE SKIN OFF OUR BACKS

677
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,624
"RUNNING OVER US
TO GET INTO BATTLE.

678
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,502
"AND SO IT WOULD GO,
BUT ALL IN THE BEST OF HUMOR,

679
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,671
KNOWING THAT ALL
DID THEIR DUTY."

680
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,634
JOHN CASLER, 33rd REGIMENT, VIRGINIA
INFANTRY, STONEWALL'S BRIGADE.

681
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:20,846
YOU MUST REMEMBER THEY

00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,818
"ON THE HARD SURFACE
OF THE PIKE

852
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,237
"WAS SO RAPID
AS TO BE CONTINUOUS,

853
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,574
"LIKE THE HISS
OF A GREAT SERPENT.

854
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,160
"THE SPECTRAL, GHOSTLY PICTURE

855
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:25,789
WILL NEVER BE ERASED
FROM MY MEMORY."

856
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:27,999
CAPTAIN EDWARD HASTINGS RIPLEY.

857
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,298
"AS NIGHT GREW NEARER,

858
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:36,675
"WHISPERS OF A GREAT BATTLE

00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:39,427
"TO BE FOUGHT THE NEXT
DAY GREW LOUDER,

00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,389
"AND WE SHUDDERED
AT THE PROSPECT,

861
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,599
"FOR THE BATTLES HAD
COME TO MEAN TO US,

862
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,768
"AS THEY NEVER HAD BEFORE,

863
00:44:46,935 --> 00:44:49,854
BLOOD, WOUNDS, AND DEATH."

864
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,177
THE BATTLE
THAT BEGAN THE NEXT DAY

865
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,837
WAS REALLY 3 BATTLES.

866
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:17,257
THE FIRST BEGAN AT 6 A.M.
ON LEE'S LEFT,

867
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:18,425
WHERE A FEDERAL FORCE

868
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,802
CHARGED ALONG
THE HAGERSTOWN PIKE

869
00:45:20,969 --> 00:45:23,221
TO ATTACK
STONEWALL JACKSON'S MEN

870
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:27,058
HIDDEN IN WOODS
BEYOND A BIG CORNFIELD.

871
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,184
THE UNION OBJECTIVE

872
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,229
WAS A PLATEAU
EDGED WITH ARTILLERY

873
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,898
ON WHICH STOOD A SMALL
WHITEWASHED CHURCH,

874
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:38,278
BUILT BY A GERMAN BAPTIST
PACIFIST SECT, THE DUNKARDS,

875
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:40,739
FOR WHOM EVEN A STEEPLE
WAS THOUGHT IMMODEST.

876
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:47,203
THE UNION FIELD COMMANDER
WAS MAJOR GENERAL JOE HOOKER,

877
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,956
A PROFANE AND HARD-DRINKING
MASSACHUSETTS SOLDIER

878
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,458
KNOWN AS FIGHTING JOE.

879
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,295
AS HOOKER
CAUTIOUSLY ADVANCED,

880
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,797
HE NOTICED THE GLINT OF BAYONETS
IN THE CORNFIELD

881
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,800
AND ORDERED 4 BATTERIES
TO FIRE INTO IT.

882
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,596
THE REBELS COUNTERCHARGED.

883
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:06,139
THE BATTLE SURGED
BACK AND FORTH

884
00:46:06,306 --> 00:46:08,892
ACROSS THE CORNFIELD
15 TIMES.

885
00:46:09,058 --> 00:46:10,351
IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,

886
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:16,232
THE 12th MASSACHUSETTS
LOST 224 OF 334 MEN.

887
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,109
HOOKER HIMSELF
WAS CARRIED FROM THE FIELD,

888
00:46:18,276 --> 00:46:19,277
SHOT THROUGH THE FOOT.

889
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:23,823
"THE MEN ARE
LOADING AND FIRING

890
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:25,533
"WITH DEMONIACAL FURY

891
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,577
"AND SHOUTING AND LAUGHING
HYSTERICALLY,

892
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:28,904
"AND THE WHOLE FIELD
BEFORE US

893
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,247
"IS COVERED WITH REBELS
FLEEING FOR LIFE

894
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,708
INTO THE WOODS."

895
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:37,545
HOOKER'S MEN WERE
CLOSING IN ON THE DUNKARD CHURCH.

896
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:41,758
AT THAT MOMENT, STONEWALL JACKSON
SENT IN HIS LAST RESERVES,

897
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:45,386
JOHN BELL HOOD'S DIVISION--
FIERCE FIGHTERS AT ANY TIME,

898
00:46:45,553 --> 00:46:47,430
BUT NOW ENRAGED
AT HAVING MISSED BREAKFAST,

899
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:50,308
WHICH HAD PROMISED TO BE
THEIR FIRST REAL MEAL IN DAYS.

900
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,394
THEIR FIRST VOLLEY WAS

901
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,271
"LIKE A SCYTHE RUNNING
THROUGH OUR LINE,"

902
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,608
ONE UNION SURVIVOR
REMEMBERED.

903
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:01,778
AND THEN THE CONFEDERATE
COUNTERATTACK CAME ON.

904
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,508
"EVERY STALK OF
CORN WAS CUT AS CLOSELY

905
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:25,635
"AS COULD HAVE BEEN DONE
WITH A KNIFE,

906
00:47:25,802 --> 00:47:28,304
"AND THE SLAIN LAY IN ROWS,

907
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:30,890
"PRECISELY AS THEY
HAD STOOD IN THEIR RANKS

908
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:33,184
A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE."

909
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:34,394
JOSEPH HOOKER.

910
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:43,278
THE NORTHERN TROOPS
RAN BACK THROUGH THE CORNFIELD.

911
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,655
HOOD'S MEN RAN AFTER THEM,
BUT WERE STOPPED

912
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:49,450
BY A HAIL OF SHELLS
AND FEDERAL REINFORCEMENTS.

913
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,619
WHEN THE CONFEDERATES
FINALLY WITHDREW,

914
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,831
ONE OFFICER ASKED HOOD
WHERE HIS DIVISION WAS.

915
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:57,125
"DEAD ON THE FIELD,"
HE ANSWERED.

916
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,090
"I HAVE NEVER
IN MY SOLDIER'S LIFE

917
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:04,257
"SEEN SUCH A SIGHT.

918
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,677
"THE DEAD AND WOUNDED
COVERED THE GROUND.

919
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:10,096
"IN ONE SPOT,
"A REBEL OFFICER AND 20 MEN

920
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:12,599
"LAY NEAR A WRECK
OF A BATTERY.

921
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:13,892
"IT IS SAID BATTERY 'A',

922
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:17,020
1st RHODE ISLAND ARTILLERY
DID THIS WORK."

923
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,396
ELISHA HUNT RHODES.

924
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:27,030
BY 10 A.M.,
8,000 MEN LAY DEAD OR WOUNDED.

925
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:29,324
JACKSON'S LINES
HAD WAVERED, BUT HELD.

926
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,165
AFTER HIS PART
OF THE BATTLE WAS OVER,

927
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,626
JACKSON WAS SITTING ON
HIS HORSE, EATING A PEACH,

928
00:48:39,792 --> 00:48:43,379
AND HIS MEDICAL DIRECTOR,
DR. MCGUIRE, WAS THERE.

929
00:48:43,546 --> 00:48:45,798
AND...

930
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,842
HE LOOKED OUT OVER THIS FIELD

931
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,637
WHERE THERE WERE DEAD OF BOTH SIDES
LITTERED ALL OVER THE PLACE.

932
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:51,888
AND AS HE'S EATING
THE PEACH, HE SAID,

933
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,057
"GOD HAS BEEN
VERY KIND TO US THIS DAY."

934
00:49:05,777 --> 00:49:07,377
THE SECOND PART OF
THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM

935
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,906
BEGAN AT THE CENTER
OF LEE'S LINE,

936
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:11,366
A SUNKEN COUNTRY ROAD

937
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,701
THAT NOW SERVED AS
A READY-MADE RIFLE PIT

938
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,871
FOR TWO
CONFEDERATE BRIGADES.

939
00:49:17,038 --> 00:49:21,167
LEE ORDERED IT HELD
AT ALL COSTS.

940
00:49:21,334 --> 00:49:23,252
GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON
ASSURED HIM,

941
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:25,171
"THESE MEN ARE GOING
TO STAY HERE, GENERAL,

942
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,507
TILL THE SUN GOES DOWN
OR VICTORY IS WON."

943
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:33,054
THEN THE UNION ATTACKED.

944
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,861
"THE BRAVE UNION COMMANDER,

945
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:37,934
"SUPERBLY MOUNTED,
PLACED HIMSELF IN FRONT,

946
00:49:38,101 --> 00:49:39,221
"WHILE HIS BAND CHEERED THEM

947
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,270
"WITH MARTIAL MUSIC.

948
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:44,107
"I THOUGHT, WHAT A PITY
TO SPOIL WITH BULLETS

949
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,818
SUCH A SCENE
OF MARTIAL BEAUTY."

950
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:48,027
GENERAL JOHN B. GORDON.

951
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,116
GORDON
LET THE BLUE LINE

952
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:54,826
GET WITHIN A FEW YARDS,

953
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,494
THEN GAVE THE ORDER
TO FIRE.

954
00:49:59,414 --> 00:50:01,374
THE UNION COMMANDER
WAS KILLED INSTANTLY.

955
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,793
HIS MEN WAVERED, RETREATED,
THEN CAME BACK

956
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:06,087
AT THE CONFEDERATES
5 MORE TIMES.

957
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,137
GORDON WAS HIT TWICE
IN THE RIGHT LEG,

958
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:15,388
ONCE IN THE LEFT ARM,

959
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:18,099
A FOURTH TIME
THROUGH THE SHOULDER.

960
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:19,892
HE REFUSED ALL AID,

961
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:21,936
LIMPING ALONG THE LINE
TO STEADY HIS MEN

962
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:25,148
AS THE FEDERALS KEPT COMING.

963
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,817
"I WAS FINALLY
SHOT DOWN BY A FIFTH BALL,

964
00:50:27,984 --> 00:50:30,403
"WHICH STRUCK ME
SQUARELY IN THE FACE.

965
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:32,280
"I FELL FORWARD
AND LAY UNCONSCIOUS

966
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:34,282
"WITH MY FACE IN MY CAP.

967
00:50:34,449 --> 00:50:36,159
"I MIGHT HAVE
SMOTHERED IN BLOOD

968
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:37,869
"BUT FOR A YANKEE BULLET HOLE

969
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,196
WHICH LET THE BLOOD RUN OUT."

970
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:43,166
STILL
THE CONFEDERATES HELD.

971
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,168
UNIT AFTER UNIT
OF NORTHERN TROOPS

972
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:49,130
FELL BACK FROM THE SHEETS
OF SOUTHERN FIRE.

973
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,841
FINALLY, SOME NEW YORKERS
MANAGED TO FIND A SPOT

974
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,248
FROM WHICH
THEY COULD SHOOT DOWN

975
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:55,219
ON THE ROAD'S DEFENDERS.

976
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,888
THE TIDE OF BATTLE TURNED.

977
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,476
THE SUNKEN ROAD,

978
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,352
REMEMBERED NOW
AS BLOODY LANE,

979
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,313
RAPIDLY FILLED
WITH SOUTHERN BODIES,

980
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,648
TWO AND 3 DEEP,

981
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:09,442
AND THE TRIUMPHANT FEDERALS
KNELT ON TOP

982
00:51:09,609 --> 00:51:12,278
OF WHAT ONE CALLED
"THIS GHASTLY FLOORING"

983
00:51:12,445 --> 00:51:14,155
TO FIRE AT
THE FLEEING SURVIVORS.

984
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:19,660
THE CONFEDERATE CENTER
HAD SPLINTERED.

985
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,413
ONE MORE PUSH MIGHT
HAVE BROKEN IT APART.

986
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,707
GENERAL McCLELLAN, HOWEVER,

987
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,794
DECIDED IT "WOULD NOT
BE PRUDENT" TO ATTACK AGAIN.

988
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:35,009
ALL DAY LONG, IN HASTILY
CONSTRUCTED FIELD HOSPITALS,

989
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:37,678
CLARA BARTON
TENDED THE WOUNDED.

990
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:39,263
SHE WORKED SO CLOSE
TO THE FIGHTING

991
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,932
THAT A BULLET
WENT THROUGH HER SLEEVE

992
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,475
AND KILLED A MAN
SHE WAS TREATING.

993
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:46,426
"I HAD TO WRING
THE BLOOD

994
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:48,064
"FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY CLOTHING

995
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:50,483
"BEFORE I COULD STEP,

996
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,110
FOR THE WEIGHT ABOUT MY FEET."

997
00:51:58,116 --> 00:52:00,952
"I WAS LYING ON MY BACK,
SUPPORTED ON MY ELBOWS,

998
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:03,913
"WATCHING THE SHELLS EXPLODE
OVERHEAD AND SPECULATING

999
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,082
"AS TO HOW LONG I COULD
HOLD UP MY FINGER

1000
00:52:06,249 --> 00:52:08,417
"BEFORE IT WOULD BE SHOT OFF.

1001
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,795
"WHEN THE ORDER
TO GET UP WAS GIVEN,

1002
00:52:10,962 --> 00:52:13,256
"I TURNED OVER TO LOOK
AT COLONEL KIMBALL,

1003
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:16,801
THINKING HE HAD BECOME
SUDDENLY INSANE."

1004
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:18,302
LIEUTENANT MATTHEW J. GROHAN.

1005
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:25,726
THE THIRD BATTLE TOOK
PLACE ON THE CONFEDERATE RIGHT,

1006
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:28,980
WHERE THE UNION ARMY,
LED BY GENERAL BURNSIDE'S CORPS,

1007
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:30,189
TRIED TO FIGHT ITS WAY

1008
00:52:30,356 --> 00:52:32,400
ACROSS A STRONGLY DEFENDED
STONE BRIDGE

1009
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:33,609
OVER ANTIETAM CREEK.

1010
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,449
AMBROSE BURNSIDE WAS
A GENIAL, DAPPER MAN--

1011
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:44,287
HIS DISTINCTIVE WHISKERS
OR SIDEBURNS SET A FASHION--

1012
00:52:44,453 --> 00:52:46,122
BUT "HE SHRANK
FROM RESPONSIBILITY,"

1013
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:48,124
AN ADMIRING
FELLOW OFFICER SAID,

1014
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:49,542
"WITH SINCERE MODESTY,"

1015
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:50,877
AND HE OWED HIS POSITION

1016
00:52:51,043 --> 00:52:53,671
TO HIS OLD FRIEND MCCLELLAN,
WHO NOW PROMISED

1017
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,048
TO SUPPORT HIS ASSAULT
ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

1018
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,220
BURNSIDE HAD 12,500 MEN

1019
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:03,264
AGAINST BARELY
400 GEORGIANS

1020
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,850
LED BY ROBERT TOOMBS.

1021
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,577
BUT THE CONFEDERATES
COMMANDED THE BLUFF

1022
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:09,145
OVERLOOKING THE BRIDGE

1023
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:11,314
AND POURED
A RELENTLESS VOLLEY OF FIRE

1024
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:12,899
DOWN ON THE UNION TROOPS.

1025
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:18,196
IT TOOK 3 HOURS
AND 3 BLOODY CHARGES

1026
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,114
FOR THE FEDERALS
TO CROSS THE CREEK

1027
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,158
AND BEGIN FIGHTING
THEIR WAY UP THE SLOPE

1028
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,242
TOWARDS SHARPSBURG.

1029
00:53:26,162 --> 00:53:28,998
7 SUCCESSIVE UNION
COLOR BEARERS WERE HIT

1030
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,000
BEFORE THE CONFEDERATES
FINALLY BROKE,

1031
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,418
RACING BACK INTO THE TOWN.

1032
00:53:36,005 --> 00:53:37,965
"HOW I RAN.

1033
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:39,926
"I WAS AFRAID OF BEING
STRUCK IN THE BACK,

1034
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,969
"AND I FREQUENTLY TURNED
AROUND IN RUNNING

1035
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:44,222
"SO AS TO AVOID,
IF POSSIBLE,

1036
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:47,016
SO DISGRACEFUL A WOUND."

1037
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:49,310
PRIVATE JOHN DOOLEY.

1038
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:51,437
UNION VICTORY
AGAIN SEEMED CERTAIN.

1039
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,025
BUT WHILE
THE UNION TROOPS CHEERED,

1040
00:53:56,192 --> 00:53:58,069
THE CONFEDERATE LIGHT
DIVISION WAS ARRIVING

1041
00:53:58,236 --> 00:54:00,446
FROM HARPERS FERRY...

1042
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:04,033
3,000 MEN, FOOTSORE
FROM THEIR 17-MILE MARCH,

1043
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,952
BUT OTHERWISE READY TO FIGHT

1044
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,287
AND COMMANDED
BY GENERAL A.P. HILL,

1045
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:12,750
DRESSED IN THE RED SHIRT
HE LIKED TO WEAR IN BATTLE.

1046
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:15,878
"A.P. HILL IS THE
FIGHTINGEST DIVISION COMMANDER

1047
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:17,713
"IN LEE'S ARMY.

1048
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,884
"HILL ARRIVED AT ANOTHER ONE OF
THOSE NICK-OF-THE-MOMENT THINGS,

1049

"AND IT WAS THE LAST ONE,

1050
00:54:24,262 --> 00:54:26,430
"AND IT SUCCEEDED
IN THROWING BURNSIDE BACK

1051
00:54:26,597 --> 00:54:28,474
AFTER HE FINALLY
GOT ACROSS THE BRIDGE."

1052
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:35,398
HILL SLAMMED INTO
THE CELEBRATING UNION TROOPS.

1053
00:54:35,564 --> 00:54:37,733
BURNSIDE BEGGED MCCLELLAN
TO SEND UP

1054
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,278
THE REINFORCEMENTS
HE HAD PROMISED.

1055
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:41,779
MCCLELLAN REFUSED.

1056
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,035
AS NIGHT FELL,
BURNSIDE WITHDREW

1057
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:51,580
TO THE STONE BRIDGE HIS MEN
HAD FOUGHT SO HARD TO SEIZE.

1058
00:54:53,332 --> 00:54:55,042
THE BATTLE WAS OVER.

1059
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,420
NO GROUND HAD BEEN GAINED.

1060
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,291
"BEFORE
THE SUNLIGHT FADED,

1066
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:53,809
"THERE WAS NO SECESSION

"NOR IN THOSE FIXED EYES

1068
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,315
CLEARLY, IT WAS NOT <i>THEIR</i> WAR."

1069
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:05,071
"THE SUN WENT DOWN.
THE THUNDER DIED AWAY.

AS IF A GREAT CITY
HAD LIGHTED ITS LAMPS."

1073
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,018
IT HAD BEEN
THE BLOODIEST DAY

1074
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:19,335
IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

1075
00:56:19,502 --> 00:56:23,172
THE UNION LOST 2,108 DEAD,

1076
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:27,510
ANOTHER 10,293 WOUNDED
OR MISSING--

1077
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:32,014
DOUBLE THE CASUALTIES
OF D-DAY 82 YEARS LATER.

1078
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:34,183
LEE LOST FEWER MEN--

1079
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:37,978
10,318 CASUALTIES--

1080
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:40,189
BUT THAT WAS A QUARTER
OF HIS ARMY.

1081
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:51,826
"WHY DID WE NOT ATTACK THEM

1082
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,286
"AND DRIVE THEM INTO THE RIVER?

"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND
THESE THINGS.

1084
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:59,500
BUT THEN, I AM ONLY A BOY."

1085
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:01,001
ELISHA HUNT RHODES.

1086
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:06,353
McCLELLAN HAD PLENTY OF RESERVES

1087
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,467
WAITING OUTSIDE SHARPSBURG,

1088
00:57:08,634 --> 00:57:09,593
BUT HE NEVER USED THEM.

1089
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:13,389
LEE, OUTNUMBERED 3-TO-1,

1090
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:16,392
BRACED FOR A NEW ATTACK
ALL THE NEXT DAY.

1091
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,019
IT NEVER CAME.

1092
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:21,480
ON THE 18th,
LEE AND HIS ARMY SLIPPED BACK

1093
00:57:21,647 --> 00:57:24,275
ACROSS THE POTOMAC.

1094
00:57:24,442 --> 00:57:26,777
MCCLELLAN COULD CLAIM
A VICTORY,

1095
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,238
BUT HE COULD HAVE WON
THE WAR.

1096
00:57:29,405 --> 00:57:31,490
LEE'S INVASION
HAD BEEN HALTED,

1097
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:34,201
HE HAD SUFFERED
TERRIBLE LOSSES,

1098
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,371
BUT HIS ARMY
HAD NOT BEEN DESTROYED.

1099
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,926
"THE CAUSES OF THE WAR
WERE WIDE APART,

1100
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:54,138
BUT THE MAN HOOD WAS THE SAME."

1101
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:57,391
JOSHUA LAWRENCE CHAMBERLAIN,
20th MAINE.

1102
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,146
HELD IN RESERVE
OUTSIDE SHARPSBURG,

1103
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,857
THE 20th MAINE INCLUDED
FARMERS AND LUMBERMEN,

1104
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:07,485
SEAMEN AND SHOPKEEPERS
AND TRAPPERS.

1105
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:10,905
ITS COLONEL WAS
JOSHUA LAWRENCE CHAMBERLAIN,

1106
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,991
A 33-YEAR-OLD PROFESSOR
OF RHETORIC, ORATORY,

1107
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:17,119
AND MODERN LANGUAGES
AT BOWDOIN COLLEGE.

1108
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:19,538
DENIED A LEAVE OF ABSENCE
TO ENLIST,

1109
00:58:19,705 --> 00:58:21,999
HE APPLIED FOR A SABBATICAL
TO STUDY IN EUROPE,

1110
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,001
THEN VOLUNTEERED.

1111
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:27,004
ON PAPER, HIS ONLY
QUALIFICATION FOR COMMAND

1112
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:29,673
WAS THAT HE WAS A GENTLEMAN
OF THE HIGHEST MORAL,

1113
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,759
INTELLECTUAL,
AND LITERARY WORTH.

1114
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,055
CHAMBERLAIN WAS STILL
AT SHARPSBURG

1115
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:38,724
WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN
CAME TO SEE THE BATTLEFIELD.

1116
00:58:43,938 --> 00:58:45,564
"WE COULD SEE
THE DEEP SADNESS

1117
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,066
"IN THE PRESIDENT'S FACE

1118
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:49,652
"AND FEEL THE BURDEN

1119
00:58:49,818 --> 00:58:52,530
"THINKING OF HIS GREAT
COMMISSION TO SAVE THIS PEOPLE

1120
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:55,032

DO THIS NO OTHERWISE

1121
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,909
"THAN AS HE HAD BEEN DOING--

1122
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:59,245
BY AND THROUGH
THE MANLINESS OF THESE MEN."

1123
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,919
WATCHING THE
PRESIDENT REVIEW HIS TROOPS,

1124
00:59:07,086 --> 00:59:09,588
IT SEEMED TO
JOSHUA LAWRENCE CHAMBERLAIN

1125
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:13,050
THAT A "MYSTIC BOND,
WONDERFUL IN ITS INTENSITY,"

1126
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,135
JOINED THE MEN
TO THEIR COMMANDER IN CHIEF.

1127
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:21,433
THE OBJECT
OF LINCOLN'S VISIT

1128
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,312
WAS TO GET MCCLELLAN
TO PURSUE LEE.

1129
00:59:25,479 --> 00:59:27,731
"I CAME BACK THINKING
HE WOULD MOVE AT ONCE.

1130
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:29,066
"BUT WHEN I GOT HOME,

1131
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:32,027
"HE BEGAN TO ARGUE
WHY HE OUGHT NOT TO MOVE.

1132
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:35,072
"I PEREMPTORILY
ORDERED HIM TO ADVANCE.

1133
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:38,576
"IT WAS 19 DAYS BEFORE
HE PUT A MAN OVER THE RIVER,

1134
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,662
"AND 9 DAYS LONGER BEFORE
HE GOT HIS ARMY ACROSS.

1135
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:43,622
AND THEN HE STOPPED AGAIN."

1136
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,379
LINCOLN AT LAST HAD
HAD ENOUGH OF GEORGE MCCLELLAN.

1137
00:59:50,546 --> 00:59:54,091
THE PRESIDENT RELIEVED HIM
OF COMMAND PERMANENTLY.

1138
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:56,927
"THEY HAVE MADE
A GREAT MISTAKE.

1139

IN OCTOBER OF 1862,
AT HIS NEW YORK GALLERY,

1165
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:39,738
MATHEW BRADY OPENED
AN EXHIBITION OF PHOTOGRAPHS

1166

ENTITLED
"THE DEAD OF ANTIETAM."

1167
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:45,536
NOTHING LIKE THEM HAD EVER
BEEN SEEN IN AMERICA BEFORE.

1185
01:02:57,191 --> 01:03:00,569
"IS THE NAIL THAT HOLDS THE
SOUTH'S TWO HALVES TOGETHER."

1186
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:04,573
THAT FALL,
GRANT TRIED TO TAKE

1187
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,117
THE HEAVILY FORTIFIED CITY.

1188
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,453
HE FAILED.

1189
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,020
THE CONFEDERACY WAS
ON THE OFFENSIVE

1190
01:03:11,163 --> 01:03:14,124
OVER A 1,000-MILE FRONT.

1191
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,585
MR. GLADSTONE, A POWER
IN THE ENGLISH CABINET,

1192
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:19,463
IS SAYING,
"JEFF DAVIS HAS MADE A NAVY.

1193
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,840
HE'S MADE AN ARMY,"
AND, WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT,

1194
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,384
INTIMATING THAT
HE'S MADE A NATION.

1195
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:27,304
BUT THE INVASION
OF MARYLAND FAILS.

1196
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:31,975
LEE IS DEFEATED, FALLS BACK.

1197
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:34,561
THEY LOSE AT PERRYVILLE
IN KENTUCKY.

1198
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,488
THEY LOSE AT IUKA
AND CORINTH IN MISSISSIPPI,

1199
01:03:36,647 --> 01:03:37,981
AND EVEN NEWTONIA IN MISSOURI.

1200
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:42,110
AND THE CONFEDERATE TIDE
ROLLS BACK.

1201
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,780
LINCOLN, AS A RESULT
OF ANTIETAM,

1202
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:46,824
CONVERTED THE WAR
TO A HIGHER PLANE,

1203
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,701
AGAIN THE MASTER POLITICIAN.

1204
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:52,996
HE ANNOUNCES A PRELIMINARY
EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.

1205
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,203
OF COURSE, IT DOESN'T FREE
A SINGLE SLAVE IN REVOLT,

1206
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,667
FREES ONLY AS A WAR MEASURE

1207
01:03:56,834 --> 01:03:59,837
AND ONLY FREES
THE SLAVES IN STATES

1208
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,631
WHERE THE CONFEDERACY
IS IN CONTROL,

1209
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,509
AND IT WILL TAKE EFFECT
ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY.

1210
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,847
"ON THE FIRST
DAY OF JANUARY,

1211

ON SEPTEMBER 22nd,

1219
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,544
JUST 5 DAYS AFTER
THE BATTLE OF ANTIETAM,

01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:44,673
THE PRESIDENT ISSUED
HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.

LINCOLN SAID,

1223
01:04:48,302 --> 01:04:49,970
"IT WILL BE FOR THIS ACT."

1224
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:54,182
THE SOUTH WAS OUTRAGED.

1225
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,935
JEFFERSON DAVIS CALLED IT
THE "MOST EXECRABLE MEASURE

1226
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,229
RECORDED IN THE HISTORY
OF GUILTY MAN."

NEITHER ENGLAND NOR FRANCE
WAS WILLING OPENLY TO OPPOSE
