1
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:17,018
THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH
I'M VERY FOND OF.

2
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,186
IT SHOWS
3 CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS

3
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,148
WHO WERE CAPTURED
AT GETTYSBURG,

4
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,443
AND THEY HAVE POSED IN FRONT OF
OR ALONGSIDE

5
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,319
A SNAKE-RAIL FENCE.

6
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,612
AND YOU SEE EXACTLY HOW

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:31,115
THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIER
WAS DRESSED.

8
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,951
YOU SEE SOMETHING IN
HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD THE CAMERA

9
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,162
THAT'S REVEALING
OF HIS NATURE,

10
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:41,792
AND ONE OF THEM
HAS HIS ARMS LIKE THIS,

11
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,753
AS IF HE'S HAVING
HIS PICTURE MADE,

12
00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:47,423
BUT HE'S DETERMINED TO BE
THE INDIVIDUAL HE IS.

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,799
AND THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT THAT PICTURE

14
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:51,635
THAT DRAWS ME STRONGLY
AS AN IMAGE OF THE WAR.

15
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,440
MORE THAN ONCE
DURING THE CIVIL WAR,

16
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:08,152
NEWSPAPERS REPORTED
A STRANGE PHENOMENON.

17
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,820
FROM ONLY
A FEW MILES AWAY,

18
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,656
A BATTLE SOMETIMES
MADE NO SOUND,

19
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,992
DESPITE THE FLASH
AND SMOKE OF CANNON

20
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,786
AND THE FACT
THAT MORE-DISTANT OBSERVERS

21
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,996
COULD HEAR IT CLEARLY.

22
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:23,250
THESE EERIE SILENCES
WERE CALLED ACOUSTIC SHADOWS.

23
00:01:40,476 --> 00:01:42,186
IN THE SUMMER OF 1863,

24
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:43,687
A UNION WARSHIP,

25
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,899
HUNTING A CONFEDERATE
COMMERCE RAIDER OFF YOKOHAMA,

26
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,567
ATTACKED A JAPANESE FLEET

27
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:52,446
FOR HARASSING THE COLONY
OF WESTERNERS THERE.

28
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,824
THE UNITED STATES WON
ITS FIRST NAVAL BATTLE

29
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,326
AGAINST THE EMPIRE
OF JAPAN,

30
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,161
BUT THE CON FEDERATES
GOT AWAY.

31
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,919
IN PARIS THAT YEAR,

32
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:10,214
NEW PAINTINGS BY CEZANNE,
WHISTLER, AND MANET

33
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:14,301
WERE SHOWN AT A SPECIAL EXHIBIT
FOR OUTCASTS.

34
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,470
IN RUSSIA,
DOSTOYEVSKY FINISHED

35
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,597
<i>NOTES FROM THE UNDERGROUND,</i>

36
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:19,974
AND IN LONDON,

37
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:22,935
KARL MARX LABORED TO COMPLETE
HIS MASTERPIECE,

38
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:24,228
<i>DAS KAPITAL.</i>

39
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,194
FOR THE FIRST 6 MONTHS
OF 1863,

40
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,488
ROBERT E. LEE
AND STONEWALL JACKSON

41
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,824
HAD CARRIED OUT
ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY

42
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:40,870
MILITARY CAMPAIGNS IN HISTORY,

43
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:42,913
SMASHING
HUGE FEDERAL ARMIES

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,875
AT FREDERICKSBURG
AND CHANCELLORSVILLE

45
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,127
AND WINNING THE UNDYING LOVE
OF THE SOUTH.

46
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:55,718
BUT BY LATE MAY,
CONFEDERATE LUCK HAD CHANGED.

47
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,011
JACKSON WAS DEAD.

48
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:02,766
A THOUSAND MILES TO THE WEST,
ULYSSES S. GRANT'S SIEGE

49
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,935
OF THE REBEL STRONGHOLD
AT VICKSBURG

50
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,729
HAD GONE ON SO LONG

51
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:11,775
THAT GRANT HIMSELF HAD TAKEN
TO THE BOTTLE OUT OF BOREDOM.

52
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:12,943
AS JUNE BEGAN,

53
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,862
THE CONFEDERATES
INSIDE THE TOWN

54
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,780
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO HOLD ON.

55
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,828
NOW, TO DRAW FEDERAL TROOPS
AWAY FROM VICKSBURG,

56
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,040
LEE LED HIS ARMY
ONTO NORTHERN SOIL AGAIN,

57
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:28,042
LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT
TO ATTACK.

58
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:35,049
WHEN IT CAME,
ON THE MORNING OF JULY 1, 1863,

59
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,468
IT WOULD BE
IN THE MOST ORDINARY OF PLACES.

60
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,680
FOR 3 DAYS,

61
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:45,142
150,000 MEN WOULD MAKE WAR
ON EACH OTHER

62
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,937
IN THE GENTLE FARMLAND
OF SOUTH PENNSYLVANIA.

63
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,983
WHEN THE THIRD DAY WAS OVER,
IT WOULD PROVE TO HAVE BEEN

64
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,527
THE MOST CRUCIAL DAY
OF THE ENTIRE WAR.

65
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,575
IN THE SOUTH,
THE WAR HAD RUINED THE ECONOMY,

66
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:03,369
AND YET THE SOUTHERN
FIGHTING SPIRIT

67
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,955
WAS STRONGER
THAN EVER BEFORE.

68
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,540
IN THE NORTH,
WHERE INDUSTRY WAS BOOMING,

69
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,043
ANGRY WORKING MEN WOULD SOON
TAKE TO THE STREETS

70
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,421
IN PROTEST AGAINST
EMANCIPATION AND THE WAR.

71
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:20,094
AT THE END OF THE YEAR,
ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD TRAVEL

72
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,972
TO THE NOW-QUIET FIELDS
AT GETTYSBURG

73
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,182
AND STRUGGLE
TO PUT INTO WORDS

74
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,101
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
TO HIS PEOPLE.

75
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,359
WHEN A BLACK SOLDIER
IN NEW ORLEANS SAID,

76
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,862
"LIBERTY MUST TAKE THE DAY,
NOTHING SHORTER,"

77
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,031
HE SAID, IN EFFECT,

78
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,993
THAT WHEN WE COUNT UP
THOSE WHO HAVE DIED,

79
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,703
WHEN WE SURVEY
THE CARNAGE,

80
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,664
IT MUST BE
FOR SOMETHING HIGHER

81
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:53,419
THAN UNION AND FREE NAVIGATION
OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.

82
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,090
DURING THE SUMMER
OF 1863,

83
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:02,219
A CONVENTION OF FREE
BLACK PEOPLE DEMANDED THE RIGHT

84
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:06,015
FOR BLACK MEN TO TAKE PART
IN THE STRUGGLE AS SOLDIERS,

85
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,434
AND THEIR
KEY RESOLUTION SAID,

86
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,603
"IT IS TIME NOW
FOR MORE EFFECTIVE REMEDIES

87
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,063
"TO BE THOROUGHLY TRIED

88
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,775
"IN THE SHAPE OF WARM LEAD
AND COLD STEEL

89
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,404
DULY ADMINISTERED
BY 100,000 BLACK DOCTORS."

90
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:29,705
EARLY IN THE WAR,

91
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,915
A FUGITIVE SLAVE
NAMED ALEX TURNER

92
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,292
HAD MADE HIS WAY NORTH

93
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:37,046
AND JOINED
THE 1st NEW JERSEY CAVALRY.

94
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,506
IN THE SPRING OF 1863,

95
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,092
HE GUIDED HIS REGIMENT
BACK TO HIS OLD PLANTATION

96
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,971
AT PORT ROYAL, VIRGINIA,
AND KILLED HIS FORMER OVERSEER.

97
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:49,725
WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER,

98
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:54,229
HE WENT TO NEW ENGLAND
AND FOUND WORK AS A LOGGER.

99
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:57,649
IN 1883, HIS DAUGHTER DAISY
WAS BORN.

100
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,990
"DEAR MADAM,

101
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,576
"I AM A SOLDIER,

102
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:10,621
"AND MY SPEECH
IS ROUGH AND PLAIN.

103
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,915
"I'M NOT
MUCH USED TO WRITING,

104
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,834
"AND I HATE
TO GIVE YOU PAIN,

105
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,587
"BUT I PROMISED
I WOULD DO IT,

106
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:21,632
"AND HE THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE SO,

107
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,468
"IF IT CAME FROM ONE
THAT LOVED HIM

108
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,679
"PERHAPS IT WOULD
EASE THE BLOW.

109
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,100
"BY THIS TIME,
YOU MUST SURELY GUESS

110
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,811
"THE TRUTH
I FEIGN WOULD HIDE,

111
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,481
"AND YOU PARDON ME
FOR ROUGH SOLDIER WORDS,

112
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,400
WHILE I TELL YOU
HOW HE DIED."

113
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,041
"THIS ARMY HAS NEVER
DONE SUCH FIGHTING

114
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,168
"AS IT WILL DO NOW.

115
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,296
"WE MUST CONQUER A PEACE.

116
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,883
WE WILL SHOW THE YANKEES
THIS TIME HOW WE CAN FIGHT."

117
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,552
PRIVATE WILLIAM CHRISTIAN.

118
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,431
LATE IN MAY,
LEE'S ARMY

119
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,266
MARCHED TOWARD PENNSYLVANIA.

120
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,689
UNION TROOPS SENT TO SEE
WHAT THEY WERE UP TO

121
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,733
COMPLETELY SURPRISED JEB STUART
AND HIS CONFEDERATE CAVALRY

122
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,318
AT BRANDY STATION, VIRGINIA.

123
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:29,074
21,000 MOUNTED MEN
CLASHED ALONG THE RAPPAHANNOCK

124
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:30,325
FOR 12 HOURS.

125
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,788
IT WAS THE BIGGEST
CAVALRY ENGAGEMENT

126
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:36,206
IN AMERICAN HISTORY,

127
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,750
AND IT WAS A STAND-OFF,

128
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,127
BUT THE NORTH HAD LEARNED

129
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:41,712
THE CONFEDERATES
WERE ON THE MOVE.

130
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,717
THE FLAMBOYANT STUART,

131
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,969
EMBARRASSED AT HAVING BEEN
CAUGHT OFF GUARD

132
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,054
AND DETERMINED
TO REDEEM HIMSELF,

133
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,184
NOW TOOK OFF ON ANOTHER DARING
RIDE AROUND THE UNION ARMY

134
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,145
WITH STRICT ORDERS TO STAY
IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH LEE.

135
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:06,487
LEE'S 70,000 MEN
WERE DIVIDED INTO 3 CORPS.

136
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,157
THE FIRST WAS COMMANDED
BY JAMES LONGSTREET, "OLD PETE,"

137
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:13,869
WHOM LEE CALLED
"MY WARHORSE."

138
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,206
THE SECOND CORPS,
STONEWALL JACKSON'S OLD COMMAND,

139
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,458
WAS UNDER
RICHARD "BALDY" EWELL,

140
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,253
WHO HAD LOST A LEG
AT SECOND MANASSAS.

141
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,506
THE THIRD WAS LED
BY A.P. HILL,

142
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,925
A NEW CORPS COMMANDER
FROM VIRGINIA

143
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,470
WHO HAD HELPED STAVE OFF
DISASTER AT SHARPSBURG IN 1862.

144
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:36,975
ON JUNE 16,
LEE'S ADVANCE COLUMN

145
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:39,937
CROSSED THE POTOMAC
INTO MARYLAND.

146
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,606
AN EVEN LARGER
UNION ARMY FOLLOWED,

147
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,275
CAREFUL TO KEEP BETWEEN
THE CONFEDERATES AND WASHINGTON.

148
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,034
THE NEW UNION COMMANDER
WAS GEORGE MEADE.

149
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,246
BLUNT AND BOOKISH, HE WAS
REFERRED TO BY SUBORDINATES

150
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:00,999
AS "A DAMNED, OLD,
GOGGLE-EYED SNAPPING TURTLE."

151
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,670
IF THE UNION GENERALS WERE
NOT SURE WHERE LEE WAS GOING,

152
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:08,715
LEE HAD NO IDEA WHERE
THE UNION ARMY EVEN WAS.

153
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,008
JEB STUART'S CAVALRY

154
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,135
HAD RIDDEN TOO FAR
FROM THE ADVANCING ARMY

155
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:14,721
TO KEEP HIM INFORMED.

156
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,641
THE CONFEDERATES MARCHED THROUGH
MARYLAND ON INTO PENNSYLVANIA.

157
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,309
IT'S VERY HANDSOME
COUNTRY THERE.

158
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:21,395
THE BARNS ARE MAGNIFICENT

159
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,022
AND THE GREEN FIELDS
AND EVERYTHING,

160
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:28,235
AND THE PEOPLE WATCHING
THESE CONFEDERATES GO BY.

161
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,363
AND THERE WAS
A BLACK BODY SERVANT

162
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,406
IN THE COLUMN,

163
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:35,117
AND THEY STOPPED,
JUST A HALT,

164
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,578
AND THE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE
ASKED HIM

165
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,539
WHAT HE THOUGHT
OF THIS COUNTRY AROUND HERE.

166
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:43,458
AND HE SAID,
"THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY,

167
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,877
BUT IT DOESN'T COME UP TO HOME
IN MY EYES."

168
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:53,385
PANIC SPREAD
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRYSIDE.

169
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,805
LEE'S MEN SEIZED LIVESTOCK,
FOOD, WAGONS, AND CLOTHING

170
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,307
FROM CIVILIANS,

171
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:02,102
GIVING THEM WORTHLESS
CONFEDERATE SCRIP IN EXCHANGE.

172
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,187
THEY ALSO
SEIZED FREE BLACKS

173
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,566
AND SENT THEM SOUTH
INTO SLAVERY.

174
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,651
"MY FRIENDS,"
A SOUTHERN OFFICER ASKED

175
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,362
THE FRIGHTENED INHABITANTS
OF ONE PENNSYLVANIA TOWN,

176
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,614
"HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS WAY

177
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,574
OF OUR COMING BACK
INTO THE UNION?"

178
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,666
"IT WAS
IN THE MORROW'S BATTLE

179
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,419
"FAST RAINED
THE SHOT AND SHELL,

180
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,380
"I WAS STANDING
CLOSE BESIDE HIM,

181
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:32,716
AND I SAW HIM
WHEN HE FELL."

182
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,095
"AND SO I TOOK HIM
IN MY ARMS,

183
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,348
"AND LAID HIM
ON THE GRASS.

184
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,725
"IT WAS
GOING AGAINST ORDERS,

185
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:45,062
"BUT I THINK
THEY LET IT PASS.

186
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:47,564
"'TWAS A MINIE BALL
THAT STRUCK HIM,

187
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,941
"IT ENTERED AT HIS SIDE,

188
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,819
"BUT WE DIDN'T
THINK IT FATAL,

189
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:55,280
TILL THIS MORNING,
WHEN HE DIED."

190
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,710
THE GREATEST BATTLE EVER
FOUGHT IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE

191
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,004
BEGAN AS A CLASH OVER SHOES.

192
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,843
AT DAWN ON JULY 1,

193
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,763
A CONFEDERATE INFANTRY OFFICER
LED HIS MEN TOWARD

194
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,225
THE LITTLE CROSSROADS TOWN
OF GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA,

195
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,394
WITHIN VIEW
OF A LUTHERAN SEMINARY,

196
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,355
WHOSE HIGH CUPOLA
OFFERED A FINE PROSPECT

197
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:32,234
OF THE SURROUNDING FARMS
AND ROLLING HILLS.

198
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,278
THERE WAS RUMORED TO BE
A SUPPLY OF SHOES AT GETTYSBURG,

199
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,198
AND THE FOOTSORE REBELS
WERE THERE TO COMMANDEER THEM.

200
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:43,412
THE SOUTH CAME IN
FROM THE NORTH THAT DAY,

201
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:47,207
AND THE NORTH
CAME IN FROM THE SOUTH.

202
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,209
ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN,

203
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,794
THE CON FEDERATES
RAN HEADLONG

204
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,214
INTO GENERAL JOHN BUFORD'S
UNION CAVALRY.

205
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,049
WHILE BOTH SIDES SENT COURIERS

206
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,135
POUNDING OFF
FOR REINFORCEMENTS,

207
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,680
BUFORD TRIED DESPERATELY
TO HOLD HIS GROUND,

208
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,433
BUT THE CONFEDERATES
FINALLY OVERWHELMED HIM

209
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,018
AND PUSHED THE UNION FORCES
BACK TOWARD TOWN.

210
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,481
"PEOPLE WERE RUNNING
HERE AND THERE,

211
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,234
"SCREAMING THAT THE TOWN
WOULD BE SHELLED.

212
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,195
"NO ONE KNEW WHERE TO GO
OR WHAT TO DO.

213
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:20,198
"MY HUSBAND WENT TO THE GARDEN
AND PICKED A MESS OF BEANS,

214
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,452
FOR HE DECLARED THE REBELS
SHOULD NOT HAVE ONE."

215
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,536
SALLIE BROADHEAD.

216
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,585
EVERY CONFEDERATE
AND UNION DIVISION IN THE AREA

217
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,045
NOW CONVERGED
ON GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA.

218
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,765
BY MID-AFTERNOON,

219
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,892
CONFEDERATE TROOPS
OCCUPIED GETTYSBURG,

220
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,479
AND UNION FORCES HAD BEEN
DRIVEN BACK SOUTH OF THE TOWN.

221
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,940
THERE, MAJOR GENERAL
WINFIELD SCOTT HANCOCK

222
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,650
MANAGED TO RALLY
THE FLEEING TROOPS

223
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,486
INTO DEFENSIVE POSITIONS

224
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,364
ON CULP'S HILL
AND CEMETERY RIDGE.

225
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,326
A SIGN NEAR
THE CEMETERY'S GATEWAY READ,

226
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,746
"ALL PERSONS FOUND
USING FIREARMS IN THESE GROUNDS

227
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:09,206
"WILL BE PROSECUTED

228
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,208
WITH THE UTMOST RIGOR
OF THE LAW."

229
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,106
DURING THE BATTLE,

230
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:38,193
THE ARTIST ALFRED WAUD
SKETCHED THE ACTION,

231
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,862
SENDING HIS DRAWINGS
BACK TO NEW YORK FOR ENGRAVING.

232
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,742
MEANWHILE, SAM WILKESON
OF <i>THE NEW YORK TIMES</i>

233
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,410
FILED DISPATCHES,

234
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,830
SITTING NEXT TO THE FRESH GRAVE
OF HIS SON.

235
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,001
LEE ARRIVED IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE AFTERNOON,

236
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,045
SET UP HEADQUARTERS,
AND URGED EWELL

237
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,840
TO RENEW THE ATTACK
BEFORE NIGHTFALL.

238
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,094
EWELL CHOSE NOT TO.
HIS MEN NEEDED REST.

239
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:05,428
BY THE END OF THE DAY,

240
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,598
THE UNION ARMY
HELD THE HIGH GROUND.

241
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,976
RATHER THAN
ATTACK IT HEADLONG,

242
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,769
CONFEDERATE GENERAL LONGSTREET

243
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,272
WANTED TO SWING AROUND
THE UNION POSITION

244
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:18,775
AND TAKE A STAND BETWEEN
MEADE'S ARMY AND WASHINGTON,

245
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,735
THEN LET
THE UNION ATTACK.

246
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,406
WITHOUT KNOWING
THE ENEMY'S STRENGTH,

247
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,075
LEE OVERRULED LONGSTREET.

248
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,078
"NO," SAID LEE,
"I'M GOING TO WHIP THEM HERE,

249
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,580
OR THEY ARE GOING TO
WHIP ME."

250
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:34,457
HE HAD ALWAYS COUNTED ON

251
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,002
STUART AND HIS CAVALRY
FOR INTELLIGENCE

252
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:39,296
AS TO ENEMY POSITIONS
AND MOVEMENTS,

253
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,589
AND HE WAS LACKING THAT.

254
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:44,134
HE WAS GROPING AROUND
THE LANDSCAPE BLIND.

255
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,094
AND PEOPLE WOULD COME UP TO HIM
IN THE FIELD

256
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:48,889
ALL THROUGH THOSE DAYS, "CAN YOU
TELL ME WHERE STUART IS?

257
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,348
HAVE YOU SEEN MY CAVALRY?"

258
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:54,603
VERY STRANGE THING
FOR A COMMANDER TO HAVE TO ASK.

259
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,146
SO WHEN STUART ARRIVED,

260
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,522
ALL HE HAD TO SHOW
FOR ALL THIS

261
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:59,733
WAS A COUPLE OF HUNDRED
WAGONS AND MULES

262
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,026
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

263
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,069
AND HE SAW LEE
STANDING THERE,

264
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,572
STERNLY LOOKING AT HIM
ARRIVING LATE,

265
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,783
AND HE BLEW THE THING BY MAKING
HIS ANNOUNCEMENT AT THE START.

266
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,786
HE SAID, "GENERAL, I BROUGHT YOU
200 BRAND-NEW WAGONS."

267
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:16,875
AND LEE SAID, "GENERAL,
THEY'RE AN IMPEDIMENT TO ME NOW.

268
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,544
I ASKED YOU TO HELP ME
WHIP THESE PEOPLE."

269
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:25,884
AND IT WAS A SEVERE
ADMONISHMENT FROM LEE,

270
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,762
AND LEE SAW
HE'D HURT HIS FEELINGS,

271
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,639
SO HE SAID,
"COME. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

272
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,474
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT."

273
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,313
"I CANNOT SLEEP.

274
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,650
"WE KNOW NOT WHAT THE MORROW
WILL BRING FORTH.

275
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:45,028
"I THINK LITTLE
HAS BEEN GAINED SO FAR.

276
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,782
HAS OUR ARMY
BEEN SUFFICIENTLY REINFORCED?"

277
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,116
SALLIE BROADHEAD.

278
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,204
COMPARED
TO WHAT WAS COMING,

279
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,830
THE DAY
HAD BEEN A SKIRMISH.

280
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,880
"MY DEAR SON ALBERT,

281
00:16:04,047 --> 00:16:06,341
"I RECEIVED YOUR AFFECTIONATE
LETTER YESTERDAY.

282
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,718
"AND I ASSURE YOU,
MY DEAR SON,

283
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,054
"IT GIVES ME
GREAT RELIEF OF MIND

284
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,890
"TO HEAR THAT YOU
AND YOUR DEAR BROTHERS

285
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:17,435
"WERE STILL IN THE LAND
OF THE LIVING.

286
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,437
"I HAD NOT HEARD
ONE WORD FROM YOU

287
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,774
"SINCE BARLOW RODGERS
RETURNED HOME.

288
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:25,443
"MAY GOD BLESS YOU,
MY DEAR ALBERT.

289
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,196
YOUR DEVOTED FATHER,
THOMAS BATCHELOR."

290
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:39,916
THROUGH THE NIGHT,

291
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,669
THE TWO ARMIES
CONTINUED TO GATHER.

292
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:45,380
AFTER A 35-MILE,
ALL-NIGHT MARCH,

293
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:49,759
UNION GENERAL JOHN SEDGWICK
ARRIVED WITH HIS 6th CORPS.

294
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,177
BY MORNING,

295
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,724
65,000 CONFEDERATES
FACED 85,000 FEDERAL TROOPS

296
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,600
COMMANDED
BY GENERAL GEORGE MEADE.

297
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:00,937
HILLS OVERLOOKED
THE FEDERAL POSITION

298
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,480
AT EITHER END--

299
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:03,982
TO THE NORTH,
ON THE UNION RIGHT,

300
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,942
CULP'S HILL
AND CEMETERY HILL;

301
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:09,904
TO THE SOUTH,

302
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,656
THE BIG AND LITTLE
ROUND TOPS.

303
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,662
LEE WANTED THEM TAKEN.

304
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:22,292
MEADE WAS NO LESS DETERMINED
TO HOLD HIS GROUND.

305
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:24,294
"ALL COMMANDERS
ARE AUTHORIZED

306
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,504
"TO ORDER THE INSTANT DEATH

307
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,591
OF ANY SOLDIER WHO FAILS
IN HIS DUTY AT THIS HOUR."

308
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,012
IT TOOK LONGSTREET
ALL MORNING

309
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,513
AND MOST OF THE AFTERNOON

310
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,390
TO SHIFT TWO DIVISIONS
INTO POSITION

311
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,059
FOR THE ASSAULT
ON THE ROUND TOPS.

312
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,854
ASSIGNED TO HOLD
THE UNION POSITION

313
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,773
WAS GENERAL DAN SICKLES,

314
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,609
A TURBULENT,
EX-TAMMANY HALL POLITICIAN

315
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:49,277
BEST KNOWN BEFORE THE WAR

316
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,613
FOR HAVING SHOT AND KILLED
HIS WIFE'S LOVER.

317
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,325
NOW SICKLES DISOBEYED ORDERS

318
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:58,495
AND MARCHED HIS MEN FURTHER OUT
FROM LITTLE ROUND TOP

319
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,413
TO THE DEVIL'S DEN,
THE WHEAT FIELD,

320
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,249
AND INTO THE PEACH ORCHARD
BEYOND.

321
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,460
HE WAS ½ MILE
IN FRONT OF THE UNION LINE

322
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:07,754
ON A FLAT, EXPOSED POSITION

323
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,800
THAT LEFT THE ROUND TOPS
COMPLETELY UNDEFENDED.

324
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:12,766
THE REST OF THE ARMY

325
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,260
WAS AMAZED.

326
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,263
SOMEONE SAID HE STUCK OUT
LIKE A SORE THUMB.

327
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,058
I THINK IT WAS HANCOCK
WHO SAW HIM GO OUT,

328
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,144
AND HE SAID, "WAIT AWHILE.
YOU'LL SEE HIM TUMBLING BACK."

329
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,938
AND, OF COURSE, HE DID.

330
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,484
THE CONFEDERATES
FINALLY ATTACKED

331
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,070
AT 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

332
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,655
AS THEY SWEPT FORWARD,

333
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:37,826
THE 15th ALABAMA REGIMENT
SCRAMBLED UP BIG ROUND TOP.

334
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:39,786
FROM THERE,
WELL ABOVE THE FIGHTING,

335
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,832
COLONEL WILLIAM C. OATES
SAW HIS CHANCE.

336
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:47,252
LITTLE ROUND TOP
WAS COMPLETELY UNDEFENDED.

337
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,087
FROM THAT POSITION,
OATES SAID,

338
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:52,674
HE COULD BLOW

ONLY CHOICE WAS TO ATTACK,

AN UNLIKELY TEXTBOOK MANEUVER.

WITH HIS MEN
ALMOST OUT OF AMMUNITION,

"LIKE A GREAT GATE UPON A POST,"
AN EYEWITNESS SAID.

439

THE CONFEDERATES WERE TAKEN
COMPLETELY BY SURPRISE.

440
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,800
THOSE IN THE FRONT RANKS
DROPPED THEIR WEAPONS.

441
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:48,928

A TEXAN REMEMBERED,
"THAT IT LOOKED LIKE A MAN

505
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,512
COULD HOLD OUT A HAT
AND CATCH IT FULL."

506
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:24,185
"I WAS WITHIN A FEW FEET
OF GENERAL SICKLES

507
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:28,356
"WHEN HE RECEIVED THE WOUND
BY WHICH HE LOST HIS LEG.

508
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:31,734
"A TERRIFIC EXPLOSION
SEEMED TO SHAKE THE VERY EARTH,

509
00:27:31,901 --> 00:27:34,236
"INSTANTLY FOLLOWED
BY ANOTHER.

"I NOTICED THAT HIS PANTS

511
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:41,744
"WERE TORN CLEAR OFF TO THE LEG,

"HE WAS CARRIED
FROM THE FIELD,

513
00:27:43,788 --> 00:27:45,748
COOLLY SMOKING A CIGAR."

514
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,045
SICKLES' MEN
COUNTERATTACKED,

515
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:54,715
FELL BACK, HELD,
PUSHED THE CONFEDERATES BACK,

516
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,301
THEN RETREATED AGAIN
THROUGH PLACES STILL REMEMBERED

517
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:01,222
FOR THE FEROCITY OF THE FIGHTING
THAT HAPPENED THERE--

518
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:02,431
THE WHEAT FIELD...

519
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,643
THE SLAUGHTER PEN...

520
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:08,729
DEVIL'S DEN...

521
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:11,982
THE VALLEY OF DEATH.

522
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,488
FINALLY, THE FIGHTING SUBSIDED.

523
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:24,245
OF THE 262
IN ONE MINNESOTA REGIMENT,

524
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:27,498
ONLY 47 SURVIVED UNHURT.

525
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:31,627
82% HAD FALLEN
IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.

526
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,212
NO UNION REGIMENT IN THE WAR

527
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:36,298
SUFFERED GREATER CASUALTIES.

528
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:41,095
COMPANY F OF THE 6th
NORTH CAROLINA LOST 100%.

529
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,726
"DEAR FATHER,

"FINALLY I CAME TO POOR ALBERT

SALLIE BROADHEAD.

563
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,836
AS THE SUN SET,

564
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,047
THE UNION LEFT AND RIGHT
STILL HELD.

565
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,842
LEE WAS SURE AN ALL-OUT
CONFEDERATE ATTACK

566
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,512
ON THE CENTER THE NEXT DAY
WOULD WORK.

567
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,722
"WHEN THE
SECOND DAY'S BATTLE WAS OVER,

568

PRONOUNCED IT A SUCCESS,

00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:56,605
BUT WE HAD ACCOMPLISHED LITTLE
TOWARD VICTORIOUS RESULTS."

570
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,357
GENERAL JAMES LONGSTREET.

571
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:03,821
THE FIRST DAY'S FIGHTING
WAS SO ENCOURAGING,

572
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,406
AND THE SECOND DAY'S FIGHTING,

573
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:07,700
HE CAME WITHIN
AN INCH OF DOING IT.

574
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,994
AND BY THAT TIME,
LONGSTREET SAID,

575
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,871
LEE'S BLOOD WAS UP.

576
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,289
AND LONGSTREET SAID

577
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:15,541
WHEN HIS BLOOD WAS UP,
THERE WAS NO STOPPING HIM.

578
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:17,334
LONGSTREET TRIED TO STOP HIM.

579
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,712
LEE SAID, "NO, HE'S THERE,"
MEANING THE ENEMY,

580
00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:22,423
"AND I'M GOING TO STRIKE HIM."

581
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,924
GENERAL LONGSTREET,
I THINK,

582
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,926
HAD GOOD REASONS TO WORRY

583
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,804
ABOUT ATTACKING THE UNION
POSITION AT GETTYSBURG.

584
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:32,391
AFTER ALL, IT WAS
HIS CORPS AT FREDERICKSBURG

585
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,102
THAT MOWED DOWN
THE UNION TROOPS

586
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,229
IN FRONT OF THE STONE WALL.

587
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,900
HE COULD REALIZE WHAT
THE RIFLE MUSKET COULD DO

588
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,652
HELD IN THE HANDS
OF DETERMINED TROOPS.

589
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,449
THE NEXT DAY
WAS PICKETT'S CHARGE.

590
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:57,499
LEE, BY THE SUMMER OF 1863,

591
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,002
HAD COME TO BELIEVE
THAT HE WAS INVINCIBLE

592
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:02,254
AND SO WAS THE ARMY
OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA.

593
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:03,781
THE RECORD
WOULD ALMOST INVITE THAT

594
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:05,424
WHEN YOU SEE HOW
THEY HAD PUMMELED

595
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,468
ONE UNION GENERAL
AFTER ANOTHER

596
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:08,969
AND HAD DEFEATED--

597
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,013
OR AT LEAST FOUGHT TO A DRAW
THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC

598
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,223
ALMOST IN EVERY BATTLE
UP TO THAT POINT.

599
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,393
LEE REALLY DID THINK THAT IF HE
ASKED HIS BOYS TO DO SOMETHING,

600
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,729
THEY WOULD DO IT,
THAT THEY WOULD DO ANYTHING.

601
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,522
HE HAD COME,
BY GETTYSBURG, THEN,

602
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:22,274
TO BELIEVE
IN HIS INVINCIBILITY

603
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,486
AND THAT OF HIS MEN,
AND IT WAS HIS DOOM.

604
00:32:45,965 --> 00:32:49,009
THE THIRD DAY
BEGAN BADLY FOR LEE.

605
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:51,303
EWELL'S MEN WERE DRIVEN BACK
FROM CULP'S HILL.

606
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:56,350
JEB STUART WAS SUPPOSED
TO GET BEHIND THE FEDERALS

607
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,478
AND ATTACK THEM FROM THE REAR,

608
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,314
BUT UNION CAVALRY
STOPPED AND HELD HIM,

609
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,192
THANKS IN PART
TO A SERIES OF RECKLESS CHARGES

610
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,862
LED BY 23-YEAR-OLD
GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER.

611
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,330
EVERYTHING NOW DEPENDED
ON LONGSTREET'S ATTACK

612
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,666
ON THE UNION CENTER
ON CEMETERY RIDGE.

613
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,130
MEADE SAW IT COMING
AND WAS READY FOR HIM.

614
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:30,342
THE MAN LEE CHOSE
TO LEAD THE ASSAULT

615
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,638
WAS DASHING, PERFUMED
GENERAL GEORGE E. PICKETT,

616
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,474
WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE TAKEN
HIS DIVISION INTO COMBAT.

617
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:41,854
IT WAS
AN INCREDIBLE MISTAKE.

618
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,564
THERE'S SCARCELY
A TRAIN ED SOLDIER

619
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,025
WHO DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS A MISTAKE
AT THE TIME IT WAS DONE

620
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,651
EXCEPT POSSIBLY
PICKETT HIMSELF,

621
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,446
WHO WAS VERY HAPPY
HE HAD A CHANCE FOR GLORY.

622
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,948
BUT EVERY MAN WHO LOOKED OUT
OVER THAT FIELD,

623
00:33:53,115 --> 00:33:56,910
WHETHER IT'S A SERGEANT
OR A LIEUTENANT GENERAL,

624
00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:59,371
SAW THAT IT WAS
A DESPERATE ENDEAVOR

625
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,957
AND, I'M SURE, KNEW THAT
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MADE.

626
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,919
PICKETT'S MEN
FILED INTO THE WOODS

627
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,546
WEST OF THE EMMITSBURG ROAD

628
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,631
AND WAITED
IN THE STIFLING HEAT.

629
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,175
TO RELIEVE THE TENSION,

630
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:13,677
SOME OF THE MEN PELTED
EACH OTHER WITH GREEN APPLES.

631
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:16,680
THEY KNEW WHAT
THEY WERE GOING TO DO,

632
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,307
BUT THEY HAD TO WAIT.

633
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:22,644
AND WHILE THEY WERE WAITING,
FORMED AND READY TO MOVE OUT--

634
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,814
THEY WERE IN DEFILADE
AMONG BRUSH AND THINGS--

635
00:34:25,981 --> 00:34:28,233
AND A RABBIT JUMPED OUT
OF THE BUSHES AND TOOK OFF,

636
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,777
A REAL ONE,

637
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,154
AND ONE OF THE SOLDIERS
LOOKED AFTER HIM AND HOLLERED,

638
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,655
"RUN, OLD HARE.

639
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:38,452
IF I WAS AN OLD HARE,
I'D RUN, TOO."

640
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,620
IT WASN'T ALL VALOR.

641
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,710
EXACTLY AT 1:00,
A GIANT ARTILLERY BARRAGE

642
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,921
INTENDED TO SOFTEN UP
THE UNION DEFENSES

643
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:50,339
BEFORE THE ATTACK

644
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,424
BEGAN WITH
A DEAFENING EXPLOSION.

645
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,391
FIRE!

646
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:57,513
MEADE HAD
JUST LEFT HIS COMMANDERS

647
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,098
FINISHING THEIR LUNCH.

648
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,433
AS AN ORDERLY
SERVED THEM BUTTER,

649
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,268
A SHELL TORE THE MAN IN TWO.

650
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,526
"THE STORM BROKE

GENERAL WINFIELD SCOTT HANCOCK
RODE UP AND DOWN THE LINE

662
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:46,311
WITHOUT FLINCHING
AT THE SCREAMING SHELLS.

663
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:48,689
A BRIGADIER URGED HIM
TO TAKE COVER.

664
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:50,149
HANCOCK REFUSED.

IT WORKED.

682
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:45,412
AT ABOUT 2:00, PICKETT ASKED
IF HIS MEN SHOULD GO FORWARD.

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HARDER
NOT TO GO THAN TO GO.

688
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,219
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN
A GREAT DEAL OF COURAGE

TO SAY, "MASTER ROBERT,
I AIN'T GOING."

MET THE MEN RETREATING,

GENERAL SHERMAN SAID SIMPLY,

1001
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,159
"SHE RANKS ME."

1002
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,853
EVERY DAY SINCE LATE MAY,

1003
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:42,691
U.S. GRANT'S 200 UNION GUNS
HAD POUNDED VICKSBURG FROM LAND,

1004
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:45,277
WHILE ADMIRAL DAVID PORTER'S
GUNBOATS

1005
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:46,654
BATTERED IT FROM THE RIVER.

1006
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:53,577
"THEY FIRE AT THE CITY,
THINKING THAT THEY WILL

1007
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,414
"WEAR OUT THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN AND SICK,

1008
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,291
"AND GENERAL PEMBERTON WILL BE
OBLIGED TO SURRENDER THE PLACE

1009
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,501
"ON THAT ACCOUNT,

1010
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:01,919
"BUT THEY LITTLE KNOW

1011
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:04,213
THE SPIRIT OF THE VICKSBURG
WOMEN AND CHILDREN."

1012
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:10,302
CIVILIANS DUG CAVES
IN THE YELLOW CLAY HILLSIDES,

1013
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:11,720
SOME WITH SEVERAL ROOMS

1014
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:14,473
FITTED OUT WITH RUGS
AND BEDS AND CHAIRS

1015
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,016
AND STAFFED WITH SLAVES.

1016
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,062
BUT FOOD RAN LOW.

1017
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:22,606
THE CITY'S DEFENDERS
WERE REDUCED TO EATING MULES,

1018
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:25,317
HORSES, AND DOGS.

1019
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:27,445
THE VICKSBURG GAZETTE
HAD TO BE PRINTED

1020
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,822
ON THE BACK
OF FLOWERED WALLPAPER.

1021
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:33,617
THERE WAS NO MORE NEWSPRINT.

1022
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,870
"WE ARE UTTERLY
CUT OFF FROM THE WORLD,

1023
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,039
"SURROUNDED
BY A CIRCLE OF FIRE.

1024
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:42,751
"THE SHOWER OF SHELLS GOES ON
DAY AND NIGHT.

1025
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,671
"PEOPLE DO NOTHING
BUT EAT WHAT THEY CAN GET,

1026
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,841
SLEEP WHEN THEY CAN,
AND DODGE THE SHELLS."

1027
00:57:49,008 --> 00:57:49,967
DORA MILLER.

1028
00:57:52,344 --> 00:57:55,222
IT WAS "LIVING LIKE
PLANT ROOTS," ONE WOMAN SAID.

1029
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:58,934
UNION TROOPS BEGAN CALLING
VICKSBURG "PRAIRIE DOG TOWN."

1030
00:58:01,896 --> 00:58:04,023
FINALLY, AFTER 48 DAYS
OF SIEGE,

1031
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:05,608
ON JULY 4,

1032
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:09,153
THE SAME DAY THAT LEE BEGAN
HIS RETREAT FROM GETTYSBURG,

1033
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,697
31,000 CONFEDERATES
SURRENDERED.

1034
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:16,952
CONFEDERATE GENERAL
JOHN C. PEMBERTON SAID

1035
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,497
IT WOULD BE
AN ACT OF "CRUEL INHUMANITY"

1036
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:24,376
TO SUBJECT HIS MEN TO
THE TERRIBLE ORDEAL ANY LONGER.

1037
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:26,003
BESIDES, HE ADDED,

1038
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:29,465
"I AM A NORTHERN MAN.
I KNOW MY PEOPLE.

1039
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:32,801
"I KNOW WE CAN GET BETTER TERMS
FROM THEM ON THE FOURTH OF JULY

1040
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:36,388
THAN ON ANY OTHER DAY
OF THE YEAR."

1041
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,307
THE STARS AND STRIPES
WAS RAISED

1042
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:41,227
ABOVE THE VICKSBURG COURTHOUSE.

1043
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,687
AT THE CELEBRATION
ABOARD ADMIRAL PORTER'S FLAGSHIP

1044
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:45,397
ON THE MISSISSIPPI,

1045
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:49,235
GRANT WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID
NOT TOUCH THE WINE OFFERED HIM,

1046
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:52,988
BUT CONTENTED HIMSELF
WITH A CIGAR.

1047
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,658
"GRANT IS NOW
DESERVEDLY THE HERO,

1048
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:59,036
"BELABORED WITH PRAISE BY THOSE
WHO ACCUSED HIM A MONTH AGO

1049
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,247
"OF ALL THE SINS
IN THE CALENDAR

1050
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:03,165
"AND WHO NEXT WEEK
WILL TURN AGAINST HIM

1051
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:05,834
"IF SO BLOWS
THE POPULAR BREEZE.

1052
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:09,129
VOX POPULI,
VOX HUMBUG."

1053
00:59:09,296 --> 00:59:12,007
WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN.

1054
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:15,636
"IT IS NOW CONCEDED THAT
ALL IDEA OF BRITISH INTERVENTION

1055
00:59:15,803 --> 00:59:17,263
"IS AT AN END.

1056
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,932
"I WANT TO HUG THE ARMY
OF THE POTOMAC FOR GETTYSBURG,

1057
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,643
"I WANT TO GET THE WHOLE ARMY
OF VICKSBURG DRUNK

1058
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:24,144
"AT MY OWN EXPENSE,

1059
00:59:24,311 --> 00:59:28,190
I WANT TO FIGHT SOME SMALL MAN
AND LICK HIM."

1060
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:29,483
HEN RY ADAMS.

1061
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:35,614
THE CONFEDERACY
WAS CUT IN TWO.

1062
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:39,076
THE MISSISSIPPI HAD BECOME
A UNION HIGHWAY.

1063
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:41,161
"THE FATHER OF WATERS,"
LINCOLN SAID,

1064
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,414
"AGAIN GOES UNVEXED
TO THE SEA."

1065
00:59:46,417 --> 00:59:49,211
"WE HAVE LOST
THE MISSISSIPPI,

1066
00:59:49,378 --> 00:59:52,089
"AND OUR NATION IS DIVIDED,

1067
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,216
AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH LEFT
TO FIGHT FOR."

1068
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,848
THE FOURTH OF JULY
WOULD NOT BE

1069
01:00:01,015 --> 01:00:02,683
CELEBRATED IN VICKSBURG AGAIN

1070
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:04,143
FOR 81 YEARS.

1071
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,324
"I FOUND FOR MY SUBSTITUTE

1072
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:22,161
"A BIG DUTCH BOY OF
20 OR THEREABOUTS,

1073
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:26,123
"FOR THE MODERATE CONSIDERATION
OF $1,100.

1074
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:29,793
"MY ALTER EGO COULD MAKE
A GOOD SOLDIER IF HE TRIED.

1075
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,962
"GAVE HIM MY ADDRESS
AND TOLD HIM TO WRITE TO ME

1076
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:35,424
"IF HE FOUND HIMSELF
IN THE HOSPITAL OR IN TROUBLE,

1077
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:38,031
AND THAT I WOULD TRY TO DO WHAT
I PROPERLY COULD TO HELP HIM."

1078
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:40,804
GEORGE TEMPLETON STRONG.

1079
01:00:44,767 --> 01:00:46,018
IN JULY,
LINCOLN ISSUED

1080
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:48,312
THE FIRST FEDERAL DRAFT CALL.

1081
01:00:48,479 --> 01:00:53,400
ALL ABLE-BODIED MEN
BETWEEN 20 AND 45 WERE ENROLLED,

1082
01:00:53,567 --> 01:00:56,111
BUT THE LAW
FAVORED THE WELL-TO-DO.

1083
01:00:56,278 --> 01:01:00,157
ANY MAN WILLING TO PAY $300
AS A "COMMUTATION FEE"

1084
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,743
OR HIRE A SUBSTITUTE TO SERVE
IN HIS PLACE

1085
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:05,120
WAS EXEMPT.

1086
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,040
"THE LAW IS
A RICH MAN'S BILL,

1087
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:11,960
MADE FOR HIM
WHO CANNOT RAISE THAT SUM."

1088
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:13,629
SENATOR THADDEUS STEVENS.

1089
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,759
THE FATHERS OF
THEODORE AND FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT

1090
01:01:18,926 --> 01:01:20,761
HIRED SUBSTITUTES.

1091
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:23,639
SO DID ANDREW CARNEGIE
AND JP. MORGAN

1092
01:01:23,806 --> 01:01:25,516
AND TWO FUTURE PRESIDENTS--

1093
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:27,601
CHESTER A. ARTHUR
AND GROVER CLEVELAND.

1094
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:35,651
BOUNTY JUMPING
BECAME A PROFESSION.

1095
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:37,695
MEN SIGNED UP FROM ONE DISTRICT
LONG ENOUGH

1096
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,239
TO RECEIVE A REWARD
FOR ENLISTING,

1097
01:01:40,406 --> 01:01:43,534
THEN DESERTED
TO DO THE SAME ELSEWHERE.

1098
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:47,121
ONE MAN REPEATED THE PROCESS
32 TIMES BEFORE HE WAS CAUGHT.

1099
01:01:49,665 --> 01:01:52,626
SHAKER ELDER FREDERICK EVANS
CAME TO SEE LINCOLN,

1100
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:54,712
HOPING TO HAVE HIS
PACIFIST COMMUNITY

1101
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,589
EXCUSED FROM MILITARY SERVICE.

1102
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,926
"WE NEED REGIMENTS OF SUCH MEN
AS YOU," LINCOLN SAID,

1103
01:02:01,093 --> 01:02:04,179
BUT GRANTED
ELDER EVANS' REQUEST.

1104
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:07,433
THE SHAKERS WERE AMONG THE FIRST
CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTORS.

1105
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,771
ON DEER ISLE, TWO PROMINENT
LOCAL CITIZENS

1106
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:17,317
BEGAN GOING HOUSE TO HOUSE
DELIVERING INDUCTION NOTICES.

1107
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:21,321
149 MEN WERE CALLED
FOR THE NEW DRAFT.

1108
01:02:21,488 --> 01:02:23,532
42 NEVER SHOWED UP.

1109
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:26,452
33 WERE EXEMPTED
FOR MEDICAL REASONS.

1110
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,787
TWO PAID SUBSTITUTES.

1111
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,664
AND ONE MAN SOLD HIS HOUSE

1112
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:33,375
AND LEFT HIS WIFE AND SEVERAL
CHILDREN HOMELESS

1113
01:02:33,542 --> 01:02:35,419
RATHER THAN DESERT THEM
FOR THE FRONT.

1114
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,467
NEW YORK CITY CONTEMPLATED

1115
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,135
SECESSION FROM THE UNION, TOO,

1116
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:45,888
AND THEY WANTED
TO BE DECLARED AN OPEN CITY.

1117
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:48,599
THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL
OF RESENTMENT

1118
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,435
OF THE INFLUX OF BLACKS

1119
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:54,813
AND A LOT OF RESISTANCE
TO THE DRAFT,

1120
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,540
BECAUSE MEN COULD GET
BETTER-PAYING JOBS

1121
01:02:56,565 --> 01:02:57,900
THAN THEY'D EVER HAD,

1122
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,694
AND THE LAST THING THEY WANTED
WAS TO GO TO THE WAR.

1123
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:01,904
THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF
RESENTMENT, TOO,

1124
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,947
THAT IF YOU COULD
SCRAPE UP $300,

1125
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,365
YOU COULD BE EXEMPT,

1126
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,242
AND ALL THOSE RESENTMENTS
FLARED UP

1127
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,536
INTO WHAT'S CALLED
THE NEW YORK DRAFT RIOTS.

1128
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:13,665
NO GROUP
WAS MORE OUTRAGED

1129
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,001
THAN THE IMMIGRANT IRISH
OF NEW YORK,

1130
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:17,252
WHO FEARED THE BLACKS

1131
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:19,630
WHO COMPETED
FOR THE LOWEST-PAYING JOBS

1132
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:23,050
AND FOR WHOSE FREEDOM
THEY DID NOT WISH TO FIGHT.

1133
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:26,804
DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS
FANNED THEIR ANGER.

1134
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:28,263
"REMEMBER THIS,

1135
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:30,140
"THAT THE BLOODY

"CAN BE PROCLAIMED BY A MOB

AS WELL AS BY A GOVERNMENT."

1139
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:39,608
GOVERNOR HORATIO SEYMOUR,
NEW YORK.

1140
01:03:42,528 --> 01:03:44,029
ON SUNDAY, JULY 12,

1141
01:03:44,196 --> 01:03:46,198
WHEN THE NAMES
OF THE FIRST DRAFTEES APPEARED

1142
01:03:46,365 --> 01:03:47,866
IN THE NEWSPAPERS

1143
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:51,870
ALONGSIDE LONG LISTS OF THOSE
WHO HAD FALLEN AT GETTYSBURG,

1144
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:55,874
A MOSTLY IRISH MOB ATTACKED
AND DESTROYED THE DRAFT OFFICE,

1145
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,918
THEN FANNED OUT
ACROSS THE CITY.

1146
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:00,796
FOR 3 DAYS,

1147
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:04,216
THE EAST SIDE OF MANHATTAN
BELONGED TO THE MOB.

1148
01:04:04,383 --> 01:04:06,552
BLACKS WERE
THEIR MAIN TARGETS.

1149
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:08,428
THEY BURNED
BLACK BOARDING HOUSES,

1150
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:11,306
A BLACK CHURCH,
A BLACK ORPHANAGE,

1151
01:04:11,473 --> 01:04:13,517
THEN LYNCHED A CRIPPLED
BLACK COACHMAN

1152
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:15,644
AND SET HIS CORPSE ON FIRE

1153
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,980
WHILE CHANTING
"HURRAH FOR JEFF DAVIS!"

1154
01:04:20,816 --> 01:04:24,069
"JULY 14,
FIRE BELLS CLANKING

1165
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:52,973
MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE
HAD BEEN KILLED.

1166
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:55,225
BLOODY RIOTS BROKE OUT
THROUGHOUT THE NORTH

1167
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:59,521
AS OPPOSITION
TO THE WAR INCREASED.

SINCE THE FIRST SHOTS
WERE FIRED,

1193
01:06:27,651 --> 01:06:29,569
ABOLITIONISTS HAD BEEN PRESSING
THE GOVERNMENT

1194
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,113
TO PUT BLACKS INTO BATTLE.

1195
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:37,035
CONGRESS AUTHORIZED
COLORED TROOPS IN 1862,

1196
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,370
BUT A YEAR WENT BY

1197
01:06:38,537 --> 01:06:41,039
BEFORE THE FIRST BLACK MEN
PUT ON BLUE COATS

1198
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:42,833

UNDER WHITE OFFICERS.

"THIS, WITH
THE EMANCIPATION OF THE NEGRO,

1205
01:07:14,156 --> 01:07:16,742
BLACK PRIVATES
WERE PAID $10 A MONTH,

1206
01:07:16,908 --> 01:07:19,536
$3.00 LESS THAN WHITES.

1207
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,997
SEVERAL REGIMENTS
SERVED WITHOUT PAY

1208
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,958
RATHER THAN SUBMIT
TO THAT INEQUALITY.

1209
01:07:25,125 --> 01:07:26,752
BLACKS WERE RARELY PROMOTED.

1210

MANY OF
THE UNION SOLDIERS

WHO BEGAN WITH STEREOTYPICAL
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT BLACK MEN,

1212
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:49,357
WHO ASSUMED
THAT THEY COULDN'T FIGHT,

1213
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:52,110
THAT THEY WOULD HAND
THEIR WEAPONS OVER TO THE ENEMY,

01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,196
THAT THEY WOULD RUN
AND SO ON,

1215
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:58,325
HAD THEIR MINDS CHANGED
IN THE GRIMMEST CIRCUMSTANCES.

1216

OF HOW PEOPLE'S IDEAS
WERE TRANSFORMED

1218
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:09,044
ARE NOT THE SORT OF DOCUMENTS
THAT YOU ENJOY READING

1219
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:13,715
BECAUSE THEY SPEAK OF HOW PEOPLE
BECAME COMPANIONS IN DEATH,

1220
01:08:13,882 --> 01:08:17,803
OF HOW WHITE SOLDIERS LEARNED
TO RESPECT THEIR BLACK COMRADES

1221
01:08:17,969 --> 01:08:20,180
WHEN THEY WATCHED
HOW THEY REACTED

1222
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:24,309
AS PEOPLE ALL AROUND
WERE BEING KILLED,

1223
01:08:24,476 --> 01:08:25,393
BEING BUTCHERED.

1224
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:33,401
ON JULY 18,
JUST 3 DAYS

1225
01:08:33,568 --> 01:08:35,654
AFTER THE DRAFT RIOTS ENDED,

1226
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:40,200
650 MEN OF THE ALL-BLACK
54th MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT

1227
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:41,743
ASSAULTED
A CON FEDERATE POSITION

1228
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:45,705
AT BATTERY WAGNER,
SOUTH CAROLINA.

1229
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,875
THEIR COMMANDER WAS
A BOSTON ABOLITIONIST'S SON,

1230
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:51,002
COLONEL ROBERT GOULD SHAW.

1231
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:03,890

INTO THE FIELD,

01:09:15,694 --> 01:09:18,822
"BUT IT DID NOT FALTER.

1237
01:09:18,989 --> 01:09:22,659
"IT MADE FORT WAGNER
SUCH A NAME FOR THE COLORED RACE

"AS BUNKER HILL HAS BEEN
FOR 90 YEARS

1239

1240
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,296
40% OF THE REGIMENT
DID NOT RETURN,

1241
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:35,630
INCLUDING COLONEL SHAW.

1242
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,012
SHAW LED THEIR ATTACK
ON BATTERY WAGNER.

1243
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:43,430
THEY WERE CUT TO PIECES.

1244
01:09:43,597 --> 01:09:46,141
THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE MADE
THAT CHARGE EITHER.

1245
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,642
AND WHEN IT WAS OVER,

1246
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:50,103
THE CONFEDERATES
WERE IN CONTROL.

1247
01:09:50,270 --> 01:09:52,480
AND THERE WAS
VERY HARD FEELING

1248
01:09:52,647 --> 01:09:55,859
AGAINST THE WHITE OFFICERS
OF BLACK REGIMENTS.

1249
01:09:56,026 --> 01:09:57,986
SHAW WAS SIMPLY THROWN
IN A BURIAL PIT

1250
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:00,030
WITH HIS SOLDIERS.

1251
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:03,366
SHAW'S FATHER LATER SAID
HE WAS PROUD

1252
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,701
TO HAVE HIM BURIED
THAT WAY.

1253
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:08,246
WHEN
THE FLAG BEARER FELL

1254
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,040
AND THE ORDER TO WITHDRAW
WAS GIVEN,

1255

SERGEANT WILLIAM CARNEY
SEIZED THE COLORS

1256
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:14,377

TO HIS LINES,

1257
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:17,631
DESPITE BULLETS IN THE HEAD,
CHEST, RIGHT ARM, AND LEG.

1258
01:10:21,009 --> 01:10:25,263
HE WAS THE FIRST OF 23 BLACKS
AWARDED THE MEDAL OF HONOR,

1259
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,849

01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:47,984
UNTIL JUST OVER

1330
01:14:48,151 --> 01:14:50,195
THE TENNESSEE LINE IN GEORGIA,

1331
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:51,863
WHERE HE GATHERED HIS FORCES--

1332
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:54,824
NOW BOLSTERED BY LONGSTREET'S
VIRGINIA VETERANS--

1333
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,744
ALONG A MEAN DERING CREEK
CALLED CHICKAMAUGA.

1334
01:15:03,625 --> 01:15:06,336
CHICKAMAUGA,
LIKE ALL INDIAN WORDS,

1335
01:15:06,503 --> 01:15:09,214
IS INTERPRETED TO MEAN
THE RIVER OF DEATH.

1336
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:12,217
GOD KNOWS WHAT
IT REALLY MEANS.

1337
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:14,219
CHICKAMAUGA WAS
A HORRENDOUS BATTLE,

1338
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:19,182
A LOT OF BREAKTHROUGHS,
A LOT OF HAN D-TO-HAND COMBAT,

1339
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:21,935
ALONG, RAGGED RETREAT,

1340
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:26,564
A GLORIOUS SOUTHERN VICTORY
WHICH WAS UNEXPLOITED.

1341
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:28,650
ALL THE WESTERN HEROES
WERE THERE,

1342
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:32,237
FROM FORREST ON DOWN.

1343
01:15:32,403 --> 01:15:34,322
IT'S A GREAT BATTLE.

1344
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:39,536
AT 8 A.M. ON THE
MORNING ON SEPTEMBER 18,

1345
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,329
NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST'S CAVALRY

1346
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:43,373
RAN INTO A BRIGADE OF FEDERALS

1347
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,501
HEADING FOR LITTLE BRIDGE
OVER THE CREEK.

1348
01:15:46,668 --> 01:15:49,629
BY NOON, ONE OF FORREST'S
OFFICERS REPORTED,

1349
01:15:49,796 --> 01:15:52,674
THE DEAD WERE PILED UPON
EACH OTHER LIKE CORDWOOD

1350
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,802
TO MAKE PASSAGE
FOR ADVANCING COLUMNS.

1351
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:58,346
BY NIGHTFALL, BOTH LINES HELD.

1352
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,225
ON THE SECOND DAY
OF FIERCE FIGHTING,

1353
01:16:02,392 --> 01:16:04,727
ROSECRANS COMMITTED
A FATAL MISTAKE--

1354
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,479
ORDERING HIS TROOPS
TO CLOSE A GAP

1355
01:16:06,646 --> 01:16:08,147
IN THE UNION LINE

1356
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,148
THAT WASN'T THERE.

1357
01:16:10,567 --> 01:16:13,278
IN THE PROCESS,
HE OPENED UP A REAL ONE,

1358
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:16,823
AND LONGSTREET'S CONFEDERATES
STORMED THROUGH.

1359
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:20,159
THE UNION FORCES BROKE
AND RAN.

1360
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:22,745
"THEY HAVE FOUGHT THEIR
LAST MAN," LONGSTREET SAID,

1361
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,122
"AND EVEN <i>HE</i> IS RUNNING."

1362
01:16:27,709 --> 01:16:31,212
BUT GEORGE HENRY THOMAS,
A UNION MAN FROM VIRGINIA,

1363
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:32,964
REFUSED TO RETREAT

1364
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:35,550
AND ORGANIZED
A STUBBORN LAST-MINUTE DEFENSE

1365
01:16:35,717 --> 01:16:38,177
THAT KEPT THE BATTLE
FROM BECOMING A ROUT

1366
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:41,472
AND EARNED HIM THE NICKNAME
THE "ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA."

1367
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:47,061
THE NORTHERN ARMY LIMPED BACK
INTO CHATTANOOGA.

1368
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:50,231
ROSECRANS WAS "CONFUSED
AND STUNNED," LINCOLN SAID,

1369
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:51,733
"LIKE A DUCK
HIT ON THE HEAD."

1370
01:16:57,697 --> 01:17:01,409
BOTTLED UP IN CHATTANOOGA, THE
UNION FORCES WERE MISERABLE--

1371
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:03,244
COLD, VERMIN-INFESTED,

1372
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:07,123
CUT OFF FROM ALL BUT A THIN
TRICKLE OF SUPPLIES.

1373
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:09,042
THEY DEMOLISHED HOUSES
AND HACKED DOWN

1374
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,544
EVERY TREE AND FENCE
IN TOWN FOR FUEL.

1375
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:16,007
THE CONFEDERATES
BESIEGING THE CITY

1376
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:17,592
WERE IN NO BETTER SHAPE.

1377
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,972
"IN THE VERY ACME OF OUR
PRIVATIONS AND HUNGER,

1378
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,808
"WHEN THE ARMY WAS MOST
DISSATISFIED AND UNHAPPY,

1379
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,602
"WE WERE ORDERED INTO LINE
TO BE REVIEWED

1380

IMMEDIATELY REPLACED ROSECRANS

1390
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,303
WITH THOMAS.

1391
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:05,014
BRAXTON BRAGG'S CONFEDERATE ARMY
NOW OCCUPIED

1392
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,308
THE 6-MILE CREST
OF MISSIONARY RIDGE

1393
01:18:07,475 --> 01:18:09,143
EAST OF THE CITY.

1394
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:12,105
CONFEDERATE GUNS WERE MASSED
ON THE 2,000-FOOT SUMMIT

1395
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,816
OF NEARBY LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN
SOUTH OF TOWN.

1396
01:18:17,944 --> 01:18:21,614
GRANT, DOWN IN CHATTANOOGA,
RESOLVED TO DRIVE THEM OFF.

1397
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:27,078
THE BATTLE OF CHATTANOOGA
BEGAN ON NOVEMBER 24.

1398
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:32,959
UNION TROOPS STORMED
LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN,

1399
01:18:33,126 --> 01:18:34,961
FIGHTING THROUGH
SUCH DENSE FOG

1400
01:18:35,128 --> 01:18:37,422
THAT IT WAS REMEMBERED AS
THE "BATTLE ABOVE THE CLOUDS."

1401
01:18:55,940 --> 01:18:57,608
DURING THE NIGHT,
A BESIEGED BRAGG

1402
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,652
WITHDREW FROM THE SUMMIT
OF LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN

1403
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,279
TO NEARBY MISSIONARY RIDGE.

1404
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:13,666
JUST BEFORE DAWN
THE NEXT MORNING,

1405
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:16,919
FEDERALS STEPPED OUT
ONTO AN OVERHANGING ROCK,

1406
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:20,506
AND AS THE SUN ROSE,
UNFURLED THEIR FLAG.

1407
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,925
THOUSANDS OF UNION MEN
IN THE VALLEY BELOW

1408
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:25,887
BROKE INTO
A THUNDEROUS CHEER.

1409
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,263
THE UNION HAD WON.

1410
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:37,064
THE NEXT UNION TASK
WAS TO TAKE MISSIONARY RIDGE.

1411
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,631
IN COMMAND
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HILL

1412
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:42,111
WAS 115-POUND
GENERAL PHIL SHERIDAN,

1413
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:44,238
WHO PULLED A FLASK
FROM HIS POCKET

1414
01:19:44,405 --> 01:19:47,241
AND TOASTED THE CONFEDERATE
GUNNERS ABOVE HIM.

1415
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:49,827
"HERE'S AT YOU," HE SAID.

1416
01:19:49,994 --> 01:19:51,120
THE REBELS OPENED FIRE,

1417
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:54,207
SPATTERING HIM AND HIS OFFICERS
WITH DIRT.

1418
01:19:54,373 --> 01:19:56,959
"THAT WAS UNGENEROUS,"
SHERIDAN SAID,

1419
01:19:57,126 --> 01:19:58,336
"I'LL TAKE YOUR GUNS
FOR THAT."

1420
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:06,677
"WHO ORDERED THOSE MEN
UP THE HILL?" GRANT ASKED.

1421
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:08,805
"NO ONE," AN AIDE REPLIED.

1422
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:10,848
"THEY STARTED UP
WITHOUT ORDERS.

1423
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,642
"WHEN THOSE FELLOWS
GET STARTED,

1424
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:14,060
ALL HELL CAN'T STOP THEM."

"THOSE DEFENDING

01:20:33,663 --> 01:20:36,541

THE FORCE OF THE CHARGE."

"JOHN WILLIAMS,
SOUTH CAROLINA,

1435

1436
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,361
UNDER
GRANT'S LEADERSHIP,

1437
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,654
THE UNION ARMY HAD BROKEN

1438
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:09,949
THE CONFEDERATE SIEGE
AT CHATTANOOGA.

1439
01:21:10,116 --> 01:21:11,617
IT WAS ANOTHER TRIUMPH
FOR GRANT.

1440
01:21:14,495 --> 01:21:16,163
"IT WAS A GREAT VICTORY,"
SHERMAN SAID,

1441
01:21:16,330 --> 01:21:19,125
"THE NEATEST AND CLEANEST BATTLE
I WAS EVER IN,

1442
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,502

EVERYBODY POSED

GENERAL THOMAS ORDERED
A UNION CEMETERY LAID OUT

1446

CALLED ORCHARD KNOB

1447
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,601
THAT HAD SEEN
SAVAGE FIGHTING.

1448
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:24,065
A CHAPLAIN ASKED IF
THE BURIALS SHOULD BE BY STATE.

1449
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:26,359
"NO, NO. MIX THEM UP,"
THOMAS SAID,

1450
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:28,027
"I'M TIRED OF STATES RIGHTS."

1451
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:41,248
AT THE CAPITOL IN WASHINGTON
AT NOON ON DECEMBER 2, 1863,

1452
01:22:41,415 --> 01:22:44,627
A 19-FOOT BRONZE GODDESS
OF "FREEDOM TRIUMPHANT"

PUNISHING THE COUNTRY

1493
01:24:48,501 --> 01:24:49,919
FOR THE CRIME OF SLAVERY.

1494
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:51,806
ROBERT E. LEE SAID THAT
HE WAS AN INSTRUMENT

1495
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,339
IN THE HANDS OF GOD

1496
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:55,841
AND SAID AT GETTYSBURG
THAT IT'S ALL IN GOD'S HANDS

1497
01:24:56,008 --> 01:24:58,844
AND THEN SENT THE CREAM
OF HIS ARMY TO ITS DOOM.

1498
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:03,474
THEY REALLY FELT THAT PROVIDENCE
WAS AT WORK IN THIS WAR.

1499
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:05,267
AS LINCOLN SAID,
"WE BOTH PRAY TO THE SAME GOD.

1500
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:06,393
"WE BOTH INVOKED HIM.

1501
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,229
WE BOTH SAID
WE WERE ON HIS SIDE."

1502
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:11,315
BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL 1863,
INDEED AT THE END OF THE WAR,

1503
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:12,608
THAT IT BECAME CLEAR

1504
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:13,901
WHERE GOD'S JUDGMENT
WAS COMING DOWN--

1505
01:25:14,068 --> 01:25:15,569
THAT WAS
ON THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

1506
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:19,990
IT MUST NOW ATONE IN BLOOD FOR
ITS COMPLICITY IN WICKEDNESS,

1507
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:21,242
THE WICKEDNESS OF SLAVERY.

1508
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:42,930
THE CIVIL WAR
WAS FOUGHT IN 10,000 PLACES--

1509
01:25:43,097 --> 01:25:47,893
AT BIG BEND, BIG SANDY,
AND THE BIG SUNFLOWER RIVER,

1510
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,603
FROM BUNKER HILL,
WEST VIRGINIA,

1511
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:52,857
AND BLUE SPRINGS, TENNESSEE,
AND CAIRO, ILLINOIS,

1512
01:25:53,023 --> 01:25:58,070
TO GOLGOTHA CHURCH, GEORGIA,
AND CHRISTIANBURG, KENTUCKY,

1513
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:00,739
AT CITRUS POINT
ON THE CIMARRON RIVER,

1514
01:26:00,906 --> 01:26:03,826
AND ALONG COWSKIN BOTTOM,

1515
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:07,079
AT PEBBLY RUN
AND LA GLORIETA PASS

1516
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:08,330
AND GETTYSBURG.

1517
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:13,711
I THINK IF I HAD MY CHOICE
OF ALL THE MOMENTS

1518
01:26:13,878 --> 01:26:16,839
TO BE PRESENT AT
IN THAT WAR PERIOD,

1519
01:26:17,006 --> 01:26:18,465
IT WOULD BE AT GETTYSBURG

1520
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:22,887
DURING LINCOLN'S DELIVERY
OF HIS SPEECH,

1521
01:26:23,053 --> 01:26:25,347
MAYBE TO HAVE SEEN HIM
CRAFT THOSE BEAUTIFUL WORDS,

1522
01:26:25,514 --> 01:26:31,270
THOSE MARVELOUS HEALING WORDS,
AND THEN DELIVER THEM.

1523
01:26:31,437 --> 01:26:33,898
THEY WERE FOR EVERYONE
FOR ALL TIME.

1524
01:26:34,064 --> 01:26:36,984
THEY SUBSUMED THE ENTIRE WAR
AND ALL IN IT.

1525
01:26:37,151 --> 01:26:39,153
IT SHOWED HIS COMPASSION
FOR EVERYONE,

1526
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,572
HIS LOVE FOR HIS PEOPLE.

1527
01:26:41,739 --> 01:26:42,859
THAT'S WHERE I'D LIKE TO BE.

1528
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:53,500
ON NOVEMBER 19,
LINCOLN TRAVELED TO GETTYSBURG

1529
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:57,004
TO DEDICATE
THE NEW UNION CEMETERY.

1530
01:26:57,171 --> 01:27:00,466
THE FEATURED SPEAKER WAS
EDWARD EVERETT OF MASSACHUSETTS,

1531
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:04,762
A DIPLOMAT, CLERGYMAN,
AND CELEBRATED ORATOR.

1532
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:07,765
THE PRESIDENT HAD BEEN INVITED
ALMOST AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT

1533
01:27:07,932 --> 01:27:10,100
TO OFFER A FEW
"APPROPRIATE REMARKS."

1534
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:15,356
EVERETT SPOKE
FOR NOT QUITE TWO HOURS,

1535
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:16,857
THEN LINCOLN ROSE.

1536
01:27:19,485 --> 01:27:22,488
A LOCAL PHOTOGRAPHER
TOOK HIS TIME FOCUSING.

1537
01:27:22,655 --> 01:27:24,573
PRESUMABLY THE PRESIDENT
COULD BE COUNTED ON

1538
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,950
TO GO ON FOR AWHILE.

1539
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:31,997
BUT HE SPOKE JUST 269 WORDS.

1540
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:33,999
HE STARTED OFF
BY REMINDING HIS AUDIENCE

1541
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:36,001
THAT JUST 87 YEARS
HAD PASSED

1542
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,295
SINCE THE FOUNDING
OF THE NATION,

1543
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:41,340
AND THEN HE WENT ON
TO EMBOLDEN THE UNION CAUSE

1544
01:27:41,507 --> 01:27:43,968
WITH SOME OF THE MOST
STIRRING WORDS EVER SPOKEN.

1545
01:27:46,971 --> 01:27:48,681
LINCOLN WAS HEADING BACK
TO HIS SEAT

1546
01:27:48,847 --> 01:27:50,808
BEFORE THE PHOTOGRAPHER
COULD OPEN THE SHUTTER.

1547
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,442
HE FELT
THAT HE HAD FAILED,

1548
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:02,027
THAT IT WAS A POOR SPEECH,

1549
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:03,445
THAT THE PEOPLE
DIDN'T LIKE IT.

1550
01:28:03,612 --> 01:28:05,948
IT WAS SO BRIEF--
LESS THAN TWO MINUTES.

1551
01:28:06,115 --> 01:28:07,700
HE FELT THAT HE HAD FAILED.

1552
01:28:07,866 --> 01:28:09,285
LAMON--
HIS FRIEND, WARD LAMON--

1553
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:10,911
WAS SITTING NEXT TO HIM
ON THE STAND.

1554
01:28:11,078 --> 01:28:13,747
WHEN HE SAT DOWN, THERE WAS
JUST A SPRINKLING OF APPLAUSE.

1555
01:28:13,914 --> 01:28:16,834
AND HE SAID, "LAMON,
THAT SPEECH WON'T SCOUR."

1556
01:28:17,001 --> 01:28:19,169
THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY
ABOUT A PLOW IN THE PRAIRIES

1557
01:28:19,336 --> 01:28:22,006
WHEN THE MUD DOESN'T
COME OFF IT.

1558
01:28:22,172 --> 01:28:25,092
"THE CHEEK OF EVERY
AMERICAN MUST TINGLE WITH SHAME

1559
01:28:25,259 --> 01:28:28,679
"AS HE READS THE SILLY, FLAT,
DISH-WATERY UTTERANCES

1560
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:29,888
"OF THE MAN WHO HAS TO BE

1561
01:28:30,055 --> 01:28:32,308
"POINTED OUT
TO INTELLIGENT FOREIGNERS

1562
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,144
AS THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES."

1563
01:28:35,311 --> 01:28:36,437
<i>CHICAGO TIMES.</i>

1564
01:28:38,439 --> 01:28:40,649
"DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,

1565
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:43,527
"I SHOULD BE GLAD
IF I COULD FLATTER MYSELF

1566
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:46,071
"THAT I CAME AS NEAR
TO THE CENTRAL IDEA

1567
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:48,449
"OF THE OCCASION

01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:51,452

1569
01:28:51,618 --> 01:28:52,619
EDWARD EVERETT.

1570
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:03,505
"FOUR SCORE
AND SEVEN YEARS AGO,
