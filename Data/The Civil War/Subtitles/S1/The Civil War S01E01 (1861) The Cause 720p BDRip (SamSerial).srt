1
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:15,725
"WE HAVE SHARED THE
INCOMMUNICABLE EXPERIENCE OF WAR.

2
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,644
"WE HAVE FELT,
WE STILL FEEL,

3
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:21,731
THE PASSION OF LIFE
TO ITS TOP."

4
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:23,983
"IN OUR YOUTHS,

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,445
OUR HEARTS WERE
TOUCHED WITH FIRE."

6
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,655
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.

7
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,956
Narrator:
BY THE SUMMER OF 1861,

8
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:41,250
WILMER McLEAN HAD HAD ENOUGH.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,880
TWO GREAT ARMIES WERE
CONVERGING ON HIS FARM,

10
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,173
AND WHAT WOULD BE

11
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,008
THE FIRST MAJOR BATTLE
OF THE CIVIL WAR--

12
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,926
BULL RUN, OR MANASSAS,

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,595
AS THE CONFEDERATES
CALLED IT--

14
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:56,140
WOULD SOON RAGE ACROSS
THE AGING VIRGINIAN'S FARM,

15
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:57,641
A UNION SHELL GOING SO FAR

16
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:00,019
AS TO EXPLODE
IN THE SUMMER KITCHEN.

17
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,816
NOW McLEAN MOVED HIS FAMILY
AWAY FROM MANASSAS,

18
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,943
FAR SOUTH AND WEST
OF RICHMOND,

19
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,945
OUT OF HARM'S WAY,
HE PRAYED,

20
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,655
TO A DUSTY
LITTLE CROSSROADS

21
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:15,284
CALLED APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE.

22
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,495
AND IT WAS THERE
IN HIS LIVING ROOM,

23
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,080
3½ YEARS LATER,

24
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:22,208
THAT LEE
SURRENDERED TO GRANT...

25
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,377
AND WILMER McLEAN
COULD RIGHTFULLY SAY

26
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,588
THAT "THE WAR BEGAN
IN MY FRONT YARD

27
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,132
AND ENDED
IN MY FRONT PARLOR."

28
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,944
THE CIVIL WAR WAS FOUGHT
IN 10,000 PLACES

29
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,779
FROM VALVERDE,
NEW MEXICO,

30
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,948
AND TULLAHOMA, TENNESSEE,

31
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,533
TO ST. ALB ANS, VERMONT,

32
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,953
AND FERNANDINA ON
THE FLORIDA COAST.

33
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,250
MORE THAN 3 MILLION
AMERICANS FOUGHT IN IT,

34
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:32,796
AND OVER 600,000 MEN,
2% OF THE POPULATION,

35
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,216
DIED IN IT.

36
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,845
AMERICAN HOMES
BECAME HEADQUARTERS.

37
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,972
AMERICAN CHURCHES
AND SCHOOLHOUSES

38
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,225
SHELTERED THE DYING...

39
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:49,980
AND HUGE FORAGING ARMIES
SWEPT ACROSS AMERICAN FARMS

40
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,775
AND BURNED
AMERICAN TOWNS.

41
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,155
AMERICANS SLAUGHTERED
ONE ANOTHER WHOLESALE HERE,

42
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,991
IN AMERICA,
IN THEIR OWN CORN FIELDS

43
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,493
AND PEACH ORCHARDS,

44
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,994
ALONG FAMILIAR ROADS,

45
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,539
AND BY WATERS WITH
OLD AMERICAN NAMES.

46
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,043
IN TWO DAYS AT SHILOH,

47
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,545
ON THE BANKS
OF THE TENNESSEE,

48
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,047
MORE AMERICAN MEN FELL

49
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,384
THAN IN ALL PREVIOUS
AMERICAN WARS COMBINED.

50
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:22,179
AT COLD HARBOR,

51
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:26,725
7,000 AMERICANS FELL
IN 20 MINUTES.

52
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:36,485
MEN WHO HAD
NEVER STRAYED 20 MILES

53
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:38,195
FROM THEIR
OWN FRONT DOORS

54
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:41,198
NOW FOUND THEMSELVES
SOLDIERS IN GREAT ARMIES,

55
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:44,493
FIGHTING EPIC BATTLES
HUNDREDS OF MILES FROM HOME.

56
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,373
THEY KNEW
THEY WERE MAKING HISTORY,

57
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,501
AND IT WAS THE GREATEST
ADVENTURE OF THEIR LIVES.

58
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,925
THE WAR MADE SOME RICH,
RUINED OTHERS,

59
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,343
AND CHANGED FOREVER

60
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,763
THE LIVES OF ALL
WHO LIVED THROUGH IT...

61
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,391
A LACKLUSTER CLERK
FROM GALENA, ILLINOIS,

62
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,227
A FAILURE IN EVERYTHING
EXCEPT MARRIAGE AND WAR,

63
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,689
WHO, IN 3 YEARS, WOULD
BE HEAD OF THE UNION ARMY

64
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:17,192
AND IN 7, PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES;

65
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,404
AN ECCENTRIC STUDENT OF
THEOLOGY AND MILITARY TACTICS,

66
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,156
A HYPOCHONDRIAC

67
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:24,867
WHO RODE INTO BATTLE
WITH ONE HAND RAISED

68
00:05:25,034 --> 00:05:28,954
"TO KEEP," HE SAID,
"THE BLOOD BALANCED;"

69
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,914
A COLLEGE PROFESSOR
FROM MAINE,

70
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,250
WHO, ON A LITTLE HILL
IN PENNSYLVANIA,

71
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,919
ORDERED AN UNLIKELY
TEXTBOOK MANEUVER

72
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,379
THAT SAVED THE UNION ARMY

73
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,840
AND POSSIBLY
THE UNION ITSELF...

74
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,885
TWO ORDINARY SOLDIERS--

75
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:46,055
ONE FROM PROVIDENCE,
RHODE ISLAND,

76
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,515
THE OTHER FROM
COLUMBIA, TENNESSEE,

77
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,559
WHO EACH SERVED 4 YEARS

78
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,603
AND TOGETHER SEEMED
TO HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE

79
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,398
DURING THE WAR AND LIVED
TO TELL THE TALE...

80
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,444
THE COURTLY,
UNKNOWABLE ARISTOCRAT,

81
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:03,364
WHO DISAPPROVED
OF SECESSION AND SLAVERY,

82
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,032
YET WENT ON
TO DEFEND THEM BOTH

83
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,368
AT THE HEAD OF ONE
OF THE GREATEST ARMIES

84
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,161
OF ALL TIME;

85
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,956
THE RUNAWAY BOY WHO
"STOLE HIMSELF" FROM SLAVERY,

86
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,334
RECRUITED TWO REGIMENTS
OF BLACK SOLDIERS,

87
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,628
AND HELPED TRANSFORM
THE CIVIL WAR

88
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,173
INTO A STRUGGLE FOR
THE FREEDOM OF ALL AMERICANS.

89
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,178
AND THEN THERE WAS
THE ROUGH MAN FROM ILLINOIS,

90
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,305
WHO WOULD RISE TO BE
THE GREATEST PRESIDENT

91
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:30,349
THE COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN.

92
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,980
BETWEEN 1861 AND 1865,

93
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,982
AMERICANS MADE WAR
ON EACH OTHER

94
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,819
AND KILLED EACH OTHER
IN GREAT NUMBERS,

95
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,071
IF ONLY TO BECOME
THE KIND OF COUNTRY

96
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,697
THAT COULD
NO LONGER CONCEIVE

97
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,699
HOW THAT WAS POSSIBLE.

98
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,453
WHAT BEGAN
AS A BITTER DISPUTE

99
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,997
OVER UNION
AND STATES' RIGHTS

100
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,332
ENDED AS A STRUGGLE

101
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,210
OVER THE MEANING
OF FREEDOM IN AMERICA.

102
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,839
AT GETTYSBURG IN 1863,

103
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:06,009
ABRAHAM LINCOLN SAID
PERHAPS MORE THAN HE KNEW.

104
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:10,055
THE WAR WAS ABOUT
"A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM."

105
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,692
Announcer: 1938--75th ANNIVERSARY
OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG.

106
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,068
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT

107
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,404
SPOKE TO THE REMAINING
FEW CIVIL WAR VETERANS.

108
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:29,324
VETERANS OF THE BLUE
AND THE GRAY...

109
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:35,038
ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE
OF THE UNITED STATES,

110
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:38,125
I ACCEPT THIS MONUMENT

111
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:42,296
IN THE SPIRIT OF
BROTHERHOOD AND PEACE.

112
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,507
YEAR AFTER YEAR,
THE NATION REMEMBERED.

113
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,968
IN 1930, VETERANS
OF THE UNION ARMY

114
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,678
MARCHED IN
CINCINNATI, OHIO,

115
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,763
4 YEARS LATER,
IN NEW YORK CITY.

116
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,892
THEY AND THE SURVIVING
VETERANS OF THE CONFEDERACY

117
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,560
WERE THE LAST LINK

118
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,229
WITH A TERRIBLE CONFLICT
THAT TORE AMERICA APART

119
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,399
FROM 1861 TO 1865.

120
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:05,944
THE LAST CIVIL WAR VETERAN
WOULD DIE IN 1959,

121
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,906
AND NO LONGER WOULD THERE BE LIVING
MEMORIES OF LONG-AGO BATTLES,

122
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,409
ONLY HISTORY AND LEGENDS.

123
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,966
ANY UNDERSTANDING
OF THIS NATION

124
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,260
HAS TO BE BASED,
AND I MEAN REALLY BASED,

125
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,867
ON AN UNDERSTANDING
OF THE CIVIL WAR.

126
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:32,892
I BELIEVE THAT FIRMLY.

127
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:34,264
IT DEFINED US.

128
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:37,100
THE REVOLUTION
DID WHAT IT DID.

129
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,894
OUR INVOLVEMENT
IN EUROPEAN WARS,

130
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,187
BEGINNING WITH
THE FIRST WORLD WAR,

131
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:41,772
DID WHAT IT DID,

132
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:45,609
BUT THE CIVIL WAR
DEFINED US AS WHAT WE ARE,

133
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:49,821
AND IT OPENED US
TO BEING WHAT WE BECAME,

134
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,407
GOOD AND BAD THINGS.

135
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,993
AND IT--
IT IS VERY NECESSARY

136
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,913
IF YOU'RE GOING TO UNDERSTAND
THE AMERICAN CHARACTER

137
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,623
IN THE 20th CENTURY

138
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,042
TO LEARN ABOUT THIS
ENORMOUS CATASTROPHE

139
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,336
OF THE MID-19th CENTURY.

140
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,172
IT WAS THE--THE-- THE
CROSSROADS OF OUR BEING,

141
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,925
AND IT WAS A HELL
OF A CROSSROADS.

142
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:13,845
FOR ME, THE PICTURE
OF THE CIVIL WAR

143
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:17,224
AS A HISTORIC
PHENOMENON...

144
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,893
IS NOT
ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

145
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,520
IT'S NOT ABOUT WEAPONS.

146
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,480
IT'S NOT
ABOUT SOLDIERS,

147
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,023
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT

148
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,858
THAT WEAPONS
AND SOLDIERS

149
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,695
AT THAT CRUCIAL MOMENT

150
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,364
JOINED A DISCUSSION
ABOUT SOMETHING HIGHER,

151
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:35,284
ABOUT HUMANITY,
ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY,

152
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,952
ABOUT HUMAN FREEDOM.

153
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,043
"WHENCE SHALL WE EXPECT
THE APPROACH OF DANGER?

154
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,714
"SHALL SOME TRANSATLANTIC
GIANT STEP THE EARTH

155
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,842
"AND CRUSH US AT A BLOW?

156
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,218
"NEVER.

157
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,597
"ALL THE ARMIES
OF EUROPE AND ASIA

158
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,557
"COULD NOT BY FORCE

00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,517

"ASA NATION OF FREE MEN,

166
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,958
ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 1837.

167
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,928
IN 1861,

168
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,306
MOST OF THE NATION'S
31 MILLION PEOPLE

169
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:43,435
LIVED PEACEABLY ON FARMS
AND IN SMALL TOWNS.

170
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,854
AT SHARPSBURG, MARYLAND,

171
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,440
A GERMAN PACIFIST SECT,
THE DUNKARDS,

172
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:52,277
MADE THEIR HOME IN
A SEA OF WHEAT AND CORN.

173
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:56,448
IN GETTYSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA,

FAILED TO DO THE THING

WE REALLY HAVE A GENIUS
FOR, WHICH IS COMPROMISE.

269

AMERICANS LIKE TO THINK OF
THEMSELVES AS UNCOMPROMISING.

270

OUR TRUE GENIUS
IS FOR COMPROMISE.

271
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,593
OUR WHOLE GOVERNMENT'S
FOUNDED ON IT,

272
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,344

BUT FEW COULD CONCEIVE
OF ANY ALTERNATIVE.

THOMAS JEFFERSON OF VIRGINIA
SAID MAINTAINING SLAVERY

288
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,723
WAS LIKE HOLDING A WOLF

289
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:19,974
YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT,

290
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:23,895
BUT YOU DIDN'T DARE
LET IT GO.

291
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,607
THEN IN 1793,
A NORTHERNER, ELI WHITNEY,

292
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,236
TAUGHT THE SOUTH
HOW TO MAKE SLAVERY PAY.

WHITNEY'S ENGINE,
OR GIN,

294
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,826
MADE IT EASIER TO SEPARATE
COTTON FROM ITS SEED.

295
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:43,456
WHERE BEFORE IT HAD TAKEN
ONE SLAVE 10 HOURS

TO PRODUCE A SINGLE
POUND OF LINT,

297
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:50,255
THE COTTON GIN COULD CRANK OUT
A THOUSAND POUNDS A DAY.

PRODUCTION SOARED...

299
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,846

SOUTHERNERS WORRIED
ABOUT THE GROWING POLITICAL

AS WELL AS ECONOMIC
POWER OF THE NORTH.

347
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,959
NORTHERNERS WERE INCREASINGLY
HOSTILE TO SLAVERY.

HE DETESTED SLAVERY,

HE WARNED THE PRESIDENT.

1242
01:08:08,627 --> 01:08:11,463
"YOU ARE GREEN, IT IS TRUE,"

AND CLAPPED THE MAYOR
AND 19 SECESSIONIST LEGISLATORS

IN JAIL WITHOUT TRIAL.

1254

CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY RULED
THAT THE PRESIDENT

1255
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:47,582

1256
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:49,251

IGNORED HIM.

HE'S GOT
SO MANY SIDES TO HIM.

1262
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:09,771
THE CURIOUS THING
ABOUT LINCOLN TO ME,

1263
01:09:09,938 --> 01:09:13,233
IS THAT HE COULD REMOVE
HIMSELF FROM HIMSELF

1264
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,902

AT HIMSELF.

1265

WITH STORIES OF HIS COMPASSION,

THAT PEOPLE FORGET WHAT A
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT MAN HE WAS,

AND ALMOST
EVERYTHING HE DID--

1271
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:38,091
ALMOST EVERYTHING HE DID
WAS CALCULATED FOR EFFECT.

AT THE CENTER
OF THE SOUTHERN LINE

1405
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:52,567
WAS A VIRGINIA BRIGADE LED

TRYING TO RALLY
HIS OWN FRIGHTENED MEN,

1410
01:17:01,576 --> 01:17:04,746
SHOUTED, "LOOK! THERE'S JACKSON
WITH HIS VIRGINIANS,

STANDING LIKE
A STONE WALL."

THE NAME STUCK.

1413
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:12,420
Foote: HE HAD
THE STRANGE COMBINATION

1414
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:17,050
OF RELIGIOUS FANATICISM
AND A GLORY IN BATTLE.

1415
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,551
HE--HE LOVED BATTLE.

1416
01:17:18,718 --> 01:17:20,261
HIS EYES WOULD
LIGHT UP.

1417
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:21,888
THEY CALLED HIM
OLD BLUE LIGHT

1418
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:24,265
BECAUSE OF THE WAY HIS EYES
VVOULD LIGHT UP IN BATTLE.

1419
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:25,767
HE WAS TOTALLY FEARLESS,

1420

HAD NO THOUGHT
WHATSOEVER OF--OF DANGER

1421

AT ANY TIME
WHEN THE BATTLE WAS ON,

1422
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:32,523

WHAT HE WANTED TO DO.

GET THEM RUNNING,

EVERY TIME."

1427
01:17:39,197 --> 01:17:43,451
HE KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT
A REPUTATION FOR VICTORY

1428
01:17:43,618 --> 01:17:46,621
WOULD ROLL AND BUILD.

1429

Narrator:
IT WAS THE TURNING POINT.

1430
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:53,169
AT 4:00, BEAUREGARD
ORDERED A COUNTERATTACK.

1431
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:57,757
JACKSON URGED HIS MEN
TO YELL LIKE FURIES.

1432

THE REBEL YELL
FIRST HEARD THAT DAY

1433
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,722

FELL APART.
