1
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,682
AT THE WILLARD HOTEL
IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

2
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,892
THE POET JULIA WARD HOWE

3
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,854
AWOKE FROM
A SPECTACULAR DREAM.

4
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,064
THAT DAY, SHE HAD HEARD
ANEW ENGLAND REGIMENT

5
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,984
SINGING ON PARADE...
AND HAD FALLEN ASLEEP

6
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,194
WITH THE SONG
<i>JOHN BROWN'S BODY</i>

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,613
RINGING IN HER HEAD.

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,867
NOW, IN THE DARK,
SHE GOT UP

9
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:36,037
AND SCRIBBLED OUT THE WORDS
WITH A PENCIL STUB.

10
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,663
SHE SOLD HER POEM

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,083
TO THE <i>ATLANTIC MONTHLY</i>
FOR $4.00.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,502
IT BECAME THE ANTHEM
OF THE UNION.

13
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:37,098
BY 1862, RUSSIA
HAD EMANCIPATED THE SERFS.

14
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:40,935
IN FRANCE, VICTOR HUGO
PUBLISHED LES MISERABLES,

15
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:45,397
AND JEAN BERNARD FOUCAULT
MEASURED THE SPEED OF LIGHT.

16
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,025
IN AMERICA,
THE UNITED STATES

17
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:50,694
PASSED THE FIRST
NATIONAL INCOME TAX

18
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,404
TO PAY FOR WAR.

19
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,406
THE GATLING GUN
WAS INVENTED,

20
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,951
AND WAR ITSELF
WAS CHANGING.

21
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,577
THE SHOCKING CASUALTIES

22
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,080
OF BULL RUN
AND WILSON'S CREEK

23
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,958
WERE DWARFED
BY BATTLE AFTER BATTLE.

24
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:07,461
AND NOW THERE WERE
NEW QUESTIONS--

25
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,672
WOULD THE NORTH'S STRENGTH
BE OFFSET

26
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,924
BY INCOMPETENCE
AND LOW MORALE?

27
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:15,469
WOULD ENGLAND SIDE
WITH COTTON AND THE SOUTH?

28
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,389
WHO WOULD CONTROL
THE MISSISSIPPI?

29
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,811
FOR A YEAR,
THE NATION, NOW TWO NATIONS,

30
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,063
HAD TORN ITSELF APART.

31
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,690
FROM A BLOODLESS DUEL

32
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:30,693
OVER A MAN-MADE ISLAND
IN CHARLESTON HARBOR,

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,154
THE WAR HAD SPREAD ALONG
A THOUSAND-MILE LINE

34
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,864
FROM MANASSAS, VIRGINIA,

35
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,449
TO SHANGHAI, MISSOURI,
AND BEYOND.

36
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,163
AS 1862 BEGAN,

37
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,207
OVER A MILLION MEN
WERE MASSING FOR WAR.

38
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,920
IN A FIERCE STRUGGLE
FOR TENNESSEE,

39
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,089
THE PEOPLE OF CLARKSVILLE
ON THE CUMBERLAND

40
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,467
FOUND THEMSELVES PRISONERS
IN THEIR OWN HOMES.

41
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,555
FAR NORTH OF ANY FIGHTING,

42
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:02,641
THE PEOPLE OF DEER ISLE, MAINE,
SUFFERED, TOO--

43
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:03,976
WITH SAD NEWS

44
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:08,105
FROM PLACES MOST OF THEM
HAD NEVER HEARD OF.

45
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,566
BY THE END OF THE WAR,

46
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,776
THE LITTLE TOWN
OF WINCHESTER, VIRGINIA,

47
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,946
HAD CHANGED HANDS <i>72</i> TIMES.

48
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:20,284
SAM WATKINS,
A CON FEDERATE PRIVATE,

49
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:22,244
WOULD SEE
HIS FIRST BIG BATTLE

50
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,705
IN APRIL ON THE BANKS
OF THE TENNESSEE.

51
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,957
ELISHA HUNT RHODES,

52
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,709
A CLERK FROM PROVIDENCE,
RHODE ISLAND,

53
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,711
WOULD CELEBRATE
HIS 20th BIRTHDAY

54
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,422
IN A UNION CAMP.

55
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,342
UNION GENERAL GEORGE McCLELLAN,

56
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:39,345
THE IDOL OF HIS TROOPS,
WOULD FASHION A MIGHTY ARMY

57
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,263
AND LEAD IT SOUTH
TOWARDS RICHMOND,

58
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,516
WHERE ROBERT E. LEE
WAS WAITING.

59
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,397
"THE STRUGGLE OF TODAY,"
LINCOLN TOLD CONGRESS,

60
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,399
"IS NOT ALTOGETHER
FOR TODAY.

61
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:56,820
IT IS
FOR A VAST FUTURE, ALSO."

62
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:59,198
NOW, IN THIS,
ITS SECOND YEAR,

63
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,075
THE WAR WAS
BECOMING A STRUGGLE

64
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:04,536
OVER THE FUTURE
OF FREEDOM.

65
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,581
IT REALLY IS
ONE OF THOSE, UM...

66
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,583
ONE OF THOSE
WATERSHED THINGS.

67
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,585
IT WAS A HUGE CHASM

68
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,588
BETWEEN THE BEGINNING
AND THE END OF THE WAR.

69
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,590
THE NATION
HAD COME FACE TO FACE

70
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,592
WITH, A DREADFUL TRAGEDY,

71
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,594
AND WE REACTED THE WAY
A FAMILY WOULD DO

72
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,222
WITH A DREADFUL TRAGEDY.

73
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,640
IT WAS ALMOST
INCONCEIVABLE

74
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:27,142
THAT ANYTHING THAT
HORRENDOUS COULD HAPPEN.

75
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,521
YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT
CASUALTIES IN CIVIL WAR BATTLES

76
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:33,524
WERE SO FAR BEYOND ANYTHING
WE CAN IMAGINE NOW.

77
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,527
IF WE HAD 10% CASUALTIES
IN A BATTLE TODAY,

78
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,654
IT WOULD BE LOOKED ON
AS A BLOODBATH.

79
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,699
THEY HAD 30%
IN SEVERAL BATTLES,

80
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:45,077
AND ONE AFTER ANOTHER,
YOU SEE.

81
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,877
"THIS AFTERNOON, SEEING THE
GENERAL ALONE IN THE OFFICE,

82
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:37,588
"I STEPPED UP TO HIM
AND SAID,

83
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:39,882
<i>"GENERAL, I WANT
TO GO HOME.</i>

84
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:43,177
<i>"WANT TO GO HOME? AND FOR WHAT?
HE</i> REPLIED.

85
00:05:43,344 --> 00:05:44,762
"AS I COULD NOT
THINK OF AN EXCUSE,

86
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:48,891
"I BLURTED OUT, <i>I WANT
TO SEE MY MOTHER.</i>

87
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,893
"IS SHE SICK?
HE ASKED.

88
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,228
<i>"NO,</i> I REPLIED,
<i>I HOPE NOT.</i>

89
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,231
"HE THEN ASKED ME HOW
LONG SINCE I LEFT HOME

90
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,649
"AND IF I WAS
EVER AWAY

91
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,777
"FOR SO LONG A TIME
BEFORE.

92
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:00,986
"I TOLD HIM

93
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,529
"I HAD BEEN
IN THE SERVICE 7 MONTHS

94
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,449
"AND NEVER HAD BEEN
AWAY FROM HOME ALONE BEFORE.

95
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,451
"WELL,
SAID THE GENERAL,

00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,286
<i>"YOU HAVE BEEN
A GOOD BOY,</i>

97
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,289

00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,337
"I ALWAYS SHOT AT PRIVATES.

"IT WAS THEY THAT DID
THE SHOOTING AND KILLING,

"AND IF I COULD KILL
OR WOUND A PRIVATE,

102
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:25,803
"WHY, MY CHANCES
WERE SO MUCH THE BETTER.

103
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:29,473
I ALWAYS LOOKED ON OFFICERS
AS HARMLESS PERSONAGES."

THE COMMANDER OF

OF MOST PRESIDENTS--

HE WAS FAIRLY RUN CRAZY
BY OFFICE SEEKERS,

00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,356
ESPECIALLY AT THE START,

150
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,566
WHEN HIS CAMPAIGN MANAGERS
HAD PROMISED JOBS

151
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,569
TO A GREAT MANY PEOPLE
WHO CAME TO COLLECT THEM.

152
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:48,946
AND ONE MAN SAW HIM
ONE DAY,

153
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:50,489
AND HE LOOKED
PARTICULARLY WORRIED.

154
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:52,576
THE MAN SAID, "WHAT'S
THE MATTER, MR. PRESIDENT?"

155
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,577
AND LINCOLN SAID, "THERE'S
TOO MANY PIGS FOR THE TITS."

156
00:09:04,545 --> 00:09:06,755
ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S
PROBLEMS WERE NOT CONFINED

165
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:27,526
THEY COULD DO A BETTER JOB
THAN THEIR CHIEF.

SECRETARY OF STATE
WILLIAM H. SEWARD

00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,880
A PENNSYLVANIA BOSS
SO CORRUPT, SAID LINCOLN,

174
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:50,591
THAT THE ONLY THING
HE WOULDN'T STEAL

175
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,010
WAS A RED-HOT STOVE.

176
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:56,471
THE NEW SECRETARY OF WAR
WAS EDWIN M. STANTON,

177
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:59,474
AN ABLE, RUTHLESS
WAR DEMOCRAT FROM OHIO

178
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:01,727
WHO WORRIED ABOUT
WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE

179
00:10:01,893 --> 00:10:04,396
LINCOLN'S
"PAINFUL IMBECILITY."

180
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,735
ON ONE THING,
THE CABINET WAS AGREED.

181
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,738
GENERAL GEORGE McCLELLAN
WAS NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH

182
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,740
AGAINST THE CON FEDERATES.

183
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,451
"THE ARMY," SECRETARY OF WAR
STANTON SAID,

184
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,078
"HAS GOT TO FIGHT
OR RUN AWAY.

185
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,664
"THE CHAMPAGNE AND OYSTERS
ON THE POTOMAC

186
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,666
MUST BE STOPPED."

187
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,501
"DEAR ELLEN,

188
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,504
"I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW DISGUSTED I AM BECOMING

189
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,548
"WITH THESE
WRETCHED POLITICIANS.

190
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,551
"THEY ARE A MOST
DESPICABLE SET OF MEN.

191
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,554
"SEWARD IS A MEDDLING, OFFICIOUS,
INCOMPETENT LITTLE PUPPY.

192
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:39,556
"THE PRESIDENT
IS NOTHING MORE

193
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,475
THAN A WELL-MEANING
BABOON."

194
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,310
GEORGE McCLELLAN.

195
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:48,607
THE PRESIDENT
PORED OVER MILITARY BOOKS,

196
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,900
ASKED OFFICERS FOR ADVICE,

197
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,902
AND IN EXASPERATION

198
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:53,904
SUGGESTED THAT
"IF GENERAL MCCLELLAN

199
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,697
"DOES NOT WANT
TO USE THE ARMY,

200
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,034
I WOULD LIKE TO BORROW IT
FOR A TIME."

201
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,120
FINALLY, HE ORDERED McCLELLAN

202
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:04,122
TO MOVE
ON MANASSAS JUNCTION,

203
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,125
AND THEN PROCEED OVERLAND
TO TAKE RICHMOND,

204
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,127
BUT MCCLELLAN
WOULD NOT MOVE

205
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,505
AND TOOK TO HIS BED
WITH A FEVER.

206
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,006
MCCLELLAN
DID NOT WANT TO FIGHT

207
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,134
THE VAST CONFEDERATE ARMY
HE HAD CONVINCED HIMSELF

208
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,096
NOW OCCUPIED
NORTHERN VIRGINIA.

209
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,223
INSTEAD, HE PROPOSED
TO FLOAT HIS ARMY

210
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,100
TO FORTRESS MONROE

211
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,643
AT THE TIP
OF THE FINGER OF LAND

212
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,021
BETWEEN THE JAMES
AND YORK RIVERS,

213
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,023
THEN RACE UP
THE PENINSULA

214
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,526
TO SEIZE
THE CON FEDERATE CAPITAL.

215
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,991
IMPATIENT FOR ANY ACTION,
LINCOLN AGREED.

216
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,577
MCCLELLAN WOULD MOVE
IN MID MARCH.

217
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,413
IT HAD BEEN 8 MONTHS

218
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,331
SINCE THE NORTHERN ARMY
HAD CRAWLED BACK

219
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:49,668
INTO WASHINGTON
AFTER BULL RUN.

220
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,671
"FEBRUARY 9, 1862.

221
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,673
"DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,

"GENERAL McCLELLAN HAS ALMOST
RUINED YOUR ADMINISTRATION

00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:01,346
"HE IS A DO-NOTHING.

"HE IS THINKING
OF THE PRESIDENCY IN '64.

226
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,727
"HE IS PLACATING

00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,562
"THAT'S WHAT
AILS HIM.

00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,697
"THE PEOPLE

244
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,392
GEORGE McCLELLAN.

245
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,020
IN THE MIDST
OF ALL HIS TROUBLES,

246
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,939
THE PRESIDENT DELIGHTED
IN HIS SONS.

247
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,942
THE OLDEST, ROBERT,
WAS AWAY AT HARVARD,

248
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,820
BUT WILLIE, 11,
AND 8-YEAR-OLD THOMAS,

249
00:12:58,987 --> 00:12:59,946
KNOWN AS TAD,

250
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,866
HAD THE RUN
OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

251
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:06,661
WILLIE WAS STUDIOUS,
LIKED TO COMPOSE VERSE

252
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,456
AND MEMORIZE
RAILROAD TIMETABLES.

253
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,458
HE HAD RAISED
A BOYS' BATTALION

254
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:12,834
FROM AMONG
HIS SCHOOLMATES

255
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,379
AND INVADED CABINET MEETINGS
WITH HIS "TROOPS."

256
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,881
IN FEBRUARY,

257
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,759
HE DEVELOPED WHAT THE DOCTOR
CALLED "BILIOUS FEVER."

258
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,470
HIS PARENTS SAT UP
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT

259
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:25,305
TO NURSE HIM.

260
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,975
ON FEBRUARY 20,
WILLIE DIED.

261
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:32,771
FOR 3 MONTHS,

262
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,398
MARY LINCOLN VEERED
BETWEEN LOUD WEEPING

263
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,400
AND SILENT DEPRESSION

264
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,778
AND SOUGHT TO COMMUNICATE
WITH HER DEAD CHILD

265
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,447
THROUGH SPIRITUALISTS.

266
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,825
"IF I HAD NOT FELT

267
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,995
"THE SPUR OF NECESSITY
URGING ME TO CHEER MR. LINCOLN,

268
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,457
"WHOSE GRIEF
WAS AS GREAT AS MY OWN,

269
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,876
I COULD NEVER
HAVE SMILED AGAIN."

270
00:13:58,296 --> 00:14:01,550
THE WAR LEFT LINCOLN
LITTLE TIME TO MOURN.

271
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:05,554
HE WAS SOON BACK WORKING
18 HOURS A DAY.

272
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,436
"AS SHE CAME PLOWING
THROUGH THE WATER,

273
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,065
"SHE LOOKED LIKE A HUGE
HALF-SUBMERGED CROCODILE.

274
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,608
"AT HER PROW,

275
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,237
I COULD SEE THE IRON RAM
PROJECTING STRAIGHT FORWARD."

276
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,824
THE CONFEDERACY
HAD BEGUN THE WAR

277
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,784
WITH NO NAVY WHATSOEVER,

278
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,953
BUT BY THE FALL OF 1861,

279
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,039
CONFEDERATE ENGINEERS
WERE BOLTING IRON PLATES

280
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,792
TO THE HULL OF
THE STEAM FRIGATE MERRIMACK,

281
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,794
BUILDING A WARSHIP
MORE POWERFUL

282
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:40,797
THAN ANYTHING
THE UNION HAD.

283
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:44,801
NEWS OF THE MONSTER
QUICKLY REACHED THE NORTH.

284
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,177
SECRETARY OF WAR STANTON

285
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,471
FEARED SHE WOULD STEAM
UP THE POTOMAC

286
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,391
AND SHELL THE WHITE HOUSE.

287
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,728
THERE WAS PROBABLY
ONLY ONE MAN IN AMERICA

288
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,730
<i>WHO</i> COULD <i>STOP
THE MERRIMACK,</i>

289
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,773
AND HE WAS MAD
AT THE NAVY.

290
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,068
THE SWEDISH-BORN INVENTOR
JOHN ERICSSON

291
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,487
WAS PROUD, VAIN,
AND CRANKY,

292
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,364
AND FELT HE HAD BEEN
CHEATED OUT OF PAYMENT

293
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,367
FOR SERVICES TO
THE GOVERNMENT YEARS BEFORE,

294
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:12,829
BUT WHEN SECRETARY
OF THE NAVY GIDEON WELLES

295
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,707
BEGGED HIM TO DO SOMETHING
TO STOP THE <i>MERRIMACK,</i>

296
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:19,127
ERICSSON CAME UP WITH
AN EXTRAORDINARY DESIGN.

297
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,671
HIS SHIP
WOULD HAVE ONLY TWO GUNS

298
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,131
<i>TO THE MERRIMACK'S 10,</i>

299
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:26,051
BUT THEY WOULD BE MOUNTED
ON A REVOLVING TURRET,

300
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:29,262
AND THOUGH HIS VESSEL WOULD
BE MADE ENTIRELY OF IRON,

301
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,306
ERICSSON ASSURED EVERYBODY

302
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,224
THAT "THE SEA
SHALL RIDE OVER HER,

303
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,895
AND SHE SHALL LIVE IN IT
LIKE A DUCK."

304
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,815
PROFESSIONAL NAVY MEN
DISMISSED THE PLAN,

305
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,192
BUT LINCOLN
OVERRULED THEM,

306
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:46,613
AND JUST 100 DAYS LATER,
ON JANUARY 30, 1862,

307
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,241
ERICSSON'S SHIP SLID
INTO MANHATTAN'S EAST RIVER.

308
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,203
HE CALLED HER THE MONITOR,

309
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,373
AND THERE HAD NEVER BEEN
ANYTHING LIKE HER.

310
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:01,836
THE SINGLE VESSEL CONTAINED
47 PATENTABLE INVENTIONS.

311
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,298
"WE RAN FIRST
TO THE NEW YORK SIDE

312
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,925
"AND THEN TO BROOKLYN,

313
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,052
"AND SO BACK AND FORTH
ACROSS THE RIVER,

314
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:12,013
"LIKE A DRUNKEN MAN
ON A SIDEWALK.

315
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,934
WE FOUND SHE WOULD NOT ANSWER
HER RUDDER AT ALL."

316
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:18,561
ONCE AT SEA,
WATER SPILLED IN,

317
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,230
VENTILATORS FAILED,

318
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,942
THE SHIP FILLED WITH GAS,
HER CREW BEGAN TO FAINT,

319
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:28,113
BUT THE MONITOR
KEPT LIMPING SOUTH.

320
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,616
400 MILES AWAY,
OFF THE COAST OF VIRGINIA,

321
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,910
THE <i>MERRIMACK</i> WAS WAITING.

322
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,874
SATURDAY, MARCH 8,
WAS WASH DAY

323
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,210
FOR THE UNION FLEET
IN HAMPTON ROADS, VIRGINIA.

324
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,962
LAUNDRY WAS DRYING
ON THE RIGGING

325
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,672
OF THE UNION WARSHIPS

326
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,048
WHEN THE CONFEDERATE
<i>MERRIMACK</i>

327
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:49,884
HEADED STRAIGHT
FOR THE U.S.S. <i>CUMBERLAND.</i>

328
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,723
THE CUMBERLAND
OPENED FIRE,

329
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,224
BUT THE SHOTS
BOUNCED HARMLESSLY

330
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,226
OFF THE <i>MERRIMACK'S</i> SIDE.

331
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,729
THE CONFEDERATE SHIP
RAMMED THE CUMBERLAND,

332
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,022
THEN STOOD IN SO CLOSE,

333
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,232
THEIR MUZZLES
ALMOST TOUCHED.

334
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,612
THE CUMBERLAND
SANK IN SHALLOW WATER.

335
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,406
THE <i>MERRIMACK</i> WENT ON

336
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,533
TO SET
THE U.S.S. CONGRESS AFIRE,

337
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,994
DROVE THE U.S.S. MINNESOTA
AGROUND,

338
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,330
THEN DREW BACK
FOR THE NIGHT.

339
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:20,957
FOR ONE DAY,

340
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:23,710
THE CONFEDERATE NAVY
RULED THE SEA.

341
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,548
AT 1:00 THAT MORNING,

342
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,925
THE CREW
OF THE BATTERED MINNESOTA

343
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,636
SAW A STRANGE-LOOKING SHIP
DRAW UP ALONGSIDE THEM

344
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,930
IN THE DARKNESS.

345
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,475
"CLOSE ALONGSIDE
THE MINNESOTA,

346
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,269

"NO SAILS, NO WHEELS,
NO SMOKESTACK, NO GUNS.

351
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,116
WHAT COULD IT BE?"

352
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,993
THE MONITOR HAD ARRIVED.

353
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,122
THE NEXT MORNING,

354
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,792
THE EPIC BATTLE
OF IRONCLADS BEGAN.

355
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:15,762
HULL TO HULL, THE TWO SHIPS
HAMMERED AWAY AT EACH OTHER,

356
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,223
SO CLOSE,
THEY COLLIDED 5 TIMES

357
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,767
AS THE MEN INSIDE,
HALF-BLIND WITH SMOKE,

358
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,227
LOADED AND FIRED.

359
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:35,156
AFTER 4½ HOURS,
THE MERRIMACK DREW OFF.

360
00:18:35,323 --> 00:18:37,200
IT WAS HER ONLY FIGHT.

361
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,537
TWO MONTHS LATER,

362
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,330
RATHER THAN SURRENDER
THEIR SHIP,

363
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,332
THE CONFEDERATES
BLEW HER UP

364
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:47,335
WHEN THEY WERE FORCED
OUT OF NORFOLK.

365
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:50,338
BOTH SIDES SET TO WORK
BUILDING MORE IRONCLADS

366
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:54,175
WHILE EUROPE WATCHED
IN WORRIED FASCINATION.

367
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,554
FROM THE MOMENT
THE TWO SHIPS

368
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,764
OPENED FIRE
THAT SUNDAY MORNING,

369
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,101
EVERY OTHER NAVY ON EARTH
WAS OBSOLETE.

370
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,158
"GENERAL GRANT HABITUALLY
WEARS AN EXPRESSION

371
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,743
"AS IF HE HAD DETERMINED
TO DRIVE HIS HEAD

372
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,497
THROUGH A BRICK WALL
AND WAS ABOUT TO DO IT."

373
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:27,667
THE YEAR 1862

374
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,670
WOULD INTRODUCE TWO GREAT
FORCES INTO THE WAR--

375
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:35,133
UNSPEAKABLE SLAUGHTER
AND ULYSSES S. GRANT.

376
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,886
WHILE MCCLELLAN
HESITATED IN WASHINGTON,

377
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,972
GRANT, BACK IN THE FIELD
AFTER MONTHS OF DESK DUTY,

378
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,558
WON TWO CRUCIAL VICTORIES
OUT WEST.

379
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,688
LAUNCHING SIMULTANEOUS ATTACKS
BY LAND AND WATER,

380
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,733
HE TOOK FIRST FORT HENRY
ON THE TENNESSEE RIVER,

381
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,694
THEN FORT DONELSON
ON THE CUMBERLAND,

382
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,697
WHERE HE ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM
TO THE CONFEDERATE COMMANDER--

383
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,949
"NO TERMS
EXCEPT UNCONDITIONAL

384
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,285
AND IMMEDIATE SURRENDER."

385
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,125
THE TENNESSEE
AND CUMBERLAND RIVERS

386
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:10,543
WERE NOW IN UNION HANDS.

387
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,546
THE CONFEDERATES HAD BEEN
DRIVEN FROM KENTUCKY.

388
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,173
DOZENS OF SOUTHERN TOWNS

389
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,550
WERE NOW OCCUPIED
BY UNION TROOPS.

390
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,093
IN LESS THAN A YEAR,

391
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,513
GRANT HAD GONE FROM CLERK
TO UNION HERO.

392
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,061
NEWS STORIES DESCRIBED HIM
COOLLY SMOKING UNDER FIRE,

393
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:32,398
AND ADMIRERS SHIPPED HIM
BARRELS OF CIGARS.

394
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,318
A DELIGHTED NORTHERN PUBLIC
NOW THOUGHT THEY KNEW

395
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,654
WHAT THE INITIALS
IN HIS NAME STOOD FOR.

396
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,738
THEY CALLED HIM

397
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,032
"UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER"
GRANT.

398
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,830
BUT BEFORE GRANT'S MEN
MARCHED INTO FORT DONELSON,

399
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,458
CONFEDERATE GENERAL
NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST

400
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,253
SLIPPED OUT OF IT
WITH 1,000 MEN.

401
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,046
"I DID NOT COME HERE
FOR THE PURPOSE

402
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,257
OF SURRENDERING MY COMMAND,"
HE SAID,

403
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:02,011
AND LED HIS TROOPS 75 MILES
THROUGH THE SNOW TO SAFETY.

404
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:03,221
GRANT AND THE UNION ARMY

405
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,224
WOULD MEET
BEDFORD FORREST AGAIN.

406
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,187
AFTER THE CONFEDERATE DEFEAT
AT FORT DONELSON,

407
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,356
THE FEMALE ACADEMY
AND STEWART COLLEGE

408
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,191
AT NEARBY
CLARKSVILLE, TENNESSEE,

409
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,653
WERE CONVERTED
TO HOSPITALS.

410

"SUNDAY THE NEWS CAME.

NANNIE HASKINS.

420
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:48,474
THE UNION ARMY
WAS RIGHT BEHIND THE WOUNDED.

421
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:51,019
THEY MET NO RESISTANCE.

422
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,228
A WHITE FLAG FLEW

423
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,023
ABOVE TINY FORT DEFIANCE
WEST OF TOWN,

424
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,149
AND MAYOR SMITH CAME OUT

425
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:57,984
TO INFORM
THE UNION COMMANDER

426
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:01,362
THAT THE CONFEDERATE ARMY
HAD RETREATED TO NASHVILLE.

427
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,908
FARMER JOHN BARKER
WROTE IN HIS DIARY

428
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,660
THAT THERE WERE NOTHING
BUT LINCOLNITES

429
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,163
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY.

430
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,876
AN UN EASY FEDERAL OCCUPATION
OF CLARKSVILLE BEGAN.

431
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,218
EARLY IN THE WAR, SOME--
UM, A UNION SQUAD CLOSED IN

432
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,304
ON A SINGLE
RAGGED CONFEDERATE,

433
00:22:26,471 --> 00:22:29,307
AND HE OBVIOUSLY
DIDN'T OWN ANY SLAVES.

434
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,851
HE COULDN'T HAVE MUCH INTEREST
IN--IN THE CONSTITUTION

435
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,644
OR ANYTHING ELSE.

436
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:36,314
THEY SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU FIGHTING
FOR, ANYHOW?" THEY ASKED HIM.

437
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:37,774
AND HE SAID,
"I'M FIGHTING

438
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,650
BECAUSE YOU'RE
DOWN HERE,"

439
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,029
WHICH IS A PRETTY
SATISFACTORY ANSWER.

ON APRIL 4,
GEORGE MCCLELLAN AT LAST

441
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,294

LESS THAN 20 MILES AWAY,

VASTLY OUTNUMBERED

THE INVADERS.

469

FOR THE NORTH,
IT WAS SLOW GOING.

470

ROADS SAID TO BE
BONE DRY WERE BOGS.

REACHED YORKTOWN,

HAD TAKEN OVER THE BUILDING

USED BY LORD CORNWALLIS
AS HEADQUARTERS

478
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,478
DURING
THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR.

479
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:43,065
THERE WERE JUST 11,000
SOUTHERN TROOPS DUG IN--

480
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:45,735
NOT EVEN 1/10
OF McCLELLAN'S FORCE...

COMMANDER

WAS JOHN BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,

00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:57,538
A SHOWY VIRGINIAN
WHO LOVED AMATEUR THEATRICALS.

484
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,208
HE NOW OUTDID
EVEN HIMSELF.

485
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,210
TO FOOL MCCLELLAN
INTO BELIEVING

486
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,295

WAS ENORMOUS,

00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,413
"ONE MORE CHARGE, AND THEIR
LINES WAVER AND BREAK.

680
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,874
"THEY RETREAT
IN WILD CONFUSION.

681
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:45,167
"WE WERE JUBILANT,

682
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,252
"AND THE OFFICERS
COULD NOT CURB THEIR MEN

683
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:49,046
TO KEEP THEM IN LINE."

684
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:51,256
SAM WATKINS.

685
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:56,178
THE BATTLE EXTENDED
ALONG A 3-MILE FRONT.

686
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,472
THE WORST FIGHTING
WAS IN THE CENTER,

687
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:00,390
WHERE THE REBELS CAME
ON AND ON

688
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:04,978
LIKE "MADDENED DEMONS,"
A UNION SOLDIER SAID.

689
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,897
THE GENERALS DIDN'T
KNOW THEIR JOBS.

690
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:08,732
THE SOLDIERS DIDN'T
KNOW THEIR JOBS.

691
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:12,069
IT WAS JUST PURE DETERMINATION
TO STAND AND FIGHT

692
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,113
AND NOT RETREAT,

693
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,825
AND THE BLOODINESS OF IT
WAS JUST ASTOUNDING TO EVERYONE.

694
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:21,286
IT ALSO CORRECTED A SOUTHERN
MISCONCEPTION WHICH HAD SAID,

695
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,913
"ONE GOOD
SOUTHERN SOLDIER

696
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,915
IS WORTH 10
YANKEE HIRELINGS."

697
00:35:25,082 --> 00:35:27,292
THEY FOUND OUT THAT WASN'T
TRUE BY A LONG SHOT.

698
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,921
IN A PEACH ORCHARD,
THE FEDERALS LAY FLAT

699
00:35:31,088 --> 00:35:32,422
BENEATH
THE BLOSSOMING TREES,

700
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:34,883
FIRING AS THE REBELS CAME,

701
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,969
SOFT PINK PETALS
RAINING DOWN

702
00:35:37,136 --> 00:35:39,388
ON THE LIVING
AND THE DEAD.

703
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:44,935
BY LATE MORNING, THOUSANDS
OF UNTRIED FEDERAL TROOPS

704
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:46,520
HAD SEEN ENOUGH.

705
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,523
MOST DID NOT STOP RUNNING UNTIL
THEY REACHED THE RIVER,

706
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,069
WHERE ALMOST 5,000 MEN
COWERED BENEATH THE BLUFF.

707
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,989
"WE ARE SWEEPING THE FIELD,"
GENERAL JOHNSTON TOLD

708
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,116
HIS SECOND IN COMMAND,
BEAUREGARD,

709
00:35:59,283 --> 00:36:02,411
"AND I THINK WE SHALL
PRESS THEM TO THE RIVER."

710
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,540
GRANT'S BACK
WAS TO THE TENNESSEE.

711
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:10,002
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF BUELL
AND NOWHERE ELSE TO GO,

712
00:36:10,169 --> 00:36:12,588
BUT A THIN FEDERAL LINE
HELD IN THE CENTER,

713
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,174
ILLINOIS AND IOWA
FARM BOYS MOSTLY,

714
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,342
PRONE ALONG
A SUNKEN ROAD.

715
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,595
THEIR COMMANDER,
BENJAMIN PRENTISS,

716
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,388
UNDERSTOOD
THE DEADLY SERIOUSNESS

717
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,183
OF GRANT'S ORDER
TO "MAINTAIN THAT POSITION

718
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,186
AT ALL COSTS."

719
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,105
THE CONFEDERATES LAUNCHED
A DOZEN MASSIVE ASSAULTS

720
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:34,026
AGAINST WHAT BECAME KNOWN
AS THE HORNET'S NEST.

721
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:38,447
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON
HIMSELF LED THE LAST CHARGE.

722
00:36:38,614 --> 00:36:42,826
HE CAME OUT OF IT WITH,
BITS OF HIS CLOTHING NICKED ALL UP.

723
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:45,329
ONE BOOT SOLE
WAS SHOT IN HALF,

724
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,956
AND HE FLAPPED HIS--
ON--ON HORSEBACK THERE,

725
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:50,334
AND SAID, "THEY DIDN'T
TRIP ME UP THAT TIME."

726
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,212
AND VERY SOON AFTER THAT, THEY
SAW HIM REEL IN THE SADDLE

727
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:54,796
AND REALIZED HE WAS HURT,

728
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,340
AND THEN SOMEONE SAID,
"GENERAL, ARE YOU WOUNDED?"

729
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,717
AND HE SAID, "YES,
AND I FEAR SERIOUSLY,"

730
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:01,136
AND HE WAS SHOT
BEHIND THE KNEE--

731
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,222
IN THE FEMORAL ARTERY,
I SUPPOSE-

732
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,431
AND BLED TO DEATH.

733
00:37:04,598 --> 00:37:06,475
THEY SAW BLOOD
COMING OUT OF HIS BOOT,

734
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:09,061
AND HE COULD HAVE BEEN EASILY
SAVED WITH A TOURNIQUET,

735
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:11,939
BUT HE HAD SENT
HIS--HIS SURGEON OFF

736
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:14,733
TO TAKE CARE OF SOME
FEDERAL PRISONERS.

737
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:19,934
"ADVANCING
A LITTLE FURTHER,

738
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,907
"WE SAW GENERAL
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON

739
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,533
"SURROUNDED
BY HIS STAFF.

740
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,535
"WE SAW SOME
LITTLE COMMOTION

741
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,246
"AMONG THOSE WHO
SURROUNDED HIM,

742
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,207
"BUT WE DID NOT KNOW AT THE
TIME THAT HE WAS DEAD.

743
00:37:30,374 --> 00:37:32,751
THE FACT WAS KEPT
FROM THE TROOPS."

744
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,920
SAM WATKINS.

745
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:36,687
THE COMMAND
OF THE WESTERN ARMY

746
00:37:36,713 --> 00:37:39,508
NOW PASSED
TO GENERAL BEAUREGARD.

747
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:42,427
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON
WAS LOOKED ON BY MANY PEOPLE

748
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,429
AT THE TIME OF SHILOH,

749
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,598
AND ESPECIALLY BEFORE
SHILOH WHILE HE WAS

750
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,267
HOLDING THAT LINE
UP IN KENTUCKY,

751
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,811
AS THE SOUTH'S
NUMBER-ONE FIELD SOLDIER.

752
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:52,646
JEFFERSON DAVIS
VIEWED HIM AS THAT,

753
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,564
AND WHEN HE LOST
ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON,

754
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,567
HE SAID, "I REALIZED OUR STRONGEST
PILLAR HAD BEEN BROKEN."

755
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:01,446
MEANWHILE,
THE CENTER OF THE UNION LINE

756
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:02,823
BENT BACK ON ITSELF

757
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,866
BUT WOULD NOT BREAK.

758
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,868
CONFEDERATES
TRAIN ED 62 CANNON

759
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:10,497
AT POINT-BLANK RANGE
AND OPENED FIRE.

760
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:13,000
THE HORNET'S NEST
EXPLODED IN A HAIL

761
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:17,045
OF SPLINTERED TREES
AND SHATTERED MEN.

762
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:20,173
AT 5:30, PRENTISS
AND THE 2,200 SURVIVORS

763
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,801
OF HIS DIVISION SURRENDERED.

764
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,762
THEY HAD HELD UP
THE SOUTHERN ADVANCE

765
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:26,930
FOR NEARLY 6 HOURS,

766
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:29,641
AND IT WAS GROWING DARK.

767
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,060
BEAUREGARD WIRED
JEFFERSON DAVIS

768
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:34,062
THAT HE HAD WON
A COMPLETE VICTORY.

769
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:36,606
"I HAD GENERAL GRANT
JUST WHERE I WANTED HIM,"

770
00:38:36,773 --> 00:38:40,027
HE SAID, "AND COULD FINISH
HIM UP IN THE MORNING."

771
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,703
EVERYWHERE, WOUNDED MEN
LAY IN AGONY.

772
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,747
NEITHER ARMY HAD YET
DEVISED A SYSTEM

773
00:38:51,913 --> 00:38:54,833
FOR GATHERING OR CARING
FOR THEM ON THE FIELD.

774
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,835
SCORES OF WOUNDED
COLLAPSED AND DIED

775
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:59,629
DRINKING FROM A MUD HOLE
NEAR THE PEACH ORCHARD,

776
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:03,300
STAINING THE WATER RED.

777
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:05,302
IT BEGAN TO RAIN,

778
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,720
AND FLASHES OF LIGHTNING

779
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:09,681
SHOWED HOGS FEEDING
ON THE UNGATHERED DEAD.

780
00:39:12,726 --> 00:39:15,062
"SOME CRIED
FOR WATER,

781
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,939
"OTHERS FOR SOMEONE TO
COME AND HELP THEM.

782
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:21,943
"I CAN HEAR THOSE POOR
FELLOWS CRYING FOR WATER.

783
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,654
"GOD HEARD THEM,
FOR THE HEAVENS OPENED

784
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,782
AND THE RAIN CAME."

785
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,745
GRANT SPENT THAT NIGHT
BENEATH A TREE

786
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,081
RATHER THAN LISTEN TO THE
SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED MEN

787
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:36,083
IN HIS HEADQUARTERS.

788
00:39:36,249 --> 00:39:38,710
IT WAS THERE THAT
SHERMAN FOUND HIM.

789
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,379
"WELL, GRANT," HE SAID,

790
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,923
"WE'VE HAD THE DEVIL'S
OWN DAY, HAVEN'T WE?"

791
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:48,053
"YES," SAID GRANT.
"LICK 'EM TOMORROW, THOUGH."

792
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,890
"NEVER TO ME
WAS THE SIGHT

793
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,267
"OF REINFORCING
LEGIONS SO WELCOME

794
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,645
"AS ON THAT SUNDAY
EVENING

795
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,980
"WHEN BUELL'S
ADVANCE COLUMN DEPLOYED

796
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,484
ON THE BLUFFS OF
PITTSBURG LANDING."

797
00:40:02,651 --> 00:40:05,904
DURING THE NIGHT,
BUELL'S ARMY FINALLY ARRIVED.

798
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:10,325
THE UNION MEN MARCHED ASHORE
AS A BAND PLAYED <i>DIXIE.</i>

799
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,997
AT DAWN, THE UNION FORCE,
NOW 70,000 STRONG,

800
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:18,959
DROVE INTO
BEAUREGARD'S 30,000.

801
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,878
THE CONFEDERATES FELL BACK,
COUNTERATTACKED,

802
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,255
FELL BACK AGAIN,

803
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:25,298
AND BEGAN TO WITHDRAW.

804
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:30,303
THE UNION HELD THE FIELD.

805
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:35,183
COVERING
THE CON FEDERATE RETREAT

806
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,185
WAS NATHAN BEDFORD FORREST,

807
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:40,313
WHO NOW TURNED TO LEAD
ONE LAST CAVALRY CHARGE

808
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,316
HEADLONG INTO THE PURSUING
NORTHERN ARMY.

809
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:47,821
AND HE LANDED SQUARE IN THE
MAIN BODY OF THE UNION TROOPS.

810
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:51,700
HE WAS SURROUNDED BY-- ONE
GRAY UNIFORM IN A SEA OF BLUE,

811
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:53,869
AND, THEY BEGAN
TO HOLLER,

812
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,454
"KILL HIM.
KILL THE GODDAMN REBEL.

813
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,456
KNOCK HIM
OFF HIS HORSE,"

814
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,709
AND ONE SOLDIER DID,
STICK HIS, RIFLE OUT

815
00:41:00,876 --> 00:41:03,086
INTO FORREST'S SIDE
AND PULLED THE TRIGGER

816
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,547
AND LIFTED FORREST
CLEAR OF THE SADDLE

817
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,007
WITH THE IMPACT
OF THE BULLET,

818
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:09,342
AND FORREST, MEANTIME,
WAS SLASHING WITH HIS SABER.

819
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:11,636
HIS HORSE WAS KICKING
AND TURNING,

820
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:13,096
AND FORREST SAWED
HIM AROUND

821
00:41:13,263 --> 00:41:14,639
AND GOT HIM CLEAR
AND TOOK OFF,

822
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,086
AND THEY WERE
SHOOTING AFTER HIM,

823
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:17,684
SO HE REACHED DOWN
AND GRABBED ONE UNION SOLDIER

824
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:19,603
AND SWUNG HIM
UP BEHIND HIM

825
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:22,314
ON THE CRUPPER OF THE HORSE
TO USE AS A SHIELD,

826
00:41:22,481 --> 00:41:23,601
AND WHEN HE GOT
OUT OF RANGE,

827
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,150
HE THREW THE MAN OFF
AND RODE BACK

828
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,985
TO JOIN HIS COMMAND.

829
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:29,988
THAT WAS THE LAST SHOT FIRED
IN THE BATTLE OF SHILOH.

830
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:36,661
THE GROUND, GRANT
SAID, WAS SO COVERED WITH DEAD

831
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,914
THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE
TO WALK ACROSS THE CLEARING

832
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,875
IN ANY DIRECTION,
STEPPING ON DEAD BODIES

833
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:44,252
WITHOUT A FOOT
TOUCHING THE GROUND.

834
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,384
"WHEN THE GRAVE
WAS READY,

835
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,804
"WE PLACED THE BODIES
THEREIN, TWO DEEP.

836
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:58,141
"ALL THE MONUMENT REARED
TO THOSE BRAVE MEN WAS A BOARD

837
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,810
"UPON WHICH I CUT
WITH MY POCKET KNIFE

838
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:05,440
THE WORDS <i>125 REBELS."</i>

839
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:16,409
2,477 MEN
WERE KILLED AT SHILOH.

840
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,913
THERE WERE 23,000
CASUALTIES OVERALL--

841
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,915
MORE THAN ALL
THE AMERICAN CASUALTIES

842
00:42:22,082 --> 00:42:25,293
IN ALL PREVIOUS
AMERICAN WARS COMBINED...

843
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,006
AND IT WAS ONLY
THE BEGINNING.

844
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,512
SHILOH HAD THE SAME
NUMBER OF CASUALTIES

845
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,721
AS WATERLOO,

846
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,098
AND YET, WHEN
IT WAS FOUGHT,

847
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:41,518
THERE WERE ANOTHER
20 WATERLOOS TO FOLLOW,

848
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:44,145
AND GRANT, SHORTLY
BEFORE SHILOH, SAID,

849
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:46,106
"I CONSIDER THIS WAR
PRACTICALLY OVER.

850
00:42:46,273 --> 00:42:48,358
THEY'RE READY
TO GIVE UP,"

851
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,402
AND THE DAY AFTER
SHILOH, HE SAID,

852
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:52,779
"I SAW THAT IT WAS GOING TO
HAVE TO BE A WAR OF CONQUEST

853
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,239
IF WE WERE TO WIN."

854
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:56,783
SHILOH DID THAT,

855
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,369
AND IT SOBERED THE NATION
UP SOMETHING AWFUL,

856
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:01,204
THE REALIZATION
THAT THEY HAD

857
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,623
AVERY BLOODY AFFAIR
ON THEIR HANDS,

858
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,709
AND IT CALLED FOR
A HUGE REASSESSMENT

859
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,169
OF WHAT THIS THING
WAS GOING TO BE.

860
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,506
YEARS AFTERWARD,
A UNION VETERAN SAID,

861
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,634
THE MOST A SOLDIER
COULD SAY OF ANY FIGHT WAS,

862
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:18,013
"I WAS WORSE SCARED
THAN I WAS AT SHILOH."

863
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:22,267
"SHILOH"
IS A HEBREW WORD

864
00:43:22,434 --> 00:43:25,061
MEANING
"PLACE OF PEACE."

865
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:34,112
"APRIL 11, 1862.

866
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:38,742
"I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT
BEFORE MANY CENTURIES MORE,

867
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:42,245
"SCIENCE WILL BE
THE MASTER OF MAN.

868
00:43:42,412 --> 00:43:45,040
"THE ENGINES
HE WILL HAVE INVENTED

869
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,668
"WILL BE BEYOND
HIS STRENGTH TO CONTROL.

870
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:52,839
"SOMEDAY, SCIENCE SHALL HAVE
THE EXISTENCE OF MANKIND

871
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,257
"IN ITS POWER,

00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:57,218
"AND THE HUMAN RACE

BY BLOWING UP THE WORLD."

874
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,931
HEN RY ADAMS.

875
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:22,744
THE ARMIES THAT U.S.
GRANT AND GEORGE McCLELLAN LED

876
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,538
WERE THE BEST-EQUIPPED
IN HISTORY.

877
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,124
THE PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY
AND TECHNICAL INGENUITY

878
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:31,211
OF THE NORTH WERE NOW
FOCUSED ON WEAPONS...

879
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,464
AND THE CIVIL WAR
WOULD SEE

880
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,174
THE FIRST
RAILROAD ARTILLERY,

881
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,177
THE FIRST LAND MINES
AND TELESCOPIC SIGHTS,

882
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,514
THE FIRST
MILITARY TELEGRAPHS.

883
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:44,766
IN 1862 ALONE,

884
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:49,604
240 PATENTS WERE ISSUED
FOR MILITARY WEAPONS.

885
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,149
LINCOLN WAS FASCINATED
BY NEW WEAPONRY.

886
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,360
HE PERSONALLY TESTED
NEW RIFLES

887
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:58,530
AND ORDERED UP
10 UNION REPEATING GUNS,

888
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:01,282
FORERUNNERS
OF THE MACHINE GUN,

889
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,951
<i>BUT HE PASSED UP
A SCHEME</i>

890
00:45:03,118 --> 00:45:05,203
<i>TO MANUFACTURE
CANOE-SHAPED FOOTWEAR</i>

891
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,038
FOR WALKING ON WATER,

892
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:10,125
AND TACTFULLY DECLINED
A HERD OF WAR ELEPHANTS

893
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,794
OFFERED BY
THE KING OF SIAM.

894
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:14,796
THEY HAD
MANY CRAZY IDEAS,

895
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,923
ALONG WITH
SOME GOOD ONES.

896
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:20,009
THERE WAS ONE PLAN
TO USE TWO CANNON,

897
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,137
EACH WITH A CANNONBALL

898
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,639
AND THE TWO CANNONBALLS
CONNECTED BY A CHAIN.

899
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:27,058
AND YOU VVOULD FIRE THE TWO
CANNONS AT THE SAME TIME,

900
00:45:27,225 --> 00:45:28,893
AND THE BALLS
WOULD GO OUT,

901
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,520
AND THE CHAIN
BETWEEN THEM

902
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:32,981
VVOULD JUST CUT A SWATH THROUGH
EVERYTHING IN THE WAY.

903
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,524
THE TROUBLE WAS,
ONE CANNON, OF COURSE,

904
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,109
WENT OFF BEFORE
THE OTHER ONE DID

905
00:45:36,276 --> 00:45:38,570
WITH THE RESULT THAT THE
BALL WENT AROUND IN A CIRCLE

906
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:40,280
FROM THE OTHER CANNON.

907
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:45,452
THE MOST IMPORTANT
INNOVATION OF THE WHOLE WAR

908
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:46,995
WAS THE RIFLED MUSKET,

909
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,997
ALONG WITH
A FRENCH REFINEMENT--

910
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:52,000
CAPTAIN CLAUDE MINIE'S
NEW BULLET,

911
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,626
AN INCH-LONG LEAD SLUG

912
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:56,212
THAT EXPANDED INTO
THE BARREL'S RIFLED GROOVES

913
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:59,090
AND SPUN
AS IT LEFT THE MUZZLE.

914
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,885
THE MINIE BALL COULD KILL
AT HALF A MILE

915
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:05,054
AND WAS ACCURATE
AT 250 YARDS--

916
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:08,683
5 TIMES AS FAR
AS ANY OTHER ONE-MAN WEAPON.

917
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:11,936
THE AGE OF THE BAYONET
CHARGE HAD ENDED,

918
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,522
THOUGH MOST OFFICERS
DID NOT YET KNOW IT

919
00:46:14,689 --> 00:46:15,982
WHEN THE WAR BEGAN,

920
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:18,735
AND SOME HAD STILL
NOT LEARNED IT

921
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:21,112
WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER.

922
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:22,864
IT WAS BRUTAL STUFF.

923
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:26,534
THE REASON FOR THE HIGH CASUALTIES
IS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE--

924
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,204
THE WEAPONS WERE WAY
AHEAD OF THE TACTICS.

925
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,955
THE RIFLE ITSELF,

926
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:33,958
IT THREW A .53 CALIBER
SOFT LEAD BULLET

927
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:35,752
AT A LOW
MUZZLE VELOCITY,

928
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:37,462
AND WHEN IT HIT--

929
00:46:37,629 --> 00:46:39,589
THE REASON THERE WERE
SO MANY AMPUTATIONS,

930
00:46:39,756 --> 00:46:43,009
IF YOU GOT HIT HERE,
IT DIDN'T CLIP YOUR BONE

931
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,637
THE WAY THE MODERN
STEEL-JACKETED BULLET DOES.

932
00:46:45,804 --> 00:46:47,931
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY BONE
FROM HERE TO HERE.

933
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,183
THEY HAD NO CHOICE
BUT TO TAKE YOUR ARM OFF,

934
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,560
AND YOU'LL SEE PICTURES
OF THE DEAD ON THE BATTLEFIELD

935
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,145
WITH THEIR CLOTHES
IN DISARRAY

936
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,357
AS IF SOMEONE HAD BEEN
GOING--RIFLING THEIR BODIES.

937
00:46:57,524 --> 00:46:59,859
THAT WAS THE MEN THEMSELVES
TEARING THEIR CLOTHES UP

938
00:47:00,026 --> 00:47:01,528
TO SEE WHERE
THE WOUND WAS,

939
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,946
AND THEY KNEW
PERFECTLY WELL

940
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,989
IF THEY WERE
GUT SHOT, THEY'D DIE.

UNION VICTORY AT SHILOH

958
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,455

959
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:58,042
GRANT'S SUPERIOR WAS
GENERAL HENRY WAGER HALLECK,

960

A CALCULATING
ADMINISTRATOR

961
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:01,963
WHO WAS JEALOUS
OF GRANT'S SUCCESS

962
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,216
AND ANXIOUS TO GET RID
OF HIS CHIEF RIVAL.

963

OF FORT DONELSON,

964
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:11,681
HE SPREAD RUMORS

965
00:48:11,848 --> 00:48:14,475
AFTER THE FEARFUL
LOSSES AT SHILOH,

966
00:48:14,642 --> 00:48:16,895
HE HAD GRANT REASSIGNED.

967
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,234
GRANT DECIDED TO QUIT,

968
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,236
BUT HIS FRIEND
WILLIAM TECUMSEH SHERMAN

969
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,863
TALKED HIM OUT OF IT.

970
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,407
"YOU COULD NOT BE QUIET
AT HOME FOR A WEEK,"

971
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,993
HE SAID, "WHEN ARMIES
ARE MOVING."

972
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,996
GRANT AND SHERMAN
WERE BOTH OHIO BOYS

973
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:37,457
AND WEST POINTERS
WHO WERE FOND OF CIGARS,

974
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:39,250
SCORN ED
POMP AND POLITICS,

975
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,961
AND HAD FARED POORLY
IN CIVILIAN LIFE.

976
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,298
GRANT ENJOYED SHERMAN'S
RAPID-FIRE BRILLIANCE

977
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:47,050
AND WAS GRATEFUL
FOR THE DISPATCH

978

979

IN THE MIDST OF CRISIS,

981

"SIMPLE FAITH IN SUCCESS."

982
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:04,067
THEY TRUSTED EACH OTHER.

00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:34,071
TO HAUL THEM UP

1181
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:36,448
ALONG HASTILY CONSTRUCTED
TIMBER HIGHWAYS

1182
00:59:36,615 --> 00:59:38,492
CALLED "COR-DU-ROI" ROADS.

1183
00:59:41,203 --> 00:59:43,581
MCCLELLAN
FINALLY DECIDED TO ACT

1184
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,427
AND CAREFULLY PLANNED
A MASSIVE BOMBARDMENT

1185
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,126
FOR MAY 5,

1186
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:49,670
BUT ON THE NIGHT OF THE 3rd,

1187
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:51,839
GENERAL MAGRUDER'S
CONFEDERATE BATTERIES

1188
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:55,175
SUDDENLY INTENSIFIED
THEIR FIRE.

1189
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:59,346
MCCLELLAN BRACED
FOR AN ATTACK,

1190
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:03,225
BUT THE NEXT MORNING,
THE CONFEDERATES HAD VANISHED.

1191
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,104
DISBELIEVING
FEDERAL TROOPS

1192
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:10,899
EDGED INTO THE DESERTED
SOUTHERN CAMPS.

1193
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:15,779
MAGRUDER HAD PACKED UP
HIS SHOW AND MOVED ON,

1194
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:20,117
BUT McCLELLAN DECLARED IT
A UNION VICTORY.

1195
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,077
"THE SUCCESS
IS BRILLIANT,

1196
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,704
"AND YOU MAY REST ASSURED

1197
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:26,665
"THAT ITS EFFECTS WILL BE
OF THE GREATEST IMPORTANCE.

1198
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:28,459
"THERE SHALL
BE NO DELAY

1199
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:31,337
IN FOLLOWING UP
THE REBELS."

1200
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:36,884
THE UNION MEN
NOW CAUTIOUSLY

1201
01:00:37,051 --> 01:00:40,012
FOLLOWED THE REBEL ARMY WEST
TOWARDS RICHMOND.

1202
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:44,391
"MAY 20.

1203
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,019
"RICHMOND IS
JUST 9 MILES OFF.

1204
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:49,855
"THE NEGROES ARE
DELIGHTED TO SEE US,

1205
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,023
"BUT THE WHITES LOOK

1206
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:53,442
AS IF THEY WOULD
LIKE TO KILL US."

1207
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:56,945
ELISHA HUNT RHODES.

1208
01:01:04,828 --> 01:01:06,246
FROM McCLELLAN'S LINES,

1209
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:08,707
YOU COULD HEAR THE BELLS
OF RICHMOND TOLLING.

1210
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,084
YOU COULD HEAR

1211
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,086
THE CHURCH BELLS IN
THE PUBLIC CLOCK STRIKING,

1212
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:14,213
HE WAS THAT CLOSE.

1213
01:01:15,798 --> 01:01:17,841
A WORRIED
JEFFERSON DAVIS NOW PREPARED

1214
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,927
FOR A SIEGE OF RICHMOND,

1215
01:01:20,094 --> 01:01:21,762
RELYING MORE AND MORE
ON THE ADVICE

1216
01:01:21,929 --> 01:01:25,224
OF HIS CLOSE MILITARY
ADVISOR ROBERT E. LEE.

1217
01:01:25,391 --> 01:01:27,976
WHEN DAVIS ASKED
WHERE LEE THOUGHT

1218
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:30,771
THE SOUTH'S NEXT DEFENSIVE
LINE SHOULD BE DRAWN

1219
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,356
ONCE RICHMOND FELL,

1220
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:35,526
LEE SAID,
"RICHMOND MUST NOT FALL.

1221
01:01:35,693 --> 01:01:38,195
IT SHALL NOT BE GIVEN UP."

1222
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:44,284
STILL, GEORGE MCCLELLAN
REFUSED TO ATTACK.

1223
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,211
THOUGH HIS ARMY STILL
OUTNUMBERED THE REBELS,

1224
01:01:46,245 --> 01:01:49,248
HE REMAINED CONVINCED
THE OPPOSITE WAS TRUE.

1225
01:01:49,415 --> 01:01:51,500
ONE OBSERVER NOTED

1226
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:54,086
THAT MCCLELLAN
HAD A PARTICULAR FACULTY

1227
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:57,089
FOR "REALIZING
HALLUCINATIONS."

1228
01:01:58,674 --> 01:02:02,511
HE DEMANDED
ANOTHER 40,000 MEN.

1229
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:04,138
"IF HE HAD
A MILLION MEN,

1230
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:06,265
"HE WOULD SWEAR
THE ENEMY HAD TWO MILLIONS,

1231
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,142
"AND THEN HE WOULD
SIT DOWN IN THE MUD

1232
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,144
AND YELL FOR 3."

1233
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:11,937
EDWIN M. STANTON.

1234
01:02:21,530 --> 01:02:23,198
WITH THE YEAR HALF GONE,

1235
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:27,035
THE UNION'S GRAND STRATEGY
HAD STALLED.

1236
01:02:27,202 --> 01:02:30,873
THE WESTERN CAMPAIGN
BEGUN BY U.S. GRANT

1237
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,626
HAD GROUND TO A HALT
IN NORTH MISSISSIPPI,

1238
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,004
AND McCLELLAN'S MIGHTY FORCES

1239
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:40,215
WERE PARALYZED
IN FRONT OF RICHMOND.

1240
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:43,385
THERE WAS WORSE TO COME.

1241
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,596
THE KILLING THAT WOULD
SOON BREAK OUT IN VIRGINIA

1242
01:02:45,763 --> 01:02:47,222
WOULD CONTINUE ALL YEAR

1243
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:49,224
AND COME TO A CLIMAX

1244
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:52,227
ALONG A TINY CREEK
IN WESTERN MARYLAND

1245
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,896
CALLED THE ANTIETAM.

1246
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,156
"WE TALK OF
THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT

1247
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:07,576
"AND PRACTICALLY
GIVE THE LIE TO OUR TALK.

1248
01:03:07,743 --> 01:03:10,412
"WE WAGE WAR AGAINST
SLAVEHOLDING REBELS

1249
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,623
"AND YET PROTECT
AND AUGMENT THE MOTIVE

1250
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:15,626
"WHICH HAS MOVED THE
SLAVEHOLDERS TO REBELLION.

1251
01:03:15,793 --> 01:03:17,795
"WE STRIKE
AT THE EFFECT

1252
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:21,298
"AND LEAVE
THE CAUSE UNHARMED.

1253
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:24,134
"FIRE WILL NOT
BURN IT OUT OF US,

1254
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,303
"WATER CANNOT
WASH IT OUT OF US,

1255
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:28,305
"THAT THIS WAR
WITH THE SLAVEHOLDERS

1256
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:31,141
"CAN NEVER BE BROUGHT
TO A DESIRABLE TERMINATION

1257
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,518
"UNTIL SLAVERY,

1258
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,104
"THE GUILTY CAUSE OF
ALL OUR NATIONAL TROUBLES,

1259
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:40,067
HAS BEEN TOTALLY
AND FOREVER ABOLISHED."

1260
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:42,236
FREDERICK DOUGLASS.
