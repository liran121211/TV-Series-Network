1
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:27,691
Larry, it's Leon!

2
00:00:34,524 --> 00:00:35,816
The fuck?

3
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:40,439
What's going on, man?

4
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,940
It's fucking crazy
in this fucking room.

5
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:45,773
What are these motherfucking
shades, man?

6
00:00:45,774 --> 00:00:47,981
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:47,982 --> 00:00:50,147
You need sunlight, man.
You turning white.

8
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:53,731
- The fuck is going on?
- What are you doing?

9
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:55,981
What? I'm in a hotel.

10
00:00:55,982 --> 00:00:57,523
You think you're
safe in a hotel?

11
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,856
I think I'm safer here
than in my house.

12
00:00:58,857 --> 00:00:59,981
The bottom line is this, Larry...

13
00:00:59,982 --> 00:01:01,606
you can't fucking hide here.

14
00:01:01,607 --> 00:01:03,690
These motherfuckers want you,
they're gonna come and get you.

15
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:05,690
Cut your fucking hands off,
cut your feet off,

16
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,898
put your feet in
your back pockets,

17
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,189
put your hands in
your front pockets,

18
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,481
and then carry your
ass out of here

19
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:10,648
like a piecem of
fucking luggage.

20
00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:12,022
How are you helping?

21
00:01:12,023 --> 00:01:13,398
I'm just letting him
know what happens.

22
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:14,690
You don't need this shit.

23
00:01:14,691 --> 00:01:16,064
You go to your house.
No one's coming.

24
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:18,856
I talked to the FBI guy.
He's not gonna lie.

25
00:01:18,857 --> 00:01:20,189
No one is coming.

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,898
But I can't go
back to the house.

27
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:25,356
I gotta move or sell
the house or something.

28
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:27,648
No, no, no, no. You can't
fucking sell the house.

29
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:29,272
All of my ladies know
I live there already.

30
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:30,898
You're gonna set me back
two or three years.

31
00:01:30,899 --> 00:01:33,022
No, fucking stay there.
You fucking stay.

32
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:37,690
Get back to your life.
Get back on the horse now!

33
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,732
- Okay, give me two minutes.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:42,691
- Proud of ya.
- My man.

35
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:08,773
Ah.

36
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:11,064
I was there first.
I should've got that.

37
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:13,898
I was too busy looking in
the mirror 'cause I'm so vain.

38
00:02:13,899 --> 00:02:15,898
It's no big deal. I got it.

39
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:17,398
Thank you, thank you.

40
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:19,481
Well, look at you.

41
00:02:19,482 --> 00:02:21,564
Look at me.

42
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:22,941
May I ask you a question?

43
00:02:24,107 --> 00:02:26,981
- Sure.
- Why this outfit?

44
00:02:26,982 --> 00:02:29,815
It seems that women
in your profession,

45
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,940
they... they dress like this
for some reason.

46
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:34,815
Why not look wholesome?
Why double down on the seediness?

47
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:36,773
I think I look really good.

48
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:38,439
- Mm. Mm.
- No?

49
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,439
Mm, I mean, look at dentists.

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,690
They don't walk around
with their smocks on

51
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:44,773
when they're not in...
when they're not in their office.

52
00:02:44,774 --> 00:02:46,614
This is a hooker smock
is what you got on.

53
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:47,815
I'm a hooker.

54
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:50,106
I know, but you don't
have to show everybody.

55
00:02:50,107 --> 00:02:52,648
- I don't?
- No! People like a mystery.

56
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:57,147
Imagine putting on a beautiful dress
from Saks Fifth Avenue, you know?

57
00:02:57,148 --> 00:03:00,106
All right, well, first of all,
I'm... I'm not able to afford

58
00:03:00,107 --> 00:03:03,231
a dress from Saks Fifth Avenue,
so that's not gonna happen.

59
00:03:03,232 --> 00:03:05,106
You're not able
to afford it now,

60
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:09,314
but get one dress and I
guarantee you in six months,

61
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:13,815
your closet will be packed
with dresses like that.

62
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:15,356
Really?

63
00:03:15,357 --> 00:03:17,231
Absolutely.

64
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:19,564
Okay, so I'm gonna
put the tits away.

65
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:21,022
Yeah, put...
put the tits away.

66
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:22,272
- Animal prints gone.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:24,147
- No more hooker boots.
- None. Zero.

68
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:26,314
- Fishnets, out of here.
- Out.

69
00:03:26,315 --> 00:03:29,064
- I think I could do this.
- I think business is gonna boom.

70
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:31,064
- I really do.
- Thank you so much.

71
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,147
- Oh, well...
- Oh.

72
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:36,731
I... I'm so thrilled about
this whole thing. Good luck!

73
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:38,481
Good luck!
You can do it!

74
00:03:38,482 --> 00:03:40,564
- Hi.
- Hi.

75
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,606
I'm checking out a lot earlier
than I had anticipated.

76
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:46,022
- Oh, we hate to see you go.
- Okay, 1003.

77
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:48,815
1003. And what is
the name on 1003?

78
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:50,649
Buck Dancer.

79
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,439
Uh, okay, Mr. Dancer,
let me just bring that up.

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,940
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

81
00:03:56,941 --> 00:03:58,940
Mm, yeah, yeah, it was fine.
It was fine.

82
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:00,606
Okay, well, be sure
to visit our website.

83
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,856
You can always give us some
feedback. We love notes.

84
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:04,523
- Don't tuck in.
- The sheets?

85
00:04:04,524 --> 00:04:06,064
- Don't tuck in?
- Yeah, don't... don't tuck in.

86
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:07,898
- Too tight for you?
- Who sleeps like that?

87
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,523
It's suffocating.

88
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:11,648
- You're right.
- It's absolutely suffocating.

89
00:04:11,649 --> 00:04:13,940
Don't tuck. I will take that
note on advisement.

90
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,314
Those cookies,
those are for guests?

91
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:18,231
Oh, absolutely, yes.
We have a wonderful pastry chef.

92
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:19,815
- Let me know if you need a box.
- Thank you.

93
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,189
Ah, I see you went for the
big ones, Mr. Dancer, right?

94
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,230
Yes, yes, I got the first.

95
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:42,231
Oh, good, good for you.
They're delicious.

96
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:43,940
Uh, just, if I may,

97
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:47,731
we ask that people use the tongs
when selecting their cookies.

98
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:50,272
Tongs? Yes, yes,
I saw the tongs there.

99
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:52,773
I eschewed the tongs
deliberately

100
00:04:52,774 --> 00:04:55,856
because the tongs are not
made for picking up cookies.

101
00:04:55,857 --> 00:04:57,773
They... they crumble
the cookie.

102
00:04:57,774 --> 00:04:59,564
It's not a good system,
the tong.

103
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:02,356
Uh, we just ask, you know,
that you use the tongs,

104
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:03,815
which we sort of
provide there on the plate,

105
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,356
you know, just for
sanitary reasons.

106
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:06,898
Here, look,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

107
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,898
I'll take my second cookie
with the tongs...

108
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:10,731
- Thank you.
- ...all right?

109
00:05:10,732 --> 00:05:12,774
Perfect. Great.

110
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,606
Seem to be making
a moment of it,

111
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,272
- but I'll let you have it.
- I wasn't making a moment.

112
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:19,940
It's just it's hard to hold it.

113
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:22,272
Let me ask you this question...

114
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:23,606
who put you in charge
of the cookies?

115
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:24,731
Do you oversee the cookies?

116
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,231
I was given explicit
instructions

117
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:28,648
to look over the lobby,
which is my jurisdiction.

118
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,564
So, yes, I oversee the cookies.

119
00:05:30,565 --> 00:05:34,106
Okay, I... I don't think this
is within your jurisdiction.

120
00:05:34,107 --> 00:05:35,815
Well, uh, Mr. Dancer,

121
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:39,064
I have enjoyed spending
so much time with you,

122
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:41,314
and thank you for
all your wonderful notes,

123
00:05:41,315 --> 00:05:44,231
and, uh, we hope
to see you again.

124
00:05:44,232 --> 00:05:46,606
You say the pastry chef
made these?

125
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,606
Oh, yes. They're wonderful.

126
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:50,439
I got news for you, pal.

127
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,022
This is a Pepperidge
Farm cookie.

128
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:53,481
- Okay?
- I...

129
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:55,022
This is a Pepperidge Farm
cookie, that's it.

130
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,147
Well, I will go to
that pastry chef

131
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,398
and I will confront
him about it.

132
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,731
Don't tell people these are

133
00:05:58,732 --> 00:05:59,981
home-made cookies
by a pastry chef.

134
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:02,189
- Okay, no, I...
- Okay.

135
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,231
- I wouldn't and I didn't.
- This is a Pepperidge Farm cookie.

136
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:05,981
I don't believe those are
Pepperidge Farm cookies.

137
00:06:05,982 --> 00:06:07,147
This is a Pepperidge
Farm cookie.

138
00:06:07,148 --> 00:06:08,356
All right,
Mr. Dancer, well,

139
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:10,356
I will take that into account...

140
00:06:10,357 --> 00:06:12,448
I'm a little disappointed.
I could buy this in the grocery store

141
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:14,048
on my way home, so.

142
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:14,605
Okay.

143
00:06:14,606 --> 00:06:16,606
But anyway, you're putting
out Pepperidge Farm.

144
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,523
- Fine, great, okay.
- Okay, great. Thank you so much.

145
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:23,273
Linda, can we get these cookies
out of the way that he touched?

146
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,481
I don't want you to use these
doors anymore. You got that?

147
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:32,148
- They call this shit "overreacting."
- Is the alarm working?

148
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:35,481
You should worry about
that goddamn fireplace.

149
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:37,314
You're gonna fuck
around and forget,

150
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,314
and Fatwa Claus gonna come down that
fucking chimney and kill your ass.

151
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:41,940
What is this shit?
What are you eating?

152
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:43,940
- Beef sticks.
- Beef stick?

153
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:45,314
You know how bad
that is for you?

154
00:06:45,315 --> 00:06:46,690
Have you ever read
the ingredients?

155
00:06:46,691 --> 00:06:48,481
Have you ever tried
one of these motherfuckers?

156
00:06:48,482 --> 00:06:50,022
- They're fucking delicious.
- They're disgusting.

157
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,523
Look, beef, of course,

158
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:54,314
molasses, wheat, brown sugar.

159
00:06:54,315 --> 00:06:56,356
Brown fucking sugar.
I love fucking brown sugar.

160
00:06:56,357 --> 00:06:59,648
You think black people prefer
brown sugar over white sugar?

161
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,690
Absolutely. Anything brown
over fucking white.

162
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:04,564
- Pants?
- Of fucking course.

163
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,898
Fuck. Okay, get the door.

164
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,106
- Give me this thing.
- Don't you... don't you bitch up.

165
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:13,356
Ask who it is. Don't forget.

166
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:15,649
I'll answer the door.

167
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,022
- Funkhouser.
- Oh.

168
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:22,231
- Hi. Kenny.
- What's up, Kenny?

169
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:23,731
- Hi, Leon. How you doing?
- Hey, man.

170
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,398
Hey, Funk-man.

171
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,481
LD, come down here.

172
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:30,064
- To what do I owe the honor?
- My nephew, Kenny.

173
00:07:30,065 --> 00:07:32,064
- Kenny, hi. Larry. Hi.
- Pleasure to meet you.

174
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:34,298
The jewel of the Funkhouser
family tree.

175
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:35,398
Is that so?

176
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,690
- That is so.
- Huh, how about that.

177
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:40,439
- Straight-A student, okay?
- Mm.

178
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,648
Member of six clubs
in high school...

179
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:43,981
runs them all.

180
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:48,064
He was just voted high school
All-American pitcher.

181
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:49,398
- All right.
- One-of-a-kind.

182
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,106
- Okay. Yeah.
- Now, wait a minute!

183
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:53,564
If he nails his SATs,
which he will...

184
00:07:53,565 --> 00:07:54,622
Mm-hmm.

185
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,022
...he's going to Stanford
on a full scholarship.

186
00:07:57,023 --> 00:08:00,356
I don't wanna be a hater, but can't
nobody do all that shit in one day.

187
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:02,898
Well, I mean,
I just work hard and...

188
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,898
I'm saying you're making it feel like this
motherfucker's Forrest Gump or something.

189
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:08,731
- You ever see that movie?
- Yeah, I've seen "Forrest Gump."

190
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,356
That motherfucker lived a life.

191
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,898
I mean, I'm not... I'm not
running across the country.

192
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,398
- You ever see a titty?
- What's the matter with you?

193
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,773
What kind of a question is that?

194
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:19,564
Anyway, so, uh,
thanks for stopping by.

195
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,272
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

196
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:24,064
We... we were just about to eat,
so I'll see you, uh...

197
00:08:24,065 --> 00:08:26,439
- I'd love a sandwich.
- Me, too.

198
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,398
- I'm starved.
- I don't wanna impose, though.

199
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,815
We got a lot of meats, man.
All kind of shits in that fridge.

200
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:32,064
- Let's do it.
- Yeah!

201
00:08:32,065 --> 00:08:33,523
- Come on.
- Oh, thank you.

202
00:08:33,524 --> 00:08:35,690
You like bologna and shit?

203
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,439
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- You couldn't...

204
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,272
- let me tell you something.
- This kid's a pitcher?

205
00:08:39,273 --> 00:08:40,481
Let's get off that.

206
00:08:40,482 --> 00:08:41,940
Looks like he can't
lift a chess piece.

207
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:43,731
Yeah, you'd have
a good time hitting him.

208
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,314
Here, try that mustard.
It's dope.

209
00:08:46,315 --> 00:08:48,231
Larry has all kind
of goodies in here.

210
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:50,523
All kind of cheeses and meats.

211
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:52,481
- What are you making?
- Sandwiches, baby.

212
00:08:52,482 --> 00:08:55,648
- Who wants a pickle?
- Pickles! I want pickles.

213
00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:57,301
You can't have a sandwich
without pickles, right?

214
00:08:57,302 --> 00:08:57,961
No!

215
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,231
- Tap it, tap it.
- Yeah.

216
00:09:01,232 --> 00:09:03,398
Do you need any help?
I got it, I got it.

217
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:05,815
Everybody's gotta be
the hero with a pickle jar.

218
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,314
Everybody
wants to open it.

219
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:09,648
You just gotta
hit it up.

220
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,022
- Here, give it to the big Funk.
- No, little Funk's got it, okay?

221
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:14,940
- Come on, let me take a shot at it.
- No.

222
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:16,481
- What are you doing, Kenny?
- No, I got it!

223
00:09:16,482 --> 00:09:18,481
- Kenny, give me the jar!
- I got it. Ooh! Oh!

224
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,314
- Shit.
- What happened?

225
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:22,356
- I think I heard it crack.
- Your pitching arm?

226
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:24,022
- Yeah, that's my pitching arm.
- Oh, my God.

227
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,106
We gotta go to the hospital.

228
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,398
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!
- Oh, shut up.

229
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,606
It was an accident!

230
00:09:29,607 --> 00:09:31,606
I never should've brought
him over here!

231
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:34,022
He tried to open the pickles,
so he took the jar from him,

232
00:09:34,023 --> 00:09:37,523
- and you tried to get it from him, too!
- You're trying to do too much.

233
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:39,398
Valedictorian, now you
wanna be pickle boy.

234
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,565
- You're doing too much!
- Sorry!

235
00:09:45,565 --> 00:09:48,357
You know, I think we have a
half open jar in the fridge.

236
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:54,606
What do you know?

237
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:55,731
What do you know?

238
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,189
Oh, darling,
you're cold. Here.

239
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,899
- Here, put this around you.
- I'm just excited.

240
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,439
Well, that's what
they want me to do.

241
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,773
- I've got a ticket here...
- What's up, Larry?

242
00:10:11,774 --> 00:10:13,940
Yeah.

243
00:10:13,941 --> 00:10:16,606
I had a horrible
night last night.

244
00:10:16,607 --> 00:10:18,147
Horrible.

245
00:10:18,148 --> 00:10:20,231
I couldn't sleep,
was up all night.

246
00:10:20,232 --> 00:10:23,064
I heard... I heard
someone at the gate.

247
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:28,272
I heard voices and somebody
creeping around the house.

248
00:10:28,273 --> 00:10:30,231
It, like, freaked me out.

249
00:10:30,232 --> 00:10:32,564
Well, you know what? There was a
lot of shit going on last night.

250
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:34,272
I had a little lady
friend come over.

251
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:37,147
You know, her girlfriend's
waiting outside in the car,

252
00:10:37,148 --> 00:10:39,981
the kid's in the back seat,
jumping around and shit.

253
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:41,731
You know?

254
00:10:41,732 --> 00:10:43,648
And then I had the pizza guy
come over. He came over...

255
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,648
Okay, so... so it was you.
So you kept me up, essentially.

256
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:49,231
I didn't keep you up.
Just some normal shit that I do.

257
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,773
I need some...
I need some security in the house.

258
00:10:52,774 --> 00:10:55,981
You know, like a... I gotta hire,
like, a Pinkerton guard or something.

259
00:10:55,982 --> 00:10:57,940
You don't need no
Pinkerton guard.

260
00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,981
You know what?
I'll tell you what.

261
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:02,356
- Let me handle this shit.
- You're... you're gonna hire somebody?

262
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:04,439
- What are you gonna do?
- What if I get somebody half the price

263
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,439
of that Pinkerton motherfucker?

264
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,272
I'm gonna take care of all this security
shit you're worried about, okay?

265
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:12,106
I'm gonna get you...
get you back to being Larry.

266
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:15,398
Sitting around here,
looking all frumpy and shit.

267
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:17,773
Well, no, the only reason
I'm wearing this bathrobe

268
00:11:17,774 --> 00:11:19,856
is because I left
my pajama bottoms...

269
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:21,314
you know, those
red flannel pajamas?

270
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:23,314
- Right.
- I left them at the hotel.

271
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,648
I can't leave a hotel room
without leaving something behind.

272
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,690
Never fails.

273
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:30,189
- Oh.
- Are you expecting somebody?

274
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,690
I'm always expecting somebody.

275
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,773
If they show the fuck up,
they show the fuck up.

276
00:11:33,774 --> 00:11:36,189
Goodbye, darling.

277
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,314
- Excuse me a minute.
- He's all right, you know.

278
00:11:38,315 --> 00:11:40,648
- He's gonna be all right.
- Hey!

279
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:42,481
- He's alive!
- Oh!

280
00:11:42,482 --> 00:11:44,231
- Hey, buddy.
- How you doing?

281
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:45,856
I'm all right.
How are you doing?

282
00:11:45,857 --> 00:11:48,314
Oh, God, I'm a mess.

283
00:11:48,315 --> 00:11:50,481
- Yeah, so bad.
- I'd be terrified.

284
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:52,731
Yeah, and the worst part
is the musical's off.

285
00:11:52,732 --> 00:11:54,564
- Oh, you're kidding me.
- No.

286
00:11:54,565 --> 00:11:56,481
It was such a funny idea.

287
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,481
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

288
00:11:58,482 --> 00:12:00,690
- Um...
- Nice of you to come over, though,

289
00:12:00,691 --> 00:12:02,314
and, uh, say hi.

290
00:12:02,315 --> 00:12:04,189
- That's really sweet of you.
- No.

291
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,815
I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

292
00:12:05,816 --> 00:12:06,940
Yeah, you're welcome.

293
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:09,815
Um, actually, you know what?

294
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,815
All right, I'm full of shit.

295
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,189
The truth is I'm here to ask...

296
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:19,524
I'm here to ask your permission
if I can date Cheryl.

297
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:22,856
Boom.

298
00:12:24,315 --> 00:12:26,189
- Wow.
- Wow?

299
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,314
Yeah, you come over here
under these false pretenses

300
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,690
to, oh... to see how I'm doing,

301
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:34,523
and... and you
wanna date... no!

302
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:36,147
No, I... no, no, I...

303
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:39,356
if you're asking me can you
date Cheryl, I'd say no.

304
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:41,189
Let... let's just
step back just a second.

305
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,314
This is a surprise to me, too.

306
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:46,398
We're friends. I didn't wanna
sneak around behind your back.

307
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,022
I need to, like...
to go with my impulses,

308
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:53,856
and my impulse is I wanna...
I wanna go out with your ex-wife.

309
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,815
How would you like it
if I went out with Mary, huh?

310
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,356
- Would you like that?
- Don't be stupid.

311
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:58,690
What does that mean?

312
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:00,523
It means you're...

313
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:04,690
you wanna call my ex-wife,
Mary Steenburgen...

314
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:07,523
Larry David wants to ask
Mary Steenburgen out?

315
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:08,523
Oh.

316
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:12,815
Oh, Larry David is not cool
enough for Mary Steenburgen?

317
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:15,856
- I... I just...
- Huh? But Ted Danson is? Is that it?

318
00:13:15,857 --> 00:13:19,231
I didn't say that,
but there's something in there.

319
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,898
Oh, okay, all right.

320
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:22,815
You know what? I'll call
her right now. How's that?

321
00:13:22,816 --> 00:13:24,690
How's that? I'll call Mary.

322
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:26,481
- Fine.
- Okay? Okay?

323
00:13:26,482 --> 00:13:28,189
You want me to?

324
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,648
- Do it.
- Okay.

325
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:32,399
But then can we get back
to this real subject?

326
00:13:34,232 --> 00:13:35,856
Mary!

327
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,356
- I can't believe it.
- Hey, it's Larry David.

328
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:40,189
- Hi, Larry!
- Hey!

329
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,940
- How you doing?
- Good, good.

330
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:44,898
Hey, Mar, um, let...
let me ask you something.

331
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:47,773
You know what's going on
with Ted and Cheryl?

332
00:13:47,774 --> 00:13:51,648
Ted told me he was
interested in seeing her

333
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,648
and I told him to go for it.

334
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,398
Well, um...

335
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,773
I was kind of
wondering...

336
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:03,022
...you know, if he's gonna
go out with her,

337
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:06,439
why, uh... why don't
you go out with me?

338
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,606
Wow, Lar.

339
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,272
Oh, my gosh.

340
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:15,147
Um, I just...

341
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:17,106
God, I love you so much.

342
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,648
I don't know if we have anything
in common that way, you know?

343
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:23,314
- Do you think?
- Well, we're both people.

344
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,648
We're Earthlings,
we breathe, we eat,

345
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:27,648
so we have...
we have that in common.

346
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:30,606
Yeah, we have that in common
with pretty much everybody,

347
00:14:30,607 --> 00:14:33,564
but I was... I was just
meaning, like, you know,

348
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:37,022
maybe you're just not
my physical type.

349
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:39,856
Sure. Sure, I understand.

350
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:43,272
Hope we can have lunch
or go shopping

351
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:45,314
or do something
together soon.

352
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:47,774
- Okay, okay. Okay, bye.
- Bye, Lar.

353
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,981
- What'd she say?
- No.

354
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:55,981
- Mm.
- Not really her type.

355
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,607
- Huh.
- At least, physically.

356
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,690
- Okay. Well, hey...
- Yeah.

357
00:15:01,691 --> 00:15:04,648
- So, you gonna go ahead with this?
- Yeah, yeah.

358
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:05,672
Okay.

359
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:08,272
You should know that she
doesn't give blow jobs.

360
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:10,439
- Just...
- That's okay.

361
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,147
Okay? Sex only in the dark.

362
00:15:12,148 --> 00:15:13,898
She's a little revolted
by the penis.

363
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:15,648
- Really?
- She won't look at it.

364
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,022
- She won't even touch it, okay?
- Well, maybe that's changed.

365
00:15:18,023 --> 00:15:20,648
- It won't change, okay?
- All right, good luck with the fatwa.

366
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,023
Yeah, thanks. Thanks for
being so concerned about it.

367
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:57,564
- You're in trouble, Larry.
- Yeah. Yeah!

368
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:58,732
I know. Tell me about it.

369
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:01,481
- I like that.
- Oh, yeah?

370
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:03,314
Yeah, hides the Jew.

371
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:04,940
Ah, thank you.

372
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:06,981
Thank you. That's lovely.

373
00:16:06,982 --> 00:16:09,147
Lovely compliment.
Thank you very much.

374
00:16:09,148 --> 00:16:11,106
- Very sweet.
- What are you doing here, Larry?

375
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,231
- Huh?
- Well, you know...

376
00:16:13,232 --> 00:16:14,232
What?

377
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:15,398
...this has been very,
very difficult for me.

378
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,731
And I'm thinking, who can help me?
I don't know any Muslims.

379
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:20,981
They're not in show business.
They don't hang out at the deli.

380
00:16:20,982 --> 00:16:24,106
Am I supposed to go into a mosque
and then start chatting them up?

381
00:16:24,107 --> 00:16:26,314
Sure, maybe I can make a little
more effort to seek them out,

382
00:16:26,315 --> 00:16:27,940
but they're not really
coming up to me either!

383
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:30,107
Do you need my help, Larry?

384
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:34,106
Yes.

385
00:16:34,107 --> 00:16:34,941
Yes.

386
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:38,773
- I know people.
- You do?

387
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:42,189
- Mm, I know people.
- Imams, mufti?

388
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,981
- "Moofti."
- "Moofti"?

389
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:45,940
- "Moofti."
- It's "moofti." Huh.

390
00:16:45,941 --> 00:16:47,272
I always thought
it was "muffti."

391
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:51,981
Anyway, so do you know a mufti?

392
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:54,106
- I know other people.
- Who? Who do you know?

393
00:16:54,107 --> 00:16:55,399
I know the consul of Iran.

394
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:58,607
You know the consul?

395
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:01,481
- Is that so?
- Yes.

396
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,856
Look at you!
You are really something!

397
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,314
- Eh.
- How do you know the consul?

398
00:17:06,315 --> 00:17:08,147
I have my connections.

399
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:11,481
Are you a...
are you a plotter?

400
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:13,231
Are you one of the plotters?

401
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:16,815
- Do you plot?
- I've plotted before.

402
00:17:16,816 --> 00:17:18,981
- You've plotted?
- I've plotted.

403
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:19,857
Wow.

404
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:22,982
You're on my side, right?

405
00:17:27,148 --> 00:17:28,898
Fuck me, you godless fuck!

406
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:30,648
You infidel fucking Jew!

407
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,356
Try and keep it kosher,
could you?

408
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:34,981
You fatwa fucking bastard!

409
00:17:34,982 --> 00:17:38,314
- I'm a fatwa fuck.
- Yes! Talk dirty to me, Larry.

410
00:17:38,315 --> 00:17:41,815
Blaspheme to me like you
blasphemed to the Nation of Islam!

411
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:44,106
Donald Trump!

412
00:17:44,107 --> 00:17:45,314
Steve Bannon!

413
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,690
Jared Kushner!

414
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,106
Mike Pence!

415
00:17:48,107 --> 00:17:49,940
Kellyanne Conway!

416
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:51,523
- Mitch McConnell!
- Yeah!

417
00:17:51,524 --> 00:17:54,523
Rudy Giuliani!

418
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:56,147
Yeah, yeah!

419
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:57,815
Rougher, Larry! Rougher!

420
00:17:57,816 --> 00:17:59,481
- Sentence me to an orgasm...
- You're choking me!

421
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,356
...like you've been
sentenced to death!

422
00:18:01,357 --> 00:18:03,106
Is this a fatwa!

423
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:06,564
This is a fatwa!
Fa-fa-fa-fatwa!

424
00:18:06,565 --> 00:18:08,856
Fatwa! Fatwa!

425
00:18:08,857 --> 00:18:10,690
Hey! Hey!

426
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,773
No fatwa up in here! No fatwa!

427
00:18:12,774 --> 00:18:14,272
- What?
- No fatwa!

428
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:15,856
Yeah, Larry, that's Swat,
your knew security.

429
00:18:15,857 --> 00:18:17,106
You can thank me later
for that shit.

430
00:18:17,107 --> 00:18:18,523
Yeah, I'm not even
gonna bring up

431
00:18:18,524 --> 00:18:20,314
the fact you're fucking
in your goddamn glasses.

432
00:18:20,315 --> 00:18:22,023
Hey, Swat, break
her ass in half!

433
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:29,231
Hello, is this...
is this Mr. Khashayar?

434
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:30,564
Yes, this is he.

435
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,564
Yeah, this is, um...
this is Larry David.

436
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:35,189
I'm a friend
of Shara Ghorbani.

437
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:38,815
She said that perhaps
there might be a way,

438
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:41,314
you know, to set up
a, uh... a meeting.

439
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:44,648
It's better if you don't come
here under the circumstances...

440
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:45,647
Hey, Larry.

441
00:18:48,148 --> 00:18:50,147
Shut the fuck up!
I'm on the phone.

442
00:18:50,148 --> 00:18:53,064
Hey, I'm gonna give Swat the
guest room. Where the towels at?

443
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,564
They're down the hall
in the linen closet.

444
00:18:55,565 --> 00:18:57,064
Yes, I'm sorry.

445
00:18:57,065 --> 00:19:00,064
I have two nincompoops
in my house, unfortunately.

446
00:19:00,065 --> 00:19:02,898
- Anyway, so, um...
- I would suggest a video conference.

447
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:05,022
- Oh.
- I can arrange for that if you like.

448
00:19:05,023 --> 00:19:06,231
Oh, you wanna
set up a video call?

449
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:08,314
Yeah, the video call
would work great.

450
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,439
- Yes, excellent.
- Yeah.

451
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,564
Good. I will have one of my staff
members contact you to arrange for it.

452
00:19:13,565 --> 00:19:14,815
- Yeah, I...
- Hey, Larry!

453
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:16,481
Wait, I'm sorry.
Hold on one more sec.

454
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:18,898
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Shh, I'm on the phone!

455
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,940
This goddamn towel's
hard as fuck, man.

456
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:23,064
Shut the fuck up!
I'm on the phone!

457
00:19:23,065 --> 00:19:24,773
I'll be there in a second.
Shut up!

458
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:26,022
These towels too rough, man.

459
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:28,606
- I like a softer towel.
- Hey, Swat? Swat?

460
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:29,773
Shut up!

461
00:19:29,774 --> 00:19:31,314
Yeah, I'm sorry.

462
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:33,439
No, it's the nincompoops again.

463
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,106
- Nincompoops?
- I'll wait to hear from your office.

464
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:38,564
- Larry!
- As I said, they will be in contact.

465
00:19:38,565 --> 00:19:41,898
Yes, all right, thank you.
- Goodbye, Mr. David.

466
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:45,648
What's so important about
these fucking towels?

467
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,731
Look, these towels are
a little too rough, man.

468
00:19:47,732 --> 00:19:48,940
I like a soft towel, Lar.

469
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:50,398
He wants something
more velvety.

470
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,481
Velvet, it doesn't even
dry you, velvet.

471
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,398
It doesn't...
it doesn't get the water off.

472
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:57,231
A harder, coarser towel works
a lot better for drying.

473
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:59,815
If I don't use something velvety,
I'ma get ashy as hell, Lar.

474
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:01,444
You want me to go
shopping for towels?

475
00:20:01,445 --> 00:20:02,314
It'd be nice.

476
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:04,481
The man's a guest in your house.
He's your fucking security.

477
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,481
- He's gonna take care of you.
- By the way,

478
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:08,481
you need to familiarize
yourself with that.

479
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:10,648
- What? What is this?
- It's a list.

480
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:13,523
- Persimmons. You eat persimmons?
- Antioxidants.

481
00:20:13,524 --> 00:20:15,606
No stone fruit?

482
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:16,981
I'm telling you,
they kill me, Larry.

483
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:18,981
I'll drop dead right on
this fucking carpet.

484
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:21,231
Even the "oals"
will fuck me up.

485
00:20:21,232 --> 00:20:24,189
- Even the what?
- The "oals" from the fruit will fuck me up.

486
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,815
If this fucking man even
sees a fucking stone fruit,

487
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:29,815
he's gonna eat the shit, so don't bring
no stone fruit in the fucking house.

488
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:31,482
So now I can't have stone fruit?

489
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,148
Yeah.

490
00:20:40,023 --> 00:20:41,564
Absolutely, we will
send that right up.

491
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:42,731
All right,
thank you very much.

492
00:20:42,732 --> 00:20:45,189
- Hello.
- Ah, Mr. Dancer.

493
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,356
I'm sorry to report that I
left a pair of pajama bottoms

494
00:20:49,357 --> 00:20:51,690
in my room, which was 1003.

495
00:20:51,691 --> 00:20:55,189
- So, just pajama bottoms?
- Fantastic pajamas, by the way.

496
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,189
- I don't doubt it.
- I mean, the best feature about them

497
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:00,356
is that the flannel's thick,
so they obfuscate the penis,

498
00:21:00,357 --> 00:21:03,106
so you could walk around
with other people in the house

499
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:04,523
and you don't see any flopping,

500
00:21:04,524 --> 00:21:06,815
as opposed to the pair
that I have now,

501
00:21:06,816 --> 00:21:08,439
my... my second pair.

502
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,022
- Okay.
- A little thinner.

503
00:21:10,023 --> 00:21:12,731
You see the clear outline of
the penis... very unpleasant.

504
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:15,257
I will check in the back and
I will be right with you.

505
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:16,557
Thank you very much.

506
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:24,231
Excuse me.

507
00:21:24,232 --> 00:21:26,064
Hi.

508
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:28,940
Are you in charge
of the... the cookies?

509
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:30,773
Um, yeah, I guess so.

510
00:21:30,774 --> 00:21:33,231
So you oversee the
whole cookie operation?

511
00:21:33,232 --> 00:21:35,564
Uh, I don't bake them,
but I...

512
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:37,690
Well, they're not baked,
they're bought in a store.

513
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,064
But that's neither
here nor there.

514
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:40,940
Let me just ask you
about the display here.

515
00:21:40,941 --> 00:21:43,022
- Okay.
- Was this whole idea yours...

516
00:21:43,023 --> 00:21:45,773
the display, the tongs,
the whole thing?

517
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:47,523
- Um...
- 'Cause I have to tell you,

518
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,189
the tong is not a
friend of the cookie

519
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,856
by any stretch
of the imagination.

520
00:21:50,857 --> 00:21:53,272
Okay, you must be
Mr. Dancer.

521
00:21:53,273 --> 00:21:55,398
- Yes! Yes.
- Yes.

522
00:21:55,399 --> 00:21:56,773
- I am.
- Okay.

523
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,898
What I believe you
should be thinking about

524
00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:00,606
is separating the cookies

525
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:03,564
so people can use their
fingers and not the tongs.

526
00:22:03,565 --> 00:22:05,398
No friend of the cookie.

527
00:22:05,399 --> 00:22:07,106
May I just demonstrate
what I'm talking about?

528
00:22:07,107 --> 00:22:09,272
- No, sir, please don't.
- Just watch how easy this is.

529
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:11,606
- It's hotel policy.
- You see how easy I picked that out?

530
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:13,648
- It was so simple.
- Mr. Dancer.

531
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:16,189
I successfully was able
to find your pajama bottoms,

532
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,106
and I see that you are not
using our tongs again.

533
00:22:18,107 --> 00:22:20,106
No, I was just merely
demonstrating something...

534
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:22,439
- I asked him to use the tongs.
- I know you did, Claudia.

535
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,122
Thank you very much.

536
00:22:23,123 --> 00:22:25,022
And by the way, you're not even
in charge of the cookies.

537
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:28,856
- Claudia is.
- I asked you to please follow our policy,

538
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:31,856
and you are no longer a guest here,
actually, so I'm just now asking you

539
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:34,439
- to just respect that.
- Ah, what?

540
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,648
What?

541
00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:37,106
Oh, my God!

542
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,481
The tongs dropped on the floor,

543
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,314
you put them back on the table?

544
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:41,940
- I wiped them.
- She wiped them.

545
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:43,856
That's like eating
off the floor!

546
00:22:43,857 --> 00:22:45,773
- It's the same thing!
- It's not at all the same.

547
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:48,481
It is the same thing! You might as
well put the floor on the table!

548
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:50,564
- Okay, you know what?
- This is a disgrace!

549
00:22:50,565 --> 00:22:51,898
Okay, you know
what is a disgrace,

550
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:53,398
that we're having
this conversation again.

551
00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:55,481
And here is what I'm gonna
say to you right now...

552
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:57,773
don't ever return to this hotel...
I'm serious, or I will call the cops.

553
00:22:57,774 --> 00:23:00,314
Like I would wanna return to a hotel
that's serving Pepperidge Farm cookies

554
00:23:00,315 --> 00:23:03,231
and trying to pass them off
as if you have a pastry chef!

555
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:06,981
Fine, and if you do, I will
call the police, Mr. Buck Dancer.

556
00:23:06,982 --> 00:23:08,981
Kenny was a perfect kid,

557
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:11,231
and look what's happened here!

558
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,648
Look what's happened
to my jewel,

559
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:17,064
my nephew, who is
an all-star pitcher.

560
00:23:17,065 --> 00:23:19,272
He's up there now in a cast!

561
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,147
Why did you have to
fight him for the pickle?

562
00:23:22,148 --> 00:23:24,648
Why did I have to fight him?
You fought him for the pickles, too!

563
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,356
I didn't fight him;
I let it go!

564
00:23:26,357 --> 00:23:27,398
Oh, you let it go.

565
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:28,940
You tried to open
that pickle jar

566
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:30,064
just like I did!

567
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:31,815
Everybody wants to be
a pickle jar hero.

568
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,773
You broke his elbow, okay?

569
00:23:33,774 --> 00:23:34,981
Are you happy?

570
00:23:34,982 --> 00:23:36,606
He's just a different kid.

571
00:23:36,607 --> 00:23:38,690
His personality has changed.

572
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:40,564
He's filled with angst.

573
00:23:40,565 --> 00:23:42,314
He's, like, ready to explode.

574
00:23:42,315 --> 00:23:43,773
And you wanna know why?

575
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:48,022
The way he relaxes is
the way all men relax.

576
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:50,523
It's called "ejaculation."

577
00:23:50,524 --> 00:23:53,064
He can't use the
right hand, okay?

578
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:55,773
This is his ejaculator, okay?

579
00:23:55,774 --> 00:23:57,523
It's done, it's in a cast.

580
00:23:57,524 --> 00:24:00,189
- Yeah.
- Mr. Kenny, some lunch!

581
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,481
What the hell is
this shit? Fuck!

582
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:05,523
You call this lunch? Take your
banana and shove it up your ass!

583
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:07,731
- Get out! Get the fuck out!
- Señor, he's crazy!

584
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:09,606
Leave me the fuck alone!

585
00:24:09,607 --> 00:24:11,564
I don't even know him anymore.

586
00:24:11,565 --> 00:24:13,731
- Wow.
- I'm scared to death of him.

587
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:15,773
He can't masturbate.

588
00:24:15,774 --> 00:24:17,523
He can't make it come out.

589
00:24:17,524 --> 00:24:20,189
- He can't go left?
- No, he can't go to his left.

590
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,106
- Can you go to your left?
- Eh, nobody can.

591
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:23,773
- No one can.
- Yeah.

592
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:26,064
It's funny, though, there's
other things I can do lefty.

593
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,606
I can eat lefty,
I can brush my teeth lefty.

594
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:31,064
There's a big difference.

595
00:24:31,065 --> 00:24:34,314
You need rotation,
you need tempo,

596
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:36,064
you need feel.

597
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,398
I don't know what's gonna happen

598
00:24:37,399 --> 00:24:39,314
'cause he can't
concentrate anymore.

599
00:24:39,315 --> 00:24:42,898
He told me today he doesn't
give a shit about the SATs.

600
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:45,022
He doesn't care about Stanford.

601
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,106
He doesn't care about anything.

602
00:24:47,107 --> 00:24:49,648
- Wow.
- He's lost his will.

603
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:51,232
Hey!

604
00:24:54,023 --> 00:24:58,648
I met this woman
in the... in the hotel,

605
00:24:58,649 --> 00:25:02,356
and I think... I think
she could help him.

606
00:25:02,357 --> 00:25:03,606
What does she do?

607
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:06,606
She's a...
she's a prostitute.

608
00:25:10,107 --> 00:25:12,690
Okay, here's the deal.

609
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:15,064
You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna go to the right,

610
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:17,106
- near the front desk.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:25:17,107 --> 00:25:19,048
You're gonna try and open
this jar of pickles.

612
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:19,648
Okay.

613
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:22,940
It's gonna create a diversion, everybody's
gonna come over and try and help,

614
00:25:22,941 --> 00:25:25,648
and then I'm gonna sneak in
so the guy doesn't see me

615
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,898
- and try and find Paula, okay?
- Right, right, right.

616
00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:30,147
This is called
the "pickle gambit."

617
00:25:30,148 --> 00:25:32,189
I like that, man.
Hey, it's cool.

618
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:35,147
- What's my name?
- All right, that's irrelevant.

619
00:25:35,148 --> 00:25:36,564
- Okay?
- What do you mean it's irrelevant?

620
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:38,064
- Okay, you want a name?
- I want a fucking name!

621
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:40,564
Okay, uh, Chick Gandil,
that's your name.

622
00:25:40,565 --> 00:25:42,940
He played first base
for the 1919 White Sox,

623
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,690
the team that threw
the World Series.

624
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:47,022
Wait a fucking minute. I'm not
gonna be on no goddamn White Sox.

625
00:25:47,023 --> 00:25:49,481
Would you prefer somebody
from the Negro leagues?

626
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:51,648
Yeah, give me a fucking name.

627
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:54,898
- Chappie Johnson.
- That's a black man's name right there.

628
00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:56,314
That's fucking great.
I love it.

629
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:57,648
- All right.
- I can do that shit.

630
00:25:57,649 --> 00:25:58,856
- Okay, get in there.
- I got you.

631
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,147
Okay, I'm a...
I'm a diversion.

632
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:03,107
I got you. I fucking got you,
Lar, all right?

633
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:11,564
My name is Chappie Johnson

634
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:14,106
and I can't open
this damn pickle jar.

635
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:16,022
- Let me take a crack at that.
- I can help you with that.

636
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:17,856
I'm gonna have to put you
on hold for a second.

637
00:26:17,857 --> 00:26:19,773
Give it here, Chappie.
Give me a shot at it.

638
00:26:19,774 --> 00:26:21,022
Guys, I saw from over there.

639
00:26:21,023 --> 00:26:22,356
Let me just get a run
at it, all right?

640
00:26:22,357 --> 00:26:23,690
I'm small,
but you'd be surprised.

641
00:26:27,816 --> 00:26:30,189
Let me see that,
let me see that.

642
00:26:32,232 --> 00:26:33,648
Just try it again.

643
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:35,022
Put force into it.

644
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:36,648
- I didn't...
- I got it, I got it.

645
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:37,815
I didn't get a good run at it.

646
00:26:37,816 --> 00:26:38,899
Come on!

647
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,064
Larry, it's me.

648
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:52,314
Oh, my God.

649
00:26:52,315 --> 00:26:55,147
Oh, my God!

650
00:26:55,148 --> 00:26:57,815
- Look at you.
- Do you like it?

651
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,189
I... I'm stunned!

652
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,690
This is... I...
my mind's exploding!

653
00:27:03,691 --> 00:27:05,481
- Oh, my gosh.
- This is incredible.

654
00:27:05,482 --> 00:27:07,815
- Look at you. Look at you!
- Oh, really?

655
00:27:07,816 --> 00:27:09,231
- Ugh!
- You think so?

656
00:27:09,232 --> 00:27:10,815
Well, I am so happy,

657
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,189
and I owe it all to you.

658
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:14,064
- It worked.
- It worked.

659
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,064
It worked.
My life has been changed.

660
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:17,272
Business...
never been better.

661
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:19,648
The men...
gentle, respectful.

662
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:22,356
I did a hooker mitzvah!
It's a hooker mitzvah!

663
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:23,815
You are a visionary.

664
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:27,106
I don't know what I can do
to properly show my thanks.

665
00:27:27,107 --> 00:27:28,606
You don't have to do anything.

666
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:30,898
The mere fact that
you're happier having sex

667
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,523
with a multitude of strangers,

668
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:35,439
that's all... that's all
the thanks I need.

669
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,856
Aw, Larry!

670
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,648
That's awesome. Thank you!

671
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:41,648
You know what? This is
unbelievable that I actually ran...

672
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:43,773
I came here specifically
looking for you.

673
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:45,439
- Oh, you did?
- Yes, I did.

674
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,690
- Oh, that's amazing!
- Yeah, because I actually do

675
00:27:47,691 --> 00:27:48,815
- need your services.
- You do?

676
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:50,439
- Yes.
- Okay, well, fine.

677
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,940
It's for... it's for
my friend's nephew.

678
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,231
- His name is Kenny Funkhouser.
- Of course!

679
00:27:55,232 --> 00:27:57,106
Tell me when and where.
I'll be there.

680
00:27:57,107 --> 00:27:59,439
- No problem.
- Fanta...

681
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,147
- I feel great, I feel great.
- Hey, do you want a drink?

682
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:02,981
- Just a quick drink?
- Uh, no, let's get a, uh...

683
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:05,773
let's raid the minibar
like normal people.

684
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:11,481
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

685
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,189
Yes.

686
00:28:16,982 --> 00:28:18,690
Here, give it to me,
give it to me!

687
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:20,189
You can't open it!

688
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,940
We need to get a butter knife.

689
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:23,564
- Come on, let me give it another try.
- No.

690
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:28,523
We need a plier,
we need a plier.

691
00:28:28,524 --> 00:28:31,690
But a hatchet will
shatter the entire jar.

692
00:28:31,691 --> 00:28:33,356
- Get a plier.
- She can't open it.

693
00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:35,272
- What, 'cause I'm a woman?
- Yeah, exactly!

694
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,314
- We need one more shot.
- Give me that!

695
00:28:38,315 --> 00:28:40,189
Mr. Dancer!

696
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,272
Whoa!

697
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:44,022
- Huh?
- Wow.

698
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:45,815
- Yeah!
- Wow, are you serious?

699
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:47,523
Are you for...
Claudia, get security.

700
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:49,272
I'll keep Mr. Buck Dancer here.

701
00:28:49,273 --> 00:28:50,690
Okay? No, I gotta get...

702
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:52,398
I don't care, I don't care.

703
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,314
I'm not touching cookies,
I'm not talking tongs!

704
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,648
I don't care! I warned you if you
came back here, this would happen.

705
00:28:56,649 --> 00:28:58,481
- Get out of my way, baldy!
- Ah-ah!

706
00:28:58,482 --> 00:29:01,231
- That is it, sir. You are out of here.
- Unhand me, you brute!

707
00:29:01,232 --> 00:29:02,315
I have dementia!

708
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:15,691
What the...?

709
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:20,022
Unbelievable!

710
00:29:20,023 --> 00:29:22,314
- As often as I can.
- Really?

711
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:23,356
- Yes...
- No.

712
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,398
- So, are you nervous?
- A little.

713
00:29:37,399 --> 00:29:39,564
Oh, well, don't worry.
I'll take care of everything.

714
00:29:39,565 --> 00:29:41,564
- You just lay back and relax.
- Okay.

715
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:43,898
I like your dress.

716
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:46,731
Aw, thanks!
I got it at Saks Fifth Avenue.

717
00:29:46,732 --> 00:29:49,064
- Oh, that... that's a nice store.
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:51,022
Take your clothes off, Kenny.

719
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,564
You know, Mary,
she's with this guy,

720
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:54,773
he's bald with glasses...
he looks just like me!

721
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:57,064
She said I wasn't her type.

722
00:29:57,065 --> 00:29:59,898
Unbelievable. And now Ted...

723
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:02,231
Ted's going out with Cheryl.

724
00:30:02,232 --> 00:30:03,423
What about that?

725
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:06,523
Well, you haven't been married
to her in a long time.

726
00:30:06,524 --> 00:30:07,773
There's nothing wrong
with that!

727
00:30:07,774 --> 00:30:09,398
Would you do
something like that?

728
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:11,648
You wanna go out with Cheryl,
you do it behind my back.

729
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:13,648
- You'd never know.
- That's the way to do it.

730
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:15,691
Yeah. I called Cheryl.

731
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,940
- I called her twice.
- For what?

732
00:30:18,941 --> 00:30:21,106
Just to talk to her and
see how she was doing,

733
00:30:21,107 --> 00:30:24,106
and shopping tips
and stuff like that.

734
00:30:24,107 --> 00:30:26,272
- We had a cup of coffee.
- You're kidding.

735
00:30:26,273 --> 00:30:28,940
- Two movies.
- What?

736
00:30:28,941 --> 00:30:30,439
A walk in the park.

737
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,690
Yeah, well,
it's not a big deal.

738
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:33,690
One dinner.

739
00:30:33,691 --> 00:30:35,064
I went behind your back!

740
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:36,940
It's the only way to go!

741
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:38,690
Yeah, that's true.

742
00:30:38,691 --> 00:30:42,523
Boy, Kenny sounds like
he's having some fun.

743
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,106
Tough to listen to, though.

744
00:30:44,107 --> 00:30:45,898
Oh, my God.

745
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:50,607
Oh, I got a... I got a Skype thing
with the Iranian consul guy.

746
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:53,022
I'll see you later.

747
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:54,941
I'm not staying here by myself.

748
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:04,523
Mr. David, at last we meet
face to face.

749
00:31:04,524 --> 00:31:06,564
Heh-hey! Hey, look at this!

750
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,314
Modern technology, sir.

751
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:11,231
What... what exactly does
a consul do? It's a...

752
00:31:11,232 --> 00:31:13,981
Let's just say if you wanted to
come to Iran one day and visit,

753
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:15,898
you would be going
through myself.

754
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:18,314
I'm not setting foot in that
place, with all due respect.

755
00:31:18,315 --> 00:31:19,941
Not gonna set foot there.

756
00:31:21,148 --> 00:31:22,774
Excuse me.

757
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,690
- What is that?
- A cookie.

758
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:28,731
What are you using, tongs?

759
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:30,815
Yes. We use tongs.

760
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:34,314
- In fact, we invented the tong.
- Okay.

761
00:31:34,315 --> 00:31:36,147
All right, Mr. Consul,

762
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:38,022
let's, uh... let's not
go crazy here.

763
00:31:38,023 --> 00:31:39,981
You invented the tong.
I don't think so.

764
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,606
I don't see Iran
as the tong inventor.

765
00:31:42,607 --> 00:31:44,773
Mr. David, I have a
very busy agenda today.

766
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:46,523
Please let me know
how I can help you.

767
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:50,272
Well, um, you're aware
of my situation, of course,

768
00:31:50,273 --> 00:31:53,731
and I was hoping beyond hope

769
00:31:53,732 --> 00:31:57,731
that somehow you could perhaps

770
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:00,981
put in a good word for me,

771
00:32:00,982 --> 00:32:04,523
tell the ayatollah
how profoundly sorry I am

772
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:06,564
for what I did and said and...

773
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:09,398
Mr. David, you have come
to the right person

774
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:11,981
because... I tell you this
in confidence...

775
00:32:11,982 --> 00:32:14,272
I am a huge fan of your work.

776
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:17,189
I have watched every
episode of "Seinfeld."

777
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:22,147
This is... this is
really, truly remarkable.

778
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,231
Is that so?
What's your favorite episode?

779
00:32:25,732 --> 00:32:28,106
Isn't everybody's favorite
episode the puffy shirt?

780
00:32:28,107 --> 00:32:29,564
It's unbelievable!

781
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:31,856
I also love the one
with the close talker.

782
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:33,272
Ugh, oh, my God!

783
00:32:33,273 --> 00:32:35,773
I must tell you
something, Mr. David.

784
00:32:35,774 --> 00:32:39,189
The ayatollah himself
is a bit of a close talker.

785
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,022
- Is that so?
- Yes!

786
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:43,648
Oh, I wouldn't wanna get too close
to that guy, to tell you the truth.

787
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:45,231
It doesn't look like
he's popping Life Savers

788
00:32:45,232 --> 00:32:47,022
in his mouth all
day long, you know?

789
00:32:47,023 --> 00:32:48,815
Ah, yes, well...

790
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,648
- Okay.
- All right.

791
00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:52,022
Okay, oh, yeah!

792
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:53,231
Come on. Come on, honey!

793
00:32:53,232 --> 00:32:54,856
You can do it, you can do it!

794
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:56,481
Come on, come on!

795
00:32:56,482 --> 00:32:58,981
I'm coming, Larry!

796
00:32:58,982 --> 00:33:00,856
Oh, God, you're so good!

797
00:33:00,857 --> 00:33:02,731
Larry!

798
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,648
I am very confident that we can

799
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,773
accomplish something
here together.

800
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:09,356
Thank you so much.
I'm so appreciative and...

801
00:33:09,357 --> 00:33:11,815
Uncle Marty, Uncle Marty!

802
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:13,439
What the... oh!

803
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,606
Oh, my God!

804
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:16,272
- Oh, no!
- What is that?

805
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:17,773
Oh, oh! No!

806
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:20,439
No, no! Swat, Swat!
Not her, not her!

807
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Just get rid of the Muslims!

808
00:33:24,023 --> 00:33:27,106
No... it's a game!

809
00:33:27,107 --> 00:33:30,673
That's a game! Mr. Consul!
Nooooo!
