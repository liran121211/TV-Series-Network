1
00:00:14,508 --> 00:00:16,340
Oh, shoot. Here we go.

2
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:19,173
- Good morning, Mr. David.
- Good morning, Sal.

3
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:20,924
- What a great day for golf, huh?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:23,173
And it's happening, Mr. David.

5
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:25,090
- Oh, yeah?
- It's happening.

6
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,507
- Oh.
- Right over at Will Rogers Park.

7
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:29,507
There's going to be
a reenactment

8
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:31,007
of the Revolutionary War,

9
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:33,048
which I partake in
every year.

10
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:35,632
You would not believe
some of the people they have.

11
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:37,298
- No kidding, yeah.
- I'm going to be a redcoat.

12
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,507
Interesting. You're going
to be in the British army?

13
00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:41,298
I don't have a great
British accent,

14
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:42,723
but tell me if you think
this one works.

15
00:00:42,724 --> 00:00:43,424
Yeah. Okay.

16
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:45,090
I'm thinking of two
different kinds.

17
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:46,674
Tell me which one
you like better.

18
00:00:46,675 --> 00:00:48,841
"Oi, is that...
move that gun over here...

19
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:50,882
- ...and get ready. We're going."
- Yeah. Yeah.

20
00:00:50,883 --> 00:00:52,882
- That's kind of a... a Cockney.
- That's Cockney, yeah.

21
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,549
But I don't know
if that's what they do.

22
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,048
I think, more often,
it's a... they...

23
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,173
"Gentlemen, strike the
flagstaff deep, Sir Knight."

24
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:01,882
Well, they're both pretty good.

25
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:04,882
They're good, so I...
it's gonna be a remarkable day for me.

26
00:01:04,883 --> 00:01:08,048
Get in there and play some great
golf today, okay, Mr. David?

27
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:10,382
Oh, sir, you may find
the main lot full.

28
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:12,590
- Okay.
- Okay? You may find it full.

29
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:14,340
- You can...
- I got it, yeah.

30
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:15,966
You can... if you like,

31
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,841
you can just take...
make a right over here.

32
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:19,340
Right turn, got it.

33
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:21,048
- Okay, yeah.
- Go to the bottom of the hill.

34
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,132
- I think you'll find some open.
- Okay, yeah.

35
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:25,340
Have a great day.

36
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,883
Fairways and greens,
Mr. David. Don't forget.

37
00:01:29,675 --> 00:01:31,424
So, every time I come in,

38
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,090
it's a whole conversation.

39
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:35,098
The worst mistake I ever made
was rolling down that window,

40
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,799
in the first place.
Just to be nice!

41
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,590
And it's been going on
for months and months.

42
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:42,507
And now, I'm in this
cycle that never ends.

43
00:01:42,508 --> 00:01:45,549
Once the window goes down,
it cannot go back up.

44
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,924
- That's right.
- You are stuck.

45
00:01:46,925 --> 00:01:49,257
I'm the only one in the club
who talks to this guy.

46
00:01:49,258 --> 00:01:50,924
I guarantee you.
Do you talk to him?

47
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:53,090
Not for nine months.
He's annoying as hell.

48
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:54,841
I really would love to reset
the whole relationship

49
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:58,090
so I could just drive up,
wave, and be on my way.

50
00:01:58,091 --> 00:01:59,674
I think it's a big
bowl of too late.

51
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:01,090
You're on your own.

52
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:03,048
Secretly,

53
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:05,590
I wish ill things on him so I
don't have to do this anymore.

54
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,507
It's a terrible thought,
but that's what I think.

55
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:10,007
By the way, where's
my John Adams biography?

56
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,841
I lent it to you
about six weeks ago.

57
00:02:11,842 --> 00:02:13,298
Yeah, so sorry.

58
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,424
For what reason
do you want it back?

59
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:15,799
Just to what,
to impress people?

60
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,173
Well, I impressed myself first
that I finished it.

61
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:19,966
- It's a big book. It's a fat book.
- Did you?

62
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,298
- Yes.
- Did you finish it?

63
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:22,882
Of course I finished it.

64
00:02:22,883 --> 00:02:24,924
- Really?
- Yeah.

65
00:02:24,925 --> 00:02:27,048
- It was fantastic.
- It was, huh?

66
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:29,298
- Who knew about all this stuff?
- Yeah.

67
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:31,298
Thomas Jefferson,
and the arguing,

68
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,465
- and the White House, and...
- I'm gonna posit this.

69
00:02:34,466 --> 00:02:36,173
I don't think you read it
in the first place.

70
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:39,340
- What is this, "Dragnet"?
- I don't think you read it.

71
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:41,549
- I read the inside flap.
- Okay, you read the flap.

72
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,841
- Good, you read the flap.
- I'll make sure he gets it back to you.

73
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:46,507
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

74
00:02:46,508 --> 00:02:48,298
I see you've had a chance
to take a look at the menu.

75
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,132
We do have one addition today.

76
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:54,007
It is a Dover sole sautéed
in a lemon butter sauce.

77
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:55,008
What are you getting?

78
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:57,841
I'm gonna get the beet
and goat cheese salad.

79
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:00,590
- The Vietnamese pho.
- How do they prepare the Dover sole?

80
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:03,590
- What did you say, sautéed?
- It's sautéed in a lemon butter sauce.

81
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:06,132
- Do you think they would broil it?
- I could ask.

82
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:10,340
Okay, look, ask, but if the chef
makes a face of any kind, okay,

83
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,424
just tell him
to forget it and sauté it.

84
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,132
- I understand.
- Okay, thank you.

85
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,257
Okay.

86
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,507
Thanks.

87
00:03:16,508 --> 00:03:17,841
I cannot stay long.

88
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:21,298
I have to go suit shopping
with my daughter

89
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,882
and my soon-to-be son-in-law
for the wedding.

90
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:27,132
Yeah, his daughter Sammi's
getting married.

91
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:29,007
You're kidding me.
Congratulations.

92
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,841
- What kind of guy is he?
- He served in the war in Afghanistan.

93
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:34,632
- And, uh...
- Wow.

94
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:36,298
- Yeah.
- Is he okay?

95
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,090
No PTSD. He's one
of the lucky ones.

96
00:03:38,091 --> 00:03:40,173
I asked the chef
to broil the sole,

97
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:42,048
and he didn't make
much of a face.

98
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,549
Didn't make much of a face.

99
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,340
What kind of face is
not much of a face?

100
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,007
Well, he can be
a bit inscrutable,

101
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:50,007
but I wouldn't describe it
as much of a face at all.

102
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:51,924
Hmm. I'd like to see that face.

103
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:53,340
What did...
show it to me.

104
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,799
I asked the chef if he
could broil the sole,

105
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,215
and he went...

106
00:03:58,216 --> 00:04:00,048
Like that?

107
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,048
Well, that's not
much of a face.

108
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:04,716
- No.
- Okay.

109
00:04:04,717 --> 00:04:08,048
- I'll get it... I'll get it broiled.
- All right.

110
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:10,382
- Hey, guys.
- All right, thank you so much.

111
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,716
- Hey, Larry. Hold on.
- Okay.

112
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:14,382
- How are you, Larry?
- Hey, Ken.

113
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:15,549
- How you doing?
- Good.

114
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,590
- Hey, Ken.
- How are you guys?

115
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:17,757
His wife just had a baby.

116
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,173
- Oh, the baby!
- Yeah.

117
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:21,424
- You got a picture?
- Boom. There you go.

118
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:24,090
Wow! Oh! Beautiful!

119
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:25,424
- Huh?
- Lucky man.

120
00:04:25,425 --> 00:04:27,257
- Thank you so much.
- Ah.

121
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:29,298
My greatest treasure.

122
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:31,675
You know, she looks
a little Asian.

123
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:37,257
Um, wha-what do you...
what does that mean?

124
00:04:37,258 --> 00:04:40,799
She has a look...
a little Asian look about her.

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,090
That's... that's weird.
It's a strange thing to say, Larry.

126
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:46,757
- Why? What's the big deal?
- What are you getting at, is all I'm asking.

127
00:04:46,758 --> 00:04:48,172
'Cause most people would
just say, first,

128
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,373
- she's beautiful.
- I'm not getting at anything...

129
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:52,382
I'm saying that, you know, she
just has a slight Asian look to her.

130
00:04:52,383 --> 00:04:54,757
I feel like you're maybe
saying something's...

131
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,257
something's off about her.

132
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:58,340
I'm not saying...
something's on about it.

133
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,590
It's good.
It's a good thing.

134
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:00,757
- Uh-huh.
- That's a compliment.

135
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,173
- In what way?
- Huge.

136
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:03,716
- How so?
- She's exotic.

137
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:05,632
I... I wish I looked
a little Asian.

138
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:06,841
Look, I just wanna walk away.

139
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:08,465
Can you just...
just take it back

140
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,465
so we can just
put this behind us?

141
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,424
I can apologize
for offending you,

142
00:05:12,425 --> 00:05:14,090
but I can't take
back the remark.

143
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:18,298
I just want you to say,
"This was my fault. I apologize."

144
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:19,465
And then I can move on.

145
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,007
It's my fault for offending you.

146
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:23,465
I apologize. But she does
look a little Asian.

147
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,298
Okay, goodbye.

148
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,007
- We all think she's gorgeous.
- I'm... I'm sorry, Ken.

149
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:29,090
I'm sorry. It's a cute baby,

150
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:31,298
but she does look a little... you
didn't think she looked a little Asian?

151
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,216
She looked a little Asian.

152
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:43,173
- Who's there?
- U.S. Postal Service.

153
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:48,549
Mr. David? I need a signature.

154
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,090
Are you, uh...
are you the new mailman?

155
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:53,966
- Mailwoman?
- Mail carrier.

156
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,842
- Huh, okay. Mail carrier.
- Yeah.

157
00:05:58,216 --> 00:06:00,841
Great. I will take this.

158
00:06:00,842 --> 00:06:03,298
- You will take these.
- All right. Okay.

159
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:04,924
And I will take my pen.

160
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:06,507
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

161
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,841
- People, they steal pens a lot.
- They really do, don't they?

162
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:11,090
- I bet you lose a lot of those...
- I have a truck full of 'em.

163
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,924
I haven't talked
to a mailman in a long...

164
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:15,674
mail carrier in a long time.

165
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,882
I remember in my building
in Brooklyn growing up,

166
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:20,257
the women, they used to
flirt with the mailmen.

167
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:22,382
They'd come down in the
morning with their shmatas.

168
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,215
- You know, it was...
- What's a shmata?

169
00:06:24,216 --> 00:06:26,632
A shm... it's a... like,
a disgusting house dress.

170
00:06:26,633 --> 00:06:28,215
- It's... they're hideous.
- Oh, boy. Oh.

171
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:29,799
You know, my mother
used to encourage me

172
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,382
to work in the post office
when I was younger

173
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,966
'cause she didn't think
I could amount to anything.

174
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,074
- And look what happened.
- And that's not to say that..

175
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,674
..you couldn't amount to anything.

176
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:39,632
But, you know,
she felt that way about me

177
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:42,924
'cause she wanted me to have the
security of a job, that's all, you know.

178
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:44,507
And she thought it
would be easy for me.

179
00:06:44,508 --> 00:06:47,716
Not that it's easy, but she
thought it'd be easy for me,

180
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:48,966
because it's not
that much doing.

181
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,132
You bring mail,
you drop it off.

182
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,882
She thought I could do this.

183
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:56,382
Uh, yeah. Anyway, you could
do me a big favor.

184
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:57,841
Not big, small favor.

185
00:06:57,842 --> 00:06:59,716
I... I don't wanna
taint the favor.

186
00:06:59,717 --> 00:07:01,383
- It's a small favor.
- Okay.

187
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,799
Is Richard Lewis on your route?
He must be.

188
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,848
Richard... two blocks over?

189
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,048
Yes. Have you been to
his house yet today?

190
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:11,340
Not yet. No.

191
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:12,882
Could you drop
a book off for me?

192
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:14,632
I absolutely could.

193
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:17,257
You'd need to package it up
and put on a stamp.

194
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:18,590
Look, I could do that.

195
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,382
I mean, the idea is
that you're going there.

196
00:07:20,383 --> 00:07:22,966
Why not just drop the book off,
do me a little favor?

197
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,257
It's a little favor.
It's nothing.

198
00:07:24,258 --> 00:07:25,757
I'm pretty sure
the U.S. government

199
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:29,007
would consider that free mail,
which is kind of illegal.

200
00:07:29,008 --> 00:07:31,173
Don't be such a stickler.
Why are you being such a stickler?

201
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:31,765
It's just...

202
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:33,465
Do you think that's a good
quality, stickling?

203
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:36,424
- Don't stickle. Don't be a stickler.
- Don't be a stickler?

204
00:07:36,425 --> 00:07:38,674
No. You know what,
if you were going on a computer date,

205
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:42,424
one of those things, and you put down
"stickler," nobody would call you.

206
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,716
Well, it might be
why I'm still single.

207
00:07:44,717 --> 00:07:46,424
Ah.

208
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:50,382
Hey, Jeff, did you tell Lewis
about our new kitchen?

209
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:52,424
- No, I did not.
- In the new house?

210
00:07:52,425 --> 00:07:55,465
Richie, it is massive,
this new kitchen.

211
00:07:55,466 --> 00:07:58,424
I mean, it is just magnificent.

212
00:07:58,425 --> 00:08:00,340
You, especially, are going
to appreciate it.

213
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:03,799
- I can't wait, honey.
- Why are you especially?

214
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,465
- I have no fucking idea.
- Yeah, I...

215
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:08,424
Can I just say something?
It was a genius idea to start with.

216
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:11,215
- Oh, fantastic.
- You know, for a married man, a realtor?

217
00:08:11,216 --> 00:08:13,966
- Come on, man. The best.
- Oh, Jeff,

218
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:16,590
can you go to the basement and
get me a couple bottles of wine?

219
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,132
A red and a white, please?

220
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:20,340
Could I?
Well, I think I could.

221
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:21,466
I think I could.

222
00:08:24,008 --> 00:08:24,966
Thank you.

223
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,632
Hey, did you get
the book?

224
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:27,799
Yeah, yeah.

225
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,924
Oh, the mailwoman, wow!

226
00:08:30,925 --> 00:08:32,007
She's gorgeous.

227
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:33,507
I'm thinking of making a move.

228
00:08:33,508 --> 00:08:35,507
- On the mailwoman?
- I don't care what she does.

229
00:08:35,508 --> 00:08:37,882
No profession's off-limits to
me if a woman's attractive.

230
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:40,674
All men are like that.
We don't care about what they do.

231
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:42,841
We care about what they look like.
Women are just the opposite.

232
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:45,340
I think you might be right.
I dated a garbage woman.

233
00:08:45,341 --> 00:08:47,590
- And we'd shower.
- You dated your garbage woman?

234
00:08:47,591 --> 00:08:49,257
We had the shower,
that was the only thing.

235
00:08:49,258 --> 00:08:50,882
Yeah, she was great and smart,
but she needed the money.

236
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:53,007
- She had a couple of kids.
- I never even saw

237
00:08:53,008 --> 00:08:54,007
a garbage woman in my life.

238
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:55,298
You make up this story to me

239
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,882
about fucking a garbage woman?

240
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:58,549
- A story would be this...
- That's really odd to me

241
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,590
that you would make up
this story for what?

242
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,549
- No, here's a fact...
- So I would think

243
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,090
that you fucked a garbage woman?
Why do you want me to think that?

244
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:07,132
- I didn't see her as a garbage woman.
- Hey, Lar?

245
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,590
All right, we're...
we're done. Yeah.

246
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,632
- Hey, Lar, eat something.
- Hey.

247
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,257
- Are these washed?
- Of course.

248
00:09:14,258 --> 00:09:16,215
What are you... what kind
of question is that to ask me?

249
00:09:16,216 --> 00:09:19,048
- They look a little sticky.
- They're washed and organic.

250
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:21,465
Hey, I got the wedding invite.

251
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,549
- No, you didn't.
- I didn't?

252
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,674
No, that was a save the date.
That was not the invite.

253
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:27,048
I haven't even had them
printed yet.

254
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:28,549
- Save the date?
- Yeah.

255
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,549
Are you serious?
That's so stupid.

256
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,966
Larry, everybody saves dates.

257
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:33,090
I don't save dates.

258
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:34,215
The whole system's screwed up.

259
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:35,924
You don't need
to send me something

260
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,173
to tell me you're gonna send
me something, just send it.

261
00:09:38,174 --> 00:09:40,841
If I'm saying something to you,
I don't say to you,

262
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,882
"I'm gonna say something to you,"
and then say it.

263
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:43,683
I just say it.

264
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:46,048
This is the way things are done,
okay, asshole?

265
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:48,258
You're gonna come,
and you're gonna enjoy it!

266
00:09:49,758 --> 00:09:51,800
All right. Watch this.

267
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,924
- Terrific.
- Ta-da!

268
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:58,382
Unbelievable.
Ta... come on.

269
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:02,090
- Ah, look who's here! The happy couple.
- Hi, everybody.

270
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:03,757
- Mrs. Greene.
- Oh, my baby.

271
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:06,507
- Hi, Mom.
- Victor, my boy.

272
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:07,924
How you doing?
How you doing?

273
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:10,090
Okay, so this is our friend,
Richard Lewis.

274
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:13,340
- Thank you for your service, bro.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

275
00:10:13,341 --> 00:10:15,215
And our neighbors,
Leslie and John.

276
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:17,424
What a hero you are.
Thank you for your service.

277
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:19,257
Oh, thank you. The real
heroes are still there,

278
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:20,841
- but I appreciate that.
- Thank you for your service.

279
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:22,424
- Thank you.
- You have a grateful nation.

280
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,173
And this is our friend, Larry.

281
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:25,257
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,174
Nice to meet you.

283
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:39,340
Um, yeah, it's, uh...

284
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:42,424
You know what?
Um, I'm gonna excuse myself.

285
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:44,340
Victor.

286
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:47,132
- Victor.
- Huh? What... what's...?

287
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,507
You didn't thank him
for his service, asshole.

288
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:51,089
They thanked him.
Three people thanked him.

289
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,090
Why do I have to thank him?

290
00:10:52,091 --> 00:10:54,215
Fuck, how hard would it have been?
"Thank you for your service."

291
00:10:54,216 --> 00:10:56,298
Does everybody have to
thank him for his service?

292
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,048
Now you've ruined
everything, Larry.

293
00:10:58,049 --> 00:10:59,841
I'm making all this
delicious salmon,

294
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,382
and the whole night is ruined.

295
00:11:01,383 --> 00:11:03,257
- Are you sautéing that?
- Yes.

296
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:04,550
Would you mind broiling mine?

297
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:09,090
- That a face?
- Get the fuck out. Leave.

298
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:10,590
Hmm. Okay.

299
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,424
- Thank you for serving the hors d'oeuvres.
- Out!

300
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:15,132
Um, thank you for being
a very good manager.

301
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,215
Thank you for coming over
in this brisk weather.

302
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:19,257
Thank you for leaving!

303
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,090
Must be a lot of work
carrying the mail bag around.

304
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,382
You know what you could use?

305
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,090
You could use a caddy
on the route.

306
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:27,340
- I would love a mail caddy.
- Right?

307
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,340
- Are you kidding me?
- They carry the mail for you.

308
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:30,159
Yes.

309
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,549
'Cause you walk as much
as I do on a golf course.

310
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,215
- And you're, you know, you're carrying...
- Probably more.

311
00:11:33,216 --> 00:11:34,841
- I have a caddy.
- I would love a mail caddy.

312
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:36,924
They'll give you instructions.
"Okay, go up the path,

313
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:39,674
make a right, you know,
watch out for the dog."

314
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,298
- Yeah.
- I'll mail caddy for you.

315
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,507
- Would you?
- Yeah.

316
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:43,757
Just talk to the
U.S. government.

317
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:45,298
I think your mom
would be so proud.

318
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:46,674
All right, so what
do you want again?

319
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:48,382
Do you want the...
did you say Milk Duds?

320
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:49,674
- Milk Duds, Reese's Pieces...
- Really?

321
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,674
...Junior Mints,
popcorn... big popcorn.

322
00:11:51,675 --> 00:11:54,841
- And we'll mix them all together. It's...
- We'll what?

323
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:57,132
Oh, it's... it's like
the perfect bite.

324
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,215
It's, like, a little sweet
and a little salty.

325
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:01,215
- The textures...
- What are you mixing sweet and salty for?

326
00:12:01,216 --> 00:12:02,799
They're...
they're in conflict.

327
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,215
No, they're in cahoots.

328
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:07,757
I don't want Reese's
Pieces in my popcorn.

329
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:10,757
It's the perfect
movie treat, I promise.

330
00:12:10,758 --> 00:12:12,132
Do you have the tickets?

331
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:13,340
Oh, yeah. Here you go.

332
00:12:13,341 --> 00:12:14,882
Oh, hey, thanks.
All right.

333
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:16,215
- I'll get a seat.
- Eh, get me an aisle.

334
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:17,758
- Thank you.
- Okay.

335
00:12:22,466 --> 00:12:24,133
Jean? Jean?

336
00:12:30,925 --> 00:12:32,007
Jean?

337
00:12:32,008 --> 00:12:33,424
Jean?

338
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,716
Jean? Jean?

339
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,674
- Jean?
- Shh.

340
00:12:37,675 --> 00:12:39,590
Yeah, okay, okay.

341
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,257
Sorry, sorry.

342
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,173
- Jean?
- Shh.

343
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:45,257
Jean? Jean? Jean!

344
00:12:45,258 --> 00:12:47,424
I'm right here. I'm here.

345
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:49,674
Oh, there you are. Great.

346
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:51,882
Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

347
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:54,590
Sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

348
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:56,841
- You're so loud.
- I'm so loud?

349
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,132
I don't understand. I've been
looking for you for five minutes.

350
00:12:59,133 --> 00:13:01,632
- How come you didn't beckon?
- Why didn't... why didn't I beckon?

351
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:04,215
Yes, you beckon. You knew
I was coming into the theater.

352
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,424
You gotta wave. You gotta go
like this so I can see you.

353
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,674
Just look around.
I'm right here.

354
00:13:07,675 --> 00:13:09,424
You... I can't see
anything from down there.

355
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,048
I'm not gonna make a scene.

356
00:13:11,049 --> 00:13:12,424
Oh, who's telling you
to make a scene?

357
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,716
Just wave. Beckon.
Beckon. You gotta beckon.

358
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:17,424
- That's making a scene.
- Beckoning is not making a scene.

359
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:20,382
Making a scene is calling out
the name Jean 10 times.

360
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,757
- Would you shut up?
- You shut up.

361
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,090
Didn't have to
call out my name.

362
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:25,549
I did because
I couldn't find you.

363
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,925
- All you had to do was look.
- I did look.

364
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
What the fuck is going on here?

365
00:13:49,216 --> 00:13:52,507
Okay, well, guess
I'll see you tomorrow.

366
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:55,007
Yeah, yeah,
you're delivering.

367
00:13:55,008 --> 00:13:57,424
Yeah.

368
00:13:57,425 --> 00:13:59,465
You know what?

369
00:13:59,466 --> 00:14:02,173
I think we ought to go back

370
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,340
to our previous relationship
of homeowner and mailwoman.

371
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:07,298
'Cause I gotta tell you,
I have a very difficult time,

372
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:09,298
dating somebody who I'm seeing

373
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,674
on a daily basis... with you...
like, six times a week.

374
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:14,674
You know, I've gotta psych myself up
for dates. It's a big performance.

375
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:17,716
I gotta shower and shave
and prepare witticisms,

376
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:19,799
and, you know, it's...
it's a whole thing, and...

377
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,090
Is this what you
did for tonight?

378
00:14:21,091 --> 00:14:23,257
Did you prepare
witticisms for tonight?

379
00:14:23,258 --> 00:14:26,382
Yeah, that whole thing about the
made-up Jewish holiday "Shecooktus,"

380
00:14:26,383 --> 00:14:29,007
that was all... that was
prepared beforehand, yeah.

381
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:30,298
- Oh.
- Yeah.

382
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:31,841
If you... if you're
working for UPS

383
00:14:31,842 --> 00:14:34,048
and I saw you maybe
two times a week,

384
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:35,507
that would be...
that would be fine.

385
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,257
But I... I have to see you
six times a week.

386
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:41,340
So, I'd love to hit the reset
button and just, you know,

387
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:43,590
we go back to, uh,
homeowner-mailwoman.

388
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,549
No.

389
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,674
- Why not... wha... no?
- No.

390
00:14:47,675 --> 00:14:50,549
What, you feel we're
beyond resetting?

391
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,340
- Yeah, I think we are.
- Why?

392
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:54,882
- Why?
- Yeah, you reset.

393
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:56,590
- Let's hit the button.
- I don't think I can do that.

394
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,132
Yeah, we hit the...
we hit the big button.

395
00:14:58,133 --> 00:14:59,966
You can't just press a button.

396
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,382
You can't just
press a button.

397
00:15:01,383 --> 00:15:02,675
Why... why not?

398
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:07,090
That a face?

399
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:08,716
What was it?

400
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:10,174
What did the face mean?

401
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:13,800
What?

402
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,925
Good... good night.

403
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,882
- Mr. David.
- Hey, Sal.

404
00:15:27,883 --> 00:15:29,632
What ever happened
to rabbit ears?

405
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:32,215
I can't tell you how many
times my cable has gone down

406
00:15:32,216 --> 00:15:33,966
right in the middle
of one of my favorite shows.

407
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,590
- Really?
- Has that ever happened to you?

408
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:36,841
It's one of those things.

409
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:38,257
You're sitting,
you're enjoying,

410
00:15:38,258 --> 00:15:39,966
you've got a nice little
cup of coffee made,

411
00:15:39,967 --> 00:15:42,424
you're ready to enjoy the news,
a little TV show...

412
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:43,924
boom, what happens?

413
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:45,590
The cable goes down.

414
00:15:45,591 --> 00:15:47,257
- Sal, Sal.
- Isn't it horrible?

415
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:50,424
We can't do this anymore.

416
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:51,799
Do what, sir?

417
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,799
I'd like to hit the reset
button on our relationship

418
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,632
and... and go back
to the way it was

419
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:59,966
before I ever put the window
down and started talking.

420
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:03,590
You know, just drive in with the
window up, wave, and... and move on.

421
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,257
- You know, like everybody else.
- You don't enjoy our conversations?

422
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,465
No, I wouldn't say
I don't enjoy them, but...

423
00:16:08,466 --> 00:16:10,549
- I haven't upset you in any way...
- No, I'm just...

424
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,674
- I'm very anxious to play...
- I don't mean to be forward, sir.

425
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:14,716
No, no, no,
it's nothing like that at all.

426
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:16,882
- I just like to get to the golf course.
- Yes, of course.

427
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:18,632
- You want to play with your friends.
- Yeah. Yeah.

428
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,757
I understand exactly what
you're saying, Mr. David.

429
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:22,841
- I'm excited to play, and I can't...
- Well, you can be excited.

430
00:16:22,842 --> 00:16:23,998
You won't have me to
worry about anymore.

431
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:24,799
I'm not...

432
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,215
I'm not worried about...
it wasn't that.

433
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:29,048
Come on, d-don't be mad.

434
00:16:29,049 --> 00:16:30,966
- I'm not mad, sir.
- I mean, I'll still drive by.

435
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,549
I'll still see you
with the window up,

436
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,257
and... I'll see you with the
window up and I'll wave,

437
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:37,507
you know, the way...
the way it used to be.

438
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:39,298
Good.

439
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,800
Good day, mister.

440
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:44,757
Eh. Ah.

441
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:46,340
Sorry.

442
00:16:46,341 --> 00:16:48,007
Sorry.

443
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,091
I'm sorry.

444
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:58,841
Listen, I guess, I don't
wanna keep harping on it,

445
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:01,966
but Victor is so obsessed.

446
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,174
I won't even say hurt.

447
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,674
He's obsessed with you not
thanking him for his service.

448
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:08,382
- It really makes him nuts.
- There's something about the expression

449
00:17:08,383 --> 00:17:10,507
that I can't quite
get it out of my mouth.

450
00:17:10,508 --> 00:17:12,007
'Cause remember,
he loves "Seinfeld,"

451
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:14,090
was so looking forward
to spending time with you.

452
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,924
- He just wanted you to...
- Wow, really? My God.

453
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:19,924
- Just acknowledge the guy.
- Is there anything I can do?

454
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:22,007
Should I take him out to lunch?

455
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:25,507
You know that Sal

456
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:27,132
at the gate,
the security guard?

457
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,799
- Mm-hmm.
- He does this, um,

458
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,048
Revolutionary War
reenactment stuff.

459
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:34,459
There's one coming up right
here at Will Rogers.

460
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,660
Okay.

461
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:38,716
Do you have any idea how
big that would be for him?

462
00:17:38,717 --> 00:17:40,382
I've heard him talk
about those things.

463
00:17:40,383 --> 00:17:43,173
- Really?
- Yes. He's never gone.

464
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:46,215
He will love it!
Oh, my God, would he love it.

465
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:48,465
W-we'll do...
we'll dress up as soldiers.

466
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,054
- You dress on up.
- I'd love to.

467
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:51,514
So it is a good thing you
lowered your window.

468
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:52,215
Yeah.

469
00:17:52,216 --> 00:17:54,132
Sir, Mr. Takahashi
would like a word with you.

470
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,882
Okay.

471
00:17:55,883 --> 00:17:57,382
Well, send him my best.

472
00:17:57,383 --> 00:17:58,675
This can't be good.

473
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:03,841
Ah, hey, Chef Curtis.

474
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:05,799
- Oh, hi.
- Hi. You got a second?

475
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,924
Uh, sure.

476
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:09,048
Do you remember the other day,

477
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:13,841
uh, a waiter asked if you
would broil the sole?

478
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,799
- Yeah, that's, um... yep.
- Remember that?

479
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,382
And I'm wondering when he
asked you that question,

480
00:18:19,383 --> 00:18:22,465
did you... did you make
a face, by any chance?

481
00:18:22,466 --> 00:18:26,049
- I may have made a small face,
- You made a small face?

482
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,049
Sure

483
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,590
Would you mind
showing me that face?

484
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:30,716
- I'd love to see it.
- It's... I don't...

485
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,716
- I don't think that's... mm.
- I'd love... I'd love to see the face.

486
00:18:32,717 --> 00:18:34,924
Eh, nobody's watching.
Come on, make a face, make a face.

487
00:18:34,925 --> 00:18:38,340
It was probably something like...

488
00:18:39,883 --> 00:18:42,090
- Really?
- Yeah, that's...

489
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:44,757
You did a semi-horse whinny?

490
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:47,048
I... I mean, if you wanna
call it that, sure.

491
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:48,674
Wow, that's a pretty
strong reaction.

492
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:49,757
Well, it was a strong request.

493
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:51,007
- Was it?
- Yeah.

494
00:18:51,008 --> 00:18:53,507
You know, I prepare it
the way I prepare it

495
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:56,048
- because it's better.
- I gotta tell you something.

496
00:18:56,049 --> 00:18:58,841
That's not the face that
the waiter presented to me.

497
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:00,465
The face that was presented
to me was more like...

498
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:03,590
I don't...

499
00:19:03,591 --> 00:19:05,132
No, I would never
make that face.

500
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,757
That face doesn't even
communicate anything.

501
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:09,215
What's that?

502
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:11,465
Well, maybe...
maybe it was more...

503
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:13,507
No, that's... I don't...

504
00:19:13,508 --> 00:19:15,007
It was definitely
an expulsion...

505
00:19:15,008 --> 00:19:17,298
there was an expulsion
of air, I'm sure.

506
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:23,298
That doesn't seem close.

507
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,132
- Not close?
- No, it doesn't seem close.

508
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:27,132
All right, so, anyway,
I want to apologize.

509
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,132
Had I known that you made a
horse whinny with an eye roll,

510
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:30,632
I never would've
told you to broil it.

511
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,298
- I made a face, so...
- Oh, you know what?

512
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:34,257
Well, yes, look,
there he is right here.

513
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,590
I'm gonna go talk to him.
Hey.

514
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:40,590
So, uh, remember
the other day,

515
00:19:40,591 --> 00:19:43,757
you made the face the, uh...
the chef made for me?

516
00:19:43,758 --> 00:19:44,674
I remember.

517
00:19:44,675 --> 00:19:46,257
Yeah, well...

518
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:50,757
I gotta say, you weren't even...
not even close.

519
00:19:50,758 --> 00:19:52,549
Massively undersold it.

520
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,048
What are you talking about?

521
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:56,465
The chef said that
he went like this...

522
00:19:58,216 --> 00:20:00,841
- No.
- That's nothing like what you did.

523
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:03,340
No, when I went back to him,
I said, "Can you broil the sole?"

524
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:05,632
And he said...

525
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:08,590
And I came back
and I showed you...

526
00:20:08,591 --> 00:20:10,590
No, the chef went...

527
00:20:10,591 --> 00:20:12,549
- with an eye roll and...
- I mean, he looked up.

528
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,841
- I don't think it was an eye roll.
- It was definitely an eye roll.

529
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:17,382
Shh. He went...

530
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,215
Not even... not even that.
He went...

531
00:20:21,717 --> 00:20:24,716
No. According to him,
he was...

532
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:28,882
No. I went in, and I said,
"Can you broil it?" He said...

533
00:20:28,883 --> 00:20:32,465
I said... and then I came
back to you and I said...

534
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:40,966
All right, well, it's a
little confusing, I must say.

535
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:43,048
I brought you exactly
what he gave me.

536
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:45,049
It's a clash of faces.

537
00:20:47,383 --> 00:20:48,925
Enter.

538
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,590
You wanna see me, Mr. Takahashi?

539
00:20:52,591 --> 00:20:54,298
- Yes.
- Close the door?

540
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:55,174
Yes.

541
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,550
No.

542
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,799
Um...

543
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,048
so, what is the nature
of the summons?

544
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,757
It has been brought
to my attention

545
00:21:10,758 --> 00:21:15,716
that you have disgraced Ken
Carmen and his wife, Shelly.

546
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:17,215
Oh, no.

547
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:18,924
I made a comment
about their child.

548
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:20,465
I said it looked
a little Asian,

549
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,048
and it does look
a little Asian.

550
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,966
So what?
It's a compliment...

551
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,799
Stop!

552
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,173
We will decide what
punitive action to take.

553
00:21:29,174 --> 00:21:31,257
Punitive action?
Why? Wh-why?

554
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:32,757
Expect a letter soon.

555
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,757
- Soon?
- Yes.

556
00:21:34,758 --> 00:21:36,298
A day? Two days? Four days?

557
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,716
Everybody know what "soon" is.

558
00:21:37,717 --> 00:21:38,882
I don't know what "soon" is.

559
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:40,090
Soon is soon.

560
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,340
- Soon is not soon.
- Soon is soon.

561
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,298
Soon is not soon.

562
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,298
Soon is when
I say it is.

563
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,716
All right, I'll expect
a letter in a couple of days

564
00:21:47,717 --> 00:21:49,257
unless you tell me
otherwise right now.

565
00:21:49,258 --> 00:21:50,133
Go!

566
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:54,341
Go.

567
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,757
Hey, did you get
the mail today?

568
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:00,966
- Haven't seen any mail.
- Did you check the box?

569
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,465
Twice. No mail.

570
00:22:02,466 --> 00:22:05,091
Haven't seen any mail
in three days.

571
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:11,674
Hello. Who is it?

572
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:14,298
Hey. Did, uh...
did you get mail today?

573
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,799
Of course I got
the mail today.

574
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,298
- Why? What's wrong?
- Fuck!

575
00:22:18,299 --> 00:22:20,132
All right, thanks.

576
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,424
Damn it!

577
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:22,674
Mm-hmm.

578
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,340
We're not getting mail.

579
00:22:24,341 --> 00:22:26,340
The mailwoman has
stopped delivering

580
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:27,924
since... since our date.

581
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:30,674
Had the same situation
with a girl at Burger King.

582
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:32,716
Haven't had a Whopper
in fucking three years.

583
00:22:32,717 --> 00:22:34,674
Yeah. You can't
go back there, right?

584
00:22:34,675 --> 00:22:36,298
I know, you can't...
you can never go out

585
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,465
with somebody you have
contact with on a daily basis

586
00:22:38,466 --> 00:22:40,173
or weekly basis
or yearly basis.

587
00:22:40,174 --> 00:22:42,298
You can only date
people you don't know

588
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,924
and you'll never, ever see.

589
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:46,173
She has a route to do.
She fucking delivers mail.

590
00:22:46,174 --> 00:22:47,841
She has a fucking route
she gotta fucking hit.

591
00:22:47,842 --> 00:22:50,424
There's also... there's also
a post office credo.

592
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:51,841
They should put
"spite" in there.

593
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:54,924
"Neither rain nor snow
nor heat nor spite

594
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,590
shall keep these couriers."

595
00:22:56,591 --> 00:22:58,340
That'd be cool, but that's
not how this shit work.

596
00:22:58,341 --> 00:22:59,924
You hit the fucking
reset button.

597
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:02,340
I wanted to go back to...
to just her delivering mail

598
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:03,465
and, uh, me saying hello.

599
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,090
Now look at us,
no fucking mail.

600
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:07,215
You know how much shit I got
coming to this house?

601
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,215
- What?
- I got my CD of the Month Club...

602
00:23:09,216 --> 00:23:10,590
I'm not getting my fucking CDs...

603
00:23:10,591 --> 00:23:12,465
my DVDs, all kinds
of shit comes here.

604
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,674
Yeah, you know what I got?
I got a letter from Mr. Takahashi,

605
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:18,048
who I'm waiting for, and...
and I'll never get it now.

606
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:20,090
And now I don't know
if I'm in the club or not.

607
00:23:20,091 --> 00:23:21,716
So, next time
you tap that ass...

608
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,841
I didn't tap...
I didn't tap any ass.

609
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:26,215
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Wait a minute.

610
00:23:26,216 --> 00:23:27,507
You didn't tear that ass up?

611
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,382
No.

612
00:23:29,383 --> 00:23:31,507
- Just a fucking date?
- That's it.

613
00:23:31,508 --> 00:23:32,966
You didn't hit it?

614
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:35,048
And you going through the
same shit if you had hit it?

615
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,590
Nope, nope. I didn't hit it,
I didn't tap it,

616
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:40,048
I didn't tear into it,
and we still get no mail.

617
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:41,008
Unbelievable.

618
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,341
Hey, Sal!

619
00:23:58,008 --> 00:24:00,090
Hey, Sal, put the gate up?

620
00:24:00,091 --> 00:24:01,799
I'm expecting this letter
from the club,

621
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,716
but I had a fight
with my mailwoman,

622
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:05,048
so I'm not getting any mail,

623
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:06,799
and I just wanted
to go find out about,

624
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,841
uh, what... what the letter
was all about, so.

625
00:24:08,842 --> 00:24:10,424
You're supposed to get a letter?

626
00:24:10,425 --> 00:24:12,090
Yeah, but the mailwoman wouldn't...
wouldn't deliver it.

627
00:24:12,091 --> 00:24:13,298
And why is that, Mr. David?

628
00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:17,090
Uh, I hit the...
the reset button.

629
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,757
- Oh, that button. Yeah.
- Yeah.

630
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,924
You've hit that before,
haven't you, sir?

631
00:24:20,925 --> 00:24:25,674
Unfortunately, Mr. David, you are at
the very top of the do not admit list.

632
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:26,966
- You're kidding!
- Mm-hmm.

633
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:28,674
- Oh, Sal.
- It's the truth.

634
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,882
- Huge misunderstanding here.
- Let me double-check.

635
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:33,590
No, you're completely forbidden
from entering the premises.

636
00:24:33,591 --> 00:24:34,674
You're not gonna open the gate?

637
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:37,090
You're on our list, sir.

638
00:24:37,091 --> 00:24:40,090
You know what, I was the only one
in this club who ever spoke to you.

639
00:24:40,091 --> 00:24:42,047
- Sir, please back out.
- I regret every conversation

640
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,048
I had to sit through.

641
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:47,273
- So unbelievably boring...
- Do I need to call security?

642
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:48,674
...about your fucking cat.

643
00:24:48,675 --> 00:24:51,716
I will call security or I will
deal with you myself, sir.

644
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:54,340
Not one person spoke
to you except me.

645
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:55,590
And now I'm being
punished for it?

646
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:56,882
Sir, you can
back out, please.

647
00:24:56,883 --> 00:24:59,632
10 years I came up here,
I put the window down.

648
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:03,215
I talked to you,
and I was suffocating

649
00:25:03,216 --> 00:25:05,382
from the bullshit and drivel

650
00:25:05,383 --> 00:25:07,132
that was coming
out of your mouth...

651
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,507
Back out your car, please.

652
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:10,298
And don't bump into the
speaker on your way out.

653
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:11,800
Fine.

654
00:25:29,216 --> 00:25:30,799
Huh? What do you think, Victor?

655
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,841
That's a good look.

656
00:25:31,842 --> 00:25:33,007
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

657
00:25:33,008 --> 00:25:34,549
Yeah, you look very honorable.

658
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,674
Hey, look who's here.

659
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,340
- Hi.
- Good morning, gentlemen.

660
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:39,924
Good morning, Mr. Franklin.

661
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,799
And how are you this fine day?

662
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,132
I am fine. And you?

663
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:44,674
I'm... I'm well, thank you.

664
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:46,882
Now, gentlemen,
make haste slowly.

665
00:25:46,883 --> 00:25:49,465
- Make... make haste slowly.
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

666
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,132
Make haste slowly.

667
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,048
- Huh? You like that?
- Yeah, I like that.

668
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,716
Attention, camp.

669
00:25:54,717 --> 00:25:57,382
His Excellency,
General George Washington.

670
00:25:57,383 --> 00:25:59,674
Thank you, General,
for the kind introduction.

671
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:02,966
As you were, gentlemen. And who
are these fine gentlemen here?

672
00:26:02,967 --> 00:26:04,215
Recruits, sir.

673
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:05,674
Private Chesnik
reporting for duty, sir.

674
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:07,882
Lieutenant David
reporting for duty, sir!

675
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:08,882
Lieutenant?

676
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:11,632
I, uh, I elevated myself
somewhat, yes.

677
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:14,090
Okay, well, are you ready
to die for your country?

678
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:16,424
I'm ready to play dead
for my country,

679
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:19,716
which nobody could do like I
can if I put my mind to it.

680
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:23,966
Indeed, well, gentlemen, I have lots
of work to do to tend to an army,

681
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:26,549
- so we shall see you at the end.
- Yes. Go, tend to your army.

682
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,882
- Thank you very much.
- Yes.

683
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:30,924
He's quite a disappointment.

684
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:36,883
Attention!

685
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,007
Battalion!

686
00:26:43,008 --> 00:26:44,882
- Company!
- Ready!

687
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:47,632
- Forward at the half step.
- All right!

688
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:50,090
- March!
- March!

689
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,424
Ready!

690
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:58,632
Forward... march!

691
00:26:58,633 --> 00:27:01,590
Battalion halt!

692
00:27:01,591 --> 00:27:03,924
- Halt!
- Halt!

693
00:27:03,925 --> 00:27:05,507
Front rank, ready?

694
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:07,257
Make ready!

695
00:27:10,383 --> 00:27:11,757
Take aim!

696
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:13,091
Fire!

697
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,048
Fire!

698
00:27:18,842 --> 00:27:20,549
What are you...
what are you doing?

699
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,215
You got three hours
to go, here.

700
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:24,716
Are you crazy?
Get up. This is nuts.

701
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:26,382
By God, sir, get back in rank.

702
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:27,799
You're not gonna have any fun.

703
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,257
Come on, he's not
gonna have any fun.

704
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:32,507
That's not fair. It's not fair.

705
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:34,591
Let him live. Let him live.

706
00:27:35,883 --> 00:27:37,507
Larry come on,
get back in line.

707
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:38,842
- Fall back, come on.
- No. It's so stupid.

708
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,173
Reload! Reload!

709
00:27:44,174 --> 00:27:45,799
- Hey, Larry.
- What the hell was that?

710
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,465
- What was that?
- Was that real?

711
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,632
There's a crater
in the ground.

712
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,465
Oh, my God!

713
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:52,674
Larry! Larry!
What the hell is this, man?

714
00:27:52,675 --> 00:27:54,632
- This is real! This is real!
- Oh, my God.

715
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:57,008
Somebody's shooting at us, man!

716
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,841
Ah! Incoming!

717
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:01,382
It's live rounds, Larry!

718
00:28:01,383 --> 00:28:03,424
- What the fuck?
- It's Sal!

719
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:05,173
- Sal? Who's Sal?
- Sal.

720
00:28:05,174 --> 00:28:06,841
He's a security guard
from my golf club.

721
00:28:06,842 --> 00:28:08,382
Why is he trying
to kill us, man?

722
00:28:08,383 --> 00:28:10,173
I told him I didn't wanna
say hello to him anymore.

723
00:28:10,174 --> 00:28:11,882
What?

724
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:13,799
Hello, Sal! I'm sorry!

725
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,215
Incoming!

726
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:20,048
Aah!

727
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:25,966
Hello!

728
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:27,257
How's your cat?

729
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,632
Hello, Sal. How you doing?

730
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:36,340
<i>Hot. Hot contact, hot contact.
We need air now.</i>

731
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:39,799
<i>Man down! Man down!</i>

732
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,882
Come on! Come on!

733
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:43,758
Let's go! Come on!

734
00:29:00,341 --> 00:29:03,173
For Britain and King George!

735
00:29:05,883 --> 00:29:10,757
Charge!

736
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:16,007
Larry! Larry, get up, get up.
Are you all right?

737
00:29:16,008 --> 00:29:18,090
Yeah. I'm good, yeah.

738
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:20,507
- What the...?
- Motherfucking redcoats!

739
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,632
God, those motherfuckers.

740
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:23,923
God damn it,
what the hell was that?

741
00:29:23,924 --> 00:29:24,924
Come on, come on.

742
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:26,882
Fuck. God damn it.

743
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:29,590
- Come on.
- I have no idea where we are.

744
00:29:29,591 --> 00:29:31,007
No idea.

745
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,090
You know what?
I think I know where the car is.

746
00:29:34,091 --> 00:29:36,340
I think it's that way.

747
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:38,257
Yeah.

748
00:29:38,258 --> 00:29:40,090
"Mister Tee"?

749
00:29:40,091 --> 00:29:43,215
Hey, that's
Mr. Takahashi's car.

750
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,090
Who's Mr. Takahashi?

751
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:47,299
What the hell
is he doing here?

752
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:54,924
- Oh, fuck.
- Oh, my God.

753
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:56,924
Ken's wife?

754
00:29:56,925 --> 00:30:00,173
This is interesting, because
I was coming over to the car

755
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,924
to ask you about the letter,

756
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,966
but, uh, I don't think
that'll be necessary anymore.

757
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:06,632
Do me a favor,

758
00:30:06,633 --> 00:30:08,173
will you call the club
and tell them

759
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:10,008
I'm coming over
to play some golf?

760
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:13,215
Okay.

761
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:15,257
See you at the club. Take care.

762
00:30:15,258 --> 00:30:17,757
I knew that baby
looked a little Asian.

763
00:30:17,758 --> 00:30:20,549
Hey, let's play some golf.

764
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,132
I don't know.

765
00:30:22,133 --> 00:30:23,590
What? No, come on.
It'll be fun.

766
00:30:23,591 --> 00:30:26,341
I think the car's that way.

767
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:35,215
Hello, Mr. David.
Nice to meet you.

768
00:30:35,216 --> 00:30:36,674
I'm Randy. I'm new here.

769
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:39,048
How are you? I was told
you'd be heading over.

770
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:39,925
Yeah.

771
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:51,048
That's how you do it.
That's how you do it.

772
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:52,799
All right, look,
you know, I got...

773
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,882
I got clothes in my
locker we can wear

774
00:30:54,883 --> 00:30:57,674
or we could just
take these jackets off.

775
00:30:57,675 --> 00:30:59,550
Doesn't really matter
what we're playing in.

776
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:03,925
What the fuck is this?

777
00:31:07,508 --> 00:31:08,674
You all right?

778
00:31:10,925 --> 00:31:12,507
Oh, fuck.
Pull over! Pull over!

779
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:14,674
10:00. Redcoats, man.

780
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:16,966
Larry, there's
fucking redcoats, man!

781
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,257
- You motherfuckers!
- Hey.

782
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:20,382
Don't tread on me,
motherfuckers!

783
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:22,007
- Come on! Yeah!
- Hey! No!

784
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:23,465
It's your last day,
you bitches.

785
00:31:23,466 --> 00:31:26,048
- Get the fuck outta here!
- They're valets!

786
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:28,215
Come on, man!

787
00:31:28,216 --> 00:31:30,216
Hey, please!

788
00:31:40,508 --> 00:31:43,341
Hey, asshole! Here's your mail.

789
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:52,258
Welcome home, soldier.
Thank you for your service.
