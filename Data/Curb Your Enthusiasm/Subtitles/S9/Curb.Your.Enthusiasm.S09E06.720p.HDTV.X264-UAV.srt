1
00:00:12,043 --> 00:00:15,125
No hanky-panky, Mr. Beshraavi,

2
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:17,042
from man or bird.

3
00:00:17,043 --> 00:00:19,625
Believe him, Nejim. He means it.

4
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:21,460
He said he'd kill me.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,459
Get him, Mustafa.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,876
Hey, hold that door!
Hold that door!

7
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:36,001
Flight 83... what?
Hold the door!

8
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:38,292
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- That's my flight to Los Angeles!

9
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:40,417
- I'm so sorry. You just missed it.
- I'm on that flight.

10
00:00:40,418 --> 00:00:41,733
- Look, I made the plane, I'm here!
- You were so close...

11
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:42,292
- What?!
- ...but unfortunately,

12
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:43,992
...the door is locked and closed.

13
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:46,250
- You're not letting me on the plane?
- I know it's frustrating,

14
00:00:46,251 --> 00:00:47,792
but once the door closes,
that's it.

15
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:49,042
Federal regulations.

16
00:00:49,043 --> 00:00:52,125
I got caught up watching
this movie in the hotel,

17
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:55,667
"Arabesque," with Sophia Loren
and Gregory Peck.

18
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:57,542
- Mm-hmm.
- Please let me in here.

19
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:59,667
It's so ridiculous.
There's the plane right there.

20
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:02,709
But, really, it's as if
the plane's not there.

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,417
Wha... are you a magician?

22
00:01:04,418 --> 00:01:06,375
- No, but the door is locked.
- I see the plane.

23
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:08,375
If you're doing a trick,
it's not a good trick.

24
00:01:08,376 --> 00:01:10,375
I'm trying my best
to accommodate you.

25
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:12,208
It doesn't seem like it.
You're not golden-ruling it.

26
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,709
You're not doing unto others as
you would have others do unto you.

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,959
Unfortunately, the golden rule
is not a federal regulation.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,667
Golden rule trumps everything.

29
00:01:19,668 --> 00:01:22,542
Golden rule's on top,
federal law is second.

30
00:01:22,543 --> 00:01:26,083
Good news...
we do have one seat left

31
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:27,584
on the next available flight.

32
00:01:27,585 --> 00:01:31,250
- First class?
- No, but it's an aisle seat,

33
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,417
which is kind of a miracle.

34
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,250
So you do have a little time

35
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:37,042
to enjoy our amazing mall here.

36
00:01:37,043 --> 00:01:39,792
- We have a Wetzel's Pretzels...
- A Wetzel's Pretzels.

37
00:01:39,793 --> 00:01:43,417
I can't wait to chomp into one
of those Wetzel's Pretzels.

38
00:01:43,418 --> 00:01:44,418
They're delicious.

39
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:48,167
- Good afternoon. Welcome aboard.
- Hi.

40
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,417
11C... straight down
and on the right, sir.

41
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:52,792
Are there any
first-class seats open?

42
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:54,083
No, it's a full
flight, sir.

43
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:57,959
Look, there's an
empty seat over here.

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,792
Straight down, right-hand side.

45
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:01,917
- Hello.
- If somebody doesn't show up, though,

46
00:02:01,918 --> 00:02:04,042
you let me know, okay?

47
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,917
And, you know,
we can work something out.

48
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,500
I can pay you
separately, perhaps.

49
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:10,793
Go to your seat, please, sir.
Thank you.

50
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:16,917
Hey, what are you doing?
I just opened this up for me.

51
00:02:16,918 --> 00:02:18,459
- What are you doing?
- That's my spot right there.

52
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,959
I don't care.
That doesn't mean anything.

53
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,292
This is filled up.
I'm using this.

54
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:22,584
I don't know what
to tell you, buddy.

55
00:02:22,585 --> 00:02:23,626
It's the Wild West, okay, so.

56
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:36,001
Larry.

57
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,959
- Nathan Winocur.
- Hey, Doctor.

58
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,667
- Friend of Marty's.
- Yeah.

59
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:41,667
- Good to see ya.
- Nice to see you.

60
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:43,167
Ocean View, right?

61
00:02:43,168 --> 00:02:45,417
That's right.
We should play a round.

62
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:47,792
- We should play.
- Let's do that. I'll talk to Marty.

63
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,250
- And I'll get Jeff. You know Jeff?
- I love Jeff.

64
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:52,625
- That's a great foursome.
- Yeah, it's a good foursome.

65
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,667
- Great.
- Uh, I think I'm there.

66
00:02:54,668 --> 00:02:58,002
Okay, that's me. Thank you.

67
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:16,625
Sir, sir, I'm sorry. This is for
first class passengers.

68
00:03:16,626 --> 00:03:19,667
- I know, but I... I...
- Your ticket's for 11C, sir.

69
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:21,125
I know, but nobody's
sitting there.

70
00:03:21,126 --> 00:03:22,917
Could you give me, like,
a personal upgrade,

71
00:03:22,918 --> 00:03:25,001
and I can upgrade you, and...

72
00:03:25,002 --> 00:03:27,501
- Sir.
- No? Okay.

73
00:03:31,043 --> 00:03:33,584
Sir, can I ask you
a really big favor?

74
00:03:33,585 --> 00:03:36,333
I have a medical condition

75
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:39,542
where I have to...
my bladder's really overactive.

76
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,208
I have a bladder condition,

77
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:43,375
and I have to get up a lot.

78
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:45,250
Is there any way
I could sit in the aisle

79
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,375
and you would want
to switch to the middle?

80
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:49,667
I can't switch seats with you.

81
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:52,083
I mean, I got the...
I can't sit in the middle.

82
00:03:52,084 --> 00:03:54,083
It's claustro...
claustrophobic in there.

83
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:57,250
It's okay. I just have to
ask because I'm up so often.

84
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,542
- I'm sorry.
- I'll die in the middle.

85
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:00,250
It's so painful, too.

86
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,584
Just wanna see where
the bathrooms are so I know,

87
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:04,917
- 'cause it's gonna be a run.
- Okay, fine.

88
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:07,292
Really?

89
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:10,125
You are such a gentleman.
Thank you so much.

90
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:11,084
You're welcome.

91
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,584
Heh-hey, my lucky day.

92
00:04:14,585 --> 00:04:17,418
Yeah, mine, too.

93
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,625
I'm just looking
for the little thing.

94
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:28,625
- Gotta buckle up.
- Jesus Christ.

95
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,251
Give it here.

96
00:04:41,793 --> 00:04:43,752
Oh, come on.

97
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,417
Can I grab one
of your Kleenex, please?

98
00:04:47,418 --> 00:04:48,792
Oh.

99
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:51,043
I just got... I think
it's just allergies.

100
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,626
Oh, man.

101
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:04,667
No. No.

102
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:05,668
No.

103
00:05:10,585 --> 00:05:12,292
Sir, if I could just
have you open your eyes

104
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,500
so I can see your pupils.

105
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:17,083
If you could just try
and relax a little bit.

106
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:19,542
- Long, deep breaths.
- Excuse me, everyone.

107
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:21,625
One of our passengers
has taken ill.

108
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:23,250
If there's a doctor onboard,

109
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:25,834
can you please ring
your call button?

110
00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:27,542
Now, sir, are you currently...

111
00:05:27,543 --> 00:05:30,001
Hey, they're asking
for a doctor.

112
00:05:30,002 --> 00:05:32,208
- Mm-mmm.
- Huh?

113
00:05:32,209 --> 00:05:33,459
You're not gonna
heed the call?

114
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,751
Give it a minute.
He's gonna be fine.

115
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,292
How do you know?
You don't even know what he has.

116
00:05:38,293 --> 00:05:41,001
You ever been part of an emergency
landing? Is that what you want, Larry?

117
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:43,292
To spend the night in Lubbock,
Texas, at a Days Inn

118
00:05:43,293 --> 00:05:45,542
with a $15 voucher
from Cinnabon?

119
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:47,460
Think about it.

120
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:54,001
Excuse me.

121
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:55,500
I'd like to use
the bathroom.

122
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,042
Okay.

123
00:05:57,043 --> 00:05:58,668
- Here.
- Thank you.

124
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,042
Yeah, don't...
don't move too much.

125
00:06:04,043 --> 00:06:05,792
Don't get up.

126
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:07,333
Ow!

127
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:10,626
Ah! Why don't you move your foot,
for God's sake?!

128
00:06:13,877 --> 00:06:15,709
I'm so glad I ran into
you on this flight.

129
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,167
I'll call up Marty.
We'll set up a game.

130
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,751
Yeah, yeah,
we'll play.

131
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,709
Oh, you got up.

132
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,375
By the way, that's the first time
that you got up the entire trip.

133
00:06:23,376 --> 00:06:25,876
That was a total bullshit
story about the bladder.

134
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:28,459
- I have a medical condition.
- Medical.

135
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,042
You got a medical
condition.

136
00:06:30,043 --> 00:06:31,917
She's got
a medical condition.

137
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:33,834
One day, you're... you're gonna
really have to go to the bathroom,

138
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,042
and no one's gonna let you.

139
00:06:35,043 --> 00:06:36,625
I had to sit in the middle

140
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,251
the entire trip because of you!

141
00:06:45,543 --> 00:06:46,752
Thank you.

142
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,667
Welcome back.

143
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:54,709
Thank you.

144
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,125
Nice to be home.
Is that your handiwork?

145
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,876
Fuck, no.
I wouldn't do that shit.

146
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,417
You know what, that's not
gonna make me wash a car.

147
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,001
If anything,
I'm not gonna wash it.

148
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,959
- I wouldn't wash it.
- Just to annoy this guy.

149
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,208
I assume it's a guy. A woman
wouldn't do something like that.

150
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:08,417
Ladies don't do
that kind of shit.

151
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:11,208
Ladies bust windows out
and slash tires

152
00:07:11,209 --> 00:07:12,584
and key your car and shit.

153
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:14,918
"Wash me."
This is what I'm gonna do.

154
00:07:17,084 --> 00:07:18,375
- I like that shit.
- Huh?

155
00:07:18,376 --> 00:07:20,250
You like that?
See the comma after "no"?

156
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:21,584
- No!
- That's good grammar.

157
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:23,333
- You wash me! You wash me!
- Yeah.

158
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:24,667
- Yeah.
- I like that shit.

159
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:27,167
Hey, did you ever see
this movie "Arabesque"?

160
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:29,333
Nah. Is that one
of those "Star Trek" movies?

161
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,959
No, no. It's an old movie
with Sophia Loren.

162
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,417
- She's gorgeous.
- Is she naked in the movie?

163
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:35,876
No, it was...
it was from the '60s.

164
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,500
Nobody... nobody
got naked in the '60s.

165
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,333
She's gotta be naked
in something.

166
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,167
Well, if you come across
anything, let me know.

167
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,251
You know I'ma look.

168
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:46,292
He refused to see the person?

169
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:48,250
He did not heed the call!

170
00:07:48,251 --> 00:07:49,667
I don't know what
happened on the plane,

171
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:51,709
but he's a great guy
to play golf with.

172
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,876
Very surprising.

173
00:07:52,877 --> 00:07:54,125
Do you care
about the character

174
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:55,459
of people you play golf with

175
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,083
if they leave you alone
on the course?

176
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:58,792
No, I'm happy to play
with a reprobate

177
00:07:58,793 --> 00:07:59,959
if he has a good personality

178
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,959
and I enjoy playing with him.

179
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,042
I'll play with reprobates.

180
00:08:02,043 --> 00:08:03,834
- Yeah?
- Oh, really?

181
00:08:03,835 --> 00:08:06,292
- Yes.
- You, Manson, Ramirez, and Hitler.

182
00:08:06,293 --> 00:08:08,751
- That's a good foursome.
- If they play fast.

183
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:11,125
- If they play fast.
- I'd rather play with a fast Manson

184
00:08:11,126 --> 00:08:13,208
than a slow Funkhouser,
I'll tell you that.

185
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:16,292
- Any day of the week.
- Yeah, you're a little slow.

186
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:18,500
I line my ball up,
I look, I hit it.

187
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,834
Hey, Lar, did I tell you that we
hired a decorator for the new house?

188
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,709
I'm going up to meet her
Sunday in San Francisco.

189
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,417
Jeff, you're taking me
to the airport, 1:00.

190
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,584
Don't forget.
Don't make any plans.

191
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:29,751
Airport... oh, God.

192
00:08:29,752 --> 00:08:30,751
Why does he have to take
you to the airport?

193
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:32,959
- He's gotta see me off.
- See you off?

194
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,250
You're not going to India.
You're going to San Francisco!

195
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:36,876
- It's an hour away.
- So what?

196
00:08:36,877 --> 00:08:38,500
See you off?
You'll be back that night.

197
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,667
You know what, Larry,
it's not surprising to me

198
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:43,500
that you're the only one of this
group who's here as a single...

199
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:45,333
- Oh, yeah.
- ...with no girlfriend, no wife.

200
00:08:45,334 --> 00:08:48,542
Maybe if you would've seen
Cheryl off a few more times,

201
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:50,625
- you'd still be together.
- I don't think so.

202
00:08:50,626 --> 00:08:53,709
- He wants to, trust me.
- No, trust me, he doesn't.

203
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,667
- Jeff, do you want to?
- No.

204
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,876
- Well, you're going to.
- You know why you're doing this?

205
00:08:57,877 --> 00:08:58,677
Why, Larry?

206
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:00,542
Because you wanna ruin his day,
that's why.

207
00:09:00,543 --> 00:09:02,542
Okay, Kreskin.
Could read my mind.

208
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,042
You think you know
what goes on

209
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,917
in the complexities
of my brain

210
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:08,333
and who I am.

211
00:09:08,334 --> 00:09:10,959
- The complexities of who you are?
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,167
Who are you?
You're a Jew from the Bronx!

213
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:16,001
I can't wait to see her off.

214
00:09:16,002 --> 00:09:18,333
- I really like your friends.
- They're very lovely people.

215
00:09:18,334 --> 00:09:21,042
Okay!

216
00:09:21,043 --> 00:09:24,043
Please do not sit on
the arm of the chair.

217
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:28,042
Dinner is served.

218
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:29,917
- Yeah, all right.
- Yay, yay.

219
00:09:29,918 --> 00:09:31,375
- Yeah!
- I like it.

220
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:33,959
- Did you fucking catch that?
- I caught it!

221
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,417
What the fuck?

222
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:38,376
Oh, oh, oh.
Honey, you forgot your drink.

223
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:41,208
Thanks.

224
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,417
Oh, Marilyn,
the table's gorgeous!

225
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:44,625
- Hey.
- Huh?

226
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,375
You ever called her
honey before?

227
00:09:47,376 --> 00:09:49,500
I doubt it.
No.

228
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:50,709
How many dates
have you been on?

229
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,917
- Two.
- Pssh!

230
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:54,250
You just gave
a premature honey.

231
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:55,417
I gotta tell you
something.

232
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:56,625
- A premature honey?
- Yeah.

233
00:09:56,626 --> 00:09:58,375
Premature, too soon for honey.

234
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,001
Honey's way down the line.

235
00:10:00,002 --> 00:10:01,709
You gotta spend
a weekend together

236
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,292
or something in the country
before you can jump to honey.

237
00:10:04,293 --> 00:10:05,751
I know what you're trying to do,

238
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,375
you're trying to jump ahead
with the relationship.

239
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:09,834
But it doesn't work.
You got caught.

240
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:10,583
You're blowing this..

241
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:11,783
- ..way out of proportion.
- Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

242
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:13,959
- She doesn't care, Dr. Phil.
- Okay.

243
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,001
You don't know what
you're talking about.

244
00:10:16,002 --> 00:10:17,667
- I think you made a big mistake.
- Everything is cool, man.

245
00:10:17,668 --> 00:10:20,500
Can I take a moment, please?

246
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:23,333
On behalf of my adorable
new girlfriend,

247
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:25,667
thank you for
a delicious dinner.

248
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:27,167
- Thank you for coming.
- Cheers.

249
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,375
Cheers. Prego.

250
00:10:28,376 --> 00:10:29,834
Marty, cheers.

251
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:31,500
- Health, happiness.
- So nice to meet you.

252
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:33,292
- Thank you for having us.
- Yes, very nice.

253
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:35,125
- You can't clink, Larry?
- Why do I have to clink?

254
00:10:35,126 --> 00:10:36,917
Because it's a custom
that people do,

255
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,125
- which is friendly and nice.
- It's a stupid custom.

256
00:10:38,126 --> 00:10:39,876
What does it mean,
the clinking?

257
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:41,834
- Oh.
- Cheers.

258
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,542
Mmm.

259
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:47,459
You know, you pick up a knife
like this, a steak knife,

260
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:50,042
you get the urge...
I do... that I wanna...

261
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:52,876
I wanna stab...
I wanna stab with it.

262
00:10:52,877 --> 00:10:54,584
- Oh?
- Really?

263
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:56,625
Yeah, 'cause you pick up a
baseball bat, you wanna swing it.

264
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:58,584
You pick up a tennis ball,
you wanna throw it.

265
00:10:58,585 --> 00:11:00,208
When you have a...
a knife,

266
00:11:00,209 --> 00:11:02,001
you wanna stab, do you not?

267
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:03,959
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Huh? Know what they should have?

268
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,426
- What's that?
- A stabbing range.

269
00:11:06,626 --> 00:11:07,875
- Get out of here.
- Yeah, a stabbing range where..

270
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,959
- you can stab..stab dummies.
- Wow.

271
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,500
You'd feel good.
You'd feel good.

272
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:13,959
Where would
the stabbing range be?

273
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,459
In the Valley.

274
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,083
What do you think,
Marilyn?

275
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,876
The knife...
do you feel like stabbing somebody?

276
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:22,043
Yeah, I feel like
stabbing someone.

277
00:11:24,168 --> 00:11:26,876
Hmm, interesting.

278
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:28,625
This is fantastic food.

279
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:30,333
- Thank you.
- It really is.

280
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:32,876
Yeah, I can never get
my potatoes like that.

281
00:11:32,877 --> 00:11:34,459
- Mmm.
- They're really good.

282
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,417
What is this, tap?

283
00:11:36,418 --> 00:11:38,001
Yes, it is.

284
00:11:38,002 --> 00:11:40,250
No filter?

285
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,584
No filter. Tap water.

286
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:42,751
Huh, interesting.

287
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,667
Surprised you don't
have a filter.

288
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:46,417
You have no filter.

289
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:48,667
- Huh, that's... yeah.
- Isn't it obvious?

290
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:49,584
That's true.

291
00:11:49,585 --> 00:11:51,584
You just say whatever
comes into your mind.

292
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,876
You don't really modulate your
inner feelings at all, do you?

293
00:11:54,877 --> 00:11:57,542
It's a good thing for me,
but it's a bad thing for water.

294
00:11:57,543 --> 00:12:01,002
Excuse me,
I smell something burning.

295
00:12:03,002 --> 00:12:04,333
- LD.
- Hmm?

296
00:12:04,334 --> 00:12:07,333
Goldfish would commit
suicide in this water.

297
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,709
Yeah! Wha... how come you didn't
say that when she was there?

298
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,625
You know, I'm a guest.
I don't know.

299
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,584
You're like Fred MacMurray
in "The Caine Mutiny"

300
00:12:14,585 --> 00:12:17,083
when he and Van Johnson
go to see the admiral,

301
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,208
then Fred MacMurray gets
cold feet and he backs out.

302
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:20,709
That's a movie,
this is real life.

303
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,917
In real life,
you're polite to your hostess.

304
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,250
Of course, you're polite.
And why wouldn't you be?

305
00:12:25,251 --> 00:12:26,960
There's a hostess,
and you have...

306
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,375
That's pretty good.

307
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,250
Sure, sure,
the water, the water.

308
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,126
By the way, I'm not the only
one who can't stand it.

309
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:35,626
Can't stand what?

310
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:40,293
Well, Marty likes my water.

311
00:12:55,293 --> 00:12:57,584
- Very good.
- See?

312
00:12:57,585 --> 00:12:59,876
You're really the only person

313
00:12:59,877 --> 00:13:01,584
who has a problem
with the water.

314
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:03,917
You know, it's just water.
What are you so sensitive about?

315
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:05,584
I want you to go.

316
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:08,001
I'm getting kicked out?

317
00:13:08,002 --> 00:13:10,584
- Yeah, I think...
- You're kicking me out?

318
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:12,250
Yeah, I think you should leave.

319
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,208
This is unbelievable. Okay.

320
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:16,751
Well, it was fun.
We... we really...

321
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,625
- It was not fun.
- No, it wasn't.

322
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:21,459
I leave my knife

323
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,835
and I bid you adieu.

324
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:51,959
You guys, look! Ah!

325
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,876
- Hey, bald fuck!
- Bald fuck!

326
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:59,002
Blow me, blow me!

327
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:03,667
You wash it!
You wash it!

328
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:05,584
Blow me, bald fuck!

329
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:07,002
Shut up!
Shut up!

330
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:10,292
Oh, you were right, Larry.

331
00:14:10,293 --> 00:14:11,876
I blew it with Rhonda.

332
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:13,667
I told you it was
a premature honey.

333
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:16,333
And she's been cold ever since.

334
00:14:16,334 --> 00:14:18,584
- Yeah, it was bad.
- I said honey.

335
00:14:18,585 --> 00:14:20,667
- What's the big deal?
- I told them no mushrooms in this thing.

336
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:22,751
- I said no mushrooms, all right?
- I've lost a potential bride,

337
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:24,500
and you're talking about salad?

338
00:14:24,501 --> 00:14:28,208
- I blew it.
- You saw... you saw a wife there

339
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,417
and you seized on it
with a honey, right?

340
00:14:31,418 --> 00:14:33,001
- That's what you did.
- It was a seize.

341
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,333
- You seized.
- I did seize.

342
00:14:34,334 --> 00:14:35,834
- You did seize.
- So, what do I do?

343
00:14:35,835 --> 00:14:37,083
I don't know.

344
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,083
Oh, great.

345
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:41,001
It's from Rhonda.

346
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:43,001
"We need to talk."

347
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,208
- Oh.
- I'm through.

348
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,417
You're done.

349
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,292
What ever comes good
after "we need to talk"?

350
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:49,576
- Nothing.
- You ever hear this?

351
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:52,542
"We need to talk. I'm taking
you to Cancun."

352
00:14:52,543 --> 00:14:54,083
- No, that's not happening.
- Is that gonna happen?

353
00:14:54,084 --> 00:14:56,250
- No. No.
- That's not gonna happen.

354
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:58,792
- What do I do, man?
- Can I get you a refill?

355
00:14:58,793 --> 00:15:00,292
- Okay.
- What do I do?

356
00:15:00,293 --> 00:15:02,792
I got an idea. Text her back.

357
00:15:02,793 --> 00:15:04,542
Tell her to come meet you
at the restaurant.

358
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:06,125
- Why?
- When she comes in,

359
00:15:06,126 --> 00:15:08,542
you start calling
everybody honey.

360
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,709
- I do what?
- Call everybody honey...

361
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,751
the waitresses, the manager,
customers, everyone.

362
00:15:13,752 --> 00:15:16,500
- Why?
- Because... 'cause you're a guy

363
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,876
who just uses the
word honey a lot.

364
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,658
You mean it's part of
my working vocabulary?

365
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:21,959
Yes! Yes!

366
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,667
And what would that
mean to her?

367
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:25,792
That means that she's just
part of the honey parade.

368
00:15:25,793 --> 00:15:27,375
- So, I just call everybody honey?
- You call everybody honey.

369
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,208
- I like the honey parade.
- Huh?

370
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:31,418
- All right, I'll have her come down.
- Yeah.

371
00:15:33,209 --> 00:15:34,459
There, she's coming.
There she is.

372
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,667
- Where?
- There.

373
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,665
Oh, boy.

374
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:38,125
Larry, I didn't know you
were gonna be here.

375
00:15:38,126 --> 00:15:39,292
- Hi!
- Hi.

376
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:40,751
Hi. Oh,
hold on a second.

377
00:15:40,752 --> 00:15:42,834
Honey, do you mind
if I grab a chair?

378
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:47,042
- Thank you, honey.
- Oh, no, I don't... um, thanks.

379
00:15:47,043 --> 00:15:48,584
I just...
I could come back.

380
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:51,625
I just wanted to have just,
like, a quick conversation.

381
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,250
I don't wanna interrupt
a whole thing.

382
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,917
No, you're not
interrupting anything.

383
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:56,751
Excuse me, honey.
Can I get...

384
00:15:56,752 --> 00:15:59,001
- What... what do you want?
- Oh, I'll just have a coffee.

385
00:15:59,002 --> 00:16:02,167
A black coffee, honey.

386
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:04,459
That's all you want?
Are you hungry?

387
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,125
Uh, well, I wasn't planning
on staying that long,

388
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:09,250
- but maybe... maybe I'll get a sand...
- Oh, honey, right here.

389
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:10,792
- The coffee.
- Oh, thank you so much.

390
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:14,459
Honey, can you bring a turkey
burger and some fries?

391
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,042
Thanks, honey.
Hey, hon!

392
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,959
You know, honey,
can we get an extra napkin?

393
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,792
Hey, could I get
some coffee, honey?

394
00:16:19,793 --> 00:16:21,375
- Mm-hmm.
- Honey? Honey?

395
00:16:21,376 --> 00:16:22,459
Thank you, honey.

396
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,125
Could we get the check, honey?

397
00:16:24,126 --> 00:16:25,501
Thank you, honey.

398
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:31,459
- Thank you.
- So, what did you wanna talk about?

399
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,167
Oh, just I'm free
on Friday night now

400
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:37,959
and wanted to see if you wanted
to do something together.

401
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,001
Pick me up at work?
I'll be done around 8:00.

402
00:16:40,002 --> 00:16:41,500
Then we'll have just one car.

403
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,625
- Uh, yeah.
- Great!

404
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:46,542
- Where do you work?
- Uh, I work at Neiman Marcus.

405
00:16:46,543 --> 00:16:48,500
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

406
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:50,484
- Huh.
- I am a sales professional on

407
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:53,417
the men's floor. If you ever
want any help, let me know.

408
00:16:53,418 --> 00:16:54,751
Now that you mention it,

409
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:57,167
I could actually use
a couple of pairs of pants.

410
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:58,709
Call me anytime.
Seriously, stop by.

411
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,542
- I'm going to.
- Great, give him my number.

412
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:02,125
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

413
00:17:02,126 --> 00:17:03,751
- Larry, it's great to see you.
- Good to see you again.

414
00:17:03,752 --> 00:17:05,125
- Vey good to see you, Larry.
- Always a pleasure.

415
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:07,125
Do you want me to leave
any money for this?

416
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:08,751
- Are you taking care of it? Okay.
- It's all right.

417
00:17:08,752 --> 00:17:10,333
- It's all right.
- He's a good guy.

418
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:12,792
- To us.
- Oh! What do you wanna do on Friday?

419
00:17:12,793 --> 00:17:13,835
Anything you want, honey.

420
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:19,792
Oh.

421
00:17:19,793 --> 00:17:22,125
You wanna go to the Rams
game on Sunday with Rob?

422
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:23,459
He's got extra tickets.

423
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,625
I'd love to go to the
Rams game on Sunday.

424
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:28,250
Gotta take Susie
to the airport.

425
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,083
She's ridiculous!

426
00:17:30,084 --> 00:17:32,043
- All right, I got an idea.
- What?

427
00:17:33,668 --> 00:17:35,876
Accidental text on purpose.

428
00:17:35,877 --> 00:17:37,542
Please explain.

429
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:39,709
You're sending a text to me,

430
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,208
but it goes to her
"by accident."

431
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:44,375
- Uh-huh.
- And in the text, you say,

432
00:17:44,376 --> 00:17:46,667
"Hey, LD, I'd love
to go to the game,

433
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:48,083
but I'm taking Susie
to the airport.

434
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:49,459
I don't wanna disappoint her.

435
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,709
We're getting along so great."

436
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,792
- And it goes to her...
- It goes to her.

437
00:17:52,793 --> 00:17:54,417
- ...but it was meant to you.
- Meant to me!

438
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:56,375
- Saying how great Susie is...
- How great Susie is.

439
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,001
- ...and how much I love her.
- Yeah.

440
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:00,751
You, sir, are an amazing man.

441
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:02,751
- I am texting Susie right now.
- Oh, here they are.

442
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:04,250
- Larry, Jeff.
- Hello.

443
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,876
- Thanks for letting me join you guys.
- Sure.

444
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,417
- Yeah.
- You should see this guy on the range.

445
00:18:08,418 --> 00:18:10,667
- What's your handicap?
- 10.

446
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:12,584
- What are you?
- 15.

447
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:15,542
We should make it interesting,
play for some cheddar.

448
00:18:15,543 --> 00:18:18,042
- Sure.
- Yeah? 200?

449
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:20,251
- Okay, you're on.
- Great.

450
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,625
I pick up a knife,
I have an urge to stab.

451
00:18:24,626 --> 00:18:27,667
But it's a stupid thing
to say at a dinner table.

452
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:31,125
And then you made such a deal
over the goddamn filter.

453
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:32,059
Terrible water.

454
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,459
But you didn't have to
say anything about it.

455
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,083
How could you not comment
on water that's so bad?

456
00:18:36,084 --> 00:18:38,667
Okay, I've done everything
I can to get her back.

457
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:42,667
I sent her flowers... boom...
shredded on my doorstep.

458
00:18:42,668 --> 00:18:45,293
I mean,
I don't know what to do.

459
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,459
- Oh!
- Oh!

460
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,083
Oh!

461
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:53,584
- Accidental text on purpose!
- Accidental text. Oh, my God.

462
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:55,917
- Tell him.
- Okay, here's what you do.

463
00:18:55,918 --> 00:18:57,709
You send me a text,

464
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,001
but you accidentally
send it to her on purpose.

465
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:03,792
And in the text,
you say something like,

466
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:06,125
"Hey, Larry, you were an
asshole the other night.

467
00:19:06,126 --> 00:19:09,083
There's nothing wrong with
her water. It's perfectly okay."

468
00:19:09,084 --> 00:19:11,667
Say anything you want.
Curse me, anything. I don't care.

469
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:13,959
Okay, I've never said
this to you before.

470
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,584
- Yeah.
- You're brilliant.

471
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:17,292
- Thank you, thank you.
- Right, right?!

472
00:19:17,293 --> 00:19:19,292
I invented this.
I invented this.

473
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:20,417
He already did it for me.

474
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:21,876
"Dear Larry..."

475
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:24,125
- I can say anything I want!
- Anything!

476
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:25,834
"Larry, you were so out of line

477
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:27,409
the other night
about the water."

478
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:27,800
Yes!

479
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,500
"If Marilyn didn't throw
you out, I would've."

480
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,042
Perfect!

481
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,667
Damn it!

482
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:34,002
He's had some bad luck today.

483
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:38,208
All right, there we go.

484
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:39,709
- Oh, that's nice.
- Here it comes.

485
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,834
- All right.
- Hey, where do you lie?

486
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,167
Uh, four.

487
00:19:43,168 --> 00:19:44,333
Look!

488
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:46,208
She texted me right back.

489
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:47,751
"I love you.

490
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,751
I know this is
not meant for me.

491
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:53,334
What a great man to stick
up for me like that."

492
00:19:54,752 --> 00:19:56,001
- Unbelievable.
- Thank you.

493
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:57,250
- Unbelievable.
- Huh?

494
00:19:57,251 --> 00:19:59,167
- Brilliant!
- Get the flag, Jeff?

495
00:19:59,168 --> 00:20:00,500
Yep.

496
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:02,001
Well, you're
playing great today.

497
00:20:02,002 --> 00:20:03,460
No, I'm having a bad day.

498
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:06,333
Beautiful.

499
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,167
- Oh!
- Beautiful!

500
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:09,292
Oh!

501
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,834
- Is that a birdie?
- Beautiful.

502
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,375
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, guys, I hate to do this.

503
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:15,375
I got a medical emergency.
I gotta get to Cedars.

504
00:20:15,376 --> 00:20:18,542
- We only have three more holes.
- No, we got a medical emergency here.

505
00:20:18,543 --> 00:20:20,001
Wait, wait.
What are you talking about?

506
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:21,417
You owe me $200. Pay up.

507
00:20:21,418 --> 00:20:23,208
It's an emergency.
I'm a doctor.

508
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:24,709
You weren't a doctor
on the plane.

509
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:26,417
I gotta go.
A patient needs me.

510
00:20:26,418 --> 00:20:29,375
Oh, boy, you're down
three with three to play.

511
00:20:29,376 --> 00:20:33,375
Oh, so when you're losing money,
you heed the call, is that it?

512
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:34,709
You know what that is?

513
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,876
Selective heeding,
that's what that is!

514
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:38,625
You didn't get
any text anyway.

515
00:20:38,626 --> 00:20:39,752
It was all bullshit!

516
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:48,959
- Enigma?
- What the fuck?!

517
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,125
Whoa! Oh!

518
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,709
- Jesus Christ!
- God!

519
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,751
Crazy!

520
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:57,667
It's just perfume.

521
00:20:57,668 --> 00:21:00,959
...out of nowhere,
right in my face, spritzing me.

522
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,292
- They're the worst.
- Come on, what is that? What a violation.

523
00:21:03,293 --> 00:21:04,917
You know what, they'll
usually go away, though,

524
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,083
if you just
wave them away.

525
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:09,375
- Did you wave her away?
- Sort of, yeah.

526
00:21:09,376 --> 00:21:11,417
Here, do you like
this color?

527
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,292
- Yeah, yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

528
00:21:13,293 --> 00:21:15,250
- All right, let's try these.
- Okay.

529
00:21:15,251 --> 00:21:17,333
By the way, I wanted
to let you know

530
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:20,792
I was very impressed that you said
something about the water the other day.

531
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:22,876
Well, thank you for saying so.

532
00:21:22,877 --> 00:21:24,751
It's hard to, you know,
get in front of a group

533
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:27,584
and... and say what everyone's
thinking when it's uncomfortable.

534
00:21:27,585 --> 00:21:29,542
You know, I had no problem.

535
00:21:29,543 --> 00:21:32,250
Now, I got you 32 and 30.

536
00:21:32,251 --> 00:21:34,459
- Okay.
- What do you wanna start with?

537
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,459
- Eh, 32.
- All right.

538
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,125
- Here's the 32.
- These look very nice, yeah.

539
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:41,001
All right.

540
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,501
Oh, okay.

541
00:22:12,501 --> 00:22:14,292
Yeah, he's in the kitchen.

542
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:16,168
- Look who's here.
- Hey.

543
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:19,500
Oh, for God's sake.

544
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:20,834
Look at this.

545
00:22:20,835 --> 00:22:22,834
My lace just broke.

546
00:22:22,835 --> 00:22:26,167
You... and you know what, there's
no extra laces in the house.

547
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:28,125
Do you have extra laces
in your house?

548
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:29,709
No, nobody does.

549
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:31,542
I don't know why people
don't stock up on them.

550
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:33,375
- They stock up on canned food.
- Hey, we got a problem.

551
00:22:33,376 --> 00:22:37,709
Marilyn told me she saw
you in Neiman Marcus

552
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,542
- push the spritz girl.
- Of course I did.

553
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:42,375
What do you mean
of course you did?

554
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:44,001
I got attacked and I pushed.

555
00:22:44,002 --> 00:22:45,125
You don't push
a spritzer lady!

556
00:22:45,126 --> 00:22:46,792
You're out of your
fucking mind!

557
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:48,250
It's a violation!
You don't just go up to people

558
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:50,001
and spritz them
in the face like that.

559
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:51,125
It's a violation.

560
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:53,333
We have a very big problem now.

561
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:56,001
Marilyn is not
happy with you.

562
00:22:56,002 --> 00:22:57,709
You know what I gotta do now?

563
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,542
I gotta go through and rewind...

564
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:02,042
Let's hold on to that
thought for a minute, okay?

565
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:03,083
I think I could fix this.

566
00:23:03,084 --> 00:23:04,625
Will you listen to me, please?

567
00:23:04,626 --> 00:23:06,375
- You wet the end...
- I don't care about that.

568
00:23:06,376 --> 00:23:07,834
...and you just do this.

569
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:09,417
Marilyn said to me

570
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:11,042
I have to make a choice.

571
00:23:11,043 --> 00:23:13,375
It's either Larry David
or Marilyn.

572
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:14,584
She gave you an ultimatum?

573
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:17,042
An ultimatum.

574
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:19,042
- Who'd you pick?
- I took Marilyn.

575
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:20,876
I would've made
the same decision.

576
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:22,792
Let's face it,
at this point in our lives,

577
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:25,625
it's... it's not so easy to find
people to have sex with us.

578
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,959
Hey, vagina always wins.

579
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,876
I lost a brother to a vagina.

580
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:32,375
He's quite a feminist,
isn't he?

581
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:34,709
Vagina got his ass.

582
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,333
Goodbye.

583
00:23:36,334 --> 00:23:38,542
So, if I run into you,
are you gonna talk to me

584
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,834
or is this... this is the last
words we're ever gonna exchange?

585
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,917
I can't talk to you anymore.
I'm gonna miss you.

586
00:23:42,918 --> 00:23:44,917
So, when I see you at the
club dinner tomorrow night,

587
00:23:44,918 --> 00:23:47,333
- no communication there whatsoever?
- She said to me,

588
00:23:47,334 --> 00:23:49,667
"If you communicate
with him, I'm gone."

589
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:53,709
Oh, hey, LD,
that Sophia Loren.

590
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,250
- Whoo!
- You saw her movie?

591
00:23:55,251 --> 00:23:57,417
Mm-hmm.
"Marriage Italian Style."

592
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,333
- Three times.
- I told you, right?

593
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,500
- Gorgeous.
- Gorgeous. Fuckin' beautiful.

594
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:03,917
Yeah. Oh, jeez.

595
00:24:03,918 --> 00:24:05,042
Ugh, my pants are ready.

596
00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,542
Now I gotta go see that Rhonda.

597
00:24:06,543 --> 00:24:08,917
- Something up with that girl.
- Mm-hmm.

598
00:24:08,918 --> 00:24:11,083
This woman likes me.
Lewis's date.

599
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:13,167
- How do you know?
- Well, she was quite taken

600
00:24:13,168 --> 00:24:15,417
with my water stance
the other night

601
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:17,751
and she wouldn't get out
of the dressing room

602
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:19,792
- when I... when I was changing.
- She likes you.

603
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:23,250
Yeah, and I gotta go back there
tomorrow to pick up my pants.

604
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:26,001
- You gonna hit it?
- No, I'm a loyal friend.

605
00:24:26,002 --> 00:24:27,792
When women give me
an ultimatum,

606
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:31,125
"Who are you gonna choose,
me or your friend?"

607
00:24:31,126 --> 00:24:33,125
I say, "I'm gonna
choose my friend."

608
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:35,250
- That's it.
- Why do you have to do this?

609
00:24:35,251 --> 00:24:37,125
You dumped me.
You chose somebody over me.

610
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,459
- I didn't dump anyone.
- Okay.

611
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,459
I'm trying to say goodbye
and end this.

612
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,751
Okay, goodbye.

613
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:44,876
See ya. See ya, Leon.

614
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:47,333
- All right, get out.
- Don't keep talking.

615
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:49,001
- You're standing there.
- I'm leaving.

616
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:51,125
- Okay, well, go.
- Okay, I'm gonna leave.

617
00:24:51,126 --> 00:24:53,709
- I'm waiting.
- We're not playing last word.

618
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,042
- No.
- One, two, three.

619
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:57,293
- Bye.
- Bye.

620
00:24:58,626 --> 00:25:00,876
- One, two, three.
- Bye...

621
00:25:00,877 --> 00:25:03,208
- "Ay."
- No, don't do that.

622
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,126
Goodbye.

623
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:12,042
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey.

624
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,500
I got your pants.
You're all paid for.

625
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:15,083
Oh, great, great.

626
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:16,292
All right,
now we just try them on.

627
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:18,625
- Come on.
- Oh, um,

628
00:25:18,626 --> 00:25:20,292
I... I don't need
to try them on.

629
00:25:20,293 --> 00:25:22,459
- I can just, you know.
- Larry, you gotta try them on.

630
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,125
They got shortened.
We gotta see if they're...

631
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:26,042
That's not necessary.
I'll just take them.

632
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:27,876
It's just gonna take a minute.
We'll be good.

633
00:25:27,877 --> 00:25:29,375
I actually changed my mind about...
I didn't want the pants.

634
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:31,042
These pants look
amazing on you.

635
00:25:31,043 --> 00:25:33,208
- Come on.
- It's not really necessary.

636
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:36,002
- I don't need to try on the pants...
- Larry, you're trying on pants.

637
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:38,293
Right.

638
00:25:41,501 --> 00:25:43,500
I think these
lay great.

639
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,042
- Do you like that break on your sneaker?
- Yeah. Yeah.

640
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,709
I think that looks good.

641
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,709
I think it's pretty...
oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

642
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,668
We have a new tailor.
He does amazing work.

643
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:57,877
I think that looks
pretty good.

644
00:25:59,043 --> 00:26:00,418
Yeah, yeah.

645
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:03,959
And the hem is right.

646
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,376
I think that looks good.

647
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:11,083
Oh, my God!

648
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:12,208
- Oh!
- Larry!

649
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:14,709
- Oh! Oh, I'm... no!
- Oh!

650
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,375
No! That's not from you.

651
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:18,208
That... that's from
Sophia Loren.

652
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,167
Why was it in my face?

653
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:22,792
Because it was an accident!
It was an accidental erection.

654
00:26:22,793 --> 00:26:24,125
- What?
- It was an accident.

655
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:26,125
No, an accident
is tripping on a step,

656
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,375
and then also the
Titanic going down.

657
00:26:28,376 --> 00:26:32,125
Yeah, but just the way the Titanic
went down, this thing went up.

658
00:26:32,126 --> 00:26:35,250
It's the same, it's the same thing.
They're both accidents.

659
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:37,667
So, you're saying your penis
is like the Titanic?

660
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:40,333
In a manner of speaking, yes.
I think they're, they're comparable.

661
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,751
This is... this is
really unprofessional.

662
00:26:42,752 --> 00:26:44,834
- I'm very uncomfortable right now.
- Oh, this is unprofessional?

663
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:46,917
You think I'm comfortable when
you're standing in the dressing room

664
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:48,250
when I'm changing my pants?

665
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:50,125
It's called a concierge service.

666
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:51,959
I've never heard of that
before in my life.

667
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,959
I'd like you to leave, Larry.

668
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,001
- I'll go, yeah.
- Yeah.

669
00:26:55,002 --> 00:26:56,751
Okay. May...
may I have my pants?

670
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:57,752
Here.

671
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:03,959
You know, I gotta say,
the waist is a little big.

672
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,417
Get out.

673
00:27:05,418 --> 00:27:08,417
I'll wear them with a belt.
I'll put a belt on.

674
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,959
What's the score?

675
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,543
14-7.

676
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:19,542
This Dr. Winocur
I was telling you about?

677
00:27:19,543 --> 00:27:21,083
So, get a load of this.

678
00:27:21,084 --> 00:27:23,459
"Hi, Mrs. Downing,
it's Dr. Winocur.

679
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,876
Even though I had to cut
my round of golf short,

680
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,792
I'm glad I saw you
the other day.

681
00:27:27,793 --> 00:27:30,792
Be sure to take all the
medicine as I prescribed it."

682
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:34,792
- Another accidental...
- Text on purpose.

683
00:27:34,793 --> 00:27:36,417
- Wow. Unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

684
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:37,709
This is some doctor.

685
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,500
They should take
this guy's license away.

686
00:27:39,501 --> 00:27:41,459
He was on a plane, there was
an emergency, he didn't help out.

687
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:44,751
Person fucking choking, having pains
in their chest, you get the fuck up.

688
00:27:44,752 --> 00:27:47,459
- You've sworn to a Hippocratic Oath.
- Sworn to it. Get the fuck up.

689
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,333
Unless they got diarrhea
or some shit like that.

690
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,584
If they announced that, "Hey,
we've got a passenger who has diarrhea

691
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:54,667
and it's uncontrollable and it's
all over the fucking place,"

692
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:57,959
I can see the person sitting there and,
"Actually, fuck that.

693
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,793
I don't feel like dealing
with diarrhea right now."

694
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,459
I think you're gonna
have a good time.

695
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,167
I hope so.

696
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,001
I like that outfit you wore.
I really do.

697
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:24,877
There's Larry.

698
00:28:30,752 --> 00:28:32,876
Just go inside. Ignore him.
Do not give him attention.

699
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,543
Ignore him?
That's a 14-foot-long cock.

700
00:28:40,668 --> 00:28:42,584
- Hey, pervert.
- Hey.

701
00:28:42,585 --> 00:28:46,500
So you get an erection in the
dressing room with Rhonda.

702
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:49,083
- How lovely.
- No, Leon sent me a video of an old

703
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:51,709
Sophia Loren movie from the '60s,
and that's what caused it.

704
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,042
Rhonda had nothing
to do with it.

705
00:28:53,043 --> 00:28:54,792
- Leon sent you a movie...
- Yes, yeah.

706
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:56,292
You know how these things happen.

707
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:58,625
- They... they just occur.
- Oh, they just occur?

708
00:28:58,626 --> 00:29:02,709
Just like you drew a giant cock
on the side of your car.

709
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,375
He drew a penis on my car?

710
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:05,542
- Fuckin' A...
- My God!

711
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:07,042
...it's 12 feet long.

712
00:29:07,043 --> 00:29:09,001
- This guy's unbelievable.
- Who? What guy?

713
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,709
I don't know. I'm having
a fight with this guy.

714
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,751
He's drawing stuff
on my car, messages.

715
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,542
He's telling me
to wash it, and...

716
00:29:14,543 --> 00:29:16,584
Oh, I don't know what
you're fucking talking about.

717
00:29:16,585 --> 00:29:17,583
Now he drew a penis...

718
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:19,083
What, did you co-write
"Alice in Wonderland"?

719
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:21,167
- You're a fucking nutcase.
- Oh, you think I'm making that up?

720
00:29:21,168 --> 00:29:23,208
You think I go around
drawing penises on my car?

721
00:29:23,209 --> 00:29:26,459
- I'd have to be in Bellevue.
- She gave me an ultimatum.

722
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,375
It's either you or her.

723
00:29:28,376 --> 00:29:30,083
Funkhouser's girlfriend
did the same thing.

724
00:29:30,084 --> 00:29:32,292
I know. Everybody has heard
about it, believe me.

725
00:29:32,293 --> 00:29:34,167
Who'd you choose?

726
00:29:34,168 --> 00:29:36,083
- I chose her.
- Huh.

727
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:40,584
So, listen, just stay away
from my girlfriend.

728
00:29:40,585 --> 00:29:41,709
Girlfriend?

729
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,792
Oh, dear.
Premature girlfriend.

730
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:45,834
- Oh, no, I know... no, no, no.
- Listen, Richard,

731
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,792
you know what, I think we're just
looking for other things right now.

732
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:50,709
I call everybody girlfriend.
It's a thing of mine.

733
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,459
Hi, girlfriend.
Girlfriend, hi.

734
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,876
Honey! Honey, come on.

735
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,625
- Please, come on.
- Oh, this is nice.

736
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:59,667
Oh, well, well.

737
00:29:59,668 --> 00:30:01,083
- Look who's here.
- Hey, Larry.

738
00:30:01,084 --> 00:30:02,667
- You remember Bebe.
- Hi.

739
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:05,667
- Oh, my, hi. Who could forget Bebe?
- Good to see you.

740
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:07,333
We hit it off at baggage claim.

741
00:30:07,334 --> 00:30:09,208
You hit it off
at baggage claim.

742
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:11,292
- What a beautiful story.
- Yeah.

743
00:30:11,293 --> 00:30:14,959
By the way, I got that, uh,
"accidental text" you sent me.

744
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,250
I didn't send you a text.

745
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:18,083
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I think you know you did.

746
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:20,500
- Oh, I sent one to Laura Downing.
- Oh, yeah.

747
00:30:20,501 --> 00:30:22,459
- Larry David.
- David. The Ds.

748
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,001
- Yeah, yeah.
- They're very close, they...

749
00:30:25,002 --> 00:30:27,709
Yeah, it was an accident, Larry.
Trust me, please.

750
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,625
- And, Bebe...
- Mm-hmm.

751
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:33,250
I would be remiss if I didn't
inquire about your condition.

752
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:35,125
You know, every day
is a struggle.

753
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:38,042
- Mmm.
- But today, I'm doing good, thank you.

754
00:30:38,043 --> 00:30:39,168
Good to hear.

755
00:30:40,585 --> 00:30:43,167
Are you sure that was
an accidental text?

756
00:30:43,168 --> 00:30:44,710
Yeah, I'm sure.

757
00:30:46,585 --> 00:30:49,167
Are you sure you have
a bladder condition?

758
00:30:49,168 --> 00:30:51,126
Yeah, I'm sure.

759
00:31:06,376 --> 00:31:07,710
Okay.

760
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:11,333
- Come on, Bebe.
- Yeah.

761
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:13,292
Welcome, everyone.

762
00:31:13,293 --> 00:31:15,167
Thank you for
coming to celebrate

763
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:17,500
Tip McDougal's
25 years on the links.

764
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:19,208
We're gonna start
in just a couple minutes,

765
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,208
so, uh, you know,
have a drink,

766
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:22,709
relax, make yourself
comfortable.

767
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,375
We'll be back
in just a couple.

768
00:31:24,376 --> 00:31:25,792
- Hey, everyone.
- Hey!

769
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,709
So, what the fuck
with the penis on your car?

770
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,876
I don't know. I think somebody
on my block drew it.

771
00:31:29,877 --> 00:31:31,208
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

772
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:32,709
- That is so inappropriate.
- Oh, God.

773
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,876
Hi, Richie.

774
00:31:33,877 --> 00:31:35,125
- Hey.
- How you doing?

775
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,876
- Where's Rhonda?
- She left.

776
00:31:37,877 --> 00:31:40,625
Huh. You did the
premature girlfriend.

777
00:31:40,626 --> 00:31:41,959
You can't say "girlfriend"

778
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,751
until you've dated
somebody 12, 15 times.

779
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:48,417
Yeah. Marilyn, am I right?
It's gotta be...

780
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:51,250
Yeah, yeah. Ah.

781
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:54,543
Hey, Funk Man, would you, uh...
would you mind passing the bread this way?

782
00:31:56,793 --> 00:31:58,834
Would you mind asking Marty
to pass the bread?

783
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:01,250
Marty, please pass me the bread.
I'm famished.

784
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:02,751
Marilyn, just for tonight,

785
00:32:02,752 --> 00:32:04,584
would... could you
give him an exemption

786
00:32:04,585 --> 00:32:07,333
from the no-talking rule
that you've imposed?

787
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:07,767
No.

788
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:10,167
Just for tonight so we
can all have some fun.

789
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:11,250
- No.
- We're at the same table...

790
00:32:11,251 --> 00:32:12,918
Exemption denied.

791
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:15,877
Okay.

792
00:32:18,084 --> 00:32:19,834
Hey, this is fun, huh?

793
00:32:19,835 --> 00:32:21,333
I'm having the time of my life.

794
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:22,834
This is really a blast.

795
00:32:22,835 --> 00:32:24,417
Too bad we're gonna
have to leave early.

796
00:32:24,418 --> 00:32:26,333
I gotta pack. San Francisco.

797
00:32:26,334 --> 00:32:29,125
And Jeff's driving me
to the airport, you know.

798
00:32:29,126 --> 00:32:33,333
Think I was gonna buy that
bullshit accidental text?

799
00:32:33,334 --> 00:32:35,834
"Oh, I love my wife so much

800
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,751
and... and I'll miss
the football game."

801
00:32:37,752 --> 00:32:41,250
You think I bought that
"accidental text on purpose"?

802
00:32:41,251 --> 00:32:44,375
What... what is an accidental
text on purpose?

803
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:45,959
You send somebody a text,

804
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,292
pretending it to be
to somebody else

805
00:32:48,293 --> 00:32:51,625
so they think they're
reading a private text.

806
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:52,959
But, really,
what they're trying to do

807
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,625
is give you the information

808
00:32:54,626 --> 00:32:56,417
that they want to
manipulate you with.

809
00:32:56,418 --> 00:32:58,293
- It's bullshit.
- Huh.

810
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:04,459
Did you send me an
accidental text on purpose?

811
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,959
Oh...

812
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,126
You did.
That was a bullshit text.

813
00:33:09,326 --> 00:33:10,625
I... I don't remember that.

814
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:12,375
Do you like my water?

815
00:33:12,376 --> 00:33:15,167
I... you know, I really don't...
I don't remember doing that.

816
00:33:15,168 --> 00:33:17,334
Do you like my water?

817
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:24,459
I can't stand your water.

818
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,250
I can't...
I don't even know what to say.

819
00:33:27,251 --> 00:33:30,751
It's like I took a straw
and put it in a frog's ass.

820
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:32,333
It makes me sick!

821
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:34,542
I wanna barf every
time I get near it.

822
00:33:34,543 --> 00:33:38,001
I can't stand the smell,
I can't stand the color,

823
00:33:38,002 --> 00:33:40,542
and I cannot stand the taste.

824
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:42,835
I can't take it anymore!

825
00:33:44,251 --> 00:33:47,002
You know what,
talk to him all you want.

826
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:51,375
Wow, you're the only guy
at this table

827
00:33:51,376 --> 00:33:52,877
that could hold on to a woman.

828
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:58,250
Thank you, everyone,
for coming tonight

829
00:33:58,251 --> 00:34:01,709
to honor Tip McDougal
and his lovely wife, Nancy.

830
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,709
We're losing a beloved member
of the Ocean View family.

831
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,042
- Aw.
- Tip, we'll miss you.

832
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:12,792
But in retirement, maybe Tip will
finally be able to play some golf.

833
00:34:12,793 --> 00:34:16,001
We had so many
great times with Tip

834
00:34:16,002 --> 00:34:18,417
and some rough ones, too.

835
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:20,543
But he was mostly on the fairway.

836
00:34:22,543 --> 00:34:25,333
I remember one time on the
18th hole, he had knocked...

837
00:34:25,334 --> 00:34:29,001
Larry, I hate to even bother you
with this, but I'm on in two minutes.

838
00:34:29,002 --> 00:34:32,709
This guy just took my joke.
Can you help me out?

839
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:35,001
What are you talking about?
This is a comedy emergency.

840
00:34:35,002 --> 00:34:38,001
- I'm off duty.
- Why won't you help me?

841
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:40,083
You didn't heed the
call on the plane.

842
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:41,834
You welched on a $200 bet.

843
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:43,876
You sent me an accidental
text on purpose.

844
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:46,375
I invented the
accidental text, okay?

845
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,752
Yeah, go back to your table.
Get out. Go back.

846
00:34:51,251 --> 00:34:52,584
And, you...

847
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:53,917
You've been drinking
water all night,

848
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,333
haven't made one trip
to the bathroom.

849
00:34:55,334 --> 00:34:56,876
Not one trip.
I've been clocking you.

850
00:34:56,877 --> 00:34:59,459
Sir. Sir!
I have a condition.

851
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,417
Yeah, you have
a condition, all right.

852
00:35:01,418 --> 00:35:03,917
You're a psychopath who uses a weak
bladder to take advantage of people.

853
00:35:03,918 --> 00:35:07,042
But first,
the funniest doc on the links,

854
00:35:07,043 --> 00:35:10,585
Dr. Nathan Winocur.

855
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:13,834
Come on up here.

856
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:15,251
You're gonna love this guy.

857
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:33,001
Larry.

858
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:35,876
Hey. It's Dave.

859
00:35:35,877 --> 00:35:37,876
- Oh! Hey.
- Three houses down.

860
00:35:37,877 --> 00:35:39,459
- How are you?
- Yeah, yeah, good, good.

861
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,208
It's really good
to see you here, Larry.

862
00:35:41,209 --> 00:35:42,667
Yeah, good...
good to see you.

863
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:45,125
Yeah. I love the car wash.

864
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,083
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- Right?

865
00:35:47,084 --> 00:35:49,792
It's just endlessly
fascinating, you know?

866
00:35:49,793 --> 00:35:51,459
It comes down on a conveyer,

867
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,459
the brushes, the water.

868
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,250
- You feel like you wanna go through it.
- That's right.

869
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:56,834
- You know?
- That's exactly right.

870
00:35:56,835 --> 00:36:00,459
I look at a dirty car, Larry,
and I feel sorry for it.

871
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:02,625
It's almost like
it's screaming out,

872
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:04,293
"Wash me!

873
00:36:05,626 --> 00:36:07,584
Wash me."

874
00:36:07,585 --> 00:36:09,668
- Good to see you, Larry.
- Yeah.
