1
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:24,846
Uh-huh.

2
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,052
Come on.

3
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:35,511
I can't look at that.
Take it away.

4
00:00:35,512 --> 00:00:37,845
Hey, I'm trying to work.

5
00:00:37,846 --> 00:00:39,428
Sorry, what's your problem?

6
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,177
No one wants to see this.
It's very disturbing.

7
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:43,845
Two people aren't
allowed to be happy?

8
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:45,302
Well, you're allowed to be happy,

9
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:47,136
but not in front of me,
so let's move it down.

10
00:00:47,137 --> 00:00:48,678
- Okay.
- All right.

11
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,053
Good. Thank you.

12
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,761
Uh, excuse me, Señor Larry.

13
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:57,678
All the lights in here and in
the hallway, they're all fixed.

14
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:59,845
You no have no more humming,
no more vibrating.

15
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:02,094
- Everything is fixed.
- Oh! Cesar, thank you so much.

16
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,219
That was driving me crazy,
that humming.

17
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,428
Anything else you need
from me, you give me a call

18
00:01:06,429 --> 00:01:08,344
and I'll come here and
fix it right away, okay?

19
00:01:08,345 --> 00:01:09,721
Oh, hey, Cesar.

20
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:12,935
That's for you.

21
00:01:12,936 --> 00:01:15,136
Oh. Oh, no, no, Señor Larry.
I cannot accept that money.

22
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:16,845
This is my job.
This is what I do.

23
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:18,928
It's a little bonus for you,
a little extra. Take it.

24
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:22,011
Oh, it means...
it means a lot to me, Mr. Larry,

25
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:23,553
but I cannot take this.

26
00:01:23,554 --> 00:01:25,428
I... I just don't
feel comfortable.

27
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:27,636
This is what I do, sir.

28
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:31,344
Oh, Cesar, this is...
this is unprecedented!

29
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:34,553
This is rarer than a man turning
down sex, what you've just done.

30
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:36,094
It just...
it doesn't happen!

31
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,261
Okay, Señor Larry.

32
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:40,094
I've never turned down
sex in my life.

33
00:01:40,095 --> 00:01:41,803
Me neither.

34
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:45,594
Huh! Cesar, this will not
be forgotten anytime soon.

35
00:01:45,595 --> 00:01:47,971
- Have a nice day.
- Very commendable.

36
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:51,469
So now, for some reason,

37
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,928
Funkhouser's gotten back
together with this woman.

38
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,094
- I don't know why. She hates my guts.
- Aww.

39
00:01:56,095 --> 00:01:58,261
But nevertheless,
he wants to go to brunch

40
00:01:58,262 --> 00:02:01,886
and see if we can all get along, you
know, so it's gonna be very awkward.

41
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:03,469
Just because of the tap water?

42
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,302
- Tap water, yes. Tap water.
- Wow.

43
00:02:06,303 --> 00:02:08,094
Hey, Eddie, breakfast!

44
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:09,094
Wow, tap water.

45
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,136
Here you go, sweetie.

46
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:11,386
Wow, look at the
young man today!

47
00:02:11,387 --> 00:02:13,094
Very nice hoodie you got there.

48
00:02:13,095 --> 00:02:14,928
Mom, you're still
dating this guy?

49
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,553
- Yes, honey...
- Yes, and she's enjoying it very much.

50
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,469
- Take your toast.
- Where's the butter?

51
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,886
It's right there, quite visible.

52
00:02:21,887 --> 00:02:24,594
I can't see the butter.
Do it again.

53
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:26,845
He needs to see the butter.

54
00:02:26,846 --> 00:02:29,303
I'll eat this one and I'll
make you another one.

55
00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:34,052
- Are you two having sex?
- That's Mommy's business.

56
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,344
It's not really your business,
but to tell you the truth,

57
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:38,636
it's imminent, okay?

58
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:39,929
Gross.

59
00:02:42,012 --> 00:02:44,386
Sorry, he's really been
having a tough time lately.

60
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:46,469
I... I don't know how you let him
get away with that toast thing.

61
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,094
This kid needs some structure in
his life. He needs some discipline!

62
00:02:49,095 --> 00:02:50,886
- I know, I know.
- You're not tough enough.

63
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:53,553
I... I know. There's this
private school, and, uh...

64
00:02:53,554 --> 00:02:57,469
I've been thinking about sending him,
but it's really tough to get into, and...

65
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,928
I wanted to ask you a question.

66
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:01,219
Please say no if this
is at all inappropriate,

67
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,553
but Susie happened to mention this
very same school, Pemberton Academy,

68
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:06,011
where I'm trying to get him in.

69
00:03:06,012 --> 00:03:08,011
You had donated some
"Seinfeld" stuff there.

70
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:10,553
My assistant takes care of
all that. I just, you know.

71
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,585
Okay, I just didn't know
if you knew somebody, or...

72
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:13,886
Nah, I really don't.

73
00:03:13,887 --> 00:03:16,469
- That's fine, that's fine.
- If I could help, I would, but I don't know.

74
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,387
You know, I feel weird about sending
him to boarding school anyway.

75
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:23,469
- Boarding school?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,928
- How far away is it?
- It's about an hour and a half.

77
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:29,886
I actually think it would be the best
for him, but it would be hard for me

78
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,678
- just to be rattling around...
- I completely agree with you.

79
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,511
I think it would be
a fantastic thing for him.

80
00:03:33,512 --> 00:03:36,136
- Do you, really?
- It's gotta be the... you know what?

81
00:03:36,137 --> 00:03:39,177
Get me a name, get me a number...
whatever I can do to help.

82
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,261
- No.
- Yes!

83
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,261
Give me some information,
done!

84
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:44,386
That's really nice
of you, Larry.

85
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:46,970
Thank you so much.
It's gonna be so good for him.

86
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:52,095
Look, if I can send him an hour and a
half away, I'm... more than happy to.

87
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,011
- If I got those glasses...
- Yeah?

88
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:58,886
We'd be...
we'd be twins.

89
00:03:58,887 --> 00:04:00,928
That would be kind of hideous,
wouldn't it?

90
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:03,386
Have you ever seen a couple
with the same glasses?

91
00:04:03,387 --> 00:04:05,803
By the way, when I say couple,
I'm not referring to us as a couple.

92
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:08,720
- Yeah, excuse me. What are you... hold on.
- No, no, I'm not going there.

93
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:11,886
We're... I... you have not
bought me the same glasses.

94
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:15,219
We don't have it like
that just yet, my friend.

95
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,428
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

96
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:17,553
Can I bring you some water
while you wait?

97
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:19,177
Still or sparkling?

98
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:21,386
- Sparkling. Yeah.
- Yeah, sparkling.

99
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,886
Ugh, boy, I can't tell you,
I'm so relieved.

100
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:26,845
Thanks again for helping me out
with the boarding school thing.

101
00:04:26,846 --> 00:04:29,302
So, before I call the, um...

102
00:04:29,303 --> 00:04:31,761
- Pemberton.
- Pemberton, yes. Pemberton.

103
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:36,094
Do they... do they know
about the, uh, Asperger's?

104
00:04:36,095 --> 00:04:38,302
Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.
Yeah, they're a great school.

105
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:42,886
They're... they can... they're just equipped
to handle all kinds of special kids.

106
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:45,428
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

107
00:04:45,429 --> 00:04:48,845
Has he been diagnosed by a doctor,
or is this your opinion?

108
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:53,177
He's on the spectrum. Yeah.

109
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:54,970
How do you know?

110
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:58,761
You can see in his behavior and what
people have said, and, you know...

111
00:04:58,762 --> 00:05:00,428
he's, you know...

112
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:04,220
he's been diagnosed
on the... on the spectrum.

113
00:05:07,303 --> 00:05:08,428
Okay.

114
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:10,345
Oh.

115
00:05:12,595 --> 00:05:14,553
- Hello?
- Señor Larry,

116
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:16,386
it's Cesar from the office.

117
00:05:16,387 --> 00:05:17,803
- Who?
- Cesar!

118
00:05:17,804 --> 00:05:20,177
You gave me the tip
and I didn't take it?

119
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:22,052
Yeah?

120
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:24,553
I'm here at the office building,
fixing a leak,

121
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:26,636
and I was just wondering,
after I'm done,

122
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:30,136
I could go to your office and watch
the Argentina and Mexico game.

123
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:33,386
It's a very important game. It's for...
to qualify in the World Cup.

124
00:05:33,387 --> 00:05:36,219
Why... why... why do you have
to go... why my office?

125
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,011
Because you got all
the channels, sir.

126
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:42,344
- Yeah... yeah, okay.
- Gracias, Señor Larry!

127
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:45,469
I will not forget this.
You are the man.

128
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,386
- Okay.
- Who's that?

129
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:51,011
- This handyman in my office building...
- Uh-huh.

130
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:54,219
...wants to go into my office
to watch a soccer game.

131
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,136
I offered him a tip,
but he didn't take the tip,

132
00:05:56,137 --> 00:05:59,720
so I feel like I'm a little
obligated to let him watch the game.

133
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,803
It's tricky.

134
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:02,636
- Hello!
- Oh, hey!

135
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:03,845
Sorry we're late.

136
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:04,886
- Hi, I'm Marilyn.
- LD.

137
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:06,302
- Hi!
- Hi, nice to meet you.

138
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:08,219
- Yes, hi.
- Hi. Marty Funkhouser.

139
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,011
- Hi, great to meet you.
- Great to meet you!

140
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:12,886
So, I... I just wanna say,
before we begin,

141
00:06:12,887 --> 00:06:17,177
I... I'd like to apologize
for what happened between us.

142
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:20,553
That is not a true
representation of who I am.

143
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,469
- Let's start fresh.
- That means a lot to me. Okay.

144
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,511
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes, let's do it.

145
00:06:24,512 --> 00:06:27,344
Some sparkling water
for the table?

146
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,136
No, no. We... no, we don't want that.
We want some tap water.

147
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,386
- You don't want sparkling?
- No, get that out of here. Tap.

148
00:06:33,387 --> 00:06:35,344
- Well, it's unfiltered.
- Better.

149
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:36,970
Water is water.
We're not water snobs.

150
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:38,386
- Very good.
- We don't care.

151
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:39,761
While you bring the tap,

152
00:06:39,762 --> 00:06:41,594
bring us the best
bottle of champagne

153
00:06:41,595 --> 00:06:43,219
you have in the house to drink.

154
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,803
Okay?

155
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,219
We're gonna live it up!

156
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,094
Yeah, you know, sure.

157
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:51,219
Thank you, Larry.
I really appreciate your apology.

158
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,219
- Oh, yes.
- No, it means a lot to me.

159
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,636
And some tap water for the table.

160
00:06:54,637 --> 00:06:56,302
Tap water for the table.
Look at this.

161
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:58,762
Look at this beautiful tap water.
We got some here...

162
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:05,803
- Ah, look at that.
- Mmm.

163
00:07:05,804 --> 00:07:07,303
Ah, it really looks good.

164
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,970
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, come on, buddy.

165
00:07:11,971 --> 00:07:13,469
- There's a line.
- There's a line.

166
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,636
You can't just walk up here.

167
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:16,511
Come on, man, you're being rude.

168
00:07:16,512 --> 00:07:19,094
- They're in line.
- You gotta get to the back, buddy.

169
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:22,094
- I'm just getting some potatoes.
- I don't care.

170
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,720
One... one minute!

171
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,803
One minute! Just a minute!

172
00:07:26,804 --> 00:07:28,136
Are you getting seconds?

173
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,761
Yes, sir.

174
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,428
The man is getting seconds.

175
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:33,386
- It doesn't matter.
- But that's not a rule.

176
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:36,511
The man has already
waited on this line.

177
00:07:36,512 --> 00:07:39,594
- Larry, we're hungry.
- We're all hungry.

178
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:40,761
I'm hungry, too!

179
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:42,219
But to make him wait

180
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,011
another 10 minutes for
a few measly potatoes?

181
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:48,302
- Shame on you! Shame on all of you!
- Okay.

182
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:50,803
That's not how we do things
here in America.

183
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,845
We don't wait for seconds!
Never, never wait for seconds!

184
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:57,302
It's fine, it's good. It's fine.

185
00:07:57,303 --> 00:08:00,636
Sir, I would be
proud to serve you.

186
00:08:00,637 --> 00:08:02,846
- What do you want?
- Potatoes.

187
00:08:04,929 --> 00:08:07,428
- Thank you. Thank you, sir.
- Sure, sure.

188
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:10,052
You're welcome.

189
00:08:10,053 --> 00:08:13,136
- It's okay, really.
- I didn't mean to overreact like that.

190
00:08:13,137 --> 00:08:15,302
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy yourself.

191
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:16,804
Thank you.
Thanks.

192
00:08:17,971 --> 00:08:19,261
Ah!

193
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:20,761
- Oh, I love that sound!
- All right!

194
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:24,469
- You like that?
- I love that sound!

195
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,386
I mean, the good thing here
is that if we want seconds,

196
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,136
- we go right to the front.
- Straight to the front.

197
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,470
- Right?
- Yep.

198
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:36,928
Boy, oh, boy. Ha, that's
a lot of ketchup there.

199
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,678
I like ketchup.

200
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,886
Yeah, uh, it seems
a little excessive, no?

201
00:08:41,887 --> 00:08:43,678
- Here we go!
- Living it up!

202
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,761
- Happiness, living it up! Okay?
- Cheers!

203
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,761
I mean, you use too much ketchup,
you know what happens?

204
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,261
They... they convert to packs,
to the little packets.

205
00:08:51,262 --> 00:08:54,011
Is there a ketchup shortage? Like,
"Oh, we're gonna run out of ketchup."

206
00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:56,011
I wasn't saying there's
a ketchup shortage,

207
00:08:56,012 --> 00:08:59,094
it's just that if everybody
uses as much ketchup as you do,

208
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,428
they would stop buying it.

209
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:02,845
As a matter of fact,
I think I need more ketchup.

210
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:03,679
Mmm.

211
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:07,386
- Wow.
- Hmm!

212
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:09,177
Why are we talking about this?

213
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:11,845
There's no way she could finish
all that ketchup. Is there?

214
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:13,345
Watch me!

215
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:17,553
Let's just change
the subject, okay?

216
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:18,886
Potatoes are delicious.

217
00:09:18,887 --> 00:09:20,219
- Huh.
- Yeah.

218
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,553
Oh, my God! Oh!

219
00:09:23,554 --> 00:09:25,511
- Oh, my God!
- Don't do that, don't do that.

220
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,052
Can we get a wet towel, somebody?

221
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:28,678
That's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

222
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,720
It's okay. Yeah, your
sweater covers it fine.

223
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:33,219
You know, I... I think I want...
I want to go home.

224
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,594
Oh, no!

225
00:09:34,595 --> 00:09:36,428
- It's just a really bad stain.
- Yeah, go.

226
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:38,136
- No, Larry, it's not that bad.
- You got a bad stain.

227
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:39,302
I'm gonna go home.

228
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:40,803
I'm just feeling
very uncomfortable.

229
00:09:40,804 --> 00:09:42,720
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, go.

230
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,386
It's a...
it's a really bad stain.

231
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:46,886
It's a "go home" stain,
you know what I mean?

232
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,720
- It was the fork.
- I think it was the ketchup.

233
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:51,052
- Let's not argue over this.
- I'm so sorry.

234
00:09:51,053 --> 00:09:53,886
It was lovely to meet you.
You seem lovely.

235
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,970
- Yeah, take her home.
- It's such a shame.

236
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,011
Nice job, once again.

237
00:09:58,012 --> 00:10:00,845
- One of those things.
- Gosh, another time, I guess.

238
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:02,428
- Bye.
- Bye.

239
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:04,803
Wow, I feel so bad.

240
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:06,553
That was a disgusting display.

241
00:10:06,554 --> 00:10:08,011
You couldn't let the ketchup go.

242
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:10,136
- Couldn't let it go.
- Oh, boy.

243
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:13,011
Guess what.

244
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,344
Who's paying
for the expensive champagne?

245
00:10:15,345 --> 00:10:17,262
- Oh.
- Yeah.

246
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:29,761
I want to thank you

247
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,428
for defending me
in front of the mob.

248
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:35,428
Oh, oh. Yes, of course.

249
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:38,594
That was, uh, terrible.
You had already waited.

250
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,386
What was the point
of going back again?

251
00:10:40,387 --> 00:10:42,302
You would've lost
your appetite.

252
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,303
I agree with you, Mr. David.

253
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,637
How do you know my name?

254
00:10:50,178 --> 00:10:52,970
I know everything about you.

255
00:10:52,971 --> 00:10:55,052
I was sitting there
having my brunch,

256
00:10:55,053 --> 00:10:57,803
and I saw you.

257
00:10:57,804 --> 00:11:01,511
And I was thinking,
as a devout Muslim,

258
00:11:01,512 --> 00:11:03,761
I should kill this man.

259
00:11:03,762 --> 00:11:05,094
Fatwa.

260
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:07,428
And then you defended me.

261
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:09,804
I thought to myself...

262
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,136
I cannot kill this man.

263
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:16,261
This man doesn't
deserve to die.

264
00:11:16,262 --> 00:11:19,094
No. No, I don't. I don't!

265
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:23,011
I do have some friends
in high positions.

266
00:11:23,012 --> 00:11:26,094
I think I need to bring
to their attention

267
00:11:26,095 --> 00:11:29,469
that you are not the man
they think you are.

268
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,970
Anything you want to know,
I'll give you full access.

269
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,594
I'm an open book.

270
00:11:33,595 --> 00:11:35,386
You will be hearing from me.

271
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,636
What... what is your name?

272
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:41,846
My name is not important.

273
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:46,761
- Hey!
- Oh, hey. Um...

274
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:49,845
- You okay?
- Yeah, I was just talking to this guy.

275
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:52,011
What guy?

276
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,386
Oh.

277
00:11:53,387 --> 00:11:55,845
Let's go.

278
00:11:55,846 --> 00:11:56,846
Huh.

279
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:01,720
That was a lot of fun.

280
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,302
That horse, he was so close!

281
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:05,177
- He should've won!
- I know, I know, I know.

282
00:12:05,178 --> 00:12:07,428
I know. I was...
I was excited for you.

283
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:11,136
By the way, this is... what are
we on? 10 hours now together?

284
00:12:11,137 --> 00:12:12,970
It's been incredibly fun.

285
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:15,136
And I can't believe

286
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:17,386
you made that appointment
at... at Pemberton.

287
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:18,845
I'm so grateful.

288
00:12:18,846 --> 00:12:21,720
Believe me, once I get through
with those Pemberton people,

289
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:24,052
they're gonna beg this kid
to go to that school.

290
00:12:24,053 --> 00:12:26,094
Do... do you wanna come in?

291
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,219
- Do I wanna come in?
- Mmm.

292
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:31,761
Because I'm feeling
pretty grateful.

293
00:12:31,762 --> 00:12:35,386
Are you saying that, uh...

294
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,511
gratitude sex is in the offing?

295
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,678
If you're okay with
gratitude sex, I mean...

296
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,678
You know what,
I've never had gratitude sex,

297
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,678
mainly because I've never done anything
that someone could be grateful for.

298
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,636
But people tell me that
gratitude sex is the ultimate.

299
00:12:49,637 --> 00:12:52,428
It's hard to explain.
I'd rather just show you.

300
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:53,636
- Sure, yeah.
- You know?

301
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:58,469
Hey, honey. Uh, I thought
Nancy put you to bed.

302
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,261
She did.

303
00:13:00,262 --> 00:13:03,428
Well, it's time for bed.
It's past your bedtime.

304
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:05,886
- It's past his bedtime.
- Hey, now.

305
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,803
Go to your room, okay?

306
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:11,303
I'll hang out in my room,
but I'm not going to bed.

307
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:15,219
I've never seen an old man
in sneakers before.

308
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,052
Okay, that's...
go to your room.

309
00:13:17,053 --> 00:13:18,594
That's so stupid.

310
00:13:18,595 --> 00:13:21,177
- Eddie! Go.
- That's a good one.

311
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:23,678
You know, it's... he's on
the spectrum. I'm sorry.

312
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:25,261
Ah, the spectrum.

313
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,970
He's on the spectrum. Yeah.

314
00:13:30,637 --> 00:13:32,636
Guess that's that.

315
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:34,845
He won't listen to me, but...

316
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:38,803
maybe you can...
you can get him to bed.

317
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,262
The offer still stands.

318
00:13:59,554 --> 00:14:01,886
All right,
you little prick, okay?

319
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:04,803
I got some gratitude sex coming to me,
and you're not gonna ruin it.

320
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,219
You got it?

321
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,302
Now get under those covers.

322
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:08,761
You're gonna go to sleep,

323
00:14:08,762 --> 00:14:10,470
and I'm gonna have sex
with your mother.

324
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:19,177
Hello.

325
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:22,177
You're looking at a man
with an "A" on his shirt...

326
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:23,302
for "apology."

327
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,928
- Is that so?
- Yes.

328
00:14:24,929 --> 00:14:26,594
I'm sorry for the other day.

329
00:14:26,595 --> 00:14:28,177
There was nothing I could do.

330
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:30,136
We had to leave, so I left.

331
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:32,553
Quite an expensive
bottle of champagne

332
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:33,803
I wound up paying for.

333
00:14:33,804 --> 00:14:35,136
We ordered the champagne

334
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:37,011
because you wanted
to live it up.

335
00:14:37,012 --> 00:14:39,511
You said, "Let's live it up."
I would never live it up.

336
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,011
I live it down,
I don't live it up.

337
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,928
Okay, maybe I said,
"Let's live it up."

338
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,011
- You did.
- I wanted to have a good time, that's all!

339
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:47,261
So anyway,
so you're here to what?

340
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,386
Apologize. I'm sorry!

341
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,177
For leaving me with the bill?

342
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:54,386
No, I'm sorry for leaving early.

343
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:55,928
That's what I'm sorry about.

344
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,845
I don't mind you leaving early,

345
00:14:57,846 --> 00:15:02,219
but I think the proper apology
would be to say, "I'm sorry.

346
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,386
Here's $250 for the champagne."

347
00:15:04,387 --> 00:15:06,886
- Okay?
- That's a cash apology.

348
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:08,511
My apology is from the heart.

349
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:10,386
That's something
that means something.

350
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:12,386
Why do you come to the office to
apologize without offering the money?

351
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:13,678
Because I felt bad!

352
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,803
If you feel bad,
you offer the money!

353
00:15:15,804 --> 00:15:17,720
- No, you don't!
- You don't understand feeling bad!

354
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:20,011
Feeling bad is feeling in
the heart, not in the wallet!

355
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:23,052
- No, feeling bad is making it up!
- It is not!

356
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:27,428
Well, to come here and apologize
without taking your wallet out

357
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,678
and offering, who knows
if I would even accept it?

358
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,052
There's not even an offer!

359
00:15:33,053 --> 00:15:34,594
Let's go to lunch, talk it over.

360
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:36,302
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay?

361
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,886
I gotta take a quick piss.

362
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,177
- Mr. Larry.
- Ah, Cesar.

363
00:15:41,178 --> 00:15:44,428
I want to thank you for offering
me to watch the game on your TV.

364
00:15:44,429 --> 00:15:46,261
Ah, well, you're very welcome.

365
00:15:46,262 --> 00:15:49,011
- But unfortunately, I couldn't make it.
- What?

366
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:52,261
Yeah, my wife, she wanted me to do
a bunch of chores in the house,

367
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:53,803
so I... I couldn't come.

368
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:56,428
I'm, uh... well, I'm sorry
to hear that. Too bad.

369
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:01,386
But, uh, you... you're a member
of a nice country club, sí?

370
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:02,187
Yeah?

371
00:16:02,188 --> 00:16:04,469
Can I bring my family there
for a nice little swim?

372
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,428
Little Cesar's like Aquaman.

373
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:10,386
No. No, you can't... you can't
bring your family there, no!

374
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,136
- But... but why not?
- It's not the way it works. No!

375
00:16:13,137 --> 00:16:15,136
I don't understand
your lack of generosity.

376
00:16:15,137 --> 00:16:16,845
Lack of generosity?
What are you talking about?

377
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:18,928
I gave you a tip,
which you turned down.

378
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:20,720
I did not take it,
so you owe me a favor.

379
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:24,136
I already repaid you a favor
that I didn't even owe you!

380
00:16:24,137 --> 00:16:27,636
The whole point of the tip
is for you to be indebted to me.

381
00:16:27,637 --> 00:16:29,553
Now you've...
you've reversed it!

382
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,678
Now I'm indebted to you.

383
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,344
You flipped it!
You flipped the tip!

384
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:33,679
I promised Little Cesar.

385
00:16:35,387 --> 00:16:37,428
All right.
This is the last one.

386
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,302
Okay? This is it.

387
00:16:39,303 --> 00:16:41,803
And next time I give you
a tip, you take it, okay?

388
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:44,469
- Okay, Mr. Larry.
- But the country club is out.

389
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,886
You can't swim there.
They're racist.

390
00:16:45,887 --> 00:16:47,136
They're not gonna
let you in there.

391
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:48,970
Why are you a member
of a racist club?

392
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:51,302
They're all racists.
That's the way they operate.

393
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:52,803
How about your pool?

394
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,177
Oh, I would,
but the heater in my house

395
00:16:55,178 --> 00:16:58,344
got all screwed up and nothing's
working now, and the pool's not working.

396
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:00,554
I bet you have friends
with nice pools.

397
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,720
Hey...

398
00:17:04,721 --> 00:17:06,302
your pool working?

399
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,344
Yeah.

400
00:17:07,345 --> 00:17:10,177
Can Cesar and his family
use your pool?

401
00:17:10,178 --> 00:17:12,553
- Who's Cesar?
- Yo.

402
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,052
Nice to meet you, Cesar.

403
00:17:14,053 --> 00:17:15,553
Nice to meet you, sir.

404
00:17:15,554 --> 00:17:16,970
Can he use my pool?

405
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:19,386
It's hot out, they have
no place to swim, and...

406
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:22,011
At this time of year,

407
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:23,803
we might have family coming over.

408
00:17:23,804 --> 00:17:26,720
- You know, I never know...
- I'll tell you what.

409
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:29,386
We call it even, the $250.

410
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:32,678
- So you're never gonna mention it again?
- Never again.

411
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:34,886
- When do you want to come over?
- On Saturday.

412
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,845
What time is good for you?
8:00 a.m.?

413
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:39,386
- Uh, let's make it 8:30.
- Thank you, sir.

414
00:17:39,387 --> 00:17:40,886
- Hey, do me a favor.
- Yes, sir.

415
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:43,886
No diving, and try to stay
in the shallow end, okay?

416
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:46,344
- That's his number.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Larry.

417
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:49,219
Little Cesar is
gonna be so happy.

418
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,679
Gracias.

419
00:17:53,429 --> 00:17:56,052
Larry David paid you
for your services?

420
00:17:56,053 --> 00:17:57,636
Hell, yeah, he did.

421
00:17:57,637 --> 00:17:59,928
But all he did was use me
to get in the carpool lane

422
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:02,052
so he can get to
the Dodger game.

423
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:06,720
So you're saying that, uh, your
encounter was not of sexual nature.

424
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:08,594
Hell, no!

425
00:18:08,595 --> 00:18:10,554
He could've had all this!

426
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:15,344
I still don't understand.

427
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,761
How can your father be a kamikaze
pilot when he's still alive?

428
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:22,428
He grazed the ship.

429
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:24,387
Grazed, but not fatal.

430
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:27,386
No.

431
00:18:27,387 --> 00:18:30,261
Then Larry was right.

432
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:32,594
So, Larry David went
on a date with you

433
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,094
and carried you upstairs?

434
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,261
Yeah. I didn't want him to.

435
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:38,845
- Oh, he insisted?
- Yes.

436
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:41,928
You know, I wasn't the only girl
in a wheelchair he was dating.

437
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,761
So, he went out with two
different women with disability?

438
00:18:45,762 --> 00:18:47,594
At least.

439
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:49,137
Commendable.

440
00:18:51,095 --> 00:18:52,803
I'd see Larry occasionally.

441
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:56,386
I guess you would say
I had some issues with him.

442
00:18:56,387 --> 00:18:59,136
But wasn't the real issue

443
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:02,804
the... big vagina?

444
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:06,302
Yes. It's big.

445
00:19:06,303 --> 00:19:08,428
Big enough to steal

446
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:11,971
a Mickey Mantle
autographed baseball?

447
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:14,970
- Yes.
- Hmm.

448
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:19,428
He took a word in one of my
rhymes and changed that shit.

449
00:19:19,429 --> 00:19:22,136
And it opened up
lyrically for me.

450
00:19:22,137 --> 00:19:23,469
It was amazing, man.

451
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,302
He also saved me from
a marriage to a lesbian.

452
00:19:27,303 --> 00:19:29,094
So, yeah...

453
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:31,761
that motherfucker's
my Caucasian.

454
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,720
- Caucasian?
- Write that shit down.

455
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,052
- He is your Caucasian, yes.
- He is my Caucasian.

456
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:37,636
And a motherfucker.

457
00:19:37,637 --> 00:19:39,636
So, we're on the ski lift
and it's shkiyat hachamah.

458
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:41,219
And according to Jewish law,

459
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,094
I'm not allowed to be with
a man alone after sundown,

460
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:45,511
so I asked him to jump.

461
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:47,720
And he refused,
so I had to jump.

462
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:51,302
So he refused to follow the
tenets of Jewish orthodoxy.

463
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:53,177
Oh, absolutely.

464
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:54,554
Big time.

465
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,136
Please continue.

466
00:19:58,137 --> 00:20:02,386
So, he comes upstairs and
he accuses me of clomping.

467
00:20:02,387 --> 00:20:04,094
And I explained to him,
I have these shoes,

468
00:20:04,095 --> 00:20:07,011
these heavy shoes that I wear
because my feet get cramped.

469
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:08,845
And they make noise.

470
00:20:08,846 --> 00:20:10,386
I invite him in.

471
00:20:10,387 --> 00:20:13,428
I offer him a soda.

472
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:16,177
He took it, and it exploded,
and it got all over him,

473
00:20:16,178 --> 00:20:18,511
and he got... upset.

474
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:21,177
- Now it's... now it's...
- Mr. Fox...

475
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,053
did you clomp on purpose?

476
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:26,302
A little bit.

477
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:30,178
And did you embellish
the shaking of the soda?

478
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,261
Yeah.

479
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:36,052
Thank you.

480
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:39,594
May I offer you
some refreshment?

481
00:20:39,595 --> 00:20:41,886
No, thank you.

482
00:20:41,887 --> 00:20:43,553
I pass, sir.

483
00:20:43,554 --> 00:20:45,220
Pussy.

484
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:58,594
Larry, thank you for all
of the "Seinfeld" scripts

485
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:01,261
and memorabilia that you've
donated to our fundraisers.

486
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:02,553
- It's really...
- Yes.

487
00:21:02,554 --> 00:21:03,803
It's made a lot of money
for the school.

488
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,177
So happy to do it.

489
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:07,720
And thank for allowing me
to come in here today

490
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:12,678
and talk to you, uh, about
this young man who I adore.

491
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,177
- Yes, Eddie.
- Uh, Eddie, yes.

492
00:21:14,178 --> 00:21:15,594
- Right.
- Eddie, yes.

493
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:17,511
You know what?

494
00:21:17,512 --> 00:21:21,094
I just feel like I'm ignoring
you all the way on that side.

495
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:25,052
I should be here because sometimes
women, they're a little, uh,

496
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:28,261
ultra-sensitive about being
ignored at these meetings.

497
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:30,177
"Oh, oh, you don't talk
to the woman," you know.

498
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,094
- Oh, no.
- That's not me. That's not me.

499
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:34,886
Wherever you want to
sit is fine. Please.

500
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:37,720
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

501
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:40,553
I actually would prefer to sit
over there, but, you know.

502
00:21:40,554 --> 00:21:42,261
- Well, please!
- Feel free, Larry.

503
00:21:42,262 --> 00:21:44,302
Okay, all right, okay.
Thank you.

504
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,094
- All right, so!
- Eddie.

505
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:48,886
You know, I... I love this kid
like... like my own son.

506
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:52,219
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, you know, like a nephew.

507
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,636
Actually, more like
a foster child

508
00:21:53,637 --> 00:21:56,094
who comes to your house,
and all of a sudden, you go,

509
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:58,803
"What the hell did I do?
I got... what am I, nuts?"

510
00:21:58,804 --> 00:22:01,803
But, no, no, you grow...
you grow to love them.

511
00:22:01,804 --> 00:22:03,136
That's how I feel now.

512
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:04,636
It's... uh, so...

513
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:09,469
Bridget is Eddie's mother,
and she's your girlfriend?

514
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,970
Girlfriend...

515
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:15,094
I don't know, but she does
have tampons in my house.

516
00:22:15,095 --> 00:22:17,136
Okay, Mr. David, we just want

517
00:22:17,137 --> 00:22:19,803
to get to the nature of your
relationship because...

518
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,802
We were happy to do a
favor for you, Larry.

519
00:22:21,803 --> 00:22:22,803
Sure.

520
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:23,404
But...

521
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:26,136
We just wanna make sure
that it's just not a fling.

522
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:30,261
We're just interested in where
you see this relationship going.

523
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:32,302
Yeah, the relationship going.
I don't know.

524
00:22:32,303 --> 00:22:33,803
You know,
they're kind of tough.

525
00:22:33,804 --> 00:22:36,511
You get involved with somebody,
and all of a sudden,

526
00:22:36,512 --> 00:22:38,803
you got to check in,
you got to report in,

527
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:41,094
you got to text them,
make those phone calls.

528
00:22:41,095 --> 00:22:43,720
You go away for a weekend with
your friends on a trip to Vegas,

529
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:45,219
you come back, she says,
"Did you had fun?"

530
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,136
You got to lie, say,
"No, no, I didn't have fun.

531
00:22:47,137 --> 00:22:49,469
"No, no, it wasn't fun at all.
Worst trip I ever made in my life."

532
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:52,553
Then she talks to one of your friends
and they say they had a fantastic time.

533
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:55,219
She comes back to me, she says,
"Your friends said you had a great time."

534
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,721
And you go, "No, no, they had a
great time. I had a lousy time."

535
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:01,511
Uh...

536
00:23:01,512 --> 00:23:06,052
in general, how are you with
commitments, relationships?

537
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:08,428
I can't sleep with the
same bed with anybody.

538
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:10,386
It's, ugh, a horrible
night's sleep.

539
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:13,553
You can't... you...
I'm off in a corner like this.

540
00:23:13,554 --> 00:23:15,793
You know, 'cause I don't want
another body touching mine

541
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,094
when I'm trying to fall asleep.

542
00:23:17,095 --> 00:23:20,094
And you can't turn this way because
then you get... you got face-to-face.

543
00:23:20,095 --> 00:23:21,845
You don't wanna do that
in the middle of the night.

544
00:23:21,846 --> 00:23:24,886
Well, where... where do you see
the relationship going?

545
00:23:24,887 --> 00:23:27,011
I see it going,
hopefully, one day,

546
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:29,052
to the point where I'll let
her sleep in the guestroom.

547
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:31,219
I'm... I'm shooting
for that.

548
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,386
Uh, we just want to make sure that
Eddie is coming for the right reasons.

549
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,970
Yes. Oh, well, yes.

550
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:39,636
And that you're in a long-term,
committed relationship.

551
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:42,469
Well, I can...
I can give you nine months.

552
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:44,386
Um, that's...

553
00:23:44,387 --> 00:23:48,052
Well, no, I can give you...
I can give you nine months.

554
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:49,594
Nine happy months.

555
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,761
Then I can give you years and
years of... of being miserable.

556
00:23:52,762 --> 00:23:54,344
But we'll be together!

557
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:55,803
Well, that's actually

558
00:23:55,804 --> 00:23:57,761
really what we're
looking to hear, Larry,

559
00:23:57,762 --> 00:23:58,970
is that you are
gonna be together

560
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:00,803
for an extended amount of time.

561
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:02,845
- Absolutely.
- At least while Eddie is here at school.

562
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:06,094
Unless she gets sick or something,
in which case I'll...

563
00:24:06,095 --> 00:24:07,928
I'll leave her quickly.
You could understand that.

564
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:09,845
I'm not gonna visit people
in the hospital.

565
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:11,761
I'm... I'm not crazy, you know.

566
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:13,261
Otherwise...

567
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:15,928
I adore this woman.

568
00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:17,219
Excuse me.

569
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,052
Hello.

570
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:21,636
- LD, it's the Funk-Man.
- Hey, I can't talk right now.

571
00:24:21,637 --> 00:24:24,928
All right, I'll make it quick.
I can't host Cesar's pool party.

572
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:27,511
- What? Why?
- Well, Marilyn wants us

573
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:29,928
to go to Catalina,
so I've got to do it.

574
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,553
I'm very disappointed.
And I'm sure Cesar will be, too.

575
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:34,635
And Little Cesar.

576
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:37,636
I don't know Little Cesar and
I don't really know Cesar.

577
00:24:37,637 --> 00:24:39,970
But, uh, we still on
for brunch Sunday?

578
00:24:39,971 --> 00:24:41,052
Uh, I guess so.

579
00:24:41,053 --> 00:24:42,302
Okay, I'll see you then.

580
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:44,469
All right.
Goodbye.

581
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,970
So, uh, Larry, again, we're very happy
you came in, talked to us about Eddie.

582
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:51,970
I think things, um...
I think look pretty good.

583
00:24:51,971 --> 00:24:53,303
We're very, uh...

584
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:56,803
Could my handyman and his family

585
00:24:56,804 --> 00:24:58,971
use your pool on Saturday?

586
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,720
- Hi.
- Hey.

587
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,177
- Same table.
- Is it?

588
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:18,344
- Champagne.
- Oh.

589
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:20,386
This time we'll drink it.

590
00:25:20,387 --> 00:25:22,094
What's the matter?

591
00:25:22,095 --> 00:25:25,845
I just got off the phone
with the Pemberton Academy.

592
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:27,177
What'd they say?

593
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,386
Eddie didn't get in.

594
00:25:28,387 --> 00:25:29,845
- He didn't get in?
- No.

595
00:25:29,846 --> 00:25:31,261
Why?

596
00:25:31,262 --> 00:25:32,678
Because of the condition

597
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:35,094
that your handyman
and his family

598
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:37,302
left the Pemberton
Academy pool.

599
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,845
What? What's the condition?

600
00:25:38,846 --> 00:25:40,386
Befouled.

601
00:25:40,387 --> 00:25:42,636
Little Cesar befouled the pool?

602
00:25:42,637 --> 00:25:43,678
Why would you
send them there?

603
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,344
Of all the pools in California?

604
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:47,344
I don't know, 'cause Little
Cesar wanted to use a pool!

605
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:49,011
I couldn't... I couldn't
refuse Little Cesar.

606
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:50,636
Why do they have
to use a pool at all?

607
00:25:50,637 --> 00:25:52,594
Cesar flipped the tip
on me and, you know,

608
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:54,344
he wouldn't take the tip,
so I was obligated to!

609
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:55,553
- Hi!
- Hello!

610
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,511
More obligated than to... hi!

611
00:25:57,512 --> 00:25:59,594
- Hi.
- How are you?

612
00:25:59,595 --> 00:26:01,261
What a day!

613
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:03,052
We just came back from Catalina.

614
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:05,803
- Oh, heard that's beautiful.
- What a cruise!

615
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:07,678
- Dolphins!
- Great boat, beautiful.

616
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:09,219
- Magnificent.
- I think I got too much sun.

617
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,594
How are you guys doing?

618
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:14,636
Gosh, I am so sorry,
but I think I have to go.

619
00:26:14,637 --> 00:26:15,837
Oh, no.

620
00:26:15,838 --> 00:26:18,011
We just had a "go home" argument,
and I have to go.

621
00:26:18,012 --> 00:26:21,136
Oh, no, no, no. Don't do that!
No, don't do that!

622
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:23,845
I just feel so upset. I'm not
gonna be able to rally for today.

623
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:25,386
- Yeah.
- Thank you. You understand.

624
00:26:25,387 --> 00:26:27,219
- Thanks for trying.
- Oh, no. I'm sorry, no.

625
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,553
I'll see you, maybe,
again, but who can say?

626
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:33,052
- I might not.
- No, I'm so... ah! Ah, I'm sorry!

627
00:26:33,053 --> 00:26:34,761
Enjoy the champagne.

628
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:37,470
- I'm sorry! Ah!
- Here we go.

629
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,554
Oh!

630
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,886
Mr. David, get in.

631
00:26:56,887 --> 00:26:59,720
Get... get in the car?
What, where... where are we going?

632
00:26:59,721 --> 00:27:02,261
I haven't even had...
had brunch yet.

633
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:03,720
Get in.

634
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,095
Okay.

635
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:08,636
Oh, my God.

636
00:27:08,637 --> 00:27:09,554
Go.

637
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:16,011
There was no reason for me
to get to the back of the line.

638
00:27:16,012 --> 00:27:18,344
As I said, I had already waited,

639
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:24,553
and those brunch buffet lines
are interminable.

640
00:27:24,554 --> 00:27:26,761
Yes, I am familiar

641
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:29,137
because they cook the
eggs while you wait.

642
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:34,469
And all I wanted...
just a little bit more home fries.

643
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,052
Ah, yes, home fries.

644
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:38,136
A nice compliment to the eggs.

645
00:27:38,137 --> 00:27:39,803
With ketchup?

646
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:41,554
Yes, of course.

647
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,553
So it seems wrong to wait
15 minutes just for that.

648
00:27:48,554 --> 00:27:50,845
Yes, of course.
Why even get them?

649
00:27:50,846 --> 00:27:54,094
Exactly. So I took a chance.

650
00:27:54,095 --> 00:27:55,469
But the outcry

651
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,803
was unlike anything
you could ever imagine.

652
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,845
You are perceived as a cutter.

653
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,594
There's nothing Americans
hate more than a cutter.

654
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:04,845
- He is right.
- It's true.

655
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:08,928
You're right, Mufti.
I was humiliated.

656
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:11,094
But this man...

657
00:28:11,095 --> 00:28:13,177
he rose to my defense.

658
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:15,803
He said I have every right

659
00:28:15,804 --> 00:28:18,594
to get seconds without waiting.

660
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:21,302
He was forceful, passionate,

661
00:28:21,303 --> 00:28:23,761
and courageous.

662
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:27,011
When the American
blood sugar gets low,

663
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:28,970
they turn into animals.

664
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:30,469
It's very intimidating.

665
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,136
- True.
- I have seen it.

666
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:34,386
Not this man.

667
00:28:34,387 --> 00:28:36,011
It was something to see.

668
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:39,594
And that's why
I come before you

669
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:43,928
to beg you to reevaluate his case.

670
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:48,344
I have read the report of your
investigation with great interest.

671
00:28:48,345 --> 00:28:51,386
However, there are
many things in his past

672
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:54,302
which contradict his behavior
in the restaurant.

673
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:59,970
For example, this business about
not giving out candy on Halloween.

674
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,219
Surely that cannot be justified.

675
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,177
With all due respect,
he did give out candies.

676
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,553
But the girls in question,
they were teenagers.

677
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:11,386
Much too old to be tricking.

678
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:13,886
Tricking or treating?

679
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:16,136
This is all so very confusing.

680
00:29:16,137 --> 00:29:17,970
Well, you play tricks

681
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:20,970
if you don't get the treat,
is my understanding.

682
00:29:20,971 --> 00:29:23,636
Yes, I believe that is correct.

683
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,344
That is confusing.

684
00:29:25,345 --> 00:29:26,886
But the girls were 16.

685
00:29:26,887 --> 00:29:30,094
You don't trick when you're 16.

686
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:33,594
That's not tricking,
that's stealing.

687
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:35,553
By denying them candy,

688
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:38,094
he was teaching them a lesson.

689
00:29:38,095 --> 00:29:40,052
Yes.

690
00:29:40,053 --> 00:29:42,761
I see your point.

691
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:45,302
Ah, very good. Very good.

692
00:29:45,303 --> 00:29:47,928
Pass the plates, gentlemen.

693
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:51,094
- Falafel. Yes, falafel.
- Another falafel over here.

694
00:29:51,095 --> 00:29:52,428
- Kabob.
- Kabob for me.

695
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:55,720
- Onion rings. Yes.
- Ah, french fries.

696
00:29:55,721 --> 00:30:00,094
But what about his values?

697
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:02,094
His lust knows no bounds.

698
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:05,720
He will have sexual congress
with anyone, anytime.

699
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,302
Including a Palestinian.

700
00:30:08,303 --> 00:30:10,761
What? Is this true?

701
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:12,553
This is so?

702
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:14,344
You know this for a fact?

703
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,845
Twice.

704
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:17,094
Twice!

705
00:30:17,095 --> 00:30:18,553
A Muslim woman?

706
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:19,636
Yes, Mufti,

707
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:20,929
she is a Muslim.

708
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:25,094
Very interesting.

709
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:27,803
This is new information.

710
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:30,678
I will personally
contact the ayatollah

711
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:33,512
and let him know
what we have learned.

712
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:37,469
I can say without reservation

713
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,761
that he will rescind the fatwa.

714
00:30:40,762 --> 00:30:45,302
- You are free to go.
- Thank you, "Moofti"! "Muff-ti"!

715
00:30:45,303 --> 00:30:47,177
Thank you all,
moo-mooftis and muff-tis.

716
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,678
Is it "muff-ti"
or "moofti"?

717
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:49,845
"Moofti."

718
00:30:49,846 --> 00:30:51,553
- "Moovti."
- "Moovti."

719
00:30:51,554 --> 00:30:52,928
Thank you, "Moovtis."

720
00:30:52,929 --> 00:30:55,469
Thank you so...
but what about the musical?

721
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,302
Um, the musical "Fatwa!"?

722
00:30:57,303 --> 00:31:00,303
I will say this
about the musical...

723
00:31:01,804 --> 00:31:04,219
If you can get
Lin-Manuel Miranda,

724
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,845
you know,
from "Hamilton"...

725
00:31:05,846 --> 00:31:08,594
Yes! I love "Hamilton"!

726
00:31:08,595 --> 00:31:11,428
If you can get
Lin-Manuel Miranda to star,

727
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:12,970
you can proceed
with the musical.

728
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,261
How am I gonna get Lin-Manuel?

729
00:31:14,262 --> 00:31:16,052
He... he's got
his own stuff he does.

730
00:31:16,053 --> 00:31:17,511
He's not gonna be in this.

731
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:19,344
What are you doing
with the ketchup?

732
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,928
You used up all the ketchup!

733
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,886
- I like ketchup.
- Show some restraint.

734
00:31:23,887 --> 00:31:26,219
You're never going
to eat all that.

735
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,177
Is there a shortage of ketchup
that I was not aware of?

736
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:33,344
This is why I have been advocating
for packets, but no one will listen!

737
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:37,386
- Now, that's a good idea.
- I cannot eat onion rings without ketchup.

738
00:31:37,387 --> 00:31:39,302
The whole snack is ruined!

739
00:31:39,303 --> 00:31:41,928
- Wait, don't go!
- Please, no!

740
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,636
How am I gonna get Lin-Manuel?

741
00:31:43,637 --> 00:31:46,511
You're being a baby.

742
00:31:46,512 --> 00:31:47,929
Thank you.

743
00:32:00,012 --> 00:32:01,386
Huh. Okay.

744
00:32:01,387 --> 00:32:04,386
- Here you are.
- All right. Very nice.

745
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:06,469
- All right.
- Thank you so much for everything.

746
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,720
I really appreciate it.
Let me, uh... before you go.

747
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:10,344
No, I can't take that.

748
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,720
- Oh, no.
- Please, put it back.

749
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,219
- I insist.
- No, I cannot take this.

750
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,094
- What? Come on, please.
- I cannot take it.

751
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:17,094
- Take the money. What?
- No. You are going to embar...

752
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:18,595
- You are offending me.
- You're offending me!

753
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,344
- I'm not taking...
- Look. Yeah, take it.

754
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:24,761
- I don't want it. Yeah.
- No! Take it back!

755
00:32:24,762 --> 00:32:26,094
I don't want it!

756
00:32:26,095 --> 00:32:28,261
I can't take that from you, sir!

757
00:32:28,262 --> 00:32:29,845
I will not take this tip, okay?

758
00:32:29,846 --> 00:32:30,970
Take the money!

759
00:32:30,971 --> 00:32:32,887
You ain't gonna flip a tip on me!
