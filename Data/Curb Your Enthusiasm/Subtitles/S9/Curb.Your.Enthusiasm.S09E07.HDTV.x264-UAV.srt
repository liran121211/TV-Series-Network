1
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:15,357
And you feel a string
pulling you up top,

2
00:00:15,358 --> 00:00:18,273
and your feet planting
you on the earth.

3
00:00:18,274 --> 00:00:20,607
And raise your arms up.

4
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:23,232
If you can, look up.

5
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:26,357
Absorbing the
energy of the room.

6
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:27,816
And come out of it.

7
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:29,732
Fantastic, yogis.

8
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:31,774
Now let's get down
to the floor.

9
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:34,649
First, we'll start
on our shoulders

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,524
and a little shoulder stand.

11
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:39,774
- Toes up to the sky...
- I would fuck her. Damn!

12
00:00:39,775 --> 00:00:41,732
- You like that?
- Fucking love that shit.

13
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,649
Yeah.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,941
And fold our legs
over into plow.

15
00:00:46,942 --> 00:00:49,524
And let's take one more
breath together as a group.

16
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:51,190
Inhale.

17
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:53,774
Take one more sip of air,

18
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:56,524
and down to heart's center,

19
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:58,315
and namaste.

20
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:00,482
Namaste.

21
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,649
Thank you, yogis.
See you tomorrow.

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,942
Thank you, yogi.

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:07,816
I wanted to do
the downward dog.

24
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,524
That's my favorite one.

25
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:13,148
- You love that downward dog.
- I'm a big dog.

26
00:01:13,149 --> 00:01:15,357
- Excuse me. Larry, was it?
- Yes.

27
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:17,982
Um, I just noticed
that you didn't, uh,

28
00:01:17,983 --> 00:01:19,857
namaste with the other yogis.

29
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:22,524
Yeah, not a namaste guy.

30
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:24,649
I don't participate
in group activities.

31
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,440
You know, I don't sing
the birthday song.

32
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,857
"Happy birthday to you",
you know, so, you know.

33
00:01:28,858 --> 00:01:30,691
Namaste means
"the light within me

34
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:32,440
greets the light within you."

35
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:35,232
There is no light within me,
that's the only problem there.

36
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:36,899
Well, why don't you try it?
Why don't you just

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,482
try a little namaste
and see how it feels?

38
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:40,732
I know how it's gonna feel.

39
00:01:40,733 --> 00:01:41,941
I'm gonna feel like an idiot.

40
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:43,190
Well, no one's here now.

41
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:44,607
Why don't you just try it?

42
00:01:44,608 --> 00:01:46,190
My third eye is watching.

43
00:01:46,191 --> 00:01:47,774
That's not how the
third eye works.

44
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,732
You know how the
third eye works, huh?

45
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:51,482
- I've studied it for many years, yes.
- Is that so?

46
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:53,273
Here, watch, here's what I
think about the third eye.

47
00:01:53,274 --> 00:01:55,148
- See? Look, I'm poking it.
- That's disrespectful.

48
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,982
- Doesn't hurt at all.
- It's... it's disrespectful.

49
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:58,190
- Look. Yeah, yeah.
- It's disrespectful.

50
00:01:58,191 --> 00:01:59,899
Just don't do that
to your third eye.

51
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,399
I wouldn't do it to my two eyes,
the real eyes.

52
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,899
Right, right.
The third eye's real.

53
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,774
There's no... there's no
imaginary eye there.

54
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,524
- Are you familiar with etiquette?
- By the way,

55
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,190
- can I say something?
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,565
It's really hot in here.

57
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:10,941
Well, it's hot yoga.

58
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:12,107
Does it have to be this hot?

59
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:13,273
I mean, it's, you know...

60
00:02:13,274 --> 00:02:14,399
Larry, you're here to be

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,941
a part of our
spiritual community.

62
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:18,607
No, I'm here because
I have a bad hamstring.

63
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:22,357
If you're not gonna acknowledge
the light within yourself,

64
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:25,273
then you can leave.

65
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:27,065
You can leave
and you cannot come back.

66
00:02:27,066 --> 00:02:28,107
Wow.

67
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:29,816
That's very
"unyogi-ish" of you.

68
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:32,941
- Get the fuck out.
- You just made my day.

69
00:02:32,942 --> 00:02:34,148
Okay.

70
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:36,483
Namaste!

71
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,900
Guess whose number I got.

72
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:46,232
- Yogi Tina?
- Yeah.

73
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,065
Nice!

74
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,774
Guess who just
threw me out of class

75
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:51,691
and told me never to come back.

76
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:55,065
- Yogi Tina?
- Yeah, Yogi Tina.

77
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:57,315
- Oh, what?
- Yeah, kicked me out!

78
00:02:57,316 --> 00:03:00,440
- The fuck did you do?
- I wouldn't say namaste.

79
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,273
Man, you gotta say
namaste, man.

80
00:03:02,274 --> 00:03:04,190
Oh, get the fuck out of here.
That's so stupid.

81
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:06,357
You know what, it's so goddamn
hot in there, I don't care.

82
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:08,524
- That's what hot...
- Man, what are you doing? I gotta back up.

83
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:10,023
Back the fuck up. You good!

84
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,148
- I can't see shit!
- Leon: Fuckin... whoa!

85
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,857
What the... oh, shit!

86
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:16,482
Oh, fuck!

87
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:19,524
God damn it!

88
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:21,649
You see? You know what?
This is all your fault!

89
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,816
You fiddled with the radio and
the backup camera didn't work.

90
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:25,065
- You fucked up!
- No, you fucked up!

91
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:26,148
No, no, no!
You fucked up!

92
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:27,149
Don't blame me for that shit!

93
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:31,482
- Wow.
- Oh, geez.

94
00:03:31,483 --> 00:03:33,607
- You fucked this car up good.
- Damn it.

95
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:34,649
Look at that.

96
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,816
That's bad.

97
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,649
What you gonna write?

98
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,023
I'm gonna tell them I'm sorry

99
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:41,315
and leave my name
and, uh, number.

100
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,482
- What else can I do?
- I wouldn't write shit!

101
00:03:43,483 --> 00:03:44,565
Just drive the fuck off!

102
00:03:44,566 --> 00:03:45,774
I'm not gonna do that!

103
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:47,691
I follow the golden rule, okay?

104
00:03:47,692 --> 00:03:49,649
"Do unto others as you'd
have others do unto you."

105
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,148
- The golden rule.
- I follow the golden rule, too.

106
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,774
My friend Jasper's golden.

107
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,440
"Fuck them
or they'll fuck you."

108
00:03:55,441 --> 00:03:57,023
- Mm-hmm.
- Interesting rule.

109
00:03:57,024 --> 00:03:57,858
Yeah.

110
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,023
Thankfully, Victor's doing better,
so the wedding's on.

111
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:08,899
- The wedding is happening.
- Wow. Oh, boy.

112
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,524
- What?
- I would be a little concerned

113
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:14,190
- if it was my daughter.
- Well, you know,

114
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,065
there's no accounting
for who's attracted to...

115
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:17,357
look, I'm attracted to Jeff.

116
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,023
Go figure that one.

117
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,440
Or, oh,

118
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:21,440
listen to this...

119
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:22,899
speaking of taste.

120
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,816
I have a friend
who asked us a favor

121
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:26,024
if I could set her up with you.

122
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:28,607
What? What's this?

123
00:04:28,608 --> 00:04:30,774
- Yes. Yes.
- Really?

124
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:32,857
Now I told her...
I read her chapter on verse

125
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:34,440
on what an asshole you are,

126
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,649
and what a horrible idea,

127
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,524
but she would hear none of it.

128
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:38,982
She wants to go out with you.

129
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:40,607
Do-does she know
about the fatwa?

130
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:42,273
Yeah, and guess what?

131
00:04:42,274 --> 00:04:44,357
That turned her on!

132
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:46,148
Hmm. Is she good-looking?

133
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:47,607
Yeah, very pretty.

134
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:49,065
Like to see a picture.

135
00:04:50,566 --> 00:04:52,315
You want to see a picture?

136
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:55,023
Who the fuck are you to ask
for a picture of anybody?

137
00:04:55,024 --> 00:04:57,399
Y-you are on an Uber rating,

138
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,857
you're like a... a two.

139
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:00,607
- A two?
- On a good day. On a good day!

140
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,899
- Fuck you! A two, okay?
- Yeah.

141
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,065
Yeah.

142
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:05,607
I'm a four, baby!

143
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:08,148
- I'm an Uber four.
- You are so delusional.

144
00:05:08,149 --> 00:05:09,649
- I'm delusional?
- Yes!

145
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,399
Let me tell you something,
if I was a two,

146
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,607
I would kill myself.

147
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:15,107
I... I could not live
on this planet as a two.

148
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,649
Hi, Jeffy.

149
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,732
- Hey.
- Hey.

150
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:23,273
Did you call your friend
about the... about the car?

151
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:25,691
- It's good to have a mechanic as a friend.
- Sorry about that.

152
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:28,107
You know this Bridget
friend of hers?

153
00:05:28,108 --> 00:05:29,565
Yeah.

154
00:05:29,566 --> 00:05:31,524
- She good looking?
- Bridget? Beautiful.

155
00:05:31,525 --> 00:05:32,941
- Really?
- Beautiful.

156
00:05:32,942 --> 00:05:33,899
Great girl.

157
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,440
Great sense of humor.

158
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:37,941
He would be lucky to have her,
I'll tell you that much.

159
00:05:37,942 --> 00:05:39,482
And she lucky to have him.

160
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:40,982
That's... that's the pal!

161
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:42,357
What's wrong with you?

162
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,941
I... I tried to
talk her out of it.

163
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:45,941
I got, uh, my friend Larry.

164
00:05:45,942 --> 00:05:48,315
All right, I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone. All right.

165
00:05:48,316 --> 00:05:51,315
- Hey, Greg.
- Hey, what's going on?

166
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,982
Oh, not much.

167
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:54,691
How is it, uh,
we've never met?

168
00:05:54,692 --> 00:05:56,273
Why is Jeff keeping us apart?

169
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,691
I have no clue.

170
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:59,524
He said nothing but wonderful
things about you.

171
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,816
I feel like I know you already.

172
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:02,732
Yeah, he's told me
a lot about you, too.

173
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:04,107
Yeah, how's it going?

174
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:05,816
Anyway, this car, I...

175
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:08,357
something happened to my
fender or bumper or whatever.

176
00:06:08,358 --> 00:06:09,857
I banged into someone, and, uh,

177
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:12,273
- can I bring it over?
- Absolutely.

178
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:13,857
Bring it by now,
as a matter of fact,

179
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,232
and we can have it
hammered out maybe

180
00:06:15,233 --> 00:06:16,273
in the next couple days.

181
00:06:16,274 --> 00:06:18,315
Wow, okay. Great.

182
00:06:18,316 --> 00:06:20,482
- Doesn't even do that for me.
- Huh.

183
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,148
All right, I'll see you soon.
Thank you.

184
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:24,649
- No problem.
- The... the picture.

185
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,107
- Can we get the picture going?
- What picture?

186
00:06:27,108 --> 00:06:29,107
What, of Bridget? You're not
getting a fucking picture.

187
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,023
- Trust me.
- You know, can I just say, Larry...

188
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,607
- Trust me.
- ...not only is she a beautiful woman,

189
00:06:33,608 --> 00:06:36,649
but more important, inner beauty.

190
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,982
That I'm not interested in.

191
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:40,023
- Asshole.
- Yeah.

192
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,482
- All right.
- See you later.

193
00:06:45,608 --> 00:06:46,941
- Oh, hey.
- How you doing?

194
00:06:46,942 --> 00:06:49,065
- I'm looking for Greg.
- Ah, I'm Greg.

195
00:06:49,066 --> 00:06:51,899
- Oh, hey, L-Larry. Jeff's friend.
- Oh!

196
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,691
- We, uh... we talked on the phone.
- On the phone, yeah, yeah.

197
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:56,857
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.
- Eh, you're black.

198
00:06:56,858 --> 00:06:58,899
- Ye... yes.
- Ah.

199
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,691
Yes, I'm...
is that a problem?

200
00:07:00,692 --> 00:07:03,190
- No, of course not.
- Okay, good.

201
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:04,482
Just surprised Jeff
didn't mention it.

202
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:06,148
Why would he have to mention it?

203
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:07,691
Eh, because most white
people with black friends

204
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:09,691
like to show off
about it, that's all.

205
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:11,273
Well, I can see
I've offended you.

206
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,524
That... b-believe me,
that wasn't my intention.

207
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,649
- Ah, well.
- Yeah, I'm not, uh...

208
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:18,315
I'm not prejudiced
in any way...

209
00:07:18,316 --> 00:07:19,316
I... I get it.

210
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:20,941
...towards any group,
except my own, of course.

211
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:24,565
All right, uh, we've gotten off
on the wrong foot, obviously.

212
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:26,273
Um, let's talk about the car.

213
00:07:26,274 --> 00:07:27,691
- Yes, let's. Okay.
- Okay.

214
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,774
There's a problem with the, uh,

215
00:07:29,775 --> 00:07:31,357
the fender, like I said, yeah.

216
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:32,857
Ah, well, that's a bumper.

217
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:35,399
And yes, there's
a problem with it.

218
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,982
All right, so, um,
how long you think it'll take?

219
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,399
You know, we'll call you.

220
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,399
I don't... yeah.
We'll call you.

221
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,941
Any loaners?

222
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,400
Nope.

223
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,232
All right.

224
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,108
I'll call an Uber.

225
00:07:50,233 --> 00:07:52,816
Again, sorry if I, uh,
offended you in any way.

226
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:55,107
You know what...

227
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,900
Okay.

228
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,024
All right. Okay, yeah.

229
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,273
You have, uh, water an
chewing gums, if you like.

230
00:08:06,274 --> 00:08:08,941
Yeah? Well, that's
very nice of you.

231
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,190
- Where you from?
- I am from Romania.

232
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,273
- Romania?
- Yeah.

233
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:13,482
Ah. Bucharest?

234
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:14,607
Ah, you know Bucharest?

235
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:15,982
Yeah, you like that, huh?

236
00:08:15,983 --> 00:08:18,148
- I know my geography.
- Very nice. You do.

237
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,857
Yeah, most people
would say Budapest.

238
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:21,357
- Yeah.
- So, let me ask you a question.

239
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:23,524
I was having a little
dispute with my friend,

240
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:27,941
um, as to what my Uber rating
would be, looks-wise,

241
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,357
from a scale of one to five.

242
00:08:29,358 --> 00:08:30,774
If you were gonna fix me
up with your sister...

243
00:08:30,775 --> 00:08:32,649
- do you have a sister?
- I do.

244
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,357
Okay, so if you were
gonna fix me up with her,

245
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,273
what, uh...
what would you rate me looks-wise?

246
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:37,941
- Just curious.
- One to five?

247
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:39,399
Yeah.

248
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,774
Okay, I am very honest.

249
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,524
I am an honest person.

250
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,941
So I will be honest with you.

251
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:45,565
You are a two.

252
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,148
- A two?
- Two.

253
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:49,399
- You gotta be kidding.
- You are older.

254
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,315
- You have few hairs.
- Two?

255
00:08:51,316 --> 00:08:53,816
- Yes.
- I'm not a two, okay, buddy?

256
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,899
- I'm not a two.
- You live in a fantasy world.

257
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,982
What do you think you are?
What do you think you are?

258
00:08:57,983 --> 00:08:59,899
- Four.
- A four?!

259
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,774
- Yeah, four.
- A four? I am a three.

260
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:03,190
- How can you be a four?
- You're a three?

261
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:04,982
Of course. I am honest.

262
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:06,816
I know, my face is average.

263
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:08,357
I drive Uber. I'm a three.

264
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:10,273
Well, I completely disagree.

265
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:11,549
Anyway, you know,
you're from one of the most

266
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,982
unattractive countries,
you know, on the planet.

267
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:14,548
No, you don't know what..

268
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,148
- ..you're talking about, okay?
- It's all skewed

269
00:09:16,149 --> 00:09:19,065
'cause all you've seen are
unattractive people your entire life.

270
00:09:19,066 --> 00:09:20,649
So I have to take it
with a grain of salt.

271
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,982
Excuse me, have you ever been
to the beaches in Mamaia?

272
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:25,816
Have you seen the women on the
beaches in... no, you have not.

273
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,314
- Well...
- They're some of the most beautiful..

274
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:28,315
...in all of Europe.

275
00:09:28,316 --> 00:09:29,941
Oh, don't... please,
don't make me laugh.

276
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:31,857
You're thinking, maybe,
of mountain women.

277
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:33,357
Okay?
I am not talking about mou...

278
00:09:33,358 --> 00:09:35,148
I'm talking about lowland women.

279
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:38,190
Women of the plains. The most
beautiful in all of Europe.

280
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,732
- In Romania.
- Okay.

281
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,065
- Okay.
- Yeah.

282
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,774
- Hello?
- Larry?

283
00:09:45,775 --> 00:09:47,399
- Yeah?
- This is Justin Brown.

284
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,273
- You, uh... you hit my car.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

285
00:09:50,274 --> 00:09:52,816
I'm, uh... I'm awfully sorry.

286
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,357
Uh, obviously you got my note.

287
00:09:54,358 --> 00:09:56,691
No, I guessed your number.
Yeah, I got your note.

288
00:09:56,692 --> 00:09:58,816
Look, I really wish you had
hung around and stayed.

289
00:09:58,817 --> 00:10:00,190
This is, uh...
this is something

290
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:01,565
that could've been resolved
far earlier.

291
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:04,023
Well, uh, again, I apologize.

292
00:10:04,024 --> 00:10:05,399
It was an accident.

293
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,315
Uh, don't I get any credit
for the note?

294
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:08,816
No, you get zero credit
for leaving a note.

295
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,190
Anyone knows to leave a note.

296
00:10:10,191 --> 00:10:11,399
A real person
would've hung around

297
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,524
and dealt with this in person.

298
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:13,732
It was an accident.

299
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,065
Next time, I won't leave a note.

300
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,607
- How 'bout that?
- Look, Larry,

301
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:18,023
you seem like a complete
garbage person.

302
00:10:18,024 --> 00:10:19,440
How are you gonna
pay for this, asshole?

303
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:21,065
Okay, fuckface,
I'll tell you what.

304
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:23,023
I will text you my address.

305
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:24,565
We don't need to go
through insurance.

306
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:26,148
And, uh,
we'll set up a time.

307
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:27,440
You'll come over
and I'll give you a check.

308
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:28,565
- How's that?
- Fine, but I'm getting

309
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,023
an estimate from the dealer.

310
00:10:30,024 --> 00:10:31,357
All right,
I-I've had enough of you.

311
00:10:31,358 --> 00:10:32,900
Goodbye.

312
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:35,732
Fucking asshole.

313
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:37,357
Hey, could you do me a favor?

314
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:38,941
It's about 900 degrees in here.

315
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,440
Could... could you turn the
heat down a little bit?

316
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:42,525
- I'm starting to sweat.
- No.

317
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,273
So, I play with Jeff

318
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,232
and a few other guys
most weekends.

319
00:10:47,233 --> 00:10:48,440
At the...
at the country club?

320
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,065
- That's so cute.
- Yeah.

321
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,107
Country club.
That's an odd-sounding word.

322
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:54,232
Isn't that what it is, though?
To be honest.

323
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:55,723
What do you call it?
You try to, like,

324
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:57,273
make it seem less fancy.

325
00:10:57,274 --> 00:10:58,473
- At the, uh...
- Uh, golf place.

326
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:01,566
Yeah, yeah at the playground.
I meet some of my friends.

327
00:11:01,567 --> 00:11:03,366
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

328
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:06,482
That's very funny.

329
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,482
- You're kind of funny.
- Oh, wow.

330
00:11:08,483 --> 00:11:11,273
Yeah, I think we're having kind of
a good date here, don't you think?

331
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:12,816
- I told Susie...
- Yeah.

332
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,190
...and, boy, did she try
to talk me out of it, but...

333
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,899
She's not a...
not a big fan of mine.

334
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,273
I think the nicest thing
she called you was quirky.

335
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:21,049
All she told me about you
was you're an NBC censor.

336
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,649
Yes.

337
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,482
I see a lot of dirty words.

338
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,816
- I'll bet.
- It's amazing what, you know...

339
00:11:26,817 --> 00:11:27,982
what they try to get away with.

340
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:29,524
Yeah? Like what?

341
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,982
They try to get the penises in,

342
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,899
and the pussy.

343
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,399
Wet pussy, tight pussy,
hot pussy.

344
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,732
You know, cock, balls, tits.

345
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,857
You know, and after a while,

346
00:11:40,858 --> 00:11:42,524
at the end of the day,
I just...

347
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,023
I just give it to them.

348
00:11:44,024 --> 00:11:45,357
- Yeah.
- You know?

349
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:47,273
I can't fight off
the penis forever.

350
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,148
- Just let it in.
- Yeah.

351
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:51,524
Let it just slip right in.

352
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:53,148
Okay.

353
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:55,440
What a fantastic date.

354
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:57,857
- Not one pause, not one low.
- No.

355
00:11:57,858 --> 00:11:59,691
The conversations
just move and move.

356
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,774
Great.

357
00:12:00,775 --> 00:12:03,357
In fact, if I were to go home

358
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:05,857
and get a phone call
from a friend, okay?

359
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,440
- You... you be my friend. Go ahead.
- Okay.

360
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,482
Larry, hey, I heard you
went out on a date.

361
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:11,774
- How was it?
- Oh, fantastic.

362
00:12:11,775 --> 00:12:12,941
Really? Fantastic?

363
00:12:12,942 --> 00:12:14,857
- Really fantastic.
- Wow.

364
00:12:14,858 --> 00:12:17,440
- Really like her a lot.
- Oh!

365
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,107
Not kidding.
And you know what?

366
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,482
She wears glasses.

367
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:23,315
I love glasses on a woman.

368
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:26,273
Oh, she's...
she's pretty and smart, sexy.

369
00:12:26,274 --> 00:12:28,565
Oh, I'm really a little...
I'm quite...

370
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:30,148
I'm a little smitten.
I'm a little smitten.

371
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:31,774
Larry, I haven't
heard you s...

372
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:34,065
- talk this way in a long time.
- Yes. I know, I know.

373
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,941
- I really like this woman.
- I'm happy for you.

374
00:12:35,942 --> 00:12:37,357
You know, a couple of things.

375
00:12:37,358 --> 00:12:38,691
Of course, nobody's perfect.

376
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,691
She... she has a strange way

377
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,190
of holding silverware
like a pencil.

378
00:12:42,191 --> 00:12:44,399
She holds it like a pencil.
That I've never seen before.

379
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,200
That's annoying.

380
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:46,816
Yeah, and she keeps the
window open in the car.

381
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:47,617
Ugh, air.

382
00:12:47,618 --> 00:12:50,148
You know, my...
the big question tonight was,

383
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:52,165
"Well, how am I gonna end it?
How am I gonna..."

384
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:52,565
Mm-hmm.

385
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,065
- "...am I gonna make a move?"
- Mmm.

386
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,732
Moves, they're tough.
How do you do it?

387
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,899
It's a very difficult thing.

388
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,023
Wow. So, uh, what happened?

389
00:12:59,024 --> 00:13:02,273
- Well, I went in for a... a kiss.
- Yeah.

390
00:13:02,274 --> 00:13:03,732
You know, and...

391
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:05,023
Who are you?

392
00:13:05,024 --> 00:13:06,524
Oh!

393
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,232
Ah. Hi.

394
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:10,774
Larry, this is my son Eddie,
that I was telling you about.

395
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,482
- Yeah.
- I didn't think you were up.

396
00:13:12,483 --> 00:13:14,107
Eddie, this is our friend Larry.

397
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:16,232
- Hey.
- Why is Mom going out with you?

398
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:17,033
Oh...

399
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:18,774
Yeah, no, that's a very
good question, Eddie.

400
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:21,023
Very good question.
I don't know.

401
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,357
Your head is so shiny.

402
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,982
Okay, honey. Now, come on.

403
00:13:24,983 --> 00:13:26,649
How 'bout a...
go grab a snack.

404
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,774
- I'm getting a donut.
- No, get something healthy.

405
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,065
And then her son came down...

406
00:13:33,066 --> 00:13:35,816
- So...
- ...and he insulted me.

407
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:38,440
You know, and that was the
end of the night, pretty much.

408
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:40,941
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, no sweat.

409
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,190
He, um...

410
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:43,399
he has Asperger's.

411
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,148
Ah, Asperger.

412
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:47,774
- Yeah, he's on the spectrum.
- Wow. Spectrum?

413
00:13:47,775 --> 00:13:49,407
- Mm-hmm.
<i>- Why are these chocolate sprinkles?</i>

414
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:50,299
On the spectrum?

415
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,232
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>I only eat rainbow sprinkles!</i>

416
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:54,023
I'm so sorry, but I gotta...

417
00:13:54,024 --> 00:13:55,774
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Ca-call me.

418
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:57,524
- Okay? M'kay.
- Oh, sure, yeah.

419
00:13:57,525 --> 00:13:59,357
Hey, it was really fun.

420
00:13:59,358 --> 00:14:00,857
Yeah. Nice. Okay.

421
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:02,607
You'll... you'll find the door.

422
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,650
I'm coming, honey.

423
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,190
Why didn't you tell me
he was black?

424
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:09,607
What does it matter?

425
00:14:09,608 --> 00:14:10,774
No, it doesn't matter at all.

426
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:12,065
You know,
'cause when I got there,

427
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:13,399
I was surprised and I
blurted something out

428
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,440
and the whole thing
was a disaster.

429
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,190
- What did you blurt out?
- I said I didn't know you were black.

430
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:19,482
- Why'd you do that?!
- Because I was surprised.

431
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,982
What were you surprised about?

432
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:25,149
Because he didn't sound
black on the phone, okay?!

433
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:28,315
- Where's Susie?
- Upstairs.

434
00:14:28,316 --> 00:14:30,190
I do know what
he's talking about.

435
00:14:30,191 --> 00:14:33,858
So stupid.

436
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:42,440
Oh, Jesus Christ!
What are you doing up here?

437
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:45,315
This is upstairs. You don't come
upstairs in somebody's house.

438
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:47,607
- W-why? What's so special about...
- This is my boudoir!

439
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:49,482
It's off-limits!

440
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:50,816
Off-limits!

441
00:14:50,817 --> 00:14:52,941
Would Mrs. Cleaver

442
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:54,607
talk that way to Eddie Haskell

443
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:56,565
if he came upstairs
to her... to her bedroom?

444
00:14:56,566 --> 00:14:57,774
Oh, I think so.

445
00:14:57,775 --> 00:14:59,982
Mrs. Cleaver hated Eddie Haskell

446
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,190
'cause Eddie Haskell
was a kiss-ass,

447
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:03,899
obsequious, little shit.

448
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,399
I think he had access
to the house.

449
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,273
But that's because
the boys were upstairs.

450
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:10,065
Okay, so all I'm asking
for is Haskell-access.

451
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:13,273
I want the same... I want the
same privileges as Eddie Haskell!

452
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:14,899
- Okay, number one...
- Is that asking too much?!

453
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,232
What are you doing here anyway?

454
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:17,399
Why didn't you tell me

455
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,149
that her kid had...

456
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:23,857
- you know.
- What?

457
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:27,524
Ass... Ass...

458
00:15:27,525 --> 00:15:29,440
- What?
- Asper...

459
00:15:29,441 --> 00:15:31,732
- Asperger's. Yeah, what about it?
- Asperger's.

460
00:15:31,733 --> 00:15:33,649
- Why didn't I tell you?
- Yeah, why didn't you tell me?

461
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,524
Wha... why should
I have told you?

462
00:15:35,525 --> 00:15:37,565
- You could've mentioned it.
- I set you up on a date.

463
00:15:37,566 --> 00:15:40,315
You should be lucky
that I even did that for you.

464
00:15:40,316 --> 00:15:42,440
- So, how did it go?
- Pretty damn good.

465
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,482
Really like her.

466
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:44,774
- Good.
- What she say about me?

467
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:47,024
She had a good time.

468
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,273
- That's it?
- Mm, she li... yeah.

469
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:53,691
- What?
- She... she's had a good time.

470
00:15:53,692 --> 00:15:55,649
- That's all she said?
- That's all she said.

471
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,082
I'll tell you what.

472
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,532
I was about to make a
move on the couch...

473
00:15:58,533 --> 00:15:59,232
Yeah?

474
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,315
...and that little prick
son ruined it for me.

475
00:16:01,316 --> 00:16:03,774
Aw. My heart is breaking.

476
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:05,440
All right, go! Just leave.

477
00:16:05,441 --> 00:16:06,774
Okay, but I can't get home.

478
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:08,440
The Uber's not picking me up,
for some reason.

479
00:16:08,441 --> 00:16:10,982
Yeah, well, walk.
Get the fuck out! Go now!

480
00:16:10,983 --> 00:16:14,524
Has Jeff seen you
in those curlers of late?

481
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,148
Get! Out! Out! Out!

482
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,692
Oh, what a fucking asshole.

483
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:24,941
Oh, finally.

484
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,817
The hell is this?

485
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:31,274
- This an Uber?
- UberX.

486
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:38,941
Took quite a while.

487
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:41,774
Okay.

488
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:44,607
- Am I wrong?
- Kind of took a gamble picking you up

489
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:46,774
- with that one-star rating.
- What?

490
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:48,232
Yeah.

491
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:49,440
You know, usually I, uh...

492
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,315
I pick up four, five stars.

493
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:52,816
I know they're
gonna be responsible,

494
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:54,107
respectful of the car,

495
00:16:54,108 --> 00:16:55,273
not be a problem.

496
00:16:55,274 --> 00:16:56,774
- But...
- One star?

497
00:16:56,775 --> 00:16:59,315
I'm not one star.

498
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,399
- I'm a five.
- You might feel like a five,

499
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
but Uber says you're
a one, buddy.

500
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,108
Holy shit.

501
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,482
Four other stars next to it,

502
00:17:09,483 --> 00:17:10,482
not filled in.

503
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:11,732
The Romanian!

504
00:17:11,733 --> 00:17:13,649
- The Romanian?
- The Romanian.

505
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:16,232
Gave me... he gave me a one and
took me down from a five to a one.

506
00:17:16,233 --> 00:17:17,683
One-Star Larry is really,

507
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,983
- uh... really not a popular guy.
- All right. Okay.

508
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:37,190
Man.

509
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,232
What the hell is
going on in here?

510
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:42,232
- Phew.
- Huh? It's 92 degrees.

511
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:43,649
You're damn right
it's 92 degrees.

512
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,649
Tina came over.

513
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,148
- Who?
- Yogi Tina.

514
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,482
Like that shit hot.

515
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,273
- Where is she?
- Fuck you think she's at?

516
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:50,649
She's up there
fuckin' recuperating.

517
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,899
What are you doing in my house?

518
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,482
I'm in here fuckin'
at 92 degrees.

519
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:56,107
- What? You're what?
- That's what the fuck's going on.

520
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,148
Why are you having
sex in my house?

521
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,399
- Because...
- You got a guest house back there.

522
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,232
- I can't fuck...
- Huh?

523
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,941
...at 92 degrees in my room

524
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:05,357
'cause my room
won't get hot enough.

525
00:18:05,358 --> 00:18:06,524
- Okay, well you...
- It gets hot in here.

526
00:18:06,525 --> 00:18:07,816
Well, you already
did it, right?

527
00:18:07,817 --> 00:18:09,607
- Now get out.
- No, I did part one.

528
00:18:09,608 --> 00:18:11,023
I didn't do part
two or three yet.

529
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,482
Okay, there's not gonna be
a part two or three, okay?

530
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,440
- There's always a part two and three.
- No, no, no. No!

531
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:17,691
I'm not gonna sit here and
leave her at fuckin' part one.

532
00:18:17,692 --> 00:18:19,065
Well, why is it 92 degrees?

533
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:20,691
She's a yoga instructor.
She likes hot yoga.

534
00:18:20,692 --> 00:18:23,023
Oh, so she likes hot sex
and hot yoga, is that it?

535
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:24,399
That's fuckin' right.
That's what the fuck she does.

536
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,148
I want you out of the house.

537
00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:29,899
I don't want some post-sex guy
walking around my house, okay?

538
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,982
- Now get out.
- First of all,

539
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:33,732
there's nothing wrong
with people having

540
00:18:33,733 --> 00:18:35,857
the scent of...
of fuck on their body.

541
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:38,941
I don't like the
scent of fuck, okay?

542
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:41,399
Sue me. I don't like fuck scent.

543
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,065
All right, look, uh, some guy
named Greg called for you.

544
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,190
He said your car's gonna
be ready in three weeks.

545
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:49,357
Three weeks? On the phone,
he said a couple of days.

546
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:50,058
Oh, wow.

547
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:52,107
Well, di-did he sound like
he was ticked off?

548
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:54,941
No, he just sounded like
some random black dude

549
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:56,233
who's calling about your car.

550
00:18:57,817 --> 00:19:00,315
- How do you know he's black?
- I know how black people sound.

551
00:19:00,316 --> 00:19:03,774
- You could tell that guy was black?
- Fuck, yeah, instantly.

552
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,482
- Wow.
- Three words. Bam.

553
00:19:05,483 --> 00:19:07,357
Jews, I could tell
within, like, a minute.

554
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,023
- Man or woman.
- Of course, 'cause you're Jewish.

555
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,691
You... you give me two minutes,
and I could tell you

556
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:12,107
if they're reform
or conservative.

557
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,190
Hmm... Uh-oh.

558
00:19:14,191 --> 00:19:15,607
Somebody recuperated.

559
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:18,649
Oh, well, well, well.

560
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:21,273
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Larry.

561
00:19:21,274 --> 00:19:23,649
How's the temperature?
Is it to your liking?

562
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,732
It's the optimal
temperature for climaxing.

563
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:26,816
Oh, is it?

564
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:27,816
Ha, ha, is it?

565
00:19:27,817 --> 00:19:30,273
You... are gonna have to leave.

566
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:32,732
- Such hospitality.
- Feels good?

567
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:33,941
Namaste.

568
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,315
Okay. Now get the fuck out.

569
00:19:35,316 --> 00:19:37,273
I'm still gonna
nama-stick-it-in-her.

570
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:38,816
Tell you that.

571
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:40,190
Hold on. Hold on, baby.

572
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:41,941
Let me talk to you real quick.

573
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:44,065
- It's right over there.
- That looks nice.

574
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,190
- Why are we going to this place?
- Because...

575
00:19:46,191 --> 00:19:47,941
- It stinks.
- Highly recommended.

576
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:50,148
They better have a cheeseburger,
no condiments.

577
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:52,440
- I don't like condiments.
- Is that so?

578
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,982
- Hey, look at that guy.
- Yeah, look at that guy.

579
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,816
Wow.

580
00:19:56,817 --> 00:19:58,315
Free.

581
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:00,649
He'll be fine once we
get to the restaurant.

582
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:01,982
- Uh...
- So...

583
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,524
Huh.

584
00:20:03,525 --> 00:20:04,857
- Thank you.
- Bye.

585
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,399
- Well, well.
- Thank you.

586
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,107
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

587
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:08,983
I'll be right back.

588
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,775
Oh, come on.

589
00:20:19,983 --> 00:20:21,107
A one?

590
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:22,857
You gave me a one?

591
00:20:22,858 --> 00:20:24,982
- Honestly.
- I don't like the way you spoke to me.

592
00:20:24,983 --> 00:20:26,315
You insulted...

593
00:20:26,316 --> 00:20:28,857
you insulted the lowland
women of my country, okay?

594
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:31,482
- You are asking me to set you up with...
- Let's be honest about it.

595
00:20:31,483 --> 00:20:32,982
They're not the most
attractive group...

596
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:34,232
You have...
you've never seen...

597
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,899
you want me to pull up
pictures for you?

598
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,399
I've seen plenty of
pictures of Romanian women.

599
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,357
And the Bulgarians,
and the Hungarians.

600
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:40,399
No beauties. Come on.

601
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,982
First of all,

602
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:43,774
do you hear yourself talking?

603
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:46,148
You are the rudest person
I've ever met.

604
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,273
You are an angry person, okay?

605
00:20:48,274 --> 00:20:49,857
And you ask me
to change the heat...

606
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:51,857
Who's angry? You're the one
who's angry, not me.

607
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:54,190
- You're angry.
- You are making me angry, my friend.

608
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:57,732
I am not the one insulting your
culture, your country, your women.

609
00:20:57,733 --> 00:21:00,732
I gave you a five.
I gave you a five.

610
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,357
Of course, because
I gave you nice service.

611
00:21:02,358 --> 00:21:04,399
I take you where you want to go,
quickest route.

612
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,232
Okay, look, look,
I wanna ask you a favor, okay?

613
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,315
I can't get Ubers now
on account of you,

614
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:09,691
so I want you to
change the rating.

615
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:10,941
Oh, change the rating?

616
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:12,357
- Yeah.
- Okay.

617
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:15,273
You want me to go into the
algorithm and change it?

618
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,941
Sure. Oh, no problem.
Of course.

619
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:21,023
Let me just open a programming
window on my phone

620
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,148
and enter some code for you.

621
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,482
What are you writing
over there?

622
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,315
I'm just entering some notes
for other drivers.

623
00:21:26,316 --> 00:21:27,732
- What is that?
- Don't worry.

624
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:29,232
I wanna see what
you're writing.

625
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,232
- Get out of my car.
- Give me that cell phone.

626
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,399
I'm not giving you
my cell phone.

627
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,065
Don't touch my cell phone.

628
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:35,273
All right, you know what?

629
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,691
I'm changing my rating of you.

630
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:39,774
From a five to a zero.

631
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:41,399
- Okay, try it. Take your phone out.
- Okay. Yeah, I will try it.

632
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,816
Go ahead because Uber ratings
are final, my friend.

633
00:21:43,817 --> 00:21:45,357
- They're final?!
- They are final.

634
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,148
You know what
I regret the most?

635
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:48,315
When I said to you,
"If you were gonna

636
00:21:48,316 --> 00:21:50,065
fix me up with your sister,

637
00:21:50,066 --> 00:21:51,607
- what Uber rating would you give me?"
- Yeah.

638
00:21:51,608 --> 00:21:53,065
I would never go out
with your sister

639
00:21:53,066 --> 00:21:54,399
under any circumstances.

640
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,399
My sister would not look
at a picture of you.

641
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,315
- She's a gorgeous Romanian woman.
- Gorgeous Romanian?

642
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:00,649
That's an oxymoron.

643
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,107
- Gorgeous Romanian.
- That's it.

644
00:22:02,108 --> 00:22:04,315
- No, what? Hey!
- You think that I'm gonna...

645
00:22:04,316 --> 00:22:06,899
say something about
my sister again!

646
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,190
And I'm telling you,

647
00:22:09,191 --> 00:22:10,774
I don't think Bridget's
kid has Asperger's.

648
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:13,315
I swear to God,
I just think he's an asshole.

649
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:17,440
- The kid's an asshole.
- I know a lot of people with Asperger's, I do.

650
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,732
Not a lot, but I know some.

651
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:20,607
And you know what,
they're delightful people.

652
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:23,232
This kid,
I'm betting you're right.

653
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,607
- Asshole.
- I think so.

654
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:27,482
You know, to be honest with you,

655
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:29,774
I'm gonna start telling people
that you're on the spectrum.

656
00:22:29,775 --> 00:22:30,875
I could be.

657
00:22:30,876 --> 00:22:33,440
Any bad behavior can be
written off as what?

658
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:34,607
- Spectrum.
- Spectrum.

659
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:36,107
Hello, hello, hello.

660
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:37,816
It's hot as fuckin' hell
in there, Larry.

661
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:39,190
Well, I know.
The... the heating's broken.

662
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,148
And the heating guy's here.
He's fixing it.

663
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:42,482
That's why we're
sitting out here.

664
00:22:42,483 --> 00:22:43,774
Oh, all right. Well, listen,

665
00:22:43,775 --> 00:22:45,816
I'm going around
to all my friends

666
00:22:45,817 --> 00:22:48,148
and I'm giving them
these sample baskets.

667
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:50,399
So maybe you could
give this one to Bridget.

668
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,941
So... so what did
she say about me?

669
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:54,857
Come on, give me...
give me a little something.

670
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,732
Huh? What do you got?

671
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:58,482
- What'd she say?
- She said to me...

672
00:22:58,483 --> 00:23:01,107
- Yeah.
- ...that she thinks you're terrific.

673
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:03,148
There you go!
Now you're talking!

674
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:04,816
- You like her?
- I do.

675
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,857
But that prick son
is driving me crazy.

676
00:23:07,858 --> 00:23:09,649
Ugh, you know what,
you've never had children.

677
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,065
Every single time you deal
with a woman with kids,

678
00:23:12,066 --> 00:23:13,148
you have a problem.

679
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:15,148
I suggest you foster a kid.

680
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:21,565
- Okay. I'll go...
- It'll make you a better man.

681
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,190
I'll go down to the pound today.

682
00:23:23,191 --> 00:23:25,065
I'll go down...
I'll go down to the foster pound.

683
00:23:25,066 --> 00:23:26,565
Would you come with me
to the foster pound?

684
00:23:26,566 --> 00:23:28,691
Always looking forward for
a trip to the foster pound.

685
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:31,691
- Oh, it is so hot in there.
- Yeah, I know.

686
00:23:31,692 --> 00:23:33,816
Yeah, it's, like,
stuck on 92 degrees.

687
00:23:33,817 --> 00:23:35,440
- I know.
- Yeah.

688
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,691
It's much nicer out here.

689
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:38,107
So what do you think?
How's it looking?

690
00:23:38,108 --> 00:23:40,273
Well, we're running
a system diagnostics test

691
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:42,107
and, uh, you know,
we'll have our answer soon.

692
00:23:42,108 --> 00:23:44,190
Do you specialize more in
heating than air-conditioning?

693
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:46,190
Oh, we do both...
heat and AC.

694
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,565
If I called you up and said
I have a particular problem,

695
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:50,982
would you prefer if I said
heating or air-conditioning?

696
00:23:50,983 --> 00:23:52,899
- I have no preference.
- No preference at all?

697
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,732
No preference at all. You know, they're
like... you know, it's like children.

698
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,065
Okay, like children.
Say you had a "Sophie's Choice."

699
00:23:57,066 --> 00:23:59,524
You have two children,
heating and air-conditioning.

700
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,941
You have to pick one,
the one you had an infinity for,

701
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:05,816
and the other one goes into
the concentration camp.

702
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:07,400
Which one...
which one you gonna keep?

703
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:10,691
Heat. Go with heat.

704
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:12,982
So air conditioning's going
to the concentration camp.

705
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:15,315
...going to the concentration camp,
but heat is saved.

706
00:24:17,274 --> 00:24:19,232
You know, our AC isn't
working that well either.

707
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:22,358
- Ah, it's from Bridget.
- Wow.

708
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:28,273
What she see's in him,
I have no idea.

709
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:31,148
Hey. Hey.
How long is this gonna take?

710
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:33,774
- I... you gotta get this done quickly.
- Yeah, I got some bad news.

711
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:35,941
You got a broken part, and it's
gonna take about three days.

712
00:24:35,942 --> 00:24:38,232
- I don't have it on the truck. Yeah.
- What? Three days?

713
00:24:38,233 --> 00:24:40,107
Y-you were so confident outside.

714
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:42,065
- You said you got it done.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

715
00:24:42,066 --> 00:24:44,399
- You said you were a heat guy.
- I... I am a heat guy.

716
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,190
What you have is
a cooling problem.

717
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:47,565
- Cooling?!
- Yeah.

718
00:24:47,566 --> 00:24:49,273
You sent the cooling kid
to the concentration camp.

719
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:51,107
Okay, it's not a kid, okay?

720
00:24:51,108 --> 00:24:52,482
It's chlorofluorocarbons.

721
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:53,899
Okay, they're not...
they're not children.

722
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,273
I did not send a child
to a concentration camp.

723
00:24:56,274 --> 00:24:57,774
Yeah, you know,
I was gonna consummate.

724
00:24:57,775 --> 00:24:59,273
I had a window open
to consummate.

725
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:00,607
Now the window's closed.

726
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,190
- No consummation.
- Why is it closed?

727
00:25:02,191 --> 00:25:04,023
Well, I'm not gonna have
sex in a 92-degree room.

728
00:25:04,024 --> 00:25:06,023
You get all sweaty.
There's... it's disgusting.

729
00:25:06,024 --> 00:25:08,273
The sweat's on the sheets,
I have to take my shirt off.

730
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:09,691
I'm not gonna have sex
with my shirt off.

731
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:11,732
You don't take your
shirt off during sex?

732
00:25:11,733 --> 00:25:13,982
- No, I don't... no.
- I take my shirt off while I'm kissing.

733
00:25:13,983 --> 00:25:15,399
I love it.
I get completely free.

734
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,399
All right. I...
I don't really know your name.

735
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,899
You don't have one
of those little tags on...

736
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,732
- No, we don't wear tags.
- I'll take a guess.

737
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:23,315
- Uh, Bob?
- It's Bill.

738
00:25:23,316 --> 00:25:26,107
All right, Bill, uh, let's
not talk about this anymore.

739
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,565
All right, I'm sorry,
you brought it up.

740
00:25:27,566 --> 00:25:29,774
Yeah, I did.
I... I gotta text her

741
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,607
and tell her we can't...
she can't come over.

742
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:34,316
I got it.

743
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:39,148
I'm here for my money, Lar...

744
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:40,732
oh, my God.

745
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:42,774
I'm Justin.
My car was the one,

746
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:46,232
uh, damaged, um...

747
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:48,524
I'm sorry, I didn't kno...
I didn't know you were black.

748
00:25:48,525 --> 00:25:50,816
- Does it matter?
- No. God, no.

749
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:53,732
No, like, that could
literally not matter less.

750
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:55,440
Yeah, uh, um,

751
00:25:55,441 --> 00:25:57,816
you know, this is the estimate
I got from the dealership,

752
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:59,065
but, uh, it seems high.

753
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,732
And, uh, like,
the car, it wasn't...

754
00:26:02,733 --> 00:26:04,816
You know, why don't...

755
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:06,691
why don't I just
take care of this?

756
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,482
We'll, uh...
we'll call this one good.

757
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,524
I'm... I'm really sorry
for the misunderstanding.

758
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,565
Anyway, uh, thank you
for leaving a note.

759
00:26:12,566 --> 00:26:14,148
That was really considerate.
Thank you.

760
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:15,857
- My man.
- My man. Thank you.

761
00:26:15,858 --> 00:26:17,857
- We good.
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry about...

762
00:26:17,858 --> 00:26:20,032
- I'm gonna go ahead and take care.
- Yeah, yeah, we good.

763
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,032
okay.

764
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:26,148
Wow.

765
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,440
- Huh?!
- Look at that.

766
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:29,107
- That was beautiful.
- That was nice.

767
00:26:29,108 --> 00:26:31,023
- White people.
- Hey, man, white people.

768
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:33,607
Gotta love 'em. Namaste.

769
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,066
Namaste up in
this mother fucker.

770
00:26:38,191 --> 00:26:39,066
Hey, Greg.

771
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:42,774
Ah...
hey, Larry.

772
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:44,525
Yeah, um...

773
00:26:45,775 --> 00:26:48,440
I just came to apologize

774
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:49,565
for the other day.

775
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,982
Thing is
that I didn't m...

776
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:56,399
tell you was that
I have Asperger's.

777
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,315
You have Asperger's? Ah.

778
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:00,190
Jeff never mentioned anything,
I'm so sorry.

779
00:27:00,191 --> 00:27:01,440
Why would he need to?

780
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:03,190
Well, no, no, no, I...
he doesn't need to.

781
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:05,190
You... you're right.
I'm sorry.

782
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:06,816
Um, how bad is it?

783
00:27:06,817 --> 00:27:08,649
Is... I mean, how mild or?

784
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,982
No, I'm on the, uh...
I'm on the spectrum.

785
00:27:10,983 --> 00:27:12,482
You know, I have no...
I have no filter.

786
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:13,816
I say whatever
comes into my head.

787
00:27:13,817 --> 00:27:15,482
You know, I have trouble
making eye contact.

788
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:17,315
I... I get it.
I... you know what?

789
00:27:17,316 --> 00:27:19,190
We'll have the car
ready for you tomorrow.

790
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:20,899
It's just a ding.
Free of charge.

791
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,691
What?! What? What?

792
00:27:22,692 --> 00:27:25,065
- Yeah, again, I apologize so much.
- Yeah, yeah.

793
00:27:25,066 --> 00:27:26,232
- Tomorrow. Yeah.
- Sorry.

794
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:27,315
He said he's sorry. He's sorry.

795
00:27:27,316 --> 00:27:28,732
I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

796
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,315
Yeah, he's really sorry.
He's sorry.

797
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,732
Car will be ready when?

798
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,941
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

799
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,482
- Free.
- S-see you tomorrow.

800
00:27:34,483 --> 00:27:35,941
Tomorrow.

801
00:27:35,942 --> 00:27:37,273
- T-t... yeah, tomorrow.
- Yeah.

802
00:27:37,274 --> 00:27:38,524
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, tomorrow.

803
00:27:38,525 --> 00:27:40,524
- Yeah, okay.
- You need a ride?

804
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,440
No, I'm a...
I'm a good driver.

805
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:43,983
I'm a good driver.

806
00:27:46,149 --> 00:27:48,357
- Nice to be out, isn't it?
- I love this shit.

807
00:27:48,358 --> 00:27:50,816
- Out of that hot house?
- You can't take that shit.

808
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:53,232
You a Anglo-Anglo motherfucker.

809
00:27:53,233 --> 00:27:54,607
You know?

810
00:27:54,608 --> 00:27:57,108
Your body's not used to
that kind of temperature.

811
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,941
- The fuck is it?
- Bridget.

812
00:28:04,942 --> 00:28:06,649
- The... the NBC censor.
- Yeah, yeah.

813
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,148
I haven't had sex with her yet.
She invited me over to her house.

814
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:10,774
- We got an hour.
- Oh, man.

815
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:12,273
- I got an hour window.
- An hour's a good fuck window.

816
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,524
Fuck, I don't have a car.

817
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,565
I need to borrow your car.

818
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:15,607
- Mm-mmm.
- What?!

819
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:16,649
You ain't borrowing my car.

820
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,941
- Why not?!
- I got a date.

821
00:28:17,942 --> 00:28:19,148
You're not gonna
give me your car?

822
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:20,482
No! You're not getting
my fucking car.

823
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:21,857
No, no, no.
Use the guest house.

824
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:23,107
- The guest house?!
- Use that shit, man.

825
00:28:23,108 --> 00:28:24,273
That scum-shack?!

826
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:25,315
You think I'm gonna
go in there?

827
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:26,524
- Are you crazy?
- Scum-shack?

828
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:28,023
There must have been
10,000 ejaculations

829
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:29,315
in that place in
just two years.

830
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:30,816
That means that room
is broken in.

831
00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:32,440
It's ready. It's prime
and ready to fuck.

832
00:28:32,441 --> 00:28:34,607
Okay, fuck that.
All right, I'll tell you what.

833
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:36,482
Okay, I'll tell you what.

834
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,899
I... I can't do Uber,

835
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,357
so just get...
get me an Uber.

836
00:28:40,358 --> 00:28:41,857
- No, fuck that.
- What?

837
00:28:41,858 --> 00:28:43,023
You gonna bring
my rating down.

838
00:28:43,024 --> 00:28:44,399
I'm a good five right now.

839
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,440
- I'm a five.
- No, no, you a fuckin' one.

840
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:48,065
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
one idiot changed it to a one.

841
00:28:48,066 --> 00:28:49,315
- No, no, no, no.
- That doesn't mean anything.

842
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:50,607
You don't know how
to respect people.

843
00:28:50,608 --> 00:28:51,899
- You're a cocksucker.
- Fuck that.

844
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,857
- I'm gonna take a bus.
- Yeah, you do that.

845
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,190
- You a cocksucker!
- Hey!

846
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,857
And your friendship rating
just went down!

847
00:28:56,858 --> 00:28:58,817
Hey! Hey!

848
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:01,732
Hey! No, no, no.

849
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:04,400
Oh, come on.
Op-open the door!

850
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,607
Does this go to
Olympic and Hauser?

851
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:10,733
- Not all the way. You gotta transfer.
- Transfer?

852
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:20,440
What are you sitting
in the middle for?

853
00:29:20,441 --> 00:29:21,482
Why don't you
move over one?

854
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:25,691
Okay, or whatever
you're saying,

855
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:27,816
but it's... it's
a little strange.

856
00:29:27,817 --> 00:29:29,440
I've never seen a person
sit in the middle.

857
00:29:29,441 --> 00:29:31,857
It's like using
the middle urinal.

858
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:39,273
You know it's odd, I... I'm not sure
if you can understand me or not just...

859
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:43,482
No, no, you go over there.

860
00:29:45,358 --> 00:29:47,232
No, you sit there. No, no.

861
00:29:53,233 --> 00:29:54,732
Sir?

862
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:56,065
Olympic and Hauser?

863
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:58,607
I'm supposed to go to, um... sir?

864
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:01,232
I'm supposed to go to,
uh, Olympic and Hauser.

865
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,565
Yeah, well, that's easy, man.

866
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:04,065
Get off at the La Cienega stop.

867
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:05,232
You got a couple options.

868
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:06,982
Okay, will you tell me
when that's, uh...

869
00:30:06,983 --> 00:30:09,565
- when that's coming up?
- I'm not your babysitter.

870
00:30:09,566 --> 00:30:10,775
Figure it out.

871
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:15,107
This bus is a very cold,
unforgiving place.

872
00:30:15,108 --> 00:30:16,400
I don't like it one bit.

873
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:21,107
Does this go to
Olympic and Hauser?

874
00:30:21,108 --> 00:30:22,942
Mm-hmm.

875
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,107
There you go.

876
00:30:28,108 --> 00:30:30,607
- To transfer, right?
- Yup.

877
00:30:30,608 --> 00:30:32,899
- Huh. Yeah, I did it.
- All right, you did it,

878
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,273
but can you do me
a favor and get

879
00:30:34,274 --> 00:30:36,273
behind the yellow line
for your safety?

880
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:37,774
- Thank you.
- Could you do me a favor

881
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:40,482
and maybe go a little faster
than you normally might?

882
00:30:40,483 --> 00:30:42,148
I... I cannot
do you that favor.

883
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:45,941
Yellows. If there's anyway that...
to ignore the yellows.

884
00:30:45,942 --> 00:30:47,607
Sir, I'm not ignoring
any yellows.

885
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:49,732
- I... I understand but people...
- Have a seat. Have a seat.

886
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:52,107
People pay a little too much
attention to yellows and...

887
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:54,732
I am driving this bus.
I don't wanna hear no more back talk.

888
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:57,023
- There's not another route?
- Sit down!

889
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,857
- There is not another route.
- Hey, shush down here for a second.

890
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,482
I got some personal business.

891
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:01,941
You gonna make me crazy now.

892
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:03,482
Do you wanna drive
this bus, sir?

893
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:05,440
- Is that an option?
- No, it's not an option.

894
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:07,524
I'ma need you to go
and sit the hell down.

895
00:31:07,525 --> 00:31:08,816
This is danger. Come and sit!

896
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:10,857
Hey, this is none
of your business, okay?

897
00:31:10,858 --> 00:31:13,023
Just... just take it easy.
I... I've got a...

898
00:31:13,024 --> 00:31:14,732
- Sit down!
- Sit down!

899
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:16,565
Sit your ass down!

900
00:31:16,566 --> 00:31:20,065
Get behind the yellow
line and sit down.

901
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,774
Shit.

902
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:24,816
- You no listen!
- You clipped a mirror.

903
00:31:24,817 --> 00:31:26,149
No shit, Sherlock.

904
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,148
What's going on?
What are you doing?

905
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:31,691
- I gotta pull over.
- What? Pull over?

906
00:31:31,692 --> 00:31:33,691
- Are you kidding? Why?
- Yeah. I have to leave a note.

907
00:31:33,692 --> 00:31:35,565
- A note? Oh, no, that's a terrible mistake.
- Yes.

908
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:37,691
Terrible. People don't
appreciate them anyway.

909
00:31:37,692 --> 00:31:39,857
- I'm telling you the truth.
- You know, this is some bullshit.

910
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,482
The whole reason I hit this car

911
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,190
is because you was up here...
yack, yack, yack...

912
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:45,315
talking in my ear,
"Go through the yellow light.

913
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:47,315
- Faster. Go. Go."
- I didn't do anything.

914
00:31:47,316 --> 00:31:49,023
- Hey, will you sit down, please?
- Hey, you know what?

915
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:50,982
You bus people are starting
to get on my nerves, okay?

916
00:31:50,983 --> 00:31:53,190
That's it.
Get the fuck off the bus!

917
00:31:53,191 --> 00:31:55,107
Hey, take... wha-what...
hey, what are you doing?

918
00:31:55,108 --> 00:31:57,023
No, you... I...

919
00:31:57,024 --> 00:31:59,691
I have Asperger's!
I'm on the spectrum!

920
00:31:59,692 --> 00:32:01,358
- Ah!
- Get.

921
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:09,400
If I see you on my bus again,
I'm a fuck you up.

922
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,858
Okay.

923
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:21,023
- Oh, Leon!
- Yeah, come on, now.

924
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,107
Come on, now! Whoo!

925
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,982
- Ooh! Yeah.
- Right there.

926
00:32:25,983 --> 00:32:27,649
- Yeah, yeah, here it come.
- Oh!

927
00:32:29,817 --> 00:32:31,899
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

928
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,399
- Oh, my...
- Take that, take that.

929
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,732
Oh, yeah.

930
00:32:34,733 --> 00:32:36,732
- Oh, God.
- Ooh!

931
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:38,357
- Here we go!
- Oh my, God!

932
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:39,649
Oh, my Gawd!

933
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,065
- Oh! Yeah!
- Do I hear a Jew?

934
00:32:42,066 --> 00:32:44,024
I'm not gonna do that!
