Hey! Hey!

13
00:01:53,742 --> 00:01:56,741
Wha... why didn't you
keep the door open?

14
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,574
Oh, um...

15
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:00,157
No... no "after you"?

16
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:05,366
I... I... I didn't really
get an "after you" vibe.

17
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,450
Well... well, why not?
I'm a woman, aren't I?

18
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:10,699
- Yeah...
- Really?

19
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,449
Well, I... I just didn't
think you were the type

20
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,616
who would want a guy to
hold the door open for you.

21
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:16,824
- What type am I?
- You know, you're a type.

22
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,949
You have, uh, short hair,

23
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,491
you wear a tie, you got a vest.

24
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:24,199
It's, uh... it's a look.

25
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,783
So, you looked at me and
then let a door shut on me.

26
00:02:27,784 --> 00:02:29,783
I thought you might not
want that, that's all.

27
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:31,449
I was just trying
not to offend you,

28
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,199
and yet I wound up offending you,
which is quite ironic.

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,074
It is ironic because I would've
enjoyed the door being open for me.

30
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,574
- And... you know what I mean?
- Uh, well,

31
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,699
also there was some
distance involved, too.

32
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,241
- So I would say type plus distance...
- Oh, you have an equation?

33
00:02:45,242 --> 00:02:46,658
- Yeah, type...
- You have an equation for the...

34
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:47,949
Yes, it's
a mathematical equation.

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,699
Type plus distance
equals no door hold.

36
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,407
Where did you get
that equation from?

37
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:53,949
Uh, I made it up.

38
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,783
Well, you know, what kind of
vibe I'm getting from you

39
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:58,824
is that that's a fucked up
equation, you know what I mean?

40
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:02,324
But you can't argue with
the distance, though.

41
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:04,157
That's a...

42
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:05,659
that's a big factor.

43
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:10,366
Huh?!

44
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:13,616
"Fatwa! The Musical,"
written by Larry David.

45
00:03:13,617 --> 00:03:15,949
- Finally!
- Five years.

46
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:17,783
- Five years.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:17,784 --> 00:03:21,449
You wrote a musical
about Salman Rushdie

48
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,533
having his life ruined 'cause
he got a fatwa, a death threat,

49
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:26,533
from the Ayatollah
Khomeini.

50
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:28,241
I'm telling you, there's a
lot of funny stuff in there.

51
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,783
Who do you think about
playing Salman Rushdie

52
00:03:29,784 --> 00:03:31,115
and what about the ayatollah?

53
00:03:31,116 --> 00:03:32,533
Salman Rushdie, I don't know,

54
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:35,366
but, uh, the ayatollah,

55
00:03:35,367 --> 00:03:38,366
I'm actually flirting with
the notion of doing it.

56
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:40,741
- You for the ayatollah?
- I don't know, I probably won't do it.

57
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:43,949
- It's like the odds are...
- The idea sucks, Lar.

58
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:45,699
It's a stupid idea.
It's just a...

59
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,449
- How are you helping?
- ...fatwa.

60
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,032
Really? Oh, like you're
a paragon of tastes.

61
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:52,865
- Yeah.
- Larry, I've seen everything on Broadway.

62
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,824
- This is my office.
- It's a stupid fucking idea!

63
00:03:54,825 --> 00:03:57,533
Fatwa! People don't wanna see that.
They want uplifting. They want...

64
00:03:57,534 --> 00:03:59,407
You don't even know what
you're talking about!

65
00:03:59,408 --> 00:04:01,616
- You sound like a moron. You know that?
- Do I, really?

66
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,199
Yeah, you do.
It's a good idea.

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,949
And by the way, what the hell
are you doing here anyway?

68
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,074
Well, I was in the area
looking... ah... for venues.

69
00:04:08,075 --> 00:04:09,574
- He... does he know?
- No.

70
00:04:09,575 --> 00:04:11,241
Guess who's
getting married.

71
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:14,616
- Sammi's getting married?
- Yes, my little Samella. Yes.

72
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:16,366
- Who's the guy?
- He's a vet.

73
00:04:16,367 --> 00:04:18,491
- An Afghan war vet.
- Really?

74
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,574
- He was a Marine.
- Don't you got to be careful

75
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:23,783
with the, uh, you know,
the PTSD?

76
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:24,907
He doesn't have PTSD.

77
00:04:24,908 --> 00:04:26,574
I would know. I know things.

78
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:28,324
You don't know. You know,
it comes on in a year or two.

79
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:30,865
He could wake up in the middle
of the night and start punching.

80
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:33,115
- What is that? What are you doing?
- He could wake up...

81
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,907
...you know, like that.

82
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:39,407
All right. All right,
you guys are fuckin' morons.

83
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:42,199
Ah, you poor fucker.

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,074
- Your haircut's here.
- Yeah, send her in.

85
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,699
- You get a haircut in the office?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,157
- Betty!
- Hi, Susie! How's it going?

87
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:49,324
- How are you, my love?
- Good.

88
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:50,407
- Hi, Jeff.
- Hiya, Betty.

89
00:04:50,408 --> 00:04:52,282
How are you?
Good to see you.

90
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:53,449
Good to see you.

91
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,325
Huh.

92
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:59,492
So... sorry.

93
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,699
Oh, it's fine. I'm over it.

94
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,783
- Really?
- Yeah, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

95
00:05:04,784 --> 00:05:06,865
He didn't open the door for me.
It was a whole thing.

96
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,616
- I was walking to the door. He didn't open it.
- Because the tie

97
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:10,907
- and the short hair...
- In fact, he let it shut.

98
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:13,449
And then it was offensive
to me, obviously,

99
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,824
because it's just... 'cause he thinks
that I wouldn't want the door open.

100
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:18,741
- Anyway, I'm awfully sorry.
- You know what? It's okay.

101
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:20,783
- Water under the bridge.
- Water under the bridge.

102
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:23,533
That's Betty. Betty, you're
too good, I'll tell ya.

103
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,616
She also happens
to be a lesbian.

104
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,491
And she's marrying her
partner in a few weeks.

105
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,449
She's a lesbian.

106
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,199
She takes such great pride
in having a lesbian friend.

107
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,741
"Oh. Oh, look at me, everybody.

108
00:05:35,742 --> 00:05:38,616
I'm so cool,
I hang out with lesbians."

109
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,199
I had lesbian friends before
you knew what lesbians were.

110
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,407
- Hey, by the way...
- Uh-huh.

111
00:05:43,408 --> 00:05:44,949
...you know,
I could use a haircut.

112
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,699
You could. You could.

113
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,324
And you know what?
I could do it for you.

114
00:05:48,325 --> 00:05:50,616
- Really?
- Yes, yes. I can come to your house.

115
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,658
And I'll open the door for you.

116
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:53,907
- Okay.
- Huh?

117
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:56,157
- Huh? Come on. Right?
- All right.

118
00:05:56,158 --> 00:05:58,324
- Right. Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

119
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,325
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

120
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,574
Hey, it's my long-lost assistant.

121
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,115
Welcome back!

122
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:12,574
- Thank you.
- Welcome back.

123
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:16,824
You had a nice little two-day
unauthorized vacation.

124
00:06:16,825 --> 00:06:18,824
Oh, not...
it wasn't a vacation.

125
00:06:18,825 --> 00:06:21,659
- Oh, it wasn't?
- No, I was... I was very constipated.

126
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:26,533
- I couldn't poop.
- No, I know what constipation is.

127
00:06:26,534 --> 00:06:28,865
You don't come to
work for two days

128
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,616
because you were constipated?

129
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:32,865
Yeah. Luckily it
was only two days.

130
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,074
The whole world is out
there constipated.

131
00:06:35,075 --> 00:06:36,949
Half the population
is constipated.

132
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:40,324
I got married constipated.
People do things constipated.

133
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,407
You wouldn't want me here.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't...

134
00:06:42,408 --> 00:06:44,865
No, I would want you here.
Why wouldn't I want you here?

135
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:48,115
I don't function well with
the feeling of heaviness.

136
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,074
I feel like I'm wearing
a cement inner tube.

137
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,658
- Mm-hmm.
- And now, I mean,

138
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,824
it's about being available
for it to happen.

139
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:56,241
And it hasn't totally happened,
I'm gonna be honest.

140
00:06:56,242 --> 00:06:58,115
The blessed event
hasn't occurred yet?

141
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,407
It's partially occurred,

142
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:03,574
but I'm gonna soldier on
here at the office

143
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:05,157
so that we can get
some stuff done.

144
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,741
You're gonna soldier on. Wow.

145
00:07:07,742 --> 00:07:11,032
Aye, lassie.
I admire your courage.

146
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:14,407
This is one of those fields, like
many, that isn't researched enough.

147
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:19,282
Perhaps, you... you could champion
the cause of constipation.

148
00:07:19,283 --> 00:07:23,241
You could...
you could raise money.

149
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,990
You could go on,
you could have fundraisers.

150
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:28,407
You know, you could...
you could have groups

151
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:31,199
where people who are
constipated get together and...

152
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,449
and talk about their problems.

153
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:33,950
I don't...

154
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:37,115
In fact, you know what else
you might wanna think about?

155
00:07:37,116 --> 00:07:39,907
Instead of sitting
in a chair at your desk,

156
00:07:39,908 --> 00:07:42,324
put in a toilet seat.

157
00:07:42,325 --> 00:07:44,199
You know,
have an office bathroom.

158
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,115
Maybe something to
consider for the future

159
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:47,990
if you wanted to look
into the plumbing.

160
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,907
- Come on. Not a bad idea.
- Um, anyway.

161
00:07:49,908 --> 00:07:53,616
Well, uh, I did get a voicemail,
and Richard Lewis called.

162
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:56,824
And, uh, unfortunately,
his parakeet died.

163
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:58,990
Aw. Hmm.

164
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:02,449
- Had you ever met him?
- Yes. Yes, I did.

165
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,032
- What was he like?
- Bird-like. He was bird-like.

166
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,533
- Yeah.
- You know what? I'll cheer him up.

167
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:09,658
I'll send him a little text.
How about that?

168
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,449
Yeah, well, I think for death,

169
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:13,616
sometimes a text is inadequate.

170
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:16,282
Yes, perhaps if it
were a person,

171
00:08:16,283 --> 00:08:18,574
I would agree with you.

172
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:21,407
All right. Done.
He's gonna love it.

173
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:23,658
Hey, do me a favour.

174
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:26,074
This pen is out of ink.

175
00:08:26,075 --> 00:08:28,282
I need a refill.

176
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:29,824
Okay?

177
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,282
There you go.

178
00:08:31,283 --> 00:08:32,990
And you...

179
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:34,699
There you go.
You got the refill.

180
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,825
You have the refill.

181
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:40,449
You have the refill.

182
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,324
I worry I'm gonna lose
something this small.

183
00:08:43,325 --> 00:08:44,700
You take that.

184
00:08:46,283 --> 00:08:49,115
- And I will look that up.
- Okay.

185
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:50,824
Okay.

186
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:52,658
And think about that toilet.

187
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,658
- The chair toilet.
- All right.

188
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,658
You just sit there at your desk.

189
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,116
Pretty good idea.

190
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,866
Hey.

191
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:30,783
- Come on.
- What's up?

192
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,366
Turn this down. It's too loud.

193
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:34,115
- What's too fucking loud?
- I hear it on the street.

194
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,949
Wait... just wait
a fuckin' minute.

195
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,699
I'll turn this shit down, okay?

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,115
- Yeah. What are you doing?
- Ah. You okay?

197
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:42,324
- Yeah. What are you doing?
- I'm fuckin' lamping. What you doing?

198
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:43,783
You're lamping?

199
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:45,574
Chillin'. Relaxing.

200
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:46,741
Why did you change
it from chillin'?

201
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:47,949
What was wrong with chillin'?

202
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,616
Got to get another one?
Lamping?

203
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:51,407
Lamping. I can sit around here
with some fuckin' boxers on

204
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:53,115
and a tank top with
my feet the fuck up.

205
00:09:53,116 --> 00:09:56,407
And chillin' is what?
You gotta be in real clothes?

206
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,574
- You can walk around and chill.
- Oh.

207
00:09:58,575 --> 00:10:00,574
You upright.
You chillin' upright.

208
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,407
You guys got some great slang,
I gotta say.

209
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:04,699
- The fuck you got?
- We got boss.

210
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,907
That's a boss shirt.

211
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:06,865
- Oh, man.
- Huh?

212
00:10:06,866 --> 00:10:08,241
You can keep that boss shit.

213
00:10:08,242 --> 00:10:10,032
- Keep that bullshit.
- Boss isn't...

214
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,865
boss isn't happening,
is it, huh?

215
00:10:11,866 --> 00:10:13,574
Hey, I wouldn't even say
that shit by mistake.

216
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:16,990
Get this...
my assistant, okay,

217
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,032
doesn't come to
work for two days.

218
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:21,616
You know why?
You know what she tells me?

219
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:23,741
- What?
- She was constipated.

220
00:10:23,742 --> 00:10:27,282
Who doesn't come to work
'cause they're constipated?

221
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,658
Have you ever heard of that?

222
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:30,533
- Fuck, no. Come on, man.
- Ridiculous.

223
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,366
Come on, I shot
a porno constipated.

224
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:35,115
I ran a 5k marathon constipated.

225
00:10:35,116 --> 00:10:36,616
Shit, man, come on.

226
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:39,157
I was in a hot dog-eating
contest constipated.

227
00:10:39,158 --> 00:10:40,783
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

228
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:42,241
You shot a porno?

229
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,574
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Seriously.

230
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:45,824
And a hot dog-eating
contest constipated.

231
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,241
And I still fucking won.
That's not a fucking excuse.

232
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:51,949
You cannot let this bitch use
constipation as something to lean on.

233
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,407
You got to fire that bitch.

234
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:56,157
Yeah, well, that's
easier said than done.

235
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:58,282
It's, you know...
she's got a...

236
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,157
she's got a limp and a cane.

237
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,616
I'd feel sorry for her.

238
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,407
I can't. I can't do it.

239
00:11:03,408 --> 00:11:05,491
And by the way, that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

240
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,074
Okay. What the fuck
else could it be?

241
00:11:07,075 --> 00:11:08,324
I'm not at liberty to...
to say.

242
00:11:08,325 --> 00:11:09,824
- I can't say.
- What is it?

243
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,324
I don't wanna say.
I don't wanna talk about it.

244
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:12,990
You fucking walk all the way
the fuck over here,

245
00:11:12,991 --> 00:11:14,699
you disturb me from
fucking lamping,

246
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,157
and you ain't even gonna fucking
tell me what the fuck it is?

247
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:17,324
I... I... I can't say.

248
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:18,450
Tell me what the fuck going on.

249
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:21,907
Let's just say her
uncle fucked her.

250
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:24,990
- Recently?
- No, no. Years ago.

251
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:26,290
Oh, shit, man.

252
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:28,366
You see... you see the
dilemma that I have?

253
00:11:28,367 --> 00:11:30,324
Between the limp
and the cane and the uncle...

254
00:11:30,325 --> 00:11:32,491
she's unfirable.

255
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:34,491
- God damn it, man, you can't fucking fire her.
- I can't fire her, I know.

256
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:36,449
And the thing about it is that

257
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,324
she was so highly
recommended, too.

258
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:41,032
She used to work for Jimmy Kimmel
and he recommended her to me.

259
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,199
He said she was great,
and she's awful.

260
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,032
Why would he recommend her?

261
00:11:47,033 --> 00:11:48,658
I know what the fuck happened.

262
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,032
He foisted you, man.

263
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:53,865
Fucking Jimmy Kimmel
foisted that bitch on you.

264
00:11:53,866 --> 00:11:55,366
What do you mean?

265
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:56,865
He couldn't fire her either,

266
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,324
so he passed her ass onto you.

267
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,282
Don't you ever allow
yourself to get foisted.

268
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:02,007
You understand?
That fucking limpy-ass girl...

269
00:12:02,008 --> 00:12:03,157
I got foisted.

270
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:05,199
Now, the only way
to resolve this shit,

271
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,366
go in your fucking mind
and you think of someone

272
00:12:08,367 --> 00:12:11,032
you can unload this
limpy bitch onto.

273
00:12:11,033 --> 00:12:13,407
You have to get rid
of this bitch.

274
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:15,533
You know what,
every now and then...

275
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,533
every now and then, yeah,
I gotta say, you surprise me.

276
00:12:19,534 --> 00:12:20,907
Whoo.

277
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,574
Boom. Boom.

278
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,990
Is that still workable?

279
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:25,533
The fist bump?
Is that still...?

280
00:12:25,534 --> 00:12:27,115
There's people still
doing that, yeah.

281
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:29,074
Will you let me know
when that goes out of fashion?

282
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:30,574
When that shit stop,
I'll let you know.

283
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,241
And if you see me
doing anything else

284
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:35,824
that the black community might
frown upon as being uncool,

285
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:37,032
you're gonna let me know.

286
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:38,865
I'll stop your ass.
You know I will.

287
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,408
Now go upstairs
and start lamping.

288
00:12:44,825 --> 00:12:46,491
I'm so excited right now.

289
00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:48,032
- Like, I can't even tell you.
- Sure.

290
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,741
I just never thought that
I'd be having a wedding.

291
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:51,865
- Have you been married?
- I have, yes.

292
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:53,949
So, you've had a wedding,
so you know how awesome it is.

293
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,824
- Yeah, but I wasn't excited in the least.
- Oh, you weren't?

294
00:12:55,825 --> 00:12:58,407
- No. But I never get excited, you know.
- About anything?

295
00:12:58,408 --> 00:12:59,783
No, my mother used to say to me,

296
00:12:59,784 --> 00:13:01,741
"Larry, you...
you never get excited."

297
00:13:01,742 --> 00:13:03,366
- Really?
- "Can't you be excited?"

298
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,199
It... it broke her heart.
I... there's no excitement.

299
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,157
Well, I'm excited,

300
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,949
- so I appreciate you letting me talk.
- That's... that's great.

301
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,115
I have a couple of questions,
logistically,

302
00:13:12,116 --> 00:13:13,533
about how the whole thing works.

303
00:13:13,534 --> 00:13:15,324
- Okay.
- So, when the Rabbi

304
00:13:15,325 --> 00:13:17,282
or the Minister
or whoever says,

305
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,783
"Do you take so and so..."
what's your fiancée's name?

306
00:13:19,784 --> 00:13:20,384
Numa.

307
00:13:20,385 --> 00:13:23,407
Numa. "Do you take Numa to be
your lawfully wedded wife..."

308
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:24,699
It doesn't really
work like that.

309
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,282
Oh. Okay,
but what about, um,

310
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:28,990
"Here Comes The Bride"?
Who gets the song?

311
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:32,115
- I'm getting that song.
- You're getting the song?

312
00:13:32,116 --> 00:13:33,907
You're getting
"Here Comes the Bride"?

313
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:36,032
Yeah. That's my song.

314
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:37,658
I wanted to be the bride

315
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,783
and Numa's actually
always wanted to be the groom,

316
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:41,324
so it worked out good.

317
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:45,949
Not really getting,
uh, bride vibes from you.

318
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,282
Well, that's 'cause
you're not at the wedding...

319
00:13:48,283 --> 00:13:50,241
With all due respect,
yeah, I don't see bride.

320
00:13:50,242 --> 00:13:52,366
I don't see bride,
okay, from here.

321
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:54,533
No, try and see it.
Try and see it.

322
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:56,407
- We're at the wedding...
- I can't see it.

323
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:59,282
- My dad walks me down the... the thing.
- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

324
00:13:59,283 --> 00:14:00,990
I have a veil with, like,

325
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:03,407
- a flower...
- Oh, my God, you got the gown, too?

326
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:06,157
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, this is a huge, huge mistake.

327
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,115
- No, it's... um, it's amazing.
- No.

328
00:14:08,116 --> 00:14:09,325
Look, you got a picture of Numa?

329
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:14,115
Okay, she's beautiful,
obviously.

330
00:14:14,116 --> 00:14:18,574
Okay. That's a...
that's a bride, okay?

331
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:20,824
- Well...
- That's a bride.

332
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,407
That's a groom.

333
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:25,282
Believe me, I say this only
with the best intentions.

334
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:27,491
That's a fuckin' bride.
You a goddamn groom.

335
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,032
- The groom, right?
- You a goddamn groom.

336
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:30,824
- Yeah.
- What's her name?

337
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:33,366
- Numa.
- Numa fine as fuck.

338
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,157
- Right? She is.
- You are one lucky-ass groom.

339
00:14:35,158 --> 00:14:36,574
- Thank you.
- She gorgeous?

340
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,366
I'll see you later. Mm.

341
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:40,032
Hey, we need more peanut butter.

342
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:42,907
Okay, well, we're done.

343
00:14:42,908 --> 00:14:45,533
Oh. Uh, how much do I owe you?

344
00:14:45,534 --> 00:14:48,074
- Uh, 150.
- 150?

345
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,741
Yeah, boy,
you're gonna love that.

346
00:14:49,742 --> 00:14:52,865
Oh, boy, you're making quite
a living there barbering.

347
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:54,366
150 for a bald man?

348
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,865
- For a haircut?
- Yeah, well, you're not bald.

349
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:58,366
- You do have hair.
- Well... yeah.

350
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,032
- So, thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.

351
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,616
Think about what I said.

352
00:15:01,617 --> 00:15:03,949
- Okay?
- Thank you.

353
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,324
You're a lovely girl,
Betty, but, uh,

354
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:08,658
you're not a bride.

355
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,700
Unfortunately. Unfortunately.

356
00:15:19,283 --> 00:15:21,199
So, this is more
of the kick-off,

357
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,658
- and then we'll have a big gala...
- Cheryl?

358
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,241
- Hi. Excuse me.
- Hey!

359
00:15:25,242 --> 00:15:26,824
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.

360
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,865
- Oh, really?
- Thank you for coming.

361
00:15:28,866 --> 00:15:31,157
What is this name, PAM?

362
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:33,115
That's the best you could do?

363
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:35,407
It's like...
it's a cooking spray... PAM.

364
00:15:35,408 --> 00:15:39,616
No, it's People Against
Mutilation, genital mutilation.

365
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:41,449
Yeah, I know what it stands for.

366
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,990
And there are very few charities

367
00:15:42,991 --> 00:15:45,199
that actually focus on the
clitoris and talk about it.

368
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,282
I think you got
half the population

369
00:15:48,283 --> 00:15:49,617
focused on the clitoris.

370
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,824
- I'm deadly focused on it.
- You are?

371
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:54,783
- Yeah.
- Hey.

372
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:57,658
- Hey, Ted!
- How are you?

373
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,949
- I haven't seen you in a while.
- I know!

374
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,699
- I know. It's nice to see you.
- Where's Mary?

375
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,199
Mary? Oh, uh, yeah...

376
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,699
Oh, you know, I haven't
seen you guys for so long.

377
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,366
Mary and I have been separated for,
like, three months, you know.

378
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,783
- The divorce is almost final.
- What?

379
00:16:13,784 --> 00:16:15,449
- My bad. Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

380
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,115
- Holy mackerel.
- I am shocked.

381
00:16:17,116 --> 00:16:19,990
Oh, no, no, no. Truth is I
think we're better friends now

382
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:21,074
than when we were married.

383
00:16:21,075 --> 00:16:22,491
That's total bullshit.

384
00:16:22,492 --> 00:16:24,658
You just... you have
to say that to yourselves

385
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,783
to wean yourself
off the relationship.

386
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,949
- What is that?
- It's a breath spray.

387
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,449
Oh, thank God.
I think Jeff's looking for you.

388
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,074
Yeah, one second.

389
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,658
Gotta go talk to my manager.

390
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,990
- Okay.
- Big stuff happening.

391
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,865
- Ooh.
- Big stuff.

392
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:42,241
- Strangest man on the planet.
- I know.

393
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:44,990
Crazy, crazy exciting.

394
00:16:44,991 --> 00:16:47,032
- Really?
- Yep.

395
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:50,907
Every producer
I sent "Fatwa!" to is in.

396
00:16:50,908 --> 00:16:53,324
- Wow.
- Every producer I talked to.

397
00:16:53,325 --> 00:16:56,990
I've got so many producers
that want to do this.

398
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,990
Look at you, Mr. Broadway.

399
00:16:58,991 --> 00:17:01,157
Got you booked on "Jimmy Kimmel"
to talk about it already.

400
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:02,658
- Really? Do I need to do that?
- Yep.

401
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:04,032
Oh, yeah, you need to do that.

402
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:05,491
Get out there,
start talking about this.

403
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,824
This is very exciting.

404
00:17:07,825 --> 00:17:09,824
Hey, how much does Betty
charge you for a haircut?

405
00:17:09,825 --> 00:17:12,491
- 75.
- She charged me $150.

406
00:17:12,492 --> 00:17:14,282
- Twice as much?
- Twice as much.

407
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,074
- That's crazy.
- I know it's crazy.

408
00:17:16,075 --> 00:17:17,865
- Why would she do something like that?
- I don't know.

409
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:20,199
- She ripped me off.
- You want me to call her?

410
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,282
No, no, no.
I'm gonna say something to her.

411
00:17:22,283 --> 00:17:23,574
- Feel free.
- Good.

412
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,700
Hey, it's Lewis.

413
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:31,908
Come here.

414
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:40,449
- I'll meet you over there.
- Cool, cool.

415
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,700
All right, I'll meet you
over there. Fine.

416
00:17:46,784 --> 00:17:48,741
- Happy?
- No, I'm not, actually.

417
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:50,533
- This is not the middle.
- I don't move again.

418
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:52,574
The middle... the middle
would've been over there.

419
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:55,199
I took way more steps
than you did to get here.

420
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,783
- I'm older than you.
- Hey, by the way, good news about "Fatwa!"

421
00:17:58,784 --> 00:18:00,199
There's a lot of producers
interested in it.

422
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,907
I don't care about
your fucking play,

423
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:03,533
'cause my bird died

424
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:06,907
and you sent the most
ridiculous, despicable text.

425
00:18:06,908 --> 00:18:08,741
"Sorry about your bird.

426
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:11,491
The good news is
I'm still alive."

427
00:18:11,492 --> 00:18:13,115
- Prick.
- Prick?

428
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:15,616
This is a tragedy and you treated
it like it was nothing to me.

429
00:18:15,617 --> 00:18:18,324
- How dare you?
- I... I don't see it as a tragedy.

430
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,074
You don't? Why not?
It's my bird.

431
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,741
- If it was a parrot, it would be a tragedy.
- Oh, really?

432
00:18:21,742 --> 00:18:23,491
Or some exotic bird from Brazil

433
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:25,366
like a macaw or a toucan.

434
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:27,407
I don't live in
a Cuban dancehall.

435
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:31,074
I live in my own home
and it doesn't take toucans.

436
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:33,366
You know, it's a dead parakeet.
That's a funny thing.

437
00:18:33,367 --> 00:18:35,865
I loved him.
It was unconditional love.

438
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:38,074
- It was... even...
- Unconditional love?

439
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,449
- He came over...
- He doesn't know you from a hole in the wall.

440
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,074
He knows me. He knew you.
Remember he came over once?

441
00:18:42,075 --> 00:18:44,407
He went, "Seinfeld, Seinfeld."
He loved you, too.

442
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:46,324
I'm not quite sure
it was "Seinfeld."

443
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:48,533
And you... you thought
that was "Seinfeld."

444
00:18:48,534 --> 00:18:50,115
- Yeah.
- No.

445
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:52,032
Yeah, that's not Seinfeld.

446
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:55,449
You know why I'm laughing?
At the sadness of your entire existence.

447
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,907
- Well...
- You're so unjust...

448
00:18:56,908 --> 00:18:58,699
I take that as a
great compliment.

449
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,282
Well, there's a lack
of empathy and compassion

450
00:19:00,283 --> 00:19:02,491
and sympathy for practically
everything in your life.

451
00:19:02,492 --> 00:19:04,282
There's a lack of everything.

452
00:19:04,283 --> 00:19:06,241
- Don't you feel good about...
- Look, you're a comedian.

453
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:08,115
You're supposed to be able
to take a joke, you know?

454
00:19:08,116 --> 00:19:10,115
You're supposed to laugh
about everything.

455
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:12,407
Just because I'm a comedian, I have
to find everything in the world funny?

456
00:19:12,408 --> 00:19:13,699
Yes, everything's funny.

457
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,241
You're devoid of anything

458
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:17,783
that's remotely caring
or empathetic.

459
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:20,990
- And it's sad, and I...
- Are you sure a dead parakeet isn't funny?

460
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:22,449
This, to me, is a tragedy.

461
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,324
- I'm gonna go.
- I'm gonna go, too.

462
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:26,990
- I'm going this way.
- No, no, I'm going this way.

463
00:19:26,991 --> 00:19:28,533
No, you came from that way.

464
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:30,324
You go that way,
I'll go this way.

465
00:19:30,325 --> 00:19:31,325
No, I wanna go that way.

466
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,074
- Oh, hi.
- Oh, hey.

467
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,658
I'm late, I'm late. I know.

468
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:39,324
Nice of you to show up.

469
00:19:39,325 --> 00:19:41,449
Well, Larry,
I've been so crazy busy.

470
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,824
I've never been
like this in my life.

471
00:19:42,825 --> 00:19:44,574
Did Jeff tell you
about my new business?

472
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:45,949
I heard something. What is it?

473
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,324
Soaps On.

474
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:51,199
It's a skin care,
bath products, all organic...

475
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,115
- Soaps On?
- ...sustainable.

476
00:19:53,116 --> 00:19:55,324
Could you come up with
a worse name than Soaps On?

477
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,616
It's a great name.
You know, you don't know

478
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,115
what the fuck
you're talking about.

479
00:19:58,116 --> 00:20:00,199
- It's a great name.
- Okay, good, good.

480
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,616
So, what have you been doing?
You've been working at night on it?

481
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:05,699
Nonstop. I think I'm gonna
have to hire an assistant.

482
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,699
I think I have to maybe...
maybe more than one.

483
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,157
What?

484
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:14,032
Did I just hear you say you
needed to hire an assistant?

485
00:20:14,033 --> 00:20:16,990
I think I do, yeah. I'm burning
the candles on both ends.

486
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,032
- Oh, my God.
- What?

487
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:23,074
Well, you know, I'm gonna be
going to New York to do the play.

488
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,574
Yeah, "Fatwa!"

489
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:27,074
And I'm not gonna be able
to take my assistant.

490
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:28,990
- She's good?
- Oh, good?

491
00:20:28,991 --> 00:20:30,783
She's... she's the best
I ever had.

492
00:20:30,784 --> 00:20:32,449
Well, what's her history?
Where... where is she...

493
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,241
- Oh, she worked for Kimmel.
- Jimmy Kimmel?

494
00:20:34,242 --> 00:20:36,200
- Yeah.
- Oh, he's a big star.

495
00:20:37,617 --> 00:20:39,658
- Ah...
- What? What?

496
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:40,907
- Come on, what?
- Eh...

497
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:43,032
- What?
- I can't give her up.

498
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,824
- I... I can't. She's...
- What are you gonna use her for?

499
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:48,907
You're gonna be on the phone with
her here and you're in New York?

500
00:20:48,908 --> 00:20:51,533
That's ridiculous.
That doesn't make any sense.

501
00:20:51,534 --> 00:20:54,032
You need to hire
a new assistant in New York

502
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,616
and let me take this one.

503
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:56,783
What the hell?
You can have her!

504
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:58,865
- Ah! Yay!
- Huh? Yeah!

505
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,074
- Oh, I love you so much!
- Ha ha! Yeah?

506
00:21:01,075 --> 00:21:02,741
Oh, this is great!
I feel like a weight

507
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:05,032
has been lifted
off my shoulders, Lar.

508
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:07,074
- Me, too.
- You won't be sorry.

509
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:09,074
Trust me. Fantastic!

510
00:21:09,075 --> 00:21:11,324
Pretty good.

511
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:16,617
Pretty, pretty, pretty,
pretty good.

512
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,241
I'm not saying
you can't be the groom.

513
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:29,990
I'm just saying I think I
might not be the bride.

514
00:21:29,991 --> 00:21:33,491
I saw myself and then I'm
gonna walk down the...

515
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:35,699
Wha... Larry?
What are you doing here?

516
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,324
The door...
the door was ajar.

517
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,658
You! You're the one
that put this in her head?

518
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:46,491
- What? What? I...
- What is your agenda, man?

519
00:21:46,492 --> 00:21:49,491
- No, I didn't do anything.
- Of course he just shows up, too.

520
00:21:49,492 --> 00:21:52,449
- Out of nowhere. Just... you're here now.
- The door was ajar.

521
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,949
The... you left the door ajar.

522
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,741
You have no business weighing
in on this wedding, okay?

523
00:21:56,742 --> 00:21:58,533
It's not completely
his fault, um, but...

524
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,449
No, I just thought...

525
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,074
look, you're a beautiful bride.

526
00:22:02,075 --> 00:22:03,824
- You should be a bride.
- I'm the groom.

527
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,157
I don't wanna be the bride.

528
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,199
You're not groomy,
she's not bridey.

529
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,800
You know...

530
00:22:07,801 --> 00:22:10,115
How is it appropriate for you
to have an opinion about this?

531
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:13,366
Well, because I know her.
She gave me a haircut.

532
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,741
She charged a lot of money
for it, by the way.

533
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,783
What kind of psychopath

534
00:22:17,784 --> 00:22:21,324
interferes with the nuances
of a lesbian wedding?

535
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:25,157
Hey, I saw wrong and tried
to right it. That's all.

536
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:26,741
- I can't believe...
- That's what Ted Kennedy said

537
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:28,824
about Robert Kennedy
at his funeral.

538
00:22:28,825 --> 00:22:30,449
I'm... I'm like
Robert Kennedy.

539
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,366
You know what's not
Robert Kennedy-ish?

540
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,491
- Hmm?
- Wandering into people's homes

541
00:22:34,492 --> 00:22:35,949
and spouting nonsense.

542
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,324
Oh. Okay.
Well, don't leave the door ajar.

543
00:22:38,325 --> 00:22:39,699
- Stop saying "ajar"!
- Okay.

544
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,157
What is really going on here?
Do you need a hobby?

545
00:22:42,158 --> 00:22:43,949
Not a terrible idea.

546
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,157
You're... you're right
about that.

547
00:22:45,158 --> 00:22:46,865
That's... that's a good idea.

548
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:48,907
I just can't seem
to find the motivation.

549
00:22:48,908 --> 00:22:51,199
You know, when I was a kid,
I would collect butterflies.

550
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,324
I would go in the park,
I had a... a net,

551
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,074
and I would...
I would use the net.

552
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:57,366
I cannot tell you how much
satisfaction there is

553
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:59,407
in trapping a
butterfly in a net...

554
00:22:59,408 --> 00:23:01,824
I didn't expect you to
actually answer...

555
00:23:01,825 --> 00:23:04,699
I didn't expect an actual
answer to that question!

556
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,157
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter about him.

557
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:07,741
- It doesn't...
- I'm done.

558
00:23:07,742 --> 00:23:10,491
It doesn't matter about him.
I just want you to be happy.

559
00:23:10,492 --> 00:23:13,574
I want us to have a successful
wedding and a successful life.

560
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:14,949
- Fantastic.
- I'll do anything you want.

561
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,200
- Whatever you want.
- I wanna be the groom.

562
00:23:18,492 --> 00:23:19,907
You waited too long.

563
00:23:19,908 --> 00:23:21,366
That's everything
I need to know.

564
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,199
- No, no, no!
- Here is your ring.

565
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,658
- I wish this friendship the best.
- No. Oh...

566
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,865
- What...?
- Aw, come on.

567
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:28,366
No. No, don't... no.

568
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,783
Come, come... no.

569
00:23:29,784 --> 00:23:32,074
- Here, allow me.
- What the fuck are you doing?

570
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:32,683
No good?

571
00:23:32,684 --> 00:23:35,033
I don't need you to hold
the door for me, you prick.

572
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:38,783
You see?
See what happens?

573
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,241
I held the door,
she didn't like it.

574
00:23:40,242 --> 00:23:41,907
You chastised me
for holding the door.

575
00:23:41,908 --> 00:23:44,574
What's a guy supposed to do?
I'm betwixt and between.

576
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:46,741
- Why are you here?
- I'll tell you why I'm here.

577
00:23:46,742 --> 00:23:49,199
'Cause I asked Jeff what you
charged him for a haircut

578
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,741
and he told me $75.

579
00:23:50,742 --> 00:23:52,574
- Uh-huh.
- You charged me $150.

580
00:23:52,575 --> 00:23:53,990
- Mm-hmm.
- What's up with that?

581
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,700
Get the fuck out of my house.

582
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:58,950
Okay.

583
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:05,115
Are you sure...?

584
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:07,283
Okay, I got it. I got that.

585
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,533
I've got some news.

586
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:18,282
Wha... what is it?

587
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:20,616
Okay, 'cause of the musical,
I might be going to New York.

588
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:24,241
And I thought,
"What am I gonna do about Mara?"

589
00:24:24,242 --> 00:24:25,616
So, guess what.

590
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:28,990
I got you a job with my friend,

591
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:31,616
a very close friend of mine,
as her assistant.

592
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:34,324
She's starting this new
company called Soaps On

593
00:24:34,325 --> 00:24:38,282
- for natural bath and beauty products...
- Larry, th-thank you. I...

594
00:24:38,283 --> 00:24:40,074
This woman really knows
what she's doing.

595
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:43,741
And by the way,
she's such a terrific person.

596
00:24:43,742 --> 00:24:46,741
This woman's a...
she's a fucking saint, okay?

597
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:50,157
Well, okay. I mean...

598
00:24:50,158 --> 00:24:52,282
Don't take this the wrong way.

599
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,574
Always, this job
felt a little bit

600
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:56,616
- like it wasn't challenging enough.
- Is that so?

601
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:58,658
So this... this could be
a good opportunity.

602
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:00,491
We can start right now.

603
00:25:00,492 --> 00:25:03,157
Yeah, let's pack you up and let's
get you the hell out of here.

604
00:25:03,158 --> 00:25:05,449
- Thank you.
- Thank you for all the, the, the work,

605
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,407
the hard work that you did, even though
it wasn't very challenging at all.

606
00:25:08,408 --> 00:25:11,224
- And I don't even know what you did exactly,
- You know, I just... it just...

607
00:25:11,225 --> 00:25:12,990
...but you claim to have done
something, but I'm sure you did.

608
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:14,282
Anyway, let's go.

609
00:25:14,283 --> 00:25:15,616
- There we go.
- Careful.

610
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:17,616
There we go. You got this,
you got all this.

611
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,907
Oh, look, you got little
cookies and cakes here.

612
00:25:19,908 --> 00:25:21,449
Okay, take the plant. Yeah.

613
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,282
There you go. Okay.

614
00:25:23,283 --> 00:25:25,199
Take your water. Get this out.

615
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,658
- I just...
- What else? We're done. We're good.

616
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,491
There we go.

617
00:25:29,492 --> 00:25:32,449
Okay. Oh, yeah, you're
gonna have a good time.

618
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,090
Oh, thanks.

619
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:34,990
Yeah. Can't you walk a little
faster with that thing?

620
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,074
They... they have Olympic events
for that. They speed along.

621
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:41,949
Do you want to get
a celebratory drink or...?

622
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,824
Nah. I don't think so.

623
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:47,407
All right, then. Well, should we...
should we hug goodbye?

624
00:25:47,408 --> 00:25:50,783
I'll tell you what.
Let's do one of these.

625
00:25:50,784 --> 00:25:52,115
There we go.

626
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:53,699
Now you got your box,
we had a little hug.

627
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,824
- Thanks, Larry.
- All right, you take care.

628
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:57,115
- All right.
- We'll see ya.

629
00:25:57,116 --> 00:25:58,865
- Bye, Leon.
- Give my best to Susie.

630
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:00,659
- Tell her I said hi.
- See ya.

631
00:26:04,617 --> 00:26:07,949
Tell me that's what
the fuck I think it is.

632
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,199
- That's a foist.
- Mm, fuck!

633
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,907
That was a foist!

634
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:13,324
- My man, look at you.
- Yep!

635
00:26:13,325 --> 00:26:14,865
- You did it!
- Huh? How 'bout that?

636
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,658
She ain't gonna limp her ass
back up in here, right?

637
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:18,241
- Oh, no chance.
- Draggin' that goddamn foot, right?

638
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,533
No chance.
She's been foisted, man.

639
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,282
So she's not coming back?

640
00:26:21,283 --> 00:26:22,949
- Nope.
- She's out of here for good?

641
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,574
Out.

642
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:27,366
I can do this.

643
00:26:27,367 --> 00:26:28,865
What? What are you
talkin' about?

644
00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:30,115
I can do this shit.

645
00:26:30,116 --> 00:26:31,574
What? Do what shit?

646
00:26:31,575 --> 00:26:33,282
I can be your new assistant.

647
00:26:33,283 --> 00:26:35,699
Oh, no, no, no.

648
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,282
That's...
that's impossible.

649
00:26:38,283 --> 00:26:40,033
Come on, man.

650
00:26:43,033 --> 00:26:46,242
Larry David's office.
What the fuck is up?

651
00:26:47,825 --> 00:26:50,116
Oh, I'm sorry,
that bitch got foisted.

652
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:56,074
You only get half price 'cause
you drive a goddamn Smart car.

653
00:26:56,075 --> 00:26:57,574
All right?

654
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:58,908
Don't call me no fucking more.

655
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:01,324
Mm.

656
00:27:01,325 --> 00:27:02,741
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey, how you doin'?

657
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:04,449
What's happening?
Good to see you.

658
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,324
- Good to see you. Hi.
- How are you? Welcome.

659
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,990
- What's going on?
- Not... this is Leon, by the way.

660
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:10,824
- This is Jimmy.
- Good to be here, baby.

661
00:27:10,825 --> 00:27:12,824
- Good to have you here.
- He's my temporary assistant.

662
00:27:12,825 --> 00:27:14,699
Hold on, hold on.

663
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,949
Hey, Jeff. What's up?

664
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,616
- Hey. Is that for me?
- We at "Jimmy Kimmel."

665
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:20,949
I'm gonna take it outside.

666
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,241
Fucking good as fuck.

667
00:27:22,242 --> 00:27:24,324
- What is this, crudité?
- Yeah, crudité, yeah.

668
00:27:24,325 --> 00:27:25,907
Crudi-take.

669
00:27:25,908 --> 00:27:27,157
All right?

670
00:27:27,158 --> 00:27:28,282
What are you doing?
Don't take that.

671
00:27:28,283 --> 00:27:29,949
It's fine because...
no, we...

672
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,241
- it's not like we reuse it.
- Hey, are you nuts?

673
00:27:32,242 --> 00:27:34,616
- Put the fucking thing back, you asshole.
- Fuck you, Larry! Fuck you!

674
00:27:34,617 --> 00:27:36,699
So, Jeff...

675
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,616
- He's not gonna take it. It's a joke.
- Okay. Yeah.

676
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,783
- How you doing? Everything all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Good.

677
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:43,616
- What have you been up to?
- Uh, you know, just lampin'.

678
00:27:43,617 --> 00:27:46,616
Lamping?
Like L-A-M-P-I-N-G?

679
00:27:46,617 --> 00:27:48,074
There's no "G" at the end.
Lampin'.

680
00:27:48,075 --> 00:27:50,324
Lampin'. Okay.
All right. Is that...

681
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:52,865
- It's black slang. I pick it up from him.
- Oh, okay. Oh, all right.

682
00:27:52,866 --> 00:27:55,407
- I didn't realize that.
- But, um... let me, uh...

683
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:57,616
let me congratulate you,
by the way.

684
00:27:57,617 --> 00:27:58,907
Oh, thank... on what?

685
00:27:58,908 --> 00:28:03,324
On the wonderful, fantastic job

686
00:28:03,325 --> 00:28:04,907
of foisting that you did.

687
00:28:04,908 --> 00:28:06,949
- What do you mean?
- Nice job.

688
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,991
You foisted Mara on me.

689
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,115
I did foist her on you.

690
00:28:13,116 --> 00:28:15,574
- I did. I really did foist her on you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

691
00:28:15,575 --> 00:28:17,366
- Fantastic foist.
- I told...

692
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,783
and by the way, Marty Short
foisted her on me.

693
00:28:19,784 --> 00:28:22,533
He foisted her on you.
Okay, well, guess what.

694
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,824
You've gotta now foist
her on somebody else.

695
00:28:24,825 --> 00:28:26,574
- Yeah.
- Done. It's already done.

696
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:28,032
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

697
00:28:28,033 --> 00:28:29,907
- It feels good, right?
- Thank you. Oh, my God.

698
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,658
It's like a pyramid
scheme, almost.

699
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:33,366
Uh, yeah. In a way, yes.

700
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:35,074
Eventually there will...
somebody at the end

701
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:36,324
will have to marry her.

702
00:28:36,325 --> 00:28:38,574
- Exactly! Exactly, yeah.
- Yeah.

703
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:40,741
Well, thanks for coming.
It's great to have you here.

704
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:42,366
- Yeah, thanks. I'll see you out there.
- All right, see you out there.

705
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:43,699
- Take it easy.
- It's gonna be fun.

706
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,865
Now, um, I understand
you have a new project.

707
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:47,282
New... something
you're working on.

708
00:28:47,283 --> 00:28:49,199
Yes, yes. I've, uh...

709
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,241
I've written a musical
for Broadway.

710
00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:55,533
- Mm-hmm?
- It's called, uh, "Fatwa!"

711
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,366
"Fatwa"?

712
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,533
- "Fatwa!"
- And what is a fatwa?

713
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:05,032
A fatwa is a death sentence
handed out by the ayatollah.

714
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:06,366
And this is a comedy?

715
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,157
- Yes, yes.
- Okay. All right.

716
00:29:08,158 --> 00:29:09,533
It's a musical comedy.

717
00:29:09,534 --> 00:29:10,658
The ayatollah's in it.

718
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:12,032
Oh, the ayatollah is in it?

719
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,366
Of course the ayatollah
is in it.

720
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,157
How can you have a fatwa
without an ayatollah?

721
00:29:15,158 --> 00:29:16,407
You do need
an ayatollah, right.

722
00:29:16,408 --> 00:29:18,282
What appeals to you
about the ayatollah?

723
00:29:18,283 --> 00:29:20,783
The whole... you know,
the denunciation.

724
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:22,949
There's a lot of
denunciation going on.

725
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,658
- The denunciation, okay.
- All day long, he's denunciating.

726
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:29,199
- He does do a lot of that.
- He does a lot of this, a lot of, you know.

727
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,407
- Uh-huh.
- By the way, I just did it four times.

728
00:29:31,408 --> 00:29:33,074
I started to get
denunciation elbows.

729
00:29:33,075 --> 00:29:35,324
- You have to be careful.
- Yeah, you gotta be careful.

730
00:29:35,325 --> 00:29:38,241
- You can kill yourself.
- It's not easy to be the ayatollah.

731
00:29:38,242 --> 00:29:40,074
It requires a lot of energy.
Yeah, yeah.

732
00:29:40,075 --> 00:29:43,616
How many ayatollahs are there?
Are there only one ayatollah?

733
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,074
Well, now there's
only one ayatollah,

734
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,574
and they all seem to
have the same name

735
00:29:47,575 --> 00:29:49,824
and they all seem to
spell it the same way.

736
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:53,658
And you never know... if you
look at the history of ayatollahs,

737
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,658
they... it all seems
like one person.

738
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:58,199
- Yeah, yeah.
- They all look exactly the same,

739
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,741
and their names are Khamenei,
Khameeni, Khomani.

740
00:30:01,742 --> 00:30:03,824
In a way, it's like the way KFC

741
00:30:03,825 --> 00:30:05,590
has the different comedians
play Colonel Sanders.

742
00:30:05,591 --> 00:30:08,949
- Yes.. yes. It's the same thing.
- What else about the ayatollah do you know?

743
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,407
He's, uh...
he doesn't like Waze.

744
00:30:11,408 --> 00:30:15,324
He likes... he likes to...
he likes to navigate on his own, you know?

745
00:30:15,325 --> 00:30:17,241
- Oh, Waze, okay.
- Yeah, he doesn't like Waze.

746
00:30:17,242 --> 00:30:20,115
He gets in the car. Don't tell...
don't give him any direction.

747
00:30:20,116 --> 00:30:21,699
He doesn't like
to be told things.

748
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,949
"I know how to go.

749
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,115
The Waze takes me to...
to El Mansour Boulevard

750
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,141
and gives me a left turn in
rush hour. No good." You know.

751
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:32,658
I feel like maybe I've been
in an Uber with the ayatollah,

752
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:35,074
'cause I've heard
this very same dialogue.

753
00:30:35,075 --> 00:30:37,533
- That's possible. Yeah.
- Yeah.

754
00:30:37,534 --> 00:30:39,533
Do you know about
the ayatollah's life?

755
00:30:39,534 --> 00:30:41,658
Like, does he...
does he eat cereal?

756
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:43,115
He loves granola.

757
00:30:43,116 --> 00:30:44,116
- He does?
- Yes.

758
00:30:50,116 --> 00:30:52,199
Well, well. Look at you.

759
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,658
You got here ahead of me.
I can't believe it.

760
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,491
God damn right.
I'm doing my fucking dizzle, baby.

761
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:58,616
Jesus, you're... you're workin'.

762
00:30:58,617 --> 00:31:01,699
Hey, that ayatollah bit you did on
"Kimmel" was fucking great.

763
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,074
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

764
00:31:03,075 --> 00:31:04,449
- You liked it?
- I fuckin' loved it.

765
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,199
Oh, good.

766
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,324
Larry David's office.
What's up?

767
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:11,491
- Let me speak to Larry.
- It's Jeff.

768
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:13,282
Okay, transfer it to here.

769
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:14,200
How?

770
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:19,199
- I don't know.
- What's taking so long? Get Larry!

771
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,908
Hold on, Jeff. Hold on.

772
00:31:23,534 --> 00:31:25,074
- Hey.
- Turn on the TV!

773
00:31:25,075 --> 00:31:26,699
- What channel?
- Every channel!

774
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,366
Every goddamn channel!

775
00:31:28,367 --> 00:31:31,199
You're a complete
and total fuck-up.

776
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,074
You're a total, total fuck-up.

777
00:31:33,075 --> 00:31:36,533
Larry David, who you may know as
the co-creator of "Seinfeld,"

778
00:31:36,534 --> 00:31:38,199
went on "Jimmy Kimmel Live"
last night

779
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,324
to talk about his new
musical called "Fatwa!"

780
00:31:41,325 --> 00:31:44,865
in which the ayatollah
is one of the main characters.

781
00:31:44,866 --> 00:31:49,199
There's a small harem. Uh, he
has a fetish for redheads.

782
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,865
And twice a year, he goes to
Ireland on a harem shopping spree.

783
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:56,907
Today, the Ayatollah
Abdullah Kazemaini of Iran

784
00:31:56,908 --> 00:31:59,157
has accused Larry David
of blasphemy,

785
00:31:59,158 --> 00:32:03,157
issuing an actual fatwa and calling
for the death of the comedian.

786
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:05,617
Here's what the ayatollah
had to say.

787
00:32:07,617 --> 00:32:08,700
...Larry David.

788
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:12,574
..."Seinfeld."

789
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:14,491
- What the fuck?!
- "What the fuck" is right.

790
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:16,324
No one would dare insult

791
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:17,574
the sacred beliefs of Muslims,

792
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:18,990
nor disparage our honour.

793
00:32:18,991 --> 00:32:20,824
I didn't disparage.
There was no disparage.

794
00:32:20,825 --> 00:32:23,157
- You did disparage.
- No, no. I didn't disparage!

795
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:25,741
I begged you not to
imitate the ayatollah.

796
00:32:25,742 --> 00:32:27,324
- No, you didn't!
- I told Leon.

797
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:29,324
I said you got to get
this message to him.

798
00:32:29,325 --> 00:32:31,907
Jeff told you to tell me
not to do the ayatollah?

799
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,324
I didn't fucking remember. How the
fuck am I gonna remember that shit?

800
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:36,074
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

801
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:39,115
- I didn't know what the fuck...
- Oh, my God! What the fuck?!

802
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:40,533
...Larry David!

803
00:32:40,534 --> 00:32:41,907
So I call on valiant Muslims,

804
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:43,241
wherever they may be,

805
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:44,982
to kill Larry David
without delay.

806
00:32:44,983 --> 00:32:45,633
What?!

807
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,533
And whoever may die in this
cause will be a martyr.

808
00:32:47,534 --> 00:32:49,865
No! I'll repent!
I'll be punished!

809
00:32:49,866 --> 00:32:53,074
Even if Larry David repents,
he will be condemned to death.

810
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:55,699
I'll... I'll convert!
I'll become a Muslim!

811
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,616
Even if Larry David
converts to Islam,

812
00:32:57,617 --> 00:32:59,574
he should still be sent to hell.

813
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:02,449
- Jeff!
- You got a fucking fatwa!

814
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,491
- I got a fatwa!
- You got fatwa'd!

815
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:06,282
No!

816
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:08,491
Gentlemen, the FBI takes
this very seriously.

817
00:33:08,492 --> 00:33:11,032
But it's nothing that you
really need to worry about.

818
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:12,949
What the... that's
so easy for you to say.

819
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,199
I... the ayatollah
mentioned my name.

820
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,658
The fucking guy was on
television, screaming my name.

821
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:20,616
Larry David!

822
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:24,115
Larry David!

823
00:33:24,116 --> 00:33:25,658
I'm doing Spanish,
it sounds like.

824
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:27,449
Larry David!

825
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:33,074
Quick question. Um, what about
friends of people that have fatwas?

826
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,449
Fatwa by association.

827
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,783
What kind of fucking
question is that?

828
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:37,157
- Do I associate with you?
- Yeah.

829
00:33:37,158 --> 00:33:39,407
Okay. I wanna know what
my situation is.

830
00:33:39,408 --> 00:33:42,032
Fatwa by association.
What do you know about it?

831
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:43,865
- You're fine as well.
- I am?

832
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:47,533
- You're fine.
- Hey, I got an idea.

833
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:50,824
I go on the "Jimmy Kimmel"
show and I apologize.

834
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:53,491
- I apologize to the ayatollah.
- You think I didn't think of that?

835
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:54,824
I've already talked
to the "Kimmel" show.

836
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:56,324
They want nothing
to do with you.

837
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,074
This whole thing's
falling apart.

838
00:33:58,075 --> 00:34:00,491
Every "Fatwa!" producer
has called me.

839
00:34:00,492 --> 00:34:01,659
This is all dead.

840
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:20,366
Hey.

841
00:34:20,367 --> 00:34:22,866
- It's me.
- Holy shit.

842
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:28,533
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?

843
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:31,032
- I'm wearing a disguise.
- You think that's gonna help?

844
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:33,115
Yeah, well, it couldn't hurt.
What am I supposed to do?

845
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:35,199
Disguises have been employed
effectively in the past.

846
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,366
Tyra Banks dressed up
as a fat person on her show

847
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:38,699
to see what it's
like being fat.

848
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,199
Needless to say,
it wasn't very pleasant.

849
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,616
Have you ever seen
"Undercover Boss"?

850
00:34:41,617 --> 00:34:43,407
The guy goes undercover,
nobody even knows who he is.

851
00:34:43,408 --> 00:34:45,574
He's the boss of the whole company.
He fools everybody.

852
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,324
Well, you know what
the good news is?

853
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:49,074
I'm still alive.

854
00:34:49,075 --> 00:34:50,199
You know what?

855
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,783
That's not funny.

856
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:53,241
- It's not funny.
- You know, you're a comedian.

857
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:54,741
You should be able
to take a joke.

858
00:34:54,742 --> 00:34:56,658
What, you're comparing this
to your dead parakeet?

859
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,533
- Nothing compares to my dead parakeet.
- Yeah.

860
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:00,033
Larry David!

861
00:35:04,075 --> 00:35:05,907
- I know you're in here. I saw your car.
- Holy shit.

862
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:08,449
- Fatwa?
- No, lesbian bride.

863
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:12,366
Larry David?
Where the fuck are you, Larry?

864
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,907
Prepare to die, baldy.

865
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:18,115
I know you're in here, Larry!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

866
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,990
And the next time a door's ajar,

867
00:35:19,991 --> 00:35:22,075
maybe stay the fuck out!

868
00:35:24,408 --> 00:35:26,949
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

869
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,283
Larry fucking David!

870
00:36:02,617 --> 00:36:04,282
Fatwa?!

871
00:36:04,283 --> 00:36:07,242
No, cocksucker. Foisted!
