1
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:13,750
- Huh? Is that amazing?
- That is...

2
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,416
- Unbelievable story!
- You know what?

3
00:00:15,417 --> 00:00:17,208
None of it
would have happened

4
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:20,708
if I didn't intercede on that
guy's behalf in the restaurant.

5
00:00:20,709 --> 00:00:22,833
- Unbelievable, Larry.
- It saved your life.

6
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:24,917
- Saved my life.
- What if he hadn't wanted seconds?

7
00:00:24,918 --> 00:00:26,458
None of this
would have happened.

8
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:27,750
- None of it would have happened.
- Bashert.

9
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:30,333
The fatwa is over!

10
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,500
- Yes!
- The fatwa is over!

11
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,917
Let's drink to that, huh?

12
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:34,458
It's a new me.
It's a new me.

13
00:00:34,459 --> 00:00:36,541
Well, whatever.
We're glad you're back, Larry.

14
00:00:36,542 --> 00:00:38,249
- Thank you, Susie.
- Welcome.

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,625
I didn't even tell you
the biggest news.

16
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:42,416
"Fatwa! the Musical"
is back on.

17
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,667
- It is?
- Whoa, wait... wait a second.

18
00:00:44,668 --> 00:00:46,375
You're jumping the gun
a little bit.

19
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:49,083
We're having a meeting with
Lin-Manuel Miranda this week,

20
00:00:49,084 --> 00:00:50,583
and if he wants to do it, then...

21
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,625
You're meeting with
Lin-Manuel Miranda? Oh, my...

22
00:00:53,626 --> 00:00:56,583
It's the only way it can go
forward... is if he's in it.

23
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:58,917
He's in LA now, right? Isn't it...
aren't they doing the show here?

24
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:00,833
Yeah, they're doing "Hamilton."

25
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:03,124
Yeah, can you get us tickets?
I mean, it's here.

26
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:04,958
No, it's here and we can't
even get tickets to it!

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,166
Already with the "Hamilton"
tickets? Are you kidding?

28
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,792
- I would love some, too.
- Huh?

29
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:10,041
I don't know if I can
get you tickets.

30
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:11,667
I haven't even met the guy yet.

31
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:13,792
- You saw it, right?
- Yeah, I saw it in New York.

32
00:01:13,793 --> 00:01:15,750
- Fantastic.
- Isn't it so fantastic?

33
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,208
Oh, my God, I love that show.
Incredible.

34
00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:19,416
I saw it and I played...

35
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:21,792
36 holes of golf that day.

36
00:01:21,793 --> 00:01:26,291
And, uh, I fell asleep before
the second act of "Hamilton."

37
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:27,532
- You're kidding.
- I slept through...

38
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,833
I slept through the intermission.

39
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,999
- No!
- You fell asleep? Wait a minute.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Only you would fall asleep at
the hottest show on Broadway.

41
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,416
- Hey, hey. Guys, guys.
- How did you fall asleep?

42
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,875
- It's so exciting and interesting.
- The Shucker.

43
00:01:37,876 --> 00:01:39,500
- Excuse me, the Shucker.
- Oh, the Shucker.

44
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:41,583
- Hey, how's everybody doing?
- Hello.

45
00:01:41,584 --> 00:01:43,124
- Taste good?
- Fantastic.

46
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,541
It's all good? No grit?

47
00:01:44,542 --> 00:01:45,999
- No grit.
- Okay, no grit.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,999
Just shuck and awe.
Okay, well, that's great.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,249
I've got a...
I got a whole bunch of bluepoints.

50
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,999
Got some Kusshis for you all.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,208
- Whoo!
- Hope you left some room.

52
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,083
- Okay.
- I know he did.

53
00:01:56,084 --> 00:01:57,792
Fantastic.
Cute as could be.

54
00:01:57,793 --> 00:01:59,667
- Ay, God.
- Shucking?

55
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:01,416
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

56
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:03,875
- What happened?
- He overheard that entire story

57
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,667
about me sleeping
through "Hamilton."

58
00:02:05,668 --> 00:02:07,375
What do you care?
What difference does it make?

59
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,375
I just hope it doesn't
get back to... to Lin.

60
00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:11,500
I doubt that, Larry.
You're paranoid.

61
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:13,875
He shucks all over town. I don't
know what circles he shucks in.

62
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:16,667
He could shuck and tell.

63
00:02:16,668 --> 00:02:19,208
- I'll be back.
- Do you think we can still get the tickets?

64
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:21,083
Who's ringing the bell
this time of night?

65
00:02:21,084 --> 00:02:22,792
It's Lin-Manuel Miranda.

66
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:25,041
I think he heard about the...

67
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:29,375
Hello, I'm Rose Shapiro.
Remember me?

68
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:30,458
No.

69
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:32,875
I sold you this house
five years ago.

70
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:34,208
Oh, okay.

71
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:37,333
Um, well, what can I do for you?

72
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:39,416
Well, I was in the neighborhood

73
00:02:39,417 --> 00:02:41,124
and I thought I'd just pop in

74
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,416
and see how my house is doing
if that's okay with you.

75
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:47,458
Actually, I'm... sorry,
I've got some dinner guests, so.

76
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,249
Well, I won't take but a minute.

77
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,458
I was so happy in this house.
I lived here for 50 years.

78
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,041
Raised all my children here.
Is that okay?

79
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,166
- Yeah, I... yeah, okay.
- Oh, oh, thank you.

80
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:58,750
But it can't be too long,
though, okay?

81
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:01,667
It won't be, I promise you.
I'll be very discreet.

82
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:04,041
What have you done here?

83
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:08,291
You've covered up that cut
stone from Italy with a rug!

84
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:10,708
Yeah, well, it needed
a little warming up in here.

85
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,750
It was very cold and
I happen to like it.

86
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:16,124
And you know what?
It happens to be my house, so...

87
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,500
And what have you done in here?

88
00:03:18,501 --> 00:03:20,667
Where's the wonderful
wallpaper I put up?

89
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,583
The wallpaper with the pirates?
Are you kidding?

90
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:25,249
It was the first thing
I took down when I moved in.

91
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,541
Well, I guess it's your house.

92
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,375
You can do anything you want to.

93
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:30,208
- Yeah, oh, yes!
- I think I'll check over here.

94
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:33,375
That's true! That...
I can do anything I want to!

95
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:34,875
What are you doing...
what the fuck?

96
00:03:34,876 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm checking the master bedroom.

97
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:38,958
I don't want you to.
It's my house.

98
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,249
Well, all right.
If you wanna be that way.

99
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,249
Yeah, I think I do
wanna be that way.

100
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,917
I do. All right,
you know what?

101
00:03:44,918 --> 00:03:47,083
I think it's time to go.
Let's go. Come on.

102
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,667
- All right.
- Come on.

103
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,375
- I guess I better go.
- Enough. I've had enough.

104
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,333
- Oh!
- Ay-ay-ay.

105
00:03:52,334 --> 00:03:56,083
Look at this poor ficus!
What have you done?

106
00:03:56,084 --> 00:03:59,792
I left this with you in good
faith to love and cherish.

107
00:03:59,793 --> 00:04:01,792
Yeah, no, I've taken
very good care of it.

108
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:04,041
- It's old.
- It's dropping all its leaves. Do you water it?

109
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:06,625
Of course I water it. All right,
come on, I got some people here.

110
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:08,166
You've got to go.
Come on.

111
00:04:08,167 --> 00:04:10,291
There's the door.
Time to go. Thank you.

112
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,500
Good-bye.
Thank you for stopping by.

113
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,291
- Don't do it again.
- No, I know, I know.

114
00:04:15,292 --> 00:04:17,541
And then, Todd,
this other guy,

115
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,041
had... what's the male
equivalent of bush?

116
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:21,500
- Man bush.
- Man bush.

117
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:24,833
That, like... so, finding
his penis was like...

118
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:27,041
I'm searching for the
baby bird in the...

119
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:29,750
- In the nest.
- In the nest.

120
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:31,500
And then I'm, like, looking.

121
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,333
I couldn't even find the goods

122
00:04:33,334 --> 00:04:35,917
because the Afro was so intense.

123
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:37,375
Yeah, okay, all right.

124
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:39,208
I think... I think we've heard
enough of that story.

125
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:40,541
- Sorry, Lar.
- But, Larry,

126
00:04:40,542 --> 00:04:41,999
she has so many funny
stories about her exes.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,583
I've been hearing
them for years.

128
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,458
- They're hilarious.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

129
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,124
- Yeah.
- Remember the one you told me about?

130
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,124
- The guy who... the leaner?
- Yeah, the leaner.

131
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,041
- Yes.
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa?

132
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,667
- That guy?
- The Leaning Tower of Peter.

133
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,875
Yeah, oh, that's...
that's a good one, too.

134
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:57,124
- That was a good one.
- I know, I know.

135
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,875
And then Todd,
this other guy...

136
00:04:58,876 --> 00:05:00,833
Oh, yeah. Oh, that was
so many years ago.

137
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,708
Oh, my God.
I don't believe it.

138
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:06,458
This room used to be
so warm and inviting.

139
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,541
Mrs. Shapiro, what are...
what are you doing?

140
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:09,792
- Well, I just...
- I thought you left.

141
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,416
Well, I was just
looking around.

142
00:05:11,417 --> 00:05:13,500
- It used to be so different.
- She used to live in the house.

143
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:15,041
Uh, she wanted to look around.

144
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:17,458
And the house was so much
better when I had it.

145
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,041
- I don't know what he's done with this.
- Okay, you need to go now.

146
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,750
- Well, you don't have to be rude about it.
- You're the one being rude.

147
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:24,541
You come in here and
you're criticizing my house.

148
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,291
You don't live here anymore.

149
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:27,833
That's right, keep going.

150
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,458
Yeah, and now close it.

151
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,875
Close it.

152
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:35,249
- Go... go back to the leaner.
- Okay.

153
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,166
The Leaning Tower of Peter?

154
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,375
Oh, and he was a biter, too.

155
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,416
He used to bite me on the ass.

156
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:43,750
- Which was not as bad as...
- A bite on the damn nipple!

157
00:05:43,751 --> 00:05:47,541
Oh, my God, totally.
'Cause that hurts.

158
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,166
Well, that's it, everybody.

159
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,333
- I'm all done for the night.
- Whoo!

160
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:53,583
Thanks. It's been a privilege
working for you tonight.

161
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,083
And I hope you agree with me

162
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:58,249
that this has been
a spectacular "shuck-cess."

163
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,375
- Whoa!
- Oh, nice. Okay.

164
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:02,166
- Thank you.
- I'll... I'll walk you out.

165
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:03,792
- He's adorable.
- Yeah.

166
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:05,999
- Bridge, what was the guy...
- Anyway, um,

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,083
it was great having
you here tonight.

168
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:08,416
Everybody really enjoyed it.

169
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:09,917
I hope so. I hope so.

170
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:11,416
- Had a great time.
- Yeah. Yeah, it was great.

171
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:14,083
Um, I just wanna say one thing.

172
00:06:14,084 --> 00:06:16,541
You know, earlier when I was
talking about "Hamilton,"

173
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:20,999
what... what you didn't hear
me say was that I played,

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,458
uh, 36 holes of golf that
day and I was exhausted.

175
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:29,875
And that's one of the
reasons I was so tired,

176
00:06:29,876 --> 00:06:31,500
uh, during the performance.

177
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:35,625
I mean, I... I loved
what I... what I saw.

178
00:06:35,626 --> 00:06:40,999
Sure. What I heard
was that you fell asleep.

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,208
Yes, I did fall asleep,
but what you didn't hear

180
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,458
is why I fell asleep,
why I was so tired.

181
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:46,958
- I loved the show.
- Sure.

182
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,500
You can paint it
or dress it up

183
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:53,708
anyway you want,
but sleep is sleep.

184
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,124
- And you fell asleep.
- Yeah.

185
00:06:57,125 --> 00:07:00,166
- All right?
- True, I did.

186
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,999
But, uh, I would hope
that as you shuck

187
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,667
from house to house that, uh,

188
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:10,333
you can afford me some shucker
discretion in this matter.

189
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:12,333
- I understand.
- Oh.

190
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,541
- And I appreciate that.
- Good. Thank you.

191
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:18,291
And I would also appreciate, um,

192
00:07:18,292 --> 00:07:20,000
two tickets to "Hamilton."

193
00:07:22,793 --> 00:07:25,917
- Oh. Really?
- Yeah.

194
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:27,124
Well...

195
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,999
I don't have any access

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,208
to getting you tickets
to "Hamilton," okay?

197
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:35,124
- It's most unfortunate.
- And why is... why is that?

198
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:41,041
It'd be a shame
if Lin-Manuel Miranda

199
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:45,668
ever found out that someone was
falling asleep in his show.

200
00:07:47,876 --> 00:07:51,667
- I'll see what I can do.
- Super.

201
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:53,250
- Yeah.
- Okay.

202
00:07:57,542 --> 00:08:00,291
I like that guy.

203
00:08:00,292 --> 00:08:01,999
- Oh, he was adorable.
- He was adorable.

204
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,792
- What? Who?
- This cake is unbelievable.

205
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:06,958
- I know.
- Oh, it's the best cheesecake.

206
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,249
Um, all right.

207
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,041
I think, uh...
I think we're good here.

208
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:12,124
I think that's enough.

209
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,416
- What?
- That's enough.

210
00:08:13,417 --> 00:08:15,375
- What are you talking about?
- Time to go.

211
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:17,583
We're having afterdinner
conversation, Larry.

212
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:19,958
- It's enough.
- You know, this is so typical of you.

213
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,958
I don't like all the
lingering after dinner.

214
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,708
You had your dessert. Get...
get the hell out. Come on, get out.

215
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:28,625
All right, thank you for
ruining a lovely evening.

216
00:08:28,626 --> 00:08:30,999
On the contrary, didn't ruin it.
Saved it.

217
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,416
- Uh-huh. Bridget, call me tomorrow.
- I saved it.

218
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:35,041
- Mwah. Cheryl, Ted.
- Mwah. I'll call you.

219
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:37,083
All right, okay, come on.
Time to go, people.

220
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,458
- Hey.
- This is your Larry.

221
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:40,583
- Whose is this?
- Oh, I don't know.

222
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:42,708
Maybe... maybe the
Shucker left it.

223
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,083
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

224
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:45,625
Man, this is cool.

225
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,249
- Ooh.
- You know what?

226
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,458
- Ooh, Jeffrey.
- Keep it.

227
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:49,667
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

228
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:51,667
Oh, definitely keep it.
I love it.

229
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:53,750
- You do?
- It looks fantastic on you.

230
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,875
- Really?
- Looks good.

231
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:55,917
How about that?

232
00:08:55,918 --> 00:08:58,208
Look at me. I'm the sheriff.

233
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,999
Now let's go home, Sheriff.
Come on.

234
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,249
- Yeah.
- All right, people.

235
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,625
- Okay, yep.
- Let's go.

236
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,833
- Time to go.
- We're getting kicked out.

237
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:08,166
She's showing me
love and affection

238
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,833
that I've never felt before.

239
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:12,166
- 'Cause of the hat.
- All 'cause of the hat.

240
00:09:12,167 --> 00:09:13,625
She listens to what I say.

241
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:15,583
She takes suggestions.

242
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:18,416
And all she wants
to do is have sex.

243
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,583
- Susie?
- Yes.

244
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,416
So I have to keep
the hat on during sex.

245
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:22,917
- That's her thing.
- What?

246
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:25,208
Yeah. I haven't had
this much sex since college.

247
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:27,958
- Wow.
- It's almost like, you know,

248
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,083
she's got a thing for cowboys
from her past or something.

249
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,291
She's got a real perversion,
doesn't she?

250
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,958
Yeah, she loves the Old West.

251
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,625
Where are the women who
have a bald perversion?

252
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:39,458
I wonder if there's, like,
a place they all hang out.

253
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:40,999
You just walk in and, you know.

254
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,667
I wonder if it's
worth investigating.

255
00:09:42,668 --> 00:09:44,083
You wonder?

256
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,917
I would have already
investigated it.

257
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,958
I would have... I would have blown
up Google with... if I were you.

258
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:51,999
- Hey, by the way.
- Yeah?

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,708
Today with...
with Lin...

260
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:56,166
- Yeah.
- Okay?

261
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,875
You don't think he's gonna
wanna write the songs, do you?

262
00:09:58,876 --> 00:10:00,416
Hmm, I hadn't thought of that,

263
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,999
but I... I don't know.

264
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,249
They're my songs.
I don't wanna...

265
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,500
Your songs.
And can I say something?

266
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:05,708
- Yeah.
- I love those songs.

267
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:06,875
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.

268
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:08,500
Excuse me, gentlemen.

269
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:10,625
Lin isn't here yet, but if
you'd like to go upstairs

270
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:11,833
to Aaron's office, you can.

271
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,042
Oh.

272
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,668
Ma'am.

273
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:23,583
How you doing?

274
00:10:29,793 --> 00:10:31,291
- Larry! Hey.
- Hey!

275
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,083
Come on in, come on in.
Jeff, hi.

276
00:10:33,084 --> 00:10:34,375
- How you doing, Aaron?
- Aaron Warden.

277
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:35,500
- Yeah. I know you.
- Nice to meet you.

278
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,208
Hello, hello. Nice hat.

279
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:39,166
- Thank you.
- You're just coming back from Vegas?

280
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,958
Uh, no. This is my new look.

281
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,500
I like it. I like how you think.

282
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:46,583
Lin's very excited, by the way.

283
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:49,208
I read the play personally.
Great.

284
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:50,708
- Laughed a lot.
- Really?

285
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,458
- Great moments, great comedy.
- Wow.

286
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:54,124
We're really excited, seriously.

287
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,458
And you think that he's interested
in... in playing Salman?

288
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:58,500
I think so.
The only issue... he's so busy.

289
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:01,083
So busy right now.
You know, the world is after him.

290
00:11:01,084 --> 00:11:02,416
What's that? "Judge Judy"?

291
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,458
- Oh, you like Judith?
- Oh, I love Judge Judy.

292
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:05,999
- Are you kidding?
- Good. Good, good. She's my client.

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,124
If I ever had to go to court,

294
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,708
I would like for
her to adjudicate.

295
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,375
- That's how good she is.
- But she's tough.

296
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:12,166
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Oh, there he is!

297
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,708
- Our national treasure.
- Hey! Jeff. How are you?

298
00:11:13,709 --> 00:11:17,249
Jeff, Lin. Larry, Lin.
Nice to see you.

299
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,917
- How did it go? Good?
- It was good.

300
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:20,541
- Yeah, I think we're done.
- Good. I'm excited.

301
00:11:20,542 --> 00:11:22,999
All right, I was just telling
them how excited we are.

302
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,458
Thank you so much
for bringing this to us.

303
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:26,124
- It's so exciting.
- Oh, oh, thank...

304
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,833
you know, I loved "Hamilton,"
needless to say.

305
00:11:28,834 --> 00:11:30,958
- I saw it with you.
- Oh, great. Awesome.

306
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,249
You know, I know the show's in
LA right now. Everybody's loving it.

307
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:37,250
I was wondering, would it be possible
to get two tickets for my shucker?

308
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:41,083
For your shucker?
Like an oyster shucker?

309
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:44,416
Yeah, yeah, oyster shucker. Yeah.
Fantastic shucker. So fast.

310
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:48,083
- He's your personal shucker?
- No. He... he shucks for me from time to time.

311
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:50,541
Hey, if he's important to you,
sure, I'll... I'll...

312
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,541
- no promises, but I'll ask.
- Oh, thank you.

313
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:53,958
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Thank you so much.

314
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:55,625
All right, I'll let
you chat together,

315
00:11:55,626 --> 00:11:57,249
and my office is your office.

316
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,041
Have a great time.
I'm excited about this.

317
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:00,792
- Great work again, Larry.
- Thanks again.

318
00:12:00,793 --> 00:12:02,124
Thanks for letting us
use the office.

319
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,625
Appreciate it.
Let's have a seat, guys.

320
00:12:04,626 --> 00:12:07,584
Okay, let's see.
Where do you want...

321
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,208
Right.

322
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,875
So, "Fatwa! the Musical."

323
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:18,208
Where do you guys wanna do it?

324
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:19,958
Well, you know, we're thinking...

325
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:21,208
- Broadway.
- Broadway.

326
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:22,958
Broadway? All right.

327
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,375
I think you're gonna wanna
try it out of town first.

328
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:28,000
You know, why not LA?
I think you should do it here.

329
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,792
- Okay.
- Nice.

330
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,291
And who do you see for a cast?

331
00:12:35,292 --> 00:12:40,208
Obviously, we'd like you
to play, um, Salman.

332
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:42,249
- Oh, "Salmon."
- Salman.

333
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,209
Yeah, "Salmon" Rushdie.

334
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,458
"Salmon," yeah.

335
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,124
And, um, Mandy Patinkin
for, uh...

336
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,333
- No one but Mandy Patinkin.
- ...for the ayatollah.

337
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:52,334
F. Murray Abraham.

338
00:12:54,334 --> 00:12:56,958
- Yeah. Good idea. Let's do that.
- Yeah. I'm telling you.

339
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,166
The "F" is for
fucking awesome.

340
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:00,625
I'm sorry.

341
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:02,458
I'm getting a...
I'm sorry, guys, this is London.

342
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:05,500
Can I just have you guys step outside
for a second? Thanks so much.

343
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:08,166
This is really going well.
Hello?

344
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:09,541
What the hell's wrong with you?

345
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:12,625
- You said yes to everything.
- Yeah.

346
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,751
You were so determined downstairs.
What the hell happened?

347
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:19,875
- It's the desk.
- The desk?

348
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:22,583
Yes. It's the power of the desk.
He's up high, I'm down low.

349
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:25,166
Everything he says, I say yes to.
He's in the boss chair.

350
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,708
- He's... he's like... it's like he's my boss.
- This is not good.

351
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:29,917
We gotta do everything we can to
get him out from behind the desk.

352
00:13:29,918 --> 00:13:33,708
- Okay.
- Hey, you guys can come on back in.

353
00:13:33,709 --> 00:13:35,542
Please, make yourselves
comfortable.

354
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,208
I got an idea.
Why don't you sit over here?

355
00:13:43,209 --> 00:13:45,208
Yeah, no. I'm comfortable.
Thank you so much.

356
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:47,124
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm great.

357
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,792
I gotta tell you, we could have a real
nice, intimate discussion over here.

358
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,750
You know, we'll be able to
kind of really kick it around.

359
00:13:51,751 --> 00:13:53,541
Yeah, I feel like we're
at a nice, wide angle.

360
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,124
This is a nice bird's-eye
view of the piece.

361
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,917
I gotta tell you something,
I'm getting laryngitis

362
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,750
screaming across the room,
you're so far away.

363
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,083
Well, I'm enthusiastic
about it, too.

364
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:01,833
I think we're on the same page.

365
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:05,333
Listen, not only do I wanna play
"Salmon," I wanna write the songs.

366
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:08,792
- Yeah, but I... I've written all the songs.
- Yeah.

367
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:11,792
- That's all done.
- It's a great starting point for us.

368
00:14:11,793 --> 00:14:13,625
You know, what you've written
is... it's a great bedrock.

369
00:14:13,626 --> 00:14:15,541
It's a great foundation
for... for me to...

370
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,083
you know, 'cause it's
inspiring me so much.

371
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:18,416
You know, let's start
with the opening.

372
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:19,667
What? The opening?

373
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:21,500
Come on, the opening's

Where are you going?

386
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,291
No, I was just checking out
the whole area here.

387
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,041
No, have a seat. I'm not done.

388
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,124
Oh, okay... okay.

389
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,208
Yeah. No, have a seat over here.

390
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,500
Yeah, right where you were.

391
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:55,124
Have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

392
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:58,375
We're in a flow right now.
You're doing great.

393
00:14:58,376 --> 00:14:59,958
Listen, I feel like
I have a lot of ideas

394
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,625
and maybe we should
call another meeting

395
00:15:01,626 --> 00:15:03,541
where I can really download
everything that's in my head,

396
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:04,999
'cause I'm just scratching
the surface here.

397
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,875
I love what we've all
come up with together,

398
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:08,124
so let's have
another meeting

399
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,751
in a couple weeks
to keep working.

400
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:13,124
Okay.

401
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,792
Great.

402
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:17,583
I have a couple of calls to make
to the West End before it closes.

403
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,166
Yeah, all right, give me the room.
Thanks.

404
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,375
- This is just the beginning.
- Yeah.

405
00:15:20,376 --> 00:15:21,583
- Awesome.
- See you.

406
00:15:21,584 --> 00:15:22,834
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

407
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,875
Ugh, how can you eat
that thing, Riggs?

408
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:31,999
Hey, it's breakfast, the most
important meal of the day.

409
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,917
What's the name of this show?

410
00:15:33,918 --> 00:15:36,875
- "Chicago Homicide."
- Oh, my God, you poor kid.

411
00:15:36,876 --> 00:15:38,667
It's not that bad.

412
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:40,917
- People love it.
- Two bullet wounds to the chest...

413
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:42,458
- People love this?
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:44,375
People will watch anything
with "Chicago" in the title.

415
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,999
- It's been proven.
- Yeah.

416
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,166
Yeah.

417
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,375
Ow. Could this couch
be any more uncomfortable?

418
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:54,917
- You could have a new couch.
- And that's gonna require people...

419
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:56,500
- Oh, that's annoying.
- ...lugging something

420
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:58,500
up the stairs, lugging this out.

421
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:00,708
I can't stand to see people doing
manual labor in front of me.

422
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:04,375
- Movers in particular.
- Right. Right.

423
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:06,166
- Wow.
- A piano.

424
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,917
- Nightmare. Tears.
- Oh, my God.

425
00:16:07,918 --> 00:16:09,583
I wouldn't get a
piano just because

426
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:12,000
I wouldn't want them to move
the piano into my house.

427
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:17,875
- That's so stupid.
- It is, but it's true.

428
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:21,208
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

429
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:23,833
Interesting,
the things I'm learning.

430
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:25,708
Just like talking to all your
friends the other night.

431
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,250
They were so, uh, nice.
That was fun.

432
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:31,792
- Yeah, it was fun.
- Mmm.

433
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:34,375
Except maybe...

434
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:38,375
at the end when you were
talking about those guys.

435
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:41,625
Susie loves those stories.

436
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,041
- I don't know why.
- Yeah.

437
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,750
I guess I kept thinking...

438
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:50,792
what if... what if that was me
she was talking about?

439
00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,208
Well, I won't talk about you, Larry.
Don't worry.

440
00:16:54,209 --> 00:16:57,375
Is there anything you've
observed thus far or noticed

441
00:16:57,376 --> 00:17:01,583
that you might wanna talk
about at a dinner party?

442
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:05,917
No. Everything's
completely just regular.

443
00:17:05,918 --> 00:17:08,958
They're too much trouble.
I'm officially done dating.

444
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,541
- "Regular."
- If I get lonely, I'll just rent a penis.

445
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:16,583
Ah! That is a...
an unapproved "penis."

446
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:19,458
I'm so sorry,
I gotta call this in before they...

447
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:20,999
It's Bridget for Bill.

448
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,458
No, he knows why I'm calling.

449
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,333
You hear something?

450
00:17:26,334 --> 00:17:28,291
Sorry, I didn't... I...

451
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,416
Yeah.

452
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:32,625
No, tell him
I'm holding for him.

453
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,291
Don't let him get away.

454
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:37,792
- You're so thirsty.
- Oh, my... what?

455
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:40,458
What?! What are you doing here?

456
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:43,625
Well, obviously, I'm keeping
this plant alive.

457
00:17:43,626 --> 00:17:46,083
- It's dying here.
- How did you get in here?

458
00:17:46,084 --> 00:17:49,500
I have my own keys.
You forgot to change the locks.

459
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,750
Okay, I want that key back, okay?
And you need to go.

460
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,124
This is not a college dormitory

461
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,291
where you can visit years later

462
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:56,625
and catch up on things.

463
00:17:56,626 --> 00:17:58,458
We don't have
alumni weekends, okay?

464
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,291
I never should have
sold this house to you.

465
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:03,249
You're destroying it and you're
certainly destroying this plant.

466
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,291
Okay, you listen to me,
Shapiro, all right?

467
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,875
- Get out!
- All right.

468
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,541
It's not your house!
It's my house!

469
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:10,375
I live here, not you!

470
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,583
What a fucking psycho.

471
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:17,583
Fuck me, Tex!

472
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:25,416
You know how she got in?
She used her key.

473
00:18:25,417 --> 00:18:27,625
- You didn't change the locks?
- I never changed the locks.

474
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:28,709
So crazy.

475
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,875
- Speaking of crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

476
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:36,166
- I mean, what the fuck?
- It is the new me. I am all in.

477
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,667
- The boots, too?
- The boots, too.

478
00:18:38,668 --> 00:18:40,208
I'm going for the whole thing.

479
00:18:40,209 --> 00:18:42,291
Women love it. They go nuts.

480
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,750
The only downside is I
gotta keep fucking my wife.

481
00:18:44,751 --> 00:18:46,667
- Sick of it?
- Oh, so sick of it.

482
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:50,416
Yeah. Hey, we gotta talk about
this... this meeting with Lin.

483
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:53,458
- Yeah.
- I gotta sit behind the desk today.

484
00:18:53,459 --> 00:18:55,750
- Oh, yeah.
- Change the whole dynamic.

485
00:18:55,751 --> 00:18:58,249
Well, you just don't wanna piss
him off, that's all I can say.

486
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,416
I'm not gonna piss him off, but,
you know, I need... I need...

487
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:03,792
to wrest creative control
from him somehow.

488
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:06,584
He's taking over the
whole goddamn thing.

489
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:10,833
Did... did you...

490
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,833
- Did you overhear what I...
- Yes, I did.

491
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:18,376
I hope you'll exercise
some receptionist discretion...

492
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:22,750
Just gotta keep it down.

493
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,750
Everybody's got
such a big mouth.

494
00:19:24,751 --> 00:19:25,551
Yeah.

495
00:19:25,552 --> 00:19:27,500
Nobody can hear anything
and keep it to themselves.

496
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:31,375
- Hey!
- Oh, look at you.

497
00:19:31,376 --> 00:19:32,583
- Nice.
- Yeah.

498
00:19:32,584 --> 00:19:33,917
Yeah, you can pull that off.

499
00:19:33,918 --> 00:19:35,625
- You're with this agency?
- Yeah.

500
00:19:35,626 --> 00:19:37,291
Yeah, I don't know
why I bother, though.

501
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,667
Yeah, it's enough
with the acting already.

502
00:19:38,668 --> 00:19:40,750
How long do you have
to do it for?

503
00:19:40,751 --> 00:19:44,083
- Why don't you quit? Huh?
- Nah, I got a few more parts in me, come on.

504
00:19:44,084 --> 00:19:46,416
Every time I turn on the television,
I have to see you.

505
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,416
It's enough. Retire.
Why don't you retire?

506
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,583
- Yeah. Maybe I...
- Huh?

507
00:19:50,584 --> 00:19:52,249
We gonna see you this weekend?

508
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,583
Uh, no, actually,
I... I'm not...

509
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:56,750
Cheryl and I are
going up to Tahoe.

510
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:59,583
- Oh, we... we went there once.
- Yeah, I know.

511
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:02,166
She, uh... she told me.

512
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,583
Something funny
happen in Tahoe?

513
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:15,166
No. Uh-uh.

514
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,750
- Something weird?
- No. Nope.

515
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:20,458
- I think something happened in Tahoe.
- Nothing happened in Tahoe.

516
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:23,792
- What happened in Tahoe?
- Nothing happened in Tahoe, Jeff, okay?

517
00:20:23,793 --> 00:20:25,917
Can you look at me and tell
me nothing happened in Tahoe?

518
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:27,875
- Nothing happened in Tahoe!
- Something happened in Tahoe!

519
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:29,958
- Nothing happened!
- Trust me, something happened.

520
00:20:29,959 --> 00:20:31,792
- Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
- Oh! Hey.

521
00:20:31,793 --> 00:20:33,291
- Great to see you.
- Good to see you.

522
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,291
Oh, great to see this.

523
00:20:34,292 --> 00:20:36,291
This is developing.
I like it.

524
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:38,166
It's working really well.
Keep workshopping. It's great.

525
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,541
- Hey, did you get the tickets for the shucker?
- Oh, I asked.

526
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:41,999
They weren't...
they weren't able to do it.

527
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,792
- I'm sorry.
- They? Who's they?

528
00:20:44,793 --> 00:20:45,917
Yeah, well, you know, I mean,

529
00:20:45,918 --> 00:20:47,875
if it were for you...
no problem.

530
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:49,958
You'd go as my guest.
It's my pleasure.

531
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:54,458
But a shucker you met once
who's good at shucking...

532
00:20:54,459 --> 00:20:56,958
Well, he's not just good at shucking;
he's great at shucking.

533
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,249
Again, for you, no problem.
In a second.

534
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,334
Anytime you wanna go,
please let me know.

535
00:21:04,876 --> 00:21:07,083
Okay. Yeah, okay, I'll go.

536
00:21:07,084 --> 00:21:09,458
I'll... I'll take
the tickets.

537
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:11,500
- You'll take them?
- Yeah.

538
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,833
- For the same day that the shucker was...
- Yeah.

539
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:16,333
- Now they're for you?
- Yeah.

540
00:21:16,334 --> 00:21:17,542
You'll be there at the show?

541
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:20,792
Yeah. Yeah.

542
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:21,999
Are you sure?

543
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,375
Yeah.

544
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:25,124
Are you really sure?

545
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,959
I'm really sure.

546
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,416
- Okay.
- Gentlemen, Aaron just left the office.

547
00:21:44,417 --> 00:21:45,667
You can have it
for your meeting.

548
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:47,918
- Let's go to work.
- Great.

549
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,042
I gotta get that desk.

550
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:56,041
So, um,
how do you like LA?

551
00:21:56,042 --> 00:21:57,833
I like it okay.
Getting used to driving.

552
00:21:57,834 --> 00:22:01,041
- Yeah. Oh, d... you drive?
- Yeah.

553
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,708
You... do you have
a car in New York?

554
00:22:02,709 --> 00:22:04,667
No, not in New York,
but I have one here I've been renting.

555
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:06,083
- It's pretty great.
- Uh-huh.

556
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:07,708
Yeah, I'm getting used
to the traffic.

557
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:09,083
Yeah. How come you don't
have a car in New York?

558
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:10,541
Oh, you don't need one
with the subway.

559
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,792
I know. I wish they'd
get some kind of...

560
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:15,166
You know, I pretty much
take the train...

561
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:26,625
"Fatwa!"

562
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:29,459
"...the Musical."

563
00:22:34,668 --> 00:22:36,249
Yeah, have a seat, guys.

564
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,208
I had a couple of
questions about act two

565
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:40,416
and a couple of ideas that I
think are really gonna help us.

566
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:42,750
You know, there's always a bit of
a drag in the middle of act two

567
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:45,667
and I think we can attack that
in a really innovative way.

568
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:48,875
- Do you have a pad and a pen?
- Yeah, sure.

569
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:51,083
I'll have, uh, Lucy
get that for you.

570
00:22:51,084 --> 00:22:52,833
Lucy?

571
00:22:52,834 --> 00:22:54,416
Come on, Larry.
Spit that shit out.

572
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,833
What happened in Tahoe?

573
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:59,291
Listen, you can ask as many
questions as you want.

574
00:22:59,292 --> 00:23:03,041
You are not going to find out
from me what happened in Tahoe.

575
00:23:03,042 --> 00:23:07,124
If you really wanted to
find out, go ask Ted Danson.

576
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,708
Okay? Let me tell you something.

577
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:10,333
There's just no
discretion anymore.

578
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:12,999
I had to give that fucking shucker
two tickets to "Hamilton."

579
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,625
Who knows if he's gonna
keep his trap shut?

580
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,541
- Yeah.
- Yeah, and by the way,

581
00:23:17,542 --> 00:23:19,750
you were at the table
the other night.

582
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,999
Bridget... you heard that,
what she was going on about.

583
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,249
- That's some good-ass dick stories, man.
- Horrifying.

584
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,999
She could be talking
that way about me.

585
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,625
If you're so goddamn
worried about it,

586
00:23:27,626 --> 00:23:29,583
make her sign an agreement
that she won't fucking talk.

587
00:23:29,584 --> 00:23:31,291
What do you mean,
like a nondisclosure agreement?

588
00:23:31,292 --> 00:23:33,458
Fucking non-disclosure.
Make her sign that shit.

589
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,458
You know, they have it
for housekeepers.

590
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:37,291
You know, then...
so they can't talk about it.

591
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,667
They should have that for sex.

592
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,333
They should have it for sex,
but they don't have it for sex.

593
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:42,249
People don't sign
"fuck documents."

594
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,208
If you nervous
about your johnson...

595
00:23:44,209 --> 00:23:45,709
...make her sign
some shit.

596
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:55,500
- Take it.
- Huh?

597
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,792
I'm done.

598
00:23:57,793 --> 00:24:01,583
- You all right?
- No, I'm not. I'm not all right.

599
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:02,958
- Oh, Jesus.
- Can we sit down?

600
00:24:02,959 --> 00:24:05,334
- Yeah, yeah. Come in here.
- All right.

601
00:24:07,959 --> 00:24:09,750
Susie sprained my dick.

602
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:10,751
What?

603
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,041
Wearing that hat has been
nothing but a curse for me.

604
00:24:14,042 --> 00:24:16,667
She took my dick to places
it wasn't meant to go.

605
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:19,041
So far to the right,
so far to the left.

606
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,625
- Back and forth.
- You need a dick chiropractor.

607
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,541
- Dick chiropractor? There's dick chiropractors?
- Yeah.

608
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:24,999
- Of course there are.
- Really?

609
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,375
You know how many times
I fucked my dick up?

610
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:28,124
- Several times.
- Oh, it's just...

611
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,541
it's the worst thing
I've ever experienced.

612
00:24:30,542 --> 00:24:32,041
I'm taking these.
I'm popping these.

613
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:33,875
This just cuts the pain.

614
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:36,041
- Do you have any extra?
- Yeah, sure.

615
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,375
- Lin-Manuel landed on my shoulder.
- I remember.

616
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,375
- I'm in terrible pain.
- Yeah, I remember.

617
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:41,541
- But be careful.
- Thank you.

618
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:42,792
Those are really strong.

619
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:44,208
Take them only
if you need them.

620
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,375
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

621
00:24:45,376 --> 00:24:46,667
Hey! Great news.

622
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,625
I've been so focused on my dick,

623
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:50,291
I forgot to tell
you the good news.

624
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:53,124
The good news is
I talked to his agent.

625
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,833
Lin-Manuel Miranda is in.

626
00:24:55,834 --> 00:24:58,416
- Oh! Wow, yeah. Hey. Great.
- Yeah! Yeah!

627
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:00,583
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah, all right.

628
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:02,999
- I'm not surprised.
- I told you, I said it was a sure thing.

629
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,249
He's getting everything he wants.
Why shouldn't he be in?

630
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,166
I got Funkhouser invested.
I got Lewis invested.

631
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,583
Of course, I'm still invested.

632
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:12,917
- Oh, yeah!
- Wow.

633
00:25:12,918 --> 00:25:14,416
- Huh? What do you think?
- Oh, yeah!

634
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:16,083
- Wow. Fab.
- You like it?

635
00:25:16,084 --> 00:25:18,249
- I gotta check it out in the mirror.
- Check it out.

636
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,917
He looks like a smart sheriff
who's also a doctor.

637
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:23,291
He'll shoot you, then he'll
stitch your ass up.

638
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:25,084
Oh, my God!

639
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:29,583
She took the plant!

640
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:32,833
- Fuck!
- Mrs. Shapiro took the plant!

641
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:36,708
- That's fucked up.
- Oh, my God, that is insane!

642
00:25:36,709 --> 00:25:38,416
She didn't put her
old-ass foot on the door,

643
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:39,875
but that's still
a home invasion.

644
00:25:39,876 --> 00:25:41,416
Yeah. No, I know what it is,

645
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:43,750
but, I mean, she is...
you know, she's mental.

646
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,041
- She's out of her mind.
- She didn't have to steal.

647
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:48,459
A home invasion's a fucking
home invasion, you know?

648
00:25:51,292 --> 00:25:52,500
That's a home invasion.

649
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:54,458
She came in your house
without permission.

650
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,583
You... you better
get rid of the do-rag.

651
00:25:56,584 --> 00:25:58,917
Black man showing up
at her door with a do-rag?

652
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:01,124
- She'll have a heart attack.
- She'll be fine.

653
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:04,124
It's in the same family as a scarf,
as a ascot, as a pocket square.

654
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,625
- Same fucking family.
- I don't think

655
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:07,500
that's in the scarf, ascot,
pocket square family.

656
00:26:07,501 --> 00:26:09,124
The same goddamn family.
Are you kidding me?

657
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,291
I don't like the optics.

658
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:13,917
She's gonna be fine.
I promise you, man.

659
00:26:13,918 --> 00:26:16,625
Fuck that. Knock on
that shit aggressively.

660
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:18,541
The hell you give a fuck about...
this some bullshit.

661
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,833
Oh! What are you doing here?
Two of you?

662
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:23,416
- Hey! My plant.
- Wait... wait a minute.

663
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:25,249
That's not your plant.

664
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,416
- Yeah.
- That's my plant.

665
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,124
Oh, no, it's not your plant.

666
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:30,416
You came to my house and
you stole my plant. Come on.

667
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,708
I'm saving this plant.

668
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:33,416
I'm letting it live
and flourish.

669
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:35,333
- You were letting it die.
- Oh, come on.

670
00:26:35,334 --> 00:26:36,708
Don't give us that
green thumb shit.

671
00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:37,917
Oh!

672
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:39,625
See, my dog doesn't
like you at all.

673
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:41,667
Bella will bite you
on the ankles.

674
00:26:41,668 --> 00:26:44,124
I'll tell you what. We're gonna
take that dog or this plant.

675
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,208
Oh, no, you're
not taking my dog.

676
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:47,917
- You're not touching my dog.
- What? No, you're not taking the dog.

677
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,375
- Why not?
- You think I want that dog in my house?

678
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:50,833
- I take the dog...
- What?

679
00:26:50,834 --> 00:26:52,375
- What are you, crazy?
- Why not?

680
00:26:52,376 --> 00:26:54,750
- Who's gonna walk it?
- We'll take turns.

681
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,208
I'm not taking turns.

682
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:58,083
I'm not walking the dog.
You gonna pick up its shit?

683
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,875
- I'll take care of it.
- You'll take care of it?

684
00:26:59,876 --> 00:27:01,875
Yeah, that's what 8-year-olds
say when they wanna get a dog.

685
00:27:01,876 --> 00:27:03,833
"I'll take care of it."
And they don't do a goddamn thing.

686
00:27:03,834 --> 00:27:05,541
See, you guys can't
even make up your minds

687
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:07,833
what you're gonna do,
so why don't you just leave?

688
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,166
Wait, who's that?

689
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:11,583
That's Myron,
my dearly departed husband.

690
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:13,583
You know what?
Let's take his hat.

691
00:27:13,584 --> 00:27:15,208
No, you're not taking his hat.

692
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:17,375
No, take the whole goddamn head.
Take the whole fucking head.

693
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,541
- The head? The whole head?
- The whole goddamn head.

694
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:21,741
- You think I want that head in my house?
- I don't want the fucking hat.

695
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:22,932
The hat is dumb as hell.

696
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,333
I'm... big shot, I'd rather
have the hat than the head.

697
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:27,041
I'm not gonna take the head. I don't
want that monstrosity in my house.

698
00:27:27,042 --> 00:27:28,625
He's a lot better
looking than you.

699
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:30,249
- Oh, is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:32,958
- I'm an Uber four, okay?
- Well, Myron was an Uber five.

701
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:35,542
He's not a five.

702
00:27:37,459 --> 00:27:38,833
- Hey.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

703
00:27:38,834 --> 00:27:40,458
Okay, you know what?

704
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,208
You haven't heard the last
of me about this, all right?

705
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:44,124
Don't go into people's homes
and steal their plants.

706
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,209
- I'll see you in court.
- The hell you will!

707
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:52,500
Hello?

708
00:27:52,501 --> 00:27:55,667
- Hi, Larry. It's Lin Miranda.
- Oh, hey.

709
00:27:55,668 --> 00:27:58,124
I'm sure you heard it from...
from Jeff already, but I'm in.

710
00:27:58,125 --> 00:28:00,249
- That's great news.
- I'm clearing my schedule.

711
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,083
It's gonna be you and me
writing this thing toe to tip.

712
00:28:03,084 --> 00:28:04,917
You know what, Lin, I think
we're in pretty good shape.

713
00:28:04,918 --> 00:28:06,917
We don't need to get into
the weeds on this thing.

714
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,083
- The weeds are where the good stuff is.
- Very dangerous in the weeds.

715
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:12,249
You can get Lyme disease in
there if you're not careful.

716
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,708
There's treasure in the weeds
and we'll pick for ticks after.

717
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:17,416
The verses are gonna be satanic.

718
00:28:17,417 --> 00:28:20,416
- Okay.
- Well, the other piece of good news

719
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:21,958
is that my wife, Vanessa,
and her friend

720
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:23,917
are gonna be at "Hamilton"
the same night as you.

721
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:24,918
Oh.

722
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:26,958
So, she'll be sitting right
next to you at the show.

723
00:28:26,959 --> 00:28:28,625
She's going?

724
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:30,375
Yeah, she's using the other
half of my house seats,

725
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,458
so you'll be right next to her.

726
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:36,458
And, I mean, she's gonna see
you 'cause you're going.

727
00:28:36,459 --> 00:28:38,041
Oh, yeah.

728
00:28:38,042 --> 00:28:39,667
Yeah, well, if she's going,

729
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:42,083
she'll see me because I'm going.

730
00:28:42,084 --> 00:28:44,208
Of course. The ticket's for you.

731
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:46,083
Yes, you got the ticket for me

732
00:28:46,084 --> 00:28:48,124
and... and I will use
the ticket you got for me,

733
00:28:48,125 --> 00:28:50,291
and as a result,
I... I will be there.

734
00:28:50,292 --> 00:28:51,958
I'm really excited
for you guys to meet.

735
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:54,124
"Fatwa!"
See you in the weeds, buddy.

736
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,084
Ah, Shucker.

737
00:29:09,959 --> 00:29:11,667
No, I'll be right there.
I'll be right there.

738
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,875
Oh, hi.

739
00:29:13,876 --> 00:29:16,083
What's going on here?

740
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:18,291
Oh, it's just
a little party.

741
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:20,833
- How come I wasn't invited?
- To the party?

742
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:22,833
Yeah, why wasn't I invited?

743
00:29:22,834 --> 00:29:24,333
You just had dinner at my house.

744
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:26,625
I know. That was so nice
and we had a great time.

745
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:28,792
Okay, so how come
you're not inviting me?

746
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:30,999
Where's the reciprocity?

747
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,583
Well, I'm gonna reciprocate,
but not this one.

748
00:29:33,584 --> 00:29:36,833
You're gonna reciprocate?
This was the opportunity to reciprocate.

749
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:39,166
Come to the party! I want you to
come in and really warm it up.

750
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:41,208
I don't wanna go...
I don't wanna go to the party.

751
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:43,750
- Now you have to go.
- I wouldn't have come even if I was invited.

752
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:47,166
- Then what are you doing here?
- What did you tell Ted about Tahoe?

753
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:48,467
Tahoe?

754
00:29:48,468 --> 00:29:51,833
Because, um, he told me that
you two were going to Tahoe.

755
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:54,541
- We are going to Tahoe.
- And I said we had been there.

756
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,142
Right.

757
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:58,208
And he said, "Yeah, I know,"
and he snickered, okay?

758
00:29:58,209 --> 00:30:01,375
Leading me to believe that
you discussed it with him.

759
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,124
No offense to you,

760
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:05,583
but Ted and I don't
need to sit around

761
00:30:05,584 --> 00:30:07,999
talking about what you
and I did in hotel rooms.

762
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,041
I just don't understand why
you're talking Tahoe to Ted.

763
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:12,625
- I wasn't talking Tahoe to Ted.
- No, you did talk Tahoe to Ted.

764
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:14,541
Otherwise there'd be no
reason for Ted to talk Tahoe.

765
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:17,333
- What did he say?
- He... he said you two were going.

766
00:30:17,334 --> 00:30:20,208
So what?
That is not talking Tahoe.

767
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:22,875
That is mentioning a trip
that's about to happen.

768
00:30:22,876 --> 00:30:24,792
- Is he here?
- No, he's shooting.

769
00:30:24,793 --> 00:30:26,958
More shooting? Another job?

770
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:29,333
When's it gonna end?

771
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:32,708
Who's that?
Is that the Shucker?

772
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:34,958
Oh, yeah. That's the Shucker
from your party.

773
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:36,709
Ah, I gotta talk to him.

774
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:44,708
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey. Yeah.

775
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,917
I just wanna thank you
for those "Hamilton" tickets.

776
00:30:46,918 --> 00:30:49,500
I cannot wait.
Over the moon.

777
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:52,917
Um, guess what.
I got your hat.

778
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:55,750
Oh, thank God, because I've
been sick without my hat.

779
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,625
- Where is it?
- Yeah, it's... it's in my car.

780
00:30:57,626 --> 00:30:59,833
So, um, if you can get
a little break,

781
00:30:59,834 --> 00:31:01,549
we can go take a walk,
and I'll give it to you.

782
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,750
Sure, that'd be great.

783
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:06,333
And, uh, I got another little
thing I wanna talk to you about.

784
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:09,083
Ted is shooting a limited
series in Vancouver.

785
00:31:09,084 --> 00:31:11,416
I'm borrowing your Shucker
for two minutes.

786
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,416
Ma'am.

787
00:31:13,417 --> 00:31:14,833
There it is.

788
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:19,124
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, fuck.

789
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:21,375
Come to Papa.

790
00:31:21,376 --> 00:31:24,917
Oh, I have missed you.

791
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:26,625
Well, got my hat.

792
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:28,458
Thanks again for those tickets.

793
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:30,833
Yeah, that's kind of what
I wanna talk to you about.

794
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,583
Um, Lin called me up,

795
00:31:32,584 --> 00:31:35,833
told me his wife was gonna
be sitting next to me.

796
00:31:35,834 --> 00:31:39,708
He thinks the tickets are for me,
and so I have to go now.

797
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:43,500
So, I need... sorry to say,
I need the tickets back.

798
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,750
Well, what do you mean? That's... that's
like a... that's like a bad horse trade.

799
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:50,333
- What are you talking about?
- How are you gonna show up and sit there?

800
00:31:50,334 --> 00:31:51,958
Because if she sees you there,

801
00:31:51,959 --> 00:31:53,918
I am gonna be in a lot of trouble.

802
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:57,625
- All right.
- Come on.

803
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,667
- All right, I'll get you your tickets.
- Yeah?

804
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,333
For $2,500.

805
00:32:03,334 --> 00:32:04,709
Take it or leave it.

806
00:32:07,084 --> 00:32:09,333
You're quite a prick, aren't you?

807
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:10,834
It's the Shucker's way.

808
00:32:12,834 --> 00:32:14,792
I don't have that
kind of cash on me.

809
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:18,667
It's okay,
e take credit cards.

810
00:32:18,668 --> 00:32:20,292
Yeah.

811
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:25,667
Thank you.

812
00:32:25,668 --> 00:32:27,166
Jarvis isn't living up

813
00:32:27,167 --> 00:32:28,208
to his potential.

814
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:29,667
What's on?

815
00:32:29,668 --> 00:32:31,166
"Chicago Teachers."

816
00:32:31,167 --> 00:32:32,333
- No!
- Yeah!

817
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:34,458
Oh, my God.

818
00:32:34,459 --> 00:32:35,159
Oh, yeah.

819
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,999
It's worse than the other
thing we were watching.

820
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,208
They don't try
to curse that much

821
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,375
on that one, though,
so it's okay.

822
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,750
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

823
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,709
- Oh, that's good.
- What do you wanna do?

824
00:32:45,042 --> 00:32:46,416
- What do I wanna do?
- Mm-hmm.

825
00:32:46,417 --> 00:32:48,500
- You mean right now?
- Mm-hmm.

826
00:32:48,501 --> 00:32:50,333
Oh.

827
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:54,041
I mean, if we could do
anything right now,

828
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:55,541
what would it be?

829
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:57,208
Sexually.

830
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,000
- Well...
- Mm-hmm?

831
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:05,833
- Uh...
- What?

832
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:07,416
- You know.
- Tell me.

833
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:11,291
I just like to get an erection,
put it in a vagina.

834
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:12,583
- That's a...
- That's it?

835
00:33:12,584 --> 00:33:13,792
That's about it, yeah.

836
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:16,083
That's your biggest fantasy?

837
00:33:16,084 --> 00:33:18,375
I would just get on the top

838
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:22,208
and thrust until orgasm.

839
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:25,541
- Hmm.
- I'm sexually a very simple man.

840
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,291
Oh.

841
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:29,750
Hmm.

842
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:34,749
But there is something
that can change that.

843
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,750
Oh.

844
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:37,750
- I got something. I got something...
- There we go.

845
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:40,292
- Ooh! Oh!
- ...that's pretty interesting.

846
00:33:43,918 --> 00:33:47,833
There you go.

847
00:33:47,834 --> 00:33:53,917
This is a relationship
nondisclosure agreement?

848
00:33:53,918 --> 00:33:56,083
- Yeah.
- Is this a joke?

849
00:33:56,084 --> 00:33:57,500
No, no.

850
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:01,249
You... this is a
nondisclosure agreement

851
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:04,375
that you want me to sign?

852
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,291
Yeah, we both...
we both have to sign it.

853
00:34:06,292 --> 00:34:09,750
This is terrible!
This is... what's wrong with you?

854
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:12,999
It's... it's just a discretion
thing. You know, it's a...

855
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,458
"Partners prohibited from disclosing
the quality of the sexual experience

856
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:17,583
or the degree of
satisfaction attained"?

857
00:34:17,584 --> 00:34:20,333
- It's fairly boilerplate.
- There is no boilerplate, Larry.

858
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:21,917
This has never
existed before.

859
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,124
- This is insane.
- I know, it's brilliant.

860
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:27,124
- It's not brilliant.
- It locks in discretion, it's...

861
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,708
"Partners shall not
divulge any details

862
00:34:28,709 --> 00:34:31,041
including the use of toys,
lotions, ointments..."

863
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:32,875
What are you talking about?

864
00:34:32,876 --> 00:34:34,958
- Fantastic idea.
- Larry, you are out of your mind.

865
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,291
- No, uh...
- This is horrible.

866
00:34:36,292 --> 00:34:38,041
It'll be great
for our sex life.

867
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,917
- We can... we can go wild.
- No, it won't.

868
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:42,458
This is a great idea. I...
I wish I thought of it years ago!

869
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:44,917
I wish my ex-wife had signed one,
I can tell you that!

870
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:46,999
'Cause I know she's talking,
she's blabbing.

871
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,792
She's telling
Ted Danson everything.

872
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:50,249
What happened in Tahoe...

873
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,166
she's told him what
happened in Tahoe!

874
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:53,875
You're presenting me
with a legal document.

875
00:34:53,876 --> 00:34:56,958
It's the least sexy thing
anyone has ever done, ever!

876
00:34:56,959 --> 00:34:58,458
- It's like a prenup!
- Bye.

877
00:34:58,459 --> 00:34:59,792
You're not thinking
this through!

878
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:03,875
This is a good... good idea!
Bridget! Bridget!

879
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:06,958
Bridget, if we had this,
it'll take the boredom away!

880
00:35:06,959 --> 00:35:10,083
Sign this and you'll have the
wildest sex you ever imagined!

881
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:11,333
- No.
- Just sign it!

882
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:13,667
- No.
- Orgasms galore!

883
00:35:13,668 --> 00:35:15,583
That's what
I'm promising you, baby!

884
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,333
Orgasms galore!
You won't regret it!

885
00:35:18,334 --> 00:35:20,792
I'm not signing your dumb
piece of paper, Larry.

886
00:35:20,793 --> 00:35:22,541
Should've known
this was not gonna work out.

887
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:23,999
Eddie never liked you!

888
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,667
Oh, the... the kid
you pretended has Asperger's?

889
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:29,667
It is not pretend.
He has Asperger's.

890
00:35:29,668 --> 00:35:31,167
What's your excuse?

891
00:35:37,376 --> 00:35:40,834
You're missing out
on Tahoe Larry!

892
00:35:45,292 --> 00:35:46,958
You are about to enter

893
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:50,583
the courtroom
of Judge Judith Sheindlin.

894
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:53,708
This is "Judge Judy."

895
00:35:53,709 --> 00:35:56,541
Larry David
is suing Rose Shapiro

896
00:35:56,542 --> 00:36:01,208
for trespassing at his home
and stealing his ficus plant.

897
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:04,041
Larry David says
that Mrs. Shapiro

898
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:06,958
has made him feel unsafe
in his own home.

899
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:09,375
The defendant is
countersuing Mr. David

900
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:14,083
for sole custody of the plant
on grounds of plant abuse.

901
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:15,750
All rise.

902
00:36:15,751 --> 00:36:18,083
Oh, my God.

903
00:36:18,084 --> 00:36:21,416
Your Honor, it's case number 249 on the
calendar in the matter of David vs. Shapiro.

904
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:22,917
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, Judge.

905
00:36:22,918 --> 00:36:24,750
Parties have been sworn in.
You may be seated.

906
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:28,833
Oh, my fucking God!

907
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:31,041
- When was that?
- Five years ago.

908
00:36:31,042 --> 00:36:33,291
Subsequently,
several weeks ago,

909
00:36:33,292 --> 00:36:35,750
you, without invitation,

910
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:37,792
- came into the house.
- Oh...

911
00:36:37,793 --> 00:36:39,500
That's him!

912
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:41,083
That's the guy. That's the guy
I was telling you about.

913
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:43,625
This is the guy you had
all those sex stories about?

914
00:36:43,626 --> 00:36:46,375
Yes, that's Larry Long Balls.

915
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:47,875
Finally, I shoo her away.

916
00:36:47,876 --> 00:36:49,833
She comes back
another time, uninvited,

917
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,792
uses her key,
steals the plant.

918
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:55,500
Miss Shapiro, I see that
you have some evidence here.

919
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:58,124
This is the way
the plant looked

920
00:36:58,125 --> 00:37:00,375
when I found it in his house.

921
00:37:00,376 --> 00:37:02,708
- I wanna object. Objection.
- Yeah.

922
00:37:02,709 --> 00:37:04,625
- Total objection to that plant.
- Just a second.

923
00:37:04,626 --> 00:37:06,166
Who are you?

924
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:08,792
This is Leon Black.
He's... he's my witness.

925
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,792
Does he have any
relevant information

926
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:13,500
that would help...
that would help your case?

927
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:16,166
I do. This plant is like a person.

928
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:20,249
Certain parts of the year,
that plant turns darker, like myself.

929
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:23,541
When I go to Florida,
I turn a little darker, a shade darker.

930
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:25,792
Most of the time I carry myself
in a mocha tone,

931
00:37:25,793 --> 00:37:28,958
but there are some... some parts of
the year when I'm more mahogany.

932
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:31,999
Let's get finished with the
various tones of Mr. Black

933
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,583
and let's move on
to something else.

934
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,541
Your Honor,
is it possible I could pace

935
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:37,416
while you're asking me
the questions?

936
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:41,166
Would you put him
in his seat?

937
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:43,750
- Mrs. Shapiro.
- Yes?

938
00:37:43,751 --> 00:37:46,041
You have another exhibit
underneath that

939
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:47,917
to show me what the plant
looks like now?

940
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:50,999
- Yes, I do.
- Anybody want a cough drop?

941
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,999
You want one, Judge?
Judge Sheindlin?

942
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,416
You want a cough drop?

943
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:56,249
It's so hard to be fair.

944
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,083
Byrd, give her
a cough drop.

945
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:00,083
So, this is the guy
you're working with?

946
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,833
- Go... shh! Uh!
- Yeah.

947
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,833
You went back to
Mr. David's home...

948
00:38:03,834 --> 00:38:05,999
...and you stole the plant.

949
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,416
I would say rather
than stole, rescued.

950
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,667
Judge, yoo-hoo!
Is this filtered?

951
00:38:10,668 --> 00:38:12,792
I don't know.
What is he asking me?

952
00:38:12,793 --> 00:38:14,708
- If it's filtered, Judge.
- It's...

953
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,291
- Is it filtered?
- Yes, it's filtered.

954
00:38:16,292 --> 00:38:18,917
I'm sorry.
That is not filtered water.

955
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:21,375
Don't drink it.
Don't drink it. Put it down.

956
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,917
What are you putting unfiltered water...
tap water on the table for?

957
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:26,208
That's it. That's it.
I'm done.

958
00:38:26,209 --> 00:38:28,708
Mr. David, while I understand

959
00:38:28,709 --> 00:38:30,917
that Mrs. Shapiro
did the wrong thing,

960
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:33,166
I can only say to you, sir,

961
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:35,375
that anyone who would
neglect a plant

962
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:37,999
in that fashion doesn't
deserve to have it.

963
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,041
Your case is dismissed.

964
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:41,583
We're done. There you go.

965
00:38:41,584 --> 00:38:43,333
- This is... what?
- Good-bye.

966
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:44,999
Parties are excused.
You may step out.

967
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,917
This is crazy!
I'm... I'm shocked, shocked!

968
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:50,667
Are we no better than the...
the beasts in the field?

969
00:38:50,668 --> 00:38:54,041
And by beasts, I'm not talking
about the... the chicken.

970
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,208
I'm talking about the oxen
and the... the donkey...

971
00:38:57,209 --> 00:39:00,333
- Oh, un-fucking-believable.
- ...with its slack-jawed stare and...

972
00:39:00,334 --> 00:39:01,999
- What's going on?
- Oh, nothing.

973
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,708
Come on into bed, cowboy.

974
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:08,084
Yes, ma'am.

975
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:28,793
Forget it, forget it.

976
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,999
- Hi.
- Hey.

977
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,208
- Hello.
- Vanessa.

978
00:39:34,209 --> 00:39:35,917
- Hi, Vanessa.
- So nice to meet you.

979
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:38,291
- Nice to meet you. I'm Larry David.
- Hi, Larry, yeah.

980
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:41,333
Hi. I'm bald, I wear glasses,
and... and this is my ticket.

981
00:39:41,334 --> 00:39:43,625
Here to see the show.
I'm very excited.

982
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:45,416
I'm right here.
I'm sitting right next to you.

983
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:46,833
- How about that?
- Yeah.

984
00:39:46,834 --> 00:39:49,124
This is my friend,
Joanna, from college.

985
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,291
- Hi.
- Hello, hi.

986
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:51,875
- Larry.
- Nice to meet you.

987
00:39:51,876 --> 00:39:53,375
I'm not a shucker.

988
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,583
I enjoy clams. I do.

989
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:57,625
I like oysters,
but I don't shuck.

990
00:39:57,626 --> 00:40:00,041
I know a shucker,
but that doesn't mean

991
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:01,625
that the shucker's
gonna be here.

992
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:02,999
I'm here, not the shucker.

993
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,041
Do you like clams
and oysters?

994
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:06,625
- They're okay.
- Yeah, okay.

995
00:40:06,626 --> 00:40:08,917
Well, but if you eat them,
somebody's gotta shuck them.

996
00:40:08,918 --> 00:40:11,625
Lin is so excited
about "Fatwa!"

997
00:40:11,626 --> 00:40:14,583
- Oh, "Fatwa!" Come on!
- Yeah.

998
00:40:14,584 --> 00:40:16,458
This is gonna be
a big thing, though.

999
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:17,625
He's so excited.

1000
00:40:17,626 --> 00:40:19,291
He can't wait to
just get in there

1001
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,999
and start rewriting.

1002
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,958
He shouldn't be
getting into there,

1003
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,416
he should be getting into you,

1004
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:25,750
and I don't mean that
in a sexual way.

1005
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:27,375
I mean it in terms of time.

1006
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:28,999
Don't... don't get
into the weeds of the show.

1007
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,083
Get into your weeds,
again not sexual,

1008
00:40:31,084 --> 00:40:33,667
but delve into you, you know.

1009
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:35,416
And again, delve into you...

1010
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:38,333
nonsexual delving
is what I'm saying.

1011
00:40:38,334 --> 00:40:40,500
A nonsexual delve.

1012
00:40:40,501 --> 00:40:42,625
Ay, gosh.

1013
00:40:42,626 --> 00:40:44,500
Shoulder. Killing me.

1014
00:40:44,501 --> 00:40:46,375
How'd you hurt your shoulder?

1015
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:49,667
Wrestling with Lin
in his agent's office.

1016
00:40:49,668 --> 00:40:52,833
- He threw me to the ground.
- Seriously?

1017
00:40:52,834 --> 00:40:54,500
Yeah, yeah.

1018
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:02,208
I've got pain pills.
My friend gave me pain pills.

1019
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,500
- Fantastic!
- You want some water?

1020
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:08,000
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

1021
00:41:15,709 --> 00:41:17,208
