1
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:19,391
Good morning.

2
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,624
No.

3
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:25,135
Larry, no.

4
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:30,302
- No, what? What are you talking about?
<i>- Didn't you just wear that jacket yesterday?</i>

5
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:32,470
<i>Yeah, I'm wearing the exact same outfit.</i>

6
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:34,673
<i>I didn't feel like going through...</i>

7
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:38,047
that whole decision process
of picking out an outfit.

8
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:39,585
<i>It's awful.</i>

9
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:42,315
You know what?
<i>I think it's time to get rid of it.</i>

10
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:44,789
<i>What're you talking about?</i>
<i>What's the matter with it?</i>

11
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:49,056
<i>Everything. Look at it, it's maroon.</i>

12
00:00:49,162 --> 00:00:50,754
- Maroon, yeah.
<i>- It's got...</i>

13
00:00:51,498 --> 00:00:54,990
<i>- You think that's a good look?</i>
<i>- I think it's a good color for me, yeah.</i>

14
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:56,626
<i>- It's not.</i>
- What?

15
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:58,227
<i>Why don't you just take it off...</i>

16
00:00:58,305 --> 00:01:01,468
<i>because I'm getting some clothes together</i>
for that homeless guy...

17
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,940
that hangs out by the gas station?

18
00:01:03,009 --> 00:01:06,604
<i>I've had this jacket</i>
<i>since I started doing, since Seinfeld.</i>

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,547
- Yeah, I believe you.
- This is my show night jacket.

20
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:12,346
- I wore this on show night.
- Okay, great.

21
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:14,216
<i>But you know, it's really time...</i>

22
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:17,654
to update your wardrobe a little,
<i>don't you think?</i>

23
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:19,157
What? Get the hell out of here!

24
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,454
- Listen.
<i>- What are you...</i>

25
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:22,825
This will be quick and painless.
There you go.

26
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:49,283
Richard Lewis is in your office.

27
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,756
<i>So, I'm not gonna be around this weekend...</i>

28
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:56,421
in case you wanna get in touch
with me for some reason.

29
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:58,259
- Where you going?
<i>- I'm going to Monterey.</i>

30
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:02,199
<i>- That's nice.</i>
<i>- Yeah, Cheryl's sister is getting married.</i>

31
00:02:02,602 --> 00:02:06,265
<i>- Becky's getting married? Really?</i>
- Yeah, to a Jew. Marrying a Jew.

32
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,967
Really? So am I.
They make the best husbands.

33
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,634
<i>And he's converting.</i>

34
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:13,712
<i>He's getting baptized</i>
and the whole thing, whatever.

35
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,077
- Really?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:17,775
But, you know what?

37
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,479
<i>I'll leave you the number</i>
<i>where I'm gonna be staying...</i>

38
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:23,853
- just in case anything comes up.
- Okay.

39
00:02:25,826 --> 00:02:28,989
I came up here for the tape,
<i>and thank you, but I...</i>

40
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:33,460
<i>God, I hate doing this, 'cause, you know,</i>
you always take it the wrong way.

41
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:36,331
You take everything the wrong way,
<i>ever since I've known you.</i>

42
00:02:36,403 --> 00:02:40,032
Seven years ago,
I was in Paris, and I remember it exactly-

43
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:41,596
Forget Paris!

44
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:45,042
All right, you stole my outgoing message
on my answering machine.

45
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,807
What, are you crazy? What, are you nuts?

46
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:49,348
<i>I know you're ethical, I'm ethical.</i>

47
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,010
You know, when people steal jokes,
we fucking hate that.

48
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:54,747
But I hate when people
fucking steal my outgoing messages.

49
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:57,016
<i>You don't even know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

50
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,991
You have my same
answering machine outgoing message...

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,118
and it bugs me!

52
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:03,128
<i>- That's my message!</i>
- I wrote it in Paris!

53
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:06,427
You wrote it in Paris?
I had that message seven years ago!

54
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,058
- Bullshit!
<i>- Seven years...</i>

55
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:10,102
I wrote it seven and a half years ago!

56
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,297
Whose word are you gonna trust, okay?

57
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:15,773
<i>An ex-alcoholic's,</i>
or a person who was lucid 24 hours a day...

58
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,002
his whole life?

59
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:18,874
- Do me a favor?
- What?

60
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:20,537
- Please change it.
- What?

61
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:22,172
<i>'Cause it's really bothering me.</i>

62
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,410
I want you to change that
<i>'cause people call me...</i>

63
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:27,453
and they call you, and they go,<i>
"Larry David has the same thing."</i>

64
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:29,819
<i>So I say, "It's not Larry David's, it's mine."</i>

65
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,484
<i>I don't have a wife,</i>
<i>I don't have, you know...</i>

66
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,084
My parents are dead. You have a family.

67
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:37,490
<i>Come on, change it. Can you... Come on.</i>

68
00:03:37,697 --> 00:03:40,564
<i>He doesn't have a wife,</i>
and his parents are dead.

69
00:03:40,634 --> 00:03:43,262
<i>That's right. I hold onto these things, man.</i>

70
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:45,702
<i>Doesn't have a wife,</i>
and his parents are dead.

71
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,030
Do me a favor and change it for me.

72
00:03:48,108 --> 00:03:50,770
<i>Yeah, I'll change it,</i>
<i>because you don't have a wife...</i>

73
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:52,641
and your parents, you lost your parents.

74
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,475
<i>I'm laughing, 'cause you're funny.</i>

75
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:57,039
<i>And they would've been 95,</i>
<i>but they're dead.</i>

76
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,677
<i>- I'm laughing but if you don't change it-</i>
<i>- It's a shame.</i>

77
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:00,777
Are you done?

78
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:03,914
<i>Yeah, I'm done.</i>
<i>I didn't steal your message, asshole.</i>

79
00:04:04,257 --> 00:04:05,281
<i>I didn't take it.</i>

80
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:08,885
You took it from me, but you know what?
<i>I'll be the man.</i>

81
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,429
Whatever.

82
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:20,003
Ridiculous.

83
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:26,706
<i>Hi, we're not in. Please leave a message</i>
at the tone. Thank you.

84
00:04:28,281 --> 00:04:29,441
Fantastic.

85
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:34,185
<i>- What's wrong with that?</i>
<i>- What's wrong? It's because it's not fair.</i>

86
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:38,315
<i>- At least it's an admission of guilt.</i>
<i>- It's not an admission of guilt.</i>

87
00:04:38,391 --> 00:04:41,758
<i>How's that an admission of guilt?</i>
I was the man.

88
00:04:41,828 --> 00:04:45,161
<i>I'm a big man. I'm a big, expansive man.</i>

89
00:04:45,332 --> 00:04:48,301
<i>You're a small, petty man.</i>

90
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:50,095
<i>Don't change that.</i>

91
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:56,501
I remember when you made that message.
I thought it was very funny.

92
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,703
You know, so then to show
that I was the man...

93
00:04:58,778 --> 00:05:01,747
I changed the message
right in front of him in the office.

94
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:03,974
- From the office?
- Yeah.

95
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:06,817
<i>I didn't know</i>
you could change your outgoing message.

96
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:09,047
- Yeah, it was easy.
- I thought you had to be here.

97
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:11,682
What do I got to take?
Do I need a traveling outfit?

98
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:16,127
Yes, you need a traveling outfit,
you need something for the baptism.

99
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:19,563
<i>- So, we're probably-</i>
- What is a baptism anyway?

100
00:05:20,033 --> 00:05:22,263
<i>- You don't know what a baptism is?</i>
- I have no idea.

101
00:05:22,335 --> 00:05:25,532
- Something to do with water?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:26,506 --> 00:05:28,701
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>you don't know what a baptism is.</i>

103
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:32,438
<i>- I don't know what it is.</i>
<i>- You'll find out tomorrow, firsthand.</i>

104
00:05:32,512 --> 00:05:34,104
<i>You're gonna witness the whole thing.</i>

105
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,910
What does the average gentile
wear to a baptism?

106
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,685
<i>- Something...</i>
- Blue blazer and a red tie and a white shirt?

107
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:44,246
- Yeah, do you have that?
<i>- My St. Anthony's...</i>

108
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,890
Khakis and a blue blazer
would be wonderful.

109
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,191
- And then something for the wedding?
- Then something for the wedding.

110
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:51,924
- Then the next day?
- Yes.

111
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:53,727
Boy, this is rough.

112
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:56,093
<i>This guy's converting.</i>

113
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,694
Why is he doing that?

114
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,262
You guys come to our side,
<i>we don't go to your side.</i>

115
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,003
<i>Yeah. Jews don't convert.</i>
<i>I'm really surprised.</i>

116
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:07,274
<i>You know what? If he didn't convert,</i>
<i>she wouldn't marry him.</i>

117
00:06:07,347 --> 00:06:09,679
<i>I know that about Becky. She's very...</i>

118
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,377
<i>She's very passionate about her religion.</i>

119
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,682
Why do Christians take
everything so personally...

120
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:16,517
with Christ, you know?

121
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:19,149
<i>It's like, not only</i>
do you have to worship him...

122
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,590
you want everybody to.

123
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,596
<i>It's like, I like lobster.</i>
Do I go around pushing lobster on people?

124
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:26,962
Do I say,
<i>"You must like lobsters, eat lobster.</i>

125
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:30,230
<i>"It's good, it's good"?</i>
<i>You know, it's not only where you live.</i>

126
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:33,033
You go to Africa,
you travel all over the world.

127
00:06:33,106 --> 00:06:36,098
<i>"Eat lobster, have some more lobster,</i>
<i>it's good."</i>

128
00:06:36,176 --> 00:06:39,373
<i>- I don't really think it's-</i>
<i>- "We want you to have lobster!"</i>

129
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:43,348
Lobster and religion,
<i>I really don't see the similarities.</i>

130
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:46,351
What time is the car
picking us up in the morning?

131
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,182
<i>I'm gonna drive.</i>

132
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,788
<i>- Let's just take-</i>
<i>- No, I don't wanna take that car service.</i>

133
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:53,655
They never show up,
<i>they're not dependable.</i>

134
00:06:53,727 --> 00:06:57,026
Then we have to find a parking space
when we get to the airport.

135
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:59,258
<i>We'll leave early, that's okay.</i>

136
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:03,365
- Look at all this.
<i>- That's too much stuff.</i>

137
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:09,539
<i>Come on, honey, let's get going!</i>

138
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:13,379
<i>I can't find the tickets.</i>

139
00:07:17,917 --> 00:07:20,044
When was the last time you had them?

140
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,020
My office.

141
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,887
I left them in the office.

142
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:30,555
Shit.

143
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,166
<i>That's okay, we got time.</i>

144
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:39,797
<i>It's all right, we have time.</i>
We got up early enough.

145
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,203
<i>They're not there.</i>

146
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,231
And I know where they are.

147
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:17,936
Yesterday, when I pressed
the security code to get into my office...

148
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:21,845
there was this creepy guy
and he was watching me...

149
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,712
and he saw me press every number.

150
00:08:23,783 --> 00:08:27,219
<i>I'll bet you he got into that office.</i>
I knew it. He was standing there...

151
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,050
and I knew something was gonna happen.

152
00:08:29,122 --> 00:08:32,319
Somebody came into your office
and stole airline tickets to Monterey?

153
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:34,724
<i>I knew I should've said</i>
something to the supervisor.

154
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:36,762
Why would somebody
steal tickets to Monterey?

155
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,492
<i>Why not? Monterey's a beautiful place.</i>

156
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:42,399
Was anything else stolen?
Was anything else gone?

157
00:08:42,468 --> 00:08:44,197
<i>I don't know, I wasn't paying attention.</i>

158
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,205
All our information is on there,
our address, our phone number.

159
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,037
<i>He's not gonna break into our house,</i>
<i>he's going to Monterey.</i>

160
00:08:50,109 --> 00:08:51,406
This is ridiculous.

161
00:08:51,477 --> 00:08:53,775
<i>I'll call the airline</i>
and tell them what happened.

162
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:56,179
<i>He can't get on the plane</i>
with our tickets, can he?

163
00:08:56,249 --> 00:08:57,443
<i>Why can't he? It's a ticket.</i>

164
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:00,543
He hands them the ticket,
he walks on the plane. Call the airline.

165
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,612
<i>No, I don't think it works like that.</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>

166
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,955
<i>All right, just tell them what's going on.</i>

167
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:08,687
Okay. Hi. Yes, AirWest?

168
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,157
Thank you.

169
00:09:13,266 --> 00:09:14,893
<i>They're connecting.</i>

170
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:17,664
<i>Hi, my name is Cheryl David and I'm...</i>

171
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,932
<i>I'm on hold.</i>

172
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:32,779
Well? What?

173
00:09:32,852 --> 00:09:36,151
<i>I'm still on hold, Larry.</i>
How are we doing on time?

174
00:09:36,689 --> 00:09:39,681
<i>I don't know. We'll make it, I think.</i>

175
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:44,229
Hi, yes.

176
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:48,358
<i>We're on our way to the airport right now,</i>
our tickets have been stolen.

177
00:09:48,434 --> 00:09:51,426
<i>Somebody's gonna get</i>
on the plane with our tickets.

178
00:09:51,771 --> 00:09:53,534
<i>No...</i>

179
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,043
They just put me on hold.

180
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,641
<i>They're gonna get a supervisor.</i>

181
00:10:02,048 --> 00:10:04,107
Look at this.

182
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,552
Should I go to Lincoln?

183
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,679
- Whatever you want.
- I need Lincoln approval.

184
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:12,987
<i>- I can't do it on my own, tell me.</i>
- Then go Lincoln!

185
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,358
<i>There's the lot.</i>

186
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,426
Hi.

187
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,937
<i>Okay, let me just...</i>

188
00:10:25,505 --> 00:10:28,599
<i>No, because I've already spoken to you.</i>

189
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:31,473
<i>That's what I'm saying,</i>
<i>I can't... You cannot help me.</i>

190
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:34,377
<i>- No, I need a...</i>
- Just forget it.

191
00:10:34,447 --> 00:10:38,577
You know what? Just forget it.
<i>We're already here at the airport.</i>

192
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:40,312
<i>There's no spaces.</i>

193
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:51,427
- This is unbelievable.
- Yeah, parking is hard to find at the airport.

194
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:53,192
<i>That's something new, Larry.</i>

195
00:10:57,136 --> 00:10:59,661
Maybe in retrospect,
<i>we should've taken the car service.</i>

196
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:01,138
Oh, my God.

197
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,369
<i>Larry, we've been down this aisle.</i>

198
00:11:03,443 --> 00:11:06,276
<i>What's this guy doing?</i>

199
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:07,871
Yeah.

200
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:12,244
Excuse me, you leaving?

201
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:13,979
<i>Yeah, he's leaving.</i>

202
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:16,786
Beautiful.

203
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:24,627
<i>So I guess we'll just run to the gate...</i>
<i>Maybe he's already in our seat.</i>

204
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,460
I wonder if he brought a date.

205
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,534
<i>What's taking this guy so long?</i>

206
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,633
- What the hell is he doing?
- Nothing.

207
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:47,380
<i>Yeah, it's all right, take your time.</i>
<i>Nobody's waiting for you.</i>

208
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,353
Make a call, have a cup of coffee.

209
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:52,116
And then have a nice bagel.

210
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:54,253
Take a little nap.

211
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:55,960
<i>That's fine.</i>

212
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:59,355
What are you doing in there?

213
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:04,402
Trade places, you can do it over here.
<i>I'm trying to get catch a plane, sir.</i>

214
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,597
<i>Get here earlier. It's not my fault.</i>

215
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:09,505
- Thanks for the tip.
<i>- She's leaving.</i>

216
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,233
Good, okay.

217
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,706
Yeah.

218
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:20,046
What?

219
00:12:25,258 --> 00:12:26,987
<i>- Did he not...</i>
- Mister!

220
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,864
<i>If the lot's full,</i>
why do they even let you go in?

221
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,729
<i>They shouldn't even give you a ticket.</i>

222
00:12:34,801 --> 00:12:37,634
Gotta drive around
like an idiot for 15 minutes?

223
00:12:37,703 --> 00:12:39,603
God, look at that line.

224
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:45,039
- What do you wanna do?
<i>- We don't have time to stand in line.</i>

225
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:47,978
<i>- We just can't cut right in front.</i>
- This is an exception.

226
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:49,981
<i>We'll have to go to the front and tell her.</i>

227
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:51,380
- Go to the front?
- Yeah.

228
00:12:51,451 --> 00:12:54,887
<i>We'll just explain the situation.</i>
<i>We don't have time, Larry, come on.</i>

229
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,850
- Where are you guys going?
- Hi.

230
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:01,460
<i>- Excuse me, we're in line.</i>
- Somebody took our tickets.

231
00:13:01,527 --> 00:13:03,085
<i>We've lost our tickets.</i>

232
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:05,995
<i>I'd be happy to help you</i>
if you step to the back of the line.

233
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:09,125
<i>We really don't have time.</i>
I was actually on the phone-

234
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:12,569
I understand that, but you need
to get to the back of the line, please.

235
00:13:12,638 --> 00:13:14,503
Everybody here has been waiting, okay?

236
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:17,338
I will take care of you
<i>when it's your turn, okay? Thank you.</i>

237
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,638
Is the plane filled up?

238
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:21,612
Sir, please get to the back of the line
right now, thank you.

239
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,013
<i>I'm so sorry about that.</i>
All right, where were we?

240
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,345
<i>You're all set.</i>

241
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:57,475
<i>I got the guy. That's the guy.</i>

242
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,916
- What?
- I got the guy.

243
00:14:09,595 --> 00:14:11,961
Okay, you can give me the ticket.

244
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:16,029
- I want the ticket.
<i>- I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

245
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:17,228
<i>What I'm talking about?</i>

246
00:14:17,303 --> 00:14:19,635
<i>I'm talking about the ticket</i>
you took from my office.

247
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,969
You memorized the building code,
entered the office.

248
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,168
I want the ticket. I gotta get on the plane.

249
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,939
- You got me confused with somebody else.
<i>- I don't think so.</i>

250
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,241
<i>I don't have your ticket.</i>

251
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,214
- Yeah, right.
- I have my own ticket.

252
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:31,443
Of course you do.

253
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:33,712
<i>It's a bereavement thing, my mother's death.</i>

254
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:37,278
Right, okay, yeah.
<i>I'd like to take a look at it, okay?</i>

255
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:41,119
<i>- It's your ticket, right?</i>
- You wanna see my ticket?

256
00:14:41,194 --> 00:14:42,218
Yeah, I do.

257
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,559
<i>You wanna see? Let's take a look, all right?</i>

258
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,497
- Yeah.
<i>- What's the name right here?</i>

259
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:50,798
<i>Is it your name? No, it's mine.</i>
<i>"Chris Darga."</i>

260
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:54,498
See, if this were yours,<i>
it would say "Fucking Douchebag."</i>

261
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,268
Asshole.

262
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,437
Sorry about your mother.

263
00:15:03,482 --> 00:15:07,919
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>AirWest flight 1459 to Monterey, California...</i>

264
00:15:07,987 --> 00:15:10,421
<i>is now boarding rows 16 through 30.</i>

265
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:14,926
<i>Once again for all AirWest passengers,</i>
<i>flight 1459 to Monterey...</i>

266
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:18,521
<i>we are boarding rows 16 through 30.</i>

267
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,471
I know what you did.

268
00:15:33,813 --> 00:15:35,644
- You talking to me?
- Yeah.

269
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:37,780
- I know.
- What?

270
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,477
- The ticket.
- What ticket?

271
00:15:39,552 --> 00:15:41,019
What are you talking about?

272
00:15:41,087 --> 00:15:43,180
The ticket right here, to Monterey.

273
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:46,623
- I know, come on.
- I think you got the wrong guy.

274
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,719
Give me the ticket back,
<i>I won't say anything-</i>

275
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:52,263
<i>I don't have your ticket.</i>
What are you talking about?

276
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:56,296
Come on, the ticket.

277
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:59,364
Go fuck yourself.

278
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,034
Okay.

279
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,446
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>AirWest flight 1459 to Monterey...</i>

280
00:16:10,516 --> 00:16:13,041
<i>is now boarding rows one through 15.</i>

281
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,149
- What are you doing?
- I was looking for the guy.

282
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,521
Did you look at these people?
Did you see anything?

283
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:22,186
<i>I don't know who you're looking for, Larry.</i>

284
00:16:22,261 --> 00:16:26,425
<i>Final boarding call for flight 1459,</i>
<i>non-stop to Monterey.</i>

285
00:16:26,499 --> 00:16:29,730
<i>Will all remaining passengers please board?</i>

286
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:40,136
Okay, you know,
<i>your flight won't leave for another hour...</i>

287
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:43,204
so you have plenty of time.
<i>We're not even boarding that yet...</i>

288
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:47,013
so just take it easy
<i>and we'll call you when we're ready. Thanks.</i>

289
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:52,917
Hi. We lost our tickets.
We need to get on this flight right now.

290
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,119
Somebody stole our tickets,
<i>they're on the plane.</i>

291
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:58,254
<i>I don't have a single ticket.</i>
<i>I'm completely sold out. I'm sorry.</i>

292
00:16:58,331 --> 00:16:59,662
We already have tickets.

293
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:02,428
The point is, somebody is in our seats, see?

294
00:17:02,501 --> 00:17:05,163
<i>- I don't think that's-</i>
<i>- No, that's very possible-</i>

295
00:17:05,371 --> 00:17:06,531
Actually, the door is closed.

296
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:09,335
That means I am not legally allowed
to go back on the plane.

297
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,773
I can get you on another flight-

298
00:17:10,843 --> 00:17:13,038
<i>Somebody's sitting</i>
in our seats on the plane.

299
00:17:13,112 --> 00:17:17,071
- We have tickets for that flight.
- Can I see the tickets, please?

300
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:19,743
<i>- We don't have them.</i>
- They were stolen.

301
00:17:21,053 --> 00:17:23,647
<i>I can't go on the plane, my hands are tied.</i>

302
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:26,783
But what I can do for you
is I can get you on the next flight...

303
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,486
which will get you in at 4:00.

304
00:17:28,561 --> 00:17:30,529
That would not be good, actually.

305
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,427
We would miss the baptism,
we would miss-

306
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:33,624
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

307
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:37,499
<i>We're trying to go to a wedding,</i>
and we need to be there in a few hours-

308
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:41,597
<i>I have an idea, I think I can actually...</i>
Maybe this will work.

309
00:17:41,674 --> 00:17:43,505
<i>I don't have another flight to Monterey...</i>

310
00:17:43,576 --> 00:17:47,774
but I can send you through San Francisco.
10:30, it would get you into San Francisco.

311
00:17:47,847 --> 00:17:48,939
<i>It's only an hour flight.</i>

312
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:51,710
You can rent a car to Monterey.
<i>It's about 100 miles.</i>

313
00:17:51,784 --> 00:17:54,617
<i>That'd get you in by about 2:00,</i>
and that should work for you.

314
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,450
<i>Then we wouldn't miss the baptism.</i>

315
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:57,819
- Exactly.
<i>- That's fine.</i>

316
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,187
<i>I'll set that up for you.</i>

317
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:01,920
I need a credit card
<i>and I'll get this all rolling for you.</i>

318
00:18:01,994 --> 00:18:04,224
Larry, give her your credit card.

319
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:11,403
- You got the cell phone?
- Yeah.

320
00:18:12,805 --> 00:18:17,265
I wanna call Richard Lewis.
I want you to corroborate this message.

321
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:20,968
- That is so ridiculous.
- Why is it ridiculous?

322
00:18:25,785 --> 00:18:27,377
That is such a funny message.

323
00:18:27,453 --> 00:18:29,751
How did you ever come up
with something like that?

324
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:33,622
You are so clever.
<i>I'm sitting here with my wife...</i>

325
00:18:33,692 --> 00:18:37,253
and I believe that she can shed some light
on this controversy.

326
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:39,991
- So, just hold on.
<i>- No, I don't wanna do that.</i>

327
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:41,758
- Come on, Cheryl.
- Stop it.

328
00:18:41,834 --> 00:18:45,895
<i>I don't want to do it, Larry.</i>
<i>I don't feel like doing that right now.</i>

329
00:18:49,508 --> 00:18:51,669
<i>She'll talk to you in person.</i>

330
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:54,269
She wants to discuss this in person.

331
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:56,506
Okay.

332
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:01,443
<i>Flight 627 to San Francisco...</i>

333
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,609
Thank you.

334
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:05,920
<i>All passengers in rows 16 and higher</i>
<i>may board now.</i>

335
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:18,467
- All set.
- How long does it take to get to Monterey?

336
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:21,404
- About two hours.
- Two hours? We can still make it.

337
00:19:21,474 --> 00:19:23,840
<i>Okay. I'm gonna drive. Thank you.</i>

338
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,574
Jesus Christ, slow down.

339
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:45,457
<i>I'm gonna check the machine.</i>

340
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:52,835
Have you ever had a fresh grape?

341
00:19:56,475 --> 00:19:59,376
<i>I've had fresh apples,</i>
never had a fresh grape.

342
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:03,905
<i>I've never had a fresh cherry,</i>
never had a fresh pear.

343
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:08,480
Never seen a pear.
Never saw a pear outside of a fruit stand.

344
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:10,749
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>The machine's not even coming on.</i>

345
00:20:10,823 --> 00:20:11,847
<i>There's no message.</i>

346
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:14,188
The message that you changed
from your office?

347
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,751
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah. It's not working?</i>

348
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:20,390
- No.
- Did you check it after you changed it?

349
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:23,629
<i>No, I didn't check it,</i>
<i>I thought it was... I did it right.</i>

350
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:24,999
Yeah.

351
00:20:27,306 --> 00:20:28,830
So what?

352
00:20:29,074 --> 00:20:31,872
So we miss a couple of calls, big deal.

353
00:20:38,918 --> 00:20:42,547
<i>This is nice country, don't you think?</i>
Nice country up here.

354
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:45,187
Maybe we should move up here.
Think we should?

355
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:49,421
I think you should look at the map
and find out where we are exactly.

356
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:52,464
Settle down?
Are we settled down, do you think?

357
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:56,126
I mean, what do you have to be
to be settled down?

358
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:57,828
We have a house, and chairs.

359
00:20:57,903 --> 00:21:01,964
You know, grape works as a soda,
sort of as a gum...

360
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:05,139
<i>but I wonder why it doesn't work as a pie.</i>

361
00:21:05,544 --> 00:21:07,739
<i>Grape pie? There's no grape pie.</i>

362
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:09,271
<i>I don't know...</i>

363
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:12,044
did we think
we really needed Alaska and Hawaii?

364
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:13,778
They gotta ruin everything.

365
00:21:13,852 --> 00:21:17,083
They ruined the continental United States.

366
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:20,486
Yeah, we have a beautiful Pacific coast,
Atlantic coast...

367
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,151
<i>that's the continental United States.</i>

368
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:24,991
<i>You don't need more states.</i>
<i>We're not the British empire.</i>

369
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:28,124
What, are they trying to turn us
into the British empire?

370
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:33,702
- And what is Puerto Rico anyway?
- Please, I am trying to drive.

371
00:21:36,775 --> 00:21:40,108
<i>Okay, that's three-tenths of a mile,</i>
right there.

372
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:41,237
Yeah.

373
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:42,778
<i>- So...</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

374
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:46,284
<i>- It's gotta be around here, right?</i>
<i>- Is that a...</i>

375
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:48,252
- Is that a row of pines?
- I will be so mad...

376
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,584
if we miss this. This is a row of pines.

377
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:52,581
We already passed pines.

378
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:55,627
- Is that a car?
<i>- Isn't that a row of pines?</i>

379
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,685
- Is that a car up there?
- Stupid directions.

380
00:21:57,763 --> 00:21:59,856
<i>Let's just stop and get out and take a look.</i>

381
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:02,696
<i>- It's gotta be around here.</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

382
00:22:25,257 --> 00:22:27,350
Stop!

383
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:29,454
No, Larry!

384
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:34,930
<i>What's going on? No! My God! Honey, kick!</i>

385
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,448
<i>Jesus, get him! He can't swim!</i>

386
00:22:39,449 --> 00:22:42,798
- Help!
- Get him! Hold your breath! Kick!

387
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,470
God!

388
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:51,115
Hold on!

389
00:22:58,424 --> 00:22:59,914
How you doing?

390
00:23:08,867 --> 00:23:12,428
Anybody need a change of dry clothes?

391
00:23:14,139 --> 00:23:17,199
- Hot bath?
- You happy about this, Larry?

392
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,676
Is this what you had in mind?
You like this, you dick?

393
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:20,769
<i>Honey, it's fine.</i>

394
00:23:20,846 --> 00:23:23,212
<i>It's not fine.</i>
What the hell is the matter with you?

395
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:25,807
I thought that he was drowning him.
<i>I'm sorry!</i>

396
00:23:25,884 --> 00:23:29,445
<i>Bullshit, you didn't think he was drowning,</i>
<i>you didn't want him to convert.</i>

397
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:33,685
- So you came screaming to stop it.
<i>- What do I care? I don't care if he converts.</i>

398
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,193
That is ridiculous.
<i>You didn't want to lose a Jew.</i>

399
00:23:36,261 --> 00:23:39,128
<i>I don't care if I lose Jews.</i>
<i>Take them all, I don't need them.</i>

400
00:23:39,198 --> 00:23:42,224
That was the point of the baptism,
but you came and blew it.

401
00:23:42,301 --> 00:23:46,760
- What is that supposed to mean?
<i>- I want you, I don't want you to be a Jew.</i>

402
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,864
Tell her it was an accident,
<i>you didn't mean to interrupt.</i>

403
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:52,038
I never saw a baptism before,
<i>I don't know what it is.</i>

404
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,671
- How can you not know what it is?
<i>- I'd never been to one.</i>

405
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:57,682
<i>I've never been to a bris,</i>
but I know what it is.

406
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,082
<i>He didn't mean to interrupt you.</i>

407
00:24:00,152 --> 00:24:03,212
Larry, can I have a word with you
for a second?

408
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:07,624
<i>Come here. You don't know me, Dave Levin.</i>

409
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:09,126
<i>I'm the schmuck's brother-in-law.</i>

410
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:12,561
- What you did is a very gutsy thing.
<i>- No, I didn't do anything.</i>

411
00:24:12,631 --> 00:24:15,464
<i>You don't have to take a bow for it,</i>
<i>I'm just telling you.</i>

412
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:19,334
As one Jew to another,
<i>it's a gutsy thing to come in and step in.</i>

413
00:24:19,404 --> 00:24:22,374
<i>- I didn't even-</i>
- A mitzvah for my family, thank you.

414
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:26,205
<i>- That's the wife.</i>
- You did good. Excuse me, you did good.

415
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:28,337
<i>But I didn't even... I thought he was...</i>

416
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:30,813
<i>Don't be modest about this.</i>
<i>You're with us now.</i>

417
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:33,113
<i>You're with us now, all right?</i>

418
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:36,613
The question is, what do we do now?
When do we go back in?

419
00:24:36,688 --> 00:24:38,883
- Right.
- What do you mean, go back in?

420
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:42,586
- We gotta finish it.
<i>- Finish it? I did it. I did what I said I'd do.</i>

421
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:44,458
I got under the water, you held me under.

422
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,397
No, you just kind of started it,
<i>but it didn't really work.</i>

423
00:24:47,466 --> 00:24:48,466
Not complete.

424
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,833
<i>That's not my fault,</i>
I did what I was supposed to do.

425
00:24:50,903 --> 00:24:52,063
But you gotta go back in.

426
00:24:52,137 --> 00:24:54,833
I dunked you one time,
you need to be dunked three times.

427
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:56,841
You need two more dunks.

428
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:01,008
<i>You're joking, right?</i>
<i>I don't want anymore dunking.</i>

429
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,047
<i>Get back in, a couple of dunks, you're done.</i>

430
00:25:03,115 --> 00:25:07,108
<i>I don't wanna go back in there.</i>
It was hard enough the first time.

431
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:10,417
I like the way you told them
<i>you've never seen a baptism before.</i>

432
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,821
<i>- I've never heard of that.</i>
- That was brilliant.

433
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:15,516
<i>You're a genius.</i>

434
00:25:15,761 --> 00:25:19,492
You know, I thought
something had to be done, really.

435
00:25:19,565 --> 00:25:21,897
You did it. You done did it, boy.

436
00:25:21,967 --> 00:25:26,404
- So, I said that thing about the baptism.
- Yeah, Rabbi Akiva says it takes one man.

437
00:25:26,638 --> 00:25:30,005
<i>We don't have to do it in a river.</i>
Do you have a tub in this house?

438
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:33,200
- Yes, of course, we have a tub.
- We can fill the tub up.

439
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,042
<i>I'll tell you what,</i>
<i>get me a cup of water, I'll sprinkle you.</i>

440
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,242
- Just a cup of water.
<i>- I don't think it's about the river.</i>

441
00:25:39,318 --> 00:25:40,945
<i>I don't think I should be doing this.</i>

442
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:42,680
- What?
- You know what?

443
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:46,622
<i>I don't know what it's like to have a baptism,</i>
<i>or what you're supposed to feel...</i>

444
00:25:46,692 --> 00:25:50,526
but I felt something. When I was held
under the water, I felt a revelation...

445
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:55,090
like it was some sort of message from God
<i>that I shouldn't do this.</i>

446
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:58,330
After I came out of the water,
<i>I didn't feel like a Christian...</i>

447
00:25:58,403 --> 00:25:59,836
I felt like even more of a Jew.

448
00:25:59,905 --> 00:26:01,031
What are you talking about?

449
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:04,132
<i>I'm just saying something happened to me</i>
there that told me...

450
00:26:04,209 --> 00:26:08,111
someone or something was saying,
<i>"Don't do this, be happy with who you are.</i>

451
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,511
<i>"You're Jewish and that's okay."</i>

452
00:26:09,581 --> 00:26:12,277
I need for you to be a Christian
before I marry you.

453
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,615
Whoever steps up
and does something like that?

454
00:26:14,686 --> 00:26:17,052
- I feel good.
- You should.

455
00:26:17,122 --> 00:26:19,283
<i>- You're amazing.</i>
<i>- You're a hero.</i>

456
00:26:20,025 --> 00:26:21,117
Thank you.

457
00:26:21,393 --> 00:26:23,861
<i>I'd like you talk</i>
<i>at my daughter's Bat Mitzvah.</i>

458
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:26,830
Something changed my mind for me,
makes me feel different now.

459
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,697
- I think it was the baptism.
<i>- Then we're not getting married.</i>

460
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:32,100
<i>- I'm not getting baptized.</i>
<i>- I'm not getting married.</i>

461
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:36,732
- Okay, Sheldon, Becky-
- Larry, did you hear that?

462
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:39,743
<i>We're not getting married!</i>
You happy now, you son of a bitch?

463
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:42,780
<i>Don't call him a son of a bitch,</i>
<i>he's not a son of a bitch.</i>

464
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:44,907
This man happened to do
a wonderful thing today.

465
00:26:44,983 --> 00:26:46,814
- What?
- What are you saying...

466
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:49,012
that being a Christian
<i>isn't a wonderful thing?</i>

467
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:51,214
- What are you insinuating?
<i>- He's not saying that.</i>

468
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,054
<i>It's wonderful for you,</i>
we resent the recruitment.

469
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,991
<i>We don't need you.</i>

470
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,660
<i>Everything's a big problem with you people!</i>

471
00:27:33,999 --> 00:27:35,967
<i>It's good to be home.</i>

472
00:27:50,849 --> 00:27:54,114
<i>There's my jacket,</i>
<i>there's the guy you gave my jacket to!</i>

473
00:27:55,187 --> 00:27:57,314
Can you help me out?

474
00:27:57,389 --> 00:28:00,517
- Remember me? I gave you the jacket.
- Hi.

475
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:02,787
<i>That's my jacket,</i>
it looks really good on you.

476
00:28:02,894 --> 00:28:04,794
<i>I'm glad you could use it, there you go.</i>

477
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:05,989
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

478
00:28:06,064 --> 00:28:08,624
- Thanks again for-
