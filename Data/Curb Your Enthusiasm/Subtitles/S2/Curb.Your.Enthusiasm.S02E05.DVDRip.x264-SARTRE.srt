1
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:16,658
So, I'm really happy with my new sneakers.

2
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:20,429
You know, 'cause they're gray.

3
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:25,870
And if you think about it, it's a good color
'cause white is really too bright...

4
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:28,737
and black is almost like a pair of shoes.

5
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:33,403
And gray is kind of right in the middle.
They look good.

6
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:36,806
We should get back to Cheryl.

7
00:00:37,084 --> 00:00:38,847
You know, we just don't
do enough things together.

8
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:42,908
She plays tennis, she won't play golf.
I can't play tennis because of my neck.

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,921
I can't serve,
I'll have to make dainty little serves...

10
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:48,756
and she'll beat me every time.

11
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,856
- What else does Cheryl like to do?
- She likes the outdoors.

12
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,595
I don't really like the outdoors, you know.

13
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:58,160
It's not a good place
for bald people out there.

14
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:01,401
- What about the beach?
- I don't like the beach in particular.

15
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:03,602
The beach is lovely this time of year.

16
00:01:03,677 --> 00:01:05,804
I go up to Santa Barbara,
we go to the beach.

17
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,676
Very nice, it's not crowded.

18
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:12,378
I mean, if I went to the beach with her
<i>she would be...</i>

19
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:17,016
She wouldn't know what to think, yeah.

20
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,549
- She'd be happy.
- Yeah, she'd be very happy.

21
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:22,026
- Go to the beach with her.
- Hate it.

22
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:26,859
All those disgusting bodies walking around,
I have to look at them.

23
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:31,761
Our time is up.

24
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,073
Maybe I'll take her to the beach.

25
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:38,234
- Maybe I will.
- Good idea.

26
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:50,619
Okay, see you next week, be well.

27
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,518
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

28
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:56,892
Nice to see you. You cured?

29
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,794
- 100%%.
- You had the big breakthrough?

30
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:03,097
- I think I'm ready to terminate.
- Okay, yeah. Great.

31
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:05,637
It's such nonsense, isn't it?
What are you gonna do?

32
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:07,172
You can't bother your friends with this stuff.

33
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,333
- This goes on forever.
- I know.

34
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:12,310
- Rob, have a seat, I'll be right in.
- Okay, all right.

35
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:17,546
Yeah, listen, I just want to say,
I'm doing this charity thing.

36
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:21,782
<i>I'm the chairman of this...</i>
You know what Groat's syndrome is?

37
00:02:22,222 --> 00:02:25,055
Groat, have you ever
heard of Groat's syndrome?

38
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:29,687
It's a syndrome. I mean,
and it affects kids and adults...

39
00:02:29,963 --> 00:02:33,899
who have a tough time
controlling their hyperactivity.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,594
It's just like, if you
were on five cups of coffee...

41
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,796
at all times.

42
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:40,066
And so, we're doing a big celebrity auction.

43
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,109
And it would be great
if you would agree to...

44
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:46,668
allow yourself to be auctioned off
and have lunch with somebody.

45
00:02:46,746 --> 00:02:50,739
I mean, a lot of people are doing it.
Tony Danza, and Ted Danson...

46
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:54,177
Wait a second, Rob, first of all...

47
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:57,888
I'm flattered that you would
even think of me for this...

48
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,358
but, Rob, no one wants
to have lunch with me.

49
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:02,418
<i>No, you are the guy who created Seinfeld.</i>

50
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:06,125
- Yeah, but I mean...
- The people'd love to be sitting...

51
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,259
No one's gonna bid any money.
It's gonna be embarrassing.

52
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:13,295
To go to a Larry David lunch?
50 cents, you know, it's ridiculous.

53
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:16,035
You'll be surprised how much money
we'll be able to generate...

54
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,044
just by you agreeing
to have lunch with them.

55
00:03:20,447 --> 00:03:24,474
I just feel like there's a lot of pressure
<i>for me to be entertaining...</i>

56
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:27,247
No, you don't have to be entertaining.
Just be yourself...

57
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,254
and they'll just be thrilled to be with you.

58
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,017
- If you don't want to...
- No, I'll do it.

59
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:32,319
You will? Great.

60
00:03:32,392 --> 00:03:35,088
You'll be surprised at how much you go for.

61
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:36,996
<i>Surprised, I'm gonna be...</i>

62
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:39,691
I think you're gonna
be surprised at how little I go for.

63
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:42,496
Anyway, thanks, Larry, I really appreciate it.
That's great.

64
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:07,850
I think that Santa Barbara thing...

65
00:04:07,928 --> 00:04:10,954
I think that's a pretty good idea.

66
00:04:11,631 --> 00:04:13,599
I think I'm gonna do it.

67
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,599
You know, go to Santa Barbara one day.

68
00:04:28,448 --> 00:04:30,814
So, what are you doing on Saturday?

69
00:04:30,884 --> 00:04:33,148
What do you think about
going to the beach?

70
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:34,709
Santa Barbara.

71
00:04:35,989 --> 00:04:38,082
- The two of us?
- Any interest in that?

72
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:39,785
- Yeah.
- Really?

73
00:04:40,093 --> 00:04:42,254
- I think that would be wonderful.
- Do you?

74
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:43,353
- Of course.
- Really?

75
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,160
Don't you think I would
love to go to the beach?

76
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,427
- Do you? You want to?
- I can't believe that.

77
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,061
What about golf, you're not playing golf?

78
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:53,605
I don't have to play. I won't play, big deal.

79
00:04:53,673 --> 00:04:55,834
You don't have to play every Saturday.

80
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,537
- No, of course not.
- You can spend the day with your wife.

81
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:02,946
- Exactly, that's what I'm doing.
- I would love to accept your invitation.

82
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,950
Okay, you got a date.
Now, what do I need to bring?

83
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:08,783
- You don't need to...
- I need a bathing suit, right?

84
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:09,922
You need a bathing suit...

85
00:05:09,923 --> 00:05:12,414
but that's all you need
to worry yourself with, okay?

86
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,187
I'll take care of the rest.

87
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,821
A radio? Is there a ballgame
I can listen to or anything?

88
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:20,931
Then you're defeating
the purpose, aren't you?

89
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:23,697
So what do you do, you lie down
<i>on a blanket, and...</i>

90
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,761
You bask in the sun.

91
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:27,395
Don't forget sun block.

92
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:28,998
I will not forget sun block.

93
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:33,239
- 35, 40. As high as you can get.
- As high as I can get.

94
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:35,975
Gotcha. I'm looking forward to it.

95
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,255
All right.

96
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:51,396
That was a nice drive, I have to say.

97
00:05:51,464 --> 00:05:53,193
Yeah, look at this.

98
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:58,404
It's beautiful out here.

99
00:05:59,973 --> 00:06:02,703
All right, let's see, I'll grab this.

100
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,205
Shoes in here.

101
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:16,120
- I'll get this.
- What, where do I put this suit on?

102
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:19,085
- Why didn't you wear it?
- You got yours on?

103
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:20,592
Of course.

104
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:23,019
I thought I'd be uncomfortable.

105
00:06:23,096 --> 00:06:24,495
You're going to the beach.

106
00:06:24,564 --> 00:06:28,125
I didn't want to drive an hour and a half
with a bathing suit on.

107
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:32,469
I don't have to put it on.
I'm not gonna go swimming anyway, am I?

108
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,564
So what's the difference?

109
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,371
This is beautiful.

110
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:46,843
You want this water cooler?

111
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,411
- Yeah.
- Okay.

112
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:54,325
I can't carry all this stuff.
What about the umbrella, you want that too?

113
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:55,793
Yes, please.

114
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,926
Oh, my God, this is gorgeous.

115
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:24,420
- Got any sun block?
- Yeah.

116
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:38,233
Jews buy, like, 85%% of the sun block
that's sold in this country, don't you think?

117
00:07:38,905 --> 00:07:40,031
I've never thought about...

118
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:42,870
Without Jews these sun block people
would be out of business.

119
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:44,034
Is that right?

120
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,444
Yeah, I've never once seen a Gentile ask for,
or even put on, sun block.

121
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:49,907
True.

122
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,959
I don't really get this fascination
that people have with the ocean.

123
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,054
No?

124
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:08,993
I stare at it for 10 minutes<i>
and I go, "Okay, I get it."</i>

125
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:10,967
Don't you feel calmer?

126
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:15,264
I feel aggravated that I'm missing
what other people are getting.

127
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:27,309
- Holy shit.
- What?

128
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:31,355
I think I just saw my therapist.
You see a guy in a striped bathing suit?

129
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:33,551
Skimpy, skimpy suit, you see that?

130
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:36,595
- Yeah, I see him.
- Yeah, that's my therapist.

131
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,720
Why don't you go say hi?

132
00:08:38,798 --> 00:08:42,990
- I can't talk to him in that bathing suit.
- It is pretty small.

133
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,593
How can he walk around
in a bathing suit like that?

134
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:49,631
I mean, he's at the beach,
he can wear whatever he wants, right?

135
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:54,112
- What's he doing?
- He's just kind of settling in.

136
00:08:56,182 --> 00:09:00,710
Did you see the back of his bathing suit?
How does he walk around like that?

137
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,846
Can we go? Let's just go.

138
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:05,823
We just got here, we're not gonna go.

139
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:10,921
That's ridiculous. Plus, if you get up,
don't you think he'll see you then?

140
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,659
I've got to stay like this now,
for the rest of the day?

141
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,861
I guess that's up to you.

142
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,629
Kiss that therapist goodbye.

143
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:23,203
The only question now is,
do I tell Richard Lewis?

144
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:29,748
- Are you sure it was Dr. Weiss?
- It was him, it was him.

145
00:09:29,816 --> 00:09:33,547
No question about it.
It was Weiss, Dr. Weiss.

146
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,716
Thong, up his ass.

147
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:40,556
- Like Richard Simmons?
- Richard Simmons has a thong up his ass?

148
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,458
- Did you ever see him do that shit?
- No.

149
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:43,825
Holy shit.

150
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:49,134
So, you know, I just wanted to tell you,
<i>you know, so I'm leaving...</i>

151
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:51,261
You know what, this is so unfair of you.

152
00:09:51,337 --> 00:09:53,635
I turn you on to this guy,
he's a brilliant doctor.

153
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:56,732
- I would've never told you.
- You should be thanking me.

154
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:00,074
Saving you from this hedonist
giving you advice.

155
00:10:00,146 --> 00:10:01,875
Hedonist, he's a hedonist?

156
00:10:01,948 --> 00:10:03,381
- He's not a hedonist.
- What is he?

157
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:06,350
This is my 28th therapist since 1969.

158
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:08,887
I don't want to go anymore,
I don't want to break the record.

159
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:12,288
The recap is very hard.
Your recap is two, three months, isn't it?

160
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:15,156
Two, three months? That's just the crib.

161
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:20,355
I was born in Brooklyn, and I felt alienated...

162
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:24,699
- and I became an alcoholic.
- Okay, you don't have to do it right now.

163
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:28,706
How am I gonna tell him
I'm gonna leave now?

164
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:32,802
Is it like a woman?
Can you do it on the phone?

165
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,278
You're not canceling cable.

166
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:37,441
You have to go in. He's a human being.
<i>You got to say...</i>

167
00:10:37,517 --> 00:10:41,954
Let's go out to lunch, let's talk about this,
'cause we need a game plan.

168
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:45,149
There's no plan, you go in and quit.
What are you gonna do?

169
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:48,421
- Can't we have lunch and discuss this?
- I can't.

170
00:10:49,796 --> 00:10:53,095
- Why not?
- I've been auctioned off for some charity.

171
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:55,394
<i>What is this, Roots?</i>
What you mean, "auctioned off?"

172
00:10:55,468 --> 00:10:57,402
It's some celebrity auction.

173
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:00,371
Somebody paid $4,000
to go have lunch with me.

174
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,840
- Do you believe that?
- You should be flattered.

175
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:05,070
He wants to have lunch with Larry David.

176
00:11:05,144 --> 00:11:08,944
I feel a lot of pressure
to be entertaining, you know?

177
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:11,141
All right, enjoy your lunch.

178
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:20,624
Mr. David! Mr. David, over here.

179
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,991
- Hiya, John Tyler.
- John Tyler?

180
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:27,829
Like the president.

181
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:30,193
President Tyler.

182
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:33,169
- Yeah.
- Should I call you Mr. President?

183
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,706
This is great. Thank you
for donating your time...

184
00:11:35,775 --> 00:11:37,242
for the auction and everything.

185
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,437
<i>"Tippecanoe and Tyler, too."</i>

186
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,278
- You know what "Tippecanoe" was?
- No.

187
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:46,384
You don't know?
If I was named after a president...

188
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,079
I would know everything about him.

189
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,622
I wasn't named after him,
it's just a family name.

190
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,183
- You never know. I'm related to King David.
- Really?

191
00:11:55,194 --> 00:12:00,131
Yes, so, a president and a king...

192
00:12:01,134 --> 00:12:03,796
at the same table. Pretty big table.

193
00:12:05,238 --> 00:12:07,672
- It's a family name, really.
- Big family?

194
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,335
Yeah, five brothers and sisters,
you know, Irish.

195
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,508
You ever catch your parents having sex?

196
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:17,539
- No.
- Me either.

197
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:22,918
You know they did, but you wonder when.

198
00:12:24,757 --> 00:12:26,315
So where you from?

199
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:28,587
- Jersey, originally.
- Yeah?

200
00:12:28,895 --> 00:12:31,056
You ever see Joe Piscopo's Jersey Guy?

201
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,529
"I'm Jersey guy.

202
00:12:32,598 --> 00:12:35,465
<i>"I'm from Jersey, I'm the Jersey guy."</i>

203
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,800
Yeah, people from Jersey
didn't really find that guy funny.

204
00:12:43,342 --> 00:12:45,902
Ever play the salt and pepper shakers?

205
00:12:49,449 --> 00:12:51,110
What song is this?

206
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,452
<i>"Happy Birthday To You."</i>

207
00:12:58,524 --> 00:13:00,219
<i>Happy birthday</i>

208
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:05,286
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President John Tyler</i>

209
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,096
<i>Happy birthday</i>

210
00:13:11,337 --> 00:13:15,273
Anyway, everybody
<i>from Groat's Syndrome Association just...</i>

211
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,303
Thank you for your time...

212
00:13:17,376 --> 00:13:20,174
and for donating the lunch.
We really appreciate it.

213
00:13:20,246 --> 00:13:22,771
Please, whatever you need,
I'll donate anything you want.

214
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,841
I'll donate it all. My time, my organs.

215
00:13:25,952 --> 00:13:28,750
What do you want, you want a kidney?
I'll give it to you.

216
00:13:28,821 --> 00:13:30,152
What else do you need?

217
00:13:30,223 --> 00:13:33,784
I've got a terrific penis.
I could donate a penis.

218
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:37,458
I've got good spleen, excellent spleen.

219
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,328
<i>Mr. Spleen gets rid of dirt and grime</i>

220
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,957
<i>And grease in just a minute</i>

221
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:44,127
<i>Mr. Spleen will clean your whole house</i>

222
00:13:44,203 --> 00:13:46,899
<i>And everything that's in it, Mr. Spleen</i>

223
00:13:47,073 --> 00:13:51,407
<i>If you change "Mr. " to "Monsieur,"</i>
<i>say, "Monsieur Spleen"...</i>

224
00:13:51,744 --> 00:13:53,644
then you'll think that the commercial was...

225
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:56,045
<i>Monsieur Clean, Monsieur Clean</i>

226
00:13:59,552 --> 00:14:01,747
It's a devastating illness...

227
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:04,682
and we just appreciate
everything you've done.

228
00:14:04,891 --> 00:14:06,984
I've never heard of it. What is it called?

229
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,425
- Groat's syndrome.
- And what does it do?

230
00:14:10,563 --> 00:14:12,758
It's a nervous system syndrome...

231
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:15,926
that makes people extremely
excited and nervous.

232
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,799
- My niece has it.
- Of course, Dick Groat.

233
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,132
Named after Dick Groat...

234
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:21,605
who used to play shortstop
for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

235
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:24,734
I know, 'cause he was a bald guy.
And he didn't feel very well...

236
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,973
'cause he was very excited
all the time, is that it?

237
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:32,174
No, the doctor that initially diagnosed it
was named Groat.

238
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,746
- You sure it wasn't Dick Groat?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

239
00:14:35,888 --> 00:14:39,415
Dr. Groat might be Dick Groat's father,
for all we know.

240
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,519
- No?
<i>- No, my niece has it, and...</i>

241
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,231
You might want to check into that.

242
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:51,264
So, he's wearing this skimpy
kind of Speedo bathing suit...

243
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:53,669
his boys are hanging out all over the place.

244
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:57,266
I'm not going back there.
No way, I can't, would you?

245
00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:00,335
- To the beach?
- No, to the therapist.

246
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:04,741
Yours will be ready
in just a few minutes, sir.

247
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:17,088
- Mind if I start?
- He said it'll just be a couple minutes.

248
00:15:23,536 --> 00:15:26,437
So, you don't want me to start, is that it?

249
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,409
It's a couple minutes.
You don't mind, do you?

250
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:32,944
I just think it's kind of weird.

251
00:15:33,012 --> 00:15:35,242
I mean, if you had your food come first...

252
00:15:35,314 --> 00:15:37,407
I would say, go ahead and start,
what do I care?

253
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:40,543
- I would wait for you to get yours.
- I wouldn't want you to wait.

254
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,110
I'd be uncomfortable if you waited.

255
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:45,214
I'd feel it would be polite to wait
for your food to arrive.

256
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,418
I think it's kind of impolite
to prevent a person...

257
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:48,755
who is hungry from eating.

258
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:50,693
Yeah, but we're supposed
to be having lunch together.

259
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:54,927
Do we have to start at the exact same time?
I don't get that.

260
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:59,299
I don't see why you can't wait two seconds
for your cold sandwich. It's not even hot.

261
00:15:59,372 --> 00:16:01,806
I don't see why you care
if I take a bite of my food.

262
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:04,809
- How does that bother you?
- Because we're having lunch together.

263
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:06,845
- So what?
- The two of us.

264
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,317
Thanks.

265
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,759
Thanks for switching appointments with me.

266
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,157
Yeah, no, problem.

267
00:16:22,228 --> 00:16:25,925
Larry, what happened with that lunch?
What did you do?

268
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:29,100
<i>- I'm sorry, I just...</i>
- What did you do?

269
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:32,831
I felt so much pressure
from the fact that this guy had paid $4,000...

270
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:36,363
and I tried too hard to
be entertaining and affable.

271
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:39,110
So, you told him that Groat's syndrome...

272
00:16:39,178 --> 00:16:42,477
was named after the shortstop
for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Dick Groat?

273
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:46,040
I didn't say that as a fact,
<i>I speculated, because...</i>

274
00:16:46,118 --> 00:16:48,518
Yeah, 'cause Lou Gehrig
had a disease named after him.

275
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:51,522
And Dick Groat was a ball player.
I thought it was a possibility.

276
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,387
Didn't you read the literature I sent you?

277
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:56,451
- That depresses me.
- Then you shouldn't have agreed to do it.

278
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,898
- I was just having lunch with the guy.
- I know, but Larry, that's another thing.

279
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:03,992
You start eating before he gets his food?

280
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:07,702
<i>What kind of... I mean,</i>
Groat's or no Groat's...

281
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,105
I mean, where are your manners?

282
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:13,877
I asked if he would mind. I was starving.

283
00:17:13,946 --> 00:17:15,937
- And what did he say?
- He said he did mind.

284
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:18,506
And you should've taken that
as your cue to wait...

285
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:21,212
till his food arrived,
so that you could start eating.

286
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:22,914
Meanwhile, the guy's insulted.

287
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:24,979
I said, "Do you mind if I start?"
<i>He said, "Yes."</i>

288
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:27,753
What kind of person says yes
to "Do you mind if I start?"

289
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,624
Do you know anybody who would do that?

290
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,686
He told me he was going
to cancel the check...

291
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:35,564
<i>unless, you know... I was like, searching.</i>

292
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:38,603
I said, "Is there anything we can do
to make it up to you?"

293
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,161
He said, "Maybe if Larry would...

294
00:17:40,239 --> 00:17:42,469
"get more involved
and show that he really cared...

295
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:46,136
"about Groat's syndrome, maybe then<i>
I would agree to give the money."</i>

296
00:17:46,212 --> 00:17:49,477
And I suggested,
"If Larry would agree to host...

297
00:17:49,548 --> 00:17:51,311
"the Groat's syndrome talent show...

298
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:54,285
"maybe he could make it<i>
up to you that way."</i>

299
00:17:54,353 --> 00:17:57,083
And he said he would agree
to make his donation...

300
00:17:57,156 --> 00:18:00,057
if you would agree to host the talent show.

301
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,685
Couldn't I just write the check?

302
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:06,129
Larry, that's not the point.

303
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:07,859
It's not just the giving money.

304
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:11,425
It's getting involved, you know, in Groat's.

305
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:14,539
It's being Groat's active.

306
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:18,074
It's not a big deal,
all you got to do is you show up...

307
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:20,806
you say a few things,
you make a couple of jokes...

308
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,475
and then you introduce
the participants in the show.

309
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,075
These are all people,
by the way, with Groat's syndrome.

310
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:29,713
These are all people who will demonstrate...

311
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,485
that you can have a life
with Groat's syndrome...

312
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,584
and you can be active
and talented and all of that.

313
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:38,129
I don't understand how lunch could come...

314
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:40,961
<i>and it's right in front of you, and...</i>

315
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:44,332
If you don't feel like
you've done anything wrong...

316
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,462
and you don't feel like
you have to make it up to them...

317
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:48,439
then fine, go your merry way.

318
00:18:48,507 --> 00:18:50,737
I don't want you to lose the check.

319
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,143
This would go a long way
to helping us secure that check...

320
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:56,579
and I think also, do quite a bit...

321
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:59,117
in raising some consciousness
about Groat's.

322
00:18:59,185 --> 00:19:02,643
They still trust me now,
they would want me to do that?

323
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,348
Okay, all right. Good to talk to you.

324
00:19:08,427 --> 00:19:10,258
All right, thanks a lot.

325
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,320
- You'll think about it?
- I definitely will.

326
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:14,059
- Feel good.
- All right, you too.

327
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:15,896
- Okay, I do.
- Goodbye.

328
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,004
Hello.

329
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:27,501
Hello.

330
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,777
I've got some...

331
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,609
big news.

332
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:38,913
<i>And the news is that...</i>

333
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:42,186
I think I'm all better.

334
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:45,695
- Really?
- I'm feeling pretty good.

335
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:48,926
Pretty, pretty, pretty...

336
00:19:49,001 --> 00:19:52,368
pretty, pretty good.

337
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,667
- What happened?
- I had an epiphany.

338
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:01,304
<i>And I'm just...</i>
My whole life is in perspective.

339
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:04,549
I feel great.

340
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:08,079
- What was your epiphany?
- I'm ready to terminate.

341
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:11,589
- I'm terminating. I think I can terminate.
- That's wonderful, Larry.

342
00:20:11,657 --> 00:20:14,353
You know what I am? I'm the terminator.

343
00:20:15,194 --> 00:20:17,856
- I am the terminator.
- Was it the beach?

344
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,889
- Was it going to the beach that did it?
- I didn't go to the beach.

345
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,704
<i>I went shopping with my wife, and...</i>

346
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,968
Which is even better,
to go shopping with her. Imagine that.

347
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,669
- No beach?
- I didn't go to the beach, no.

348
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,642
But here's the thing that I want to say.

349
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,646
Once in a while,
I'm sure I'll have a problem...

350
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:38,547
that's gonna come up.
I would love to be able to come back.

351
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:43,179
You know, just intermittently, if I can,
if you'll have me, I hope you will.

352
00:20:43,489 --> 00:20:46,652
Just to kind of have
a little refresher course...

353
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:48,693
just in case things start to go off again.

354
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:52,288
So, now you feel
all these things that were upsetting you...

355
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:54,764
Yes, I don't need to
come in regularly anymore.

356
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,894
- All the problems, the Jason Alexander...
- Jason Alexander, yeah, what?

357
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:01,165
I go to his office for a meeting...

358
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,832
he wants me to go back
for the next meeting.

359
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:04,500
You see how agitated you are, Larry?

360
00:21:04,577 --> 00:21:07,273
I mean, that's a situation
that I find rather annoying.

361
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:09,143
Yeah, but that's okay, that's okay.

362
00:21:09,214 --> 00:21:11,512
No, I mean, 'cause you
just got through saying...

363
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:12,710
how great you feel.

364
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:14,082
I do feel great.

365
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:17,122
But, if you're gonna
remind me of the holocaust...

366
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:18,383
I'm not gonna feel so great.

367
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:21,358
- Frankly, you seem...
- I don't really think I need to come.

368
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:24,624
- You seem agitated today.
- Agitated?

369
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,427
No, what you're
seeing as agitation is actually ebullience.

370
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:31,795
You've never seen me ebullient,
so you don't even know what it is.

371
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,498
"Who am I?" you're saying to yourself.

372
00:21:34,807 --> 00:21:37,970
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
Who are you?

373
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:42,043
I don't even want to talk about it too much,
lest I dissipate it.

374
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,445
<i>I mean...</i>

375
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:49,220
I see swings of emotion
that disturb me a little bit, Larry.

376
00:21:49,288 --> 00:21:51,688
There's no swing. I'm a hammock.

377
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:54,248
- A hammock is very placid.
- A hammock?

378
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,126
Yeah, just gently flowing
in the breeze, that's me.

379
00:21:58,397 --> 00:21:59,455
I must tell you, Larry...

380
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:02,056
you don't seem to be
gently flowing in the breeze.

381
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:05,035
You've been in therapy for a while,
I know you pretty well.

382
00:22:05,104 --> 00:22:08,767
I feel bad that you
are such a good therapist...

383
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:12,277
that you're kind of a victim
of your own talents and skills...

384
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:15,711
that you have to lose a patient
because of the job that you did.

385
00:22:15,781 --> 00:22:17,908
It's unfortunate, I'm sorry.

386
00:22:18,183 --> 00:22:22,119
I just want to make sure that I'm losing you
for the reason that you're saying.

387
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:23,814
Yeah, of course you are.

388
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:26,414
Because I know
you were at the beach, Larry.

389
00:22:26,625 --> 00:22:28,525
I was not at the beach.

390
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:32,558
So it had nothing to do with the thong?

391
00:22:42,741 --> 00:22:44,572
- So?
- He's on to us.

392
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,998
He knows about the whole thong thing.

393
00:22:47,093 --> 00:22:48,606
He knows about the thong thing.

394
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:50,706
- He's on to us?
- He's on to me.

395
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,183
How did this happen? He's on to me now.

396
00:22:53,252 --> 00:22:55,015
- He'll be on to you.
- How did this happen?

397
00:22:55,087 --> 00:22:56,111
Who told him?

398
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,315
I had this lunch
with that guy for the charity...

399
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,618
and I told him about it.

400
00:22:59,692 --> 00:23:01,353
He must've told Rob, who told him.

401
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,520
<i>Why would Rob even... Christ.</i>

402
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:05,630
It must have come up somehow,
I don't know.

403
00:23:05,698 --> 00:23:08,258
So what happened? Are you out of there?

404
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,358
- I'm out, yeah.
- How?

405
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:13,462
I told him I was happy
and I didn't need the therapy.

406
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:15,939
- You told him what?
- I told him I was happy.

407
00:23:16,008 --> 00:23:19,000
That's what I'm telling him.
How can you steal my termination?

408
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:21,171
I didn't. I didn't know
you were gonna say that.

409
00:23:21,246 --> 00:23:24,010
- How else am I gonna leave a shrink?
- How the fuck do I know?

410
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,779
I'm miserable and I'm suicidal,
I want to leave?

411
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:28,342
So, what am I gonna do?

412
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,411
Tell him you're
a Scientologist or something.

413
00:23:30,489 --> 00:23:32,719
- I'm not.
- Tell him you're into Scientology.

414
00:23:32,791 --> 00:23:34,884
It's easy for you to say, I'm a shrink person.

415
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,019
It doesn't matter,
you need something to get out.

416
00:23:37,096 --> 00:23:39,724
- Tell him you went to Scientology.
- I need a better excuse.

417
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:41,993
Look, what is this? This is what?

418
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,695
Is this the Beverly Center, this thing?

419
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,001
This is so... Look at this,
with the leather, the whole thing here.

420
00:23:48,073 --> 00:23:50,234
- No, that's unbelievable.
- Yeah, okay.

421
00:23:50,309 --> 00:23:54,370
Listen, it's good to see you.
Stay feeling good, I feel great too.

422
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,380
What's the name of that book again...

423
00:23:56,448 --> 00:23:57,608
<i>Battlestar Galactica?</i>

424
00:23:57,683 --> 00:24:00,709
<i>- I don't know, I just...</i>
- I'll look, I'll check that out.

425
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:02,185
It's a movie too, isn't it?

426
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:07,191
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- I'm very happy, I'm very happy for you.

427
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:09,720
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

428
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:12,263
I've never felt better in my entire life.

429
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:17,367
<i>Groat's, we're not as hyper as we seem</i>

430
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:23,607
<i>Groat's, let's hold on to the dream</i>

431
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:26,709
Thank you.

432
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:32,810
Yes, that was Beth Sweeney,
ladies and gentlemen.

433
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:35,410
Another round of applause
for Beth Sweeney.

434
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:37,318
Wasn't she wonderful?

435
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:41,250
And she is living proof
of the great work being done...

436
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:44,762
by our team of scientists
at the Groat's laboratories.

437
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,191
And I have been assured
that after they come up...

438
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:50,497
with a cure for Groat's,
they're gonna tackle baldness.

439
00:24:50,803 --> 00:24:54,170
I've been assured.
So, watch out, bald people.

440
00:24:54,706 --> 00:24:58,608
Your day is coming.
Don't give up hope, keep hope alive.

441
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,539
You must keep hope alive, bald people.

442
00:25:02,414 --> 00:25:05,349
Okay, our next performer...

443
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:09,481
is a young lady who comes to us
from Fullerton, California.

444
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,822
And she's a pianist.

445
00:25:12,658 --> 00:25:14,683
And I think you're going
to enjoy her very much.

446
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:18,321
Please welcome Miss Melanie Tyler...

447
00:25:18,397 --> 00:25:20,991
ladies and gentlemen, Melanie Tyler.

448
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:03,072
This is awful. You can't let her do this.

449
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:07,243
- I don't know if we should pull her off.
- I gotta get her off.

450
00:26:13,452 --> 00:26:15,852
- Time to stop.
- No!

451
00:26:15,921 --> 00:26:18,116
- Come on, stop.
- No!
