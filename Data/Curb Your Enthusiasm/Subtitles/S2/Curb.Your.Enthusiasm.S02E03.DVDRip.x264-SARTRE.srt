1
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,252
- Are you nervous?
- I'm very nervous.

2
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:17,456
I was saying earlier...

3
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:20,659
This is my first time I'll sit,
and on the screen of a movie...

4
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:23,498
my name is the only name up,
as sole writing credits.

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,266
- That is exciting.
- It's the first time with an audience.

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,706
<i>The first screening for... And all my friends.</i>

7
00:00:28,775 --> 00:00:30,242
And the industry people as well.

8
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,299
- Hey.
- Hello.

9
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:32,399
Hi, Cliff.

10
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:34,243
I'm glad you could join us.

11
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:37,407
Sorry I'm late.

12
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:39,513
I just couldn't pick out an outfit.

13
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:41,349
Just stop it.

14
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,480
It's actually the truth. I'm not even joking.

15
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:45,218
- I drove by the theater.
- And?

16
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,384
I saw the marquee.

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,155
- And how does it look?
- It looks great.

18
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:51,026
<i>The numbers... 30 Below.</i>
Instead of spelling that out?

19
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:52,827
I'm gonna get a picture of that, too.

20
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:54,457
Yes, you have to get a picture.

21
00:00:54,534 --> 00:00:56,729
- This is a big night. Yeah!
- It is.

22
00:00:56,803 --> 00:00:58,327
Very excited.

23
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:01,670
Where did you come up with the idea?
Shelley told me something about...

24
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:04,108
- Cliff Cobb, table of four?
- Great.

25
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,975
You know, I understand what it's like...
Thank you.

26
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:09,811
...to do something
that you put your heart and soul into.

27
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:13,317
The whole process is different
<i>if you're just a writer for hire...</i>

28
00:01:13,387 --> 00:01:15,321
Hey, how's Cheryl's present coming?

29
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:16,549
It's just beautiful.

30
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:19,922
One of the most beautiful bracelets
I've made, I have to say.

31
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:22,018
<i>Her birthday's on Friday, so I...</i>

32
00:01:22,095 --> 00:01:24,154
- You'll have it before then.
- By Thursday?

33
00:01:24,231 --> 00:01:26,699
- No problem.
- Great. Thanks so much.

34
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:30,293
<i>I can't believe you've been...</i>

35
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,600
I have been trying to get to
<i>the Amazon for...</i>

36
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,266
You've got to go.
<i>If you've been feeling that way...</i>

37
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:39,403
Particularly west of the river, north a little,
it's unbelievable.

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,106
And is it just a bunch of people?

39
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:44,776
Yeah, it's you and guides, in a group.
It's a large group.

40
00:01:44,851 --> 00:01:45,977
<i>You just go to...</i>

41
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:48,179
I think it depends which company
you go through.

42
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:51,190
They'll put together different groups
to go out there and do it.

43
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:53,726
- Are there tons of snakes?
- There's tons of everything.

44
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:56,319
But that's why you go, right?
<i>You're gonna see it and...</i>

45
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:58,057
Forgot my napkin.

46
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:00,723
You know, it's etiquette.

47
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:04,131
Very important. Must put the napkin on.

48
00:02:04,404 --> 00:02:08,397
It seems silly to put a napkin on
an old pair of pants.

49
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,375
...unless it's some kind of huge emergency.

50
00:02:10,444 --> 00:02:12,605
- Are we ready?
- Yes, please.

51
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,876
Okay, I think I'll have the grilled salmon.

52
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:17,007
Grilled salmon, all right.

53
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,710
- Yeah, me, too, actually. Same.
- Okay.

54
00:02:18,785 --> 00:02:21,652
- I'll have the paella.
- Good choice.

55
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:27,150
I think I'm just gonna get a Cobb salad.

56
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:28,622
Okay. Cobb salad.

57
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:32,529
And I want to make
just a couple of substitutions if that's okay?

58
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,089
- Sure.
- Okay.

59
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:38,694
- I'll get no bacon.
- No bacon.

60
00:02:38,905 --> 00:02:41,703
No eggs.

61
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,138
Take it easy.

62
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:47,346
Blue cheese on the side.

63
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:50,712
- You sure want a Cobb salad?
- You should get something else.

64
00:02:50,784 --> 00:02:53,252
I'm getting a David salad.

65
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,412
Yeah, it is a David salad.

66
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:56,922
And I'll get agitation, if you can.

67
00:02:57,357 --> 00:03:00,349
And if the chef can't do this,
if he makes a face at all...

68
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:03,089
- just come back and let me know.
- Okay.

69
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:06,359
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

70
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:10,868
Do you go through that
every time you order that salad?

71
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,667
Sounds like you're having a problem
with that of some kind.

72
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,268
- Is it a big deal? What's the big deal?
- It is. It's my grandfather's salad.

73
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,376
- And yeah, it is a big deal.
<i>- So...</i>

74
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:23,416
It was your grandfather's salad!

75
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:26,611
- My grandfather created the Cobb salad.
- Is that true?

76
00:03:26,686 --> 00:03:28,278
I'm the "Cobb" of Cobb salad.

77
00:03:28,355 --> 00:03:30,516
- He's told this many times.
- Oh, my God!

78
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:33,024
- It's true.
- This is a nice little bullshit story.

79
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,493
No, I am not lying about this.

80
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,689
My grandfather was a chef.
He worked all over...

81
00:03:37,764 --> 00:03:39,994
and there was a time
he was at the Drake Hotel...

82
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:44,526
working in Chicago and he would
experiment with different combinations.

83
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:46,435
And the word got out.

84
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:48,836
That's how the Cobb salad was born.

85
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:51,469
What? Why is that so hard to believe?

86
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:53,570
It's just so unbelievable.

87
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:56,172
It's just, so many people do
what you just did...

88
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,443
and I just don't understand.

89
00:03:57,517 --> 00:04:01,044
I can tell you this, I'm not gonna do it again
if you're at the table.

90
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,284
No, I apologize. I'm jumpy tonight.

91
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,020
<i>The movie, it's...</i>

92
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:10,153
I was thinking, "What does he give a shit
about what I'm ordering in my salad?"

93
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,058
<i>Let's... What were we saying?</i>
We were talking about what?

94
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:15,226
I want to get out in the rough.

95
00:04:15,302 --> 00:04:16,792
Right. Amazon.

96
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,431
Did I tell you that I have a very good friend
that went to South Africa?

97
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:22,566
South Africa. Beautiful. I've been there, too.

98
00:04:22,642 --> 00:04:23,939
He went for a hunting trip.

99
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,309
You know, my grandfather's name
was Harold Bingo.

100
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,610
He invented Bingo. Are you aware of that?

101
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:32,584
Do you move your camp
or is it a base camp?

102
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:33,983
I'm not kidding.

103
00:04:34,054 --> 00:04:35,248
<i>They don't even...</i>

104
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:37,722
We can talk about anything,
they don't have any idea.

105
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,486
Get their own table.

106
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:40,821
Doesn't make a difference.

107
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:44,091
They'll take you out there
<i>and get you so close to these animals...</i>

108
00:04:44,164 --> 00:04:47,565
- We should have sex sometime.
- Yes, we should.

109
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,095
Really?

110
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:52,166
...when you're right there
<i>and looking at it...</i>

111
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:03,879
Larry, how you doing?

112
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,145
Donald, good to see you.

113
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:08,710
- What's new?
- Well, not too much.

114
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,820
- How about you?
- Playing a lot of golf.

115
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:12,380
- Really?
- Yeah.

116
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:14,993
You know, we should play it sometime.

117
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:17,657
I don't play golf.

118
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,164
- Since when?
- I haven't played in a long time.

119
00:05:21,234 --> 00:05:22,826
- You don't play golf anymore?
- No.

120
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,460
Larry, come on.

121
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:26,936
Listen, if you change your mind,
let me know, okay?

122
00:05:27,007 --> 00:05:28,474
- Good to see you.
- Okay.

123
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,135
So glad you could make it to see it.
Go get a seat.

124
00:05:31,211 --> 00:05:33,543
- Listen, I'm gonna check the house.
- Okay.

125
00:05:33,613 --> 00:05:34,910
See what's up.

126
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,410
What is that? I don't know that.

127
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:43,979
- It's Wagner.
- Really?

128
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,820
<i>It's called Siegfried Idyll...</i>

129
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:49,623
and he wrote it as a birthday present
for his wife Cosima.

130
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:53,421
She woke up in the morning
and she heard this beautiful music...

131
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,664
and she came out on the landing
and he was conducting this orchestra.

132
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:59,568
- That is so beautiful.
- So romantic.

133
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,129
Yeah, listen to this.

134
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,368
That's pretty.

135
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,381
Excuse me.

136
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,310
Are you Jewish?

137
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:19,716
Are you Jewish?

138
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,527
You wanna check my penis?
Is that what you wanna do?

139
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:26,531
My real question is,
what were you whistling?

140
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:29,996
<i>- Hello, Dolly.</i>
- No, it's Wagner.

141
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,100
- Was it?
- Yeah.

142
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,196
You, sir, won $100.

143
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:35,867
I wanna know
what a Jew is whistling Wagner for...

144
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you wanna know?

145
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,501
...when he's one of the great
anti-Semites of the world.

146
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,103
- You know what you are?
- What am I?

147
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:43,308
- You're a self-loathing Jew.
- Am I?

148
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:44,543
Yes!

149
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,848
I do hate myself, but it has nothing to do
with being Jewish.

150
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:50,253
No, it doesn't have anything to do
with being Jewish.

151
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:53,759
Those millions of Jews were taken
to the concentration camps...

152
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:56,159
with Wagner being played
in the background.

153
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:58,254
Yes! Hitler's favorite composer!

154
00:06:58,331 --> 00:06:59,380
- Really?
- Yes.

155
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,799
They got a mental asylum
a couple of blocks away.

156
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:05,668
I suggest you go and check yourself in.

157
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:06,865
Where's your Judaism?

158
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,840
Judaism? Where are you?

159
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:10,808
Where are you, Judaism?

160
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:13,641
How can you have this attitude?
That you're better?

161
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:17,080
They should put a muzzle on you.
You're foaming at the mouth.

162
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:18,650
Please, thank you.

163
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:21,778
That's something you need to think about,
all right?

164
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:23,445
- Hi, how are you?
- What's going on?

165
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,320
- Everything all right?
- No.

166
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,383
- But I'm looking forward to your movie.
- I'm so glad you're here.

167
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,486
Get a seat. I'm so glad you're here.

168
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:32,554
- Is everything all right?
- You know that guy?

169
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:33,963
- That's Walter.
- Walter?

170
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:37,696
Yeah, he lives right by you.
Two streets away in your neighborhood.

171
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:39,636
- That's comforting.
- He's really obnoxious.

172
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,765
We should get a seat. Come on.

173
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:04,659
Can you keep it down?

174
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:07,497
Hey, I'm allowed to eat popcorn.

175
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:27,514
Stop it.

176
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,779
I'm tired. I'm sorry.

177
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:47,432
I just welled up.

178
00:08:47,516 --> 00:08:49,440
Mazel tov. Mazel tov.

179
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,174
Congratulations.

180
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:54,178
Cliff, oh, my gosh!

181
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:57,310
- That was wonderful.
- Congratulations!

182
00:08:57,383 --> 00:08:58,441
I mean, perfect.

183
00:08:58,518 --> 00:08:59,815
- Great job.
- Thank you very much.

184
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:00,899
Fantastic!

185
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:04,117
I can't believe that you had that guy
dive into that ice-cold water.

186
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,021
- You liked that?
- Yeah. I mean, my God!

187
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:09,550
I know it's freezing 'cause you can
see the smoke coming out of his mouth.

188
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:12,257
Is it smoke? What comes out of your mouth
in cold water?

189
00:09:12,332 --> 00:09:13,822
- It's breath.
- But looks like smoke.

190
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,950
You really like that?

191
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,902
- I just told you I like it.
- Yeah, all right.

192
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,267
- I thought it was good.
- Really?

193
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:19,362
It was good.

194
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,805
We should go out for a drink, you guys.

195
00:09:22,242 --> 00:09:24,403
Larry, probably not, right?

196
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,179
You have a big day tomorrow.
He has to get his sleep.

197
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:29,545
What you got going on tomorrow?

198
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,176
Nothing, I'm just sitting around.
I'm not doing anything.

199
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:36,315
<i>- I don't have a big...</i>
- We're tired, too.

200
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:38,880
Tomorrow, I'm sitting around.
I'm not doing anything.

201
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,084
Sitting around?

202
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,524
Listen, thank you for coming.

203
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:43,459
- Hey, great job again.
- Hope you liked it.

204
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:44,553
Bye.

205
00:09:45,965 --> 00:09:48,559
- I want to see those pictures.
- I'll get you the pictures.

206
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:51,763
And everything was perfect.
You should feel so proud.

207
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:54,398
Are you happy? It was really great.

208
00:09:57,143 --> 00:10:01,546
Yeah, I loved it. Honestly, I did.
I thought it was really good.

209
00:10:01,614 --> 00:10:03,605
- Who are you talking to?
- Wanda.

210
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,745
No, it was really good.

211
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:11,222
I loved every minute,
and then I look over and Larry's yawning.

212
00:10:11,324 --> 00:10:12,348
What? I...

213
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:13,949
He invited us to this movie.

214
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:18,464
<i>I wasn't bored. I was yawning because...</i>
Can't somebody be tired and yawn?

215
00:10:18,531 --> 00:10:20,260
I mean it's a biological function.

216
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:24,201
- He invited us to that screening.
- Doesn't necessarily mean you're bored.

217
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,862
I thought it was rude.

218
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,169
I thought it was. And, of course...

219
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:29,367
Really rude.

220
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:33,401
You know who Cliff is? Cliff Cobb.
Yeah, that cute guy in the wheelchair.

221
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:35,640
So we're in the lobby
and we're talking to him...

222
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,980
and everyone's congratulating him
and he's having this great night...

223
00:10:39,052 --> 00:10:40,986
and he asks Larry
what he's doing tomorrow...

224
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:44,023
and Larry says that he's just sitting around.

225
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:47,182
Instead of just telling him
<i>he's playing golf...</i>

226
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,854
He can't say he's playing golf...

227
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:51,624
he tells him that he's gonna sit around.

228
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:55,031
'Cause I don't wanna make him feel bad.
Why should I say I'm going out?

229
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:57,365
If I was handicapped,
I'd want people to tell me...

230
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:58,699
that they're sitting around.

231
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:01,433
"Oh, I'm going out, going golfing,<i>
or horseback riding..."</i>

232
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,566
You feel good that you're lying to him?

233
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:06,806
If I was playing checkers,
I'd have told him I was playing checkers.

234
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,712
- He was trying to make Cliff feel good.
- That's a good thing.

235
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:12,478
Why'd you tell the other guy
that you're not playing golf?

236
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:14,986
Because Cliff was right next to me...

237
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:18,546
so I didn't want Cliff to hear
that I'm playing golf.

238
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:21,559
I don't want to play
with that guy anyway to tell you the truth.

239
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:22,992
I won't play golf with that guy.

240
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:25,155
He's out of his mind!

241
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:28,666
I know, he thinks
he's doing a really good thing.

242
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:34,267
Yeah, absolutely. Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

243
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,602
Trick or treat.

244
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:38,004
Happy Halloween.

245
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:40,245
Festive?

246
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:42,913
Hey, very nice, you're going golfing?

247
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:44,882
Yeah, actually.

248
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:46,714
- You look very snazzy.
- Yeah?

249
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,947
This is a good look on you. I like it.

250
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:52,856
Thank you. I don't tuck in that much.
Golf makes me tuck in.

251
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:55,723
- You look good tucked in.
- I'm rarely tucked in.

252
00:11:55,895 --> 00:11:56,900
Any messages?

253
00:11:56,963 --> 00:12:00,091
Your therapist called. They wanna move
your appointment up an hour.

254
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,794
So please call them.
And Shelley Cobb called.

255
00:12:04,337 --> 00:12:06,805
Hey, the bracelet might be ready.

256
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:09,167
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

257
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:12,040
Cheryl is gonna flip out
when she gets this thing.

258
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,170
I wish I could videotape this reaction.

259
00:12:14,247 --> 00:12:16,545
But I don't know how to work
a video camera.

260
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:19,676
I mean, it really took some time
to do this thing, too.

261
00:12:21,954 --> 00:12:24,149
- Here's what I want you to do.
- Okay.

262
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:28,284
I want you to go on the Internet
and get some information for me...

263
00:12:29,028 --> 00:12:30,586
on the Cobb salad.

264
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:33,223
<i>Who invented it, where it comes from...</i>

265
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:34,789
Okay, I'll get on that right now.

266
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:38,166
- All right. See what you can find out.
- Right away.

267
00:12:39,305 --> 00:12:41,603
Shelley. Hi, it's Larry.

268
00:12:44,077 --> 00:12:45,738
Yeah, a lot of fun.

269
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:48,337
And again,
tell Cliff how much we enjoyed it.

270
00:12:48,414 --> 00:12:51,212
That was really a good piece of work there.

271
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:55,249
Yeah. Okay.

272
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:57,915
We should go out. I'll talk to Cheryl.

273
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:04,225
Just you and me?

274
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,200
Oh, my God.

275
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,764
<i>Shelley, no. That was...</i>

276
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,867
No, that was just a joke
because they were talking so much.

277
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:20,435
It was like a joke for their benefit.

278
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:24,110
Oh, my God, no.

279
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:27,277
No. That was just an arm.
I was just stretching my arm.

280
00:13:27,353 --> 00:13:29,947
<i>That didn't... Oh, no, Shelley.</i>

281
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,784
No, Shelley, of course not!

282
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:35,655
<i>Shelley, you don't...</i>

283
00:13:35,728 --> 00:13:37,696
But no, that's not true!

284
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:41,525
But what about the bracelet? Shelley!

285
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:50,969
Larry? Is everything okay?

286
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,703
- The salad stuff?
- Yeah.

287
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:59,240
"The Cobb salad was created at<i>
the legendary Brown Derby in Hollywood."</i>

288
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:02,344
The owner, Bob Cobb,
was hungry one night.

289
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:04,582
In the middle of the night,
he went downstairs...

290
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,124
and he came up with it.

291
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:09,161
It wasn't the Drake Hotel in Chicago?

292
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,219
No, it was in Hollywood.
<i>You remember that...</i>

293
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,764
Let me see that.

294
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,296
- Created at the Brown Derby in Hollywood.
- Right.

295
00:14:20,439 --> 00:14:24,102
My friend Cliff Cobb lied to me
about the Cobb salad!

296
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:28,310
His grandfather didn't invent it.

297
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,244
Bob Cobb did!

298
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:39,147
- Trick or treat!
- Look at you.

299
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,059
There you go.

300
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:42,720
Bye.

301
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:48,697
Those kids are really cute.
You wanna do some?

302
00:14:49,168 --> 00:14:51,398
- You wanna switch?
- Yeah, you can do some.

303
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,562
Okay.

304
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:55,198
Well, let me just do a few more bags.

305
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,003
<i>You keep up the...</i>

306
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:59,675
You do a few and then we'll switch.

307
00:15:00,613 --> 00:15:02,137
Trick or treat.

308
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:06,175
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

309
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,545
- Thirteen?
- Yeah.

310
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:12,253
You look more like 16 or maybe even 17.

311
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,657
- No, we're 13.
- Can we just have our candy, please?

312
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:16,251
Where's your costumes?

313
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:18,194
I'm being my sister. This is my costume.

314
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,391
- I'm a teacher.
- You're a teacher.

315
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:23,230
Wow, I would like to get my seat
in your class.

316
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,865
- You got candy?
- Hello.

317
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:27,872
Yeah, I don't think so.

318
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:29,564
- You kidding?
- It's Halloween.

319
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:33,203
Yeah, I know. Doesn't mean you're entitled
to go around to people's homes...

320
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,405
and bilk them out of candy.

321
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,572
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah.

322
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:37,582
Asshole! Fuck you!

323
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:47,952
Shit.

324
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,027
Can you believe this?

325
00:15:57,637 --> 00:15:59,332
Those girls.

326
00:15:59,405 --> 00:16:02,306
Yeah, why would they do
something like that?

327
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:05,410
Because I didn't give them candy,
that's why.

328
00:16:05,478 --> 00:16:08,140
You're standing at the door
with a bowl of candy.

329
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:09,272
Why can't you...

330
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:12,215
Because I don't think 17-year-old girls
<i>with no costume on...</i>

331
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,981
<i>- You shouldn't be allowed...</i>
- Who cares?

332
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:17,181
They were just using Halloween
to get candy!

333
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:20,282
Who cares?
It's Halloween, just give them candy.

334
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:23,192
You just use the holiday
for your own selfish purposes?

335
00:16:23,262 --> 00:16:26,720
So what? So you'd rather have them
toilet-paper your house?

336
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,165
I didn't know that it was gonna be<i>
"felony or treat."</i>

337
00:16:29,235 --> 00:16:31,669
I didn't think the trick extended to felony.

338
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:34,535
Why would it kill you
to just give them a few pieces of candy?

339
00:16:34,607 --> 00:16:35,835
I don't understand that.

340
00:16:35,908 --> 00:16:38,103
Because there's gotta be
some kind of cut-offs...

341
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:41,078
- for Halloween to work.
- What is it with you and your cut-offs?

342
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:44,082
And your "shouldn't there be"
and "should there be"? Who cares?

343
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,243
Trick-or-treating at 40?

344
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:50,119
Free candy, I'm 40 years old,
I want free candy!

345
00:16:50,189 --> 00:16:52,316
Not everybody knows your rules.

346
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:55,724
You got a set of rules and you think
everyone's gonna adhere to them...

347
00:16:55,795 --> 00:16:57,888
but they're not,
because nobody knows them.

348
00:16:57,963 --> 00:17:00,488
You have a long day of cleaning
ahead of you.

349
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:01,965
I'm gonna clean it up by myself?

350
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:04,832
You're gonna clean this up by yourself.
Whose fault is this?

351
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,633
I'm gonna call the police.

352
00:17:10,242 --> 00:17:11,266
So they had no costumes?

353
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,973
Right, they had no costumes,
and for some reason, that really upset him.

354
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,639
You sure there were no costumes?

355
00:17:16,716 --> 00:17:19,150
'Cause sometimes
they can be very subtle costumes.

356
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,686
No they weren't subtle at all.
There were no costumes.

357
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,985
They were just going around
from house to house for candy.

358
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:28,993
Is it possible to find these girls
and maybe talk to their parents?

359
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:33,123
By your descriptions,
<i>"dark hair, 20 years old"...</i>

360
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:36,600
I mean, there's 10,000 kids
who could fit that description.

361
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:39,968
It was sort of Elvira-ish.
She looked like Elvira.

362
00:17:40,106 --> 00:17:43,075
So she was kind of
in a little bit of costume there.

363
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,370
The Elvira thing.

364
00:17:44,443 --> 00:17:45,808
No, that wasn't a costume.

365
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:48,210
I'm just using Elvira to describe her.
That's all.

366
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,111
<i>It's just a way to... It's a shorthand.</i>

367
00:17:50,182 --> 00:17:52,650
They knocked on the door,
they said, "Trick or treat"?

368
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:54,481
- Yeah.
- And you had treats.

369
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:55,600
Yes.

370
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:57,054
I was giving out candy all night.

371
00:17:57,123 --> 00:18:00,115
But I don't have to give them candy,
they don't deserve candy...

372
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:02,092
<i>and I don't deserve this. "Bald asshole"?</i>

373
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,288
That's a hate crime.
We're a set, we're a group.

374
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:06,422
You can't call us bald assholes.

375
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:09,093
What if I were gay?
Would that be "gay asshole"?

376
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:10,533
That's a hate crime.

377
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:12,696
<i>But it says "bald asshole."</i>

378
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,902
But we consider ourselves
a group of people.

379
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:18,739
Sir, I'm bald, I'm not offended.

380
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,746
With all due respect, Officer Byrd,
you are not bald.

381
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:23,748
You have chosen to shave your hair.

382
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:26,182
That's a look you're cultivating
to be fashionable...

383
00:18:26,252 --> 00:18:30,313
and we don't consider you part of the
bald community. With all due respect.

384
00:18:31,323 --> 00:18:34,952
Did they threaten you in any way?
Did you see weapons of any kind?

385
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:38,087
No, there was no threat,
except for the "trick" threat.

386
00:18:38,164 --> 00:18:41,133
- What's the trick threat?
- The trick or treat.

387
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,134
<i>"No treat? Trick."</i>

388
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:45,870
It's a threat.
How far can you take these tricks?

389
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:48,532
- If it was any other night...
- Trick or treat, bang-bang!

390
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:52,509
But it's trick or treat.
We cut the kids a little slack on Halloween.

391
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:56,344
It's kind of a social contract you enter
when you open that door.

392
00:18:56,415 --> 00:19:00,442
They say, "Trick or treat,"
I would advise you, give the treat.

393
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,189
Why don't you give them the candy
next time, Larry?

394
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:08,250
I will not be intimidated. Even on Halloween.

395
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:25,971
Are you playing golf?

396
00:19:26,345 --> 00:19:28,438
Today? No, I played yesterday.

397
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:30,914
What are you doing dressed like that?

398
00:19:31,083 --> 00:19:34,280
I like the outfit. I like the way it looks.

399
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,613
<i>Yeah, but it's a golf outfit. It's sort of...</i>

400
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:39,783
Doesn't have to be just golf.
You can't walk around? It's a shirt.

401
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:42,225
- It looks good on you.
- That's what people tell me.

402
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,159
<i>- So maybe...</i>
- People are right.

403
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,959
Wanna play tomorrow?

404
00:19:46,332 --> 00:19:50,291
I actually can't. It's Cheryl's birthday.

405
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:52,097
<i>So...</i>

406
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:53,737
And why can't you?

407
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:56,866
Don't I have to spend her birthday with her
or something?

408
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:59,502
Early in the morning, what does it matter?
Is she a baby?

409
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:01,910
How old is she, 5 or 6 years old?

410
00:20:03,716 --> 00:20:06,184
- Maybe you're right.
- You're taking her out for dinner.

411
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:08,550
Yeah, I don't have to chained to her
the whole day.

412
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:11,055
- Why can't we play golf?
- I'll come by in the morning.

413
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:12,715
I haven't seen the house yet, anyhow.

414
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:14,759
Great. We'll play. You're on for tomorrow.

415
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:17,057
<i>- Not a religious holiday...</i>
- No.

416
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:21,260
Let's talk about the Jason Alexander thing.

417
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,561
What's going on?

418
00:20:22,635 --> 00:20:25,695
I'm done with it. It's over.

419
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:28,805
He didn't wanna drive to your office
and the whole thing's off?

420
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:31,707
I went to his office twice,
he never came to mine.

421
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:35,713
<i>This is just... Excuse my language,</i>
this is completely fucked.

422
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:38,848
It's too bad. It was a great idea.

423
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,589
I heard that Julia is looking for a project.

424
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:49,059
And if you ask me,
you can do the exact same project with her.

425
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,220
Actually...

426
00:20:55,901 --> 00:20:57,801
it could really work with her.

427
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:00,663
She does have the exact same problem
with Elaine.

428
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:03,731
People always see her as Elaine.
They just want her to do Elaine.

429
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,004
<i>All I got to do... It's the same thing.</i>

430
00:21:06,078 --> 00:21:08,774
And I know she's been looking for a show.

431
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:12,779
- I'm gonna call Julia.
- Great.

432
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:22,559
Larry. Gotta quit meeting like this.

433
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,089
So, can I ask you something?

434
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,727
- How's the golf?
- I didn't play golf, Donald.

435
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:32,737
<i>"I don't play golf." Look at that shirt.</i>

436
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:34,705
I'm just wearing a shirt. I like this shirt.

437
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:37,435
Nobody wears a shirt like that
unless they're gonna golf.

438
00:21:37,509 --> 00:21:40,637
I like this shirt.
I get a lot of compliments on this outfit.

439
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,079
Fine, if that's the way it's gonna be, so be it.

440
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:45,878
No, it's not the way it's gonna be.
I like the clothes.

441
00:21:45,951 --> 00:21:48,249
You don't have to just wear them
on the golf course.

442
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,378
You're sick.

443
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:51,446
<i>You can wear clothes, these clothes don't...</i>

444
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:52,581
Stop it.

445
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:06,365
Shelley?

446
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:27,185
Shelley's not here.

447
00:22:27,926 --> 00:22:30,258
- Hey, Cliff.
- What are you doing?

448
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:34,121
I need the bracelet that she made for me.

449
00:22:34,466 --> 00:22:36,730
Yeah, the bracelet.

450
00:22:36,969 --> 00:22:38,960
Yeah, it's my wife's
<i>birthday tomorrow. So...</i>

451
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:40,596
Yeah, yeah, your wife's birthday.

452
00:22:40,673 --> 00:22:42,538
Forget the bracelet, Larry.

453
00:22:42,608 --> 00:22:46,169
There isn't gonna be any bracelet.
No bracelet, I know what's going on.

454
00:22:46,245 --> 00:22:48,543
- You know what's going on.
- I know what's going on.

455
00:22:48,614 --> 00:22:50,172
You think I don't have eyes?

456
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:53,343
I'm not blind. Get it straight, all right?
My eyes work.

457
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:56,877
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

458
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:59,986
I'm talking about the little knee game
with Shelley.

459
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,755
I'm talking about the arm over the neck.
You're busted.

460
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:04,056
Oh, yeah, I'm busted.

461
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,064
She told me in the restaurant,
you propositioned her.

462
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,327
I was joking around at the table, okay?

463
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,665
And she probably took me seriously.

464
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:14,228
She did take it seriously,
I'm taking it seriously, too.

465
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:16,706
I was joking around
'cause you guys were talking...

466
00:23:16,775 --> 00:23:18,936
and I wanted to see
if you were paying attention.

467
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:20,376
You didn't even hear me say that.

468
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:24,041
So that's how friends joke around.
One friend jokes with the other friend.

469
00:23:24,116 --> 00:23:27,643
<i>"Let me ask his wife to screw me."</i>
That's how you joke around?

470
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,688
Wait a second.
What the hell are you wearing?

471
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:31,620
- What?
- Those are golf clothes.

472
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,181
- I didn't golf today.
- You said you weren't golfing.

473
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:37,194
- Why are you wearing those clothes?
- I like the way they look.

474
00:23:37,262 --> 00:23:39,321
You expect me to believe that?

475
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,263
Yeah, they look good.
People compliment me.

476
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,301
- They don't look good!
- I'm tucking in now!

477
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:45,632
I can see. You're a liar, man!

478
00:23:45,704 --> 00:23:48,605
- I'm a liar?
- You're a two-faced, backstabbing liar.

479
00:23:48,674 --> 00:23:50,403
I'm just realizing this now.

480
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:53,502
- It's all coming crystal clear now?
- Yeah.

481
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:57,811
I'm the guy who goes around
telling people...

482
00:23:57,883 --> 00:24:01,876
that "my grandfather invented
the Cobb salad"!

483
00:24:01,954 --> 00:24:03,683
- That's true.
- That's me who does that?

484
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:04,780
That's true.

485
00:24:04,857 --> 00:24:09,055
The Cobb salad, my friend,
was invented in 1937...

486
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:12,996
by Bob Cobb at the Brown Derby!

487
00:24:13,065 --> 00:24:15,898
That son of a bitch stole that salad
from my grandfather.

488
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:18,664
- Bullshit!
- And you call my grandfather a liar?

489
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:22,633
You're dead, you son of a bitch!

490
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:26,235
It was invented in 1937...

491
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:29,109
by Bob Cobb
in the Brown Derby Restaurant.

492
00:24:29,248 --> 00:24:32,240
What's he gonna say?
I had him dead to rights.

493
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,488
Oh, my God. I gotta call you back.

494
00:24:41,093 --> 00:24:42,321
Hey, Elvira.

495
00:24:42,394 --> 00:24:45,989
Some fucking weirdo is trying to talk to me.
I'll call you back.

496
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:48,089
- Hey, Elvira!
- What the fuck do you want?

497
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:51,432
"What the fuck"? That's some language
for a 13-year-old girl.

498
00:24:51,503 --> 00:24:54,597
- Impressive?
- Very impressive. Yes.

499
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:56,734
Did you have a good time last night?

500
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:58,936
Yeah? I'd like to talk to your parents.

501
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,501
- They're not home.
- They're not home?

502
00:25:00,579 --> 00:25:03,309
No, they're not.
Can I help you with anything?

503
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:05,907
I suspect they are.
Or you wouldn't be out here smoking.

504
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:08,145
- No, I have respect for the household.
- Do you?

505
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,619
Yeah, I'll bet you do.

506
00:25:09,688 --> 00:25:11,155
Larry David!

507
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:14,617
What brings you to our Jewish home?

508
00:25:14,693 --> 00:25:17,958
Well, well, now it all makes perfect sense.

509
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,191
- What makes perfect sense?
- This is your daughter.

510
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:22,165
Yes, this is my daughter.

511
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:25,795
I think you might be interested in knowing
that your daughter, last night...

512
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:29,204
threw eggs at my house,
papered my house with toilet paper...

513
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:30,673
wrote "bald asshole" on my door.

514
00:25:30,742 --> 00:25:31,766
Bullshit.

515
00:25:31,844 --> 00:25:34,438
<i>Threw eggs at his house and put...</i>

516
00:25:34,513 --> 00:25:36,003
- No, she says no.
- He's crazy.

517
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:38,049
- She's a liar.
- She's not a liar.

518
00:25:38,116 --> 00:25:41,210
No, you're a liar.
You're a liar as a human being.

519
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:43,345
- Here we go.
- I heard about Cliff and his wife.

520
00:25:43,422 --> 00:25:44,446
Did you?

521
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:46,718
I heard about you
trying to sleep around with her.

522
00:25:46,792 --> 00:25:49,056
A disgrace to your people.
That's what you are!

523
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:50,594
The psycho-meter's back on now.

524
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:54,325
Postman! Come here!
Tell the neighborhood!

525
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:57,300
<i>What a shanda Larry David is.</i>

526
00:25:57,936 --> 00:26:02,202
Not only are you a lousy Jew,
but you're a lousy human being!

527
00:26:02,274 --> 00:26:06,711
He screws the wife of a man in a wheelchair!

528
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:07,972
<i>A shanda!</i>

529
00:26:08,046 --> 00:26:10,446
Maybe you should have given me
some candy!

530
00:26:10,515 --> 00:26:12,278
You're a lousy Jew!

531
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,479
Oh, my God!

532
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:46,373
Happy birthday.

533
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,215
Larry!

534
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:14,441
<i>- Get out. I'll...</i>
- What's going on?

535
00:27:14,513 --> 00:27:16,378
I'll meet you. Wait outside.

536
00:27:16,448 --> 00:27:17,813
Happy birthday.

537
00:27:18,483 --> 00:27:20,542
I forgot. We were supposed to play golf.

538
00:27:20,619 --> 00:27:22,678
You can't play golf today.

539
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:26,618
- It's my birthday.
- I made a plan with him.

540
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:29,655
- You need to get rid of him.
- Okay, all right.

541
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:31,820
We're supposed to be on the tee
in 10 minutes.

542
00:27:31,897 --> 00:27:34,161
Don't you knock before you come in?

543
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:36,223
I did knock. I've been knocking for a while.

544
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:37,393
Okay, quiet.

545
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:38,527
What's going on?

546
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:42,403
That woman didn't give me the bracelet,
so I had to come up with something.

547
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:44,999
- I came up with this.
- That's nice.

548
00:27:45,978 --> 00:27:47,067
No.

549
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:48,704
I can't do it.

550
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,008
You know what I went through?

551
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:53,381
You have any idea what it takes
for me to take a day off?

552
00:27:53,452 --> 00:27:55,113
Do you have any idea?

553
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:58,516
What? Come on!

554
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,615
Maybe I can play nine. Hold on.

555
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:03,456
- Can I play nine?
- No, come on.

556
00:28:03,895 --> 00:28:05,385
I can't do it.

557
00:28:05,897 --> 00:28:07,524
Come on, just go.

558
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:13,866
How about six?
