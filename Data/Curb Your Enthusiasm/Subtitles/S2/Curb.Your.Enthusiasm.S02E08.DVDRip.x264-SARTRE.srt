1
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:18,029
Spencer is too adorable.
Totally adorable.

2
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:19,429
Jill, how old is he now?

3
00:00:19,499 --> 00:00:21,933
<i>- He's 14 months.</i>
- So cute.

4
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:26,405
<i>They grow so fast, it's amazing.</i>
<i>You have them and it's instant.</i>

5
00:00:26,473 --> 00:00:30,273
<i>- It's instantaneous growth.</i>
- Look at this tiny little broccoli here.

6
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:32,471
<i>Where's the bottom of the broccoli?</i>

7
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:35,538
Can somebody tell me what they did
to the bottom of the broccoli?

8
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:37,310
<i>I like the bottom, it's crunchy.</i>

9
00:00:37,384 --> 00:00:39,750
- Right.
- Really?

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:43,221
You know, look at this broccoli,
<i>there's nothing.</i>

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,259
They cut the whole thing off,
<i>there's no bottom.</i>

12
00:00:46,827 --> 00:00:50,160
Is there one person at this table
who can eat cauliflower?

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,529
What is it?
Who put this on earth, this vegetable?

14
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:56,397
Larry, Jeremy has something
he wants to ask you.

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,337
<i>- He's been wanting to ask.</i>
<i>- It's really no big deal.</i>

16
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:02,534
<i>It's, you know, I'm applying for a fellowship.</i>

17
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,669
You want to switch glasses
with me, is that it?

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,347
I like that whole Clark Kent thing
you got happening there.

19
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:12,180
Thanks. It works at the galleries, you know.

20
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:16,689
<i>So I'm applying for a fellowship</i>
<i>at the LA County Museum of Art and...</i>

21
00:01:16,757 --> 00:01:18,725
<i>Yeah, I'm real excited.</i>

22
00:01:18,792 --> 00:01:21,420
But I need a letter of recommendation...

23
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:25,454
and I would absolutely
be indebted to you forever...

24
00:01:25,532 --> 00:01:27,466
if you could do it for me.

25
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:31,834
- I would appreciate it so much.
- I love the indebted part, believe me.

26
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:33,395
<i>Don't get me wrong.</i>

27
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:37,341
<i>You know, I don't really</i>
know that much about art.

28
00:01:37,411 --> 00:01:40,676
But you know about Jeremy.
<i>That's the point, right?</i>

29
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:42,044
And his work, right?

30
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:45,517
<i>- Just that he'd be an asset to the county.</i>
- Absolutely.

31
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:46,984
That seems easy enough.

32
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:48,782
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:52,717
- Sure, okay.
<i>- That'd be great.</i>

34
00:01:52,793 --> 00:01:56,490
- Thank you very much for it. Okay.
<i>- Here's to Larry.</i>

35
00:01:57,964 --> 00:02:00,762
And to the fellowship
<i>that's gonna be, all right?</i>

36
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:03,098
- Yes, absolutely.
- And to the Lakers.

37
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,107
<i>- The Lakers' season starting up tomorrow.</i>
<i>- That's right.</i>

38
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:11,838
<i>You're not a Lakers fan are you?</i>
<i>You're a Knicks fan.</i>

39
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:13,937
<i>- I'm a Knicks fan, yeah.</i>
- Table for one.

40
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:15,606
<i>But I'm going tomorrow night.</i>

41
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,845
My manager has season tickets
right next to the Laker bench.

42
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,184
<i>- He's got the most unbelievable seats.</i>
- Pretty amazing.

43
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:26,089
<i>- That's pretty amazing.</i>
<i>- But you're a Knick fan.</i>

44
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,094
<i>I'll root for the other team.</i>
<i>I can't stand the Lakers, really.</i>

45
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:31,426
- No.
<i>- No, I can't stand them.</i>

46
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:33,398
I get so much satisfaction out of seeing...

47
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,935
19,000 people disappointed
<i>when they lose, I just...</i>

48
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:38,300
Right, when they lose, which is very seldom.

49
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:43,241
Very seldom. I mean, they have Shaq.
Best player that ever lived. End of story.

50
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,872
<i>- I'll be right back.</i>
<i>- I am a sucker for cilantro, I'll tell you.</i>

51
00:02:47,948 --> 00:02:51,679
I had I just need to seize this moment
<i>while Bob's in the bathroom.</i>

52
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:55,152
But, Jeremy and Larry,
<i>for Bob's 40th birthday...</i>

53
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:57,247
what I want to do is to give him...

54
00:02:57,324 --> 00:03:00,157
one of those books
where each person does a page.

55
00:03:00,227 --> 00:03:02,787
- You know what I mean?
- What do you mean, a page?

56
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:06,424
It could be anything you want.
Like, if you would draw something.

57
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,659
You could do an art piece,
and you could write a recollection of Bob...

58
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:13,137
or a poem, or something you can share.

59
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:16,471
Make it funny, would be great,
if you could make it funny.

60
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:20,274
- Great, I would love to do that.
- Thank you, he would love that.

61
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:23,475
<i>- That'd be an honor.</i>
- Larry, would you like to do that?

62
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,383
- A page?
- That would be nice.

63
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:29,047
I mean, I have a limited amount of time.

64
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,716
<i>I've got his letter to write.</i>

65
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,988
<i>You know, Bob's thing</i>
<i>doesn't have to be a big thing.</i>

66
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:38,429
- You could do that, honey.
- Yeah.

67
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:40,659
Really? Good, thank you.

68
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:45,265
<i>Thank you, that'll be great.</i>
<i>Bob's birthday is on Saturday.</i>

69
00:03:45,338 --> 00:03:48,501
So, if I could pick it up around Wednesday.

70
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,311
Does anybody want to split
cheesecake or something?

71
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:55,906
<i>- I'd love dessert.</i>
- Actually, we cannot stay for dessert.

72
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:57,040
What?

73
00:03:57,117 --> 00:04:00,678
My parents came into town,
and I hate to leave them by themselves.

74
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:04,221
- Where are you guys going?
<i>- We're on our way back.</i>

75
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:07,954
- My parents are in town.
<i>- Let's see, you want some...</i>

76
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:11,562
You want some money for this dinner?

77
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:13,496
You want some money for the dinner?

78
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,330
- Yeah.
- Sure.

79
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:18,200
<i>I don't know, how much was this?</i>

80
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:22,173
<i>$60, or what, I don't know, $80?</i>
What did you have?

81
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:24,005
I mean, we just had some turkey.

82
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:27,137
What did we have,
turkey and a glass of wine?

83
00:04:27,213 --> 00:04:29,807
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>what to put down here. I mean, I'm...</i>

84
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:32,977
<i>$90, how's that, is that good? Is $90 good?</i>

85
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,755
$110?

86
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:42,186
<i>$115, what'd you have?</i>

87
00:04:42,262 --> 00:04:45,857
Chicken and turkey
and a glass... I got $115, is that cool?

88
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,423
- All right, bye, you guys.
- Bye, Cheryl.

89
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,735
Thanks for coming out.

90
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:56,105
<i>- Larry, aren't you gonna say goodbye?</i>
<i>- Yeah, of course I'm gonna say goodbye.</i>

91
00:04:56,876 --> 00:05:00,004
- All right, bye you guys.
- I was gonna say goodbye.

92
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,049
- Drive safe, okay?
- I left $115.

93
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:07,282
I go out to dinner, I wind up
with a homework assignment.

94
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:10,551
What was all that goodbye business?
That was really embarrassing.

95
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,819
I wanted to remind you to say goodbye.

96
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:15,656
<i>I was gonna say goodbye, I'm not a moron.</i>
I know how to-

97
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:16,855
<i>- Sometimes you don't.</i>
- What?

98
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,955
Sometimes you forget
to say goodbye to people.

99
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:22,024
I forget to say goodbye?
Never in my life have I forgotten.

100
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:25,503
Yes, you have. Then people think
<i>that you're doing it intentionally.</i>

101
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:29,702
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>
You know how much I paid for that dinner?

102
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:32,745
I just kept putting money down.
<i>Why didn't they stop me?</i>

103
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:36,145
- Why did you keep putting money down?
<i>- Because they didn't stop me.</i>

104
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:38,878
- Thank you.
<i>- You didn't have to put in that much.</i>

105
00:05:38,952 --> 00:05:41,682
<i>I kept saying, "Is that enough?" $80, $90.</i>

106
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:46,317
I hope my parents found something to eat.
<i>I didn't even think about that.</i>

107
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:50,420
- How long are they staying for, anyway?
<i>- They're staying till next week...</i>

108
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:53,364
when we go to Monterey
<i>for Becky's wedding.</i>

109
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:57,402
<i>- It doesn't work because that-</i>
- Okay, all right!

110
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,405
- I think they mean normally.
- Okay, but then I want Arabia.

111
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,735
We already settled that.

112
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:03,867
<i>- It's not a country.</i>
- It is a country.

113
00:06:03,943 --> 00:06:06,173
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

114
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:10,012
- Is Arabia a country?
<i>- Arabia? No, it's Saudi Arabia.</i>

115
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,551
<i>You don't know what the hell</i>
<i>you're talking about...</i>

116
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:14,951
<i>"Mr. Expert in somebody else's field."</i>

117
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,852
What are you guys playing, Scattergories?

118
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:18,447
- Yeah.
- Can I play?

119
00:06:18,525 --> 00:06:20,993
<i>Hope you don't mind, we raided your games.</i>

120
00:06:21,061 --> 00:06:23,791
<i>- No, I don't care.</i>
<i>- No, we haven't played this-</i>

121
00:06:23,863 --> 00:06:25,125
And your liquor.

122
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,461
You wanna play a quick round
of Scattergories?

123
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:32,164
<i>- No, I'm gonna go up.</i>
- Yeah, thank you, Captain Geography.

124
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:35,473
<i>Larry, don't you say goodnight?</i>

125
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,440
Goodnight, sorry.

126
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,773
Goodnight.

127
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,040
<i>Okay, "J," five, go!</i>

128
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:47,678
<i>Ohio State, that's a college with an "O."</i>

129
00:06:47,754 --> 00:06:51,053
<i>For heaven's sake.</i>
Give me time, I want to do it, too.

130
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,490
- Gosh!
- Occidental!

131
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:00,897
Occidental.

132
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,265
<i>Honey, please don't yell</i>
at my parents like that.

133
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,964
<i>- I wasn't yelling, I was helping.</i>
- Angel.

134
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,167
<i>- They're not real, though.</i>
<i>- So what? They're in the sky.</i>

135
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,012
So what do you know about this page?

136
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,312
Do you know anything about these pages?
Do you paste it on something?

137
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:22,046
What do you know?
<i>She's very vague about the whole thing.</i>

138
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:24,590
What are you supposed to write on it?
She wants a poem?

139
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:28,286
<i>"Something funny," she said.</i>
Is it lined paper?

140
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:31,192
<i>Maybe I'll make little</i>
fancy edges on the end.

141
00:07:31,264 --> 00:07:34,995
<i>Don't they have, like, special scissors</i>
to make those fancy edges on the end?

142
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:37,798
Are you going to be using
your light much longer?

143
00:07:38,104 --> 00:07:40,470
<i>I've been working on my letter, too...</i>

144
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:44,704
to the county museum,
my letter of recommendation.

145
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:46,746
Would you like to hear it?

146
00:07:46,813 --> 00:07:48,906
<i>"Dear LA County Museum.</i>

<i>"and geometric figures</i>

00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:06,060
By the way, I could make those
triangles and those circles.

152
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:09,533
You know, is that art?
I mean, if I could do it, is that art?

00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,569
- Goodnight.

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,028
<i>No. It's stupid.</i>

161
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:37,895
Who are you going to dinner with?

162
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:41,297
- What situation did you put yourself in?
<i>- It's all our friends.</i>

163
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,336
<i>Listen, I can't go to the Laker game tonight.</i>

164
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:47,965
- Really?
<i>- Yeah, Susie's gotta go to New York...</i>

165
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,373
<i>'cause her mom's sick,</i>
and I gotta watch the kid.

166
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:53,742
My gosh, so what are you gonna do?
<i>Who's getting the ticket?</i>

167
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,804
<i>Why don't you give it to Lewis?</i>

168
00:08:55,949 --> 00:08:57,712
- Sure.
- Go with him.

169
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,150
- Jeffy, how are you?
- Al, how are you doing?

170
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,517
Good to see you, how are you?

171
00:09:01,588 --> 00:09:04,182
Good, Albert Mayo, Larry David,
Larry David, Albert Mayo.

172
00:09:04,257 --> 00:09:05,451
Nice to meet you.

173
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:07,652
<i>- Shaq's agent.</i>
- No kidding?

174
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:09,092
<i>I'm going to the game tonight.</i>

175
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:10,595
- Are you really?
- I got his seats.

176
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:13,826
<i>You're going to love...</i>
<i>You're the Seinfeld guy, right?</i>

177
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:16,365
- Yeah.
- Shaq loves your show.

178
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,870
- Really?
- Yeah, loves it.

179
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:22,567
I gotta run, I gotta get to the Center.
Enjoy the game, have a good time.

180
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,872
- It was great to meet you.
- Did you play anything?

181
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:27,913
- Yeah, I won $300 off Doc Wiggins.
- Beautiful, see you later.

182
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,972
- Bye-bye.
<i>- I'll see you tonight.</i>

183
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,177
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Just one favor.

184
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:35,551
Just look at this thing on my back.

185
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:38,785
- What is that?
- What do you think that is?

186
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:42,259
<i>I don't know what that is.</i>
You know, you ought to go to a doctor.

187
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,296
- Really?
- Yeah.

188
00:09:44,364 --> 00:09:46,161
You know that guy right over there?

189
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:48,564
<i>That's Dr. Wiggins,</i>
<i>that's who he was talking about.</i>

190
00:09:48,635 --> 00:09:52,537
<i>- He's the Lakers' doctor, go ask him.</i>
<i>- But he's an orthopedic, right?</i>

191
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:55,130
They gotta know all the stuff.
He can look at it and go:

192
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,675
<i>"That's something or nothing."</i>

193
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:59,337
<i>If he tells you it's nothing</i>
<i>to worry about, you're fine.</i>

194
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:02,404
<i>- I'm gonna go hit some balls.</i>
<i>- I'll see you at the range.</i>

195
00:10:05,985 --> 00:10:07,850
Dr. Wiggins?

196
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:09,684
- How you doing?
- Good.

197
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,321
<i>I'm sorry to bother you with this.</i>

198
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:16,487
I got a little thing on my back,
and I was hoping...

199
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:19,292
you could save me
a visit to a dermatologist.

200
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,856
<i>I'm sorry, I'm running a little late.</i>

201
00:10:21,935 --> 00:10:24,699
<i>It'll only take a second, take quick look at it.</i>

202
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:27,331
<i>I'm sure it's nothing,</i>
and you could just tell me if-

203
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:30,035
You can make an appointment
and just come to the office.

204
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:33,567
<i>- I'll be happy to look at it there.</i>
- I mean, it would just take a second.

205
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,807
Just say is it something or nothing,
or, you know.

206
00:10:35,882 --> 00:10:39,579
<i>- It's like looking at your watch, really.</i>
- What do you do for a living?

207
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:42,587
<i>- I'm a writer.</i>
<i>- Next time you're in a big hurry...</i>

208
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,590
<i>why don't you write me</i>
a bunch of shit for free?

209
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:58,661
All he had to do was take a look at it.
Would it have killed him?

210
00:10:58,738 --> 00:11:00,103
- The doctor?
- Yeah, the doctor.

211
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,800
<i>- What's the big deal?</i>
- Come on, man.

212
00:11:01,874 --> 00:11:02,966
<i>He's in the locker room.</i>

213
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:05,806
<i>All he's gotta do is take one quick look,</i>
take five seconds.

214
00:11:05,878 --> 00:11:07,106
How you doing?

215
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,580
Man, I mean,
<i>the guy's trying to relax like you.</i>

216
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:11,241
You gotta give the guy space.

217
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:13,945
- Look at this.
- How are you doing today?

218
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,318
- Good.
- Let me show you to your seats.

219
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:19,358
<i>- This'll be his and this'll be yours.</i>
- These two, right here?

220
00:11:19,425 --> 00:11:21,154
Come on, enjoy the game.

221
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:25,119
- My God.
- Look at this, how great is this?

222
00:11:25,198 --> 00:11:29,294
- Holy cow.
- Great, right? How great is this?

223
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:32,566
- Is this fucking unbelievable?
- This is unbelievable.

224
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:36,369
This is, you know, we have a great manager.
What can I tell you?

225
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:40,469
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>your Los Angeles Lakers.</i>

226
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:42,946
<i>You've got the best seat</i>
in the house, you know that?

227
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,951
You do.
The bench is right over here, look at this.

228
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,249
You know, I can hear
<i>everything Jackson's saying?</i>

229
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:50,186
<i>I'll tell you what he said.</i>

230
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,800
<i>Shaquille O'Neal.</i>

231
00:12:09,342 --> 00:12:11,606
<i>Anthony Peeler, two shots.</i>

232
00:12:11,677 --> 00:12:14,578
<i>What's he doing?</i>
<i>Why doesn't he put Shaq back in the game?</i>

233
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,774
<i>- It's ridiculous.</i>
- Who, Coach Jackson?

234
00:12:16,849 --> 00:12:20,410
<i>Yeah, I'll ask him, with his eight rings,</i>
<i>that Larry David's upset.</i>

235
00:12:20,486 --> 00:12:23,216
<i>He's been out of the game for five minutes.</i>

236
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:26,122
<i>Maybe he's upset.</i>
<i>Maybe, you know, he's tired.</i>

237
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:32,958
My God.

238
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,460
Idiot, what did you do?

239
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,936
<i>- God, I'm so...</i>
- What did you do?

240
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:43,101
<i>- Are you okay? I'm so sorry.</i>
- Here, give us some room here, stand back.

241
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,576
Take it easy. Where is it?

242
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:47,840
- My knee.
- Your knee?

243
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,745
- My knee.
- Okay, easy.

244
00:12:49,816 --> 00:12:51,044
Look at this shit.

245
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:53,551
<i>It's not an assassination attempt,</i>
<i>for Christ's sake.</i>

246
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:55,951
- Can you straighten it, Shaq?
- No.

247
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,820
- Can you put any weight on it?
- Larry, how did that happen?

248
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:01,359
<i>I don't know, I stuck my legs out.</i>
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

249
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:04,328
<i>Let's get him up,</i>
<i>I'll hold the leg, get him up. Get him up.</i>

250
00:13:04,397 --> 00:13:08,595
<i>- I'm so sorry.</i>
- Can you put any weight on it?

251
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:09,862
No.

252
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:14,796
It was an accident.

253
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:20,838
- Just sit down.
- It was an accident!

254
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:24,240
This is a nightmare.

255
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:26,615
I think we should get going.
<i>I'm very uncomfortable.</i>

256
00:13:26,686 --> 00:13:29,814
<i>- I'm fucking out of here.</i>
<i>- Let's get out of here, come on.</i>

257
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,418
Just go.

258
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:35,757
Go. Get out of here, go ahead, hurry up.

259
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:37,591
It was an accident.

260
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,965
- Take a hike.
- It was an accident.

261
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:49,866
Yeah, no, believe me, Julie, I saw it.
I saw him on the news.

262
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:52,308
I saw the whole thing, and he just walked in.

263
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:55,609
<i>I can't talk right now.</i>
<i>I'll talk to you later. Okay.</i>

264
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:58,845
- My God!
- What news? You saw me on the news?

265
00:13:58,918 --> 00:14:00,749
- Yeah, of course I did.
- Me?

266
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,449
<i>They said you tripped Shaquille O'Neal,</i>
<i>now he'll be out for two months.</i>

267
00:14:04,524 --> 00:14:06,617
You mean I tripped him?
They said Larry David?

268
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:09,388
They have a close-up of you.
They have it in slow motion.

269
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:11,726
They have,<i>
"Larry David took out Shaquille O'Neal."</i>

270
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,628
<i>For two months he's gonna be out.</i>

271
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,624
And the phone will not stop ringing.

272
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,692
Could you please take this
to the next room...

273
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,260
so that we can just watch our show?

274
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:20,862
Look, can we call you back tomorrow?

275
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,306
<i>- It's just so hectic.</i>
- Two months?

276
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:24,604
<i>He's gonna be out two months?</i>

277
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,736
Yeah, two months. And not only that...

278
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,370
one of the reporters thinks that...

279
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,745
you had a motive,
<i>because you're a Knicks fan.</i>

280
00:14:30,816 --> 00:14:34,377
Yeah, I did have a motive.
I wanted to kill him, I had a motive.

281
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:39,083
Can you take it outside, please?
How about a little consideration, okay?

282
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:41,182
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

283
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,728
My parents are trying to watch their show.

284
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,367
<i>Don't you say goodnight?</i>

285
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:58,833
Asshole!

286
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:01,809
<i>Yeah, you, it's all your fault!</i>

287
00:15:02,148 --> 00:15:05,174
Yeah, asshole!

288
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,317
What the fuck?

289
00:15:10,656 --> 00:15:11,953
It was an accident.

290
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:14,549
I was just stretching my legs out
and he tripped.

291
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:17,960
They took away my tickets.
The Lakers took away my tickets.

292
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:20,093
- Yeah.
<i>- They can't do that.</i>

293
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,327
<i>Sure they can, it's on the back of the ticket.</i>

294
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:25,302
<i>I'm responsible for whoever sits in my seat.</i>

295
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:29,566
What were you stretching for?
<i>What reason? You're in the first row.</i>

296
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:32,270
- How could you need to stretch?
- I stuck my legs out.

297
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,280
Holy shit, you know
how hard I worked for those?

298
00:15:35,982 --> 00:15:39,543
One game, the first game,
and you fuck the whole thing up!

299
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:41,880
Sorry.

300
00:15:43,856 --> 00:15:45,517
Have a great day.

301
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,156
- Fuck!
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

302
00:15:48,995 --> 00:15:52,158
- What can I do? Can I do anything?
- Buy the team.

303
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:54,896
That would be a help.

304
00:16:05,144 --> 00:16:07,510
- Hey, Chuck.
- Larry, how are you doing?

305
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:10,975
- Okay.
- What happened at the game last night?

306
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,109
I mean, Shaq is coming off the bench...

307
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:16,086
you got your legs stretched out,
I mean, the guy just trips.

308
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:18,988
- It was an accident.
- I know, you got to be careful.

309
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:21,720
<i>You're sitting there,</i>
you know, you see a player coming...

310
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,694
<i>it's a big mountain of a guy.</i>

311
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:26,664
- You got to be able to see him.
- I know, I know.

312
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,927
It was a stupid thing, it was an accident.

313
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:33,062
Yeah, I know. But, I mean, without Shaq,
<i>we can't win this, you know?</i>

314
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:40,142
How much more clear can I be?
No comment.

315
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,338
All right, thank you.

316
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:48,413
<i>You've got a boatload of messages...</i>

317
00:16:48,487 --> 00:16:51,854
<i>and when the phone wasn't ringing,</i>
faxes were coming in.

318
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:55,291
I want to try to get in touch
<i>with Shaquille O'Neal, okay?</i>

319
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:58,262
So find out where he is.
He might be in a hospital.

320
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:00,026
<i>I don't know. But...</i>

321
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,862
<i>Forget it, don't even answer it.</i>

322
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:07,269
<i>I also heard that he's a big Seinfeld fan.</i>
<i>I want to get Seinfeld tapes, if you can.</i>

323
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,774
<i>All the Seinfeld shows, every one.</i>

324
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,200
<i>And I don't know...</i>

325
00:17:12,278 --> 00:17:15,338
Have you ever done
a page in a birthday book?

326
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,551
Yeah, all the magazine shows are calling.
<i>They're gonna do a spread.</i>

327
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:31,221
<i>- I'm going home.</i>
- No goodbye?

328
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,708
Jesus!

329
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:51,877
Oh, man.

330
00:18:05,297 --> 00:18:07,891
<i>Don't leave that in the middle.</i>
I gotta put this in here.

331
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,435
Put it wherever you want to put it.
<i>It's fine with me.</i>

332
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,435
<i>- What's going on?</i>
<i>- We're leaving.</i>

333
00:18:13,806 --> 00:18:15,774
<i>- You're what?</i>
<i>- We're leaving.</i>

334
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:19,209
<i>- It's a little too busy around here for us.</i>
- Too much commotion for us.

335
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,906
<i>- Really, you're going?</i>
<i>- We'll leave you with your chaos.</i>

336
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,312
Holy mackerel.

337
00:18:23,382 --> 00:18:26,476
Mom, I wish you guys
<i>wouldn't leave so soon. I mean...</i>

338
00:18:27,052 --> 00:18:28,917
<i>- It's time, honey.</i>
- Goodbye.

339
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,354
<i>Dad, don't you want to stay</i>
a little bit longer?

340
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,926
All right, I mean, if you reconsider,
you can come back.

341
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:38,691
- Good luck with your telephone.
<i>- That's sad, it's sad.</i>

342
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:44,066
<i>Don't you say goodbye?</i>

343
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:52,474
- They were in a hurry.
<i>- It's a little rude, you know?</i>

344
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,280
Wow! Boy.

345
00:18:56,449 --> 00:18:58,974
- Too much turmoil for them, huh?
- Yeah.

346
00:18:59,752 --> 00:19:03,518
<i>Larry! I'm so glad I caught you at home.</i>

347
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:04,886
<i>I'm so glad.</i>

348
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:09,189
<i>I don't know if you got started on that page</i>
<i>for Bob's birthday book.</i>

349
00:19:09,728 --> 00:19:12,856
<i>You know why? 'Cause I'm not gonna do it.</i>

350
00:19:12,932 --> 00:19:15,799
I just decided it was too overwhelming...

351
00:19:15,868 --> 00:19:17,859
and I thought, get him some cologne.

352
00:19:17,937 --> 00:19:20,428
<i>I've been giving this thing</i>
some thought, you know?

353
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:24,204
<i>- I'm sorry, I feel-</i>
<i>- I was gonna do a basketball with...</i>

354
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:27,336
I was going to forge
<i>some of the Lakers' signatures on it...</i>

355
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:28,573
Really? Well-

356
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:30,911
Yeah, and then I was gonna write
a couple of...

357
00:19:30,983 --> 00:19:33,816
my memories from the two times
<i>we had dinner together...</i>

358
00:19:33,886 --> 00:19:36,787
<i>I feel so bad. I can see that you're upset.</i>

359
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:40,553
I had a beautiful rainbow with
<i>"I love you, Bob," and...</i>

360
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:42,617
<i>Really, that's wonderful.</i>

361
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:47,098
<i>And I'm sure there's some kind of thing</i>
you can develop with it at some point.

362
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,361
How did the other
acquaintances take it, okay?

363
00:19:49,435 --> 00:19:51,426
- You know, they were fine.
- Yeah? Good.

364
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:54,496
They were just fine with it,
you know? Thanks.

365
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:02,176
- Is that Jill?
- Yeah, she...

366
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:06,776
canceled the page in the birthday book.

367
00:20:08,888 --> 00:20:13,086
Nobody wants to have, apparently,
anything to do with me...

368
00:20:13,158 --> 00:20:15,285
<i>because of Shaquille O'Neal.</i>

369
00:20:16,128 --> 00:20:19,996
<i>- That's kind of sad.</i>
- Sad? What are you, crazy?

370
00:20:20,266 --> 00:20:22,700
<i>I'm gonna go to Starbucks</i>
and get some coffee.

371
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:26,602
<i>- Starbucks? Wait, I'll go with you.</i>
- No, I just want to get out of the house.

372
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,230
No.

373
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:33,040
Adora, if anybody wants me,
<i>I'm going to Starbucks!</i>

374
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,144
<i>I'll take a mocha.</i>

375
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,445
<i>And I'll have a vanilla...</i>

376
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:45,280
One of the vanilla bullshit things.

377
00:20:45,357 --> 00:20:47,882
You know, do whatever you want.

378
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,021
Some vanilla bullshit, latte cappa-thing.
<i>Whatever you got, I don't care.</i>

379
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:53,359
You got it.

380
00:20:53,866 --> 00:20:55,857
<i>What? What's the problem?</i>

381
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:59,464
<i>- I don't really like this...</i>
- What?

382
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,802
- This new Larry.
<i>- What's the matter?</i>

383
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:06,208
Just too enthusiastic,
and I miss the old Larry.

384
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:09,179
- Do you?
<i>- Yeah. There's Jeremy.</i>

385
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:13,344
<i>Larry, I'm glad I caught up to you.</i>
<i>Housekeeper said you'd be down here.</i>

386
00:21:13,419 --> 00:21:15,512
I want to talk to you real quick.

387
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:18,481
- Let me take a guess.
- All right.

388
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:21,082
- All right, can I take a guess?
- Yeah, sure.

389
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:24,795
<i>You don't want me to write</i>
the letter of recommendation.

390
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,157
- Wow! Yeah.
- Holy, what a-

391
00:21:27,232 --> 00:21:30,599
<i>- That's a load off my mind, I'll tell you.</i>
<i>- It's a shame, though.</i>

392
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:33,763
<i>'Cause I wrote some really laudatory things</i>
about your work...

393
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,467
with the geometric shapes...

394
00:21:36,542 --> 00:21:39,033
the triangles and the trapezoids
and all of that.

395
00:21:39,111 --> 00:21:40,908
<i>There's a little more to it than that-</i>

396
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,608
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>but they're very compelling figures...</i>

397
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:46,947
<i>- the triangle and the square and...</i>
- Thank you.

398
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:50,182
You take care of yourself.
Maybe some other time.

399
00:21:50,389 --> 00:21:53,017
<i>I'm available for any kind of favor</i>
that you need.

400
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:55,322
Okay, thanks a lot, bye-bye, now.

401
00:21:57,062 --> 00:21:59,929
Coffee on me! Ladies and gentlemen...

402
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:03,093
free coffee and donuts
and Danish and bagels.

403
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:06,604
Anything you want.
On me, I got it, everybody, come on.

404
00:22:06,672 --> 00:22:10,199
Come on up, get some coffee.
<i>That's right, go ahead, enjoy yourself.</i>

405
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:14,541
<i>Thataway, that's it, don't be shy.</i>
Thank you very much, thank you.

406
00:22:14,613 --> 00:22:17,138
Come on, people, everything on me.

407
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:22,782
This is very good, by the way, thank you.
<i>It's a cafe latte? What is that, milk?</i>

408
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:25,221
- Milk and coffee?
- Milk and coffee, yeah.

409
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,053
<i>Milk and coffee, who would've thought?</i>

410
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:29,219
- Milk and coffee.
- We can go now if you want.

411
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:32,127
- My God, what a drink!
- I want to take off.

412
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,893
<i>- It's milk and coffee mixed together.</i>
<i>- Let's do that.</i>

413
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:38,835
<i>We've gotta go there,</i>
sit down, have a donut, have a bagel.

414
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:42,873
<i>- Is Shaquille O'Neal on this floor?</i>
- Down the hall.

415
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you very much, thank you.

416
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:48,580
<i>Paging Dr. Bender. Paging Dr. Bender.</i>

417
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:51,172
Excuse me, are you a doctor?

418
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:54,841
<i>- Yes, I'm a doctor.</i>
- Could you do me a favor?

419
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,117
Would you mind taking a quick glance
at this thing on my back?

420
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,387
<i>Tell me if it's anything</i>
that I should be concerned about.

421
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,894
- Sure, turn around.
- Right over here.

422
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:07,523
<i>- Do you see that over...</i>
- This is a solar keratosis.

423
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,033
- What is that?
<i>- It's benign, it's from the sun.</i>

424
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:12,366
- Really?
<i>- I wouldn't worry about it. It's nothing.</i>

425
00:23:12,438 --> 00:23:14,201
- My God, thank you.
- Sure.

426
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:16,468
That was so nice of you to do that.

427
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:18,370
More doctors should be like you.

428
00:23:18,444 --> 00:23:21,004
- Stay out of the sun.
- Okay, thanks, Doc.

429
00:23:24,883 --> 00:23:26,214
Excuse me.

430
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:32,056
<i>I've got these tapes I'd like to give</i>
<i>to Shaquille O'Neal. Is that possible?</i>

431
00:23:32,124 --> 00:23:34,718
Just leave them there.
<i>We'll make sure he gets them.</i>

432
00:23:34,793 --> 00:23:37,523
- Really? Thank you very much.
- Hey, Larry.

433
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,088
- Hey, Albert.
- What are you doing here?

434
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:43,328
I just was gonna give these
<i>Seinfeld tapes to Shaq.</i>

435
00:23:43,535 --> 00:23:45,298
<i>That's really nice of you.</i>

436
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,600
Nice of you to come down here to apologize.

437
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:52,110
<i>- That's very... He'll appreciate it.</i>
- I was actually just coming to drop them off.

438
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:54,702
<i>- I wouldn't dare even...</i>
<i>- I'm going in there now.</i>

439
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,010
<i>I'll take you in there with me, come on.</i>

440
00:23:57,082 --> 00:23:58,572
- Really?
- Yeah.

441
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:04,320
<i>- What, you think he's gonna hurt you?</i>
- Yeah, I do.

442
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:06,254
<i>I'm sure he'd appreciate an apology.</i>

443
00:24:06,325 --> 00:24:08,054
- It was an accident.
<i>- I'll apologize.</i>

444
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:09,924
What can you do? Things happen.

445
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:12,828
<i>That's a great present.</i>
<i>He'll be on his back for two months.</i>

446
00:24:12,898 --> 00:24:16,061
<i>- You think he'll like it?</i>
<i>- He loves it, it's his favorite show.</i>

447
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,535
- Great.
- So how things been going?

448
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,968
- Never been better.
- Good.

449
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:25,204
- What do you got, big guy?
- Peanut butter.

450
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:30,811
Dairy product, peanut butter.
What you mean, no?

451
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:33,613
- Peanut butter is not a dairy product.
<i>- It's not dairy.</i>

452
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:37,314
The whole world knows
peanut butter is a dairy product.

453
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:39,414
- What are you saying?
- Dairy is from a cow.

454
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:42,426
- Peanuts are not a dairy product.
- Peanut butter, moo.

455
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:44,894
Okay, peanuts come from
the ground or something.

456
00:24:44,963 --> 00:24:47,932
- Albert, how you doing?
- Look who I found wandering the halls.

457
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,061
<i>Larry David, Shaquille O'Neal.</i>
<i>He's got something he wants to say to you.</i>

458
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:54,929
<i>I'm so sorry...</i>

459
00:24:55,707 --> 00:25:00,041
<i>about the incident, and I don't know</i>
<i>how that could've happened.</i>

460
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:03,138
I was stretching.
<i>I never sat there before. I'm sorry.</i>

461
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:04,807
<i>Is that supposed to help? "Sorry"?</i>

462
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:07,181
<i>I don't know what to do</i>
to make it up to you.

463
00:25:07,252 --> 00:25:10,847
<i>I brought you these Seinfeld tapes.</i>
Albert told me you were a big fan.

464
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:14,859
- I am.
- I got you all the tapes of every episode.

465
00:25:15,194 --> 00:25:17,526
You have every tape of every show?

466
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:20,292
<i>- Listen...</i>
- Scattergories.

467
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:22,924
Dairy products. Peanut butter...

468
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:27,034
would be considered a dairy product,
am I correct?

469
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,369
- Absolutely, butter.
- Thank you.

470
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:32,171
- A man that has some sense.
- No.

471
00:25:32,411 --> 00:25:35,938
<i>Okay, listen, I've got</i>
<i>"Pendant, Porsche, Popeye...</i>

472
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:39,006
<i>"Pago Pago, and Provolone."</i>

00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:42,815
<i>- Doc's killing us.</i>
<i>- I'm gonna go to the can, I'll be right back.</i>

474
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:47,014
<i>- Told you he was smart. What's the score?</i>
- All right, now he has 26.

475
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,484
- And what do I have?
- You have 25.

476
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,892
- And what do you got?
- I have 25.

477
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:53,461
<i>By the way, didn't the doctor...</i>

478
00:25:53,532 --> 00:25:56,592
<i>mention five items for "P"?</i>

479
00:25:56,668 --> 00:25:57,726
Yeah.

480
00:25:57,803 --> 00:26:00,636
<i>There's no "Pago Pago"</i>
<i>and "provolone" on this list...</i>

481
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:02,936
if you just want to check it out.

482
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:06,872
- Oh, my God.
- The doc is cheating at Scattergories?

483
00:26:06,945 --> 00:26:10,312
He was obviously making it up
after the time ran out.

484
00:26:10,382 --> 00:26:14,750
- Why would you cheat at Scattergories?
- A doctor.

485
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:18,146
- You want to play another game?
- Doc.

486
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:22,816
- How can you cheat at Scattergories?
- What are you talking about?

487
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:26,456
What do you mean? You gave us five names.
<i>There's only three here.</i>

488
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,026
Listen, Doc, you know what?
<i>I'm sick and tired of you.</i>

489
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:33,594
<i>- You're fired, get out.</i>
<i>- I didn't cheat at anything.</i>

490
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:35,640
<i>Get this guy out of here, you're fired.</i>

491
00:26:35,707 --> 00:26:37,004
- I won, Shaq.
- Get out.

492
00:26:37,075 --> 00:26:39,873
- Al, come on.
- I told you to get out.

493
00:26:39,945 --> 00:26:42,880
- Get his ass out of here.
- The timer ran out.

494
00:26:43,282 --> 00:26:46,809
<i>- The timer didn't run out, you cheated.</i>
<i>- It's the timer.</i>

495
00:26:46,885 --> 00:26:50,048
<i>- No, it's not the timer, get out.</i>
- I was gonna write it down.

496
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:52,989
- Get your ass out of here, get out.
- You heard him. Get out!

497
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:54,423
You gotta go.

498
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:58,627
<i>Don't you say goodbye?</i>

499
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:02,197
Notice how no one ever
says goodbye anymore?

500
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:04,599
<i>- Have you noticed that? It's unbelievable.</i>
- Yeah.

501
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,195
<i>Why can't people leave a room</i>
and be a little polite?

502
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:10,730
<i>Okay, my favorite Seinfeld episode</i>
<i>was The Contest.</i>

503
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:13,107
<i>The Contest?</i>
<i>I got it, you want The Contest?</i>

504
00:27:13,178 --> 00:27:16,113
<i>If you pop in The Contest,</i>
<i>I'll let bygones be bygones...</i>

505
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,411
and I forgot that you tripped me.

506
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,515
Peanut butter is a dairy product.

507
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:22,246
- Shaq?
- Yes?

508
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:26,618
Kind of an odd thing. I had a chance
to go back and look at your file...

509
00:27:26,692 --> 00:27:31,356
<i>and I don't know how this happened,</i>
but it seems Dr. Wiggins misread the MRl.

510
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,423
His initial diagnosis of the complete tear
of the quadriceps tendon...

511
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,263
<i>it's a partial tear at best.</i>

512
00:27:37,336 --> 00:27:40,499
If you sit down for maybe a week,
<i>you'll be back to full strength.</i>

513
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:43,405
<i>- That's great!</i>
<i>- One week? I can't believe it!</i>

514
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:46,337
<i>I was alone.</i>

515
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:17,005
<i>Excuse me, I'm sorry.</i>

516
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,511
- Could you give me a ride?
- The doctor.

517
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,870
- Yes, from upstairs.
- Yeah.

518
00:28:22,948 --> 00:28:27,112
<i>- Yes, how's your back?</i>
<i>- Okay, Barry, come on, let's go.</i>

519
00:28:29,321 --> 00:28:31,551
<i>- What...</i>
- Stay out of the sun.

520
00:28:32,457 --> 00:28:36,018
<i>- He's not a doctor?</i>
- Sixth floor, Psychiatric.
