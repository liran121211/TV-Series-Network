1
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:18,484
<i>Here's Amber, everybody,</i>
<i>Amber, come on out.</i>

2
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:27,247
Larry?

3
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:34,691
Just move a little bit?

4
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:37,442
I asked you to be ready when I got back.

5
00:00:39,293 --> 00:00:42,365
Have you even moved
since I left this morning?

6
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:45,327
Yes, of course, what are you talking about?

7
00:00:45,853 --> 00:00:49,004
I got up to tip room service.

8
00:00:50,373 --> 00:00:51,601
Come on, that's funny.

9
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:52,842
No, it's not funny.

10
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:56,562
It might have been funny a week ago,
but enough is enough.

11
00:00:56,653 --> 00:00:59,008
Every time I walk in,
you're just sitting here...

12
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:02,210
with your chips
<i>and your cookies and watching...</i>

13
00:01:03,213 --> 00:01:04,362
<i>Maury.</i>

14
00:01:04,453 --> 00:01:05,522
You know, listen...

15
00:01:05,613 --> 00:01:07,683
we've got to meet that woman
in a few minutes.

16
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:10,845
So, you need to get dressed
so we can go look at that house.

17
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:12,571
Let me just finish.

18
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:15,126
No, you need to get dressed now.

19
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,488
No, because they're gonna go
to boot camp...

20
00:01:17,573 --> 00:01:19,768
and I want to see which ones
get rehabilitated.

21
00:01:19,853 --> 00:01:23,004
- Please get up.
- They break them down and they cry.

22
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:25,766
And then when they're done
with the boot camp...

23
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:27,406
they're all better.

24
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:29,042
Have you just retired...

25
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,442
is this what you'll do
for the rest of your life...

26
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:33,171
and you're never going to work again?

27
00:01:33,253 --> 00:01:34,572
Of course I'm gonna work again!

28
00:01:34,653 --> 00:01:35,722
- When?
- I don't know!

29
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,371
You're in the prime of your life!

30
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:41,048
I'm gonna work
when something comes up that I want to do.

31
00:01:42,613 --> 00:01:46,492
I would really like for you to get dressed
so we can go look at this house.

32
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,086
- Fine.
- Fine, thank you.

33
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:50,368
<i>All right, here's Brittany,</i>
<i>Brittany, come on out.</i>

34
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:52,523
Look at that girl come out, look.

35
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:56,927
"You don't know me!
Yeah, you all go fuck yourself!

36
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,526
"That's right, yeah, come on!

37
00:01:58,613 --> 00:02:02,765
"Come on, yeah, come on, yeah, fuck you!

38
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:04,332
"No, fuck you!"

39
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,367
It's big.

40
00:02:12,453 --> 00:02:15,684
- It's really big. I think it's a little too big.
- No.

41
00:02:15,773 --> 00:02:17,491
Look at the size of this place.

42
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:19,609
- It's perfect.
- Perfect?

43
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:22,002
This is like for the Osmonds, this place.

44
00:02:22,093 --> 00:02:24,209
I didn't know
why we had to sell the old place.

45
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,648
- Just 'cause of the wire?
- It was making me crazy.

46
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:27,927
That's not a reason to move.

47
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:31,050
That is a reason to move,
when you can't get rid of it.

48
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:33,403
There's the real estate agent.

49
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:40,805
I don't know why we had to leave the hotel.
I love the hotel.

50
00:02:40,893 --> 00:02:43,123
I cannot live there any longer.
It's not a house.

51
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:46,091
You get the room service, the wake-up calls.

52
00:02:46,213 --> 00:02:49,171
When do you use the wake-up calls?
You never leave.

53
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,084
- Naps.
- My God.

54
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:52,322
- Hello.
- Hi.

55
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:53,687
Hello, isn't this beautiful?

56
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,889
- Yes, we were just...
- It's awfully big.

57
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:57,804
It's very exciting, you're gonna love it.

58
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,724
- So, here's the scoop.
- Okay.

59
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:03,967
They are highly motivated sellers.
I think this one's a slam-dunk.

60
00:03:04,053 --> 00:03:06,613
If you like it,
we'll go back and write an offer.

61
00:03:06,693 --> 00:03:10,732
And I asked them about the cash.
They were totally open to a cash offer.

62
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:12,690
So, that is the absolute best.

63
00:03:12,773 --> 00:03:13,922
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

64
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:15,969
You could maybe be in here in days.

65
00:03:16,053 --> 00:03:17,566
What, days?

66
00:03:17,653 --> 00:03:21,885
They bought another house.
So they are so ready to move.

67
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,003
- Hello, hi, Susan.
- Hi, how are you?

68
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:29,165
- Good, how are you?
- Barbara Schneider, Cheryl and Larry David.

69
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:30,845
Hi. Nice to meet you.

70
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:32,082
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi.

71
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:34,403
My gosh, is that the ocean?

72
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:37,245
You get used to that in two days.

73
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,927
- Come on in.
- No, really.

74
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:43,528
- This is gorgeous.
- Yeah, it's very nice. Look at this.

75
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:45,888
We have vaulted ceilings.

76
00:03:46,613 --> 00:03:49,047
- Very spacious.
- Beautiful.

77
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,647
What about this furniture,
it's fantastic, isn't it?

78
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:53,451
Yeah, it fits perfectly in this room.

79
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,649
Beautiful. Beautiful house.

80
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:59,487
- Really beautiful.
- Thank you, and this is our amazing view.

81
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:02,409
Breakfast every morning, sunrise.

82
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,449
I love the sea.

83
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:08,006
My father was an Italian fisherman.

84
00:04:08,093 --> 00:04:10,926
- Really?
- Yeah, from the old country.

85
00:04:11,013 --> 00:04:14,926
This morning, you'll love this:
I saw a whale breach.

86
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:17,402
I've never seen that
here before, it's very rare.

87
00:04:17,493 --> 00:04:20,132
Can you shoot the whales from the terrace?

88
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:25,125
- What?
- 'Cause I like to have blubber for breakfast.

89
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,125
- Don't pay attention to him.
- No, pay attention.

90
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:31,205
- Okay.
- Are these the new suckers?

91
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,847
Larry David, Jay Schneider.

92
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:39,966
<i>I'd call you when you were at Seinfeld.</i>
I was working at the William Morris Agency.

93
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:43,762
I would call him up and pitch my clients.
How you doing? Jay Schneider.

94
00:04:43,853 --> 00:04:44,968
Hi, I'm Cheryl.

95
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:46,202
Nice to meet you.

96
00:04:46,293 --> 00:04:48,761
You won't believe this,
I just signed Jason Alexander.

97
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,651
- You're kidding, really?
- We're two months into it.

98
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,371
He's phenomenal, I'm a lucky guy.

99
00:04:53,453 --> 00:04:55,125
- A tremendous actor.
- Unbelievable.

100
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,646
Yeah, how's he doing?

101
00:04:56,733 --> 00:04:59,725
Honestly, he's kind of struggling right now.

102
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:02,452
- Is that right?
- Everybody wants George Costanza.

103
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:04,967
You know what, he's nothing like George.

104
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,645
<i>He's nothing at all like...</i>

105
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,452
He's the antithesis,
'cause Jason is brilliant...

106
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:13,446
and George is an idiot,
<i>just an imbecile and, you know...</i>

107
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:15,564
It's just tough to branch out with that.

108
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:18,121
I mean, the range of characters
this guy can do.

109
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:21,842
- You think he's an idiot?
- It's the classic barnacle.

110
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,446
But every sitcom needs that.

111
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:25,683
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

112
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,448
Yeah, I bet.

113
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,728
You got any ideas?
Anything coming down the pike?

114
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:32,691
I've got ideas, but I choose
not to carry them out.

115
00:05:32,773 --> 00:05:36,322
I say we team up you and Jason again.
Let's get you guys in a meeting.

116
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:37,607
You should call him.

117
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:40,161
You're not doing anything,
let's take a meeting.

118
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,084
Yeah, you're not doing anything.

119
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:45,927
Let's sit down and just kick around,
just kick around some ideas.

120
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,971
- I think it's a good idea.
- Don't want to push.

121
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:52,650
- Nice sweater.
- Thank you, it's cashmere.

122
00:05:52,973 --> 00:05:54,770
- Really?
- It's not for sale.

123
00:05:55,533 --> 00:05:56,886
That's cashmere?

124
00:05:57,573 --> 00:06:00,292
- 100%.
- It's nice, yeah.

125
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:05,002
- Let's go see the rest of the place.
- Yeah, let's see the rest of it.

126
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:12,643
I love it. I really think it's perfect.

127
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,564
Larry, did you love it?

128
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:16,291
- I liked it.
- You think it's perfect?

129
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:19,763
I really like it, it's a nice house.
It's big, but I like it.

130
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:22,208
- All right, that's all I needed.
- The master bedroom?

131
00:06:22,293 --> 00:06:25,490
I love the master bedroom,
the downstairs, the fireplace.

132
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:27,006
Let me ask you something.

133
00:06:27,093 --> 00:06:30,449
Did you notice that when I asked him
about the sweater...

134
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:32,603
he said it was 100% cashmere?

135
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:35,488
There's no way
that sweater's 100% cashmere.

136
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:39,771
It's, like, maybe 35, 40, 50 at the most,
but 100?

137
00:06:39,853 --> 00:06:43,641
- That can't be...
<i>- The sooner the better, I'm ready to...</i>

138
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:45,610
Wait a second, do you trust this guy...

139
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:47,923
'cause the guy's lying
about a cashmere sweater.

140
00:06:48,013 --> 00:06:49,332
You feel comfortable with that?

141
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:51,881
We're not buying a sweater,
we're buying a house.

142
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:54,726
Okay, listen, we have to
talk about how much to offer.

143
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:56,246
Absolutely.

144
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:02,450
What kind of person lies...

145
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:05,850
about a percentage of cashmere
in his sweater?

146
00:07:06,253 --> 00:07:08,244
You know, fake cashmere and all...

147
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,972
I do think it's a good idea
for you to work with Jason.

148
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:12,566
You know, I love Jason.

149
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:16,043
I just don't want to go back and do TV.

150
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,370
- Come on, TV is a great medium.
- Too much work.

151
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:23,002
- Too much work? You have to work.
- It's a pain in the ass, I can't do it.

152
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:24,572
No, you need to work.

153
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,605
I'm married, that's plenty of work.

154
00:07:28,773 --> 00:07:31,287
Okay, but you need to start writing.

155
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:34,651
Just, you know, I think for your own good,
for your own sanity.

156
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,850
Why, I'm not insane. You think I'm insane?

157
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,493
Listen, Richard Lewis
wants me to manage him.

158
00:07:40,573 --> 00:07:41,926
- Really.
- Yeah.

159
00:07:42,013 --> 00:07:43,651
But I need you to be honest with me.

160
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,644
- Sure.
- No, really honest with me.

161
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:49,248
- Okay.
- Is he a high-maintenance guy?

162
00:07:51,373 --> 00:07:54,968
- What, are you kidding?
- So, his act is pretty close to...

163
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:56,532
Yeah, but so what?

164
00:07:56,613 --> 00:07:58,524
I'm gonna sign him, you like that.

165
00:07:58,613 --> 00:07:59,648
Good.

166
00:07:59,733 --> 00:08:02,486
I can't believe he didn't even
mention that to me.

167
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:03,642
Hey, Tom!

168
00:08:04,213 --> 00:08:07,922
- How are you, man?
- Jeff, hi, good to see you.

169
00:08:08,013 --> 00:08:09,287
Good to see you, too.

170
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:11,489
Tom Clark, Larry David.

171
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:12,972
Larry David, nice to meet you.

172
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:15,692
- Nice to meet you.
- Tom, sit down, man.

173
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:21,169
- Tom sold me my Toyota Sequoia.
- Toyota of Hollywood?

174
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:24,211
- Toyota of Hollywood, yeah.
- You're a car dealer?

175
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:25,521
- Dealer, yeah.
- Really?

176
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:27,365
- But I like to sell, too.
- Do you?

177
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:29,125
Somebody special comes in, a bigwig...

178
00:08:29,213 --> 00:08:31,773
- He's a bigwig?
- Yeah, he manages.

179
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:33,923
That's good, I'm managed by a bigwig.

180
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,129
- What do you drive?
- I drive a Prius.

181
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:37,441
You're happy with the Prius?

182
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:40,491
Very happy, and the Prius
is extremely happy with me.

183
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,652
Let me ask you a question.

184
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:44,644
How does somebody
become a car salesman?

185
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:47,611
Do you have to have a lot of experience
for that?

186
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:52,011
It was in my blood, yeah.
I mean, it takes years to be a car salesman.

187
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:55,001
You know, I always felt
I could be a great salesman.

188
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:56,970
You gotta have the gift.

189
00:08:57,053 --> 00:08:59,521
'Cause believe me,
I could talk anybody into anything.

190
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:01,888
Except women into sex,
that's one thing I can't do.

191
00:09:01,973 --> 00:09:05,124
Besides that, I know how
to manipulate people, I'm very good at it.

192
00:09:05,213 --> 00:09:08,888
- Car salesmen are not bullshit. I mean...
- No, of course, they're not.

193
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:11,282
We're an honest pack, between ourselves.

194
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:13,409
To be honest with you,
I like to make money.

195
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:15,723
But I love to sell cars, I really do.

196
00:09:16,173 --> 00:09:17,925
If I wanted to do that for one day...

197
00:09:18,013 --> 00:09:19,082
- Sell cars.
- Yeah.

198
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:20,447
Just for a day.

199
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,521
I don't think so.

200
00:09:22,613 --> 00:09:25,650
I want to see if I can do it.
I thought that I'd be great at it.

201
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,246
You can't do it, you're a writer.

202
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,801
- What do you do?
- Do you know who he is?

203
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:32,282
<i>That's Larry David, he created Seinfeld.</i>

204
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:34,688
Okay.

205
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:38,721
- Forget that, I just want to try it for a day.
- I think that would be great.

206
00:09:38,813 --> 00:09:40,166
Come in and work for me.

207
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:42,642
Maybe I'll do it for two or three days.
Who knows?

208
00:09:42,733 --> 00:09:44,849
What're you doing?
What are you talking about?

209
00:09:44,933 --> 00:09:47,970
- What do you mean two or three days?
- What do you care?

210
00:09:48,053 --> 00:09:50,487
- What do I care?
- What if I'm good at it? Excuse me.

211
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:51,972
- What if you're good at it?
- Yeah.

212
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:54,123
You're not gonna sell a car the first day.

213
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,010
I guarantee you...

214
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:58,732
I will sell more cars
than anybody in your showroom.

215
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:02,442
You won't sell a car the first day.
Nobody does it the first day.

216
00:10:02,533 --> 00:10:05,570
- You'll see, okay, fine.
- I'll tell you what. Come by...

217
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:07,484
get some brochures,
you know where we are.

218
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,450
I'll get the brochures, I'll study up...

219
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:11,763
and I'll learn everything,
don't worry about it.

220
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:15,050
- I'll have it down when I get there.
- Come by on Monday?

221
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:18,011
I really appreciate this,
it's like a fantasy that I have.

222
00:10:18,093 --> 00:10:20,653
- This'll be great. Monday morning.
- You got it. Great.

223
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,052
Thank you.

224
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,125
I'm pretty excited.

225
00:10:30,693 --> 00:10:35,005
My gosh, that's wonderful.
No, that is no problem.

226
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,642
Larry just walked in, I can't wait to tell him.
Okay, bye.

227
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:42,362
You're not gonna believe this.
We can move into the house on Monday.

228
00:10:42,453 --> 00:10:44,489
- Really?
- Yeah, it's all done.

229
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:45,841
So fast?

230
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,208
Yeah, it was a cash deal,
there was no escrow.

231
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:51,091
They've already
moved their stuff out, we're ready.

232
00:10:51,173 --> 00:10:54,449
So, make sure
that you are clear on Monday...

233
00:10:54,533 --> 00:10:57,411
which I'm sure is not
going to be a problem for you.

234
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:59,802
I actually can't do it on Monday.

235
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,202
Why?

236
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:04,052
- I got a job.
- You did?

237
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:06,963
That's good, did you call Jason?

238
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:09,365
I'm selling cars.

239
00:11:12,813 --> 00:11:13,802
What?

240
00:11:13,893 --> 00:11:17,852
I was having lunch today
with a guy who owns a Toyota showroom.

241
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,442
<i>He sold Jeff some cars and...</i>

242
00:11:21,893 --> 00:11:24,043
So, now you're going to be a car salesman?

243
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:27,762
Yeah, you know, he said I could try it.

244
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,650
- What is wrong with you?
- Why? What?

245
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,530
You've committed to this?

246
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:34,764
Yeah. It's only for, like, a couple of days.

247
00:11:34,853 --> 00:11:38,766
Or however long I want to do it.
I just want to get it out of my system...

248
00:11:38,853 --> 00:11:40,172
You can't do it on Monday.

249
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:43,768
I have to do it on Monday.
I have to show up for my first day at work.

250
00:11:43,853 --> 00:11:46,003
What, am I supposed to call in sick?

251
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,845
That's not gonna fly.

252
00:11:49,773 --> 00:11:52,685
Prius? That's ours, that's easy.

253
00:11:53,173 --> 00:11:54,765
"Can I help you?"

254
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,252
What do you think?

255
00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:01,089
"Excuse me, sir, perhaps
the Land Cruiser would interest you.

256
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:04,370
"And we have, Corolla, Canola...

257
00:12:04,733 --> 00:12:07,645
<i>"and Rave." Is it Rav?</i>

258
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:10,441
- This is so stupid.
- Why is it stupid?

259
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:11,727
It's insane.

260
00:12:11,813 --> 00:12:15,283
Some people, they run in marathons,
they want to see if they can do that.

261
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:17,091
Others, they swim the English Channel.

262
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:19,289
All I want is work in a showroom for a while.

263
00:12:19,373 --> 00:12:22,171
So, what's the big deal?
Who's more insane?

264
00:12:22,893 --> 00:12:25,851
And then on Monday
when I come home from work...

265
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:28,686
I'll help with the pictures
or whatever you need me...

266
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:32,368
to help around the house with,
I'll help when I come home.

267
00:12:32,733 --> 00:12:35,531
But I'll be a little tired, too, probably.

268
00:12:42,013 --> 00:12:44,004
Yeah. Alan, guess what.

269
00:12:46,053 --> 00:12:47,771
Larry David just walked in.

270
00:12:47,853 --> 00:12:49,605
- Who you talking to?
- Alan.

271
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:50,967
- Really?
- Yeah.

272
00:12:51,053 --> 00:12:54,841
- Say hello for me.
- Okay, you take care, I'll talk to you later.

273
00:12:55,413 --> 00:12:59,804
Man, how you doing? It's great to see you.

274
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:03,044
- How come you didn't say hello?
- There wasn't an opening.

275
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:06,691
- Boy, you look great.
- Yeah.

276
00:13:06,773 --> 00:13:10,527
Come on, come sit down.
<i>You want water or a coffee or...</i>

277
00:13:10,613 --> 00:13:12,331
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

278
00:13:13,853 --> 00:13:16,970
- So, L.D.
- Yeah?

279
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:18,692
What it be?

280
00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:21,526
I like how our representatives
got us together here.

281
00:13:21,613 --> 00:13:22,887
Right, Schneider, yeah.

282
00:13:22,973 --> 00:13:26,090
They set us up.
Did he tell you that I was buying his house?

283
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:27,492
Yeah.

284
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,007
So, this is good, how's everything going?

285
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:33,927
Things are, you know, things are good.
I don't know, I've got this set up...

286
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:37,562
and did some directing and
trying to produce some stuff.

287
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:42,927
You know, the acting thing is,
frankly, coming a little hard.

288
00:13:43,013 --> 00:13:47,325
I'd love to go back to TV, that seems good.
But I can't shake this George thing.

289
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:50,371
They all see me as George.

290
00:13:50,693 --> 00:13:54,242
I mean, the thing about it
is that you're not even close to George.

291
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,210
I tell this to people all the time.

292
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,602
"You can't imagine
what a great actor this guy is.

293
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:00,684
<i>"He is nothing like that character."</i>

294
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:02,445
- Thank you.
- Nothing.

295
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,808
I know, I go in and I talk to them...

296
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:06,929
and, you know, I try to present differently.

297
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,573
But they see the idiot...

298
00:14:09,693 --> 00:14:13,447
they see the schmuck, so, I don't know.

299
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,122
What do you mean "schmuck"?
I don't get that.

300
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:18,568
The yutz, the idiot.

301
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:21,565
- You know.
- No, frankly, I don't know.

302
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,247
How can you say
he's a schmuck, a yutz and an idiot?

303
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,608
I don't see him that way,
I just see him as funny.

304
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,490
I mean, of course, it was funny.

305
00:14:28,573 --> 00:14:32,486
But he was the fall guy, the jackass role.

306
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:36,047
You know, this is the guy
that never got the girl...

307
00:14:36,133 --> 00:14:38,089
he finally gets the girl and he kills her...

308
00:14:38,173 --> 00:14:41,006
with the envelope.
Doesn't know what he wants.

309
00:14:41,093 --> 00:14:43,368
That's funny, that's not schmucky.

310
00:14:43,453 --> 00:14:47,128
What is more jerky or putzy
than going to a girl's house...

311
00:14:47,213 --> 00:14:49,568
and stealing a tape
out of her answering machine?

312
00:14:49,653 --> 00:14:50,881
I went to a girl's house...

313
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,929
and took a tape out of
an answering machine.

314
00:14:53,013 --> 00:14:55,288
Larry, he's eating éclairs
out of a garbage can?

315
00:14:55,373 --> 00:14:57,568
So what, I ate an éclair out of a garbage can!

316
00:14:57,653 --> 00:15:00,326
And, masturbation contests,
four people agreeing...

317
00:15:00,413 --> 00:15:03,405
I was in a contest and you know I was in it.

318
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:06,644
So, I'm a schmuck for being
in a masturbation contest?

319
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:10,043
It's not an incredibly
noble experiment, was it?

320
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:12,203
I'm sorry that you hate
the character so much.

321
00:15:12,293 --> 00:15:15,126
I don't hate the character,
I'm a little tired of it.

322
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:18,603
I mean, I'm an actor.
I have a range of characters that I can play.

323
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:20,763
Why am I relegated to this?

324
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:25,247
Everywhere I go on the street,
"Hey, Costanza!

325
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,164
"Hey, jackass!"

326
00:15:28,813 --> 00:15:32,089
I just had this idea.

327
00:15:33,613 --> 00:15:36,207
I don't know, I'll throw it out at you, okay?

328
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,805
For a series, an idea for a series, okay?

329
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,402
You played a character...

330
00:15:43,413 --> 00:15:45,688
based on what you're going through now.

331
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:47,570
In other words, you play an actor...

332
00:15:47,653 --> 00:15:52,010
and the actor is having
a tough time getting work...

333
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:56,166
because he was on this mega-hit series,
<i>like a Seinfeld kind of series...</i>

334
00:15:56,253 --> 00:15:59,802
and now this actor,
after the series goes off the air...

335
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:01,963
he can't get work anymore...

336
00:16:02,053 --> 00:16:04,965
because he's so identified
with this character...

337
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:06,964
that they won't let him do anything else.

338
00:16:07,053 --> 00:16:10,409
And he becomes embittered
and grows to hate the character.

339
00:16:13,613 --> 00:16:15,365
That's pretty funny.

340
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:23,125
You son of a bitch, that's pretty damn good.

341
00:16:23,213 --> 00:16:27,570
All right, let's do it.
Come on, let's go, you wanna do it?

342
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:31,368
I'd like to.

343
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:34,725
I'm actually working.

344
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:38,610
You working on another thing,
another show or something?

345
00:16:39,533 --> 00:16:41,171
I'm selling cars.

346
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:44,525
I start on Monday.

347
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,281
Hello?

348
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,091
- Bye.
- Bye.

349
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,652
See you in the new house.

350
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,610
- Okay.
- Wish me luck.

351
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,048
Good luck.

352
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:15,725
Anything else you have?

353
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:19,692
If I'm closing in on something, price,
always come to you.

354
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:21,889
You really do have to come back
and talk to me.

355
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:23,850
- Okay.
- Just have fun.

356
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:26,652
- All right, thank you.
- The cars sell themselves.

357
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:28,291
I'll see you at lunch.

358
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:40,883
- Hi, I'm Larry.
- Larry, Archie.

359
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:43,407
You know what?
My wife's name is Veronica.

360
00:17:43,493 --> 00:17:47,486
- So, this is the Camry I heard about?
- This is the big boy, the top of the line.

361
00:17:47,573 --> 00:17:49,609
This is as good as it gets.

362
00:17:50,013 --> 00:17:51,924
<i>You know, you hear "Lexus."</i>

363
00:17:52,013 --> 00:17:54,891
We don't hear "Camry,"
but that's what you should be hearing.

364
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,123
Tell me, what's in the engine here?

365
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:58,692
What's in it?

366
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:02,767
Big stuff, big charging,
crazy pistons, nutty pistons.

367
00:18:02,853 --> 00:18:05,083
- Is it twin cam?
- Yeah, twin cam.

368
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:08,404
- What other colors...
- This is a fucking work of art.

369
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:10,921
- What's your name?
- Shirley.

370
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:15,450
- Shirley, that's my mother's name.
- Tilt-wheel steering, which I really like.

371
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:17,364
Does this car have that? Is it standard?

372
00:18:17,453 --> 00:18:20,172
You know, you don't have the need
to tilt in this car.

373
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:22,164
I've never had a tilting need.

374
00:18:23,013 --> 00:18:25,607
<i>My wife calls it Pepe. "Are we taking Pepe?"</i>

375
00:18:25,693 --> 00:18:27,411
'Cause we have two cars.

376
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:29,370
What kind of gas mileage am I going to get?

377
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:31,284
- 52.
- 52 in the city.

378
00:18:31,373 --> 00:18:35,889
Depending on the city, of course.
Duluth is a city, it's considered a city...

379
00:18:35,973 --> 00:18:38,931
but it's not as big as Brooklyn or whatever.

380
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,048
Okay.

381
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:42,361
That's my brother's name.

382
00:18:42,453 --> 00:18:44,091
- Really?
- Yeah.

383
00:18:44,173 --> 00:18:45,526
What's the wheel base?

384
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:49,208
My wife is concerned
about a car being solid.

385
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:53,002
It's a thick base, it's a thick wheel base.

386
00:18:53,253 --> 00:18:56,006
I heard that these SUVs...

387
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,893
that they sometimes
they roll over rather easily.

388
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:02,522
Roll over, are you kidding?
Look at this thing.

389
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:05,281
Jesus Christ.

390
00:19:05,973 --> 00:19:07,292
Dana.

391
00:19:07,373 --> 00:19:09,682
Dana, that's my middle name,
Larry Dana David.

392
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,684
I notice this is a GT...

393
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:15,482
and the brochure says
there's a model called the GTS.

394
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:18,770
What is the difference
between the GT and the GTS?

395
00:19:18,853 --> 00:19:22,846
Okay, the GTS<i>
is "guaranteed tremendous safety."</i>

396
00:19:23,973 --> 00:19:27,568
So, without the "S,"
<i>it's just "guaranteed tremendous."</i>

397
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:31,205
- How you doing?
- Fine.

398
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:32,408
Hi, can I help you folks?

399
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:34,006
- Apheon.
- Apheon.

400
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:36,653
That's my step-brother's name, Apheon.

401
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:41,084
That might be for me, one second.

402
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:42,208
No, okay.

403
00:19:42,293 --> 00:19:43,965
I want to find out more about the car.

404
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:46,408
I want to see the features
so we can negotiate...

405
00:19:46,493 --> 00:19:47,642
Don't be acting like...

406
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,963
you going to put a whole bunch
of stuff back here.

407
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:51,884
- I like it.
- What you need a big car for?

408
00:19:51,973 --> 00:19:55,966
<i>- I don't need to... I like this car.</i>
- Okay, could you excuse us for one second?

409
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:59,250
What the hell are you doing over here?
You're fucking up my shit.

410
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:00,971
<i>Why you pushing hard to get this...</i>

411
00:20:01,053 --> 00:20:03,806
Because she likes the car,
she wants to be happy in it.

412
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:07,772
Maybe she won't be able to afford the car
if she takes it off the lot.

413
00:20:08,133 --> 00:20:11,170
Is there somebody else
who could help me with this car?

414
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:15,008
Look, sir, I'm sorry, thank you.

415
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,928
I'm really not interested
in buying today, okay?

416
00:20:18,013 --> 00:20:20,322
What? What are you doing? Shirley?

417
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,492
<i>- Ever seen the Seinfeld show?</i>
- Yeah.

418
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:27,048
I'm the co-creator of the show.

419
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,127
No, it's true.

420
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,763
Please, buy one, please?

421
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,331
You'll sell a lot of them,
you're a good salesman.

422
00:20:54,093 --> 00:20:55,082
Cheryl?

423
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:56,682
Hi.

424
00:20:57,293 --> 00:20:59,648
Isn't this weird,
coming home to your new house?

425
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:01,132
Yeah, hi.

426
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:07,322
- So, how did it go today?
- Pretty good.

427
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:09,369
- Really?
- Yeah.

428
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:11,045
Did you sell a lot of cars?

429
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:13,647
You know, that's not
how the business works.

430
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:16,331
You know, you don't just sell them.

431
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:19,610
People, they think about it
and they're, you know...

432
00:21:19,693 --> 00:21:23,971
<i>- you get back in touch with them and...</i>
- Are you over it now?

433
00:21:25,853 --> 00:21:28,651
- What does that mean?
- The whole car-selling thing.

434
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:31,930
No, I'm not going to quit
just after one day, you know...

435
00:21:32,013 --> 00:21:34,129
<i>I want to do it right. I want to...</i>

436
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,449
I want to show them I can do it.

437
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:41,968
- Okay.
- But, I'll tell you, it's exhausting.

438
00:21:42,933 --> 00:21:45,572
Tell me, I have been unpacking all day.

439
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,848
House seems different
than it did the other day.

440
00:21:50,933 --> 00:21:53,242
Yeah, it's definitely different.

441
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:55,843
It feels strange, that's all.

442
00:21:56,053 --> 00:21:58,851
Maybe after we hang everything up...

443
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,811
and finish unpacking.

444
00:22:02,373 --> 00:22:03,886
Maybe, I don't know.

445
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:21,685
What's that noise?

446
00:22:23,613 --> 00:22:25,365
Do you hear a noise?

447
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,128
Yeah.

448
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:31,172
What is it?

449
00:22:31,613 --> 00:22:34,571
It's probably just
a house sound or something.

450
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,086
A house sound?

451
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:38,289
- Yeah.
- What's a house sound?

452
00:22:38,453 --> 00:22:42,810
- You know, noises that a house makes?
- Houses make noises?

453
00:22:43,813 --> 00:22:47,488
- Plumbing, or it's settling.
- What? Settling?

454
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:55,892
I can't sleep with that.

455
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:58,690
You'll get used to it, just ignore it.

456
00:22:58,773 --> 00:23:00,411
Our last house didn't make any sounds.

457
00:23:00,493 --> 00:23:03,132
Yes, it did, you'll get used to this.

458
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:06,649
I don't know,
this is coming from somewhere.

459
00:23:06,733 --> 00:23:10,931
I'm going to be up all night with this thing.
Gotta be fresh in the morning.

460
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:16,922
Told you I didn't trust that Schneider.

461
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:19,481
He didn't say anything
about a house sound.

462
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,408
It's like you're driving a bus up there.

463
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:49,610
- Yeah, looking over the traffic.
- Didn't you envy bus drivers?

464
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:52,844
With the big, round steering wheel
like that, you know.

465
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,730
Makes you, gives you a little ego boost.

466
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:57,168
- Oversee the traffic.
- Yeah, that's right.

467
00:23:57,253 --> 00:23:58,971
You've got a great view.

468
00:23:59,173 --> 00:24:02,085
- You know what? I think I'm ready to buy.
- No kidding.

469
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:03,492
- Yeah.
- Great.

470
00:24:03,573 --> 00:24:06,246
You get the wood grain,
we might do this today.

471
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:09,969
We could get some wood grain.
What's so hard about getting wood grain?

472
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:13,523
- Wood.
<i>- Wood grain is not going to stop us from...</i>

473
00:24:13,733 --> 00:24:17,282
- That's what I like to hear.
- This is a joke, right?

474
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:20,604
Could you please excuse us for a minute?
I'm talking to somebody.

475
00:24:20,693 --> 00:24:25,323
- This is a practical joke, right?
- A practical joke? I'm sorry.

476
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:27,085
Would please excuse us for a second?

477
00:24:27,173 --> 00:24:29,368
I'm talking to somebody.
I'll meet you outside.

478
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:32,763
- Excuse who?
- Excuse me, just wait outside, okay?

479
00:24:32,853 --> 00:24:34,844
Go outside, go outside, okay?

480
00:24:35,573 --> 00:24:37,689
I'm with a customer,
you see I'm with somebody?

481
00:24:37,773 --> 00:24:39,445
You're with a customer, selling cars...

482
00:24:39,533 --> 00:24:41,888
- Sir!
- I'll come back another time.

483
00:24:41,973 --> 00:24:44,646
- Forget him.
- You just cost me a customer.

484
00:24:44,773 --> 00:24:46,650
What did you just say?

485
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,405
- You cost me a customer.
- I cost you...

486
00:24:48,493 --> 00:24:50,609
- I had him!
- How can you have a customer?

487
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:53,526
I was about to take him
to the manager's office.

488
00:24:53,613 --> 00:24:56,525
What are you, fucking Willy Loman?
What are you doing here?

489
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:59,127
- I'm doing business here!
- I came from Jeff's office.

490
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:02,523
He tells me you're here selling cars,
which I say has gotta be a joke.

491
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:05,173
But I'm here because
you told him I'm high maintenance?

492
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,643
He's my manager. What if he goes
to a studio, to the Palm or Spago...

493
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:11,452
tells people,
"I love Richard but he's high maintenance"?

494
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:12,807
And what if he does?

495
00:25:12,893 --> 00:25:15,009
I spent seven years
getting my life together...

496
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:18,768
and now they can think I'm a fucking,
you know, sex maniac or drinking again.

497
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:21,492
No, you won't get
<i>the remake of From Here To Eternity.</i>

498
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:24,246
I thought I had dark secrets?
What the hell is this about?

499
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,609
- It's not a dark secret.
- Larry David selling cars is not a secret?

500
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:30,810
Is that a cashmere sweater?
This guy had the same one.

501
00:25:30,893 --> 00:25:34,329
- Of course it's a cashmere sweater.
- Is that 100% cashmere?

502
00:25:34,413 --> 00:25:37,166
- What are you doing here?
- Is that 100% cashmere?

503
00:25:37,253 --> 00:25:40,370
- What, you don't believe me?
- Would you mind if I check the label?

504
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:41,966
My word's not good enough for you?

505
00:25:42,053 --> 00:25:43,566
- Let me just take a look.
- No.

506
00:25:43,653 --> 00:25:46,804
- I don't like people touching me.
- I won't touch you.

507
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:50,886
Stop it. I want you to call Jeff...

508
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,688
You call Jeff and tell him
I'm not high maintenance.

509
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:55,843
What the hell is going on here?

510
00:25:56,173 --> 00:25:58,368
That's it, Larry, you're fired.

511
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:02,883
- Happy?
- Christ.

512
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:10,731
- I had that sale.
- I'm happy for you, Larry.

513
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:12,731
- I had that guy.
- You're fired.

514
00:26:12,813 --> 00:26:16,522
I locked him up and I wish
you could have heard it. It was beautiful.

515
00:26:16,613 --> 00:26:17,602
Leave.

516
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:27,366
- Hi.
- Hello!

517
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:30,604
- What are you doing home so early?
- I got fired.

518
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:33,884
- You did?
- I got the boot!

519
00:26:33,973 --> 00:26:36,407
- Why'd you get fired?
- I got 86ed.

520
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:40,291
He's checking for the house sound.

521
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:43,012
- Yeah, hi, I'm Jim.
- Hi, I'm Larry.

522
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:45,243
I've checked all over the house...

523
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:49,042
and I can't find the house sound
that you were talking about.

524
00:26:51,213 --> 00:26:56,162
- Tell him what it sounds like again, Larry.
- It's like a camera whirring.

525
00:26:58,013 --> 00:27:01,244
- You sure it's not the ocean?
- It's not the ocean, I know the ocean.

526
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,927
Sorry, I just haven't found anything.

527
00:27:04,013 --> 00:27:07,801
You don't really hear it very well
until after 10:00 at night.

528
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:09,884
When we're in bed, that's when I hear it.

529
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:13,204
I don't hear it during the day.
Can you come back tonight?

530
00:27:13,293 --> 00:27:14,851
Wait, what?

531
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:19,290
Yeah, I could,
I just have to call and get a sitter.

532
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:21,967
- Great.
<i>- Yeah, if it's trouble...</i>

533
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:24,521
He just says he has to call and get a sitter.

534
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:27,969
- That's no problem, I can just do that.
- It makes perfect sense to me.

535
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:30,931
Why don't we discuss this
and we will let you know, okay?

536
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:32,048
Okay.

537
00:27:51,133 --> 00:27:53,408
I think I'm going to call
Jason Alexander tomorrow.

538
00:27:53,493 --> 00:27:56,053
You are? That is good news.

539
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,202
- You like that?
- Yeah.

540
00:27:57,293 --> 00:27:59,807
- We'll go over the show, and...
- That's so good.

541
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:02,566
Maybe pitch it to
some networks or something.

542
00:28:02,653 --> 00:28:06,123
Why not? Look at you, back in the saddle.

543
00:28:06,213 --> 00:28:10,047
- Maybe I'll call him right now.
- You can't call him now, it's 10:45.

544
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,612
It's 45 minutes past the cutoff.

545
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:14,287
So what? You get like an hour
dispensation for good news.

546
00:28:14,373 --> 00:28:17,251
- Who told you that?
- Who told me that? It's common knowledge.

547
00:28:17,333 --> 00:28:19,608
- What are you saying?
- That's common knowledge?

548
00:28:19,693 --> 00:28:20,887
Everybody knows that.

549
00:28:20,973 --> 00:28:23,441
What happens with deaths and babies?
You go all night.

550
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,922
- This isn't a baby.
- It's still good news.

551
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:27,765
Quiet!

552
00:28:28,253 --> 00:28:29,481
Sorry!

553
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:38,570
- It's news that can wait till the morning.
- Shut up, he's trying to work in there.
