1
00:00:14,294 --> 00:00:17,923
No, don't eat cookies,
it's almost time for dinner.

2
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:19,794
Why don't we go out?

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,962
- Chinese?
- Chinese, that would be great.

4
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:24,833
We could stop and get a drink first.

5
00:00:24,905 --> 00:00:27,567
What do you mean
stop and have a drink first?

6
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,508
<i>We can stop at...</i>
You know where I want to go?

7
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:34,809
Casa Del Mar,
the fancy restaurant by the water.

8
00:00:35,382 --> 00:00:37,350
We can stop and have a leisurely drink.

9
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:40,409
Are you kidding?
You can have a drink at the restaurant.

10
00:00:40,487 --> 00:00:42,148
No, but this will be nice.

11
00:00:42,222 --> 00:00:46,283
It'll be just a few hours of hanging out,
having a drink.

12
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:49,452
You know, first you want to just stop off...

13
00:00:49,529 --> 00:00:52,828
and have a drink there,
and then get back in the car...

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,895
and then drive to the restaurant.

15
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:59,029
It seems like you should just go
and get the drink at the restaurant, no?

16
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,470
I would like to stop off
and have a drink on the way.

17
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:05,670
It's the same drink,
what's the difference where you have it?

18
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:08,715
It's a different atmosphere.
<i>You know what...</i>

19
00:01:09,015 --> 00:01:11,245
I don't understand,
it's a different atmosphere?

20
00:01:11,318 --> 00:01:12,615
<i>- What, I thought...</i>
- Yeah.

21
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:15,553
But it's the drink, isn't it?
They have it at the restaurant.

22
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,681
What's the difference
what the atmosphere is?

23
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:20,454
- It's a big difference.
- But don't you want to eat?

24
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:21,653
I do want to eat...

25
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,390
but I would like to sit
and have a drink and socialize...

26
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:25,897
and not have food passing by us.

27
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,298
I don't see how you could sit
and have a drink...

28
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:30,996
knowing that you want to leave to eat.

29
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:32,663
When you're thinking about food...

30
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:35,537
how can you sit and relax
<i>and have a drink, it doesn't...</i>

31
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,600
You're missing the whole point of the drink.

32
00:01:37,677 --> 00:01:40,771
That's it! What is the point of the drink?
I am missing the point.

33
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:44,613
You're at a place where everyone's sitting,
having cocktails and socializing.

34
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:48,745
Then why even go to the restaurant?
If it isn't socializing, then why go there?

35
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:49,846
I don't wanna go.

36
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:51,891
Fine, we'll just get takeout food, great.

37
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:53,289
- That's fine. Good.
- Yeah.

38
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:00,396
- Here you are, sir.
- Thank you very much.

39
00:02:00,467 --> 00:02:01,695
- And here's your food.
- Okay.

40
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:02,792
- Enjoy your dinner.
- Thank you.

41
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:03,893
Bye-bye.

42
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:09,841
<i>Rolling, rolling, rolling</i>

43
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,970
All right.

44
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:13,343
<i>Keep those doggies rolling</i>

45
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:14,937
<i>Rawhide!</i>

46
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:17,506
Julia Louis-Dreyfus called.

47
00:02:17,584 --> 00:02:18,846
Okay.

48
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:23,450
- Did you tell her the idea yet?
- No, I'm gonna pitch it to her tomorrow.

49
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:24,956
She's gonna love it, I bet.

50
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,617
- Yeah?
- Yeah, don't you think?

51
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,958
- We'll see.
- My elbow is killing me.

52
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:31,858
This tennis elbow.

53
00:02:31,932 --> 00:02:34,833
Yeah, you know what you should do,
you should call Jojo.

54
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:37,734
Didn't you say he leaves
marks on you sometimes?

55
00:02:37,804 --> 00:02:40,500
He leaves some black and blue marks,
but he'll fix it.

56
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:45,136
- What is this? Is this garlic noodles?
- That does not look like kung pao shrimp.

57
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:46,702
This isn't our food.

58
00:02:49,349 --> 00:02:51,749
Did you check the order before you left?

59
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:55,720
Yeah, I did, but I decided
to take the wrong food home.

60
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:57,484
Thank you for inquiring.

61
00:02:57,557 --> 00:03:01,687
I guess you'll just have to run back there...

62
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:04,121
and get the right order.

63
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,330
What a pain in the ass.

64
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,458
<i>If you could hurry, that would be great...</i>

65
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:09,627
I'll try.

66
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:12,604
- I'm really hungry.
- Idiots.

67
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:24,748
- Yes, sir, how can I help you?
- We got the wrong order here.

68
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:28,720
- I'm so sorry, are you David?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:33,088
That man just brought back your order.
This is it, I'm so sorry that happened.

70
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:34,551
Sir?

71
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:37,128
Okay, this is mine?

72
00:03:37,197 --> 00:03:39,563
- This is yours.
- Okay, thank you.

73
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,930
You're welcome.

74
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,933
My God.

75
00:03:47,107 --> 00:03:49,575
- Here's your food.
- What?

76
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:51,804
- We got our orders mixed up.
- God.

77
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:54,346
You almost had my kung pao shrimp.

78
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:56,177
- How are you?
- Good, how are you doing?

79
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:57,511
- Good, everything good?
- Yeah.

80
00:03:57,584 --> 00:03:58,744
- Cheryl good?
- Yeah.

81
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:02,083
- How's everything at HBO?
- Tremendous, just terrific.

82
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:03,179
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:03,256 --> 00:04:05,986
Wonderful, couldn't be better.

84
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:07,651
Good.

85
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:11,061
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah.

86
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:22,507
I'm back.

87
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:24,737
Good.

88
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:28,437
- Good.
- That was really pleasant.

89
00:04:28,515 --> 00:04:31,348
Thank you so much. It'll be worth it.

90
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:37,154
You know who I ran into? Allan Wasserman.
That's who had our food, Allan Wasserman.

91
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:41,956
- Do I know him?
- The guy from HBO, the president of HBO.

92
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:48,192
Yeah, remember two years ago,
I got out of that special.

93
00:04:48,268 --> 00:04:51,635
I told him my stepfather got in an accident.

94
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:57,006
Yeah, why did you make up
a lie about a stepfather?

95
00:04:57,077 --> 00:05:00,444
- You don't even have a stepfather.
- I just thought it was a better lie.

96
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,674
'Cause if you make up a lie
about a stepfather...

97
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:04,944
you'll be believed, don't you think?

98
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:09,255
- That must've been awkward.
- Yeah, it was pretty awkward.

99
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,847
But he didn't mention
anything, and neither did I...

100
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,415
so I don't know.

101
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,189
- Want some noodles?
- Get some of this kung pao shrimp.

102
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,697
Where's all the shrimp here?

103
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,830
Where's all the shrimp?
There's only three shrimp.

104
00:05:27,774 --> 00:05:30,937
<i>- In that giant container, there's...</i>
- Yeah, three shrimp.

105
00:05:31,678 --> 00:05:35,011
- There's usually more than that.
- There's usually, like, 10.

106
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,245
You can have them.

107
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:40,685
Did he take the shrimp?

108
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,116
I'll bet he took the shrimp.

109
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,987
- Wasserman?
- Yeah.

110
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,224
He was probably hungry.
He got the container.

111
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,763
He knew, he saw it wasn't his food.

112
00:05:51,898 --> 00:05:54,458
And he ate shrimp,
and then brought it back.

113
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,661
Would he really do something
like that, though?

114
00:05:56,736 --> 00:06:00,228
What do you mean, "Would he really?"
There's three shrimp in there.

115
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:04,507
I really don't want
to be eating after somebody else.

116
00:06:04,577 --> 00:06:08,570
I mean, it's just the whole notion of
the guy gets the wrong order of food...

117
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:10,878
and takes food that doesn't belong to him.

118
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,284
And then returns it?
What, thinking we're not gonna notice this?

119
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:20,022
The guy took our shrimp.

120
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,254
Good, nice move.

121
00:06:25,065 --> 00:06:27,829
Hi, Lar. It's good to see you.

122
00:06:27,901 --> 00:06:30,995
- Yeah, good to see you.
- Did it take you a long time to get here?

123
00:06:31,071 --> 00:06:33,631
Maybe about 25 minutes, half hour.

124
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:35,174
- My God, that traffic.
- Yeah.

125
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,799
Next time, I'll come to your office.

126
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:39,174
- No, what are you kidding?
- No, I'm not kidding.

127
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,770
- I'll come next time.
- I'm happy to come to your office.

128
00:06:41,848 --> 00:06:44,009
You don't have to come,
I'm happy to come here.

129
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,312
No, we can go back and forth.

130
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:48,548
We don't need back and forth,
we'll just do forth. Don't need back.

131
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,646
You've turned into a very nice man.

132
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,624
I'm a lovely gentleman.

133
00:06:53,593 --> 00:06:57,393
- So, what's this idea? I'm dying to hear it.
- All right, here's the idea.

134
00:06:57,464 --> 00:06:59,898
- Yeah.
- You play an actress...

135
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:05,736
who was on a big TV show,
<i>a big hit show, like a Seinfeld.</i>

136
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,067
And when the show ends...

137
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,099
the actress has trouble getting work.

138
00:07:11,177 --> 00:07:14,578
Because everybody identifies her
with this character...

139
00:07:15,281 --> 00:07:16,976
who she played on the show.

140
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,178
- Right.
- Let's say she played "Evelyn," okay?

141
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:21,277
Okay.

142
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:26,291
And she grows to hate the character,
and she becomes embittered and hostile.

143
00:07:26,359 --> 00:07:29,192
All these people
who are yelling out, "Evelyn" all the time...

144
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,662
and everybody wants her to do Evelyn.

145
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:34,427
And she can't get work because of Evelyn.

146
00:07:35,034 --> 00:07:37,764
- And that's the show?
- That's the show.

147
00:07:37,837 --> 00:07:41,000
- That's a pretty interesting idea.
- You think so?

148
00:07:41,074 --> 00:07:44,703
The thing that I love about it is that,
you know, this does happen to me.

149
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:47,178
And it happens to you,
you're able to deal with this.

150
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,714
"Elaine, Elaine, are you Elaine?"

151
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:50,716
That happened to me last week,
I was skiing.

152
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,446
<i>"Evelyn, Evelyn." It'll be on the series.</i>

153
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,612
<i>"Hey, Evelyn."</i>

154
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:56,587
That's a good name for the series.

155
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:58,351
<i>How about this: Aren't You Evelyn?</i>

156
00:07:58,424 --> 00:07:59,482
<i>Aren't You Evelyn?</i>

157
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,288
That's pretty good.

158
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:04,691
I mean, I think it's a really funny idea.

159
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:07,562
But I wonder if it's
better suited for somebody...

160
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,727
you know, like Jason.

161
00:08:10,036 --> 00:08:11,833
<i>Jason, I don't...</i>

162
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:14,169
- Let me tell you why.
- This isn't Jason at all.

163
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,232
<i>- Because...</i>
- I think he's completely wrong for it.

164
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,835
<i>I mean, but he played such a...</i>

165
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:23,081
I don't know, an idiot on the show.

166
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:27,146
Maybe it would be better suited
for somebody like Jason.

167
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,053
I could see you being
more frustrated than Jason...

168
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,489
'cause you know how many
different things you can do.

169
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,617
Yeah, that's true.

170
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:35,923
Really, this is all he can do,
between you and me.

171
00:08:35,995 --> 00:08:37,519
<i>Yeah, you know, I'm more...</i>

172
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:39,656
- Yeah, you're more versatile.
- Versatile.

173
00:08:39,732 --> 00:08:43,065
- That's why I see it for you.
- Yeah, all right, I like this idea a lot.

174
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:44,569
- You do?
- Yeah, I like it.

175
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:48,767
- Good, I'm so relieved.
- So let's pitch it to HBO.

176
00:08:49,108 --> 00:08:50,166
At HBO?

177
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:53,508
I want to be able to say "fuck," you know.
<i>And I wanna say...</i>

178
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,343
What's the big deal about saying "fuck"?

179
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:56,480
<i>"Cocksucker."</i>

180
00:08:56,482 --> 00:08:57,676
You don't need to say that.

181
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,776
Actually, I do.
I haven't really gotten to say that a lot.

182
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,948
I haven't. I would like<i>
to be able to say that. "Fuck."</i>

183
00:09:04,324 --> 00:09:07,589
Besides, I have a little problem with that...

184
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,459
the guy who runs it up there,
Allan Wasserman.

185
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,054
- The president?
- Yeah.

186
00:09:12,131 --> 00:09:13,155
What problem?

187
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,258
I think he's bad, I'm not gonna go into why.

188
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:18,634
- I just don't think he's a good guy.
- What if we didn't deal with him?

189
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:20,536
Let me tell you why I'm bringing this up.

190
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:24,703
I've got a friend, a pretty good friend,
Michael Halbreich, who works there.

191
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:27,268
- I don't know if you know him.
- Gay guy?

192
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,841
Gay, no, he's not gay, he's married.

193
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:31,713
- Michael Halbreich?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:34,516
- Really?
- Yeah, he's married.

195
00:09:34,587 --> 00:09:37,988
- I could have sworn he was gay, that guy.
- No, I've known him for years.

196
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:40,355
I'm in a poker game
<i>with Michael and his wife...</i>

197
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,326
That's great, I wish I was in a poker game.

198
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,420
Why don't you join?

199
00:09:44,497 --> 00:09:47,898
A couple who's in the game,
they're going to the Galapagos Islands.

200
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,595
It would be great
if you and Cheryl would like to play...

201
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,570
'cause we actually need another couple.

202
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,106
You know, I'll ask Cheryl.

203
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:56,505
I mean, I'll play even if she doesn't want to.

204
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:59,545
Okay, yeah, ask her,
and then you could also get to know him.

205
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,045
- He's a nice guy.
- Okay.

206
00:10:01,114 --> 00:10:04,641
I'd just like to put HBO in the mix,
I'd really like to.

207
00:10:05,018 --> 00:10:08,146
- All right, HBO.
- All right, exciting.

208
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:25,337
- Thataway, Jojo. Get in there.
<i>- Shut...</i>

209
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:26,804
- Get in there.
- My God.

210
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:30,832
She has a very high tolerance for pain,
this woman, don't worry about it.

211
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:32,905
<i>Wait, that's...</i>

212
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:36,812
Julia Louis-Dreyfus invited us to play poker.

213
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:38,282
<i>She's in this poker game...</i>

214
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:40,979
Okay, do we have to talk
about this right now?

215
00:10:41,788 --> 00:10:43,619
- We're finished.
- That's it?

216
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,818
- That's it, just got to wash my hands.
- Thank you.

217
00:10:46,893 --> 00:10:48,554
The man's an artist.

218
00:10:48,628 --> 00:10:51,256
- My God.
- What happened, he hurt you?

219
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:54,323
My God.

220
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,369
What do you got? That's nothing.

221
00:10:57,437 --> 00:11:00,133
That's gonna be a lot worse in two days.

222
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:03,733
I really don't like that you're taking
so much pleasure in this.

223
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:10,481
<i>Anybody have a cough drop?</i>

224
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:13,417
- Would you like a Fisherman's Friend?
- Yeah, sure.

225
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
- All right, have one of these.
- Thank you.

226
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:18,288
- Do you want one, Julia?
- All right, thank you.

227
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,517
- Would you like to try one?
- No.

228
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:23,452
I can't believe we're here.

229
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:24,893
I know, this is amazing.

230
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,194
- Pitching another show.
- It's exciting.

231
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:28,790
The two of us, doing this together?

232
00:11:28,868 --> 00:11:30,460
Lord, I don't like this at all.

233
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:31,560
Hang on a minute.

234
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,265
I like it a lot.
How long have you been her manager?

235
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,173
<i>- Three...</i>
- No, almost, actually four years.

236
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:40,406
Is it four now?
Time flies when you're having fun.

237
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
Yeah.

238
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,278
Even when you're not.

239
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:46,215
Tell me what you think of this, okay?

240
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:47,343
What?

241
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,218
My wife and I are going
out for Chinese food the other night.

242
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,053
She said that she wants
to stop off for a drink first.

243
00:11:53,126 --> 00:11:54,957
I don't get this.

244
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:58,759
Why park the car, go into this hotel...

245
00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:02,259
have the drink, then come back out...

246
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:04,895
get in the car again, drive to the restaurant.

247
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:06,801
It seems like a huge waste of time.

248
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:08,568
You can get a drink at the restaurant.

249
00:12:08,641 --> 00:12:10,905
- It's sort of an old-fashioned...
- Yeah, it is.

250
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:12,535
...romantic idea, don't you think?

251
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:13,636
Yeah, it's lovely.

252
00:12:13,713 --> 00:12:15,237
We're just going out to eat.

253
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:17,680
- Did you go out for the drink?
- No.

254
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,910
Was she mad?

255
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:21,681
Very annoyed.
We're not on good terms because of it.

256
00:12:21,754 --> 00:12:23,517
I think you were totally right.

257
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,420
Yeah, see?

258
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:27,959
It makes no sense,
unless you're trying to get laid.

259
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:30,427
And maybe that's what she was trying to do.

260
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:33,488
Maybe Cheryl wanted to get laid.

261
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:35,466
Okay, I got your point.

262
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:37,935
Listen, the two of you will take this.

263
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:41,536
You know, I'll introduce it,
and you'll run with it, okay?

264
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:44,776
- They're ready for you guys now.
- Then here we go then.

265
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:45,970
You ready?

266
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,309
There they are.

267
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:52,749
- Hi, how are you?
- Good to see you, too.

268
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,616
Hi, Michael, how are you?

269
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,584
- Good.
- European.

270
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:59,386
- Yes, very.
- Hi, how are you?

271
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,553
- Everybody, good to see you.
- You know Michael Halbreich?

272
00:13:02,628 --> 00:13:04,926
- Yeah, hi, Michael.
- Larry, nice to see you again.

273
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,487
- Very cute.
- I have it in blue, too.

274
00:13:06,566 --> 00:13:08,727
I gave Melissa one of those, it's really nice.

275
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:09,961
- Hi, honey.
- You all right?

276
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,698
Hi, Larry, it's Judy. It's nice to see you here.

277
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:15,502
It took about 45 minutes for that, didn't it?

278
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,437
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry, Larry.

279
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,738
You gotta make the nice.

280
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:20,278
- Yeah.
- Gotta make the nice.

281
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:23,577
- You've gotta make the nice.
- How's the stepfather doing?

282
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:26,581
- Good.
- He's doing better now?

283
00:13:27,587 --> 00:13:30,522
- Yeah.
- Yeah, miraculous recovery he had?

284
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:35,293
All right, so talk to me.

285
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:38,453
We got a big show to pitch for you,
big show.

286
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,999
- All right.
- Something different and interesting.

287
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:45,970
- I'll let the principals take care of it for you.
- All right, Larry and I were talking...

288
00:13:46,038 --> 00:13:49,201
about this concept recently,
and I think it's pretty exciting.

289
00:13:49,275 --> 00:13:51,641
All right, you start, and then I'll, you know...

290
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:53,702
do a dance and cheerlead and stuff.

291
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:59,677
How were the garlic noodles,
the other night?

292
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:03,251
- What?
- The garlic noodles?

293
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:08,683
- I didn't touch your garlic noodles.
- I didn't say you touched my garlic noodles.

294
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,662
- They were your garlic noodles.
- Right.

295
00:14:11,931 --> 00:14:13,421
But you did touch the shrimp.

296
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:15,262
What are you talking about?

297
00:14:16,569 --> 00:14:19,231
Right, Al?
I ordered Chinese food the other night...

298
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,829
and we got our orders mixed up.

299
00:14:20,907 --> 00:14:25,276
And when I got my order back from him,
about seven or eight shrimp were missing.

300
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:26,538
No.

301
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:29,445
The shrimp mysteriously disappeared.

302
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:32,382
- I didn't touch your shrimp.
- Who gives a shit, come on, Larry.

303
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:33,850
I don't want to talk about shrimp.

304
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,582
I would understand
that you don't want to talk about it.

305
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:39,090
Look, Larry, you got your food,
I got my food.

306
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:42,559
Yeah, you got your full order,
I got mine minus seven shrimp.

307
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,926
You counted the shrimp,
you're a shrimp-counter now.

308
00:14:44,997 --> 00:14:46,965
It's pretty obvious when there's two shrimp.

309
00:14:47,033 --> 00:14:50,196
- Listen, I didn't touch your fucking shrimp.
- Really?

310
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:53,727
If you want shrimp, take your $475 million,
go buy a fucking shrimp boat.

311
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:55,740
- Yeah, okay.
- Larry, come on.

312
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:58,902
He's gonna walk out now.
This is what he's famous for.

313
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:02,573
Nothing changes in 25 years with this guy.
Same shit.

314
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,747
I'm really sorry. I'm so sorry.

315
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:12,916
What where you doing? What was that?

316
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:16,291
- He insulted me.
- How?

317
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:18,523
He implied that I was lying
about my stepfather.

318
00:15:18,598 --> 00:15:21,829
- You don't have a stepfather.
- But I didn't like the implication.

319
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:24,096
The implication
for your imaginary stepfather?

320
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,536
How can he insult you
about somebody who's imaginary?

321
00:15:26,606 --> 00:15:28,665
<i>- For goodness sake...</i>
<i>- Because it was...</i>

322
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,437
Let me just ask you something,
what is the shrimp business?

323
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:34,877
You know, he got my container by mistake
from the Chinese restaurant...

324
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:36,608
and he took out eight shrimp from it...

325
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,843
that didn't belong to him,
and gave it back to me.

326
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:41,148
As if I wasn't gonna know
that he took the shrimp?

327
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,744
What does he think, I'm a moron?

328
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:47,225
Larry, everybody steals shrimp,
and everybody lies about it.

329
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,654
This is Hollywood.
You got to apologize to this guy.

330
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,425
- Please.
- You have to apologize.

331
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:54,830
We want to make this here.
I want to make this here.

332
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,334
- Go apologize.
- I'll tell you something else, too.

333
00:15:57,403 --> 00:15:59,667
You have to get yourself
into major psychoanalysis.

334
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,639
I'm in analysis, it doesn't do anything.

335
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:03,470
- What kind of analysis?
- Does nothing.

336
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:04,770
Apparently not.

337
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:08,280
Have you talked to him
about your imaginary stepfather?

338
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:10,976
I'll tell you this right now.

339
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,247
I'm going back to that restaurant,
and I'll go count the shrimp...

340
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,379
and ask them
how many they put in the container.

341
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:19,891
- I'll bet you there's eight missing, at least.
- You do that!

342
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:28,298
Everyone, the game is five-card stud.
Everyone ante up there.

343
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:31,097
- So, Mickey, what do you do?
- I'm a dentist.

344
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,436
- I've been Brad and Julia's dentist for years.
- Really, Mickey, that is good to know...

345
00:16:35,508 --> 00:16:37,806
because I actually need a dentist,
mine just moved.

346
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,038
- Give Candy a call on Monday.
- I will.

347
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:43,912
You know, my dentist told me
I have the gums of a 25-year-old man.

348
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,914
I think it was about
the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.

349
00:16:50,156 --> 00:16:52,522
Everything's okay with you and Allan, right?

350
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:55,253
Larry, you guys are all
made up and everything?

351
00:16:55,328 --> 00:16:58,627
- Yes, we kissed and made up.
- This is the unfortunate shrimp incident?

352
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:00,757
- That's the one.
- I've been dying to hear this.

353
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,666
There was a mix up
at a Chinese takeout restaurant.

354
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:05,761
Larry got Allan's order, and Allan, Larry's.

355
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,330
I guess when they switched them back,
Allan had taken seven of your shrimp?

356
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,400
- That's my claim, yeah.
- Allegedly.

357
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:15,936
Right, and it turned into a big thing
and he stomped out of the meeting...

358
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:19,576
which I had never seen before.
I almost thought it was not real, but it was.

359
00:17:19,652 --> 00:17:21,916
I saw the Jackson Pollock movie
the night before...

360
00:17:21,987 --> 00:17:25,616
and I got very influenced
by the artist, you know.

361
00:17:25,991 --> 00:17:27,424
It was very impressive.

362
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:30,223
But everything's fine now,
and we're very delighted...

363
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:32,264
you guys are with HBO,
very happy to have you.

364
00:17:32,331 --> 00:17:34,458
- Where are we? I've lost...
- I'm out, she's out.

365
00:17:34,533 --> 00:17:36,091
I'm in.

366
00:17:36,469 --> 00:17:38,630
No, you're not out, sweetie, it's only two.

367
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:40,672
- God, okay.
- Okay, you're good.

368
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,332
All right, I'm such a ditz, okay.

369
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,707
So, Larry, how come you guys
didn't take the show to NBC...

370
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:47,405
with the history you guys have there?

371
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,381
- You want to answer that question?
- Because I wouldn't let him.

372
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:51,473
You wouldn't let him?

373
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:56,317
No, because GE will not take responsibility
for dumping the PCBs in the Hudson river.

374
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,222
And I say, why keep supporting them?
It's ridiculous.

375
00:17:59,291 --> 00:18:02,055
But the main thing
I would like to add is that on HBO...

376
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,959
<i>you can say "fuck."</i>

377
00:18:05,164 --> 00:18:07,962
<i>And that is, you know, very tempting...</i>

378
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:10,462
So you throw in a "fuck,"
you double your laughs.

379
00:18:10,536 --> 00:18:12,834
It's a crowd-pleaser.
"Fuck" is a crowd-pleaser.

380
00:18:12,905 --> 00:18:15,840
- You write it, and I'll say it.
<i>- The game is...</i>

381
00:18:15,908 --> 00:18:17,307
The game is Guts.

382
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:20,508
Card skill game, Brad.

383
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:22,604
No one appreciates Guts, what's the matter?

384
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:25,309
Let's play it.
Two-card Guts or three-card Guts?

385
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:26,908
Two-card Guts, two cards down.

386
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:31,719
- Whoever loses has to match the pot.
- We keep betting until people drop out.

387
00:18:35,494 --> 00:18:37,655
This is stiff. This could be record-breaking.

388
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,292
You show-biz types get a little richer
than the dental profession.

389
00:18:42,368 --> 00:18:44,962
I'll bet you there's about $800 in there,
you know that?

390
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:47,631
- I would say at least.
- It's all right.

391
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:49,334
Let's try.

392
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,706
- I'm in.
- Yes!

393
00:18:53,646 --> 00:18:55,409
- I'm out.
- I can't do it either.

394
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,244
I don't even have enough to cover that.

395
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,375
- Not a chance.
- No, I'm out.

396
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,147
- Go in, somebody.
- Yeah.

397
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,653
Melissa, come on.

398
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:05,982
- No, out.
- Michael!

399
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:08,889
- I'm here.
- In?

400
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,428
No, I'm out.

401
00:19:11,297 --> 00:19:14,596
Hall, you must go in,
she's gonna steal the whole thing.

402
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:18,000
- Don't let your wife steal this thing.
- How much is that?

403
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,335
- A lot.
- It's about, $700, $800 in there, come on.

404
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:24,807
- $700, $800.
- Are you serious?

405
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:27,004
I really can't do it, I've got nothing.

406
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:32,279
My God, look at that, holy cow.

407
00:19:32,351 --> 00:19:34,285
You've got to tell us how much that is.

408
00:19:34,353 --> 00:19:37,322
- What did you have?
- I had a 6 and a 10.

409
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:42,283
I can't believe you stole this pot.

410
00:19:42,728 --> 00:19:43,854
I'm sorry.

411
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,420
What a bluff,
I can't believe it. What did you have?

412
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:49,662
- I had nothing, 2 and a 4.
- That's what I had, nothing.

413
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:52,761
- What did you have?
- I am afraid to say I had an ace high.

414
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:55,432
- Ace high?
- Sweetie.

415
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:56,770
<i>I know, but...</i>

416
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:59,738
How could you not go in with an ace high?

417
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:02,271
You cunt, what a cunt!

418
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,215
I can't believe
that you didn't go in with that.

419
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,078
<i>I just thought she...</i>

420
00:20:09,154 --> 00:20:11,748
What a hand,
that's a great hand for this game.

421
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,092
How could you not go in with an ace high?

422
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:21,689
I think that's
kind of a misogynist thing to say.

423
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,098
Come on, I'm kidding around.

424
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:26,535
On behalf of the women at this table,
and myself, I am offended by that.

425
00:20:26,605 --> 00:20:28,095
Please, we're playing poker here.

426
00:20:28,173 --> 00:20:30,641
That kind of language
is not allowed in a game...

427
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,336
in a decent game.

428
00:20:32,978 --> 00:20:36,311
That's so unacceptable, that's not okay.

429
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,385
It's okay, I'm fine. It's fine.

430
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,357
It's not fine.
You know what, time to go, how about that?

431
00:20:46,258 --> 00:20:49,056
Yeah, I think I'm gonna call it a night...

432
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:51,255
and the Parishes are back next week, right?

433
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,664
- Yeah, they're back from the Galapagos.
- It was nice meeting you guys, thank you.

434
00:20:55,734 --> 00:20:56,996
Thank you so much.

435
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:00,004
<i>- I'm gonna call you about my...</i>
- You do that, call Candy.

436
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:03,269
- Bye, thanks for coming.
- It was nice meeting you.

437
00:21:03,342 --> 00:21:05,037
I'm sorry if I offended anyone.

438
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,578
Thanks for coming you guys,
it was great to see you.

439
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:09,773
Yeah, we'll see you next week.

440
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:15,247
So I guess
we probably won't be invited back...

441
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:17,551
to their poker night.

442
00:21:17,623 --> 00:21:19,887
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- You think?

443
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,984
- I can't believe you did that.
- Come on.

444
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:24,495
You just shouted out
the C-word in front of women...

445
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:26,053
<i>in front of other people...</i>

446
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:28,895
It's a word you use
when somebody doesn't act manly.

447
00:21:28,968 --> 00:21:31,334
And he didn't act manly,
he should've gone in.

448
00:21:31,403 --> 00:21:33,030
He should've gone in with that ace.

449
00:21:33,105 --> 00:21:35,437
I think there are other words
that you could use...

450
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:36,997
besides that one.

451
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:40,803
Maybe in retrospect,<i>
I should've said, "Pussy."</i>

452
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,847
<i>- Jeez, I can't be...</i>
- I'm really shocked.

453
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:49,080
I can't believe that guy
called me a misogynist.

454
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:51,384
- I know.
- Nobody ever called me that before.

455
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:54,290
Maybe you are.
Maybe, I'm learning things about you.

456
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,659
Maybe I am a misogynist.
Maybe I like to beat my wife a little bit.

457
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,756
- Wait, no! Larry!
- You little bitch.

458
00:22:06,238 --> 00:22:08,536
Okay, I'll be good, I promise.

459
00:22:09,975 --> 00:22:12,671
- Buckle up!
- I'm buckling.

460
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:22,946
And Wasserman says
this is our last chance. This is it.

461
00:22:23,022 --> 00:22:24,649
'Cause of what you said to Halbreich.

462
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,351
All of the women at HBO,
they don't want to work with you.

463
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:29,894
- That's ridiculous.
- They think you're a misogynist.

464
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:33,489
- 'Cause I called the guy a cunt, so what!
- 'Cause you called the guy a cunt.

465
00:22:33,565 --> 00:22:36,693
Big deal, I call men pricks all the time,
men want to work with me.

466
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:37,793
Cunt's worse.

467
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,963
It's not worse,
pricks and cunts, they're equal.

468
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,475
- Pricks, cunts, come on. They balance out.
- No, cunt's much heavier.

469
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:46,306
- Why is cunt heavier?
- I never questioned, it just is.

470
00:22:46,378 --> 00:22:51,111
- That's sexist to me, come on.
- Michael Halbreich took a leave of absence.

471
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:53,246
What do you mean?

472
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:55,513
From you calling him a cunt,
he's shell-shocked...

473
00:22:55,587 --> 00:22:58,055
and he's examining everything in his life.

474
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,987
Taking a leave of absence.

475
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:05,387
- Man, is that so?
- Yeah.

476
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:08,226
Shit, you know...

477
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,768
I thought he was
one of those effeminate heterosexuals.

478
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:13,134
There's no such thing
as an effeminate heterosexual.

479
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:16,368
You're either gay or you're not gay.
He was gay, he's gay.

480
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:19,370
Hi, would you like to be seated?

481
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:21,879
No, actually,
I'm a little curious about something...

482
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:23,244
we're having a little dispute.

483
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:26,773
How many shrimp do you
generally put in the kung pao shrimp?

484
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:27,876
Eleven.

485
00:23:28,253 --> 00:23:32,212
- You always put in 11?
- We have a very strict policy about that.

486
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,557
Thank you very much.

487
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:41,525
- Hi, Mickey.
- So it's this Cheryl.

488
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,728
- Yes, good to see you again.
- Good to see you again.

489
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:49,568
- That was quite a poker game.
- Yes.

490
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:52,166
I don't think we ever had one like that.

491
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:56,203
Yeah, Larry can get
a little carried away sometimes, I guess.

492
00:23:56,281 --> 00:23:58,272
<i>He takes his poker very...</i>

493
00:24:02,955 --> 00:24:06,948
This bruise, there's a funny story here.

494
00:24:09,161 --> 00:24:11,925
Cheryl, you know, I barely know you...

495
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:15,764
but when we were coming
out of the poker game the other night...

496
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:18,635
we saw into your car...

497
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:21,970
and we saw Larry hitting you.

498
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:34,746
Larry and I do a little bit sometimes
where he acts like he's punching me...

499
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,981
<i>and I act like, "I'm getting hurt."</i>

500
00:24:37,055 --> 00:24:40,684
<i>- We just kind of...</i>
- You'll have to excuse me...

501
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:44,422
I don't deal with this kind of thing often...

502
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:47,932
but if you would like to talk
with me about this...

503
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,059
in this cubicle...

504
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:53,494
we have patient-doctor confidentiality.

505
00:24:53,972 --> 00:24:56,702
And that applies to dentists, too?

506
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,304
I think so.

507
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:05,148
I think we're on the wrong page here.

508
00:25:05,217 --> 00:25:07,811
Yeah, I have
<i>a very good social-worker friend...</i>

509
00:25:07,886 --> 00:25:11,447
Mickey, listen,
this is a complete misunderstanding.

510
00:25:11,523 --> 00:25:13,184
There's no misunderstanding.

511
00:25:13,258 --> 00:25:16,193
What we saw
Larry do to Michael at that card game...

512
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:20,129
there's no misunderstanding
that I saw him beating you in your car.

513
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:24,636
I have seen Larry David in action,
and that man is an animal...

514
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,961
and he has to be stopped.

515
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:30,365
Larry?

516
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,979
<i>So that's it, it's all over at HBO.</i>

517
00:25:36,882 --> 00:25:41,410
Dentist got in touch with Wasserman,
thinks I'm a wife-beater.

518
00:25:41,987 --> 00:25:43,284
He thinks I'm a wife-beater.

519
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,619
- I mean, it's so crazy.
- I know.

520
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:49,619
- There's other networks, right?
- This is not the end of the world, HBO.

521
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:52,425
We'll go to ABC. I don't have to be at HBO.

522
00:25:52,497 --> 00:25:54,931
- No.
- It's not TV? It's TV.

523
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,161
What do they think people are watching?

524
00:25:57,502 --> 00:25:59,163
- Yeah.
- Watch it on TV.

525
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:01,331
Don't you? You don't go
to the movies to see it.

526
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,806
- How are we doing over here, folks?
- I think I'm done.

527
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,071
Can I get this out of the way for you? Great.

528
00:26:06,144 --> 00:26:07,168
- Delicious.
- You like it?

529
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:08,270
- Yeah.
- Great.

530
00:26:08,347 --> 00:26:10,815
How about dessert menu?
We got a lot of good stuff.

531
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:13,784
- Yeah, excellent.
- You know what, I think we'll take the bill.

532
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:18,016
- You sure? Okay, I'll be right back.
- Let's go to Shutters and get dessert there.

533
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:22,159
- Just get a change of scenery.
- You don't want dessert here?

534
00:26:22,227 --> 00:26:25,321
It would just be more fun
to go someplace else.

535
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,528
Relax by the beach.

536
00:26:29,167 --> 00:26:32,136
But we're already here.
We could have dessert in two minutes...

537
00:26:32,204 --> 00:26:35,731
- then we could...
- But it's not all about just the dessert.

538
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:38,638
- What's it about?
- It's a little bit of an adventure...

539
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,610
to go some place else
and see something new.

540
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:42,670
I don't know if that's any adventure, really.

541
00:26:42,748 --> 00:26:45,114
- That's an adventure.
- That's an adventure?

542
00:26:46,084 --> 00:26:48,109
You know what, fine.

543
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,412
- No, wait, I just don't get it.
- I mean, because it's ridiculous.

544
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,754
- We're having a meal.
- We're having a good time...

545
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:57,192
<i>- and I suggest to go to some...</i>
<i>- You're breaking up the good time...</i>

546
00:26:57,262 --> 00:26:58,957
You're breaking up the good time.

547
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:01,795
'Cause I feel like
I want a cup of coffee after I eat dinner.

548
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:04,836
I don't feel like getting up
and driving some place.

549
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:07,895
You know, Larry,
I would just like to go home.

550
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,468
Quick cup of decaf?

551
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,744
Can I get it to go?

552
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,718
That's different, though.

553
00:27:30,295 --> 00:27:32,092
- Are you Mrs. David?
- Yes, I am.

554
00:27:32,164 --> 00:27:34,064
Hi, I'm Linda Johnson from Social Services.

555
00:27:34,132 --> 00:27:37,101
We received a phone call
that there was some domestic violence...

556
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:38,397
going on in this household.

557
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:42,064
Actually, this is all a big misunderstanding.

558
00:27:43,008 --> 00:27:44,600
Yeah, this.

559
00:27:45,344 --> 00:27:47,369
Would you care to press charges?
