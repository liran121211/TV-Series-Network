1
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,949
How are you?

2
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:42,021
What are we doing here?
How come we didn't go to your office?

3
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:44,455
<i>I didn't go to my office yet...</i>

4
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:48,189
Hi, can I get you some coffee?

5
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:49,751
I'll have a decaf.

6
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:52,429
Thank you.

7
00:00:53,967 --> 00:00:56,026
"Can I get you some coffee?"

8
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:58,437
Wouldn't you love that?

9
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,166
I left Susie last night.

10
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:07,837
It was a whole big thing,
I got the hell out of there and I told her:

11
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:10,075
<i>"I'm going to a hotel, don't call me."</i>

12
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,344
Yeah.

13
00:01:11,418 --> 00:01:12,817
Holy cow.

14
00:01:12,886 --> 00:01:15,548
Yeah, I don't know
if it's gonna go any further...

15
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:18,250
than just a separation type situation.

16
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:20,452
I mean, it was a long time coming.

17
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:24,190
My problem is...

18
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:28,132
I don't know about
the divorce thing, because, you know...

19
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:31,927
I don't want her telling people about me,
or things to come out in court.

20
00:01:32,005 --> 00:01:34,974
I never broke the law,
you know, but personal things.

21
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,702
What kind of things? What do you mean?

22
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,210
Like sexual.

23
00:01:38,845 --> 00:01:42,440
You know, there's certain sexual things
that I like...

24
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:45,644
and I don't want Susie
yammering about what they are.

25
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:50,646
They're not horrible things
that involve anything that's against the law.

26
00:01:50,724 --> 00:01:51,952
<i>She's got some...</i>

27
00:01:52,025 --> 00:01:53,686
<i>Yeah, but, you know, just stuff...</i>

28
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,751
Stuff that you don't want her to repeat.

29
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,353
I don't want her to repeat.

30
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,921
This is sexual blackmail.

31
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,626
Sexual blackmail.

32
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,962
That is just awful.

33
00:02:02,035 --> 00:02:03,696
<i>That's, yeah, it's...</i>

34
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,206
That's why I've never done anything
even remotely kinky...

35
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,707
ever, with anyone.

36
00:02:08,775 --> 00:02:11,369
The craziest thing I've done:
I've been on the bottom.

37
00:02:11,445 --> 00:02:12,605
You know, that's it.

38
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:14,306
Not even with your wife.

39
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,973
Look what's happening with your wife.

40
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:17,812
You protected yourself ahead of time.

41
00:02:17,884 --> 00:02:20,717
I don't tell my wife anything,
I don't confide in my wife.

42
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:24,279
I don't trust anybody.
I just treat her like an acquaintance.

43
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:27,258
Do you think I want her
blabbing about me to people?

44
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:30,660
If we got divorced tomorrow,
she'd have nothing to say.

45
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:34,597
Or maybe she could say
I hate a couple of people, but that's it.

46
00:02:34,668 --> 00:02:37,068
I probably said a couple
of nasty things about you...

47
00:02:37,137 --> 00:02:38,229
<i>but other than that...</i>

48
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:39,704
That's assumed.

49
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,201
I do need you to do me a huge favor...

50
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:45,176
and that is go over by my house
and get my clothes.

51
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:47,236
Susie will know all about it.

52
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:48,941
She's gonna be there?

53
00:02:49,015 --> 00:02:52,849
Yeah, she probably will be there. You're not
pushing secret codes and all that.

54
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,982
She'll eat me alive.

55
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,249
Just grab my stuff.

56
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:58,314
<i>I feel like it's, like...</i>

57
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,627
It's almost worse
than confronting a mourner.

58
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:03,663
I owe you big time.

59
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,357
No, you don't owe me.

60
00:03:05,832 --> 00:03:07,663
I'll go later today.

61
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:18,903
My God. You would not believe this article.

62
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:22,706
You would not believe
what a political agenda AAA has.

63
00:03:23,016 --> 00:03:24,313
Honestly.

64
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:27,516
They just want more roads,
so there will be more cars...

65
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:30,385
so they'll have more members
and more money coming in.

66
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:33,187
They don't care about the environment...

67
00:03:33,493 --> 00:03:36,792
they don't care about pollution,
and we're members!

68
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:39,931
We're supporting this?

69
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:42,491
You should read this.

70
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:44,459
I'm going to.

71
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:48,104
Why are you so quiet?

72
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,973
I'm not quiet, you're reading.

73
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,405
Are you thinking about sex?

74
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,214
What the hell are you talking about? No.

75
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:03,815
Whenever you're quiet,
you're usually thinking about sex.

76
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,687
I'm not thinking about sex.

77
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:09,953
You're not thinking about
a little afternoon sex or something?

78
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:13,225
I'm just curious.

79
00:04:14,134 --> 00:04:15,863
It's kind of kinky.

80
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:19,896
- You think I'm kinky?
- Do you think you're kinky?

81
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,806
<i>You just said, "That's kind of kinky."</i>
Do you think I'm kinky?

82
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,400
I'm not kinky.

83
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,806
I'm just saying...

84
00:04:27,514 --> 00:04:29,812
you wanting to have sex in the afternoon
is crazy.

85
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:32,977
First of all, I didn't say I wanted
to have sex in the afternoon.

86
00:04:33,053 --> 00:04:34,543
You said that, why do you say that?

87
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:36,350
You got a lot going on in there.

88
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:39,017
Like, sick things going on,
is that what you think?

89
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:42,061
<i>- I didn't say "sick."</i>
- You think there are sick things going on?

90
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:44,596
Are there sick, twisted things going on?

91
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:46,288
No, not at all.

92
00:04:48,435 --> 00:04:51,029
I don't know where you get that from.

93
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,439
I'm just thinking about Jeff, that's all.

94
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:03,778
Forget I said anything. Sorry.

95
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:12,081
I got to go call Jason Alexander.

96
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,182
For the show?

97
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:14,726
Yeah, we're gonna get together.

98
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:18,195
Do you believe that I might be getting back
into network television?

99
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:19,925
I think it's great.

100
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,328
All right.

101
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:24,804
- He really loves the idea.
- That's good.

102
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,396
I mean, he can't stop talking about it.

103
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,642
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Jay?

104
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,578
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- L.D.

105
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:38,618
<i>- Lar?</i>
- What's shaking?

106
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:40,744
<i>We gonna hook up and talk about the show?</i>

107
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,082
That's what I'm calling about.

108
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,851
<i>Great, where do you want to do this?</i>

109
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:46,721
We could do it...

110
00:05:46,793 --> 00:05:49,728
we could do it here,
<i>we could do it in my office...</i>

111
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,923
<i>Would you mind coming here?</i>

112
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:56,068
Okay, all right, I'll meet you there.

113
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:58,696
<i>- You don't mind?</i>
- No, that will be fine.

114
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:00,740
<i>- 3:00, okay?</i>
- All right, I'll see you then.

115
00:06:00,807 --> 00:06:02,434
<i>- Okay, pal.</i>
- Bye.

116
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:06,869
Never fails:

117
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:11,110
Every time I have to go to a meeting,
or there's a meeting...

118
00:06:11,551 --> 00:06:15,112
it's never in my office, or my house.

119
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:19,386
I'm always going.
Nobody's ever coming to me.

120
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,417
I've never had a meeting
in my house or in my office.

121
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:26,431
I don't even need chairs in front of my desk.
Nobody ever sits there.

122
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:29,093
Every meeting, I'm traveling.

123
00:06:33,673 --> 00:06:36,164
I'd know that tush anywhere.

124
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,818
Jabroni, open the window.

125
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,222
- I'm awfully sorry.
- I didn't ask your opinion.

126
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,424
I've got three kids in there scared to death...

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,832
because some bald-headed turd
is shooting at them.

128
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:39,167
No, sir, we were playing
Cowboys and Indians.

129
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,400
Have you heard of Columbine?

130
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:45,738
It's idiots like you that cause this whole
society to be going crazy with violence.

131
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,473
- No, I'm not a violent...
- Shut up!

132
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:51,347
You know what you're looking at?
You are looking at 245 pounds of steel...

133
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,351
and drop-your-bony-butt-to-the-curb appeal.

134
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:57,287
I will body-slam you so hard
that you will poop your bald pants.

135
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,018
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

136
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:03,619
Don't you ever point another finger
at my kids again...

137
00:08:03,696 --> 00:08:07,029
because if you do, I will break it off,
and shove it up your sphincter.

138
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,000
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:08:55,815 --> 00:09:00,718
Yeah, 71350359.

140
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,685
That's impossible!

141
00:09:06,492 --> 00:09:07,823
When?

142
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:15,634
Okay, I want to get it reinstated.
No, she had no authorization to do that.

143
00:09:16,469 --> 00:09:18,437
No, that's my wife.

144
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:20,768
No, I don't want to cancel it.

145
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:28,242
All right, thank you very much.

146
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:58,110
- Dude, you're gonna bust your bumper.
- What?

147
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,509
You're gonna bust
right through your bumper.

148
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,447
It goes through, in front of your other tire.
Your back tire.

149
00:10:03,516 --> 00:10:05,848
And use the crank, it makes it easier.

150
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,648
- Which one?
- Right there.

151
00:10:08,755 --> 00:10:10,814
Which, there's two cranks.

152
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:26,130
You got to loosen the lug nuts first.

153
00:10:27,206 --> 00:10:29,367
You mean, before I lift it?

154
00:10:30,243 --> 00:10:32,404
Am I too close to the curb?

155
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:40,150
Do you know anything
about changing a tire?

156
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,984
You want to help me change a tire?
Could use a little help.

157
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:46,651
No? Need a little assistance.

158
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:49,820
I never took a shop class
and I need a little help.

159
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:52,524
I'm just coming flat out<i>
and saying, "Help me."</i>

160
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,933
Anybody want to help
a semi-retarded individual change a tire?

161
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:03,840
$25, $30? $30 to change a tire.

162
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,007
Okay, $35.

163
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,877
$35 to change this tire for me, right now.

164
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:13,282
I'll give you $35.
I'll give you $10 for a response.

165
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:16,220
For a verbal response, $10.

166
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:20,157
Anybody want to make $10
and respond verbally?

167
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:21,557
No?

168
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:30,802
<i>Then he calls me a bald turd.</i>

169
00:11:31,237 --> 00:11:34,297
<i>Five minutes later, my tire...</i>

170
00:11:34,974 --> 00:11:37,875
Jesus Christ, so, he cut it,
he slashed the tire.

171
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:40,640
- Slashed the tire, yeah.
- Son of a bitch.

172
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,476
The guy's coming with my car...

173
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,482
and I got to drive him to the gas station...

174
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,142
so I got to go downstairs.

175
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:47,618
Now?

176
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:50,019
Yeah, in a couple of minutes,
he's gonna be here.

177
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,386
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:54,858
All right, did you get
a license plate or anything?

179
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:57,794
<i>The guy's license is "14 THOR."</i>

180
00:11:57,864 --> 00:11:58,888
"14 THOR?"

181
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:01,126
And he looked like
a Norseman of some kind.

182
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,998
There's a guy,
there's a professional wrestler...

183
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:09,601
his first name's Thor, Thor Oleson.

184
00:12:09,776 --> 00:12:13,075
- Thor Oleson.
- That sounds familiar.

185
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:16,911
And I think
there's a big wrestling thing in town...

186
00:12:16,983 --> 00:12:18,883
at the Staples Center, it could be him.

187
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:21,419
<i>You're kidding? He's in L.A. For this...</i>

188
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:23,478
Yeah, who else would have a plate like that?

189
00:12:23,556 --> 00:12:24,818
He sounded like a wrestler...

190
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:27,223
<i>when he was standing over my window...</i>
That voice.

191
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,057
The description is exactly the same
as what you're saying.

192
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,858
Big, huge guy, long, blond hair.

193
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:35,332
- What's this thing?
- That?

194
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,830
- You ever get one of these?
- No, what are these?

195
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:41,670
Supposedly, I drove through
some sort of red light or an intersection...

196
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:42,935
and they have these photos now.

197
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:47,742
- Holy cow, they took your picture?
- Yeah, they had the thing up on the light.

198
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:52,745
I don't mind it if they actually catch you
doing something illegal, but not on camera.

199
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,644
Jesus, am I fat!

200
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,416
It looks like
you've put on a couple of pounds.

201
00:12:59,092 --> 00:13:00,150
Horrendous.

202
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,993
- I'm real sorry, what a waste of a day.
- No, listen.

203
00:13:04,063 --> 00:13:06,031
I'll tell you, you want to do it tomorrow?

204
00:13:06,099 --> 00:13:08,033
I don't think there's that much to go over.

205
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:11,195
Yeah, let's make a time with Vera,
you'll come back in tomorrow...

206
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,899
I got some openings in the afternoon,
and we'll kick it around for an hour.

207
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,407
We'll get into it.

208
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:20,879
I was kind of thinking maybe tomorrow
we could do it in my office in Santa Monica.

209
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,781
No, that's okay, let's not do that.

210
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:29,417
We'll do it here. This is good, this works.

211
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,550
It's kind of a lot easier for me...

212
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:37,123
if we could do it in Santa Monica.

213
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:40,791
I mean, you know, I came here today,
<i>so, tomorrow maybe...</i>

214
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:44,359
Yeah, it kind of works a little better for me
if you come here.

215
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:48,840
It's a little easier.
I can focus on it a little better.

216
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:52,139
I got a very nice office.
You'll be able to focus on anything.

217
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:53,610
I got a very comfortable chair.

218
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,342
I got blackboards up there,
we can write it all out.

219
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:58,940
You know, it'll be a breeze.

220
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:02,078
It's not the office, I'm very low maintenance.

221
00:14:02,822 --> 00:14:06,383
We were supposed to have a meeting.
And we haven't had a meeting.

222
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,894
Let's start by doing what we set out to do.

223
00:14:08,961 --> 00:14:11,657
Let's accomplish that,
let's have a meeting, at my office.

224
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:14,825
We did attempt to have the meeting,
and I did make the drive part.

225
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:17,392
So, the drive part, that I did do.

226
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,631
Yeah, the driving you got done good.

227
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:22,640
But that's a little out of balance now.
'Cause I did my drive.

228
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:25,871
It's not out of balance
because you were driving and I was waiting.

229
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,674
The important thing is we didn't meet.

230
00:14:27,747 --> 00:14:30,580
There's a lot to do while waiting
but nothing while driving.

231
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,709
Tomorrow, if you want
to drive to my office...

232
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:35,447
I'll be happy if you make me wait
for as long as you want.

233
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:38,422
- I know, but we made a plan.
- I understand.

234
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:40,982
We said we'll meet at my office
and have a meeting.

235
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,459
That's the plan...

236
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:44,655
that's not accomplished, let's accomplish it.

237
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,164
We attempted to have the meeting,
but it was aborted.

238
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:51,533
- Then we failed, let's have that meeting.
- We're having that meeting right now.

239
00:14:51,604 --> 00:14:54,869
This is not a meeting about the show.
This is about having a meeting.

240
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:57,967
I know, but the intention is the same,
don't you understand?

241
00:14:58,044 --> 00:15:02,300
- I drove here with the same intention.
- The driving is not the meeting, Larry.

242
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:05,045
The driving is what we're talking about.

243
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:09,112
You keep coming back
to this insane thing with driving.

244
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:12,616
- Driving is not the issue.
- I think driving is the issue.

245
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:14,555
We had a singular plan.

246
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,595
<i>We were gonna have</i>
<i>a meeting about the show.</i>

247
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:17,890
<i>So we're having a meeting.</i>

248
00:15:17,964 --> 00:15:21,525
<i>You could drive around the world,</i>
<i>we still haven't had a meeting!</i>

249
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:25,970
- Cheryl?
- Yes?

250
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,103
What did you do? You canceled AAA?

251
00:15:31,244 --> 00:15:32,370
What happened to you?

252
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,845
Why didn't you tell me
you were canceling AAA?

253
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:38,247
After that article, how could I not?

254
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:41,439
- I was reading it to you.
- You didn't say you were canceling it.

255
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:43,600
I was going to tell you when you got home.

256
00:15:43,656 --> 00:15:48,389
That's great, I had to change a tire.
And then, look at this.

257
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:50,258
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

258
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:51,660
I got to go change my clothes.

259
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:54,461
I got to go to Jeff's house
and get his clothes.

260
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:57,468
Why did you tell Wanda she has a big ass?

261
00:15:57,536 --> 00:16:01,495
- I didn't tell Wanda she had a big ass.
- She just called me and told me.

262
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:04,768
I didn't say she had a big ass, okay.

263
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:08,473
I yelled out the window and I said,<i>
"I'd know that tush anywhere."</i>

264
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:09,673
Why would you do that?

265
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,274
Why would you even
comment about her ass?

266
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:13,511
What's the big deal?

267
00:16:13,586 --> 00:16:15,213
You might as well call out and say:

268
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:17,222
"You got a really big ass," it's the same.

269
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,192
- It was just a friendly remark, that's all.
- That's a friendly remark?

270
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,229
Yeah, I was just being nice.
I was being nice and chummy.

271
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:27,323
You don't yell a comment
about a woman's ass.

272
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,767
- There's only one way to take it.
- No, if she had a small ass...

273
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:33,031
I could have said,<i>
"I'd know that tush anywhere."</i>

274
00:16:33,105 --> 00:16:34,834
You shouldn't say anything at all.

275
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:37,705
<i>- You just shouldn't talk about...</i>
- What's the big deal?

276
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:40,371
What if I did say she has a big ass?
That's not terrible.

277
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:44,314
What's the matter with a big ass?
I like big asses, there's no problem.

278
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:46,784
You like big asses?

279
00:16:47,153 --> 00:16:49,883
I don't mind a big ass.
No, not necessarily big.

280
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:54,495
- No, this is interesting, you love big asses?
- No, I don't love big asses.

281
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,893
How big do you like them?

282
00:16:55,961 --> 00:16:59,488
<i>I like them just the regular...</i>
I like them just like yours, okay?

283
00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:03,024
Because mine is really big,<i>
and "I like them big."</i>

284
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:05,366
It's not really big, it's a good size.

285
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:08,339
<i>You said, "I love big asses and I like yours."</i>

286
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,205
<i>No, I said, I don't mind them. I like your...</i>

287
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,808
There are a lot of things
about you I don't know.

288
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:17,427
- There's nothing about me.
- Yeah, I didn't know you had this ass fetish.

289
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,381
- I don't have an ass fetish.
- This is very kinky.

290
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:23,752
- It's, like, all this stuff is unfolding now.
- Nothing's unfolding!

291
00:17:23,823 --> 00:17:27,020
This is interesting. After years together,
<i>I'm just finding out...</i>

292
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:28,583
What are you, crazy, no!

293
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:31,960
That's so untrue, no, I'm not a deviant.

294
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:38,233
<i>I didn't say "deviant."</i>

295
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:41,273
Don't say I have an ass fetish,
you got nothing on me.

296
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,001
- Are you expecting somebody?
- Wanda.

297
00:17:43,075 --> 00:17:44,164
What?

298
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,109
Come on in.

299
00:17:53,252 --> 00:17:54,617
You know who I am? Okay.

300
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
I thought I had to turn around,
and show you my big ass.

301
00:17:57,323 --> 00:18:00,224
You completely,
completely misinterpreted that.

302
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:04,251
- I didn't say you had a big ass.<i>
- You yelled out, "Hey, big ass Wanda."</i>

303
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,060
No, I didn't say "big ass,"
I was just saying hello.

304
00:18:07,133 --> 00:18:09,397
Is that how you say hello?

305
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,934
<i>Is that it? "Hey, big ass."</i>

306
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:14,097
<i>Or "Hey, Assy," or "Hey, I know your ass."</i>

307
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,767
What is that,
that's not how you say hello, is it?

308
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:17,934
Perhaps not.

309
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:20,535
Something about my ass
has made you download it...

310
00:18:20,613 --> 00:18:22,706
and you stored it in your memory.

311
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:25,016
That's not so.

312
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:27,745
- What is wrong with him?
- We were having a discussion.

313
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,584
Did you tell him how wrong it is
to say something like that?

314
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:33,989
- I told him.
- You know, a woman's ass is very personal.

315
00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:36,755
I didn't know he was so obsessed
with asses until today.

316
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:38,729
- You have an ass man.
- What are you saying?

317
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:40,231
- You are an ass man.
- I am not.

318
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,823
You are an ass man.

319
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:45,894
- It's this ass fetish I didn't know about.
- I don't have any ass fetish, okay.

320
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,774
Obsessed with asses?
I am not obsessed with asses.

321
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:52,174
Okay, Assy.
And why is that shit all over you?

322
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:54,474
What you been doing, looking for asses?

323
00:18:54,547 --> 00:18:57,277
All in the bleachers and stuff,
"Where's the ass?"

324
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:05,652
If it isn't Jeffrey's messenger boy.

325
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:11,386
He is such a slimy, spineless creature
that he sends you to do his dirty work.

326
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:13,622
Don't you resent it?

327
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,223
No, I'm fine.

328
00:19:16,202 --> 00:19:18,898
All right, let's get this over with, come on.

329
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:24,199
He can't even face me, that fat fuck.

330
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:26,836
You know what I mean,
he sends you, his friend...

331
00:19:26,912 --> 00:19:30,973
he puts you in this awkward position,
like all the times he used to keep secrets.

332
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,712
It's not awkward, there's no secrets.

333
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:35,845
Honest, it's not awkward,
I'm very comfortable.

334
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:37,013
You think I don't know...

335
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:39,421
about all the little bimbos, these actresses.

336
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,618
What are you talking about?

337
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,526
He tells them he's going
to give them parts...

338
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,029
so he can get a nice blowjob.

339
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:46,462
- I know him.
- Blowjob?

340
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:50,298
He thinks I don't know this shit.
What did he tell you, what did he say?

341
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:53,896
Did he tell you I kicked him out?
<i>Yeah, his male ego, his stupid male...</i>

342
00:19:53,973 --> 00:19:56,339
He thinks I don't know
about that porn stash.

343
00:19:56,408 --> 00:19:58,638
Take all this.
He's gonna need this in the hotel.

344
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:00,702
He told me that he doesn't want any of this.

345
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:03,873
<i>Yeah, Freak That Booty, Big Ass Momma,</i>
all his favorites.

346
00:20:03,949 --> 00:20:06,076
Think I don't know about this crap?

347
00:20:07,353 --> 00:20:10,720
You're into this shit, too?
<i>You're into the kinky Big Ass Momma crap?</i>

348
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:13,053
- Are you crazy?
- I thought you were a family man.

349
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,491
I thought I recognized
that woman from the back.

350
00:20:15,561 --> 00:20:16,653
Let me tell you something.

351
00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:19,664
Your perverse, fat fuck manager,
you know, what he makes me do?

352
00:20:19,732 --> 00:20:23,793
- He violates me, Larry. He defiles me.
- I don't want to know.

353
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,798
<i>At night, he makes me...</i>

354
00:20:26,405 --> 00:20:27,531
Who's that?

355
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,973
Susie, what's going on?

356
00:20:33,045 --> 00:20:34,979
Where's Jeff?

357
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:38,107
- You've done something rotten.
- What is this?

358
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:42,312
All right, Jeffrey is at a hotel,
Larry is bringing the clothes.

359
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:44,117
I'm taking the clothes to the hotel.

360
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:47,022
I want to talk, could I go with you,
to the hotel?

361
00:20:47,092 --> 00:20:48,150
I want to go with you.

362
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:50,718
No, you'll get excited,
you're overworked, stop it.

363
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:52,457
I want to see my boy.

364
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:54,499
You know what, take Mom to the hotel.

365
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:58,333
Dad, you stay here with me.
Okay, very good.

366
00:20:58,404 --> 00:21:00,634
We'll take care of everything.

367
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:07,042
I'm sure you had something to do with this,
you rotten bastard!

368
00:21:10,516 --> 00:21:13,747
Why did you have to put
those clothes of Jeff's...

369
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:14,945
just throw them off.

370
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,582
Why did you just throw them in the trunk
on top of a dirty old tire?

371
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,550
- There's something wrong with me.
- That's the question.

372
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,391
"What's wrong with me?" is the question.

373
00:21:24,463 --> 00:21:25,794
Why would anybody do that?

374
00:21:25,864 --> 00:21:28,958
I don't have a closet in my house.
I'm used to throwing things.

375
00:21:29,034 --> 00:21:30,194
Throwing them on the floor.

376
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:33,397
I throw them on the floor,
that's how all my clothes are at home...

377
00:21:33,472 --> 00:21:35,201
I don't even have a bed.

378
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:38,835
- I sleep on a big pile of clothes.
- It's just disgusting.

379
00:21:38,911 --> 00:21:42,642
- I'm a disgusting man.
<i>- I can see that, I'm just, I'm so...</i>

380
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:44,478
You're disappointed in me.

381
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,882
I'm disappointed. Now what's this?

382
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:49,580
<i>"Loose fat, as fast as you can."</i>

383
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:51,145
Yeah, really.

384
00:21:51,757 --> 00:21:54,726
That sounds good,
I'd like to get that number.

385
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:58,752
- Have you got a pen, let me put that down.
- There's one in the back seat.

386
00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:19,450
In my day, nobody got divorced.

387
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:24,887
You know, one little problem,
and nowadays it's goodbye...

388
00:22:24,957 --> 00:22:26,822
grab your clothes, and you're gone.

389
00:22:26,892 --> 00:22:29,622
People live together for years and years...

390
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:32,289
hating each other desperately,
<i>but still they...</i>

391
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:33,888
What are you doing?

392
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:37,793
You like that old car.
You know the back seat faces out.

393
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,168
So that you can see where you've been.

394
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:44,298
Yeah, makes you nauseous,
the fumes, you know...

395
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,708
<i>that come out from...</i>
Can I help you with that?

396
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:47,939
That's okay.

397
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:51,677
- This is a beautiful hotel. Isn't it a beauty?
- Yeah, it's lovely.

398
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,378
I want to retire here some day.
Absolutely gorgeous.

399
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:58,219
- Did Jeff say he's gonna meet us here?
- He's gonna meet us in the lobby.

400
00:22:58,290 --> 00:22:59,951
- I don't see him.
- There, what's that?

401
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:02,493
Jeff, darling.

402
00:23:02,795 --> 00:23:04,057
What's the trouble here?

403
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,689
<i>- Could I please...</i>
- Yeah, hold on, come here.

404
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:09,393
One second, Mom. Drop them down there.

405
00:23:09,468 --> 00:23:11,993
Your father is just all broken up about this.

406
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:13,129
We'll talk about it.

407
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:16,072
Go up to Room 818.

408
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,199
Here you go, Room 818.

409
00:23:18,377 --> 00:23:21,312
I'll be up there in a second,
and we'll talk about everything.

410
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,404
I've come all this way.

411
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:24,472
Go with him and I'll be up.

412
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,780
Take something from the minibar.
I'll be up there.

413
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:29,047
- You promise me now.
- I promise you.

414
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:32,181
- All right, sweetheart.
- I'm sorry about this whole thing.

415
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:34,487
Thanks for the ride.

416
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,357
What happened with Susie?

417
00:23:36,428 --> 00:23:38,328
Guys, dad's gonna run up to the bathroom.

418
00:23:38,397 --> 00:23:40,627
This isn't funny,
so wipe the smile off your face.

419
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:41,757
Nothing, she's a lunatic.

420
00:23:41,834 --> 00:23:44,268
- She's fucking nuts.
- Yeah, she's crazy.

421
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:45,803
Now you know why I'm here.

422
00:23:45,871 --> 00:23:49,705
Remember earlier today
you said that you owed me one?

423
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:54,041
- Yeah, I owe you big.
- I need to take you up on it.

424
00:23:54,113 --> 00:23:57,378
- Okay, what?
- Like, now, quickly.

425
00:23:57,449 --> 00:23:58,814
- Right now.
- Yeah.

426
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:03,848
I actually have a rather bizarre request.

427
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:09,051
I want you to go outside,
there's a station wagon out there.

428
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:10,356
What?

429
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:14,461
I want you to let the air
out of somebody's tires.

430
00:24:14,533 --> 00:24:18,094
It says "14 THOR" on the license plate.

431
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:21,367
It's a red station wagon, it's in front,
you can't miss it.

432
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,204
- "14 THOR," but why?
- You said you owed me one.

433
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:27,575
- All right, yeah, sure.
- But you have to do it now, hurry up.

434
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:29,079
All right, you'll be here, right?

435
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:31,275
I'll be here, yeah. Thank you.

436
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:40,517
Guys.

437
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:42,153
How you doing?

438
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,491
- Good, you?
- Good. Listen.

439
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,724
Your dad's that wrestler, isn't he?

440
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:49,757
- Thor, yeah.
- Big tall guy.

441
00:24:49,835 --> 00:24:52,463
I got a little piece of information for you...

442
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:54,472
that might interest you.

443
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,771
- Wrestling's fixed.
- What do you mean?

444
00:24:57,843 --> 00:25:02,803
All the matches are set up beforehand.
The winners are all pre-determined.

445
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:06,408
- It's completely illegitimate.
- You mean it's fake?

446
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:10,046
Exactly, fake.
That's exactly the word I'm looking for.

447
00:25:10,122 --> 00:25:12,215
Dad's kind of a big fake.
You know what he is?

448
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:16,125
- He's more of an actor than a wrestler.
- Dad's an actor?

449
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:20,495
That's right, the whole thing's
a big phony boloney.

450
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:24,334
Everybody knows that.
Nobody thinks it's real.

451
00:25:25,003 --> 00:25:28,234
You tell him the bald turd said hello, okay?

452
00:25:54,266 --> 00:25:55,528
Hi.

453
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:58,569
What have you been up to today?

454
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:00,468
- Working.
- Really?

455
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,234
You and Jason worked things out?

456
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:05,367
No, we can't seem to agree
on the locus equidistant of points.

457
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:08,208
I suggested a restaurant,
he thought it was too close to me.

458
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,216
Then he suggested one,
and I thought it was too close to him...

459
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,751
and, we just can't get it together.

460
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,154
Of course you can't.
Are you expecting something from the city?

461
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:21,215
- No.
- Can I open it?

462
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:22,885
Sure.

463
00:26:29,534 --> 00:26:32,002
Oh, my God.
