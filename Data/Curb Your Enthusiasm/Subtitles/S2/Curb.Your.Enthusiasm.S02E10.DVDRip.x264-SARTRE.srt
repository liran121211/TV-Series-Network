1
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,493
<i>Okay, here's the thing.</i>

2
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:22,295
<i>I just don't want to do this show.</i>
<i>I just don't want to do it anymore.</i>

3
00:00:23,303 --> 00:00:25,828
<i>I've lost enthusiasm for it.</i>

4
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,897
<i>I just don't feel jazzed about it...</i>

5
00:00:27,974 --> 00:00:31,501
<i>and I've kind of had it.</i>

6
00:00:31,578 --> 00:00:33,842
<i>So let's just walk away from this.</i>

7
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:37,247
<i>It's just too much of a headache</i>
<i>and I'm utterly exhausted, okay?</i>

8
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:39,182
<i>I can't believe you're saying this.</i>

9
00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:42,278
<i>It's such a great idea. It's a great idea.</i>

10
00:00:42,356 --> 00:00:46,258
<i>No, I know, Jeff, I know it's a great idea.</i>
<i>That's not what the issue is.</i>

11
00:00:46,326 --> 00:00:49,762
The problem,
quite honestly, has been you, Larry.

12
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:51,922
Yeah.

13
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:55,331
<i>I mean, it's just been a fiasco</i>
from start to finish.

14
00:00:55,402 --> 00:00:58,235
It just seems
that trouble seems to be following you.

15
00:00:58,305 --> 00:00:59,966
<i>He's a victim of circumstance.</i>

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,339
<i>Okay, it's his not being</i>
a victim of circumstance, guys...

17
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,470
<i>and, you know... Lar, come on.</i>

18
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:09,674
<i>This has been a joke, it's been too much.</i>

19
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,015
<i>I don't know what to say,</i>
<i>I'm sorry that you feel that way.</i>

20
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:16,578
<i>- It's a shame, because everyone loves it.</i>
- Yeah, everyone loves it.

21
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:19,216
<i>It's what's gone on after</i>
<i>that's been the problem, but-</i>

22
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:23,160
If we were to continue,
where would we even go at this point?

23
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,925
Where would we even go?

24
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:27,792
What are our choices here, CBS?

25
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:29,062
- CBS.
- Fox?

26
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:33,004
<i>- No, not Fox, I don't like their politics.</i>
<i>- CBS is where I'd like to go with it.</i>

27
00:01:33,273 --> 00:01:37,801
<i>- What do you say? Come on, we'll do CBS-</i>
<i>- It's just that it's tiring. This has been tiring.</i>

28
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:41,176
<i>He's gonna do it all from now on.</i>
He will do it all.

29
00:01:41,248 --> 00:01:43,808
At the next meeting,
<i>you don't even have to say a word.</i>

30
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:46,079
<i>- I'll pitch the whole show, okay?</i>
- Really?

31
00:01:46,153 --> 00:01:48,144
<i>You don't even have to come and I'll sell it.</i>

32
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:52,521
Just divorce yourself from the whole thing
<i>until there's a script in front of you, okay?</i>

33
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:56,161
- You are gonna do all of it?
- I will do the whole thing.

34
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,527
- The whole pitch.
- Yeah, the whole pitch.

35
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,691
Come on, one more shot.

36
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:04,464
Oh, my God, all right, CBS.

37
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:06,031
CBS.

38
00:02:07,808 --> 00:02:11,107
- That was a little dicey.
- Yeah, you know, I knew we had them.

39
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:12,543
- Did you?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:14,714
They needed reassurance, I think, right?

41
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,909
They needed reassurance,
<i>that's completely what it was.</i>

42
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:22,788
<i>- Don't stare, come on.</i>
- Oh, my God, look at that.

43
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:26,519
I just read about that in the paper.<i>
It's called "scarlet-letter punishment."</i>

44
00:02:26,593 --> 00:02:28,424
<i>"Scarlet-letter punishment"?</i>

45
00:02:28,495 --> 00:02:30,292
- Poor guy.
- Yeah.

46
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:33,092
- Larry!
- Rick, how you doing?

47
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:34,463
- Good!
- Good.

48
00:02:34,534 --> 00:02:36,058
You know that guy?

49
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:42,308
He works at the restaurant, Moho,
in your hotel.

50
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:43,774
The W Hotel.

51
00:02:43,844 --> 00:02:46,039
<i>Why didn't you say</i>
hello to him? You know him.

52
00:02:46,112 --> 00:02:49,548
He wanted to do a stop-and-chat.
<i>I didn't want to do a stop-and-chat.</i>

53
00:02:49,616 --> 00:02:52,244
<i>"Stop-and-chat?"</i>
Where do you come up with these things?

54
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,720
He wanted to stop and chat with me
<i>and I don't know him that well.</i>

55
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:58,087
<i>"Hi, how are you?</i>
<i>Nice to see you. Take care, bye."</i>

56
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,218
<i>No, it's more than that.</i>
For him, all I need to do is say hello-

57
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:02,659
That was kind of rude.

58
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:05,323
That was not rude.
<i>I don't have to do a stop-and-chat.</i>

59
00:03:05,398 --> 00:03:07,866
You always have rules<i>
and phrasings, "stop-and-chat."</i>

60
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,771
Larry, would you
like to help us stuff some envelopes?

61
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:15,972
- No.
- Really?

62
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:18,740
- Surprise, surprise.
- That shocks me.

63
00:03:19,279 --> 00:03:21,076
<i>Guess who I'm going to see.</i>

64
00:03:21,147 --> 00:03:23,081
- Who?
- Kim.

65
00:03:23,316 --> 00:03:24,749
Kim nails or Kim psychic?

66
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,877
- Kim psychic.
- What?

67
00:03:26,953 --> 00:03:29,945
<i>- Yes, I'm so excited.</i>
<i>- You're going back to that psychic?</i>

68
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:32,082
Yeah, to Kim. I kept calling...

69
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,321
and finally she said that
somebody cancelled their appointment.

70
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,863
Last time, she was dead on.

71
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:39,922
<i>She's great. Yeah.</i>

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,867
She told Cheryl
that I was gonna get a hole in one in golf...

73
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:44,301
and I got a hole in one.

74
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:46,635
<i>That's amazing, she's almost magical.</i>

75
00:03:46,706 --> 00:03:49,573
She also told Cheryl
I was gonna have a bad time in Hawaii...

76
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,840
<i>- which I did, but, you know...</i>
<i>- But that wasn't so...</i>

77
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,074
Only you could have a bad time in Hawaii.

78
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,139
<i>Yeah, anybody could've predicted that.</i>

79
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:01,119
And she said that one of my friends
was gonna get pregnant, Carrie...

80
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:03,951
and she even said the name
<i>and she's pregnant...</i>

81
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,254
<i>and she's gonna have a baby,</i>
<i>and they're so happy.</i>

82
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:10,490
<i>- It's unbelievable. How weird is that?</i>
<i>- She's amazing. She's spooky.</i>

83
00:04:10,564 --> 00:04:11,963
You know what I like about her?

84
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:15,968
<i>Stuff that's bad, she doesn't hold back.</i>
<i>She'll tell you. Yeah.</i>

85
00:04:16,036 --> 00:04:19,403
<i>'Cause a lot of psychics,</i>
they hold back on the bad stuff.

86
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:21,440
<i>Who's gonna pay to hear</i>
a bunch of bad shit?

87
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:22,975
Nobody want to hear that.

88
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:33,414
Do you believe this?
What the hell are they doing?

89
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,544
Putt it.

90
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,690
Every hole...

91
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,919
they line up putts,
from the front, from the back.

92
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:41,085
They walk around.

93
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:43,493
Are they playing for thousands of dollars?
Come on.

94
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:45,724
- I know.
<i>- I've got a five-hour round here.</i>

95
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,426
<i>- We're fine.</i>
<i>- We're fine?</i>

96
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,593
- Enjoy yourself.
<i>- I can't enjoy myself.</i>

97
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:52,160
<i>They can't feel your tension, okay?</i>

98
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,607
<i>You're just all wired up.</i>

99
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:56,772
You know what? I got a masseuse.

100
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,539
<i>This weekend you're gonna see her,</i>
my treat.

101
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:01,478
<i>You're just all tense.</i>

102
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,846
You need to relax,
<i>'cause golf doesn't relax you.</i>

103
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:06,385
How can you relax
if these guys take a year like this?

104
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,387
<i>You're right.</i>

105
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:10,545
So, my treat.

106
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:13,691
Sorry about this,
<i>they're taking a year up there.</i>

107
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,625
<i>No problem, don't worry about it.</i>

108
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:18,220
<i>- I'm telling you-</i>
<i>- All right, fine, I'll get it.</i>

109
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:19,856
<i>Finally, they're done.</i>

110
00:05:28,308 --> 00:05:31,800
<i>I can't hit in front of an audience.</i>
<i>You know, I just can't.</i>

111
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:38,114
<i>- Right there, what's that?</i>
<i>- Yeah, that's a bad spot.</i>

112
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:41,080
<i>Yeah, let's try to breathe through it,</i>
okay, together?

113
00:05:49,496 --> 00:05:52,090
- Is that better?
- No, not really.

114
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:56,335
You know, sometimes,
the body has a memory...

115
00:05:56,403 --> 00:06:00,430
and it holds on to traumatic events
from our childhood.

116
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:04,967
And do you think this might relate
to anything that may have happened to you?

117
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:07,810
My mother did throw me
against a brick wall...

118
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,145
when I was an infant. Maybe that had-

119
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:11,911
- Really?
- Yeah.

120
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:14,776
<i>I didn't get hurt at all.</i>

121
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:18,412
Yeah.

122
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:21,821
And have you ever talked
to her about this, maybe?

123
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:24,862
<i>Yeah, I've mentioned it to her</i>
a couple of times.

124
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:29,425
<i>- She's okay with that?</i>
- Yeah, she said I was a little prick.

125
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:34,729
<i>- How's your chi?</i>
<i>- It's good, it's delicious chi.</i>

126
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,377
The whole body does better
<i>when there's no blockages anywhere.</i>

127
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,012
How are you feeling?

128
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:45,181
- All right.
- Yeah?

129
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,145
Would you like me to finish you off?

130
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:50,889
Okay.

131
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:10,069
Hot.

132
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,312
Stop.

133
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,385
- Stop.
- Stop?

134
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:20,812
Stop.

135
00:07:23,757 --> 00:07:25,156
Are you okay?

136
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:36,031
<i>I'm just saying</i>
if he gets Sarah Jessica Parker...

137
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:38,297
to do a guest shot on our show,
it would be great.

138
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:41,238
- Mike.
- How are you, man?

139
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:42,399
Good to see you.

140
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:43,942
- Good to see you.
- Absolutely.

141
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,501
<i>- Absolutely. What's going on?</i>
- Is this-

142
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:48,103
<i>- What's going on?</i>
<i>- What's going on?</i>

143
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:51,582
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>What in the God's name is wrong with you?</i>

144
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:55,087
<i>- You're nuts.</i>
- You want me to wait outside?

145
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:58,921
<i>No, I don't want you to wait outside.</i>
I want you to hear this, okay?

146
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,620
- Okay.
- He sends me to a masseuse...

147
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:06,028
and, you know, after 45 minutes,
<i>I'm on my back...</i>

148
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,624
she says,
<i>"Do you want me to finish you off?"</i>

149
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:10,566
<i>And I go, "Okay."</i>

150
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,764
<i>I don't know what the hell</i>
<i>she's talking about!</i>

151
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:15,330
<i>I think she'll work more on my neck</i>
<i>and that'll be it!</i>

152
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:19,310
Then she puts her hand under the sheets
and starts pumping away.

153
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,347
Wait a minute,
are you messing around with me?

154
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:23,382
<i>No, I didn't know</i>
what she was talking about.

155
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:26,213
Is this a gag?
<i>'Cause my character goes to a masseuse...</i>

156
00:08:26,286 --> 00:08:28,151
who wants to give him a happy ending.

157
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:31,122
- That happened on your show?
<i>- You don't watch my show?</i>

158
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:33,659
<i>- You don't?</i>
- No.

159
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:37,986
- I put my foot in my mouth, all right?
<i>- I'm sorry, how's the show going?</i>

160
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:41,727
<i>- You don't watch it, why do you care?</i>
<i>- I'm just making conversation.</i>

161
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:44,201
<i>That's why I'm not</i>
throwing it back your way.

162
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,034
- Did you enjoy it?
- I stopped it.

163
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,336
What do you mean? Who stops a whack-off?

164
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:52,606
- I stopped it after 12 pumps.
<i>- No wonder you're still uptight.</i>

165
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:55,876
You either do zero pumps
or a thousand pumps.

166
00:08:56,549 --> 00:08:57,982
<i>I don't know how I did it.</i>

167
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:00,212
How did you do that?
What did you summon?

168
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:02,447
<i>I don't know how I did it.</i>

169
00:09:02,522 --> 00:09:05,252
If I stopped at 12 pumps,
I would tell my wife.

170
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:08,226
<i>I'd go home and say,</i>
<i>"Honey, I was getting a massage...</i>

171
00:09:08,294 --> 00:09:10,762
<i>"and I took 12 pumps</i>
<i>and I stopped 'cause I love you."</i>

172
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,764
- I will never ever tell her.
- I would.

173
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:16,529
And if your wife ever finds out,
<i>you're a noble man, you made it stop.</i>

174
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:18,662
<i>She's not gonna find out,</i>
<i>don't worry about it.</i>

175
00:09:18,738 --> 00:09:20,000
All right.

176
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,407
Oh, my God.

177
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:25,606
<i>She's got an appointment with...</i>

178
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,813
that psychic today.

179
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:31,908
- The hole-in-one psychic?
- I told you about that?

180
00:09:31,985 --> 00:09:33,009
Yeah.

181
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:36,180
The psychic told his wife
he would hit a hole in one, and he did.

182
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:39,519
- Could a psychic know something like that?
- She knew hole in one.

183
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:41,150
You better stop her from going.

184
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,627
- Larry, good seeing you.
- Good to see you, Mike.

185
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,027
<i>Don't forget the CBS meeting.</i>

186
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:47,658
<i>CBS today, yeah, I'll see you there.</i>
<i>Don't be late.</i>

187
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:49,531
<i>She's great, do you want her number?</i>

188
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:51,695
- Absolutely.
- Good.

189
00:09:54,307 --> 00:09:56,741
- Cheryl?
<i>- Yes, I'm up here!</i>

190
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:00,403
- Hi.
- Hi.

191
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,778
- How was your massage?
- Good.

192
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,777
Good. Guess what?
I have made plans for us tonight.

193
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,878
<i>- We're gonna celebrate your CBS deal.</i>
<i>- It's not even-</i>

194
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,423
Listen, I have a limo
<i>that's gonna pick us up.</i>

195
00:10:11,557 --> 00:10:15,687
<i>It's gonna take us to Moho</i>
for dinner at the W Hotel.

196
00:10:15,862 --> 00:10:17,796
<i>And then if we're feeling frisky...</i>

197
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:20,162
then we can stay all night,
do whatever we want.

198
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:23,134
I saw that guy
who manages the place, Rick Crane.

199
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:27,366
I ran into him on the street the other day
<i>and I didn't do a stop-and-chat.</i>

200
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,068
He wanted to stop and talk,
and I just kept walking...

201
00:10:30,143 --> 00:10:32,611
but I said hello,
but it could be a little touchy.

202
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,203
<i>Why didn't you stop?</i>

203
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:37,645
<i>It's too awkward and horrible</i>
to do those stop-and-chats.

204
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:40,242
<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>I wouldn't worry about it.</i>

205
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,313
<i>- We probably won't even run into him.</i>
- We have the meeting with CBS today.

206
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,881
<i>It's not a done deal or anything.</i>
<i>I don't even know-</i>

207
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,292
<i>Come on, it's as good as done, right?</i>

208
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:52,631
Have you seen my keys?
I have an appointment with the psychic.

209
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:56,533
<i>I'm actually running late. I got them.</i>

210
00:10:57,337 --> 00:11:01,433
- All right, I will see you later.
- Honey, I got a better idea.

211
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,304
- What?
<i>- Let's fool around.</i>

212
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:05,970
Right now? Listen, I have an appointment.

213
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:08,070
<i>Forget the psychic. Let's fool around.</i>

214
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:12,607
It took me a long time to get this.
No, not right now!

215
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,613
No means no!

216
00:11:16,322 --> 00:11:20,281
God, no, save it for tonight!

217
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:24,357
Larry, no. Listen, I have got to get going.

218
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:26,489
<i>- You're gonna make me late.</i>
<i>- I've got a lump.</i>

219
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,534
<i>I'm afraid she's gonna tell you about it!</i>

220
00:11:28,601 --> 00:11:31,695
<i>Do you hear what I'm saying? I'm dying!</i>

221
00:11:32,972 --> 00:11:35,873
<i>And that's the name of the show:</i>
<i>Aren't you Evelyn?</i>

222
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:40,569
<i>I like the edge of it because it's funny,</i>
<i>but it's a little quirky, too.</i>

223
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:43,740
<i>This is all Larry's idea.</i>
He came to my office and pitched it...

224
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:46,046
and I immediately
just thought it was superb.

225
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:49,418
And, Lar, hello?

226
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,849
<i>Hello? We're pitching.</i>

227
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,793
Did she offer you coffee or water
or something?

228
00:11:55,862 --> 00:11:59,389
<i>She did. I don't want any,</i>
<i>but perhaps you'd like an espresso?</i>

229
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:02,457
- We can make you a latte here.
<i>- I'm okay, thank you.</i>

230
00:12:02,535 --> 00:12:05,629
- All right.
<i>- You know, the thing that's hard...</i>

231
00:12:06,873 --> 00:12:10,832
about having been on a successful show...

232
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,951
<i>is that it's great...</i>

233
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:21,145
but everybody identifies me with Elaine.

234
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,017
Okay, so for instance...

235
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:25,751
recently, I was skiing
with my family in Jackson Hole.

236
00:12:25,825 --> 00:12:29,818
And I was wearing the helmet, the goggles...

237
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,387
the big, baggy clothes,
<i>covered in snow, blah, blah, blah...</i>

238
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,097
I see your husband Larry.

239
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:41,807
- Yeah, he getting a massage.
- Right.

240
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:45,339
He getting more than just a massage.

241
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,740
<i>He's very happy.</i>

242
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:53,541
Yeah, he having sex with her hand!

243
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:58,615
<i>She pump 32 times, then...</i>

244
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:03,419
<i>So, that is an example, don't you think?</i>

245
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:05,987
<i>Larry, isn't that a good example...</i>

246
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:10,001
<i>- of trying to...</i>
- Like the skiing thing.

247
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:14,096
- Like, when she was skiing.
<i>- No, that's just what I said.</i>

248
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,472
I know. She was skiing
and then she had the problem.

249
00:13:17,543 --> 00:13:19,238
No, I said that, so-

250
00:13:19,312 --> 00:13:21,780
Situations like that
are gonna come up on the show.

251
00:13:21,848 --> 00:13:24,783
- Just like that.
<i>- So, I'm thrilled that you're here.</i>

252
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:28,685
<i>- I'm a huge fan of both of you, obviously.</i>
- Thank you.

253
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,915
And I love your idea...

254
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,117
and we would love
to be in business with you.

255
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,854
Great, terrific, fantastic!

256
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:39,659
Talk further about casting
and further, you know.

257
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:42,633
<i>I've kind of gotta take off, I'll see you soon.</i>

258
00:13:42,702 --> 00:13:45,227
- Thank you.
- Nice to see you.

259
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:47,204
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

260
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,305
How did it go?

261
00:14:04,056 --> 00:14:06,183
It went well, I think...

262
00:14:07,293 --> 00:14:10,353
I think they really liked the show. I think...

263
00:14:10,496 --> 00:14:12,589
I think they want to do it.

264
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,790
<i>Aren't you gonna ask me</i>
how my appointment went?

265
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,462
Right, the psychic. How did it go?

266
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,866
I know everything, Larry.

267
00:14:25,378 --> 00:14:27,175
I know what happened.

268
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:29,777
What happened?
<i>What do you mean, "What happened"?</i>

269
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:31,111
What happened, what happened?

270
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,345
What are you talking about,
did something happen?

271
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:34,818
- Yeah.
- What happened?

272
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:37,014
<i>That you're having an affair.</i>

273
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,281
<i>I'm not having an affair!</i>

274
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:43,092
I know about it, she told me about it.

275
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:45,722
She told you what? What did she tell you?
<i>That's insane!</i>

276
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:49,894
<i>She said that you're having an affair</i>
with a woman with long, red hair...

277
00:14:49,969 --> 00:14:51,231
and a tattoo of a star.

278
00:14:51,304 --> 00:14:54,034
I have not touched another woman,
<i>that's ridiculous.</i>

279
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,973
<i>- I'm not having any affair!</i>
<i>- You're not having an affair.</i>

280
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:59,739
- No.
- Why would she make up a story like that?

281
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:02,975
<i>I don't know why she would.</i>
<i>Maybe she's an anti-Semite.</i>

282
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:04,479
<i>I don't think so.</i>

283
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,744
<i>- You don't think so?</i>
- No.

284
00:15:05,818 --> 00:15:08,616
<i>I'm sure there's some Korean anti-Semites.</i>

285
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,583
<i>She's not Korean.</i>

286
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:14,557
<i>She's American.</i>

287
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,561
<i>She's American?</i>
I thought you said her name was Kim.

288
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:18,256
Her name is Kim.

289
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,426
This is not the point.

290
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,095
The point is that she told me
this whole thing about you having an affair.

291
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:29,198
<i>- She's wrong.</i>
- She seemed very sure of it.

292
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:35,377
<i>No, it's not true. I'm not having an affair.</i>
I have never touched another woman.

293
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,109
Never ever...

294
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,151
ever, ever.

295
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:45,283
If you were having an affair,
<i>you'd probably lie about it, wouldn't you?</i>

296
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,422
I would imagine I would.

297
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,825
<i>Then how do I know that this just isn't a lie?</i>

298
00:15:49,895 --> 00:15:52,420
Because if I just told you
the truth about that...

299
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:56,935
<i>it means that I'm just a truthful person</i>
who would tell you the truth about anything.

300
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:01,869
No affair, sorry.

301
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:04,507
- Promise.
<i>- Who's gonna have an affair with me?</i>

302
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:06,772
<i>I'm not a cool guy.</i>
You gotta be cool to do that.

303
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:08,279
<i>- That's true.</i>
<i>- I couldn't do that.</i>

304
00:16:08,347 --> 00:16:11,942
<i>- I won't know how, what would I do?</i>
<i>- I don't know, you won't be good at it.</i>

305
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:14,646
It took me six months
to even put a move on you.

306
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:15,913
I know.

307
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:19,784
<i>She didn't say anything</i>
about my health, right?

308
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,054
- No.
- Come on.

309
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:25,762
Seriously.

310
00:16:26,065 --> 00:16:28,727
I know, because I had this whole night
planned for us-

311
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:32,328
<i>We'll still have a great night.</i>
<i>Come on, I want to, we're gonna celebrate.</i>

312
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,965
- I got the thing, CBS, come on!
- I know.

313
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:37,271
<i>Come on, don't listen to this nonsense.</i>

314
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:52,081
- Thank you.
<i>- You're very welcome.</i>

315
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:56,822
<i>- You don't have to do that, I got it.</i>
<i>- I got it, it's my job.</i>

316
00:16:56,896 --> 00:16:59,160
So what are you gonna do now?

317
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:01,631
<i>- I'll be in the car.</i>
<i>- You're waiting in the car?</i>

318
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,828
<i>I'll be waiting in the car. I'll wait for you.</i>

319
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:06,497
<i>- Okay, we'll be a couple of hours, I guess.</i>
<i>- That's great.</i>

320
00:17:06,572 --> 00:17:08,699
- All right?
<i>- That's fine, that's how it works.</i>

321
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:12,232
- Thank you. You guys enjoy your meal.
<i>- Great, we're going to.</i>

322
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,040
<i>- You'll be all right here?</i>
<i>- I'll be fine.</i>

323
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:15,637
Okay, thank you.

324
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:19,282
<i>Look at the size, why'd you get</i>
<i>a stretch limo? It's gigantic.</i>

325
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:22,446
<i>- 'Cause we're celebrating.</i>
<i>- I know, but we could've got a town car.</i>

326
00:17:22,521 --> 00:17:24,682
<i>But that doesn't say we're celebrating.</i>

327
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:28,987
- What is this?
- A little bit of a line.

328
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,962
<i>- I'm not gonna wait for this.</i>
- Just wait your turn.

329
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:35,728
<i>I'm joking, what's the matter with you?</i>
<i>I'm gonna push them out of the way.</i>

330
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:38,099
<i>- You don't know sometimes.</i>
- Good evening.

331
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,139
- Hi, so nice to see you.
- So glad you could join us.

332
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,505
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.
<i>- How's it going?</i>

333
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:45,032
Good.

334
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,276
<i>- I'll seat you myself.</i>
- Great.

335
00:17:48,347 --> 00:17:50,474
- Right this way.
- Thank you.

336
00:17:52,118 --> 00:17:54,746
<i>- I hope this table's to your liking.</i>
- Sure, thank you.

337
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,220
- Very good, thank you.
- My pleasure.

338
00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:00,417
- A little chilly in here.
<i>- Yeah, isn't it?</i>

339
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:06,329
- This is lovely.
- Did you hear this guy?

340
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:10,731
Have you been catching on
<i>what's going on here?</i>

341
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,897
<i>- What's going on here?</i>
<i>- With this guy, what's going on?</i>

342
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:16,973
<i>He's been completely snubbing me.</i>

343
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:21,204
<i>It's not even subtle, it's ridiculous.</i>
Thank you.

344
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,748
<i>- Hi, I'll be back for your drink order.</i>
- Okay, thanks.

345
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:27,582
You gotta stop and talk to people like
<i>there's so much information to exchange.</i>

346
00:18:27,653 --> 00:18:29,644
<i>"Hello, how you doing?"</i>
<i>"How are you?" "Good."</i>

347
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:31,815
<i>"How's it going with you?" "Good."</i>

348
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:35,485
<i>"Okay, take it easy."</i>

349
00:18:35,561 --> 00:18:39,463
Are you gonna get an appetizer
or are you going straight to the main dish?

350
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:40,692
<i>I don't know.</i>

351
00:18:40,766 --> 00:18:44,896
<i>What'll we do about that driver, let him sit</i>
in the car for the next couple of hours?

352
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,028
<i>That's his night?</i>

353
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:49,370
<i>That's why he gets paid,</i>
<i>he sits there and waits. It's not a bad job.</i>

354
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:53,208
<i>I know. But I'm uncomfortable with him</i>
just sitting out there waiting for us.

355
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,806
- I feel like I have to hurry, you know?
<i>- Didn't you used to drive a limo?</i>

356
00:18:56,882 --> 00:19:00,875
- Did you do waiting? You had to wait.
- Yeah, I know, and I hated it.

357
00:19:04,156 --> 00:19:06,681
<i>I've decided that</i>
this is my favorite restaurant.

358
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,423
<i>- It's really good, isn't it?</i>
<i>- The shrimp is so good, I can't get over it.</i>

359
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,159
Shrimp are great,
but I hate ordering the same thing.

360
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:17,293
- What do you mean?
- We both got the same dish.

361
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:20,532
<i>Why? I wouldn't give you any of mine</i>
if I had something different.

362
00:19:20,606 --> 00:19:24,098
What are we gonna do about dinner for,
<i>what's his name, Greg, the driver?</i>

363
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:29,242
Should we buy him dinner?
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

364
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:31,807
- The limo guy?
- Yeah.

365
00:19:32,017 --> 00:19:34,850
How many times
are we gonna talk about Greg?

366
00:19:36,789 --> 00:19:39,223
<i>He'll be hungry.</i>
Should we order a dinner for him?

367
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,316
<i>No, I think it's too late for that.</i>

368
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:47,655
<i>I got some leftovers here. Maybe I'll just</i>
get him a doggie bag or something.

369
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:50,531
Is that bad?
<i>I don't have to eat these two shrimp.</i>

370
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:52,935
Are you gonna finish that shrimp?
Your last shrimp?

371
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,599
Yes, I am gonna finish that, thank you.

372
00:19:56,842 --> 00:20:00,938
<i>Boy, I'm almost full already.</i>
<i>And you're a shrimp ahead of me.</i>

373
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:08,145
What do you think, are you gonna eat that?

374
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:11,620
<i>No, I'm gonna give it to the limo driver.</i>

375
00:20:13,492 --> 00:20:16,256
<i>You don't have to,</i>
you want to finish it, go ahead.

376
00:20:16,328 --> 00:20:18,728
<i>- No, I don't want it now.</i>
- Go ahead-

377
00:20:18,797 --> 00:20:21,061
<i>No, I'm telling you I'm done.</i>

378
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:33,636
- I got you some food.
<i>- That's great, thanks.</i>

379
00:20:33,712 --> 00:20:35,236
Thank you so much.

380
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:37,839
<i>Yeah, there's some shrimp in there and...</i>

381
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:40,275
Just, like, leftovers?

382
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,452
<i>There's shrimp and...</i>

383
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:47,959
<i>There's some rice in there.</i>
<i>But I didn't touch any of the shrimp.</i>

384
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:51,895
I divided the rice very carefully.
<i>It's all clean, it's all good.</i>

385
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:54,990
How am I supposed to eat?
<i>There's no fork, there's no napkin.</i>

386
00:20:55,434 --> 00:20:59,598
<i>- I can't eat this.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, I forgot the fork.</i>

387
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:01,839
<i>I'll go...</i>

388
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:06,905
<i>- I'll go get you a fork and a napkin.</i>
<i>- All right. That'd be great.</i>

389
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,038
- Sorry.
<i>- That's fine.</i>

390
00:21:09,982 --> 00:21:11,745
<i>We should've got the guy a dinner.</i>

391
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:14,615
Giving him leftovers like that,
that was crazy.

392
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,780
He should be happy
that you got him something.

393
00:21:16,855 --> 00:21:19,847
- Just sit down, honey.
- I gotta get him a fork.

394
00:21:19,925 --> 00:21:21,950
<i>I didn't give him a fork.</i>

395
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:25,458
<i>- You haven't even eaten your pie yet?</i>
<i>- I'm waiting for you.</i>

396
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:28,694
<i>Okay. I'll give him a fork, I'll be right back.</i>

397
00:21:28,767 --> 00:21:32,464
<i>- You're going back out there?</i>
- I gotta give the guy a fork.

398
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:36,297
<i>I'll be right back, okay? I'll be right back.</i>

399
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,771
<i>Larry, how's it going?</i>

400
00:21:45,284 --> 00:21:47,844
- The food was sensational.
- Excellent.

401
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,080
Yeah, really spectacular.

402
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:52,612
Wonderful, do you mind telling me
what you got in your pocket?

403
00:21:54,827 --> 00:21:57,295
- A pen.
- I was thinking of the other pocket.

404
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,893
I got a napkin and a fork.

405
00:22:00,966 --> 00:22:03,958
<i>There's a driver outside.</i>

406
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:08,530
Pardon me for suggesting this, but it seems
<i>like you're walking out with our silverware.</i>

407
00:22:09,441 --> 00:22:11,602
<i>I am, in a way, but I'm not stealing it.</i>

408
00:22:11,677 --> 00:22:16,205
<i>I'm just borrowing it for a minute, and</i>
<i>letting him eat his meal, then I'll get it back.</i>

409
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:19,682
<i>We're having dessert. I'll give him</i>
two minutes, and get back the fork.

410
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:21,549
I call that stealing.

411
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:24,556
Okay, I know what this is about.

412
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:27,717
<i>You're upset, the other day</i>
when I saw you on the street...

413
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,227
<i>and I didn't do a little stop-and-chat.</i>

414
00:22:30,362 --> 00:22:34,355
You know what,
<i>I'm not good at artificial small talk.</i>

415
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:38,733
<i>- "Hello, how are you?" kind of thing.</i>
<i>- I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

416
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:43,241
- Could you wait right there?
- What? What are you doing?

417
00:22:43,308 --> 00:22:44,832
<i>I'm gonna call the police.</i>

418
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,439
<i>You'll be appearing</i>
at the West Los Angeles municipal court.

419
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:56,485
- Judge Katz.
<i>- That's a lovely building.</i>

420
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:59,718
<i>- Yeah, you're gonna like that.</i>
- If you could sign right here, please.

421
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:02,158
All right, I guess in hindsight...

422
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:04,957
<i>I probably should've</i>
let the guy eat with his hands.

423
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,362
<i>That would've been</i>
the better thing to do, right?

424
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,128
Just have him get it all over his face...

425
00:23:09,201 --> 00:23:12,261
and have dogs come up maybe
and lick it off him.

426
00:23:12,337 --> 00:23:14,032
<i>That's really what I should've done.</i>

427
00:23:14,106 --> 00:23:17,837
<i>Sir, you'll have every opportunity</i>
to present your case to Judge Katz.

428
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:20,242
- The court date is on the back.
- Okay.

429
00:23:20,312 --> 00:23:23,577
- And you have a good evening.
- Yes, you, too, thank you very much.

430
00:23:27,786 --> 00:23:32,189
Oh, God, the driver.
Shit, I completely forgot.

431
00:23:32,257 --> 00:23:34,555
I am so sorry.

432
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:41,398
I had the fork, and the guy caught me taking
the fork out of the restaurant...

433
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:42,991
and he called the police.

434
00:23:43,068 --> 00:23:47,198
- I have to go before a judge!
<i>- Don't worry about it, I'm okay, thanks.</i>

435
00:23:47,272 --> 00:23:51,140
- Did you eat the food?
<i>- No, I'll get something on the way home.</i>

436
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:54,737
<i>- Don't worry about it, I'm good.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

437
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:58,783
<i>So I'll maybe call you next week?</i>

438
00:24:12,097 --> 00:24:14,190
- That was great, thank you.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

439
00:24:17,402 --> 00:24:18,767
Excuse me.

440
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:24,375
<i>I'm sorry, I know</i>
<i>this sounds strange. I just...</i>

441
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,904
Do you have a tattoo of a star?

442
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,207
How did you know that?

443
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,116
- Can I just-
<i>- Yeah, on my arm, that's wild.</i>

444
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:37,679
Cheryl, what are you doing?

445
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:39,784
Larry?

446
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:53,403
In the matter of Larry David,
the record reflect the presence of Mr. David.

447
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,565
This case is here for sentencing.

448
00:24:55,674 --> 00:24:59,007
Mr. David, you wish to be heard
before I impose sentence on you?

449
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:03,013
Yes, Judge Katz.<i>
And may I say, "Shabbat shalom."</i>

450
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:07,742
What happened is simply
that I was trying to...

451
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:10,944
bring a fork to a working man...

452
00:25:11,023 --> 00:25:13,753
who was a driver, a limousine driver...

453
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:16,522
and he had dinner,
<i>but he did not have a fork to eat it...</i>

454
00:25:16,595 --> 00:25:19,564
All I was did was attempted
to bring him a fork and a napkin...

455
00:25:19,631 --> 00:25:24,159
<i>so he wouldn't have to eat with his hands</i>
and get it all over his face and his clothing.

456
00:25:24,236 --> 00:25:27,967
And it was only
out of some personal animus...

457
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,942
that the restaurateur had toward me
because I ran into him on the street...

458
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:34,740
<i>and I didn't stop</i>
and have a little chat with him.

459
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:38,749
<i>You know, I don't like to make</i>
little chit-chat on the street.

460
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:41,877
I like to have a real conversation
with people.

461
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,250
<i>It's touching what you tell me.</i>
It seems to me there was an indication...

462
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:49,522
that you were gonna do what you wanted,
when you wanted...

463
00:25:49,595 --> 00:25:51,790
because you feel because of your celebrity...

464
00:25:51,864 --> 00:25:54,424
somehow you can do things
without consequences.

465
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,633
Mr. David, I need your help in this.

466
00:25:57,703 --> 00:26:00,604
<i>Obviously, a fine isn't going to do anything.</i>

467
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:03,505
<i>It just won't mean anything to you,</i>
you have too much money.

468
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:07,170
So, what do you expect this court to do
for the public to understand...

469
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:10,113
<i>I'm not according you</i>
any special treatment?

470
00:26:14,052 --> 00:26:17,852
I could work at the temple
on Saturday mornings...

471
00:26:19,424 --> 00:26:21,483
hand out tallises and yarmulkes.

472
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,189
And you think this is a fitting punishment?
<i>Isn't it a joy?</i>

473
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:28,665
Temple can be quite grueling,
as you well know.

474
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:32,596
You know, Mr. David,
<i>I've been thinking about this.</i>

475
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,002
<i>And you know what I'm gonna do?</i>

476
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:37,940
<i>I'm gonna give you a sentence</i>
that will guarantee...

477
00:26:38,377 --> 00:26:42,177
that you will never, ever do this again.

478
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,021
<i>I swear to God, I'm not lying.</i>

479
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,096
Hi, Larry.

480
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:10,639
<i>I didn't beat my wife.</i>

481
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,403
<i>How's the shrimp, Al?</i>

482
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:16,038
Are you enjoying the shrimp
from the Chinese restaurant?

483
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:18,911
Evening.

484
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:32,019
That was a water bottle in my pants.

485
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:34,222
A water bottle!

486
00:27:34,299 --> 00:27:36,995
<i>Here's a good question</i>
<i>for Who Wants To Be A Millionaire:</i>

487
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:38,934
<i>"What idiot runs ABC?"</i>

488
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:42,231
<i>But I'm not gonna...</i>

489
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,042
<i>It's a long story.</i>

490
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:58,117
I was trying to help a driver,
a working man...

491
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:01,691
<i>so he wouldn't have to eat with his hands...</i>

492
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:05,958
Miss CBS bigwig.
