1
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:18,297
And now this actress is having problems
getting another series...

2
00:00:18,365 --> 00:00:21,493
because everybody sees her as Evelyn.

3
00:00:21,568 --> 00:00:22,660
I see.

4
00:00:22,736 --> 00:00:26,297
They want her to bring Evelyn back.
<i>She can't get away from it.</i>

5
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:30,400
In fact the series could be called
<i>Aren't you Evelyn?</i>

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,171
<i>Or I'm Not Evelyn. Something like that.</i>

7
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:36,209
- I love it.
<i>- It's funny, right?</i>

8
00:00:36,283 --> 00:00:39,810
I am just so excited about this.
This is wonderful, this is great.

9
00:00:39,886 --> 00:00:41,148
<i>I'm glad you like it.</i>

10
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:45,021
<i>I'm not surprised. I knew you would</i>
come here with something brilliant.

11
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:46,957
- You did.
<i>- It's very funny.</i>

12
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:48,790
I am just so excited.

13
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:51,092
<i>What's with you and the water?</i>

14
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,595
<i>Doctor's orders.</i>
<i>I'm dehydrated or something...</i>

15
00:00:54,668 --> 00:00:57,262
<i>and I've got to drink 8 of these a day.</i>

16
00:00:57,337 --> 00:00:59,305
Constantly running to the bathroom.

17
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:02,604
The other thing is that
Jason will be working with us as well.

18
00:01:02,676 --> 00:01:04,268
- Jason?
- Alexander.

19
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:06,073
<i>Alexander, you're kidding me?</i>

20
00:01:06,146 --> 00:01:08,774
<i>- No, isn't that great?</i>
<i>- What's he doing?</i>

21
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:11,409
<i>It's about a motivational speaker.</i>

22
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:14,181
- When did that happen?
- Past few weeks.

23
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:18,122
<i>We've had a few meetings and</i>
<i>we're very close to having it happen.</i>

24
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:20,386
Where did you meet, if I may ask?

25
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:22,757
- Here.
- He came here?

26
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:24,592
Yes, Jason, here.

27
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:27,292
About 4 meetings now.
Such a wonderful actor.

28
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:30,063
Yeah, nothing like him.
<i>He's the greatest guy.</i>

29
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:33,106
<i>They'll both be so different</i>
<i>from how they were on Seinfeld.</i>

30
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:36,734
<i>So, I'm just thrilled about this.</i>
I just think that this is grand.

31
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,438
This is a green light, absolutely.

32
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:41,208
I am so excited about this.

33
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:43,374
<i>- We're delighted.</i>
- Thank you.

34
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,917
<i>I'm so pleased.</i>

35
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:48,111
<i>So now that you're all</i>
part of the ABC family...

36
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:52,124
<i>we're having a screening</i>
<i>of Harriet Beecher Stowe tonight.</i>

37
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:55,218
<i>Oh, my God. My wife's good friend</i>
was the art director on that.

38
00:01:55,295 --> 00:01:57,126
<i>- I heard it's great.</i>
- How is Susie?

39
00:01:57,197 --> 00:02:00,598
<i>We split up. I'm living in a hotel.</i>

40
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:03,864
<i>- I'm sorry to hear that.</i>
<i>- Don't be! It's great.</i>

41
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,996
<i>But it's a wonderful mini-series.</i>

42
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:09,234
Part 1 is tonight, part 2 is tomorrow night.

43
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,867
<i>It's just beautifully shot.</i>

44
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:12,309
Love you to come.

45
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:16,372
The only thing is that
<i>my older kid has a pinkeye, so...</i>

46
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,213
<i>I mean, it's not contagious, but...</i>

47
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:20,310
<i>Sorry. You'll come, Larry?</i>

48
00:02:20,754 --> 00:02:23,552
- Yeah, sure.
<i>- We'll go, sure.</i>

49
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:27,457
<i>Afterwards, we're going to have something</i>
<i>over at the house, Anne's preparing...</i>

50
00:02:27,527 --> 00:02:29,256
and you can come along, all right?

51
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,661
<i>All right, good. We'll see you there.</i>

52
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:34,222
<i>What's the difference between</i>
Harriet Beecher Stowe...

53
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:35,393
and Harriet Tubman?

54
00:02:38,605 --> 00:02:40,698
I think we might be due
for some sex tonight.

55
00:02:40,774 --> 00:02:42,332
- You think?
- I do, yeah.

56
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,900
<i>Did you pencil that in and didn't tell me?</i>

57
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:49,809
<i>I think it's about to start.</i>
You guys going in over here?

58
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,942
- Yeah.
- I saw Susie walk in over there.

59
00:02:52,018 --> 00:02:54,145
<i>So, I'm gonna go in over there. I'm not here.</i>

60
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:55,916
<i>- I haven't seen you.</i>
- Have not seen me.

61
00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:58,287
<i>All right, bye. I'll talk to you later.</i>

62
00:02:58,358 --> 00:02:59,791
<i>Yeah, he's hard to miss.</i>

63
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,090
<i>Larry, I'm so glad you were able to make it.</i>

64
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:05,154
<i>- I'm Lane Michaelson. How do you do?</i>
<i>- He's the ABC guy.</i>

65
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:08,395
We are so happy to have
your husband on board.

66
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:11,198
<i>Listen, we're gonna see you tonight</i>
at the house, right?

67
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:13,739
- Yes, at the house.
- Anne wants to see you, so please.

68
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,469
- Really?
- Yes, okay, take care. Have a great time.

69
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:18,443
- Enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

70
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:20,474
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

71
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:23,175
He must have a lot on his mind tonight.

72
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,185
- A lot of coffee, that man.
- He was in such a hurry.

73
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,654
<i>Excuse me, there's no food</i>
<i>or drink in the theater. I'm sorry.</i>

74
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:34,690
Really? I got a condition.
I really need to have this.

75
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,286
<i>You're gonna have to</i>
<i>finish it out here. I'm sorry.</i>

76
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,196
<i>- Okay, why don't you go in and...</i>
- Get a seat.

77
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:42,258
<i>I'll meet you in there.</i>

78
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:45,668
I mean, what if I have
<i>a really bad kidney thing? I'm not-</i>

79
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,334
- Maybe you should finish it outside.
- Yeah, maybe I should.

80
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:53,109
- Do you like these seats?
- Great seats.

81
00:03:53,179 --> 00:03:56,114
<i>I'm giving you the aisle,</i>
<i>considering all the water you've had.</i>

82
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:58,173
<i>- I'm looking out for you.</i>
- This is great.

83
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:01,152
- What a nice little theater.
<i>- Yeah, it's beautiful.</i>

84
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:09,084
Is that the same woman who just told me
to get rid of the water?

85
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,557
Yeah, I think it is.

86
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:16,869
<i>What's the deal? What is she doing?</i>
Does she work here, or is she a guest?

87
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:20,234
- Yeah, I thought she was working.
- Me, too.

88
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:21,638
Excuse me.

89
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:24,032
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

90
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,169
- Do you work here?
- No.

91
00:04:27,547 --> 00:04:30,277
How come you told me
to get rid of the water then?

92
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,717
I saw you coming in with water.
<i>There's no water, that's the rules.</i>

93
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:37,251
<i>I don't see how it was your concern.</i>
<i>You don't work here.</i>

94
00:04:37,324 --> 00:04:40,657
<i>It's the rules. The sign says,</i>
<i>"No food or drink in the theater."</i>

95
00:04:40,727 --> 00:04:42,627
<i>I'm sure we would all like to have water.</i>

96
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:46,223
<i>We're all dying of thirst.</i>
What are you, the hallway monitor here?

97
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:50,201
<i>- Who are you that the rules don't apply?</i>
<i>- I'm applying the golden rule. Are you?</i>

98
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,670
<i>I don't think the golden rule applies here.</i>

99
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:56,072
If you had water, would you want me
to tell you not to bring it in?

100
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,473
How about common courtesy?

101
00:04:57,544 --> 00:05:00,638
<i>But that doesn't supersede the golden rule.</i>
<i>That's the big one.</i>

102
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:01,772
<i>You're nuts.</i>

103
00:05:01,848 --> 00:05:03,315
<i>- You're nuts.</i>
- All right.

104
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:04,577
Jackass.

105
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:07,484
<i>"Now, don't bring any pens or pencils in."</i>

106
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:09,283
Quiet, loser.

107
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:12,419
<i>"Excuse me, Mrs. Cantor,</i>
<i>we've got homework.</i>

108
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,460
<i>"You forgot to give us homework."</i>

109
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:16,927
Some people are just rude.

110
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,529
<i>...and she's sitting there.</i>

111
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:24,099
Now, is she a guest?

112
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:26,334
Does she work there?

113
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:29,742
<i>She's just some person that</i>
<i>wouldn't let me bring it in.</i>

114
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:31,436
We had this huge fight.

115
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:34,503
There she is, right there, on the right.

116
00:05:35,815 --> 00:05:39,046
<i>She's talking to Anne Michaelson,</i>
<i>Lane Michaelson's wife.</i>

117
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:42,953
<i>- That's who she's talking to.</i>
<i>- That's Lane Michaelson's wife?</i>

118
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:51,130
So tomorrow night, you guys want to go
to dinner before part two?

119
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:54,630
- No.
- I do want to go to part two.

120
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,670
<i>You've gotta go to part two.</i>
<i>You're part of the ABC family.</i>

121
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,364
<i>We're definitely going to part two.</i>

122
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,964
<i>Yeah, we're not going</i>
to dinner with you, though.

123
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,875
- We had already made plans.
<i>- That's all right.</i>

124
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,606
<i>We don't have plans,</i>
<i>we don't wanna go to dinner with you.</i>

125
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,479
- Frozen margaritas?
- Frozen margaritas, thank you.

126
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,042
<i>I actually wanna go 'cause she showed</i>
a lot of cleavage for that time.

127
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,154
Stop it.

128
00:06:15,155 --> 00:06:17,555
<i>They didn't wear it that low,</i>
<i>and she's really...</i>

129
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:21,560
- It was a little much, if you ask me.
<i>- I guess it is... Cleavage.</i>

130
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:27,197
- Cold! Chest freeze!
- Okay, Larry.

131
00:06:27,967 --> 00:06:29,832
<i>Put your tongue to the top of your...</i>

132
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,337
No, your tongue to the roof of your mouth.

133
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:34,100
Are you all right?

134
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:37,706
- Chest freeze.
- I see, yeah.

135
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:40,236
It was too cold, sorry.

136
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,144
Would you like some hot tea or something?

137
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:45,082
<i>- It'll go away.</i>
<i>- So, Anne, you've met Larry?</i>

138
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,881
<i>No, I haven't met Larry,</i>
<i>but I've heard a lot about you.</i>

139
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:54,020
- Hi, nice to meet you.
<i>- And I'm Jeff Greene, we met...</i>

140
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:58,191
- Is there a bathroom I can use?
- Yeah, right down there.

141
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:01,293
Yeah, just to the right.
Just go down to the end.

142
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,631
I have to thank your producer, director...

143
00:07:03,703 --> 00:07:07,002
<i>whoever, because they didn't reveal that</i>
<i>much bosom in that day...</i>

144
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:19,536
- Hello.
- Hi.

145
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:23,340
- Is that a bathroom?
- Yeah, why? Do you have to go potty?

146
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:25,576
Yeah, I do have to go potty.

147
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,745
- You can go in there.
- Okay.

148
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,430
- Thank you.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

149
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:41,163
What are you doing?

150
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:43,395
<i>I'm just brushing my doll's hair.</i>

151
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:45,733
<i>Yeah? What's her name?</i>

152
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:46,870
Judy.

153
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:49,569
<i>"Judy! Judy! Judy!"</i>

154
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:52,468
<i>Boy, she's got pretty long hair.</i>

155
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,805
<i>Do you think maybe it's too long?</i>

156
00:08:57,116 --> 00:08:58,743
<i>It's kind of long.</i>

157
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:02,045
Yeah, do you think
you could give it a haircut?

158
00:09:03,489 --> 00:09:05,889
You want me to give it a haircut?

159
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:08,527
- Can you?
- I guess.

160
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:10,290
- Okay.
- All right.

161
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:12,890
- See this thing?
- Yeah.

162
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,230
<i>It's called a Swiss Army Knife.</i>

163
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,698
You heard of Switzerland?

164
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,432
<i>It's a country in Europe,</i>
<i>and they don't like to fight.</i>

165
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,101
They let everybody
do their fighting for them...

166
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,576
while they ski and eat chocolate.

167
00:09:26,646 --> 00:09:28,910
About right there.

168
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:31,746
You wanna give it
a little, kind of, Dorothy Hamill thing?

169
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:32,910
Yeah.

170
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,884
<i>Boy, she's got really thick hair.</i>

171
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:38,014
<i>At least it'll be shorter.</i>

172
00:09:38,524 --> 00:09:39,855
All right.

173
00:09:40,493 --> 00:09:43,326
- Yeah.
- She looks much prettier.

174
00:09:43,396 --> 00:09:46,832
I think so, too. Look at that.
I really think I did a great job.

175
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,028
- Yeah, you did a great job.
<i>- Yeah, now I'd take her out.</i>

176
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:53,664
Yeah, now this is definitely easier to brush,
and it looks great.

177
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,971
Can I tell you something?
<i>It's a very French look. It's very French.</i>

178
00:09:57,043 --> 00:09:59,773
- She looks prettier.
- Good luck, Judy!

179
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:01,143
Thank you.

180
00:10:14,027 --> 00:10:17,155
<i>- There's no lock on that bathroom door.</i>
- I know.

181
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,824
<i>- That's crazy.</i>
<i>- I know. It's insane.</i>

182
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,764
<i>That's your top priority in a house.</i>

183
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:23,802
- In the bathroom.
- Yeah, of course.

184
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,838
- Will you guard the door while I go?
- Sure.

185
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,304
2 minutes.

186
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:36,540
- Mommy, mommy!
- Tara, what is it, honey?

187
00:10:36,616 --> 00:10:39,346
<i>- Look at my doll's hair.</i>
- Why did you cut her hair?

188
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,319
<i>I didn't cut it! He did!</i>

189
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:43,651
- He cut it.
- Is this true?

190
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:46,521
Yeah, she asked me.
She asked me to give it a haircut.

191
00:10:46,592 --> 00:10:49,459
<i>You walked into my daughter's room</i>
<i>and cut her Judy's hair?</i>

192
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:52,020
<i>- It's not fair.</i>
- She asked me to give it a haircut.

193
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:55,295
And did you happen to tell her
<i>that maybe it wouldn't grow back?</i>

194
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:58,269
<i>- He didn't tell her.</i>
- I thought it was understood.

195
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:00,500
How could you not understand...

196
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:03,872
that a little girl has a vivid imagination?
<i>She's extremely gifted.</i>

197
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:05,103
Sorry.

198
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:09,080
<i>And this little girl doesn't know</i>
<i>that her dolly's hair won't grow back.</i>

199
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:11,639
- Do you know who this is? This is Judy.
- I thought-

200
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:15,279
<i>She is a collector's item.</i>
<i>We can't find another one like this.</i>

201
00:11:15,722 --> 00:11:19,180
- I got this doll before she was born.
<i>- I can replace it, I'm sure I can.</i>

202
00:11:19,258 --> 00:11:22,159
You can replace it?
This is like Liberty, the Beanie Baby.

203
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:25,254
Out Of Production, OOP, okay?
Not coming back.

204
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:28,823
<i>- It's never gonna grow back.</i>
- What is that?

205
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:31,995
I guess I missed a strand there.
I got a Swiss Army-

206
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:33,436
<i>It's ugly, mommy!</i>

207
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:36,475
Let me get it. I got a Swiss Army Knife.
I could get that.

208
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,943
<i>- It's ugly, the haircut's ugly!</i>
<i>- Let's go, Tara.</i>

209
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:43,814
She said it looked good earlier. She liked it.

210
00:11:43,983 --> 00:11:47,783
- Not a surprise.
<i>- I thought it was understood that...</i>

211
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:53,654
Go ahead.

212
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:56,695
Jesus Christ.

213
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:00,730
<i>Who doesn't know</i>
<i>that when you cut a doll's hair...</i>

214
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,030
<i>- it doesn't grow back?</i>
- She should know better.

215
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:05,866
I thought the doll looked better,
to tell you the truth.

216
00:12:05,938 --> 00:12:09,499
<i>- I don't know what it looked like.</i>
- Ugly. It was way down to her waist.

217
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,066
<i>- What's the doll's name? Judy?</i>
- Yeah.

218
00:12:12,145 --> 00:12:14,477
I might be able to help you with this, okay?

219
00:12:14,547 --> 00:12:18,813
My daughter has a huge doll collection.
Her room is filled with dolls.

220
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:21,213
I think she might have that Judy doll.

221
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,654
<i>- You think she's got a Judy doll?</i>
<i>- Sounds familiar. I'm not positive.</i>

222
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:28,490
We can go in tomorrow,
zip in, zip out, boom.

223
00:12:28,561 --> 00:12:31,894
- Would she miss the doll if-
<i>- No, my daughter's not gonna care.</i>

224
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:34,660
<i>She won't notice.</i>
<i>Hasn't played with it in a long time.</i>

225
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:37,134
<i>We'll go by the house tomorrow,</i>
<i>we'll check it out.</i>

226
00:12:37,203 --> 00:12:40,229
Yeah, I mean, otherwise,
you know, this is ugly here.

227
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,831
- I know.
- All of a sudden I got this deal-

228
00:12:42,909 --> 00:12:46,640
The whole ABC deal
could go down the drain. It really could.

229
00:12:56,255 --> 00:13:00,316
Honestly, I have never been
so humiliated in my life, really.

230
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:01,792
I fucked up.

231
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,854
- Are you trying to be funny now?
- No.

232
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:09,129
<i>- Because I'm really not in the mood.</i>
- I fucked up.

233
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:10,994
Yeah.

234
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,801
Michaelson really knows me.
He knows a lot about me.

235
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,143
What did he see exactly?

236
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,273
Everything, exactly.

237
00:13:23,749 --> 00:13:26,843
Like, imagine the worst moment
a person can walk in on somebody.

238
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,943
I got it.

239
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,511
<i>You think you're alone,</i>
<i>and you're in the bathroom.</i>

240
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,854
<i>- That's what it was.</i>
- I got it.

241
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:36,924
I cannot risk running into him
at social functions...

242
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:39,658
at your little ABC parties and screenings.

243
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:42,326
<i>I think you're gonna have to</i>
just go somewhere else.

244
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,335
Are you out of your mind?

245
00:13:44,403 --> 00:13:48,066
- You wanna end the deal because of this?
- Yeah, I do.

246
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,535
<i>We can't go to NBC anymore...</i>

247
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,477
because of your environmental problems
with General Electric.

248
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:56,640
HBO, you know what happened with them.
<i>It's all running out.</i>

249
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:58,411
<i>That's your fault.</i>

250
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:02,283
I got news for you.
You might not have to worry...

251
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,550
because it might all be moot.

252
00:14:04,624 --> 00:14:05,682
Why?

253
00:14:05,758 --> 00:14:08,852
<i>Because if I don't replace the doll, it's over.</i>

254
00:14:16,302 --> 00:14:17,826
Divorce?

255
00:14:18,171 --> 00:14:20,537
- Is it a divorce?
<i>- Yeah, it's a divorce.</i>

256
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:23,734
So start packing up
<i>'cause you're moving out.</i>

257
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:28,236
<i>I wish you wouldn't talk anymore tonight.</i>

258
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,373
<i>I wish you wouldn't say</i>
one more thing to me.

259
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:45,426
- Sure you wanna do this?
<i>- I'm positive, come on.</i>

260
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:48,524
<i>You don't think Sammy's gonna mind?</i>
<i>She's not gonna notice?</i>

261
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,195
<i>She's got a million dolls.</i>
<i>She's won't notice anything.</i>

262
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:54,271
Here we are in Doll World.

263
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:59,107
<i>So, there's dolls here, look at all these.</i>

264
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:02,246
You have no idea
<i>how much money I've spent on dolls.</i>

265
00:15:02,315 --> 00:15:05,682
- Holy cow, look at this.
<i>- This isn't Judy, is it?</i>

266
00:15:06,953 --> 00:15:08,113
This?

267
00:15:09,288 --> 00:15:12,849
<i>- No, I think Judy's hair was lighter.</i>
<i>- Okay, all right, I'll look.</i>

268
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:13,983
She looks Swiss.

269
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,426
She looks like Judy.
She looks Swiss? All right.

270
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:21,194
<i>What's up here? Any stuff up here?</i>
<i>There's dolls up here?</i>

271
00:15:25,338 --> 00:15:26,805
There you go.

272
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,167
- No.
- Yes, it is, of course it is.

273
00:15:30,243 --> 00:15:31,301
<i>No, it's not her.</i>

274
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,038
<i>- That's Judy.</i>
<i>- No, it's not Judy!</i>

275
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:37,048
<i>- I've seen Judy, that's Judy.</i>
- No, Judy has brown eyes.

276
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,710
- She has blue eyes.
<i>- You don't know the eyes.</i>

277
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:42,618
<i>- I do know the eyes 'cause-</i>
- I see my daughter call her Judy.

278
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:44,849
<i>"Suite: Judy Brown Eyes,"</i>
I said it in my head.

279
00:15:44,924 --> 00:15:46,687
<i>You said, "Suite: Judy Brown Eyes"?</i>

280
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:48,852
<i>I know the song is Suite: Judy Blue Eyes...</i>

281
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:51,396
<i>and she has brown eyes. It's brown eyes.</i>

282
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:54,661
<i>- That's not Judy!</i>
- Suite: Judy Brown Eyes.

283
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:56,258
Holy shit.

284
00:15:57,203 --> 00:15:58,602
<i>Where the...</i>

285
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:01,400
Some of these dolls are scary.

286
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,168
A bunch of bald ones up here.

287
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,668
- Judy.
- What?

288
00:16:08,614 --> 00:16:11,583
<i>- Judy! It's her.</i>
- Yeah.

289
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:18,417
<i>- My God! What are you...</i>
- I needed this.

290
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:21,820
<i>- Susie's here.</i>
- Shit. Come on.

291
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:24,328
- Jeffrey?
- What do I do?

292
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,592
- Stick it in your jacket.
- Jeffrey?

293
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:30,193
<i>- It's too big. Where do I put it?</i>
<i>- Do something, she's coming up.</i>

294
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,300
- Give this to me.
- Jeffrey, I saw your car.

295
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:38,434
What the fuck are you doing here?
<i>You're supposed to call first!</i>

296
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:41,541
- Jeffrey?
<i>- So what you wanna be doing is...</i>

297
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:43,582
You need a drill.

298
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,312
What is going on here?
What are you doing here?

299
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,247
<i>- The amount of sleep that I've lost-</i>
- What are you doing here?

300
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:54,760
<i>Listen, and I'll tell you.</i>
<i>Sammy's shelf has been on my mind.</i>

301
00:16:55,294 --> 00:16:57,455
<i>I've always thought this shelf was loose.</i>

302
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,590
And I came here,
and I pushed it and tested it.

303
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,533
- All the dolls fell, right there.
<i>- Why don't I believe you?</i>

304
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:04,680
<i>I don't know.</i>

305
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,434
What are you doing here
<i>in Sammy's room, of all places?</i>

306
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:09,770
And you brought Larry
to help you with the shelf?

307
00:17:09,842 --> 00:17:13,141
I know a lot about shelving.
I put up all the shelves in my house and-

308
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:15,646
<i>You put the shelves up...</i>
I find that hard to believe.

309
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:17,945
- He knows a lot about shelving.
- I put them all up-

310
00:17:18,017 --> 00:17:21,009
Mr. California Closets over here
all of a sudden?

311
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:24,352
<i>Look, get the hell... Leave.</i>
And by the way...

312
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:27,085
<i>do you think I didn't see you</i>
at the screening last night?

313
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:29,354
<i>- You think I didn't notice you?</i>
- Okay.

314
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:32,022
Fat fuck, trying to hide,
<i>like you're Mr. Inconspicuous.</i>

315
00:17:32,098 --> 00:17:35,158
- Get out!
- Are you going back tonight for part two?

316
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:36,599
I might be.

317
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:45,839
What do you think?
<i>Do you think it's gonna work?</i>

318
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:48,175
I hope it works. It was painful.

319
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:52,017
<i>You don't think Michaelson's wife...</i>
<i>Do you think she's gonna have...</i>

320
00:17:52,084 --> 00:17:53,915
<i>She's not gonna have</i>
any problem with this?

321
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:56,181
- With the head, just the head?
<i>- That's fine.</i>

322
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,450
<i>She's got the body. You're fine.</i>

323
00:17:58,524 --> 00:18:00,856
<i>- We'll just attach it.</i>
- Attach the head.

324
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:05,863
<i>Yeah, good, that's fine.</i>
<i>Boy, that's starting to itch me down there.</i>

325
00:18:08,434 --> 00:18:10,493
<i>What's wrong, Sammy, darling?</i>

326
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:13,663
<i>Mommy, somebody cut off Judy's head!</i>

327
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:20,937
Yeah?

328
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,374
Judy, I got Judy.

329
00:18:25,217 --> 00:18:26,878
<i>Where's her body?</i>

330
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:30,679
<i>It didn't come with a body.</i>

331
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:42,060
- Is this an authentic Judy?
- Believe me, that is Judy.

332
00:18:44,336 --> 00:18:47,464
<i>All right. Why don't you come in?</i>

333
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,031
<i>I'll take it upstairs and make sure it fits.</i>

334
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,202
<i>Don't worry, it's gonna fit.</i>

335
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,837
<i>We'll just see about that.</i>

336
00:18:55,514 --> 00:18:57,914
- May I use your bathroom?
- Yeah.

337
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:03,654
Right here, in the hall.

338
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,618
- How are you doing?
- Good.

339
00:19:10,696 --> 00:19:12,789
- Putting a new lock in?
- A new lock.

340
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:14,890
Beautiful, excellent.

341
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,491
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

342
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:20,461
<i>- Don't leave your post, okay?</i>
- Sure.

343
00:19:34,086 --> 00:19:36,577
<i>That's great.</i>

344
00:19:37,256 --> 00:19:39,816
<i>- I think she's fixed.</i>
- Terrific.

345
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:44,822
- So, thank you. I appreciate it.
<i>- You're very welcome, and again...</i>

346
00:19:44,964 --> 00:19:49,333
<i>I'm just sorry about</i>
<i>the whole thing and cutting it and...</i>

347
00:19:50,536 --> 00:19:51,935
You think this is gonna be okay?

348
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:54,199
Do you think
<i>she's gonna notice the difference?</i>

349
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,503
<i>No, she'll never know the difference really.</i>

350
00:19:56,675 --> 00:20:00,634
If she does, you should enroll her
at some kind of school for gifted children.

351
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:03,739
<i>She's already at Merman.</i>
<i>She is gifted, she's highly gifted.</i>

352
00:20:04,683 --> 00:20:06,241
We might not be able to pull it off.

353
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:11,255
<i>Yeah, it's a shame she didn't know</i>
<i>that the hair wasn't gonna grow back, yeah.</i>

354
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:14,616
<i>I mean, 'cause she's a bright girl.</i>

355
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:19,895
- She has a vivid imagination.
<i>- No, I'm sure she does.</i>

356
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:24,834
<i>Anyway, so again, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You'll be at part 2?</i>

357
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,498
<i>- Yeah, I'll be there.</i>
- Yeah, okay, great.

358
00:20:27,573 --> 00:20:30,440
<i>- All right, all's well that ends well.</i>
- Bye-bye.

359
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:35,375
You know, I actually think
she looked pretty good with the short hair.

360
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:48,082
- No.
- Shit.

361
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,354
God.

362
00:20:56,569 --> 00:20:58,230
<i>Where's the head?</i>

363
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:04,333
<i>I know you took the doll's head. Where is it?</i>

364
00:21:06,045 --> 00:21:08,070
<i>Where's the fucking head?</i>

365
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,306
<i>I don't know.</i>

366
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:14,649
The kid is home hysterical...

367
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,214
because her doll, Judy,
has been decapitated...

368
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:21,356
<i>'cause you 2 sickos...</i>

369
00:21:21,427 --> 00:21:24,590
took the head for God knows what reason...

370
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,325
<i>some voodoo shit you're doing. Where is it?</i>

371
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:33,297
Stop scratching your balls
and tell me where it is!

372
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:36,473
Just get me the fucking head, all right?

373
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:42,204
<i>Both of you, 'cause I've had it,</i>
you four-eyed fuck and you fat piece of shit!

374
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:43,908
Get me the head!

375
00:21:49,688 --> 00:21:54,216
<i>- I didn't need that. Man, she's nuts.</i>
- What the hell are we gonna do now?

376
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:56,358
I could drive back to the Michaelsons.

377
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:58,953
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>she's gonna give us the head back.</i>

378
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:00,623
No, I guess not.

379
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,965
- What are you doing?
- My penis itches me.

380
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:07,870
<i>Maybe she's got the short-haired version.</i>

381
00:22:08,374 --> 00:22:11,502
- We can get the short-haired Judy back.
- Yeah.

382
00:22:12,077 --> 00:22:15,638
- She may have thrown her out.
- No, we were just there.

383
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:19,708
What about giving the short-haired head
back to Susie and your daughter?

384
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:21,047
<i>They won't know the difference.</i>

385
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,247
<i>Your daughter's won't know</i>
that the hair was cut?

386
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:26,291
<i>My daughter andlor Susie</i>
are not gonna know the difference.

387
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,018
- You think so?
- I know we can get away with that.

388
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:32,287
- My penis is itching.
- You know what?

389
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:34,465
You put that doll head down there...

390
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,558
and who knows
what the hair is made out of?

391
00:22:36,635 --> 00:22:39,195
<i>You've got an allergic reaction,</i>
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

392
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:41,865
Yeah, I think I got some kind of rash.

393
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:44,342
I gotta check out my penis.

394
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:48,275
I have to go to the doctor now?
<i>That's gonna be a lot of fun.</i>

395
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:50,109
<i>"Where did you get the rash?"</i>

396
00:22:50,182 --> 00:22:53,083
<i>"I stuck a doll's head</i>
down my pants, Doctor.

397
00:22:53,152 --> 00:22:55,017
<i>"It feels good to me."</i>

398
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:01,926
<i>Hi, I'm sorry to bother you.</i>

399
00:23:02,828 --> 00:23:06,229
<i>I was wondering...</i>
This is gonna sound a little crazy.

400
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:10,496
Do you have the short-haired head...

401
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,500
the one that I cut?

402
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:17,471
Right, you want the short-haired Judy head?

403
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:18,735
Yeah.

404
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:22,213
Why would you want
that short-haired Judy head?

405
00:23:23,582 --> 00:23:26,312
I just like it, you know.

406
00:23:30,355 --> 00:23:33,518
<i>Okay, you know what? I don't know.</i>
<i>I'll go and see if it's there.</i>

407
00:23:33,592 --> 00:23:34,854
<i>Thank you, I'd appreciate it.</i>

408
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:35,950
- Fine.
- Thank you.

409
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:38,554
- Just wait right here.
- May I use your bathroom?

410
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:41,758
<i>- Yeah, it's right-</i>
<i>- I know, it's right over here.</i>

411
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:15,557
<i>- The lock's not working.</i>
- I know. I had to go get some parts.

412
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:16,965
Great.

413
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:22,538
- Look at this.
<i>- It's your lucky day.</i>

414
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:25,839
Okay, great, thank you so much.

415
00:24:28,113 --> 00:24:31,082
The short-hair,
<i>it's very becoming I think, you know?</i>

416
00:24:33,051 --> 00:24:35,042
Yeah, fine. Good.

417
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,279
Okay.

418
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:43,325
- See you tonight, part 2.
- Right.

419
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:49,496
You are not gonna believe what I just saw.

420
00:25:01,013 --> 00:25:03,345
<i>It's your daughter, too, you know.</i>

421
00:25:03,916 --> 00:25:05,247
All right.

422
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:08,248
<i>Something's not right here.</i>

423
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,151
<i>That's the head.</i>

424
00:25:10,956 --> 00:25:13,720
- This is the head?
<i>- That's Judy.</i>

425
00:25:13,926 --> 00:25:16,326
This is not the head.
<i>There's something wrong.</i>

426
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:19,523
<i>- Sure, it's the head, that's the head.</i>
- Are you sure?

427
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:20,826
Yeah.

428
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,397
- Something seems off.
<i>- I don't know. All right, we brought it back.</i>

429
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:26,198
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

430
00:25:26,972 --> 00:25:30,601
- See you at part 2? You going tonight?
- Yeah, maybe.

431
00:25:40,185 --> 00:25:42,915
Is your assistant going out with anybody?

432
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:45,252
<i>You're not going out</i>
with my assistant, okay?

433
00:25:45,324 --> 00:25:47,690
- I just asked you a question.
<i>- No, it's too weird.</i>

434
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:49,488
How do you know I wanna go out with her?

435
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:52,155
<i>I know what you're talking about.</i>
<i>I'm not an idiot.</i>

436
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:55,860
- Quiet, Susie can hear you.
- Hi, how are you?

437
00:25:57,803 --> 00:26:00,203
- God, the Michaelsons.
- My God.

438
00:26:00,272 --> 00:26:03,435
- The little girl. She got the doll.
- Beautiful.

439
00:26:03,575 --> 00:26:06,066
- Look at that.
<i>- Everything's good.</i>

440
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:08,206
There are the Davids.

441
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:13,874
<i>Honestly, I can't even look at that guy now.</i>

442
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:16,648
It makes me sick to my stomach.

443
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:41,471
<i>You know what? I'll be right back.</i>
<i>I'm going to the bathroom.</i>

444
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:55,855
- Cheryl.
- What?

445
00:26:55,928 --> 00:26:58,089
- Come here for a second.
- What?

446
00:26:58,597 --> 00:27:00,997
Do me a favor.
<i>See if anybody is in the ladies' room?</i>

447
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:02,090
Why?

448
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:05,000
<i>It's an olfactory nightmare</i>
<i>in that men's room.</i>

449
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:07,938
Is anybody in here?

450
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:11,542
- Coast is clear.
- Great, 2 minutes.

451
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,305
2 minutes, okay.

452
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,576
- Hello.
- Hi.

453
00:27:55,654 --> 00:27:59,215
<i>- Thank you for fixing Judy's hair.</i>
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

454
00:28:03,628 --> 00:28:08,497
Mommy, that bum is in the bathroom
<i>and there's something hard in his pants!</i>
