1
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:33,404
- How are we doing?
- All right.

2
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,846
Feeling all right?
No uncomfortable sensations?

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:38,885
- No, how much longer?
- Maybe 10 to 15 more minutes.

4
00:00:38,952 --> 00:00:41,386
- Very good.
- Yes.

5
00:00:41,588 --> 00:00:44,250
<i>Yeah. I think you'll be very happy</i>
with the treatment.

6
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:45,416
Really?

7
00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,722
You actually think
<i>you're gonna fix my neck?</i>

8
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:52,197
Of course, I absolutely guarantee it
if you follow my prescribed course.

9
00:00:52,866 --> 00:00:55,494
- Four to six weeks, maybe twice a week.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:55,569 --> 00:00:59,471
Forgive me for sounding a little cynical,
<i>but I've heard that before.</i>

11
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:00,563
You have?

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,542
<i>I've been to a lot of different people.</i>
They all kind of tell me the same thing.

13
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:06,374
- Really?
- I never get any results.

14
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:09,938
<i>I've been to doctors and chiropractors</i>
and healers...

15
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:12,246
people who call themselves healers.

16
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,480
Yeah, healers. What a joke that is.

17
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:16,488
Well, I understand your concerns.

18
00:01:16,556 --> 00:01:18,956
But acupuncture has been
around for a long time...

19
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:21,619
<i>and it's been in my family</i>
for several hundred years.

20
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:23,060
- Yeah?
- Yes.

21
00:01:23,764 --> 00:01:26,130
I absolutely guarantee total recovery.

22
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,461
- You do?
- Yes.

23
00:01:27,534 --> 00:01:30,935
<i>Okay, I'll tell you what.</i>
I got a little proposition for you.

24
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:34,697
<i>If you can fix my neck, I'll give you $5,000.</i>

25
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:38,669
<i>And if you can't,</i>
<i>then I don't pay for any of the treatments.</i>

26
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:41,009
- $5,000?
- $5,000.

27
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,976
- If I treat you and you recover?
- Yep.

28
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:47,310
- And if you do not recover, I get nothing?
- You get nothing.

29
00:01:47,387 --> 00:01:50,151
Well, it would be like taking candy
<i>from a baby, but...</i>

30
00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:51,451
- Really?
- Yes.

31
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:53,425
I love you. I love your confidence.

32
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:58,055
Wait a minute now, if I cure you,
how would I know if you are cured or not?

33
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:01,726
What are you saying?
<i>You're saying that I wouldn't tell you?</i>

34
00:02:01,802 --> 00:02:04,270
<i>So I wouldn't have to pay the money?</i>
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

35
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:08,034
<i>- Come on, I'm a man of honor.</i>
<i>- It's a family tradition, honor.</i>

36
00:02:08,108 --> 00:02:11,976
<i>It's not in my family,</i>
<i>but I'm trying to break the mold.</i>

37
00:02:12,045 --> 00:02:13,740
All right, done.

38
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:16,079
I hope you win.

39
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:27,953
Larry?

40
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:30,024
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

41
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,861
How you doing?

42
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,871
<i>- It's Barry.</i>
- Yeah.

43
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:47,812
<i>What the...</i>

44
00:02:48,048 --> 00:02:51,040
<i>You don't have to look at me that way,</i>
no need for pity.

45
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:55,451
<i>No, I mean, I'm just shocked</i>
to see you here working.

46
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:59,552
- How long you been doing this?
<i>- It's been a while.</i>

47
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:02,421
What do you want?

48
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:08,465
Quarter-pound of swiss
and a half-pound of turkey.

49
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,801
All right.

50
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:15,140
Do you ever hear from any of those guys
<i>at Saturday Night Live?</i>

51
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,268
You know, sometimes
you run into somebody, you know?

52
00:03:18,345 --> 00:03:21,712
- I talk to Elliot and Andy occasionally.
<i>- Yeah, how's Elliot doing?</i>

53
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:23,146
- Good.
- Yeah?

54
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:25,946
<i>The writing wasn't happening?</i>

55
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:28,954
You know,
<i>I just couldn't write for TV anymore.</i>

56
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:34,418
But things are going good, except for
this thing with my dad, a situation.

57
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:36,862
- You remember my dad?
- Yeah.

58
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,125
He came to your house, yeah, I remember.

59
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,531
<i>Yeah, he's doing this, like...</i>

60
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,766
- this weird number on me-
- Try and put that on the swiss if you can.

61
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,570
- I covered my mouth.
- Yeah, sure.

62
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:54,046
Yeah, so, my dad is just doing this,
<i>he's basically dying is what's happening.</i>

63
00:03:54,114 --> 00:03:58,642
And he had a triple bypass,
a quadruple bypass.

64
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:01,583
<i>Boy, he's got seven total bases there, yeah.</i>

65
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:04,051
<i>And he's left me the money in his will.</i>

66
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:06,422
<i>But he won't let me have any of it,</i>
you know?

67
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:09,394
<i>Not a penny, until, like, he's actually dead.</i>

68
00:04:09,462 --> 00:04:11,726
<i>Your father's got a lot of money,</i>
<i>doesn't he?</i>

69
00:04:11,798 --> 00:04:13,959
<i>Yeah, you know, and so, it's...</i>

70
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:17,435
<i>- He knows you're working in a deli?</i>
- Yeah, of course he does, yeah.

71
00:04:17,504 --> 00:04:20,735
<i>And won't give you the money until he dies?</i>
Why do people do that?

72
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:23,901
<i>I don't know why you have to wait</i>
<i>until he dies. That's crazy.</i>

73
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,673
<i>You'd think that he would want his kid</i>
to be happy...

74
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:29,146
as his last memories of him, you know?

75
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:32,673
Are you guys out of peanut butter here?
<i>Because I can't find it.</i>

76
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:35,147
Hey, let me ask you something.

77
00:04:36,356 --> 00:04:40,417
<i>It's amazing that you came in here today.</i>
It could really help me out.

78
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,927
I need to borrow $5,000.

79
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:44,054
Of course you do.

80
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,893
- So I can-
- Yeah, of course.

81
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:49,458
<i>I'll be able to pay you back</i>
as soon as he, you know, as he goes.

82
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:52,096
<i>Yeah, when do you expect that'll be?</i>

83
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:54,606
Very soon.

84
00:04:56,209 --> 00:04:58,200
Okay, tell me if I got this right.

85
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:00,644
- You gave $5,000 to the acupuncturist?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:00,714 --> 00:05:03,046
And $5,000 to that asshole, Barry Weiner?

87
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:04,344
Asshole.

88
00:05:05,418 --> 00:05:09,946
So, in the last three hours,
<i>you've given away $10,000.</i>

89
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,786
<i>Yeah, that's not quite accurate.</i>

90
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,023
<i>I haven't paid the acupuncturist yet.</i>
He has to cure my neck.

91
00:05:17,097 --> 00:05:19,622
<i>And I'll be happy to give it to him if he does.</i>

92
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,930
<i>And Weiner's father has a heart condition...</i>

93
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:26,837
<i>and he's not supposed to live that long,</i>
<i>and then he'll give me the money back.</i>

94
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,067
<i>I don't know why you call him an asshole.</i>
Is he?

95
00:05:29,142 --> 00:05:32,009
<i>- He's not an asshole, he's just shy.</i>
<i>- No, he's not shy.</i>

96
00:05:32,078 --> 00:05:34,012
<i>He thinks he's smarter</i>
than everybody else...

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,277
- and he sits there and he judges-
<i>- No, he doesn't, he's just shy.</i>

98
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:39,944
<i>It's just that you got shy-asshole confusion,</i>
my friend.

99
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,545
<i>- No, I don't think so, my friend.</i>
- Yes, I think so.

100
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,318
People come to you with their hands out,
<i>you can't say no?</i>

101
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,383
I have trouble saying no.

102
00:05:48,061 --> 00:05:49,392
You know why?

103
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:52,659
<i>'Cause you're a pussy. I'm just being frank.</i>

104
00:05:52,732 --> 00:05:55,530
<i>Maybe I'm nice.</i>
You have nice-pussy confusion.

105
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:57,035
<i>Maybe I'm just nice.</i>

106
00:05:57,103 --> 00:06:01,597
And he invited us
<i>to his wife's surprise birthday party...</i>

107
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:03,973
<i>and I couldn't say no to that either.</i>

108
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,342
Hey there, flowers for Larry David.

109
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:10,482
Cheryl, somebody sent me flowers.

110
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:13,417
Are those from your mistress
<i>and you haven't told me?</i>

111
00:06:13,486 --> 00:06:15,386
- Yeah, I wish.
- Thanks.

112
00:06:15,755 --> 00:06:17,985
Did you give him a $5,000 tip?

113
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:21,059
This is really bizarre.

114
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:23,619
Flowers.

115
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:27,699
- Who would send you flowers?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

116
00:06:28,034 --> 00:06:29,558
<i>They're pretty.</i>

117
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:32,801
<i>"Enjoy these beautiful orchids. Kazu."</i>

118
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:36,970
<i>- Who's Kazu?</i>
- The acupuncturist.

119
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:44,515
Why is the acupuncturist
giving you flowers?

120
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,086
<i>I don't know.</i>

121
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,526
So, you know,
<i>working in the deli, it was just...</i>

122
00:06:54,594 --> 00:06:57,154
It was depressing to see him like that.

123
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,960
Did you even know,
did you know he was working there?

124
00:07:00,033 --> 00:07:01,967
<i>I didn't know he was working in the deli.</i>

125
00:07:02,035 --> 00:07:05,061
He keeps in contact with me.
<i>He doesn't let me know that stuff.</i>

126
00:07:05,138 --> 00:07:08,164
Boy.<i>
"There, but for the grace of God, go you."</i>

127
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,937
- Go me, not you?
- No, not me.

128
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,500
Yeah, go me.

129
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:17,141
He invited me to a surprise party
next Thursday night for his wife.

130
00:07:17,317 --> 00:07:20,411
<i>- You're going?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'll pick you up, we'll go together.</i>

131
00:07:20,487 --> 00:07:23,285
So, what do you think
of this whole orchid thing?

132
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:26,056
<i>I think it's some sort of Japanese gay thing.</i>

133
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,286
- Really?
- Yeah.

134
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,725
<i>It's a little strange.</i>

135
00:07:28,795 --> 00:07:32,322
<i>I don't know if I'll even go back to him</i>
<i>'cause of this.</i>

136
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:34,760
<i>Would you? I don't know?</i>
Would you go back?

137
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,769
<i>I mean, that's a weird thing.</i>
<i>I wouldn't go back.</i>

138
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,067
Let me ask you a question.

139
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,574
Is it common in Japan
for a man to send another man orchids?

140
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:46,612
A professional man?

141
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,140
<i>Doctor, or a...</i>

142
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,121
<i>I knew you'd open up a can of worms</i>
just by starting to ask him.

143
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,385
<i>- He's been weird all lunch.</i>
- What the hell?

144
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:01,324
<i>- I don't know what that was.</i>
- What was that?

145
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:04,420
<i>- That guy's a freak.</i>
- I think I struck a chord.

146
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:08,332
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

147
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,199
<i>- It's been a few days.</i>
- This is my manager, Jeff Greene.

148
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,432
- Jeff, nice to meet you.
- Heard a lot about you.

149
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:16,339
The estate lawyer,
<i>he's gonna handle my estate when I die...</i>

150
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:17,933
and I leave you all my money.

151
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,639
Have you worked it out that way?
Cheryl will love me.

152
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:23,648
<i>- You're not working today?</i>
<i>- Yeah, I'm going back right now.</i>

153
00:08:23,716 --> 00:08:25,946
<i>- What's with the outfit?</i>
<i>- It's Casual Friday.</i>

154
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,954
<i>- I don't like this Casual Friday.</i>
- What are you, my mother?

155
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,582
<i>You know, you're encroaching</i>
in my territory.

156
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:35,153
I want you people to be uncomfortable
all the time.

157
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:38,129
<i>If you don't like this,</i>
you should come by on Naked Tuesdays.

158
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:41,725
Yeah, Naked Tuesdays.
<i>See? He's a funny lawyer.</i>

159
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:45,259
- All right, I gotta go. Okay, nice to meet you.
<i>- All right, I'll see you.</i>

160
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:47,067
<i>I'll see you Tuesday.</i>

161
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,768
Casual Friday. Pisses me off.

162
00:08:51,578 --> 00:08:54,138
<i>I'm telling you,</i>
<i>soon it's going to be Casual Monday.</i>

163
00:08:54,214 --> 00:08:55,806
Five to 10 years.

164
00:08:55,982 --> 00:08:59,748
<i>That's the direction we're heading.</i>
<i>It's gonna be a sad state of affairs.</i>

165
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:03,118
People like you
walking around like people like me.

166
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,984
<i>- It's no good.</i>
<i>- I'll never do it.</i>

167
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,754
<i>Yeah, wait'll you taste this flambé,</i>
<i>I'm telling you...</i>

168
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:11,194
- it is sensational.
<i>- Larry, that's why we came.</i>

169
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,429
Here we go. Beautiful.

170
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,171
So, I got a meeting set up for you at ABC.

171
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:28,442
- Just got to confirm a date with Julia.
- Okay.

172
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:30,946
- Oh, my God.
- Jesus!

173
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,829
- Honey?
- What?

174
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:54,965
<i>- Where's Jeff?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

175
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,441
<i>- He should've been here 15 minutes ago.</i>
- I know.

176
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,535
Why are we even riding with him anyway?

177
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:01,944
<i>I don't know,</i>
he asked me if he could pick us up.

178
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:03,346
<i>And you couldn't say no.</i>

179
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,680
Listen, I think we should just go
without him.

180
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:07,117
<i>He'll, I'm sure-</i>

181
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:10,385
- There he is.
<i>- There he is. Okay, let's get going.</i>

182
00:10:10,456 --> 00:10:14,187
- Hi. Thank you.
- Look how pretty you look.

183
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,955
- Thank you.
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

184
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:19,294
- You look pretty, too.
<i>- I'm a pretty little girl.</i>

185
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:20,525
Larry!

186
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:24,398
What are you doing?
What took you so long?

187
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,166
Room service was late with my food.
What do you want?

188
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,264
No.

189
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,801
<i>- You're not wearing that.</i>
- What, why?

190
00:10:30,877 --> 00:10:32,845
<i>You're not wearing jeans to this party.</i>

191
00:10:32,912 --> 00:10:36,075
<i>- They're not jeans, they're corduroy pants.</i>
<i>- That's the same thing.</i>

192
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,811
And a blue sweatshirt
and a black jacket, no.

193
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:42,082
<i>- Blue and black, that's no good?</i>
<i>- That's no good. You need to change.</i>

194
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,713
Since when is blue and black no good?

195
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,124
Trust me on this one, please.
<i>You're gonna have to change. And quickly.</i>

196
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:50,353
- You look terrible.
<i>- It's awful.</i>

197
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,593
Maybe I have a lime-green T-shirt like yours
to put on, asshole.

198
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,566
<i>What's wrong with a lime-green T-shirt?</i>

199
00:10:55,635 --> 00:10:57,865
- No, it looks good.
- Thank you.

200
00:11:01,941 --> 00:11:03,704
<i>No, I completely...</i>

201
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:09,412
- Shit.
- Oh, my God.

202
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,811
- Cheryl.
- Hi, Carol.

203
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,218
<i>My God, I don't know who to hug.</i>

204
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:19,190
- Hi, so good to see you.
<i>- I hope...</i>

205
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,519
<i>Yeah, I left my sun...</i>
I was in the deli the other day.

206
00:11:22,595 --> 00:11:26,053
I left my sunglasses there
and I came by to pick them up.

207
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:29,499
Oh, my gosh. This is so bizarre.

208
00:11:29,569 --> 00:11:31,332
- So, you got them, right?
- Yeah.

209
00:11:31,404 --> 00:11:34,271
<i>Why don't you go?</i>
<i>You know, you two go in, we'll wait here.</i>

210
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,274
What is that?

211
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:38,269
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

212
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:42,480
<i>- That's why we got you a birthday gift.</i>
- He told us it was your birthday.

213
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:44,413
<i>'Cause he told me it was your birthday.</i>

214
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:46,952
So, I knew I would stop by
<i>for the sunglasses and I...</i>

215
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,113
<i>It's from the three of us.</i>

216
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:52,282
<i>- There's a surprise party in that house.</i>
- Honey.

217
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:57,258
<i>You're having a surprise party?</i>
<i>What, you didn't invite us?</i>

218
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,232
<i>- I'm so sorry, Carol.</i>
- He had to change his outfit.

219
00:12:02,402 --> 00:12:04,131
You are so selfish.

220
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:09,836
Surprise!

221
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,307
Yeah, great, thanks.

222
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,245
Happy?

223
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,883
You knew? What happened?

224
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,849
Larry had to change his outfit...

225
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,889
and it was just
a tremendous amount of time.

226
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:26,322
He had to eat, you know...

227
00:12:26,793 --> 00:12:29,125
have a big dinner for two hours.

228
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,026
<i>Oh, my God, you guys...</i>

229
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:34,396
Sit down, have a big fucking meal
in the hotel.

230
00:12:40,807 --> 00:12:44,265
Do you believe them?
Do you believe what they did to me?

231
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:46,504
I mean, 600,000 people.

232
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:49,908
600,000 people died in the Civil War.

233
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,450
And for what, to save the Union?

234
00:12:52,518 --> 00:12:55,146
Why did we want to save the Union?
Who cares?

235
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:56,688
<i>I don't know, I don't care.</i>

236
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:59,748
What is important about saving the Union?
Do you need the South?

237
00:12:59,826 --> 00:13:03,023
- What do you do?
- I do a lot of work for the NRDC.

238
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:06,591
NRDC? What the hell is that?

239
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,231
The Natural Resources Defense Council.

240
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:12,396
<i>- You're an environmentalist?</i>
- I am. I guess you could say that.

241
00:13:12,472 --> 00:13:13,700
<i>- That's wonderful.</i>
- Thank you.

242
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:17,675
I mean, I wish my worthless son
could get into something like that...

243
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:19,870
<i>- but no, there's no chance of that.</i>
- No.

244
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,506
Do you believe my wife
made me change clothes...

245
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:24,743
before I came here?
<i>She didn't like my outfit.</i>

246
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,980
- You look good, though.
<i>- I didn't get outfit approval tonight.</i>

247
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,852
- Do you get that? Outfit approval?
- Yeah.

248
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:33,619
They got to approve your outfit.
I listened to her.

249
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:36,491
- I actually went up to change.
- Right.

250
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,631
<i>That's one of the reasons</i>
that, you know, we were late.

251
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,133
<i>'Cause I listened to her.</i>

252
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:45,534
If not for the environment,
<i>then we're fighting to get money...</i>

253
00:13:45,605 --> 00:13:48,938
- so we can fight for the environment.
- Money? You always need money.

254
00:13:49,008 --> 00:13:53,001
<i>- It's a non-profit organization, so...</i>
- You never called me.

255
00:13:53,446 --> 00:13:57,610
<i>- No, I didn't. I didn't know you-</i>
<i>- You know, I'm not poor.</i>

256
00:13:57,717 --> 00:13:59,082
<i>- You aren't?</i>
- No.

257
00:13:59,152 --> 00:14:01,882
- Mr. Weiner, maybe we should talk.
- Call me C.D.

258
00:14:01,954 --> 00:14:03,854
What does C.D. stand for?

259
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,157
<i>Let's see.</i>
<i>It might stand for "certified deposit".</i>

260
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:12,293
- For the NRDC.
- I like the sound of that.

261
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:13,457
- Yes.
- Yes.

262
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,194
You want to have lunch?

263
00:14:15,268 --> 00:14:19,796
<i>And we'll talk about how we can arrange</i>
maybe my contributing something?

264
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,405
Oh, my gosh, that would be wonderful.

265
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:25,535
<i>But we're not just gonna talk about money.</i>

266
00:14:25,611 --> 00:14:28,171
- Of course not.
<i>- We'll talk about each other.</i>

267
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,979
- Okay.
<i>- I'd like to get to know you.</i>

268
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:33,548
<i>I'd like to get to know you, too.</i>

269
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:36,417
<i>Oh, my God, you're gonna give me</i>
another heart attack.

270
00:14:36,489 --> 00:14:38,286
Stop it, Mr. Weiner.

271
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,992
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my goodness.

272
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:43,324
<i>You're so charming and beautiful.</i>

273
00:14:43,396 --> 00:14:46,024
<i>I don't know how that schlep</i>
ever married you.

274
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:48,023
- Me neither.
- No?

275
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:53,666
You know what I mean.

276
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:56,037
I think I do know what you mean.

277
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:58,474
I mean it very sincerely.

278
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,307
<i>- You remember Barry's father?</i>
- I sure do. How you doing?

279
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,577
- How are you?
- Good.

280
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:06,982
Good to see you.

281
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:10,648
<i>Please excuse me to the ladies' room.</i>
<i>Larry, why don't you have a seat here?</i>

282
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:13,385
- And chat with Mr. Weiner.
- You will be back, though?

283
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:15,950
- I will be back.
<i>- 'Cause he can't fill in for you.</i>

284
00:15:16,028 --> 00:15:18,826
<i>No, he can't. But he'll do his best.</i>
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

285
00:15:18,898 --> 00:15:21,128
<i>- You'll come right back.</i>
- Yeah.

286
00:15:22,868 --> 00:15:24,233
Oh, my God.

287
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,335
What a treat. Oh, God.

288
00:15:33,112 --> 00:15:35,376
Is it a custom in Japan...

289
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:38,110
for a man to send...

290
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,085
orchids to another man?

291
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:44,287
Like a professional,
<i>someone who's a professional...</i>

292
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:47,986
a doctor or a dentist or an acupuncturist?

293
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:51,661
Now, how the hell
would I know what that means?

294
00:15:51,731 --> 00:15:53,858
<i>I don't know what they do in Japan.</i>

295
00:15:53,933 --> 00:15:57,096
They might take it up the ass
for all I know in Japan.

296
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:00,434
What are you asking me for?
<i>It's a stupid question.</i>

297
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:05,507
- So, what are you doing these days?
<i>- I'm working on a...</i>

298
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,237
Actually, a new show
for Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

299
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:11,283
<i>- From Seinfeld?</i>
- Yeah.

300
00:16:11,417 --> 00:16:13,977
You got to be kidding me.

301
00:16:14,387 --> 00:16:17,481
- How do you know her?
- I worked on the show.

302
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:19,290
<i>What show? Seinfeld?</i>

303
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:21,758
<i>- Yeah, Seinfeld.</i>
- What did you do?

304
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,990
- I was the co-creator.
- You must have made a bundle.

305
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:27,664
I did okay.

306
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:31,562
<i>- You're a lucky bastard.</i>
<i>- I am, I'm very lucky.</i>

307
00:16:31,637 --> 00:16:33,195
<i>And I'll tell you something.</i>

308
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:37,902
<i>I'm lucky that I had a father</i>
who was so supportive of me...

309
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,343
because without him
it never would have happened.

310
00:16:40,413 --> 00:16:42,904
I was working in a dry cleaner.
<i>I didn't tell him.</i>

311
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:45,815
I had no money,
but I needed to support myself.

312
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:48,786
<i>And then one day, he found out about it...</i>

313
00:16:50,056 --> 00:16:53,423
Next thing I knew, he said to me,
<i>"Listen, I got a lot of money.</i>

314
00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:57,121
<i>"I'm gonna give you this money anyway,</i>
after I die.

315
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,686
<i>"Let me give you some now."</i>

316
00:16:58,764 --> 00:17:01,528
- Your father left you money before he died?
- Yes, he did.

317
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,364
He gave me a quarter
of what I was gonna get in the will...

318
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,769
and that enabled me to go out
and start writing.

319
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,808
<i>I never would have gotten Seinfeld</i>
if not for him.

320
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:14,671
I was able to put food in the refrigerator,
when he came over...

321
00:17:14,747 --> 00:17:16,305
he had great things to eat.

322
00:17:16,382 --> 00:17:19,818
I bought a Barcalounger,
a big-screen TV with the money.

323
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:22,718
<i>When he'd come over to my house,</i>
he could sit and relax.

324
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:26,383
<i>Why should he wait until he's dead</i>
<i>to give me the money? It's ridiculous.</i>

325
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:29,257
Listen, put a sock in it.

326
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:31,853
I got to move fast.
Do you know of an estate lawyer?

327
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:34,832
<i>My lawyer's in Acapulco.</i>
I need an estate lawyer right away.

328
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,164
Yeah, I know a great estate lawyer.
Joel Reynolds.

329
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:38,533
I ran into him the other day.

330
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:41,198
- Reynolds. Where is he?
<i>- He's in Santa Monica.</i>

331
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:42,604
<i>Reynolds and McKay, he's great.</i>

332
00:17:42,675 --> 00:17:44,438
<i>- He's good with estates?</i>
<i>- He's terrific.</i>

333
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,877
Probate and that kind of stuff?
I gotta make a change right away...

334
00:17:47,947 --> 00:17:50,006
<i>and I can't wait for my lawyer.</i>

335
00:17:50,082 --> 00:17:53,142
Thank you for the lawyer.
And I love your wife.

336
00:17:53,386 --> 00:17:55,616
What kind of change?
What are you talking about?

337
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,280
<i>You'll find out.</i>

338
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:05,925
<i>I don't know, Cheryl.</i>
<i>Maybe he'll make a contribution.</i>

339
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:08,796
The worst that can happen is
<i>you'll fly to Mexico with him...</i>

340
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,961
and come back with a big check.

341
00:18:13,172 --> 00:18:16,835
Where are you meeting for lunch?
<i>That's the Japanese restaurant.</i>

342
00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:19,241
I was there with Jeff last week.

343
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,043
<i>Barry Weiner's here.</i>

344
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:26,584
All right, listen,
get as much money as you can from him.

345
00:18:26,652 --> 00:18:28,847
Be charming. Okay, goodbye.

346
00:18:29,054 --> 00:18:31,818
What did you do? What the hell did you do?

347
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:35,122
Did you tell my father some story
about a dry cleaner?

348
00:18:35,995 --> 00:18:40,364
I told him that I worked in a dry cleaner,
and my father found out about it...

349
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,799
and instead of giving me the money
after he died...

350
00:18:42,868 --> 00:18:44,665
he gave it to me before he died.

351
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:47,137
Your little conspiracy with Cheryl worked.

352
00:18:47,206 --> 00:18:49,037
He cut me out of the will, Larry.

353
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:52,600
He thinks that I put you up to it,
<i>and now he's cut me out of the will...</i>

354
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,976
and given all his money to NDRC.

355
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:57,675
- NRDC.
- NRDC, whatever the hell it is.

356
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,412
Just like you and Cheryl planned,
your little conspiracy.

357
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:02,886
But why?
When he left last night after the story...

358
00:19:02,955 --> 00:19:04,923
he said he was going to get a lawyer.

359
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,925
- He wanted the name of a lawyer.
- The lawyer that you gave him.

360
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:09,984
<i>He's down there right now, Larry.</i>

361
00:19:10,062 --> 00:19:13,361
He is down there flushing my fucking life
down the toilet.

362
00:19:13,432 --> 00:19:15,957
<i>That's what he's doing now,</i>
thanks to your help.

363
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:18,970
- Hello, Reynolds and McKay.
- Okay, all right.

364
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:20,639
Bye-bye.

365
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:23,332
Hello, sir, Joel Reynolds.

366
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:27,111
<i>- You're Joel Reynolds?</i>
- Yes, I am.

367
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,307
- Would you like to have a seat, sir?
- Yeah, in a minute.

368
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,881
<i>I'm a little puzzled.</i>

369
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:36,379
<i>What's this outfit?</i>
Is it a Halloween party, or what?

370
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:39,822
<i>- I know, it's Casual Friday.</i>
- Casual Friday? What does that mean?

371
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:41,985
That means we just dress
like we would at home.

372
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:45,292
<i>- But you're not at home.</i>
<i>- No, but it is Casual Friday, so...</i>

373
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:49,596
I know, you told me that already.
What do you do on Casual Friday?

374
00:19:49,668 --> 00:19:53,604
We just come in, do our work.
But we dress casually.

375
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:56,703
<i>- I don't like it.</i>
<i>- It's just one day of the week.</i>

376
00:19:56,842 --> 00:20:00,300
<i>I don't give a damn if it's half a day a week.</i>
<i>I don't like it.</i>

377
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:03,342
<i>I'm here to change my will.</i>
A lot of money is involved.

378
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:06,248
<i>- It's very important to me.</i>
<i>- We wouldn't treat you casually.</i>

379
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:07,979
Then why the hell you dress that way?

380
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:11,420
I want you to be on cutting edge
<i>whenever you're handling my business.</i>

381
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,583
- This is cutting edge.
<i>- I don't need this crap.</i>

382
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:18,323
You look like a fucking cowboy.
<i>You're J.R., Joel Reynolds, right?</i>

383
00:20:18,397 --> 00:20:20,763
- Look, we-
- You belong in Dallas, not LA.

384
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:22,300
<i>I'm sorry, please.</i>

385
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:26,771
Yeah, you should be sorry
because you just lost my account.

386
00:20:27,206 --> 00:20:29,504
<i>You go wrangle somebody else's.</i>

387
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:32,810
Thank you very much. Son of a bitch.

388
00:20:32,878 --> 00:20:35,676
If you come back
<i>on a Monday or a Tuesday...</i>

389
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:39,751
You gotta talk to him
<i>and tell him I didn't put you up to that.</i>

390
00:20:39,818 --> 00:20:42,912
You have to convince him.
<i>I'm totally screwed.</i>

391
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:45,453
Wait, hold on.

392
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:48,425
<i>This is Kathleen calling</i>
<i>from Dr. Muriyama's office.</i>

393
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,985
<i>I'm calling to confirm</i>
<i>your acupuncture appointment.</i>

394
00:20:51,063 --> 00:20:52,724
<i>No, I can't do it.</i>

395
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,392
<i>Okay, the doctor just wants to know</i>
<i>how you're feeling.</i>

396
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:57,367
<i>- I'm better.</i>
<i>- That's good.</i>

397
00:20:58,437 --> 00:21:00,928
<i>Would you like to schedule</i>
<i>another session?</i>

398
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,875
- No. Not now.
<i>- Okay, thank you, Mr. David.</i>

399
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:07,337
Okay.

400
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:10,915
You got to get down there.
You got to do something.

401
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:15,511
<i>He's supposed to have lunch with my wife</i>
at this Japanese restaurant later.

402
00:21:15,588 --> 00:21:17,886
<i>You're the only one that can fix it,</i>
you know?

403
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:20,255
- You have to talk to him.
- Shit.

404
00:21:20,993 --> 00:21:22,654
I was just trying to be helpful.

405
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,429
<i>Mr. Weiner, I don't think</i>
I should have anymore sake.

406
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:31,560
- No, you should.
- Maybe after.

407
00:21:31,637 --> 00:21:34,606
<i>Because it's a wonderful preface</i>
to a great Japanese meal.

408
00:21:34,673 --> 00:21:36,004
- Come on.
- Okay.

409
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:40,307
- I think we should go ahead and order then.
- We will order, certainly.

410
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:45,213
But I have some news for you.
First, a little slice.

411
00:21:45,351 --> 00:21:46,511
Larry?

412
00:21:49,355 --> 00:21:54,088
- What are you doing here?
- I just came to apologize for last night...

413
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,060
and just to let you know that
your son did not put me up...

414
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:59,859
to say any of that stuff
<i>that I said to you about...</i>

415
00:21:59,932 --> 00:22:01,866
<i>- He didn't?</i>
<i>- No, he didn't.</i>

416
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:05,734
<i>And he shouldn't be punished</i>
<i>as a result of what I did on...</i>

417
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,722
<i>Why, you shit...</i>

418
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,807
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you. Hello.

419
00:22:46,912 --> 00:22:49,745
<i>Hi, Carol. I'm so sorry.</i>

420
00:22:52,384 --> 00:22:54,375
Everybody, this is Larry David.

421
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:57,155
We used to write together
<i>on Saturday Night Live.</i>

422
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:58,382
A long time ago.

423
00:22:58,457 --> 00:23:00,857
<i>- Here's his wife, Cheryl.</i>
- Hi.

424
00:23:01,593 --> 00:23:05,029
And this is Jeff Greene.
Jeff used to be my manager.

425
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,030
So sudden, unexpected.

426
00:23:15,641 --> 00:23:18,701
Larry, you remember my cousin, Doug,
from the party, Thursday?

427
00:23:18,777 --> 00:23:20,836
- Sure. Hi, Doug.
- Hi.

428
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:25,039
Larry was the last person to see him alive.

429
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,418
- Technically, it was the waiter.
<i>- So, you're the one?</i>

430
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:40,460
- So, what do you do?
<i>- I'm a button man.</i>

431
00:23:40,966 --> 00:23:44,129
- Button man?
- Yes, I sell buttons to the cut-up trade.

432
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:48,435
- Garment manufacturers.
- I got a bellybutton story for you.

433
00:23:49,441 --> 00:23:53,468
My best friend had a baby 15 years ago,
and I was the godfather.

434
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:56,912
I was in the delivery room,
he asked me to cut the umbilical cord...

435
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:59,348
<i>and I don't know,</i>
I kind of botched it somehow...

436
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:01,545
and mangled the whole bellybutton...

437
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:04,919
and now the kid
<i>won't even talk to me, it's...</i>

438
00:24:05,557 --> 00:24:07,787
<i>That's a sad story. Excuse me.</i>

439
00:24:11,096 --> 00:24:12,256
Larry.

440
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,961
- Thank you.
<i>- Back up, man, you're right in my face.</i>

441
00:24:19,037 --> 00:24:20,436
- Okay.
- What?

442
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:25,540
<i>There it is. I told you. Don't cash it for week.</i>

443
00:24:26,545 --> 00:24:27,876
This is a little awkward.

444
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:31,143
<i>I told you you'd get it as soon as he died,</i>
and you made it happen.

445
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:33,480
<i>- I didn't make anything happen.</i>
- You kind of did.

446
00:24:33,552 --> 00:24:36,749
<i>That's just great, Larry,</i>
you got your money back.

447
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:39,780
- What?
- The check.

448
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,056
What check? What are you talking about?

449
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:46,557
Larry lent Barry $5,000.

450
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:49,063
The condition was,
when his dad passed away...

451
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:52,365
- he would get the money back.
- Excuse me, there was no condition.

452
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:55,770
I get it. You took $5,000.
<i>You're a bounty hunter.</i>

453
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:59,538
- You murdered my uncle for $5,000.
- Come on, please.

454
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:03,542
- You knew he had a heart condition.
<i>- I didn't-</i>

455
00:25:03,615 --> 00:25:05,583
Why did you have to throw the water at him?

456
00:25:05,651 --> 00:25:08,552
<i>- I didn't throw the water at him, the waiter-</i>
<i>- You're lying.</i>

457
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,714
<i>The waiter threw the water at him. I didn't...</i>

458
00:25:13,158 --> 00:25:15,683
<i>We should get... Jeff! Let's go.</i>

459
00:25:15,894 --> 00:25:19,694
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>
You killed my uncle, you murderer!

460
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:22,431
- Stop it!
- My neck.

461
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,593
Let go of him!

462
00:25:46,391 --> 00:25:47,949
- Larry-San.
- Hi.

463
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:51,987
- Who was that?
- I got lucky. My wife.

464
00:25:52,965 --> 00:25:54,557
- Your wife?
- Yes.

465
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:59,666
How do you like that? Good for you.

466
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:02,138
Thank you very much. How are you?

467
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:06,611
Somebody got me in a headlock.
I am much worse.

468
00:26:06,812 --> 00:26:10,145
- I think we can do something about that.
<i>- You're a very confident man.</i>

469
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,512
- Yeah?
- You really are.

470
00:26:11,583 --> 00:26:14,950
Say, would you like to make another deal
on that one?

471
00:26:15,687 --> 00:26:17,518
What do you mean, another one?

472
00:26:17,589 --> 00:26:20,456
You already owe me $5,000
for the other one.

473
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:22,755
Would you like a chance
to get it back, maybe?

474
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:23,988
How do I owe you $5,000?

475
00:26:24,062 --> 00:26:26,929
<i>I don't owe you $5,000.</i>
What are you talking about?

476
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:29,866
My receptionist called you
and talked to you on the phone.

477
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:33,894
You told her, and she told me,
that you said that you were better.

478
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:38,075
<i>I said...</i>

479
00:26:38,143 --> 00:26:41,374
Yeah, she asked me how I was feeling.<i>
I said, "Better."</i>

480
00:26:41,546 --> 00:26:44,515
Better than before, not 100%% better...

481
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,676
not all better, but better.

482
00:26:46,752 --> 00:26:51,086
Better? After I treated you,
you were better, right?

483
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:55,920
<i>In English, "better" doesn't mean better,</i>
<i>completely better. I don't need a...</i>

484
00:26:56,395 --> 00:26:59,455
<i>There's a confusion here,</i>
a language confusion.

485
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:02,056
<i>Better is not all better, it's better.</i>

486
00:27:02,134 --> 00:27:05,865
Larry-San, wait a minute, you said better.

487
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:08,839
Better is better, you said you were better.

488
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,203
Listen, Larry-San...

489
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:16,242
this will cause me some great shame
with my family.

490
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:20,615
Everyone knows about this agreement.
My employees, my business.

491
00:27:21,453 --> 00:27:23,921
We made an agreement as men of honor.

492
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:27,117
You owe me $5,000. I made you feel better!

493
00:27:30,195 --> 00:27:33,460
So, how do you intend to pay?

494
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:43,730
I have a check...

495
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:47,270
made out to me for $5,000.

496
00:27:47,612 --> 00:27:49,807
I can endorse it over to you.

497
00:27:50,816 --> 00:27:53,614
<i>- Don't cash it for a week.</i>
- For a week?

498
00:27:54,553 --> 00:27:57,681
<i>Of course, I'll need a picture ID.</i>

499
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:06,394
So, I got the orchids.

500
00:28:09,901 --> 00:28:12,893
They were so nice.
Thank you for sending them.

501
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:20,039
Something you do for all your patients?
Send them orchids?

502
00:28:23,682 --> 00:28:25,809
Ancient Japanese custom.
