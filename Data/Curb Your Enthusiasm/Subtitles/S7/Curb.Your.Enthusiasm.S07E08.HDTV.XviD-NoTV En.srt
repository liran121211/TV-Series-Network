1
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:24,339
Jeez.

2
00:00:24,373 --> 00:00:26,808
What are you doing in there?

3
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,245
- What in the world was that?
- What?

4
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,547
What, do you got seabiscuit
in there with you?

5
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:34,615
- What?
- That was crazy.

6
00:00:34,633 --> 00:00:36,835
- Oh, yeah.
- I never heard a...

7
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:39,254
A stream like that. -

8
00:00:41,173 --> 00:00:43,675
Yeah, I'm taking this new pill.

9
00:00:43,726 --> 00:00:46,060
That is, like, not human, that sound.

10
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:48,730
It's got some backsplash
too. I gotta be careful.

11
00:00:48,764 --> 00:00:49,981
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,900
All right, so... Anyway,

13
00:00:51,934 --> 00:00:55,987
it seems like meg ryan
is just not gonna work,

14
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,605
because her schedule is too busy

15
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:00,158
- and we're not gonna get her.
- Work? Work for what?

16
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:01,943
For george's ex-wife.

17
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:04,863
But lisa kudrow

18
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:06,814
I think would also be great.

19
00:01:06,832 --> 00:01:08,816
- She's a great actress.
- Great actress.

20
00:01:08,834 --> 00:01:10,451
But I think you want...

21
00:01:10,485 --> 00:01:13,371
I think you want to go with
an unknown for this part.

22
00:01:13,422 --> 00:01:16,624
- Why?
- Because you believe that it's real.

23
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:19,093
What's real got to do with what we do?

24
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:21,880
Well, when george's ex-wife
calls him from the plane,

25
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:24,349
right? And, uh...

26
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:26,384
He's got the tivo guy there...

27
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:28,686
- Mm-hmm? - ...
That happened to me

28
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,004
- with cheryl.
- Uh-huh.

29
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:32,724
Cheryl should play this part.

30
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:34,726
Cheryl!

31
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:37,145
Maybe somebody that looks
like cheryl, that's an idea.

32
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:39,147
- No, but she...
- What about renee zellweger?

33
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:42,984
But cheryl, she's unknown
and she lived this part.

34
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:45,987
- And she's an actress!
- So the person that it happens to

35
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:47,922
- is the best actor?
- What else do you want?

36
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:50,825
You think nixon could have
been nixon in "frost/nixon"?

37
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,877
- Nixon's not an actor.
- Neither is cheryl.

38
00:01:52,912 --> 00:01:55,330
- She is.
- All right, let's have her read.

39
00:01:55,364 --> 00:01:57,365
She can read. Maybe she'll get it.

40
00:01:57,383 --> 00:01:59,334
- I'm open to it.
- You're open to it.

41
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:02,136
- Yes.
- Hey, guys, here's the latest scripts.

42
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:04,372
- There you go.
- Thank you very much.

43
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,508
And, oh! Reminder... You
have lunch with richard lewis,

44
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:08,843
- both of you.
- Okay, thanks.

45
00:02:08,877 --> 00:02:10,261
What is that?

46
00:02:10,312 --> 00:02:12,546
Yeah, that air conditioner
is... I don't know.

47
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:14,715
- It's making noise up there.
- Oh, I'll get it.

48
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,484
Oh, here we go. Don't worry about it.

49
00:02:16,518 --> 00:02:18,820
I used to do this for
my mom all the time.

50
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:23,825
Oh, yep, hang on.

51
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:28,947
There we go.

52
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:33,001
It smells like a
rattlesnake is in there.

53
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:34,419
Oh, there...

54
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:37,171
- Does that sound better?
- Yeah, it's a little better.

55
00:02:37,206 --> 00:02:38,206
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,341
There we go.

57
00:02:40,376 --> 00:02:42,460
All right, you guys need anything else?

58
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,928
- Are you good?
- No, we're good.

59
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:45,213
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:47,548
- Okay, thanks, maureen.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:49,801
I can't take it anymore.

62
00:02:49,852 --> 00:02:52,603
- How can she walk around like that?
- Every day.

63
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:54,222
Every day, every day.

64
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:56,024
We have to make a change.

65
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:58,893
We can't. Julia got her the job.

66
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:00,395
We can't fire her.

67
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:02,864
- We have to talk to her.
- Oh, okay.

68
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:04,932
You need to talk to
her about her clothing.

69
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,568
- I... I can't do that.
- What are you talking about?

70
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:09,070
I can't... I can't do it.

71
00:03:09,104 --> 00:03:10,538
Why not?

72
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:13,541
- I don't want to.
- Do you think I want to?

73
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,209
- I don't want to.
- You have to.

74
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:16,277
- I have to?
- Yes.

75
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,962
Are you crazy? You do it.

76
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:21,549
No, but you... It's the
kind of thing you do so well.

77
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,834
- I do well?
- Yes!

78
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:24,618
Are you nuts? This is your forte.

79
00:03:24,636 --> 00:03:26,838
- No no no no no.
- Yes yes yes.

80
00:03:26,889 --> 00:03:29,390
You're smart and eloquent,
that's what you are.

81
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:32,844
This is not a call for eloquence.
This is a call for charm,

82
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:34,846
for, you know, lightness

83
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:36,681
and breeziness. That's you.

84
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:39,183
You're really the boss.
You're the star of the show.

85
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:41,302
She'd really respect it coming from you.

86
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,155
I'm white glove. White gloves, larry.

87
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:45,907
I don't do those things.

88
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,493
When we did the show, you were
the one who did this stuff.

89
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,946
Remember the cook? How you told her
she was using too much mayonnaise?

90
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,614
- You did that!
- I know.

91
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:55,983
And she came back the
next day duly chastened,

92
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,785
fixed the tuna, fixed the egg salad.

93
00:03:57,819 --> 00:03:59,670
I know, but mayonnaise is not personal.

94
00:03:59,705 --> 00:04:03,841
The mayonnaise is as personal to the
chef as her flabby stomach is to her.

95
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:06,677
So how are we gonna decide
who's... I'm not doing it.

96
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:08,796
We'll choose.

97
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,298
- Odds even.
- One takes.

98
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:11,883
- One takes.
- What do you got?

99
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:13,384
- Odds.
- You got odds?

100
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:14,602
- I got evens.
- Okay.

101
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:16,554
- One two three...
- Shoot!

102
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,306
I win. Do it.

103
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:22,977
Okay, thank you. Bye.

104
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,518
- Hey, larry.
- Hey.

105
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,520
- What's going on?
- Not too much.

106
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,289
- Yeah?
- Jerry and I were just talking.

107
00:04:35,324 --> 00:04:37,291
Mm-hmm.

108
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:39,160
And...

109
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:42,696
We kind of have a little
bit of a problem...

110
00:04:42,714 --> 00:04:44,799
Oh no.

111
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,467
...with the, uh...

112
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:48,336
The bare midriff.

113
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:52,006
What... With my shirt?

114
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,375
This is all exposed and the stomach...

115
00:04:54,393 --> 00:04:56,978
If it's not too much trouble...

116
00:04:57,012 --> 00:05:00,181
- Uh-huh. - ... Maybe you could
start wearing longer shirts?

117
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,934
- What do you think?
- Okay.

118
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:04,819
- I see, okay.
- What?

119
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:06,988
- It's because I'm a woman. I understand.
- No!

120
00:05:07,022 --> 00:05:09,390
- I didn't think you
were like that, larry,

121
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,826
- but I guess you are.
- I'm not like that! No, I'm not.

122
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:15,729
Because if a man was wearing this, you
wouldn't go out and say anything to him.

123
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,332
Even if it was a man, I
wouldn't want to see that.

124
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:21,669
"that"? What is "that," larry?

125
00:05:21,703 --> 00:05:23,737
Well, that. You know.

126
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,424
- Why do you keep doing this?
- Do i?

127
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,759
- Yes.
- Oh.

128
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:31,629
- Um, I don't know.
- What is the problem, larry?

129
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,348
- Are you offended by my body?
- Not at all, not at all!

130
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:37,385
But it's not really appropriate
attire for an office.

131
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:39,587
Okay, so you want me
to wear, like, a burka?

132
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:43,224
Not a burka, but something
in-between this and a burka.

133
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:45,893
Do you know that I have
lost 68 lbs in two years?

134
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:47,979
- That is fantastic.
- Thank you.

135
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,149
- I'm so happy for you.
- I'm very proud of it and I want to flaunt what I've got.

136
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,903
You can flaunt 2/3 of the
day outside of the office.

137
00:05:55,937 --> 00:05:59,207
And then you got 1/3 non-flaunt.
Do you have to flaunt 24 hours?

138
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,992
Why not take a break in the flaunt?

139
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:02,910
Why would I need to take
a break in the flaunt?

140
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,129
There's something about
being a little mysterious...

141
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:07,331
"oooh, what's under that?

142
00:06:07,382 --> 00:06:10,218
Hey, look at that woman.
What has she got under there?

143
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:12,470
- What's going on with that one?"
- you know what, larry?

144
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:14,455
I don't need this,
okay? I quit. I'm sorry.

145
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,674
- You're gonna quit?
- Yeah, I can't do it, larry.

146
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,477
- I'm not gonna do this stuff for you anymore.
- No, I understand.

147
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:21,646
- I completely understand.
- I'm not going on vitamin runs.

148
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,565
- I'm not gonna go buy your socks for you anymore.
- Yeah, I'll buy my own socks.

149
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,317
That's fucking ridiculous.
I'm out of here.

150
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:28,436
- Seriously?
- Yes, I'm gone, larry!

151
00:06:32,157 --> 00:06:33,741
Done!

152
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,812
I cannot believe she's gone.

153
00:06:37,846 --> 00:06:39,980
I thought maybe she would
change what she wore.

154
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:42,116
But I never thought we could
be done with her completely.

155
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,751
But isn't that really
why you sent me in?

156
00:06:43,785 --> 00:06:46,370
I mean, were you thinking of it
somewhere in the back of your mind?

157
00:06:46,421 --> 00:06:48,822
- I was hoping, yeah. I was thinking...
- That I would mishandle that

158
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,626
- and it would lead to something terrible?
- I thought, "this bulvan

159
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,845
will walk in there and in two minutes

160
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,633
she'll be out in a huff."
That's what I thought.

161
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:02,770
Hey, come on, man!

162
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,722
- Just pulling out like that!
- Idiot!

163
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:06,107
What's he doing?

164
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:08,609
You got something you want
to say to me, cuntface?

165
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,394
- Huh?
- Hey, look, I'm sorry.

166
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:12,346
I didn't see you pull out. I'm sorry.

167
00:07:12,364 --> 00:07:15,066
Learn to fucking drive, you fuck!

168
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:23,157
- Honking's very dangerous.
- Yeah.

169
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:26,377
I try never to honk.
Only in dire emergencies.

170
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:28,996
So you just wait if someone's in
front of you, the light has turned...

171
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,499
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Nothing? You just sit behind them and wait?

172
00:07:31,533 --> 00:07:34,018
- Can you do a little... Huh?
- The gentle honk?

173
00:07:34,052 --> 00:07:35,202
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

174
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,388
- The throat clear.
- The most I could do

175
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:39,473
- is a gentle honk.
- Exactly.

176
00:07:39,508 --> 00:07:42,393
- "Hello, excuse me."
- Do you have that technique?

177
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:44,345
- I do a great excuse me.
- It's a language.

178
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:45,896
- It's a lang... Absolutely.
- Yeah.

179
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:49,233
- By the way.
- What?

180
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:51,485
How many napkins does a person need

181
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,154
to get through a sandwich?

182
00:07:53,188 --> 00:07:55,156
I don't know. I use a lot of napkins.

183
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,992
- Always. Every meal.
- You should bring a bath towel to eat.

184
00:07:58,026 --> 00:07:59,910
- That's what you should bring.

185
00:07:59,945 --> 00:08:01,629
- Hey, guys, I'm so...
- Hey!

186
00:08:01,663 --> 00:08:03,664
- Hey hey, man, good to see you.
- How are you?

187
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,117
- Long time. Good to see you.
- What do you like to do?

188
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:08,419
- I don't know what you do.
- Plea... Yeah.

189
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,705
We... We ordered. We couldn't wait.

190
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:13,374
I can see. But I'm... Can
i... I want to eat something.

191
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,092
I'm famished, so...

192
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,795
You know, can I... I'm starved.

193
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:19,263
- Move over.
- I'm starved.

194
00:08:20,549 --> 00:08:23,050
- You should... You know.
- What? No, you.

195
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,753
What's going on? Can I sit down?

196
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,471
Come on, scootch over.

197
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:30,725
How many years you guys... You
know this guy? You're close friends.

198
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,728
Right, I know him longer
so he should sit over there,

199
00:08:33,762 --> 00:08:36,263
because I'm actually gonna be
talking to him more than you

200
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,915
so I should have eye contact with him

201
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:40,251
as opposed to turning
around and straining my neck.

202
00:08:40,285 --> 00:08:42,436
You know, I'm a lefty. I can't...

203
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,739
It'll be to your right.
It works to your advantage.

204
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:48,492
Look, the only reason you want me
to slide over is because you want

205
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:51,212
- the luxury suite.
- Of course I want the luxury suite.

206
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,214
- You want the luxury suite too.
- Yes, I do.

207
00:08:53,248 --> 00:08:55,633
You're right, you're
right, I do. But you...

208
00:08:57,452 --> 00:08:59,086
- Hey, where'd he go?
- Oh my god.

209
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,139
- What the hell?
- I'm fucking angry at you.

210
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:14,301
Hi, guys. hi!

211
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,003
- Hi.
- I was just on the lot.

212
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:18,272
- I thought I'd come by and say hi.
- Hi, cheryl.

213
00:09:18,306 --> 00:09:20,574
Jerry, I wanted to thank you so much.

214
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:22,476
- Oh.
- This is gonna be so great.

215
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,612
Thank you for giving me the part

216
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,013
in the "seinfeld" reunion.

217
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:29,250
- The...?
- The part on the reunion show?

218
00:09:29,284 --> 00:09:31,519
- You know.
- Oh.

219
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:34,355
- So...
- I am so excited about it

220
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:37,191
- and I wanted to thank you personally.
- Oh, well,

221
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:39,660
i'm... I... I can't believe it.

222
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:43,664
- I can't either!
- Why don't... I'll go meet you upstairs.

223
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,766
- Okay.
- All right.

224
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,935
I'll see you upstairs. Go...

225
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,603
Why don't you go up?

226
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:51,038
All right.

227
00:09:51,073 --> 00:09:53,174
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

228
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,228
- I got an odd, um...
- No.

229
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:58,496
...vibe from him. no?

230
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,314
no. You know, the only thing is

231
00:10:00,348 --> 00:10:02,182
you prob... Um...

232
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,235
You're kinda gonna have to...

233
00:10:04,286 --> 00:10:07,271
- Audition, yeah.
- I have to audition for this part?

234
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:09,273
- I thought you said I had it.
- No, you do have it.

235
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:11,442
- You do have it, you know.
- That's why...

236
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,577
It's like winning an election
but waiting to get sworn in.

237
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:16,313
So the audition is the
swearing in. It's nothing.

238
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:18,349
- It's a formality.
- Formality, yeah.

239
00:10:18,383 --> 00:10:20,634
- But I have the part?
- You just show up and read it,

240
00:10:20,669 --> 00:10:22,870
- and just... You know, he needs to see that...
- Read it?

241
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,639
...he needs to see that you can
read and write, you know, whatever.

242
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:27,174
- All right, well...
- All right, so...

243
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:29,677
I'll see you, uh...
You'll call me and tell me.

244
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:31,812
- Okay.
- Right? When to come in and...

245
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,280
- Yeah.
- ... For the formality.

246
00:10:33,315 --> 00:10:35,349
- You look good.
- Thank you.

247
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:38,235
I can't believe that you
would have the audacity

248
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,355
to even... To even broach the subject,

249
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,908
- to have the gut... Okay.
- Well, first of all, I didn't do it.

250
00:10:43,942 --> 00:10:46,744
Excuse me, he did it. Listen,

251
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:48,863
what is this with
maureen? What... What...

252
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:51,115
I tried to be very sensitive.

253
00:10:51,166 --> 00:10:52,750
I... I did, but she stormed out.

254
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:55,669
You can't go up to a woman

255
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:58,172
and tell her that her
shirt is inappropriate

256
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:02,259
or distracting to you or whatever
the hell you said. It is sexist!

257
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,245
- It's completely sexist.
- We would have said that to a man

258
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,764
if... If there was man flab.

259
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:09,099
- Yeah.
- A man wouldn't even dress like that.

260
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,435
Women dress like that.
That's the look for the...

261
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,771
- ... Young girls.
- Yeah, for your swinging,

262
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:16,390
sexy l.a. Scene that you live in.

263
00:11:16,424 --> 00:11:18,526
- We don't live in that world.
- What are you talking about?

264
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,528
He lives in los angeles.
Who do you think you are?

265
00:11:20,562 --> 00:11:22,947
He lives in his own mind. He
doesn't know anything about it.

266
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:25,783
The point is this... There's lots
of men that we talked about hiring

267
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:28,235
- that we wouldn't hire for various reasons...
- Absolutely!

268
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:30,821
Yeah, what about the guy we
didn't like because he was veiny?

269
00:11:30,872 --> 00:11:33,040
- Yeah, there was the veiny guy.
- Yeah.

270
00:11:33,074 --> 00:11:35,626
That first a.d. From "evening
shade" had foamy mouth.

271
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,779
- We didn't hire him.
- He was bubbly. I can't work with somebody who's bubbly.

272
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:42,282
Guys, I think you've
forgotten that maureen's mother

273
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,585
was our nanny for years and years

274
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:46,504
and she helped me with the girls.

275
00:11:46,555 --> 00:11:50,140
Okay, she is very mentally unstable

276
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:53,894
and right now she's going through
a very rough time. All right?

277
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:56,263
Her daughter getting fired

278
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:58,432
or quitting or whatever
it is that happened,

279
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:02,152
it's gonna make her... She
could be, like, suicidal.

280
00:12:02,187 --> 00:12:05,239
- She's suicidal?
- You've got to get maureen back here to work.

281
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:08,642
- Okay? You've got to do it.
- You really should... You should take care of this, larry.

282
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,861
You should. You need to
drive over there right now.

283
00:12:10,912 --> 00:12:12,980
- That's what you have to do. That's right.
- Yeah.

284
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,868
Man.

285
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,089
- So jerry and I
talked, and... - Mm-hmm.

286
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:24,124
...we want you to come back.

287
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,010
Want you back.

288
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:28,345
You want me to come back?

289
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,297
Yeah.

290
00:12:30,331 --> 00:12:34,385
Well, the whole reason was because
you weren't okay with this shirt.

291
00:12:34,436 --> 00:12:36,937
Honestly, I don't even know
what I was thinking about.

292
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,223
I'm fine with the shirt. I'm
fine with the whole thing.

293
00:12:39,274 --> 00:12:41,308
- The whole... The whole...
- What do you mean the whole thing?

294
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,360
- All the whole...
- What is this whole thing? What is this?

295
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,563
You know, whatever's happening
there, I'm fine with it.

296
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:46,897
My stomach? What does that mean?

297
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:49,066
You know, the protuberance
and the whole... All of it.

298
00:12:49,117 --> 00:12:51,785
- So we're good?
- I mean...

299
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,154
It's a simple thing, larry.

300
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:56,189
- Perfect world?
- Okay.

301
00:12:56,207 --> 00:13:00,077
Maybe an inch further down,
cover up the belly button.

302
00:13:00,128 --> 00:13:02,212
That's all. Perfect
world, perfect world!

303
00:13:02,247 --> 00:13:05,132
I'd cover that little thing
there, the little belly button.

304
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:09,003
An inch lower. You know, but
belly button or no belly button,

305
00:13:09,037 --> 00:13:10,537
we want you to come back.

306
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:12,973
- Okay.
- Good.

307
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,309
I'm glad we talked, larry.

308
00:13:15,343 --> 00:13:17,377
- Oh, honey.
- Hi, mom.

309
00:13:17,395 --> 00:13:20,314
Hi, honey. The traffic was unbelievable.

310
00:13:20,348 --> 00:13:22,182
Oh no.

311
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:26,770
- Mom, are you okay?
- Oh my god.

312
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,523
This is my boss. This is larry.

313
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:32,026
No, this is not larry. This... You...

314
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,194
You are the spitting image

315
00:13:34,228 --> 00:13:36,447
of my deceased husband tom.

316
00:13:36,498 --> 00:13:38,532
Oh my god.

317
00:13:38,566 --> 00:13:41,285
Oh, I'm having a hot flash. Oh ho ho.

318
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,537
Seriously? I really look like this guy?

319
00:13:43,571 --> 00:13:46,790
- Ohhh.
- You look exactly like him.

320
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:48,842
Wh... What... Wh...
What happened to him?

321
00:13:48,877 --> 00:13:52,680
Oh, it happened so fast. You
know, he was murdered, and...

322
00:13:52,714 --> 00:13:54,181
- We got married...
- Murdered?!

323
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:57,301
Yes! It was 1962.

324
00:13:57,352 --> 00:14:02,389
It was our wedding day. We were driving
down to mexico for our honeymoon...

325
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:08,896
¶ don't s nothing bad about my baby ¶

326
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,616

00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,224

329
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:22,092

- ¶ he's good! ¶

330
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:24,094
- ¶ he's good to me ¶
- ¶ he's so good to me ¶

331
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:27,247
- ¶ that's all I care about ¶
- ¶ I don't care about nothing else! ¶

332
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:30,384
that's all I care about.

333
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:32,336
Ohhh.

334
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:35,005
- Happy, baby?
- I'm so happy.

335
00:14:35,056 --> 00:14:37,691
You ever think you'd get a guy like me?

336
00:14:37,726 --> 00:14:40,344
No. I don't think my mom did either.

337
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:44,648
Yeah. Are you looking forwar?

338
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:48,268
Well, I have to admit

339
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:50,738
that I have been fantasizing a little.

340
00:14:50,772 --> 00:14:53,323
- I have a confession to make.
- Yeah?

341
00:14:53,358 --> 00:14:55,192
I don't think I know what I'm doing.

342
00:14:57,395 --> 00:14:59,430
Hey!

343
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:01,415
- What the hell?
- Just let him go.

344
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,450
- What are you doing?
- Just let him go.

345
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:04,702
- Hey, same to you!
- No no.

346
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,319
- Uh-huh, yeah!
- Please don't.

347
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:07,738
- Please don't.
- Jesus, huh?

348
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:11,008
- Do not ruin our perfect day.
- What a schmohawk.

349
00:15:11,042 --> 00:15:13,493
- You bastard! Go ahead, pull over.
- Just keep going.

350
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:15,546
You don't pull over. Just keep driving.

351
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,715
- Please, don't get in a fight.
- Okay okay.

352
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:19,900
- Don't worry about it.
- Please, just... Tom!

353
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:22,836
- What are you doing out here?
- Wait here.

354
00:15:33,548 --> 00:15:35,566
Wait, he's behind you!

355
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:37,351
No no no!

356
00:15:37,385 --> 00:15:39,403
- Oh!
- Fucking moron!

357
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:41,071
Learn how to fucking drive!

358
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:44,491
Learn how to speed the hell up!

359
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:47,111
¶ bad about my baby, oh no ¶

360
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:50,330
¶ don't say nothing bad about my baby. ¶

361
00:15:50,364 --> 00:15:53,700
and all he did was honk!

362
00:15:53,718 --> 00:15:56,003
He honked!

363
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,138
- That's unbelievable.
- It is.

364
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:01,374
- You can't honk anymore! You cannot honk.
- Oh, no no.

365
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:03,343
I'll tell you what else you
can't do... You can't shush.

366
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:05,062
No honking, no shushing.

367
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,897
That sound... Shh-shh, you know.

368
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:09,049
- It is offensive. It's startling.
- It's awful.

369
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,901
But people don't kill you for shushing.

370
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:12,936
- They kill you for honking.
- That part's true.

371
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,322
Let me help you with the groceries.
Let me get these out of your way.

372
00:16:15,356 --> 00:16:18,192
Thank you, dear. I'm gonna
show you a picture of tom.

373
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:21,578
Because you're not going
to believe. It's uncanny.

374
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:25,565
Come on, hmm?

375
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,035
- You see it, don't you?
- I'm sorry to say.

376
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:31,071
- What?
- He doesn't look anything like me.

377
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,007
- Honestly.
- Look, the... The...

378
00:16:34,042 --> 00:16:36,176
The hair, the glasses, everything.

379
00:16:36,211 --> 00:16:40,413
- It's the same. Confirm it.
- All bald people do not look alike.

380
00:16:40,431 --> 00:16:42,516
I don't see how you cannot see that.

381
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,803
- May I use your bathroom?
- Yeah, second door on the right.

382
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:48,138
Okay.

383
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:15,799
oh.

384
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:46,280
- I'm just gonna take off.
- Oh, hey, larry.

385
00:17:46,314 --> 00:17:48,315
- Hey.
- Hey, I'm glad we had that talk.

386
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,616
- Yes!
- I feel much better.

387
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,484
- Oh, me too, me too.
- Thanks for coming over.

388
00:17:51,502 --> 00:17:53,820
- So nice meeting you.
- You should talk to her.

389
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:56,123
You know, about the bare midriff

390
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:58,125
and the belly button.

391
00:18:06,684 --> 00:18:09,253
- Hello?
- Larry, it's the invisible jew.

392
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,622
- Richard lewis, remember me?
- Oh, hey!

393
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:14,358
- Yeah.
- I cannot believe

394
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:16,593
I get invited to lunch
with you and jerry.

395
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,862
I'm standing there like
a putz. You don't even...

396
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,664
You don't even make believe I'm there.

397
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:22,900
What am i, marley's ghost?

398
00:18:22,934 --> 00:18:25,118
I am so sorry. You're so right.

399
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:27,237
I was completely in the wrong there

400
00:18:27,288 --> 00:18:29,039
and I truly apologize.

401
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:32,025
I'll tell you why I
felt even doubly shitty,

402
00:18:32,043 --> 00:18:34,711
because I went to a
memorabilia show the other day

403
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,246
and I bought you a present.

404
00:18:36,297 --> 00:18:38,165
Guess what... A joe dimaggio bat

405
00:18:38,199 --> 00:18:40,968
that he signed that he
used in a world series game.

406
00:18:41,002 --> 00:18:42,970
- Oh my god, that's so sweet.
- That's right.

407
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:45,839
- And I was gonna give it to you.
- Oh, that's so sweet of you.

408
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,724
Thank you! You know what? Keep it on you

409
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,542
and you'll give it to
me next time I see you.

410
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,229
- And next time I'll slide down.
- All right.

411
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,713
Fair enough. All right.

412
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:56,934
- Fine. All right.
- All right.

413
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:01,555
Hello?

414
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:03,156
Where...

415
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:04,925
Larry!

416
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:11,782
Ehh.

417
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,692
Mom!

418
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:24,011
You've got to see this.
Come here, come here!

419
00:19:24,045 --> 00:19:26,129
- Oh oh!
- Oh my god.

420
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,881
- What?
- Look at jesus!

421
00:19:27,915 --> 00:19:30,550
I know!

422
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:50,871
All right, what page are we on?

423
00:19:50,905 --> 00:19:52,956
12. Let me ask you something.

424
00:19:52,991 --> 00:19:56,159
- When you get drop-off
calls with a guy... - mm-hmm?

425
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,545
...you don't call back for
an official goodbye, do you?

426
00:19:58,579 --> 00:19:59,629
- No.
- Huh?

427
00:19:59,664 --> 00:20:01,614
I mean, you have your wife rules

428
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:04,334
and you have your friend rules.

429
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:07,254
- Yes.
- For the wife, you're always...

430
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:10,474
You must be careful not
to disturb the exotic bird.

431
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,509
- Right.
- But what kinda guy?

432
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,344
- I mean, a regular guy?
- Lewis.

433
00:20:14,395 --> 00:20:16,229
oh. Well, that's different.

434
00:20:16,264 --> 00:20:18,131
Yeah.

435
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:20,517
Were you in the wind-down
phase of the call?

436
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:23,820
- Total wind-down, yeah. - did
anybody say "so" and "all right"?

437
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,472
Yeah, I mean, there was an "all right."

438
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,357
In that register? That "all right!"

439
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:30,861
- yeah, I think there was.
- That one? Okay, well, that's half a goodbye.

440
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:33,146
- Right, it's over.
- You don't need the goodbye.

441
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:35,032
- Yeah.
- Hey, guys,

442
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,918
- can I talk to you for a second?
- Oh, sure, maureen.

443
00:20:37,952 --> 00:20:39,786
Um...

444
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,371
Oh, gosh, uh...

445
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:44,424
- Are you all right?
- I'm actually the best I've ever been

446
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,460
- in my life.
- Oh, wow.

447
00:20:46,494 --> 00:20:48,462
Um, do I look different to you?

448
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:51,631
No, I'm seeing everything I usually see.

449
00:20:51,665 --> 00:20:52,716
- Really?
- Yeah.

450
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:55,001
'cause my whole life has changed.

451
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:57,637
Yesterday... It was actually
right after you left,

452
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:00,557
a miracle happened.

453
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:05,028
I went into the bathroom
and I called my mother in

454
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,448
because there is a painting
hanging up of jesus.

455
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:10,200
It's beautiful.

456
00:21:10,234 --> 00:21:12,519
And he's got a tear

457
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,188
coming down on his face.

458
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:17,040
- Really?
- A real tear

459
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,826
that was never there before.

460
00:21:21,212 --> 00:21:22,913
- Wow.
- Can you believe that?

461
00:21:22,964 --> 00:21:25,532
- That's odd.
- It's a miracle!

462
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,169
- He chose us.
- Are you sure it wasn't...

463
00:21:29,203 --> 00:21:31,838
You know, water?

464
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:33,473
No no, it was at eye level.

465
00:21:33,508 --> 00:21:35,592
It was... There's no way
water could get up there.

466
00:21:35,643 --> 00:21:38,512
Have you ever witnessed
a miracle like that?

467
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:40,897
- No.
- I mean, can you think of one like that?

468
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:43,650
I think every erection is a miracle.

469
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:46,987
Anyway, I'm sad to tell
you guys this, but I...

470
00:21:47,021 --> 00:21:48,605
I have to quit.

471
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:49,856
- What?
- Ohh!

472
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,409
- I'm sorry, you guys.
- Oooh.

473
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,995
It's just my mother and
I decided after seeing it

474
00:21:55,029 --> 00:21:57,030
we can't just keep it
to ourselves, you know?

475
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,666
We're going to go and buy
an r.v. And tour the country

476
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,069
and show the whole country our miracle.

477
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:04,588
- It's amazing.
- That's wonderful.

478
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:06,206
And we can't just keep it to ourselves.

479
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,074
- We have to share it.
- You have to.

480
00:22:08,092 --> 00:22:10,743
Trust your gut, you know.

481
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:12,929
Thank you so much.

482
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,015
Um, I have to ask you a favor though.

483
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,385
- The r.v. That we want to use...
- Yeah?

484
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:23,356
- ... We need a cosigner. I would normally never...
- You got it!

485
00:22:23,391 --> 00:22:24,858
Don't even think about it.

486
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:26,593
- That's nothing.
- You'll do it?!

487
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,478
- Of course.
- That is larry david.

488
00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:30,697
- Tell her who I am.
- Larry "how can I help" david.

489
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:32,899
- Yes.
- It would have to be done by 3:00 tomorrow.

490
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,035
- Yes yes! I'll sign anything.
- Really?

491
00:22:35,069 --> 00:22:37,287
- Anything you want, yeah.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

492
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:38,705
- Yes!
- Thank you.

493
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:41,458
- Thank you. Thank you for all the...
- Wonderful.

494
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:43,577
...the good work.

495
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,081
You splashed him, didn't you?

496
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,134
I splashed him.

497
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:56,506
No no, don't worry, maureen.

498
00:22:56,557 --> 00:22:58,258
I'm just getting something to eat.

499
00:22:58,292 --> 00:23:00,393
I'll be at the bank at 3:00 to cosign.

500
00:23:00,428 --> 00:23:02,662
Yes, I will.

501
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:05,932
All right, i'll see you at 3:00.

502
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:09,035
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:23:17,311 --> 00:23:20,697
Hey you! Put the napkins back.

504
00:23:20,748 --> 00:23:23,333
- What?
- Only two. I put two in the bag. That's plenty.

505
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:25,752
Two, are you kidding? I got
a chicken parmesan sub here.

506
00:23:25,786 --> 00:23:28,488
I had a handicapped kid in here
yesterday... Know how many napkins he got?

507
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,925
- Two!
- What, do they eat differently than the rest of us?

508
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:33,460
That's the point. Two.

509
00:23:33,494 --> 00:23:35,345
- What's the point?
- Two napkins.

510
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:38,148
- I don't get the handicapped reference.
- Put the napkins back.

511
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:41,968
- What's the handicapped reference?
- Put the napkins back.

512
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:49,809
- Fine. Here.
- Thank you very much.

513
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:50,911
- Okay.
- Okay?

514
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:52,445
All right. Thank you very much.

515
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,114
- Thank you for your business.
- Okay.

516
00:24:05,326 --> 00:24:08,712
Oh god.

517
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:11,498
Damn it.

518
00:24:17,672 --> 00:24:19,339
Good afternoon, sir.

519
00:24:19,373 --> 00:24:21,424
License and registration, please.

520
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,893
Would you mind telling
me what I did, officer?

521
00:24:23,928 --> 00:24:27,147
Huh? I think I was
going the speed limit.

522
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,152
Where'd you... Where'd
you buy that sandwich?

523
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:35,021
Enzo's.

524
00:24:35,055 --> 00:24:37,457
- He give you any napkins with that?
- Yeah yeah.

525
00:24:37,491 --> 00:24:39,526
Yeah? How many napkins they give you?

526
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,361
Two, they give you two napkins.

527
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:44,064
What's in the bag?

528
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:49,068
Some plastic forks, knives,

529
00:24:49,086 --> 00:24:50,903
spoons.

530
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:53,707
Let me see the bag, please.

531
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,140
- I need them!
- Step out of the car, please.

532
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,775
Oh, come on! Are you serious?

533
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:15,145
What did I do? I took some
napkins. I got sauce on my face.

534
00:25:15,196 --> 00:25:17,614
- I need napkins to clean the sauce.
- Step back of the car, please.

535
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:20,066
- Come on, this is crazy!
- Face the car, please.

536
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,369
- We're talking about napkins!
- Put your hands on the car.

537
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:26,206
So you're sure it's not
one of the other guys?

538
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,158
- Just those two?
- No no, I remember the glasses

539
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:30,460
and the bald head. Bald
with glasses for sure.

540
00:25:30,494 --> 00:25:31,628
All right.

541
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:34,130
Four and six, step forward please.

542
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,416
The rest of you step out to the right.

543
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:43,556
Okay, what do you think?

544
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:51,514
- I just can't tell.
- Don't know which one it is?

545
00:25:51,565 --> 00:25:55,268
I'm confused. I just see bald.

546
00:25:56,604 --> 00:25:57,971
I... I don't know.

547
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:00,774
All right, you're free
to go... Both of you.

548
00:26:04,545 --> 00:26:07,847
Hey, thanks so much for picking
me up at the police station.

549
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,667
I can't believe you missed the signing.

550
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:13,553
I mean, it's over something
so stupid as napkins.

551
00:26:13,587 --> 00:26:16,823
I mean, why do you have
to use so many napkins?

552
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,342
I don't know. I like a lot of napkins.

553
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,178
Hey, thanks for letting me
drive the car, by the way.

554
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:25,115
- It feels good, huh?
- Oh my god, I can't believe you kept it all these years.

555
00:26:25,149 --> 00:26:26,916
- Oh yeah.
- I'll give you $200 for it.

556
00:26:26,951 --> 00:26:28,385
- Oh.
- What do you say?

557
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:30,553
- No no, I couldn't part with it.
- Hey!

558
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,642
- Don't honk, don't honk!
- Quiet.

559
00:26:35,676 --> 00:26:37,510
- My gosh.
- Yeah, pull over!

560
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,331
Don't stop. Oh, please, don't stop.

561
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:43,366
- I'll be right back.
- No no, don't get out of the car!

562
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:45,151
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Don't get out!

563
00:26:47,121 --> 00:26:48,855
- Hey.
- You have a lot of nerve!

564
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,924
- I do?
- You have a lot of fucking nerve.

565
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:54,210
- Why, what did I do?
- What, are you banging some kind of mormon beautician?

566
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:56,045
- Get out of here.
- Who the fuck is that?

567
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,947
- It's a long story.
- Let me tell you something,

568
00:26:57,982 --> 00:27:00,650
when I called you about that
gift, okay, the phones went out.

569
00:27:00,684 --> 00:27:03,920
- You didn't call me back!
- I ended our conversation with all right,

570
00:27:03,954 --> 00:27:06,106
- then the drop off.
- I want an official goodbye.

571
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,524
You can't assume goodbye?

572
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:10,443
Our flashback weekend
continues back to 1963.

573
00:27:10,478 --> 00:27:13,079
It's the cookies, "don't say
nothing bad about my baby. "

574
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,715
¶ don't say nothing
bad about my baby... ¶

575
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:18,384
i'm gonna give you your gift
anyway. You don't deserve it.

576
00:27:18,402 --> 00:27:20,553
- I must just be such a wuss.
- That's very sweet of you.

577
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:22,221
- That's so nice of you.
- It's beyond sweet.

578
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:25,859
This is a joe dimaggio bat, by the way.

579
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:28,528
- ¶ don't say nothing bad about
my baby... ¶ - uh-oh, oh no.

580
00:27:28,562 --> 00:27:31,714
Behind you! The bat, the bat!

581
00:27:34,251 --> 00:27:37,554
- Tom!
- Ohhh!

582
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:41,341
¶ don't say nothing
bad about my baby... ¶

583
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:49,466
- so lewis is gonna be okay?
- Yeah. Unscathed.

584
00:27:49,517 --> 00:27:51,384
That is a tough guy.

585
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:53,603
But he stayed overnight in the hospital.

586
00:27:53,637 --> 00:27:55,438
I went to... I went to go visit him.

587
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,857
- Oh, that was nice of you.
- Yeah, but he was sleeping

588
00:27:57,892 --> 00:27:59,859
- so I didn't really get to talk to him.
- Oh.

589
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:02,529
I'm thinking that counts as a
visit though, wouldn't you say?

590
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,397
- You were there.
- I visited.

591
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:06,366
- You did your part.
- He can't complain.

592
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,700
- Can't complain, no.
- Right.

593
00:28:07,735 --> 00:28:10,286
- You know what? I gotta go pee, so...
- All right.

594
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,939
Maybe tomorrow we'll dress
up like kaufman and hart...

595
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,741
Put on coats and ties, tweed jackets.

596
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:16,876
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Smoke some cigarettes.

597
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:18,611
Maybe we'll have a good writing day.

598
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:21,631
Yeah, then maybe wrestle naked
like oliver reed and alan bates.

599
00:28:25,302 --> 00:28:27,921
Shit.

600
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:29,889
Hey!

601
00:28:29,924 --> 00:28:31,808
Oh, damn it.

602
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,727
Fuck.

603
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:44,153
- I'll come in and help you with your stuff.
- Thanks, mom.

604
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,582
Do you hear that?

605
00:28:55,616 --> 00:28:57,450
Yeah, what is that?

606
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:05,008
I think it's coming over here.

607
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,677
- You hear it, right?
- Yes!

608
00:29:07,711 --> 00:29:10,513
- Wow, what the heck is that?
- It's over here.

609
00:29:11,932 --> 00:29:14,634
- Oh my god.
- Oh, honey, what is... What was that?

610
00:29:14,668 --> 00:29:16,553
- What are you doing?
- Larry?

611
00:29:16,604 --> 00:29:18,838
The... The... The door was locked. I
- I...

612
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:21,691
How did that even get
up here? How did that...

613
00:29:21,725 --> 00:29:24,176
- What is it?
- Oh my god.

614
00:29:24,194 --> 00:29:27,196
- What?
- That's how jesus...

615
00:29:27,231 --> 00:29:29,399
- That's how...
- Oh no.

616
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,451
- No!
- Oh no, you didn't.

617
00:29:31,485 --> 00:29:33,486
You did not do that, larry!

618
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,573
- It's horrible.
- You know, it just goes up in the...

619
00:29:36,624 --> 00:29:38,825
Larry, you sprayed on jesus!

620
00:29:38,859 --> 00:29:41,077
- What can I do?
- I can't believe it.

621
00:29:41,128 --> 00:29:43,913
I'm taking this medication and
it's getting all over the place!

622
00:29:43,964 --> 00:29:45,298
I can't control it!

623
00:29:45,332 --> 00:29:47,383
The church groups, the tour...

624
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,703
There was no miracle?

625
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:53,205
- Sorry.
- Mom...

626
00:29:53,223 --> 00:29:54,891
Mom?

627
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:57,543
Where did she go?

628
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,378
- She went that way.
- Where did she go?!

629
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:02,098
Larry! Mom?

630
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:04,884
- What the hell happened to her?
- Like, how far could she have gone?

631
00:30:04,902 --> 00:30:06,102
I don't know. I don't get it.

632
00:30:06,153 --> 00:30:07,854
- Mom!
- Mrs. Cochran!

633
00:30:07,888 --> 00:30:10,189
Mom? Larry.

634
00:30:10,223 --> 00:30:12,492
Larry! Oh my gosh.

635
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:16,863
- Oh, christ.
- Let's go... Go get her.

636
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:33,796
Oh no! Please...

637
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:40,720
Larry.

638
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:43,189
Oh, larry!

639
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:45,391
Hang on, larry. Hang on!

640
00:30:45,425 --> 00:30:47,610
Larry.

641
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:51,981
- Hold on.
- Ahhhh.

642
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
