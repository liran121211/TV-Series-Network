1
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:09,536
- Nat: I think down there.
- Really?

2
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:11,505
I don't know. I don't remember.
I haven't been here in years.

3
00:00:11,573 --> 00:00:13,607
- This is it right here.
- Larry: this is it?

4
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:16,476
- Yeah, here.
- Larry: this is mom's grave?

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,980
Larry:
"past away"?

6
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:21,448
P- a-s-t?

7
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:23,717
Dad, you spelled
"passed" wrong.

8
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:25,485
It's not spelled
p- a-s-t.

9
00:00:25,553 --> 00:00:28,222
"passed away."
P-A-S-S-E-D.

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,123
I know how
to spell it.

11
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:31,942
That's $50
a letter.

12
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:34,077
You spelled it wrong
on purpose to save $100?!

13
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:35,412
Yes, why not?

14
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,148
It has the same meaning.
Everybody knows what it means.

15
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:41,051
- It's not the same meaning.
- You saved $100?!

16
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:42,920
I would've paid for it.

17
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:44,855
- I-i...
- Are you kidding?

18
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:47,824
I didn't ask you because I
didn't want to bother you.

19
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:49,860
That was the whole idea.

20
00:00:49,928 --> 00:00:51,929
Honestly, this is
not the nicest way...

21
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:53,463
- This is insane.
- ... To honor your wife.

22
00:00:53,531 --> 00:00:56,300
Okay, I'm sorry.
I gotta change this.

23
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,018
You got the name
of the stonemason?

24
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:00,470
Yes, I have the name
of the stonemason, yes.

25
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:03,373
I'm gonna spell it
the right way.

26
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:05,943
And what about some
blandishments on here?

27
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,246
How about "devoted wife"?
Some adjectives?

28
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:11,248
"beloved mother of larry"
would've been nice.

29
00:01:11,316 --> 00:01:14,885
You wanted maybe $6,000
more on the stone?

30
00:01:14,953 --> 00:01:18,588
Why not just "adele david
born, passed away"?

31
00:01:32,203 --> 00:01:34,771
How long do we have
to stay here?

32
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:41,761
- P-A-S-T past.
- "Past away."

33
00:01:41,813 --> 00:01:45,265
- I don't believe it.
- God only knows what that man has let go through.

34
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:47,117
Lucky he didn't put
"beloved moth."

35
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:52,306
Hey hey hey. Norm's here.
We've got to hurry up.

36
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:53,957
Let's eat.
Let's order.

37
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:57,894
Marty:
he's the slowest golfe in t.

38
00:01:57,962 --> 00:02:00,314
Let's order breakfast
and beat him to the first tee.

39
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,049
- Yeah, come on.
- What are we having?

40
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:04,918
I'm gonna have egg whites
with a bagel. Quickly, please.

41
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:07,337
- I'll have sunny-side eggs.
- Just a fruit plate.

42
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:11,475
I'd like the same thing... Egg
whites with lox and well-done onions.

43
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:13,410
I don't want them limp.
I really want them crispy.

44
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:15,295
Andy, andy,
do me a favor.

45
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,681
- You don't need to get crispy onions.
- No, this is what I want.

46
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:20,734
No no, it takes a long time
to get onions well-done.

47
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:23,020
Believe me. I've ordered this
before. I know exactly what I want.

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,522
- I know, but they take a long time.
- Thank you.

49
00:02:25,606 --> 00:02:27,441
- Thank you very much.
- It takes a long time.

50
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:29,693
- Stop it. You don't know what you're talking about.
- I do know.

51
00:02:29,777 --> 00:02:31,644
- I make onions at home.
- So I'll only eat half.

52
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:34,197
- Don't worry.
- You have never played behind norm.

53
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:35,582
- Hey, jim.
- What's going on?

54
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,950
- How are you?
- Not bad.

55
00:02:37,018 --> 00:02:38,502
- Just in town for the day.
- Going back to new york?

56
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:39,569
Yeah, taking
a red-eye tonight.

57
00:02:39,637 --> 00:02:41,321
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

58
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:43,573
- Take care.
- Take care.

59
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,926
Why didn't you
introduce us?

60
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:47,594
He's from new york. You're
never gonna see him again.

61
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:49,346
It's a courteous
thing to do.

62
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:50,997
- What, do you have to know his name?
- I don't have to know it.

63
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,832
He has to know your name
and shake your hand?

64
00:02:52,884 --> 00:02:54,885
It's a common courtesy
when you're talkinn t.

65
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:57,270
It's a pointless and
unnecessary social convention...

66
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:04,661
... To introduce every single person you know.

67
00:03:04,662 --> 00:03:07,564
Hello?
Oh, hey, dad.

68
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,866
I can't talk here.
I'm in the dining room.

69
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,351
You shouldn't use
the phone in here.

70
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:13,703
- Home for dinner tonight at 6:30.
- Keep it down.

71
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:15,688
Come on. Tell him you'll call him back.

72
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,074
Great.
I'll see you then.

73
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:21,828
No cell phone in dining room. Club rule.

74
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:22,946
Why you break rule?

75
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:25,365
Oh. I'm sorry,
mr. Takahashi.

76
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:27,918
My father had a quadruple
bypass surgery yesterday

77
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:30,787
and he needed
to hear my voice.

78
00:03:30,855 --> 00:03:33,306
You do this all time.

79
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:35,642
Last warning.

80
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:38,578
Sorry.

81
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:43,383
- Who the hell is he?
- Mr. Takahashi.

82
00:03:43,434 --> 00:03:45,402
- He's the owner.
- Of the club?

83
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:46,853
- Yeah.
- Oh boy.

84
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:59,699
Will you please finish shoveling
that shit into your face?

85
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:01,401
It's exactly
how I wanted it done.

86
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:03,086
I told you those onions
were gonna take 10-15 minutes.

87
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:04,904
A couple of minutes
longer than you guys.

88
00:04:04,956 --> 00:04:06,673
It wasn't a couple of minutes.
We've been done for five.

89
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:08,408
All right.
Let's hit it.

90
00:04:08,476 --> 00:04:11,094
What does it matter now?
What does it matter now?

91
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:13,530
- No, it's over.
- Maybe they're going to the range.

92
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:15,799
No, they're not going to the
range. They don't go to the range.

93
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:18,568
- Thanks, gentlemen.
- Yeah, I got it. Don't worry.

94
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:20,570
- Thanks, larr.
- You're welcome.

95
00:04:20,638 --> 00:04:23,940
You know what they do here?
It's an 18% tip included.

96
00:04:24,025 --> 00:04:26,309
And then they have a space
for an additional tip.

97
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:28,345
I have to start doing ma
in my head now?

98
00:04:28,412 --> 00:04:30,313
And then... What does it
come out to? $2?

99
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,365
I'm leaving an extra $2?
That makes me look cheap.

100
00:04:32,433 --> 00:04:33,733
Just leave the 18%
and let's go.

101
00:04:33,784 --> 00:04:35,402
I think that's
all they expect.

102
00:04:35,453 --> 00:04:38,038
I'm not leaving any more additional
tips here. I'm protesting it.

103
00:04:38,105 --> 00:04:40,040
I swear to you
i'm gonna protest it.

104
00:04:40,107 --> 00:04:41,875
- I don't think it's right.
- Jeff: I'm gonna follow your lead.

105
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:43,627
- Marty: it's a good protest.
- This is crazy.

106
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:46,163
You ready? - yeah, we'.

107
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,581
Let's go, let's go.
Come on.

108
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:52,018
- Thanks again, guys.
- Okay, thank you.

109
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,019
Have a good round.

110
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:57,924
Whoa. Was... Was
everything all right?

111
00:04:57,975 --> 00:04:59,926
- Yeah, good job.
- Thanks.

112
00:04:59,977 --> 00:05:01,895
Um, see, 'cause you
didn't leave a tip.

113
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:04,347
And usually when I've
provided excellent service,

114
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:06,316
my customers like
to tip me.

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,134
Well, there is
an 18% tip included.

116
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:10,470
Generally, I do leave
an additional tip,

117
00:05:10,521 --> 00:05:14,024
but you know what? I'm kind of
protesting the additional tip.

118
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:16,276
- I don't care for it.
- You're protesting.

119
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:19,062
Yes. Let 'em charge me
20%. Let 'em charge me 25%.

120
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,249
I'd rather be charged
a 30% tip included

121
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:26,319
than have to add up 18%
to 20% to 25%... Whatever.

122
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,338
It's not that much.
It's 2%.

123
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:32,242
- It's hard to get to 2%.
- You take 1%, just move the decimal place two spots.

124
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,594
Okay, you have a system.
I don't have a system

125
00:05:34,662 --> 00:05:36,129
to get to 2%.

126
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:38,798
You know, don't make me
do math at the table.

127
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:40,634
So you're protesting math.

128
00:05:40,685 --> 00:05:42,802
I'm protesting math.
Exactly.

129
00:05:58,703 --> 00:06:01,288
- Boy, this is ridiculous.
- This is insane.

130
00:06:01,355 --> 00:06:02,906
20 minutes he's looking
for this ball.

131
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,925
I know.

132
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:08,695
Hey, norm,
drop a ball.

133
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:10,780
- Huh?
- You've been looking for 20 minutes.

134
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:13,183
- Just drop a ball.
- I haven't been looking for 20 minutes.

135
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:16,186
You can't hold up the whole course
like this! Let us play through!

136
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:18,655
You don't play through.
Out of the question!

137
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:21,057
It's not right!
It's very inconsiderate!

138
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:23,159
I'm not inconsiderate!
You're inconsiderate!

139
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:25,295
- You're inconsiderate!
- No, you are!

140
00:06:25,363 --> 00:06:26,930
- You want to do me a favor?
- Yeah yeah.

141
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:29,165
- Shove it up your ass.
- Are you happy you had the onions?!

142
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:31,101
Huh?! Are you glad
you had the onions?!

143
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:33,169
I can't find
the goddamn ball!

144
00:06:33,237 --> 00:06:35,639
- Let's go!
- Don't be angry at me just 'cause you're angry at him.

145
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:39,042
- We'll come back tomorrow.
- I come here to relax, to have a good time!

146
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,860
Crispy onions!
They have to be crispy!

147
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:42,579
"i can't eat breakfast

148
00:06:42,663 --> 00:06:44,030
unless I have
crispy onions!"

149
00:06:44,098 --> 00:06:46,032
- how's your wife?
- Fuck you, norm!

150
00:06:48,436 --> 00:06:52,572
- That was a lot of fun.
- Yeah, what a time.

151
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:54,407
Hey, you!

152
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:55,925
Yes, you.

153
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,927
Did you have to yell and
scream at norm out there?

154
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:00,413
- Did you?
- Yeah, I did have to yell and scream.

155
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:02,465
You guys are the slowest
foursome in the club.

156
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,083
You're very
inconsiderate.

157
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:06,102
He's looking for a ball
for half an hour.

158
00:07:06,187 --> 00:07:09,022
You don't yell at somebody
who has high blood pressure.

159
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,890
I didn't know he has
high blood pressure.

160
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:12,692
You know what happens when you yell
at somebody with high blood pressure?

161
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,427
They have a heart attack
and they die.

162
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,397
That's exactly what
happened. Norm is dead.

163
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:22,101
That's right.

164
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:24,237
So you're blaming me?

165
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:26,206
- Yes!
- It's not my fault

166
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:27,774
that he had
a heart attack.

167
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:30,877
- Did you even know him?
- I did know him somewhat.

168
00:07:30,945 --> 00:07:33,613
- Did you like him at all?
- No, I thought he was a prick.

169
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:35,281
You know,
that's interesting

170
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:38,301
because I heard so many stories
about you when I joined this club

171
00:07:38,386 --> 00:07:41,721
and I could not believe that they
were all true about one human being.

172
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:44,257
Now I know that
everything that I've heard

173
00:07:44,308 --> 00:07:46,242
- is true.
- What did you hear?

174
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,977
What did you hear?
Tell me what you heard.

175
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:53,149
- What?
- You're getting quite a reputation

176
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:55,018
- here at the club.
- What are you talking about?

177
00:07:55,102 --> 00:07:57,437
- I didn't do anything.
- Look, it may have been an accident,

178
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:00,023
- but you're a murderer.
- How dare you?!

179
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:01,691
No, you're not a murderer.
You're not a murderer.

180
00:08:01,776 --> 00:08:03,326
It's involuntary
manslaughter.

181
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:04,977
You didn't intend to kill
him, but you killed him.

182
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:07,614
- I didn't kill him!
- I'm not pointing fingers,

183
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:08,782
but you killed him.
You did!

184
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,083
Hey, let me
tell you something:

185
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,001
the minute you wanted
those crispy onions,

186
00:08:12,086 --> 00:08:13,820
you put a gun
to that guy's head.

187
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:15,789
You're right. If he hadn't
ordered those eggs that way,

188
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,793
you wouldn't be guilty
of involuntary manslaughter.

189
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:24,831
What time are we
playing tomorrow?

190
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:27,333
- Early. Yup.
- Early. Yeah.

191
00:08:27,385 --> 00:08:28,601
Early.
Good idea.

192
00:08:30,905 --> 00:08:33,807
So what's the deal with the "seinfeld"
reunion? Are they all doing it?

193
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,809
Yeah, the read-through
is next week.

194
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,228
- How about that?
- Yeah, that's great.

195
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:41,698
Ooh, the stonemason called
and he said he'll call back.

196
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:43,683
I picked up the phone.

197
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:46,403
Oh, and while I was on the
phone, I think I sold him a hat.

198
00:08:46,487 --> 00:08:48,154
- Are you kidding?
- On the phone.

199
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:50,607
The stonemason is gonna
buy a hat from you?

200
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:53,025
- What kind of hat?
- Nat, you haven't seen her hats?

201
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:54,861
Oh my gosh,
wait till you see this!

202
00:08:54,912 --> 00:08:56,529
What she does...
She's so creative!

203
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,164
She astounds me.
Look at this.

204
00:08:58,232 --> 00:08:59,866
This is what I live
to do. It's my passion.

205
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:03,420
Right, so how do you get
to take care of your baby?

206
00:09:03,504 --> 00:09:05,388
I have to work.

207
00:09:05,473 --> 00:09:07,707
Listen, kids cost
a lot of money nowadays.

208
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:10,560
We got health insurance
and school and college.

209
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:13,313
It's tough to live in new york.
We're saving already for college.

210
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,515
Okay. You know
what I'm gonna do?

211
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:20,103
I'm gonna pay for skylar
to go to college.

212
00:09:20,187 --> 00:09:22,689
- Oh, cut it out.
- Larry.

213
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,074
- What do you think of that?
- Are you serious?

214
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:27,327
- Yeah, I'm gonna do it.
- That's...

215
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,195
I don't have any kids.
I have money.

216
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:31,030
I'll do it. I don't want
you to worry about that.

217
00:09:31,081 --> 00:09:34,200
- By golly. Oh my god!
- That's everything!

218
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:36,119
- That's everything.
- Uncle nat, look who you raised.

219
00:09:36,203 --> 00:09:39,706
- Yes, I'm lookin' at him.
- I can't believe what you're doing.

220
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:41,073
I'm gonna make you
a thank-you hat.

221
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:42,425
Don't make me
a thank-you hat.

222
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,477
It's done.

223
00:09:44,545 --> 00:09:46,245
You know what would be a
great thing that you could do?

224
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:48,848
If you could show it to some
of your celebrity friends,

225
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:53,603
- like jerry seinfeld.
- Jerry seinfeld is not gonna wear that hat.

226
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:55,605
- You don't know!
- Yeah, I do know.

227
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,307
Or some athlete friend?

228
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:59,726
- Hello.
- Hey, it's ed... The stonemason.

229
00:09:59,777 --> 00:10:02,896
Oh, hey. So I want you to do me a favor

230
00:10:02,947 --> 00:10:06,399
- and change the inscription on my mother's stone.
- Okay.

231
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,451
Okay, well you know
"passed away"

232
00:10:08,536 --> 00:10:10,887
is written on there
spelled p-a-s-t?

233
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:12,822
Who was that yankee
you had on "seinfeld"?

234
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,774
- Derek jeter?
- He could wear one.

235
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:16,993
That guy sucks.

236
00:10:17,077 --> 00:10:18,828
- Who sucks?
- Derek jeter.

237
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:20,713
He's the most overrated
player in baseball.

238
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:23,115
- What did you say?
- I can't stand derek jeter.

239
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,802
You know he's the worst offensive
shortstop in baseball statistically?

240
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,922
Oh, bullshit. He's a great clutch
hitter. He's a great clutch player.

241
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:30,807
Larry, come on back.

242
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,425
There's no way he deserves that
kind of money he's making.

243
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:35,979
Okay, you know what?
Do me a favor

244
00:10:36,063 --> 00:10:38,181
and just take care
of the stone, please?

245
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:40,567
- Will do.
- Thank you.

246
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:44,687
- How great is this day?
- Gorgeous.

247
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:47,657
Where is everybody? Yesterday
it was packed. Nobody's here.

248
00:10:47,741 --> 00:10:49,576
I think it's out
of respect for norm.

249
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:52,612
Yeah, you know, this is the hole
that norm had the heart attack on.

250
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,247
- This is the hole?
- This is the hole.

251
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:55,532
- Wow.
- Yeah.

252
00:10:58,151 --> 00:11:00,537
Oh, god damn it.

253
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:02,539
A good swing;
you came over it.

254
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,541
- What am I doing?
- You came over the top of it.

255
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,292
Right by the pond.
You're right by the pond.

256
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,710
Enjoy the swans.

257
00:11:40,077 --> 00:11:42,712
Hey! Hey!

258
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,998
Hey!
Hey!

259
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:46,549
Hey!

260
00:11:53,707 --> 00:11:56,476
And then I looked up and he
started coming towards me.

261
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,095
He attacked me!
He leapt at me!

262
00:11:59,163 --> 00:12:00,964
- Did you provoke him?
- No, I didn't do anything.

263
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,399
You know this is
takahashi's pet swan.

264
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:06,385
This is the love
of his life.

265
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:07,720
You think I wanted
to kill it?

266
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:08,888
I didn't want
to kill a swan!

267
00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:11,057
Well, we're gonna have
to call animal control

268
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,892
- or the wildlife society or something like that.
- Are you out of your mind?

269
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,628
There could be something in the
food or water... They're attacking!

270
00:12:15,696 --> 00:12:17,430
Nobody's calling anybody.
You got that?

271
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:19,983
Nobody's calling anybody. We'll
get kicked out of the club.

272
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,517
Okay. Well, I gotta tell my wife.

273
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:23,569
Hey!
No wives. Nobody.

274
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,171
Come on, I tell
my wife everything.

275
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:27,840
It was something that we
agreed to in our marriage vows.

276
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:29,642
You tell your
wife everything?!

277
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,577
She won't tell anybody,
but I got to tell her.

278
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:33,112
- I have to tell her.
- Are you crazy?!

279
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,547
- What?
- You don't tell your wife anything!

280
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:36,516
My wife thinks
i'm at the office.

281
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,585
The only time I tell her I'm playing
golf is when I'm with another woman!

282
00:12:39,637 --> 00:12:41,387
You got to cover
your tracks.

283
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:44,256
We're a foursome here. We're
all in this together. No wives!

284
00:12:44,308 --> 00:12:46,225
All right.
Fine.

285
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:47,844
We got to bury
this thing now.

286
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:49,896
Yeah, let's bury it.
We'll bury it in the woods.

287
00:12:49,947 --> 00:12:52,115
- Andy: seriously?!
- Yeah. Come on, pick it up.

288
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,567
- No, you pick it up. You killed it.
- You pick it up.

289
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:57,553
Oh, this is horrible.

290
00:12:57,621 --> 00:13:00,690
Oh, it's horrible.
This is horrible.

291
00:13:21,428 --> 00:13:23,513
- Fruit's good.
- Yeah.

292
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:27,133
- Delicious, isn't it?
- How can you talk about the food?

293
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:30,770
I want to throw up. We
should get out of here.

294
00:13:30,838 --> 00:13:33,556
- Yes, let's get out of here.
- Oh, that's a wonderful idea.

295
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:34,807
I want to get
out of here now.

296
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:36,776
Let me explain something
to you, moron.

297
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:39,779
Swan killers leave.

298
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,082
People who aren't
swan killers stay,

299
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,785
have a little lunch,
enjoy themselves,

300
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:48,204
socialize,
get to know the members.

301
00:13:48,272 --> 00:13:50,173
There's nothing wrong.
Get it?

302
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,175
Guess what?

303
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:54,460
I'm not a swan killer.
Okay?

304
00:13:54,511 --> 00:13:58,264
Hey, let me remind you
of something, asshole:

305
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:01,851
you're talking way too loud
about swan killing

306
00:14:01,935 --> 00:14:03,336
in the dining room.

307
00:14:03,404 --> 00:14:05,271
Why is that so hard
to understand?

308
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:07,390
How many rules are you
gonna break, okay?

309
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:10,777
You're not supposed to have your
phone on. It's always ringing.

310
00:14:10,844 --> 00:14:12,862
- You killed a swan!
- Keep your fucking voice down!

311
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:15,148
- You killed a swan.
- Shut up! Shut up!

312
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,756
Why did I
order turkey?

313
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,091
I should've just had
the eggs and onions.

314
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:43,760
I know
they're good here.

315
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:46,345
Will you do me a favor and
shut up about your food?

316
00:14:46,396 --> 00:14:48,181
He's right. All you're doing
is complaining about your food.

317
00:14:48,232 --> 00:14:49,882
I told you to get the fruit.
It's delicious.

318
00:14:49,933 --> 00:14:52,068
I had fruit this morning. What
am I gonna order it twice for?

319
00:14:52,152 --> 00:14:53,686
- You can have fruit twice in one day.
- You can't.

320
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:55,221
You get the acid. It'll
rip a hole in your stomach.

321
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:57,774
They have non-acidic fruit. You
got papaya and mango and banana.

322
00:14:57,858 --> 00:15:00,777
Hey, uh,
what's that?

323
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,760
- What do you think that is?
- I don't know,

324
00:15:17,845 --> 00:15:19,578
but it's not what
you're thinking.

325
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:22,131
We just buried the thing 20 minutes
ago. They're not gonna find it already.

326
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,017
Oh no.
Look.

327
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,720
Clubhouse!

328
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:54,881
Now what are we gonna do?

329
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:56,966
It was a bird. What
were you so scared of?

330
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,168
- A bird!
- It was self-defense!

331
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:00,786
What could it have
possibly done to you?

332
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:03,122
- It could've killed me.
- It's not a wild boar!

333
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:05,007
You should've seen
when it leaped in the air!

334
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:09,812
Why even bury it? Why were
you thinking of burying it?

335
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:13,299
Mr. Takahashi

336
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,268
would like to see you all
in his office now.

337
00:16:24,294 --> 00:16:26,762
So, gentlemen.

338
00:16:29,032 --> 00:16:31,000
You know what this is?

339
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:33,252
This is tee sheet.

340
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:36,455
It tells me who played

341
00:16:36,506 --> 00:16:37,623
and who did not play.

342
00:16:37,691 --> 00:16:39,625
Only one other
group played.

343
00:16:39,676 --> 00:16:42,378
Course not crowded.

344
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,347
Respect for norm.

345
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,217
Oh. You played.

346
00:16:48,302 --> 00:16:49,835
Why?
You no respect norm?

347
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:52,889
- No no, of course.
- Absolutely.

348
00:16:52,973 --> 00:16:54,724
Although he was
a slow player.

349
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:59,478
What else you not respect?

350
00:17:01,865 --> 00:17:03,482
Beautiful black swan?

351
00:17:05,903 --> 00:17:07,853
We adore swans!

352
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:10,356
My beautiful
black swan kyoko

353
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,691
was killed, murdered.

354
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:16,128
Who killed kyoko?

355
00:17:16,196 --> 00:17:18,748
You.
I don't know you.

356
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:20,082
- Who are you?
- I'm a guest here.

357
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,919
If I may say, I think the
food here is just great.

358
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:25,454
- I ordered some eggs with...
- You kill swan?

359
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:27,657
No, sir.

360
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,825
I'm from out of town. I have
no reason to kill the swan.

361
00:17:29,893 --> 00:17:33,145
You.
You smart guy.

362
00:17:33,213 --> 00:17:34,713
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

363
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:36,715
- You not kill swan.
- Oh, no, sir.

364
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,567
But you know
who kill swan.

365
00:17:38,652 --> 00:17:41,404
Well, I don't think...
No, I don't think I do.

366
00:17:41,488 --> 00:17:45,308
- You like club?
- I love this club.

367
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:49,328
You tell me,
free dues.

368
00:17:49,396 --> 00:17:51,330
No more dues.

369
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:53,950
- For life?
- Whole life.

370
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,289
- Valet parking?
- Any time.

371
00:18:00,374 --> 00:18:03,092
- Marty: range balls?
- All you want.

372
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:05,761
If you tell me.
Tell me.

373
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:13,419
Um, no I really can't think
of who could've done it.

374
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:18,524
- You.
- Hmm.

375
00:18:18,591 --> 00:18:20,559
- You kill swan?
- No, I'd never kill a swan.

376
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,561
- Why? You stupid.
- I'm not stupid.

377
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:24,397
Yes.
You marry big-mouth wife.

378
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:26,399
She does have
a big mouth.

379
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,651
Yes, maybe I talk
to her.

380
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,653
No, don't call her.

381
00:18:30,737 --> 00:18:33,456
I don't even bring her
around anymore out of respect.

382
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,709
oh.
Larry.

383
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:40,162
- How are you?
- I'm good.

384
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:42,031
Yeah?

385
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:49,638
- You kill kyoko?
- No.

386
00:18:49,723 --> 00:18:51,007
- Yeah.
- No.

387
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:12,611
I can't talk now.
I'll call you back.

388
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:15,197
No cell phone
in the clubhouse!

389
00:19:15,282 --> 00:19:16,582
Last warning!

390
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:19,285
Now go!
go!

391
00:19:22,172 --> 00:19:27,376
- Hey, where you going?
- Oh, they're having a memorial for norm at the club.

392
00:19:27,444 --> 00:19:29,462
- And tomorrow a funeral.
- Oh my god.

393
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,881
Two days in a row. This is
worse than playing behind him.

394
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:33,832
Anyway, I came in
to thank you

395
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:37,136
for your gracious offe for
putting skylar through college.

396
00:19:37,187 --> 00:19:40,689
- Well, you're... You're welcome.
- Thank you.

397
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:43,359
I mean, my wife and I were
talking about it in bed last night.

398
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:45,111
And you know what
cassie said to me?

399
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:47,813
She wants to go
to cosmetology school.

400
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:50,516
So would you put her
through cosmetology school?

401
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:55,687
- What?
- This is her calling.

402
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,706
Would I put her through
cosmetology school?

403
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,208
She's great
with lotions!

404
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,243
I mean, have you
ever... What she does...

405
00:20:01,328 --> 00:20:04,029
Oh my god, she was born to do this.

406
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:07,866
I have to say
i'm very put off by this.

407
00:20:07,918 --> 00:20:09,835
- Why?
- I make this generous offer

408
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:11,837
to pay for your
daughter's education

409
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:15,174
and now you want me to put your
wife through cosmetology school?!

410
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:16,842
- Yeah.
- All of a sudden?

411
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,677
No, I just think
it's wrong.

412
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:21,013
It's very wrong of you
to ask me that.

413
00:20:21,064 --> 00:20:23,983
- Don't you get that?
- How irrational a man can you be?

414
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,768
What's happening?
You're saying no?

415
00:20:25,852 --> 00:20:27,520
Yes, I'm saying no.

416
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:29,888
I just thought it would be
a gesture. It would be nice.

417
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,491
- She'd be perfect for it.
- I thought I made my nice gesture

418
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,111
- with your daughter.
- We don't even know if skylar's gonna go to college.

419
00:20:35,195 --> 00:20:37,163
I'm not saying it wasn't
a beautiful gesture,

420
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,864
but who knows?
She might be a drug addict.

421
00:20:38,932 --> 00:20:41,367
I don't know what kind of people
can do something like that.

422
00:20:41,418 --> 00:20:44,036
What kind of people... You know
what kind of people we're not?

423
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:46,372
We're not the kind of
people that kill swans.

424
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,126
That's the kind of people.
We don't kill swans.

425
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:55,764
We were in bed and we were...
I was talking about that...

426
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:57,516
I had to tell her, larry.

427
00:20:57,584 --> 00:21:00,052
Don't worry. She's
not gonna say anything.

428
00:21:01,972 --> 00:21:03,422
The two of you
had better keep

429
00:21:03,473 --> 00:21:05,891
your goddamn traps shut
about this swan.

430
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:08,177
- Or what, larry? Are you threatening me?
- Yeah.

431
00:21:08,245 --> 00:21:10,479
What are you gonna do?
What will you do to me?

432
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:13,032
- What can you do to me?
- I'll open that closet door

433
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:16,035
and take every one
of those hats

434
00:21:16,102 --> 00:21:17,603
and destroy 'em.

435
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:19,572
The blue hat,
the orange hat,

436
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:22,274
the one with the cockle shells,
the one with the feathers,

437
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:25,628
and let's not forget the red one you're
making for that asshole stonemason.

438
00:21:25,712 --> 00:21:27,913
You stop! You will not touch those hats!

439
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:31,617
- I will destroy them.
- You will not touch my hats!

440
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:33,202
Keep your
goddamn mouth shut!

441
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,921
She will!
You're not gonna ruin a hat.

442
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:37,973
And you!
How dare you say something?!

443
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:40,259
Larry, I'm not gonna
tell anybody. Don't worry.

444
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:49,401
- Hey.
- Hey, L.D.

445
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:51,303
I was just saying
I feel so nostalgic.

446
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:53,355
- I'm thinking about my mom and dad.
- Really?

447
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,474
- Well.
- How's your dad?

448
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:57,409
He's good.
He's good.

449
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:59,778
Yeah, I'm changing
the headstone.

450
00:21:59,829 --> 00:22:01,580
Great. Great.

451
00:22:01,648 --> 00:22:04,116
By the way, I was talking to the
stonemason on the phone the other night?

452
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:06,669
What an asshole this guy is.

453
00:22:06,736 --> 00:22:09,088
He butts in on a conversation
that's none of his business,

454
00:22:09,155 --> 00:22:11,540
starts telling me
how jeter's overrated.

455
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,459
What an ignorant moron.

456
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,660
- Okay.
- My god.

457
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,296
Please, give me a break.
There's not one person

458
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:19,381
who's ever said that
except this asshole.

459
00:22:19,466 --> 00:22:21,684
- Honestly.
- I'm an asshole?

460
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:23,835
Who are you?

461
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:26,088
I'm ed...
The stonemason.

462
00:22:26,156 --> 00:22:28,140
ah.

463
00:22:31,511 --> 00:22:33,112
What are you doing here?

464
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,782
Did marty's mom's headstone
and his dad's headstone.

465
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:38,484
I'm doing norm's headstone.

466
00:22:38,535 --> 00:22:40,703
I hope I get to do
yours real soon, prick.

467
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,325
See you later, eddie.

468
00:22:46,376 --> 00:22:47,876
Why didn't you tell me
he was the stonemason?

469
00:22:47,944 --> 00:22:50,045
Oh, you wanted
an introduction.

470
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,213
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

471
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:53,749
What about your policy?
No introductions.

472
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:55,985
I know, but there's
extenuating circumstances.

473
00:22:56,052 --> 00:22:58,804
No no, you said they were
a stupid social convention.

474
00:22:58,872 --> 00:23:00,789
So I'm hoisted
on my own petard.

475
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,675
Exactly.

476
00:23:02,742 --> 00:23:04,376
Hmm.

477
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:05,877
Where's jeff?

478
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:07,263
Oh, he said he was
gonna be late.

479
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:10,182
Look, he sent me
this email.

480
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,718
Look at this.

481
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:15,271
He wants me to come clean
about the swan.

482
00:23:15,338 --> 00:23:18,157
- I think it's a good idea.
- No, it's not a good idea. Keep your mouth shut.

483
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:19,241
Man: everyone, if I could
have your attention?

484
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:20,892
If you'll please take
your seats,

485
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:22,561
we're about
to get started.

486
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:26,699
Thank you all for coming. As you
know, the funeral is tomorrow,

487
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,234
but we wanted to do
something special today,

488
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:31,587
and that's celebrate
norm's life

489
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:34,123
in a special
memorial service.

490
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:37,042
And where else?
The place he loved the most...

491
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:39,128
His beloved club.

492
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:41,347
Norm loved nothing more
than coming here

493
00:23:41,414 --> 00:23:43,599
and enjoying
a leisurely game of golf.

494
00:24:04,037 --> 00:24:07,039
Please turn off
your cell phones and pagers.

495
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:08,374
Thank you.

496
00:24:12,879 --> 00:24:16,949
- Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

497
00:24:17,017 --> 00:24:20,452
- What what what?
- You killed him, larry.

498
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,457
Oh, no. In fact, I have a theory
i'd like to present to you.

499
00:24:25,508 --> 00:24:27,476
May I tell you my theory?

500
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:30,679
Okay. I believe
this is what happened:

501
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:34,583
norm had the heart attack
on the 12th hole

502
00:24:34,651 --> 00:24:36,402
near the pond,
am I right?

503
00:24:36,469 --> 00:24:37,686
- Yeah.
- Okay.

504
00:24:37,754 --> 00:24:43,575
I think he was attacked
by the black swan.

505
00:24:43,643 --> 00:24:45,911
The swan is dead, larry.

506
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:49,031
He's dead now.
He was very much alive

507
00:24:49,115 --> 00:24:50,749
at the time norm
had the heart attack

508
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:52,818
and at that pond
with norm.

509
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,586
Here, the two
of them over here.

510
00:24:54,654 --> 00:24:57,206
I had nothing to do with it.
I'm on my way to the locker room.

511
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:59,491
I'm here.
I'm over here.

512
00:24:59,542 --> 00:25:01,710
Here's norm
and the swan.

513
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:04,129
Here's norm.
Kyoko the crazy black swan.

514
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,548
Norm. Heart attack. Down.
That's what happened.

515
00:25:06,633 --> 00:25:07,850
That's why norm died.

516
00:25:07,917 --> 00:25:09,885
That black swan
was a menace.

517
00:25:09,969 --> 00:25:11,136
They should've put that swan
away a long time ago.

518
00:25:11,187 --> 00:25:13,756
I don't know who killed
that black swan,

519
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:15,858
but whoever did it

520
00:25:15,942 --> 00:25:17,609
was a hero.

521
00:25:17,677 --> 00:25:19,144
A hero.

522
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:27,619
Ah, Mr. David,
I believe this is yours.

523
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:32,291
Yeah.

524
00:25:32,358 --> 00:25:34,993
That's some blackberry you got
here. This wheel is amazing.

525
00:25:35,044 --> 00:25:37,863
You can really just scroll
right through those emails, huh?

526
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:40,783
Yeah.

527
00:25:42,902 --> 00:25:45,754
- Thanks.
- It's always a pleasure serving you, sir.

528
00:25:48,224 --> 00:25:50,709
There's no doubt that he read
your email about the swan killing.

529
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,761
He's gonna tell takahashi.
We're screwed.

530
00:25:52,846 --> 00:25:54,396
We're all screwed,
there's no doubt about it.

531
00:25:56,766 --> 00:26:01,270
There's, uh... There's
an 18% gratuity included.

532
00:26:04,607 --> 00:26:05,858
So...

533
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,611
- That's a shakedown.
- That's a shakedown.

534
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:11,613
This is as clear
as can be.

535
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:13,665
I'll take care
of this.

536
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:27,078
All right.

537
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,249
- All set?
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:32,134
Great.
We'll see you.

539
00:26:34,187 --> 00:26:36,121
Is this, uh...

540
00:26:36,189 --> 00:26:37,940
Is this for real?

541
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,108
Oh yeah.

542
00:26:40,176 --> 00:26:42,211
Yeah, that's for real.

543
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:44,313
Mr. David,
thank you so much.

544
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:47,399
- You're welcome.
- This is so generous.

545
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:50,402
And let's... Let's keep
this between the two of us.

546
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:53,739
- No problem.
- You know, like everything else.

547
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,374
Yeah.
Yeah, like everything else.

548
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:58,694
You know, like everything...
Everything else.

549
00:26:58,761 --> 00:27:01,446
Thank you again.
Really.

550
00:27:01,498 --> 00:27:04,149
What a generous guy.

551
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:06,768
I don't think he knew what the
fuck you were talking about.

552
00:27:09,873 --> 00:27:13,942
He had the heart attack right
by the pond. It was the swan.

553
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,228
Think about it.
It's a theory.

554
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:19,498
Anyway, it was a lovely service.
I'll see you at the club.

555
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:21,466
Larry, I'd like
talk to you.

556
00:27:21,518 --> 00:27:23,652
Yes, Mr. Takahashi?

557
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:26,605
I heard about your big
additional tip to waiter.

558
00:27:26,673 --> 00:27:28,640
Such generosity.

559
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:32,861
You know, most people
don't give additional tip.

560
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:35,531
Now I know a man
so generous

561
00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:39,151
could not have killed
my black swan, my kyoko.

562
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:41,036
Of course
I didn't kill kyoko.

563
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,337
I was trying
to tell you that.

564
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:43,789
You forgive me?

565
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,707
Okay.

566
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,827
- I'll forgive you.
- Thank you.

567
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:50,829
Lost a little face,
didn't you?

568
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,214
A little... Oh, a lot.
I lost a lot of face.

569
00:27:52,282 --> 00:27:54,383
- Got your face back?
- Yes yes yes.

570
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,670
- Oh, you going to car?
- Actually, I'm going to see my mother's gravestone,

571
00:27:58,721 --> 00:28:01,557
but it's on the way
to the parking lot.

572
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:04,026
- We walk together.
- Let us walk together.

573
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,111
After you, sir.
After you.

574
00:28:06,178 --> 00:28:08,847
I have a couple things I wanted
to discuss with you actually.

575
00:28:08,898 --> 00:28:11,516
Let's get rid of that additional
tip in the dining room.

576
00:28:11,584 --> 00:28:13,652
Nobody wants to sit and do math
after they eat to figure out

577
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,354
- and additional tip.
- No math.

578
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:18,490
Make it a 20% flat...
Make it 25%.

579
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:20,492
- Yes, 25%.
- 25%.

580
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:22,160
- Huh? You like that?
- I love it.

581
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:25,397
- Okay, Mr. Takahashi.
- I like that.

582
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:27,416
Very much!

583
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:29,668
Last time you leave
a big tip

584
00:28:29,719 --> 00:28:31,386
it always
go to the waiter.

585
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:33,288
They like you
so much.

586
00:28:33,356 --> 00:28:35,090
- All right, you take care.
- Bye bye!

587
00:28:35,158 --> 00:28:36,158
Okay.

588
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,000
