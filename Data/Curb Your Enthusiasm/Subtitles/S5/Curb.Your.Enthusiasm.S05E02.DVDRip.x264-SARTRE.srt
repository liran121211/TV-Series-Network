1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,577


2
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:15,545
So then he goes
like this...

3
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:17,911
I go, "What is it, Dad?"
He goes...

4
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:19,917
like this.
He can't talk.

5
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:22,317
He's in the hospital,
the bed, you know?

6
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:26,556
So I lean in,
and he whispers in my ear.

7
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:28,958
He says to me,

8
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:31,656
"You're adopted."

9
00:00:33,032 --> 00:00:35,523
- He said that?
- I think he said that.

10
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,002
Maybe he said,
"You're a doctor." I don't know.

11
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:41,030
But why would he say I'm a doctor?
I would know if I'm a doctor.

12
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,474
Why do you think he would wait
until now to tell you?

13
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:44,841
Maybe he thought
he was dying.

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,903
But I'm still not 100% sure
that he said it.

15
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:49,040
So basically
what you're saying is,

16
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:51,483
you want me to find out
if you're adopted or not.

17
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,146
Yes.

18
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:55,655
First, how did you
find me?

19
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,749
My friend said
he read this big article

20
00:00:57,792 --> 00:00:59,761
about you
in the L.A. Magazine.

21
00:00:59,795 --> 00:01:02,923
"Best Best Private
Investigator in Los Angeles."

22
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,933
Look, Mr. David,

23
00:01:04,967 --> 00:01:06,935
I have to be honest
with you.

24
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,937
My business
and what I do...

25
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:10,735
what I do is
I service the community.

26
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:12,400
Basically
what I'm saying is,

27
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:14,535
I don't see a way
that you would, uh,

28
00:01:14,577 --> 00:01:16,704
be helping my community.

29
00:01:16,746 --> 00:01:18,714
What about...

30
00:01:18,748 --> 00:01:20,717
calling some bingo games
or something?

31
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:23,743
You got, like, a community center
for bingo?

32
00:01:23,787 --> 00:01:25,846
Bingo's a distraction.

33
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,721
Don't underestimate bingo.

34
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:31,793
I've got extra sneakers
that I don't wear anymore

35
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,390
- in pretty good condition, I must say.
- Extra sneakers?

36
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:36,229
I'd be more than happy
to donate 'em.

37
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:39,237
Mr. David, I don't think
this is gonna work.

38
00:01:39,271 --> 00:01:41,240
It would mean
an awful lot to me.

39
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:43,242
Please please,
think about it.

40
00:01:43,276 --> 00:01:45,676
If there's anything
I can do to convince you,

41
00:01:45,711 --> 00:01:48,145
- I would.
- I can't promise anything.

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,308
What about a big brother
kind of thing?

43
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:54,053
Let me talk to some
of my community leaders

44
00:01:54,087 --> 00:01:56,055
and see exactly what
the community needs...

45
00:01:56,089 --> 00:01:58,216
I'm not talking about
for a long time.

46
00:01:58,258 --> 00:02:00,226
Maybe for one afternoon,

47
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:02,092
to a movie or something.

48
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,266
Um, is that a key
to the men's room?

49
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:08,496
Well, it says "men"
on it. Yes.

50
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:10,630
It's a natural question
to ask.

51
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,403
- Yes.
- May I borrow the key?

52
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,433
- Yes, you may borrow the key.
- Thank you.

53
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,604
Okay.
Thanks, Mr. Jones.

54
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:19,614
- And you'll think about it?
- I will.

55
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:20,673
By the way...

56
00:02:20,717 --> 00:02:23,083
Iove the bow-tie.

57
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:37,996
- What are you doing?!
- Using the bathroom.

58
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:40,663
That's my stall!
Did you see the plaque on it...

59
00:02:40,705 --> 00:02:43,197
Yes, I know, but somebody was using
the other one, so l...

60
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:45,141
Well, then you wait!

61
00:02:45,177 --> 00:02:47,941
I couldn't wait.
It was an emergency. I had to go!

62
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,278
There's one stall for me,
and you're in it!

63
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:52,807
If you were here,
I would have given you first dibs.

64
00:02:52,852 --> 00:02:55,548
But honestly, I haven't seen
a handicapped person in the bathroom,

65
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:58,489
maybe ever. So I thought I could
perhaps take my chances.

66
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,492
"A handicapped person"?

67
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:03,018
That's nice.
Oh, that's nice!

68
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:04,826
- It's called disabled. Disabled.
- Disabled?

69
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,799
Well, that doesn't
sound so hot.

70
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:10,463
I don't really care what it sounds like
to you, okay? It's disabled.

71
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:12,200
I think I would prefer
handicapped.

72
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,266
God, you know how archaic that word is?
"A handicapped person"!

73
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,743
That's demeaning,
don't you know?

74
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:18,336
- I'm a disabled person.
- Oh, sorry.

75
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,904
- You're sorry.
- Oh, sorry.

76
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:22,213
Now you've learned a lesson.
Please, don't ever go

77
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:24,344
- in my stall again! All right?
- Fine, okay.

78
00:03:24,387 --> 00:03:25,752
- Thanks so much!
- You're welcome.

79
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,221
- I appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

80
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:29,247
Douche-bag.

81
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:36,065
So you think
he's a Muslim?

82
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,329
- He had the bow-tie.
- Huh?

83
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,996
Do black men who aren't Muslims
ever wear bow-ties?

84
00:03:41,038 --> 00:03:44,202
- I haven't seen it.
- It'd be interesting to find that out.

85
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,437
- I'm surprised you didn't ask him.
- Yeah, me too.

86
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,911
I mean, you know, I don't care
either way, I'm just curious.

87
00:03:48,946 --> 00:03:51,847
Well, I'll tell you something,
that I think he's a Muslim.

88
00:03:51,883 --> 00:03:53,681
Hey, that's
a handicapped spot.

89
00:03:57,423 --> 00:03:58,981
Wh-wh-what?

90
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:00,719
What's with the walking?

91
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,160
Fuck you!

92
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:05,096
I have a stutter!

93
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:07,566
Yeah, but you can walk.

94
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,626
Look at my license plate!

95
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,639
I have permission,

96
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:15,005
you fucking prick!

97
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:28,089
Oh hey...

98
00:04:28,123 --> 00:04:29,750
we got a dog.

99
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,656
Really? Why?

100
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:34,390
- She wanted a dog.
- You have to walk it and everything?

101
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:36,955
- I'm sure I'll wind up doing stuff.
- Oh, definitely.

102
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:39,297
I know, yeah, but you know what?
It's kind of cute.

103
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:40,927
- Larry!
- I kind of like it. Hi!

104
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,939
- Hi!
- Jodi!

105
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:44,565
- How are you?
- Great, great.

106
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,633
- So good to see you!
- Great to see you.

107
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:48,838
- Hi Jodi. How are you doing?
- Hi.

108
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:50,972
- How are you doing,
- Ms. Jodi Funkhouser?

109
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,845
- So what's going on?
- Nothing.

110
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:55,716
Seeking attention,
getting rejected.

111
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,313
- Are those new glasses?
- No, but I cleaned them.

112
00:04:58,356 --> 00:05:00,187
You're so funny!

113
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:02,022
- I'm here with my dad.
- Oh yeah?

114
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,519
Are you coming to my parents'
25th anniversary party?

115
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:06,826
I am.

116
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:09,426
- Oh. Are you?
- Eh...

117
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:11,436
It'll be fun, really.
Think about it.

118
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,405
I'm not gonna think about it,
but whatever.

119
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,998
- I really hope you come.
- Well, thanks.

120
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,032
- It's so good to see you.
- Good to see you.

121
00:05:17,077 --> 00:05:19,045
- Wow, great to see you.
- Yeah. Bye-bye.

122
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,774
Bye.

123
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:24,383
All right,
is it my imagination?

124
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:27,216
Does she like you that much or does
she dislike me that much?

125
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:30,053
Oh, lesbians love me.
They love me.

126
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,423
- How is that?
- Well, when I first got to L.A.

127
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,429
You remember... you know Patty,
my friend Patty.

128
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,124
- Patty, yeah.
- Well, she's a lesbian.

129
00:05:36,165 --> 00:05:37,632
- Yes.
- You know, so, obviously,

130
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,964
they talk amongst themselves,
and the word got out

131
00:05:40,002 --> 00:05:42,402
that I'm a friend
o' lesbians.

132
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:45,339
- You're a friend o' lesbians!
- Yes, they know that.

133
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,502
So the community
has completely embraced you.

134
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:50,672
Totally embraced me.
Completely.

135
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:52,806
More so than any other
community.

136
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:54,818
Including Jews.

137
00:05:54,852 --> 00:05:56,581
- Ready? This way.
- Hi, two. Yeah.

138
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,724
Oh, Jeez.

139
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:06,261
The men's room key from the private
investigator's office.

140
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:07,925
I forgot
to bring it back.

141
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:10,196
- I'm always doing that.
- Hey,

142
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,703
check out
the bow-tie here.

143
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:14,729
It's a smart look.

144
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:16,799
I think I'm gonna
get me one of those.

145
00:06:16,842 --> 00:06:19,140
You know what?
You oughtta try wearing a bow-tie.

146
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,146
- It'd be a good look for you. Hi!
- Hi.

147
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,977
- How are you doing? How are you doing?
- Great!

148
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:24,813
Hey, thanks for sending
the invite back.

149
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,842
- Oh, sure. I'm excited.
- We're gonna have a blast.

150
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,117
- It's gonna be... are you coming?
- Eh...

151
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,249
- Tell me you're coming. Please.
- I don't know.

152
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:33,122
25 years of marriage!

153
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,561
- Rosie's coming.
- Rosie O'Donnell?

154
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:38,498
And I have Larry David's place card
right next to hers.

155
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:41,058
- Really? You're sitting me next to her?
- Right next to her.

156
00:06:41,102 --> 00:06:43,332
- You know Rosie O'Donnell?
- I know her from New York.

157
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,340
We used to hang out
together doing comedy.

158
00:06:45,374 --> 00:06:46,398
You'll have a great time.

159
00:06:46,442 --> 00:06:48,467
- Just send the invitation back, okay?
- Oh, thank you.

160
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,740
- I'll see you guys there. I'm excited.
- By the way,

161
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,804
- Jodie's really looking good.
- She does look great.

162
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:55,113
- Doesn't she look great?
- Oh, thanks a lot, yeah.

163
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:57,119
She's dating a guy.
I think it's serious.

164
00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:58,882
She's dating a guy?!

165
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:00,890
Yeah, she's no longer gay.

166
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:03,984
What? You're kidding!

167
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:05,996
That's fantastic!

168
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:08,157
Congratulations!
Good for you.

169
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:11,066
She's not a lesbian
anymore.

170
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:13,593
Oh my God.
Good going.

171
00:07:13,638 --> 00:07:15,698
All right,
I'll see you, uh, soon.

172
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,175
Yeah, I'll see you
at the party.

173
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:31,384
Larry, we need to talk.

174
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,753
It's over?

175
00:07:35,796 --> 00:07:37,525
What's over?

176
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,657
The marriage.

177
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:43,898
Why would our marriage
be over?

178
00:07:43,937 --> 00:07:45,906
You said,

179
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,874
"We need to talk."

180
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:50,810
Yeah, we need to talk about
Marty Funkhouser's party!

181
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,837
Oh, okay. I thought...

182
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:57,182
- eh, forget it.
- No no no, what did you think?

183
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,954
Well, you know, you said,
"We need to talk."

184
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:03,685
Generally,
when couples break up,

185
00:08:03,726 --> 00:08:05,922
that's how they introduce it, you know,
"We need to talk."

186
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:08,590
- So I just thought it was...
- Well, why would you...

187
00:08:08,632 --> 00:08:10,600
why would you
even think that?

188
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:13,262
Well, because women
have broken up with me many times,

189
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:15,328
and they've always introduced it with
"We need to talk."

190
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:18,171
So I'm just sort of conditioned
for that response.

191
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:20,905
And when women
broke up with you,

192
00:08:20,945 --> 00:08:22,776
did you light up
like that?

193
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:24,509
Light up?

194
00:08:24,549 --> 00:08:26,016
- Yeah.
- Did I light up?

195
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:28,349
"Oh, it's over?"

196
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:30,412
You know, it could have been
a defense mechanism.

197
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:33,118
That's how I react to things.
I go the other way,

198
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:36,720
so I don't get hurt.
I protect myself.

199
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,857
You understand. So what about the party?
Marty Funkhouser's party...

200
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:41,833
Have you been thinking
about this for a while?

201
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:44,234
No! Not at all!
No, of course not.

202
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,468
So what about
the Funkhouser party?

203
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:51,342
Well, I wanted to know
if we're going or not.

204
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:53,609
I need to send in
the RSVP and...

205
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:56,241
I wasn't going, and now
I've changed my mind.

206
00:08:56,283 --> 00:08:58,081
Rosie O'Donnell's
gonna be there.

207
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,611
Our table.

208
00:09:00,655 --> 00:09:02,486
And you know what else?

209
00:09:02,524 --> 00:09:05,322
I might wear a bow-tie.

210
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,989
- What do you think of that?
- You're gonna wear a bow-tie?

211
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,464
Are you loving that?
Is that fantastic?

212
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,468
How about that
for an idea, huh?

213
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:14,402
I, well...

214
00:09:14,437 --> 00:09:16,428
You're gonna love it.

215
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,737
- Well, look who's here.
- Wanda!

216
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:20,403
- Look who's here.
- How are you doing?

217
00:09:20,444 --> 00:09:22,344
Welcome!
This is our new house.

218
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:24,210
- What do you think?
- Well, what do you think?

219
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:25,943
- Oh, the rental house.
- This is a rental.

220
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:29,249
It's just for a few months
until the renovation's done. You know.

221
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:32,120
Shit, I mean, you're renting,
so I can be honest.

222
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:33,749
- Yeah, yeah.
- I don't like it.

223
00:09:33,792 --> 00:09:35,657
- Kinda cold, like a hotel.
- Yeah.

224
00:09:35,693 --> 00:09:38,128
A hotel? Hotels are good.
You know, there's a lot of activity

225
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:40,155
in the hotel lobby.
I think that's a good thing.

226
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:42,326
Why don't you put
a little bellman's cap on...

227
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:44,393
- Okay, I'll put a bellman's cap on.
...and run around.

228
00:09:44,437 --> 00:09:46,632
Put a little concierge desk
over there.

229
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:49,437
- Hey, Wanda, let me ask you a question.
- What?

230
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:51,501
Is it wrong to assume

231
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:55,538
that a black man wearing a bow-tie
is a Muslim?

232
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:57,813
Why are you asking me
some bullshit like that?

233
00:09:57,852 --> 00:09:59,285
What the fuck, Larry?!

234
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,845
I'm not your link
into the black world, okay?

235
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:05,222
So stop asking me shit about black
people and stuff, all right?

236
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,124
Okay, but let me
ask you this:

237
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:10,757
Have you ever seen
a black man wearing a bow-tie

238
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,734
- who's not a Muslim?
- Who gives a fuck?

239
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:15,100
It's just something
you may have observed.

240
00:10:15,137 --> 00:10:16,900
- Have you observed...
- Larry, I don't...

241
00:10:16,939 --> 00:10:19,568
- Have you ever observed a black man...
- Larry, I don't...

242
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,839
...who's not a Muslim wearing
a bow-tie? That's all.

243
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:24,142
You think Farrakhan
went out and bought up

244
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,477
all the bow-ties
or something?

245
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:27,278
He's sitting there
holding on to bow-ties

246
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:29,616
and only Muslims get 'em?
What the fuck, Larry?

247
00:10:29,653 --> 00:10:31,678
You... what... no.
I don't know.

248
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:33,121
Fair enough.
Good answer.

249
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:35,125
"I don't know."
I totally accept it.

250
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,252
- I got the dog.
- That's what I want to see.

251
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:39,490
- You've got to see him. Sheriff!
- Sheriff!

252
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:42,523
- Hello boy!
- He's a cutie!

253
00:10:46,071 --> 00:10:49,371
- What the hell...
- I think it's you, Wanda.

254
00:10:49,408 --> 00:10:51,968
- One of y'all wanna grab Cujo?
- Um...

255
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:55,712
Come on, it's just Wanda.
It's just Wanda.

256
00:10:55,748 --> 00:10:58,308
I'm sorry.
He's very friendly.

257
00:10:59,353 --> 00:11:01,719
We're all done in there.

258
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:04,189
Just, uh, you have to wait
overnight for the...

259
00:11:04,224 --> 00:11:06,158
hey! Hey, little buddy.
Come here.

260
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:07,660
What's wrong
with your dog?

261
00:11:07,694 --> 00:11:09,595
I don't know.
See how friendly he is?

262
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:12,225
Good dog!
He probably smells my dog.

263
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,331
- Hey! Shit!
- Oh my God!

264
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,034
- God!
- Hey, come on!

265
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:20,701
Get over here.

266
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,711
- What's with...
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

267
00:11:22,745 --> 00:11:24,736
What did you do?

268
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:28,813
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

269
00:11:28,851 --> 00:11:30,649
I don't know
what's going on.

270
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,383
- I've never seen him like this.
- I'm really sorry.

271
00:11:33,423 --> 00:11:36,256
- You know what's going on.
- Huh?

272
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:38,261
You have a racist dog!

273
00:11:38,295 --> 00:11:40,355
- That dog hates black people.
- Wanda.

274
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,195
Larry, you trained the dog
to hate black people?

275
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,258
No, I didn't train it
to hate black people.

276
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:46,270
Has it barked
at any white people?

277
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,272
No, he's... he's...

278
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:50,070
He hasn't barked
at any white people.

279
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:52,303
Exactly.
The dog is racist.

280
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,039
Sheriff's racist?

281
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,706
Sheriff?!

282
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,544
That's a perfect name
for a racist dog.

283
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,917
Where did you get this dog,
the Klan meeting or something?

284
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:03,650
- Larry picked him out at the pound.
- The pound.

285
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,022
Sheriff the fucking dog
that eats black people.

286
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,391
What the fuck, man?
I'll tell you what,

287
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:11,330
y'all stay here
and pet your crazy-ass racist dog,

288
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:13,458
but I am not bringing
my black ass

289
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,900
back up into this
fucking hotel

290
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:18,666
until y'all get rid
of that fucking Klan dog.

291
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:21,574
Got a Klan dog!

292
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,044
Looking at me
like I'm a damn T-bone.

293
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,479
- I'll call you.
- Aw, shut up.

294
00:12:38,227 --> 00:12:40,389
So we have three choices.

295
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,660
I'm sorry, the first
that we have is

296
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,394
a skirt steak...

297
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:48,871
Look, I can't...
I can't hear you.

298
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:50,931
I can't hear. Could you repeat that?
What's that?

299
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:52,943
It's a skirt steak, sir,
or stir fry,

300
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:55,605
uh, and that's...

301
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:01,844
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

302
00:13:01,887 --> 00:13:04,412
Excuse me, could you just
keep it down a little bit?

303
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:06,253
We can't hear the waiter.
We're trying to order.

304
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,316
- Keep it down?
- We're trying to hear the waiter.

305
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,353
I'm trying to have a good time with my
family over here. Know what I mean?

306
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,059
I'm not keeping it down.
I'm sorry,

307
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:16,626
we need to keep it down
for Tucker Carlson over here.

308
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,104
"Keep it down"!

309
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:24,271
- Tucker Carlson?
- Tucker Carlson.

310
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,576
There's a chicken rotisserie

311
00:13:27,615 --> 00:13:30,641
and a portobello
mushroom salad.

312
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,154
- Salad?
- Yeah, well the portobello

313
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,418
is cut up
onto mixed greens.

314
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,391
- Are you a vegetarian?
- Yeah, it depends.

315
00:13:41,431 --> 00:13:43,262
- She is.
- Yeah.

316
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,961
So that would sort of be the best
choice. It's really good.

317
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:48,937
I'm gonna get the skirt steak.
Want me to order for you?

318
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:51,064
- What do you want?
- Get me the chicken.

319
00:13:51,107 --> 00:13:53,076
Excuse me.

320
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,772
Uh, I'll have
the portobello, yeah.

321
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:58,543
- Hey, Sue.
- What?

322
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:00,550
What's with the snub?

323
00:14:00,584 --> 00:14:02,553
Oh, come on, Larry.

324
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,316
You're acting
like you don't know?

325
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,323
What?
I don't know why...

326
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:07,949
What?
What did I do?

327
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:10,222
All right, let me
give you a clue, okay?

328
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:12,753
Starts with a "J"
and it ends with an "I."

329
00:14:14,366 --> 00:14:15,458
Jedi?

330
00:14:15,501 --> 00:14:17,435
- You know...
- What?

331
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,698
It's Jodi, okay?

332
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,603
Wh-what did you hear?

333
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,006
Well, I heard that you
just got so excited,

334
00:14:23,043 --> 00:14:25,739
like you were so happy
that she wasn't with women anymore.

335
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:27,542
- That's ridiculous.
- It's not ridiculous.

336
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:30,175
- I was happy for him.
- I don't know what's happened to you.

337
00:14:30,217 --> 00:14:33,210
I wasn't really happy for him,
I was pretending I was happy for him.

338
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:35,950
- Oh really?
- But that's all. I was just pretending.

339
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,981
- No no no no.
- No, I wasn't sincere.

340
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,424
I wasn't sincerely excited.

341
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,485
- You're not being sincere now.
- No, now I'm being sincere.

342
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:45,091
You know, the lesbian community
used to revere you.

343
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,830
- You used to be such a liberal guy.
- I'm liberal.

344
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,861
- No, you're not liberal.
- I am liberal.

345
00:14:49,905 --> 00:14:52,066
Look what you look like.
Look at the bow-tie.

346
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:54,508
The bow-tie... I just tried out
a bow-tie, so what?

347
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,876
Excuse me, excuse me.
You know what? I'm sorry.

348
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:59,211
Don't even waste your time
talking to this man.

349
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:00,910
This man is a racist.

350
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,419
He has a racist dog.

351
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:05,854
He has a dog
that attacks black people.

352
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:09,718
Okay, I do...
the dog is racist.

353
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,559
- But I didn't train him to be racist.
- Larry, forget about it.

354
00:15:12,597 --> 00:15:14,189
How do you know that?

355
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:16,223
Because we talk, Larry.

356
00:15:23,376 --> 00:15:25,936
Are you having fun
or what?

357
00:15:25,978 --> 00:15:27,741
What did you tell Jodi?

358
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,806
I told her you were just maybe
a little overjoyous

359
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:32,910
at the fact that she
was dating a boy.

360
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,080
- That's all I said.
- All the lesbians hate me now.

361
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:37,056
- Oh, so it's my fault?
- Yes it is!

362
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,614
You celebrated!

363
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:40,490
I was pretending to be happy
for your benefit.

364
00:15:40,527 --> 00:15:42,290
- I don't need benefit!
- You need benefit!

365
00:15:42,329 --> 00:15:44,093
- What do I need benefit for?
- You need benefit.

366
00:15:44,132 --> 00:15:47,067
I'm happy if Jodi's happy.
You're overblowing this whole thing.

367
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,932
- I don't think so.
- We're at a party.

368
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,801
I don't like being
snubbed by lesbians.

369
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,830
- It's their prerogative.
- I'm their biggest supporter.

370
00:15:52,874 --> 00:15:54,934
- You're their biggest supporter?
- Yes I am!

371
00:15:54,977 --> 00:15:57,002
Well, they're in trouble then.

372
00:15:57,046 --> 00:15:58,980
By the way,
where's Rosie O'Donnell?

373
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:01,005
She's not here yet.

374
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,711
Sure you invited her?

375
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,219
She'll be here.

376
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,781
- When?
- Soon.

377
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,831
Okay.

378
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:29,578
Dan, Danny, come over here.
I want you to meet somebody.

379
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,845
This is Jodi's new boyfriend.
This is Larry David.

380
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:33,715
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you doing?

381
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:36,153
- Have a good time.
- Okay.

382
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:37,986
Hey, by the way,
you and Jodi...

383
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:40,754
- fantastic, great news.
- Yeah, yeah.

384
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:42,522
- Pretty good.
- Yes it is indeed.

385
00:16:42,562 --> 00:16:44,531
Pretty, pretty,

386
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:47,193
pretty, pretty good.

387
00:16:48,369 --> 00:16:49,700
- Yeah.
- Terrific.

388
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:51,705
And to have to overcome

389
00:16:51,739 --> 00:16:53,707
the whole situation,

390
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,471
the whole sexual thing,
you know?

391
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,411
Oh. Oh, there's nothing
to overcome, really.

392
00:16:58,446 --> 00:17:01,381
Well, you know, the fact that she's been
with women before you.

393
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:04,716
- I know...
- I'd be really intimidated by that,

394
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:07,052
- because, you know, we really...
- Intimidated?

395
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,920
Well, because we don't know
what we're doing

396
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,153
as much as the women know.
You know, it's their equipment.

397
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:14,356
They own the equipment,
so they know what to do with it.

398
00:17:14,397 --> 00:17:16,263
You know what's
going on down there?

399
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,167
- I don't have any idea.
- I'd like to think I do.

400
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:22,865
That whole area is so
mysterious to me, you know?

401
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:25,432
- I'm just saying it's...
- Well, I mean...

402
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,603
I'd be intimidated,
I know that.

403
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:32,878
Yeah.

404
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,721
I always wondered, do you walk around
in your bikini at home?

405
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,697
The way he talks,
you'd think that he's got...

406
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,791
Hey. I think I want
to go home.

407
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,802
Let's go home.

408
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,531
No, we haven't even
had dessert yet.

409
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,664
So what? We don't need dessert.
Come on.

410
00:17:53,707 --> 00:17:55,437
Well, it's rude.
You stay for dessert.

411
00:17:55,476 --> 00:17:57,876
- Then you can go.
- So what, dessert? It's no big deal.

412
00:17:57,912 --> 00:18:01,575
- We can just go. Come on.
- Why do you want to go home?

413
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,742
I need to use
the bathroom.

414
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,987
- So go use the bathroom.
- I don't want to use this bathroom.

415
00:18:08,023 --> 00:18:09,354
- I want my own...
- Why?

416
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:11,757
This project demands
I get back to my base.

417
00:18:11,793 --> 00:18:13,658
I need my base.

418
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,664
- We're not going home...
- What's the matter?

419
00:18:15,698 --> 00:18:17,666
- Larry wants to go home...
- What...

420
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,600
to use the bathroom.
It's like...

421
00:18:19,635 --> 00:18:21,728
Cheryl, you need to tell
the whole table?

422
00:18:21,771 --> 00:18:24,171
- Why don't you make an announcement?
- Hold on here.

423
00:18:24,207 --> 00:18:26,642
You've never done that with me at lunch?
It's the craziest thing.

424
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:29,475
It's ridiculous.
He can use this bathroom.

425
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:31,708
- That's what everybody...
- You're a gentile.

426
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:34,183
You'll go in the middle of Fifth Avenue.
It's different for Jews.

427
00:18:34,218 --> 00:18:36,312
- No, you're at an affair.
- What?

428
00:18:36,354 --> 00:18:38,754
You cannot leave an affair before
the dessert is served.

429
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,020
What is this dessert thing?
We don't have to leave after.

430
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:43,050
- We can leave before dessert.
- Better to leave after.

431
00:18:43,094 --> 00:18:45,085
No, you do not leave
before dessert.

432
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,928
Who made this up?
Where's this rule?

433
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:49,560
Everybody here seems to know,
but the rules don't apply to you?

434
00:18:49,602 --> 00:18:51,900
What am I supposed to do?
Sit here for four hours

435
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:53,529
and be uncomfortable?

436
00:18:53,572 --> 00:18:54,937
Should I go clean it for you
before you go in there?

437
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:57,102
- It's not even the cleanliness.
- Okay, just go.

438
00:18:57,144 --> 00:18:59,874
We don't need to talk
about your bathroom...

439
00:18:59,913 --> 00:19:02,040
- so just go.
- You're the one who's telling everybody

440
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:03,982
- in the whole place!
- Just go!

441
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,605
Hey, where do you think you're going,
pal? What are you doing?

442
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,600
I'm going to the bathroom.

443
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:31,011
- That's a handicapped stall.
- We're waiting in line.

444
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:33,777
I have a stutter,

445
00:19:33,817 --> 00:19:36,183
you pricks!

446
00:19:36,219 --> 00:19:38,882
Stutter my ass!
That's for people who can't walk.

447
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:41,448
Oh, all right, fine, okay.

448
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:43,892
Oh, your stutter's gone,
jackass!

449
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:46,328
- Give me a fucking break, asshole.
- Stupid ass.

450
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,396
All right, that sounds good.

451
00:19:49,434 --> 00:19:52,062
All right, I'll see you
in about 10-15 minutes.

452
00:19:52,104 --> 00:19:54,038
All right, great.
Hey.

453
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,540
- I'll see you in a few hours.
- Huh? Few hours?

454
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,941
- Yeah.
- Where are you going?

455
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,945
I'm meeting Julie.

456
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,470
- Don't forget to take the dog out.
- Hello.

457
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:05,712
Out? What do you mean?
Out for a walk or out with me?

458
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,310
Hello, Mr. David.

459
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:10,255
- This is Omar Jones.
- Oh, hi.

460
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,726
I gotta tell you, Mr. David,
I was thinking about taking the case,

461
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,250
but I got a distressing
call today

462
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:17,321
about your behavior
last night at the banquet.

463
00:20:17,365 --> 00:20:19,333
What are you
talking about?

464
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,198
According to one
of the brothers, you said,

465
00:20:21,236 --> 00:20:23,363
"Keep it down."

466
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:25,634
No no, all that happened was
I was trying to order

467
00:20:25,673 --> 00:20:27,938
and I couldn't hear the waiter
because some of your brothers

468
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,275
were making too much noise
at the next table, that's all.

469
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,712
How do you even know
about this?

470
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:35,444
We talk, Mr. David.
We talk.

471
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,454
- Huh.
- And what about my bathroom key?

472
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:40,752
I'm really sorry about that.
I'm returning it today, I promise.

473
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,985
Well, like I said,
I'm gonna have to think about it.

474
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:45,460
Thank you.

475
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,207
How was everything?

476
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:58,766
- Pretty good.
- Great.

477
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,335
Do you want coffee,
dessert, on the house?

478
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,972
- On the house?
- Yeah.

479
00:21:03,015 --> 00:21:05,745
I'll have a cupcake.

480
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:07,752
- I'll take a dessert on the house.
- Okay.

481
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:10,915
- Fabulous. Thank you.
- Are those new glasses?

482
00:21:10,957 --> 00:21:13,016
No, I just cleaned them.

483
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,050
It's nice
to have you back, Larry.

484
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:21,093
You, my friend, are back
in the lesbian bosom.

485
00:21:40,623 --> 00:21:42,386
Wow.

486
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:44,916
- I'm back.
- You are back.

487
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:47,088
By the looks of things,
better than ever.

488
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:52,031
But what... I wonder
what turned it around.

489
00:21:54,738 --> 00:21:57,935
Oh dear. Uh-oh.

490
00:21:57,975 --> 00:21:59,910
What?

491
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:02,037
- What does Funkhouser want?
- I don't know.

492
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,514
I'll be right back.
How did he even know I was here?

493
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:10,021
What did you say to Dan?

494
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:12,615
What did l...
hello, boy.

495
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:15,286
- Did you meet Sheriff, my dog?
- No, I didn't.

496
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:18,785
I said, "Dan, this is Larry David."
Then I left you.

497
00:22:18,831 --> 00:22:20,925
- And I said hi, I said hello.
- Yeah, yeah.

498
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,663
- I said, "Hi, Dan."
- Yeah, what else?

499
00:22:23,703 --> 00:22:26,729
You know, a little small talk,
"Hi, how are you doing?

500
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:29,402
- Where are you from?" and all that.
- That's it?

501
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:31,343
And then, what did
I say? I said,

502
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:35,372
"It must be hard,
as a guy, to follow..."

503
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,385
Why didn't you just say,
"Hello, I'm Larry. Nice to meet you"?

504
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:40,479
I said that after hi.
I said hi, then I said that.

505
00:22:40,522 --> 00:22:43,514
- What is wrong with you?
- Problem?

506
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:45,992
Yeah, problem.
Now she's back with a woman.

507
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:50,760
No wonder why they're all being
so nice to me in there.

508
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,792
They're all smiling at me.
Of course, it makes perfect sense.

509
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:55,929
- I want to say something else.
- Uh-huh.

510
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:58,270
You left my party
before dessert!

511
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:00,277
How can you do that?!

512
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:02,245
It's not proper etiquette!

513
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,215
I don't subscribe
to the wait-for-dessert rule

514
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,547
before you can leave a party.

515
00:23:07,584 --> 00:23:10,782
Yeah, no one cares
what you subscribe to, okay?

516
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:14,053
We were trying to recreate
what happened 25 years ago,

517
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,425
and I said, "Larry, would you like
to make a toast?"

518
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,953
And someone said,
"Larry went home to take a shit."

519
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,627
Ah.

520
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,865
You stay here.
Okay, boy?

521
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:32,469
You stay, Sheriff.

522
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,781
- Hey!
- Hey, Larry.

523
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:44,587
- Hey, hi!
- How are you?

524
00:23:44,625 --> 00:23:46,593
- Great.
- Good to see you.

525
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,595
Hey, by the way,
I don't know

526
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:52,225
if you heard anything
about what's been going on...

527
00:23:52,267 --> 00:23:55,464
- Come on, I heard. I'm in the loop.
- Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah.

528
00:23:55,504 --> 00:23:57,472
It's all right, though.
I don't think you should

529
00:23:57,506 --> 00:23:59,371
worry about it. Just...
it's all good now.

530
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:01,707
You know, what happened
that day was

531
00:24:01,745 --> 00:24:03,679
I just got a little excited,
but not...

532
00:24:03,713 --> 00:24:06,113
Hey hey hey hey, Larr.
I stood up at the meeting,

533
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:07,946
I told everybody,
"I know the guy."

534
00:24:07,984 --> 00:24:09,645
I vouched for you.
You're all right.

535
00:24:09,686 --> 00:24:12,383
- You're something, you know that?
- Come on, come on!

536
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:14,288
- It all worked out, right?
- It's great.

537
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:17,761
- She's happy, we're happy, you know?
- Fantastic.

538
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:20,787
She's back on the team. Everything's
good. Don't even think about it.

539
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,800
- Fantastic.
- All right.

540
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:24,096
- Hey.
- Yeah.

541
00:24:24,136 --> 00:24:25,967
You know, we missed you
at Funkhouser's party.

542
00:24:26,004 --> 00:24:28,199
The what?

543
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,401
Marty Funkhouser's
25th anniversary party.

544
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:33,344
- Oh, Jodi's dad?
- Yeah.

545
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:35,745
Yeah, I don't really
know him. No.

546
00:24:35,782 --> 00:24:39,411
- You weren't invited to that?
- Nope, no no no.

547
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:42,047
Was it good?
Did you go?

548
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:44,751
- Yeah, yeah, I went.
- Yeah, it was good?

549
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:46,692
And don't worry
about that other thing.

550
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:49,924
I just want you to know,
gone, like it never happened.

551
00:24:49,963 --> 00:24:52,228
- Okay? Like it never happened.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

552
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:53,996
- All the lesbians love you.
- Okay, love you.

553
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,297
- I love you back.
- Love you.

554
00:24:55,336 --> 00:24:57,566
I love you.
Everyone loves you. All of us.

555
00:25:09,318 --> 00:25:10,876
You are a Muslim!

556
00:25:12,422 --> 00:25:14,413
Go, pray, pray.

557
00:25:20,564 --> 00:25:22,032
Let me ask you something.

558
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:24,534
Are brothers and sisters
a little overly sensitive

559
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:26,332
to being told
to keep it down?

560
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,668
Because I know in the movies
you guys tend to make

561
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:30,799
a lot of noise sometimes.
Am I right?

562
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:34,210
'Cause that's kind of
what happened at the party.

563
00:25:34,246 --> 00:25:36,214
What, did l...

564
00:25:36,248 --> 00:25:37,875
No, go back.

565
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:40,578
Did I interrupt the praying?
I'm sorry.

566
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,815
- Don't worry about it.
- All right.

567
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:45,051
- Listen, Mr. David...
- Look at the way you fold that up.

568
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:46,683
It's like a yoga mat, huh?

569
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:48,193
I just want you to know

570
00:25:48,228 --> 00:25:51,288
that Muslims are
a very forgiving people.

571
00:25:51,331 --> 00:25:53,300
They are?

572
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:56,235
- Yes we are. We're very forgiving.
- Really? Huh.

573
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,204
- Well, it's true.
- There's a lot

574
00:25:58,239 --> 00:26:01,208
of meshugana Muslims,
though, running around, are there not?

575
00:26:01,242 --> 00:26:03,473
Being that we are a forgiving people,
I have decided

576
00:26:03,512 --> 00:26:05,503
to take on your case.

577
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:09,878
But I'm gonna have
to charge you

578
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:12,148
a higher rate
than I charge most people.

579
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:14,713
Well, whatever you have
to do.

580
00:26:14,757 --> 00:26:17,248
- You're gonna take the case?
- I'm gonna take the case.

581
00:26:17,293 --> 00:26:19,056
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

582
00:26:19,095 --> 00:26:20,960
Do Muslims shake?

583
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,989
- Yes, we do.
- You do?

584
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,500
- Yes, we do.
- Great.

585
00:26:24,535 --> 00:26:26,503
To tell you the truth,

586
00:26:26,537 --> 00:26:28,505
I'm very excited
about this.

587
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:30,507
The whole adoption thing...

588
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:32,873
I mean, this could be
a huge thing for me.

589
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:34,606
All right, Mr. David.

590
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:36,580
Oh, guess what.

591
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:38,582
Bathroom key.

592
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:40,584
You know what?

593
00:26:40,618 --> 00:26:44,055
I gotta go again.
I'm so sorry.

594
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:46,319
All right.

595
00:27:11,052 --> 00:27:13,783
Well, looky here!

596
00:27:13,822 --> 00:27:16,120
Look what's doing here!

597
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,060
Aren't you supposed
to be in here?

598
00:27:20,095 --> 00:27:22,029
It seems to me you're
using the wrong toilet.

599
00:27:22,064 --> 00:27:24,795
Somebody was in there.
I had to use the normal one.

600
00:27:24,834 --> 00:27:26,802
Really?
First of all,

601
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:29,930
we don't like to be referred
to as "normal," okay?

602
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:33,238
We're "able-bodied."
"Able-bodied," not "normal."

603
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,142
That's like from the '80s.
Who doesn't know that?

604
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:37,909
I had to go to the bathroom.
Somebody was in there.

605
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:39,916
Well, then you wait.

606
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,941
You wait.

607
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:54,226
All right, Sheriff!

608
00:27:55,234 --> 00:27:57,759
Okay, good boy!
Good boy.

609
00:27:57,803 --> 00:27:59,430
Mr. David.

610
00:27:59,472 --> 00:28:01,440
My bathroom key.

611
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:15,983
Hey, nice dog.

612
00:28:16,024 --> 00:28:18,788
No, don't!

613
00:28:18,826 --> 00:28:22,023
I love dogs.
I have a couple of my own.

614
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:25,290
All right,
just give me my key.

615
00:28:25,334 --> 00:28:27,029
Oh, I can't believe
I forgot.

616
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:29,902
Hopefully we won't have to keep going
through the same thing.

617
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:32,065
I'm sorry. Won't happen again.
Won't happen again.

618
00:28:33,676 --> 00:28:36,441
- Nice dog.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

619
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:39,415
Hey!

620
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:42,111
Good boy, good boy!
Yeah!

621
00:28:42,152 --> 00:28:43,779
Oh, look!

622
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,584
You got yourself
a doggie!

623
00:28:50,194 --> 00:28:52,185
Sorry.
