1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000


2
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:26,130
I'm drowning.

3
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,640
I'm gonna die.

4
00:01:27,674 --> 00:01:30,369
And somewhere...
I'm not religious at all...

5
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:31,842
I said, "God, help me!"

6
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:35,367
And I'm deposited
right on the beach.

7
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:37,606
- Oh my golly.
- I went swimming that day

8
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:40,206
for some reason. Something drew
me to the water.

9
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:42,238
Why? I don't know.

10
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:45,911
I was like a baby
drawn to the nipple.

11
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:48,749
You know?
Or an adult drawn to the nipple.

12
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:50,447
Either way, right?

13
00:01:50,488 --> 00:01:53,251
- You know what I think?
- Is that divine intervention?

14
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,416
- Unbelievable.
- Is that not divine intervention?

15
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,687
- You know what I think?
- Huh?

16
00:01:57,726 --> 00:01:59,989
- I think this happened for a reason.
- Yes!

17
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,688
Yes, I think so too.
It happened for a reason.

18
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,662
Maybe you'll start
to be more respectful to people,

19
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,129
- treat people better.
- I'm respectful to people.

20
00:02:08,164 --> 00:02:10,597
- Eh, Larry, eh-heh.
- What? "Eh-heh"?

21
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,758
- Fine. Whatever.
- I respect people.

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,665
- I'm very nice to people.
- Yeah, fine.

23
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:17,067
So, anyway, huh?
Amazing?

24
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:19,401
- Is that amazing?
- Awesome.

25
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:21,200
True story,
every word!

26
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,934
To life! L'chaim!

27
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:26,271
- Yeah!
- To life!

28
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:27,935
Every day is a gift.

29
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:33,074
Are you going
to temple for the High Holy Days?

30
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:35,239
- Of course.
- I want to go to temple this year.

31
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,644
- You do?
- Well, yeah.

32
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:39,205
Given what happened,
don't you think I should?

33
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:41,216
Yeah, it's a great thing,
but you've got

34
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,547
to get your ticket
six months in advance.

35
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:45,280
It's a tough ticket
to go to High Holy Days.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,344
Why do you need a ticket
to go to temple? It's crazy!

37
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,354
I'm not saying
I justify it,

38
00:02:49,388 --> 00:02:52,015
but you need a ticket,
and I've got my tickets.

39
00:02:52,057 --> 00:02:53,683
How am I gonna get one?

40
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:56,214
Um...

41
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,159
You know what?
I'll make some calls,

42
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,559
and if I hook one up
I call you tonight.

43
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:03,324
- Okay.
- We'll see.

44
00:03:03,363 --> 00:03:04,989
Look at this thing.

45
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,429
You ever see a handle like this
on a cup? What's the point?

46
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:09,489
- It looks like a pretend teacup.
- Look.

47
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,433
You can't get your index finger
in there. What's the point?

48
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:14,594
I like watching you
do that.

49
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:17,069
There was something I want
to tell you... oh!

50
00:03:17,104 --> 00:03:18,593
I went by Leo's
Delicatessen.

51
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:20,128
You know what's
up on the board?

52
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,663
A brand new sandwich
called the "Larry David."

53
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:24,834
- What? Get out of here.
- Swear to God.

54
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:26,502
Swear to God.

55
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:29,067
Leo named a sandwich after me?
You're kidding!

56
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:31,510
- Yep yep yep.
- I can't believe it. I'm on the board?

57
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:32,910
You're on the board.

58
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,812
- What is it?
- Let's see, um...

59
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,475
There's whitefish,
uh, sable,

60
00:03:38,517 --> 00:03:41,610
- uh, capers, onions and cream cheese.
- What? What?

61
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:43,915
- That's the sandwich?
- Yeah.

62
00:03:43,953 --> 00:03:47,614
- You've got a sandwich!
- That's a disgusting sandwich! Really?

63
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:50,282
All right, I'm gonna get
something to eat.

64
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:53,052
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Okay. Look at this.

65
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:56,816
- Sorry.
- Oh, boy.

66
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,520
Oh my gosh.
Oh, what happened?

67
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:01,051
He bumped me.

68
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:03,188
- Did you bump into him?
- No.

69
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,891
You bumped into me.

70
00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:07,593
- You didn't bump into me?
- Larr, please.

71
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:15,530
- What happened?
- Oh, nothing.

72
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,505
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, you ready?

73
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,336
- Hey.
- What?

74
00:04:20,374 --> 00:04:22,864
- We're gonna take off.
- What? We carpooled with you.

75
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,138
- I'm not ready to leave yet.
- It's enough already.

76
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:27,144
Larry, what the fuck?
I'm having fun.

77
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:28,975
- Jeff, they want to go.
- We want to go.

78
00:04:29,013 --> 00:04:31,003
- You want to go? We carpooled.
- We want to go.

79
00:04:31,047 --> 00:04:32,513
We're not ready
to leave, Jeff.

80
00:04:32,548 --> 00:04:34,515
- He just got his food.
- You'll get a ride.

81
00:04:34,549 --> 00:04:36,743
- If don't get a ride give me a call.
- Fine!

82
00:04:36,783 --> 00:04:39,250
- You'll be hearing from us.
- Yeah, you'll come back and get us.

83
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,808
- I'll come back.
- I believe that.

84
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:45,348
Oh, Larry.

85
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,447
Call me Mr. Tibbs.

86
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,889
Ooh, Larry.

87
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,657
Don't answer that.

88
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:02,755
Actually, that might be Jeff calling
about the temple tickets.

89
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:05,527
- I don't care.
- Huh?

90
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:08,296
- I don't care.
- This is kind of important.

91
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,961
He'll call back.

92
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:12,993
Because I told him
to try and find out. Hello?

93
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:14,800
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

94
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,602
Made some calls,
but no go on the tickets.

95
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,903
- Oh, what a bummer!
- Yeah.

96
00:05:19,942 --> 00:05:21,465
I'm sorry,
but you know what?

97
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:23,840
You can always try
for a scalper.

98
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:25,504
Really? They got
scalper tickets?

99
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:27,171
- They usually do.
- Huh.

100
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:29,203
- Yeah.
- Expensive?

101
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:30,838
I have no idea.

102
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,371
All right, I'll get
some scalper tickets.

103
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,576
Get some scalper tickets.

104
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,174
We'll just go down there
and try to get some.

105
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:39,050
- Yeah.
- Thanks for trying.

106
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:42,110
Sure, man. I'll talk
to you later. Bye.

107
00:05:43,322 --> 00:05:45,551
- Get off!
- What?

108
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,614
- Get off of me!
- What are you doing?

109
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:49,886
What am I doing?!
What are you doing?!

110
00:05:49,925 --> 00:05:51,892
What?

111
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:53,757
What's the big deal?
What?

112
00:05:53,795 --> 00:05:55,591
Why did you have
to answer the phone?

113
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,153
'Cause I told you
I was expecting a call.

114
00:05:58,197 --> 00:06:00,027
Why? So what?
I don't know.

115
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:01,497
Jesus.

116
00:06:01,532 --> 00:06:03,465
Good night.

117
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,762
Oh, right.

118
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,701
Mustn't interrupt
intercourse.

119
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:10,897
Oh, sacred intercourse
cannot be interrupted.

120
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,530
Oh, everybody quiet.

121
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,198
Quiet for intercourse.

122
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,265
Shh! Don't disturb
the intercourse.

123
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:23,811
I'll tell you something.

124
00:06:23,845 --> 00:06:26,312
This is some kind
of sandwich, my friend.

125
00:06:26,347 --> 00:06:28,644
It's the first time
I really kvelled...

126
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:30,147
really swelled up
with joy.

127
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,116
Look at that.
Larry David sandwich.

128
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,844
I really kvell
from this.

129
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:37,512
It's something that makes me prouder
than anything.

130
00:06:37,553 --> 00:06:39,884
Ah, all right, all right.
I don't even like it.

131
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:42,218
- What?
- I don't like it.

132
00:06:42,256 --> 00:06:45,690
All right, whatever
you said just now,

133
00:06:45,724 --> 00:06:48,851
you mumbled it,
which is something you do a lot.

134
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:50,723
- You do a lot of mumbling.
- Okay.

135
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,957
You don't have a lot
of respect for speech.

136
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,123
You could speak
a little clearer.

137
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:59,654
It wouldn't hurt anybody.
You're laughing in my face.

138
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:01,723
I don't have respect
for speech?

139
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:04,098
- Yes, sir.
- I do! I respect speech!

140
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:05,567
- Yes!
- I disagree!

141
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:08,001
- Aha! Look who's here!
- Hey, Leo!

142
00:07:08,037 --> 00:07:10,061
How're you doing?

143
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:12,572
So good to see you!

144
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:15,904
Oh, and Mr. David, too!

145
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:17,875
How are you, sir?

146
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,674
- Fine fine.
- Huh? Yeah!

147
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:23,144
Leo!

148
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:26,044
First of all,
I want to thank you...

149
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,513
for putting me up
on the board...

150
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,674
having my own sandwich!

151
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:34,746
Larry David sandwich,
huh?

152
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:37,379
Will you look
how proud he is.

153
00:07:37,421 --> 00:07:40,650
No problem! It is my pleasure to put
the Larry David sandwich

154
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,213
- up on the board.
- It's such a wonderful thing.

155
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:45,053
You like it, yeah?
You like it?

156
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,615
Eh!

157
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,854
- What is this "eh"?
- Eh.

158
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:50,656
You know...

159
00:07:50,695 --> 00:07:52,355
I'm not really a big...

160
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,693
I'm not really a big fish guy
to tell you the truth.

161
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,254
This is the best whitefish
in the whole wide world.

162
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,425
No other place got
this whitefish but me.

163
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:03,764
I'm sure it is, but I'm more of a
pastrami, corned beef kind of guy.

164
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:06,736
Can I get a pastrami,
corned beef thing?

165
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:09,466
You are
the whitefish-sable period.

166
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,666
- What do you want me to do?
- What about tongue?

167
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:14,470
No tongue!

168
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,271
Hey, let me ask you this,
okay?

169
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:19,676
What if I got somebody

170
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,770
to switch sandwiches
with me?

171
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:24,678
- To switch with you?
- Yeah, maybe, you know...

172
00:08:24,714 --> 00:08:27,341
uh, Ted Danson,
or something.

173
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,576
What do you think
about that?

174
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:31,777
Okay, I tell you what
I'm going to do for you.

175
00:08:31,818 --> 00:08:34,081
If the Mr. Danson say okay,

176
00:08:34,119 --> 00:08:35,814
okay, then switch.

177
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:38,083
- Okay.
- If I can do it, I can do it.

178
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:40,589
- I'll see you at temple.
- Okay.

179
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,258
Jesus, that guy...

180
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:47,658
almost broke my hand
with that shake.

181
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,889
- Don't whisper to me.
- I said he almost

182
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,953
broke my hand
with that handshake!

183
00:08:51,997 --> 00:08:54,829
You know, most of the time
once in awhile

184
00:08:54,865 --> 00:08:57,332
if you're...

185
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:59,698
if you're pleasant
to people...

186
00:08:59,735 --> 00:09:01,668
you... you...

187
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:06,167
What's the matter?

188
00:09:06,205 --> 00:09:09,139
Take a drink of water.

189
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,038
Take some water.

190
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:17,468
It's okay, Pop.

191
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,273
Everything's gonna be
all right.

192
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:20,973
I've got your glasses.

193
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:40,556
Well, your dad has
had a mild stroke.

194
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:43,616
- Really?
- Yes. He's gonna be fine.

195
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,150
He's gonna be fine.
I've got him lightly sedated

196
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:47,957
and he's resting.

197
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:50,896
He's doing very well
and it's nothing for you to worry about.

198
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,795
- Okay.
- Absolutely.

199
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:55,299
My feeling is we may do
a little corrective surgery.

200
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,426
I don't know
exactly when,

201
00:09:58,469 --> 00:10:00,231
but we'll have him here
for awhile.

202
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,736
Let me ask you
a question.

203
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:05,068
My dad and I were
eating in the deli...

204
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,630
- Mm-hmm.
- Earlier, and um...

205
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,039
Actually, they named
a sandwich after me.

206
00:10:11,075 --> 00:10:14,475
- No kidding?
- I've got my own sandwich.

207
00:10:14,511 --> 00:10:16,603
- That is great.
- I'm up on the board.

208
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,612
The Larry David.
If you go in there...

209
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:21,705
I've see that on the menu...
everybody's got their sandwich.

210
00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:25,410
But the bad news is that I can stand
the sandwich, between you and me.

211
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,042
What is it?

212
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,984
I see you recoiled.
Was it a breath thing?

213
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,181
- No, not at all.
- I noticed you put your head back.

214
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:34,313
- But anyway, here's my question.
- Okay.

215
00:10:34,355 --> 00:10:36,323
Is it possible

216
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:38,654
that the sandwich

217
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:42,820
could've had something
to do with the stroke?

218
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,953
If the sandwich
was caught...

219
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:47,155
and he started choking
and couldn't breathe

220
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:49,629
and then became fearful,
I guess it's possible.

221
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:51,824
You know, it could raise
his blood pressure.

222
00:10:51,866 --> 00:10:53,992
His life is not threatened.
He's fine and he's resting.

223
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:57,059
The sandwich gave him a stroke.
How do you like this?

224
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:59,001
The sandwich.

225
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:02,096
Do you mind if l...
if I, uh...

226
00:11:03,105 --> 00:11:05,265
I'm a big fan
of "Seinfeld."

227
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:08,274
- I don't know if that bothers you.
- Why would it bother me?

228
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:10,605
- It was a wonderful show.
- Thank you.

229
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:12,872
And I'll tell you what,

230
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,845
I'm gonna do your father's
surgery for you.

231
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,574
I'm chief surgeon here.

232
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:19,706
Usually I delegate it
to somebody else,

233
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:22,079
but I would be happy
to do this for you.

234
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:25,278
- Thank you.
- You're a golfer, right?

235
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:28,615
Would like to get
together and play?

236
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:40,787
I can't believe that that sandwich might
have been responsible for this.

237
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,226
I'm so sorry.

238
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:47,821
Whitefish.

239
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,831
Why did he have
to give me whitefish?

240
00:11:49,865 --> 00:11:52,492
There are so many
other sandwiches.

241
00:11:52,534 --> 00:11:55,696
Pastrami, tuna...
I would've taken tuna...

242
00:11:55,736 --> 00:11:58,670
even with the mercury.

243
00:12:01,372 --> 00:12:03,306
What stinks in here?

244
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,205
You know what?
I think you smell from the onion.

245
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:10,109
You want a mint?

246
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,634
Take a mint.

247
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,373
No mint?

248
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:17,404
I got a whole handful
of them.

249
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,110
What?

250
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,518
What?

251
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,416
What is it?

252
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,755
I didn't...

253
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,198
I'm a doctor?

254
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,825
What?
I'm a doctor?

255
00:12:55,304 --> 00:12:57,737
I'm, a-adopted?

256
00:12:57,772 --> 00:12:59,363
Adopted?

257
00:12:59,406 --> 00:13:01,396
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,306
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
- Did you say I'm adopted?

259
00:13:04,342 --> 00:13:05,968
Okay, okay.

260
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:07,771
- Now.
- Okay.

261
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,777
- "Adopted," you said?
- You have to leave now.

262
00:13:09,811 --> 00:13:12,210
- Let's go now.
- Dad, I'm adopted?

263
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:14,338
- I'm adopted?
- Let's go.

264
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,574
Let's go.

265
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:18,014
I'm adopted.

266
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:22,678
I think I'm adopted.
I might be adopted.

267
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,084
I think I'm adopted.

268
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:27,247
I could be adopted.

269
00:13:27,288 --> 00:13:29,721
I might be adopted.

270
00:13:31,657 --> 00:13:33,749
Dennis, hey!

271
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,419
Where'd you
come from?

272
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,086
Upstairs.

273
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:39,220
Upstairs?
What the...?

274
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:42,253
Hey, do you mind
if I stop this for a second?

275
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:44,491
I have an idea.

276
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,328
Maybe it'd be
more funny if...

277
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:49,129
I've suspected this a long time.
I really did.

278
00:13:49,168 --> 00:13:52,465
The only noticeable thing
I have in common with them,

279
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:54,232
honest to God,
is my penmanship.

280
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:55,794
I noticed there's
a similarity.

281
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:57,668
Isn't there something
with the stroke

282
00:13:57,706 --> 00:14:00,105
with oxygen
to his brain?

283
00:14:00,141 --> 00:14:02,802
- Come on. Adopted?
- Don't ruin this for me.

284
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,241
- I'm not trying to ruin it.
- Don't rain on my parade.

285
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,744
- Look who's here.
- Hey!

286
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:09,938
- Hey, Jeff. Hey, man.
- I can't shake.

287
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,344
Bad fingers.
Hurt my fingers.

288
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,847
All right.
I am so bummed out.

289
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:15,247
I'm awful.
I don't know how

290
00:14:15,283 --> 00:14:16,874
- to be funny anymore.
- It's not you.

291
00:14:16,917 --> 00:14:19,942
- It's the writing.
- Why are you here by the way?

292
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:21,782
No... we were just...
I was at his office.

293
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,515
Thought I'd bring him by.
Told him you were filming here.

294
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:27,182
- He got excited.
- I figured I would check out the pilot.

295
00:14:27,223 --> 00:14:29,190
Thanks, buddy.
I really appreciate it.

296
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:30,588
Oh, guess what?

297
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:32,649
- Leo's... you know.
- Yeah.

298
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:35,455
- They named a sandwich after me.
- You're kidding?

299
00:14:35,494 --> 00:14:38,257
- I got a sandwich.
- That's wonderful.

300
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:41,059
- I'm on the board.
- You've arrived.

301
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:43,258
- I'm on the board.
- That is fantastic.

302
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,925
- Yep.
- That's good news.

303
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,830
The thing about it...
I was wondering,

304
00:14:46,867 --> 00:14:48,993
'cause I know you don't
go in there very much...

305
00:14:49,035 --> 00:14:52,299
I'm in there all the time.
I'm in there three times a week.

306
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:55,736
You know, and in as much
as you don't go in there,

307
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:58,069
I was just thinking
that maybe...

308
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:00,734
'cause my sandwich
is a great sandwich,

309
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,208
but I'm not really
a fish guy.

310
00:15:03,243 --> 00:15:06,211
- Yeah.
- You gotta like fish.

311
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,508
- Eh.
- You like fish, but anyway...

312
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:11,606
so I was thinking maybe you
wouldn't mind switching with me.

313
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,707
Switching sandwiches?

314
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,650
You don't go in there.
I'd like to eat my own sandwich.

315
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:20,312
It would be fun to go in with my dad
and eat my own sandwich.

316
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:23,287
All right. What the hell.
What's the harm?

317
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:24,948
- Really?
- Yeah, why not?

318
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,956
- Fantastic!
- Yeah yeah yeah.

319
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,480
Just so if anyone asks me,
what's in my new sandwich?

320
00:15:29,525 --> 00:15:31,492
Okay, it's, um...

321
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:33,356
you got whitefish.

322
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:35,089
You know whitefish?

323
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:37,562
- Whitefish.
- Whitefish,

324
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:39,223
and sable.

325
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,493
What is sable?

326
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,896
Sable. It's a fish.

327
00:15:42,933 --> 00:15:44,924
It's like a whitefish.
It's a smoked fish.

328
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:47,491
- It's a smoked fish.
- You have two fishes?

329
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:49,503
Yeah, but they blend
very well together.

330
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:51,629
They're like Siamese twins,
whitefish and sable.

331
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:52,968
What else is in it?

332
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:55,234
- No condiments?
- Cream cheese.

333
00:15:56,341 --> 00:15:58,638
There's some cream cheese.
It's...

334
00:15:58,676 --> 00:15:59,972
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

335
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:01,942
Capers.

336
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:06,375
They're may be some capers.
I'm not sure.

337
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:08,506
If you don't like them,
you can brush them off.

338
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:11,242
- Not a big deal.
- Onions.

339
00:16:11,282 --> 00:16:13,273
Yeah.

340
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,082
That's sounds awful.

341
00:16:21,088 --> 00:16:24,056
What are you talking about?
Awful?

342
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,252
My sandwich is turkey,
coleslaw, Russian dressing.

343
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:30,384
It's a classic. People come in,
they order a Ted Danson.

344
00:16:30,427 --> 00:16:32,792
Yeah, but you're not there.
You don't go in there.

345
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:34,125
People are used
to my sandwich,

346
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,528
they show up and all of a sudden
they're eating...

347
00:16:36,564 --> 00:16:40,020
The Ted Danson sandwich
all of a sudden has herring and lox.

348
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:42,499
- It's not herring.
- Capers.

349
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,501
- Onions.
- Shut the fuck up.

350
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:46,627
It's not herring, okay?

351
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:49,102
It's whitefish and sable.
That's not herring.

352
00:16:49,137 --> 00:16:52,105
Instead of ordering a Ted Danson,
people order a Larry David.

353
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:53,537
What's the difference?

354
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:55,802
One tastes good
and one sucks!

355
00:16:55,841 --> 00:16:57,399
Why don't you
taste the sandwich?

356
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,034
- Taste it!
- I don't wanna taste it!

357
00:16:59,077 --> 00:17:01,135
- You can't even taste it?
- I don't wanna taste it!

358
00:17:01,178 --> 00:17:03,475
- You won't even taste it?
- You keep it.

359
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:06,947
- I'm won't taste your stupid sandwich.
- So you're not tasting it?

360
00:17:08,249 --> 00:17:11,411
Tickets? Tickets?
Who needs...

361
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:12,815
who needs tickets?

362
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:15,284
Tickets?

363
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:18,719
Happy New Year.
Tickets?

364
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:20,654
- How are you?
- Good.

365
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:22,280
You need tickets?

366
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:23,654
You got something?

367
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:26,487
- Do I have... I have the best seats.
- Yeah?

368
00:17:26,525 --> 00:17:28,890
I have fabulous...
two seats, right down front.

369
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:31,190
The cantor will be practically
spitting all over you.

370
00:17:31,228 --> 00:17:33,321
Really?
How much?

371
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:35,092
Give me $600 for the two.

372
00:17:35,131 --> 00:17:36,893
- I'll give you $300 for the pair.
- I'll take $300.

373
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,126
I'll take the $300.

374
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:46,025
You have no idea
what a deal this is.

375
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,661
Incredible deal
you got here.

376
00:17:53,141 --> 00:17:54,869
- Here you are.
- All right.

377
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,239
- You're not screwing me?
- You're screwing me maybe.

378
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,972
I'm giving you the deal
of a lifetime.

379
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,002
- Hey! All good.
- Got them.

380
00:18:02,046 --> 00:18:04,014
- Got them.
- How much?

381
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:06,015
- Pfft!
- Really?

382
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:08,016
- Yeah yeah.
- Oh, Jeez.

383
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,846
I don't understand
why you buy tickets.

384
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,249
- It's a popular day.
- Too many Jews to go around.

385
00:18:12,286 --> 00:18:13,479
Exactly.

386
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,419
By the way, thank you
for carpooling with us.

387
00:18:16,454 --> 00:18:19,081
I really never expected
you'd get in my car again

388
00:18:19,123 --> 00:18:21,090
- after the other night.
- We're sorry.

389
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:23,785
Listen,
this adoption thing,

390
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:25,348
I was thinking about it.

391
00:18:25,393 --> 00:18:28,555
Isn't there an aunt or an uncle
or somebody from your childhood?

392
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:31,495
Any relative who would know,
they're all dead.

393
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:34,225
- They're all dead? Every last one?
- All dead.

394
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:36,596
There's one person.

395
00:18:36,633 --> 00:18:40,067
I had a nanny
when I was...

396
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,398
- You had a nanny?
- I had a nanny... Johanna Seiderman...

397
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,903
- Yeah?
...when I was a little kid.

398
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:47,996
Antoinette tracked
her down.

399
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,371
There's a Johanna Seiderman
in a nursing home

400
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:53,205
- in Queens...
- Really?

401
00:18:53,243 --> 00:18:54,903
And I've written her
a letter.

402
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:57,502
This is terrific. That way you'll have
definitive "yes, no."

403
00:18:57,545 --> 00:19:00,536
You might not be happy,
but you'll know.

404
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,604
Let me ask
you guys a question.

405
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:04,137
You pick up the phone
during sex?

406
00:19:04,182 --> 00:19:05,842
- No!
- Why would you pick up?

407
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,612
You're in the middle of an intimate
moment with your loved one.

408
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:10,618
- You're gonna pick up?
- I'm...

409
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,881
- Fine.
- Why would you pick up?

410
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,513
If every blue moon I have sex,
I'm not gonna pick up.

411
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:18,682
- Why do you have an answering machine?
- Thank you.

412
00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:21,419
You're having an intimate moment
and you pick up?

413
00:19:21,459 --> 00:19:23,153
- Who does that?
- Hey, Larry.

414
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,887
Larry, Rob.

415
00:19:24,927 --> 00:19:27,986
Oh, can't shake, Rob.
Got a bad hand.

416
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:29,461
Okay. All right.

417
00:19:29,496 --> 00:19:31,929
- Um, so this your wife?
- No! What? No!

418
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:34,261
- What kind of response is that?
- That's my wife.

419
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,960
Oh, hey,
I'll see you inside.

420
00:19:37,001 --> 00:19:39,025
- Okay, see you inside.
- All right, take care.

421
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:41,366
- Sorry? What?
- Really! It's always a thing.

422
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:43,370
- Oh, stop.
- "No no no no!"

423
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:46,304
Well, you've got
your Al Capone hat on.

424
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,001
This happens to be
a very expensive hat, mister.

425
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,838
- It's rude.
- Let's go in and pray.

426
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:53,900
Let's go in and pray.

427
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:56,241
Sorry, Susie.

428
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:04,542
"Be among those
who cherish truth above ease.

429
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:06,812
Their fruit we eat now;

430
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:10,445
Their essence remains for us
in the life to come.

431
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:48,071
Hey hey.

432
00:20:48,109 --> 00:20:50,576
- How'd you get that sandwich?
- What are you talking about?

433
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,043
- That sandwich at the deli!
- Leo gave it to me.

434
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:54,942
- That's how I got it.
- Did you bribe him?

435
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:56,468
I bribed him.
That's rich.

436
00:20:56,513 --> 00:20:58,105
What are you
talking about?

437
00:20:58,148 --> 00:21:00,377
- How many times a week do you go?
- I don't know. Two?

438
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,315
- I go there five times a week.
- Big deal.

439
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:03,577
I eat anything
off the menu.

440
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:05,481
- I eat a lot of stuff too.
- I take stuff out.

441
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:07,349
- I get deliveries.
- I give it to charity.

442
00:21:07,387 --> 00:21:08,785
- Shh!
- Big deal!

443
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,787
What were you
talking to him about?

444
00:21:10,821 --> 00:21:12,720
None of your business.
The new year.

445
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,246
"Leo, I didn't get a sandwich.
I want a sandwich."

446
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,382
Your sandwich stinks,
by the way. It stinks!

447
00:21:17,425 --> 00:21:19,688
You stink.

448
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:22,285
Excuse me, sir.
I'm gonna need to see your ticket.

449
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:26,023
- Why?
- Your ticket, sir.

450
00:21:26,064 --> 00:21:28,429
Is there a problem?

451
00:21:28,465 --> 00:21:30,125
What's the problem?

452
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:34,334
This the guy?

453
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:38,567
- Okay, pal.
- You little snitch.

454
00:21:38,604 --> 00:21:41,037
- You're gonna have to step out.
- I have a ticket.

455
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:44,063
- Do you feel like making a scene?
- No.

456
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:45,472
- Shh!
- Oh, shush you.

457
00:21:45,508 --> 00:21:47,135
- Shh!
- Shh!

458
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:48,540
- Shh!
- Shush yourself!

459
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:50,543
All right, great.
Little tattletale.

460
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:52,840
You little snitch.
He spilled the coffee, by the way,

461
00:21:52,879 --> 00:21:55,278
because I couldn't put my fingers
through your dainty cup!

462
00:21:55,313 --> 00:21:57,940
You're setting a bad example
for my gentile wife.

463
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,972
It's her first time
in temple.

464
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:02,245
- What's happening?
- They're kicking us out.

465
00:22:02,284 --> 00:22:04,547
- Are you gonna wait?
- It's gonna be an hour and a half.

466
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:06,610
How are we gonna get home?
We carpooled with you.

467
00:22:06,654 --> 00:22:08,780
You'll get a ride.
There's plenty of people.

468
00:22:08,822 --> 00:22:11,914
- Let's go.
- Get a ride.

469
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:15,482
Friends, let us
continue on page 133.

470
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,692
- I saw you roll about seven feet past.
- Yeah.

471
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,696
Get this: The doctor
divorced his wife

472
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,492
and is seeing
his secretary.

473
00:22:26,498 --> 00:22:28,590
- Just told me.
- Unbelievable.

474
00:22:28,633 --> 00:22:30,259
- This guy.
- Heh.

475
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,063
- Did you hear from the nanny?
- No.

476
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,763
No, not yet.

477
00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:36,737
- You must be on pins and needles.
- Yeah.

478
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:38,328
But I think if she
gets the letter,

479
00:22:38,372 --> 00:22:40,464
she's gonna get
in touch with me.

480
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:41,837
We'll see.

481
00:22:41,874 --> 00:22:43,465
- That's wild.
- Isn't it?

482
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:45,134
Yeah yeah yeah.

483
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:03,347
He's got the yips.

484
00:23:08,389 --> 00:23:09,754
The what?

485
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,416
The yips.

486
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,687
- The yips!
- I don't know what that is.

487
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,555
- You never heard of the yips?
- No.

488
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,355
Okay, it's in golf.

489
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:19,987
You line up to putt
and your hands shake.

490
00:23:20,029 --> 00:23:21,894
He was shaking
like this.

491
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:25,365
Well, maybe it's just
a golf condition.

492
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:27,628
He gets nervous
when he putts.

493
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:31,033
I can't take that chance.
He's operating on my father.

494
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,798
You need to call him
and tell him not to do it.

495
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:35,737
They're gonna have
to get somebody else.

496
00:23:35,772 --> 00:23:38,637
- I hate doing stuff like this.
- You don't have a choice.

497
00:23:38,673 --> 00:23:40,334
I hate these calls.

498
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:43,603
Pick up the phone
and call the doctor.

499
00:23:43,642 --> 00:23:45,405
Maybe you could
call him.

500
00:23:45,444 --> 00:23:47,274
If it was my father

501
00:23:47,312 --> 00:23:49,142
I would've already been
on the phone.

502
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:51,738
Okay.

503
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:00,046
You should go out
of the room

504
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:03,053
'cause I can't do this
in front of somebody, honest to God.

505
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:06,578
Could you leave the room?
It's like calling for a date.

506
00:24:06,623 --> 00:24:08,852
- I need privacy.
- Oy.

507
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:30,361
I never... I never said
you were adopted.

508
00:24:30,402 --> 00:24:31,801
Yeah, that's what
you said.

509
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,394
No, I never said that.

510
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:35,564
I wouldn't say that
to you, no.

511
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:37,164
It's not true, no.

512
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:39,470
- You're not adopted.
- It's okay, you can tell me.

513
00:24:39,509 --> 00:24:41,567
- I can take it. Are you sure?
- You're not.

514
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:45,066
Listen, that
Larry David sandwich,

515
00:24:45,111 --> 00:24:46,578
I didn't finish it.

516
00:24:46,613 --> 00:24:48,546
I remember seeing
a half a sandwich

517
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,012
still on that table.

518
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:51,378
You want
the other half?

519
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:53,211
You know, I just ran
into your doctor.

520
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,876
I'm meeting him
there for lunch.

521
00:24:54,917 --> 00:24:57,578
- What a nightmare that's gonna be.
- What?

522
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:02,387
You sure
I'm not adopted?

523
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:07,319
I never said that.
Never.

524
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:28,526
Okay.

525
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,399
We'll see what
Mrs. Seiderman has to say.

526
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:47,775
Ah! Um...

527
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,742
I'd like a Larry David
to go, please.

528
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,876
Oh, we don't have
that sandwich anymore.

529
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:56,886
- What?
- They changed the name.

530
00:26:03,657 --> 00:26:06,420
And I say that it happens
every single time.

531
00:26:08,126 --> 00:26:11,719
I swear to God.
I wouldn't lie to you, not to you guys.

532
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:14,285
Larry, what are you
doing here?

533
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:17,695
You stole my sandwich?
Is that what you did?

534
00:26:17,731 --> 00:26:19,857
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

535
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:22,458
- What are you talking about?
- You stole my sandwich!

536
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:25,435
- What does that mean?
- Look at the board!

537
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:26,628
You're blaming me?

538
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,432
I saw you talking to him
outside the temple.

539
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,461
- You're out of your mind.
- You don't think I saw you?

540
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,063
I always talk
to people outside.

541
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:34,869
It's Rosh Hashanah!
It's the New Year!

542
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:37,273
I talk to deli owners!
I talk to pawnbrokers!

543
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:40,368
- "Leo, can I please have a sandwich?"
- Oh, bullshit!

544
00:26:40,411 --> 00:26:42,242
You were so jealous
that I had a sandwich,

545
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:44,007
you just couldn't
take it, could you?

546
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:46,139
You had to get
your sandwich!

547
00:26:46,181 --> 00:26:48,580
I got information
you might be interested in.

548
00:26:48,616 --> 00:26:49,980
I can't wait.
What is it?

549
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:51,710
I'm adopted.

550
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,980
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit?

551
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,282
Bullshit?
No, it's not bullshit.

552
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:58,185
What do you mean
you're adopted?

553
00:26:58,221 --> 00:26:59,710
I'm adopted.

554
00:26:59,755 --> 00:27:02,621
- How do you know?
- My father told me.

555
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:05,625
- You don't know who your parents are?
- They're not those nuts!

556
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:07,956
I know that, but I know
who yours are.

557
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:10,586
- Fuck.
- Enjoy your whitefish. Enjoy.

558
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,596
- Larry.
- Yeah?

559
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,461
Larry, you are adopted?

560
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:17,465
- Yeah.
- I adopted too!

561
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:19,466
You are my brother!

562
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,127
We are in the brotherhood
of the adopted!

563
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:23,897
Larry,
come on over here.

564
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:25,368
You know what
I'm going to do?

565
00:27:25,403 --> 00:27:27,597
I'm going to let you
have any sandwich you want.

566
00:27:27,638 --> 00:27:30,003
- Really?
- Any one you want! Take it!

567
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:31,438
- Go ahead, take it.
- Oh, boy.

568
00:27:31,474 --> 00:27:33,737
- Take it.
- It's a tough decision.

569
00:27:33,775 --> 00:27:35,503
Okay okay, I wait.

570
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:38,170
I think I'm going to have
to go with that Ted Danson.

571
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,303
- Ted Danson? That's yours.
- Thank you.

572
00:27:40,346 --> 00:27:43,007
That son of a bitch
don't come in anyway!

573
00:27:43,047 --> 00:27:44,377
- You got it!
- Thank you.

574
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,971
- Hey, Larry.
- Dr. Sewell.

575
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:48,778
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Leo, this is Dr. Sewell.

576
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:50,375
- Leo.
- How are you, Dr. Sewell?

577
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:03,685
I think I'll get that
Larry David to go.

578
00:28:10,363 --> 00:28:12,796
Do not even think
about it.

579
00:28:12,831 --> 00:28:15,799
I'm expecting a phone call
from Mrs. Seiderman.

580
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,562
- Who?
- You know, my nanny.

581
00:28:20,736 --> 00:28:24,727
Do not pick up
that phone.

582
00:28:31,642 --> 00:28:33,131
Nobody's picking up.

583
00:28:33,175 --> 00:28:36,735
I had an answer

584
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:38,836
to his question.

585
00:28:38,879 --> 00:28:43,177
If only he had
picked up.

586
00:28:44,982 --> 00:28:46,950
Mrs. Seiderman?

587
00:28:46,984 --> 00:28:49,780
Mrs. Seiderman.

588
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:52,285
Mrs. Seiderman!

589
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,310
Mrs. Seiderman?!
