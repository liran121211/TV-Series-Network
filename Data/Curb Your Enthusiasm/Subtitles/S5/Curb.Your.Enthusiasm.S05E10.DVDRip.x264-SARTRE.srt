1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,423


2
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:16,687
It's kind
of small in there.

3
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:17,715
Yeah, but it's not for you

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,727
It's for your nanny, right?

5
00:00:19,761 --> 00:00:21,194
It's for my nanny.
You're right.

6
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,787
All right, how much?

7
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:24,128
Whatever you think
is fair.

8
00:00:24,166 --> 00:00:25,360
- Really?
- Yeah.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,765
I'm shocked.

10
00:00:26,802 --> 00:00:29,133
All right, um,

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,228
you know what?

12
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:33,536
I'll find the Blue Book value
and that's what I'll give you.

13
00:00:33,574 --> 00:00:36,202
- You got a deal, my big friend.
- All right, my friend.

14
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:38,267
- All right. Congratulations.
- Oh my gosh!

15
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,074
- You bought yourself a great car.
- Thank you.

16
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:43,981
Hold on a second. Louis Lewis has
just come out of his coma.

17
00:00:44,017 --> 00:00:46,610
Okay, so what happens now?

18
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:55,055
Oh yeah,
oh that's a great idea.

19
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:56,855
Yeah, no, invite
anybody you want.

20
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,225
Yeah, let's go all the way.

21
00:00:58,262 --> 00:01:00,321
Okay, I'll see you tonight.
All right, bye.

22
00:01:00,364 --> 00:01:02,594
I'm going to a party tonight

23
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:05,396
my friends are throwing for me
'cause I'm getting out of here,

24
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:08,268
- and I would like you to go with me.
- Okay.

25
00:01:08,305 --> 00:01:11,172
- Yes? Wow.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:11,208 --> 00:01:14,199
Hey, what are you gonna do about
your cousin who needs a kidney?

27
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:15,437
- What, Ritchie?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:15,477 --> 00:01:18,344
Well, so we'll
find him a kidney.

29
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,678
- What about yours?
- What, are you crazy?

30
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:22,740
I'm not giving
anybody my kidney.

31
00:01:22,784 --> 00:01:25,446
I just woke up.
I'm gonna give things out now?

32
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:27,818
- That's very selfish.
- Selfish?

33
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:29,881
- Yeah.
- Hey, let me ask you a question.

34
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,084
You know, I heard
that you come in and out

35
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,525
of here all the time
and I don't understand that.

36
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,222
I hardly know you.

37
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,390
I met you briefly once
at Ritchie's house

38
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:40,456
and they tell me
you're in here all the time.

39
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:44,492
I visit people in the hospital
and I cheer them up.

40
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,698
I go around,
I do volunteer work.

41
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,071
And I knew you were here
so I stopped in to see you.

42
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,803
Well I'll tell you something,
you don't have to cheer me up

43
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:53,242
because I'm cheered up.

44
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:55,371
It pays to be in a coma,
I'm telling you.

45
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,278
I've never felt
so refreshed in my life.

46
00:01:57,315 --> 00:01:59,145
- Oh, really?
- You know those bears,

47
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:01,913
they had it right.
They go into hibernation,

48
00:02:01,952 --> 00:02:04,113
they come out like new bears.

49
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:07,123
Everybody should do this.

50
00:02:07,157 --> 00:02:09,556
Congratulations again
on the...

51
00:02:09,592 --> 00:02:12,060
getting out of the coma.

52
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:58,768
You should've seen him
walking down that hall.

53
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,271
It was like
the specter of death.

54
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:05,071
And then he passed me
and he looked at me.

55
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,804
I'm haunted by that look.

56
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:12,638
Have you seen the, uh,
case for the "Sopranos" DVD?

57
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:15,173
No.

58
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:17,447
I can't find it anywhere.

59
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:19,613
Did you do
something with it?

60
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:21,485
No, I didn't
do anything with it.

61
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:24,686
If you're blaming this on me,
you're barking up the wrong tree, okay?

62
00:03:24,726 --> 00:03:26,785
I have a system.
When I watch a DVD,

63
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:29,295
I put the case on top
of the DVD player.

64
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,958
Then when I'm done,
I take the DVD,

65
00:03:31,999 --> 00:03:34,729
I put it back in the case,
and then I put it back on the shelf.

66
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,861
Well, your system's
breaking down.

67
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:38,928
- My system is foolproof.
- There's no case

68
00:03:38,972 --> 00:03:42,135
- on top of the DVD player.
- Well, you're the one, probably,

69
00:03:42,175 --> 00:03:44,166
who took it out
and didn't put it back.

70
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,802
Don't blame it on me.

71
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:48,039
I mean, I'm not even
that friendly with him.

72
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,071
Yeah, I know him 44 years,

73
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,140
but we're not really
close friends.

74
00:03:52,184 --> 00:03:53,708
He's more
of an acquaintance.

75
00:03:53,752 --> 00:03:55,617
Who gives a kidney
to an acquaintance?

76
00:03:55,654 --> 00:03:59,180
I just feel like if we're
going to watch DVDs

77
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:00,918
that we should keep
the case nearby

78
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:03,791
- so we don't end up with just the...
- Do you have any sympathy

79
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,057
for what I'm going through?
It doesn't seem like you do.

80
00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:13,025
Hello?

81
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:17,799
Oh, okay, um,

82
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,775
yeah, all right, I'Il...
I'll see you tomorrow.

83
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,868
All right, thanks.

84
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,470
- Huh.
- What?

85
00:04:25,513 --> 00:04:27,572
That was Omar Jones.

86
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:30,015
He said he has
some information for me.

87
00:04:30,051 --> 00:04:32,314
He wants me to come
to the office tomorrow.

88
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:40,524
So, Mr. David, I've got some
very very interesting news

89
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,993
for you about your case.

90
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:45,190
Turns out you were right.

91
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,222
You are,

92
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:50,496
in fact, adopted.

93
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:53,732
Now your biological parents
are Mr. And Mrs. Cone.

94
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:57,674
And they currently reside
in Bisby, Arizona.

95
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,074
They're awaiting your call.

96
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:53,316
Please notice this aircraft
has three emergency exits

97
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:55,382
located in the rear,
center and forward sections

98
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:57,121
of the cabin.
Passengers seated in these...

99
00:05:57,161 --> 00:05:59,595
Hi. Um, listen,

100
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,928
I can't really sit here
by the emergency door exit.

101
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:03,523
I think you better get
someone else.

102
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:05,728
Okay, sir we're about three
minutes away from wheels up.

103
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:08,260
So you need to just stay put, okay?
'Cause we got a full plane.

104
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:11,069
You don't understand. If something
happens we won't be able to get out.

105
00:06:11,108 --> 00:06:13,371
- Calm down, okay?
- I cannot do it.

106
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:15,536
I will panic.
We will go down.

107
00:06:15,578 --> 00:06:17,569
All we need to know is that
you're willing to assist

108
00:06:17,613 --> 00:06:19,638
passengers in the event
of a non-traditional landing.

109
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:21,672
I cannot be
of any help whatsoever

110
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:24,412
in any kind of non-traditional landing
or any traditional landing.

111
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,283
Did you read the brochure?

112
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:28,983
Read the brochure? I can't read
that brochure. It's Chinese to me.

113
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,855
I'm sorry, are you Chinese?
You look a little Asian. I'm sorry.

114
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,952
It's just an expression. I don't think
you are Chinese. You look maybe Thai?

115
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:37,793
Okay, is it the seat or are you
just scared to fly?

116
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,390
No, I choke under pressure.
In any kind of game...

117
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,401
basketball, if I was
on the foul line

118
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,369
towards, like the last five
minutes of the game,

119
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,167
I would miss the entire rim.
I couldn't even hit the rim!

120
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,105
'Cause I was choking.
Choking.

121
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:51,109
How about I get you a drink?
Would you like a Merlot?

122
00:06:51,143 --> 00:06:52,974
No thank you, I don't drink.
I don't drink.

123
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:55,138
Just please find
somebody else to sit here.

124
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,615
I'll look for a seat for you
but you owe me one, mister.

125
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:01,584
Thank you. I mean, it's ridiculous.
I don't want to sit here.

126
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:04,019
Why is she giving me a hard time?
Just find somebody else.

127
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:05,715
Who the hell knows
how to do this thing?

128
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:07,620
What, pull down?
What is that gonna do?

129
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:10,319
Can I pull down? Do you have
to be strong? I don't even know.

130
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,225
Then what do you do?
You smash this thing?

131
00:07:12,262 --> 00:07:15,094
What happens then? The door
just suddenly opens miraculously?

132
00:07:17,366 --> 00:07:19,800
You're not Chinese. You don't look
Chinese. What are you, Thai?

133
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:22,668
I think you're Thai.
You're Thai? I knew it.

134
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,344
- Son.
- Dad.

135
00:08:12,748 --> 00:08:14,739
Gosh. Come on in.

136
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:29,385
Well, I had just come
out of the Navy and, uh...

137
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,729
- Just gotten out, yeah.
- That's right, we met in Times Square.

138
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:35,200
And she was
the prettiest girl there

139
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:36,930
so I kissed her.

140
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,905
And, before long,

141
00:08:39,939 --> 00:08:41,770
we had a baby.

142
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:44,140
But, we didn't
have any money and...

143
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,303
well, we just didn't
know what to do.

144
00:08:46,345 --> 00:08:47,972
We were just so young
and just...

145
00:08:48,013 --> 00:08:49,378
- I understand.
- You know?

146
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:51,882
You remember anything
about the people who you,

147
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:54,282
uh, who, uh,
what, adopted me?

148
00:08:54,318 --> 00:08:56,115
Who adopted you?
Yeah, we met them.

149
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:58,849
The guy was a little
nervous and jumpy.

150
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:00,823
He was all over the place.
Jumpy, fidgety.

151
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:03,553
- All over the place.
- Fidgety, huh? Fidgety guy?

152
00:09:03,593 --> 00:09:05,185
Yeah.

153
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:06,991
Kind of talked
like that a little bit?

154
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,328
- He did kind of.
- That's exactly right.

155
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:12,459
- He really has it, doesn't he?
- I remember that, yeah.

156
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:15,368
And she was lovely,
but she was a little loud.

157
00:09:15,404 --> 00:09:17,736
But she... she sort
of ruled the roost.

158
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,798
- Oh yeah.
- But you knew she was a good woman.

159
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:23,072
You wouldn't want to get
on the wrong side of her, though.

160
00:09:23,111 --> 00:09:25,875
- No, you wouldn't.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:25,913 --> 00:09:29,280
And they... they wanted
a baby so badly.

162
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:33,184
Tell me a little bit about
where you're from, Brooklyn?

163
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,313
Oh, no no no.
I'm from Illinois.

164
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:36,982
Yeah, and I'm from Virginia

165
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,753
- I was born and raised in Virginia.
- There, yeah.

166
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:43,023
So, so we're both sort
of Midwestern, Southern.

167
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:47,362
My people came from,
oh, England and Scotland.

168
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,890
Been here
for hundreds of years.

169
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:53,233
How do you spell
your last name?

170
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:55,262
C-O-N-E.

171
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,255
Oh my God.

172
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:15,154
I'm Gentile.

173
00:10:28,402 --> 00:10:31,030
Hey, look. Dave.
Hi, Dave, how you doing?

174
00:10:31,072 --> 00:10:33,199
I want you to meet our son.
This is Larry.

175
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,571
- Larry, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you, Dave.

176
00:10:35,608 --> 00:10:38,236
- How are you today?
- He's a Chevrolet dealer here.

177
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:40,246
How come my dad
bought one of those?

178
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,510
- I don't know, I can't help that.
- I'm in trouble.

179
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,676
- Hi, June.
- Hi, Jenny.

180
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:47,481
- Hi, Jenny.
- Good to see you.

181
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,182
- This is our son Larry.
- Larry, nice to meet you.

182
00:10:51,223 --> 00:10:53,247
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Enjoying our town?

183
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,986
Oh, I love it.
It's beautiful.

184
00:10:55,026 --> 00:10:58,257
- Hey! Hi, Wilson.
- Hi.

185
00:10:58,296 --> 00:11:00,287
This is our son Larry.

186
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:02,491
- Hi, Wilson.
- I didn't know you had a son.

187
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:05,592
- We do now.
- Are you sticking around?

188
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:08,968
- I think I might.
- Isn't that nice?

189
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:12,405
- Nice little town.
- You're gonna like it here.

190
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,208
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

191
00:11:16,245 --> 00:11:18,110
I noticed you're
selling your car here.

192
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:20,740
Yep, letter her go.
You interested?

193
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:24,343
Well, no I'm not. But may I ask
how you arrived at that price?

194
00:11:24,386 --> 00:11:26,377
Sure, that's the actual
Blue Book value.

195
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:29,912
- That's the Blue Book value?
- Yeah, right there.

196
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:34,155
Huh, I sold a Prius
to a friend of mine

197
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,287
and he told me the Blue Book value
was $5,000 less than that.

198
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,525
Ouch.

199
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,565
Larry, what's wrong?

200
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,539
My friend took
advantage of me, Mom.

201
00:11:48,573 --> 00:11:51,974
Oh, I know it hurts, Son,

202
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,774
but you must practice
love and forgiveness.

203
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:58,179
Give him the benefit of the doubt.
That's what Jesus would do.

204
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:07,686
Hey, I got a bite, Pop.

205
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:09,589
I got... I got it.
I got one.

206
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:27,974
You did it!

207
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:53,594
Good, Son.

208
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,727
Go! Whoa...

209
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,033
chug, chug, chug, chug...

210
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:12,781
Wow, this really
looks yummy.

211
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:15,784
We have, we have to say
Grace first, Larry.

212
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:21,619
Dear Lord, we thank You
for this bountiful meal.

213
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:24,090
We thank You
for the love of each other.

214
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,059
And most of all, we thank You
for our son, Larry,

215
00:13:27,094 --> 00:13:29,062
that he's able to be
with us here today,

216
00:13:29,096 --> 00:13:32,623
Having this great meal.
Amen.

217
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,429
- Amen.
- Amen.

218
00:13:37,737 --> 00:13:40,035
- What do you got there?
- Sign of the Cross.

219
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:44,169
Oh, nose, toes...

220
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,268
- Nose?
...and watch, wallet.

221
00:13:46,311 --> 00:13:48,711
Nose, toes...

222
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:50,942
except I keep my watch
and wallet on the same side.

223
00:13:50,983 --> 00:13:54,008
- I don't think it's gonna work.
- Oh, Larry.

224
00:13:54,051 --> 00:13:56,076
All right, nose, toes,

225
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,145
I'll just move my wallet
to the right side.

226
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,554
Oh good.
That's simple.

227
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,319
That's it, right?
One, two, three, four.

228
00:14:01,359 --> 00:14:03,656
- Right, that's it. You have it.
- I kind of like that.

229
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:06,127
- You've got it.
- Huh? That's it?

230
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:08,630
That's it. Dig in, Larry.

231
00:14:08,665 --> 00:14:10,962
All right.

232
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,833
Oh, Larry.

233
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,560
My friends,
I want to speak to you

234
00:15:23,598 --> 00:15:26,726
on this beautiful
Sunday morning

235
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:29,167
about a relationship
in our lives

236
00:15:29,203 --> 00:15:32,262
that we sometimes
take for granted.

237
00:15:32,305 --> 00:15:34,739
We have our family.

238
00:15:34,774 --> 00:15:39,143
We have our husbands,
wives, children,

239
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,944
and all the extended relatives
of that family.

240
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:45,576
But there is another bond,

241
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:49,782
and that is
the bond of friendship.

242
00:15:49,822 --> 00:15:52,517
Think of all that it implies.

243
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:54,548
The caring, the compassion,

244
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:56,492
the devotion to loyalty,

245
00:15:56,527 --> 00:15:58,290
and above all, perhaps,

246
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:01,923
to the generosity of spirit.

247
00:16:01,965 --> 00:16:05,298
We must all ask ourselves...

248
00:16:05,335 --> 00:16:08,667
Am I a good friend?

249
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:12,196
Am I giving
the friend in need

250
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:15,369
what he needs most?

251
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:18,140
Have I sacrificed
my own well-being

252
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:19,840
for the sake of him,

253
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:22,179
or have I let
my own selfish needs

254
00:16:22,217 --> 00:16:25,653
stand in the way
of being his best friend?

255
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:27,779
- My friends...
- Mom, Dad.

256
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,585
...give whenever
the opportunity arises...

257
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:34,023
I have to go.

258
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:37,552
...and taste the joy
that is God's reward.

259
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,229
Please notice this aircraft
has three emergency exits

260
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,394
located in the rear, center
and forward sections of the cabin.

261
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,267
Passengers seated
in these exit rows

262
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:48,829
agree to assist
in the event of emergency.

263
00:16:48,874 --> 00:16:51,104
If for any reason a passenger
seated in the exit row...

264
00:16:51,143 --> 00:16:53,202
- Well, hello again.
- Oh, hi there.

265
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:56,042
Hi. I'll go ahead and get
you another seat, okay?

266
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,139
Oh, won't hear of it.

267
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:00,616
You can depend on me, ma'am.
I won't let you down.

268
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,586
- I got it covered.
- Really?

269
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:07,488
Oh and, uh, be a dear, would you
and get me a gin and tonic?

270
00:17:07,524 --> 00:17:09,492
Sure.

271
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:15,520
Nice day for a flight.

272
00:17:32,412 --> 00:17:34,141
You can have my kidney.

273
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:36,513
Oh, I love you, man.

274
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,245
I knew you'd come through.
You're a hero.

275
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:40,309
It's okay buddy.
Everything's gonna be okay.

276
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:44,254
Oh, I hope so.
Thank you, man. Oh God.

277
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,951
- Hey?
- Huh?

278
00:17:45,991 --> 00:17:48,788
- What's that?
- What's that what?

279
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:52,092
- What's this putter?
- Larry, thank you.

280
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,563
Have you always had this?

281
00:17:53,598 --> 00:17:55,589
Yeah, I've had these
for awhile, you know.

282
00:17:55,633 --> 00:17:57,964
I borrowed this from my friend
a few weeks ago

283
00:17:58,001 --> 00:18:00,162
and I played
out of my mind with it.

284
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,831
I've been looking
all over for this.

285
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,237
You can't even
get them anymore.

286
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:05,332
My God, I love this putter.

287
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,841
Yeah, I know,
it's pretty great.

288
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:10,004
Um, would it be okay if I
borrowed this for a while?

289
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:13,447
Mmm, I don't think so.

290
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,473
What?

291
00:18:15,517 --> 00:18:18,543
I've lost a lot of clubs.
I've lent them out through the years...

292
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:21,249
I'm not going to do anything. I'll take
really good care of it, believe me.

293
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,689
- I can't lend them out anymore.
- I don't get that.

294
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:25,715
Come on, I'll take good
care of it, I promise.

295
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,285
No, I'm sure you will.
But l... I prefer you didn't.

296
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:31,025
I'm... I'm about...

297
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,433
What?

298
00:18:36,469 --> 00:18:39,563
I completely understand.
L... l...

299
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:42,904
- I respect your decisions.
- Really?

300
00:18:42,941 --> 00:18:45,068
I still love you.

301
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:48,504
God bless you.

302
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,345
Jesus Christ.

303
00:18:56,788 --> 00:18:59,484
Cheryl?

304
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:03,015
- Yeah?
- I'm home.

305
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,517
How are you?
Good to see you.

306
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,459
Oh my God.

307
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:12,967
What?

308
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,270
I love you.
I love you.

309
00:19:16,305 --> 00:19:18,966
Mmm, I love you so much.

310
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:21,441
- I love you.
- Okay.

311
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:24,309
What are you wearing?

312
00:19:24,345 --> 00:19:26,575
Is this a sweater vest?

313
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:32,046
- I've been doing a lot of thinking.
- Hm-mm.

314
00:19:32,085 --> 00:19:34,815
I want to have children.

315
00:19:34,855 --> 00:19:36,822
Lots of them.

316
00:19:39,892 --> 00:19:41,223
Well, let's talk about that.

317
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,855
We... we, uh, that deserves
a discussion, I think.

318
00:19:44,897 --> 00:19:46,796
We can talk about it
tonight over dinner.

319
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:48,197
Okay.

320
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:50,224
And then I'll tell you
all about them.

321
00:19:50,268 --> 00:19:53,237
Yeah, maybe you could, uh...

322
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:56,262
you know, take your tie off.

323
00:19:58,843 --> 00:20:01,038
I know why God

324
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:03,545
saved me from drowning
a few months ago.

325
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,242
Why?

326
00:20:06,282 --> 00:20:08,910
He wanted me
to give Lewis my kidney.

327
00:20:08,952 --> 00:20:11,614
And I'm going to.

328
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:22,062
Gotta say, man,

329
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,690
You are very,
very calm, bro.

330
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:27,166
God will watch over me.

331
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:30,931
Hmm. He didn't
watch over the last guy.

332
00:20:30,971 --> 00:20:33,030
But you're a lucky man.

333
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:35,064
You're giving away a kidney.

334
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,009
The recipient is
going to love you, man.

335
00:20:38,044 --> 00:20:39,533
- Really?
- You're gonna have

336
00:20:39,578 --> 00:20:42,240
your own personal slave, is what it is.
You could be in China

337
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:44,374
and sneeze and he'll
bring you a tissue.

338
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:47,010
Well, that may be
true of others.

339
00:20:47,052 --> 00:20:48,951
I don't think
with him, though.

340
00:20:48,987 --> 00:20:52,047
He wouldn't even loan me
a putter, actually.

341
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,923
You're giving him a kidney,
he wouldn't loan you his putter?

342
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:57,393
Well, you know people get
very attached to their golf clubs.

343
00:20:57,428 --> 00:21:00,726
- It's understandable.
- You're not attached to your kidney?

344
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,758
That's fucked up, man.

345
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:35,591
Larry, I gotta tell ya, I'm too weak
to really express it and articulate it,

346
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:38,563
but this is the greatest thing
that anyone's ever done for me.

347
00:21:38,598 --> 00:21:40,759
I'll do anything for you
for the rest of your life.

348
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,859
Just ask me anything
and I'll do it for you, I promise.

349
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,803
Anything except
loan him your putter.

350
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:50,672
You told him
about the putter?

351
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,541
No, it it was an innocent
conversation.

352
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:56,239
Why would you even bring it
up under the circumstances?

353
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,407
- I actually defended you.
- Mr. David.

354
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:00,440
Defend me? Why don't you
call "E.T." or Pat O'Brien?

355
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,246
- Mr. David!
- I mean, how dare you?

356
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:05,254
What, you have to gossip?
What kind of person are you?

357
00:22:05,288 --> 00:22:08,086
- There's been a big, big mistake, okay?
- Huh?

358
00:22:08,124 --> 00:22:11,854
The Cones, they're not your parents.
You're not adopted.

359
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:14,362
- What are you talking about?
- You're not adopted.

360
00:22:14,396 --> 00:22:16,557
- I'm not adopted?
- No. Sorry.

361
00:22:16,598 --> 00:22:19,327
- What's going on here?
- What do you mean I'm not adopted?

362
00:22:19,367 --> 00:22:22,234
- What's going on here?
- If you need anything, let me know.

363
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,465
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I am.

364
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:26,496
Good luck with the surgery.

365
00:22:30,344 --> 00:22:32,312
I can't...

366
00:22:32,346 --> 00:22:35,873
I can't do this.
Oh, no no! I'm not adopted.

367
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:38,110
Get me out of here!
Get me the fuck out of here!

368
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,516
- Who is that guy?
- I can't do this!

369
00:22:40,553 --> 00:22:43,613
- What the hell are you... stop it!
- What about my kidney?

370
00:22:43,656 --> 00:22:45,988
I got... I don't...
I can't die.

371
00:22:46,024 --> 00:22:49,619
Hey, stay here.
What are you doing?

372
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:00,764
You're the best.
You're the best.

373
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,665
Hey. Let's go.

374
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:24,950
You really low-balled me
on that car.

375
00:23:28,562 --> 00:23:31,053
You paid me $5,000 less

376
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:33,531
than the Blue Book.

377
00:23:33,566 --> 00:23:37,297
I looked in the wrong book,
I guess, um.

378
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:40,430
I want you to give the $5,000
to Cher... to Cheryl.

379
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:43,703
I'll give the $5,000
to Cheryl.

380
00:23:43,742 --> 00:23:45,903
Okay.

381
00:23:57,155 --> 00:24:00,920
See?
This is what you get

382
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:03,585
from doing good deeds.

383
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:05,857
I avoided good deeds
my whole life.

384
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:08,989
Turns out I was right.

385
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,522
You're right.
Larry, the rabbi is here.

386
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:13,364
The rabbi.

387
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:17,469
Rabbi.

388
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:21,202
Larry, what can I say?

389
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:22,971
I'm still young, rabbi.

390
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:25,309
I thought when God
takes someone young,

391
00:24:25,346 --> 00:24:28,246
they're usually
a good person.

392
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:30,546
That's the one thing
I had going for me.

393
00:24:30,584 --> 00:24:32,882
Well God is...
is apparently

394
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,683
making an exception
in your case.

395
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:40,152
Larry, is your house
in order?

396
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:42,525
I mean you should have
everything settled by now.

397
00:24:42,562 --> 00:24:44,529
My business manager, Matt.

398
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:47,657
- L... I worked things out with him.
- Good, good.

399
00:24:49,868 --> 00:24:52,200
I supposed I could
have traveled more.

400
00:24:52,237 --> 00:24:55,137
- Yeah.
- But where was I gonna go?

401
00:24:55,172 --> 00:24:58,164
I went to Europe once.

402
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:01,406
No big deal.

403
00:25:01,445 --> 00:25:03,708
The truth is, rabbi,

404
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:07,307
I can't stand packing.

405
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,682
You know, Larry,

406
00:25:09,719 --> 00:25:11,913
we all have moments
in our life when

407
00:25:11,954 --> 00:25:15,014
we've acted
out of thoughtlessness

408
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:18,720
and we've been inconsiderate
to other people.

409
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,227
Is there anybody, right now,

410
00:25:21,262 --> 00:25:24,754
that you can think of you'd like
to ask for forgiveness

411
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,200
and make right with?

412
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,726
When you walk through my door,
you play by my rules.

413
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,738
You take off
your fucking shoes!

414
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:35,172
Devoted sister?
Beloved cunt?

415
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,233
He's a racist.
A bona fide racist

416
00:25:37,277 --> 00:25:40,268
Who preferred not to work with any
black people under any circumstances.

417
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:42,644
- You fucked up.
- Larry, you ate the baby Jesus

418
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:43,739
and his Mother Mary.

419
00:25:43,782 --> 00:25:45,977
- You were following my wife?!
- I wasn't following her!

420
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:48,485
She called the cops on you.
What do you mean to... look at me.

421
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,284
You knew that my brother-in-law
died on September 11th.

422
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:52,880
How dare you
say something like that?

423
00:25:52,924 --> 00:25:56,256
See, if this were yours it would say,
"fucking douche bag."

424
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,818
You mother-fucking, cock-sucking

425
00:25:58,862 --> 00:26:00,261
son of a bitch bastard!

426
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:02,197
I will body-slam
you so hard,

427
00:26:02,232 --> 00:26:04,200
that you will poop
your bald pants.

428
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:06,326
You need a good fucking
ass kicking.

429
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,633
That's what you need.
You want to name our baby "Tang"?

430
00:26:08,671 --> 00:26:12,300
Hey! Hold the door!

431
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:21,548
No, this is my jacket!

432
00:26:25,553 --> 00:26:27,453
What are you, crazy?

433
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:29,649
- Stop it!
- My neck! My neck!

434
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,259
- Don't push me again, you stupid...
- Larry!

435
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:38,287
- Get him, Joseph!
- Take it back! This is ours.

436
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,163
- Kill him, Joseph. Kill him!
- Shut up, Mary.

437
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,498
Ow!

438
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,969
You're a disgrace
to your people!

439
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,598
- Fuck you.
- Motherfucker, what the fuck?

440
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,164
Larry, you piece of shit.

441
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:53,643
- You be quiet, big nose.
- Go fuck yourself.

442
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:55,111
- Freak you.
- Freak you!

443
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:56,909
- Asshole.
- Thanks for nothing.

444
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,075
Get out right now!

445
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:04,946
- Good boy!
- Banzai!

446
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:12,257
Nah.

447
00:27:15,531 --> 00:27:18,021
Jeff.

448
00:27:22,403 --> 00:27:25,600
You know, I've never
said anything,

449
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,971
but I've noticed,

450
00:27:28,008 --> 00:27:30,499
you use way too much mayo.

451
00:27:30,544 --> 00:27:33,138
You know,
when they make tuna,

452
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,807
there's already
mayo in it.

453
00:27:35,848 --> 00:27:38,339
You don't have to put
it on the bread.

454
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:43,319
I'll use less mayo,
I promise.

455
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:46,847
Also...

456
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:48,825
you really never
should have let me do

457
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,761
that "Seinfeld"
"TV Guide" cover.

458
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,820
I really looked
like an asshole.

459
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:56,162
My mistake.
I'm so sorry.

460
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,758
- Anything else?
- No.

461
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,496
Okay.

462
00:28:02,273 --> 00:28:04,172
Dad.

463
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:11,408
I'm sorry about the adoption.

464
00:28:11,447 --> 00:28:13,311
You're... you're what?

465
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:15,942
The adop... the adoption.

466
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:17,474
The doc... the doctor?

467
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:22,115
Adop... adoption.

468
00:28:22,156 --> 00:28:26,058
You want a doctor?
A doctor?

469
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:28,789
- Mr. David...
- He wants... I guess he wants a doctor.

470
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:31,092
Yeah, why don't you step...
step right back here.

471
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:32,428
Lar.

472
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:40,329
Cheryl.

473
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:45,873
I know it's gonna be...

474
00:28:45,911 --> 00:28:49,607
a long time till I see you again,

475
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:51,945
so would it be okay if...

476
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:55,885
I fooled around a little

477
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,513
until you got there?

478
00:28:58,555 --> 00:29:00,580
Sure.

479
00:29:01,692 --> 00:29:03,489
Is there anything else?

480
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:08,528
I know it was you

481
00:29:08,564 --> 00:29:11,624
who misplaced that
"Sopranos" DVD cover.

482
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:16,802
It couldn't
have been me.

483
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,897
I have a system.

484
00:29:20,942 --> 00:29:23,910
I... I have a...

485
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:25,935
I have a system.

486
00:29:31,285 --> 00:29:33,275
Larry?

487
00:30:08,818 --> 00:30:11,809
Is there anything
you can tell me

488
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,412
about his will?

489
00:30:13,455 --> 00:30:17,255
I mean, I know it's...
it's awkward timing

490
00:30:17,292 --> 00:30:20,021
but he was very secretive
for a while

491
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:23,519
- there at the end and I just...
- Uh, Cheryl...

492
00:30:23,564 --> 00:30:26,692
This 5,000...
you want the $5,000?

493
00:30:26,734 --> 00:30:29,258
- Of course.
- Cheryl, that's unreasonable.

494
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,770
It really is.
He manipulated Jeff.

495
00:30:31,805 --> 00:30:33,568
Jeff had no choice but to say "yes."

496
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:35,632
I just heard him say
it was the Blue Book value on it.

497
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:37,471
- It's a petty wish.
- You don't need the money.

498
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,603
- He's petty in life,
he's petty in death.

499
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,375
- That's not the point.
- Cheryl, you have a lot of money.

500
00:30:42,415 --> 00:30:46,373
It was a...
no, no, Cheryl.

501
00:30:48,787 --> 00:30:50,982
He did not rip him off.

502
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,029
Hello.

503
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:53,877
We're your guides.

504
00:31:53,911 --> 00:31:58,609
We've been watching you
your whole life.

505
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:00,639
Please.

506
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,853
- You're my guides?
- Yeah, but you are dead.

507
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,450
You did die.

508
00:32:13,729 --> 00:32:15,787
You know, you've got
a lot of fans up here.

509
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,798
- Really?
- You've heard of Ponce De Leon?

510
00:32:17,832 --> 00:32:19,891
Yeah, the Spanish explorer.

511
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:21,424
- Yeah.
- I wrote a screenplay about him.

512
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:23,937
- He knows that. He loves it.
- Get outta here.

513
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:28,305
Larry, Marilyn Monroe was
a huge fan of the "Seinfeld" show.

514
00:32:28,342 --> 00:32:29,673
- What?
- It's true.

515
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,007
- You're kidding.
- No.

516
00:32:31,044 --> 00:32:33,012
She's very much looking
forward to meeting you.

517
00:32:33,046 --> 00:32:35,570
- Get out.
- She talks often of you.

518
00:32:35,615 --> 00:32:38,175
Marilyn Monroe?

519
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:40,344
- It's true, isn't it?
- The truth.

520
00:32:42,388 --> 00:32:44,446
It's your mother, Larry.

521
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:46,650
Say hello
to your mother.

522
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,959
What kind
of schmuck are you?!

523
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:53,691
I mean, who goes around

524
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:55,631
giving their kidney to people?

525
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:58,362
Idiot! And I'm surprised
that your father

526
00:32:58,402 --> 00:33:00,666
let you do such a thing.
Wait till I see him again.

527
00:33:00,704 --> 00:33:03,934
Why did you tell dad not to bother me
when you died? I missed your funeral.

528
00:33:03,973 --> 00:33:06,203
So what?
What's so important?

529
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:08,472
Why were you so happy
when you thought you were adopted?

530
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:09,875
That's what
I wanna know.

531
00:33:09,912 --> 00:33:11,812
- I wasn't happy.
- Oh, don't give me that.

532
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:13,712
- You were very happy.
- I was not happy.

533
00:33:13,749 --> 00:33:16,081
- You were absolutely giddy.
- No, I was not giddy.

534
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:19,518
- Giddy? I was not giddy.
- You were giddy.

535
00:33:19,554 --> 00:33:22,546
I'm not done
with you yet, buster.

536
00:33:24,625 --> 00:33:27,991
Hey, Larry.
Come here.

537
00:33:32,732 --> 00:33:34,495
Ben Hogan.

538
00:33:34,534 --> 00:33:36,559
Yes, sir.

539
00:33:36,603 --> 00:33:39,935
- How you doing?
- Pretty good.

540
00:33:39,972 --> 00:33:42,099
You know, I've been
watching your golf game.

541
00:33:42,141 --> 00:33:44,302
- You've seen me play?
- I have seen you play.

542
00:33:44,343 --> 00:33:47,038
And let me tell you something.
You're moving your feet.

543
00:33:47,078 --> 00:33:48,841
I know, Ben.
I move my feet.

544
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,508
Yeah, you know that sex offender
had a good tip for you.

545
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:53,744
- I know. Dropping the club.
- Dropping your...

546
00:33:53,785 --> 00:33:55,615
I can't do it, Ben.
I can't. I've tried.

547
00:33:55,652 --> 00:33:58,177
Why don't you come out
with me? We'll shoot 18.

548
00:33:58,221 --> 00:33:59,848
I'll show you
how it's done, huh?

549
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,755
- There's golf here?
- Absolutely.

550
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:04,885
We got great
courses up here.

551
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:07,896
- You got a date.
- I'll be waitin' for you.

552
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,663
I'm playing golf
with Ben Hogan.

553
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:16,603
It's called heaven.
Come on.

554
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,538
You guys, you've been
around me my whole life?

555
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,097
- Oh yeah.
- You were at the

556
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,165
spin-the-bottle party
when I ran out when I was 12?

557
00:34:22,209 --> 00:34:23,642
- 'Cause I was...
- We were there.

558
00:34:23,677 --> 00:34:25,474
Yes, I always wanted
to ask you about that.

559
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:27,912
- Why were you so humiliated?
- I felt so humiliated.

560
00:34:27,948 --> 00:34:30,610
- You should've stayed.
- 'Cause I couldn't kiss anybody.

561
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,140
- I was scared.
- Nancy loved you then.

562
00:34:32,185 --> 00:34:34,244
- Let me ask you something.
- Okay.

563
00:34:34,287 --> 00:34:37,450
Did you hear my wife telling me that
I could... she said I could fool around?

564
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,754
- Yes, we heard.
- You heard her say that, right?

565
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:42,726
All right, so, if you go on a date,
where do you go?

566
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:44,695
Are there restaurants?
Are there movies?

567
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:47,665
Like, how does that work?
What do you do here all day?

568
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,825
- Larry, Larry...
- And what about this clothing?

569
00:34:49,867 --> 00:34:53,234
- I need socks and underwear.
- You'll learn all that in due time.

570
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:55,602
- Just be patient.
- I'm just asking a question.

571
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,405
- We understand that.
- So, if you're my guides,

572
00:34:59,442 --> 00:35:02,536
then how come you let me eat those
seven pieces of pizza at camp?

573
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:05,139
- I got sick and had to go home?
- Yes, we remember everything.

574
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:07,149
Yeah, Larry, listen.

575
00:35:07,183 --> 00:35:08,911
We're your guides.

576
00:35:08,951 --> 00:35:11,715
We can't actually control events.

577
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:13,915
When then, what's the point
of the whole thing?

578
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:16,753
I mean, who... why do I even need you?
What does a guide do?

579
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:18,691
I don't even get it.

580
00:35:18,726 --> 00:35:20,660
And what about going
to the bathroom?

581
00:35:20,695 --> 00:35:22,663
Because, I notice
I've been here a while

582
00:35:22,697 --> 00:35:24,858
and frankly I don't
have to do anything.

583
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:27,458
And if that's the case...

584
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:30,402
That's gonna be pretty good.
Pretty good.

585
00:35:30,437 --> 00:35:34,032
- Oh, one more thing.
- Yes, what is it?

586
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:36,234
- The "Sopranos" DVD cover...
- The cover.

587
00:35:36,275 --> 00:35:37,640
Any idea?

588
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,872
Did you look behind
the couch, Larry?

589
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:41,846
- Behind the couch?
- It's behind the couch.

590
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:44,075
Did you once look
behind the couch, Larry?

591
00:35:44,115 --> 00:35:46,174
- You didn't, did you?
- Well, I didn't really look for it.

592
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:48,185
Because you had a system.

593
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:51,450
That's right.
I have a system I take the DVD...

594
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,582
cover and put it
on top of the DVD player.

595
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,685
- Right, exactly.
- That's not a system.

596
00:35:57,728 --> 00:36:00,219
- Oh, is that so?
- A system is...

597
00:36:00,264 --> 00:36:02,595
is that you know you're
gonna misplace the DVD

598
00:36:02,632 --> 00:36:05,123
so you get some
DVD jackets,

599
00:36:05,168 --> 00:36:07,102
just plain ones,
and you have them there

600
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:09,127
in case you lose a...
that's a system.

601
00:36:09,172 --> 00:36:11,071
- That's not a system.
- Keep the jackets in a folder.

602
00:36:11,106 --> 00:36:12,471
- It's a system.
- People misplace DVDs

603
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:15,067
because they take the cover
and put it someplace else.

604
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,578
And the people
that misplace the DVDs

605
00:36:17,612 --> 00:36:20,011
- have extra DVD jackets.
- Whoa, okay.

606
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:22,015
- That's a system.
- No, that's not a system.

607
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:24,347
- Listen to your guide.
- A little bit of respect.

608
00:36:24,385 --> 00:36:27,821
Oh, Mr. Great Guide who let me
do that "TV guide" cover.

609
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,549
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

610
00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:31,614
- Fuck you. Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

611
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:34,627
Okay, all right, okay. Take it easy.
Just come over here and relax.

612
00:36:34,661 --> 00:36:36,856
- What do you mean, relax?
- Okay, come on.

613
00:36:57,914 --> 00:37:00,041
Larry, um...

614
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,643
we've decided that
you're not really ready

615
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:05,984
and we're gonna send you
back into your body.

616
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:08,046
- What?
- We're sending you back.

617
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,422
What, because I said
something about the system?

618
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:13,155
You're just not ready.

619
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:16,129
Okay, maybe it isn't much
of a system. You're right, it's not.

620
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,325
It's a bad system.
It's not a good system.

621
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:19,958
- Goodbye, Larry.
- We're sorry.

622
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:21,468
Come on.
That's not fair.

623
00:37:21,503 --> 00:37:24,437
- Goodbye, Larry.
- Goodbye, Larry.

624
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:26,905
Give me another chance.

625
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,306
Wait wait, I like it here.

626
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:32,869
- Where you goin', Larry?
- Marilyn.

627
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:36,075
I was so looking forward
to meeting you.

628
00:37:36,115 --> 00:37:38,606
I really love
your sense of humor.

629
00:37:38,651 --> 00:37:40,983
- Marilyn!
- Don't go, Larry.

630
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,420
- Marylyn!
- Don't go.

631
00:37:47,526 --> 00:37:49,426
I'm not paying.
I'm not paying.

632
00:37:49,461 --> 00:37:51,724
Look, I'm not paying it.
I'm not.

633
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:53,059
- What?
- Oh my God.

634
00:37:53,097 --> 00:37:55,531
- Larry?
- My God.

635
00:38:00,503 --> 00:38:02,061
Jesus.

636
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,803
Oh my God.

637
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:23,847
You notice
how in the movies

638
00:38:23,891 --> 00:38:26,018
they never fold
when they're packing?

639
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:28,050
They just throw
everything in.

640
00:38:28,094 --> 00:38:30,562
- Hm-mm.
- It's not believable.

641
00:38:30,597 --> 00:38:34,033
- You know?
- It's not interesting to watch, really.

642
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:37,433
Well, still, you have
to pack the right way.

643
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:39,494
People just don't
crumple up their clothes

644
00:38:39,538 --> 00:38:41,369
And throw them in a suitcase.
That's not real.

645
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:43,238
I'm not buying that.

646
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:45,504
You look good.
You do.

647
00:38:45,543 --> 00:38:48,569
- Really?
- Yeah, you look good, you know?

648
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:52,481
You know, I gotta
talk to the doctor.

649
00:38:52,517 --> 00:38:55,576
See if I got some clearance,
some sex clearance.

650
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:58,213
Do you have to get
clearance for that?

651
00:38:58,255 --> 00:38:59,847
I think you do.

652
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,619
Needless to say,
I'm quite prepared.

653
00:39:02,658 --> 00:39:05,058
Okay. All right.

654
00:39:06,629 --> 00:39:09,029
- What a thing, huh?
- Yeah.

655
00:39:09,065 --> 00:39:10,657
How do you feel?

656
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,566
You feel different
after all this?

657
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,162
You know, yeah.

658
00:39:16,204 --> 00:39:19,332
- I mean, come on, I'm a changed man.
- I know.

659
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:22,638
- I'm a completely different person.
- That's true.

660
00:39:22,676 --> 00:39:25,702
- You really feel like that now?
- Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

661
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:27,771
- I know what you mean.
- You know what I mean?

662
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:29,975
- I don't need to say it, right?
- It's good. No no.

663
00:39:30,016 --> 00:39:33,213
- Oh, hey.
- Hey. Your chariot, sir.

664
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:34,914
- What's this?
- Hospital policy.

665
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,615
You get to leave
in a wheelchair.

666
00:39:36,656 --> 00:39:39,215
Hmm, all right.

667
00:39:42,194 --> 00:39:44,185
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

668
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:49,795
Very excited about this.

669
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,296
Hello.

670
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:54,531
- And, uh...
- Hey, you know what?

671
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:57,369
I think maybe I should use
the bathroom before we go.

672
00:39:57,407 --> 00:40:00,171
- Okay.
- Let's try the handicapped.

673
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:03,008
- Larry.
- It's a rare opportunity, come on.

674
00:40:05,482 --> 00:40:07,813
Oh, someone
must be in there.

675
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:12,043
- Hey.
- Hey.

676
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:16,915
What's with
the walking here?

677
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:19,449
I had to use
the bathroom.

678
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:21,325
Okay, I get it.

679
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:24,023
That one was occupied.
I had to duck in here for a second.

680
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,055
It was a bit
of an emergency.

681
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,260
Well then you wait.

682
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:30,964
You wait.
