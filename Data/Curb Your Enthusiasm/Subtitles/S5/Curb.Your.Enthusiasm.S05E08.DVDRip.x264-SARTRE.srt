1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,848


2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,578
Well, thanks...
thanks for coming over.

3
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,675
- Ah, you know, please.
- You've been...

4
00:00:19,718 --> 00:00:22,050
You look fantastic.
Look at you.

5
00:00:22,087 --> 00:00:23,952
- Really?!
- You never looked better in your life.

6
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:26,081
- Oh, thank you.
- You're a lucky man,

7
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:27,455
you're a blessed man.

8
00:00:27,492 --> 00:00:30,290
Well, you know,
I took, uh...

9
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:32,592
I took care of myself.
I was never an alcoholic

10
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,392
or a drug addict.

11
00:00:34,431 --> 00:00:37,491
Never slept with a lot strange women.
Although I wanted to,

12
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:40,332
they wouldn't...
You know...

13
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,394
I need a kidney, man.

14
00:00:42,438 --> 00:00:45,430
Where am I gonna find someone who loves
me enough just to give me a kidney?

15
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:46,805
Come on, you took the test.

16
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:49,332
You're a match.
Are you gonna give me the kidney or not?

17
00:00:49,377 --> 00:00:51,140
- I'm struggling.
- Well, what's wrong with Louis Lewis?

18
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,908
- I mean, he's... he's in this...
- Oh, please.

19
00:00:52,947 --> 00:00:55,278
Coma in the hospital.
How long can he go on?

20
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:57,613
- And he's family.
- He's in a coma.

21
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:59,846
Comas are unpredictable
for Christ's sake.

22
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:01,821
Who the hell
fucking knows?

23
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:03,879
Family.
Fuck family.

24
00:01:03,923 --> 00:01:07,120
You know, and you know what's pissing
me off? I'm so low on that list,

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,424
that kidney transplant list.
It's so unfair.

26
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:12,794
Look at the Mick.
I mean, the Mick... I love the guy,

27
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:15,061
we were friends.
Mantle got his liver just like that...

28
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,964
- boom.
- Yeah. Well,

29
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,969
if you were a little
bigger celebrity,

30
00:01:19,003 --> 00:01:21,597
you'd be on the top
of the list too.

31
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:24,835
Jesus Christ.
By the way, that... see that ball?

32
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:27,741
That's the 500th home run

33
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:28,971
- that the Mick hit.
- Really?

34
00:01:29,012 --> 00:01:31,105
Yeah, I'm leaving it... it's in my will.
It's yours.

35
00:01:31,147 --> 00:01:32,704
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:32,748 --> 00:01:34,215
- It's worth about 20 grand.
- What?

37
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:36,877
And you get the money too.
I'm giving you the bread and the ball.

38
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:39,915
Hey.

39
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:42,218
Hey, remember in camp,
when you used to do...

40
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:44,588
the Mick...
do the Mick rounding the bases.

41
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,455
Yeah.

42
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:48,393
- That's Mickey's run. Yep.
- Huh?

43
00:01:48,428 --> 00:01:49,759
- You look great.
- Mickey Mantle.

44
00:01:49,796 --> 00:01:51,423
Yeah, that's Mantle.

45
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:54,331
- Well, I'm gonna take off.
- When are you coming back?

46
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:55,856
- Yeah, I'll come back.
- Soon?

47
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:57,391
Yeah.

48
00:01:57,436 --> 00:02:00,166
And let me ask you a question:
You like this sweater?

49
00:02:00,206 --> 00:02:01,900
- How's it look?
- You know,

50
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,135
if you're doing an Andy Williams
summer show.

51
00:02:04,175 --> 00:02:06,735
See, you still got
your sense of humor.

52
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:10,474
- You still got it.
- I love you, Larry. I really love you.

53
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:13,108
And if my cousin
stays in that coma,

54
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,243
I'm depending on you.

55
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:17,951
- Hi.
- Hi.

56
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:21,423
- I'm Lisa, his nurse.
- Oh, I'm Larry.

57
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:24,357
It was nice of him
to give you his ball like that.

58
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:26,917
- The ball, yeah... that's was very nice.
- It was very good.

59
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:30,260
- Yeah.
- Hey, I wanted to tell you, you know?

60
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:33,698
We have a mutual acquaintance.
I know Jeff.

61
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:36,601
- You know Jeff?
- I do. Yeah yeah.

62
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:38,399
We actually dated
a little bit.

63
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,497
- Really?!
- Yeah, not too long. But uh...

64
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,940
Wow. So did you have
a good time with him?

65
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:45,034
Well, until things got,
you know, intimate,

66
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:46,977
it was fun.
You know, he's...

67
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:49,947
He's kind of a "slam, bam, thank you,
ma'am" kind of guy, right?

68
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:51,472
- No, not really at all.
- No?

69
00:02:51,517 --> 00:02:52,881
- Oh!
- No. No slamming, no bamming.

70
00:02:52,917 --> 00:02:55,750
No thanking the ma'am.

71
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,651
He's was a little...
it was short lived,

72
00:02:57,688 --> 00:03:00,087
was the problem.

73
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:03,615
He was like that.

74
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,322
I mean, it was dark,
but honest to God

75
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:08,421
it was like that.

76
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:10,295
What, are you kidding?

77
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:12,300
Uh, no, I'm not
kidding.

78
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:15,962
- Jeff?!
- Yeah, very small, very small.

79
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:17,972
- It was like a peanut. That little...
- All right.

80
00:03:18,006 --> 00:03:20,770
This is a very... you know, way too much
information here, okay?

81
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:22,638
I thought you knew...
would've known that.

82
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:24,473
- How can I know such a thing?
- I just would think

83
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:26,342
that that's something
that friends...

84
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,143
men would talk about.

85
00:03:28,182 --> 00:03:30,741
- No, nobody ever talks about that.
- Really?

86
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:32,546
- No.
- Sorry about that.

87
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:35,247
I don't even know
what to say to you, but...

88
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:38,415
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah yeah.

89
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:40,822
- Yeah.
- Huh.

90
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:49,728
Comas are very
unpredictable.

91
00:03:49,767 --> 00:03:52,758
Could wake up in five seconds,
five minutes,

92
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:55,202
five years! You don't know.
You just don't know.

93
00:03:55,238 --> 00:03:57,967
They're unpredictable.

94
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:01,806
- Oh! Didn't even tell you!
- What?

95
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:04,505
Ran into somebody
you went out with.

96
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:07,446
- Oh.
- She's Lewis's nurse.

97
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,915
- Lisa Thompson?
- Yeah. You had a little uh...

98
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:12,316
- A little thing. Yeah.
- A little thing with her, didn't you?

99
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,183
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- Hmm...

100
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:16,587
- Didn't work out.
- Yeah.

101
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,156
She told me
you had...

102
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,355
- uh...
- What?

103
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:28,493
No no no.

104
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,797
- Big vagina?!
- Gigantic vagina!

105
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:33,895
- What?!
- Biggest vagina known to man!

106
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:35,905
- Huge!
- You're kidding.

107
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:40,103
- Are you telling me the truth?
- It's gigantic. Gigantic

108
00:04:40,143 --> 00:04:42,042
So why is she going around
making this accusation?

109
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:43,943
Because maybe she's
afraid that you'll find out

110
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,948
she has a big vagina.
Why would would she even do that?

111
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:47,916
- I don't even know.
- Nipping it in the bud?

112
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,383
How dare she?
I'll tell you what.

113
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:52,943
I bet you there's
a ton of guys out there

114
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,888
who've been labeled
with "small penis."

115
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:56,753
- I bet you 50%...
- It's the vagina, isn't it?

116
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,088
- And it's the big vagina.
- Yeah. Think of it biologically...

117
00:04:59,126 --> 00:05:02,857
why should there be as many big vaginas
as there are small penises, right?

118
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:05,261
These big vagina ladies
are getting away with murder.

119
00:05:05,298 --> 00:05:07,664
Something should be done.
I don't know what can be done,

120
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,691
but something should be done.
Either...

121
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:12,203
We're a hell of lot more
discrete than they are, right?

122
00:05:12,237 --> 00:05:14,364
- They can't do this enough, can they?
- Oh, they love it, they love it.

123
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:16,431
They love this thing.
Well, you know what?

124
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:18,465
This is me from now on.

125
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,905
Yeah.

126
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,914
Hello, Doctor.

127
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,313
Oh. Hi, Doctor.

128
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:31,879
- How's he doing?
- You know how's he doing.

129
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:34,753
I'm on to you,
Mr. David.

130
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,486
- Excuse me.
- The frequent visits,

131
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:39,494
the questions
about organs, come on.

132
00:05:39,528 --> 00:05:42,792
I'm not crazy. I'm chief of staff here.
I know what's going on.

133
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,697
What's going on?

134
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,929
I think you've
been waiting for this man to die

135
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:52,803
so you can get one of his organs,
preferably his kidney,

136
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,204
so you won't have
to give up one,

137
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,209
so that Mr. Lewis
can get it.

138
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:59,234
What kind of person
would do something like that?

139
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:01,802
I think you know what
kind of person would do that, Mr. David.

140
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:03,973
- A kind of person like me?!
- Yes.

141
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:10,052
That's pretty good...
pretty good work.

142
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:12,851
- Thank you, thank you.
- He got me.

143
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,492
Good job, Doctor.
I think you got me.

144
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:19,120
I got ya.

145
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,326
By the way, my in-laws
can't go skiing,

146
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:27,597
so I've got an opening
for you and Cheryl if you want it.

147
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:29,604
- Why would I go skiing?
- Come on.

148
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:32,800
No, it's a big schlep.
Hey...

149
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:37,306
isn't that George Lopez?

150
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:40,245
- He had a kidney transplant.
- Right. Right right right right.

151
00:06:41,915 --> 00:06:44,076
- Huh?
- Get some inside information?

152
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:49,645
- Hey, George.
- How're you doing?

153
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:51,315
- Good. How are you?
- Good, brother.

154
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:53,256
- This is Jeff Greene, my manager.
- How are you?

155
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,451
Hey, Jeff.
George Lopez.

156
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:56,016
- Pleasure.
- How's it going?

157
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,460
Good. Feel great,
better than I have ever in my life.

158
00:06:58,496 --> 00:06:59,793
- Really?
- Yeah.

159
00:06:59,831 --> 00:07:01,764
I had a kidney transplant.
My wife gave it to me.

160
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:03,789
Changed my whole life, man.
I mean, without it,

161
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:05,802
I don't even know if I'd be alive,
to tell you the truth.

162
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:07,894
You know, uh,
Richard Lewis needs one.

163
00:07:07,937 --> 00:07:10,269
- I didn't know that. Poor Richard.
- Yeah, yeah.

164
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:12,240
Wow. Well, he's got to go to his family
or his friends.

165
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:13,639
Somebody's gotta
step up.

166
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:15,700
- Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
- Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

167
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:18,008
- That's true.
- Like a five-year waiting list.

168
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:21,015
So what do you think he should do?
'Cause he's on the bottom of the list.

169
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:23,312
Well, if you're the bottom
of the list, you're fucked.

170
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,615
- Wow.
- But you know what?

171
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:32,752
Like, I've heard that the guy who's
the head of the kidney consortium

172
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,124
- can be gotten to.
- Really?

173
00:07:35,161 --> 00:07:38,061
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, he really
takes care of his friends.

174
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:41,759
Buddy up to him.
Kiss his ass. Who knows?

175
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,529
Probably move
Richard up the list.

176
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:45,330
- Really?
- Wow.

177
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:47,200
- All right, I got to get blood drawn.
- Thanks, George.

178
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:49,729
- Nice meeting you. Take care, dude.
- Nice meeting you, George.

179
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,673
- Take care.
- Oh, hey, George. What's his name?

180
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,074
Ben Heineman.

181
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,477
- With an E or a Y?
- With an E.

182
00:08:00,883 --> 00:08:02,407
Hey, Mr. Jones.

183
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:05,284
There's actually something else
you could do for me too.

184
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,287
- Really?
- It's unrelated to the adoption.

185
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,551
I need some information
about a Ben Heineman.

186
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11,057
"Ben Heineman."

187
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:13,753
- He's head of the kidney consortium.
- Okay.

188
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,729
Anything you can find out about his guy
would be fantastic...

189
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:19,459
- H-E-l-N-E-M-A-N.
- Yeah, I got it.

190
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,796
Well, "Heineman" could be spelled
a couple different ways.

191
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,301
- Hi.
- Hey.

192
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,802
- Oh, this is my wife.
- I'm Cheryl.

193
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,566
This is Omar Jones,
private investigator.

194
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:28,196
Oh, right.

195
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,570
He's working on the whole
adoption thing.

196
00:08:29,607 --> 00:08:31,632
- Right.
- I'm making some great headway also.

197
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:33,837
- Oh, fantastic.
- Okay, couple of weeks,

198
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:35,674
you should know
something very definitive.

199
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:37,771
- Great, okay.
- Enjoy your day.

200
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:39,442
- Thank you. You too.
- Thank you.

201
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,678
- You're welcome.
- I, uh...

202
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:43,241
I got you something.

203
00:08:43,286 --> 00:08:46,778
- Wow! New jacket?
- It's nice, right? Yeah.

204
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:50,189
- Yes, I needed this.
- You're gonna need it when we go skiing

205
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,090
- with Susie and Jeff.
- Skiing? Are you kidding?

206
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:53,719
Come on, that's out.
I nixed that.

207
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:55,696
Look, you don't
have to ski.

208
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,629
You can sit inside
and enjoy the snow.

209
00:08:57,665 --> 00:08:59,223
I'm not going up to that lodge.
Come on, man.

210
00:08:59,266 --> 00:09:01,996
- Why?
- Too much schlepping. I'm not...

211
00:09:02,036 --> 00:09:04,765
He left something.
What is this?

212
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:10,739
"Edible Undies"?

213
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:13,336
Oh, dear.

214
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:33,520
Okay, Big Yankee fan.
He's an orthodox Jew.

215
00:09:33,562 --> 00:09:35,462
All right,
what else you got?

216
00:09:35,498 --> 00:09:38,023
Drives a gold Cadillac.

217
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:41,763
License plate number
2-F-A-N-3-2-1.

218
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:44,169
Okay, thank you.

219
00:09:45,907 --> 00:09:47,703
- Hey.
- Hey.

220
00:09:47,741 --> 00:09:50,073
So Omar Jones

221
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,634
- the private investigator?
- Yeah?

222
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:54,647
He got me information
about the head of the kidney consortium.

223
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:56,238
- Guess what?
- What?

224
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:58,341
- He's an orthodox Jew.
- You're kidding.

225
00:09:58,384 --> 00:10:01,376
No. So...

226
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,353
what needs to be
done here is

227
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:06,653
that I need to somehow
befriend this guy.

228
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:10,353
I need to get close
to him quickly.

229
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:12,794
- Right?
- Yeah. How're you gonna do that?

230
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,822
- If I could save his life or something.
- Uh-huh.

231
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,060
You know, like...
bad example, okay? Not this.

232
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,592
You know, you pushed
him off a building.

233
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:22,332
- I push him off the building.
- And I saved him.

234
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,236
- And you would catch him.
- And I catch him.

235
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:26,332
- Yeah?
- He would be indebted to me for life.

236
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,002
- Yeah.
- He would do anything I asked him,

237
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:30,238
like put my friend on the top
of the kidney list.

238
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,838
And at no point, he says to you,
"Hey, what about the fat guy

239
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,508
that just threw me off the roof?"
That would never come up.

240
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,780
No. I said it's bad version.
You know, bad version.

241
00:10:37,818 --> 00:10:40,285
- Really bad version.
- But I need to save his life.

242
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,220
- Something like that.
- Yeah yeah.

243
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:45,315
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

244
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:48,155
Well...

245
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:53,263
- this isn't bad.
- What?

246
00:11:01,805 --> 00:11:03,397
- That's it.
- The Cadillac?

247
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,998
Gold... the gold Cadillac.
See it?

248
00:11:05,042 --> 00:11:08,875
- Uh-huh.
- Go check the license.

249
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:10,902
Yeah, that's it.

250
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:15,415
Ready?

251
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,974
Yeah, as ready
as I'm gonna be.

252
00:11:17,018 --> 00:11:18,815
Whenever you want,
go ahead.

253
00:11:18,853 --> 00:11:21,549
- This is crazy. Let's go.
- All right.

254
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:26,317
- Oh.
- All right. Look...

255
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:36,226
- It's like you didn't even hit it.
- Let's try it again.

256
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:38,293
You try it again.
I don't want whiplash.

257
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:41,795
No.
You do it.

258
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,899
- Keep a lookout.
- I'm keeping a lookout.

259
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:51,708
- Anybody coming?
- No, we're fine.

260
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,550
Oh my God.

261
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:06,424
Here, come on.
Be careful.

262
00:12:08,229 --> 00:12:10,129
Oh my God.

263
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:12,826
Are you all right?

264
00:12:12,867 --> 00:12:15,232
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I think I'm okay.

265
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,135
Holy shit, it's all over your glasses,
your whole face.

266
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,662
Oh my God.

267
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,799
- Oh, there. You did it.
- It worked.

268
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,867
Yes.

269
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,641
All right, good. Let's get out of here.
Come on.

270
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:43,590
- Mr...
- Mr. David?

271
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:46,595
- Mr. Heineman.
- How are you, sir?

272
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:49,598
What a great great
pleasure to meet you.

273
00:12:49,632 --> 00:12:51,292
Well, it's nice to meet you.

274
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,699
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

275
00:12:53,735 --> 00:12:56,863
- So?
- I'm sorry I'm a little late,

276
00:12:56,905 --> 00:12:58,963
- uh, you know...
- It's not a big problem.

277
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:00,906
Yeah.

278
00:13:04,944 --> 00:13:08,277
What a mitzvah it was
for you to leave that note on my car.

279
00:13:08,314 --> 00:13:10,646
Well, how could I do
anything less that that?

280
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:13,743
I'd have to be a sociopath to hit
somebody's car

281
00:13:13,786 --> 00:13:16,914
and then, and then go away into
the night as if nothing happened.

282
00:13:16,955 --> 00:13:19,923
- Thank you, thank you.
- What happened,

283
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:21,925
I was listening
to Jewish radio

284
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,927
and they were talking
about Israel

285
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:26,895
and I got so worked up
I lost control of my car.

286
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,761
- May I offer you some lunch?
- Please.

287
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,131
Morty, menus, please.

288
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:33,102
It's kosher, you know that.

289
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,797
Oh. Let's see,
wait a second.

290
00:13:35,838 --> 00:13:38,329
Hello?

291
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:42,469
No no no no no. Uh, thank you,
thank you for that invitation,

292
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,241
but I cannot go to the baseball game
on the Sabbath,

293
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:48,510
I'm sorry.
It's impossible.

294
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:51,313
I'll take a rain check,
however.

295
00:13:51,351 --> 00:13:53,649
Ho ho ho ho,
okay.

296
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,022
I'd love to go to the game,
but not on the Sabbath.

297
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,990
The Yankees are playing
and I would...

298
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:00,959
- I would kill to go down there.
- You're a Yankee fan.

299
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:03,961
Oh, I'm a Yankee fan...
I'm a huge Yankee fan.

300
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:07,829
- I love the Yankees.
- You love the Yankees?!

301
00:14:07,866 --> 00:14:10,164
There's so many times when the Yankees
were playing in Anaheim

302
00:14:10,202 --> 00:14:11,998
that I've so much
wanted to go to see it.

303
00:14:12,036 --> 00:14:14,504
I even cheat by watching it on
television. I shouldn't do that.

304
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,132
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Shh.

305
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:26,139
There are two things
in my life that I love.

306
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:29,048
Besides family
and my work

307
00:14:29,084 --> 00:14:31,052
- I love baseball. Love baseball.
- Uh-huh.

308
00:14:31,086 --> 00:14:32,746
...especially Yankees.
I love to ski.

309
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,888
My yarmulke almost fell off,
I'm so taken aback.

310
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,654
- What?
- Skiing. You said "skiing"?

311
00:14:40,694 --> 00:14:43,128
- Yeah. I'm not that good, but I like...
- I'm not so good myself,

312
00:14:43,163 --> 00:14:45,028
- but I love it.
- You love it?

313
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:47,294
Oh... my favorite thing
to do in life.

314
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,268
Isn't that
a wonderful coincidence?

315
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:55,431
- I have a little ski lodge.
- Really?

316
00:14:55,473 --> 00:14:58,965
Yes. I would love
to invite you

317
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,672
- to go skiing
- My goodness, what a wonderful gesture.

318
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:07,375
- Hello.
- Hello.

319
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,940
- Welcome back.
- So...

320
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:11,647
you know, I spoke
to our mutual friend.

321
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:13,780
- Oh, good. Did you say hello for me?
- I did.

322
00:15:13,823 --> 00:15:15,916
- Oh, great, thank you.
- I did say hello,

323
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,656
and I couldn't help
but mention the...

324
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:24,562
the whole kind of small penis thing.
It came out.

325
00:15:24,598 --> 00:15:27,829
- Oh my gosh, was he upset?
- Not at all, not at all.

326
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:29,392
- No.
- Really?

327
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:33,303
In fact, he had a completely different
take on it than you.

328
00:15:34,908 --> 00:15:38,604
He said the problem didn't lie
with his small penis,

329
00:15:38,644 --> 00:15:40,635
but rather...

330
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,670
with your big vagina.

331
00:15:46,117 --> 00:15:48,108
- Is that what he did?!
- Yeah.

332
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,951
- Big.
- This is my vagina?

333
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:53,820
Huge. Huge.

334
00:15:53,857 --> 00:15:56,018
Are you kidding?
I don't have a big vagina.

335
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,254
- You got the huge vagina.
- Oh, do I?

336
00:15:58,295 --> 00:16:00,125
- You're blaming the small penis,
- Yeah...

337
00:16:00,162 --> 00:16:03,063
you got the huge vagina.
It's not necessary.

338
00:16:03,098 --> 00:16:05,396
I made a little...
you're the one that egged it...

339
00:16:05,434 --> 00:16:07,594
Methinks the lady doth
protest too much.

340
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:10,069
Hm.

341
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:15,930
This guy is the head of the whole
kidney consortium.

342
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,877
I can get you to the top of the list.
I'm not kidding.

343
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:21,812
I got him eating out of my hand.
He's going skiing with me.

344
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,975
Holy shit. That would
be unbelievable!

345
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:25,847
You know what
would really cinch it?

346
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:27,853
He's a Yankee fan...
big Mickey Mantle fan.

347
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:29,854
Let me give him
the Mickey Mantle ball.

348
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:33,085
You're out of your fucking mind?
You don't want it?

349
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:34,921
- I'm nuts?
- You don't want it anymore?

350
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,120
Give that guy the Mickey Mantle ball,
it's done, it's over.

351
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:39,254
All right, give it to him.
Give it to him.

352
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:45,292
- Hey.
- What?

353
00:16:45,335 --> 00:16:48,395
- Where's the ball?
- I don't know.

354
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:50,406
What? Look,
maybe it rolled off.

355
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,236
Look behind the picture.

356
00:16:52,274 --> 00:16:54,333
- Is it there?
- No.

357
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:56,571
- You're kidding me.
- No.

358
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:58,738
Jesus Christ.

359
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,747
Oh, Mickey.

360
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:02,976
Goddamn it!

361
00:17:03,017 --> 00:17:05,008
- Oh, shit.
- Who's been here?

362
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:09,249
"Who's been here?" Lisa, the nurse,
a couple of close friends and you.

363
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:10,984
It's no way my friends are gonna
take anything,

364
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:13,355
and her... I see her leave
with the same uniform.

365
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:15,986
She has no pockets. I mean, if she,
if she hid a ball in there,

366
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:18,019
it would look like
an elephant tumor.

367
00:17:19,031 --> 00:17:20,520
Unless...

368
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,590
Oh, hey.

369
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:27,704
There was
a Mickey Mantle ball,

370
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:30,036
his 500th home run

371
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:32,132
right over over there,

372
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:35,166
and it's missing.

373
00:17:35,211 --> 00:17:39,477
- Have you seen it?
- No, I have not.

374
00:17:39,515 --> 00:17:43,143
Hmm, it's kind of curious,
given that...

375
00:17:43,184 --> 00:17:46,779
nobody else has been in the house,
save for a few friends.

376
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:55,618
Could a ball worth
an excess of $20,000

377
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:58,460
just disappear
into thin air?

378
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,733
Wanna tell me
what you're driving at?

379
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:04,895
I'll tell you
what I'm driving at.

380
00:18:04,937 --> 00:18:07,531
I submit you took
that baseball,

381
00:18:07,572 --> 00:18:10,666
stashed it in your
unusually large vagina,

382
00:18:10,709 --> 00:18:12,835
and walked right on
out of here!

383
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,180
- Let me tell you something.
- Yeah?

384
00:18:21,217 --> 00:18:23,048
- This bread...
- Good bread, right?

385
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:25,213
My second piece...
I'm surprised you're even letting me.

386
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:26,744
The bread and the croutons.

387
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:28,654
Hey, by the way, have you
seen my cell phone?

388
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,249
- No.
- No?

389
00:18:30,292 --> 00:18:32,351
- You can't find it?
- No.

390
00:18:32,394 --> 00:18:34,258
- No, it's gone.
- We'll look again when we get home.

391
00:18:34,295 --> 00:18:37,924
Oh, remember?

392
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:41,059
- You invited me to the ski lodge?
- Yeah.

393
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:43,069
- I've changed my mind.
- Gonna go?

394
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:45,162
- Really?
- We... I'd like to go.

395
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:48,298
- Great. Oh that'll be great.
- You didn't tell me that.

396
00:18:48,341 --> 00:18:50,707
We're gonna have
a great time skiing, snowboarding maybe.

397
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,870
- I would love to try snowboarding.
- Yeah, I'm gonna try it.

398
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:55,277
- I'm gonna take a lesson.
- Yes, we'll take a lesson.

399
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:57,304
- That's good.
- That's fun. You'll like that.

400
00:18:57,349 --> 00:18:59,442
- Oh my gosh.
- I'm not gonna snowboard.

401
00:18:59,484 --> 00:19:02,509
- That's okay.
- Oh, and I hope you don't mind,

402
00:19:02,553 --> 00:19:04,680
but, ahem...
I've also

403
00:19:04,722 --> 00:19:06,690
taken the liberty,
with your permission,

404
00:19:06,724 --> 00:19:09,624
of inviting an orthodox
Jew and his daughter.

405
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:13,220
Wait, what do you mean, an orthodox...
an orthodox Jew and his daughter?

406
00:19:13,262 --> 00:19:15,127
Where? To stay
in the chalet with us?

407
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:16,324
- Okay.
- The guy?

408
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:18,026
- The guy, yeah.
- What guy?

409
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:22,002
Okay, he's the head
of the kidney consortium

410
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,699
and I'm trying to get
Richard Lewis moved up on the list.

411
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,868
Let's be realistic. You're trying to get
Lewis moved up on the list

412
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,467
or you're trying
to save your own kidney?

413
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:34,037
- What's the difference?
- Let's be clear on what it's about.

414
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,548
- I don't wanna give him my own kidney.
- I don't know if I want

415
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,312
to spend a weekend
with these people.

416
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:40,545
Forget the whole thing.
I don't want my kidney.

417
00:19:40,586 --> 00:19:42,713
- You know what? You...
- He can have my kidney!

418
00:19:42,755 --> 00:19:44,985
I'll walk around with a dialysis
machine. That will be fine!

419
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:48,823
- That's fine. Don't worry about it.
- If you gotta do it,

420
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,852
- you gotta do it. It is okay. Fine.
- Thank you. Thank you.

421
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,624
We don't have a choice.
You invited them.

422
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:56,029
We don't have a choice,
but it's a mitzvah.

423
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:57,795
You spend time with them.

424
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,802
I'm not going to hang
out with them all day.

425
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,496
Unfortunately, that's not

426
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:04,005
- the worst of the situation.
- What?

427
00:20:09,511 --> 00:20:11,206
She's a wonderful cook,
isn't she?

428
00:20:11,246 --> 00:20:13,214
- My Susie?
- My pleasure.

429
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:17,616
- Isn't she? Isn't she some cook?
- How did you two meet?

430
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:20,950
- Interesting, interesting.
- Uh, we met at a Hillel...

431
00:20:20,988 --> 00:20:23,285
- mixer, a function.
- Oh, in college?

432
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,816
Yes, a singles and he was there trying
to pick up every girl imaginable.

433
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,453
- I was pretty swinging in those days.
- Yes.

434
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,725
I was in the band, okay?

435
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,790
The girls were pretty
interested, you know?

436
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,562
With the guitar,
they liked that.

437
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:39,569
- Not true, not true.
- Like a rock band?

438
00:20:39,603 --> 00:20:42,037
- Jewish folk music, Jewish folk songs.
- Folk, folk.

439
00:20:42,073 --> 00:20:46,338
- Like what songs?
- Um, "Gefilte Fish Blues"...

440
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:49,539
Um, "My Freaking Back
is Killing Me and

441
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:51,547
It's Making It
Hard to Kvell"...

442
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:55,414
- Uh, what was the name of your band?
- "The Hipsters."

443
00:20:55,451 --> 00:20:57,351
Yes, it was
"The Hipsters."

444
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,182
- "Larry David and The Hipsters."
- Yeah.

445
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,847
And then,
I left The Hipsters,

446
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:02,913
- and I just became Larry David.
- Larry David.

447
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,788
And The Hipsters
went out on their own.

448
00:21:04,826 --> 00:21:07,521
- And they became quite successful.
- Yes.

449
00:21:07,561 --> 00:21:10,223
But I wasn't attracted to him
from the band.

450
00:21:10,263 --> 00:21:12,754
- Honestly, I felt sorry for him.
- Why?

451
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,232
That's was the...

452
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:18,168
It was an attraction out of pity
'cause I'm always the one

453
00:21:18,204 --> 00:21:19,933
to take in stray animals,
you know, that's...

454
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:21,871
You remind me
a little of my wife...

455
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,898
- Oh, how lovely.
- I'd like to meet her at some point.

456
00:21:24,943 --> 00:21:27,605
Well, she's passed away
a number of years ago.

457
00:21:27,645 --> 00:21:29,874
- Six years.
- Six years? Difficult.

458
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,280
- Eh...
- Very.

459
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,511
So, anyway,
enough about us.

460
00:21:37,553 --> 00:21:41,353
- What do you do?
- I'm the head of a foundation

461
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:44,620
that finds kidneys
for...

462
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,752
- needy recipients.
- Global.

463
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:51,128
A very, very dear friend of mine
actually...

464
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:53,065
- Needs a kidney.
- Needs a kidneys and he's...

465
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,227
he's on the bottom
of the list, Richard Lewis,

466
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,634
- perhaps you heard?
- Yes, I have.

467
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,230
- Wonderful comedian.
- Wears black all the time.

468
00:22:00,273 --> 00:22:02,207
- Yes, yeah.
- I would give him my own kidney,

469
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:04,574
if only we were a match,
but unfortunately...

470
00:22:04,611 --> 00:22:07,101
- that's alas, that is not the case.
- That's God's will.

471
00:22:07,146 --> 00:22:08,613
Of course.

472
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:12,910
Excuse me?

473
00:23:13,503 --> 00:23:15,528
What the fuck?
What are you doing?!

474
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:17,732
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm not doing anything.

475
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,570
- What are you doing in bed with me?
- My back hurts.

476
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,576
I don't give a shit.
Do you think I care about your back?

477
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:24,101
You know how much I've done
for you this weekend?

478
00:23:24,146 --> 00:23:25,476
- Get the fuck out of bed.
- It's cold.

479
00:23:25,513 --> 00:23:26,707
Get the fuck
out of bed!

480
00:23:39,725 --> 00:23:42,023
- What's that smell?
- What? Eggs.

481
00:23:42,061 --> 00:23:44,256
What?! Bacon?!

482
00:23:44,296 --> 00:23:46,264
What, are you crazy?
You're making bacon?!

483
00:23:46,298 --> 00:23:47,764
- Why?
- Why?

484
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:50,563
- What?
- Huh?

485
00:23:50,602 --> 00:23:53,435
People don't eat bacon.
What, are you nuts?

486
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:54,960
It's not kosher.
People... kosher,

487
00:23:55,005 --> 00:23:57,530
- you know what that is.
- Well, they don't have to eat it.

488
00:23:58,542 --> 00:24:00,305
How did you do
last night?

489
00:24:01,777 --> 00:24:03,335
I did fine.
How did you do?

490
00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:05,711
I missed you, honey.

491
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:08,546
I missed you too.

492
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:10,642
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

493
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:12,983
- Good morning.
- Uh, were these not the plates

494
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:14,716
we ate the pot roast on
last night?

495
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:18,247
They are the same plates,
but they've been washed.

496
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,227
I shouldn't be having dairy
on these kind of plates.

497
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:24,128
You know, as you know, the dairy
and the meat are on two separate plates.

498
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,790
That's a necessary rule
of being kosher.

499
00:24:25,832 --> 00:24:28,562
Where are the milchig plates?
Where are they?

500
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:30,228
- The milchig plates!
- Where are they?

501
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:33,568
The milchig plates...
well, they should be in the cabinet.

502
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,973
You were told about
the milchig plates, were you not?

503
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,500
Okay.
Well, I'm sorry about the uh...

504
00:24:40,544 --> 00:24:43,240
That's fine, I have to bury the plate
and we'll be done with it.

505
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:45,441
- You're gonna do what?
- You have to bury the plate.

506
00:24:45,482 --> 00:24:48,110
Why would you bury a plate?

507
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:55,423
Why would you
bury a plate?

508
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:57,755
Tell her.

509
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:00,158
You have to bury the plate to purify it.
It has to go underground.

510
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:03,186
- Purify, you have to purify.
- I'm sure you have a whole set of china

511
00:25:03,231 --> 00:25:04,721
- in your backyard.
- You can't just wash it

512
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:08,030
- and call it a day?
- Uh, no we can't.

513
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:10,229
- I guess we'll starve tonight.
- No, no, you can't wash it

514
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,104
and call it a day, no.
That's not how it works.

515
00:25:14,141 --> 00:25:15,903
Do you wanna bury it
as the man of the house?

516
00:25:15,941 --> 00:25:18,637
Nah, you bury.
You bury, you bury.

517
00:25:18,678 --> 00:25:20,646
It's a little
early for burying.

518
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,978
I don't like to bury
before coffee.

519
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:26,415
- Do I smell bacon?
- Bacon?

520
00:25:26,451 --> 00:25:28,544
- Well...
- No. Oh, I was a little gassy.

521
00:25:28,586 --> 00:25:30,382
I lit a match.

522
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:35,419
You are a guest
in this house.

523
00:25:39,629 --> 00:25:41,722
Larry, come on.

524
00:25:58,912 --> 00:26:00,903
Larry.

525
00:26:09,888 --> 00:26:12,448
Get off my skis.

526
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,327
- How about coming for one more run?
- Oh, sweetheart,

527
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:27,427
- I'm finished.
- Come on, we have time for one more.

528
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,132
- Whoa-ho. Hey hey hey hey hey.
- Hey hey hey.

529
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,402
- New world record.
- Whoa.

530
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:33,999
- Hello, Ben.
- Hello...

531
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:36,010
- Hello, Rachel.
- Hi, Larry.

532
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:38,808
- Boy, that was hard.
- Huh?

533
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,145
- How much fun is this?
- I'm having a good time.

534
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,014
- Isn't this fun?
- But I'm going home because I'm bushed.

535
00:26:44,051 --> 00:26:46,315
- I'm gonna go for another run.
- Go go, sweetheart, go.

536
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:47,786
- All right.
- Why don't you go with her?

537
00:26:47,821 --> 00:26:49,344
- You got time for one more run.
- One more?

538
00:26:49,389 --> 00:26:51,254
- Go ahead.
- One more run. Okay.

539
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,281
- I'm just gonna go back.
- No, there's time.

540
00:26:53,326 --> 00:26:55,294
No no, we're losing time.
No no, it's fine. I'm tired.

541
00:26:55,328 --> 00:26:57,158
- One more run.
- One more.

542
00:26:57,195 --> 00:26:58,856
We'll do one more.
Rachel, uh...

543
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:01,866
He'll keep you company.

544
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:06,332
Larry, incidentally, the thing we were
discussing earlier.

545
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:09,965
I'm thinking about it, and I think
I can actually help your friend.

546
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:14,541
I think I can
move him up on the list.

547
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:18,113
I'm fainting.
I'm gonna faint.

548
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:20,240
- Well, don't do that.
- I'm going to faint.

549
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:22,944
It's a pleasure
to do it for you.

550
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:25,851
I know where you're going...
When he dies...

551
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:28,822
right, right upstairs
he's going. Right upstairs.

552
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,017
- God bless you.
- You're taking an escalator up there.

553
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:33,582
God bless you.
Now you two kids go. Go ski.

554
00:27:33,627 --> 00:27:36,994
Rachel, come.
Come.

555
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:49,832
What do people have
against whistlers?

556
00:27:49,874 --> 00:27:52,843
- Can you answer me this question?
- I think it's annoying.

557
00:27:52,877 --> 00:27:56,073
I think it's 'cause
they don't like to see people happy.

558
00:27:56,113 --> 00:27:58,479
And who can blame them?
It's like a happy couple.

559
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:01,609
Is there anything
more disgusting than that?

560
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,950
You know what I find
very interesting?

561
00:28:04,987 --> 00:28:07,512
I can't draw
to save my life,

562
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:10,081
but yet, I'm a very
good doodler.

563
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,093
Don't you think
that's ironic?

564
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:13,924
It's somewhat ironic.

565
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:15,759
Hey, when we get
back to the lodge,

566
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:18,321
how about you and I having
a doodling contest, huh?

567
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:21,732
- What do you say?
- I'm feeling nauseous right now.

568
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,899
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding me.

569
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:29,738
- What's going on?
- Don't worry.

570
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:32,005
It happens all the time.

571
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:36,711
Should only be
a few minutes.

572
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:52,061
It's been 15 minutes
already.

573
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:53,459
What's going on?

574
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:56,863
Shkiyas Hachama.
That's what's going on.

575
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:00,960
- What?
- Shkiyas Hachama.

576
00:29:01,002 --> 00:29:02,663
Sundown.

577
00:29:02,704 --> 00:29:06,333
I can't be here alone with you
after sundown.

578
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:08,637
- Why not?
- Because you're a man

579
00:29:08,675 --> 00:29:10,575
and I'm a single woman.

580
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:14,980
- So?
- So it's not allowed.

581
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:17,175
- Who says so?
- The Law, the Torah says so.

582
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:19,707
- Hashem says so.
- Hashem?

583
00:29:19,752 --> 00:29:22,414
- Do you know anything?
- No, Hashem, I know.

584
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:25,423
Anyway, it's okay. There's extenuating
circumstances here.

585
00:29:25,457 --> 00:29:28,449
No such thing
as extenuating circumstances.

586
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:31,586
Well, you got
another half hour.

587
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,598
- 5:41. Shkiyas Hachama is at 5:41.
- All right.

588
00:29:34,632 --> 00:29:36,327
- Well, that's a half hour.
- Fine.

589
00:29:36,367 --> 00:29:38,891
They'll fix it.

590
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:55,475
Freezing!

591
00:29:57,518 --> 00:29:59,951
I'm hungry too.

592
00:29:59,986 --> 00:30:03,820
- You hungry?
- Yes, I'm very hungry.

593
00:30:10,062 --> 00:30:12,087
What the heck is this?

594
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,259
Hey!

595
00:30:18,303 --> 00:30:20,863
Edible underwear!

596
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,464
I must... the private
investigator...

597
00:30:23,507 --> 00:30:27,034
when I went...
unreal!

598
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,779
They're not bad.

599
00:30:41,823 --> 00:30:43,449
- How much time do we have left...
- Want some?

600
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,548
- No, thank you.
- Take a bite.

601
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,059
- I'm fine.
- Take a bite.

602
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,152
Move that away from me.

603
00:30:52,632 --> 00:30:55,328
Just tell me how much time
we have left.

604
00:30:55,368 --> 00:30:59,269
Well, I think you got
about two minutes.

605
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:05,799
Somebody's gonna
have to jump.

606
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:07,834
- Oh, stop.
- Stop what?

607
00:31:07,878 --> 00:31:09,607
I can't be here
with you after sundown!

608
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:11,615
There's no other way.
Somebody's gonna have to jump!

609
00:31:11,649 --> 00:31:15,084
You're gonna have
to jump!

610
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:17,143
Are you gonna jump?

611
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:21,479
What, are you
fucking nuts?

612
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:25,690
What?

613
00:31:25,728 --> 00:31:27,456
What are you doing?

614
00:31:28,463 --> 00:31:29,691
- No.
- Hold my phone.

615
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:32,723
Are you crazy?
Are you insane?

616
00:31:57,488 --> 00:31:59,285
- Yeah?
- Hey, Richard. It's me.

617
00:31:59,323 --> 00:32:01,553
- Yeah, hi, Larry.
- Listen,

618
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:02,957
what I told you
earlier about the kidney?

619
00:32:02,993 --> 00:32:05,222
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's not gonna happen.

620
00:32:05,261 --> 00:32:06,990
You're shitting me.
Why not?!

621
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,930
Uh, I can't go
into it right now,

622
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:10,795
but trust me, it's just...
it's not gonna work out.

623
00:32:10,832 --> 00:32:12,891
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, listen,

624
00:32:12,934 --> 00:32:15,402
did I leave my cell phone
in your house?

625
00:32:15,437 --> 00:32:17,064
I, I, I don't know.
"Did you leave"...

626
00:32:17,105 --> 00:32:19,368
Did Larry David leave his cell phone
in the house?

627
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:21,307
- No.
- No.

628
00:32:21,342 --> 00:32:23,936
I'm gonna call my cell phone.
If you hear it ringing,

629
00:32:23,978 --> 00:32:27,208
- pick it up, okay?
- Fine, fine.
