1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,275


2
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:23,902
How do those
feel to you?

3
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:25,969
Well, they feel
pretty good.

4
00:00:26,012 --> 00:00:27,877
I kinda like
these orthotics.

5
00:00:27,914 --> 00:00:31,178
Yeah, they're really
going to help.

6
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:35,147
Boy, they sure
make a lot of noise.

7
00:00:35,187 --> 00:00:37,655
They take a while
to work in.

8
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,161
Ah, Jesús!

9
00:00:53,503 --> 00:00:55,266
How are you?

10
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,303
- Everything okay?
- Si.

11
00:00:58,342 --> 00:01:01,277
Yeah? You seem
a little down.

12
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,336
- No, l-I okay.
- You okay?

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,506
- Si.
- Can you do me a favor?

14
00:01:05,548 --> 00:01:07,573
Small favor, okay?

15
00:01:07,616 --> 00:01:10,244
Small favor...
it's hardly even a favor.

16
00:01:10,286 --> 00:01:12,277
You work here, actually,
so it's part of your job.

17
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:14,016
Either way, it's still
a favor. Okay.

18
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:17,582
So I got, uh...
see this thing?

19
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,252
It's a Mezuzah.

20
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:22,058
Got that?
And I need you

21
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:25,191
to put it
over the door here.

22
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,360
This is like
a Jewish thing.

23
00:01:27,402 --> 00:01:29,631
You know, we put it
over the door

24
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:32,969
so every anti-Semite in the neighborhood
will know that we live here

25
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:34,941
in case they wanna
burn down the house.

26
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,910
Anyway, you just need a nail.
Get a nail, hammer and a nail,

27
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:40,174
- put it up.
- Si, Mezuzah.

28
00:01:40,213 --> 00:01:42,909
Yeah, Mezuzah. I don't... I don't know
what it does, really.

29
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:45,474
But anyway, because my father's
coming to visit,

30
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:47,782
he'll be upset
if he doesn't see it up there.

31
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,288
He's a little hard-of-hearing,
so when you talk to him,

32
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:52,347
talk loud.
He's losing his hearing.

33
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:54,086
- Okay?
- Okay.

34
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,684
So you just speak up
a little bit...

35
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:57,194
"Hello, hello?"

36
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,719
- You know.
- "Hello?

37
00:01:58,764 --> 00:02:01,631
- Hello?"
- Yeah, "How do you feel, Mr. David?"

38
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,495
"How do you feel,
Mr. David?"

39
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:07,697
That's good.
That's good, Jesús.

40
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:11,230
By the way, Jesús...
Jesus... either one?

41
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:13,641
Either one, si.
It's okay.

42
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:15,645
- Same thing.
- Si.

43
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,578
Okay, okay.

44
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:19,844
- I do Mezuzah.
- Okay, great.

45
00:02:19,883 --> 00:02:23,444
What ha... what happened
to your leg?

46
00:02:23,486 --> 00:02:26,717
It hurts on the bottom
of my feet.

47
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:28,689
I have the exact
same thing!

48
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:31,158
Do you want your life
changed, Jesus?

49
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,161
Huh? Okay.

50
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,561
See this?
It's called an orthotic.

51
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,531
Just put 'em in the bottom
of your shoe,

52
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:39,693
and that's it.

53
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:41,463
No no no,
I do the Mezuzah...

54
00:02:41,502 --> 00:02:43,595
Huh?

55
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:45,265
- Try them on!
- Tell them, Maria.

56
00:02:45,306 --> 00:02:47,467
Honey, what could it hurt?

57
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,066
It make you
feel better.

58
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,601
- Okay.
- All right, okay, there you go.

59
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:54,978
- Okay.
- It's a good idea. Gracias, Mr. Larry.

60
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:57,745
- De nada.
- Thank you.

61
00:02:57,784 --> 00:03:02,278
De nada.
#De nada. #

62
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:08,557
- What is that noise?
- I don't know.

63
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:10,357
- Hey.
- Is that you?

64
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:12,921
- What?
- What's that noise?

65
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:14,489
Oh, the orthotics.

66
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:16,124
- Ugh...
- What?

67
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:18,032
- It's loud!
- Well, you gotta break 'em in.

68
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,798
It takes a little time.

69
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:21,669
They're really loud.

70
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,004
Well, they're very good
for my feet, I could tell you that.

71
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:26,510
- My feet feel a lot better.
- That's good.

72
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:28,636
Let me ask you
something:

73
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:30,738
Why is it that
before you have a meal,

74
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:33,807
you do the whole cross thing,
but not for a snack.

75
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:36,342
I don't think
it applies to snacks.

76
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:39,219
I guess, otherwise you'd be
crossing all day long.

77
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,155
There's gotta be
a maximum number

78
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,283
of times somebody
can cross in a day.

79
00:03:43,326 --> 00:03:45,658
Uh, I wonder
what the record is.

80
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:47,822
Have you ever seen
any crossing on a snack, ever?

81
00:03:47,864 --> 00:03:49,661
- I don't think so.
- Excuse me.

82
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,496
I'm gonna be on the lookout
for people who cross before snacking.

83
00:03:52,534 --> 00:03:54,161
What's that?

84
00:03:54,202 --> 00:03:55,669
- This?
- Yeah.

85
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:57,399
This is a nail.

86
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,236
I bought this
on the internet.

87
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:01,105
It's from "The Passion
of the Christ."

88
00:04:01,143 --> 00:04:03,543
What, are you kidding?

89
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:05,238
No.

90
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,271
- Kind of interesting...
- You got one of those Christ nails

91
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:09,976
- from the movie?
- Mm-hmm, yep.

92
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,848
Have you seen it?

93
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:13,649
I didn't see it.

94
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,916
- All right, you must...
- Missed "Passion of the Christ."

95
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:17,718
- We have it on DVD.
- Wish I could have gone.

96
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,224
They have all kinds of
things in the internet

97
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,726
for "The Passion
of the Christ."

98
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,523
You're nuts about this
Jesus guy, aren't you?

99
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,462
Yeah, I have a personal
relationship with Christ.

100
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,964
- Really?
- Yeah.

101
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,364
I can see worshipping Jesus
if he were a girl.

102
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,665
Like if God had a daughter... Jane.
I'll worship a Jane.

103
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:34,103
- No.
- But, you know, to worship a guy...

104
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:35,868
it's like a little
kinda, you know,

105
00:04:35,908 --> 00:04:37,398
it's a little gay,
isn't it?

106
00:04:37,442 --> 00:04:38,932
- Okay.
- The Son of God!

107
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,841
- What's the matter with you?
- No, I'm just saying.

108
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:42,971
A girl...
I would worship Jane...

109
00:04:43,014 --> 00:04:44,504
if he had
a daughter Jane,

110
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:46,107
I could have a relationship
with a Jane.

111
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,175
- He didn't have a daughter!
- It's a shame it wasn't a girl.

112
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:49,914
That's all I have to say.

113
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:52,717
- Good-Iooking woman, zaftig, you know?
- Okay.

114
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:54,951
- Good sense of humor.
- No no no.

115
00:04:54,991 --> 00:04:57,459
- We got it.
- If he had a daughter, everybody...

116
00:04:57,494 --> 00:04:59,621
- everybody would worship Jane.
- Stop it.

117
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:01,324
That's all I'm saying.

118
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,545
- Larry?
- What?

119
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:30,316
What are you doing?

120
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:32,484
- What-what are you doing?
- What? Nothing.

121
00:05:32,526 --> 00:05:35,859
I was... your bra was kind of...
it was about to fall off

122
00:05:35,896 --> 00:05:37,625
and I was... I was
putting it back on.

123
00:05:37,664 --> 00:05:39,256
All right, and...

124
00:05:39,299 --> 00:05:42,131
I felt like
you were looking at...

125
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:44,500
my size.

126
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,605
Oh, um...

127
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,130
l...

128
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,938
well...

129
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,775
I didn't deliberately
set out to look at the size,

130
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,610
but I was...
I had the bra in my hand,

131
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:00,140
and it's kind of like, you know,
if you have a driver's license

132
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:02,779
you check out the date
of birth. That's all.

133
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:04,617
- Okay.
- I checked it out.

134
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,021
And what'd you think?

135
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:08,820
Yeah...

136
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:10,588
okay, it was good.

137
00:06:10,628 --> 00:06:13,062
Um...

138
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:15,122
well, while we're
on the subject,

139
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:19,328
uh, I think we're gonna
have to let Maria go.

140
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:21,360
- I cannot...
- Really?

141
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:25,670
Stand to watch her
clean room to room

142
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,504
without a bra.
It's very distracting.

143
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,442
I know, but that's
a big move.

144
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:31,537
You know, why don't you
just tell her to put a bra on?

145
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,707
I'm not gonna have
that conversation with someone.

146
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,512
I would rather
just get rid of her.

147
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,279
- We'll find somebody else.
- Really?

148
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,287
First of all, she makes the best
chicken salad.

149
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:42,084
I would really
miss that.

150
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:45,388
Well, Larry, then you're gonna have to
tell her to wear a bra

151
00:06:45,426 --> 00:06:47,417
or fire her.

152
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,320
- If I see...
- All right, I'll tell... I'll tell her.

153
00:06:52,365 --> 00:06:54,356
- I'll tell her to put the bra on.
- Okay.

154
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:56,369
I'll talk to her.
I'll talk to her, no problem.

155
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:57,870
- Okay.
- Okay?

156
00:06:57,904 --> 00:06:59,371
- All right.
- I got it.

157
00:06:59,406 --> 00:07:01,306
- You done with this?
- Yeah, I am.

158
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,899
You done?

159
00:07:13,252 --> 00:07:15,481
Oh hi, I thought
you were Jesús!

160
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,147
- Jesús!
- Yeah.

161
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:19,679
- No kidding.
- Yeah, his shoes are like your shoes.

162
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,351
- Yeah?
- Yeah, they're very loud.

163
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:22,984
They make a lot of noise.
You gotta break them in.

164
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,494
Yeah, but his feet
feel really good.

165
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:25,996
- They're better?
- Si, yeah.

166
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,496
- Fantastic!
- Yeah, thank you.

167
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,998
- That's unbelievable.
- It's good.

168
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,499
- They fit and everything?
- MM-hmm!

169
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,001
- Is he happy?
- Yes.

170
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,094
'Cause you know,
between you and me,

171
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:37,732
- he could be quite a downer, this guy.
- Yes, I know.

172
00:07:37,774 --> 00:07:39,240
He's good.

173
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:40,742
- Maria?
- Yeah?

174
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:44,542
Uh, I got a little thing
I need to talk about with you.

175
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,047
Okay.

176
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:48,915
Cheryl and I were having a conversation
the other night.

177
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:51,817
Well, last night,
actually.

178
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:53,821
You know, we couldn't
help but notice

179
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,222
that, uh, you don't
wear a, uh...

180
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,725
bra.

181
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,387
Oh, no.
Don't like 'em.

182
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,895
Not for me.

183
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,396
- Not for you?
- No.

184
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,398
Hmm.

185
00:08:05,432 --> 00:08:08,890
Because, you know I got
my father-in-law here.

186
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:10,904
- Mmm hmm?
- They're kind of distracting.

187
00:08:10,938 --> 00:08:12,906
Distracting?

188
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,908
Yeah, a lot of
flopping going on.

189
00:08:14,942 --> 00:08:16,966
- No, they don't flop...
- There's floppin'!

190
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:20,035
Don't like the support things,
they're uncomfortable.

191
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,876
I haven't worn one
in 15 years.

192
00:08:21,914 --> 00:08:26,681
They've made some great technological
advances in bras in 15 years.

193
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,016
They're inviting
and cozy and cottony.

194
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:30,521
What do you call
that cotton?

195
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:33,490
Puma?
That's a sneaker.

196
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,550
All right...
Pima! Pima!

197
00:08:35,594 --> 00:08:37,357
No, I don't like 'em.

198
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,226
- You don't like 'em.
- Mmm mmm.

199
00:08:39,263 --> 00:08:41,561
All right, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do for you.

200
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,396
I'm gonna buy you a bra,
how about that?

201
00:08:43,434 --> 00:08:44,901
I'll buy you one, you'll
try it,

202
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:47,403
you'll put it on,
you'll see what I'm talking about.

203
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:48,905
My treat.

204
00:08:48,939 --> 00:08:50,907
- Okay, I'll try it.
- You'll try it!

205
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:53,340
I'll just try it on
and let's see.

206
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:56,675
I'm gonna get you a bra.

207
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:02,484
Where are you?

208
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,008
I'm in the kitchen.

209
00:09:06,054 --> 00:09:08,249
What the hell is that?

210
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,485
Oh, my orthotics.

211
00:09:10,526 --> 00:09:12,084
What's the story
with that?

212
00:09:12,127 --> 00:09:13,958
Well, I got these new
orthotics, you know...

213
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,463
- Is it always gonna sound that way?
- You need to break 'em in.

214
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:18,158
- Okay...
- But my foot?

215
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:19,962
- Yeah?
- Good night, nurse.

216
00:09:20,001 --> 00:09:21,525
- Really?
- Yeah.

217
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,867
- How about that? Congratulations.
- Thank you.

218
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:26,896
- Thank you.
- Beer?

219
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,773
- Hmmm. Maybe later.
- All right, well, if you want one,

220
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,801
I haven't been able
to find my can opener.

221
00:09:31,845 --> 00:09:36,043
I'm telling you something.
I got a housekeeper who steals.

222
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,880
- Really?
- Oh yeah.

223
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:41,148
So it's just a can opener,
you might not think it's much.

224
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:42,779
But everything
I look for, gone!

225
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:45,655
- Why don't you fire her?
- 'Cause I don't know for sure.

226
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,158
But I'm pretty sure.

227
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:50,026
- Gee, I hate to hear that.
- I know, it's horrible.

228
00:09:50,062 --> 00:09:52,757
Of course, my housekeeper,
I had to tell her to wear a bra.

229
00:09:52,797 --> 00:09:54,856
You had to tell your housekeeper to wear
a bra?

230
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,835
I am buying her...
I have to buy her a bra.

231
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,930
I just don't know
what size she is.

232
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:03,701
Honey...

233
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,072
- Sammi's last tooth finally fell out.
- Oh, great, great!

234
00:10:06,109 --> 00:10:07,576
Look at that, huh?

235
00:10:07,611 --> 00:10:10,102
Yeah, Tooth Fairy'll
be coming tonight.

236
00:10:10,147 --> 00:10:12,115
Wait a second, what is this?

237
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,014
What, Tooth Fairy.

238
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:15,517
- Tooth Fairy?
- Yeah.

239
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,543
What, are you kidding?
She's like 11 years old.

240
00:10:18,588 --> 00:10:20,647
It's none of your
God damn business, Larry.

241
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,988
Her tooth falls out,
we stick it under her pillow.

242
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:25,960
She still believes
in the Tooth Fairy?

243
00:10:25,995 --> 00:10:28,622
Yes, she still believes.
What's the matter with that?

244
00:10:28,663 --> 00:10:30,631
- Really?
- Yeah.

245
00:10:30,665 --> 00:10:32,690
Jesus Christ,
I'm shocked.

246
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,965
What's so shocking?
You don't understand children.

247
00:10:36,004 --> 00:10:37,767
You don't know
child psychology,

248
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:39,773
and what they believe
and don't believe.

249
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,399
- I guess I don't.
- No!

250
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:43,967
I knew there was no Tooth Fairy
even before my teeth fell out.

251
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45,876
Really? Maybe that's what
your problem is.

252
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,108
Maybe if you had faith
or a belief in something

253
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:52,083
you wouldn't have
ended up the way you did, you know?

254
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:54,382
What are you looking at?

255
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,081
What?
No, nothing.

256
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,386
All right.
Thanks for your help.

257
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,449
Yeah, my pleasure.
It's always something.

258
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,290
Do me a favor? For the rest
of the night, just leave us alone.

259
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,228
- Fine, my pleasure.
- Thank you.

260
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,358
- You know what?
- What?

261
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,200
I think she's about the same
size as Maria my housekeeper.

262
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:14,205
- Really?
- Yeah.

263
00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:17,173
- You know what size she is?
- No. I can find out.

264
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,835
- Would you?
- Sure.

265
00:11:18,876 --> 00:11:21,470
- Thank you, thank you.
- Do you know what Cheryl's size is?

266
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:25,175
I just found out,
and I gotta tell you something.

267
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:26,876
- A little disappointed.
- Really?

268
00:11:26,917 --> 00:11:28,885
What, "B" cup?

269
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:30,887
- I'd rather not say.
- "C"?

270
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,786
- I can't, you know...
- 32? 34?

271
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:34,722
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Come on.

272
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:36,225
I don't want to
talk about it.

273
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:37,817
- Come on!
- No!

274
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:40,658
I'm giving you Susie's bra size,
give me Cheryl's bra size.

275
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:44,097
- It's a trade.
- I can't, I don't want to.

276
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:47,728
You don't tell me Cheryl's,
I ain't telling you Susie's.

277
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,499
- Okay. Fine.
- Okay. Fine.

278
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:52,267
I'm not the one who has
to go out and buy a bra.

279
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:54,366
- I don't give a shit.
- Oh, yeah, you do.

280
00:11:56,377 --> 00:11:58,345
It's unbelievable,
isn't it?

281
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:00,609
I could be general manager

282
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:02,172
- of a basketball team.
- No, you couldn't.

283
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:04,240
- I could put together a better team...
- You could not.

284
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:06,445
- Don't tell me I couldn't!
- You don't have a clue.

285
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:08,454
Half the things you say
here on the couch...

286
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:10,615
I know as much about
basketball as these idiots.

287
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:12,591
I just need
the opportunity.

288
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,287
That's all, just
the opportunity.

289
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:17,592
A young, fresh kid out of college
just needs the opportunity.

290
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,598
I do!
I know I could do it.

291
00:12:19,632 --> 00:12:22,567
- Where you going?
- Bathroom.

292
00:13:25,092 --> 00:13:28,390
What are you doing?
What are you doing with that money?

293
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:30,760
I was checking to make sure
the Tooth Fairy left it.

294
00:13:30,797 --> 00:13:34,028
You're lying! You're a liar!
You're the Tooth Fairy!

295
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,762
There is no Tooth Fairy!

296
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:38,702
- There is a Tooth Fairy.
- You're lying! It's you!

297
00:13:38,737 --> 00:13:40,705
I'm gonna kill him!

298
00:13:40,739 --> 00:13:42,570
It's you!
You're the Tooth Fairy!

299
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:44,701
- You know what you just did?
- What?

300
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:48,201
Sammi caught me putting
the money under her pillow.

301
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:51,113
Because you woke her up with
those things in your shoes, and now

302
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:53,515
- she knows that I'm the Tooth Fairy.
- Really?

303
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:55,678
- The shoes woke her up?
- Yes, the shoes woke her up!

304
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,655
She knows that there's no
Tooth Fairy now!

305
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,624
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry?

306
00:14:00,658 --> 00:14:02,352
I'm her mother!
Trust!

307
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:05,020
I know, but it had
to happen eventually.

308
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:09,226
You know, you're a stupid
fucking idiot! I cannot listen to this!

309
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,394
Jeff, do you hear this?
"It had to happen eventually."

310
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,097
His orthotics, whatever
the hell they are,

311
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:18,368
- the noise woke Sammi up.
- What's with your farchadat shoes?

312
00:14:18,407 --> 00:14:20,102
I told you it takes
a while to break 'em in.

313
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:22,542
What are you breaking
'em in in my house for? It's crazy!

314
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,375
Uh, you know...

315
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,210
Let me just posit this,
okay?

316
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:28,909
It might be a blessing
in disguise.

317
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:31,248
- How?
- The kid's 11 years old, already.

318
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,753
Enough with
the Tooth Fairy!

319
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:35,813
Not your business, Larry,
you misanthropic moron!

320
00:14:35,857 --> 00:14:37,825
Not for you to judge!
She's our kid,

321
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:40,383
we decide when she knows
about the Tooth Fairy!

322
00:14:40,427 --> 00:14:43,225
Maybe you shouldn't
have propagated this ridiculous myth!

323
00:14:43,263 --> 00:14:45,060
Get the fuck out
of my house!

324
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:47,693
- You sure?
- Yes!

325
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,615
Hey, what's going on?

326
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:12,122
What is it?

327
00:15:12,157 --> 00:15:15,421
Larry, get rid of
those orthotics!

328
00:15:18,262 --> 00:15:20,423
Now I'll never
get back to sleep!

329
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,005
May I help you?

330
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:43,017
Yes, hi, um...

331
00:15:43,051 --> 00:15:45,019
yeah, I'm interested
in, um...

332
00:15:45,053 --> 00:15:47,021
in buying a, uh...

333
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:49,023
...bra.

334
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:51,024
- For your...
- It's not for me, no.

335
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:53,390
For your sweetheart or your wife?
Girlfriend?

336
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,793
Actually,
my housekeeper.

337
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,889
Oh, housekeeper, okay.

338
00:15:57,932 --> 00:15:59,763
I'm not making it up.
It's really not for me.

339
00:15:59,801 --> 00:16:01,927
Fine, no it's not...
of course it's not for you.

340
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:04,960
- Tell me you believe me.
- I believe you, of course not!

341
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,734
Not that there's
anything wrong with it.

342
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:09,537
But there is something wrong with it.
There's a lot wrong with it.

343
00:16:09,576 --> 00:16:11,373
You can't say that in this
day and age.

344
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:13,538
I like to walk around
with underwear on my head.

345
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,911
Is there something wrong
with that?

346
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:18,917
- There's something wrong with that.
- That's very funny.

347
00:16:18,951 --> 00:16:20,942
- So you really do need a bra, then?
- Yes.

348
00:16:20,986 --> 00:16:23,682
Something comfortable.
She hasn't worn one in 15 years.

349
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:25,121
- Not a French maid outfit?
- No,

350
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:27,090
it's not a lacey French
maid outfit.

351
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:29,389
- 'Cause we have lots of those.
- This feels very nice.

352
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:32,555
Yes, this is our
revolutionary "Elasticene."

353
00:16:32,597 --> 00:16:34,565
- This is the one...
- Lovely.

354
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,658
This is the best bra
we make.

355
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:38,668
It's so soft, I like that.
I like that.

356
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:41,034
In fact, this one...

357
00:16:41,071 --> 00:16:42,732
I wonder if they make
underwear out of this stuff.

358
00:16:42,773 --> 00:16:44,741
They do.
We have matching panties.

359
00:16:44,775 --> 00:16:46,743
No, for me, for men.

360
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:48,870
See, that's what I'm saying.

361
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:52,244
Feel free to try on anything
here that you want.

362
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:54,340
Are you out of your mind?

363
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:56,374
I'm not saying it's for me.
It's not for me.

364
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:59,354
I'm just saying this kind of foamy,
soft material

365
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:03,016
- would be nice down there for me.
- It's so smooth, yes.

366
00:17:03,058 --> 00:17:05,049
That doesn't make me
a pervert...

367
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:07,254
There's nothing perverted
about it!

368
00:17:07,295 --> 00:17:10,025
...just 'cause I want to wear
underwear made out of a bra.

369
00:17:10,065 --> 00:17:12,727
Let's figure out
what this woman has...

370
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,595
Got a good selection
for you here.

371
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,765
And the only issue,
of course, is the size,

372
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:23,243
which I have to say I didn't
really know your size.

373
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:25,245
I got a feeling I think
I nailed it.

374
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,768
I really do!

375
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,804
Okay, try them all on.

376
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,816
- All right?
- Thank you, Mr. David.

377
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,545
All right,
you're welcome.

378
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,860
Hey.

379
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,795
You're a sick fuck,
you know that?

380
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,593
What are you
talking about?

381
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:50,067
What are we talking about?
Our housekeeper's been stealing, Larry,

382
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:52,228
so we installed cameras
throughout the house.

383
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,103
Laundry room.
I looked at the tape.

384
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:00,338
Quite a show, Larry.

385
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,004
Look familiar?

386
00:18:02,045 --> 00:18:03,945
So, I'm looking at
the size of it.

387
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,312
I needed to buy a bra
for the housekeeper,

388
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:08,579
and it seemed like
you two were the same size.

389
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:10,518
So I needed to find out
what your size was!

390
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:12,919
And what's all this mincing around?
What is this?

391
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:15,082
I was trying to imagine
what it would be like

392
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:17,092
to be the housekeeper
and have those breasts

393
00:18:17,126 --> 00:18:19,094
you know, working
and doing dishes.

394
00:18:19,128 --> 00:18:21,323
And how did that feel?
Did it feel good?

395
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:24,059
This is how your housekeeper
washes dishes, like this?

396
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:28,467
Huh? That's what she does? She dances,
mincing around, washing dishes?

397
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:30,471
Why are you looking
at her breasts?

398
00:18:30,505 --> 00:18:33,633
I don't understand why
you would walk into her laundry room

399
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:35,643
and start rifling
through her underwear.

400
00:18:35,677 --> 00:18:37,974
I just happened to see
the bra there, so I thought,

401
00:18:38,011 --> 00:18:41,674
hey look at that, she seems to be about
the same size as Maria!

402
00:18:41,715 --> 00:18:44,149
That's what you're doing?
Staring at everyone's breasts?

403
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:47,153
- Yeah, exactly!
- I had to buy her a bra and I thought...

404
00:18:47,187 --> 00:18:49,178
Why are you buying her a bra!
You don't have to.

405
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,781
You're the one who made me get a bra
for her in the first place!

406
00:18:51,824 --> 00:18:54,190
I never said go buy her a bra!
What is wrong with you?

407
00:18:54,226 --> 00:18:57,718
You wanted her to put a bra on,
and I was just fine...

408
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,095
You don't walk
around looking...

409
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,191
It's disgusting. Keep you goddamn hands
off my brassiere, okay?

410
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:05,202
This isn't the first time
it's happened.

411
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:08,171
The other day he's rifling
through my things looking at my labels.

412
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:09,901
We've been married 11 years.

413
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,307
So I took a little peek
at her bra size, big deal.

414
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:14,208
So sue me! Lock me up!

415
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:16,269
Pervert!
You sick fuck pervert!

416
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:18,281
You have some fetish
about bras...

417
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:20,283
Oh get out of here!
Fetish...

418
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:22,217
I don't know what
the hell it is,

419
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:24,948
but it's sick and you better
fix those goddamn shoes too!

420
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:27,786
'Cause you know what he did?
He woke Sammi up the other night,

421
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:30,793
I was putting money under her pillow
because her tooth fell out.

422
00:19:30,827 --> 00:19:33,352
She caught me, now she knows
there's no Tooth Fairy.

423
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,421
Yes, because there is
no fucking Tooth Fairy!

424
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,490
- It's time she learned that!
- None of your business!

425
00:19:39,768 --> 00:19:41,736
Where have you been?

426
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,965
Bra shopping.

427
00:19:56,117 --> 00:19:59,143
- Okay, Mr. Larry?
- Ahh!

428
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:01,676
- It's nice?
- Very nice!

429
00:20:01,721 --> 00:20:03,916
- It's good, huh?
- Very nice indeed!

430
00:20:03,957 --> 00:20:05,424
- I like it!
- You like it?

431
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,925
It's nice,
it feels good.

432
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,361
- Good.
- Yeah, it feels nice.

433
00:20:10,397 --> 00:20:12,058
What's with him?

434
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:14,065
Oh, he didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

435
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:16,158
He was woken up and now
he's very tired today.

436
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:18,465
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

437
00:20:19,638 --> 00:20:21,833
What's the Mezuzah
doing over there?

438
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:24,604
My father's gonna freak out.
He's gonna be here any minute.

439
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:26,610
Why didn't Jesus
put the Mezuzah up?

440
00:20:26,644 --> 00:20:30,603
Oh, Jesús was very upset
that you were talking about my breasts

441
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:32,309
and wanting to buy
a bra for me,

442
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,251
so he said, "Mr. David
can go fuck himself."

443
00:20:35,286 --> 00:20:38,982
That's what Jesús said?

444
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:41,354
Yeah, he was mad.

445
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:51,366
My father's pulling up!
Where's a hammer?

446
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,664
He keeps it
in the drawer somewhere.

447
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:59,070
What about a nail?
Where's a nail?

448
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:01,132
I don't know where
he keeps the nails!

449
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:53,686
What's going on there?

450
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:55,954
I'm putting up a Mezuzah.

451
00:21:55,993 --> 00:21:58,587
Wait a minute.
Is that my nail?

452
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:00,688
- I'll get you another one.
- You took my nail?

453
00:22:00,731 --> 00:22:02,698
- Larry!
- That's blasphemy!

454
00:22:02,732 --> 00:22:04,723
What?
What is going on?

455
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:06,496
He took my nail!
He took my nail!

456
00:22:06,536 --> 00:22:08,504
Took the nail
right off my neck!

457
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:10,733
Why'd you have a nail
around your neck?

458
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:12,741
That's Jesus' nail!

459
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,742
My father's coming right now!

460
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,078
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey hey!

461
00:22:27,121 --> 00:22:29,089
Hey, boychick.

462
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:31,819
All right.
All right, kiddo.

463
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:35,522
Hi, Nat.

464
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,660
This is the best
chicken salad I've ever had.

465
00:22:41,701 --> 00:22:43,168
- Ever, right?
- Unbelievable.

466
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:44,830
I don't know what
the hell she does.

467
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,839
My God, she makes
chicken salad,

468
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:48,965
she wears brassieres,
she does it all!

469
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:51,238
Yeah, she's very happy
with the bras, by the way.

470
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:52,744
Really?

471
00:22:52,778 --> 00:22:55,611
Yeah. Nailed,
nailed the bra size.

472
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:58,116
- Really?
- I don't know how I do it.

473
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,982
I've really got some kind of talent
for that, you know?

474
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,249
Maybe you can get a job
in a carnival somewhere.

475
00:23:03,288 --> 00:23:07,384
Yeah, it's true.
I'm good at it.

476
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:09,052
Yeah, have your own
little booth.

477
00:23:09,093 --> 00:23:13,688
"Step right up.
You are...

478
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,062
...36C!"

479
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:17,726
- Huh?
- Yeah!

480
00:23:17,768 --> 00:23:19,235
- I know.
- Great.

481
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:21,635
Of course, Jesús freaked out
about the whole thing.

482
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:23,139
- Really?
- He quit, yeah.

483
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:24,799
- He quit?
- Quit.

484
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,468
- Wow.
- The whole thing about the bra,

485
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,569
talking about the bra,

486
00:23:29,612 --> 00:23:32,445
asking her to buy a bra.

487
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:34,540
He told her to tell me
to go fuck myself.

488
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:36,176
- Really?
- Yeah.

489
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,584
He's a fucking
nut job, this guy.

490
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,918
So, did you replace
the nail?

491
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:43,015
Did I replace the nail?

492
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:45,026
I believe I have.

493
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,925
Oh, okay, good.

494
00:23:46,962 --> 00:23:49,020
Your father-in-law's
gonna be very happy.

495
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:51,998
Happy man. Your dad's happy,
you father-in-law's happy,

496
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:55,763
Unless, of course, any other emergencies
arise that require a nail to remedy it.

497
00:23:55,803 --> 00:23:57,862
You never know when
you're gonna need a nail.

498
00:23:57,905 --> 00:24:00,566
- You never know.
- You never know.

499
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,607
- What's the matter?
- My tooth!

500
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,112
What?

501
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:08,704
Fuck!

502
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,545
I think my tooth
fell out.

503
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,244
Oh...

504
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,383
Shit!
My tooth fell out!

505
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,390
- My tooth!
- From a chicken salad sandwich?

506
00:24:19,424 --> 00:24:22,621
What fuckin' idiot
put bones in a sandwich?

507
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,458
I bit into a bone!

508
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,464
There's bones
in the chicken salad!

509
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:29,830
Shit!

510
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:32,165
Fuck!

511
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:37,670
Quiet.
What's that noise?

512
00:24:37,707 --> 00:24:39,174
What?

513
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,870
Shh.

514
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,175
Sounds like your shoes.

515
00:24:45,315 --> 00:24:46,782
Jesús!

516
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,770
I didn't see anybody.

517
00:25:22,616 --> 00:25:24,311
Fuck!

518
00:25:47,238 --> 00:25:48,727
- What happened?
- He just fell.

519
00:25:48,772 --> 00:25:50,239
Fell?

520
00:25:57,247 --> 00:25:58,714
What is that language?

521
00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:00,306
I have no idea.

522
00:26:01,984 --> 00:26:04,509
What's this?
There's something in his foot!

523
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:08,082
Oh my God!

524
00:26:13,195 --> 00:26:15,857
The nail.

525
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:18,457
I must have dropped it!

526
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,129
It saved me!

527
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:28,369
Come on, let's
get him some help.

528
00:27:03,141 --> 00:27:06,042
Very funny.

529
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:08,409
I don't know what
you're talking about.
