1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,021


2
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:16,012
All right!

3
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,991
Happy birthday!

4
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:19,720
What did you wish for?

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,352
That's personal.

6
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,226
Yeah. Yeah, I know
what you wished for.

7
00:00:23,264 --> 00:00:25,824
You don't know what I wished for...
it's none of your business.

8
00:00:25,866 --> 00:00:27,993
- Oh, I know.
- Oh, really?

9
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:29,502
- Yeah, I do.
- What, what, what?

10
00:00:29,537 --> 00:00:31,061
What did you wish for?

11
00:00:31,105 --> 00:00:33,471
You know, it's a personal thing.
It's a wish.

12
00:00:33,507 --> 00:00:35,771
- You wished...
- I don't like to say what I wished for.

13
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,539
You wished that
Louis Lewis would die,

14
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:40,342
so you don't have to give up your own
kidney to Richard.

15
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:42,008
Yeah, right.

16
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:43,811
- That's what it was.
- Yeah.

17
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,477
- No, it wasn't.
- Yeah, trust me. Oh yes.

18
00:00:45,518 --> 00:00:47,179
Who would do
something like that?

19
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,586
You! You,
that's who... you!

20
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:52,091
You think I would wish
for somebody who's in a coma,

21
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,593
who's practically
a vegetable, to die,

22
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:57,222
just so I wouldn't have
to give up my own kidney?

23
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:02,133
Okay.

24
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:04,295
Let's go.
Open her up.

25
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:05,998
Look at this.

26
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:08,337
- The guy got me a present, huh?
- It's nice.

27
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,036
- What a guy!
- Yes, indeed.

28
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:14,243
It's good to have a big friend,
you can smack him around. Look at that!

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,043
- It doesn't hurt.
- Don't feel a thing.

30
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,277
- Doesn't hurt him, doesn't feel anything.
- Don't feel a thing.

31
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:20,081
Take a pop at him.
Go ahead, take a pop.

32
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,020
Take a pop.
Doesn't feel anything.

33
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:26,650
- Here, let me help you.
- What are you doing?

34
00:01:26,693 --> 00:01:28,422
- I got it.
- Come on. I wrapped it.

35
00:01:28,461 --> 00:01:30,429
- I know how to do it.
- Doesn't matter. It's my gift!

36
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:33,125
- It's not a big deal.
- It's my present. Let go.

37
00:01:33,166 --> 00:01:34,690
- Let of the package.
- All right!

38
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:36,895
Let go.

39
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,265
- I know what it is.
- Yes, indeed.

40
00:01:41,306 --> 00:01:43,001
- I know what it is.
- What is it?

41
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,010
It's a green...
it's a green sport jacket.

42
00:01:45,044 --> 00:01:47,103
He has one and I
complimented him on it.

43
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:50,206
And he remembered what I said
and he got me this.

44
00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:52,410
This is the best
birthday I ever had.

45
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:54,476
Best birthday a fellow
could ever have.

46
00:01:55,988 --> 00:01:58,980
I noticed that you haven't
contributed anything to...

47
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:01,993
I know, my gift is on hold.

48
00:02:02,027 --> 00:02:04,587
I have to confirm something
before I give it to you.

49
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,598
Really?

50
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:08,327
No, it's gonna be so good.
It's gonna be so good.

51
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,028
When am I going to get it?

52
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:12,367
- As soon as I have 100% confirmation.
- Really?

53
00:02:12,404 --> 00:02:14,395
And you're going to love it.
Just trust me.

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,101
- Aw.
- Yeah, but you'll love it.

55
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,768
- Come on.
- You're going to love it. Trust me.

56
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,368
Try the jacket on.
Let's see you try it on.

57
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:21,379
Oh, one second.

58
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:28,615
- Hey!
- Hey.

59
00:02:28,654 --> 00:02:30,622
- How are you?
- All right.

60
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:32,783
- How are you?
- Pretty good, pretty good.

61
00:02:32,825 --> 00:02:35,089
- Mr. Birthday Boy today.
- Oh, you remembered.

62
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:38,062
- Remember, please. Who can forget?
- I can't believe it.

63
00:02:38,097 --> 00:02:41,031
Oh, you kiddin'? Who'd forget
this day. How's your dad?

64
00:02:41,065 --> 00:02:43,056
He's... you know,
he's all right.

65
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:46,400
The hearing is going
and the mind is, you know, it's...

66
00:02:46,437 --> 00:02:49,565
This is tragic. Because this guy,
he was sharp.

67
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:51,939
Yeah, but he's not...
he forgets things,

68
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:54,536
he doesn't remember
stuff anymore.

69
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,547
Well, at least
it's not his hip.

70
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,209
Because once it's at the hip, then
you're gone. They all say you're gone.

71
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,718
- Look who's here.
- Hi, Andy. How are you, pal?

72
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:03,812
- Good to see you.
- How are you, Jeffrey?

73
00:03:03,855 --> 00:03:07,222
Good to see you. I forgot to tell you
something so important.

74
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:10,159
Hef invited me to a party
at the Mansion.

75
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:12,355
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:12,396 --> 00:03:14,023
Want to go
to the Playboy Mansion?

77
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:17,398
Yeah, do I want to?
Yeah, but can I? I don't know.

78
00:03:17,435 --> 00:03:19,494
Come on. We'll be
"going to a movie" or something.

79
00:03:19,537 --> 00:03:21,505
There's no way.
Come on.

80
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:23,097
Oh, come on.
You'll have fun.

81
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:24,904
I'd love to go.

82
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,946
I got to go to the bathroom.
Pardon me a sec.

83
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,778
Oh, hey, let me
ask you something.

84
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:34,444
Did...

85
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,453
did your parents ever
mention anything to you

86
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:39,046
about me being adopted?

87
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:40,954
What?

88
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:42,856
When my father was lying
on the hospital bed...

89
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,485
Yeah?

90
00:03:47,197 --> 00:03:48,721
I've never heard
anything like this.

91
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:51,063
Nat never said anything
to me, to my mom,

92
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,830
- Nothing.
- Parents never said anything?

93
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:54,496
Nothing.
This is wild.

94
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:57,063
- I hired a private investigator.
- No, you didn't.

95
00:03:57,107 --> 00:03:59,701
- I should hear something pretty soon.
- No. You know what, Larry?

96
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:01,711
You're nuts.
You're out of your mind.

97
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:04,942
Just leave it alone.
I'm going to go say hey to Cheryl.

98
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,400
Oh, good afternoon.

99
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:35,933
- Hello.
- Hello.

100
00:04:35,978 --> 00:04:37,445
Can I help you?

101
00:04:39,982 --> 00:04:42,246
I'm a friend of his cousin.

102
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:44,252
Richard Lewis?

103
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,345
Oh, yes, yes. Mr. Lewis.
Yes. Right, yeah.

104
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:49,854
Yes, that's too bad.
It's too bad.

105
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:51,257
How's he doing?

106
00:04:51,293 --> 00:04:53,818
Well, unfortunately
he's not doing too well.

107
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:56,923
He's in an irreversible coma.

108
00:04:56,966 --> 00:04:58,695
As you can see
we got him set up

109
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:01,703
- on life support.
- I see, yeah.

110
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:03,830
Prognosis isn't good.
So...

111
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:06,433
- Huh.
- Yeah.

112
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,875
So...

113
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,879
how long do you
think he has?

114
00:05:10,913 --> 00:05:12,938
- I beg your pardon?
- How long do you think he has?

115
00:05:12,982 --> 00:05:16,713
It's hard to say. It could be
days, weeks, months.

116
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:20,586
There's been cases where patients
have been in comas for years.

117
00:05:20,623 --> 00:05:23,956
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

118
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:27,861
What do you think
you're leaning more towards...

119
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:30,388
weeks or months?

120
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:32,456
It's hard to say.

121
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,627
If you had to pick one.

122
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,069
I don't know
if I could pick one.

123
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:39,403
Take a shot.

124
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,237
No.

125
00:05:41,276 --> 00:05:43,608
Well...

126
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,680
What happens
to the moustache in a coma?

127
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:53,448
- The moustache?
- Yeah, his moustache.

128
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:56,252
It continues to grow. There's a lady
who comes in a couple times.

129
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,816
Really?
The hospital has a barber?

130
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,055
Yeah.
She's a nice lady.

131
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,120
She clips his moustache,
she does his hair.

132
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,530
- She just works within the hospital or...
- Within the hospital, yes.

133
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,534
We just try and keep him
comfortable,

134
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,435
and...
you know...

135
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:13,406
Seems a pity though,

136
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,534
that these people
languish like this

137
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:18,044
when the soul
is crying to...

138
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,274
Yeah, I guess you could
look at it that way.

139
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:23,773
He's got all these organs he could
be donating. You know what I mean?

140
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,211
Yeah. I suppose.

141
00:06:28,256 --> 00:06:31,019
- People they sit here with their organs...
- Nice talking to you.

142
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,288
People who are alive
they need the...

143
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,963
What do you think
you're doing?

144
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,740
What?

145
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:50,242
You pull that plug
and I'll tell.

146
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:52,575
No, it fell. It fell on the floor.
I'm picking it up.

147
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:54,807
- Oh.
- Pulling plugs. Where'd you get that from?

148
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:57,942
Well, you just looked like
you were about to pull the plug.

149
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:00,317
You had your hands on it,
you were kind of...

150
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,447
About to pull the plug?
Are you crazy?

151
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,820
I heard
your conversation.

152
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,325
So, what? You want this guy
dead or something?

153
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,419
Listen, that's a very
serious thing you're saying.

154
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,430
You're practically
calling me a murderer.

155
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:13,262
I'm not pulling any plug.
So, come on. Enough of that.

156
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,736
Okay. I'm willing to overlook
this whole thing.

157
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,738
Are you? Boy, that's very nice
of you, thank you.

158
00:07:18,772 --> 00:07:20,239
- I appreciate that.
- If...

159
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,639
- Yeah?
- You grant my wish

160
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,405
That the Make-a-wish
Foundation turned down.

161
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,311
- You'll forget about this?
- You agree?

162
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:31,715
What was this wish
that they wouldn't grant?

163
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,484
I want to see
a naked woman.

164
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,889
- You want to see a naked woman?
- Um-hmm.

165
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:40,551
- That's your wish?
- Um-hmm.

166
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,118
- They wouldn't grant that wish?
- Of course not.

167
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:47,223
Imagine going through your whole life
without seeing a naked woman.

168
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,564
- Hey, I almost did.
- Hmm...

169
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,832
So you're going
to grant my wish?

170
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:56,365
Well, you know, I would love
to help you out. What's your name?

171
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:58,274
Wilson.

172
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,437
I'd like to help you out,
Wilson, I really would,

173
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,176
but I don't know any naked women.
My wife, that's the only one I know.

174
00:08:04,216 --> 00:08:06,514
- She's perfect.
- She's not going to do this.

175
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,486
- Why not?
- She's not going to come in here

176
00:08:08,521 --> 00:08:11,183
- and take her clothes off for you.
- Take me to your place.

177
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:13,987
Forget it. We'll have to come up
with somebody else.

178
00:08:14,026 --> 00:08:15,755
Fine.
That's your job.

179
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,820
- I'll think about it. Okay?
- You'll think about it?

180
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:19,626
- Yeah.
- You think about it.

181
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,496
Even if I had someone, how are you
gonna get out of here anyway?

182
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:24,435
Oh, please,
I sneak out all the time.

183
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,460
Have a nice day.

184
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:38,582
Oh. Andy,
this package is for you.

185
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:41,414
Open it up.
What is it?

186
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,785
I don't know.
It's from Nat.

187
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:46,791
- Oh, it's from your father.
- Yeah.

188
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:48,793
Look at that.

189
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:51,261
He sent me
his smoking jacket.

190
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:54,697
- Wow.
- Wow. How lovely.

191
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,893
- Look at that.
- Why would he send this to me?

192
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:59,631
But it's beautiful.

193
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,639
- Wow.
- Okay. All right.

194
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:05,336
You know what this is about?
I'm sorry to tell you this.

195
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:09,073
This is probably
a birthday gift for me.

196
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,844
I'll tell you why.
'Cause when we were younger,

197
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:13,851
whenever it was
my birthday

198
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:17,252
my father would always send a gift
to him so he wouldn't feel left out.

199
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:20,849
So, he kind of got confused,
you know, he's not...

200
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:22,860
he's not the same
as he was.

201
00:09:22,894 --> 00:09:25,327
He kind of got confused and he must
have written your name on it.

202
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:27,557
You think that he did not
send this to me?

203
00:09:27,598 --> 00:09:29,725
- Why would he send it to you?
- Look at this...

204
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,462
"Andy David." Look up at the top,
in the return is "Nat."

205
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:36,269
Andy, he didn't send me anything
for my birthday. He always sends...

206
00:09:36,306 --> 00:09:38,206
You can't accept the fact
that he sent me a gift.

207
00:09:38,242 --> 00:09:40,039
He promised me
this jacket.

208
00:09:40,077 --> 00:09:42,602
- Who did?
- My father.

209
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,511
Oh, Larry,
you're unbelievable.

210
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:47,073
You can't accept the fact
that your father sent me a lovely gift.

211
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:49,085
He has no reason to send it to you.
It's my birthday.

212
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,679
- Because he happens to love me.
- He's confused!

213
00:09:51,722 --> 00:09:55,419
I have a question for you.
Have you seen that "US" magazine?

214
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,087
I had an "US" magazine
that was...

215
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:00,528
It was in
the other room, it...

216
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:04,193
Oh. I think
I threw that out.

217
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:06,361
What?

218
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:08,803
- Oh my God.
- What?

219
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:11,239
I had a phone number.
A very important number

220
00:10:11,275 --> 00:10:13,539
- written on that magazine.
- What phone number?

221
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:15,602
Why did you throw away
my magazine?

222
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:17,671
Because he took it in the bathroom
and contaminated it.

223
00:10:17,714 --> 00:10:20,148
- Oh...
- What?

224
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:23,175
- I what?
- Larry...

225
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:25,710
- All right, let's get serious now, okay?
- What?

226
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,746
My father sent that jacket for me.
That's a mistake.

227
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,758
My father would not
just send you his jacket.

228
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,760
- He sent me a jacket.
- He promised me that jacket.

229
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:34,194
He gave it to me
because he likes me.

230
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,198
It's a mistake.
You're taking advantage of an old man.

231
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:39,724
- You're like a little brat...
- I'm a brat? You fucking moron!

232
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:43,034
- Give me that jacket.
- No, this is my jacket.

233
00:10:43,172 --> 00:10:45,834
This is my jacket!
It's mine!

234
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,279
You know he promised
that jacket to me.

235
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:53,578
It's unfair. He didn't give me
a birthday present.

236
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:55,914
He's just confused.
It's so obvious.

237
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:58,318
It's a big bowl of wrong.

238
00:10:58,354 --> 00:11:00,015
Andy.

239
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:03,025
So, are you going
to the Playboy Mansion?

240
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:06,927
I can't go. I'm so deep
in the doghouse now.

241
00:11:06,963 --> 00:11:09,830
She's really pissed off at me
because I threw away her magazine

242
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:11,162
that had
a phone number on it.

243
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,192
Aw, come on man.
You're already in the doghouse,

244
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:16,205
you can't get
in any more trouble,

245
00:11:16,239 --> 00:11:18,207
you might as well
get your money's worth.

246
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:21,368
Yeah, might as well
do something else wrong.

247
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:22,876
It's a "double transgression" theory.

248
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:25,402
- What an interesting theory.
- Well, thank you.

249
00:11:25,447 --> 00:11:27,972
"Double transgression theory."

250
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:30,211
And I could ask that kid
Wilson, to go with me.

251
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:31,947
Who's Wilson?

252
00:11:31,987 --> 00:11:35,047
Oh, yeah, Wilson.
I met this kid in the hospital...

253
00:11:50,705 --> 00:11:52,900
They'll take less.

254
00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:56,342
Trust me. Trust me,
they'll take less.

255
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:58,346
Call me back when you
hear from them.

256
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,747
That'll be fine.
I'm on L.A. Time, okay?

257
00:12:01,783 --> 00:12:03,978
All right.
I'll talk to you later.

258
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,987
What?

259
00:12:06,021 --> 00:12:07,989
What is this? Huh?

260
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:09,991
Take this off.
This doesn't belong to you.

261
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,255
You know it and I know it.

262
00:12:12,294 --> 00:12:16,321
My father promised me this smoking jacket
when I was 14 years old.

263
00:12:16,364 --> 00:12:19,821
- Larry, move on. Move on...
- All right, you know what?

264
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:22,335
- Oh my goodness.
- I'm going to the Playboy Mansion.

265
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:24,599
When I get back,
I want you out of that jacket.

266
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:26,003
You're going to
the Playboy Mansion?

267
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,632
I don't want you walking around
in this jacket anymore.

268
00:12:27,675 --> 00:12:30,109
Hold on. Wait...
Larry... Take me.

269
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:33,079
I want to go.
Can I go?

270
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:34,637
- Really?
- Please.

271
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:37,378
Oh, what would this
do to my trip?

272
00:12:37,418 --> 00:12:39,613
- To go to the Playboy Mansion!
- That would be great, wouldn't it?

273
00:12:39,653 --> 00:12:42,121
- Please.
- It's not really my decision.

274
00:12:42,156 --> 00:12:44,124
- It would make my trip so beautiful.
- I know, Andy.

275
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:47,650
I wish I could help you.
I really do. I wish I could.

276
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,822
- You can help me. Just ask Jeff.
- I don't know...

277
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:52,093
What's one guy,
what's two guys?

278
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,295
- Oh, I got an idea.
- What?

279
00:12:55,336 --> 00:12:57,531
- You want to go to the Playboy Mansion?
- Yeah.

280
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:01,007
You really want to go?
Give me the jacket.

281
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:04,502
You got it.
I'm going to go up and change.

282
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:06,706
Wait a second. I'm taking it
to the drycleaner.

283
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:09,113
- Take it off.
- Here, here, here.

284
00:13:18,658 --> 00:13:21,320
Speak into the rock.

285
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:24,996
What's your business,
please?

286
00:13:25,031 --> 00:13:29,525
Jeff Greene
and three guests.

287
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,833
Proceed up
the driveway please.

288
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:14,837
- Wow.
- Wow.

289
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:17,815
Look at this thing, huh?

290
00:14:17,849 --> 00:14:20,682
Mercedes Benz,
SL300 SI.

291
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,880
- You know it, huh?
- Um-hmm.

292
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,810
What did you do?

293
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:56,049
What is with you?

294
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:58,055
- What? L...
- What did you do?

295
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:00,489
I don't know.

296
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:05,024
Sorry.

297
00:15:06,498 --> 00:15:09,296
I got to use
the bathroom.

298
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,348
Well... hey...

299
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:27,907
- how do you do?
- Hello there.

300
00:15:27,952 --> 00:15:30,546
- Hi, Larry David.
- Hugh Hefner.

301
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:32,385
- Yes, nice to meet you.
- My pleasure, welcome.

302
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:34,084
- Hi, I'm Holly.
- Hello. Hi.

303
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:36,183
- Bridget.
- Hello. Hi.

304
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,218
- You're a guest of?
- Jeff Greene.

305
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:40,196
- Yes. Sure.
- Oh, you know him?

306
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,960
- Sure. Yeah.
- See, I thought he was pretending

307
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:43,796
- the whole time.
- No, it's true. Yeah.

308
00:15:43,834 --> 00:15:47,065
What's that animal walking around
outside with the long neck?

309
00:15:47,104 --> 00:15:49,265
What do you call that?

310
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:50,637
Well, it's probably a flamingo.

311
00:15:50,674 --> 00:15:53,336
Oh, flamingo.

312
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:55,743
I'm not good at identifying
birds and animals.

313
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:58,543
You know, like sneakers,
I can identify.

314
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,574
Converse, Adidas,
I know all that stuff.

315
00:16:01,619 --> 00:16:04,679
I know sneakers,
birds I don't know from.

316
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:07,953
This is...
you know what?

317
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:10,255
This smoking jacket...

318
00:16:10,293 --> 00:16:14,127
my father's got the exact
same smoking jacket.

319
00:16:14,163 --> 00:16:16,063
Hmmm, I doubt it.

320
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:19,000
- Doubt it?
- Well, it's an original.

321
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:20,502
I have them imported
from Italy.

322
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:22,971
- Really?
- It's a Roselli.

323
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:24,701
- Uh-huh.
- One of a kind.

324
00:16:24,741 --> 00:16:26,641
I don't know.

325
00:16:26,676 --> 00:16:28,268
- You know what?
- Hmm?

326
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:29,744
I got it
right out in the car.

327
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,804
- Well, I'd like to see it.
- Would you?

328
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:32,872
- Sure.
- Can I go get it?

329
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:35,111
- Sure.
- Then stay right here.

330
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:37,346
I'll go get the smoking jacket.
Stay right here.

331
00:16:37,387 --> 00:16:39,582
I think it's the exact same one.
I'm not kidding.

332
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:42,022
Unbelievable.

333
00:16:55,872 --> 00:16:57,965
Hey.

334
00:16:58,007 --> 00:16:59,099
What?

335
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,370
What's the matter
with you?

336
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,037
- What's the matter with me?
- Yeah.

337
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:03,136
You ruined my wish.

338
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:04,476
It could have been
a coincidence.

339
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:06,914
They ran away
from you, Larry.

340
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,780
It wasn't my fault.

341
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:12,685
Well, it was obviously something
about you that made them do that.

342
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:15,713
- Do me a favor, hand me that jacket.
- Why?

343
00:17:15,757 --> 00:17:17,748
Because I want
to show it to Hefner.

344
00:17:17,793 --> 00:17:19,590
What do you mean
you want to show it?

345
00:17:19,628 --> 00:17:22,859
Listen, get in the car. Really, I'm...
this whole day was just a mess.

346
00:17:22,898 --> 00:17:24,365
Come on,
hand me the jacket.

347
00:17:24,399 --> 00:17:25,889
- No.
- What?

348
00:17:25,934 --> 00:17:27,492
- No.
- What's the matter with you?

349
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:28,935
- Just get in the car, come on.
- Huh?

350
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,700
- I wanna go.
- Look, you little shit...

351
00:17:30,739 --> 00:17:32,400
- What the... give me that jacket!
- No!

352
00:17:36,044 --> 00:17:38,672
Hey.

353
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:41,740
I didn't knock. I figured
you knew I was going out...

354
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:43,341
- I could just come in...
- Sure.

355
00:17:43,385 --> 00:17:45,250
So I took that liberty.
I hope it's okay.

356
00:17:45,287 --> 00:17:48,279
What do you think?
Huh?

357
00:17:48,323 --> 00:17:50,621
- I'm amazed.
- It's the same thing.

358
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:53,753
Well, it's not a Roselli
but it's a great knock-off.

359
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:57,424
- Really?
- Yeah, let me try it on.

360
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,764
There you go.

361
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,962
It even fits.

362
00:18:05,006 --> 00:18:07,907
Wait till my father
hears that Hugh Hefner

363
00:18:07,942 --> 00:18:09,432
was trying on
his smoking jacket.

364
00:18:09,477 --> 00:18:11,035
He's going to freak out.

365
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:12,773
Wow. Pretty good.

366
00:18:12,813 --> 00:18:14,178
- It looks good.
- Yeah.

367
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:16,376
Pretty, pretty good.

368
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,817
Let me look at it
in the mirror.

369
00:18:20,154 --> 00:18:21,416
Not bad.

370
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,885
Excuse me.

371
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:38,100
Where do you live?

372
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:40,573
In Los Angeles.

373
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:43,473
Yeah.

374
00:18:48,949 --> 00:18:50,712
I noticed
they got some...

375
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,948
- They got some monkeys out there, huh?
- Yeah.

376
00:18:53,988 --> 00:18:56,422
You don't got much pockets
in there, huh?

377
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:58,891
- Not too many pockets there.
- We don't need pockets.

378
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:00,985
I couldn't live
without pockets.

379
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:03,518
Look, I'm not a dentist, but I enjoy
discussing dental hygiene...

380
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:06,930
They're monkeys, they'll attack you.
They'll claw you to death.

381
00:19:06,966 --> 00:19:10,902
I'd say gum stimulation,
very important, flossing...

382
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:14,998
There are people, though, let's face it,
who do have a foot odor problem.

383
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:17,509
Are you saying
I have dirty feet?

384
00:19:21,181 --> 00:19:23,342
- Your name is what again? I forgot.
- Bridget.

385
00:19:23,383 --> 00:19:25,613
- And you are?
- Holly.

386
00:19:25,652 --> 00:19:26,710
Holly.

387
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:28,550
Maybe we should go
bowling sometime?

388
00:19:28,588 --> 00:19:30,351
Maybe.

389
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,325
I don't think you want
to go bowling with me.

390
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,227
Let's pretend to be
ventriloquists, okay?

391
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:49,403
Remarkable.
They do impressive work in Korea.

392
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:52,172
You're wanted
at the Grotto now, baby.

393
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:54,180
- Ah. Excuse me.
- See you later.

394
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:55,806
- Bye.
- Bye bye.

395
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,470
The Playboy Mansion?
That's where you were?

396
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,535
You didn't think
that I would mind

397
00:20:26,578 --> 00:20:28,045
that you're running around
with nude women?

398
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,049
There's no nude women.
They covered all up when they saw me.

399
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:35,019
You have no idea how hard I've been
working on your birthday present.

400
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:37,613
I had this phone number written
on the back of a magazine,

401
00:20:37,656 --> 00:20:39,624
- Which you threw out.
- L-I'm sorry.

402
00:20:39,658 --> 00:20:41,626
And I finally got it back.

403
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,628
I have arranged
for you to have lunch

404
00:20:43,662 --> 00:20:45,926
and play a round of golf
with Gary Player.

405
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:49,695
- Gary Player?
- Yes, because he's a huge "Seinfeld" fan,

406
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:52,568
- and now I just feel like, why?
- Wait, wait, wait!

407
00:20:52,604 --> 00:20:55,903
- What are you doing? No, no, no!
- I'm going to rip it up...

408
00:20:55,941 --> 00:20:57,568
Wait, wait.

409
00:20:57,609 --> 00:21:00,236
- No, I don't think you deserve this.
- Oh my God.

410
00:21:00,278 --> 00:21:02,872
- Yes.
- No, no, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

411
00:21:02,914 --> 00:21:05,075
But what can I say?

412
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:08,176
I knew you were already mad at me
for the magazine, okay?

413
00:21:08,219 --> 00:21:10,346
So I figured, I might as well
go to the Mansion,

414
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:14,290
- so one apology would cover both.
- That was your logic?

415
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,452
You know, it's like the dog
who pees on the rug.

416
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:18,462
He knows he's getting
sent to the doghouse,

417
00:21:18,496 --> 00:21:21,260
so on the way, he grabs
some food off the kitchen table.

418
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,598
It's the "double transgression" theory.

419
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:27,126
How did you even know
that I like Gary Player, by the way?

420
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:30,231
I remember you said when you
were a kid you loved Gary Player

421
00:21:30,274 --> 00:21:33,107
And he was your favorite.
You liked him more than Palmer...

422
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:35,305
- You remembered that?
- I remembered that.

423
00:21:35,346 --> 00:21:37,314
Okay, watch the step.

424
00:21:37,348 --> 00:21:39,782
You got a step and you got
a little carpet here. Hey ya guys.

425
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:41,546
- Hi.
- Hey!

426
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:43,281
Pop-sicola.

427
00:21:43,321 --> 00:21:45,789
Hey, you know
what I did last night?

428
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:47,381
- I had a date.
- The playmate?

429
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:49,256
You betcha.
Bobbi Sue.

430
00:21:49,293 --> 00:21:51,784
- It's going great. She's terrific.
- Fantastic.

431
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:54,161
- I know, huh?
- How about your nephew over here, huh?

432
00:21:54,198 --> 00:21:57,098
Yeah, that's worth
the trip from New York, huh?

433
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:59,966
How's it going, Pops?
How's the nursing home?

434
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:02,198
Eh, I don't like it
there so much. You know.

435
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,264
- Why?
- We'll put you someplace else.

436
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:06,639
They steal from me.
I am telling you something, Larry.

437
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:08,871
- They're stealing from me.
- They're stealing?

438
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,142
You know my beautiful jacket,
my smoking jacket?

439
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:13,445
With the red and the...

440
00:22:13,483 --> 00:22:15,451
and satin?

441
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:17,146
Yeah, sure.
Your smoking jacket.

442
00:22:17,187 --> 00:22:19,678
- They took it.
- No, no, no.

443
00:22:19,723 --> 00:22:23,124
- They took my smoking jacket.
- Uncle Nat, no, no. You sent it to me.

444
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:26,686
You actually probably meant
to send it to me for my birthday.

445
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:29,631
No, you sent it to me because
my name was on the package.

446
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:31,896
You always said you wanted me
to have that jacket.

447
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,368
You gave it to me.

448
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,064
- Hey, gentlemen!
- He sent it to me!

449
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,074
- You said... Nat...
- Why the hell would I send

450
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:41,441
that beautiful jacket to either of you?
I love that jacket.

451
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:43,571
All right, hold on.

452
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,013
What?

453
00:22:47,317 --> 00:22:50,286
What's that?

454
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:57,382
What the heck is this?
This is not my...

455
00:22:57,426 --> 00:22:59,223
this is not
my smoking jacket.

456
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:01,525
- It's not.
- Well I'm sorry.

457
00:23:01,563 --> 00:23:04,293
My jacket is a Roselli jacket.
Take a look at this thing.

458
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,767
Take a look at the seams here.
It's a shmata, man.

459
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,862
It's not my... this is a knock-off
of my jacket.

460
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:12,965
- What?
- How did you get a hold of this dreck?

461
00:23:13,008 --> 00:23:14,976
- This is a knock-off?
- It's a knock-off.

462
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,443
It's a cheap, cheap imitation.

463
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,639
This is not a Roselli?

464
00:23:18,681 --> 00:23:20,740
This is not a Roselli.
How did you get it?

465
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,650
Holy shit.

466
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,446
All right.
I'll get your jacket back.

467
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,480
- All right...
- Today. I'm getting it back today.

468
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:32,790
- All right.
- Hugh Hefner. He's got my jacket.

469
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,853
Hugh Hefner
has your jacket?

470
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:37,525
Hugh Hefner
took my jacket?

471
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,275
- Hi.
- Larry.

472
00:23:54,315 --> 00:23:57,546
Sorry...

473
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,553
sorry for
bothering you but...

474
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:02,317
the other day when
I was here, I mistakenly

475
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,019
took the wrong
smoking jacket and...

476
00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:08,495
I'm sorry, this is your smoking jacket.
That one's actually my father's.

477
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:10,429
I apologize.

478
00:24:10,465 --> 00:24:11,659
I don't think so.

479
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:16,500
This is a Roselli.
That's a knock-off.

480
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:19,700
No, no no.
This is the Roselli.

481
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:22,301
That's the knock-off.
That's my father's.

482
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:25,835
I can tell the difference.
That's the knock-off.

483
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,905
Well, here. Maybe you should
take another look at it.

484
00:24:27,949 --> 00:24:31,043
I really haven't got time for this.
They're waiting for me upstairs.

485
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:32,985
- I'm sorry.
- You got the wrong jacket.

486
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:35,649
- I'm sorry.
- That's my father's jacket.

487
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,688
Who's waiting for you upstairs?

488
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:50,799
So, any... change?

489
00:24:52,272 --> 00:24:53,967
Has he gotten any worse?

490
00:24:54,007 --> 00:24:57,773
No, it's about the same.
No worse, no better.

491
00:24:57,811 --> 00:24:59,870
- Damn.
- Yeah. You know,

492
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:03,610
I have to tell you that I'm quite
impressed with your dedication...

493
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,618
- Really?
...to visiting this patient.

494
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:07,620
Oh, thank you, doctor.

495
00:25:07,654 --> 00:25:09,622
That's very nice
of you though.

496
00:25:09,656 --> 00:25:11,385
Well, it is
my friend's cousin.

497
00:25:11,425 --> 00:25:13,552
Yes.

498
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:17,522
How do you know
if he's dead?

499
00:25:18,932 --> 00:25:21,492
Well, it's pretty simple.
There's no heartbeat,

500
00:25:21,535 --> 00:25:23,594
no brain activity,
and if anything happens...

501
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:26,231
Because he's an organ donor,
and his organs need to be free.

502
00:25:26,273 --> 00:25:27,706
Yes, I understand that.
We've got that under...

503
00:25:27,741 --> 00:25:29,675
If he sits here like a lox
for a couple of weeks,

504
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:31,472
the organs aren't
going to be worth it.

505
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,342
Well, I don't think
that will be a problem.

506
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,848
- We got that covered.
- Okay. Well, thank you.

507
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:37,509
Okay, listen...
once again like I said,

508
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:39,416
it's very nice of you to do
what you're doing with him...

509
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:41,887
Oh yeah, it's
the least I could do.

510
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:43,890
- Well, good. Good talking to you, okay?
- Okay.

511
00:25:43,924 --> 00:25:46,154
I'll see you later.

512
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:48,854
- Ah!
- Wasn't that lovely?

513
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:50,691
Yes, look who's here.

514
00:25:50,729 --> 00:25:53,459
Hmm. How's it going
with the wish?

515
00:25:55,501 --> 00:25:58,231
- I don't know, I'm kind of out of ideas.
- Um-hmm. Really?

516
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,135
- Hey, you know, I took you...
- You owe me!

517
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:01,935
I took you
to the Playboy Mansion.

518
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:04,841
- What else do you want me to do?
- I want to see a naked woman.

519
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:08,813
Okay. All right, get dressed.
I'll think of something.

520
00:26:08,848 --> 00:26:10,611
- Where are we going?
- I don't know. I'll have to think.

521
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:13,516
- Hurry up. Get dressed. Come on.
- Okay.

522
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:16,282
You're getting to be a real
pain in the ass, you know that?

523
00:26:21,627 --> 00:26:24,721
- What are we doing here?
- I forgot my cell phone.

524
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:28,594
My wife's in New York.
She gets very aggravated

525
00:26:28,634 --> 00:26:31,467
if she can't get in touch with me
24 hours a day.

526
00:26:31,504 --> 00:26:34,371
I have to have constant
contact all the time.

527
00:26:34,406 --> 00:26:36,704
Whoa. Is this place
your house?

528
00:26:36,742 --> 00:26:39,267
Nah, we're just renting.
They're working on my house.

529
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:52,987
Oh my God.

530
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:56,488
Larry!

531
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:06,336
So Wilson, have you thought
about another wish?

532
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:08,339
Yes, I have.

533
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:11,308
My wish is for Hugh Hefner's
smoking jacket.

534
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:14,368
The red one
with the black trim.

535
00:27:14,412 --> 00:27:16,403
The Roselli.

536
00:27:19,817 --> 00:27:21,785
- Larry.
- Hey, Gary.

537
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:24,253
- What a pleasure.
- Great to meet you.

538
00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:26,189
Oh, nice to meet you.
I've been such a fan of "Seinfeld"

539
00:27:26,224 --> 00:27:28,021
and to have lunch with you,

540
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,027
and 18 holes of golf,
what a way to have a day.

541
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:31,995
- Oh my God.
- Come right in.

542
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,123
I can't believe my wife
got in touch with you to do this.

543
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:36,326
- It's unbelievable.
- Hang on to her, she's a good one.

544
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:39,393
This jacket? My friend gave it to me
for a birthday present.

545
00:27:39,437 --> 00:27:41,905
It's uncanny, Larry.
That's exactly like the jacket

546
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:44,601
they award you when
you win the Masters.

547
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:46,609
Now there's
a 1961 Masters jacket.

548
00:27:46,643 --> 00:27:48,372
- Wow.
- Isn't that a beauty?

549
00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:50,471
- Look at this? Exactly the same.
- Exactly.

550
00:27:50,514 --> 00:27:52,505
- Why don't you try it on?
- Really?

551
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,676
Absolutely.
Put it on.

552
00:27:57,187 --> 00:27:58,415
Wow.

553
00:27:58,455 --> 00:28:00,980
I cannot get over how similar
this jacket is to that.

554
00:28:01,024 --> 00:28:04,516
You mind if I just go and have
a look at this in the mirror?

555
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:07,860
What? This is the one you beat
Palmer in '61, right?

556
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:09,092
Absolutely.
Come on.

557
00:28:09,132 --> 00:28:10,793
Look at that.
Hey, it fits you.

558
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,802
Yeah.

559
00:28:12,836 --> 00:28:15,066
You'll have
to excuse me a minute.
