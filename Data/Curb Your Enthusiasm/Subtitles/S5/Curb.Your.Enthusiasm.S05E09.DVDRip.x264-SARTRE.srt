1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,256


2
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:17,089
Larry! God, Larry, come on, what are you
doing? We're late for the barbecue.

3
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:19,458
- Oh, okay.
- Mark and Marla are going to...

4
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:22,122
- I'm all ready.
- Okay, all right.

5
00:00:23,698 --> 00:00:25,927
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting a jacket.

6
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:28,196
- Oh, you're not going to need a jacket.
- No, I am...

7
00:00:28,235 --> 00:00:29,668
It's at the beach...

8
00:00:29,703 --> 00:00:32,102
No, it gets chilly at night at
the beach, are you kidding?

9
00:00:32,138 --> 00:00:34,265
There'll be a fire.
Why are you wearing corduroys?

10
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:36,035
I'll leave it in the car.
What's the big deal?

11
00:00:36,074 --> 00:00:38,065
I think you're just
a little overdressed.

12
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,701
All you need are
flip-flops and jeans.

13
00:00:39,744 --> 00:00:41,939
You know the story
of the three little pigs,

14
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,970
the one who built
his house with bricks?

15
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:45,276
- Yes.
- That's me.

16
00:00:45,315 --> 00:00:46,907
- Okay.
- I build my house with bricks.

17
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,247
I build my house
with bricks.

18
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:50,615
- And by the way...
- I'm the third pig.

19
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:53,143
- When we get there...
- Think of me that way, the third pig.

20
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:54,552
I will think of you
as the third pig.

21
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:56,716
When we get there,
will you please apologize to Mark

22
00:00:56,758 --> 00:00:59,282
for the way you treated him
at the seder?

23
00:00:59,326 --> 00:01:01,817
Accusing him of stealing
your newspapers?

24
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:03,692
I already apologized
to him, I told you that.

25
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:06,789
I'm still not convinced he didn't take
it. What do you think about that?

26
00:01:19,242 --> 00:01:20,573
...scared to go to bed

27
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,907
'cause the freaks at Dupont
might get out of the cave.

28
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,105
I don't know how you can eat
this thing, really.

29
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,613
- You want a bite?
- Huh?

30
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:29,309
Why don't you just
burn everything you eat to a cinder?

31
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,681
Why stop
at the marshmallow?

32
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:32,912
- Aw, come on...
- They're toasting.

33
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:34,647
- It's a light toasting.
- Doesn't matter.

34
00:01:34,687 --> 00:01:36,847
It's the situation.
We're sitting around a campfire.

35
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,880
- That's why we're doing this.
- It's a fun...

36
00:01:38,924 --> 00:01:41,323
I don't want to spoil your fun.
You're having a good time.

37
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm just saying
it's idiotic what you're doing.

38
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,085
Try this one.
Try one.

39
00:01:45,129 --> 00:01:46,493
No, it doesn't taste good.
I don't want it.

40
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,963
Thank you
for your opinion, Larry.

41
00:01:47,998 --> 00:01:49,727
That's a perfect
fire I built.

42
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:51,995
Whose idea was it
to have s'mores tonight?

43
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,797
He can't handle the truth.

44
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:55,530
- I'm cold. I'm gonna get my jacket.
- What?

45
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,403
- Love those s'mores.
- He should just try it.

46
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,168
Another perfect one.
Who's ready?

47
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:20,153
Who drank all the beer?

48
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,124
Somebody's been
drinking all the beer.

49
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:23,590
- Hey.
- Hey.

50
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:25,456
My jacket's
not in the car.

51
00:02:28,429 --> 00:02:30,954
- What do you mean?
- Ddidn't I put the jacket in the car?

52
00:02:30,998 --> 00:02:32,794
You said that
you brought it with you.

53
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,131
I brought it with me,
I put it in the back seat, right?

54
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,897
And I looked in the front seat
and the trunk.

55
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:39,837
- That's really strange.
- Huh?

56
00:02:39,872 --> 00:02:41,863
That's bizarre.

57
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:45,665
'Cause I know
you brought it.

58
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,574
'Cause I made fun
of you.

59
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:49,772
What, what are you
looking at?

60
00:02:52,115 --> 00:02:55,175
That's my jacket.

61
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:56,775
Marla's wearing my jacket.

62
00:02:56,818 --> 00:02:59,412
She took my jacket
from the car?

63
00:02:59,454 --> 00:03:01,284
What is that?

64
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:03,722
Maybe she was walking by and saw it
in the back seat.

65
00:03:03,757 --> 00:03:05,986
But you don't go into someone's car
and take their coat.

66
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:09,461
- She just grabbed it, she was cold.
- It's not her coat though.

67
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:12,555
Okay, well, it's not a big deal.
Let's not make it a big deal.

68
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:14,225
Everyone?

69
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,166
- Uh, we have an announcement.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,169
We want you guys

71
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:21,193
to clear your calendars

72
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:23,331
and hold the date
of the 14th

73
00:03:23,373 --> 00:03:26,671
and come back here where we're going
to be getting married.

74
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:28,540
Oh my God!

75
00:03:28,577 --> 00:03:30,601
Congratulations.

76
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:33,944
Oh my God,
that is so great.

77
00:03:33,982 --> 00:03:35,972
- Oh, thanks.
- Congratulations.

78
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:38,678
- It's going to be totally cool.
- Mazel tov.

79
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,050
- That's so exciting.
- Oh, thank you.

80
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:43,317
Congratulations!

81
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,152
That's great...
great news.

82
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,420
I mean it just couldn't have been
more perfect.

83
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,359
Yeah, good, good.

84
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:53,624
Brr.

85
00:03:53,663 --> 00:03:55,426
Whew!

86
00:03:55,465 --> 00:03:57,456
- We're just happy.
- It's cold.

87
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,166
Where did you get that jacket?

88
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:07,004
Oh, I got it
from one of the cars.

89
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,669
Oh, okay.
Okay, no wonder...

90
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,644
- I was just so cold.
- Yeah, 'cause...

91
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,544
yeah, 'cause that's...

92
00:04:15,581 --> 00:04:18,014
you got it from my car.
That's actually my jacket.

93
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,607
Oh.

94
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I was so cold.

95
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,649
Yeah, me too. That's why I went
to the car to get the jacket.

96
00:04:24,688 --> 00:04:26,712
'Cause I'm... I'm freezing
and everything.

97
00:04:26,756 --> 00:04:28,417
- Well, thank you.
- Eh.

98
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:31,254
'Cause earlier in fact,

99
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:33,955
before we came,
I was taking the coat

100
00:04:33,995 --> 00:04:36,588
and Cheryl was mocking me
for wearing a coat,

101
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,393
'cause it's freezing,
you know.

102
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:40,865
I'm not gonna take a coat...
what, am I nuts?

103
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,800
I had the foresight

104
00:04:42,835 --> 00:04:45,496
to bring the coat.

105
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:47,232
You know what I mean?
'Cause I knew

106
00:04:47,272 --> 00:04:49,865
it's the beach,
it gets chilly on the beach.

107
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:52,341
- You know...
- Bring a jacket.

108
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:54,139
- Bring a jacket.
- Right.

109
00:04:54,178 --> 00:04:57,510
You know, so I brought
the jacket and...

110
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,106
and I was smart, you know,
to bring the jacket.

111
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:06,245
Larry, do you want
the jacket back?

112
00:05:09,656 --> 00:05:11,715
Eh, oh... okay.

113
00:05:11,758 --> 00:05:12,782
Here you go.

114
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:15,988
- Are you sure?
- It-it did its job, truly.

115
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:19,155
- You sure?
- Yeah, you take it back.

116
00:05:19,197 --> 00:05:22,166
All right, okay, okay.

117
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:25,294
Wow!

118
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,530
Wowie.
Better?

119
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,561
What the hell is this?
What is that?

120
00:05:29,606 --> 00:05:31,836
Oh...

121
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,670
- it might have been...
- What is that?

122
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,574
- I was eating a s'more...
- Is that a s'more?

123
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:37,737
It might have been.
I was eating it, it's choc...

124
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:39,302
but it'll wash out,
it's fleece.

125
00:05:39,347 --> 00:05:41,110
Oh my God.
That's not gonna wash out.

126
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:43,081
- Look at that.
- Well, sure...

127
00:05:43,116 --> 00:05:45,914
I'll take the jacket with me.
I can wash it. It'll be fine.

128
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:50,052
- I'd be happy to buy you a new jacket.
- I see s'mores,

129
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,851
I can't stand them.
I don't know how...

130
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,880
l-I don't know what
people eat them for.

131
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,784
So somebody borrows
your jacket,

132
00:05:57,828 --> 00:06:01,558
it's not a big deal.
You know what I mean?

133
00:06:01,597 --> 00:06:05,089
You move on. You don't worry about.
You don't think about it.

134
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,894
How could I sit there
freezing to death

135
00:06:08,937 --> 00:06:11,097
while she's wearing
my jacket?

136
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:14,665
It's not like there's something wrong
with her and she's got an illness

137
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,504
where she really needs
the jacket.

138
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,373
You don't have
an illness either...

139
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,504
She's a perfectly healthy
woman wearing my jacket, I'm freezing.

140
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:24,946
Larry, they got engaged
tonight, okay?

141
00:06:24,982 --> 00:06:27,177
This was not about you.

142
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:30,448
It was not about your stupid jacket.
They got engaged.

143
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:32,148
Yeah, that's true.

144
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:33,553
Why would you even
say that?

145
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,318
- 'Cause I was cold.
- Well, so was she.

146
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:37,655
Well then, she should have brought her
own jacket.

147
00:06:37,693 --> 00:06:40,786
I was the only one who anticipated
that it was going to be cold.

148
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:44,285
And I should be rewarded
for that foresight, not punished.

149
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:49,165
You know what? This is really... it's a
serious thing for them to get engaged.

150
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,896
I did not ask her directly
for the jacket.

151
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:54,029
If I say
don't say anything,

152
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:55,539
do you know
what that means?

153
00:06:55,573 --> 00:06:57,369
Yes yes, Mom, yeah.

154
00:06:57,408 --> 00:06:59,842
- Mom says...
- I feel you don't know what it means.

155
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:02,071
If Mom says, "don't say..."
I didn't say anything.

156
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:04,773
You know how you said
that you were the smart pig?

157
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:07,577
- Yeah, the smart pig... exactly, yeah.
- That made his house of...

158
00:07:07,616 --> 00:07:10,244
But the thing about the smart pig
that made his house of bricks,

159
00:07:10,285 --> 00:07:12,980
he protected the other little pigs
that came over.

160
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,750
Okay? He watched over them
and helped them,

161
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:18,622
'cause he was
a generous pig.

162
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:22,024
Yeah... the pig also
didn't come home

163
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:24,188
to find some other
fucking pig

164
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,288
living in his house
while he was locked out.

165
00:07:31,802 --> 00:07:34,430
If the jacket were
big enough for two people...

166
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:37,337
- I know.
- I would've shared it like the pig did.

167
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,364
Pig?

168
00:07:39,408 --> 00:07:42,376
The pig..."The Three Little Pigs,"
you don't know that story?

169
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,173
What pig?
I don't know what pig is.

170
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:45,838
You know,
"The Three Little Pigs."

171
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,972
One built... the wolf
was after the pigs.

172
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:49,879
One built his house
with bricks.

173
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,713
I'm the pig
with the bricks.

174
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,241
When did it happen?
In the news?

175
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:54,582
No, this is a fairy tale.

176
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:57,110
- Not real?
- Yeah, it's not real.

177
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:58,417
- Oh.
- Yeah.

178
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:01,448
All right, so what... what do I owe you?
I owe you money.

179
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:03,153
- 300.
- 300.

180
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:06,356
Can you believe I bet the Clippers?
What kind of moron am I?

181
00:08:06,396 --> 00:08:09,853
That is your fault, not mine.
I said don't, you did it.

182
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:12,833
- Have I ever won on the Clippers, huh?
- Never, never, mmm-mm.

183
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,767
A jerk.

184
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:16,997
Okay, on Tuesday...

185
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,267
Mmm.

186
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:21,206
- I think, uh...
- Yes?

187
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,299
- I think I like the Knicks.
- You and I connect.

188
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:24,934
- Yeah?
- Huh?

189
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:27,342
They're getting
three and a half points.

190
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:28,971
- 150.
- Okay.

191
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:31,038
Okay... I don't even
have enough cash.

192
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:34,016
- Can I write you a check?
- Make it out to cash.

193
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:36,746
All right, come on in for a second.
You can come in.

194
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:39,516
- That's something important...
- That's what I told him.

195
00:08:39,555 --> 00:08:41,579
Hey-hey,
look who's here.

196
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:44,057
- Boy, what are you feeding this animal?
- What you mean?

197
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,423
He's as fat as a house.
My god, look at the size of him.

198
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,257
What kind of thing
is that to say?

199
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,694
You'll hurt
his feelings.

200
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,492
Like he knows what
I'm talking about.

201
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,465
He knows!
You don't call a dog fat.

202
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,127
You go around
calling Jeff a fat fuck.

203
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,601
Jeff is a fat fuck.
Oscar is just big boned.

204
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,433
He's not fat, he's lean.
He's just right.

205
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:03,269
- Thank you.
- He's gorgeous.

206
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:04,865
What do you feed the dog?

207
00:09:04,908 --> 00:09:07,103
Food, you know, dog food.

208
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:08,338
Where do you live?

209
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:11,312
Uh, around the neighborhood,
nearby.

210
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,474
Oh, they live
about two blocks up,

211
00:09:13,516 --> 00:09:15,779
big gray house
with white columns.

212
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:17,842
- Whi-white columns?
- Yeah, can't miss it.

213
00:09:17,886 --> 00:09:19,250
It's right
on the right side.

214
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:21,516
- Two blocks?
- Yeah.

215
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:24,648
Um, I'll be right down.

216
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,126
This is Sung;
Cheryl, Susie, Oscar.

217
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:29,286
- Hi.
- Hi.

218
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:31,056
Nice to meet you.

219
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:34,223
He's a beautiful dog.

220
00:09:38,802 --> 00:09:41,066
Why-why did you tell her
the dog's fat?

221
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:43,731
Why? Because he is fat.
He's gained about 25 Ibs.

222
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:46,297
You don't tell her that.
You can think that, tell me even.

223
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,900
- What the hell are you feeding it?
- She feeds it, I'm not.

224
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,706
I don't get the whole
dog thing anyway.

225
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:52,974
- We had a dog... Sheriff, remember?
- I know Sheriff.

226
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:54,844
It's like having a bum
living in your house.

227
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:56,815
When everybody hates me,
my dog loves me.

228
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,339
Hey, stop the car
for a second.

229
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:03,752
- That Heineman's car?
- Yeah, that's Heineman's car.

230
00:10:03,788 --> 00:10:05,016
But look...

231
00:10:05,056 --> 00:10:07,353
he never fixed the dent.

232
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,916
Remember when I smashed into it?
He didn't fix it.

233
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,723
- I gave him a check for $1500.
- Wow!

234
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:15,889
He won't talk to me since
his daughter jumped off the chair lift.

235
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,626
I'll be right back.

236
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:28,631
Oy, perfect.

237
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:32,208
- Hello.
- Larry.

238
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:34,405
I was driving
by the restaurant

239
00:10:34,446 --> 00:10:36,174
and I couldn't help
but notice

240
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:38,876
you haven't fixed
the dent on the car.

241
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:40,507
No, I didn't fix the dent.

242
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,041
Hmm.
May I ask why?

243
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:46,316
Considering it's none of your business,
I had better use for the money.

244
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,549
- Such as?
- If you must know,

245
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,353
I gave the money to my daughter
who needs it for something

246
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:51,790
far more important
than fixing a car.

247
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:54,623
- What does she need it for?
- It's none of your business.

248
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:57,596
- It's a little unethical...
- It has nothing to do...

249
00:10:57,631 --> 00:11:00,292
...not to fix the car.
- It has nothing to do with ethics.

250
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:03,301
You gave me my money.
I can do with that money what I please.

251
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:04,461
Are these pickles?

252
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:06,937
They're mine!

253
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:09,633
All right.
Man, take it easy.

254
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:13,164
- Good day, Mr. David.
- Good day, Mr. Heineman.

255
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:18,739
Pfft, boy,
that went well.

256
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,271
He said he has no intention
of getting the car fixed.

257
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:23,840
He gave the money to his daughter,
said she needed it.

258
00:11:23,885 --> 00:11:25,853
Well, that's
a big bowl of wrong.

259
00:11:25,887 --> 00:11:28,047
- You can't do that.
- You can't do that.

260
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,121
Hello?

261
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,817
Hey, honey.

262
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,486
Hey, ask her how the Knicks did.
I got $150 on them...

263
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,586
When?
You're kidding me?

264
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:41,159
Well, where are you?

265
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:43,792
All right, I'll be there
in like 10 minutes.

266
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:48,600
Oscar went into the pantry, had three
boxes of Oreos and now he's gonna die.

267
00:11:48,638 --> 00:11:51,071
- What?!
- He's at the vet. He's gonna die.

268
00:11:52,874 --> 00:11:55,001
I told you you're feeding
that dog too much.

269
00:11:55,042 --> 00:11:57,977
I don't feed him Oreos!

270
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:06,945
All right, uh...

271
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:10,385
I'll be in the examining room.
Just wait out here. I'll be back.

272
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,959
Excuse me?
You wouldn't happen to know

273
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:24,123
the score of the Knick game
last night?

274
00:12:24,165 --> 00:12:26,998
Oh, the Knicks?
Oh, that was a great game.

275
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:29,059
- Went into overtime.
- Really?

276
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:30,501
Yeah, they lost by four.

277
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,912
Larry?

278
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:45,916
- Oh, honey...
- No!

279
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:48,611
- Oscar's gonna be okay.
- He's sedated.

280
00:12:48,651 --> 00:12:50,983
He's gonna be fine.
We're going to take him home.

281
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:56,454
- I love that dog.
- Oh, Larry...

282
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,424
- So sweet.
- Uh-huh.

283
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:01,655
Oh, Larry.

284
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:11,963
Hey, you got something
from Marla,

285
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:14,563
- to "Larry David."
- Marla?

286
00:13:16,073 --> 00:13:18,098
The one who ruined my jacket?
That Marla?

287
00:13:18,141 --> 00:13:20,108
- Yeah.
- Really?

288
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:23,111
Well, give it to me.
What are you opening it for?

289
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:24,772
It's already open now.

290
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:26,371
She's my friend.

291
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:29,178
"Hi, Larry, sorry about the jacket,
Marla."

292
00:13:29,217 --> 00:13:31,707
There's a check.

293
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:33,310
What?!

294
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,344
A check!

295
00:13:35,388 --> 00:13:37,356
$150!

296
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,358
Wow!

297
00:13:40,392 --> 00:13:44,418
- Boy, you don't see that very often.
- What's that?

298
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,362
Well, somebody does
something wrong

299
00:13:46,397 --> 00:13:49,194
and then they make up for it
with something like this.

300
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:51,200
This is quite a gesture.

301
00:13:51,234 --> 00:13:53,326
I had her pegged
all wrong, I think.

302
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,837
I guess I should
keep it, right?

303
00:13:55,871 --> 00:13:59,271
Sometimes you rip up these checks,
it screws up the books.

304
00:13:59,307 --> 00:14:01,366
- Yeah.
- It does, honestly.

305
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,535
I'll keep the check.

306
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:07,035
It can really screw up
the books, these things.

307
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,377
- Well, l-l...
- Really nice.

308
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,975
I'm impressed that you even realize
what a nice gesture that is.

309
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,612
I'm apologizing all the time,
telling people I'm sorry.

310
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:18,349
I know when I've done something wrong.
I'm not afraid to apologize.

311
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,381
Most people, I have to say, and my
mother always used to tell me this,

312
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,085
"Most people aren't
like you, Larry.

313
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:25,185
Most people are not
like you.

314
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:27,127
You're special."

315
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:29,562
You know?
Everybody's not like me.

316
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:30,962
No, they're not, no.

317
00:14:30,998 --> 00:14:33,466
When I do something wrong,
I say, "I'm sorry."

318
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:36,435
It's the big... you know,
you give it up.

319
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:38,300
You do something wrong,
you say it.

320
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:40,805
That's what she did.
That's what that check is about.

321
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,536
I know, I know and l-l...
listen,

322
00:14:44,576 --> 00:14:48,204
this makes me feel so much better to
know how you feel about Marla now.

323
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:50,907
So when we go to their wedding,
it's not gonna be weird.

324
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:54,007
- It will be comfortable. Yeah.
- It'll be comfortable.

325
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:57,244
And I have to say,

326
00:14:57,286 --> 00:14:59,617
I thought it was very touching

327
00:14:59,654 --> 00:15:02,885
how sensitive you were
about Oscar today.

328
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:06,222
Oh, come on...
it's Oscar, man.

329
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,820
- Oh.
- I know, but I don't usually see you...

330
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:12,353
I don't know.

331
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:16,629
So... kind of in touch
with your emotions.

332
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:18,726
- Really?
- And willing to...

333
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,932
I mean, you'd have to be inhuman not
to feel something in a moment like that.

334
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:26,305
The poor dog is fighting
for his life, you know,

335
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,673
I love that dog.
I mean...

336
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:32,044
If anything ever happened
to him, l-I don't know...

337
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:34,310
- I don't know what I'd do, but...
- Oh.

338
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:37,510
- I'm sure I'd figure something out.
- Larry.

339
00:15:37,551 --> 00:15:40,782
L-I love
that freaking dog.

340
00:15:40,821 --> 00:15:43,050
- You know?
- I know.

341
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:48,217
Huh. Hey,
whoa, Nelson.

342
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:53,119
What you got... what you got up
your sleeve here?

343
00:15:53,163 --> 00:15:55,358
I don't know.
What you got up your sleeve?

344
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,095
Am I detecting a little...
daytime sex here?

345
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,830
Is that what
this is about?

346
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,101
Daytime sex?
I love daytime sex.

347
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,334
Then you can just go on
with the rest of the day

348
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:09,239
- as if nothing happen...
- Okay, okay.

349
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:19,410
Oscar!

350
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:21,441
Oscar, where the fuck
are you?

351
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:24,477
Jeff, look in the garden shed.
He's got to be somewhere.

352
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:26,318
- Oscar!
- I'm looking.

353
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:28,119
Have you see Oscar?
Was he outside?

354
00:16:28,158 --> 00:16:29,681
- No.
- He's missing.

355
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:32,216
- Oscar's missing?
- Yes, he's missing. He was sedated.

356
00:16:32,261 --> 00:16:34,319
We sedated him
yesterday at the vet.

357
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:37,263
He was lying in the backyard
and now he's gone.

358
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:39,356
He could barely walk
two steps... Jeff!

359
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,061
- I don't know. I've looked everywhere.
- Huh!

360
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,467
- I have no idea.
- Maybe somebody kidnapped him.

361
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,301
No one's going to kidnap
a sedated dog.

362
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,465
Well, where the fuck
is he, Jeff?

363
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,702
God.
Oscar!

364
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,308
This is crazy.

365
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:57,472
- You know what?
- What?

366
00:16:57,514 --> 00:17:00,449
- I have a Korean bookie.
- Yeah?

367
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:02,473
When he was over
at the house the other day...

368
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,110
Yeah?

369
00:17:04,153 --> 00:17:07,383
He saw oscar there. He was kind
of drooling over him a little bit.

370
00:17:07,421 --> 00:17:09,946
So... he likes my dog.

371
00:17:09,991 --> 00:17:12,925
Well, you know
it's not a myth,

372
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,086
they do eat dogs.

373
00:17:15,128 --> 00:17:16,924
- They eat dogs?!
- Yeah.

374
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:18,486
Some Koreans eat dogs.

375
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,328
- Ugh!
- Well, you know what?

376
00:17:20,366 --> 00:17:22,356
- What?
- I gotta go over there now.

377
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,062
He's got a flower shop.
I gotta pay off my Knick loss.

378
00:17:25,103 --> 00:17:27,161
I'll suss it out.
I'll feel it out.

379
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:29,968
I'm sure he didn't eat your dog...
I shouldn't have brought it up.

380
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,531
You shouldn't have brought it up.
That made me a little...

381
00:17:32,575 --> 00:17:35,203
- no, no, don't... forget it.
- All right, forgotten.

382
00:17:35,243 --> 00:17:37,768
He didn't kidnap
and eat your dog, okay?

383
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,781
Don't...
don't worry about it.

384
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,880
Oh, no, Marla.

385
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:53,858
I got it taken care of.
The beach is a good idea.

386
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:55,449
Yeah, tell Mark
I said hi.

387
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,950
Okay. Bye.

388
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,690
Who has a wedding
on the beach?

389
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,698
Mark and Marla?

390
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:05,199
- Yes, you know them?
- I'm going to the wedding.

391
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,599
- You're gonna be there?
- Yeah!

392
00:18:06,635 --> 00:18:08,262
- I see you there!
- What are you doing?

393
00:18:08,304 --> 00:18:10,498
- Flower, dumb-dumb.
- You're doing the flowers?

394
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:12,529
- The wedding need flowers.
- Huh, huh.

395
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,404
Will you say hi to me
or are you gonna dis me?

396
00:18:14,441 --> 00:18:15,874
No, I don't dis people.

397
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:17,876
- Okay, okay.
- I owe you money.

398
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:19,571
- Yes.
- Okay.

399
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:22,978
- Here we go...
- Uh, okay,

400
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:24,777
Unbelievable.

401
00:18:24,816 --> 00:18:26,977
I'm... I don't
have the cash.

402
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:29,212
How come you never
have cash, Larry?

403
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:30,777
I'm sorry, Sung.
I'm sorry.

404
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:33,220
- No, I see you on the...
- Never happen again, I promise.

405
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,087
- But listen, know what I got?
- What?

406
00:18:35,124 --> 00:18:37,455
I got a check from Marla

407
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:41,484
made out to me for $150.
I'll sign it right over to you.

408
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,987
- Okay, last time.
- Last time, Sung. I'm sorry, I promise.

409
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:47,499
- 'Cause I like you.
- Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

410
00:18:47,534 --> 00:18:50,094
- Okay.
- I know where you live.

411
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,665
Oh, you know what?

412
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:55,469
What?

413
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:58,066
- You know who I'm liking?
- I have a feeling.

414
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:01,271
No, not liking, not liking,
Sung, loving.

415
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:03,176
- Who? Huh?
- Loving.

416
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,109
Celtics!

417
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:09,447
I knew it, 'cause I think
the same thing as you!

418
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,543
- How did you know that?
- You're going to win!

419
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,178
I think it.
You're gonna win.

420
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,552
- $300 on the Celtics.
- Winner.

421
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,250
- Let's pick 'em. I love 'em.
- Yes.

422
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,815
- I love 'em.
- How does it feel?

423
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:21,122
- I love the Celtics.
- It feels good, huh?

424
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,218
- Yeah.
- Yes.

425
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,495
Ohh,
mmm-hmmm.

426
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:30,563
What are you
eating, Sung?

427
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:33,501
Larry, this is
fresh meat.

428
00:19:33,536 --> 00:19:35,504
It's quite delectable.

429
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:37,802
What kind of meat?

430
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:40,035
The best kind.

431
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:42,543
Only the best for Sung.

432
00:19:42,578 --> 00:19:46,013
So I don't know if you're aware
of this or not, but...

433
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,241
Oscar's missing.

434
00:19:48,282 --> 00:19:51,251
Oh, that's too bad.
He's a good dog.

435
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:53,548
- Yeah, he's a good dog.
- Yes.

436
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:55,952
You wouldn't happen
to know anything about it?

437
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:59,252
Uh, no, Larry.

438
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,191
Are you sure?

439
00:20:01,226 --> 00:20:03,056
Yes.

440
00:20:13,402 --> 00:20:15,370
Okay.

441
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:17,667
See you
at the wedding.

442
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:29,579
So, uh, I saw that car you hit
the other day in the parking lot.

443
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:32,208
- Heineman's car?
- Yeah.

444
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,115
What the...
Heineman's here?

445
00:20:34,152 --> 00:20:36,016
I didn't see him,
I just saw the car.

446
00:20:36,053 --> 00:20:38,886
- What the hell is he doing here?
- No idea.

447
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,987
What's with the hat?

448
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:43,889
What?
I'm married,

449
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:45,950
- I can wear whatever I want.
- It does look ridiculous.

450
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:48,155
You look like you should
be pulling a rickshaw.

451
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:50,095
- I could care less.
- But nonetheless...

452
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,531
Boy, I tell you something,
this is one hell of a titty festival.

453
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:55,363
They're all over the place.

454
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,562
Big bosoms
everywhere you look.

455
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:59,194
- You know what it is?
- What?

456
00:20:59,237 --> 00:21:01,933
Mark obviously invited
a lot of his clients.

457
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:04,066
Of course, of course!

458
00:21:04,108 --> 00:21:06,406
He gave them all boobs jobs,
invited his clients.

459
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,609
Oh, hey, there's Sung,
my bookie.

460
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:12,876
- Oh, what happened with Oscar?
- Nothing. Forget that.

461
00:21:12,915 --> 00:21:14,439
Is that Heineman's
daughter?

462
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,781
Yeah. No wonder why
the car's there.

463
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,309
- Look...
- Jesus, look at the size of her.

464
00:21:19,354 --> 00:21:21,185
- What has she done?
- Holy shit.

465
00:21:21,222 --> 00:21:24,054
Heineman told me that he took the money
I gave him, the $1500

466
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:26,286
and gave it to his daughter
and didn't tell me why.

467
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,225
He said she needed it
for something.

468
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,120
I paid for those things.

469
00:21:31,163 --> 00:21:33,630
You paid for those
giant fake titties.

470
00:21:33,665 --> 00:21:36,758
Come on, man.
What is that? What's up with that?

471
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:42,797
Okay, we'll talk to you soon.
All right, bye-bye.

472
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:47,332
- Wow!
- Hello.

473
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:49,674
Hello.

474
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:51,678
How are you?

475
00:21:51,712 --> 00:21:53,270
I'm fine, thank you.

476
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:56,282
You've undergone
quite a transformation

477
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:57,908
since the last time
I saw you.

478
00:21:57,951 --> 00:22:01,852
Yes, my father thought it would bring
more joy to my social interactions.

479
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,151
- Really? Is that what he thought?
- Yes.

480
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,418
Let me just say this, okay?

481
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:08,288
"Less is more."

482
00:22:08,326 --> 00:22:11,123
I think you went
a little... too big on it.

483
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:12,594
It's just my opinion.

484
00:22:12,629 --> 00:22:14,323
Well, thank you
for your opinion.

485
00:22:14,363 --> 00:22:17,355
But we thought they would be festive if
they were appropriately sized.

486
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,493
They-they're festive, man.
That's a festival if I ever saw one.

487
00:22:20,535 --> 00:22:23,662
I don't know what kind of guy you're
going after with those things,

488
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,899
but you're not gonna
get somebody like me.

489
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:27,372
Oh well, oh God.

490
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,568
All right, whatever.

491
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:31,702
- Good luck with them.
- Thank you.

492
00:22:31,744 --> 00:22:34,177
- I hope it works out.
- It's been working out.

493
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:37,181
- Really?
- Yes, it has, absolutely.

494
00:22:37,215 --> 00:22:39,182
- Hey.
- Hey, Larry.

495
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:41,343
- Is this your handiwork?
- It sure is, yeah.

496
00:22:41,385 --> 00:22:43,978
- One of my best patients.
- Really?

497
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,250
- How are you?
- Good, thank you. They feel great.

498
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,347
My lumbar section
of the back hurts a little.

499
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,655
You went a little big. Were you drunk
at the time you did this thing?

500
00:22:51,693 --> 00:22:53,319
He thinks
they're too big.

501
00:22:53,361 --> 00:22:55,352
This is completely
natural, Larry.

502
00:22:55,396 --> 00:22:58,091
- It's proportionate...
- It's natural at a freak show maybe.

503
00:22:58,131 --> 00:23:01,259
- I think they're perfect.
- Not very subtle.

504
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:04,736
It's not about subtlety, Larry,
it's about excellence and confidence.

505
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,431
- I paid for them, by the way.
- Excuse me?

506
00:23:07,472 --> 00:23:10,168
Yeah, I gave your father
a check for the car, $1500.

507
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:11,799
He gave it to you for this.

508
00:23:11,842 --> 00:23:14,970
- Not all of it.
- My check, my check paid for those.

509
00:23:15,012 --> 00:23:17,479
- That's where my money's going.
- Maybe covered the left,

510
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:19,674
- the bottom portion of the left half.
- Exactly.

511
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:21,875
Exactly.

512
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,045
Excuse me.

513
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:28,749
You wouldn't happen to know the score of
the Celtic game last night, would you?

514
00:23:28,789 --> 00:23:32,019
Uh... Celtics lost by three.

515
00:23:33,593 --> 00:23:35,560
Man...

516
00:23:35,594 --> 00:23:37,585
why can't I catch a break
on this shit, oh!

517
00:23:37,629 --> 00:23:39,755
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

518
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:44,596
Larry?
Larry, what's wrong?

519
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,693
I just told him
the Celtics lost.

520
00:23:57,745 --> 00:24:00,804
Oh, I think
I'II... get my coat.

521
00:24:00,848 --> 00:24:02,679
I'm getting
a little chilly.

522
00:24:10,655 --> 00:24:13,714
Mark, do you take
this woman, Marla,

523
00:24:13,757 --> 00:24:15,725
to be your
lawfully wedded wife,

524
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:18,921
to have and to hold
until death do you part?

525
00:24:18,962 --> 00:24:20,725
I do.

526
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:24,027
And do you, Marla,
take this man, Mark,

527
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:26,465
to be your
lawfully wedded husband,

528
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:29,436
to have and to hold
in sickness and in health

529
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,460
until death do you part?

530
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,867
You have got
to be kidding me.

531
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,343
- Honey, is there a problem?
- What?

532
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:42,312
Where's the new jacket,
Larry?

533
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:45,915
There... I didn't
buy a new jacket.

534
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:48,383
I sent you $150.
Did you receive it?

535
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:50,544
- Yeah.
- Well, where is the new jacket?

536
00:24:50,586 --> 00:24:52,554
Well, I didn't buy
a new jacket.

537
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,748
It's my money. I can do whatever
I want with it, no?

538
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:58,782
No, that was my money I gave to you
to replace the soiled jacket.

539
00:24:58,827 --> 00:25:00,623
I told him to buy
a jacket...

540
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:03,789
- First, you destroyed my jacket.
...before he sees you again.

541
00:25:03,831 --> 00:25:06,230
I don't need to buy
a new jacket just 'cause you say.

542
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:09,462
Did you read the memo
of the check I sent you, Larry?

543
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:13,301
It said, "replace fleece jacket."
Replace fleece jacket.

544
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,568
Unbelievable.

545
00:25:21,611 --> 00:25:23,578
Have you ever tasted anything
like this in your life?

546
00:25:23,612 --> 00:25:25,102
It's fantastic.

547
00:25:26,115 --> 00:25:27,877
Hmm.

548
00:25:27,916 --> 00:25:30,646
- This is unbelievable.
- I've never tasted anything like it.

549
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:33,175
- What is this dish?
- What, you're talking about this?

550
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,847
- Yeah.
- It's pulgoki.

551
00:25:34,888 --> 00:25:37,685
The Korean florist brought it.
It's delicious.

552
00:25:40,526 --> 00:25:43,892
Oh, boy!

553
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:46,159
Oscar!

554
00:25:46,198 --> 00:25:47,687
Ah-ah!

555
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:49,392
Hey, pulgoki's Oscar!

556
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:51,298
You're eating a do-oooog!

557
00:25:51,335 --> 00:25:52,926
You're eating a dog!

558
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,712
Drink of water here!

559
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:15,947
We're eating Oscar!

560
00:26:45,477 --> 00:26:47,502
Holy shit, it's Oscar!

561
00:26:47,546 --> 00:26:50,070
Larry! Larry!

562
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:53,906
- You all right?
- Yeah.
