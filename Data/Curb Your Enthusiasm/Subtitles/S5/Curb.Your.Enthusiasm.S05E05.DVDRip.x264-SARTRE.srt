00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,153


2
00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:20,781
- Jones Security.
- Larry David for Omar Jones.

3
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:22,949
All right, Mr. David.
What's this call regarding?

4
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:26,051
Uh, he... he'll know
what it's about. I'm a client.

5
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:29,258
Got that, but what
is the call regarding?

6
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:32,268
- To be honest, it's kind of personal.
- I'm sure it is.

7
00:00:32,302 --> 00:00:34,668
You can't speak to him until you
tell me what this is regarding.

8
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:36,831
But it has nothing to do with you.
It has to do with him.

9
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:38,534
I don't really wanna
tell you what it's about.

10
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:41,065
Sir, you're gonna need
to control your levels and tell me

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,203
- what this call is regarding.
- Do me a favor,

12
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:45,407
tell me the details
of your last conversation.

13
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:47,644
That's none
of your business!

14
00:00:47,685 --> 00:00:49,710
Exactly.

15
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:06,735
Oh, fuck.

16
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:09,103
Ahh.

17
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:12,737
Schmuck!

18
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:14,768
Fucking idiot!

19
00:01:19,584 --> 00:01:21,552
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

20
00:01:21,586 --> 00:01:24,317
- Hey, what's up?
- I locked myself out of my car.

21
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:26,723
Oh, Jeez.
All right,

22
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,750
I'll come get ya.

23
00:02:26,955 --> 00:02:29,685
Welcome to Jack in the Box.
May I have your order?

24
00:02:29,725 --> 00:02:31,693
I'd like, um...

25
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:33,422
two Jumbo Jacks,

26
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:36,523
French fries,
and a Diet Coke.

27
00:02:36,566 --> 00:02:39,558
Sir, are you
in a car?

28
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:41,695
No.

29
00:02:41,738 --> 00:02:43,706
Sir, this is
a drive-thru line.

30
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,537
You have to be
in a car to order.

31
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:48,305
- What's the difference?
- It's our policy.

32
00:02:48,344 --> 00:02:50,608
This is a drive-thru line.

33
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:52,410
One second!
Come on, I'm starving.

34
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:54,816
There's no... everything...
everything's closed.

35
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:57,548
- I wish I could help you, sir.
- Oh, yeah, right.

36
00:02:57,588 --> 00:03:00,148
Could you do me a favor?
They won't let me order any food

37
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,091
unless I'm in a car.
Will you...

38
00:03:04,595 --> 00:03:06,961
They won't let me order
any food unless I'm in a car.

39
00:03:06,997 --> 00:03:09,158
- Would you mind if l...
- No, I'm sorry.

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,395
Thanks.

41
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,904
I'm so sorry to bother you.
I'm trying to get some food.

42
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:19,775
They won't let me order
unless I'm in a car.

43
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:22,507
- No kidding.
- It's crazy.

44
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:24,742
Huh? It's just insane.

45
00:03:24,783 --> 00:03:26,546
- I'll tell you what.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:28,519
- Get in.
- Really?

47
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:30,544
- Get in the car.
- Oh.

48
00:03:36,095 --> 00:03:37,892
I tell you, Pete,

49
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,694
- should have got the Jumbo Jack.
- Do yourself a favor...

50
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,724
- Yeah.
- The next time you come through,

51
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:44,861
- go for the Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger
- Huh.

52
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:47,805
And the Asian salad.
A strange combination,

53
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,708
but it goes down easy,
and it comes out fast.

54
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:53,042
I don't need
to tell you more.

55
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:59,849
- Mmm.
- What kind of work you do, Pete?

56
00:03:59,887 --> 00:04:02,788
Good question.
I'm in...

57
00:04:02,823 --> 00:04:04,791
I'm in a transition
at the moment.

58
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:06,918
I'm...

59
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,658
- I was involved in the dental field...
- Dental field?

60
00:04:10,698 --> 00:04:13,462
- For about eight months.
- What'd you do in the dental field?

61
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:16,231
Uh, I worked alongside
a dental hygienist.

62
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,569
Really?
What does somebody do

63
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:21,006
working alongside
a dental hygienist?

64
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,746
I watched and worked closely
with a dental hygienist.

65
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,249
Hmm.

66
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:31,014
- And...
- And what happened?

67
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:33,146
Um, we ran
into some problems.

68
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,454
And I prefer
to leave it at that.

69
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:39,256
- Okay.
- I found myself...

70
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:41,422
drawn to landscaping work.

71
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:43,954
It's...
it's... it's...

72
00:04:43,999 --> 00:04:46,161
it's a slow transition.
I'm... I'm...

73
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,636
- You got some...
- Huh?

74
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,161
- Some porno back there?
- Yeah...

75
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,470
No, that's not mine.
That was...

76
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:53,703
that was left by a couple
of my co-workers.

77
00:04:53,743 --> 00:04:55,734
- Boy, that's quite a collection.
- Yeah.

78
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,475
Well, I had no idea

79
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:00,540
that that was there.

80
00:05:00,584 --> 00:05:02,882
L... that's not mine
to begin with, so...

81
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:07,188
I find it all...

82
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:09,352
- Oh, hey!
- Jesus!

83
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,156
- Hey.
- You ready to go?

84
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:13,129
Scared the hell
out of me.

85
00:05:13,164 --> 00:05:14,756
- This is Pete.
- Hey, Pete, how you doing?

86
00:05:14,799 --> 00:05:16,130
- Hey.
- This is Jeff.

87
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,930
- Jeff.
- Thank you for helping out my friend.

88
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:19,596
Okay.

89
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:21,606
So are you involved
in "Seinfeld" as well?

90
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,234
No. No no no.

91
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:26,005
How do you fellas
know each other?

92
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:28,569
- Mmph...
- He's my manager.

93
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:30,741
- I'm his manager.
- Okay.

94
00:05:30,782 --> 00:05:34,343
- Oh, man. Jumbo Jack.
- Did I tell you? Huh?

95
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:36,183
- Best thing ever!
- How unbelievable is that?

96
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:37,848
Unbelievable.

97
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,654
I'm sorry,

98
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:43,093
but I got some bad news.

99
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:45,495
- Oh. Lewis?
- Yeah.

100
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:48,329
- Ah.
- Yeah.

101
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:51,929
- Kidney?
- Yeah, both of them.

102
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:55,134
- He's gonna need a new one.
- Oh, well,

103
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:58,975
- is there a donor?
- I don't know.

104
00:05:59,013 --> 00:06:01,743
What's he gonna do?

105
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:03,079
I don't know.

106
00:06:03,117 --> 00:06:06,086
He's gotta find
somebody who can...

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,487
who can match. Hopefully, he knows
somebody who's...

108
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:11,081
got the right
kidney for him

109
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,184
and then it's a whole process
of... you know,

110
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:15,127
first, the person who...
has to be tested,

111
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:18,428
and then if they have the right kidney,
then they have the surgery...

112
00:06:22,237 --> 00:06:24,831
- Can you believe it?
- Yeah.

113
00:06:24,873 --> 00:06:27,103
No donor. No donor.

114
00:06:28,643 --> 00:06:30,372
Oh, God.

115
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,312
My luck.

116
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:34,281
With all
the people I know.

117
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,512
Oh, God.

118
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:39,385
What about your relatives? They're the
ones who're supposed to be doing it

119
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,356
'cause they have
the same blood and all that.

120
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,553
Didn't you have some idiot cousin living
out here or something?

121
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:47,426
- Louis Lewis?
- Louis Lewis.

122
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:49,624
- Please.
- What about him?

123
00:06:49,665 --> 00:06:51,496
Might as well be called
Manson Manson.

124
00:06:51,534 --> 00:06:54,800
He's a nutcase. He's... he works
at Jack in the Box and...

125
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:57,272
Jack in the Box.
I was just there the other night.

126
00:06:57,307 --> 00:06:59,537
Had a Jumbo Jack...
pretty good.

127
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:03,335
I'm glad
you liked it.

128
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,780
So did you ask this Louis Lewis?
What did he say?

129
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:09,308
He wants to donate
all his organs after he dies,

130
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:11,184
but not a minute before.

131
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:13,213
Thank you, Louis Lewis.

132
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,885
Doesn't help me any.
Schmuck.

133
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:18,293
I'm gonna have to get
on that kidney list

134
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:20,297
like everybody else.

135
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,060
Shit.

136
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,069
I mean, the only
other option is if...

137
00:07:25,103 --> 00:07:27,435
you know, if a... you know, if a...
if a good friend

138
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:29,599
or a buddy comes through.
Then I'm... you know,

139
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,700
then I'm golden.

140
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,735
Hmm.

141
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,288
I don't know what to do.

142
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:46,621
Just the test
isn't gonna hurt you.

143
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:50,186
I gotta choose
healthier friends.

144
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,221
This is no good.

145
00:07:52,265 --> 00:07:54,392
The next time there's any sign
of anything wrong

146
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:57,733
with any of my friends... if I think
they're gonna be going to the hospital,

147
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,739
any sign of anything,
I'm just...

148
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:01,707
I'm just gonna drop them
like a hot potato.

149
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,208
- Smart.
- And you too.

150
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:05,370
I mean, as soon as you get sick,
I'm out.

151
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:07,210
- You know that, right?
- Oh, well,

152
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:08,647
I'm glad you're bringing it up
'cause it's...

153
00:08:08,682 --> 00:08:10,877
- Well, I mean, come on.
- No, it's nice to know.

154
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,216
- Yeah, and I'm giving you...
- Although, I thought

155
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:15,381
that that's what
the whole deal was.

156
00:08:15,423 --> 00:08:17,084
It's one of the reasons
you get married.

157
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:19,649
Normally, that is the deal,
but we...

158
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:22,059
we're losing the sickness
and health clause.

159
00:08:22,096 --> 00:08:24,360
- I'm out if anything's wrong with you.
- Okay.

160
00:08:24,398 --> 00:08:26,264
- And look, same for you.
- Thank you.

161
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,734
- You go too, as soon as...
- I will.

162
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:28,963
- Okay?
- Okay.

163
00:08:29,004 --> 00:08:31,370
- I can't be around illness.
- But for now?

164
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:33,840
- Freaks me out, okay?
- But for now?

165
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:37,979
It'll be such
a nice gesture

166
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:40,004
and he'd really
appreciate it.

167
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:44,242
All right,
I'll take the test.

168
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,653
- I think you're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, great.

169
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:48,657
He's going to feel
very good about that.

170
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:51,660
- Yeah, I know.
- You're a very sweet friend.

171
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:53,662
It's very sweet.

172
00:08:53,696 --> 00:08:57,325
- Good night.
- What are you doing?

173
00:08:57,366 --> 00:08:59,061
How 'bout
a nice snuggle here?

174
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,934
I know, but your snuggle
always leads to sex.

175
00:09:01,971 --> 00:09:04,406
So what's wrong with that?
Why shouldn't it lead to sex?

176
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:07,877
Sometimes you just want to snuggle
and you don't want to have sex.

177
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:11,108
What's the advantage
of that?

178
00:09:11,148 --> 00:09:13,116
Because it's nice.
You connect

179
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,142
and it's warm
and sweet.

180
00:09:16,186 --> 00:09:19,155
- Okay, let's just snuggle.
- You can do that?

181
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:21,886
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Without it turning into anything?

182
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:25,384
- Yeah, we'll just snuggle.
- See? It's sweet. That's nice.

183
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,398
See...

184
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:28,956
how nice it is?

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,366
- Okay, what are you doing?
- What? What?!

186
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:34,030
- That's exactly what I'm talking about.
- What's the problem?!

187
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:37,371
- The ass is part of my snuggle.
- No, it's not.

188
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:41,345
- It is!
- Okay, then good night.

189
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,371
We'll snuggle
another time.

190
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,578
- It's just... it's just a lever.
- Good night.

191
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,588
I'm using the ass
as a lever to draw you in.

192
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,590
That's all.

193
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,854
And it gets...
the snuggle tighter.

194
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,884
Good night.

195
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,511
- Richard Lewis's office.
- Larry David calling.

196
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,173
Sure.
What's this regarding?

197
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:18,049
It's regarding
his kidney transplant.

198
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,609
What?

199
00:10:19,654 --> 00:10:22,487
It's regarding
his kidney transplant.

200
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:25,890
Mr. Lewis is getting
a kidney transplant?

201
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:29,062
What?
What are you saying?

202
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,825
He didn't say anything
to me about it.

203
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,093
You didn't know about this?

204
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:33,566
- Are you kidding?
- Oh my God!

205
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,230
He didn't tell you this?

206
00:10:36,271 --> 00:10:39,638
He didn't tell you that there was
a problem with his kidneys?

207
00:10:39,675 --> 00:10:41,939
- No, he didn't tell me anything!
- How could he have not

208
00:10:41,977 --> 00:10:43,444
- told you about this?!
- I don't know, but he didn't

209
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,241
tell me anything about this!

210
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,408
Oh Jeez. You asked me
what it was regarding!

211
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,918
I didn't know it was going to be about
something like this!

212
00:10:50,953 --> 00:10:54,720
But l... I wouldn't have said anything!
You asked me!

213
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:57,055
I could have sworn he...
I figured he told you!

214
00:10:57,093 --> 00:10:58,617
He didn't say
anything to me.

215
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,629
Oh my God.

216
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:03,496
- Take it easy.
- No.

217
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,137
Could you tell him
I called?

218
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:10,162
- Okay.
- Thanks.

219
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:14,567
What did you
do to my assistant?

220
00:11:14,612 --> 00:11:16,637
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

221
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,377
She's freaked out, having a nervous
breakdown, and might even quit.

222
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,282
It's un-fucking-believable.
Why would you do that?

223
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,116
She asked me what the call
was regarding!

224
00:11:24,154 --> 00:11:25,519
It's personal!

225
00:11:25,556 --> 00:11:27,319
She asked what it's
regarding, I told her!

226
00:11:27,358 --> 00:11:30,260
Jeez, what am I going to do?
She was a basket case.

227
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:32,263
Christ's sake.

228
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:34,094
What am I
going to do?

229
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:36,100
Hey, um, first of all,

230
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:38,125
I want to tell you that,
uh...

231
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,766
I thought about our conversation
and, uh...

232
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,505
I'II, uh,
I'll take the test.

233
00:11:49,515 --> 00:11:52,313
- Big fucking deal.
- That's it?!

234
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:55,479
I mean, you're my friend.
You should have jumped right on it.

235
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,546
You're right, you're right,
but I'm making up...

236
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,524
I'm making it up now.
I'll take the test.

237
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:02,755
Just close your eyes and think if it was
reversed you'd be really bummed out.

238
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:06,197
Let me do that. I'm closing my eyes,
but now I'm asking you...

239
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,360
the situation's reversed.
I need the kidney.

240
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:10,029
- Yeah?
- What are you saying?

241
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,901
Would you take
the test?

242
00:12:11,938 --> 00:12:14,839
- I'd probably want to leap at it.
- Probably leap at it?

243
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,934
- L...
- You'd leap out the window.

244
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:20,276
Let me say this: I would have gone on
record at the deli.

245
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:21,940
Hello.

246
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:23,950
Yeah, this is
Larry David.

247
00:12:23,984 --> 00:12:26,283
Um...

248
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,289
yeah, I was at
a Jack in the Box.

249
00:12:29,323 --> 00:12:31,291
Yeah. Pete.

250
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:34,294
Oh, Christ.
Really?

251
00:12:34,328 --> 00:12:36,922
Well, what's the address?

252
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,768
So, um, you know,

253
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,775
I've decided
to take the test.

254
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:50,074
- The kidney test for Lewis?
- Oh, good for you.

255
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:51,909
That's really noble.

256
00:12:51,947 --> 00:12:53,915
- It's the right thing to do.
- Yeah.

257
00:12:53,949 --> 00:12:57,248
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

258
00:12:57,286 --> 00:12:59,811
I was kind of wondering
why you're not doing it.

259
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:01,881
Why should I do it?

260
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:04,519
You're his manager. You're his friend.
Why shouldn't you do it?

261
00:13:04,561 --> 00:13:08,463
A lot of people who have managers
and friends need kidneys.

262
00:13:08,498 --> 00:13:10,363
What does that have
to do with anything?

263
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,163
I don't even know
what that means.

264
00:13:12,202 --> 00:13:14,432
- You're his friend. You're his manager.
- Yeah yeah?

265
00:13:14,471 --> 00:13:16,564
You're close to him.
You should be taking the test too.

266
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:18,301
You're his oldest
and closest friend.

267
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,401
So it's a question of longevity?
That's it?

268
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:23,208
You're his oldest and closest friend.
That makes the most sense.

269
00:13:23,247 --> 00:13:26,148
If you're married to your wife for three
years and I've known her for 20,

270
00:13:26,183 --> 00:13:28,811
who should give your wife the kidney?
I've known her longer.

271
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:31,287
By your logic,
I'm the one who should.

272
00:13:31,322 --> 00:13:33,586
If my wife needs a kidney,
you can give it to her.

273
00:13:33,624 --> 00:13:35,649
Oh, okay, so it's
longevity no matter what,

274
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:37,422
even if you're
married to her.

275
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:39,259
No, I'm saying
you seemed like

276
00:13:39,297 --> 00:13:41,595
you want to give her a kidney, so I'm
gonna let you.

277
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:43,897
You know, I'm loathe
to mention this, okay,

278
00:13:43,935 --> 00:13:46,403
but you are
an employee of mine.

279
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:50,173
Okay, you're
really reaching now.

280
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,267
- You're desperate, aren't you?
- A little.

281
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:54,141
Yeah, I know. You don't want to
give up your kidney.

282
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:56,044
- No, why should I?
- I know. Why should I?

283
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,913
- Why should I?
- Well, why should I?

284
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,783
- If I am, you should too.
- When did that rule come into effect?

285
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,845
- What's wrong with it?
- It's not a good rule.

286
00:14:02,889 --> 00:14:04,618
- It's a good rule.
- You have to draw a line.

287
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,124
Kidneys is past the line.

288
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,421
Hey!

289
00:14:09,462 --> 00:14:11,123
- Hey.
- Mr. Jones!

290
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:13,564
Mr. David, what
are you doing here?

291
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:16,262
Oh. It's kind
of a long story,

292
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:18,863
but I had a
burger with a...

293
00:14:18,906 --> 00:14:21,739
at a Jack in the Box
with some guy and now I'm his alibi.

294
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:24,403
Apparently, I've got to spot him
in a line-up or something.

295
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:26,708
- I don't know.
- Right.

296
00:14:26,747 --> 00:14:29,181
- Really, that's not the issue here.
- It's true, uh-huh.

297
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:31,343
- I have a bone to pick with you.
- Me?

298
00:14:31,385 --> 00:14:33,479
Do you have something
against receptionists?

299
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:37,184
I called up, I was very polite
and respectful,

300
00:14:37,225 --> 00:14:39,318
and she wants to know
what it's regarding.

301
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,022
- I don't see how it's her business...
- I had to talk her into staying.

302
00:14:42,063 --> 00:14:43,894
I'm a private eye,
not a psychologist.

303
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:45,456
She comes into
my office crying,

304
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,695
you know, wondering
what's going on.

305
00:14:47,735 --> 00:14:51,296
- She's a part of my business.
- Still, it's not you.

306
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:53,535
I mean, what if you
were a psychiatrist

307
00:14:53,576 --> 00:14:55,669
- and she said "What is it regarding?"
- There's protocol.

308
00:14:55,711 --> 00:14:58,407
"I'm planning on killing myself.
I want to talk to him."

309
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:01,644
It helps me save time and we ask
those questions so that we're prepared

310
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:03,345
when the phone call
does get to me.

311
00:15:03,385 --> 00:15:06,183
Okay. I'm sorry
if I did anything that...

312
00:15:06,222 --> 00:15:09,555
Hopefully we can we can avoid these
conflicts, you know?

313
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:11,618
How's the adoption
thing coming?

314
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,323
I'm working on some things.
I have some really nice leads

315
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:16,264
and I should have
something to you soon.

316
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,028
- Really? No kidding.
- Pretty soon.

317
00:15:18,068 --> 00:15:20,536
- Omar, good to see you.
- Hey, Ray, how you doing?

318
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,435
- How's Ellen?
- She's good. Pregnant again.

319
00:15:22,472 --> 00:15:24,440
- Really? Third one.
- You Mr. Greene?

320
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:27,204
- Mr. David.
- Mr. David. Ray.

321
00:15:27,244 --> 00:15:29,839
- That's... that's Mr. Greene.
- This is Larry?

322
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:32,111
- That's Mr. Greene.
- I'm Mr. David.

323
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:34,174
- You guys ever do a line-up?
- No.

324
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:36,152
- No.
- Piece of cake. They can't see you.

325
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:38,781
- Nothing to worry about. Come with me.
- Okay.

326
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:44,559
- Gentlemen, if you'll come in, please?
- I changed my mind.

327
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,928
- Move up to the glass please.
- I'll take the test.

328
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,364
- Really?
- Yeah.

329
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,129
- Wow.
- Yeah.

330
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:53,001
- Good for you.
- I'll take the test. Who knows?

331
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:55,302
You're taking the test,
I'll take the test.

332
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,103
Gentlemen, could I have you
step up to the glass?

333
00:15:57,142 --> 00:16:00,134
- That's very nice, very nice.
- He'll be very happy.

334
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:03,579
- No hurry here.
- All right, there he is.

335
00:16:03,615 --> 00:16:05,516
Second from the right.
That's him.

336
00:16:05,551 --> 00:16:07,382
- You're certain of that?
- Yeah. Pete.

337
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,320
- That's Pete?
- That's Pete.

338
00:16:09,355 --> 00:16:12,051
- The gentleman you had dinner with.
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

339
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:14,150
- What time of evening was this?
- 10:15.

340
00:16:14,193 --> 00:16:16,718
- 10:15? That's a late dinner.
- Yeah, 10:15.

341
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:19,163
My mother used to call
it a late night snack.

342
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:21,666
Dinner's between 5:00 and 8:00
generally.

343
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,693
- And this was with number two?
- Yeah, 5:00 and 8:00.

344
00:16:23,737 --> 00:16:26,137
You could start
at 8:00 though.

345
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,663
You know who Peter is?

346
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:31,303
He's a... he worked alongside
of a dental hygienist.

347
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:32,869
I know that.

348
00:16:32,913 --> 00:16:35,211
- And he did some landscaping.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

349
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:38,616
Are you gentlemen used to hanging
out with known felons?

350
00:16:38,652 --> 00:16:40,517
'Cause number two
is Peter Hagen,

351
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:42,750
AKA Peter the Tork,

352
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,089
Peter the Crybaby,
Wendell the Conspirator,

353
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:47,686
Joshua Lancel Stigmeyer.

354
00:16:47,729 --> 00:16:50,357
You two gentlemen
shared a meal

355
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:54,095
with number two on the 23rd...
approximately 10:15 P.M.

356
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:56,103
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

357
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:58,264
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

358
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:03,641
Let him go. You're
done here, gentlemen.

359
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:14,751
How do I let you
talk me into this?

360
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,486
What was I thinking?

361
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:19,518
Who needs this?

362
00:17:24,067 --> 00:17:25,694
I have good news,
gentlemen.

363
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:28,466
Both of your blood types
are compatible with Mr. Lewis

364
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,995
for his kidney transplant.

365
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:34,074
Good night, nurse.

366
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:36,579
Good night.

367
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,946
It's just a saying.

368
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:41,110
- I never heard of it.
- It's an old one.

369
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:43,143
- That's nice.
- It is.

370
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,984
- I know it is.
- Do you?

371
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,650
- Do you?
- I do.

372
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,283
- Good for you.
- It is good for me.

373
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:49,691
- You think so?
- I know so.

374
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:50,921
- I'm glad.
- So am I.

375
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:53,055
- That makes two of us.
- So you say.

376
00:17:53,097 --> 00:17:55,692
So I did.

377
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,884
Well, how are
we gonna decide?

378
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,846
We could...

379
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,323
we could play bingo.

380
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,985
Bingo?

381
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:22,256
- You know, it's... it's fair.
- Me play you in bingo?

382
00:18:22,295 --> 00:18:25,196
That's like asking me to play golf
against Tiger Woods. Play you in bingo?

383
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:27,722
- What? It's fair... it's a fair game.
- No, thank you.

384
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:30,702
No. No.

385
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,297
Doesn't he have a...
a cousin?

386
00:18:34,341 --> 00:18:37,674
- Yeah.
- Louis Lewis.

387
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,736
What's going on there?

388
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,271
He doesn't want to give up
his kidney until he's dead.

389
00:18:42,316 --> 00:18:44,784
Louis Lewis.

390
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:47,515
All right,
you know what?

391
00:18:47,555 --> 00:18:49,819
We'll let Lewis decide.
How about that?

392
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:52,418
Fine, let Lewis decide.
Yeah, sure sure.

393
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:54,190
I'll abide by his decision.
Will you?

394
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:56,197
Yeah, most definitely,
most definitely.

395
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:57,823
- I'm for that, I'm for that.
- Okay.

396
00:18:57,866 --> 00:19:00,664
- Let's shake on that. Okay.
- Sure sure.

397
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:03,262
Sure.
No campaigning.

398
00:19:03,305 --> 00:19:05,330
- No. No campaigning.
- No campaigning.

399
00:19:05,373 --> 00:19:07,841
I don't want to find out you've been
calling him up and saying,

400
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:11,040
- "Oh, he's a lot thinner than I am."
- Find out I've been saying?!

401
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,139
Oh, I'm more likely
to do it than you?

402
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:20,612
Hey.

403
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:22,419
Hey, Mr. David.

404
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:23,948
Um...

405
00:19:23,993 --> 00:19:26,393
first of all, I'm really sorry
about the other day.

406
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:28,660
I really had no idea
that you didn't know about that.

407
00:19:28,699 --> 00:19:32,032
I'm... I never would have
said anything, obviously.

408
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:35,902
Is he... is he in?

409
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,702
He's on the phone
with Jeff right now.

410
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:39,936
Ah.

411
00:19:39,977 --> 00:19:42,411
Well, what's
it regarding?

412
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:45,279
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

413
00:19:45,315 --> 00:19:48,251
- You didn't ask?
- Nope.

414
00:19:48,286 --> 00:19:51,187
Hmm. I wonder if he's campaigning in
there.

415
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,653
Oh, Jeez.

416
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,390
He didn't even
tell me now.

417
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,728
Now, you... you would
have found out eventually.

418
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:04,064
No, you...
you would have... oh, Jeez.

419
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,298
He's was... I'm sure
he was gonna tell you.

420
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,805
No, don't...
don't cry.

421
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,241
Oh, poor thing.
Oh, Jeez.

422
00:20:11,277 --> 00:20:14,075
Oh my gosh.
Oh dear.

423
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,445
It's all right,
it's okay.

424
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:19,212
Don't... don't worry.
I'm sure he was gonna tell you.

425
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:22,015
Yeah, no, don't worry.

426
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,647
There there, it's okay.

427
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,124
- Wait, what are you doing?
- What?

428
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,684
- What was that?
- What are you talking about?

429
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,923
What the hell, man?
Why did you touch my hair?

430
00:20:30,964 --> 00:20:32,431
I was consoling.

431
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:34,399
- I was consoling you.
- That wasn't consoling.

432
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,335
Touching hair is part
of my consolation routine.

433
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,565
No, it's really weird.
You're being really inappropriate.

434
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,632
- What? Inappropriate? Are you crazy?
- Yeah, you were.

435
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:44,042
Hey, what's... what is this?
Again?! Again?!

436
00:20:44,078 --> 00:20:45,943
She's... she's crazy!
I was consoling her!

437
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,039
- He was coming on to me!
- Are you a sociopath?!

438
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:50,812
I was consoling her
and I touched her hair.

439
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:53,718
- He was coming on to me!
- That's such baloney!

440
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:55,153
- I'm leaving.
- I was consoling her.

441
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:58,750
I touched her hair. She thinks
that's coming on, she's nuts.

442
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:01,319
What... what a whack job.

443
00:21:01,363 --> 00:21:04,059
Are you kidding me?! I was consoling
her! I was touching her hair.

444
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:06,067
- That's ridiculous!
- Mm-hmm.

445
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:08,797
She thinks I'm coming on to her? Get out
of here. Get the hell out of here.

446
00:21:08,837 --> 00:21:11,465
- You think she's leaving or quitting?
- That's a good question.

447
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:13,167
I don't know.
She said she's leaving.

448
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:15,335
- Oh, what a hassle.
- Is that leaving or quitting?

449
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:17,675
- I don't know.
- Same thing happened with Cheryl.

450
00:21:17,713 --> 00:21:19,978
She said she was leaving.
I thought she was leaving me.

451
00:21:20,016 --> 00:21:22,075
She's just going out
to have lunch with her friend.

452
00:21:22,118 --> 00:21:24,586
Cheryl... right now,
look at this... are you...

453
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:26,589
- you really have evidenced...
- What?

454
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:28,250
...some pretty
erratic behavior.

455
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:30,657
Get out of here.
I was touching her hair. She's crazy.

456
00:21:30,693 --> 00:21:32,593
Unbelievable.

457
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:33,857
So um...

458
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:37,333
did you get the news?
Huh?

459
00:21:37,368 --> 00:21:39,598
- Thanks. Yeah yeah.
- Huh? How about that?

460
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:41,605
I'm a lucky man
to have two of you guys

461
00:21:41,639 --> 00:21:43,470
come through for me.
Thank you.

462
00:21:43,507 --> 00:21:45,168
Hey, far out.

463
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:46,733
So there you go.
You've got your choice.

464
00:21:46,777 --> 00:21:50,110
- Two... two kidneys.
- Wow!

465
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:52,308
- Of course...
- Very grateful, man.

466
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,374
You know, I...

467
00:21:54,418 --> 00:21:56,580
I am considerably
older than him.

468
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:59,419
And I'm not gonna... I don't want to get
into that whole game.

469
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:00,947
But, you know, he's...

470
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:04,120
there's a difference
when you're younger, obviously.

471
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:05,857
Nah, a kidney's
a kidney's a kidney.

472
00:22:05,897 --> 00:22:08,695
I'm not so sure about that,
but you know, whatever.

473
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:12,100
His are bigger too.
It's a big hefty kidney,

474
00:22:12,137 --> 00:22:14,038
could handle a big load
I think, you know?

475
00:22:14,073 --> 00:22:17,008
You could start drinking
again if you wanted to with that thing.

476
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,567
- That, uh...
- Well, in case...

477
00:22:18,611 --> 00:22:20,806
...that hurt my feelings
a little bit, buddy.

478
00:22:20,846 --> 00:22:23,144
- Maybe not that.
- 11 years sober. Thank you.

479
00:22:23,182 --> 00:22:26,481
But, you know, uh...
that's all.

480
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,716
Other than the fact that, you know,
there's a lot about me that

481
00:22:29,755 --> 00:22:31,986
when I got out of college,
you don't know about.

482
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:33,390
I really didn't
know you then, so...

483
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:35,554
Please, I've been
through everything.

484
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,586
Well, I don't think
you did what I did, but...

485
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,189
Trust me. Times 30.

486
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,756
Uh, you're not really
getting my drift.

487
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,598
- Listen, it... you're both a match?
- Yeah.

488
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,001
I don't care how you figure it out.
You know what?

489
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:46,005
Flip a coin, man.

490
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:48,030
Eeny meeny miney moe.
What do I care?

491
00:22:50,945 --> 00:22:52,913
- Okay.
- All right?

492
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:56,007
And stay away
from her, will you?

493
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:58,041
Whack job.

494
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,890
I got to start with me.

495
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:06,553
Eeny meeny miney moe, catch a tiger
by the toe. If he hollers, let him go.

496
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,530
My mother says to pick this one
and out goes Y-O-U.

497
00:23:09,565 --> 00:23:12,659
Start with me.
Start with me. Start with me.

498
00:23:14,036 --> 00:23:16,504
Okay, I'm gonna
flip this coin

499
00:23:16,538 --> 00:23:18,438
and this will be
the kidney decider, all right?

500
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:22,240
Um, why don't we do
Eeny meeny?

501
00:23:22,277 --> 00:23:23,608
I thought we were
gonna do a coin flip.

502
00:23:23,645 --> 00:23:24,771
Let's do Eeny meeny.

503
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:27,248
- We agreed on a coin flip.
- I think I'd rather do Eeny meeny.

504
00:23:27,283 --> 00:23:29,251
- Fine.
- We'll do Eeny meeny miney moe.

505
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:31,253
- Let's just do it, okay?
- Fine.

506
00:23:31,287 --> 00:23:33,448
- All right, go.
- All right.

507
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:35,890
And before we go,
I want to say something to you guys

508
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:38,917
and I mean this.
I admire the both of you.

509
00:23:38,962 --> 00:23:42,090
What you're doing
is an unbelievable act of friendship.

510
00:23:42,132 --> 00:23:45,398
I just wish I had a kidney match
so I could be involved.

511
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:47,461
Well, you haven't
taken the test.

512
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:49,564
Are you ready
to do Eeny meeny?

513
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:52,201
- Yeah.
- Do you want to take the test?

514
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:54,939
No, I don't think I'm a match anyway.
Let's just do Eeny meeny.

515
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:57,846
Who wants to be Eeny?

516
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:00,112
- I'll be Eeny.
- Yeah, you can be Eeny.

517
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:01,448
- Okay.
- He'll be Eeny.

518
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:02,679
How come you want me
to be Eeny?

519
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,382
No, it's good.
You should be Eeny.

520
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:07,790
That's what you want, right? Don't you
want to be Eeny?

521
00:24:07,826 --> 00:24:10,226
Want me to be Eeny?
Do you want me to be Eeny?

522
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:12,253
- I'll be Eeny. I'll be Eeny.
- Okay.

523
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:14,060
Okay, here we go.

524
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:17,432
Eeny meeny miney moe,
catch a tiger by the toe.

525
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,300
If he hollers,
let him go.

526
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:22,466
My mother says
to pick this one

527
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:24,499
and out goes Y-O-U.

528
00:24:24,544 --> 00:24:26,034
Yeah yeah yeah!

529
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:28,103
- What are you excited about?
- No, what do you mean?

530
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:29,637
- What are you so happy about?
- I won!

531
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:31,343
- No, you lost!
- Out goes Y-O-U!

532
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:32,874
No, you lost!
You're out. You're it.

533
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,580
- No no no no no.
- Yes yes.

534
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,350
- No, out goes Y-O-U. You're the loser.
- You you!

535
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,654
- You're the loser.
- No, you're the loser.

536
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,991
- Tell him, tell him, tell him.
- Hold on a minute.

537
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:45,430
Out goes Y-O-U
give the kidney.

538
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,730
- You give the kidney.
- No no no.

539
00:24:47,768 --> 00:24:50,896
You stupid idiots! You don't even know
how to play Eeny meeny miney moe.

540
00:24:50,938 --> 00:24:53,338
- We're idiots?!
- I don't know how to play Eeny meeny?

541
00:24:53,373 --> 00:24:55,102
You don't know the first
thing about Eeny meeny!

542
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:57,872
- Y-O-U. Your'e out.
- No, I'm safe.

543
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,675
What the hell is all
this screaming about?

544
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:02,274
- Lose with dignity.
- All right, wait a second.

545
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:05,218
We're playing
Eeny meeny miney moe, okay?

546
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,551
- Out goes Y-O-U.
- Right, you're it.

547
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,284
- Who's it?
- You're it.

548
00:25:09,324 --> 00:25:11,554
- Out goes Y-O-U.
- No, that person's safe.

549
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:14,790
- He's you.
- No, and out goes Y-O-U.

550
00:25:14,829 --> 00:25:16,990
You're it.
You're it.

551
00:25:17,032 --> 00:25:20,468
- You're it. You lose.
- You fucking idiots here!

552
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:22,767
What are we talking about anyway?
Losing what?

553
00:25:22,805 --> 00:25:24,796
They're giving a kidney
to Richard Lewis.

554
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,239
- He's the one.
- He lost.

555
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:28,243
Excuse me, you're not giving
your fucking kidney.

556
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,040
What if one your kids
needs a kidney one day?

557
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,445
You're gonna give a kidney
to Richard Lewis? No no no!

558
00:25:32,481 --> 00:25:34,972
- You'll give it to 'em.
- I might not be the match.

559
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:37,885
He needs his kidney, number one. Number
two, he's a fat fuck.

560
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:40,719
- He can't even survive surgery.
- How do you know?

561
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:43,157
You are healthy and thin.
You're giving the kidney.

562
00:25:43,193 --> 00:25:45,058
End of discussion,
moot point.

563
00:26:15,227 --> 00:26:17,821
Out goes Y-O-U.

564
00:26:17,863 --> 00:26:20,354
So I'm out.
I'm the winner.

565
00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:22,367
No, that means
you're out

566
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:24,266
and the other people
stay in.

567
00:26:24,303 --> 00:26:26,498
That's if you're playing
with more than two.

568
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:29,507
If you're playing
with just two people,

569
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,339
then the one who's out
is the winner...

570
00:26:31,377 --> 00:26:34,744
out goes Y-O-U.
I'm out, he's in.

571
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:36,646
He's the winner.

572
00:26:36,683 --> 00:26:38,207
Have you ever played
Eeny meeny miney moe?

573
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,617
- Yeah, I have. That's how it works.
- Have you?

574
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:43,952
Listen, I grew up with Eeny meeny
miney moe... grew up with it.

575
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:46,959
- I did too!
- I know the rules of the game.

576
00:26:48,996 --> 00:26:50,987
I think you're being
a baby right now.

577
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,999
You know,
it's totally unfair.

578
00:26:53,033 --> 00:26:55,297
I take care of myself
all these years...

579
00:26:55,336 --> 00:26:58,032
the diet, the exercise,
the whole thing,

580
00:26:58,072 --> 00:27:00,040
for what?

581
00:27:00,074 --> 00:27:03,100
I'd have been better off
just eating crap and smoking.

582
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:07,079
That's what I should have been doing all
these years... eating crap and smoking.

583
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:09,083
Maybe this is why
you were saved

584
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:11,915
when you were
drowning that day.

585
00:27:11,953 --> 00:27:14,421
Maybe this is...

586
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:16,890
the reason.

587
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,722
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

588
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,819
Oh, he saved me
so I can give up a kidney?

589
00:27:20,862 --> 00:27:23,831
That's why?
If he wants to get so involved,

590
00:27:23,865 --> 00:27:27,427
why doesn't he just fix his kidney
tonight while he's sleeping

591
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,462
instead of going through
all this drowning-saving business?

592
00:27:32,508 --> 00:27:35,068
Well, I think you're
doing the right thing.

593
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:37,579
Don't you feel good
about doing this for Richard?

594
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:39,478
- No.
- Yes you do.

595
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:41,847
I don't.
I feel awful.

596
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:43,943
Think about how
he's feeling right now.

597
00:27:43,986 --> 00:27:45,579
He feels good.

598
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,556
- Well, doesn't that make you feel good?
- No.

599
00:27:47,591 --> 00:27:49,388
- Well, you should.
- I don't.

600
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:51,155
- You're gonna be okay.
- I'm not.

601
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:52,661
- Yes you are.
- No I'm not.

602
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,823
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

603
00:27:54,865 --> 00:27:56,127
- Really?
- Yeah.

604
00:27:57,768 --> 00:28:01,067
- Aww.
- Thank you.

605
00:28:01,104 --> 00:28:03,869
Okay, you're welcome.
I'll be here.

606
00:28:03,908 --> 00:28:06,103
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you...

607
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:09,079
- What are you doing?
- What?

608
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:11,673
- What?
- You're turning consolation into sex?

609
00:28:11,716 --> 00:28:14,947
Well, that's the ultimate
form of consolation.

610
00:28:14,986 --> 00:28:17,511
- No, it's not.
- Yeah, sure it is.

611
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:19,887
Okay, just forget it.

612
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:23,554
You were consoling me
and that's... that's consolation to me.

613
00:28:23,595 --> 00:28:26,587
Sex is consolation.
Isn't that consolation. No?

614
00:28:26,632 --> 00:28:28,998
This has been
the third hold-up

615
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:31,969
of a Jack in the Box
in the past two months.

616
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:35,405
Police believe that the suspect,
Peter Hagen, is responsible.

617
00:28:35,441 --> 00:28:37,671
Hey, that's that guy Pete...
the guy I got out of jail.

618
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,679
The victim of the shooting
in this case,

619
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:41,738
a Mr. Louis Lewis...

620
00:28:41,781 --> 00:28:45,376
cousin of actor-comedian
Richard Lewis, is in a coma

621
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:48,444
and is not expected
to survive.

622
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:51,514
This is Kelvin Han Yee
live from Studio City.
