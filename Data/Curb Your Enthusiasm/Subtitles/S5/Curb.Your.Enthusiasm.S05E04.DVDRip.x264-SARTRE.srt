1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,163


2
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:16,154
Ahh, chicken teriyaki boy!

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,032
Chicken teriyaki boy!

4
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:20,865
- Gentlemen!
- Chicken.

5
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:25,738
I loved it when
it was so big, you know?

6
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:28,573
Until today,
I never even thought about that,

7
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,511
'cause usually...
hello!

8
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,036
- Hello.
- You remember Yoshi.

9
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:34,481
- Yoshi, hey!
- Hello, nice to see you.

10
00:00:34,517 --> 00:00:36,508
I like that, a little bow.
See that?

11
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:38,544
- I did.
- I love that bow.

12
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:41,456
I am nuts about that bow.
It humbles you.

13
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:44,893
And we've got so many
cocky people in this country.

14
00:00:44,928 --> 00:00:46,896
They need the humility
of the bow here.

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,398
- It's big in Japan.
- You should see

16
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:51,993
some of the sculptures
that we saw today.

17
00:00:52,035 --> 00:00:53,400
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm,

18
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:54,995
there's one
that I think will be

19
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,699
perfect in our house
once we get back to it.

20
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,506
- Tell him about...
- We're looking for a big penis.

21
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:02,535
Did they have anything
at the gallery?

22
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:04,604
- Uh, not quite, no.
- He's... no.

23
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,378
- With some big balls...
- Okay, we've actually been talking...

24
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:10,477
- That's nice.
- Seriously about art, and it's not...

25
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:12,512
Look at this.
"Cofey was here."

26
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,786
- Mmm.
- What kind of moron is this Cofey,

27
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,487
- carving his nick... what is that?
- It's a shame.

28
00:01:17,528 --> 00:01:19,689
- Yeah, it's very childish.
- Takes a knife out

29
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,891
- and carves into the table?
- Inappropriate.

30
00:01:21,932 --> 00:01:23,627
- How inappropriate is that?
- Mmm.

31
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,659
Hey, by the way,

32
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:27,694
my dad and your dad

33
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,139
are becoming very friendly
in that nursing home.

34
00:01:30,175 --> 00:01:32,109
- Yes, yes.
- Oh no, isn't that cute?

35
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,771
- Yeah.
- It was just his 80th birthday party.

36
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:36,610
We took him to Japan.

37
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:38,479
- No kidding?
- Really?

38
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,984
Yes, he hadn't been back
since the war.

39
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:43,544
He saw
some of his family...

40
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:45,818
- Oh my gosh.
...and some of his military buddies

41
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:47,848
- from the Air Force.
- He was in the war?

42
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:50,190
- Huh, wow.
- What did he do in the war?

43
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:53,425
- He was a pilot.
- Really? What kind of a pilot?

44
00:01:53,464 --> 00:01:56,865
- A kamikaze pilot.
- Wow.

45
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:58,869
Mmm.

46
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:00,530
- Hmm.
- Wow.

47
00:02:00,572 --> 00:02:05,271
- Wouldn't he be dead?
- Um, not all of them died.

48
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,609
I know, but kamikaze pilot
kind of implies

49
00:02:08,646 --> 00:02:10,637
that, you know...
a kamikaze pilot

50
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:12,947
is a pilot who crashed
and died, right?

51
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,953
- But he didn't.
- He survived, yes.

52
00:02:14,987 --> 00:02:16,887
- Thank goodness for that.
- He survived?

53
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:19,891
- Here's to... what did you say?
- Kanpai.

54
00:02:19,925 --> 00:02:22,120
What happened exactly?
Did he try

55
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:24,721
and crash the plane
into a ship?

56
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:28,130
Ahem, he grazed the ship.

57
00:02:29,802 --> 00:02:31,997
- Mmm.
- Okay.

58
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:34,597
- All right.
- All right, he grazed the ship.

59
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,904
- He grazed it.
- Hmm, is that because

60
00:02:36,942 --> 00:02:39,911
there was some kind of malfunction
with the plane?

61
00:02:39,945 --> 00:02:41,913
It doesn't really matter.
He grazed it...

62
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:43,847
- I'm just curious.
...and he lived, and...

63
00:02:43,883 --> 00:02:46,579
- And he is alive.
...and he's alive.

64
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:48,712
Yeah, but at the last
second, what happened?

65
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:50,847
Was he coming down,
all of a sudden, he said,

66
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,257
you know, "Jesus, this kamikaze
business might not be for me.

67
00:02:54,293 --> 00:02:57,228
I think maybe I'II...
go back to base"?

68
00:02:57,263 --> 00:03:01,098
- Okay, you know, it's...
- Was is something like that, huh?

69
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:03,398
So what happened
at the last second there?

70
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:07,164
I'm uncertain.

71
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,505
- Hmm.
- You know what's good

72
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:12,477
is the rainbow roll,
because it gives you

73
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,208
- a little bit of everything. Hi.
- Are you ready to order?

74
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:18,274
- Yes.
- I will have the chicken teriyaki.

75
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:20,309
Chicken teriyaki.

76
00:03:20,353 --> 00:03:22,344
Chicken!

77
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,482
Chicken.

78
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,958
Chicken!

79
00:03:27,961 --> 00:03:29,394
How about you, Yosh?

80
00:03:29,429 --> 00:03:31,420
A little chicken?

81
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:36,758
So, you know, I hired
a private investigator

82
00:03:36,803 --> 00:03:38,270
to find out
if I'm adopted.

83
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:39,670
What do you care now for?

84
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,765
Isn't the damage done already
from your parents?

85
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:44,470
I wouldn't want to know,
to be honest with you.

86
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:46,502
Hey, how's Lewis?
You hear from Lewis?

87
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:48,538
He's... something wrong
with his kidney.

88
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:50,607
Oh yeah?
What, like a stone or something?

89
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,312
I don't know what he's got.
He's getting tests.

90
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:54,981
- Fold your card.
- I just know he's concerned.

91
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:57,217
He gets so worked up.
Doesn't surprise me.

92
00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:59,590
- He doesn't look that good.
- I'm in.

93
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:01,891
I present to you a straight
with a seven high.

94
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:04,329
- Thank you very much.
- It's no good. I got a flush.

95
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,663
- Again?
- Yeah, that's a nice hand.

96
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:09,568
- I think it's a trick deck.
- He was born to poker players

97
00:04:09,603 --> 00:04:12,367
- and given up for adoption.
- Here are some pretzels.

98
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:14,237
Oh, thank you.

99
00:04:14,275 --> 00:04:16,175
Did the pizza place
call by any chance?

100
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,202
- Hey, isn't your brother playing?
- Yeah, where's Yoshi?

101
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:21,976
Yeah, what happened to your brother?
He told me last night

102
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:24,507
- he was coming.
- Yeah, Yoshi's supposed to be here.

103
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:27,180
But I can't get a hold of him.
Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

104
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:29,917
Hey, so our fathers are
becoming very friendly

105
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:31,925
- at the nursing home.
- Really?

106
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,189
- We should all get together.
- Absolutely!

107
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:36,220
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- Oh.

108
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:38,926
- I'm gonna play a little bingo.
- Maybe your father.

109
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:41,492
- Bingo is the only thing...
- I'm gonna check on pizza.

110
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:43,902
- That I feel any optimism about.
- You play bingo?

111
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:46,407
When I play I think I'm gonna win.
Isn't that insane?

112
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:47,965
- Do you win?
- I do win.

113
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,376
It's completely random.

114
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:52,642
I know it's random.
I have a winning percentage

115
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:54,672
- that defies logic.
- Hello, yeah.

116
00:04:54,716 --> 00:04:57,446
You win more often
than the other people?

117
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,954
- He gets more diagonals than anybody.
- What?

118
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:02,456
Oh my God.
What...

119
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:04,925
Cedars Sinai, okay.
We'll be right there. Bye.

120
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,757
- What's wrong?
- Mayuki,

121
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:09,263
- Yoshi tried to commit suicide.
- What?!

122
00:05:09,297 --> 00:05:11,595
He tried to commit suicide.
Cedars Sinai.

123
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:14,067
- I gotta leave. I'll be back.
- Let's... okay.

124
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:16,093
- Get the coat.
- Here's the coat.

125
00:05:16,138 --> 00:05:17,833
- Keys keys keys.
- Yes, it's in here.

126
00:05:17,873 --> 00:05:20,205
Let's go.

127
00:05:25,314 --> 00:05:27,282
Wow.

128
00:05:27,316 --> 00:05:29,307
Suicide?

129
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:32,878
- Jeez Louise!
- Oh wow.

130
00:05:34,757 --> 00:05:36,748
I just saw him last night.

131
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:38,693
We had dinner with him.

132
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:41,390
You did?
Did he seem weird?

133
00:05:42,865 --> 00:05:46,266
- No.
- Was he nervous? Was he anxious?

134
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:48,896
Could he have lost face
or have been ashamed

135
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:50,929
or humiliated
or anything?

136
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:56,968
Uh...

137
00:06:02,418 --> 00:06:04,409
So...

138
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,445
what should we do?

139
00:06:11,428 --> 00:06:14,522
Well, you know,

140
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,556
- we're here.
- We are here.

141
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,591
That's true,
because, you know,

142
00:06:18,635 --> 00:06:21,763
I had to really finagle
to get out tonight.

143
00:06:21,805 --> 00:06:23,602
I'm kinda happy
to be anywhere.

144
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,200
And you know,
we can't leave the house.

145
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:29,269
- It's... they're gone.
- We don't have keys.

146
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:31,611
And we don't know
the alarm code or anything.

147
00:06:31,648 --> 00:06:34,412
- And a pizza is coming.
- Got a pizza coming.

148
00:06:34,451 --> 00:06:36,419
Yeah, got a pizza coming.

149
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:38,648
And he tried, he didn't
actually kill himself.

150
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,884
- Right.
- That's a very good distinction.

151
00:06:40,924 --> 00:06:42,858
- Because if he said he tried to...
- Right.

152
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:44,758
That means he didn't,
which means he's alive.

153
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:47,696
- He's here.
- Thank God.

154
00:06:47,731 --> 00:06:49,096
A pair of fours.

155
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,397
I'm gonna see what else
is in the fridge.

156
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,353
What the hell is going on?

157
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,382
- Hey.
- How's Yoshi?

158
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:17,417
- You're still playing?
- Yeah.

159
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:19,453
- I took an orange.
- You want some pizza?

160
00:07:19,497 --> 00:07:22,694
- What are you doing here?
- What do you mean?

161
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,225
Yoshi's in the hospital.
He tried to commit suicide!

162
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,261
- How's he doing?
- He's okay, right?

163
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:30,138
How's he doing?!
He almost killed himself!

164
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:32,735
- We figured it was...
- I told you guys we should leave.

165
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:34,802
- You figured what?
- You never said that.

166
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:36,905
- Hey, get out!
- You ordered another pizza!

167
00:07:36,948 --> 00:07:38,939
- Get the fuck out.
- What?

168
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:41,076
It's over.
It's over. Out.

169
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:43,917
Out. Out. It's over. It's over.
Leave. Leave.

170
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,356
- We didn't even settle up!
- Out!

171
00:07:46,392 --> 00:07:48,826
- I was up about $400.
- Let's go. Out. Out.

172
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,829
- Man, oh man.
- Let's go.

173
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:53,855
Pizza was coming, it would have
been rude to leave a pizza guy...

174
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,629
It would have been rude to stop
and pick it up on your way home, too.

175
00:07:56,669 --> 00:07:59,331
- We didn't know your alarm code.
- I don't have an alarm!

176
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:01,965
Hey, did Yoshi
mention my name?

177
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,873
He's got tubes
coming out of his mouth.

178
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:07,902
- That means no.
- Okay. All right.

179
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,915
- Get the fuck out.
- All right.

180
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:12,611
Say hello for me
if you see him.

181
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:21,089
Oh my God, did you hear
what happened to Yoshi?

182
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,186
Yeah, he's okay, though.
He didn't... he's fine.

183
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,221
- Thank God!
- Yeah.

184
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:29,666
- How do you know?
- He sent me a suicide email.

185
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:32,866
A suicide email?!

186
00:08:32,906 --> 00:08:35,932
He had some things
he wanted to say before he...

187
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:37,967
What did he say?

188
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:40,206
It's very private, Larry.

189
00:08:40,247 --> 00:08:42,909
Hey, we're married,
you know.

190
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:44,940
It's part of the whole
marriage thing.

191
00:08:44,985 --> 00:08:47,715
I have to tell you,
when you get married,

192
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:50,780
you not only get the sex,
but you get all the other stuff too.

193
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:53,850
All the information from the wife
who doesn't hold any secrets.

194
00:08:53,893 --> 00:08:56,919
If he wanted you to see it,
he would have copied you.

195
00:08:58,732 --> 00:09:00,700
Did he copy other people?

196
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,725
He CC'd
a few people, yes.

197
00:09:06,473 --> 00:09:08,464
Are you kidding?!

198
00:09:09,476 --> 00:09:11,171
I wanna know.
What did he say?

199
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:13,577
Stop it!
I'll delete it.

200
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:15,376
I'll delete it.
Stop it, get off me.

201
00:09:17,517 --> 00:09:20,282
N-44.

202
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:23,347
- Four four!
- You're so noisy.

203
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:25,951
- One to go.
- I don't believe it.

204
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:30,020
- Need one!
- G-41.

205
00:09:30,064 --> 00:09:32,055
- G-41.
- 41, yeah.

206
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,794
G-41.
Not in my purview.

207
00:09:33,834 --> 00:09:36,632
Not in my purview.

208
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:39,333
L-20.

209
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:41,364
- L-20.
- L-20?

210
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:43,502
- L-20.
- Bingo!

211
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:45,535
Oh, he has...
oh my.

212
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,570
- Bingo.
- I don't believe it.

213
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:49,674
- Bingo.
- All right.

214
00:09:49,717 --> 00:09:52,242
- Let me see, let me...
- You're not the checker.

215
00:09:52,286 --> 00:09:55,278
- Lenore is the checker.
- Lenore, Lenore, check this out.

216
00:09:55,323 --> 00:09:57,450
- Bingo. Watch.
- Let's see it.

217
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:59,482
Okay...

218
00:10:00,728 --> 00:10:02,696
Okay, I'm sorry, sir.

219
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,789
I did not call l-17.

220
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:07,427
- What are you talking about?
- No, I never did.

221
00:10:07,469 --> 00:10:09,460
- Yeah, l-17.
- That is not correct.

222
00:10:09,504 --> 00:10:12,530
- I did not call l-17.
- You... excuse me, excuse me...

223
00:10:12,574 --> 00:10:14,804
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha.
Cheat.

224
00:10:14,843 --> 00:10:17,607
- All right, just be patient.
- You called l-17.

225
00:10:17,646 --> 00:10:20,410
- Let me see that pad.
- No, you're not gonna see this pad.

226
00:10:20,449 --> 00:10:23,350
- Nobody checks out this pad.
- Why can't I check out your pad?

227
00:10:23,385 --> 00:10:25,751
Because I never let anyone

228
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:28,119
- look at my pad.
- Really? Aha.

229
00:10:28,156 --> 00:10:30,590
- She never does.
- Good for you, Lenore.

230
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:33,321
We're going to continue
with the game.

231
00:10:33,362 --> 00:10:35,796
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Just try to relax.

232
00:10:35,831 --> 00:10:38,265
You gotta listen to her.
She knows what she's doing.

233
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,200
Well, listen,
she's my friend.

234
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:47,768
G-55.

235
00:10:47,809 --> 00:10:49,777
What's the number?

236
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:51,608
- I don't know the number.
- Bingo!

237
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,511
- Oh, she... oh, she has...
- Bingo!

238
00:10:53,548 --> 00:10:55,141
- Oh!
- She has bingo.

239
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,482
- Ruthie, do we have bingo?
- Ooh-ooh.

240
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,511
- B-l-N-G-O!
- Let me see, Ruthie.

241
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:01,546
- There it is.
- Oh, well...

242
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:04,492
- She has the bingo.
- Oh yes, perfect!

243
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:07,223
- Yes, of course.
- Ruthie gets a dollar!

244
00:11:07,263 --> 00:11:10,255
Ha-ha, I won a dollar!

245
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:13,291
I won, everybody!
I won!

246
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:15,497
- Bingo!
- Oh, sit down. Sit down.

247
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,803
I had bingo.
You all know I had bingo.

248
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:22,902
And I won your dollar.

249
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:26,574
There's something fishy
going on in this place.

250
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:29,585
I'm gonna buy you
a piece of cheesecake.

251
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:32,281
Thank you very much.
I love cheesecake.

252
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:39,959
...101.
Actually I took the 110

253
00:11:39,996 --> 00:11:42,727
- up to the... through the pass.
- Oh, hey.

254
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:45,257
Hello.

255
00:11:45,302 --> 00:11:47,202
Hey, my wife tells me

256
00:11:47,237 --> 00:11:49,000
Yoshi's doing great.

257
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,030
Yeah, he's fine.
He's home now.

258
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:53,269
Good news!
Fantastic.

259
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,939
Let me ask you something.
Have you ever played in that bingo game?

260
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,143
Have you ever noticed
anything strange going on there?

261
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:02,778
I need to talk
to you, Larry.

262
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:07,181
Don't, don't try
to get involved.

263
00:12:07,224 --> 00:12:09,249
Don't try to pretend
you're concerned.

264
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:10,885
- I was concerned.
- Concerned?

265
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:12,691
When we went to the hospital,
I come back,

266
00:12:12,729 --> 00:12:15,197
you guys are all still
playing poker, smoking, eating pizza.

267
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:18,224
That's why we were there,
because we were concerned.

268
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:22,261
We wanted to show support, so when you
got home your buddies would be there

269
00:12:22,306 --> 00:12:24,501
and you're turning it
into a bad thing.

270
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,304
Yoshi tried
to commit suicide,

271
00:12:26,343 --> 00:12:28,277
and you just completely
put it out of your head.

272
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:30,679
We didn't put it out.
We thought of it between hands.

273
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:32,774
Here's what you should be
concerned about...

274
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:36,253
you're the reason why Yoshi
tried to commit suicide.

275
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:37,982
Come on,
how's that possible?

276
00:12:38,022 --> 00:12:40,047
The whole kamikaze thing.

277
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:42,082
I was curious about it,
so I asked.

278
00:12:42,126 --> 00:12:44,219
Excuse me for having
a curious mind

279
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:46,162
that asks questions
of people.

280
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:48,927
I'm curious about how you can be
a kamikaze pilot

281
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,128
- and still be alive.
- There's a lot

282
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,160
of kamikaze pilots
that are still alive.

283
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:55,832
You say that,
and I say to you,

284
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,842
they are not
kamikaze pilots.

285
00:12:57,876 --> 00:13:00,606
"He grazed the ship."
That sounds to me like

286
00:13:00,645 --> 00:13:04,240
"I think I might head home.
This is fucking insane."

287
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,251
You taunted him,
you called him chicken.

288
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,480
I didn't call him chicken,
I ordered chicken!

289
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,148
- You called him chicken.
- I ordered chicken, you idiot.

290
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:13,419
There's a difference.
Here's the difference.

291
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,756
"You're a chicken."
"I'll have some chicken."

292
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:18,092
"You're a chicken."
"I'd like a piece of chicken."

293
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,564
Well, he understood it
as you calling him a chicken.

294
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,295
He must have taken it
the wrong way.

295
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,929
And what about you
sweeping the chips off the table?

296
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,962
You cost me a lot of money.
I know for a fact

297
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,532
you were down $300.
You actually owe me $300

298
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,306
- if you wanna get technical about it.
- I'll tell you what.

299
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,836
I'll get your chips back,
you'll get your money back,

300
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,645
but you're gotta do one thing...
you gotta call Yoshi at home

301
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,982
and apologize for the whole
kamikaze statement

302
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,318
- and the chicken thing.
- Okay, I will.

303
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:45,380
- Okay.
- I'm gonna call him and apologize.

304
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:47,449
- Okay.
- I'll use my dad's phone.

305
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,320
Hello.

306
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,696
Oh, hey, Yoshi,
this is Larry David.

307
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,724
Oh, hello Larry.

308
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,431
I'm actually...
I'm calling to apologize.

309
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,439
I'm sorry
if I said anything

310
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,907
that might have been
inappropriate.

311
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,380
I didn't really mean
anything to happen.

312
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,041
I was just kinda curious...

313
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,209
...with the whole
kamikaze thing.

314
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,482
- You know, I hope...
- Are you eating something?

315
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,285
I'm eating
pistachio nuts.

316
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,315
You're eating
pistachio nuts

317
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,122
while you're
apologizing to me?

318
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,958
Yes, so?

319
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,987
You can't be sincere
about apologizing

320
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,862
and then snack
on pistachio nuts!

321
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,595
What?
I can eat and apologize.

322
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,001
There's no pistachio crunching
in apologizing.

323
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,234
I respectfully disagree.
I've snacked and apologized many times

324
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,936
and everyone's always accepted it
quite graciously.

325
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,275
That might be the way
you do things in your family,

326
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,939
but we don't snack
and apologize...

327
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,211
What, is that
a Japanese thing?

328
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:45,149
No!
No, that's a human thing...

329
00:14:45,185 --> 00:14:48,882
Hey, did you mention me
in that suicide email?

330
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:58,696
- Hi.
- Oh Larry, I'm glad to see you.

331
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:01,201
- How are you, Dr. Skadden?
- I'm good. How's your dad?

332
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,669
- I think he's doing well.
- He's doing real well.

333
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:06,104
I'm gonna write him
a little prescription though.

334
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,131
- Maybe you want to have it filled.
- Okay.

335
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,973
- A little blood thinner.
- Um...

336
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:13,640
you know, I'm kinda glad
I ran into you.

337
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:15,911
I wanna talk to you a little bit
about something

338
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,679
that happened
to me today.

339
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:20,084
Let's keep this between
the two of us, okay?

340
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:23,522
- Sure.
- In the bingo game today...

341
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,152
I won, I yelled "Bingo."

342
00:15:27,194 --> 00:15:29,526
Lenore, the woman
who runs the game,

343
00:15:29,563 --> 00:15:31,531
came over,
looked at my card

344
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:33,624
and said she didn't call
one of the numbers.

345
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,863
Now look, I can hear
better than anybody

346
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,565
in that room, okay?
She called my number.

347
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:42,065
I listen, I pay attention.
I'm a good bingo player.

348
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,101
A minute later Ruth wins.

349
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:46,046
Lenore came over,

350
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,072
and she gives the dollar
to her friend.

351
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:50,107
And don't tell me,
after that game

352
00:15:50,152 --> 00:15:53,610
her friend Ruthie
wasn't giving her 50¢, all right?

353
00:15:53,655 --> 00:15:56,021
I won that game, fair and square.
Fair and square.

354
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:58,526
Okay, so Larry, you think
Lenore is taking kick-back

355
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,858
- from calling the numbers?
- Yes, I do.

356
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,887
I think the bingo game
is fixed.

357
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:06,298
I think Lenore is
either in cahoots with Ruth

358
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,734
or maybe even a few other people.
I don't even know.

359
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,761
You know
what you should do?

360
00:16:10,806 --> 00:16:13,331
Take off your
little smock here,

361
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,502
take off your tie,
sit in on a game,

362
00:16:15,544 --> 00:16:18,377
keep your ears open.
Keep your ears open. Listen,

363
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:20,381
to see who's winning
at the bingo game.

364
00:16:20,415 --> 00:16:23,816
You want me to go undercover to play
bingo? Is that what you're saying?

365
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:26,412
Do you know anything
about this game, doctor,

366
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:28,447
that you're not telling me?

367
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:31,085
I know the bingo is
for the residents, Larry.

368
00:16:31,127 --> 00:16:34,062
And I know it takes place
on Wednesdays and Fridays.

369
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:36,588
That's what I know,
and I know they enjoy it.

370
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:40,068
Well, in a week or two, you're gonna
come up to me and go,

371
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:42,469
"Larry, you know what?

372
00:16:42,505 --> 00:16:44,496
You were right
about that bingo game."

373
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,701
- I will check into it.
- Good, that's all I ask.

374
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:49,303
- I'll be happy to.
- That's all I ask. Just ask around.

375
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:51,472
Do a little check into it.
That's all I ask.

376
00:16:51,514 --> 00:16:53,641
- I'm not asking a lot.
- No, not at all.

377
00:16:53,683 --> 00:16:55,674
- Thank you. Okay.
- Okay, Larry.

378
00:16:55,718 --> 00:16:57,743
- You have a good day.
- You too.

379
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:03,355
- Hello.
- How are you?

380
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:05,383
I'm well.
I have a prescription.

381
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:07,362
Okay.

382
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:11,889
- Is this for you?
- No, it's for my father.

383
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:13,925
Father.
Blood thinner.

384
00:17:17,975 --> 00:17:20,239
You know, there's another
drug out on the market

385
00:17:20,277 --> 00:17:23,246
that I personally like
a lot better.

386
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,010
- Really?
- Yeah.

387
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:27,914
My patients are...

388
00:17:27,951 --> 00:17:29,942
they're a lot happier
with the other drug.

389
00:17:29,987 --> 00:17:32,080
Huh.

390
00:17:33,157 --> 00:17:35,148
If you like, I could
write it down for you.

391
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:41,788
But the doctor
prefers this one.

392
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:45,124
Yes,

393
00:17:45,169 --> 00:17:48,138
but I prefer
the other one.

394
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:51,130
But he likes this one.

395
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:54,767
But I like that one.

396
00:17:58,882 --> 00:18:01,180
Doctor...

397
00:18:01,218 --> 00:18:03,244
pharmacist.

398
00:18:04,289 --> 00:18:06,280
Doctor!

399
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:10,017
Pharmacist.

400
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:17,396
I'll go
with the pharmacist.

401
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:20,199
- I'm going with the pharmacist.
- Yes, sir.

402
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:23,139
I'm taking this to the doctor,
I'm getting a new prescription

403
00:18:23,174 --> 00:18:25,369
- and I'll be back, Mr. Pharmacist.
- I'm glad.

404
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,571
- I'm going with you.
- Thank you, sir.

405
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:36,745
- Hey.
- Hey Larry, how are you?

406
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:39,484
Any progress on, uh...

407
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,822
the bingo business?

408
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,851
- No, no word on the bingo.
- Nothin'?

409
00:18:43,895 --> 00:18:45,556
Nothin'.

410
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:47,565
Keep your eye
on this Ruth.

411
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,000
- Ruth?
- Yeah, Ruth.

412
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:52,765
She's bad news.
There's something about this woman

413
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:55,365
I don't trust. I don't know how she
got into this place.

414
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:57,773
Don't they have a screening process
of some kind?

415
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,439
Yes, Larry, we screen them to make sure
they're old and sick and need care.

416
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,381
Well, she's got some kind
of personality disorder I think.

417
00:19:04,416 --> 00:19:06,646
Well, she's on a lot
of medication.

418
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:08,414
You think that's
an excuse really?

419
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:12,015
That's like
the Twinkie defense.

420
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:14,048
I'll continue
to investigate, Larry.

421
00:19:14,093 --> 00:19:16,186
Okay.
Um, one other thing.

422
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,958
I just came
from the pharmacist.

423
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:22,024
He kinda wants to go a different way
with the medication.

424
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:24,092
Sorta disagreed with you.

425
00:19:24,136 --> 00:19:26,070
The pharmacist?

426
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:29,040
Yeah, he wrote out
a drug here.

427
00:19:29,074 --> 00:19:31,338
I don't know what it is,
but I need a prescription

428
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:33,868
from you for this.

429
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:36,849
You need a prescription
from me for something the pharmacist

430
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,943
- has suggested?
- He was quite passionate about it.

431
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:42,750
You know, he deals
with this stuff all the time.

432
00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:47,054
I'm a doctor, Larry.

433
00:19:47,093 --> 00:19:49,584
Well, he's a pharmacist.

434
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,995
Yes, and I'm a doctor.

435
00:19:52,032 --> 00:19:53,863
He's a pharmacist.

436
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,391
- Doctor.
- Pharmacist.

437
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:58,427
Doctor.

438
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:00,462
Pharmacist.

439
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:06,444
Fine, you go
with the pharmacist.

440
00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:08,947
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

441
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:10,313
You're welcome.
Have yourself a nice day.

442
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,715
Thank you!

443
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:18,187
Oh yes, fuck me!

444
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:20,215
I want your cock.

445
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:25,595
Oh, fuck me!
It feels so good, oh!

446
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:28,124
Yes, yes!

447
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:30,160
Oh, I want
your big cock!

448
00:20:30,204 --> 00:20:32,195
- Fuck me!
- Yes!

449
00:20:32,239 --> 00:20:34,332
Oh God, yes!
Oh!

450
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:37,173
Fuck me! Fuck me!

451
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:39,202
Yes!
Oh my God!

452
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,237
Yeah! Fuck yeah!

453
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,273
Whoo! Yeah!

454
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,623
Dad!
Dad, I'm coming in.

455
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:57,961
Shh shh.

456
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:04,227
You... I can hear it
in the lobby, this thing!

457
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:06,535
So what?
I can't hear, you know?

458
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:09,065
- It's too loud!
- It's very hard for me. I can't hear.

459
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,342
Please... oh, you turned it off.
Come on.

460
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:15,282
We can't watch porno together.
I don't think...

461
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,547
We don't have that kind
of relationship yet.

462
00:21:17,586 --> 00:21:19,884
- But you ruined it for me now.
- Sorry.

463
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:22,856
- All right.
- Hey, that bingo game...

464
00:21:22,891 --> 00:21:24,859
- Yeah.
- Something's fishy.

465
00:21:24,893 --> 00:21:27,123
What are you talking about?
About bingo?

466
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,494
You noticed anything strange
going on in that...

467
00:21:29,531 --> 00:21:31,158
like Ruthie,
does she win a lot?

468
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,667
Of course she wins a lot.
This woman is a winner.

469
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,693
She wins a lot?

470
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:37,932
Yes, of course she wins a lot.
She plays a lot...

471
00:21:37,973 --> 00:21:39,964
Come in.

472
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,999
Hello there, Nattie!

473
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:44,035
Hello, Ruthie.
Come on.

474
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,070
- Good afternoon.
- Yes, hello.

475
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:48,947
Come, sit down.
We'll sit, we'll talk a little bit.

476
00:21:48,984 --> 00:21:50,849
This is wonderful.

477
00:21:50,886 --> 00:21:52,877
So what are you
two guys talking about?

478
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:55,151
To tell you the truth,
he has some crazy...

479
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,589
Oh, you know Tanaka,

480
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,493
the Japanese guy,
his son tried to kill himself.

481
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:01,520
But he's home
from the hospital.

482
00:22:01,564 --> 00:22:03,225
- He didn't die.
- Oh yeah, good guy...

483
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:06,463
- No no, "die."
- Lie?

484
00:22:06,502 --> 00:22:08,936
No, "die."

485
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:11,565
Die, die, die!

486
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:28,018
You're back.

487
00:22:28,057 --> 00:22:30,855
- I am back, as promised.
- I'm glad.

488
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,797
I gotta tell you something.
The doctor was upset.

489
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,597
Doctors don't like
to have their authority questioned.

490
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:42,069
I told him I had to go
with the pharmacist, you know?

491
00:22:42,105 --> 00:22:44,972
We see a lot of drugs.
I think this is a good choice.

492
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,202
Is that your name?

493
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:51,237
Cofey?

494
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:53,181
Yeah.

495
00:22:53,217 --> 00:22:55,947
Have you ever been
to that Japanese restaurant

496
00:22:55,986 --> 00:22:58,682
- across the street?
- Oh yeah, eat there all the time.

497
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:03,918
So Cofey was there.

498
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:05,952
You could say that.

499
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:11,598
You know what, Cofey?

500
00:23:11,635 --> 00:23:14,968
I think I'll go
with the doctor.

501
00:23:22,846 --> 00:23:25,314
Are you gonna try
some of this eel?

502
00:23:25,349 --> 00:23:28,182
You know, if you wanna taste
my chicken teriyaki,

503
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:30,209
you don't have to go
through this charade

504
00:23:30,254 --> 00:23:33,348
of offering me the eel, whatever.
Just ask me.

505
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,825
I don't want your chicken teriyaki,
but thank you.

506
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,851
I know that you do.
Here, take a piece.

507
00:23:37,896 --> 00:23:40,262
Here, on me.

508
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:43,790
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
I was in the pharmacy...

509
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:46,804
Remember the other day
when we were in here and I saw

510
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:48,829
- "Cofey was here" on the table?
- Mmm-hmm.

511
00:23:48,873 --> 00:23:50,500
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

512
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:53,568
The pharmacist had a nametag
that said "Cofey."

513
00:23:53,611 --> 00:23:55,602
- Really?
- Yeah.

514
00:23:57,882 --> 00:24:01,340
What is this with the Blackberry every...
all the time now?

515
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:03,445
It's really
getting annoying.

516
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:05,353
I was listening.
I'm meeting Wanda...

517
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,551
All you do all day long
is this Blackberry thing.

518
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:10,493
She was gonna tell me
when her break was. I'm gonna visit her.

519
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:12,655
- You're supposed to be talking to me.
- L...

520
00:24:12,697 --> 00:24:15,063
- We're having lunch, you know.
- L... the coffee.

521
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,090
All right, I'm going
to the bathroom.

522
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:19,126
Okay.

523
00:24:20,438 --> 00:24:23,499
Chicken teriyaki boy!

524
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:25,533
Chicken! Chicken!

525
00:24:30,015 --> 00:24:31,846
Stop it!

526
00:24:31,884 --> 00:24:33,715
Yoshi! Yoshi!

527
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,845
- Chicken teriyaki boy!
- That's just great.

528
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:40,090
Cofey is here!

529
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,423
- Cofey is here!
- Cofey is here!

530
00:24:42,461 --> 00:24:44,452
- Cofey is here!
- Cofey!

531
00:24:44,496 --> 00:24:46,487
Cofey!

532
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:51,726
Hey!

533
00:24:53,372 --> 00:24:56,307
You told everyone in the restaurant
that Yoshi was a chicken.

534
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:59,140
I'm chicken teriyaki boy.

535
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:02,113
That's my nickname,
'cause I always order chicken teriyaki.

536
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:04,843
So whenever I go in, they go,
"Oh, chicken teriyaki boy!"

537
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:07,579
- And they call you that.
- Yes, that's my name.

538
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,953
- What's going on?
- What's my name in this place?

539
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,424
- Chicken teriyaki boy.
- I'm chicken teriyaki boy.

540
00:25:12,459 --> 00:25:14,791
- Nobody has that kind of nickname.
- And I kept up

541
00:25:14,828 --> 00:25:17,353
my end of the bargain so fork over
the money you owe me.

542
00:25:17,397 --> 00:25:19,661
- No, you have not.
- What? I apologized.

543
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:21,894
He said you were eating
something on the phone.

544
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:24,495
You're not allowed to eat pistachio nuts
when you apologize?

545
00:25:24,537 --> 00:25:26,801
By the way, were they
with shells or without?

546
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,205
They had shells.

547
00:25:28,241 --> 00:25:31,108
- Okay, so you had to de-shell.
- So you're not paying up?

548
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:33,476
You have not apologized
to Yoshi properly.

549
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:37,108
It's better not to eat
when you apologize.

550
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,278
I'll tell you what.
Let's go double or nothing. Bingo.

551
00:25:42,622 --> 00:25:44,590
You wanna take me on
in bingo?

552
00:25:44,624 --> 00:25:47,149
- Tomorrow, the nursing home, 2:00.
- 2:00.

553
00:25:47,193 --> 00:25:50,162
- Yeah, bingo, that's right.
- Tomorrow. Double or nothing.

554
00:25:50,196 --> 00:25:53,097
Which way you wanna lose?
Horizontal, vertical or diagonal?

555
00:25:53,133 --> 00:25:55,795
- You have no idea. Don't be late.
- Don't worry, I won't.

556
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,827
We'll see.

557
00:25:57,872 --> 00:25:59,863
Oh no!

558
00:25:59,907 --> 00:26:01,898
Suicide Blackberry.

559
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:06,546
- Bingo!
- Oh, all right, Alice.

560
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,639
I'll be right there
to check you out.

561
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:18,891
- Shove over.
- Jeez, you shouldn't be here.

562
00:26:18,926 --> 00:26:20,553
- What?
- You shouldn't be here.

563
00:26:20,594 --> 00:26:23,461
- Hand me one of your cards.
- All right, take it.

564
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:25,488
- You're late.
- I'm here.

565
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,524
- You're late.
- Yeah.

566
00:26:27,568 --> 00:26:30,594
All right, everybody.
Are we ready to start another game?

567
00:26:30,638 --> 00:26:33,334
Nobody beats me at bingo. Nobody!

568
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,365
Really? I haven't read
about that.

569
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:37,400
Shh.

570
00:26:37,445 --> 00:26:39,936
B-4.

571
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,971
- "B" what?
- B-4. Oh, good start!

572
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:43,746
- B-4.
- Four.

573
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:46,811
I don't have four.
Wait I have...

574
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,846
B-11.

575
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,653
B-11.

576
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,683
11. 11.

577
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,160
Ahem.

578
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,611
O-69.

579
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:12,613
- O-69.
- Okay.

580
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:20,110
O-62.

581
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,548
Bingo!

582
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,551
Bingo!

583
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,257
Bingo!

584
00:27:29,297 --> 00:27:31,323
Bingo!

585
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:34,536
That's him.

586
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,006
He's the one that tried
to kill Ruthie.

587
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,871
Huh?

588
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:44,941
- Yes.
- What? What?

589
00:27:44,981 --> 00:27:47,575
Hey hey hey hey, wait wait wait,
calm down here.

590
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:52,712
No, that's ridiculous.
I didn't try to kill her.

591
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,746
Hey, seriously,
come on.

592
00:27:54,791 --> 00:27:56,554
Why would I do that?

593
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,561
Oh, I know what you mean.
No, 'cause I was talking to my father...

594
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,893
he's a little deaf,
so I have to scream.

595
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,899
I was saying,
"Die, die."

596
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,800
Kev, come on,
back me up here.

597
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:08,929
Kev! Help me out!

598
00:28:08,971 --> 00:28:11,064
Tell them!
Kev?

599
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:13,007
Wait a second.

600
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:15,203
Sorry about the bingo game.

601
00:28:15,244 --> 00:28:18,681
I really did win!
I have bingo!

602
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,442
I have money!
Here!

603
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:24,215
Here, take it.
Take it all.

604
00:28:24,254 --> 00:28:26,916
Take it, take it, take...

605
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,896
Banzai!
