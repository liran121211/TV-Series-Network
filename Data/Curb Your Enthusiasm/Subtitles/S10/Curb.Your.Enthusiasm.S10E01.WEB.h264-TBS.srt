(theme music playing)

2
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:10,469
Let me ask you something.
You happy with your color?

3
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,971
Fuckin' love my color.
Fuckin' mahogany.

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:14,640
‐Yeah. You're mahogany.
‐Yeah.

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:15,766
Hell, yeah.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,684
‐You happy
with your color?
‐No.

7
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,229
‐Huh? No?
‐Ah, well, what is it?
What is it?

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,189
You're like
a... a porridge,

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,816
a cream of wheat,
a farina, that kind of shit.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,818
‐That's what white
people's skin tone is.
‐Right.

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:28,987
‐It's just different
kinds of hot cereal.
‐Right, right.

12
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,281
Black people,
your skin tone's like,

13
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:33,408
it depends on
the amount of milk
you put in the coffee.

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,577
Fuckin' right.
I'm like
a fuckin' Yoo‐hoo.

15
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,455
‐I shake that motherfucker up.
I'm shakin' it up.
‐Yoo‐hoo's a good color.

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,457
‐Fuckin' good color. Shit.
‐Yeah, Yoo‐hoo's
a really good color.

17
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,501
‐Yeah.

00:00:43,919 --> 00:00:45,337

♪

23
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,763
Hey. Larry.

24
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,890
‐Randi. Yeah.
‐You got it.

25
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,935
‐I'm a friend of Susie's.
‐I know, I know, I know.
Yeah.

26
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,228
Happy New Year.

27
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,312
Eh.

28
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,689
It's a little late, frankly,

29
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,190
for the "Happy New Years,"
you know?

30
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:07,484
Why? It just happened
a couple of weeks ago, right?

31
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,402
Yeah, that's too long.

32
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,195
The statute of limitations

33
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,072
has kind of run out
on the "New Years."

34
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,533
‐Three days. Plenty.
‐Three days?

35
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:16,868
By the way,
everything doesn't
have to be happy.

36
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,537
Why does everything
have to be happy?

37
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,290
‐I'm having a pretty good day.
‐Yeah. Look at you.

38
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,375
‐That's, that's huge.
‐Yeah, I'm about eight months.

39
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,628
If you need some name tips,
I'm your guy.

40
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,422
‐Yeah.
‐What would you suggest?

41
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,591
Maybe something, uh,
Swedish, perhaps?

42
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,759
Yeah, I'm... my husband
is African‐American,

43
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,470
so I'm not sure that would,
I don't know, gel.

44
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,973
You like saying that,
don't you.

45
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,892
‐Do I like saying that
he's African‐American?
‐Yeah.

46
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:42,477
I think you wanted me to know.

47
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:44,229
Does it change your
opinion of me?

48
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,065
In some ways, yes.
In some ways, no.

49
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:48,442
‐Okay.
‐All right.

50
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,694
Enjoy your workout.

What are you doing?

54
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:07,419
What?

55
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,713
What's with the‐‐
What's with the jogging?

56
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,132
I'm... I'm working out.

57
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,176
‐Working out?
‐Yeah.

58
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,887
You, you're jostling
the fetus.

59
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,765
You can't‐‐
You can't run
in your condition.

60
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,642
Uh, yes, I can.

61
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,976
I was advised by my midwife

62
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,603
that I should continue
to work out.

63
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,438
Maybe you want to
consult your blacksmith.

64
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,981
See what he has
to say about it.

65
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:31,401
Oh, I don't, uh, want
to get into it with you,
but, um...

66
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,945
my fetus, my problem, okay?

67
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:37,074
‐I pity that fetus.

Larry:
Oh, my God.
I can't watch this.

69
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,164
‐Happy New Year.
‐Yeah, Happy New Year.

70
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,670

71
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,512
‐(slapping)
‐Hey, hey, hey. Come on.
Come on, man.

72
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,765
‐You gotta stay dry.
‐You're over‐talcing here.

73
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,600
‐Ugh!
‐Happy New Year.

74
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:04,810
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,686
‐I couldn't even
breathe in there.
‐Right.

76
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,689
He was putting talc
under his arm,

77
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,484
‐on his balls...
It was disgusting.
‐(laughing)

78
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,445
‐I mean, who still uses that?
‐I use that shit all the time.

79
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,157
‐Can't be good for you.
‐Not if you're allergic to it.

80
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,909
My Auntie Rey
put some of that shit on her,

81
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,494
and went into
anaphylactic shock.

82
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,913
‐Really?
‐Yeah. Started shakin' and shit.
Took her to the ER.

83
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,791
‐Man, they had to pump
her stomach for nothing.
‐That's incredible.

84
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,251
Yeah, man.

85
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,753
‐Look at this guy
in the MAGA hat.
‐Boy. You don't see...

86
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:35,006
‐You don't see many of those
in LA, do you?
‐You fuckin' don't.

87
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,176
Know what I noticed?
No one ever wears
those hats on backwards.

88
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,595
If mean, if you're gonna
get your ass kicked,
you want to see it coming.

89
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,097
‐(chuckles)
‐I like that.

90
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,100
‐Yeah.
‐Mocha‐‐ Mocha Joe's

91
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,768
Mocha Joe.
I know a Mocha Joe.

92
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,729
‐You want some coffee?
‐Sure. Okay.

93
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,397
‐Let's go in here.
‐Get a little latte.

94
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,274
‐Thank you so much.
I appreciate it.
‐Thank you.

95
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,525
Have a great day.

96
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,862
‐Whoa! Blast from the past.
‐Oh, boy, oh, boy.

97
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,613
‐Larry David. Wow.
‐Mocha Joe!

98
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,991
‐Long time, no see, man.
What are you doin' here?
‐Hey!

99
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,284
‐What's your name?
‐Leon.

100
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,202
‐Leon. Nice to meet you.
‐This is unreal.

101
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,079
Do you believe it? Huh?
What can I get you guys?

102
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,622
I'll get a‐‐
Do you have scones?

103
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,082
Yeah. Right there.
They're beautiful.

104
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,001
Great. I'll have a scone,
and a, uh, cup of coffee.

105
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,628
‐Cup of coffee and a scone.
What about you, Leon?
‐Let me get a latte.

106
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,922
All right. One scone,
a coffee, a latte.

107
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,507
That's $11.50.

108
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,509
There you go.
Keep the change.

109
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,136
Oh, thanks for the tip.
Appreciate it.

110
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,098
Mocha Joe: A latte
and a coffee, please.
Thank you.

111
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,349
Mm.

112
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,518
It's a little soft.

113
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,437
What, the scone?

114
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,607
Yeah. Scones are
supposed to be hard.
This is like a muffin.

115
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,319
Well, not really.
It's supposed to be fresh.

116
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,862
Yeah, fresh hard.

117
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,739
Well, that's a fresh scone.

118
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,366
I'm not quite sure
you know what a scone is,
Mocha Joe.

119
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,243
‐Oh, I know what a scone is.
‐Larry: Do you?

120
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,205
‐Yeah.
‐You may have a looser
definition of scone than I do.

121
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,208
I don't think it's really
open to interpretation,
though.

122
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,960
You want the scone, or not?

123
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,837
Yeah, I'll keep
the scone‐slash‐muffin.

124
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,965
‐So you're gonna
keep the scone?
‐Yeah. Muffin. Yeah.

125
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,425
Enjoy the scone, Larry.

126
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,303
‐Hey, you got any Danishes?
‐Uh, no.

127
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,722
You're fuckin' up.

128
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:07,808
Mocha Joe:
(sighs) Next.

‐Oh, my God.
‐(table squeaking)

131
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:15,023
‐Look at this table.
Do you believe it?
‐Wow.

132
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,026
‐Wow.
‐Hey, uh, hey, Mocha Joe.

133
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,444
Mocha Joe:
Yeah?

134
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,113
‐Check out this table.
‐Yeah?

135
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,449
(chuckles) It's a wobb‐‐
You got a wobbly table, here.

136
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,867
Yeah, well,
stop moving it.

137
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,995
Stop moving it? It's‐‐
Every time I, I, I lean on it,

138
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,789
‐it's gonna move.
‐Put your foot on it,
like everybody else does.

139
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,666
I'm gonna sit with
my foot on the table?

140
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,668
Yeah, that's how
you hold it down.
The floors are wobbly.

141
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,379
‐Mocha Joe, can I give
you a little advice?
‐Yeah.

142
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,589
Nobody likes a wobbly table.

143
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,425
Fastest way to lose customers
is wobbly tables.

144
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,302
I got an uncle
with a wobbly leg.

145
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,263
I can't stand that motherfucker.

146
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,265
Leaning on shit all the time.

147
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,142
‐Hmm.
‐Barista:
Two medium cappuccinos.

148

(gulps) Aah.
(scoffs)

149
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,273
Larry:
Taste your coffee.

150
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,024
‐Cold.
‐It's cold.

151
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,067
Hey, man.

152
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,485
‐Yeah.
‐Larry: Hey, Mocha Joe.

153
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,571
‐What?
‐(laughs softly)

154
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,823
This is cold coffee.

155
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,533
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.

156
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,660
That coffee is not cold.

157
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,328
‐Is your coffee cold?
‐Your coffee's hot, right?

158
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,163
Look, we don't wanna be
fuckin' haters right now,

159
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,415
but this shit is cold.

160
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,125
Can, can I get a n‐‐

161
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,960
‐Can I get a new cup?
‐No.

162
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,253
‐So you're not gonna
give me a new cup.
‐No.

163
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,963
'Cause that's a hot cup
of coffee.

164
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,840
‐It was hot when
I gave it to you‐‐
‐That's a hot cup of coffee?

165

00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,798
Because I want Ted to see it
before he leaves.

327
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,675
‐Of course.
‐Thank you.

328
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,969
Ted.

329
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:42,804
‐(all laughing)
‐I'd like to thank
Jeff and Susie

330
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,890
‐for inviting us into
their beautiful home.
‐I like the other one.

331
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:47,767
(crowd laughing)

332
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,852
Well, I think the house
is very nice.

333
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:52,438
‐(laughs)
‐(crowd laughing)

334
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,692
Did they throw that
fish smell in for free?

335
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,861
(laughing)

336
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:02,615
And, and, and look at all
our other friends who are
kind enough to join us.

337
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:06,619
‐There's, there's Ted Danson.
‐Wow, is he handsome!

338
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,246
He sure thinks so.

339
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,957
‐Oh!
‐(laughing)

340
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,918
And how about Susie,
our inimitable hostess?

341
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,754
‐(clapping)
‐Susie, I love the curtains,

342
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,840
but why did you make
a jacket out of it?

343
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,926
‐Crowd: Oh!
‐(raucous laughter)

344
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,762
‐Are you having a good time?
‐A good time?
Are you kidding me?

345
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:28,433
I'm with a bunch of stiffs,
the food sucks, the drinks
aren't strong enough,

346
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,600
and your hand is up my ass.

347
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:31,853
(laughing)

348
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,440
(laughing):
Hey. Don't look so down.

349
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,567
(laughing)

350
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,902
Are you mad?

351
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,488
‐Let's kiss and make up.
‐I'm...

352
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,743
‐I'm not gonna kiss a dummy.
‐I wouldn't. She's got a cold.

353
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,079
Aw. That's the end!

354
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,956
‐(applause, laughter)
‐Jeff: Bravo!

355
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,417
Bravo! Cheryl and Larry.

356
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,420
‐Cheryl and Larry.
‐(cheers, whistles)

357
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,714
What a great audience.
Thank you. Thank you.

358
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,176
‐Fantastic.
Thank you all for coming.
‐Susie: I love that bit.

359
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,511
‐Thanks for coming.
‐Susie: Always loved that bit.

360
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,306
‐You were very funny.
‐Thank you.

361
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,892
‐I'm sorry, but I gotta
catch my plane.
‐Okay.

362
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,478
Actually, you know what,
I better not.
I don't wanna catch a cold.

363
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,313
‐Cheryl: Oh, I know.
You gotta stay...
‐I'm sorry. Yeah.

364
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,398
‐I'll call you when I land.
‐...healthy. Okay.

365
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,900
You don't need to call her
when you land.

366
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,069
If there's a plane crash,
we'll know about it.

367
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,196
‐Okay. I'll walk you, Ted.
‐Thank you, guys.

368
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,531
‐Susie: Thank you for coming.
‐Ted: That was a great evening.

369
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,742
♪

370
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,502
Ah! There you are.
Finally gotcha.

371
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,420
Sir, I need you
to get out of here.

372
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,172
Get out of here?
What are you talking about?

373
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,008
I need you to leave this room
'cause you've been ogling me...

374
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,135
‐the entire night.
‐Ogling you? Are you nuts?

375
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,805
‐I, I, I've been ogling
the pigs in a blanket.
‐Am I‐‐

376
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,348
Oh, my God. Yeah.

377
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,267
‐Not the first time
this has happened.
‐What? I want one.

378
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,279
Wow.

379
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,866
‐Ah. Hey.
‐Hey. Excuse me.

380
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,868
‐Huh? Were we a hit?
‐We were a hit.

381
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,830
‐We were the highlight
of this party.
‐Highlight of the party.

382
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,791
Yeah, I mean,
it's a been a while,
but we've still got it.

383
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,210
‐What are‐‐
What are you doing?
‐I'm gonna go home.

384
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,212
‐I'm just getting an Uber.
‐Uber?

385
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,756
‐I'll take you home.
‐You don't have to do that.

386
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,216
Ah, it's nothing.

387
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,136
‐Okay. Okay.
Thank you. That's‐‐
‐Um, just give me...

388
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,595
Give me two minutes.

389
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,931
Okay. All right. Thanks.

390
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,267
Are you kidding?

391
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,311
I can't believe
I didn't get a chance
to talk to you all night,

392
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:38,938
and now I'm on my way out.

393
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,649
‐What a shame.
‐You giving me
The Big Goodbye?

394
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,943
‐The Big Goodbye? What are you‐‐
What are you talking about?
‐Big Goodbye.

395
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,487
Where you avoid me all night,
and then you think you can

396
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,823
cure it by having a Big Goodbye.
I know. I've been around.

397
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,701
‐I wasn't giving you a Big‐‐ I
never heard of the Big Goodbye.
‐It seems like a Big Goodbye.

398
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,786
No, it wasn't.
It was just a normal goodbye.

399
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,454
‐That's a normal goodbye.
‐Yeah?

400
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:56,706
‐Yeah.
‐Really?

401
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,915
Yeah. I wasn't trying
to avoid you.

402
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,500
Are you kidding?
Why would I avoid you?

403
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,127
Have lunch with me
Wednesday?

404
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,254
We have a lot to talk about.
Listen,

405
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,298
we're doing <i>Raymond</i>
in Portugal.

406
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,800
Yeah.
<i>Everybody Loves Joam.</i>

407
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,927
It's fantastic.
I get to go.

408
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,804
And then I have the whole
<i>Somebody Feed Phil</i> show.

409
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,640
I want you to do my show.
I want to go to Ethiopia
with you.

410
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,767
‐(chuckles) Ethiopia.
‐Ethiopia's great.

411
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,436
I don't think I'm
running off to Ethiopia‐‐

412
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,937
Sure, you eat with your hands.
It's fantastic.

413
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,439
‐Everybody shares,
and, and the thing‐‐
‐I... I...

414
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,232
‐I don't like to leave
the continent, you know.
‐No?

415
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,609
‐Nah.
‐All right.
You know what?

416
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,444
We'll start lunch Wednesday.
We'll see where it goes.

417
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,905
Say yes to me
and you can go.

418
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,365
‐Okay.
‐Okay.

419
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,867
Larry: You know,
did I ever tell you

420
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,369
that I once did a, uh,
premature Big Goodbye?

421
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,622
So what does that mean?
You said goodbye and then
you didn't leave?

422
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,874
‐I did a Big Goodbye
and then I didn't‐‐
‐Come on.

423
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,793
‐And I didn't leave.
‐And what did they do?
They were mad?

424
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,630
‐I ran into her in the kitchen
about an hour later.
‐Come on.

425
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,424
And what do you say?
What do you even say?

426
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,635
She said,
"I thought you left."
I said, "Well, you know.

427
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,596
I got, uh...
something happened."
I don't know.

428
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,264
I made up a story.

429
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,934
I, but I,
I can't believe that...

430
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,477
that he knew about
the Big Goodbye.

431
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,229
‐(laughing)
‐That was unbelievable to me.

432
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:04,106
Well, I can't believe
that you kissed me when
you knew I had a cold.

433
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,816
That was pretty unbelievable.

434
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,069
Yeah. You...

435
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,239
I would do it again.

436
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,291
(sighs)

437
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,052
Cheryl:
Wow, Larry.

438
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,096
What are we doing?

439
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,015
By the way,
before we get into that,

440
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,184
are you aware that you have
a wobbly table here?

441
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:43,521
Look at this.
Look at this table.
It's unbelievable.

442
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,774
‐I, I don't know how you
can go to bed at night.
‐Yeah, it doesn't bother me.

443
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,734
If all tables in
your house wobbled,

444
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,945
you could live like that?
You could in a wobble‐house?

445
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:55,116
We need to talk about Ted.
We need to talk about everything
that just happened here.

446
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,034
‐What?
‐What?

447
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,161
‐What are you so...
‐Oh...

448
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,746
I'm, I'm your ex‐husband.

449
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,999
Ted is such a good person.

450
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,459
No, he's not such
a good person, okay?

451
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,170
You don't do that.
You don't date
a friend's ex‐wife.

452
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,047
I mean, it's crazy.

453
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,092
‐You know what it is?
‐Now... what?

454
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,887
I think when I'm with you,
it makes me feel...

455
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,890
‐...better about myself?
‐Morally superior.

456
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:21,309
‐Yes.
‐Yes.

457
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:23,060
‐I hear that a lot. Yeah.
‐Yeah. So, I'm not perfect,

458
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,730
‐but at least
I'm better than you.
‐You're better than me.

459
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,148
I can relate to
what you're saying,

460
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,317
'cause I don't, I don't
feel that way with people.

461
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,653
‐I feel morally
inferior to people.
‐Yeah.

462
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,906
But I feel that way
with animals 'cause
they're generally so stupid,

463
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,826
and I can‐‐
especially insects,
I can crush them.

464
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,078
You know, and, and
they eat each other.

465
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,623
I mean, they're crazy,
animals. So, yeah.

466
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,083
I feel smarter
and morally superior to them.

467
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,752
(both laugh)

468
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:51,339
‐Hey. Uh... Let me
ask you something.
‐Yeah?

469
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,508
Is there any chance that...

470
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,054
we might meet up again?

471
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,556
We'll see.

472
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,891
We'll see.

473
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,186
‐You can't stay here.
‐I'm gonna tell you something,
okay?

474
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,271
‐If we ever got
back together...
‐Yeah.

475
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,775
...and somehow this table
appeared on, on our bedside...

476
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,778
‐Yeah?
‐...it would be fixed
immediately.

477
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,738
‐Immediately.
‐Oh, my God.

478
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,658
‐Larry: <i>I could not live</i>
<i>with a wobbly table.</i>
‐Cheryl: <i>Larry, please.</i>

479
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,201
<i>‐Go.</i>
‐Larry: <i>Okay.</i>

480
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,998
Ha‐ha!

481
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,625
‐What?
‐Where the fuck you been at?

482
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,460
‐What are you? My mother?
‐Fuck yeah, I am.

483
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,629
All right,
I was at a party, okay?
I was at Jeff's party.

484
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,464
‐That party was over
a long time ago.
‐Huh?

485
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,634
Yeah. This right here‐‐
This right here?
It's called tappin' hours.

486
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,678
This is the hours when
people are tappin' ass.

487
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,554
I'm not tappin'.
I'm not tappin'.

488
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:42,431
Older white men should not
be out this fuckin' late.

489
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,559
There's no late‐night
yacht club,
or late‐night garage sales

490
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,395
and shit like that.
You out here fuckin'.

491
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,979
When I'm tappin',
I always tell you.

492
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,690
I come home and spread
the fuckin' news.

493
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,358
You wanna know who I'm tappin'?
You wanna know who I'm tappin'?

494
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,527
‐Who the fuck you tappin'?
‐(slams)

495
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,238
Larry: <i>I can't get out of it.</i>
<i>It's Phil Rosenthal.</i>
<i>He's just‐‐</i>

496
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,989
What do you do?
How many times
can you say no?

497
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:00,991
You couldn't do
the Big Goodbye?

498
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,202
I did the Big Goodbye.
He saw right through it.

499
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,745
Ah! You know what I'll do?

500
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,330
I'll call you
in the middle of lunch.

501
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,416
Say it's an emergency
and you gotta go.

502
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,334
I did that the last time
I had lunch with him.

503
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:12,420
Oh, boy.
That guy's relentless.

504
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:15,548
Hey, Lar, that was
some party last night, huh?

505
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,050
‐Yeah, it was a great party.
‐You had a good time?

506
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,719
‐I did. I had a nice time.
‐Yeah.

507
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,263
So you drove Cheryl home?

508
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,223
Yep.

509
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,725
That was very nice of you.

510
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,977
‐Considering Ted's
out of town‐‐
‐Yeah. I'm a nice guy.

511
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,520
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah. I'm a nice guy.

512
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,605
So, what, did you just
drop her off, or‐‐

513
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,858
‐Yeah. Pretty much.
‐Hmm.

514
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:37,695
Dropped her off.
Said good night.
Went on my merry way.

515
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,321
Mm‐hmm.

516
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,951
‐Is there something
you would like to know, or‐‐
‐No, no, no.

517
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,953
Something you're
not saying? Um...

518
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,788
You know, can I person
not just ask

519
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:50,541
‐a, a normal question?
‐No, they're not
normal questions.

520
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,335
‐There's a lot of implications.
A lot of implications.
‐Larry: You're fishing‐‐

521
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,087
You're on a little
fishing expedition.

522
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:56,714
You know,
you two are something.

523
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,048
‐You two make crap up‐‐
‐We're something?

524
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,550
You know what?
You're something.

525
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,552
Don't eat all the leftovers.
We need them for dinner.

526
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,804
‐Jeff: Sure, I won't.
‐You're something.

527
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,224
‐I'll eat whatever
the fuck I want.
‐That's right.

528
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,893
Hey. Did you sleep with Cheryl?

529
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,519
‐Yeah.
‐You did?

530
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,230
‐Yeah. Listen.
(chuckles)
‐Ah.

531
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,733
You cannot say anything
to Susie. Cannot.

532
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,735
Under any circumstances.
Cheryl swore me to secrecy.

533
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:18,986
She didn't want me to tell you.

534
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,905
But I had to.
I couldn't‐‐
How could I not?

535
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,907
I'm a human being,
for God's sake.

536
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,450
‐I think it's great.
‐Right?

537
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,911
Yes. Wha‐‐
What are you hoping
to get out of it, though?

538
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,538
I'm hoping to get
back together, but...

539
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,458
‐I'll be surprised
if I see her again.
‐Hmm.

540
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,627
We on for golf on Saturday?

541
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,253
Yeah. Um...

542
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,088
Arnie Norton asked
if he could play.

543
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,217
(scoffs)
I'm not playing with him.
He's a Trump supporter.

544
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,552
‐Never play with
a Trump supporter.
‐Really?

545
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,346
See him around town
with that hat.

546
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,014
"Make America Great Again."

547
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,058
I don't need that crap.

548
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:53,062
He just‐‐
He makes me want to
not be anywhere near him.

549
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,441
I don't know.
You can check with Carl.
See if he wants to play.

550
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:58,734
I gotta go.

551
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,947
(Phil whistling)

552
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,949
‐Phil: Oh, hello, there.
‐Hostess: Hi.

553
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,368
Hi. I'm Phil Rosenthal.
I have a twelve o'clock.

554
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,328
Oh, yes.
Mr. David's already here.

555
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,747
‐He is? Wow.
‐Yes. Right this way.

556
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,333
‐Very impressive.
‐He was early.

557
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,213
Enjoy.

558
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,590
Larry:
Hey, Phil!

559
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,719
Good to see you.
Sit. Sit down. Sit down.

560
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:29,765
Boy, I'm so glad we did this.
It was such a good idea.

561
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,141
You, you were definitely right.

562
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,977
I'm, I'm starving.
I hope this place is good.

563
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,812
Yeah, yeah, it's great.
It's big portions

564
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,981
on the food and everything.
It's really...

565
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,066
a fantastic place. Um...

566
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,360
You know what else?
I've been thinking...

567
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,946
Really thinking about
this Ethiopia thing.

568
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,198
Yeah, actually,
I heard that
we have some budget cuts,

569
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,994
and Ethiopia's a little...
ex‐expensive to shoot in.

570
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,704
Wasn't that one of
the shithole countries?

571
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,914
I can't remember if
that was on the list or not.

572
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,792
‐Oh, look. I'm getting a thing.
‐Larry: Oh!

573
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,628
Oh, yeah.
Oh, look at that.
Um, uh...

574
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,172
My son's flight, uh,
got in early.

575
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,675
‐And I gotta get him.
I gotta go get him.
‐Oh! Really?

576
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,970
‐Yeah, no, really.
‐Let's... Send, send
an Uber or something.

577
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,598
He needs to see me
because he has a little anxiety.

578
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:12,349
No, no! You know what?
Phil...

579
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,227
No, no.
We'll, we'll, we'll...
We'll... something.

580
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,648
Ah!

581
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,567
Fill her up.

582
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,361
‐Ah! <i>Arigato!</i>
‐Yes.

583
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:27,907
<i>‐Arigato!</i>
‐All right. Two seats
at the sushi bar.

584
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,917
You know what?
Actually, I think we'd prefer
to sit at a table, please.

585
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,668
Larry:
Huh.

586
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,796
Sad.

587
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,924
Very sad. Sad.

You little fucker!
‐Oh, God. Oh, God.

00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,066
‐I'm sorry, I didn't see you.
‐What the fuck?

00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,693
‐I'm sorry, I didn't see you!
‐I'm ought to rip you

‐You little shit.
‐I'm sorry.
I didn't see you.

Oh. Just be more careful
next time, okay?

598
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,410
Will do. Will do.
Okay. Thank you.

Sitting here drinking coffee?

That's a boy‐‐
That's quite a boycott.

I told you,
for the rest of

I don't need you

‐Susie's friend. I saw her
in the gym the other day.

631
00:25:40,748 --> 00:25:43,083
She's eight months pregnant.
She was running on a treadmill.

632
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,836
She has no regard
for this fetus.

633

Now she's drinking coffee.

634

is unbelievable.
It's fantastic.

hot coffee, okay?

If that was hot coffee,
I, I would have burned my nose.

I didn't want a nose test!

Susie:
Randi had contractions,
and...

814
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:18,682
She's walking around the halls
trying to induce,

815
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,518
'cause nothing's happening,
so I thought I'd come
and keep her company.

816
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,312
‐Randi's here?
‐Yeah. Cheryl, what happened?

817
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,440
‐She got stung by a wasp.
‐I had an allergic reaction
to shellfish.

818
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:29,859
Okay.

819
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:33,321
I knew it.
I knew something was
going on with you two.

820
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:34,698
I could smell it.

821
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,866
That night at our house.
The ventriloquist.

822
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,036
He drove you home.
Something's been going on here.

823

You better leave, Larry.

How does he‐‐
How does he know
you're in the hospital?

832
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,723
Because he just flew in
from San Francisco

833
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,141
and he texted me
when he landed. I...

834

it's gonna be your fault.

It's a coffee place.

I'm opening up a spite store

If you're gonna
