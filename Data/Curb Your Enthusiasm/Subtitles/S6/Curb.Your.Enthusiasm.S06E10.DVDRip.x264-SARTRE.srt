1
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:16,422
Somebody need to talk to the man,
you know what I mean?

2
00:00:16,464 --> 00:00:19,692
I'm so happy you called me.
He's just moping around?

3
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:21,424
I mean, we all are really worried
about him, man.

4
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:23,759
This Cheryl thing's
got him crazy.

5
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:25,854
This Cheryl thing's got him twisted, man,
for real.

6
00:00:25,897 --> 00:00:28,760
He's up there moping, man.
Mopy Dick, that's what he is.

7
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:30,786
- Moby Dick.
- No, Mopy Dick.

8
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,522
- No, it's called Moby Dick.
- Who's fucking Moby Dick?

9
00:00:33,562 --> 00:00:35,652
"Moby Dick" is the book
by Melville.

10
00:00:35,695 --> 00:00:37,457
- Who's fucking Moby Dick?
- Where did you hear Moby Dick from?

11
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,826
Mopy Dick, man.
His dick is moping.

12
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:41,090
- Oh, literally Mopy Dick?
- Yeah, Mopy Dick.

13
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:44,094
Okay, let's go up and get his
mopy-ass dick out of bed.

14
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,095
- Let's go.
- I like the way you operate, man.

15
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:49,151
You know what I mean?
You're straightforward. I like that shit.

16
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:52,287
What?

17
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,520
- Gotta come in?
- Coming in, man.

18
00:00:56,627 --> 00:00:58,718
- Hey, what's going on?
- I don't know.

19
00:00:58,761 --> 00:01:01,352
- I fucked up my life.
- How did you fuck up your life?

20
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,120
- What did you do?
- With Cheryl.

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,126
- Oh, Cheryl.
- Oh, man, this Cheryl shit again.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,352
Come on, man.

23
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:10,553
The stupid call from the plane-
I didn't...

24
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:12,149
You were busy
with the TiVo guy.

25
00:01:12,191 --> 00:01:15,351
Busy with the TiVo guy.
Yeah, I was busy with the TiVo guy.

26
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:17,381
Your brain is all fucking
discombobulated, man.

27
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:18,914
You need to focus
on some ass.

28
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:22,584
I'm just never gonna meet
anybody like her again, ever ever.

29
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,419
I'm not disputing that,
but you've got to meet somebody else.

30
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:28,150
- You've got to move on.
- There's nobody that compares to her.

31
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,053
I can't even imagine
being with anybody else.

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,351
Listen, man, you've got
to get out there and do stuff.

33
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,652
Get down there and get breakfast.
What are you doing?

34
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,155
Is she going
to Sammie's bat mitzvah?

35
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:38,655
Yeah, she's coming
to the bat mitzvah.

36
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:40,655
She's bringing
that guy too.

37
00:01:42,523 --> 00:01:45,613
What do you want me to do?
We didn't pick sides.

38
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:48,019
I can't believe I've got to see her
with this guy

39
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:50,146
- at Sammie's bat mitzvah.
- Well, who are you gonna bring?

40
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:51,983
- Nobody.
- You've got to bring somebody.

41
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:54,420
Bring somebody?
Who am I gonna bring?

42
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,886
You're not gonna find her here,
lying like this. Come on.

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,613
Yeah, you gotta
find somebody, man.

44
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:00,882
- I'm not a good dater. I can't date.
- Why can't you date?

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,477
You're not comfortable
in your Larry shell right now.

46
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,748
You've got to become
another motherfucker right now.

47
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:07,911
Larry, grow a mustache, man.
Grow a goatee,

48
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:10,578
a mustache, grow sideburns.
Become another motherfucker, man.

49
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,983
- You feel me?
- It's not bad advice.

50
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,076
It's not bad advice.
But anything to get your ass out of bed.

51
00:02:16,119 --> 00:02:18,086
Get your ass out of-
wh-?

52
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:19,607
- What was that?
- What are you doing?

53
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,516
You've got bedbugs?
What's going on?

54
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:23,676
Oh, nothing. Just a little
uncomfortable.

55
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:26,979
- Listen, I did my part. Get your ass up.
- Okay, thanks.

56
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:28,916
- I've got to go to work, all right?
- Thanks, yeah.

57
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:31,109
- I'll see you later.
- Good work, man.

58
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,310
Hey, I'll get him up.
Hey, man, let's roll, L.D.

59
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,714
Come on downstairs, man. The family
wants to talk to you a little bit.

60
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:40,511
- All right, I'm turning over a new leaf.
- Yeah, come on downstairs.

61
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,674
- That's it. No more of this shit.
- We want to talk to you.

62
00:02:42,716 --> 00:02:44,978
- Okay, no more.
- Yeah, get out. Let's get your shit together.

63
00:02:45,017 --> 00:02:46,948
- I'm getting it together.
- Yeah, think about that beard shit.

64
00:02:46,982 --> 00:02:48,448
- Okay, all right.
- Think about that mustache.

65
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:52,715
Look who I found.

66
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:54,578
- Hey.
- Hey, L.D.!

67
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:56,308
- How are you doing?
- Yeah.

68
00:02:56,348 --> 00:02:58,745
- Eh, I think okay. I think I'll be all right.
- Good.

69
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:00,179
- I'm fine.
- Good.

70
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,839
You know what?
My mind is made up.

71
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,608
- I am forgetting about her as of now.
- Okay.

72
00:03:04,648 --> 00:03:06,977
- That's what I'm talking about.
- As of now.

73
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:09,639
- L.D., you're gonna be fine, trust me.
- It's a new day.

74
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,646
He'll be
the last man standing.

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,202
So what's going on?
What do you want to talk to me about?

76
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:15,576
Loretta,
you want to...?

77
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,908
Um, our house
is ready

78
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:20,776
and we're gonna
go home.

79
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:24,640
Yeah yeah.
The lady called today.

80
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:26,576
- We're out for real.
- We are.

81
00:03:26,611 --> 00:03:28,601
- We're not kidding you. We're out.
- No, for real.

82
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,338
- He's speechless. I can't believe it.
- Well...

83
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,640
I am speechless.

84
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:34,541
- You too?
- I'm out of here too.

85
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:37,134
I've got a little boo down there
I'ma holla at.

86
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:40,041
I know it looked like we weren't gonna ever
get out of here, though,

87
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:42,269
- but...
- Well...

88
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,242
- you gotta go- you gotta go.
- Yeah.

89
00:03:44,276 --> 00:03:45,707
- We're gonna miss you, though.
- We are.

90
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:47,437
You can always
come visit now.

91
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,908
Eh, let's not go crazy.

92
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:52,034
- My gerbil's gone.
- What?

93
00:03:52,076 --> 00:03:55,098
- My gerbil's gone.
- What do you mean your gerbil's gone?

94
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:57,300
Well, come on.
Let's go find it.

95
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,240
- Chill out. We're cool.
- Chill out?

96
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:02,399
There's a gerbil running amok in
my house. Come on, help me find it.

97
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,307
Okay, thank you.

98
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:09,067
- Hey, Larry.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,733
- The building manager just called.
- Yeah?

100
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:14,535
In the next few days
somebody's gonna come

101
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:16,539
and look at that office
across from you.

102
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:18,835
- Are you kidding?
- No.

103
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:21,895
Oh, I dreaded this day.
I don't want anybody

104
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:23,530
moving in
across the hall.

105
00:04:23,573 --> 00:04:25,765
You know, we have
privacy here.

106
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,601
I know. Larry,
there's nothing I can do.

107
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,764
We're not gonna have
control of the thermostat.

108
00:04:29,805 --> 00:04:31,771
- That's right, it's in there.
- Yeah, it's in there.

109
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,236
Why don't we
take that office then?

110
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,703
I'm not gonna pay for an office
I'm not using.

111
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:38,204
Well, somebody's gonna take it
if you don't take it.

112
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,634
How do you stop somebody
from renting it?

113
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,728
That's what
I want to know.

114
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:45,600
How are you?

115
00:04:45,637 --> 00:04:48,125
- You know, I feel a little better today.
- Do you?

116
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:49,931
- I've been pretty depressed.
- You seem better. You look good.

117
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,197
Yeah, I feel better.
I'm feeling like I'm ready,

118
00:04:52,236 --> 00:04:54,464
but I hate being single.
I just hate it.

119
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,832
- I know, Larry. I'm sorry.
- I want to meet somebody.

120
00:04:56,869 --> 00:05:00,164
I swear to God, I can get married again
in a month if I could.

121
00:05:00,202 --> 00:05:03,691
Oh, Larry. Larry David,
you are a romantic.

122
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,633
Am I?
Do you think I am?

123
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:07,860
Oh, I forgot.
Matt Tessler called and said,

124
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,833
"Hey, I'm in the building.
I thought I'd drop by."

125
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:12,231
- He's in the building?
- Yeah.

126
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,199
He said he knows you,
"Seinfeld" days.

127
00:05:14,234 --> 00:05:16,495
Yeah, he directed
four "Seinfelds."

128
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:18,396
He was terrible, though.
He was a terrible director.

129
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,228
- Oh, I remember Matt.
- What does he want?

130
00:05:20,266 --> 00:05:23,527
Lewis is doing a pilot now, and I'll
bet he wants me to recommend him.

131
00:05:23,566 --> 00:05:26,555
- You know, he's got the son...
- Oh my gosh, that's right.

132
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,462
...who's got
the muscular issues.

133
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:29,760
M.S. or M.D. or...?

134
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:32,060
I don't know.
There's something.

135
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,689
I could say
that you had to leave,

136
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,698
- you had an important meeting.
- Eh...

137
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:39,187
- Larry David. Larry David, how ya doing?
- Hey, Matt Tessler!

138
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:41,856
- We were just talking about you.
- Good to see you.

139
00:05:41,897 --> 00:05:44,727
Hey, Matt, what's going on?
Nice to see you. How are you?

140
00:05:44,764 --> 00:05:46,753
- You're well? You look good.
- Yeah.

141
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:49,092
- You look pretty good yourself.
- Oh, thanks, thanks.

142
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,357
- Yeah, I'm doing okay, doing okay.
- Look at this.

143
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:53,158
- Working my ass off, yeah.
- Nice.

144
00:05:53,197 --> 00:05:55,162
I'm just, you know-
I'm kind of stuck

145
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:57,719
- in a dramedy ghetto.
- Really?

146
00:05:57,763 --> 00:06:00,422
Well, I did the cancer scare episode
of "Home Improvement,"

147
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:04,224
- so I got typed as this guy who does ticker.
- Oh, Jeez.

148
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:06,228
Now they want me to do
all the teardrop stuff.

149
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:08,591
I want to get back to the funny,
to the shtoomy.

150
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:11,560
- The shtoomy, yeah.
- Are you and Richard Lewis still tight?

151
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:15,219
- Is there any way you can just
give him a-? - I'm really not...

152
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,419
- You're not tight anymore?
- Not really tight.

153
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,688
'Cause they're floating my name
to direct his pilot

154
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,284
and I just would love
to be in on that.

155
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,519
Well, if I run into him,
I'll, you know...

156
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,288
Yeah, if I had a recommendation
from you, though,

157
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,292
that would mean
that I'd have a shot at this.

158
00:06:28,326 --> 00:06:31,314
The sitcom- you know,
I'd come in at 9:00-10:00,

159
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,882
- I'd get a chance to see my son
in the morning... - It's a great...

160
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,551
...I'd get a chance to see him at night.
So anything you could do

161
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:39,955
to recommend me to Richard
would be just great.

162
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:43,151
Yeah, I'll-
I'll recommend you.

163
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:45,090
- Bless your heart. Bless your heart.
- Yeah.

164
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:48,318
Hey, Larry, do you still have
that tickle in your anus?

165
00:06:48,358 --> 00:06:50,516
I cannot get you an appointment
for two weeks.

166
00:06:50,557 --> 00:06:52,887
What?

167
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,683
Are you experiencing
discomfort?

168
00:06:56,724 --> 00:07:00,281
Tickle in my- what is she talking about?
What are you talking about?

169
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:02,379
- Where did you get that from?
- That's nothing to joke around about.

170
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,581
Who were you trying
to get an appointment with?

171
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,452
- Rosenberg.
- Rosenberg is a good man.

172
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:07,580
I've got a better one.
Pencil.

173
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:10,088
Call this man-
Dr. Jay Whitney.

174
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:13,486
My wife's cousin Kai-
she runs the office.

175
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:15,953
- Oh, she does?
- She can open all the doors,

176
00:07:15,989 --> 00:07:17,920
and not just the back one,
you know what I mean?

177
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:19,681
Seriously, she can
get you in today.

178
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,312
- Yeah.
- You don't have to think about it.

179
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:23,752
It's nice of you, but there's really
nothing wrong.

180
00:07:23,787 --> 00:07:25,718
Why did you say
I have a tickle in my anus?

181
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:28,845
Are you fucking crazy, huh?
A tickle in my anus?

182
00:07:28,887 --> 00:07:30,681
- She's just looking out for you.
- Why did you say that?

183
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,084
I don't have a tickle.
Who said that?

184
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,846
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

185
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:35,784
Look, I think I've given you
the wrong impression.

186
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,717
- Larry's anus is fine.
- Shut the fuck up, okay?

187
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:40,616
Shut the fuck up!
Sorry.

188
00:07:40,653 --> 00:07:43,050
All I'm saying is, don't take
any chances here, okay?

189
00:07:43,085 --> 00:07:44,984
- This is serious, all right?
- Yeah, no.

190
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:46,779
- Good, 'cause I care about you-
- Yeah, thanks.

191
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:48,682
- ...not just 'cause-
- Good to see you.

192
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,377
- And you.
- I'm gonna call Richie right now.

193
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:52,111
- Thanks, Ant-
- Antoinette.

194
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:53,740
- Yeah.
- I'll take care of that.

195
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:56,511
- Okay, thank you, Larry. Thanks so much.
- Okay.

196
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:02,699
Hi, it's Richard.
Leave a message.

197
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,759
Hey, Richard, it's Larry.

198
00:08:04,803 --> 00:08:06,770
Matt Tessler
just asked me

199
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,669
to recommend him
for your pilot...

200
00:08:08,706 --> 00:08:11,038
...so this is me calling

201
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:13,338
to recommend...

202
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,401
"recommend" him.

203
00:08:15,445 --> 00:08:18,209
So in case
he ever asks you

204
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,546
if I recommended him,
you can tell him

205
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,848
that in fact I did

206
00:08:23,887 --> 00:08:26,878
recommend him.

207
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,787
All right,
I'll talk to you later.

208
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:34,161
- Hi.
- Hi.

209
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,460
Just sign in, please,
and have a seat.

210
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:38,089
Shouldn't be too long.

211
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:40,566
I have a little problem
with this...

212
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:44,233
these sign-in sheets,
you know.

213
00:08:44,272 --> 00:08:46,796
My name's right
out in the open here.

214
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,003
It's a bit
of a privacy issue.

215
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:52,704
There's no shame
in having to come

216
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,542
to the gastroenterologist's
office.

217
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,412
It's a little embarrassing
maybe, you know.

218
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:58,678
We could just put a sign up
on the wall saying,

219
00:08:58,717 --> 00:09:01,743
"Larry David was here."
Why don't we do that?

220
00:09:01,787 --> 00:09:03,414
You know,
I have to tell you

221
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:04,853
I've worked here
for four years

222
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:06,584
and I've never had
anyone come in

223
00:09:06,624 --> 00:09:09,149
and, like, cruise the list
of patient names

224
00:09:09,194 --> 00:09:10,786
for any reason.

225
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:14,128
What if you are
in charge of this, okay,

226
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:15,860
so this is down here?
You keep that.

227
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,526
I don't like that.
First of all,

228
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:19,297
I only get paid
$9 an hour,

229
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:21,531
so it's a little more responsibility
than I'm used to,

230
00:09:21,572 --> 00:09:23,005
to keep track
of patients.

231
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,166
Second of all,
I can't even make decisions.

232
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,801
You have to take it up
with the home office.

233
00:09:26,844 --> 00:09:29,539
I would like to take it up with
the home office. See, you didn't think

234
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:32,013
- I was gonna take you up on that.
- No, I did think you were.

235
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:35,017
- You strike me as that type.
- Well, things like this interest me.

236
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:38,451
I'm not an inventor,
but I'm an improver.

237
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:40,386
I improve things
that are broken.

238
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,049
This is broken.
This system is broken.

239
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,717
I'd like to improve it.

240
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:46,420
Great. I'm assuming you're
a new patient,

241
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,121
'cause I think I would
have remembered you.

242
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,392
- So please fill that out.
- Okay.

243
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:56,930
What would you do
if I sat there, huh?

244
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,996
You'd be a little freaked out if I
sat there, wouldn't you, honestly?

245
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,008
- A little bit. A little bit.
- I think a lot.

246
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:05,033
Yeah, that's
a little creepy.

247
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:06,272
What are you reading?

248
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:08,575
It is called
"Showbiz Insider."

249
00:10:08,614 --> 00:10:11,277
- Really?
- I like to feel like an insider when...

250
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:14,513
- Pretty heady stuff. Wow.
- Yes, very heady stuff.

251
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:16,679
Many are called.
Few are chosen.

252
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:19,122
You must be
very very bright.

253
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:21,283
Yes.

254
00:10:21,325 --> 00:10:23,486
Where are you from,
New York?

255
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:25,495
- I'm picking up an accent.
- Yeah.

256
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:27,723
Yeah.
You from New York?

257
00:10:27,764 --> 00:10:29,129
Yeah.

258
00:10:30,868 --> 00:10:32,960
But I'm not a Jew,
if that's what you're thinking.

259
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:36,532
'Cause I saw
your wheels spinning.

260
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:40,338
That's uncanny. It's like there's
a window into my soul

261
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:41,900
and you can just
really read me.

262
00:10:41,944 --> 00:10:43,707
I read you
loud and clear, sister.

263
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:46,214
- Yes.
- Yeah.

264
00:10:46,248 --> 00:10:47,874
Are you okay, by the way?
Do you have any...

265
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,715
you have some terrible medical problem
that brought you here?

266
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:53,152
I'm fine.
Checkup.

267
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:56,088
- Checkup?
- Mmm.

268
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:58,524
Hmm, really?

269
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,219
You?

270
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,853
- Checkup.
- Really?

271
00:11:01,896 --> 00:11:04,125
- Yeah.
- Huh.

272
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,564
- How about that?
- Let me ask you a question:

273
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,500
did you ever go out
with a bald guy?

274
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:12,229
- Yeah.
- How did you find it?

275
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,863
It was magical.

276
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:15,999
- Yeah? See?
- Yes.

277
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:19,169
How am I doing
on the flirt so far?

278
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,179
- How would you assess it?
- Um...

279
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,703
- Pretty good?
- I'm- well, 7.5.

280
00:11:23,748 --> 00:11:25,545
- 7.5? Really?
- 7.5, yeah.

281
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:28,051
- You're tough.
- Larry David?

282
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:29,451
- You're up.
- All right.

283
00:11:29,487 --> 00:11:31,681
Well, they have
called for me.

284
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,156
Larry?

285
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:36,284
I guess I'll go in
for my checkup.

286
00:11:37,394 --> 00:11:39,988
- Checkup.
- Nice talking to you.

287
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,554
Good luck.

288
00:11:43,232 --> 00:11:44,756
So long.

289
00:11:47,036 --> 00:11:49,004
Hello, Mr. David.
How are you?

290
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:51,232
- Good.
- Good. All right.

291
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:53,834
Oh, you know my cousin
Matt Tessler.

292
00:11:53,876 --> 00:11:55,342
Oh, Matt's your cousin?
Oh, yeah.

293
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:57,311
Oh, right.
Oh, thank you for this...

294
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:58,870
Yeah, sure sure sure.

295
00:11:58,914 --> 00:12:00,939
So let me ask you,
Mr. David,

296
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:02,813
why are you here
to see the doctor?

297
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,445
Um...

298
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:07,852
I'd just as soon
tell the doctor.

299
00:12:07,888 --> 00:12:10,355
It's okay. I've got to take all
the information first

300
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:13,053
and I give it to the doctor. So why don't
you tell me the reason you're here?

301
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:15,027
I know, but if the doctor's
gonna come in here,

302
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:17,120
why not just tell the doctor?
I don't see why

303
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:19,529
I need to tell you and-
then you have to tell the doctor.

304
00:12:19,566 --> 00:12:21,999
- Well...
- Why not just tell him directly?

305
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:24,094
I'm going to New York.
Why am I stopping off in Florida?

306
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:26,832
Mm-hmm. Policy is that I take
the information down first

307
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:29,272
and I give it to him.
He'll come in and go over this.

308
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:31,105
So he'll have it all
written down.

309
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:32,838
He won't have to go through
all of the questions again.

310
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,072
- This whole thing is askew, your system.
- Mm-hmm.

311
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:37,480
The doctor should be in here right now.
We could be saving time.

312
00:12:37,516 --> 00:12:39,210
He's got other patients
that he's dealing with,

313
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,116
so what I'm here- I pretty much
cut the time in half with him.

314
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,519
Cut the time in half?
So you intercept him in the hall?

315
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,351
He's gonna get the information
and then what,

316
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,449
run to the internet
to look it up? No.

317
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:51,359
- He's gonna hear it from you.
- Doctors and nurses work hand in hand.

318
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,624
I just need the information.
If you could just give it to me...

319
00:12:53,662 --> 00:12:55,858
I'm not that comfortable
telling you, frankly.

320
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,661
I need to take it down
before I can leave.

321
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,329
Okay, I have a gerbil
up my ass.

322
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,339
That's my problem.

323
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,605
How long
has it been there?

324
00:13:09,644 --> 00:13:12,704
Two days.

325
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:16,608
Okay, thank you.
The doctor will be right with you.

326
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,641
Fine.
Happy?

327
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:23,519
- Mr. David.
- Hello, Doctor.

328
00:13:23,557 --> 00:13:25,524
- Larry, nice to see you.
- Okay.

329
00:13:25,558 --> 00:13:27,527
I was wondering
if you could tell me

330
00:13:27,561 --> 00:13:30,051
what seems to be
the problem.

331
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:46,404
Hey, what happened...

332
00:13:46,445 --> 00:13:48,310
what happened
to the sign-in sheet?

333
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:50,677
Oh, I called our
corporate headquarters

334
00:13:50,714 --> 00:13:52,512
off your suggestion
and they loved it.

335
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:55,041
- So there's a new policy.
- What?

336
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:57,053
It's private,
just like you wanted.

337
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,147
No no no,
I don't want that.

338
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:02,590
You're listening to me?
I don't know what I'm talking about.

339
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,615
Put the sign-in sheet
back on.

340
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,822
- I can't. No.
- What?

341
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,330
You can't see this now.

342
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:13,427
First of all, I've got
to tell you something,

343
00:14:13,469 --> 00:14:15,437
- okay?
- Yes.

344
00:14:15,471 --> 00:14:17,438
I want to apologize

345
00:14:17,472 --> 00:14:19,668
for the way
I behaved earlier.

346
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,675
Mr. David,

347
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:24,042
you don't have to
play games with me.

348
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,636
- I don't?
- No.

349
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,409
Are you looking
for Christopher?

350
00:14:28,448 --> 00:14:30,109
No.

351
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:32,641
- Andrew?
- Keep going.

352
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:33,846
Paula?

353
00:14:33,887 --> 00:14:35,548
Aha.

354
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:38,183
- You cannot tell. I could get fired.
- No no no, never.

355
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:40,692
- No no no no.
- I have no formal education.

356
00:14:40,726 --> 00:14:42,785
- No no no no no.
- Okay.

357
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:45,296
Be careful.

358
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:47,356
- Thank you.
- She looks like a live wire.

359
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:51,670
- You called her?
- Yeah.

360
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:54,137
So where are you going
to take her on a date?

361
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:55,697
I'm gonna take her
to the movies maybe.

362
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:57,674
That's great.

363
00:14:57,709 --> 00:14:59,677
The question is,
why was she at that...

364
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:01,678
what kind of doctor
was that again?

365
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:03,839
- Mm, gastroenterologist.
- So what was she doing there?

366
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,314
- That's the question.
- Oh my God.

367
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:06,941
Why was she there?
I don't know.

368
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:08,952
I hope she doesn't have
the same thing I do.

369
00:15:08,986 --> 00:15:10,977
Well, that's a good thing.
It'll go away.

370
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:12,544
Yeah.

371
00:15:12,588 --> 00:15:14,055
Let me ask you
a question:

372
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,615
How much will you give me
to start gargling now?

373
00:15:16,659 --> 00:15:18,820
- 50 bucks.
- You'll give me 50 bucks?

374
00:15:18,861 --> 00:15:20,487
- 50 bucks.
- Take it out of your pocket.

375
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:22,589
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

376
00:15:22,632 --> 00:15:24,929
Just do it.
What, you don't trust me?

377
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:30,068
Here you go.

378
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,664
- I just got 50 bucks.
- No, now that doesn't count.

379
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,698
- No, you can't do that.
- No, what are you talking about?

380
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:38,211
I would have paid that happily.
It was so enjoyable.

381
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:41,976
It was so enjoyable and you ruined it
with "I just got 50 bucks."

382
00:15:42,016 --> 00:15:44,609
Let me ask you a question:
Tessler's still one of your clients?

383
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:46,984
Yeah. He's coming
to the bat mitzvah.

384
00:15:47,021 --> 00:15:48,783
You know who else is coming
to the bat mitzvah?

385
00:15:48,821 --> 00:15:50,413
My newest client
John Legend.

386
00:15:50,456 --> 00:15:53,220
He's a huge R&B singer.

387
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,749
I have no idea
who this guy is.

388
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:56,727
- Do you know who anyone is?
- No.

389
00:15:56,762 --> 00:15:58,491
When was the last time

390
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,225
- you bought an album?
- 1972?

391
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,790
- '72? So you know no one.
- No, I know nothing.

392
00:16:02,834 --> 00:16:05,199
Anyhow, he's my client now.
He's coming

393
00:16:05,236 --> 00:16:07,602
to the bat mitzvah.
He's gonna sing.

394
00:16:07,638 --> 00:16:09,936
Well, maybe I'll bring
this woman.

395
00:16:09,974 --> 00:16:12,568
You know, if we get along tonight,
I'm gonna ask her.

396
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,009
'Cause you gotta bring somebody.
Cheryl's coming with that guy.

397
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,842
- You gotta be there with somebody.
- Absolutely.

398
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,848
Why don't we
double-date tonight?

399
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:21,043
You know what? Susie and I were
talking about going to the movies.

400
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:22,312
You're kidding.
Let's do it.

401
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:23,682
Perfect.
I can check her out.

402
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:30,715
I haven't dated in a while.
Who pays?

403
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,557
- You pay.
- Don't be ridiculous. You pay.

404
00:16:33,596 --> 00:16:35,358
- I do?
- Yes, you pay.

405
00:16:35,396 --> 00:16:37,627
- Larry's not used to dating.
- Clearly, yes.

406
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,133
- No, I haven't dated in a long time.
- No, a long time.

407
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:43,729
What do I do? Am I allowed
to hold hands during the mo-?

408
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:46,069
- I don't know if there's rules-
- Is there a rule?

409
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:49,770
Excuse me.

410
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:51,778
Thank you.

411
00:16:51,812 --> 00:16:53,973
Hi.

412
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:58,212
One movie.

413
00:16:58,252 --> 00:17:00,242
Thank you.

414
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,082
- Don't you want to sit on the aisle?
- No.

415
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,424
- I was being nice.
- Center's better.

416
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,793
Center? Why? You think
there's a big difference

417
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,457
- over there from here?
- Yes, this is good.

418
00:17:13,498 --> 00:17:15,557
As long as a giant man
doesn't sit

419
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,795
- in front of me.
- Or a giant woman.

420
00:17:18,836 --> 00:17:20,701
- Oh my God.
- What?

421
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,706
This guy.
That's the guy

422
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,038
who walked past the line
to get his ticket before.

423
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:26,871
- Oh, yeah.
- Pete!

424
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:28,400
- Look at him.
- I think it is.

425
00:17:28,445 --> 00:17:30,537
Oh my God.
He was faking.

426
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,013
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

427
00:17:32,048 --> 00:17:34,015
That's really good.

428
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:35,915
- Oh my God.
- Holy shit.

429
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:37,816
I gotta
take my hat off to him.

430
00:17:37,853 --> 00:17:40,321
I gotta tell ya,
that's pretty good.

431
00:18:01,574 --> 00:18:02,734
Are you okay?

432
00:18:02,776 --> 00:18:04,641
Yeah, I'm fine.

433
00:18:04,678 --> 00:18:06,578
Why? Why are you
asking me that?

434
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:08,604
No reason.

435
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:16,354
Everything okay
with you?

436
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,355
Yeah, fine.

437
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:19,550
Are you sure?

438
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:21,785
Yeah.
Why shouldn't it be?

439
00:18:21,826 --> 00:18:23,794
It's just you're
squirming a lot.

440
00:18:23,828 --> 00:18:25,193
You're squirming
more than I am.

441
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,560
Well, my seat
is uncomfortable.

442
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,258
Yeah, my seat's
uncomfortable too.

443
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,698
I know.
We're in agreement.

444
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,635
Why did you say
you went

445
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,432
to that
gastroenterologist's again?

446
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:36,268
- I was there for a checkup.
- A checkup?

447
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:38,399
- Yes. Why do you keep asking me that?
- I've never heard

448
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:40,909
of anybody going to
a gastroenterologist for a checkup.

449
00:18:40,943 --> 00:18:42,911
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

450
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:44,913
That's what you were
doing there.

451
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:47,211
- Is that what I said?
- Yes, that's what you said.

452
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:53,419
Honestly, I'm just really kind
of bored with this movie.

453
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,588
It's not so bad.

454
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:59,354
I really want to go.
Can we go?

455
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:01,088
Please.

456
00:19:01,128 --> 00:19:03,097
Are you gonna
drag me out of this movie

457
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:04,859
with five minutes to go?
That's insane.

458
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:08,299
It's not five minutes.
This is the world's worst film

459
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:10,394
I've ever seen
and I really want to go.

460
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,268
Come on,
five more minutes.

461
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:15,434
What do you gain by staying?
You don't care about this story.

462
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:16,965
I finish
things I start.

463
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:18,533
Books- they could be
500 pages,

464
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:20,602
once I start them,
even if I hate it, I'll finish it.

465
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:22,614
I have friends
who I can't stand,

466
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:25,582
you know,
for, like, 25 years.

467
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:27,585
I'm still friends
with them.

468
00:19:27,619 --> 00:19:29,382
Why?

469
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:31,946
Because I stay to the end,
till they're dead.

470
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:34,219
I go down with the ship.
That's what I do.

471
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,226
I'm not even the captain,
I'm going down with the ship.

472
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,091
That's how I want you
to think about me:

473
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:40,097
I'm the guy who keeps
the captain company.

474
00:19:43,134 --> 00:19:45,431
I can't watch this.

475
00:19:47,371 --> 00:19:50,430
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.

476
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:52,463
- Where is she going?
- I don't...

477
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,905
- She was bored.
- It's almost over.

478
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,412
I know.
I told her.

479
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,074
It's five minutes to go.
It's crazy.

480
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,776
You'd better
go out after her.

481
00:20:01,817 --> 00:20:03,875
- She's not gonna wait for you.
- You don't expect

482
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:06,217
somebody else to leave
if you're walking out of the movie.

483
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:09,348
- You don't understand women.
- You don't understand etiquette.

484
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,381
Fine.

485
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,999
- Where is she?
- She's not here.

486
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:31,168
- Are you surprised?
- Can you believe it?

487
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,440
- Yeah, that's rude.
- I told you she was gonna leave.

488
00:20:33,479 --> 00:20:35,469
- That was completely rude, unbelievable.
- By the way,

489
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:37,504
I timed it. There were six minutes
left in that movie.

490
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,177
Irrelevant, Larry.
She was not gonna wait for you.

491
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:42,618
I invested an hour and a half.
I'm supposed to leave

492
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:44,884
- with six minutes to go?
- The last six minutes. That's craziness.

493
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:47,254
So, fine. You were right
and now you're alone.

494
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:50,853
Yeah, well, she has a tickle
in her anus anyway.

495
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:53,863
- She has a tickle in her anus?
- I think so. She was squirming in her seat.

496
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:55,227
I don't wanna hear it.
Let's go.

497
00:20:55,264 --> 00:20:57,062
You know what?
That movie stunk, by the way.

498
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,466
No, it was great.
You're crazy.

499
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,061
So you're not gonna go
to the bat mitzvah?

500
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:03,969
Eh, I don't want
to go by myself.

501
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:05,940
And Cheryl's gonna be there
with this guy.

502
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:07,805
So we'll get you
a date...

503
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:10,870
my next-door neighbor.
She's a belly dancer.

504
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,641
She also was
in Cirque du Soleil.

505
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:14,444
Yeah, that's the one
with the nose rings, right?

506
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:17,077
- She can take 'em out.
- Then there's a hole in the nose.

507
00:21:17,118 --> 00:21:18,846
We'll just cover it
with makeup.

508
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:21,878
Blech!

509
00:21:21,922 --> 00:21:23,583
Do you want any coffee?
I'm gonna go get coffee.

510
00:21:23,624 --> 00:21:25,649
No, I don't want
anything.

511
00:21:25,693 --> 00:21:28,992
This way. This is the one I was
telling you that I think is just perfect.

512
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:31,223
- This is great.
- Yeah, available the first of the month.

513
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,095
All we need is your signature
on the paperwork.

514
00:21:33,132 --> 00:21:35,600
- That's great. Two months upfront?
- Upfront.

515
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:38,035
- Two parking spaces. It's all yours.
- How do you heat it?

516
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:40,300
Oh, you've got your own thermostat
right there, see?

517
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:43,308
I've got to take this.
Will you excuse me for one second?

518
00:21:43,342 --> 00:21:46,243
- I'll be right back.
- Sure. Yeah, okay, good.

519
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:48,679
Hi, I'm just...

520
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:50,840
Hello!

521
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:53,578
- How are you?
- I'm- I'm good.

522
00:21:53,618 --> 00:21:56,246
Are you
renting the office...

523
00:21:56,287 --> 00:21:58,413
- ...next door?
- I'm thinking about it.

524
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:02,414
That's very good.
We'll be friends.

525
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,826
Well, you know,
I'm looking at several places.

526
00:22:05,862 --> 00:22:08,057
- I should probably catch up-
- We'll go to lunch together.

527
00:22:08,098 --> 00:22:10,032
- Yeah.
- Every day, every day.

528
00:22:10,066 --> 00:22:12,556
- Every day.
- Every day, lunch.

529
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:14,796
Uh, listen,
you're probably busy.

530
00:22:14,837 --> 00:22:16,464
No, I'm not. I have nothing
to do here.

531
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:18,699
I've got to find the office manager.
Thank you.

532
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,606
Goodbye.
Bye.

533
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:22,803
I hope you rent
the office.

534
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:25,278
Larry, wh-?

535
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:27,406
- Oh, hey.
- Am I interrupting something?

536
00:22:27,448 --> 00:22:28,915
No.

537
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,917
I just came by
to say thanks

538
00:22:30,951 --> 00:22:32,852
for the recommendation.
I got the gig.

539
00:22:32,887 --> 00:22:34,513
- You got the job?
- Yeah.

540
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:37,023
What's this about?
Is this supposed to be funny?

541
00:22:37,057 --> 00:22:38,388
No no no.

542
00:22:38,425 --> 00:22:40,825
Someone was gonna
rent the office next door...

543
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,420
This is how you welcome him?
You use some humor?

544
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:46,226
No no no, it was a test to see
if he's a tolerant person.

545
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,290
And anyone who's not
is no neighbor of mine.

546
00:22:48,334 --> 00:22:50,198
I know somebody who wouldn't
find this funny at all.

547
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,103
He's a 10-year-old boy named Max
and he lives in my house...

548
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,299
- who's not gonna think that's so funny.
- Oh, Jeez.

549
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,309
This is what you do?
You sit on your ass

550
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,333
- making fun of retarded people?
- Oh, come on.

551
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:01,174
- Un-fucking-believable.
- I was just, you know...

552
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,678
I'm really
disappointed in you.

553
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,841
I would rent an office
to your son.

554
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,316
My son has an office
on the right hand of Jesus.

555
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:09,911
Hey, you know
what's really funny?

556
00:23:09,954 --> 00:23:13,117
A successful writer-producer
who puts gerbils up his ass for fun.

557
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:16,183
- What? What?
- I talked to Kai. I talked to my cousin.

558
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:18,420
- That's why you had to see the doctor.
- Oh, that's bullshit.

559
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:20,486
- 'Cause you have gerbils in your ass.
- I made that up, you moron.

560
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,589
- Why would you make that up?
- Because I didn't feel

561
00:23:22,632 --> 00:23:24,862
- like telling her what was wrong with me.
- That doesn't make any sense.

562
00:23:24,901 --> 00:23:28,165
And you know what? I think a lot of people
would get a kick out of this.

563
00:23:28,203 --> 00:23:30,194
I really do.
Fuck you, Larry.

564
00:23:30,238 --> 00:23:32,001
Let's just try it out
on the street.

565
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,473
- Hey, no, I made that up.
- Hey, wanna hear something funny?

566
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,101
Hey, you wanna hear
something funny?

567
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:44,813
So sorry.
Do we still have time to do it?

568
00:23:44,852 --> 00:23:46,648
- I'm sorry.
- No. I'm late now.

569
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,552
- It's too late for lunch?
- It's too late for lunch

570
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:50,146
and it's too late
for my career

571
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,851
and you fucked me
with Tessler.

572
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:54,291
- He's not working out?
- He sucks!

573
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:56,454
- He doesn't know comedy.
- I know that, I know.

574
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:58,622
He should be
selling fabrics.

575
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:00,461
Why'd you hire him?

576
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:02,433
How d-?
You...

577
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:04,527
my friend of 47 years-
you recommended him.

578
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,936
Oh, I recommended him?
When I called you

579
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:09,030
I told you that he asked me
to recommend him...

580
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:10,597
- What-?
- ... so I'm "recommending" him.

581
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:12,132
I put quotes around it.

582
00:24:12,176 --> 00:24:14,201
Why'd you "recommend" him,
Mr. Quotehead?

583
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:17,213
I thought that you would pick up that
it was a non-recommend recommend.

584
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,876
You know, life is
very brief, okay?

585
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,884
And you know I need
a good series.

586
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,148
- Is life too short? You think it's too short?
- Yeah.

587
00:24:25,187 --> 00:24:28,214
- It's too short, isn't it?
- But now my life is fucking way short.

588
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,088
- I'm sorry.
- You ruined my fucking pilot

589
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:31,423
because of your
recommendation.

590
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,928
I can see if it came
from a skinhead...

591
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:35,931
- Yeah.
- ... or one of Ben Laden's people.

592
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,864
You call him
Ben Laden or Bin Laden?

593
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,595
I don't know.

594
00:24:39,635 --> 00:24:41,727
You called him Ben.
That's almost like a Jewish name.

595
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,567
That's true.
Ben Laden does sound

596
00:24:43,605 --> 00:24:45,505
- like a shirt-maker in Manhattan.
- Yes, I know.

597
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,531
"Let's go to Ben Laden's.
They got great collars."

598
00:24:47,575 --> 00:24:49,565
Exactly, yeah.
Anyway, I'm...

599
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,545
- No-
- I'm sorry.

600
00:24:51,579 --> 00:24:53,739
Yeah, fine, fi...

601
00:24:54,948 --> 00:24:56,744
It's true, isn't it?

602
00:24:56,783 --> 00:24:59,753
- Holy shit.
- What are you talking about?

603
00:24:59,787 --> 00:25:01,583
Did you stick a gerbil
up your ass?

604
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:03,987
- 'Cause the whole fucking town-
- Are you out of your mind?

605
00:25:04,023 --> 00:25:05,991
It's all over the set.
It's everywhere.

606
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:07,992
- And I said-
- Jesus,

607
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:10,655
this Tessler is spreading
this rumor about me

608
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,288
to get back at me.

609
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,991
It's all over
the fucking city now.

610
00:25:14,032 --> 00:25:15,828
It's gonna be
on the internet too.

611
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:17,835
It's everywhere.
It's everywhere.

612
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:21,361
Jesus Christ, did you see the way
that guy looked at me?

613
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:23,397
I'm sure he probably
read "Gerbil" magazine

614
00:25:23,442 --> 00:25:25,602
and you're
fucking on the cover.

615
00:25:25,643 --> 00:25:27,769
Holy shit.

616
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:31,713
You know, I do have
a tickle in my anus.

617
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:33,716
Oh, really?

618
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,014
- Yeah.
- I gotta split.

619
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:41,914
Hi, Carol.

620
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:45,026
Carol,

621
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,960
it's not true.

622
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:50,456
...some crazy shit.

623
00:25:50,499 --> 00:25:52,466
- It's missing. And you hear this shit.
- Leon!

624
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,867
Leon, I don't really think
he would do something like that.

625
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:56,563
- I don't think-
- You don't know, Loretta.

626
00:25:56,604 --> 00:25:58,868
Think about it.
Look, the gerbil's missing, right?

627
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:00,999
And then you hear this shit's
going on. Come on now.

628
00:26:01,042 --> 00:26:03,168
Add this shit up.
Add this shit up.

629
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:05,701
Here he comes now. What's going on?
What's going on, Larry?

630
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:08,647
The gerbil got on the elevator, hit "up"
and went up your asshole?

631
00:26:08,682 --> 00:26:11,115
- Is that what happened?
- Leon!

632
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,450
I can't believe that this thing has already
gotten to this house,

633
00:26:14,488 --> 00:26:16,785
- that you would accuse me of that.
- Larry, where's the gerbil?

634
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:19,187
- I got your back. I don't think you did it.
- Thank you.

635
00:26:19,224 --> 00:26:20,852
I didn't even want
that thing in the house,

636
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:23,122
- much less put it up my ass, okay?
- Let him out, Larry.

637
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:26,222
So, wait a minute.
Are you saying you didn't do that?

638
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,596
Absolutely. Of course not.
Come on, that's insane.

639
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,658
That's what I thought.

640
00:26:30,701 --> 00:26:32,498
I'm still sick about the fact
that that thing is

641
00:26:32,536 --> 00:26:34,232
running around
the house somewhere.

642
00:26:34,272 --> 00:26:36,671
- Yeah, all right. Whatever, man.
- We're done packing.

643
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:38,504
- All right.
- All right, sweetness.

644
00:26:38,542 --> 00:26:41,534
- Hey, y'all got everything together?
- Yeah, we're done.

645
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:44,307
- All right, that's good.
- You ready to roll?

646
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:47,441
Wow, this is really
happening, isn't it?

647
00:26:47,483 --> 00:26:49,576
- Oh yeah, we're about ready to bounce.
- Yeah.

648
00:26:49,619 --> 00:26:51,381
- When are you going?
- Tomorrow.

649
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,547
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

650
00:26:53,589 --> 00:26:56,523
Can you believe it?

651
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:59,186
- We're out of here, man.
- Oh my God.

652
00:26:59,227 --> 00:27:02,821
- Wow.
- It crept up on you, right?

653
00:27:02,863 --> 00:27:04,855
You're gonna
miss us, Larry.

654
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,526
We're gonna
miss you too, Larry.

655
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:08,467
All right, don't get my
waterworks going here.

656
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,629
- You know how emotional I am.
- All right, okay.

657
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,832
We're gonna miss you, Larry.
That's deep.

658
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:16,364
Yeah. All right, I've got to get ready
for a bat mitzvah.

659
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:18,877
- What's that?
- It's a Jewish ceremony, you know.

660
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,402
- Oh.
- It's a big party.

661
00:27:20,446 --> 00:27:22,538
You don't wanna
go with me, do you?

662
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:25,676
- You want me to go?
- Yeah, come on.

663
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:28,015
Sure, I'll go
with you, L.D.

664
00:27:28,053 --> 00:27:29,749
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

665
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:31,722
- A bat mitzvah.
- Yeah.

666
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:35,089
My little girl
is so perfect.

667
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,501
- Thank you. How are you doing?
- Naches to you.

668
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:53,872
You saw the early rehearsals.
When you left

669
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:56,310
they had a run-through.
The network stormed out.

670
00:27:56,346 --> 00:27:59,678
How in the fuck could my best friend
recommend such an asshole?

671
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:02,582
- Why didn't you say you didn't like him?
- Any normal person

672
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:04,415
would have picked up
on what I was trying to say.

673
00:28:04,453 --> 00:28:06,443
Now I'm abnormal.
Oh, now I'm not normal.

674
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:08,456
Yeah, you are abnormal.

675
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,753
You're the most abnormal,
jerky nutcase

676
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:12,623
I've ever met
in my entire...

677
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,220
- you think you're more normal than me?
- Fuckin'- A I am.

678
00:28:15,263 --> 00:28:17,254
I'll have a mental patient face-off
with you any day.

679
00:28:17,297 --> 00:28:20,790
- Oh, really?
- Larr, did you stick a gerbil up your ass?

680
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:22,995
- Who told you that?
- I'm not gonna tell you who told me.

681
00:28:23,036 --> 00:28:25,367
- It's not important.
- Of course I didn't stick a gerbil up my ass!

682
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,669
- Don't get so upset.
- I'm upset!

683
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,470
- He's telling everyone.
- Yeah, he sure is.

684
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,601
Oh my God.

685
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,377
On behalf of my
wonderful wife Susie

686
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,886
and myself
I want to welcome you.

687
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,979
Thank you all so much
for coming.

688
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,491
It means a lot to us,

689
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,890
a lot to Sammie,

690
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:53,863
I can tell you that.
We're very proud of her.

691
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,866
I don't want
to embarrass her,

692
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,867
so I'm gonna keep this short
and just say

693
00:28:57,901 --> 00:28:59,870
thank you from the bottom
of our hearts.

694
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,371
What we're gonna do
right now is open it up

695
00:29:02,405 --> 00:29:04,703
to anybody who'd like
to say something,

696
00:29:04,741 --> 00:29:07,642
make a toast, whatever.
Come on up.

697
00:29:07,677 --> 00:29:10,076
- Yeah, I'm gonna-
- Larry.

698
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:13,309
- I'd like to say something.
- All right.

699
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:17,112
Hey.
Um...

700
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:20,985
well, first of all,
I'm so thrilled

701
00:29:21,022 --> 00:29:23,422
to be here at Sammie's
bat mitzvah tonight.

702
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,789
- Thank you, Larry.
- This is a fantastic occasion.

703
00:29:25,826 --> 00:29:28,021
You know,
I've known Sammie

704
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:30,530
since she was born,
actually.

705
00:29:30,564 --> 00:29:32,428
- I was in the hospital, remember?
- Yeah.

706
00:29:32,465 --> 00:29:34,399
I was in the hospital
that day

707
00:29:34,434 --> 00:29:37,164
and I saw her when she was,
like, five minutes old.

708
00:29:37,203 --> 00:29:39,330
It was not a pretty
sight for me.

709
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:41,805
It was the first time I ever saw
one of those things, you know.

710
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,400
Um, anyway, what I really want
to talk about tonight

711
00:29:44,443 --> 00:29:48,208
is that
there's a guest here

712
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,807
spreading a vicious,
nasty, scurrilous rumor

713
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,816
about me and a gerbil.

714
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,647
Okay? I'm sure
you've heard it.

715
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:57,678
And there's not a word of truth
to it, okay?

716
00:29:57,722 --> 00:30:00,554
He has a personal vendetta,
so don't believe one word of that.

717
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:03,856
It's not true.
However,

718
00:30:03,894 --> 00:30:05,862
in the interest
of full disclosure

719
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:07,863
I will tell you
that, um,

720
00:30:07,897 --> 00:30:09,729
I do have a tickle
in my anus.

721
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,462
And they're slightly
related to each other.

722
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:15,471
What did he say?

723
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:17,904
The point is, it's not true.
I just thought it was

724
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,964
- important to say that.
- That's fine, Larry.

725
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:22,500
- It's not right that he would spread...
- Thank you very much.

726
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:25,206
- ...that vicious rumor.
- Larry, thank you very much. Enough.

727
00:30:25,246 --> 00:30:27,477
What are you looking at,
Tessler?

728
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:29,779
I'll put
a fist up your ass.

729
00:30:29,818 --> 00:30:32,342
How about that,
huh?

730
00:30:32,386 --> 00:30:34,355
Well, um,

731
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:36,652
if anyone else
has a toast,

732
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,681
something to say...

733
00:30:57,242 --> 00:30:59,233
I'll be right back.

734
00:31:03,414 --> 00:31:04,973
- Hi.
- Hello.

735
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:06,814
- How are you doing?
- Nice to see you.

736
00:31:06,852 --> 00:31:08,716
- Remember Glenn?
- Sure.

737
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:10,982
- Sammie looks cute.
- Yeah.

738
00:31:11,021 --> 00:31:14,219
- Very cute. She's all grown up.
- Yeah, I know.

739
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:16,225
- Oh, your underwear-
- Yes.

740
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:18,955
- ...got 'em on.
- My underwear? You're in the no-fly zone?

741
00:31:18,995 --> 00:31:21,122
- I'm going right over the fence.
- You're over the fence?

742
00:31:21,164 --> 00:31:22,756
- Over the fence.
- Did you miss the gate?

743
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,699
- Not at all.
- Don't even think about the gate?

744
00:31:24,734 --> 00:31:27,258
- Don't even think about it.
- That's wonderful. Thank you.

745
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,863
- You look good.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

746
00:31:33,375 --> 00:31:36,434
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

747
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,412
This one
goes out to Sammie.

748
00:31:39,447 --> 00:31:40,914
Would you like
to dance?

749
00:31:40,948 --> 00:31:43,178
Um, yes. I mean,
if you don't mind.

750
00:31:43,217 --> 00:31:45,208
- No, please.
- Would you excuse us?

751
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,024
Would you care to dance?

752
00:32:32,061 --> 00:32:34,052
Thank you.

753
00:33:20,405 --> 00:33:23,601
Wake up, wake up!

754
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:28,474
Get the ball, Daryl!

755
00:33:28,513 --> 00:33:30,241
Slide tackle,
number 2, Black.

756
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,748
- What, you're gonna cite that?
- Of course.

757
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:33,271
What, are you crazy?
Are you out of your mind?

758
00:33:33,316 --> 00:33:34,544
Get out of here.

759
00:33:34,584 --> 00:33:36,415
Come on.

760
00:33:38,088 --> 00:33:40,283
Stop playing. Stop playing.

761
00:33:40,323 --> 00:33:42,517
- Would y'all calm down?
- Hey, give me that.

762
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:44,322
- No.
- Don't make me come back there.

763
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:46,021
It's mine.
It's mine.

764
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:57,563
Oh, fuck you, Larry.
Bullshit, motherfucker.

765
00:33:57,605 --> 00:33:59,698
- I didn't know.
- You are such a bald asshole!

766
00:33:59,741 --> 00:34:02,676
- I can't begin to tell you.
- Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

767
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,177
Don't nobody talk
to my man like that.

768
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:06,202
You'd better get your ass
out of my house,

769
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:08,806
- you fucking bitch.
- Goodbye.

770
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,316
Get your smile on.
Get your smile on.

771
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,817
Get your smile on,
come on.

772
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:13,819
Am I smiling?
Here we go.
