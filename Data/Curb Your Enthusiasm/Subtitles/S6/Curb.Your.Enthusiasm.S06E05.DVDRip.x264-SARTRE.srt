1
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,946
Oh!

2
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:21,385
Oh my God!

3
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,720
- Are you ready to go?
- Oh, God, look at this.

4
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,783
Look at that.

5
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,420
- What is this?
- It's a book about freaks.

6
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,362
- Is this Ted's gift?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,332
- That's what you're giving him?
- Yeah.

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,994
- Okay, yeah.
- It's unbelievable.

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,597
Hey, guess what. It's all finalized-
the cemetery plots.

10
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,403
We got 'em, so now Ted and Mary
are gonna be next to us

11
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:44,069
- and Jeff and Susie.
- Hey, you like her?

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,236
I see that.

13
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:47,109
I think we really overpaid
for those plots.

14
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,775
It's too late,
and it's a beautiful site.

15
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:52,307
Hold on. This has
to be the car service.

16
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,843
- Hi, good evening, Miss David?
- Yes.

17
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,879
- Your car's here.
- Thank you. We'll be right out.

18
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,517
- We'll be right out. Thank you so much.
- Okay.

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,427
- Oh, oh, Jeez! Oh, Jeez!
- Larry, our car's here.

20
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,693
- Okay.
- This isn't for you, actually.

21
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,098
Look at the size
of this guy.

22
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:09,601
Let's put it away.
We're going to a party.

23
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:12,264
We have a car. We can drink.
We can have margaritas.

24
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,398
We can hang out,
be normal.

25
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:17,103
Great idea, the car service,
great idea.

26
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,316
Okay, so we'll just call
you in a few hours or so.

27
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,320
Good. We'll see you in a while.
Have a great night, folks.

28
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,152
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna be here.

29
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,991
- Got something to read?
- No no no, I'll be fine. Take care.

30
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,792
All right.

31
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,696
No book? No paper?

32
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,292
- Nothing? A puzzle, huh?
- No, I...

33
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:45,202
You folks have a great night,
though. Have a great party.

34
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:47,399
I don't have to worry about you
in there? You'll be okay?

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,408
- I'm great.
- Okay, fine.

36
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,639
I'll be right here when you get out
and have a great party.

37
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,078
- Okay.
- Thank you.

38
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,582
I couldn't be alone with myself
for 15 minutes.

39
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,981
My brains would melt.

40
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:00,679
He's gonna sit here for three hours
and not gonna read.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,156
No radio or nothing.
No distractions.

42
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,253
Big news: the cemetery plots
came through.

43
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,458
So it's Jeff and Susie and you
and Cheryl and me and Ted

44
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,330
buried next to each other forever.
Oh my God.

45
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:15,629
Yeah, right.
Isn't that something?

46
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:17,363
- Yeah.
- That's really something.

47
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,371
- Yeah, I don't want- not too soon.
- Yeah, no.

48
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:22,374
It's true. When you start
to think about it,

49
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,569
somebody's gotta
go first, I guess.

50
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,206
Well, it's not gonna be me and probably
not Ted. We're very healthy.

51
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,079
- Really?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:32,311
- Nice party, huh?
- This is very nice.

53
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,048
- I don't recognize most of these people.
- Really?

54
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,715
You know the Rizmans.

55
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,691
Yeah yeah, I'm not
that crazy about them,

56
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:40,988
frankly, you know.

57
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,188
You don't like
Arnie Rizman?

58
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,925
Just 'cause the person's bald
doesn't mean I have to like them.

59
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,866
Okay, forget it. I'm sure there's
someone here that you like.

60
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,870
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- Okay, enjoy yourself.

61
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,030
All right, okay.

62
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,508
- Good evening.
- Good evening to you.

63
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,773
- How you doing?
- I am doing...

64
00:02:58,811 --> 00:03:01,211
pretty good.

65
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,442
Pretty, pretty good.

66
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,577
- What can I get you?
- You got a little bow tie there, huh?

67
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,143
Got a little bow tie.

68
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,282
That's your idea?

69
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,918
No. No, it's not.

70
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,123
You know, we're asked
to wear it sometimes.

71
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,064
- What do you mean sometimes?
- Well, we're given a work-order form

72
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,933
with a special request,
and in this case, there was a request

73
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,097
from Mr. Danson
to wear the bow tie.

74
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,506
- You're kidding.
- No.

75
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,308
Ted Danson specifically requested
that you wear a bow tie?

76
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,938
Are you joking?

77
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,471
To distinguish,
I believe,

78
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:40,475
between the guests
and the staff.

79
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,284
Well, looks like I'm gonna have
to have a little talk

80
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,757
with Mr. Danson.

81
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,521
No no no no,
that's totally...

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,357
That's okay.
Don't worry about it.

83
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,987
- I wanna say a little something to him.
- Please, please don't.

84
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,827
- I feel like I have to.
- You don't. You don't.

85
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,856
- Honestly, it's-
- I do. I really do. This is wrong.

86
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,766
- It's just wrong.
- It's unnecessary.

87
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,636
We're asked sometimes.
It's fine. It's part of the job.

88
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,071
Listen, I'm doing this
for you.

89
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:03,632
Well, if you're doing
it for me, then don't.

90
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,076
- Please.
- Okay, I'm doing it for me.

91
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:07,670
Also, please
don't then.

92
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:10,205
You don't understand
how I operate, okay?

93
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,684
- Maybe not, but-
- I will not get you in trouble.

94
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,812
I'll talk to him.
Everything will be fine.

95
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,483
It would probably implicate me
in some way, and it's not that important.

96
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:20,116
- What's your name?
- Jamie.

97
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,490
- Jamie, okay.
- Yeah.

98
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:23,722
- Jamie, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

99
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,890
I'm gonna go say a little something
to Mr. Danson.

100
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,297
Please don't...

101
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,597
In a few minutes, you're not gonna
be wearing a bow tie.

102
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,002
I don't mind wearing it that much.
I'd rather you don't.

103
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:34,871
You're gonna say, "Larry, thank you
for getting rid of my bow tie."

104
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,967
I thank you, Larry, to not say
anything to Mr. Danson.

105
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,572
Jamie, I gotta
say something.

106
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,639
You don't.

107
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,311
- I have to. I couldn't live with myself.
- You don't have to.

108
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,479
Just trust me.
I know how to talk to people.

109
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,115
- I do trust you, but please don't.
- That's gotta go.

110
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,556
- That's gotta go, Jamie.
- It doesn't have to.

111
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,050
- Please, please.
- Nah-ah-ah.

112
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,498
- Hey, happy birthday!
- Hey.

113
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,626
Yeah, yeah, I'd hug you,
but I know you got a phobia.

114
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,729
Yeah, we don't need
to go that far, you know?

115
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,933
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah.

116
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,236
Why'd you make
this poor kid

117
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:12,540
- wear a bow tie? Bartender?
- Oh!

118
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,546
Got him in a bow tie?
What's up with that?

119
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,606
We had a choice. No bow tie, bow tie.
We went with bow tie.

120
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,551
- Classes up the party a little bit, I think.
- Really?

121
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,316
Makes me a little uncomfortable
seeing a guy like that,

122
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,517
Have to stand there,
wear a bow tie the whole night.

123
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,924
- That's not cool.
- It looks elegant.

124
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,622
Feel like you're putting on airs
or something, you know?

125
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,790
- I'm putting on airs?
- A little bit, yeah.

126
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,800
You know, what is it?
So you feel good?

127
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,802
He's gotta feel bad
so you can feel good?

128
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,497
Is that how the world
works for you?

129
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,006
- Did he say something to you?
- No, he didn't.

130
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,507
- He did, didn't he?
- No, he did not.

131
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:45,238
- What did he say?
- He didn't say anything.

132
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,644
- Bullshit.
- He said he'd rather I wouldn't talk to you,

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,045
that's what
He said, but...

134
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,549
- Can't take the bow tie off?
- No.

135
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,881
- That's your final answer?
- That's my final answer.

136
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,887
- Final answer?
- Yeah, no deal.

137
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,650
Pfft! Whatever
you want, you know?

138
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,714
- Come on, Larry, please.
- Okay, all right.

139
00:05:58,758 --> 00:06:01,659
I feel like a jerk
'cause I kind of promised him.

140
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,629
Well, too bad.
Go back and say you failed.

141
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,792
Okay, I will.
One more thing:

142
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,768
I got a driver
out there.

143
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,827
I was wondering if I could
bring him in the house.

144
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,398
He's sitting out there.
He'll be out there for three hours.

145
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,409
Do you mind
if I bring him in?

146
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,741
Why don't we just send
some coffee out to him?

147
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,475
Send coffee out to him?
Come on, what is that?

148
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,348
Let me bring him in. He'll sit in a corner.
He won't bother anybody.

149
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,751
It's his job to sit in the car
and wait while you have fun.

150
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,778
I know it's his job,
but listen, I used to drive.

151
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,949
I know how it feels to sit
in a car for three hours

152
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,392
and do nothing and freeze
and not be able to put the radio on

153
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:38,192
or the lights. You can't read.
There's nothing you can do.

154
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,358
- You drove limos?
- Yeah, I did drive limos.

155
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,992
- Really?
- Yeah.

156
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:44,093
- Did you wear a little bow tie?
- No, I did not.

157
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,105
The woman was blind
and couldn't see.

158
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,936
- Really?
- Yeah.

159
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,942
I didn't even
wear the uniform.

160
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:51,773
- Really?
- Yeah, she couldn't see a thing.

161
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:54,075
The car was filthy, but anyway,
that's another story.

162
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:56,673
Bring him in. I don't care.

233
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,253
- Are you crazy? You're not driving.
- I'm not that drunk.

234
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,721
- What are you doing?
- Hey, I know.

235
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:25,417
I'm just joking around.
But seriously,

236
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,948

I'm driving.

237
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,018
No, you're not.
You can't drive. You're drunk.

238
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,529
You are not gonna drive us home.
Nobody in their right mind

239
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,192
- would get in a car with you right now.
- Come on, get in the car.

240
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,201
- You'll stay right over here.
- Okay okay okay.

241
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,862
Don't forget me, bud.

242
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,871
- Do you know how to drive a limo?
- I don't know.

243
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,135

244
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,199

245
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:45,801

248
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,591
Oh, man.

249
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:08,657
Oh, my goodness.

250
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,163
There she is.

251
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,176
Come on, step,
step, come on.

252
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,169
Honey, honey...!

253
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,739
- Nobody's home. Stay out.
- Come on, baby.

254
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,582
No, not again.
God damn you!

255
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,144
Huh-uh, huh-uh.
Who are you?

256
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,782
Get off! Get off!

257
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,019
Don't you dare get on that couch.
Hey, what are you doing?

258
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,085
Huh? You party
with this fuckface?

259
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,323
No, we weren't partying.

260
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,195
No, he was driving us.

261
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,429
And he had too much to drink,
so we thought...

262
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,868
You!

263
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,465
Get your stinky,
nasty feet off my couch.

264
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:51,601
Who's there? Is that the goddamn
neighbors with their fucking dog?

265
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,738
- No, Dad, go to bed!
- Who's there?

266
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,248
This is the shitstorm
of my life. It's shit.

267
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,581
Yeah, it doesn't
look that great.

268
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,382
No, it isn't.
Aren't you pretty?

269
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:04,116
- Don't you look nice?
- You're pretty.

270
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,680
- You're pretty.
- Very attractive.

271
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,353
- Tell 'em to stop playing the music.
- Shut up!

272
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,022
We have no way
to get home tonight because...

273
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,621
No, clearly
He can't drive.

274
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:15,395
I would offer you the upstairs room,
but my dad is a fucking mess.

275
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:16,628
Can we take
the limo home?

276
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,330
I'll bring it back
tomorrow. I promise.

277
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,997
You gotta
bring it back, man.

278
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,904
I don't need you to talk!

279
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,307
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry I couldn't invite you for a snack.

280
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,573
But you know what?
There's nothing in the cupboard.

281
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:29,479
- I don't want that dog shitting in my yard!
- Daddy, so help me!

282
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,174
This is gonna be so fun.

283
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,187
I'm so looking forward
to this concert.

284
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:37,018
OH, my gosh,
you're wearing a suit.

285
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:38,785
This is like
a real date.

286
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,486
Gonna go to dinner and go
to a concert and hang out.

287
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,586
Oh my God.
You know what I heard?

288
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:45,824
I heard that Heather Mills
and Paul McCartney

289
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,833
might be getting
back together.

290
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,858
- Oh, how exciting.
- Can you believe that?

291
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,632
- I'm all atwitter.
- She might even be there tonight.

292
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,697
- Really?
- Yeah. See Heather Mills.

293
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,971
You know,
I gotta tell ya,

294
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,808
- I'm thinking about this Ted Danson thing.
- Yeah.

295
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,474
I don't think I wanna be buried
next to this guy.

296
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,348
That's how I feel.

297
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,785
So I was thinking
maybe...

298
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,450
maybe you'll switch plots with me,
so you'll be between us.

299
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,550
I don't care.

300
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,686
But you know that means that
you'll be next to Susie.

301
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:19,197
So you're gonna need
her permission.

302
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,324
I don't care what you do.

303
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:23,767
Oh, hey, that's them.

304
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,668
Oh, I'll get it.

305
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,434
Hey!

306
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,772
- Paul McCartney, baby, yeah!
- Paul McCartney!

307
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,177
Hey, guys. Hey, you look great.
Oh, look, a suit too.

308
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:36,909
- I know. Isn't that nice?
- Yeah, you do look good.

309
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,712
- I love this outfit.
- You do?

310
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,276
Oh, yeah, it's great- the pink.
I love this stuff.

311
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,151
Wow, glad you like it.

312
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,419
- Really nice, yeah.
- It's a rock star thing.

313
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,255
- Great combo. Yeah, looks terrific.
- Glad you like it.

314
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,354
- You want some wine, cheese?
- I'd love some wine. That'd be great.

315
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,729
Where's the freak book?

316
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,064
- Left it in the car.
- Oh, man, all right.

317
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,466
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

318
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,097
How about a toast?
To good friends, good friendship.

319
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:03,939
- Nice, very nice, very nice.
- To friendship?

320
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,001
You know, you weren't
there last night.

321
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,309
- No, I heard.
- Ted Danson,

322
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,974
I have had it
with this guy.

323
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,848
- He's a little pompous lately, I notice.
- So full of himself.

324
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:16,252
Let me just say this, okay?
I don't wanna be buried next to this guy.

325
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,017
I really don't.
I've been thinking about it.

326
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,615
I was talking to Cheryl,
and I asked Cheryl

327
00:14:19,658 --> 00:14:21,888
if she'd switch plots
with me, and she agreed.

328
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,521
- So now I'll be buried next to you.
- Next to me?

329
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:26,326
Yeah, next to you,
so that's that.

330
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,198
I don't really like that, Lar.
I don't like that.

331
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,260
- Why not?
- Because I liked it the way it was.

332
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,134
What's the big deal?

333
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,504
Because, Larry, honestly, I don't
wanna be next to you for eternity.

334
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,008
May I be so bold?

335
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,203
Your best self emerges
after you're dead.

336
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,736
- You don't know that for a fact.
- I do know. I came back.

337
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,443
Guess what. Even your best self,
I'm not interested for eternity.

338
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,087
I take back my toast.

339
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,385
- Good friends?
- Fine, take back your toast.

340
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,823
I take back the toast, and I take back
what I said about your outfit.

341
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:56,327
Well, you only said it
'cause you had this in mind

342
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,523
to get me to switch plots.
There's always an ulterior motive.

343
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,555
If you were married to me, I never would
have let you out of the house with that.

344
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,998
That's fine.
I'm not married to you.

345
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,468
And I'm not gonna be next to you
forever and ever and ever.

346
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,266
- I want some peace and quiet.
- Okay, fine.

347
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,297
How about this?
I'll switch with Cheryl,

348
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,309
but then you switch
with Jeff.

349
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,504
- I can't do that. I need to be on the end.
- That's true.

350
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,742
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't be anywhere but the end.

351
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,750
He hyperventilates.
he has to be on the end.

352
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,412
- Yeah, it's not good.
- I'll tell you what's not good, okay?

353
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,614
The selfishness
that's going on here.

354
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,750
No, I wanna be next to my goddamn
husband for eternity, not Ted Danson.

355
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,419
That's the way we lay there.

356
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,451
- I made a vow to him, Larry.
- Okay, fine, we're leaving.

357
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,158
We're leaving this cemetery.
We're getting another plot.

358
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,996
- No, we're not. No, we are not.
- Yes, we are! Yes, we are!

359
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:37,866
Nobody's switching?
Is that what you're saying to me?

360
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,632
We should keep it
the way it is.

361
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:43,108
You're gonna keep it the way it is?
Fine, fine. Enjoy your evening, okay?

362
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:46,043
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going. I'm going.

363
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:48,046
You don't wanna be buried
next to me when you're dead,

364
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,514
I can assume you don't wanna be
next to me when you're alive.

365
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:52,813
I'll see you
at the concert.

366
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,718
- He's a drama queen. He's overreacting.
- I don't know.

367
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,188
Like a little girl. What was
that? That was nothing.

368
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,248
- Where's the car?
- Leon took it.

369
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,591
He didn't ask me.

370
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,859
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking the limo.

371
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,832
- Limo?
- He's out of his mind.

372
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,857
He's driving a limo?

373
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,508
Oh! Oh, fuck!

374
00:16:53,078 --> 00:16:56,707
- Hello.
- Larry, hey, it's Charlie, the limo driver.

375
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,580
- Hello, Charlie.
- I'm sorry about last night.

376
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,517
Yeah, boy oh boy,
you should be.

377
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:02,213
You shouldn't have had
to go through that.

378
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,653
Yeah, that was pretty bad.

379
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,817
I didn't mean to get that drunk.
I just got out of hand.

380
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,851
I did you a favor. I let you in the house.
It was pretty awful.

381
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:12,864
I'm so- I'm so-
oh, God, I'm so sorry.

382
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,196
Guess what. I'm in the limo right now.
Do you want me to return it?

383
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:17,259
Look, man,
you gotta do me a huge favor.

384
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,270
I gotta pick somebody up
in 30 minutes at the airport.

385
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,899
He's this huge VIP client,
and I can't get there, man.

386
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:24,499
They just called
and I can't get over there.

387
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,410
- What are you, kidding me?
- No, please, seriously.

388
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:29,539
I'm not gonna go pick
somebody up at the airport.

389
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,674
If I don't get this,
I lose my job, man.

390
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,548
And my wife is
gonna lose her health care.

391
00:17:33,585 --> 00:17:35,917
We're gonna lose everything, man.
The house goes too.

392
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,819
I can't pick somebody up
at the airport.

393
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,689
- Are you insane?
- Larry, do me a favor. Come on, man.

394
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,956
- Oh, Jesus.
- Please, Larry,

395
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,622
For God's sake-
for my family.

396
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:47,359
Oh...

397
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,765
- All right, fine, fine.
- Thanks. Oh, God, thanks.

398
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,238
Go to the airport for you.
This is really unbelievable, Charlie.

399
00:17:53,272 --> 00:17:54,864
Go just go to the airport.
Get to the terminal,

400
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,501
and you're Charlie
the limo driver, man.

401
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:00,706
Just pick up John McEnroe.
Take him wherever he wants to go, okay?

402
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,509
John McEnroe?

403
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,573
Yeah, John McEnroe.
Take him wherever he wants to go, okay?

404
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,607
He's the tennis guy.
As far as he knows,

405
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,210
you're Charlie the limo driver, man.
That's it.

406
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,517
- Stand there.
- I'm Charlie, cool.

407
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:13,286
- You're the man.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. McEnroe.

408
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,421
I'm Charlie.
Hey, Mr. McEnroe, hiya.

409
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,896
How you doing?
I'm Charlie.

410
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,526
All right, hey.
Okay, I got it.

411
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,559
Give me all the info.

412
00:18:38,016 --> 00:18:40,246
Ah!

413
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,617
Okay.

414
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,144
- Let me get that.
- Yeah, thanks.

415
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:46,248
I got it.

416
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,158
- Okay, give me this, please.
- Thank you.

417
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:51,890
All right, Charlie.

418
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,660
- Charlie, John McEnroe.
- John McEnroe, nice to meet you.

419
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,361
- Pleasure.
- Thanks.

420
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:58,460
- Where you heading?
- Going to the Staples Center

421
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,165
- for the McCartney concert.
- Oh, no kidding.

422
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,399
- Yeah.
- Good.

423
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,374
- How was the flight?
- It was all right.

424
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,273
It was all right.

425
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,539
How you doing,
Mr. McEnroe?

426
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,051
Good. Good, thanks.

427
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,055
You let old Charlie know
whatever you need.

428
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,284
- Charlie's your guy.
- All right, Charlie.

429
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,451
- Thanks.
- Charlie is your man. Don't be shy.

430
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,894
Charlie, listen.
Little tired right now, okay? Thanks.

431
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,831
Hey, let me ask you something.
Were you shy as a child?

432
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,959
- Were you shy?
- Yeah yeah, I was actually.

433
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,731
Like, I was shy
when I was a kid.

434
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,398
People always saying,
"Don't be shy. Don't be shy."

435
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,407
What, do you think
you have control of being shy?

436
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,500
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

437
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,911
Ever play ping pong? Ping pong's
my game. I'll tell you something:

438
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,313
I think it's a lot harder than tennis,
with all due respect.

439
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,579
I'm gonna have to respectfully
disagree with that, Charlie.

440
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,213
What do you do for fun?
How does a John McEnroe have fun?

441
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,656
I like to be quiet now,
believe it or not.

442
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,422
- You watch a lot of TV?
- Lot of sports.

443
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,486
- You have allergies?
- No allergies.

444
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,294
Do you believe in God,
a God of some kind?

445
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,164
Yeah, I believe
in a God,

446
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,829
and I'm wondering
where he is right now.

447
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,839
- You like life?
- Yeah, I like life!

448
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,603
- Do you garden?
- I don't garden, okay?

449
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,805
If you talk to people who garden,
they'll all tell you the same thing:

450
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:16,370
they find it very relaxing
and meditative.

451
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,043
And it looks like it. I admit it.
I'm jealous of the gardener.

452
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,951
- Have you ever been jealous of a gardener?
- No, I haven't, actually.

453
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,579
- Are you married?
- Yeah, I'm married!

454
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,615
I have sex once a week.
How about you?

455
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,651
- Is that too personal?
- Yeah, that's too personal, okay?

456
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,323
What's the big deal
to talk about that?

457
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,559
I don't understand it.
I have sex once a week...

458
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,727
good week, twice.
But I can go more than one week.

459
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,134
Hey, that's really
interesting, okay, Charlie?

460
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,196
Oh my God.
Hey, I need to make a stop

461
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,232
for two minutes- would that be
okay- at this cemetery?

462
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,574
- In this cemetery?
- Yeah, it's right here. I can't believe it.

463
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,172
I just need to make a stop just
for a couple of minutes.

464
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:53,913
- All right, whatever.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

465
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:56,978
- I appreciate that. You're a good man.
- Yeah yeah.

466
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,851
Hey, Charlie,
How long is this gonna take?

467
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,659
I'll just be two minutes.
here, check out this freak book.

468
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,598
- It's a riot.
- All right, fine.

469
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,602
- Great. Looks wonderful.
- It's a lot of fun.

470
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,730
Check out the freaks,
Mr. McEnroe.

471
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:23,169
It's not what you had. What you had
was the best we have to offer.

472
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,410
It was absolutely
spectacular.

473
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,419
Yeah, well,
I'm done with that one.

474
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,444
However,
this is not bad.

475
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,787
You have a nice class
of people here

476
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:35,657
and a nice view.

477
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,184
It's quiet.

478
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:40,198
Can I get a refund
on the other plot?

479
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:42,063
No, I can't do that,

480
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,728
but you can sell it
privately if you like.

481
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,330
Okay, that's fair.
Okay.

482
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,241
I'll take it.

483
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,353
What the fuck?

484
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,383
Charlie!

485
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,485
What?
This is not your limo.

486
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,354
No no no no no,

487
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,054
this is not your limo.
This is somebody else's limo.

488
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:45,859
I pay you. I do whatever.
Just take my sister home.

489
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,661
- Give him the money.
- Look, the guy's coming.

490
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,067
My sister will...
I know. I know.

491
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:55,369
The guy's coming.
You have to get out of the car!

492
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:57,375
- Charlie, what the hell?
- Close the door.

493
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,207
Just get out.
Close the door.

494
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,940
They think it's their car.
I don't know.

495
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,504
- Get in, get in.
- What is this?

496
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,607
Why is he coming in?
Why are you...

497
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,084
- It's his car.
- What are you coming in for?

498
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,520
- We need to go home.
- Where do you live?

499
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,490
- What the fuck is-
- 22509th Street.

500
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,153
I don't care where they live.
Let's get 'em out of here.

501
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,857
You know what? That's not that far
from the Staples Center.

502
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,992
- Yeah, right. Okay, great.
- Thank you so much.

503
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,686
Now we are
nowhere near this place.

504
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,953
We are nowhere near-
I don't know where this place is.

505
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,653
I can't find this place.

506
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,820
- What?
- You have to just make a left turn.

507
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,295
No, this isn't close.

508
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:55,561
You said 8th Street, right?
This is not 8th Street.

509
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,192
Charlie, I didn't pay
for this. Come on!

510
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:59,703
All you have to do
is make a left turn.

511
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:03,538
You told me to go this way.
I went completely the wrong way.

512
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,237
- You're supposed to be a driver.
- It's the other way, I think.

513
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,576
Okay, you just said the word,
"I think. " Don't think.

514
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,376
Just follow
my instructions!

515
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:12,508
I'm telling you,
make a left turn!

516
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,749
Don't make this worse
than it already is.

517
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,018
Just make a left turn
and take us home!

518
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,184
This is all we need
to do because my sister...

519
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,387
That's it.
That's it!

520
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,158
That's it.
I can't take this anymore!

521
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,632
Charlie, pull the car over.
That's it!

522
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,635
Pull the car over,
God damn it!

523
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,105
I gotta get to the concert.
I don't care about your fucking father.

524
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,835
Pull over! I don't care
about him, okay?

525
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,038
Charlie, get me to the show.
Jesus Christ!

526
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:42,410
Come on, quick.
Get out of here.

527
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,244
What are you doing?

528
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,382
Yeah, fuck you, too, all right?
Yeah, kiss my-!

529
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,727
- God, we made it, Charlie?
- We made it.

530
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,323
- Yeah!
- We made it, Mac!

531
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,733
Hey, and this book-
I gotta tell you, this book is great.

532
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:07,636
- Are you loving that freak book, huh?
- This freak book is sick.

533
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,300
You see, you were worried.
I told you I'd get you here on time.

534
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,505
I knew I was gonna make the show on time,
but just worried about this pre-party.

535
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,275
- I got this pass to this party. It's awesome.
- Really?

536
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,804
Got any extra tickets?

537
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,646
What do you mean?
You're a driver, man.

538
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,346
Hey, if the situation
were reversed, I'd let you go.

539
00:25:22,387 --> 00:25:24,548
All right, fine.
Fine, all right.

540
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,056
You know what?
We'll bring the freak book.

541
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:28,457
What do you think?

542
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:32,361
Hey, Charlie,
get me another beer.

543
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:35,696
- Charlie, come here. You gotta see this.
- Mmm.

544
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,259
I'm shitfaced.
We're gonna need a driver.

545
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:41,238
Charlie, thanks.
I gotta tell you,

546
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,299
this is awesome.
Thank you for this book, man.

547
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,776
- No no no, let me hold it.
- You've been holding it the whole time.

548
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,836
- I like it.
- We'll split it. We'll share it.

549
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,472
- All right, fine fine.
- Okay.

550
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,380
- Three legs!
- Where?

551
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:54,908
- There!
- No no!

552
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,978
- Three legs! What is that?
- Pig nose.

553
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,149
- It's a pig. It's a human pig!
- Pig nose!

554
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,953
Oh, God!

555
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,584
- What a freak!
- Oh my God,

556
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,857
- what a freak!
- It's heather.

557
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,059
Who you calling a freak,
you bald fuck?

558
00:26:13,104 --> 00:26:14,731
Why would I call
Heather Mills a freak?

559
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:16,206
We weren't talking
about her!

560
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,402
I was talking about the book.
There's freaks in here.

561
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,536
See? Look. Four tits.
You see the four tits?

562
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,479
That's a freak.
That's what I'm talking about.

563
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,278
- Please, one more chance.
- I was only talking about the book.

564
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,945
- Why would I do that?
- This is all your fault!

565
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,749
Why'd you bring
that fucking book?

566
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:32,382
- You yelled, "What a freak."
- You yelled, "What a freak," too!

567
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,358
You yelled it first.
I was just following you!

568
00:26:34,392 --> 00:26:36,223
God damn it! We're gonna
miss the show now!

569
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,422
- That's not my fault.
- Bullshit! It is your fault.

570
00:26:38,463 --> 00:26:41,091
- No, it isn't.
- Damn it, you're an asshole, you know?

571
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:42,997
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

572
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,934
- No, fuck you!
- Fuck you!

573
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,666
- Go get the fucking car.
- Get a ride home. How about that?

574
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,748
- Hey, Lar.
- Hey.

575
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,588
- Returning the car.
- Yeah, thanks.

576
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,618
What's... what's...

577
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,530
- Her dad died yesterday.
- Oh, jeez.

578
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,193
If it's
the neighbor again,

579
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,828
say I'm sorry
I'm crying.

580
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:21,134
I'm sorry to hear
about your father.

581
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:25,074
So sudden, and he didn't
wanna go, man. He fought it.

582
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,840
He fought it like a trouper,
that old asshole.

583
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:30,746
What are we gonna do?
I can't afford a funeral.

584
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:33,808
I can't afford anything.
Where we gonna bury him?

585
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,854
I think
I can help you out.
