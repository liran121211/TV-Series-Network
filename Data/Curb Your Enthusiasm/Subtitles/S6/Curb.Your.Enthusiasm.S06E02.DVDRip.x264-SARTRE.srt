1
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:16,271
- Okay, fine.
- Let's go.

2
00:00:16,316 --> 00:00:18,147
- Can I take a break?
- No!

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,845
- Why?
- Let's push through this.

4
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,354
Work it, come on, yeah,
so we can get this done.

5
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,983
This house feels
like a hotel to me.

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,084
- Hotel, really?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,960
She's right about that.
It's not as nice as the other house.

8
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:33,591
I agree with you.
It's not as nice.

9
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:37,501
Hi, Ted. I know.
No no, we're here.

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:40,005
We're in the middle
of it right now.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,668
I know.
Can you believe it?

12
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,177
- You hear this?
- Hmm?

13
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,237
- She's talking to Ted Danson.
- That was a guy?

14
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,249
- Yeah.
- I thought it was a girl.

15
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:53,047
- No, they have little chats on the phone.
- No, they don't.

16
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,451
- They do all day long.
- Really?

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,547
Yeah, I'm telling you,
it's unbelievable.

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,457
And when they're together,
she goes like this. She gives him a slap.

19
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,393
- Touching like that?
- Yeah, like a playful slap.

20
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,761
- Oh, the flirtatious slap.
- The flirtatious tap.

21
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,265
- Really?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,530
- That's like sex for platonic friends.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,366
Because they can't touch
each other, it's forbidden.

24
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,599
So they're allowed
to go like that.

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,666
I'm done
helping you move.

26
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,678
- Hey, thanks so much. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

27
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:22,476
- Are you going to the NRDC opening?
- Yeah yeah, of course.

28
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:23,914
You know, they're naming
a wing after me.

29
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,384
- Naming a wing?
- Yeah, I gave 'em a ton of money.

30
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,217
- Well, good for you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

31
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:32,053
- Larry, Larry David?
- Yeah.

32
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,287
Where's Loretta?
Loretta!

33
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,818
Peanut, Peanut, boy!

34
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:40,132
Look at you, boy.
Baby girl!

35
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,192
Oh my God,
you all living large.

36
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,397
- What's up, sister?
- Boy, what you doing here?

37
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,269
What you doing here?

38
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,468
Uh-oh, I knew I smelled
some cooking.

39
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:52,410
Do I smell food?
Come here, Auntie.

40
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,749
- Who is this guy?
- That's my brother Leon.

41
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,242
What's up, girl?

42
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:03,050
Which room
he gonna stay in?

43
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:05,114
- What?
- Which room he gonna stay in?

44
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:07,388
- You can stay in my room, Uncle Leon.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

45
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,895
- Let me get my bag.
- Show him where the room is at.

46
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,988
All right.

47
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,727
Come on, boy!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

48
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:17,964
- Was he in the hurricane?
- No, he lives here in L.A.

49
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,939
Cheryl!

50
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,214
Boy, I don't know.

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,844
I wonder if cooking
good is hereditary.

52
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,319
You know what I mean?

53
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:36,788
Yeah, see, Loretta put
her foot in it this time.

54
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,950
Loretta put her foot in it,
turned it around,

55
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,223
and kicked you in your own asshole.
You feel me?

56
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:44,253
Watch your mouth
in front of the children.

57
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:47,266
Looks good, don't it,
don't it?

58
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,098
Man, oh, man, what are you trying
to do to your family with this food?

59
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,627
- You're gonna kill 'em.
- What you talking about, L.D.?

60
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,970
Come on, all that cholesterol.
It's no good for you.

61
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,841
Larry, can I talk
to you for a second?

62
00:02:57,877 --> 00:03:01,608
Really think about getting rid
of all the bacon

63
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:03,616
and the sausage
and everyuhing.

64
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,117
I'm gonna think
about eating it.

65
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,148
You crazy, girl!

66
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,260
I'm a little creeped out
right now.

67
00:03:14,294 --> 00:03:17,923
Okay, I was just in Leon's room
putting some flowers in there.

68
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,229
- Leon's room?
- Yeah, and there's a...

69
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,725
There's a stain
on the blanket.

70
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:28,730
- What kind of stain? What do you mean?
- Like when a guy...

71
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:31,141
You know, and does his business,
and he's alone.

72
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,936
It's so gross.

73
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,642
- Are you kidding?
- No.

74
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:39,083
Hey, everybody in the family
have them big ones.

75
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:42,417
- First night in our house?
- I know.

76
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,822
Okay,
I'm gonna talk to him.

77
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,122
- No, oh, God.
- What, are you kidding?

78
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:51,289
I don't want to some guy staying
here masturbating all over the place.

79
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,730
You can't talk
to him about it.

80
00:03:52,765 --> 00:03:55,325
- Leon.
- Larry.

81
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:56,926
Can I talk
to you for a second?

82
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,165
Excuse me, ladies.
I shall return.

83
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:02,436
Oh my God. I gotta
get something over to...

84
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,966
All right.
Man, I'm about to bust.

85
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:08,276
- Enjoyed your breakfast?
- Larry, you know how to bring it.

86
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,407
- That's nice.
- I'm about to blow up.

87
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,941
- I just spoke to my wife.
- Okay.

88
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,581
And she said she was putting
some flowers in your room.

89
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:21,720
And she found a stain...

90
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,989
on your blanket.

91
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,554
Stain on my blanket, huh?

92
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,463
What, like juice,

93
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,468
Syrup, maybe syrup
or something like that?

94
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,766
Huh-uh, no.

95
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:34,329
Gravies maybe, something
in the gravy category?

96
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,274
Huh-uh, no.

97
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,174
What kind of stain
was it?

98
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,412
- Hmm?
- Ejaculate.

99
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,177
E- what?

100
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,582
Ejaculate.

101
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,108
Ajackalit.

102
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,883
Not ajackalit.
Ejaculate.

103
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,686
Ejaculate?

104
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,589
Cum stain. Cum.

105
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,655
Cum stain.

106
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,190
What kind of cum was it,
first of all?

107
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,930
What do you mean,
what kind of cum? Cum's cum.

108
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,438
- Cum is not cum, Larry.
- Cum's cum.

109
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,134
It couldn't have been mine.
Know why? 'cause I gets mine, Larry.

110
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,143
I brings the ruckus
to the ladies.

111
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,645
Okay, so you're denying this.
Is that it?

112
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,671
First of all, look around
this place, man.

113
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:18,149
Are there any visuals
around here to jack off to?

114
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,913
All we have
is basic cable, right?

115
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,977
What am I doing, jacking off
to "Andy Griffith"?

116
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,750
Jacking off to Clara, huh?

117
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,190
- You mean Aunt Bea?
- Aunt Bea, Clara, whoever.

118
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,887
- Who's Clara?
- Who's the lady who answer the phone?

119
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,419
- I don't know.
- Is that her name, Clara?

120
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,091
I don't know Clara.
I know Aunt Bea.

121
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,997
Nobody wanna jack off
to no damn Aunt Bea.

122
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:36,968
I don't remember any beauties
on that show, frankly.

123
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,561
It's not my cum, Larry.

124
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,903
- Okay?
- Okay.

125
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:47,743
So, yeah, just get
the blanket clean.

126
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,112
- This is it?
- That's all, yeah.

127
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,879
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

128
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,443
You want me
to clean the blanket.

129
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,650
Yeah, so just throw it in the bin.
You don't need to...

130
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,784
I don't have a bin, Larry.
I have to look at it to see what kind

131
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:03,352
- of cleaning-
- You don't need to inspect it.

132
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,626
Larry, do you want me
to clean the blanket or not?

133
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,190
What are you doing?
You throw it in.

134
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,634
Oh...

135
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,264
Okay, I had nothing
to do with that.

136
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,208
Sure, Larry,
whatever you say.

137
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:19,837
No, somebody's staying at my house,
and I'm sure he did that.

138
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,144
Larry, I could give a shit if it was
Santa Claus. I'm just trying to get it off.

139
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:25,912
No, I'm just telling you, okay,
that I had nothing to do with that.

140
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,819
- That's not my stain. All right, fine.
- Okay okay.

141
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:32,991
You look very cute
when you're all blushy.

142
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:36,324
- You think I'm gonna tell? I'm your friend.
- I didn't do it.

143
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:38,990
I'm not gonna lie
about that.

144
00:06:39,031 --> 00:06:41,522
You're really insane,
you know?

145
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,728
Larry.

146
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't see
my Yankee jersey...

147
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:50,033
- by the way.
- Huh.

148
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,739
- See that?
- Wow, it must be gone then.

149
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,611
I'm sorry, Larry.

150
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:57,275
What?

151
00:06:57,316 --> 00:06:59,580
What? It happens, Larry.
That's what happens sometimes.

152
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,417
No no no, you don't understand.
That's Joe Pepitone's jersey.

153
00:07:02,455 --> 00:07:05,618
I've had that jersey
since I was a kid. Number 25.

154
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:09,116
It's gone. Somebody else must
have taken it.

155
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,995
Well, do you think
they'll return it?

156
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,864
Larry, in all the many years
I've worked here

157
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,335
at the dry cleaners,
no one ever returns anything.

158
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,204
Sometimes you get home
and you have something that isn't yours,

159
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,141
and sometimes something
of yours gets taken.

160
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,577
That's just the unwritten law
of dry cleaning.

161
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,273
Everyone knows that.

162
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,747
- Really?
- Really.

163
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,716
Well, I don't subscribe
to that law.

164
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,777
Oh, well, then maybe you
should change it.

165
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:37,619
- Maybe I will.
- Good.

166
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:40,217
I'll have your semen-covered
blanket ready

167
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:42,250
on Wednesday.

168
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,794
So I confronted him.
Of course he denied it,

169
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,862
but I mean, come on,
give me a break.

170
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,897
He was in the room.
I mean, who else could it be?

171
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,910
You gotta kick him out,
hands down.

172
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,741
First night
in the house.

173
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:02,077
Hey hey, I did it.

174
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,947
Come on,
no big deal.

175
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,384
You did it?

176
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,411
Yeah, did it,
yep, me.

177
00:08:10,756 --> 00:08:12,747
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, what's the big deal?

178
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,350
What's the big deal?

179
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,792
It was Passover
at your house.

180
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,160
I was drinking
a little bit,

181
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,664
had some manischewitz,
you know?

182
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,327
Feeling good, and I was away
from the table.

183
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,201
I got an erection.
I took care of it before I came back.

184
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:28,332
I didn't want to come back to the table
with an erection at Passover.

185
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,142
- Are you out of your mind?
- No, it's no big deal.

186
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,975
- Passover?
- It's not like Yom Kippur.

187
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,878
- I would never do it on the High Holidays.
- He wouldn't do it

188
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,473
- on a High Holiday.
- No, I wouldn't.

189
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,779
You're like a monkey.

190
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,809
- A monkey.
- You are.

191
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,151
- You didn't do a good job of cleaning up.
- I did the best I could.

192
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,555
- That's the best you could?
- I had to get back to the table.

193
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,116
They were doing the four questions
and I love the four questions.

194
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,253
Gotta get back.
It's very important.

195
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,025
- I love the four questions.
- This is unbelievable.

196
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:53,656
- No big deal.
- It is a big deal.

197
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,633
Come to my house and do it.
What do I give a shit?

198
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:57,158
Come on over and whack off.
Have a good time.

199
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:00,833
Oh, listen,

200
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,535
I left my sunglasses at your house.
I need 'em desperately.

201
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:06,602
- All right, I'll look for 'em.
- Don't let him in your house.

202
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:09,137
- Hi, guys.
- Hey!

203
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,149
- Look at you.
- No, look at you.

204
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,481
- You are Miss NRDC.
- Look at you!

205
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,488
- Well, thank you.
- You make me wanna save the planet.

206
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,717
- So, should we go in,
- Okay, let's go in.

207
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:20,692
See the new wing?

208
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,694
Call me, actually.
I have something to tell you.

209
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,697
- I've got something to tell you, too.
- Oh, saying hello?

210
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,928
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

211
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:35,004
Why are you and Ted always kind of
hitting each other all the time?

212
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:37,635
All this playful hitting?
All that stuff?

213
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,941
It's not a conscious thing.
I don't know.

214
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,970
I'm expressive
with my hands.

215
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,447
Hey...

216
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,917
- Larry David. That's great.
- Huh?

217
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,252
- Never had a wing before.
- I know.

218
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,258
That's pretty good.
Pretty good.

219
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,989
- It's your night to shine.
- Yeah yeah, it's great.

220
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:06,502
What is that?
"Wing Donated By Anonymous."

221
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,303
- Yeah, yeah.
- Anonymous?

222
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,373
I'm not crazy about that.
Now it looks like...

223
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,677
just looks like I did mine
for the credit

224
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,447
As opposed to, you know,
Mr. Wonderful "Anonymous."

225
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:23,649
I know who it is.

226
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,421
It's Ted.

227
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,984
Ted is Anonymous.

228
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:31,394
What are you, kidding?

229
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,024
No, isn't that great?

230
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:37,627
He donated a whole wing
and didn't want anybody to know.

231
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,037
Well, he told you, so he apparently
wanted somebody to know.

232
00:10:41,073 --> 00:10:43,268
He told me, okay?

233
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,641
Who else did he tell?
How do you know he just told you?

234
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,942
The point is that he didn't need
all the fanfare...

235
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,948
Fanfare? What fanfare?
I don't like the fanfare.

236
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,007
You're saying
I like fanfare?

237
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,611
He can tell a few people. He just doesn't
need the whole world to know

238
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,315
that he donated
all this money.

239
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:58,346
You know what? I didn't need
the world to know, either.

240
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,451
Nobody told me that I could be
anonymous and tell people.

241
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,826
I would have taken
that option, okay?

242
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:07,094
You can't have it halfway.
You're either anonymous or you're not.

243
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:09,328
- What is it?
- People are pointing out

244
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,563
- there's Larry David's wing.
- Oh, yeah, there's Larry David,

245
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:13,765
the guy who has to have his
name up on the wall,

246
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:15,706
as opposed
to Mr. Anonymous,

247
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,231
but was really Ted.

248
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:19,540
- I'm proud of you.
- Anonymous.

249
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,978
It's fake philanthropy,
and it's faux anonymity.

250
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,107
What do you think
about that?

251
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,076
Oh, I want to go talk
to senator Boxer.

252
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,316
I'll be right back.

253
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,451
- Hi.
- Hi, Larry.

254
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,927
- Hello, senator.
- It is good to see you.

255
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,897
Senator, I wanted
to talk to you

256
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,559
about an issue

257
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,263
that doesn't really
get a lot of play in the papers.

258
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,568
Well, tell me 'cause
I like new issues.

259
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,769
Okay, I'm talking
about what's going on

260
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,471
at the dry cleaners.

261
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,844
What's going on
at the dry cleaners, Larry?

262
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,476
Well, what happens is sometimes
they'll give your item

263
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,487
to someone else and then that
person owns it

264
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,718
and walks around in it,
and you have no recourse.

265
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:08,488
And there's no oversight.
It's just complete chaos

266
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:10,495
in the dry cleaning industry,
as I see it.

267
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,087
Larry, the thing
about it is

268
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,497
that sometimes
you get an item

269
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:17,229
that isn't yours and sometimes
you lose an item.

270
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,931
So at the end of the day,
it balances out.

271
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,440
Yeah, well, it's not
balancing out for me, senator.

272
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,204
I never get an item,
and you know what?

273
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,211
If I got it,
I would return it,

274
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,009
because I think the whole
system is flawed.

275
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:31,710
Larry, you see
these slacks?

276
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,719
See 'em?

277
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,551
Dry cleaners.

278
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,819
Those are somebody
else's pants?

279
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,053
Well,
they're mine now.

280
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,459
- You're part of the problem, senator.
- Please don't...

281
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,986
- Isn't he great?
- Ted.

282
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,430
- Oh, you know each other, right.
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:49,400
You look fabulous!

284
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,403
You are such a hero.

285
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,598
- You are, Barbara.
- When you founded the Oceans Foundation

286
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,437
you changed everything because his
kids couldn't swim in the bay.

287
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:59,740
Oh oh, the poor
little kids.

288
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,804
They couldn't swim
in the bay.

289
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,543
Oh, what about the 400-foot pool
they could swim in?

290
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,642
That wasn't available
to them at the time?

291
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,778
Well, you know,
could I just say,

292
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,619
that aside,
look at this.

293
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,024
Anonymous.
You really- I know. I know.

294
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,494
I didn't say-
Larry, did you know

295
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,191
this anonymous is Ted?

296
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,166
- Yeah, I did.
- The point I want to make is:

297
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,600
You didn't need
to do this.

298
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,968
- That's true. He didn't.
- He didn't.

299
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,371
But that's why
I kept my name off,

300
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:30,568
because I think
it's the exhibit.

301
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,839
It's the issue that needs
to stand forward, not me.

302
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,812
- And you're so passionate about the issue.
- Thank you.

303
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,247
You know,
too many people

304
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,750
don't do things out
of the goodness...

305
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:40,251
they want the credit.

306
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,811
You are number one
in my book, Ted Danson.

307
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,823
- Senator.
- Please don't forget...

308
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,825
I've gotta run.
Bye, Larry. Bye, Ted.

309
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:48,326
- So sweet. Bye, darling.
- See you later.

310
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,691
- Yeah, bye.
- Right this way.

311
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,027
Wow, wow.

312
00:13:53,065 --> 00:13:56,034
- I didn't expect that.
- What is this bullshit?

313
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,559
- What?
- Anonymous. Give me a break.

314
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,469
If you're Anonymous, how come
people know about it?

315
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,303
I told maybe one
or two people,

316
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,901
friends that I didn't think
I wanted to have a secret.

317
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,912
I have a feeling everybody
in this room knows.

318
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,642
Can I have your attention,
everybody?

319
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,344
We're gonna start the ceremony
and senator Barbara Boxer would like

320
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,182
- to say a few words.
- Thank you so much.

321
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:18,987
This is a night to thank
two very special people...

322
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,959
- You know, you're full of shit.
- You're a fucking asshole.

323
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,326
- So one is Larry David.
- Anonymous.

324
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,762
Larry David.

325
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:28,596
We are very thrilled
with his contribution,

326
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:33,264
and the other is anonymous.

327
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,438
So you know not
one person,

328
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:48,544
not one thanked me
for the donation.

329
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:49,849
Are you aware of that?

330
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:53,484
Next time I give money
to anybody

331
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,016
it'll be anonymous,
I can tell you that.

332
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,586
And I'm going
to tell everybody.

333
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,792
I know who
the masturbator was.

334
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,733
Jeff.

335
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:10,740
Uh-huh.

336
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:14,439
- Ted Danson told you that.
- It doesn't matter.

337
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,414
Oh my God.
That's really unbelievable.

338
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:19,178
- You know what's unbelievable?
- That's unbelievable.

339
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:22,051
Is that your friend would
think that's it's okay

340
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,555
to come over to our house
and jerk off.

341
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,388
- He's had too much to drink, you know...
- Too much to drink?

342
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,826
- Yeah, he was drunk.
- Well I've had drinks before,

343
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,727
and I didn't go over
to somebody's house

344
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,392
- and masturbate in the guest room.
- Well, good for you.

345
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,196
And by the way,

346
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,759
Jeff is banned
from our house.

347
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,862
- You're banning him from the house?
- Yeah.

348
00:15:39,905 --> 00:15:42,840
He is not welcome
in our house anymore.

349
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,342
I tell you what:
I'd rather have

350
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:46,571
the masturbator in the house
than the gossiper.

351
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,206
Well, you obviously weren't
going to tell me, Larry.

352
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:52,479
I would have told you on the way home
or waited until I got in the house,

353
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:54,986
- Oh, right.
- so we'd have a good laugh over it later.

354
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,351
- A laugh?
- Well, whatever.

355
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,379
- Did you really think-
- No probably not.

356
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:02,656
That's hilarious- "Hey, Cheryl,
guess who jerked off on our blanket?

357
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,493
It was Jeff. Isn't that hilarious?"
Yeah.

358
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,192
Yeah, that's a fun ride home.

359
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,003
Heya, what's going on?

360
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,475
Tch...

361
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,001
It's crazy, really, but,

362
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:23,879
I- you know.

363
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,781
Um...

364
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,651
Cheryl found out about
the stain on the blanket.

365
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,988
How could she find out?
You...

366
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,288
You didn't tell her.

367
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,794
No.

368
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,353
Ted Danson?

369
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,092
Yeah, her girlfriend Ted!

370
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:42,726
- Why would he do do something like that?
- I don't know.

371
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:45,134
- That's unbelievable!
- I don't understand that!

372
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,638
- That was a private moment!
- Absolutely.

373
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,471
- And then he's gossiping?
- What a little yenta!

374
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,500
That's crazy!

375
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:54,705
Now how am I gonna
look Cheryl in the eye?

376
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,443
How can the four of us
ever go out again?

377
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,950
That's another thing.

378
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:03,717
She's uh- she was
pretty upset, and, uh...

379
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,988
she's banned you
from the house.

380
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,054
- Cheryl banned me from your house?
- You're banned.

381
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:13,223
What the hell is going on?

382
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,232
Oh, hey, Sus'.

383
00:17:14,266 --> 00:17:15,528
- Larr.
- Hi, how are you?

384
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,535
What do you mean Cheryl
banned you from the house?

385
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,003
- Who just said-?
- I heard you!

386
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,406
Don't try to bullshit me!
Why, what happened?

387
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,205
What's gonna happen
if I don't tell?

388
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,041
I'll call Cheryl and find out.

389
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,379
- What the fuck difference does it make?
- Well, okay.

390
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,749
Last Passover...

391
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,313
You what?!

392
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:40,450
You jerked off
in their house?

393
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,722
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is sick!

394
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:46,663
You have wrought your semen
outside our home, Jeff?

395
00:17:46,698 --> 00:17:48,666
- Yeah.
- That's adultery!

396
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,260
- That's cheating on me!
- When did...

397
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,363
You masturbate in this house
and this house alone! Maybe a hotel.

398
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,998
Not at a friend's house!

399
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,599
I have to agree
with her, really.

400
00:17:57,643 --> 00:17:59,270
You know what, Larry?
I can handle this.

401
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,801
He's my husband.
Shut the fuck up, okay?

402
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,143
- Okay.
- It's sick, Jeff!

403
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,150
You don't jerk off
in somebody else's home!

404
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,617
And Cheryl kicked him out?

405
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,280
- Yeah, she banned him.
- Really?

406
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,256
Who the fuck is she to tell
my husband what to do?

407
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:14,657
- I punish my husband!
- I could not agree more with you.

408
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,490
- Thank you very much, Larry.
- You're right.

409
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:18,325
Ban him from
the house?

410
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,797
- Fuck you, ban him from the house.
- Fuck you, yeah, absolutely.

411
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,698
I will take care
of you in my own way.

412
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,100
And you know what?
Jeff is banned from your house?

413
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,502
You are banned
from my house.

414
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:28,699
Get the fuck out!

415
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,140
- What? What are you-
- Get the fuck out of my house!

416
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,406
Be gone with you!
Out!

417
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,345
If he's banned, you're banned!

418
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,405
- You're banning me?
- Yes, I am banning you.

419
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,644
- You're banning me from your house?
- Yes I am.

420
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,950
- Okay, fine. I'm banned!
- Good!

421
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,285
Don't come back!

422
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,551
Don't worry, I won't!

423
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,959
- Boo!
- It's a ghost! Don't let him get me!

424
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:56,559
What the hell's going on here?
Oh, hell no!

425
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,331
I will take you out!

426
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,930
The days are over where you
been terrorizing my people!

427
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,271
- It's me!
- Me who?

428
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,903
Larry David! What are you doing
up under this Klan sheet?

429
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,004
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

430
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,275
Oh my God, no no no.

431
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,249
- We were playing ghosts.
- Ghosts?

432
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:14,445
Where I come from,
you see somebody in a sheet,

433
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,579
Ghost is not the first
thing you think about.

434
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,283
You think about K.K.K.

435
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,154
- K.K.K.?
- Yeah.

436
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,524
Come on, are you kidding?

437
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,223
Scared me
half to death, Larry.

438
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,129
Okay, you can get off now.

439
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,964
- All right. Well, help me, love.
- Go ahead.

440
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:33,394
I'll get these groceries...

441
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,668
Hey, Jeff's sunglasses.

442
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,470
- Hey, Leon!
- What up?

443
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,880
What are you doing?
You want to take a ride with me?

444
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,909
I gotta return Jeff's sunglasses.
He left them here.

445
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,614
I got some stuff
to tell you anyway.

446
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,917
All right, Larry.
Hold on.

447
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,719
Give me two minutes, Larry.

448
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,996
Ho ho ho! So it's
Jeff been jackin' off?

449
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,091
That's the
jackoff suspect, huh?

450
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,965
Yeah.
Leon, I am so sorry.

451
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:06,129
That's some fucked-up shit
right there, man.

452
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:08,571
I know. I owe you one.

453
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:10,074
You damn right
you owe me one.

454
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:12,303
- Okay, so we're cool?
- We're cool, man.

455
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:15,040
Okay.
Hey, Leon...

456
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,446
- You see that guy?
- That guy right there?

457
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,279
In the Yankee jersey.

458
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,718
Number 25- that's
my jersey! Joe Pepitone!

459
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,584
- What?
- The dry cleaner gave it to him.

460
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:24,680
He never gave it back.

461
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,384
That's some bullshit
right there.

462
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,087
- I'm going to handle this shit.
- What are you doing?

463
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:32,494
- I'm gonna get your shit back for you, man.
- What are you talking about?

464
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,328
Be cool, Larry. I'm gonna get that
shit back for you.

465
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,561
Leon!

466
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:00,119
Yeah!

467
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:03,321
Yeah,
that's how I do it, baby!

468
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,626
Ha ha ha! Joe Pepitone up
in this motherfucker.

469
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:07,154
Jesus.
Nice goin', man.

470
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,099
- That's how I doos it, baby.
- Nice going.

471
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,570
- That's how I doos it, Larry.
- I like it.

472
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:20,945
What do you want?

473
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,175
Jeff's glasses.

474
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,651
Found them in my house.

475
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,950
He mentioned it to me
so I thought I'd return them.

476
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,717
All right, fine,
thank you.

477
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,591
- I know I'm banned from the house-
- Yeah?

478
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,788
Think I could use
your bathroom?

479
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,354
No, a ban is a ban. What,
does my word mean nothing?

480
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,923
I really gotta go.

481
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,500
All right, I will temporarily
lift the ban.

482
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:48,904
In out- quick!

483
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,168
Beautiful.
Thank you.

484
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,108
What the fuck?!

485
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,907
Ow!

486
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,345
- It was a playful tap!
- What are you, nine years old

487
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,441
in fourth grade?
Get your fuckin' hands off of me!

488
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,981
- It was a playful tap.
- Get in and out!

489
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,453
So what are we
gonna do now,

490
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,518
Get me a new blanket,
new bed, all that shit?

491
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,052
Leon, I'm not
getting you a new bed.

492
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,860
Come on, man.
That's crazy.

493
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,332
That's crazy right there.

494
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,927
- That mattress is tainted!
- Hey, wait a second.

495
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:21,564
Oh my God! There's another
Joe Pepitone jersey!

496
00:22:21,606 --> 00:22:22,903
This is unbelievable.

497
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,000
Is it possible there's
two of these things?

498
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:27,671
- Can't be two.
- Let me check the size.

499
00:22:29,047 --> 00:22:31,072
- 44.
- 44?

500
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,583
No, mine's 42.

501
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:35,347
This can't be my jersey.
That's my jersey.

502
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,050
Okay, well let's get the right shirt then.
How 'bout that?

503
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,685
All right, I can handle that
right now.

504
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,273
That guy right there.
It's his shirt.

505
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,840
We're definitely taking
the damn shirt.

506
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,851
- Larry?
- Huh?

507
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,785
Larry David?
Hey hey hey.

508
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,287
Hey, it's Merle-
Merle Berger

509
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,415
from the NRDC function
the other night.

510
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,925
Oh, Merle!
Hey!

511
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,327
Hey, did you send that guy over
to take my jersey?

512
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:20,763
Well, I didn't really
send him.

513
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,699
He kind of went off
on his own.

514
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,396
He just took the jersey
off my back!

515
00:23:25,437 --> 00:23:27,462
I don't think it's really your jersey,
though, is it, Merle?

516
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:29,474
What do you mean?
I was wearing it.

517
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,976
Did you get that jersey
from the dry cleaner?

518
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,138
Yeah, I got it-
I got it from the dry cleaner.

519
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,977
Okay, Merle, that jersey
is my jersey.

520
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:40,041
I brought it into that dry cleaner
and they gave it to you by mistake.

521
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,111
- But you didn't return it.
- But that's the law of the dry cleaners.

522
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,986
You know, you win some,
you lose some.

523
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,082
- That's the way it works.
- That doesn't work out with me.

524
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,888
I never get any stuff
from the dry cleaner.

525
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,690
The only mistakes they make with me
are to give my stuff to other people.

526
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,492
That's not my fault.
I've lost tons of stuff

527
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:54,362
at the dry cleaners.
I lost drapes!

528
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,890
Well, I'm sorry for your losses
but you're not gonna make it up now.

529
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,527
If you got a problem
with this

530
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,038
why don't you just
write your congressperson?

531
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:03,370
Yeah, well I spoke to senator Boxer.
How about that?

532
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,239
Oh, that's great.
And what did she say?

533
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:08,106
She said...

534
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,377
that she's gonna go to Washington
and take care of this problem.

535
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,476
Okay, you know what?

536
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,248
I'm on the board
at the NRDC

537
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,017
and your name's
coming off that wall.

538
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,216
How would you like that?

539
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:21,122
You're gonna take my name
off the wall?

540
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,389
- Yeah, I'm gonna-
- No! You wouldn't.

541
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,895
Oh, you bet I would.

542
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,795
- Okay, go ahead, do it.
- I'm gonna do it!

543
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:28,629
And why don't you
put up "Anonymous" instead?

544
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,567
I will.
That's a perfect idea.

545
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,832
- Yeah, really? Go ahead and do it.
- I have a lot of pull.

546
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,202
- Okay, let's see.
- Good.

547
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:35,638
You come by there
next Monday,

548
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,301
It's gonna say "Anonymous"
on the wall.

549
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:40,368
- Okay, good! Don't forget.
- I'm not!

550
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,746
Okay.
Joe Pepitone!

551
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:47,374
We got a matching set, man.

552
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,425
Mom!

553
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,929
What's wrong,
Sammy, darling?

554
00:25:01,032 --> 00:25:04,832
Mmm! Bam!

555
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,996
Bam!

556
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:07,026
- War.
- War.

557
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,506
I declare war!

558
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:10,769
Boom! Aw!

559
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,037
All right!
What'd I get?

560
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,874
Take it.
Peanut, grab that door!

561
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:15,777
Get the door, Peanut!

562
00:25:15,814 --> 00:25:17,247
I just want to do
my thing, Larry.

563
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:18,909
What is your thing?

564
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,645
I'm gonna be
a director, man...

565
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,414
Action movies,
all that stuff, man.

566
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,615
You know you can't just
go right into that.

567
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:27,557
You gotta get something in production,
you know what I mean?

568
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,082
Oh. Oh, man.

569
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,594
This is a new low,
even for you, Larry.

570
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:33,723
Huh?

571
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:37,030
You came over yesterday,
you went to the bathroom

572
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,536
and you choked it
on Sammy's teddy bear

573
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:43,530
as some kind of revenge
masturbatory payback!

574
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,635
- Okay, I didn't do that-
- Oh, bullshit! You're a fucking liar!

575
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:48,111
- What, I did that?
- Yes you did!

576
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:49,113
Are you crazy?

577
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,637
It's that jackalit, right?

578
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,149
Who the fuck is this?

579
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,775
That's Leon,
Loretta's brother.

580
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,979
What's up what's up,
what's up what's up? Mmm.

581
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,956
I tell you one thing: I like a woman
with a smart-ass mouth like that.

582
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,584
- Yeah, well fuck you too!
- Mmm. You handle yourself.

583
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:03,753
That's beside the point, Leon.
This is sick,

584
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,889
this is perverse, and I think this is
the lowest you've ever gone.

585
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,366
- Come on, I didn't do that.
- Oh really, then who did?

586
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,234
- I don't know.
- Just some anonymous person?

587
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,794
Who's anonymous, then?

588
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:17,205
- Oh, I know who Anonymous is.
- Who?

589
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,767
- It's Ted Danson.
- How do you know?

590
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,109
Well, he told me,
but he told me not to tell anybody.

591
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:25,139
That's how he likes to do it.
Makes him feel better about himself.

592
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,618
Danson?!

593
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,449
Oh, that's disgusting!

594
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,978
That is just disgusting!

595
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,253
What a perv, man!
Actors!

596
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,284
Boom! War.

597
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,388
I declare...

598
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:40,420
- Boom!
- -war.

599
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,435
I'll get it.

600
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,216
Ted, it's Susie for you.

601
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:05,245
I wonder what she wants.

602
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,162
- Hey, Larr, how are you?
- Hi Kathy.

603
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,063
- How are you doing, man?
- Good.

604
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,695
Hey, I wanted to tell you I heard that
you took your name off the NRDC building

605
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,967
and had it replaced
with Anonymous.

606
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:24,601
I think it's so wonderful.
I admire you so much for that.

607
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,636
Kathy, I get plenty of fanfare.
I don't need the fanfare, you know?

608
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,511
- Good for you, Larry.
- I really don't.

609
00:27:30,548 --> 00:27:32,607
As a matter of fact,
I hope you don't mind

610
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:36,178
That I told a few people that you
were the anonymous person.

611
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,746
I hope that's okay
that I let that slip out.

612
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,350
Well, I can't really tell you
what to do, but I- yeah...

613
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,361
people should know
you're anonymous.

614
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,421
- You're a great guy, Larry-
- Well, if you want to tell people go ahead.

615
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,490
- You know, it's up to you.
- I have already and I might continue.

616
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:51,627
- Continue away.
- All right, I will.

617
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,069
- Thank you.
- Take care, honey.

618
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:54,401
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

619
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:57,272
It's that guy.
That's the guy.

620
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,173
Hey!
That's the guy!

621
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:01,610
That's that bald guy
that took my jersey!

622
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,875
You gotta let me in!

623
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,315
These people
are chasing me!

624
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,511
Sir, the building's closed.
I can't help you.

625
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,850
No no, I'm Larry David.
That's my wing!

626
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,951
- That says "Anonymous."
- I'm Anonymous!

627
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,419
I'm Anonymous!

628
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:53,022
Larry David is Anonymous!
