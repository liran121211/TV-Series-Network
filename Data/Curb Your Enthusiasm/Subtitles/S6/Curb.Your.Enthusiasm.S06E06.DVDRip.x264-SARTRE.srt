1
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:25,984
Unbelievable.

2
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:28,388
This is
the slowest toaster.

3
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:31,584
Man, oh, man.
I can't take it.

4
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:33,680
Cheap-ass toaster,
that's what happened.

5
00:00:33,724 --> 00:00:37,213
- Hey, do you want to get this job today?
- You're damn right I do.

6
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:40,088
- Can I give you a little tip, huh?
- Let's do it.

7
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,147
You're gonna go in.
He'll be up here, okay?

8
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:46,055
You're down here, right?
He's on top.

9
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,990
- He's asking you the questions.
- Uh-huh.

10
00:00:49,025 --> 00:00:50,718
Then all of a sudden the interview starts.
He asks some questions,

11
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:53,280
you answer some questions.
Then you start asking him the questions,

12
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:55,847
and you flip it.
Now he's trying to impress you.

13
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:58,015
- Turn that shit around on him.
- Turn it around on him.

14
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:00,080
- Topsy-turvy that motherfucker.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

15
00:01:00,124 --> 00:01:02,522
Why you got no credit cards?
You got no credit cards at all?

16
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:04,786
- Why don't you have a credit card, sir?
- You have no credit cards?

17
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:08,222
Why do you order these CDs
out of those magazines

18
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:10,155
and be sending 'em
next door to the neighbor

19
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:11,714
and then when
the UPS guy comes,

20
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:13,348
you pick 'em up like
you live there and shit?

21
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:16,824
You keep ordering CDs
that you don't pay for?

22
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:19,790
I'm just saying- example how
to turn that shit around.

23
00:01:19,825 --> 00:01:21,791
You know what I mean?
Specific shit, though.

24
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:24,223
I don't know. It might not be such
a good idea, this whole flip-it thing.

25
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:25,883
I like it, man. I like it.

26
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:29,413
- Hello.
- Hi, is this Mr. David I'm speaking with?

27
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,947
You know what? I'm sorry.
I'm really not interested.

28
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:34,117
- I understand you're in the market...
- Telemarketer.

29
00:01:34,157 --> 00:01:37,590
- So to preserve your financial-
- Right, huh?

30
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:40,147
He's talking right now.
Sir, I said I'm really not interested.

31
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:42,680
He don't give a fuck.
You don't give a fuck about this...

32
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:46,055
He's still talking.
All right, please don't call here again.

33
00:01:46,092 --> 00:01:47,955
- Is there someone else-
- Sir, I'm sorry.

34
00:01:47,992 --> 00:01:51,117
- What the fuck?
- They're crazy.

35
00:01:51,158 --> 00:01:53,215
- Got the same phone.
- You do?

36
00:01:53,258 --> 00:01:55,053
- Same damn phone.
- Yeah, this is a good product.

37
00:01:55,092 --> 00:01:57,718
- L.D., you taking the kids to school?
- I'm taking the kids to school.

38
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,588
Thank you. Baby,
get your backpacks over there.

39
00:02:01,624 --> 00:02:03,681
- There you go.
- Larry!

40
00:02:03,725 --> 00:02:06,283
All right, one sec!
This is really unbelievable.

41
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:08,984
Larry!

42
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,820
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

43
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:14,086
I feel like
you forgot about me.

44
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,148
No no, of course not.
I didn't forget about you.

45
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,420
I don't have
anything to drink.

46
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:20,481
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:20,524 --> 00:02:24,082
I'm dealing with that farkakte toaster
down there, you know?

48
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:27,852
Do you realize
how sick I am?

49
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,619
- Do you have a fever?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:32,023
- How do you do it? This way?
- No, I'm...

51
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:34,854
please, if you would just
help me out a little.

52
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:36,915
Always had a problem
telling fever.

53
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,016
- Yeah yeah.
- Then you feel your head.

54
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:41,024
See, I feel I'm hotter than you.
Now I feel I have a fever.

55
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:42,990
Maybe I'm getting sick.

56
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,718
Touch my head.
Am I sick?

57
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:48,589
You don't have
a fever.

58
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:51,648
- Hey, guess what.
- Mmm.

59
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:54,919
Leon has
a job interview today.

60
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,924
- Yeah, that's good.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,584
And Loretta has one tomorrow.
This is unbelievable.

62
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,615
If one of 'em
gets a job...

63
00:03:03,993 --> 00:03:06,618
- they're out.
- Look, I don't think I'm gonna be able to go

64
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,090
- to Keysha's play tomorrow.
- You're kidding.

65
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:11,648
You- you should probably
take somebody else or something.

66
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,180
Really? I wanna take you, honey.
I don't wanna take anybody else.

67
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:16,192
No, I can't go out there
with other people...

68
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:19,453
- I wanna take you.
- ... and sit in a crowd.

69
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,890
Wanna take you.

70
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:27,455
Please tell me you're
not coming on to me.

71
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:29,890
No good?

72
00:03:29,926 --> 00:03:32,586
If you could just get me
some water and some juice,

73
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,353
that would be great.

74
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:36,449
- All right, anyway.
- I'm really tired.

75
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:41,554
All right, I'm gonna get
you some water, okay?

76
00:03:41,592 --> 00:03:43,217
This is very nice,
by the way, this thing.

77
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:45,418
Okay, thank you, Larry.

78
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,483
Hey!

79
00:03:51,293 --> 00:03:54,259
- Ah! Hello, fellow parents.
- Hi, Larry.

80
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:55,918
- Huh?
- How's it going, Larry?

81
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,186
- Good, how are you, Hal?
- Good.

82
00:03:57,226 --> 00:03:59,215
- Hi, Jean. Susie.
- Last. Yeah.

83
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:01,487
Hey, guys, I'm sorry.
I gotta get going.

84
00:04:01,526 --> 00:04:04,117
I'll see you later, okay?
I love you.

85
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,785
- Bye. Bye. Bye.
- Oh, that's so cute. He's so sweet.

86
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,793
- Bye. That's the sign for "bye," right?
- He's a sweet guy.

87
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:10,951
- Huh? See, I got that down.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:10,993 --> 00:04:14,653
- Yeah, you're a genius.
- Huh? Bye. How about so-so?

89
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:16,522
So-so,
is that it?

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,048
- See, how about that?
- Yeah, that's great. Great.

91
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:20,389
How about,
"Phew, it stinks"?

92
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,119
I know a lot more, too.

93
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,624
Let me ask you a question.
You happy with your toaster?

94
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,148
You happy
with your toaster?

95
00:04:26,193 --> 00:04:28,182
Why, what's wrong?

96
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,055
- It takes forever. It's so slow.
- Oh, it's slow.

97
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:33,116
Oh, there's a sale.

98
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,818
Sur La Table.

99
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:37,325
- Sur La Table's having a sale on toasters.
- How do you know

100
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,223
- how to say "Sur La Table"?
- She spelled it, Larry.

101
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,953
- She spelled it.
- You're pretty good.

102
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:42,721
Yeah, there's a lot of things
about me you don't know.

103
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,658
- Hello, sweetheart.
- I'm going to that sale. You too?

104
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:47,886
- Yeah. Hi, Sammie.
- Hi.

105
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:49,688
Ah! Spider! Spider!

106
00:04:49,727 --> 00:04:51,919
- Oh my God!
- Spider! Aghh!

107
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,517
- Come on!
- Larry, what is the matter with you?

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,549
- Killing a live creature!
- What?

109
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:59,286
What is wrong with you?
You're traumatizing these kids!

110
00:04:59,326 --> 00:05:02,157
- What are you talking about? It's a spider.
- It's a living creature, Larry.

111
00:05:02,193 --> 00:05:04,421
Oh, living creature! Do you want that
living creature crawling up your leg?

112
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,323
These kids don't need
to see that kind of violence.

113
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,883
It's a little spider.
Big deal.

114
00:05:08,927 --> 00:05:12,257
- Are you okay, sweetie?
- Oh my God. Is that your dog?

115
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:14,782
I thought it was, like,
half rat or something.

116
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,887
Said it's a rat.

117
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:21,087
You know, like it looks-
no, it's- it's a joke.

118
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:23,820
I was joking!

119
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,553
- Joking!
- You insulted her now, okay?

120
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:28,422
- She can't hear you screaming.
- What did you...

121
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,654
You heard what I said.
I said you said it was half-rat.

122
00:05:31,693 --> 00:05:34,387
How do you wind up
with a dog like that?

123
00:05:34,427 --> 00:05:36,359
Mmm!

124
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:44,049
- Oh, hey, Hal.
- Hey, how you doing, Larry?

125
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,754
Good, do you know what?
I- I'm glad I saw you again,

126
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:48,691
because after you left,

127
00:05:48,727 --> 00:05:50,488
I made a little comment

128
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:53,015
that maybe didn't go over
so well with your wife.

129
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,526
I said her dog looked,

130
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,151
you know, half-rat.

131
00:05:57,194 --> 00:05:58,990
- Really?
- Yeah.

132
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:01,152
- I was joking in my tone.
- Mm-hmm.

133
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,921
I had a joking tone,

134
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,290
but I guess because,
you know, she doesn't hear,

135
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:08,657
she's not able
to detect tone.

136
00:06:08,694 --> 00:06:10,523
- No.
- You know, the dog.

137
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:13,459
It is kind of a ratty-looking dog.
You've gotta admit that.

138
00:06:13,494 --> 00:06:15,960
- She loves that dog.
- How about you?

139
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:18,358
- Do you pet that dog?
- Yeah, I pet...

140
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:21,088
- You pet that dog? You pet that dog?
- I pet that dog.

141
00:06:21,128 --> 00:06:23,457
I pet that dog, yes.

142
00:06:23,494 --> 00:06:27,017
Anyway, just do me a favor
and tell her I was joking.

143
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,151
- I'm sorry.
- Well, I think you should apologize.

144
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:32,092
Well, I would,

145
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:35,218
except I can't
really call her.

146
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,726
The deaf thing again.

147
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:38,726
I know she's deaf.

148
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,885
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

149
00:06:40,927 --> 00:06:43,393
Why don't you come over
and just apologize face to face,

150
00:06:43,427 --> 00:06:45,858
so she can actually see it coming out
of your mouth?

151
00:06:45,893 --> 00:06:48,689
You want me to come by,
make a special trip?

152
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:50,660
I wouldn't think
she would want that.

153
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:53,216
I would think that they wanna be
treated like everybody else.

154
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,090
- What do you mean "they"?
- Well, deaf people,

155
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:59,491
'cause they're the only ones
who need a special pop-in apology.

156
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:02,517
Every other kind of handicapped person
you can apologize to on the phone.

157
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:05,686
Deaf people require
that you go to their house.

158
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,285
Right.

159
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:09,123
I wouldn't think they would
want that. That's all.

160
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:12,252
I still would appreciate it if you would
come by and apologize to her.

161
00:07:12,295 --> 00:07:13,783
She really
loves that dog.

162
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:17,624
That dog sits in your lap
while you're watching TV?

163
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,651
Yeah.

164
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:21,819
Okay, I'm more
than happy to come by.

165
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:24,554
Thanks.

166
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:32,119
What did you call me?

167
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:35,589
Fuck you!

168
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:38,851
What? What?

169
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,190
Cheryl was in bed.

170
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:49,455
She had
a little temperature,

171
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:53,222
but something about it that kind
of turned me on. She's sick.

172
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:56,057
- I understand.
- She's helpless. You know what I mean?

173
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:58,652
I like it the reverse,
when I'm sick.

174
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:00,490
Yeah, I like it
either way.

175
00:08:00,528 --> 00:08:04,517
- I guess I just like sick sex.
- Yeah!

176
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:07,221
- It's all good. It's good, all right?
- Okay.

177
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:10,125
Okay, all right. So let me
ask you this question.

178
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,957
- My father's been kind of depressed lately.
- Yeah. Yeah.

179
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:17,519
So I'm thinking maybe actually
getting him one of those,

180
00:08:17,562 --> 00:08:21,153
you know, the massages,
the happy-ending kind.

181
00:08:21,195 --> 00:08:24,184
- Happy ending. I am the guy.
- Massage.

182
00:08:24,228 --> 00:08:26,456
- Really, yeah?
- You want some names?

183
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:28,358
- Anybody.
- I got some great ones,

184
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:29,793
and they give great massages.

185
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:32,658
So he thinks he's getting a massage.
He's gonna freak out, man.

186
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:34,251
I know the perfect girl.
Her name's Lisa.

187
00:08:34,295 --> 00:08:37,262
- Lisa.
- Lisa, she will treat him like a king.

188
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:39,887
She's the best girl
you could possibly get for this.

189
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,361
- Best girl for what?
- What's the girl who cleans on Tuesday?

190
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:45,486
- What's her name again?
- Oh, Rosalina.

191
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:47,426
- Rosalina.
- She's terrific.

192
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,791
- You've got her number. Give it to him.
- Yeah, all right.

193
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:51,795
- Oh, you know what.
- What?

194
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:54,817
I need to ask you a question
about sign language.

195
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:58,350
- I was in the men's room earlier with Hal...
- Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:58,395 --> 00:09:00,759
- Okay.
- ... and I was drying my hands,

197
00:09:00,795 --> 00:09:03,693
and I must have signed
something inadvertently,

198
00:09:03,729 --> 00:09:06,218
because all of a sudden,
he got pissed off, said, "Fuck you,"

199
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:09,318
- and stormed out.
- Well, what did you do? Re-enact.

200
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,590
I was drying my hands,
you know,

201
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:15,117
and then I remember
scratching my finger

202
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:18,595
- like this.
- Oh, wait a minute.

203
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,186
Larry, this means
"cocksucker."

204
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:24,092
You called him a cocksucker.
Think about it.

205
00:09:24,128 --> 00:09:26,390
You called him a cocksucker?

206
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:28,395
- You called him a cocksucker.
- Are you kidding?

207
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:30,156
He thought you said cocksucker.
Yes, that's what this is.

208
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:33,559
You called Hal, one of the sweetest guys
in the world, a cocksucker.

209
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:36,083
He said, "Fuck you," and walked out?
Good for him.

210
00:09:36,128 --> 00:09:38,617
- Ha!
- Unbelievable.

211
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:41,560
Meanwhile, I got nobody to take
to see "Grease" tomorrow.

212
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,561
- Oh, Cheryl's sick.
- She's sick, yeah.

213
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:45,754
- She's not even going.
- So you got nobody to go with.

214
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,317
Who watches "Grease" by themselves?
You gotta go with somebody.

215
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:52,022
- I have nobody to take.
- I'll go.

216
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:56,421
I'll go to "Grease"
with you.

217
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:58,860
That's Mike.
He's my exterminator.

218
00:09:58,895 --> 00:10:02,487
How you doing? I heard you say
you got an extra ticket.

219
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:04,654
I'd love to go.

220
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:08,150
Well, you know,
it's a middle-school production...

221
00:10:08,196 --> 00:10:10,457
kids doing "Grease."
You don't wanna go see that.

222
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:13,257
I'd love it.
I'd love to go.

223
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,992
Well, you know,

224
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,359
my wife could
get better by tomorrow.

225
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,294
- I really-
- Okay.

226
00:10:22,329 --> 00:10:24,726
- What?
- Yeah, no, I understand. I get it.

227
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:26,251
What? You get what?
What are you talking about?

228
00:10:26,296 --> 00:10:28,262
I shouldn't have
done that. I'm sorry.

229
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:30,319
Mr. Greene, I'm sorry
about that. I'll finish up.

230
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,693
No, that's crazy.
No, don't be silly.

231
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,922
I just overheard that
you had an extra ticket,

232
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:38,122
and I love "Grease,"
and I'd love to go,

233
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:40,594
but- yeah.

234
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:41,992
All right, okay.

235
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:44,518
- That's great.
- Okay, yeah, you can go.

236
00:10:44,563 --> 00:10:47,028
We're gonna have a blast.
That's gonna be fun.

237
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:48,756
That's gonna be great.
Should I pick you up?

238
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:51,455
Sure, pick me up.

239
00:10:51,496 --> 00:10:54,860
Hey, we're gonna have fun.
We'll get fucked up.

240
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,828
- You know?
- Yeah.

241
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:05,463
It went good yesterday.

242
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:07,053
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Really?

243
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:09,324
- When are you gonna hear?
- I'll know today.

244
00:11:09,363 --> 00:11:13,057
- Today? You're kidding.
- Yes, today. Oh, yeah.

245
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:15,359
- You flipped him.
- I flipped his ass good, man.

246
00:11:15,397 --> 00:11:17,726
- Huh?
- Took the whole conversation over.

247
00:11:17,763 --> 00:11:19,592
So you were
interviewing him

248
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:21,720
as to whether or not
he was good enough for you.

249
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:25,093
Yeah, I think I got it. I'm flipping ass
right now. I'm out of control right now.

250
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,619
- Don't flip me, man.
- How do you know if I haven't already?

251
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:29,095
- I'm unflippable.
- How do you know?

252
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,153
- Only women can flip me.
- I'll flip you, Larry.

253
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,822
Words to the wise, Larry:

254
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:36,455
This toaster ain't worth a damn.
Flipping toaster.

255
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:39,327
- All right, y'all, what do you think?
- Ooh, look at you.

256
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:40,954
- Do I look professional?
- It's on now pro-fes-sion-nal.

257
00:11:40,997 --> 00:11:43,259
- L.D.?
- You're looking pretty good, I gotta say.

258
00:11:43,297 --> 00:11:46,854
- You still gonna give me that ride, though?
- Yeah, I'm gonna take you.

259
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:50,260
- Hey, I'm sensing two jobs. Two jobs.
- All right.

260
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,785
- I'm feeling that.
- And then maybe, you know,

261
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,762
you'll think about getting your own-
your own place.

262
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:58,285
So you really
like my suit?

263
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,296
Man, that is banging, girl.
Perfect!

264
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,887
'Cause you don't
wanna be too assuming.

265
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,452
You know, even if one of you
actually got a job,

266
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:07,724
you could probably all just move
into an apartment, huh?

267
00:12:07,763 --> 00:12:10,321
Yeah, something to...

268
00:12:13,464 --> 00:12:15,123
- Hey!
- Hey!

269
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:17,721
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Hey. Hey hey hey hey!

270
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:19,558
What are you doing?
I thought you were coming later.

271
00:12:19,596 --> 00:12:22,620
Later? I couldn't wait to see you.
I couldn't wait to get here.

272
00:12:22,664 --> 00:12:25,494
My goodness, I am
so happy to see you.

273
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,120
Do I look good?

274
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,686
- Pretty good.
- Yes, pretty good.

275
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:32,856
Do I look healthier?
Do I look relaxed?

276
00:12:32,897 --> 00:12:35,385
I gotta say, you gotta-
you gotta- look relaxed.

277
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,191
You got a nice bounce
to your step.

278
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,526
Yes, I do have
a bounce to my step,

279
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:42,997
because something wonderful happened
to me, not just a massage.

280
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,792
- Really?
- I had a nice massage.

281
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,592
Oh, boy,
what a massage,

282
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,324
and this girl
likes me.

283
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:53,592
This girl maybe
even loves me,

284
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,822
and I am in love
with her.

285
00:12:55,863 --> 00:12:57,988
Dad, I'm thrilled

286
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,293
- you had a good time.
- Yeah.

287
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,626
- You enjoyed the massage.
- Yes, I did.

288
00:13:02,664 --> 00:13:04,789
They like all their clients.
This is their job,

289
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,421
to like their clients.

290
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:08,623
She outdid herself
on this job.

291
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,789
You know what I want to do?
I want to get her something lovely,

292
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:15,058
- something wonderful.
- No no no, what, are you, crazy?

293
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:17,928
- Yes yes, I'm crazy.
- Don't buy her any presents, okay?

294
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:20,521
- Why not?
- She got paid for the massage,

295
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:22,962
you don't need to buy
her any big present or anything.

296
00:13:22,998 --> 00:13:25,623
Come on, Larry.
This is personal.

297
00:13:25,664 --> 00:13:28,596
She did things
that say love.

298
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:31,461
Larry!

299
00:13:32,731 --> 00:13:34,594
I gotta-
I'll be right down.

300
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,926
- Do you hear me?
- This is love.

301
00:13:36,964 --> 00:13:39,589
Yeah, Dad, you know,
they- they like everybody.

302
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,721
But this one
liked me particularly.

303
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:44,321
Larry!

304
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:47,489
- Hey.
- Hey.

305
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,930
Could you get me
some wheat toast?

306
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:53,093
Wheat toast?
You know what?

307
00:13:53,135 --> 00:13:56,035
Honest to God, I gotta take Loretta
to this job interview

308
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:59,038
and that toaster
takes a year.

309
00:13:59,072 --> 00:14:01,971
This is what
I'm talking about.

310
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:05,031
- You don't care about me.
- No, of course I care about you.

311
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:08,202
I feel like eating for the first time
in I don't know how long.

312
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:11,905
All right. Okay, all right,
I'll get you the wheat toast. Okay.

313
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:19,206
Hey, Leon. Sorry, man.
I need the toaster.

314
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,217
L.D.,
are we leaving soon?

315
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,946
Huh? Yeah, I just gotta
make Cheryl some wheat toast.

316
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:26,283
I got a lot of time invested
in this toaster, Larry.

317
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:28,289
Now I'm gonna have to
start over again.

318
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:30,552
- You don't have to start all over.
- I gotta start all over again.

319
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:32,649
- You pick up where you left off.
- I can't pause toast.

320
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:34,989
- You can pause toast.
- If this toast goes back in that machine,

321
00:14:35,026 --> 00:14:37,789
- it's gonna lose its essence, Larry.
- Leon! Leon!

322
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:40,352
Will you get
a man his toast?

323
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:51,599
Okay, here you go.

324
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:53,967
- All right, honey.
- Wait a second.

325
00:14:54,004 --> 00:14:55,402
I wanted toast.

326
00:14:55,438 --> 00:14:57,235
- That's toast.
- It's not toasted.

327
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:00,604
- That's toast.
- I didn't want bread. I wanted toast.

328
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:02,574
This has been
in the toaster.

329
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,509
Can you toast it again?
'Cause it's not...

330
00:15:05,544 --> 00:15:07,374
You can't pause
toast.

331
00:15:07,411 --> 00:15:10,868
Yo, L.D.!

332
00:15:10,914 --> 00:15:13,438
- She's gonna be late for her interview.
- All right, go.

333
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:14,914
- Just go.
- She's probably all- all...

334
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,712
I'm sorry, honey.
I did the best- I'm sorry.

335
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,884
Larry!

336
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,115
- L.D., please!
- Oh my God, I am so sorry.

337
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,622
- Hurry! I need to go!
- You know, she's sick up there...

338
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,920
- I'm gonna be late. I have got to get going.
- Okay, all right.

339
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,424
Let me just get my-
Dad, come on.

340
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,153
- She's late.
- Okay, come on.

341
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:34,922
- I'm gonna use you as my
good-luck piece. - Okay, come on.

342
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:37,485
- Oh, shit, my phone.
- What now?

343
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:40,498
All right, great,
let's go!

344
00:15:40,532 --> 00:15:42,055
I'm sorry, really.

345
00:15:45,334 --> 00:15:47,233
L.D. do you think
we can go a little faster?

346
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:49,395
Loretta, I swear, I'm going as fast
as I can. What can I do?

347
00:15:49,436 --> 00:15:51,630
- Okay, we'll just have to step on it.
- I mean there's traffic here.

348
00:15:51,671 --> 00:15:54,571
- I know it is.
- Look at this schmohawk over here.

349
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,129
Schmohawk.

350
00:15:56,173 --> 00:15:58,868
- What?!
- I taught him that when he was a kid.

351
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:02,241
I used to call- every bad driver
was a schmohawk.

352
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,075
Do you like that one?

353
00:16:07,381 --> 00:16:10,906
Okay, thanks.
I'll be right back.

354
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,613
Hi. I know I'm late,
but I'm Loretta Black.

355
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:20,281
- I have an interview with Mr. Badnick.
- He waited for half an hour.

356
00:16:20,322 --> 00:16:21,686
He had to leave.
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:23,484
Can we reschedule?

358
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:27,322
He's already filled
the position.

359
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:34,021
15 whole minutes we were waiting
on that damn toaster.

360
00:16:34,063 --> 00:16:36,656
- 15 minutes!
- It's a slow toaster.

361
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:39,995
Yes! Because of that damned toaster,
I missed my job interview.

362
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,762
I'm sor- I'm gonna buy
a new toaster right now.

363
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,768
- Yeah, that's exactly what you need to do.
- Right now!

364
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:47,702
- I'm buying a new toaster!
- And I'm gonna get a toaster for Lisa.

365
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:49,636
Will you stop it,
please?

366
00:16:49,672 --> 00:16:52,504
I am gonna get
my love lady,

367
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,700
I am gonna get her
a toaster.

368
00:16:59,744 --> 00:17:02,177
- I don't know, L.D.
- Look, you can put a bagel in there.

369
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:04,009
You don't have
to press down on it.

370
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:05,878
- Ah. So that's the bagel side...
- Yes,

371
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:08,041
- they've taken the bagel into consideration.
- ... and the toaster.

372
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:11,074
That's a good one, but do you
think it's gonna take all day?

373
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:14,142
Well, you know,
that's the question.

374
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:17,851
Uh-huh. What,
you like that?

375
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:19,355
- He's cute.
- Yeah?

376
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:20,947
- A little too beige for me, though.
- Too beige?

377
00:17:20,991 --> 00:17:23,584
- Yeah, I like them chocolate.
- You like them chocolate.

378
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,957
- I like them chocolate.
- I could care less about shade.

379
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:27,392
- Really?
- Yeah.

380
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,861
- What do you like?
- I'd go anywhere

381
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:33,489
from like albino to the heart
of darkness Africa black.

382
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:36,624
- No way.
- Yeah.

383
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:40,260
Oh, that's- that's Jean.
I'll be right back.

384
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:45,098
Hi. Ahem.

385
00:17:45,138 --> 00:17:46,729
Toaster?

386
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:50,229
Yeah.
Yeah, you told me.

387
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:54,403
Sorry about what-
I was joking

388
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:57,003
about the dog.
Ha ha ha.

389
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:59,410
Joking, joking.

390
00:17:59,447 --> 00:18:03,040
No, not a rat. No rat.

391
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,016
No no.
I like the dog.

392
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:12,311
You want me to kiss him?!
Yeah, to make up- sure.

393
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:14,515
Okay okay.

394
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:17,183
Yeah yeah.

395
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,424
Thank you.

396
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:27,190
Oh, and your husband-
I was in the bathroom...

397
00:18:27,229 --> 00:18:29,628
you know, and he was
washing and I went like this

398
00:18:29,664 --> 00:18:32,996
'cause I had
a scratch and...

399
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,694
That's bad.
"Cocksucker," come on.

400
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:37,361
Misunderstanding.

401
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,562
Yeah, misunderstanding.

402
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:45,462
Okay. Sorry.

403
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:48,566
You'll be at the play?
"Grease"?

404
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,110
- ... that she- kind of joy.
- Hmm.

405
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,408
It's not that.
Of course, it's some sexual...

406
00:18:56,446 --> 00:18:59,846
but she's got a kind
of way of looking at me

407
00:18:59,882 --> 00:19:03,009
- that makes me feel warm.
- She does it for you, huh?

408
00:19:03,051 --> 00:19:06,917
- Oh my God.
- And listen, I saw a cappuccino machine.

409
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:09,318
I love this thing
and I know you are too.

410
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:11,480
You're not getting her
a cappuccino machine, okay?

411
00:19:11,522 --> 00:19:15,718
Listen, Dad. I set this massage up, okay?
This woman gives like...

412
00:19:15,758 --> 00:19:18,555
you know, happy-ending massages.
She gives them to everybody.

413
00:19:18,593 --> 00:19:21,026
I don't know what you're talking about
with this happy ending.

414
00:19:21,061 --> 00:19:24,552
- I'm talking about this.
- All I know is, this girl, for goodness sake...

415
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,621
- You know. Yeah.
- Oh.

416
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:30,457
Oh...

417
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,060
no, that wasn't to you!
It's a misunderstanding!

418
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:36,331
Misunderstanding!

419
00:19:38,171 --> 00:19:40,866
Oh, hey, Hal.
It's Larry David calling.

420
00:19:40,906 --> 00:19:44,397
Um, there was a little incident
at the department store earlier today

421
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:48,240
with your wife. And she may
have misinterpreted something I did,

422
00:19:48,277 --> 00:19:50,176
a gesture,
you know, uh...

423
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:53,941
Anyway, I just wanna talk to you
about it and tell you what's going on.

424
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:57,380
Um, call me- actually, call me
on my cell phone.

425
00:19:57,416 --> 00:20:00,282
I'm gonna be out.
Um, okay.

426
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:03,479
Thanks, Hal.

427
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,953
Whoo, Keysha
is sick as a dog.

428
00:20:05,988 --> 00:20:09,013
- What?!
- She's sick. She really feels bad.

429
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:10,683
- You're kidding.
- Nuh-uh, I think...

430
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:12,918
- She's not gonna be in the play?
- No.

431
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,551
- She might've caught that bug Cheryl's got.
- Oh, man.

432
00:20:15,593 --> 00:20:18,152
So I'm gonna take her some juice and see
if she can hold it down.

433
00:20:18,195 --> 00:20:19,821
All right.

434
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,691
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Bill

435
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:27,894
from Woodcrest Financial Services calling.
I'm calling about the offer.

436
00:20:27,934 --> 00:20:29,560
Uh, okay.

437
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:32,899
Bill, listen, do me a favor...

438
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:35,496
please stop calling, okay?
I'm not interested.

439
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,302
I've got an offer you are gonna love,
though. This is a serious offer.

440
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,239
You're a bit of a numbskull, aren't you?
Nothing seems to register.

441
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:44,141
When you order a soda at a counter
and you get the soda,

442
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:46,610
do you keep saying,
"I'd like a soda, I'd like a soda,

443
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,544
I'd like a soda,
I'd like a soda"?

444
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:50,842
Wait wait wait. You have any idea what
we're talking about here?

445
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,905
We're prepared
to make you an offer.

446
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,615
I just called Leon Black
to offer him that job.

447
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:01,211
- He just about told me to fuck myself.
- Hmm.

448
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:08,281
- Yo yo!
- Hey, it's Hal,

449
00:21:08,324 --> 00:21:11,884
- just returning your call.
- What up, Al?

450
00:21:11,927 --> 00:21:14,918
What's going on, boy?
Yeah, what's going down?

451
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:17,156
Oh, nothing, uh,
you, uh...

452
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:19,959
- are you calling to apologize?
- What?

453
00:21:19,997 --> 00:21:21,624
The fuck you talking about, man?
Look here, man.

454
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:24,634
Your lady came on to me.
I hit that ass and I moved on, dawg.

455
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,794
You wasn't in town, dawg.
This shit is over, man.

456
00:21:26,836 --> 00:21:29,598
Oh, okay.
Oh, I get it now.

457
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:33,628
You're doing the black-guy character
because I'm a black guy, right?

458
00:21:33,673 --> 00:21:36,641
Black man doin' his thing, baby.
Barack Obama, motherfucker.

459
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:39,369
Barack Obama, "I'm the president,
I'm hitting that ass."

460
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:42,275
Look, that's not cool, man, all right?
Actually, it's kind of offensive.

461
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:43,972
Don't do it, okay?

462
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,206
Black man's doin' his motherfucking
thing in the world, baby.

463
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:48,771
- You feel me?
- Actually, I said, "Don't talk to me like that,"

464
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:51,112
okay? It's offensive.
I thought you were calling back

465
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,174
to apologize about
what you said to my wife!

466
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:55,185
You have your wife back, man.
I don't want the bitch no more.

467
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:56,981
I just said I hit it
and I quit it, man.

468
00:21:57,019 --> 00:22:00,215
Can't believe you, man.
I cannot fucking believe you!

469
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:02,688
- I done moved on, dawg.
- Fuck you, Larry!

470
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,059
- Hey, Larry!
- Hey.

471
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,185
- Hey, you took my phone, man.
- What?!

472
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,854
- You got my phone.
- I have your phone?

473
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:14,158
Yeah, our phones got all mixed up, man.
You got my phone

474
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:16,288
- and I got your phone.
- How do you know?

475
00:22:16,331 --> 00:22:18,298
I'm trying to call my boos, man.
Gonna use speed dial,

476
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:19,799
I'm getting
all these old-ass people.

477
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,631
- Hey, sorry.
- Anybody phone me?

478
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:27,104
No, uh-uh.

479
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,332
Anybody call me
from Woodcrest Financial?

480
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,575
- No.
- Hmm. Okay.

481
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,974
- Anybody call me?
- No.

482
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,705
Guy named Hal call?

483
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:45,006
- Nope.
- Okay.

484
00:22:45,048 --> 00:22:47,413
- Give me my phone.
- Give me my phone.

485
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,975
Mmm!
Humph.

486
00:22:51,018 --> 00:22:52,780
I'll get that.

487
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:56,015
- Hi.
- Hey.

488
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:58,578
- I'm here for Larry.
- Come on in, man.

489
00:22:58,623 --> 00:23:01,887
Come all up
in here.

490
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,721
- Hey, Larry! What's your name, man?
- Mike.

491
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,090
Hey, Larry,
Mike's down here for you.

492
00:23:06,127 --> 00:23:08,560
- I'll be right down.
- All right.

493
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:13,854
- So how you meet, Larry?
- Uh...

494
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:17,389
we met- I run
an extermination company

495
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,992
and I was working
at Mr. Greene's house

496
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,559
and Larry was there.

497
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:24,331
That's- that's
where I met him.

498
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:27,931
- You be killing them bugs, huh?
- Yeah, bugs, rodents...

499
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,770
all those-
all that.

500
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,470
So, um, what you and Larry
getting into tonight?

501
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,171
We're gonna see
a production of "Grease"

502
00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:40,874
- and maybe get a bite to eat or something.
- Mm-hmm.

503
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,808
L.D., my man.

504
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:52,984
- Hey.
- Hey.

505
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:56,251
- How's it going?
- Great. How- how you doing?

506
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,882
Good.

507
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:02,519
- You look nice.
- Oh, thanks.

508
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:05,824
So you-
you found it okay?

509
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:09,456
Yeah. Yeah yeah.
I've been here before.

510
00:24:09,498 --> 00:24:11,465
One of your neighbors
had an infestation.

511
00:24:11,499 --> 00:24:14,626
- Good.
- I already kind of know the area...

512
00:24:14,668 --> 00:24:18,466
- Ah.
- ... a little. Yeah, it was easy, heh.

513
00:24:21,438 --> 00:24:23,701
- Well, we should probably get going.
- Okay.

514
00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:25,535
- Sounds good. Nice meeting you.
- All right, man.

515
00:24:26,842 --> 00:24:30,571
Um, I- I'll be
a little late.

516
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,600
Have a good time.

517
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,982
Oh.
Uh, excuse me.

518
00:24:45,252 --> 00:24:48,118
Oh, oh...

519
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,951
this is my masseuse Lisa:
my son Larry.

520
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,751
- Hello, hi.
- Nice to meet you, Mr. David.

521
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,225
This is Mike the exterminator.
That's my dad.

522
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:58,453
- Hi, Mike.
- It's an honor, sir.

523
00:24:58,493 --> 00:24:59,754
That's Lisa
the masseuse.

524
00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:00,852
- Hello.
- Hello.

525
00:25:00,895 --> 00:25:04,420
- So nice to meet you two.
- Likewise.

526
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:06,090
How are you doing?

527
00:25:06,131 --> 00:25:07,791
- Hey.
- Sammie's big night.

528
00:25:07,832 --> 00:25:09,890
All excited.

529
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:11,991
- Yeah.
- You look good out of your uniform.

530
00:25:12,034 --> 00:25:13,399
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Huh?

531
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:16,164
- Pretty sharp, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

532
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:17,966
Appreciate it.

533
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:19,995
Hey, Jean.

534
00:25:21,273 --> 00:25:23,070
Yeah.

535
00:25:25,343 --> 00:25:27,776
- You called and insulted her husband Hal?
- What? Are you kidding?

536
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:30,642
What? I didn't talk to Hal.
No talk to Hal.

537
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:34,477
- Yes, you did, Larry. You called Hal-
- What?

538
00:25:34,514 --> 00:25:36,981
- You said racist remarks?
- What?

539
00:25:37,016 --> 00:25:38,744
- You're lying. You're a fucking liar!
- Who's saying that?

540
00:25:38,783 --> 00:25:40,773
- Are you saying that or she's saying that?
- I'm saying that.

541
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:43,285
- Oh, you're saying that! No talk, no talk.
- Don't play innocent.

542
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,719
Look her in the eye.
She knows.

543
00:25:46,755 --> 00:25:48,881
- You're a rotten apple.
- I'm not a rotten apple.

544
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,288
- Tell her I'm a good apple.
- I'm not telling her shit for you.

545
00:25:51,324 --> 00:25:53,416
I'm a good- good apple.

546
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:55,722
Good apple.

547
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,659
Fuck you.

548
00:25:57,694 --> 00:26:00,127
She talks?
What?

549
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,425
Good, you heard me!

550
00:26:03,698 --> 00:26:05,665
You too!

551
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:09,156
What the hell
did you do, sicko?

552
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:11,669
What does he get her
all upset like that for?

553
00:26:11,703 --> 00:26:14,431
- Shh.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

554
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:17,871
"Grease" is about to begin.
Please turn off all cell phones.

555
00:26:17,907 --> 00:26:19,373
Thank you.

556
00:26:20,975 --> 00:26:23,465
- It's a rat!
- What?!

557
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,500
I got it, I got it, I got it.

558
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:28,068
I got it. I got it. I got it.
Look out, look out.

559
00:26:34,216 --> 00:26:36,615
It's not a rat!
It's a dog!

560
00:26:36,651 --> 00:26:39,084
It's a dog!
Oh my God, it's a dog!

561
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,484
It's a dog!

562
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,916
Oh, God...

563
00:26:45,957 --> 00:26:49,083
it's a rat.
It's a rat.

564
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:56,395
- What did you do to him?
- It's a rat.

565
00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:00,759
Well, yeah.

566
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:05,224
- This is it.
- Yeah. Uh, that was...

567
00:27:05,268 --> 00:27:06,757
- that was pretty fun.
- Yeah.

568
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:10,134
Yeah, was- feels,
feels good. It was fun.

569
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,570
It was a little weird
with that dog.

570
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:15,437
- You know, that's your training.
- Yeah, you know?

571
00:27:15,473 --> 00:27:18,441
You-you reacted.
That was- it was- it was instinctual.

572
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:21,307
- Yeah, I'd do it again, you know?
- Absolutely.

573
00:27:21,344 --> 00:27:24,437
- Ahem.
- Yeah, it's just- it's unfortunate.

574
00:27:24,479 --> 00:27:28,277
- It was a dog.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's the bad part.

575
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:31,750
Uh, it's sad that we didn't
get to see the show.

576
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:34,411
Yeah, I would've liked to have seen it.
I was looking forward to it.

577
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:37,977
Me too, a lot.
If they happen to redo it,

578
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,954
I'll go if you want.

579
00:27:40,989 --> 00:27:42,888
- All right, we'll see.
- Okay.

580
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:44,890
What are you
gonna do?

581
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:47,949
- I'm just gonna go in.
- Okay.

582
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:50,222
All right.
Yeah, okay.

583
00:27:50,261 --> 00:27:52,387
- Bye.
- All right, take it easy.

584
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:54,226
- See ya.
- Bye.

585
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,599
- Hi, honey.
- Hello.

586
00:28:07,638 --> 00:28:09,537
- How are you doing?
- I don't feel well.

587
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:10,664
- No?
- No.

588
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:13,868
- I made you some toast.
- Oh, really?

589
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:16,001
- You want-
- How's the new toaster?

590
00:28:16,043 --> 00:28:17,737
It's great.

591
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:21,769
- Oh, goodness.
- I feel so awful.

592
00:28:21,813 --> 00:28:25,248
- Oh, no.
- Oh, man, I've got a headache.

593
00:28:25,282 --> 00:28:27,511
Oh.

594
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,414
- Do I have a fever?
- I think you do.

595
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:30,781
- Really?
- Yeah.

596
00:28:30,818 --> 00:28:32,786
I don't feel well, honey.

597
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,514
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Really?

598
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:36,384
- I'm gonna take very good care of you.
- You are?

599
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:38,445
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

600
00:28:38,489 --> 00:28:40,480
Thank you, honey.

601
00:28:41,725 --> 00:28:44,591
What are you doing?

602
00:28:44,626 --> 00:28:46,286
No good?
