1
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:15,595
It's a mystery to me...

2
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:17,960
how could you
have lived

3
00:00:17,997 --> 00:00:21,363
with that maniac for that long?

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,890
- I don't know.
- Huh?

5
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:26,300
- I don't know.
- How did you do it?

6
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:29,134
'Cause, you know,
I'm not that guy anymore.

7
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:30,469
- No?
- No.

8
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:32,599
Honestly, you don't look
like that guy anymore.

9
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:34,609
Look, look how much
I've changed.

10
00:00:34,643 --> 00:00:36,610
- Did I ever dress like this?
- No.

11
00:00:36,644 --> 00:00:38,635
- Your shirt's tucked in.
- I'm tucking in.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,274
- You've got real shoes on.
- Shoes, slacks.

13
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:44,044
You look like
a real person,

14
00:00:44,084 --> 00:00:47,484
- not an eighth-grader with silly shoes.
- Yeah.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
I used to walk around in sneakers
like an eighth-grader.

16
00:00:49,954 --> 00:00:53,446
I have to say,
I love the new Larry.

17
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,287
- Really?
- Yeah.

18
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:56,816
- You know what I wanna do?
- Hmm?

19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,554
I want to travel
with you...

20
00:00:58,594 --> 00:01:00,186
a little traveling
in Europe maybe,

21
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:02,628
you know, bicycles-
all that stuff you wanted to do...

22
00:01:02,664 --> 00:01:04,460
- Yeah.
- ... that you used to ask me about,

23
00:01:04,499 --> 00:01:06,898
and "No no,
I don't wanna do that:

24
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:09,027
there's no golf courses
nearby..."

25
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,537
I don't give a shit
about golf anymore.

26
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,435
I just want
to be with you.

27
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:18,340
And you know what else?
And I know you love scuba diving.

28
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:20,742
I never did that with you. You always
wanted to go scuba diving.

29
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:23,406
- I know.
- You know, I can't see underwater

30
00:01:23,447 --> 00:01:26,211
'cause, you know...
But whatever,

31
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:29,945
I'll feel around
for the fish, you know.

32
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:32,214
Well, it seems like
you've done a lot of reflecting.

33
00:01:32,254 --> 00:01:34,915
I'm a completely
changed man.

34
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:37,219
The only vestige
of my old self

35
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:40,282
is that I've still got
the good breath, you know.

36
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:41,725
That's the thing
you're keeping?

37
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:44,456
The new Larry's keeping
the minty breath, yeah.

38
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:46,464
The old Larry
you're getting rid of?

39
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:48,897
He's over.
He's over.

40
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,902
You know, he hated
your sister...

41
00:01:51,936 --> 00:01:53,368
He did?

42
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,604
You know what?
Forget that Larry.

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,766
He's dead.
He's dead.

44
00:02:00,809 --> 00:02:02,776
He's completely dead.

45
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,641
Anyway,

46
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:07,476
it's really good
to see you.

47
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:09,344
It is good
to see you too.

48
00:02:09,383 --> 00:02:12,180
It's very impressive
that you're...

49
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:15,050
- Really?
- -that you're trying. It is.

50
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:17,815
- I really am trying.
- I know. I can see that.

51
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:20,619
- I really am.
- I know.

52
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:23,250
Hey, let's go to the movies
tomorrow night...

53
00:02:23,293 --> 00:02:25,385
movies, dinner.

54
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,794
Come on, I'll take you out
to dinner.

55
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,730
Um, I would love to go
to the movies and dinner.

56
00:02:31,766 --> 00:02:33,199
Really?

57
00:02:33,234 --> 00:02:34,758
Let me just talk
to my therapist

58
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,826
and see what she
has to say first.

59
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,832
I just want to make sure
she feels good

60
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,466
- about that.
- Mm-hmm.

61
00:02:43,508 --> 00:02:46,375
I'll call my therapist and see
what she says and I'll call you.

62
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:48,037
Great.

63
00:02:48,078 --> 00:02:50,568
Hey, how much are we supposed to tip
the bartender, by the way?

64
00:02:50,613 --> 00:02:53,139
Don't they make too much money?
I mean, everybody buys a drink.

65
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:55,650
They get, what,
20% of every drink?

66
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:57,174
That's insane, isn't it?

67
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,243
Well, they work
really hard.

68
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:05,017
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's good.

69
00:03:05,058 --> 00:03:07,491
They're on their feet
all night,

70
00:03:07,527 --> 00:03:11,326
so whatever.
Whatever they make- good for them.

71
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:13,830
They work hard,
you know.

72
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:18,129
It could not
have gone better.

73
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,465
It was amazing.

74
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:21,162
I showed up in-
you know,

75
00:03:21,203 --> 00:03:23,068
I was tucked in,
I had shoes on.

76
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,005
She never likes
the way I dress,

77
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,439
but she noticed
the tucked-in

78
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:29,271
and she was very
impressed with that.

79
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:31,073
I looked like a man,
you know.

80
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:33,306
This is great stuff.
It's great progress.

81
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,439
- Yeah.
- I have to say, it's not surprising,

82
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,711
because I'd like to think
I know what I'm doing.

83
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,945
And, oh, I said-
I was talking about the future...

84
00:03:40,985 --> 00:03:42,747
if we get back together,
what I want to do:

85
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:44,754
I want to travel
with her,

86
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:46,983
you know, on bicycles.

87
00:03:47,024 --> 00:03:49,651
Scuba diving- in a zillion years
wouldn't I go,

88
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,057
but, you know what?
I would do it with her. I really would.

89
00:03:52,093 --> 00:03:54,061
Be enthusiastic,
but don't make

90
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:56,324
any specific promises
that you can't fulfill.

91
00:03:56,364 --> 00:03:57,591
That's my own
personal advice.

92
00:03:57,631 --> 00:04:00,827
Geez, I said a lot
of stuff last night.

93
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,630
Let's deal with that
when it arises.

94
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:05,159
Oh, I might be bicycling in France
in a couple of months.

95
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,468
Again, let's focus
on the next stage.

96
00:04:07,506 --> 00:04:09,473
Well, here's the thing:
I asked her

97
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:12,772
to go to the movies
tonight, okay?

98
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,470
And the therapist
gave her the green light,

99
00:04:14,511 --> 00:04:17,035
so we're going
to dinner and a movie,

100
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,205
or a movie and a dinner,
depending on the starting time.

101
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:21,010
Sometimes it works out you go
to a dinner and a movie,

102
00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:22,846
sometimes it's better to have dinner
after the movie,

103
00:04:22,883 --> 00:04:24,874
- so you have something to talk about.
- Movie, dinner.

104
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:26,909
Let's not even waste time
talking about that.

105
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,181
- Movie, dinner.
- Movie, dinner.

106
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:29,984
So you take her
to a movie...

107
00:04:30,022 --> 00:04:31,717
after you do the movie,
just reach over,

108
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:34,316
grab her hand,
hold it tenderly

109
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,919
and tell her,
"I love you."

110
00:04:37,928 --> 00:04:39,623
Really?

111
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:41,994
- Whisper into her ear, "I love you."
- Okay.

112
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,828
At that point
she's feeling vulnerable.

113
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,995
And then at dinner-
that's when you have to up the stakes.

114
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,730
That's when you have to tell her you
want her to move back in with you

115
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,637
and she has until Monday
to decide,

116
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:55,436
or that's it.

117
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:57,466
It works.
That's all I can say.

118
00:04:59,044 --> 00:05:02,502
Wow.
Wow.

119
00:05:02,548 --> 00:05:04,242
She might not like it
at first,

120
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:06,250
but there's one thing
she won't be able to say,

121
00:05:06,284 --> 00:05:08,843
is that the guy who just said that
is a pussy.

122
00:05:10,354 --> 00:05:12,617
No one likes a pussy.

123
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:15,145
What, you're getting
a lot of pussy from me?

124
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:18,626
Not an amount
that is not manageable.

125
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,627
That's why
we have to say,

126
00:05:20,661 --> 00:05:22,629
"Monday is
the cutoff point:

127
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:25,426
Either we're back on,
move back in,

128
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:27,194
or Monday- whew."

129
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:30,257
Okay okay.
I think I got it.

130
00:05:30,302 --> 00:05:31,735
Although I gotta say,

131
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:34,636
being a pussy really wasn't
my problem with her.

132
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:36,605
It was more the fact
that I was selfish

133
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,540
- and kind of thoughtless...
- We have to stop.

134
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,143
Oh, okay.

135
00:05:43,711 --> 00:05:46,237
Huh.
I thought I had...

136
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,010
We have to stop.

137
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,650
Go, whew-
go get 'em.

138
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,381
Okay.

139
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,149
Je t'aime.

140
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:02,325
Je t'aime aussi...

141
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:25,533
I love you.

142
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:41,254
I gotta tell ya, the new Larry
is really working for me.

143
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:43,256
Let me tell you
something, okay?

144
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,191
The new Larry can really
make you happy.

145
00:06:46,226 --> 00:06:49,093
I really can.
I know I can.

146
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,095
Just the idea of you
wanting me to be happy

147
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,257
is amazing.

148
00:06:53,298 --> 00:06:55,858
Not just happy,
but really, like, delirious.

149
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,425
- Delirious?
- Delirious.

150
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,596
- Hi.
- What a surprise!

151
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:03,970
Is this
what I think it is?

152
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,974
Well, we're just...

153
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,202
- Having dinner.
- ... having dinner, talking.

154
00:07:08,242 --> 00:07:11,040
This is
one great picture.

155
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,069
I love it.

156
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:15,880
It's good
to see you guys.

157
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:17,542
Hey, can I ask you
for a quick favor?

158
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:21,313
Nan's dad Dan
has Alzheimer's...

159
00:07:21,354 --> 00:07:23,184
Really?
Oh.

160
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:26,748
We're having a five-mile walkathon
at Venice beach.

161
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,621
I need you to sponsor me.
Jeff's doing it.

162
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,820
$50 a mile-
250 bucks.

163
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:32,452
So you want me
to sponsor you?

164
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,053
Yeah, sure.
250 bucks.

165
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:35,893
"Larry David,"
right there.

166
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:37,762
It's worth it,
believe me.

167
00:07:37,799 --> 00:07:39,231
You don't know
what Alzheimer's is.

168
00:07:39,266 --> 00:07:41,131
- He's got it bad.
- Really?

169
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,601
What does he do?

170
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:44,605
He runs around the house
all day naked,

171
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,605
chasing himself,
playing tag.

172
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,266
- It's awful.
- Really truly?

173
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:50,366
He screams at the cat
'cause she didn't vote.

174
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:52,434
Wow.

175
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:55,002
Every time he farts,
he calls the fire department.

176
00:07:55,046 --> 00:07:58,378
Just sign it, please.
Don't make me beg you.

177
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:00,382
You know...

178
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:03,282
It is a great cause.

179
00:08:03,318 --> 00:08:05,980
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

180
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:07,955
- That's great.
- Of course. It's a damn good cause.

181
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:10,821
- Oh, thank you, honey. Whoa.
- Thank you very much.

182
00:08:10,858 --> 00:08:12,917
- Yeah.
- There you go- 25 bucks.

183
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,325
- Thank you, Larry.
- Great to see you too again.

184
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,589
It's good to see you guys.

185
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,459
Thanks.

186
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,794
It's so nice of you
to sponsor him.

187
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:22,799
Come on, what is it?
$250?

188
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:26,063
I know, but I feel like
usually you would complain

189
00:08:26,102 --> 00:08:29,196
or, I don't know,
give him a hard time, but...

190
00:08:29,239 --> 00:08:31,103
- Old Larry.
- I know.

191
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,835
I feel like you are
a different person.

192
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:36,775
Honey, I am
a different person.

193
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:40,909
I'm so different.

194
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:43,040
Listen...

195
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:49,009
I want you
to move back in with me.

196
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:52,754
You have till Monday

197
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:55,223
to decide.

198
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,226
Monday?

199
00:08:57,259 --> 00:09:00,319
Yeah, Monday.

200
00:09:00,362 --> 00:09:02,353
Then the offer's
off the table.

201
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,857
You're giving me
an ultimatum?

202
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,334
What...?

203
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,166
- Oh my God. You know what?
- Oh, okay.

204
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:14,104
- You don't have to wait till Monday.
- Okay, so...

205
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:16,402
- Guess what? The answer is no.
- Okay, there's no ultimatum.

206
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,932
- You're never going to change, Larry.
- Take your time.

207
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,239
- You obviously have no idea.
- Take a month, I don't care.

208
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,246
- Don't call me, please, ever.
- What?

209
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,610
No!

210
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:28,079
Hey, Cheryl.

211
00:09:28,117 --> 00:09:30,141
Cheryl.

212
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:32,153
Cheryl, the therapist
told me to say that.

213
00:09:32,187 --> 00:09:34,211
- Oh, really?
- I want you to move in. I do love you.

214
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:36,414
You know what, Larry?
I thought the new Larry didn't lie.

215
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,424
- I'm not lying.
- Oh, really?

216
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,823
The therapist said that.
He gave me the deadline.

217
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,986
I'm so stupid.
I was actually believing you.

218
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:44,859
No, believe me.
That was all true,

219
00:09:44,896 --> 00:09:46,590
except for
the deadline part.

220
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,654
The therapist told me
to say that.

221
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:50,131
Cheryl!

222
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:52,964
But the deadline...

223
00:09:53,002 --> 00:09:55,231
Agh! Agh!

224
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,601
Agh-hh!

225
00:09:58,873 --> 00:10:00,841
Oh.

226
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,535
You ruined my life.

227
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:05,739
You ruined
my life, okay?

228
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:08,246
- Okay.
- Give her an ultimatum?

229
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,805
- Whoa, okay.
- What the fuck was that?

230
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,909
- I was this close, this close!
- Larry, you're angry.

231
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:15,441
She's gone.

232
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,920
It's a setback.
It's a setback.

233
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:20,548
I told you she wasn't bothered
by the high pussy percentage,

234
00:10:20,591 --> 00:10:22,921
- but you didn't listen to me.
- We ran out of time.

235
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,826
I had to see someone else
who was suicidal.

236
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:29,659
You know what we're going to do now?
We're going to go to her house

237
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:32,290
and you're going to tell her
that the whole thing was your idea.

238
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,664
Okay, let's have
a session.

239
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,564
No, I don't want
to have a session.

240
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:38,695
You're going to tell her that you told me
to give her that stupid ultimatum.

241
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,728
Larry?

242
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,674
Sorry for popping in
on you like this.

243
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:49,337
- Hello, I'm Dr. Bright.
- This is my therapist.

244
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:51,073
- Hi, I'm Cheryl.
- Could we come in

245
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:53,103
- and talk to you for just a few minutes?
- Larry...

246
00:10:53,148 --> 00:10:54,740
It won't take long.

247
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:57,881
I guess so.

248
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:59,886
Come on in.

249
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:02,219
Thanks.

250
00:11:06,491 --> 00:11:08,459
Wow.

251
00:11:08,493 --> 00:11:10,289
You're on the ocean?

252
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,453
Yeah.

253
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:13,463
Wow, this is...

254
00:11:13,497 --> 00:11:16,192
these places are expensive,
on the water, aren't they?

255
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:18,200
My therapist said

256
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:20,997
that I should do
something nice for myself,

257
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:23,095
sort of a love-me gift.

258
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:24,798
And I decided,
you know what?

259
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,807
I've always wanted
to live on the beach.

260
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:28,967
I can do it now,
so...

261
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,374
- Very good advice.
- Yeah.

262
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,344
Oh, you think so?

263
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:35,175
Mm.

264
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:37,807
I don't remember you telling me
to get any love-me gifts.

265
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:40,043
- We were moving onto that at some point.
- Oh, really?

266
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,483
- We would have arrived at that.
- Oh, interesting.

267
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:45,214
So what do you guys
need to tell me?

268
00:11:45,254 --> 00:11:47,915
- Go ahead, Bright.
- Okay.

269
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:51,448
I gave Larry
some flawed advice.

270
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:53,460
I told Larry to give you
an ultimatum.

271
00:11:53,494 --> 00:11:54,961
He told me
to say that.

272
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:56,519
You told him
to say that?

273
00:11:56,564 --> 00:11:59,464
Yeah, because the picture
that was painted of you

274
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:01,433
was not the person
I'm seeing...

275
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:04,161
- What?
- Well, no no no. I mean that you...

276
00:12:04,202 --> 00:12:06,170
What does that mean?

277
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:07,637
I think-
I don't know.

278
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:09,640
I just had-
it means nothing.

279
00:12:09,674 --> 00:12:11,106
- What did you think?
- I thought maybe

280
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,506
you were the kind of person
who would like an ultimatum.

281
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,840
- And you're not, clearly.
- What kind of picture

282
00:12:15,878 --> 00:12:18,869
- are you painting of me?
- Just a loving portrayal.

283
00:12:18,913 --> 00:12:21,211
It was- it was a deeply
loving portrayal.

284
00:12:21,249 --> 00:12:22,579
But- but...

285
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,276
What have I been saying
about her?

286
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:26,649
You didn't describe her
physically...

287
00:12:26,686 --> 00:12:28,483
so I didn't know
what she looked like.

288
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:31,318
That's why I'm just saying, whoo!
I'm just impressed.

289
00:12:31,356 --> 00:12:33,847
Why would it matter what
somebody looks like physically...

290
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:38,260
- what kind of advice-?
- You get the face you deserve, right?

291
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:40,262
The face tells a story.

292
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:42,229
All right, all right.
The point is,

293
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:45,062
you get an idea of the person
who I've been listening to here?

294
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:47,193
- Is it coming through to you?
- Yeah.

295
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:49,499
So you told Larry
to give me an ultimatum.

296
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:50,834
Fine, okay.
Now I know that.

297
00:12:50,872 --> 00:12:52,930
- Okay?
- He is to blame.

298
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,941
I'm 90% to blame
for everything.

299
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:58,170
90%? I think 100%.
100% to blame.

300
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,177
Well, I'm taking
the lion's share.

301
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:02,839
No, take more than the lion's share.
Take the whole share.

302
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:04,781
Take it all.

303
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:07,078
Okay, all right.
No, that's fair.

304
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:09,084
Yeah, I'm 100% to blame.

305
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:11,086
I told Larry
to do the...

306
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,780
to hold your hand,
to say, "I love you."

307
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:15,415
- The new Larry- it's all me.
- All right, no no no.

308
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:17,015
The new Larry is you?

309
00:13:17,058 --> 00:13:18,957
What?
What did you say?

310
00:13:18,992 --> 00:13:21,120
You're not responsible
for the new Larry.

311
00:13:21,161 --> 00:13:23,059
I'm the new- you didn't make
the new Larry.

312
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:24,619
You told me
to take 100%.

313
00:13:24,663 --> 00:13:26,359
I invented the new Larry,
not you.

314
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,229
What about tucking in
the T-shirt?

315
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,131
You didn't tell me-
you told me to tuck in?

316
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,396
All right, I understand
what you're saying.

317
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:34,733
I'm going to talk
to Dr. Salvin

318
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:36,533
and figure it out,
so thanks.

319
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,540
All right.
Okay.

320
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:40,667
All right, thanks for coming,
I guess.

321
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:42,175
Why are you taking
credit for new Larry?

322
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,700
I laid the foundation
for new Larry.

323
00:13:43,745 --> 00:13:45,713
Bullshit-
you laid foundation.

324
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:50,444
You're a moron. How could you
suggest such a thing?

325
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:52,110
It's not
an exact science.

326
00:13:52,151 --> 00:13:54,551
- And I mean...
- Clearly.

327
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:57,419
I mean, that is unbelievable, seriously.

328
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:59,718
The thing about it
is that...

329
00:13:59,757 --> 00:14:03,249
she doesn't make a move now
in her life

330
00:14:03,293 --> 00:14:05,352
unless her therapist
tells her.

331
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:08,659
But the therapist
doesn't know anything about me.

332
00:14:08,697 --> 00:14:10,755
- I'm not represented there.
- No, you're not.

333
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:14,598
- If the therapist knew me, okay?
- Mm.

334
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:17,159
If the therapist thought
I was a terrific guy,

335
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:19,501
- there would be a counterargument to it.
- Right.

336
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:21,473
How do you get to her?

337
00:14:27,645 --> 00:14:29,168
I got it.
Let's go.

338
00:14:29,212 --> 00:14:31,180
Come on.

339
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,647
- Come on, Bright.
- Yeah, okay.

340
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:36,015
So you jump out,

341
00:14:36,051 --> 00:14:38,281
you grab
the therapist's purse.

342
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,288
Then I come
out of nowhere,

343
00:14:40,322 --> 00:14:43,222
I tackle you,
take you down,

344
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,225
get the purse
from you.

345
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,226
You run off,
you get yourself

346
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,591
a cup of coffee,
a piece of pizza.

347
00:14:49,628 --> 00:14:51,858
And I return
the handbag

348
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:56,390
and I'm like a god,
you know.

349
00:14:56,434 --> 00:14:57,958
Pshh, I'll do that shit.

350
00:14:58,001 --> 00:15:00,401
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I'll do it. What the fuck?

351
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:01,801
You're my motherfucking man,
Larry.

352
00:15:01,837 --> 00:15:04,327
Is he the greatest?
Are you the greatest, man?

353
00:15:04,373 --> 00:15:06,567
- What's up? That's how we do it, yo.
- You are the greatest.

354
00:15:06,607 --> 00:15:07,904
That's how we
fucking do it.

355
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:09,500
I walk by,
I grab the fucking purse.

356
00:15:09,543 --> 00:15:11,443
I run down the street,
Larry pops the fuck out,

357
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:13,308
tackles me, tries to get
the purse back.

358
00:15:13,347 --> 00:15:15,406
I fuck Larry up,
I keep on rolling.

359
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,177
You...

360
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,774
Somebody gotta get
fucked up, Larry, right?

361
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,478
You don't need to-
what are you saying, fuck me up?

362
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,248
When you tackle me I ain't going
to look like a fucking bitch and shit,

363
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:25,755
- let you fuck me up.
- No. I tackle you

364
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:27,620
and then you run away.
You run away.

365
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,989
The more fucked up you are, the more
of a hero you're gonna look like.

366
00:15:30,025 --> 00:15:32,187
I'm going to break your fucking teeth,
your glasses or something.

367
00:15:32,228 --> 00:15:34,422
Leon, I don't need to look
like that much of a hero.

368
00:15:34,463 --> 00:15:36,658
Just stopping you and giving her
her purse back's enough.

369
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:38,596
There's no way in hell.
You can't do that shit half-speed.

370
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:40,861
It's not realistic, Larry,
if I don't fuck you up.

371
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,358
- Hey, who's this?
- Hello, I'm Dr. Bright.

372
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:47,429
That's my therapist
I was telling you about.

373
00:15:47,473 --> 00:15:49,440
- Oh, is this Mr. Ultimatum?
- Yeah.

374
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:52,534
Yo, man, that idea
you came up with was awful.

375
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:55,067
So what's
going on, L.D.?

376
00:15:55,112 --> 00:15:57,546
Nothing.
Nothing really.

377
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,673
What's happening?
What's happening, Leon?

378
00:16:01,282 --> 00:16:04,341
- Larry wants me to mug somebody.
- Who? Who?

379
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:06,785
- Yeah, but it's a pretend mugging.
- It's pretend.

380
00:16:06,821 --> 00:16:07,979
It's all for fun.

381
00:16:08,021 --> 00:16:09,819
I know you're not
going along with that.

382
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:12,517
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.
I'ma grab the fucking purse...

383
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:14,718
- Leon!
- Larry's going to jump out, try to stop me,

384
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,694
- I'ma fuck Larry up...
- You're not gonna fuck me up.

385
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:20,356
- You done lost your mind, Leon.
- You done lost your mind.

386
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:27,661
I'll tell you what:
He's not doing it!

387
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:29,102
You know what?

388
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:31,264
This pasty-ass motherfucker
got you into it.

389
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:33,295
Have him get your ass
out of it.

390
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,311
She's right.

391
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,313
I'll do it.

392
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:43,780
Eh, fuck it.

393
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:49,615
There's her therapist.

394
00:16:49,653 --> 00:16:52,280
Okay okay, that's her.
You see her?

395
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:54,050
Yeah, okay.
All right, let's go.

396
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,853
What are you doing?
What is this?

397
00:16:55,892 --> 00:16:58,291
You look like a rapist with that
thing on. You don't need that.

398
00:16:58,326 --> 00:17:00,055
You know what?
Put the hood up.

399
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:01,789
Isn't that a cliche?

400
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,694
- It's not a cliche. Put the hood up.
- All right.

401
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,130
All right, good.
What?

402
00:17:06,166 --> 00:17:08,100
I've changed my mind.
I can't do it. I can't do it.

403
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,336
Go do it.

404
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,270
- Give me your bag. I'm mugging you.
- No. No.

405
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:15,670
I got it!
I got it!

406
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:20,433
Oh my God.

407
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:25,002
Now run!

408
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:26,480
- Thank you.
- You'd better run!

409
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:28,482
Oh my...

410
00:17:28,516 --> 00:17:30,483
Here you are.

411
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:32,484
Thank you.

412
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,918
That was amazing.
You came out of nowhere.

413
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:36,978
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- I didn't even see you.

414
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,786
Yeah, we're-
we're okay.

415
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:42,419
Do what
you have to do.

416
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,724
How did you-
how did you do that?

417
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,820
I never even saw you...

418
00:17:46,864 --> 00:17:49,923
What was I going to do?
I saw that

419
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:52,661
and I had
to do something.

420
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:54,692
I can't believe
what I just witnessed.

421
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,703
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart.

422
00:17:56,737 --> 00:17:58,102
Well, you're welcome.

423
00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:00,538
You take good care
of yourself, okay?

424
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:02,201
Thank you.
I'm a little shaken.

425
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:04,266
Shake it off. Go get yourself
a drink or something.

426
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,743
- Yeah.
- Okay.

427
00:18:05,778 --> 00:18:10,146
Wait, I never even
asked your name.

428
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:15,445
It's Larry...

429
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:17,886
Larry David.

430
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:21,351
Larry David?

431
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:26,655
Very funny.
Spread your legs.

432
00:18:26,694 --> 00:18:29,424
That was amazing.
I mean, the way you swept in

433
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:31,760
and took control-
that didn't seem real.

434
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:34,823
It was real.
I can tell you that.

435
00:18:34,867 --> 00:18:36,858
I'm still a little shaky,
I guess.

436
00:18:36,901 --> 00:18:40,337
- It's to be expected. My God.
- That guy...

437
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:43,204
- that strange, horrible man...
- Horrible.

438
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,935
But you were just like
Clint Eastwood.

439
00:18:45,975 --> 00:18:49,035
I mean, you just
swept in there and...

440
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:51,739
I have never seen
anything that brave.

441
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,746
Eh, please, really.

442
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,874
I didn't even
think twice about it.

443
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,817
The only thing I did think about
for a second was my glasses,

444
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:01,376
but that's it- only the
safety of my glasses.

445
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,853
'Cause these are
irreplaceable.

446
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:06,187
What do you do,
may I ask?

447
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:08,191
Oh, I'm a therapist.

448
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:09,749
- You're a therapist?
- Yes.

449
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:12,386
Oh, boy, I could really
use a therapist myself.

450
00:19:12,428 --> 00:19:16,090
My wife left me
after a long time and...

451
00:19:16,131 --> 00:19:18,565
I'm not going to bother you
with all this, you know.

452
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,567
That's all right.
Please.

453
00:19:20,601 --> 00:19:24,059
Well, my wife
left the house recently

454
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,902
and it's been
quite devas...

455
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,601
- I'm sure it's-
- It's been quite devastating for me,

456
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:31,007
but anyway...

457
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,566
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

458
00:19:32,611 --> 00:19:35,009
But I feel like
she never really

459
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:37,275
had any idea
who I was.

460
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:39,282
All this time,
all these years,

461
00:19:39,316 --> 00:19:41,648
I really hid
the real me,

462
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:45,414
the me who saves people.

463
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:48,217
And, you know, I have been
doing that most of my life.

464
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,382
You know, I gave
a kidney to my friend...

465
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:52,255
Oh, I didn't know that.

466
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:53,782
Why would you?

467
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:57,420
No, I wouldn't.
I just...

468
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,987
All right, well,
I gotta go.

469
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,727
You are
such a good person.

470
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:05,166
Do you know that?

471
00:20:05,202 --> 00:20:07,170
- Am I?
- Oh...

472
00:20:07,204 --> 00:20:08,831
Yes.

473
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,531
Okay.

474
00:20:12,574 --> 00:20:14,668
So great
to have met you.

475
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,835
Yes.

476
00:20:15,878 --> 00:20:17,867
I'd better get going.

477
00:20:20,714 --> 00:20:22,614
You take care
of yourself.

478
00:20:22,648 --> 00:20:24,912
Well, thanks again.

479
00:20:24,951 --> 00:20:27,976
So long.

480
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,681
Goodbye, Larry David.

481
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:38,955
Oh, wow.
Hey.

482
00:20:43,365 --> 00:20:45,730
How are you doing?

483
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,359
Well, I'm in prison.

484
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:50,426
Yeah. Jesus.

485
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,096
I spent the night
in a cell

486
00:20:52,137 --> 00:20:54,697
that's smaller
than my closet.

487
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,503
Oh, man, oh, man.
I'm so sorry.

488
00:20:57,543 --> 00:20:59,271
My feet stick out
through the fucking bars.

489
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,140
- Your feet stick out?
- Yeah, my feet stick out.

490
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:03,202
- You're not even that tall.
- I know. I know.

491
00:21:03,247 --> 00:21:05,408
I'm not even that tall,
and my fucking feet stick out.

492
00:21:05,448 --> 00:21:07,416
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

493
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,781
- You're 5'10"?
- Yeah.

494
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:11,911
You're 5'10"?
Stand up. Let me see.

495
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:14,512
- You're not 5'10".
- I'm 5'10", I am.

496
00:21:14,555 --> 00:21:16,819
Well, a hairsbreadth
under.

497
00:21:16,857 --> 00:21:18,825
You're cheating a little bit.
I don't think you're 5'10".

498
00:21:18,858 --> 00:21:20,689
In the heel, I am-
that's not the point.

499
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,353
The point is
I'm sharing a room

500
00:21:22,394 --> 00:21:25,488
with a 300-Ib fucking guy
with a hairy back.

501
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,054
Sometimes you make friends
in a situation like this.

502
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,896
They become
your friend for life.

503
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:32,128
He doesn't
speak English.

504
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:34,830
Okay, all right.

505
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:38,533
Oh, good news:

506
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:41,007
After you were
taken away...

507
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,338
Uh-huh.

508
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:44,504
...the therapist and I
went to have coffee...

509
00:21:44,544 --> 00:21:47,411
whew, the plan worked
fantastic.

510
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,505
I'm pretty optimistic.
And you know what?

511
00:21:49,548 --> 00:21:52,345
Thank you. 'Cause you were
there at its inception.

512
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:54,375
You pushed it through.

513
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:57,354
I'm very happy for you,

514
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:59,754
but it's not top of the list
of my priorities right now.

515
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:02,690
We're going to get you out of here.
Don't worry about it.

516
00:22:02,725 --> 00:22:04,453
Do we have a time frame?
Can you give me a time frame?

517
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:07,360
- 24 hours...
- Okay, I think I can...

518
00:22:07,396 --> 00:22:10,091
...48 at the most.

519
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,656
- What's after 48? 72?
- 72, yeah.

520
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,964
58, 68- right, 72.
And then...

521
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:17,525
Don't say "and then..."

522
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:20,037
What do you mean, 72?
That's beyond what...

523
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,800
...96?

524
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:23,932
Please, let's aim
for 24.

525
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,532
You got
a deck of cards?

526
00:22:25,575 --> 00:22:27,475
Can you play solitaire or anything?
What can you do here?

527
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:30,070
I don't have a deck of cards, but yes,
I do know how to play solitaire.

528
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:32,444
I should have brought a deck of cards.
Damn it. It's always good

529
00:22:32,481 --> 00:22:34,745
to have a deck of cards,
no matter where you are.

530
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:37,752
What are you talking about?
Just get me out of fucking prison.

531
00:22:37,785 --> 00:22:39,150
I'm not talking
about cards.

532
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:40,949
Just get me out of
fucking prison, please.

533
00:22:40,988 --> 00:22:43,649
I'm sorry,
we're going to have to stop.

534
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:46,250
We have more time.

535
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:48,020
Cheryl's getting out
of her therapy appointment

536
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,493
and I really need
to talk to her.

537
00:22:49,528 --> 00:22:52,052
I've not spoken to anyone normal
in 24 hours

538
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:53,723
and I'm scared.

539
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:55,754
We have to stop.

540
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:05,362
- Hello?
- Oh, hi, Cheryl.

541
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:07,374
How did your session
go today?

542
00:23:07,408 --> 00:23:09,500
Larry, I've spoken
to my therapist

543
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:12,238
and she told me I shouldn't ever be
speaking to you again.

544
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,245
She said that?

545
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:16,771
Yeah. I'm sorry,
Larry, really.

546
00:23:16,816 --> 00:23:18,782
Are you kidding?

547
00:23:18,817 --> 00:23:20,716
I should go. I should go.
Goodbye, Larry.

548
00:23:20,751 --> 00:23:22,742
Hey, Cheryl!

549
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,664
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

550
00:23:37,697 --> 00:23:39,756
Excuse me.

551
00:23:44,502 --> 00:23:46,470
- Hey.
- You're not gonna believe this:

552
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:48,472
Cheryl called me up,
told me

553
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:50,473
that her therapist
urged her...

554
00:23:50,507 --> 00:23:52,805
urged her
never to see me again.

555
00:23:52,843 --> 00:23:54,811
That makes
no sense whatsoever.

556
00:23:54,844 --> 00:23:57,711
- Oh my God.
- Huh?

557
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:59,179
What?

558
00:23:59,215 --> 00:24:00,511
She likes me.

559
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:02,777
Her therapist likes me.

560
00:24:04,284 --> 00:24:06,444
That's why she told Cheryl
not to see me.

561
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,147
She wants me for herself.

562
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:11,486
- Oh my God! Oh my God!
- Huh?

563
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:13,718
What am I going to do?

564
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,726
If I reject her,

565
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,785
she'll say bad things
about me to Cheryl.

566
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:20,955
And If I'm nice to her,
she'll think I'm interested.

567
00:24:20,997 --> 00:24:23,795
Oh, you are screwed.

568
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,959
I've got to get out of this.
What am I going to do?

569
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,525
I think you're fucked.
That's what I think.

570
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,297
Tommy!

571
00:24:29,337 --> 00:24:31,965
- Is that Funkhouser?
- Yeah.

572
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:35,270
What is he doing here?
He's supposed to be walking.

573
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,604
He's having
a cup of coffee?

574
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,166
I'll see you later.

575
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,700
Hey.

576
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,371
L.D., how are
you doing, pal?

577
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,381
Where's your shirt?

578
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:46,850
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be walking.

579
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:48,908
I raised money.
I don't walk.

580
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:50,578
You didn't tell me
you were sitting.

581
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,985
I wouldn't have given you money
in the first place.

582
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:55,717
- I didn't say I was walking.
- The walking's implied, is it not?

583
00:24:55,757 --> 00:24:58,350
No, I said, "Sponsor me
for the walkathon."

584
00:24:58,392 --> 00:25:00,622
Okay, walkathon-
walk.

585
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:02,594
Why do you want me
to walk?

586
00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:05,393
You took money
under false pretenses.

587
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:07,831
So you don't care
about Alzheimer's?

588
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:12,426
Alzheimer's?

589
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:19,630
You were diagnosed
with Alzheimer's?!

590
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:21,232
Yeah, and you're
the first person I've told.

591
00:25:21,276 --> 00:25:23,176
I haven't told anybody.

592
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:24,769
You're the only one
who knows.

593
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:28,441
- So this is just the very earliest onset?
- Yeah.

594
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:30,915
I mean, it's not early.
I'm sort of halfway

595
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,009
between early and middle.
What's that called?

596
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:34,849
I don't know if there's
a term for that.

597
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:38,412
Maybe I have a quarter...?

598
00:25:38,457 --> 00:25:40,583
I have to
confess something.

599
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:43,092
After we met
and connected,

600
00:25:43,127 --> 00:25:46,095
I was hoping that,
you know,

601
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,562
maybe there was
some kind of future.

602
00:25:48,597 --> 00:25:53,226
In three to five years
I'll be a vegetable.

603
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:56,403
Listen, you helped me
the other day

604
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:58,768
and I want to help you.

605
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:00,669
I forgot your name.

606
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,607
You must go back
with your wife.

607
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:06,576
Hearing this news-
you must go back with your wife.

608
00:26:06,611 --> 00:26:09,340
Oh my God. Yes, I know,
but what can you do?

609
00:26:09,379 --> 00:26:13,007
Well, you never know.

610
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:16,109
Let's order.
I'm getting hungry.

611
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:18,642
- We did order.
- We did?

612
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:20,746
Yeah, you had
the chicken salad.

613
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,019
- I ordered chicken salad?
- Yeah. Do you not like-?

614
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:26,491
- I don't even like chicken salad.
- Oh my God.

615
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:28,790
- God damn it.
- No no no, we'll switch.

616
00:26:28,828 --> 00:26:32,318
- Excuse me, Dr. Salvin?
- Oh, yes.

617
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:34,059
I'm detective Kennan,
L.A.P.D.

618
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,362
I talked to your assistant.
She told me I could

619
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:38,095
find you here
with Mr. David.

620
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:40,568
I have some questions
about your purse-snatching.

621
00:26:40,604 --> 00:26:43,299
Now I understand you didn't
get a look at the guy, but that you did.

622
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:45,034
We actually have
the guy already.

623
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:47,564
I just want some basic information
so we can keep him.

624
00:26:47,609 --> 00:26:50,168
So, what did he
look like?

625
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,380
I- I don't remember.

626
00:26:57,383 --> 00:26:59,749
Aw, Jeez.

627
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:12,191
There he is.
There's my guy.

628
00:27:12,227 --> 00:27:15,253
Hey ya, Bright.
Hey ya, Bright boy.

629
00:27:15,297 --> 00:27:16,695
Huh?

630
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:18,699
How's it going?

631
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:20,098
Uh, not too good.

632
00:27:20,134 --> 00:27:23,000
What's the matter?
You seem a little down.

633
00:27:23,036 --> 00:27:25,560
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with my life.

634
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,094
- Really?
- Yeah.

635
00:27:27,139 --> 00:27:29,107
Oh, hey, get this:

636
00:27:29,141 --> 00:27:31,869
I'm going out with Cheryl tonight.
I've got a date with Cheryl.

637
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:34,071
- Good.
- It's fantastic. I'm so thrilled.

638
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:35,942
Come on.
I'm pretty excited, Bright.

639
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:37,674
I think
it's going to work out.

640
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,588
You did it.
That was...

641
00:27:48,621 --> 00:27:49,953
There you go,
big winner.

642
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,479
Hey...

643
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:53,491
That is so sweet.
Thank you.

644
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:55,720
- Let's go on the Ferris wheel.
- Okay.

645
00:28:00,197 --> 00:28:03,064
It's the most bizarre
experience of my life

646
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,829
and I just need someone
to speak to about it

647
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:08,860
because I can't work
and I can't sleep.

648
00:28:08,904 --> 00:28:10,929
And you come
highly recommended.

649
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,807
Why don't you start
from the beginning?

650
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:17,503
Um, well,
one of my clients

651
00:28:17,544 --> 00:28:21,707
is this bald guy, um...

652
00:28:23,215 --> 00:28:25,478
I want you
to move back in with me.

653
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:28,008
You have till Monday
to decide.

654
00:28:28,053 --> 00:28:29,849
Okay.

655
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:31,877
- Really?
- Yeah.

656
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:34,924
- I love you, Larry.
- I love you.

657
00:28:38,694 --> 00:28:41,218
Hello?
Hi, Dr. Salvin.

658
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,287
Ah.
