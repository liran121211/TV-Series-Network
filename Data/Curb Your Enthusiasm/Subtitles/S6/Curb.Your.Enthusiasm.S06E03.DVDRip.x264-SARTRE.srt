1
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,680
Did you call Funkhouser?

2
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:19,685
No, I'll send
a card or something.

3
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,949
That's terrible, what happened
to his mother.

4
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:23,580
I know.

5
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:25,921
I mean, driving a wheelchair,
getting hit by a car?

6
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:28,120
- That's unbelievable.
- Wasn't a surprise.

7
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:31,255
- No, it was not a surprise.
- Completely reckless in that thing.

8
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:34,164
Wow. You know,
over on Sunset,

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,668
they got a memorial site
all set up for her.

10
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,035
- Really?
- Yep. Right where she got hit.

11
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:41,336
- Huh.
- All these flowers.

12
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,070
You know what?
He owes me $50 from golf.

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,975
That's $50 you're
never gonna see.

14
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:48,879
- Never! Never gonna see that 50.
- Never ever ever ever.

15
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,440
You can't ask
a mourner for $50.

16
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:58,723
- Huh.
- Uh-huh.

17
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,692
Well, I'm waiting.

18
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,456
Yeah, me too.

19
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,929
What are you
waiting for?

20
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,125
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm waiting for you

21
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,635
to offer me condolences
for Funkhouser's mother.

22
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,330
Yeah, that's what I'm
waiting for from you.

23
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,464
I am so much closer
with Marty than you are.

24
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,167
I've known him
so much longer.

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:18,006
However long you've known him
is irrelevant in this equation.

26
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:19,909
All right, listen,
I watered the plants.

27
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,811
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

28
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,112
- Let's go get some ice cream.
- Oh, that's just what he needs.

29
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,710
- Just what he needs. Go! Enjoy yourself.
- That is a good idea!

30
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,687
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you.

31
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:31,212
Oh, and Jeff! Don't forget,
we've got the interview later

32
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,952
for Sammy
to get into Dryden.

33
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,961
- Very important.
- I'm all good, don't worry about it.

34
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,656
What's with you?
When's your interview?

35
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:39,460
I think it's tomorrow.

36
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,490
It would be very nice
if Daryl and Keysha

37
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,661
went to the same school as Sammy.
Wouldn't that be nice?

38
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:45,671
How do you know
Sammy's getting in?

39
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,333
Sammy happens to be
a very very bright girl.

40
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,104
Yeah, well, Keysha and Daryl are
no slouches, either. I can tell you that.

41
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,669
- Well, good.
- Daryl knows the multiplication table.

42
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,442
Well, that's great, Larry,

43
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,643
but I wouldn't take so much credit,
because it's not your DNA.

44
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:59,549
I sit up at night
teaching it to 'em.

45
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:02,384
- Sammy knows multiplication and division.
- All right, shut up!

46
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:04,356
- That's it, let's go! Come on.
- Long division!

47
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,881
Let's go.
What the heck?

48
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,728
- I think I'll get Cheryl an ice cream.
- Very nice.

49
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:17,065
Yeah, well, on the days
I want sex I'm a lot nicer.

50
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:19,435
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, I'll be nice the whole day.

51
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,497
And then we'll have sex.

52
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,475
And then I'll just go back
to being the way I am.

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,603
- It's fascinating.
- And it works for you.

54
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,806
What is that banana thing?

55
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,747
I love these people
that come here,

56
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,716
they get 10 samples,
you know?

57
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,616
And it's not right for
the woman working back there.

58
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:36,383
She's got better things to do than
just scooping out samples for them.

59
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,322
They're all so good.

60
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,986
But what- what is this-
oh- choc- chocolate...

61
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,518
Look at this. People are waiting.
That's not right.

62
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:45,155
No, it's not.

63
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,395
You know, I shouldn't
be eating ice cream.

64
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,334
- No, you shouldn't.
- No, I really shouldn't.

65
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,837
I don't know
what I came here for.

66
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,862
I can't even be-
you mind if I go?

67
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,432
- If I stay here I'll have no self-control.
- Get out of here!

68
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,501
- All right, bye.
- Get out.

69
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,345
Can I try the ras- raspberry chocolate,
whatever that is?

70
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,845
Got a long wait.

71
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,410
Ooh, could I try the tiramisu?

72
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,115
It's good.
That's a good one.

73
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:11,817
That's a good one.
Get that. Get that.

74
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,655
- I think I will. Thank you.
- Yeah, get that.

75
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,456
And I think I'd like
to try the banana, please.

76
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,985
Banana!

77
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,964
It might taste like...

78
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:22,161
- let me guess, a banana?
- And some chocolate.

79
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,171
- I mean this is really rid- this is so rude.
- Just the plain chocolate.

80
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,400
You know, you're like a sample abuser.
That's what you are.

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,068
- What is the matter with you?
- You're abusing your sampling privileges.

82
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,101
- One- two samples, the most.
- What do you think they have spoons for?

83
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,979
- You can't go on sample after sample!
- Oh, yes, I can!

84
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,643
You know what? I'm just gonna
have the plain vanilla, please.

85
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,654
- Thank you.
- Oh! A decision's been made!

86
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,417
Oh, we got vanilla!

87
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,515
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

88
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,590
Vanilla!
She winds up with vanilla.

89
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,495
You got to be kidding me.

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,293
How is the vanilla?

91
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,271
Hey! Funkhouser!

92
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,234
My God,
I can't believe it.

93
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:07,803
You're out?

94
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:09,781
- What are you- what are you doing?
- Well, uh...

95
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,374
this helps my emotions.

96
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,282
Jogging's the best
thing for me.

97
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,947
So, mourners-
mourners exercise?

98
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,184
- I didn't know that.
- I don't know if mourners exercise.

99
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,488
- It's just good for me.
- Interesting.

100
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,653
I'm gonna
remember that next time

101
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,993
I lose a close
member of my family.

102
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,760
Yeah. Jogging.

103
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,323
- Helps everything.
- By the way,

104
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,427
I called your house.
I left a condolence message.

105
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,028
I never got a return call.

106
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:35,103
Well, I had a few
things on my mind.

107
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,200
Yeah, still...

108
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,006
it's a little discourteous.

109
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,606
- Let me explain something to you.
- Sure.

110
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,514
I lost my dad a year ago.

111
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,575
My mother just died.

112
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,678
I'm an orphan, okay?

113
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,780
- You're a what?
- I'm an orphan.

114
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,723
- Orphan?
- Yeah, an orphan!

115
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,750
You're a little too old
to be an orphan.

116
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,091
No, if you don't have
parents you're an orphan.

117
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,426
You could be 70
and be an orphan?

118
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,090
You could be 100
and be an orphan!

119
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,565
- You can't be 100 and be an orphan.
- Yeah, you can!

120
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,797
Okay.
Little Orphan Funkhouser.

121
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:05,804
Let me ask you something...

122
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,170
One of the things that
bothers me a lot in life,

123
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:11,005
is when ice cream drips down the side
of a cone. Doesn't that bother you?

124
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,445
That's why you have to be very vigilant
when you're eating ice cream cones.

125
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,880
Look, there's a little drip.
Get it!

126
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,146
Oh, another drip!
Got it!

127
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,210
Are you coming
to the funeral?

128
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,620
Of course I'm coming
to the funeral.

129
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,124
Okay, I'm gonna give you the $50
I owe you for the golf bet.

130
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,558
- Oh my God!
- Hold this.

131
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,220
$50- I forgot all
about it, the $50.

132
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,127
- Yeah.
- Great!

133
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,155
- What are you doing?
- Taking off my shoe.

134
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,461
I got money in the shoe.

135
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,866
- What?!
- There you go.

136
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,470
Ugh!

137
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,872
- Take the $50!
- No, I don't want it.

138
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,843
- Take the $50!
- I'd really rather not.

139
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:46,868
- I don't want that 50 from your sweaty...
- Take the 50 bucks.

140
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,609
- disgusting sock and sneaker.
- This is the payoff.

141
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,844
That's- I don't want that 50.
Give me a clean 50.

142
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:54,216
- This is the 50 I have.
- I'm not touching that 50. I don't want it.

143
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,584
- Take the 50.
- No!

144
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,350
- Then I'm not paying you!
- What?

145
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,381
- I'm not paying you. This is the $50.
- You owe me $50!

146
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:00,949
- What if-
- This is $50!

147
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,325
It's perfectly fine.

148
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,797
See? $50.

149
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,629
- All right, this is bullshit.
- Take it.

150
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,135
Hold it out.
Hold it out, fold it up.

151
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:13,264
Fold it- that's it, okay.

152
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,132
Put it in my pocket.

153
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:17,870
Yeah, okay.
Put it in there.

154
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,906
Thank you.

155
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,414
- Hey, Cheryl.
- What's up, L.D.?

156
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,748
- Hey!
- What you got there?

157
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,050
- Ice cream.
- Ice cream?

158
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,352
Ooh! I love ice cream.
What flavor did you bring us?

159
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,189
Actually, uh...

160
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,593
I just kinda got it
for...

161
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,926
for Cheryl.

162
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,829
You just brought some
ice cream just for Cheryl?

163
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,629
You didn't bring none
to share with us?

164
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,135
Well, see, here's the thing.
I'm not really used to...

165
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,297
thinking about other
people other than Cheryl.

166
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:48,773
- Oh.
- So, it's not like I did it on purpose.

167
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,969
- Uh-huh.
- The thought didn't even enter my mind.

168
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,478
It's not like it entered my mind
and I thought "No, the hell with them."

169
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:56,539
See the difference?
Sin of comission, omission.

170
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,948
That's a sin of omission,
much better than the comission.

171
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,475
I think it's an
omission/comission thing.

172
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,851
But you still
forgot about us.

173
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,618
So next time, just bring like
the family-order size...

174
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:06,420
- I will.
- ... that they got there.

175
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,359
- I will. I'm sorry, Loretta.
- That's all right.

176
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,986
- I forgive you.
- Thank you.

177
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,519
- Hey, Cheryl.
- Hey.

178
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,759
Hey.
Got you ice cream!

179
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,633
Did you just get in a fight
with someone at the ice cream shop?

180
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:18,865
Uh... yeah.

181
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,434
Yeah, well,
what happened?

182
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,001
Well, this woman was
taking a lot of samples...

183
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:26,978
- Let me just tell Loretta something.
- Yeah.

184
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,708
This woman that
he's talking about

185
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,615
is the Dean of Admissions
at Dryden School.

186
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,881
That nice school we was
trying to get the kids in?

187
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,717
Yeah. Now, there's a problem
with their application.

188
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:36,949
But how do you even
know about this?

189
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:38,957
Because I just got
a phone call, Larry.

190
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,516
- Ooh.
- Let me just say this, okay?

191
00:07:41,561 --> 00:07:43,426
The woman was standing
in front of the counter

192
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,023
getting sample after sample.
She had 10 samples!

193
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:48,397
- You're allowed to do that.
- You're allowed to get free samples.

194
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:49,901
- No, you're not allowed-
- Yes, you are.

195
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,836
Why you think they get them
little, bitty, cute spoons there?

196
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:54,840
- I know why they got the cute spoons.
- So you can take...

197
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,069
Maybe one or two.
Don't abuse your sampling privilege!

198
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:58,872
She abused
the sampling privilege.

199
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:00,538
- And you know what else?
- What?

200
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,878
I was also watching out
for the counterwoman as well.

201
00:08:02,915 --> 00:08:04,883
If she had a problem
with that woman,

202
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:07,181
don't you think she would say
"excuse me, ma'am"?

203
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,051
No no! 'Cause she's always
told the customer's right.

204
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,989
And in fact, the customer is usually
a moron and an asshole.

205
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,822
But you know something, Larry? You
should've mind your business on this one.

206
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,955
She was breaking the rules.
She wasn't following the rules of society.

207
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,090
- What rules?
- The unwritten rules

208
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,600
that we have as we
go about our day!

209
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,661
- Like what?
- Like at night, you tiptoe.

210
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,436
That's an unwritten rule.
You tiptoe so you don't wake people up.

211
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:32,137
You tiptoe.
There's no sign, "Tiptoe."

212
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,043
You just have
to be smart enough

213
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,843
and considerate
enough to do it.

214
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,908
Okay, well, you know what? I'm glad
that you're so pleased with yourself

215
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,112
because now Keysha and Daryl
are not going to get

216
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,882
the education that
we were hoping they'd get.

217
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,389
That's a real good
school, Larry.

218
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,618
And we've been working
on that for so long.

219
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,059
- Good school.
- Courting that woman.

220
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:51,325
What you gonna do, L.D.?

221
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,026
I'll go and-
I'll go apologize.

222
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:56,364
That- that's nice.

223
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,927
You know what else?
I'll get her some flowers too.

224
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:00,768
That's a good start.
I'm down with that.

225
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:02,637
- That sounds good.
- You like the flower idea?

226
00:09:02,675 --> 00:09:04,700
That's a good one.
'Cause I want them kids in that school.

227
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,609
I'm- I'm gonna
rectify it.

228
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,341
I'm a great rectifier.
That's what I do.

229
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,509
I break down,
I rectify.

230
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,246
Just say I'm sorry,

231
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,982
we love the school,
and- and leave.

232
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,887
You- you don't
need to tell me

233
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,516
how to apologize to people.

234
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,255
I've been apologizing to people
since I'm six years old

235
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,923
on a daily basis.
I pretty much have it down.

236
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:27,762
- So you got this?
- Is it always effective?

237
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,768
- Your apologies?
- Pretty effective.

238
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:31,497
Okay, go.

239
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:34,062
Hey hey, how about a thank you?
I bought you some ice cream.

240
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:35,698
Yeah, one scoop
for the whole house.

241
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,005
- Thank you, Larry.
- I'm nice!

242
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,511
I got you the ice cream!

243
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,240
There's no
acknowledgment of that?

244
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,716
Hey, Mr. David,
I finished up all the painting.

245
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,014
It's... well, 11:20 now,

246
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,419
I got here at 9:20, so...

247
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,480
that's a couple hours,
50 bucks.

248
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,685
I'm hoping you're
pleased with it now.

249
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,286
Umm, let me
ask you a question.

250
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,025
- Mm-hmm?
- I mean, I really don't care about it.

251
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:02,125
It doesn't make a difference to me
either way, but I'm just curious

252
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,501
because I know when I left you were
in the bathroom for about 20 minutes.

253
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,405
- I came back and you're in again.
- Yeah.

254
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,070
So I'm kinda be charged for what,
like a half hour of your toilet time?

255
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,806
Oh, no no no.

256
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,212
It's just kind of
all-inclusive.

257
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,079
Yeah, I don't really
punch a clock, right?

258
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,244
- You don't punch a clock, do you?
- I don't punch a clock.

259
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,754
I don't charge people for
going on the toilet, though.

260
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,916
- All right, but that's okay. Doesn't matter.
- Great, thank you.

261
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,516
- $50?
- I appreciate that.

262
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,956
- Whoa.
- There you go.

263
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,660
- What's that?
- It's $50.

264
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,328
Uh... you know...

265
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,099
You don't want it?

266
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,265
- No, I want money, but...
- Take it.

267
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,832
It's a good 50!

268
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:45,537
You don't want it?

269
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:47,773
No, I just don't know where
you dragged that thing out of.

270
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,838
I mean, you know, that's...

271
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:52,112
I- I think- do you
have any other money, or...

272
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,346
Fine.

273
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,220
Change...

274
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:01,385
I got, uh...

275
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:04,362
$45.90.

276
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,661
- $45.90?
- Yeah.

277
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,428
Or...

278
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,401
I can give you the 50.

279
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,926
No.

280
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,030
I'll take the $45.90.

281
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,268
Thank you.

282
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,604
Okay.

283
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,172
I'm gonna get these.

284
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,811
All right.
Those are 35.

285
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,411
Okay.

286
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,727
No.

287
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,097
Hey, Funkhouser.

288
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,664
Call me back. No one's taking this 50.
I can't get rid of it.

289
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,573
I'll be home in an hour.

290
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:33,008
As you know,
my wife and I

291
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,078
took in a homeless family
who were victims of Hurricane Edna.

292
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:40,422
And- and I was so anxious
to bring 'em the ice cream back

293
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,657
that perhaps I was a little
too impatient in the store with you.

294
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:46,221
And I- I'm...

295
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,358
completely apologize.
I'm so sorry, but...

296
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,198
- I was just thinking about those kids...
- Right.

297
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,967
...waiting for that ice cream
that they haven't had in months.

298
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,974
And when I got home,
finally, they said,

299
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,408
- "Daddy, what took"- they call me daddy.
- Oh, really?

300
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,378
- Yeah, it's really sweet.
- That's nice. That's very nice.

301
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,970
I really love being
called daddy.

302
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:04,005
I don't particularly
like children,

303
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,074
- that's why I don't really have any.
- Uh-huh.

304
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:09,178
- But I like being called daddy.
- Yes yes. I can see.

305
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:12,281
It's- I've never felt anything
like that before in my life.

306
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,292
"Daddy, Daddy!
You got the ice cream!"

307
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,191
- Uh-huh.
- "What took so long, Daddy?"

308
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,321
And I said,
"Well, you know,

309
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,924
I had a little incident
at the ice cream store.

310
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,697
But anyway, I'd love for you
to have these flowers

311
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,433
and accept my heartfelt
and humble apology.

312
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,997
Apology accepted.

313
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,066
- Mmm!
- Thank you so much.

314
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,568
- Oh, they smell wonderful.
- Aren't they beautiful?

315
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,639
Well, you know, it's just such
a rare thing for someone to come in

316
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,674
and just admit
right off the top,

317
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,811
I was at fault.
It was me, I was rude.

318
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:44,448
I was obnoxious,
I'm not such a great person.

319
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,186
It's just really refreshing.
It's really rare.

320
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,456
Saying all that,
I am a pretty good person.

321
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,429
- I did take in a homeless family.
- Yes.

322
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,488
Excuse me one moment.
Kelly!

323
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,932
Could you
come in for a sec?

324
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,993
- Anyway-
- Well, hold on.

325
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,800
We're gonna need
a vase for this.

326
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,467
- Ooh, ooh! Fabric samples!
- Fabric samples.

327
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,170
Fabric samples.
They're so beautiful.

328
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,839
- Mmm.
- What are you doing with the fabrics?

329
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,745
- Oh, I'm gonna redo this couch.
- Oh.

330
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,716
Is this the one I chose?

331
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,083
Uh, no, actually.
Wasn't that the one that you wanted?

332
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,951
Oh, yes, but now
I want this.

333
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,923
Yeah, she- she
doesn't know what to do.

334
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,018
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you really liked the red tones.

335
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,688
I know.
I know, I did.

336
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,993
- I like the one you chose.
- The one I chose...

337
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,659
- I'll...
- I will see you tomorrow then, I guess.

338
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,067
- I'll see you tomorrow for our interview.
- Yeah, that's right.

339
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,970
Oh, God, see, there's this kind of
turquoise color in here.

340
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,769
- It's just-
- They're all nice.

341
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,332
- They're lovely.
- Yes, they are.

342
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,241
They are all nice,
that's the problem.

343
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,906
Yeah, that's what you need to do,
you need to pick one, see?

344
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,881
If only it were
that simple.

345
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,646
- Yeah. It is that simple, really.
- Yeah, but see the blue?

346
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,653
You want them all,
you can't have them all.

347
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,621
- I want them all.
- You got to kinda take one.

348
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,487
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, okay.

349
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,220
- Oh, God, what do I do?
- Take it, pick it out.

350
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:58,762
You still want me
to take this one.

351
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,817
I'm home!

352
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:32,729
One for you
and one for you.

353
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,563
What?
L.D., this is nice.

354
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,569
My two favorite girls.
Come on, give it up.

355
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,798
Aw!

356
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,772
- So it went well?
- I broke it down...

357
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:44,799
- and I rectified.
- You rectified?

358
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,310
- See this hand?
- Uh-huh.

359
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,279
That's where she
just had some lunch.

360
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:50,748
- That's what I'm talking about.
- So the application is okay

361
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,241
- and everything's back on track?
- It's so on track.

362
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,754
- So on track.
- You couldn't shake that train off.

363
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,484
- The kids are gonna appreciate that.
- Larry.

364
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,583
These are real nice, L.D.

365
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,287
That is so sweet.
Thank you.

366
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,523
- I'm gonna put these in some water.
- Okay.

367
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,087
All right.

368
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,860
Put 'em in-
put 'em in something

369
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,492
- and then, you know.
- What are you doing?

370
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:11,469
- Come on upstairs.
- Go upstairs?

371
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,232
- Come on.
- Let me put it in some water.

372
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,206
Yeah, that can wait
just one second.

373
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,211
Hey!

374
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,483
Why did you leave that stupid message
on my answering machine?

375
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,887
- What?
- I don't want to hear about the money.

376
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,949
No one will take this money.
I couldn't give it to a bum.

377
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,053
Listen to me. I don't care
about the money.

378
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:40,293
Someone stole flowers

379
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:43,324
that were marking the spot where
my mother was hit in her wheelchair.

380
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,928
- Really?
- Yes.

381
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm not a violent person.
But if I find this guy,

382
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:51,472
I don't know what I'm
gonna do to him.

383
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,507
- Hmm.
- I can't believe

384
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:57,913
that a human being would do that.

385
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,147
How would you even know
the flowers are missing?

386
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,848
I keep track of it.
I drive by there 10 times a day.

387
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,155
Okay, you know what?
You should go home now.

388
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,253
Don't worry about the 50.
I don't even care about it anymore.

389
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,491
You know...

390
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,557
What is that I smell?

391
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,068
What? There's no smell.
What do you mean?

392
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:18,831
That's a white lily.

393
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,668
I don't even know what-
what- a white lily?

394
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,469
I know a white lily.

395
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,305
- Huh?
- I've got a good sense of smell.

396
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,811
What are you doing?

397
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,506
Where are you going?

398
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,948
There they are.
I knew it!

399
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,215
- Hi, Marty.
- Hi, how are you, Cheryl?

400
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,586
- Boy, those are beautiful.
- Thank you.

401
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,456
- Where'd you get 'em?
- Larry just brought 'em home for me.

402
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,557
Where'd you
get the flowers?

403
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,154
Um... where'd I get those?

404
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,826
- Oh, Ventura Boulevard.
- What store?

405
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,459
What was it?

406
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:51,992
Uh...

407
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,562
Where can I find a vase?

408
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,267
Did you take the flowers
at my mother's site?

409
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,801
- What?
- What?

410
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:03,440
They wouldn't take the 50
at the flower store!

411
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,143
- How could you do that?!
- Oh, God.

412
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,879
Why? There are
so many of them.

413
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,648
- I didn't know it was such a big-
- So many of them?!

414
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:10,712
- Is that such a bad thing?
- They're not there to pick!

415
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,418
- You are the lowest of the low.
- I cannot believe you.

416
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,791
I have never heard anything
like that in my life.

417
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,228
- How many flowers does she need?
- You took flowers

418
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,992
- from Marty's mother?
- Are these from a graveyard?

419
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,523
Not a graveyard.
It's a roadside memorial.

420
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,160
It's not such a- come on!

421
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,000
How could you do this?
And you know what?

422
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,701
I am missing one!
Where's the third bunch?

423
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,401
- I-I-
- There were three bouquets.

424
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:35,709
- I know where it is.
- He will get you that bouquet.

425
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,147
I feel sorry for you.

426
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,416
If you weren't
my best friend,

427
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,977
I would take my bare hands

428
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,989
and pop your head
off your neck.

429
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,194
He's not my best friend.

430
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,822
You better
get those flowers!

431
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,563
Quick question...

432
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,696
is the other bouquet
in the dean's office?

433
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,501
Mmm... well...

434
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,065
yeah.

435
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,701
That's great.

436
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:08,235
- I'm gonna go get it.
- Yeah. That's good.

437
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,305
And then after
I get 'em back...

438
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,982
- anything I can do to...
- Get back upstairs?

439
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,352
Yeah.

440
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,414
Ummm...

441
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,756
I do like that
perfume Belle Fille.

442
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,091
- Belle Fille.
- That would make me happy.

443
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,428
- I know where. On Wilshire Blvd, right?
- Yes.

444
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:29,400
- That store on-
- That's only place that sells it.

445
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,698
Yes! Belle Fille.

446
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,932
You- you got it.

447
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,921
- Can I just add to it please?
- Sure.

448
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:30,952
- Thanks.
- Oh.

449
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:33,965
Wait wait wait, you know what?
I really like that too.

450
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,296
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

451
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,462
You know what? I'm not,
but these are wonderful.

452
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,937
Try that one.
That one's amazing.

453
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,167
So it's all
sort of a new line?

454
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:43,936
Yeah, those and we've
got different ones.

455
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,274
These are two citrus,
that one's- I know.

456
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:48,176
- I love that.
- So good, right?

457
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:52,115
Buy it. Buy it. It's a good one.
Get that one.

458
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,879
This is a little bit like
peppered with cinnamon.

459
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,887
- Uh-huh.
- It's good.

460
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,446
Good, buy it.
That's a good one.

461
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,618
Um, I was looking for
something actually also

462
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,651
which is very much
like that.

463
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:05,663
- Actually, I have this one at home.
- Do you really?

464
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,324
It's good.

465
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,857
- Can't really sample.
- Rose, not a big fan.

466
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,461
You know? You can't sample
everything in the world.

467
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,836
It's just impossible.
We'd all like to try everything.

468
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,704
Even though I'd love to,
just can't.

469
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,643
There's people in line,
people got to go places.

470
00:21:19,678 --> 00:21:22,272
I go to a restaurant, can I
get everything on the menu?

471
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,407
I'd love to. Who doesn't want
everything on the menu?

472
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,212
You can't, you got to order
one thing. That's all.

473
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,845
I'm done.
I'm gonna take that.

474
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,718
Thank you
very much.

475
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,616
The sampling thing
has got to, you know,

476
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,456
we got to put an end
to it, you know?

477
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,155
I'd like to be
with a lot of women,

478
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,221
I can't sample every woman.
You know what I'm talking about?

479
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,563
- What can I get for you?
- Yeah, Belle Fille.

480
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,660
It's that one.

481
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:48,529
- Here you are.
- You got it, that's great.

482
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:50,336
Sorry, I think
that's the last one.

483
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,271
I was on line ahead of him.
I was ahead of him.

484
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,372
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
have changed lines.

485
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,145
Can I get you
something else?

486
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:03,416
No, I don't want anything else.
You have a line problem in this store.

487
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,355
The lines move completely
disproportionately.

488
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,290
You know, there's
a way to fix that too.

489
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,227
Like they do in Disneyland,
you know, how the line snakes around.

490
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,628
Go into a deli,
you take a number.

491
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,188
So it's fair, that's all.

492
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:17,463
'Cause you probably don't
add up stuff at the same rate.

493
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:19,629
There's a way
to solve it- one line.

494
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,036
It's not a crazy idea.

495
00:22:21,073 --> 00:22:23,803
They wouldn't have stoned me
back 1000 years ago

496
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,173
for bringing up
the one-line idea.

497
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,644
There's one line,
everybody feels good.

498
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,977
They don't feel
they're being cheated.

499
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,108
You have a rope,
you rope it off,

500
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,845
and people move up
fair and square.

501
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,353
Nobody's going
"Oh oh, I can't move."

502
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,980
You know,
look at them, look at me.

503
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,650
That's all, one line.

504
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,592
All right.
You know.

505
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,761
So Sammy would
be in seventh?

506
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,234
Correct, yes. And she's having her
bat mitzvah this year.

507
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,759
- That's wonderful.
- Yes, she'll be 13.

508
00:22:52,804 --> 00:22:54,294
How is that going?
Is she enjoying it?

509
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:56,364
I have to tell you,

510
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,501
the way she's
learning her haphtarah...

511
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,944
because she's
actually understanding.

512
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,643
- That's very impressive.
- And it's proving interesting.

513
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,118
...and understanding the meaning of
what she's saying,

514
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:09,677
which is so
important to me.

515
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,780
- Of course, of course.
- Yeah.

516
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:13,882
That's lovely.

517
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:17,861
- I think these traditions are very important.
- Yes, it is important.

518
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,797
- It's a rite of passage.
- Yes, exactly.

519
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:26,461
And hobbies-
does she have any?

520
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,184
- Hey, hi.
- Hello.

521
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,951
- Hey.
- Mr. David.

522
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,551
- What are you doing here?
- Oh nothing, I was just...

523
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,153
driving by the building. I knew you guys
were here for your interview.

524
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,357
I thought we'd go out, have a cup
of coffee, discuss the interview.

525
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:55,127
'Cause our kids
could be going together.

526
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,362
- Our kids could be going together.
- Yeah.

527
00:23:57,402 --> 00:24:00,132
- He was here earlier today.
- Really, why?

528
00:24:00,172 --> 00:24:02,640
To apologize to me

529
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,802
for being rude, obnoxious and uncivil
in the ice cream store.

530
00:24:05,844 --> 00:24:07,869
She was taking a lot of time
in the ice cream store sampling...

531
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,541
But he brought me a lovely bouquet
of flowers in apology.

532
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,573
- They're right...
- Uh-huh.

533
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,812
Kelly, where are
the flowers?

534
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:16,718
They were just there.

535
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,279
I just put 'em right there.

536
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,950
Well, where did they go?

537
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,365
This is fucking
great, Larry!

538
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,594
Now Sammy's
kicked out too.

539
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,761
Just knowing you
is a liability.

540
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,169
We were in there, we're having
the interview, it's nice.

541
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,970
It looks like they're going to accept her.
And then you show up!

542
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,498
I don't know what to say.

543
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,340
I'm real-
I'm- I'm sorry.

544
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:44,144
You know, these are children's lives
we're talking about, Larry.

545
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,047
Their future
is in our hands.

546
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,075
You don't understand,
you just became a parent.

547
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,144
- But you have to take responsibility.
- I-I believe...

548
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,588
- I believe the children are our future.
- Oh, you know what?

549
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,149
You have ruined my life!
You have ruined my life!

550
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,889
- I have to live with this now!
- Oh, you bet he does!

551
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,454
Oh, do you hear that?
I am fucked!

552
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,831
And you fucked me!
Hard!

553
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,529
She'll get into
another school.

554
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:06,503
We don't want another school.
We want this school!

555
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,335
We did all our research
for this school, man.

556
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,967
Can I have those flowers?

557
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,808
You want the flowers?

558
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,905
Take the fucking flowers!

559
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,140
Is that what this looked like
when you stole it?

560
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,971
What?
Problem?

561
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,602
Yeah, a big problem.

562
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,374
No good?

563
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:51,041
- No good, no.
- Well, that's- that's the way I got 'em.

564
00:25:51,082 --> 00:25:53,312
Come on, what?
What's wrong?

565
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,184
They should all stand up. That's what
flowers do when they're healthy.

566
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,656
- Right.
- Stop picking up the petals, okay?

567
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,215
Well, I don't want to make
a mess in your house.

568
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,124
Don't worry about it.
You made enough of a mess.

569
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,685
- Okay, I'm- I'm sorry.
- Okay?

570
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,424
- Okay.
- Who are all these people?

571
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,659
They're friends and relatives
from out of town.

572
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,191
They came in
for tomorrow's funeral.

573
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,760
- Is that Lewis?
- Yeah.

574
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,271
Hey!

575
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,171
Hey.

576
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,732
- What are you doing?
- I got to get out of here.

577
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:20,836
I just- I just came here
to pay my respects

578
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:23,177
because I- I can't
go to the funeral.

579
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,978
God, look at these vultures
going for that food!

580
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:28,247
These- these people,
they don't even chew.

581
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:31,380
You know, I bet if you threw
a quarter down, there'd be a stampede.

582
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,948
You know that?
This- I got to...

583
00:26:33,992 --> 00:26:35,584
I got to get out of here.

584
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:38,221
I got the willies from this whole-
this whole place, man.

585
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,788
- What- what is that?
- That's his mother's shrine.

586
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:44,529
That's where Marty put all the things
she cherished in life...

587
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:47,265
he gathered like some psycho
and put it on the table.

588
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:49,739
I- I got to go.

589
00:26:59,751 --> 00:27:01,446
Cheryl, I'm home!

590
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,386
- Look what I drew.
- Yeah, okay, yeah.

591
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,013
- Hey, Larry!
- Yeah, get away.

592
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,387
Yeah.

593
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,324
I got the perfume!

594
00:27:13,898 --> 00:27:15,866
- You smell good.
- Thank you.

595
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,232
Hey, you want to go to my
sister's after the service?

596
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,896
I don't think so.

597
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,439
- Thanks for coming.
- Sure.

598
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,777
Sorry, man.

599
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:42,419
Hey, thanks so much
for coming, appreciate it.

600
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,466
Do you smell something?

601
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,471
Yes, what is that?

602
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,376
That's Mom's perfume.

603
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:04,974
You're right.

604
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,319
It's so strong.

605
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,723
It's like she's here with us.

606
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,874
Hey, somebody
dropped a 50!
