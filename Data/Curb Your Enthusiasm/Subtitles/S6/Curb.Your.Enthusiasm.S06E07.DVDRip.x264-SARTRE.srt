1
00:00:15,228 --> 00:00:16,889
You see? You see
what's going on here?

2
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:19,363
See, look at that.
It jumps and then it freezes.

3
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:20,958
- It's frustrating.
- It's very frustrating.

4
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:24,129
- I'm missing all my shows- "Lost."
- Oh, last week...

5
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:25,934
you know that guy they killed off
the previous week?

6
00:00:25,973 --> 00:00:27,804
All right, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

7
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:30,207
He's not dead,
he's back. He came back.

8
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:32,338
- I just told you not to tell me.
- Shocking.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,940
- Are you nuts?
- One of my top five episodes, all time.

10
00:00:34,983 --> 00:00:36,951
By the way, how come you didn't
show up last Thursday?

11
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:39,749
- You didn't even call.
- We had a lot of appointments Thursday.

12
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:42,656
- So what about the TV?
- Well, I don't think it's your TiVo.

13
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:44,625
It's probably the satellite,

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,128
- but I'm gonna take a look.
- Satellite? Okay.

15
00:01:05,616 --> 00:01:07,174
You know, it just gets
a little frustrating.

16
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:09,186
Every time I sit down and watch it,
it's not working.

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,744
- Hello?
- Larry!

18
00:01:10,788 --> 00:01:12,312
- Oh, hey, honey.
- Oh my God.

19
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:14,347
Honey, you couldn't call
at a worse time.

20
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:17,624
- I got the TiVo guy here.
- Oh my God!

21
00:01:17,663 --> 00:01:19,153
- You got the warranty on this thing?
- Larry!

22
00:01:19,198 --> 00:01:21,189
- The warranty.
- Oh wait, hold on.

23
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:24,100
- We're going through a big storm now.
- Hold on one second.

24
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:25,967
- I need a warranty card.
- Honey, let me ask you a question.

25
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:28,064
Do you have a- do you know
where the warranty card is

26
00:01:28,108 --> 00:01:29,405
- on the TiVo?
- No, I-I don't.

27
00:01:29,442 --> 00:01:31,410
In case something
happens to me...

28
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:33,776
- I mean, it's really bad.
- Is it in the kitchen drawer?

29
00:01:33,813 --> 00:01:35,405
- What?
- I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

30
00:01:35,448 --> 00:01:36,915
- What is that? What did you say?
- Do you know who

31
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,509
- the guy was who came out?
- No, I'm not talking to you.

32
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:40,713
Larry, I just wanna
tell you just in case...

33
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:43,120
- I can't hear you. Hold on one second.
- ... for some reason

34
00:01:43,157 --> 00:01:44,886
- I don't make it home...
- You know who put this in?

35
00:01:44,925 --> 00:01:47,086
- You know the guy who installed-
- I don't know.

36
00:01:47,128 --> 00:01:49,097
- I don't know his name.
- Was it Tom or something?

37
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,122
- I just want you to know-
- Or Don? Something like that?

38
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,294
- Maybe Bill or James?
- Oh my God!

39
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:56,065
I'll come back
later this afternoon,

40
00:01:56,104 --> 00:01:57,401
- because it looks like you're busy.
- Oh no, Jeez.

41
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,635
Honey, I'm sorry.
You know what? Please.

42
00:01:59,675 --> 00:02:01,438
He's gonna go.
I'm never gonna get him again.

43
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:03,035
It's all right.
I can come back.

44
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,706
No, stay right there.
Call me back in 10 minutes, okay?

45
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,476
- What?
- I'm sorry, sweetheart. I love you.

46
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:08,416
- Keep talking. I'll come back.
- No no, that's okay.

47
00:02:08,451 --> 00:02:10,613
- Stay- stay right here.
- Larry!

48
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:22,629
Isn't he something,
Billy?

49
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,032
Have you ever
seen horses like him?

50
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:26,263
Not quite.

51
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:29,740
Hey! Turned it off.

52
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,800
Guess what?

53
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:34,278
We're having dinner at Primo's tonight.
I made a reservation.

54
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:36,508
That's your husband.
Hey.

55
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:39,643
I'm leaving.

56
00:02:42,588 --> 00:02:46,218
I'm leaving, Larry.
I can't do this anymore.

57
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:50,522
You can't do this?
What?

58
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:52,088
What? What?
What are you t...

59
00:02:52,132 --> 00:02:55,466
Does that really surprise you?

60
00:02:55,503 --> 00:02:57,903
What do you mean you're leaving?
What are you doing?

61
00:02:57,939 --> 00:02:59,566
I just called you
from an airplane,

62
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:01,632
telling you I was
about to crash.

63
00:03:01,676 --> 00:03:03,644
The TiVo guy was here.

64
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,671
I could barely hear what you
were saying. He was about to leave.

65
00:03:06,715 --> 00:03:09,275
I couldn't even get the guy
to come to the house.

66
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:11,752
You know, it's very hard
to get those people here. It was broken.

67
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:13,186
- Oh, really?
- I got it fixed for you.

68
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:14,814
- Well, okay.
- I saved all your shows.

69
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:17,291
"Barefoot Contessa,"
"Top Chef," "Project Runway."

70
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,192
I wouldn't let him.
I saved those shows for you.

71
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:20,662
We've got these
shows right here.

72
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:23,860
It's not just about the TiVo.

73
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,095
What? What else is it about?

74
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:27,603
"What else is it about?"

75
00:03:27,638 --> 00:03:29,538
It's all of it.

76
00:03:29,573 --> 00:03:31,700
You can't do anything
like a normal person.

77
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,869
It's about talking during sex.

78
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:35,879
So I talk during sex. So what?

79
00:03:35,913 --> 00:03:38,542
- It's not dirty talk. You chitchat.
- So?

80
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:42,178
"Who can't tell that real crab
isn't fake crab?"

81
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,984
By the way, people should be able
to tell real crab from fake crab.

82
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:47,321
You've gotta be a moron
if you can't tell the difference.

83
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:48,691
- That's what I think.
- You know what?

84
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,662
If I bring that up
while we're having sex,

85
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,596
that's a fun topic to discuss.

86
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:54,031
You know what
the thing is, Larry?

87
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,626
People ask me all the time,
"How do you stay with him?"

88
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:59,503
And I always tell them, "There's another
side to Larry that you don't see."

89
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,133
And then I just realized today
there's no other side.

90
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,234
- No, there's another side.
- There's no other side!

91
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:06,405
- This is it!
- There's a lot of sides. I'm complex!

92
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,415
After I thought
I was gonna die

93
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,509
and you hung up on me,

94
00:04:11,552 --> 00:04:13,076
I started talking
to the guy next to me

95
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:16,147
and I realized
not everybody's like you.

96
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,717
There are normal people
out there that have conversations.

97
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:22,026
- Oh, the guy next to you.
- Interested in other people.

98
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:26,125
And we had a very...
soulful conversation...

99
00:04:26,168 --> 00:04:28,227
- That's sweet.
- ... about li- okay, see?

100
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,794
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

101
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,501
Okay, this guy. Does he carry
mints and a pen and tissues

102
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:35,807
at all times like I do, huh?

103
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:37,278
Does he have mints?
How is his breath?

104
00:04:37,314 --> 00:04:39,214
- Very pleasant.
- Really?

105
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:42,047
- What does he do?
- He owns an underwear company.

106
00:04:42,085 --> 00:04:43,815
- Oh, an underwear company.
- Mm-hmm, yes.

107
00:04:43,854 --> 00:04:47,688
- What kind of underwear?
- He invented...

108
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:50,819
it doesn't matter-
underwear that doesn't have a fly.

109
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:53,091
No-fly Zone?

110
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,395
No-fly Zone.

111
00:04:55,434 --> 00:04:57,095
That is
the dumbest company.

112
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:59,865
What a stupid- I've tried
that underwear. It is so idiotic.

113
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:01,566
You have to drop
the underwear

114
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:04,872
- to pee, okay?
- I think we just need time apart.

115
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:06,902
I'm gonna be
at my sister's.

116
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:08,971
- Don't do this. This is crazy, honey.
- Larry.

117
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:10,744
What are you doing
this for? What?

118
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,581
I love you. How could you do this?
What do you mean?

119
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:15,952
You weren't there
for me when I needed you.

120
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:18,822
- I couldn't hear you.
- I'll be at Becky's.

121
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:24,463
You're talking
on an airplane phone.

122
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,270
Yeah, I didn't think
I was gonna like this.

123
00:05:34,309 --> 00:05:36,834
Usually I don't
like the skin. It's delicious.

124
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,212
I marinate it
before I roast it.

125
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:45,850
Cheryl left me.

126
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,414
- What?
- What? What do you mean she left you?

127
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,392
- She's gone. She left.
- Really?

128
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,088
She's gone,
she's out of the house.

129
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,962
- Suitcase... clothes.
- Oh, she'll come back.

130
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:57,159
She's with her sister.
She's not coming back.

131
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,031
Do you want something to eat, sweetie?
Let me get you something.

132
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,503
- Jodi, get him a chair, please.
- Oh, sure.

133
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:02,165
- What happened?
- Let me get you a plate.

134
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,834
You know, she was coming back
on a plane, and there was a storm,

135
00:06:04,876 --> 00:06:08,312
and she called me
from the plane.

136
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:11,009
And you know, I had the TiVo guy
in the house.

137
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:13,176
So?

138
00:06:13,218 --> 00:06:15,846
Well, you know, it's so hard
to get the TiVo guy, man.

139
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:18,015
This guy, we keep exchanging calls.
I can't get him there.

140
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:21,254
So he's finally there,
and the whole call

141
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,524
he's kind of
talking to me, going...

142
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:25,690
what's with the small plate?

143
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:28,667
- That's the only one I had clean.
- What?

144
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,169
- Such a tiny plate?
- It's the same exact portion.

145
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:33,673
- What's the difference?
- My grandmother used to eat from that.

146
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:36,369
What happened
with Cheryl on the plane?

147
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:38,605
There was a lot of turbulence.
She was really frightened.

148
00:06:38,646 --> 00:06:41,979
The TiVo guy was there.
I couldn't really talk,

149
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:44,815
and... I told her to call me back
in 10 minutes.

150
00:06:44,853 --> 00:06:46,047
- What?
- Oh, Larry.

151
00:06:46,087 --> 00:06:47,782
The plane's going down,

152
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,654
- and you said, "Call me back"?
- You can't do that.

153
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:51,818
- You didn't say that.
- I didn't know it was going down!

154
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,521
- Okay. You know what?
- I didn't know.

155
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:56,259
She's gonna get over it,
and it's all gonna be okay.

156
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:58,961
No, she's not gonna get over it,
because she met a guy on the plane.

157
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,559
- Really?
- Where did she meet another guy?

158
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,764
- On the plane.
- While the plane was going down?

159
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:04,397
- Guy sitting next to her.
- Oh, no.

160
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,306
Guy sitting next to her.

161
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,835
What a scumbag. Takes advantage
of a married woman who's scared.

162
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,713
I feel terrible. I'm emotionally
distraught over this.

163
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:15,913
I mean, I know this would never
happen to Nan and myself.

164
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:19,355
- Of course not.
- But I wanna say one thing:

165
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,553
Okay, Cheryl's a great girl.

166
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:24,960
She's adorable, good cook,

167
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:26,588
fun to be with.

168
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,395
She has a terrific body.

169
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:31,426
- Used to be amazing.
- I remember.

170
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,031
- That's true.
- But let me make my point.

171
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:38,772
None of us at this table
ever would have met Cheryl

172
00:07:38,812 --> 00:07:41,303
- if not for Larry David.
- That's true.

173
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:43,339
- Very true.
- I brought her into your lives.

174
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:45,351
Cheryl's a great girl,

175
00:07:45,385 --> 00:07:47,319
but we have
to stick with Larry.

176
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:49,255
People are gonna
take sides now.

177
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,986
Listen, this is a time we have
to stand behind Larry.

178
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:57,487
Hey, that could be Cheryl.

179
00:07:57,532 --> 00:07:59,524
You'll get it later. We don't answer
the phone at dinner.

180
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:02,162
- What? I'll answer it.
- No no no. No, the phone is not...

181
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:03,796
What kind of fucked up
rule is that?

182
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,739
- No, we don't answer the phone.
- Get the hell...

183
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,765
- what, are you crazy?
- You don't answer the phone.

184
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,868
Give me that!
Give it to me!

185
00:08:09,912 --> 00:08:12,347
We don't answer the phone
during dinner! It's a rule!

186
00:08:12,382 --> 00:08:14,680
- You jammed my thumb.
- You weren't invited.

187
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:16,241
Go eat somewhere else!

188
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,254
Oh, Jesus.

189
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:20,415
I forgot to cancel
my reservations at Primo's.

190
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:22,391
- I'll use my cell phone.
- Out in the hall,

191
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:24,951
- not in the kitchen.
- All right, pipe down.

192
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:28,464
Thank you for calling Primo's.
This is Iris.

193
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:31,400
Oh, hi, this is
Larry David calling.

194
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:34,064
Oh, hi, Mr. David.
We have you down for 7:30 tonight.

195
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,538
Oh, you know what?

196
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:37,872
I'm- I'm gonna
have to cancel.

197
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,776
Oh, I'm so sorry.
May I ask why?

198
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,544
Well, if you must know,

199
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:46,313
my wife left me.

200
00:08:46,352 --> 00:08:50,311
- Your wife left you.
- Yeah, my wife left me.

201
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:52,415
Okay, Mr. David,
in the future,

202
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,450
it would be nice
just to get a little more notice

203
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:57,327
- when you wanna cancel a reservation.
- You don't believe me?

204
00:08:57,364 --> 00:09:00,231
Sure I believe you.
Your wife left you. Okay.

205
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,167
I'm getting from your tone
that you don't believe me.

206
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:03,726
You have to cancel.
I understand.

207
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,331
I'm just saying that it's our policy
to get a little more notice.

208
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:09,002
Okay, in the future,
if my wife leaves me,

209
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:10,738
I'll make sure she does it
in the morning.

210
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:13,406
Have a great night.

211
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,224
Maxwells?

212
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:26,193
- You okay?
- What the hell is this?

213
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,493
That's Simon's birthday party.

214
00:09:28,531 --> 00:09:30,965
He's having it at Maxwells?

215
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,094
Big band, special guest.

216
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:34,728
- He's going all out.
- Special guest?

217
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:36,762
Who goes all out for a birthday party?
Like, that's crazy.

218
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:39,469
I thought he was having this in his
house. You know how expensive that is?

219
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,535
I loaned him $10,000 last month.

220
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:43,911
- Last month?
- Yeah, he said he needed the money.

221
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:46,508
He needed it to give himself
a birthday party at Maxwells!

222
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:48,610
I'm paying for this thing.

223
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,393
- Hey.
- Hi.

224
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:58,988
I'm sorry. I just came by to pick up
a few more things.

225
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,830
Oh. Oh.

226
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:05,235
I'm so glad you're here,

227
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,967
because I...

228
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,702
I need to talk to you.

229
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,143
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

230
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:14,044
I need you to do
something for me

231
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:16,345
- if it would be okay.
- Okay.

232
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:19,079
I had to call Primo's

233
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,884
- to cancel our reservation.
- Yeah.

234
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:24,414
And the hostess asked me

235
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:26,484
why I was canceling,

236
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:29,429
and I told her it was
because you left me.

237
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:31,022
Mm-hmm.

238
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:34,161
But I don't think
she believed me.

239
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:37,536
So what I'd like
you to do

240
00:10:37,573 --> 00:10:40,406
is to call the restaurant

241
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:42,911
and just sort of,
you know,

242
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:44,880
confirm my story.

243
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:50,184
You want me to call
a stranger at a restaurant

244
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,381
and talk to them
about our marriage?

245
00:10:52,422 --> 00:10:55,221
She's not really a stranger.
Iris, you know Iris.

246
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:57,318
- The hostess. She works there.
- I don't really know Iris.

247
00:10:57,361 --> 00:10:59,158
You know the one.
She's got the long hair.

248
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:01,688
I know who you're talking about,
but I really don't think

249
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:05,761
I want to call her and tell her
that we're breaking up.

250
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:07,738
You know, she said
she believed me,

251
00:11:07,773 --> 00:11:10,765
but there was
something in her tone

252
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:14,142
that told me that maybe she thought
I was making this up or something.

253
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:15,612
I mean, who would
go to the lengths

254
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:18,481
of saying that their wife
split up with them

255
00:11:18,518 --> 00:11:21,180
- and that's why they had to cancel?
- You would.

256
00:11:22,989 --> 00:11:25,719
Not so sure about that.
Don't think I would.

257
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,854
Yeah well, excuse me.
I gotta actually get this stuff.

258
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,594
Cheryl, don't go.
Come on.

259
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:35,829
Come on, just stay.
Don't, don't.

260
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,499
I need to go, Larry.

261
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,905
Will you call
the restaurant?

262
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,416
- Hey, Larry.
- Hey, Simon.

263
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:01,454
- How are you?
- I'm okay.

264
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:05,264
- Good good good good.
- You know, I was over at Jeff's,

265
00:12:05,302 --> 00:12:07,566
and I noticed the invitation
to your party.

266
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:10,095
Aren't the invitations great?
I took a lot of time on that.

267
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,405
I had no idea the party was
gonna be at Maxwells

268
00:12:12,443 --> 00:12:14,434
- with the open bar-
- Open bar.

269
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,969
- and the band,
and the special guests.

270
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:18,380
Wait till you hear about
the special guest. Yeah.

271
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,477
I loaned you
$10,000 a month ago.

272
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,818
You didn't tell me you were having
this big party for yourself.

273
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:25,983
$10,000 has nothing
to do with the party.

274
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:27,686
- What are you talking about?
- No no no no.

275
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:30,058
I'm not using that money for that.
I used the money for something else.

276
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:31,790
- I appreciate it.
- But you would have to use

277
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:34,027
the money for something else
if you didn't have this party.

278
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:36,058
- You could've used the money for that.
- Don't connect the two,

279
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:38,297
- because- don't think of them as-
- I see them

280
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:40,636
- as being totally connected.
- No, they're not connected at all.

281
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:42,938
No, have nothing
to do with each other.

282
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,605
Simon, you're crazy,
you know?

283
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:48,706
Anyway, all right, so fine.

284
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:50,478
- Yeah.
- I'll see you at Maxwells.

285
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,076
This is probably
gonna be some party.

286
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:54,588
Umm, okay,
here's the thing:

287
00:12:54,623 --> 00:12:57,023
Cheryl is
gonna be there.

288
00:12:59,027 --> 00:13:00,654
Are you comfortable
with that?

289
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,220
I'm comfortable.

290
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:05,928
I don't think anybody else
will be... comfortable.

291
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:08,199
Well, they're
gonna have to...

292
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:10,433
it's their problem,
isn't it, you know?

293
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:13,033
Here's the thing-
my wife and I talked about it,

294
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:15,567
and... we chose Cheryl.

295
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,816
You believe this guy?

296
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:23,615
$10,000 I loan him.

297
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:26,350
Disinvites me from the party,
choosing Cheryl.

298
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,689
I'm paying for that party.
You know that? Hey, Zev.

299
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:31,423
- Hello, Larry David.
- You're cleaning underwear and socks?

300
00:13:31,463 --> 00:13:34,159
That's another thing-
I gotta go back to Fluff and Fold now.

301
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,327
Alana didn't show up. You know,
I don't have her phone number.

302
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:38,735
Cheryl took care
of all that stuff.

303
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:40,170
You're just lost,
aren't you?

304
00:13:40,206 --> 00:13:42,504
- I'm completely lost.
- Oh my God.

305
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,873
You know what I got
in my foyer at home?

306
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:47,004
Pictures of all
my dry cleaners.

307
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,846
Hey, Xena
the Warrior Princess.

308
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,649
Yeah.

309
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:56,519
- Did you use to watch that show?
- Of course.

310
00:13:56,556 --> 00:14:00,015
- Yeah, she's pretty sexy.
- Oh, my...

311
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:02,894
What the hell, Larry?

312
00:14:02,931 --> 00:14:04,762
Oh my God.
I'm so sorry.

313
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,733
Oh.

314
00:14:06,768 --> 00:14:08,929
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, shit.

315
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,494
- It's ripped.
- She doesn't come in anymore.

316
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:12,404
How am I gonna
get another picture?

317
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:14,636
Man.

318
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:16,770
You can get Lucy Lawless's
picture, can't you?

319
00:14:16,812 --> 00:14:18,177
You know what?
I'll get ahold of her agent

320
00:14:18,213 --> 00:14:19,703
and we'll find it.
I'll get it.

321
00:14:19,748 --> 00:14:21,181
Okay, I'll get you
another picture.

322
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:24,516
Could you have her make it out
to "Zev" this time?

323
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:26,522
- Yes. Okay.
- Thank you. All right.

324
00:14:26,556 --> 00:14:28,217
- I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

325
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,748
Just give me
the picture.

326
00:14:29,793 --> 00:14:33,457
- I'll get the picture.
- Thank you so much.

327
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,591
Please take this couple
over to table #24.

328
00:14:36,634 --> 00:14:38,659
Thanks,
have a nice dinner.

329
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,036
What's taking so long,
may I ask?

330
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,378
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. David.
We're just really full tonight.

331
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:52,042
It should just be
a couple more minutes.

332
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:54,314
Let me ask you a question.

333
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,879
- Did my wife call the restaurant?
- No.

334
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,823
Is that why I'm not getting
a table?

335
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:01,156
Because you didn't
believe my breakup story last night?

336
00:15:01,194 --> 00:15:03,355
I don't know
what you're talking about.

337
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:05,957
- You do know what I'm talking about.
- No, we're just full tonight.

338
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,262
Why would I make that up?
That's insane.

339
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:08,427
Mr. David,
we'll be right with you.

340
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:10,198
You have to be insane
to make up a story like that.

341
00:15:10,237 --> 00:15:12,102
- Okay.
- If I wanted to cancel a reservation,

342
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,629
and needed an excuse, I would just
say I'm sick or something.

343
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:15,505
Primo's, this is Iris.

344
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,909
Sure, come right in.

345
00:15:17,946 --> 00:15:20,039
We did break up. That's why
I had to cancel the reservation.

346
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:21,548
Okay, we'll see you soon.

347
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:29,083
You totally deserve that.

348
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,685
You totally deserve it.
Yes, you do.

349
00:15:31,727 --> 00:15:34,195
On no planet is a shoe caddy
a good gift.

350
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,925
That's just a- what?

351
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:37,694
All right, yeah,
no no no,

352
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,032
I get that
it was payback, but...

353
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,470
It's not long distance
even if it's in India.

354
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:45,407
So I'm on the 14th hole, okay? Lloyd,
he's got these great Cuban cigars.

355
00:15:45,442 --> 00:15:48,104
- What? I can't talk to you, Mom.
- So we're smoking these cigars.

356
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:50,740
- I've got someone on the other line.
- So I reach down to take a puff...

357
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:53,478
- I can't hear you. It's loud in here.
- ... and all of a sudden, Lloyd goes,

358
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:54,780
"What the fuck are you doing?

359
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:56,514
- That's my cigar!"
- I'll call you back. Call them.

360
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:58,181
So I was trying to brush
my teeth with an apple.

361
00:15:58,222 --> 00:16:01,317
- It was horrible, horrible.
- Excuse me.

362
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,328
Who are you talking to?

363
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,058
- I'm talking to myself.
- Well, you're doing it really loud.

364
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,089
- Oh, really?
- Yeah yeah.

365
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,898
- You're kind of talking loud yourself.
- To a person.

366
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,165
What's the difference?

367
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,366
I'm actually conversing
with another human being.

368
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,931
- Oh, really?
- Very different than just...

369
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,875
To the outside observer,
it's the same level of annoyance.

370
00:16:17,911 --> 00:16:19,776
Well, I need to talk to my friend.
I can barely hear here.

371
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,839
Okay, well, maybe
if you talk lower to your friend,

372
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:23,179
- I'll talk lower to my other self.
- Great great.

373
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:25,310
- Yeah, good plan.
- Okay, all right.

374
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,320
Jesus Christ. I'm literally sitting
minding my own business...

375
00:16:27,354 --> 00:16:28,912
What a schmuck. He's been talking
on his phone the whole dinner.

376
00:16:28,956 --> 00:16:30,753
...and this guy is talking to himself.
He's still doing it.

377
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:33,022
Do you hear that?
Listen, you hear this?

378
00:16:33,061 --> 00:16:35,894
He thinks he can just sit there and
talk out loud and not be annoying.

379
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:37,796
Do you hear that? He's literally
just doing it just to be annoying.

380
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,027
He's been driving me nuts
the last 10 minutes.

381
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,796
Honestly, I'm done anyway.
This is bullshit.

382
00:16:40,836 --> 00:16:42,565
- I'm paying. I don't care.
- No, can you hear him?

383
00:16:42,604 --> 00:16:44,232
No, he's still talking.
Wait, I got Steve on the other line.

384
00:16:44,273 --> 00:16:46,070
- He wins, he wins. Yeah, you win.
- Hey, Steve...

385
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,599
- Good for you, being annoying.
- ... do me a favor.

386
00:16:47,643 --> 00:16:50,043
Remind me- these people,
they're just...

387
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:55,615
- Who are you talking to?
- Oh, hey.

388
00:16:55,652 --> 00:16:58,018
- Hi, Jodi.
- Hey.

389
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:01,119
What are you doing tomorrow?
Let's play golf.

390
00:17:01,158 --> 00:17:05,060
I can't. Larry, the Funkhousers
have made a decision.

391
00:17:05,095 --> 00:17:08,122
We're going with Cheryl.

392
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,760
Yeah.

393
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:28,276
- Oh. Hi, Becky.
- Oh. Hi.

394
00:17:28,321 --> 00:17:30,482
Is Cheryl here?

395
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:34,187
No, she's not here
right now, so...

396
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:37,492
- You know when she'll be back?
- Nuh-uh, I don't,

397
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:40,330
- but it was good to see you.
- Alana?

398
00:17:40,368 --> 00:17:43,428
- Is that Alana?
- Mr. Larry.

399
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,633
What are you doing here?

400
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:48,539
I work for Mrs. Cheryl.

401
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:51,842
- You chose Cheryl?
- Yes.

402
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,075
Hey, Becky?

403
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,277
Oh, I wasn't sure if you'd still
be here. I thought you were gonna...

404
00:17:56,318 --> 00:17:58,582
I am, and...

405
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:02,620
- Hi.
- Hi.

406
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:04,092
This is Glenn.
This is Larry.

407
00:18:04,127 --> 00:18:07,187
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

408
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:10,689
Nice head of hair.

409
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,999
Okay. What are
you doing here?

410
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:15,562
You need to call
Ted Danson back.

411
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:18,302
He wanted to invite you
to an Oceans fundraiser.

412
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:20,003
Oh, yeah.
Okay, thanks.

413
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:22,536
- You'll like Ted.
- I like the ocean.

414
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:24,811
- Then it's perfect.
- I'm very pro-ocean.

415
00:18:24,849 --> 00:18:28,080
So, Glenn, how's the no-fly
underwear business doing?

416
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,609
- I told him about your business.
- Yeah.

417
00:18:29,654 --> 00:18:31,246
- It's going great.
- Is it?

418
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,588
- Yeah.
- You think men want an underwear

419
00:18:33,626 --> 00:18:35,617
- that has no fly?
- I know they do.

420
00:18:35,661 --> 00:18:38,687
74% of the men we tested
go over the fence.

421
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:41,291
- Oh, they do?
- Yeah, the rest go through the gate.

422
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:42,961
- Well-
- You're not giving people an option.

423
00:18:43,002 --> 00:18:45,528
The penis needs an option,
just like everybody else.

424
00:18:45,572 --> 00:18:48,097
The penis is human.
It needs an option.

425
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:51,406
All right, well, you should
probably get going.

426
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:53,538
- Okay.
- Okay.

427
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,640
- Mint?
- No.

428
00:18:56,818 --> 00:18:59,184
- Tissue?
- No, I...

429
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,250
Pen?

430
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:14,065
- Is that Glenn with two "N"s?
- It is, in fact.

431
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:16,162
You know what?
I wouldn't care...

432
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:18,140
I wouldn't care if she
left me for a bald guy.

433
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:19,971
Right.

434
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,673
- But this is, like, the worst betrayal.
- What does he look like?

435
00:19:23,713 --> 00:19:27,376
- Thick, like presidential Kennedy hair.
- Oh.

436
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:29,943
- And he makes underwear?
- Yeah, no-fly underwear,

437
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:32,387
like there's some great clamoring
for no-fly underwear.

438
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:34,050
- Who needs no-fly underwear?
- I know.

439
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,059
A guy who goes into a store and goes,
"I need a pair of underwear.

440
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:37,924
- I got a vagina."
- I know.

441
00:19:37,962 --> 00:19:39,658
No-fly underwear.

442
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:41,757
Hello?
Hold on one second.

443
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:46,897
Great, thank you
so very much.

444
00:19:46,938 --> 00:19:49,567
Really, thank him.
Thanks, bye.

445
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:51,600
Here you go.

446
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:53,669
Lucy Lawless.

447
00:19:53,713 --> 00:19:56,181
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

448
00:19:56,215 --> 00:19:57,944
Oh, thanks.

449
00:19:57,984 --> 00:20:00,385
- Let me call her.
- Which water is mine?

450
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:04,050
I don't know.
I took one sip.

451
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:05,888
I have no...

452
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,951
- we'll have to get more.
- We'll get more water.

453
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:12,226
- "To Zev..."
- Zev, yes.

454
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:15,100
- "... Lucy Lawless."
- Thank you so much.

455
00:20:15,136 --> 00:20:18,071
I not only get you the picture,
I get you Lucy Lawless.

456
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:20,199
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

457
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:23,473
- Wow, you make lovely "L"s.
- You got my dry cleaning?

458
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:25,241
Tomorrow after 5:00.

459
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,011
- Hey, that was nice of you to do that.
- Oh, you're welcome.

460
00:20:33,056 --> 00:20:35,320
To tell you the truth, I thought he
was gonna be more bowled over

461
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,452
by your presence.
He took it pretty calmly.

462
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:39,223
People are always
expecting someone bigger.

463
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:41,958
I used to be very intimidated by that
warrior princess, I gotta tell you.

464
00:20:41,998 --> 00:20:43,329
- Did you really?
- Yes.

465
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,598
- And now?
- Now that I see you in person,

466
00:20:45,636 --> 00:20:47,627
I actually think
I could take you.

467
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:52,540
Look, I'm not a cool guy
or anything, okay?

468
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:54,442
I haven't been
on a date in 12 years,

469
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,846
but I would love to waste
your time for couple of hours.

470
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,474
What do you think about that?

471
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:00,348
Can I do that?
Is that possible?

472
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:02,217
- How about that?
- Okay, yeah.

473
00:21:02,254 --> 00:21:04,449
- Have you been to Primo's?
- I have never been to Primo's.

474
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,152
- I hear that it's great though.
- It's really good.

475
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:08,092
All right, yeah.
Well, you've got my number.

476
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:09,459
I do.

477
00:21:09,496 --> 00:21:11,794
- Well...
- Oh, Jeez.

478
00:21:11,831 --> 00:21:14,095
- What?
- Ted Danson.

479
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:17,161
He is an asshole.

480
00:21:17,204 --> 00:21:19,035
Really? You don't like him?

481
00:21:19,073 --> 00:21:21,098
- I despise him. He's just terrible.
- Hey, how are you?

482
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:22,609
- Hi.
- How are you doing, man?

483
00:21:22,643 --> 00:21:24,042
- You know Lucy Lawless?
- I do.

484
00:21:24,078 --> 00:21:25,409
- Yeah, we met.
- Ted Danson.

485
00:21:25,446 --> 00:21:28,575
- Yeah, nice to see you.
- You too.

486
00:21:28,617 --> 00:21:30,448
- Well, okay.
- All right.

487
00:21:30,485 --> 00:21:33,511
Bye.

488
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:35,716
What is that?
"Call me"?

489
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:37,156
- Did she just do a "call me"?
- Yeah, she did.

490
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:39,320
- We're going out to dinner.
- Really?

491
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:41,159
- Yes, yeah.
- Well, good for you.

492
00:21:41,197 --> 00:21:43,222
I asked her for a date.
Here's what I said.

493
00:21:43,266 --> 00:21:45,826
"I'm not really
a cool guy or anything,"

494
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,597
which is a pretty
good line I thought.

495
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:50,664
I never did that when I was dating,
admit that I wasn't a cool guy.

496
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:53,107
Now I didn't give a shit.
I just said, "I'm not a cool guy."

497
00:21:53,143 --> 00:21:56,670
It fucking worked! "I'm not a cool guy"!
I'm gonna use it all the time.

498
00:21:56,713 --> 00:21:58,613
- Good for you, man, really.
- Thank you.

499
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:00,413
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you deserve that.

500
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,216
- I gotta scoot.
- Wait, let me ask you something.

501
00:22:04,556 --> 00:22:06,649
How come I wasn't invited
to your fundraiser?

502
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:10,690
- Wha-what fundraiser?
- The Oceans fundraiser.

503
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:14,187
Oh! I thought you were
a global-warming guy.

504
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,632
- Really?
- Yeah.

505
00:22:17,703 --> 00:22:19,261
You're going with Cheryl,
aren't you?

506
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:23,208
Yeah. Yeah.

507
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:39,356
"Okay, what is Jim Jones's
most famous song?"

508
00:22:39,393 --> 00:22:42,487
- "Ballin"!
- And there he is, y'all!

509
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,425
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.
- And a la-di-da.

510
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:49,198
- Not too much? Not too dressy?
- No.

511
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:50,637
- No, you look good.
- You're cool, man. You're cool.

512
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:52,037
You're bringing it tonight, man.
Let me tell you something.

513
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:53,769
What, am I gonna sit home?
She's going out.

514
00:22:53,809 --> 00:22:56,108
- That's right.
- She's got a new boyfriend already!

515
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:58,545
- Your turn.
- Guess who I'm going out with?

516
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,242
- Who?
- Who are you going out with?

517
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:02,774
Xena the Warrior
Princess.

518
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:04,980
- Ooh!
- Wait a second now.

519
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:07,115
- What?
- Uh-huh.

520
00:23:07,157 --> 00:23:08,920
- Do you love that?
- I love it!

521
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:10,790
- Don't wait up.
- Don't worry, we won't.

522
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:13,262
- My man L.D.
- Yeah.

523
00:23:13,297 --> 00:23:14,696
Sorry you gotta miss
that Laker game.

524
00:23:14,732 --> 00:23:16,495
- Forget about it.
- Oh, I got to TiVo it.

525
00:23:16,534 --> 00:23:18,332
What?

526
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,998
- What the hell?
- Larry, you all right?

527
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,667
- You all right?
- Leon, go help him.

528
00:23:23,708 --> 00:23:25,676
- What happened?
- What happened, man?

529
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,202
- You all right?
- What's the matter?

530
00:23:29,749 --> 00:23:31,239
So what's the deal?

531
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:33,275
- Yeah, what's the deal?
- I was just about to explain.

532
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,150
Based on your signs
and symptoms,

533
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:37,178
when you twisted
your body,

534
00:23:37,223 --> 00:23:40,352
your testicles got ensnared
in the fly of your underwear,

535
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:42,328
which acted like a noose.

536
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:45,593
And it caused scrotal hematoma
and contusion.

537
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,260
- Twisted balls.
- In layman's terms, yes,

538
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,964
but it's not
as bad as it sounds.

539
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:52,097
It's a bruising, which will probably
last about a week or so.

540
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,608
- Oh, okay.
- But I would definitely recommend

541
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:57,133
switching to a style
of underwear with no fly.

542
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:58,873
No-fly Zone?

543
00:23:58,913 --> 00:24:00,779
- Is that what you're telling me?
- That's exactly it.

544
00:24:00,816 --> 00:24:02,215
No-fly Zone.
That's a popular brand.

545
00:24:02,251 --> 00:24:04,719
- I'm not wearing that underwear, okay?
- You gotta do it, man.

546
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:07,381
You got long balls, Larry.
Long balls.

547
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:09,084
- You got long-ass balls.
- I've got long balls?

548
00:24:09,124 --> 00:24:10,955
Doctor, you've seen
his balls, right?

549
00:24:10,993 --> 00:24:12,655
Would you say my balls
were unusually long?

550
00:24:12,696 --> 00:24:15,221
They're a bit more distended
than the average testicles.

551
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:16,698
You got long-ass balls, Larry.

552
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,598
Long-ball Larry.
That's your new name.

553
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:20,569
Long balls.
Who the hell knew?

554
00:24:20,604 --> 00:24:23,665
Long balls,
change the drawers.

555
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,734
Okay, fine.
I'll wear the No-fly Zone.

556
00:24:26,777 --> 00:24:29,678
- Thanks for getting me through so fast.
- Yeah, my pleasure.

557
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:32,239
You know what, I got a date.
I gotta get out of here.

558
00:24:32,283 --> 00:24:35,117
Oh yeah, speaking of that,
you're gonna wanna ice your testicles,

559
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:37,417
and no sex
for at least a week.

560
00:24:37,456 --> 00:24:40,391
I don't think that's gonna be
a problem for me, but thanks.

561
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:41,858
Thanks for the info.
All right.

562
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:43,827
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

563
00:24:43,862 --> 00:24:45,694
My man.

564
00:24:45,732 --> 00:24:48,929
- I got long balls.
- Long-ass balls.

565
00:24:52,238 --> 00:24:55,333
I've actually trained my body
not to use public toilets.

566
00:24:55,376 --> 00:24:56,707
Trained it.

567
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:59,110
So I never ever have
to go when I'm out of my house.

568
00:24:59,146 --> 00:25:00,613
Yeah, I'm getting
a red flag here, Larry.

569
00:25:00,648 --> 00:25:03,481
You know what? We should switch sides.
Because the game's on.

570
00:25:03,517 --> 00:25:04,984
- I don't wanna look at it.
- Why not?

571
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:07,545
Because I'm TiVoing it.

572
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,558
- Oh, hate spoilers, right?
- I can't watch if I know what happens.

573
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:14,551
- So what else about you?
- I'm a man of mystery.

574
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,065
- And you're a Jew, right?
- Yeah.

575
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,124
'Cause we don't have
those where I come from.

576
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:20,396
- Really?
- Nope.

577
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:21,869
So I must be quite
fascinating to you.

578
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:23,599
You are so exotic
you have no idea.

579
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:24,799
- Really?
- Yeah.

580
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,307
It's like a black man
in Sweden.

581
00:25:26,342 --> 00:25:28,436
- It's exactly like that.
- Right?

582
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:30,605
Mr. Akivo, your table's ready.
Right this way please.

583
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:32,615
Sorry for the wait.

584
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,174
Okay, we were definitely
here ahead of them.

585
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:36,685
- Absolutely.
- Huh, were we not?

586
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,087
- Uh-huh.
- I'm gonna talk to the owner.

587
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,852
Hey, Primo.

588
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:42,723
Mr. David, good evening.

589
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,092
What's going on? All these people
I came in ahead of

590
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,324
are getting seated.
How come I'm not getting a table?

591
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,398
Mr. David,

592
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:54,531
there is no table.

593
00:25:54,573 --> 00:25:57,474
No table? How come?
What do you mean "no table"?

594
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:01,446
We chose Cheryl.

595
00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:13,551
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
Can you believe that?

596
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,061
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

597
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:17,929
- Mint?
- Yeah.

598
00:26:22,236 --> 00:26:25,502
- Tissue?
- No.

599
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,100
So what do you
wanna do now?

600
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:32,004
We could go
to my house.

601
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:34,642
Your house?

602
00:26:34,684 --> 00:26:37,619
Sure. It's just
up the road.

603
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,850
Oh, Christ.

604
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,825
What?

605
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,659
My testicles got ensnared
in the fly of my underwear,

606
00:26:46,697 --> 00:26:50,463
and the doctor said
I can't have sex for a week.

607
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:52,298
But we can
go there for dinner.

608
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:56,068
I was only talking about dinner,
you big asshole.

609
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:59,599
No! No!

610
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:21,730
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Hey, name please.

611
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:24,168
- Larry David. Simon's party, right?
- Yes.

612
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:26,297
- Cool.
- Sorry, you're not on the list.

613
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:29,571
That's gotta be a mistake. I gotta
be on this list. I'm a close friend.

614
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,044
- My wife is in there.
- Not on the list, can't let you in.

615
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,808
- Come on, man. I'll give you $20.
- $20?

616
00:27:33,848 --> 00:27:35,645
If you're not on the list,
I can't let you in. Sorry.

617
00:27:35,683 --> 00:27:37,878
- $40.
- That's insulting.

618
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,684
Hey.

619
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:42,656
What the heck
are you doing here?

620
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:44,283
You're invited?

621
00:27:44,326 --> 00:27:45,987
No, he didn't invite me.
I have a gig.

622
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:48,292
He's paying me 10 grand to do a set.
It's a piece of cake.

623
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,526
- Are you the special guest?
- Yeah, so what?

624
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,091
- What's the big deal?
- Are you kidding?

625
00:27:52,135 --> 00:27:54,365
- It's $10,000.
- He's giving you $10,000?

626
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:56,668
- Yeah, so what?
- So what?! That's my money.

627
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,606
I'm paying for you.
You're my money.

628
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:00,370
- What do you mean I'm your money?
- Don't you understand?

629
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,971
I gave him $10,000.
He's giving it to you, so I own you!

630
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:04,605
This is not San Quentin.
I have a gig for Christ...

631
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:06,206
I don't care.
You're not going in!

632
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,979
Why are you taking this so personally?!
This is just business!

633
00:28:08,018 --> 00:28:09,610
No, it's not business.
What are you doing?

634
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:11,280
- You're not going in there.
- I am going in there.

635
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:12,847
- Don't tell me what to do.
- You're not going in.

636
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,882
Hey, what's wrong?
Oh, come on.

637
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:16,860
I hit you in the thigh,
you big baby.

638
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,487
I got long balls.

639
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,998
- Long balls.
- Long balls.

640
00:28:27,974 --> 00:28:30,204
Lakers down by two
with seconds remaining.

641
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:31,835
He drives up the lane.

642
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,813
Blocked, rebound. Lakers...

643
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:37,406
Blocked, re...

644
00:28:37,451 --> 00:28:39,043
...lane.
Blocked, re...

645
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:41,611
Lakers-
Lakers- Lakers...
