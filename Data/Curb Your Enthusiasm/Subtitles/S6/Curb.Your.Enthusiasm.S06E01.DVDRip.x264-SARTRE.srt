1
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:23,889
What is that?

2
00:00:23,923 --> 00:00:25,914
I don't know.

3
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,351
What is that,
a cell phone?

4
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,603
God.

5
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,912
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

6
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,918
Oh, it's a smoke alarm.
The smoke alarm's going off.

7
00:00:57,957 --> 00:01:00,391
It's the stupid batteries.
Come on, we've gotta find it.

8
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,126
No, it's not
that one.

9
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,194
It's not that one.

10
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,033
No.
Try the guest room.

11
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,872
I think
it's downstairs.

12
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,205
I don't think
I have any feeling

13
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,740
in my shoulders,
I swear to God.

14
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,649
- It does take its toll, man.
- Take its toll...

15
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:35,813
- You did very well, by the way.
- You don't have to condescend.

16
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,413
No, seriously,
for a guy who doesn't play,

17
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,322
I thought he did
very well. You did.

18
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,951
You never play.
What do you want from yourself?

19
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,859
- Give yourself a break.
- One thing I want to tell you,

20
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:44,761
- after you hit the ball six, seven times...
- Yeah?

21
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:47,095
...and it's not in the hole,
just pick it up and we'll move on.

22
00:02:47,133 --> 00:02:49,931
- You shouldn't take more than seven.
- Yeah, that's just craziness.

23
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,062
Just pick up the ball.
He's right, yeah.

24
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:54,335
- You'll never have to experience me again.
- No, we had fun.

25
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,739
Didn't you have fun
with us, hanging out?

26
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,675
It was a little boring,
to be honest with you.

27
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,406
- That's a nice thing to say.
- Well, it fucking was.

28
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:04,348
Okay, give me back my $150
that I spent on your guest fee.

29
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,545
You paid $150 for me to look
like a fucking asshole?

30
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:10,078
More shocking footage
from Hurricane Edna

31
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,921
- which has left extensive destruction.
- These poor people.

32
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,291
The storm surge
inundated low-lying areas

33
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,489
- knocking out phone and power lines.
- Oh, boy.

34
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,225
That's from global warming,
that hurricane.

35
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,063
33 deaths have been reported
and thousands left homeless.

36
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:23,898
Look at that-
thousands of homeless people now.

37
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,030
FEMA is estimating damage
from this category 5 hurricane

38
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:27,471
in the billions
of dollars.

39
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:31,068
Oh, wow. It's Katrina
all over again. Poor people.

40
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,078
Did you go
to Funkhouser's party last night?

41
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,875
No. Did you?

42
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,075
No. Huh-uh.

43
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,777
Why?

44
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,786
Because I'm going
to Danson's party tonight.

45
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,788
Two back to back...

46
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,653
I don't want to go
to two parties back to back.

47
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:46,659
It was a stupid night
for him to have a party.

48
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,184
- Yeah.
- Did you call him?

49
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,322
No.

50
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:54,265
- Well, what are you gonna say?
- I'll tell him Sammy was sick.

51
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,427
You're gonna use your child
to get out of a party?

52
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,994
- Why not? It's the best thing in the world.
- It's a perfect excuse.

53
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,097
- No one can argue with that.
- Who argues with that?

54
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,370
I wish I had that.
It's a great reason to have kids.

55
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,707
It's a great reason to have kids.
It's one of the bonuses, yep.

56
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:09,237
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna say?

57
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,842
- You have nothing, nothing.
- I know.

58
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,114
I'll just show up tonight
and pretend I had the wrong night.

59
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,121
- That's stupid.
- That's great.

60
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,851
- Oh, please.
- No, that's fantastic. I love that.

61
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:20,984
Yeah. Ding-dong-
"Where's the party?"

62
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,824
- Isn't that a good idea?
- That's a great idea.

63
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,160
He's not gonna buy that.
That's such obvious bullshit.

64
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,063
No, it isn't. Nobody would go
out of their way

65
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,432
that much- to show up
at somebody's house,

66
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,061
pretend they had
the wrong night.

67
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,628
He's gotta be a mental case
to believe it.

68
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,867
No, I love that.
That's fantastic.

69
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,841
Have you ever seen Richard
look in the mirror?

70
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,345
Is that really
what I do?

71
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,611
- You happy now?
- Yeah.

72
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,515
- All right, I'll see you at Danson's?
- Yeah.

73
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,382
- Okay.
- Thanks for turning me off

74
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,217
to a sport forever.

75
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,882
It's okay. Are you gonna
go tonight?

76
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,689
Uh, I don't know.
I have to ask Cha Cha. I'll see.

77
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,125
- Cha Cha.
- Cha Cha.

78
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,893
Where did he get her from?
Man, oh, man.

79
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,230
- She is so hot.
- Good for him.

80
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,032
- Good for him.
- Yeah, good for him. Let him enjoy.

81
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,699
- She's somethin'.
- Yeah. Wow.

82
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,332
- All right.
- All right, my friend.

83
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,400
- See you at Danson's.
- I'll see you at Danson's.

84
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,436
Okay. What are you
gonna wear?

85
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,345
I'm gonna dress
like a little Dutch girl.

86
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,217
"What am I wearing?"

87
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,690
I can't stop thinking
about the hurricane.

88
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,488
Oh, my nose is really itching me
and I can't scratch it.

89
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:31,759
I mean, the pictures on TV
were just...

90
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,494
you can't even imagine
that people survived it.

91
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:35,831
I know,
it's awful.

92
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:37,699
Awful. I was watching
it today.

93
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,195
All these people-
they have no place to go right now.

94
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,208
Hey!
Hey, dum-dum,

95
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,210
go ahead, move in.

96
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,213
- Thank you.
- Their houses were completely destroyed.

97
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,215
You know what my father
used to call those people?

98
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,376
Schmohawks.
Did I ever tell you that?

99
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:55,012
- Yeah.
- Have I mentioned schmohawks to you?

100
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:56,885
Schmohawk.
"Hey, schmohawk!"

101
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:59,084
- He used to yell it out all the time.
- Imagine for one second

102
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:02,822
if we lost- if you lost
every single thing you had in your life.

103
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,523
What do I have?
I don't know what's so...

104
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,725
- what do I have?
- This is- well, there...

105
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,496
- I like this sport jacket. I can't replace this.
- Listen, when there's...

106
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,264
you know what
some people are doing,

107
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,205
that I personally think
is a really great idea,

108
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,073
is they're bringing in
displaced families.

109
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,839
- Hmm.
- You know,

110
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,846
I've been doing
a little research

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
and we could actually
have a family here tomorrow.

112
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,806
- What?
- Yeah.

113
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,716
- Tomorrow?
- They have no place to go.

114
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,983
I would need
a couple of months

115
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,886
to mentally prepare for that.
Tomorrow?

116
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,788
We don't have
a couple of months.

117
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:35,020
These people
need help right now.

118
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,291
It's a nice concept.

119
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:41,528
Uh, you know,
we'll think about it.

120
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,899
We don't need to jump
into this thing right now.

121
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,166
Imagine how
they would feel

122
00:06:46,205 --> 00:06:48,230
to come here
and live in our house.

123
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,572
Mmm. Oh, all right,
we're here.

124
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,339
We're at Funkhousers'.

125
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,211
Why aren't we just going
to Ted and Mary's, Larry?

126
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,045
This is so stupid.

127
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,074
- This is so stupid.
- What? Are you kidding?

128
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,712
There's nothing to it. We'll just pretend
we had the wrong night.

129
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,155
This way he feels good- that at least
we attempted to go to his party.

130
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,091
Can't we just go
to Ted and Mary's?

131
00:07:07,126 --> 00:07:09,594
We're gonna go to Ted
and Mary's after we do this.

132
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,257
It won't take long.
It's two minutes.

133
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,397
- Hey.
- Hey, Marty.

134
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:25,002
What happened
to you guys?

135
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:27,410
Where-
where is everybody?

136
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,915
You mean,
from the party?

137
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,385
Oh, they've been gone
for about 24 hours.

138
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,547
- The party was last night.
- Last night?

139
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,113
A great party.
Oh yeah, we had a lot of fun.

140
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:39,647
- Are you kidding?
- We never heard from you.

141
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,319
- Oh my gosh.
- The party was last night.

142
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,328
- We sent you an invitation.
- Oh, Marty.

143
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,592
Oh my God,
that is unbelievable.

144
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,531
- I guess we mixed up the dates.
- We missed the party?

145
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,467
- Totally missed it.
- How did that happen?

146
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,265
Oh, it was
a great party.

147
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,101
This may be the dumbest thing
I've ever done in my life...

148
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,438
- well, we've ever done.
- You guys thought the party was tonight?

149
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,103
Yeah, obviously.

150
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,805
Everyone else
was here.

151
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:02,371
You know what? I swear
I had a feeling. I really had a feeling.

152
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,975
- Anyway...
- Anyway, it's so good to see you.

153
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:07,315
- Tell Nan I'll call-
- We're gonna get...

154
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,321
No, look look look
look look,

155
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,323
you're here- come on in.
Come on.

156
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:13,257
What? Get out of here.
We don't want to impose on you.

157
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,351
You're not imposing.

158
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:17,225
You're tired from last night.
You were up late with your party.

159
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,288
- Get out. Are you nuts?
- Yeah, we wouldn't dream of it.

160
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,266
Don't worry. We've got
some food left over,

161
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,097
got some games to play.
Come on in.

162
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,659
No, but it's crazy.
We don't...

163
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,899
- We would not dream of it.
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.

164
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,736
You have no plans,

165
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,571
you're supposed
to be here,

166
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,636
and you're here.
So come on in.

167
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:37,880
Come on, Cheryl.
Come on.

168
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,646
Come on in.

169
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,621
Come on in.

170
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,146
Come on.

171
00:08:46,158 --> 00:08:48,126
Come on, Larr.

172
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,151
Come on, Larry.

173
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,530
Well, I'll tell you this:

174
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,694
- you missed a great party.
- I'm sure, yeah.

175
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,601
- It was a lot of fun.
- Oh...

176
00:08:58,638 --> 00:09:01,573
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
I'm sorry we missed it...

177
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:03,507
Yeah, well,
we didn't wanna miss it.

178
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,943
- Obviously, we're here.
- No, but you know what-?

179
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:07,946
Let me tell you
what we did.

180
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,210
We had
an hour and a half

181
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,683
of the greatest
improv karaoke singing

182
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,777
- you've ever heard in your life.
- Oh, boy.

183
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,549
We're sorry we missed it.
And you know what?

184
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,489
- We shouldn't be here right now.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

185
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:21,823
- We really should go.
- No no no no no. I'm not heaping guilt.

186
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,591
- I think we're gonna get going.
- No no, don't go anywhere.

187
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,157
- No no no, sit down, sit down.
- We're gonna get out of here.

188
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,361
- Please, oh, stop it!
- Sit down!

189
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,371
Come on, sit down.

190
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,465
I'm okay with it.
And stop feeling bad.

191
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:38,033
We're here now.

192
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,944
You know what game I love
that we didn't play last night?

193
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,777
It's- and we play it
for money...

194
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,578
"1000 pick-up sticks."

195
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,848
I go get the sticks,
I throw them all over the room

196
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,878
and we pick up the sticks.

197
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,117
And the one with the most sticks
wins the pot.

198
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,353
- That sounds good.
- Are you expecting company?

199
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,384
Yeah, what is this?
You got company?

200
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,226
- Now we're intruding on your company.
- I'll get rid of them.

201
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,427
- Now it's really crazy.
- Please relax. I'll get rid of them.

202
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,571
Are you guys
expecting company?

203
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,436
- Hi.
- Hey.

204
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,464
- What are you doing here?
- The party.

205
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,709
Where's everybody?

206
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:16,943
Just a little note:
the party was last night.

207
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,315
- What do you mean?
- What are you talking about?

208
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,115
- The party was last night.
- It's tonight.

209
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,178
Well, guess who else
thought it was tonight?

210
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,053
Who?

211
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,150
- What are the odds?
- Yeah, what are the odds?

212
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,787
- Oh my God, how about that?
- We're just gonna go.

213
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,990
They had the wrong night
just like us!

214
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,295
- That's unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

215
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,233
- No no no.
- See you later.

216
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,236
- Come on in.
- No. No, listen...

217
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,261
We're gonna have a little
get-together tonight.

218
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,104
- No no, we'll go. Cheryl, we'll go.
- We'll go, we'll go.

219
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,609
We'll all go.

220
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,134
- Don't go anywhere.
- We'll go.

221
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:48,510
No, don't go anywhere.
Listen to me.

222
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:51,277
- We're gonna have a little party tonight.
- Well, not a party...

223
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,150
What the hell are you doing?
You stole my wrong-night bit.

224
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:56,017
I didn't steal it.
I give you full credit.

225
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:58,046
It's a brilliant idea.
I told Susie

226
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,785
- it was your idea.
- We're never getting out of here.

227
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,656
- We'll be out of here in five minutes.
- Five minutes?

228
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,595
- Trust me. Five minutes.
- Let me tell you something:

229
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,564
there's no way you're
making Danson's party tonight.

230
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,965
- We are locked in here. This is it.
- "Locked in."

231
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,094
- Five minutes- we're out of here.
- Oh, really?

232
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:12,866
- Watch. Five minutes.
- Oh yeah? You watch.

233
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,533
So, is this fun
or what?

234
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,204
- The cake is wonderful.
- The cake is incredible.

235
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,872
- Best cake ever?
- Best cake I ever had.

236
00:11:20,913 --> 00:11:22,813
Ever. And who's ever had
more cake than me?

237
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,078
- Exactly. He's right about that.
- Do you love that?

238
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:26,846
What is the deal? I've never tasted
anything like that.

239
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,683
- Everything is handmade.
- Where did you get it?

240
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,951
- I'm sucking on it like a mint.
- At a cake shop.

241
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,289
- What was the shop?
- That's a new way of eating cake.

242
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:35,554
Wait, I need
to find- where?

243
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,357
26th Street Bakery,
we got it.

244
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,694
- You know Jeff- he can't stop...
- The texture.

245
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,326
- All right, this has been-
- Yeah, we gotta get going.

246
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,268
- We gotta get going.
- Has this been better than you thought?

247
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,271
- We gotta get going.
- Yeah, thank you.

248
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:48,569
- No, I've gotta get going.
- No no, we gotta get going.

249
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,666
My daughter is waiting
for a puppet show.

250
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,735
- My dad has a virus. He's in bed...
- Larry's dad's got a virus.

251
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,008
- ... with fever, with covers up to his neck.
- We shouldn't be here.

252
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,072
Your dad always
has a virus, okay?

253
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,346
- Fuck you, he doesn't always have a virus.
- Hold it one second.

254
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,512
You guys stay here,
keep him company.

255
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,455
- We have to do something for Sammy.
- You stay here then.

256
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,616
- You stay.
- You stay.

257
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,353
You stay.

258
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,054
- Oh.
- Hold it a minute.

259
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,858
You guys were supposed
to be here

260
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,864
to go to a party,
right?

261
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,025
You got nothing
going on.

262
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,331
Father sick,
puppets...

263
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,860
tomorrow you'll take your puppets
over to his father's house

264
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,873
and make him
feel better, okay?

265
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,365
We're gonna have fun.
And guess what our next move is.

266
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,811
- What?
- We're going into the living room

267
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,714
and we're gonna play
"The Newlywed Game."

268
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,651
- Yes.
- Because we played it last night

269
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,745
and it was
spectacular.

270
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,517
Oh my God!

271
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:39,956
Yes, that's great.

272
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,960
Do I know my husband?

273
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,292
- Unbelievable.
- You are good at this.

274
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,764
- Okay, next question.
- Okay, all right.

275
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:49,063
That was great.
"If you could have sex

276
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,934
with one of your friends'
wives or girlfriends,

277
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,871
who would it be?"

278
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,272
Ooh.

279
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,072
- That's a dangerous one.
- Okay.

280
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,341
- All right.
- Hold on, hold on.

281
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,281
- Tell me when you're ready. I'm ready.
- I think we got this.

282
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,181
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready.

283
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,914
- I'm gonna go first, okay?
- All right.

284
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,817
I will say, Cheryl,
that you are adorable.

285
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,123
Thank you.

286
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,687
Susie,
you dress great.

287
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:21,825
Yeah, well,
that's my forte, Marty.

288
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,325
But when I really
think about it,

289
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,498
I've gotta go with my little poofer.

290
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,701
Look at the...

291
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,040
Oh my God.

292
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,841
- Oh my God.
- Oh, man.

293
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,848
- Oh, God.
- That's cute.

294
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,248
- How about that? How about that?
- Isn't that great?

295
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,412
- Go go, I wanna hear yours.
- That is great.

296
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:43,421
- Hold it, hold it, hold it.
- Okay.

297
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,151
- You're next.
- All right.

298
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:49,992
I'm gonna go with...

299
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,463
- Cha Cha.
- Cha Cha? Wow.

300
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,399
- Cha Cha? Lewis's girlfriend?
- Yeah, Cha Cha.

301
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,861
Oh my God, I had no idea
you had a thing for Cha Cha.

302
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,430
What are you talking about?
I don't have a thing for Cha Cha.

303
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,874
Richard's girlfriend?

304
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,571
- What?
- That was a dumb answer.

305
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,580
- Oh, stop it.
- I mean, I had no idea

306
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,980
that you've been- that you wanted
to have sex with Cha Cha.

307
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,177
I don't want to have sex with her.
I'm answering the question.

308
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:16,586
- What was the question, Marty?
- "Who do you want to have sex with?"

309
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:18,852
- Who did you put down?
- Obviously, there's a fantasy going down.

310
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,916
- Oh, get me involved now.
- Who did you say?

311
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,451
- Who were you gonna say?
- I was gonna answer Susie.

312
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,929
- Good answer.
- Oh, God, you're both full of shit.

313
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:29,264
- Exactly.
- You are full of shit.

314
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:31,963
- You are full of shit.
- I love my wife.

315
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:34,336
- Oh, you're all so good.
- I didn't even know about Cha Cha.

316
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,500
You love your wives.
Fuck you and fuck you.

317
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,171
Oh, you're the one that's mad.
I love it.

318
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:46,975
Come on, honey.
I don't care about Cha Cha.

319
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,987
I was trying
to win the game.

320
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:52,252
You thought she was sexy. I thought
that's what you would write down.

321
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,226
Cheryl, come on.

322
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:57,752
I don't-
come on, what can I do?

323
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,993
What can I do?
I'll do anything. Come on.

324
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,502
Anything?

325
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:06,504
Well, you know,

326
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,473
short of adopting
this hurricane family.

327
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:17,115
I can't wait
to get to the airport

328
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,117
to see the family.
It's so exciting.

329
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:20,709
- Are you excited?
- Mmm.

330
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,586
We'll finally get to meet them.
They're gonna be so happy.

331
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:25,522
The guy on the phone was saying
how excited they were

332
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,889
when they got on the plane
'cause they'd never been to L.A. before.

333
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,055
I can't wait to see what they look like.
I know that sounds weird,

334
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,996
but I've been talking,
you know, to them...

335
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,562
...and about them,
you know...

336
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,594
Yeah.
I just...

337
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:44,098
I just want to make one quick stop
before we go.

338
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,180
- Hey.
- Hey.

339
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:52,206
What are you guys
doing?

340
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,946
What's-
what's going on?

341
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,514
What do you mean?

342
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,425
- Where's everybody?
- We thought there was a party.

343
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,624
Oh my God, you thought
the party was tonight?

344
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,723
- Yeah.
- Last night.

345
00:16:07,766 --> 00:16:09,961
- What?
- The party was last night.

346
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,993
- Are you kidding me?
- No, man.

347
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:14,437
- That's unbelievable. What?
- I can't believe it.

348
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,772
- We got the wrong night?
- Yeah, you did.

349
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,176
- Oh, shoot. All right.
- Jesus Christ. Holy cow.

350
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,941
I'm actually glad
to hear this.

351
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,347
I was a little pissed off
that you didn't call.

352
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,510
- Oh, well, now you know why we didn't call.
- Yeah.

353
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,715
- Hey, Mary.
- Of course. We were coming tonight.

354
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,723
- Come on in.
- Oh, no no. We're not gonna come in.

355
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:35,158
- Yeah, come in, seriously.
- We got the wrong night. It's our fault.

356
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,992
- Hey, Mary.
- They thought the party was tonight.

357
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,294
You're kidding.

358
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,300
Can you believe
how stupid we are?

359
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,097
- All right, it's good to see you.
- Larr.

360
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,400
- We'll call you later.
- No way you're leaving.

361
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:48,599
This is fantastic.
We have so much leftover food.

362
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,198
You're gonna come in
and help us eat it.

363
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:52,267
I'll call you tomorrow
and we'll get together.

364
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,302
- We'll do the whole-
- Why?

365
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,371
- We'll do a proper-
- I'll take you out to dinner. I'm paying.

366
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,009
Hey, Larr, you don't have
any plans,

367
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,814
you're supposed to be here,
you're here.

368
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,650
Come on in.
Come in, Cheryl. It'll be fun.

369
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,294
Well...

370
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,489
This'll be fun. We've got leftovers.
We'll make an omelet.

371
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,328
- Sure. Oh yeah.
- You guys, we can't- we can't...

372
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,926
It'll be great.
Come on.

373
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,994
This is like pulling teeth.

374
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,029
Come on in,
you guys.

375
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,613
I don't know.
Can you still see it?

376
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,480
- Not like it was.
- A huge cyst.

377
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,315
It was like- when they
got around to taking it out,

378
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,651
it turns out I could have
almost broken my jaw

379
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,656
- by just chewing on ice.
- Oh my gosh.

380
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,851
- It got all the way down into here.
- But the dentist

381
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,454
really undersold
the magnitude of it, I think.

382
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,726
- Oh, completely.
- 'Cause you thought it would be nothing.

383
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,563
- Ever had any operations like that?
- No, huh-uh.

384
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,796
Hmm.

385
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,638
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

386
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,642
So what's going on
with you guys?

387
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,873
- Eh, not much, not much.
- Nothing.

388
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,938
You know something?
You're behaving like

389
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,949
- you don't want to be here, Larry.
- No.

390
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:07,645
- What?
- You want to be here, don't you, Larr?

391
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,881
Absolutely. That's crazy.
Of course I want to be here.

392
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,015
- I just feel I'm intruding, that's all.
- We are intruding.

393
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,684
I was raised
not to intrude on people.

394
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,990
My mother would be horrified-
horrified if she knew

395
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,997
that I was sitting
in the living room

396
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,226
the night after a big party
just took place...

397
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,598
horrified.
And it's bothering me.

398
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,865
Oh my God,
you know what?

399
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,134
I left the car
running.

400
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,767
- No, you didn't.
- How did you know I didn't?

401
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:32,868
If you walk away from the car,
it's on, and you got

402
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,845
your car keys in your hand,
it goes "beep beep beep beep beep."

403
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,871
No, it doesn't go
"beep beep beep beep beep."

404
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,507
Yeah, it does go "beep beep beep
beep beep," Larry.

405
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,040
- I have one too.
- Really?

406
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:42,053
- Do you want to make a little side bet?
- Yeah.

407
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:43,577
- How much?
- 500 bucks.

408
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,884
- Okay, 500 bucks?
- Yeah.

409
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:46,823
- Okay, yeah, you're on.
- All right, great.

410
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,224
Okay, I'm gonna go
check the car.

411
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,818
You check the car.
You stay where you are.

412
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,591
- She can do anything she wants.
- No no.

413
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,125
I'll get it.
This is ridiculous.

414
00:19:01,406 --> 00:19:05,001
Teddy, we're late. We're sorry.
You know Cha Cha, right?

415
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,477
- I do. Hi, Cha Cha. Nice to see you.
- Hi.

416
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,140
What's with the no-valet
for the party?

417
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,205
You need some dough?

418
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:11,739
Yeah, see,
you made a mistake.

419
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,751
You think that the party
is tonight,

420
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,753
but it was actually
last night.

421
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:18,381
- You're kidding, right? It's a joke?
- No, I'm not.

422
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:21,017
- So come on in and sit.
- No, it's...

423
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,084
- it's embarrassing.
- No no, it's not embarrassing.

424
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:26,154
You know, Larry and Cheryl made
the exact same mistake you did.

425
00:19:26,198 --> 00:19:28,063
- Come on in.
- Hi.

426
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,466
- Mary, Cheryl.
- You won't believe this:

427
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,470
they made the exact
same mistake you did, Larry.

428
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,904
They thought the party
was tonight. Interesting.

429
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,340
Yeah, it is interesting.

430
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,469
Can I get you guys a drink?
You want a drink, Richard?

431
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,445
Uh, I'm a recovering
alcoholic.

432
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,607
Oh, right. I forgot that.
He's an alcoholic.

433
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:46,379
- Okay, you want something?
- Hi, Cheryl, Mary.

434
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,511
- Remember Cha Cha?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

435
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,919
- Hey, Cha Cha.
- What are you doing?

436
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,513
What did you steal
my thing for?

437
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,491
- What thing?
- Showing-up-on-the-wrong-night thing.

438
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,755
What, do you have a fucking copyright
on this stupid little thing?

439
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,489
You're making a fool out of me.
He's onto me now.

440
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,622
You think you're making a fool of-
I'm being made a...

441
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,326
I got 35 calls.

442
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,459
Don't ever say to anyone you want
to have sex with my girlf...

443
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,470
I didn't say- we were playing
"The Newlywed Game."

444
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,369
What does that have to do with "I want
to have intercourse with Cha Cha"?

445
00:20:07,406 --> 00:20:09,874
I wanted to win the game. Do you even
know what I'm talking about?

446
00:20:09,908 --> 00:20:11,876
Okay, you know what?

447
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,208
I can't stay in the same house as him.
We're gonna go. Come on.

448
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:16,077
No no no, you know what?
I should go.

449
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,082
- No no no, I'm going.
- No no, I'm going.

450
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,107
- No no!
- No no, I don't think you understand.

451
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,949
- I have to go.
- No, I'm going. You stay.

452
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,454
- No, you stay.
- You stay.

453
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,080
- You stay. You stay.
- You stay. You stay.

454
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:27,614
- Ted.
- Sorry. Thank you for everything.

455
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,627
- So lovely.
- Bye-bye.

456
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,424
Good night.

457
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,962
Come on, schmohawk!

458
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,613
Oh, Larry.

459
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,516
Uh... hey.

460
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,291
Oh, gosh.

461
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,091
Look at them.

462
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,491
Hi.

463
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,000
Are you waiting for the Davids
by any chance?

464
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,627
- Yes.
- You are?

465
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,604
- Wake up, baby. Wake up, Auntie Rae.
- Oh my goodness.

466
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,164
- We're so sorry we're late, so sorry.
- Things happen, they do.

467
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,971
Well, you know,
traffic...

468
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,875
you'll see, in Los Angeles
it's terrible.

469
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,311
- I'm Loretta Black.
- Hi. Larry.

470
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,746
Cheryl.

471
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,773
- This is my Auntie Rae.
- Hello, I'm Larry.

472
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:28,251
- These are my kids, Keysha and Daryl.
- Keysha and Daryl.

473
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,812
So let me see,
your last name is Black?

474
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:32,153
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

475
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,489
It's like if my
last name was Jew,

476
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,518
like Larry Jew...

477
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:40,498
'cause I'm Jewish.

478
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,467
Well, we really do appreciate y'all
letting us stay with you.

479
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,936
- We really do. We appreciate it.
- We really do.

480
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,405
- No, I was just saying, 'cause
you're black... - Larry, grab...

481
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,271
- It's not too heavy for you, is it?
- No no.

482
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,073
- Get that-
- And I'm Jewish.

483
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,545
Thank you so much.
We really do appreciate it.

484
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,548
- It's not too heavy for you, is it, Larry?
- No.

485
00:21:57,582 --> 00:21:59,106
Thank you,
thank you.

486
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:02,279
Okay, say your last name
was Gentile...

487
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,313
- Come on in.
- Ooh, would you look at that?

488
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,451
- This is nice.
- This is real nice.

489
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,155
Oh, yes.
My goodness.

490
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,063
And spacious too.
I mean, just...

491
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,727
What do you think, huh?
Isn't it something? You like it?

492
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:18,827
It's a swank place you got here, Larry,
very swank.

493
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,394
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Oh, Auntie Rae.

494
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,339
Go go, you go
take a look around.

495
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:23,932
- Go ahead.
- Oh, thank you. Go on, babies.

496
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:27,069
- Don't touch anything.
- Yeah, I thank you, I thank you.

497
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,410
Mm mm! This is
a nice place.

498
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,611
Fixtures going
all along the staircase...

499
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,081
ooh-ee!
I can't believe this.

500
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,853
- We don't smoke in the house.
- Them curtains- just fabulous.

501
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:44,157
- And the couches- they so fluffy!
- Cigarette... smoking...

502
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,959
- Y'all got nice taste.
- Thank you.

503
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,624
- Where's the kitchen at?
- It's right around there.

504
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,032
I'm going.
I'm going.

505
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,729
- This is so great.
- She's smoking.

506
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,738
They're so great.

507
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:55,740
Oh, you know what we should do?
Let's have a party.

508
00:22:55,774 --> 00:22:58,208
Let's have a party and invite our friends
so they can meet the Blacks.

509
00:22:58,243 --> 00:22:59,938
- A party?
- Hey, you guys want to have a party?

510
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,775
- What?
- Yeah, Loretta?

511
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:03,804
What?
A party?

512
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,618
- We're having a big party.
- Uh-huh. You need a cake?

513
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,786
We do. A chocolate
layered cake.

514
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:18,693
We want to get
the same one

515
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,755
that Marty Funkhouser
gets.

516
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,359
Oh, yes. He's actually ordered it
a couple of times.

517
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,926
- Yeah.
- I have one

518
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,961
that I just
prepared recently.

519
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,768
I think it was the best cake
we've ever had.

520
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,604
- Unbelievable.
- We can't stop talking about it.

521
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,667
It is one of our
most popular cakes.

522
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,738
- I can understand why.
- Yes, and here he is.

523
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,050
- That's a penis.
- Yeah, well, we're an erotic bakery.

524
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:52,190
Oh my God.

525
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,994
This is where Marty
buys his cakes?

526
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:57,763
- I ate that?
- Yes, you ate this cake.

527
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,136
Funkhouser- he knowingly
served us penis.

528
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:03,733
- What is wrong with that guy?
- Let's go.

529
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,402
- What an idiot.
- Thank you. This is crazy...

530
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,571
- a crotch.
- The cake is delicious, by the way.

531
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,136
Thank you
very much, sir.

532
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,484
- I'll tell you, it was something else.
- She's right.

533
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,579
It was one of the scariest things
I've ever experienced in my lifetime.

534
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,523
- We are lucky we got out of there alive.
- Yes, we are.

535
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,390
- I want you to meet these guys.
- Okay.

536
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,452
I hope we're not too rude,
but we showed up

537
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:27,260
- the night of the party.
- Good one.

538
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,596
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

539
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,601
Let me ask you
a question.

540
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,500
How come you didn't tell me
that I was eating

541
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:34,937
- a black penis the other night?
- You mean the cake?

542
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,463
Yeah.

543
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,669
Well, I told you
it was a black log cake.

544
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,678
Yeah, still,

545
00:24:40,712 --> 00:24:43,772
I was eating a black penis.
You didn't mention it.

546
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:47,581
Well, eating a black penis
is not appetizing to everybody.

547
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,519
Next time you're gonna do
something like that,

548
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:50,953
tell me, okay?
I think that's unfair.

549
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,422
Why did you take
the balls home?

550
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:54,755
I didn't know
they were balls.

551
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,524
Excuse me.

552
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,033
Mm-hmm.
Yes, it was you.

553
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,632
Well...
Oh, boy oh boy. Hey.

554
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,232
- Hi.
- Hi, Cha Cha.

555
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:14,439
- Hi, Larry.
- I'm sorry about the other night.

556
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,879
I was just trying to win
"The Newlywed Game" is all.

557
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,712
Look, I'm over it.
I'm here.

558
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,274
- Believe me, I'm way over it.
- You know...

559
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,014
- Hey, everybody, who wants cake?
- I do, I do.

560
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:26,114
Oh, great great. The best cake
I ever had. Come on.

561
00:25:26,157 --> 00:25:27,749
...give you
a childish apology...

562
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,521
No, because it was
my routine and...

563
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,032
Jeff!

564
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,092
Jeff, the cake!
Jeff!

565
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:09,734
I'm...

566
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:11,998
I'm so sorry.
First of all,

567
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,471
you have to understand
something, okay?

568
00:26:14,506 --> 00:26:17,066
My friend Jeff
did not know...

569
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:20,509
did not know that there was
a penis in that box

570
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,513
when he picked that up
from the bakery.

571
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:24,708
He called in the order
and they gave him the box.

572
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,740
He didn't look
inside the box.

573
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,114
How's Keysha?

574
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,187
I finally got her to sleep.
She's upset.

575
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,217
Of course.
Of course she's upset.

576
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,594
Understandable.
To see a big penis like that...

577
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:42,429
what are you gonna do?
She's a little girl.

578
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,336
Okay, you know...

579
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,340
the smoking-in-the-house

580
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,842
I wanted to talk
to you about.

581
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,538
Um, is there any way

582
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,547
maybe you would
consider

583
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:59,550
smoking...

584
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,950
outside

585
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,955
on occasion?

586
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:06,583
How's the cake?

587
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,287
- Pretty good.
- Mmm.

588
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,795
Pretty... pretty good.

589
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,821
You want some?

590
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,264
Good night.

591
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,731
Good night.

592
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,625
- Where have you been?
- Ate some penis.

593
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,886
So what are we
gonna do now, L.D.?

594
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:20,727
Maybe some family
will adopt us.

595
00:28:20,765 --> 00:28:22,426
Holy moly.

596
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,329
What happened?

597
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,669
- A fire.
- Oh my God.

598
00:28:30,775 --> 00:28:32,743
What are you
doing here?

599
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:35,337
- Oh, I'm here for the party.
- The party?

600
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,144
The party was
yesterday.

601
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,980
What?

602
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,316
Yesterday.
The party was yesterday.

603
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:43,980
Oh, you're kidding me.
