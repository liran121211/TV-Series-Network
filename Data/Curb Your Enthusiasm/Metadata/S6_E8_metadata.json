While in the bathroom, he overhears one end of a very angry, horribly offensive cell-phone conversation. But he repeats what the man said and it offends another doctor: the one who is about to perform Jeff's operation. This results in Jeff's head getting shaved, so Jeff must now deal with being bald. Jeff prepares to sue the hospital, and Larry must give testimony.\u2014halo1k"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1104263", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 2036, "number_of_episodes": 120}
