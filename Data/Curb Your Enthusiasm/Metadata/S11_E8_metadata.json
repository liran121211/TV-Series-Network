She cooks for him some Jewish delights and plans a Seder for him. Her daughter Dierdre starts to feel that he is a father to her and she hopes Irma will marry him. In some future dreams, Larry fantasizes how Irma ( with Tracy's usual zany characters) talks to Larry as his mother from heaven telling Larry he needs Irma to be his wife, as in Fiddler!) A psychiatrist, ( Joanne Baron who appeared in the \" chicken episode) reappears to help Larry sort out his dream. The psychiatrist also sees Dierdre , her best friend, who from the other side tells the psychiatrist that Larry is the father she always wished she had. Dierdre makes gefilte fish for the Seder and Irma makes white horseradish which reminds Larry of his mom. At the Seder, Larry is overwhelmed with all the love and plans a wedding at his pool. Susie is contrite and Jeff eggs Larry on.\u2014pgoldman5"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "15243640", "rating": 8.5, "votes": 1571, "number_of_episodes": 120}
