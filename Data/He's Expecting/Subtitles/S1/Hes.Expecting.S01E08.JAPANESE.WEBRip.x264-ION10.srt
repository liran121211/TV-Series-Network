1
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:14,932
Hiyama has just been rushed to hospital

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,475
and will now be
taken into surgery immediately.

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,599
The hospital staff have said
that he was barely conscious,

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,767
and there is concern about his condition.

5
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,226
The conference was
broadcast live across the country…

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:26,146
Doctor!

7
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,488
Mr. Hiyama? Mr. Hiyama!

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,565
Hang in there. You're alright.

9
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,298
What are you doing?

10
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,721
Well, I saw the conference.

11
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,183
I'm going.

12
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,811
But there's, you know…

13
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,890
You saw the conference, right?

14
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,611
Yeah.

15
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,859
If you're still running away
after seeing that,

16
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,191
then go do as you please.

17
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:30,974
You're his father, aren't you?

18
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:32,966
Mr. Hiyama!

19
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,181
Have you been in contact with him?

20
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,011
-How is your son doing?
-Mr. Hiyama!

21
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,557
-Can we get a comment?
-How is your son?

22
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,228
Give us a comment!

23
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,439
Mr. Hiyama!

24
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,229
EPISODE 8

25
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,527
This might sting a little.

26
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,067
This will feel cold.

27
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,663
<i>Kentaro Hiyama, 37 years old.</i>

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,080
Let's start the caesarean section.

29
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,212
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,289
Let's do this, Mr. Hiyama.

31
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,039
Scalpel.

32
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,837
How long did it take with me?

33
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,596
I don't remember.

34
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,481
But…

35
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,853
it felt so long.

36
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,530
What a strange life.

37
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,156
Both my husband and my son giving birth.

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,910
I should be saying that.

39
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:48,586
Getting pregnant as a man.

40
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,922
"Unexpected things happen in life."

41
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:56,969
"The way you approach those situations
is what makes you who you are."

42
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,358
I ran away a lot.

43
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,149
Sorry.

44
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,790
Too late.

45
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,999
-Sorry I'm late.
-Aki.

46
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,261
Can I wait with you?

47
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,471
Of course, have a seat.

48
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,466
Thanks.

49
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,739
I caused a lot of trouble.

50
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,413
I'm really sorry.

51
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,459
I won't let him do things like this again,

52
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,039
so please go easy on him this time.

53
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,495
It's fine, please sit down.

54
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,149
Which of you are Mr. Hiyama's family?

55
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,113
Me.

56
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,405
Congratulations.

57
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,242
The baby is premature,
but we managed to deliver it safely.

58
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,735
Really?

59
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,246
Thank you.

60
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,619
The pediatrician is doing some checks.

61
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,207
Please wait here a while.
I'll call on you again.

62
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:55,749
-Wait--
-I…

63
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,086
Yes?

64
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,181
Is Kentaro okay?

65
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:06,255
Don't worry.
Both the father and the child are well.

66
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,427
Excuse me.

67
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:27,157
Mr. Hiyama, here's your baby.

68
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,872
-Could you move your arms?
-Yeah.

69
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,504
Now sit up slightly.

70
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,166
There you go.

71
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,593
So tiny.

72
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,725
Your family members are here.

73
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,808
Kentaro!

74
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,896
Ma?

75
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,320
Well done.

76
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,106
-Wow.
-Thank you.

77
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,780
Dad.

78
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:03,911
Aki.

79
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,570
It's our kid.

80
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,250
This baby's too cute.

81
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,794
Yep.

82
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,510
-Can I hold the baby?
-Sure.

83
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,216
-Momma's here!
-She's your mother.

84
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,926
I'm Aki.

85
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,230
Are you awake?

86
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,397
I'll come back later. Take your time.

87
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,323
Okay.

88
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,199
So cute.

89
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,913
Alright, alright.

90
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,079
Let's take a photo
of the kid and the parents.

91
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,615
Alright.

92
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,292
Here we go.

93
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,252
Alright, alright.

94
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,958
-Is that a smile?
-Or speaking?

95
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:02,093
-Shall I take one more?
-Yes, please.

96
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,383
Alright, Kentaro.

97
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,175
<i>Alright, Kentaro.</i>

98
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,300
What are you doing?

99
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,637
Oh, right. Here goes.

100
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,982
-That was a smile!
-Really?

101
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:15,979
Say cheese.

102
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,532
BIRTH REGISTRATION FORM

103
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,857
How should we write the name?

104
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,864
Let's have a single phrase
expressed in one character.

105
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,371
-Birth registration?
-Yes.

106
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,214
KO "JOY" HIYAMA

107
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,133
<i>I feel like there's more awareness lately.</i>

108
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,183
<i>Maternity goods for men are being made</i>

109
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,338
<i>and people see things with less prejudice.</i>

110
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,724
<i>I hope it keeps getting even better.</i>

111
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,932
<i>Thanks for that coverage.</i>

112
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,688
<i>Isn't it incredible?</i>

113
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:04,318
<i>Doesn't this show how much</i>
<i>Japanese society has progressed?</i>

114
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:08,649
<i>What do you think, Yamaki?</i>

115
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,618
<i>I think it's something to be celebrated.</i>

116
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,409
They really say whatever they want.

117
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,905
They were so critical
at the press conference.

118
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,115
Yeah, but that's just how it is.

119
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,745
They just see what's popular at the time.

120
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,208
Right?

121
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,054
True.

122
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,295
Come to think of it, you're no different.

123
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,885
-Me? How?
-Yeah.

124
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:37,814
You said some pretty nice things
at the press conference

125
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,732
but you expected me to deliver
some dogmatic idea of femininity

126
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,401
and to play the motherly role.

127
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,610
-You said totally different things.
-No…

128
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,398
It was an updated version.

129
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,663
You were pretty pleased with yourself.

130
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,568
No, I wasn't being smug.

131
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,538
The words just naturally flowed out of me.

132
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,540
Right.

133
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,381
I was just repeating what you've said.

134
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,841
I've absorbed the things
you talk about a lot.

135
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,126
I'm easily influenced by you.

136
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,054
Oh?

137
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,257
Can we switch?

138
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,014
-What?
-Please.

139
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,677
-Here's your mom.
-Come here.

140
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,347
-Come here, Ko.
-Alright.

141
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,692
I'll get tendinitis doing this.

142
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,822
Now, let's go outside.

143
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:33,202
Can you look after Ko tomorrow afternoon?

144
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,321
I've got a meeting.

145
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,947
-In the afternoon?
-Yeah.

146
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,794
Okay…

147
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:43,251
Do you really need to work right now?

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,590
I need to get all of this done
within the hour you're helping out.

149
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,670
Can you keep on like this?

150
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,585
What?

151
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,470
You're going to Singapore in a few months.

152
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,641
That's right. They postponed it for me.

153
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,966
Not the best timing.

154
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,137
I couldn't help it.

155
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:03,305
I reacted before I had time to think.

156
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,984
You can't rely on your parents, huh?

157
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,982
I did send my sister a photo.

158
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,408
Can you feed the baby some milk?

159
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,121
-Sure.
-Here.

160
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,988
-Slowly.
-Slowly?

161
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,501
Like this?

162
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,749
It's in!

163
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,130
Is that tasty?

164
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,415
Lots of problems, huh?

165
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,379
Your poor mommy!

166
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,143
Huh?

167
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,353
Gross, Aki?

168
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,442
-Aki?
-What?

169
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,399
-What about this?
-What's "this"?

170
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,984
-Poop.
-Oh man, this is bad.

171
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,687
What is it? Poop?

172
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,861
Here, diapers. Go over there.

173
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,655
-No way.
-They're in here.

174
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,986
Thanks. Hello?

175
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,492
-Yes, within the next hour.
-Aki!

176
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,537
-That's right, yes.
-No…

177
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,456
Please kindly arrange a meeting

178
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,764
to discuss that matter next week.

179
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,758
So unhelpful!

180
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,550
The salon is getting so many more members!

181
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,894
Yeah.

182
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,258
TV coverage has been positive lately, too.

183
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,928
Seems promising.

184
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,015
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

185
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,903
We've been relying on Hiyama's brand,

186
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,072
but if we're able
to increase membership like this,

187
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,608
we could make it a business.

188
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,942
-You're right.
-Sorry.

189
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,147
What's wrong?

190
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,658
-Sorry, sorry.
-Alright.

191
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,528
-I'm sorry.
-Hey.

192
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,656
-Let me try.
-Okay.

193
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,288
-I'm taking this off.
-Thanks.

194
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,120
Come here, little Ko.

195
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,580
Alright, here we go.

196
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,248
Okay.

197
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,547
What?

198
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,380
-Here, here.
-How?

199
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,136
I'm the parent.

200
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,179
I guess I'm no good.

201
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,933
No, Hiyama.

202
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,644
Your baby strap might be too big.

203
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,306
With a newborn,
you're way better off with a strap

204
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,765
designed for younger babies.

205
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:11,855
I'll show you later.

206
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,112
Spoken like a true veteran.

207
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,445
You'll get used to it gradually.

208
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,568
We're all here for you.

209
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,115
Let's help each other.

210
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,121
So let's move quickly

211
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,120
to make the salon into a business.

212
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:29,869
You guys.

213
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,001
Thank you.

214
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:36,884
That's enough.

215
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,724
Come on, sit down.

216
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,929
-Have a seat.
-There you go.

217
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,390
-Wanna sit too, Ko?
-Sit down.

218
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,010
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

219
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,767
Alright.

220
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,523
There.

221
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,813
I'm so grateful that you stuck by me…

222
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,227
even after my dad caused all that trouble.

223
00:12:59,028 --> 00:12:59,948
Thank you.

224
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,414
What are you saying?

225
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,661
We got our money back.

226
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,753
We're not fussed about it.

227
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:11,748
Yeah, we're all in the same boat.

228
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,674
Thank you.

229
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,177
We're home.

230
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:29,981
Aki?

231
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,145
We're home.

232
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,447
Aki.

233
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,865
Huh?

234
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,669
-We're home.
-Welcome back.

235
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,838
Sorry, I fell asleep.

236
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,092
I'll clean up
as soon as I've sent an email.

237
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,136
-Tonight…
-Yeah?

238
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,430
Let's have my mom look after Ko
and us two go out for dinner.

239
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,482
-Can we?
-Yeah.

240
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,983
-Thanks for waiting.
-Thank you.

241
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,355
It's been so long since I ate hot food

242
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,942
-while it's still hot.
-Right?

243
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,820
Man…

244
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,658
-What a relief.
-I could look at this forever.

245
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,833
Another round.

246
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,161
-Two beers please!
-Coming up.

247
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,577
What's with this menu?
Everything looks so delicious.

248
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:37,787
-Still got room?
-Yeah.

249
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,667
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

250
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,924
Are these stir-fried sausages
those mini octopus-shaped ones?

251
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,508
-That's right.
-Really?

252
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,723
-I want it.
-And the simmered beef and tofu.

253
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,763
Got it.

254
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,806
-Ready?
-Okay.

255
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,057
-The suspense is killing me.
-Ready?

256
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,268
-Look!
-Whoa!

257
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,900
Such perfect skin!

258
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,148
-Wow…
-Stayed fast asleep.

259
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,653
-This would be a good wallpaper.
-Isn't it great?

260
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,486
-Sure would.
-It's great.

261
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,991
We've ended up looking at photos of Ko.

262
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,253
True, even though we came here to be free.

263
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:15,712
Yeah.

264
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,543
Thanks for asking me out.

265
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,207
I'll thank your mom later, too.

266
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,126
Sure.

267
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,904
It's totally different
from what I imagined before the birth.

268
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,821
Yep.

269
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,609
The reality is pretty tough.

270
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:45,992
Yeah.

271
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,367
Hey, Kentaro.

272
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,997
I've given it some thought.

273
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,793
Maybe Singapore would be too difficult.

274
00:15:58,874 --> 00:15:59,714
What?

275
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:03,882
I have to give an answer next week.

276
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,718
I'm thinking of turning it down.

277
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,097
I'll keep working still.

278
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,848
But going abroad--

279
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,310
No, stop.

280
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,810
Then it'll be pointless, Aki.

281
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,439
-But realistically…
-Aki.

282
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,609
None of us should sacrifice ourselves.

283
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,150
Not you, me, nor Ko.

284
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,737
We should all be the priority.

285
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,411
Let's value everyone's life here.

286
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,536
So be true to yourself,

287
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,290
and go to Singapore.

288
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,295
That gives me courage.

289
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,510
Thank you so much.

290
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,430
We appreciate really it.

291
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,389
<i>You're very welcome.</i>
<i>I'm happy to spend time with Ko, too.</i>

292
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,518
<i>Please ask me any time.</i>

293
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,978
Thank you.

294
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,556
-See you, then.
<i>-Yes.</i>

295
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,268
Okay.

296
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,148
-I thanked her.
-Appreciate it.

297
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,358
Look at this message from my boss.

298
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:14,664
What is it?

299
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,949
What's it about?

300
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,081
Asking me to be the main ambassador again.

301
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,126
I guess the salon's getting a good rep

302
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,300
and public perception has changed.

303
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,929
What a smooth talker.

304
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,480
-Listen, Kentaro.
-Yeah?

305
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,559
Why don't you quit?
It's such a two-faced company.

306
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,265
No, that would be such a waste.

307
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,686
What's a waste?

308
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,235
First, I'll take proper parental leave

309
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,324
and get what I can.

310
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,946
Then, once my leave is finished,

311
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,043
I'll try to negotiate
so I can work shorter hours.

312
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,119
On top of that, I'll turn the salon
into a business and work hard on it.

313
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,127
Is the company really that understanding?

314
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,540
I'll make them understand.

315
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,087
I'm going to talk with them
about having a cot in the office

316
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,223
for when you're abroad
or when there's no one to look after Ko.

317
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:15,591
Very bold.

318
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:20,181
Companies and businesses
need to update, too, not just us.

319
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,020
There we go.

320
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,855
Lately, the updates
have increased in gigabytes.

321
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,778
-To the latest model?
-Yeah.

322
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,487
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

323
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:36,912
It's a great help.

324
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,873
-It'll fly by.
-Sure.

325
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,825
Thanks.

326
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,881
-I'll see you out.
-You don't have to.

327
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,632
Let's go together.

328
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,223
I appreciate it.

329
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,128
Hiyama.

330
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,840
Hey Tanabe.

331
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,466
-Did you get the nursery documents?
-Yep.

332
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,096
Our company is surprisingly understanding.

333
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,393
Parental leave, huh?

334
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,557
You've changed, Hiyama.

335
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,477
Yeah.

336
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,565
I miss competing with you for promotions.

337
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,901
Tanabe, I'm tackling a new challenge now.

338
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:18,117
It's really fun and really tough.

339
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,408
If our promotion squabbles
were a marathon,

340
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,702
then now it's a triathlon.

341
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,664
-Well, hallelujah.
-Hey!

342
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,291
-See you later.
-Sure.

343
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,666
-Bye.
-Bye.

344
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,549
<i>So, you're on leave.</i>

345
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,264
I wish I could take a break, too.

346
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,184
I'll be focusing on raising my child.
It's not a break.

347
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,347
Honestly, I thought you'd quit.

348
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,981
But I don't dislike
your determination either.

349
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,065
Thanks for that.

350
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,242
I realized something.

351
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,621
Interrupting my career to have a kid

352
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,159
doesn't necessarily mean
lowering my sights.

353
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,497
I'm actually developing as a person,

354
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,044
so one day this experience

355
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,285
will surely be reflected in my work.

356
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:13,916
Yeah.

357
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,591
-Hiyama.
-Yes?

358
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,932
Don't be so pleased with yourself.

359
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,063
What?

360
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,059
It's always been like that for us.

361
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,188
Our "hero" is not quite there yet.

362
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,860
Honestly, men!

363
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,611
They're all bloody idiots.

364
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,613
Makes you laugh, doesn't it?

365
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:40,695
I suppose it's also a good thing.

366
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,031
-I've always thought so.
-Really?

367
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,196
Okay, this is enough.

368
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,204
-Here's fine.
-You sure? Okay.

369
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,116
-Thanks.
-Have a good one.

370
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,035
See you.

371
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,724
<i>Unexpected things happen in life</i>
<i>one after the other.</i>

372
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,193
<i>I never expected dealing with them</i>
<i>would be so tough…</i>

373
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,690
-Thanks.
-Yes, sir.

374
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,731
<i>So complicated…</i>

375
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,276
Hello!

376
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,992
Sorry I've been out of touch.

377
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:23,871
Can I feel?

378
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,989
<i>Yet it's joyful…</i>

379
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,412
<i>and full of richness.</i>

380
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,536
Is it salty?

381
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,753
It's sweet.

382
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,844
-Sweet?
-Yes.

383
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,299
Really?

384
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,507
Empty out your tray!

385
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,008
<i>I never expected</i>
<i>that my priorities would change.</i>

386
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,013
-The balls!
-Oh, right.

387
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,522
<i>Thanks for looking after Ko.</i>

388
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,650
<i>I'll be back next week.</i>

389
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,650
You should stay there
until you get a handle on things.

390
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,903
It's a big opportunity.

391
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,819
Right, Ko?

392
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,909
Huh? What?

393
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,582
What's wrong?

394
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,701
<i>-Is everything okay?</i>
-What's wrong, Ko?

395
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,417
<i>I will be back next week, okay?</i>

396
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,377
Thanks.

397
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,550
What's wrong all of a sudden?

398
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,338
<i>-Hey, look.</i>
-Huh?

399
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,223
<i>Turn Ko to face me.</i>

400
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:27,505
Look, Ko. Your mom has something.

401
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,716
<i>It's Froggy!</i>

402
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,805
<i>-Are you gonna cry?</i>
-Seems like it.

403
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,731
<i>Maybe it's scary.</i>

404
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,598
-Hasn't gone down well.
<i>-Isn't it cute?</i>

405
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,555
Such long legs!

406
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,904
That things legs are

407
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,189
so unnecessarily long.

408
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,645
Creepy, huh?

409
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,944
Look, that's a "too creepy" face.

410
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,951
Look, now.

411
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,738
Come on.

412
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,332
Look.

413
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:06,302
BABY ON BOARD

414
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,101
Are you okay?

415
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,266
You're pregnant, right?

416
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,652
Sorry I didn't realize earlier.

417
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,228
Go ahead.

418
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,863
-Thank you.
-Sure.

419
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:32,077
Must be tough. How many months is it now?

420
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,910
I'm still only two months in.

421
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,792
There's so much I don't know yet.

422
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,035
Sorry, thanks.

423
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,957
It's fine.

424
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,512
