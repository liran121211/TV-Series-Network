1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,716
Here we are in front of
Kentaro Hiyama's house in Setagaya Ward.

2
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:12,851
As you can see,
a lot of reporters are here.

3
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,179
Hiyama has caught everyone's attention
as a pregnant man…

4
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:19,596
TANABE: THE PRESS IS AT OUR OFFICE
SO STAY HOME

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,984
INCOMING CALL: MIYAJI

6
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,414
Miyaji?

7
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,372
<i>Sorry to call suddenly.</i>

8
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,452
It's fine.

9
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,455
<i>Are you okay?</i>

10
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,881
What?

11
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:27,498
<i>I passed your house on a delivery just now</i>

12
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,296
<i>and saw loads of press outside.</i>

13
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:34,391
Yeah, I'm somewhat trapped now.

14
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,509
<i>That's tough.</i>

15
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,020
<i>I'm nearby,</i>

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,890
<i>so if you need anything dropped off…</i>

17
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,152
No, I…

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,730
Well…

19
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,702
If it's okay…

20
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,238
could you get me some nursing pads?

21
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,502
EPISODE 7

22
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,879
-Long time no see.
-Been a while.

23
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,459
Excuse me.

24
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,428
Thanks so much. It's a great help.

25
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:15,639
Not at all.

26
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,636
I was out doing deliveries anyway.

27
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,015
Do you have some time?

28
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:30,479
Sure.

29
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,241
We had the funeral the other day,

30
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,160
so I finally feel at peace.

31
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,869
Sorry for not being in contact.

32
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:49,376
No, I'm sorry myself.

33
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,630
You never know
what life's gonna throw at you.

34
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,100
I mean, look at you.

35
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,635
You suddenly found out
that you were born from your dad.

36
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,556
Yeah.

37
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,483
I never thought I had a father,

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,073
then he suddenly
called to me on the street.

39
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,570
Seriously?

40
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,361
I'd like to meet your dad too, Hiyama.

41
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,157
He was an awful person.

42
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,244
But…

43
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,081
it still gave me hope.

44
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,213
What?

45
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,301
That someone born from a man

46
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,257
could grow up to be as great as you.

47
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,722
Me? No…

48
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,934
Maybe your father was selfish…

49
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:48,135
but I understand where he was coming from.

50
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,015
If I were in his place,

51
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,149
I'd be glad to see you doing well
and I'd come to meet you.

52
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,536
I'm so sorry.

53
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,262
I told you that jerk would run away.

54
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,102
What a despicable man.

55
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:32,059
Well, he's probably gambling
at his usual pachinko parlor.

56
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:34,728
What?

57
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,360
<i>He never changes.</i>

58
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,964
Wait, are you really going?

59
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:50,869
Why?

60
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,835
I feel like you'll only keep suffering

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
if you get any more involved with him.

62
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,086
That's not the issue. He's my father.

63
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:03,969
I know, but…

64
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:08,561
he's already caused all this trouble.

65
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,725
The baby will be born soon, too.

66
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,022
-That should be your priority--
-Sorry, Aki.

67
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,613
This is my family's problem.

68
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,653
I'm sorry,
but this is none of your business.

69
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,451
You're not the one giving birth.

70
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,201
I'll be back.

71
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,808
I guess I'll get going then.

72
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,900
-Hey, Aki.
-Yes?

73
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:03,987
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,781
Um, I…

75
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,580
I'm sorry my son spoke so hurtfully.

76
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,541
No, it's fine.

77
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:17,503
I remember being told something similar.

78
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,085
"It's not like you're giving birth."

79
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,513
"It doesn't even matter to you."

80
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,433
Oh…

81
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:30,101
But what could I do?

82
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,185
It's not like it happened
because I wanted it to.

83
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,188
But still,

84
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,269
he'd look at me like I was forcing
the responsibility on him.

85
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,686
That's…

86
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,700
actually what it's like now.

87
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,619
I mean…

88
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,042
the pregnant man
isn't the only one who suffers.

89
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,631
Right?

90
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,183
I'm probably wrong, but are you pregnant?

91
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,055
Nope.

92
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,895
Right, sorry.

93
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,728
Would it be a problem if I were pregnant?

94
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,987
No, not a problem.

95
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,493
I just asked because I was curious.

96
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,239
My apologies.

97
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,199
So then I always cut
any mini sausages in his lunchbox

98
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,958
to look like little octopuses.

99
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,749
That's adorable.

100
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,995
But when he reached high school,

101
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,587
he said, "Quit the octopus thing already!"

102
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,013
He'd had enough.

103
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,801
I did it because I thought he liked it!

104
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,796
I'm craving those mini octo-sausages now.

105
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,555
I'll make some for you.

106
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,732
Still, in the end,

107
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,066
I was always conscious deep down

108
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,529
that I didn't give birth to him myself,

109
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,821
so I tried to be even more motherly
than anyone else.

110
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,077
I'd always pack lunches for him

111
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,328
and I joined his open classes
even after a night shift.

112
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,996
I poured everything into doing my duty,

113
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,004
and before I knew it, here I am today.

114
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,965
This is a life I chose myself,

115
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:32,801
so I'm satisfied.

116
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,138
Still, sometimes…

117
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,149
I do think there's more to life
than just being a mother.

118
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,990
Maybe things would be different nowadays.

119
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,881
-Can I say something?
-Sure.

120
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,177
Even you could suddenly become pregnant.

121
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,771
-See you.
-Yes, good night.

122
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,861
TAKAGI: LET ME KNOW ABOUT SINGAPORE
BEFORE NEXT WEEK.

123
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,450
Hey!

124
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,747
Don't hide, old man. Hey!

125
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,671
What are you doing?

126
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,255
Why did you run away?

127
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,431
I'm talking to you!

128
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,678
Hey!

129
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,685
-Here.
-I don't want that.

130
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,439
Answer me already.

131
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,784
-Answer me!
-Okay, okay.

132
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:54,358
Come on, don't yell at me like that.

133
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:59,034
I told you, my ticker's in bad shape.

134
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,576
-I'm very sensitive.
-Don't mess with me.

135
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,134
So? What is it?

136
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,297
I'm asking you why you ran away.

137
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,255
Twice!

138
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:19,218
Have you ever thought about
the people you leave behind?

139
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,103
No, I get it.

140
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,691
I really do.

141
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,185
I want to apologize
from the bottom of my heart.

142
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,611
Then don't run away.

143
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,242
Perhaps…

144
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,238
I've got into the habit of running away.

145
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,418
After I gave birth to you…

146
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,169
people around town were merciless.

147
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,917
Calling me gay or sick and shunning me.

148
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,677
Looking at it now,

149
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,427
I know they were all wrong.

150
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,556
But at the time…

151
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,149
I didn't know what to do,

152
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:14,185
so I ran away.

153
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:19,661
Pretty pathetic, huh?

154
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,454
Sorry.

155
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,535
Oh.

156
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,514
Alright.

157
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,273
Here's the money I gathered from everyone.

158
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,556
-Return it yourself.
-I've had enough.

159
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,105
I'll let you handle it.

160
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,146
But…

161
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,737
-Thanks.
-Hey, young man.

162
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,530
Let's leave it at that today.

163
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,659
He'll return the money when he has it.

164
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,663
He's an honest man.

165
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,786
It's not like that, Mat-chan.

166
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,544
-What?
-This is my son.

167
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:17,884
You've got a son, Chief?

168
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,263
-Yep.
-"Chief"?

169
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,974
I told you before.

170
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:26,852
I told you the pregnant guy
on TV ads lately is my son.

171
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,351
-Really?
-Yeah, this is him.

172
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,193
-That was real?
-Yes.

173
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,518
I thought you were just
making stuff up again.

174
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,984
You cheeky sod!

175
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,944
What a surprise.

176
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,112
I have seen you before.

177
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,954
Oh! Wait here.

178
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,856
I'll fetch everyone.

179
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,618
Don't do that, Mat-chan.

180
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,699
You don't need to fetch anyone.

181
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,325
Hey, you idiot!

182
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,865
-Hey!
-I'm leaving.

183
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,997
Okay, go.

184
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh.

185
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,014
You are you. Live your own life.

186
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,967
I'm me. I'll manage.

187
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,131
Huh?

188
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:40,296
-You're still here.
-Yeah.

189
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,840
I need to talk with you.

190
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,013
Talk about what?

191
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,938
Listen, Kentaro.

192
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:01,855
I've given it a lot of thought.

193
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,914
I'm thinking…

194
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,913
I want to accept…

195
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,709
the Singapore offer.

196
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:23,415
Of course, I intend
to go back and forth often,

197
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,586
and this job is also well-paid,

198
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,053
so I can pay proper child support.

199
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,807
I've not changed my mind
about raising this kid with you.

200
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,267
Listen to me.

201
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,315
Like you said,

202
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:56,035
I'm not pregnant
and I won't be giving birth.

203
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,668
So that means…

204
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,923
I can't play the role of a regular mother.

205
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,390
So, what about me?

206
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:16,929
How should I behave?

207
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:26,114
When I thought about what sort of mother…

208
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,034
I wanted to become…

209
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:34,373
I realized something.

210
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,205
I want to make my child
proud of their mother.

211
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,049
who stays true to herself.

212
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:53,852
I see.

213
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,057
Don't worry.

214
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,523
Understood.

215
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,533
UNIVE wants to drop Hiyama?

216
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,450
We're in trouble if that happens.

217
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,029
All the other sponsors will pull out, too.

218
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,287
But he's always been estranged
from his father, right?

219
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,869
Yes, he didn't even know he was alive.

220
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,995
That part needs to be clearly explained.

221
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:26,093
He has no connection with his father
and is himself totally clean.

222
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,756
Let's have a press conference.

223
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,842
Agreed.

224
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,554
Good way to cool things down.

225
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,177
We're counting on you two.

226
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,926
Understood.

227
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,516
Hello? Did something happen?

228
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,523
<i>No.</i>

229
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,404
<i>The press conference is soon, right?</i>

230
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,646
<i>Are you alright?</i>

231
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,321
It'll work out.

232
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,908
You don't need to worry about me.

233
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,368
Go ahead.

234
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:45,865
You setting off soon?

235
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,498
Yeah, I'm at the airport now.

236
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,170
<i>Take care. Do a good job out there.</i>

237
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,169
Same to you.

238
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,013
-Thanks.
<i>-Bye, then.</i>

239
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,273
Is your pregnant boyfriend alright?

240
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,481
He's fine.

241
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,265
-But he's not my boyfriend.
-Sure, sure.

242
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:13,027
I just heard
from the coordinator over there.

243
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,990
They said they'll arrange dinner
for us tonight.

244
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,114
-Really?
-Yeah.

245
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,237
Thanks.

246
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:27,209
<i>I would like to take this opportunity</i>

247
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,671
<i>to apologize for the trouble </i>

248
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,841
<i>my father caused in the past,</i>

249
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,590
<i>which has caused a great deal</i>
<i>of worry and inconvenience to many people.</i>

250
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,184
<i>I am truly sorry.</i>

251
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,219
REVEALED: HYPOCRITE!

252
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,314
You were estranged
but recently started a business together?

253
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,600
JUST DISGUSTING

254
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,063
Were you actually quite close?

255
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,483
No, I met him
for the first time a few months ago.

256
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,022
Didn't your mother ever talk about him?

257
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,146
I was told he'd died.

258
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,453
You deny any responsibility
for the fraud committed by your father.

259
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,528
It's also true
that until the press covered it,

260
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,155
I had absolutely no idea

261
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,581
about my father's past money issues.

262
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,120
So Hiyama, going forward,

263
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,285
surely you'll carry out
your proper duty as a pregnant man

264
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,424
to make up for your father's misdeeds?

265
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,420
My "proper duty" as a pregnant man?

266
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,086
Yes, can you promise that?

267
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:24,217
Excuse me,
what's a pregnant man's "proper duty"?

268
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,136
What?

269
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,144
You mean,
behave as a pregnant man "should"?

270
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,387
What? Well…

271
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,558
What are “roles” anyway?

272
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,489
Being manly, womanly,

273
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,491
motherly, fatherly.

274
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,870
Why put people in boxes
like ideal father and ideal mother?

275
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,616
I found out I was pregnant six months ago.

276
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,745
I've had nothing
but very unmanly experiences since.

277
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,219
My nipples leak breast milk.

278
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,927
I've now got a formidable sweet tooth.

279
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:05,056
People give me strange looks.

280
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,886
I've had a hard time at work.
It's been such a mess.

281
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,397
<i>I'm not making excuses for him,</i>

282
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,609
<i>but my father surely</i>
<i>went through this struggle, too.</i>

283
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,820
<i>Prejudice used to be worse back then.</i>

284
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,447
You know,

285
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,752
unexpected things happen in life.

286
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,833
<i>That goes for you.</i>

287
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,286
You, you, and you too.

288
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,005
You never know
what position you'll be in tomorrow.

289
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,220
<i>But the way you approach those situations</i>

290
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,353
<i>is what makes you who you are.</i>

291
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,349
<i>That's one of the great joys of life.</i>

292
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,350
My father…

293
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,241
isn't someone people would admire.

294
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,411
<i>But still…</i>

295
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,744
<i>the one thing he did show me,</i>

296
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,083
as his son,

297
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,631
was how to live a life true to oneself.

298
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,683
Since I became pregnant…

299
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,063
I've met so many different people.

300
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,734
<i>Everyone has their own hurdles</i>

301
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,147
<i>and their own ways of overcoming them.</i>

302
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:46,525
<i>Only after spending time with those people</i>

303
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,615
<i>have I finally realized that.</i>

304
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:53,414
To everyone who helped me
make such an important realization…

305
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,794
Everyone…

306
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,249
I am extremely grateful.

307
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,144
Thank you so much.

308
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,309
You're going pretty off-topic.

309
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,309
Please answer the questions properly.

310
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,021
That's it from me.

311
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,691
-Mr. Hiyama!
-Excuse me.

312
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,018
-Are you running away?
-Wait!

313
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,015
Looks bad, pal.

314
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,981
Mr. Hiyama?

315
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,476
What happened?

316
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,897
<i>Are you okay?</i>

317
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,485
<i>What a scoop!</i>

318
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,110
<i>Are you alright, Hiyama?</i>

319
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,994
Sorry, I have to go.

320
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,286
What? Wait, Seto!

321
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,245
-Mr. Hiyama!
-Hiyama, are you okay?

322
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,836
-Hiyama?
-An ambulance!

323
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,798
Call an ambulance!

324
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,342
-Hiyama…
-Mr. Hiyama!

325
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:52,346
KENTARO HIYAMA
DUE IN -- DAYS

326
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,146
Can we get a comment?

327
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,901
Thank you.

328
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,071
How about quitting?

329
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,359
He's not quite there yet.

330
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,322
-I'm counting on you.
-Yes, sir.

331
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,362
We can't sacrifice ourselves.
