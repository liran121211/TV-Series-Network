1
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,354
Didn't your dad die?

2
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,522
That's what I thought.

3
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,572
Apparently he died right after I was born.

4
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,688
Is it okay for him to be in your home?

5
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,034
He knew my mom's name.

6
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,565
She's on her way here now.

7
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,204
Alright.

8
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,825
-She's here.
-Yeah.

9
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:43,042
Hey, where's that girl?

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,094
Sweetie, you there?

11
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,090
-Yes?
-Got any chopsticks?

12
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:48,302
He's here, right?

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,971
-Chopsticks?
-Yeah.

14
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,180
What for?

15
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,839
I've got this <i>yakisoba</i> sandwich…

16
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,007
Oh, it's Tomoko!

17
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,676
Long time no see.

18
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,595
What's with the sexy uniform?

19
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,015
Ouch!

20
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,772
You promised you'd never let him see you.

21
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,436
Why are you here?

22
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,824
You knocked out my crown!

23
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,111
Who cares about your teeth!

24
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,065
Okay?

25
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,454
-Mom.
-What the hell?

26
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,870
Calm down.

27
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,238
This jerk

28
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,994
abandoned us.

29
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,038
My crown's come out.

30
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,581
He abandoned us
when you were newborn.

31
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,915
He left!

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,750
-Because of that--
-My crown!

33
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,205
Shut up about your teeth!
You caused us so much pain!

34
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,376
Mom!

35
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,756
-Calm down.
-How can I be calm?

36
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,471
I said, my crown's come out!

37
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,801
Screw your crown!

38
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,639
EPISODE 6

39
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,438
Here's a change of clothes.

40
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,065
Cheers, pal.

41
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,237
Feel free to use the washing machine.

42
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,241
You'll wash my clothes for me?

43
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,664
So kind, thanks.

44
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:14,089
FEBRUARY 9, 1984
KENTARO

45
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,471
Man,

46
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,643
your mom sure was pissed.

47
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,364
-You okay?
-Yeah.

48
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,900
How many weeks now?

49
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,111
I've just entered my 21st week.

50
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,697
Oh, yes.

51
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:45,915
It gets stressful
because you can't sleep on your front.

52
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,747
-Your pee starts leaking too.
-Yes.

53
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,841
Still,

54
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,930
she's got energy.

55
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,432
To think, she used to complain
about back pain…

56
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:07,808
So…

57
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:13,902
was I really born from you?

58
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,623
Yep, that's right.

59
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,695
I know it's a bit rich saying this

60
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,326
after causing you so much trouble,

61
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,133
but I've been wanting
to meet you for so long.

62
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,634
Yeah.

63
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,380
I've left you a toothbrush and razor here,

64
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,836
-so feel free to use them.
-Cheers.

65
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:45,062
I'm so sorry you had to witness that
on our first meeting.

66
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:45,981
It's okay.

67
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,898
TOMOKO HIYAMA
CONDOR TAXIS

68
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,400
TO A HEALTHY BIRTH

69
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,656
Have you done this job for long?

70
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,954
For about 20 years.

71
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,583
My memory's vague
because I’ve done all sorts of things

72
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,541
since I moved here with Kentaro

73
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,079
after that man left us.

74
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:14,884
It's a pity, huh?

75
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,423
No, I…

76
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,219
I think it's incredible
that you raised him

77
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,926
by yourself like this.

78
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,856
You're incredible.

79
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,266
What?

80
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,857
When I got pregnant,

81
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,738
I kept myself out of sight.

82
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,235
But now,

83
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,829
we live in a world like this.

84
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,789
What about clinic visits?

85
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,549
I got ferried about
from one clinic to the next.

86
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,511
Some thought I might really be a woman.

87
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,770
All these big-shot doctors gathered around

88
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,639
and stroked my belly.

89
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,774
It was so humiliating.

90
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,936
People are somewhat more considerate now.

91
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,823
You can share info with others
via the online platform, too.

92
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,034
What's that?

93
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,366
It's a website on the internet.

94
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,372
This is it.

95
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,789
I created a space for pregnant men
to interact with each other.

96
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,589
MATERNITY SALON FOR MEN GIVING BIRTH

97
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,593
People post information on here.

98
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,925
-Wow.
-Yes.

99
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,560
-Very useful.
-Yeah.

100
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:57,646
You and I are similar after all.

101
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,737
I was also always thinking

102
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,490
about how pregnant men could be happy.

103
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,037
How they could keep their manhood
despite being pregnant.

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,670
Suits that hide your belly, for instance.

105
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,337
I thought it'd be so useful

106
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:21,459
to have a members-only maternity clinic.

107
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,763
I came up with all sorts.

108
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,971
I see.

109
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,053
But you know, Kentaro…

110
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,347
you must be pretty brave…

111
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,816
to have come this far.

112
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,238
I understand. I'm your dad.

113
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,623
Dad…

114
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,155
Yep.

115
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,584
Must've been tough all alone.

116
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,625
Well done.

117
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,457
Dad.

118
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,553
Now, now.

119
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,098
It's okay.

120
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,926
Here, what's wrong?

121
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,095
It's alright.

122
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,688
Alright! I've decided.

123
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,862
Here's what we'll do.

124
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,611
-Let's join forces.
-What?

125
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,735
See, I'm working on a project now.

126
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,662
Let's make it happen together.

127
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,160
With two pro pregnant daddies,

128
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,124
it'll be a sure success.

129
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,504
No doubt.

130
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,075
Alright!

131
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,842
No time to waste.

132
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,921
For the time being…

133
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,176
-let's live here together, okay?
-What?

134
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,221
If you're not eating, I'll have it.

135
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,846
No, I'm almost done.

136
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,900
You're always so pressured.

137
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,515
-Why don't you relax a bit?
-No way.

138
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,487
It's not easy to make a living
in this line of work.

139
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,912
-Right, sent it.
-Woo!

140
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,584
Nice one.

141
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,125
-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-No worries.

142
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,170
Hey.

143
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,890
Can you really raise a kid like this?

144
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:33,967
What?

145
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,311
In my case,

146
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:41,018
I live like this because I enjoy my work

147
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,693
and I've not had kids yet.

148
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,899
But in your case,

149
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,362
isn't it time you rethink
the way you handle work?

150
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,374
I forgot.

151
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,372
What now?

152
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:02,924
Kentaro's dad is supposed to be dead,
but he suddenly appeared yesterday.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,290
-In a dream?
-No.

154
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:09,007
-No, I'll explain next time.
-Oh?

155
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,760
I've been asked to look after him

156
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,012
until Kentaro gets home today.

157
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,352
I can't finish this. Eat it if you like.

158
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,891
Sounds like a blast!

159
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,476
-Please wait a while.
-Sure.

160
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,249
Please stay positive.

161
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,370
Okay.

162
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,456
If your condition changes, let us know.

163
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:47,384
Right.

164
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:51,756
Well, take care.

165
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,051
-Thanks for your help.
-Thank you.

166
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,005
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

167
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,112
I don't want to be friends with someone
who only likes people who make them tea.

168
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,612
If that's your attitude, I'm out too!

169
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,985
What happened?

170
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,201
Listen, I asked this girl here--

171
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,782
Can you stop calling me "girl"?

172
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,620
I asked this fair lady here,

173
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,875
"Would you be so kind
as to serve me a cup of tea?"

174
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,538
That's all.

175
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,627
That's a lie.

176
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,380
You said, "Girl, tea!"

177
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,473
"Such fine green tea
must be cooled to 60 degrees."

178
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,509
So I said,

179
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,182
"This isn't a free hostess bar."

180
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,351
No, you said,
"If you want some tea

181
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,930
the vending machine downstairs
will be quicker."

182
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,097
Who says that?

183
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,685
But it <i>would </i>be quicker.

184
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,400
This woman will say
such cold-hearted things

185
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,942
to a harmless old man like me!

186
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,737
-"This woman"?
-Okay, stop it already.

187
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,701
If you want tea, I'll make some.

188
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,872
Honestly.

189
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,077
Look now!

190
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,331
Now, now.

191
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,632
-What?
-Look at this.

192
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,799
I spent today making a business plan.

193
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,129
What do you think?

194
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,594
"Maternity products for men"?

195
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,510
Sure, but a lot of companies
are already developing products.

196
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,724
"Underwear so you don't need
incontinence pads"?

197
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:28,685
Yes, it's underwear
made from absorbent material.

198
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,191
Wear a pair of them, and you don't need

199
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,395
one of those incontinence diaper pads.

200
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,278
True, it is annoying,

201
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,084
changing pads all the time at work.

202
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,738
-And I worry about people noticing.
-Yeah.

203
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,828
There's a lot of hype
around women's underwear

204
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,634
that removes the need for sanitary towels.

205
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,299
Maybe a male version could fly.

206
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,630
Right? It's a trend.

207
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,717
There's nothing for men. See?

208
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,852
-Exactly, not yet.
-Still, after all,

209
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,730
the most important thing
is how to promote it.

210
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,813
Aki, this is your area. Could you help us?

211
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,147
Alrighty.

212
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,991
Let's make our fair lady head of PR.

213
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,530
Glad you're on my team, son.

214
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,454
What?

215
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,532
You should start doing PR work now

216
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:26,247
for when you can't
make a living writing anymore.

217
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,618
-For when I can't make a living?
-I like it!

218
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,996
Yeah, that's right.

219
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,752
There are no men's sanitary undies yet.

220
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:34,707
I see.

221
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:36,918
Aki?

222
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,092
Aki, wait.

223
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,559
Wait. Aki!

224
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,429
I'm sorry.

225
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:51,186
Fair enough if you want
to get to know your dad,

226
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,770
but don't drag me into it.

227
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:55,935
Drag you into it?
I just asked for your help.

228
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,322
This project is my dad's dream.

229
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,646
I keep wondering,

230
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,410
why do women always have to
help men pursue their dreams?

231
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,793
Yet women chase their own dreams
by themselves.

232
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,710
It's not such a big deal as that.

233
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,130
Dad's just happy to have more family now.

234
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,040
Okay.

235
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,006
Who will you raise our kid with,
me or your dad?

236
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,130
"It's either your job or me," right?

237
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,808
No. I'm asking what your intentions are.

238
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,481
Well, my dad has a lot of time now,

239
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,020
so he can devote himself,
and he's experienced a lot,

240
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,863
-so I'm thinking of asking him.
-Right, got it.

241
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,237
Okay, I'll also work with that in mind.

242
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,945
-Wait…
-See you.

243
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,660
Go, Yuto!

244
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,669
Great! Go!

245
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,288
Go!

246
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,673
Here it is!

247
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:01,087
Alright, one more!

248
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:03,758
Mom.

249
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,636
See you later.

250
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,431
-See you.
-Bye.

251
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,175
Absolutely not.

252
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,399
You can't start a business with that man.

253
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:19,068
I've got a full-time job,
so it would just be a side hustle.

254
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,239
-Even so, no way.
-Really?

255
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:26,615
That man will never follow through.

256
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,988
He'll run away if anything happens.

257
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,365
That's…

258
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,592
Mom.

259
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,799
Why didn't you tell me about him?

260
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,305
How could I?

261
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,899
How could I tell you

262
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,485
that your father abandoned you?

263
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:08,201
Mr. Hiyama? Eiichi Hiyama?

264
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,155
Yes.

265
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,373
<i>At the time,</i>

266
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,331
<i>pregnant men were still very rare.</i>

267
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,502
<i>So…</i>

268
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,803
<i>people would stare wherever he went.</i>

269
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,261
Can you believe a man getting pregnant?

270
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,762
Seems like it's a real thing.

271
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,718
Maybe he'd just lost heart.

272
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,668
<i>After giving birth to you,</i>

273
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,456
<i>he suddenly just quit his job</i>

274
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,674
<i>and did nothing but gamble.</i>

275
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,257
<i>You can stay for free in my room!</i>

276
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:17,517
<i>My father couldn't bear to see it,</i>

277
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:21,061
<i>so he had us look after</i>
<i>their inn back home.</i>

278
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,566
Don't be such an idiot.

279
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,819
Have a shave too! We're serving customers.

280
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:27,742
I'm sorry.

281
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,240
But before long,

282
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:34,873
rumor spread that he'd been pregnant.

283
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,002
See you later.

284
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,161
Speak of the devil.

285
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,998
The baby's coming!

286
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,923
Don't be rude to the mother.

287
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,252
Daddy, give me a nipple too!

288
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,007
Stop it, that's gross.

289
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,220
<i>That man and I planned to raise you well,</i>

290
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,466
<i>no matter how coldly</i>

291
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:59,017
<i>other people treated us.</i>

292
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,704
It's pouring!

293
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,948
Look, it's raining.

294
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,162
It's your dad!

295
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,003
Welcome back.

296
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,594
Wait, where are you going?

297
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:39,523
<i>He ended up running away.</i>

298
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,685
<i>He threw away everything.</i>

299
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,359
Didn't you look for him after that?

300
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,408
No need to go looking.

301
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,039
He came to me begging for money.

302
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,408
I still don't think
he's such a bad person.

303
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:06,288
He's kept a photo of me
from when I was born.

304
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,836
That's just a con man's trick.

305
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:10,762
What?

306
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,048
Think of all the hardship
we've been through to get here.

307
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,810
You'll throw it all away for that man?

308
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,689
Wait, how come?

309
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,701
-Hello Hiyama.
-Hey.

310
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,072
When did you all connect?

311
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,577
You know this online platform?

312
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,830
It's very handy.

313
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,621
Everyone wanted to meet me
when I said I'd given birth.

314
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,128
He told us about when you were born.

315
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,339
What a trooper.

316
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,418
We have it so easy now compared to you.

317
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,464
Totally.

318
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,427
I was just telling everyone
about my business.

319
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,429
What?

320
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,430
This guy works at a design studio,

321
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,523
so he could make us some samples.

322
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,058
I wish we had underwear like this.

323
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:08,019
I always leak when I sneeze.

324
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,225
I hear you!

325
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:11,534
But I hate buying incontinence pads.

326
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,858
-Yeah.
-Right.

327
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,493
Breast milk pads, too.

328
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,570
Yeah.

329
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,784
Breast milk pads, incontinence pads…

330
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,485
Everything on the market is pink!

331
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,826
How dare they try emasculate us!

332
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,668
We have a right to live like men
even if we're pregnant.

333
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,578
Right?

334
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,746
-Can't argue with that.
-Alright!

335
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,835
Brilliant.

336
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,419
I'll speak with our designers tomorrow.

337
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,296
Let's start crowdfunding, too.

338
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,933
-Alright.
-Timing is crucial.

339
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,011
We could bring these two together.

340
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,887
-Yeah.
-I like it.

341
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,393
When's the baby being born, again?

342
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,273
The due date is in September.

343
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,685
Right.

344
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:56,775
But I'm so nervous
about whether we can do it.

345
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,862
With your husband?

346
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,356
He's not my husband.

347
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,202
We'd planned to raise
the kid together, that's all.

348
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,786
I guess I'm just not suited
to stuff like marriage.

349
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,343
So you're free now.

350
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:12,957
What?

351
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,594
Why don't you work for us in Singapore?

352
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,554
What?

353
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,761
We're hosting an art festival next season.

354
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,426
We need an editor for the guidebook.

355
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,635
I'd like you to do it.

356
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,646
This looks so interesting!

357
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,192
-I'd love to do it.
-Nice!

358
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,824
I'd need to relocate, right?

359
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,695
Yeah, just for two years.

360
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,953
I know the baby's on the way,

361
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,285
but loads of men go away at that stage,

362
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,871
-for their career.
-Yeah.

363
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:51,536
Didn't you want
to build your career like this?

364
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,964
It's a good opportunity.

365
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,255
Hello?

366
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,680
<i>Hello. Where are you now?</i>

367
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,755
I just met with an old colleague

368
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,104
who offered me a job.

369
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,731
<i>Really? That's great.</i>

370
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:14,019
I'd have to go to Singapore for two years.

371
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,016
Singapore?

372
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,108
<i>I've not answered yet.</i>

373
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,071
He also knows we've got a baby on the way.

374
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,818
But I've not been
this excited about work in ages.

375
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,196
I've always wanted to do this kind of job.

376
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,326
<i>Aki.</i>

377
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,622
You'll say no, right?

378
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,545
Well, I told him I'd think about it.

379
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,878
<i>If you go abroad now,</i>

380
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,384
<i>who will look after the kid?</i>

381
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,758
Well…

382
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,596
<i>I've got my job, too,</i>

383
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,560
<i>and this project with my dad</i>
<i>looks like it'll go ahead.</i>

384
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,812
So I wanted you
to look after the kid for a while.

385
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,034
Sorry.

386
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,413
-I have to go, my train's here.
-Okay.

387
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:07,446
<i>So…</i>

388
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,814
Hello?

389
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,725
<i>Hiyama?</i>

390
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,570
<i>It's Orita. Where are you?</i>

391
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,938
What's happened?

392
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,526
<i>It's bad. Come straight away.</i>

393
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,076
TRENDSETTER KENTARO HIYAMA'S FATHER
SUSPECTED OF FRAUD!

394
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,210
HIYAMA'S DAD, THE SUSPECT,
WAS ALSO A PREGNANT MAN!

395
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,839
Surely not.

396
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,222
<i>The father of Kentaro Hiyama, </i>

397
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,549
<i>the much-talked-about pregnant man,</i>

398
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,925
<i>is facing reports of alleged fraud.</i>

399
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,682
-Crazy, right?
-Gross, pregnant men…

400
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,305
He was definitely gonna scam us.

401
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,022
We should've guessed.

402
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,942
Kentaro should be coming over.

403
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,110
Let's see what he says.

404
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,938
Sorry I'm late.

405
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,483
What is this?

406
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,823
I only just saw the news on my way here.

407
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,704
Where's Eiichi? I can't get hold of him.

408
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,543
He should be on his way.

409
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:34,078
-Are you part of this, too?
-Part of what?

410
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,292
We invested in Eiichi's project.

411
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,043
We put in 300,000 yen each
because you'd be the poster boy.

412
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,336
Can you give us an explanation, Hiyama?

413
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,460
-Hiyama.
-Say something.

414
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,258
Hiyama!

415
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,891
-Come on, speak.
-Hiyama…

416
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,349
KENTARO HIYAMA
DUE IN 54 DAYS

417
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,766
<i>UNIVE wants to drop Hiyama?</i>

418
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,185
The due date's approaching.

419
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,034
<i>You're going off-topic, Hiyama.</i>

420
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,359
You never know what might happen.

421
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,418
