1
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,532
I think we need models
with a younger fan base,

2
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,650
like influencers maybe.

3
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,068
Yeah, that would be more relatable.

4
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,577
But if we're aiming for a global audience,

5
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:38,659
we should show diversity on a wider scale
instead of limiting ourselves to Japan.

6
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,554
Are you hungover?

7
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,092
You need a shave, man.

8
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,263
I did shave.

9
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,552
This isn't like you.

10
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:59,515
Last time, there were comments
about the female models being too samey.

11
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,061
Right. So I have an idea.

12
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,015
Take a look at this.

13
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,725
What is it?

14
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:13,739
When women breastfeed in public,
they cover up with a cape like this.

15
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,703
There's a sense of shame.

16
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,829
But overseas,

17
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,161
more people are saying
it's fine to do it openly.

18
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,416
But fashion and openly breastfeeding
are completely different concepts.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,590
Breastfeeding out in the open
might not fly in Japan…

20
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,632
It has nothing to do with fashion.

21
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:35,642
What do you think, Hiyama?

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,310
What? Well…

23
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,976
It is eye-catching.

24
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,271
What happened to your shirt?

25
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,186
-Just a sec.
-Huh?

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,030
Sorry, sorry!

27
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,198
What the hell?

28
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,745
What?

29
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,891
HOW BREAST MILK WORKS

30
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,306
"Let-down reflex"?

31
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,857
"Stimuli such as
the sound of a baby crying

32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,860
can lead to the secretion of oxytocin

33
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,492
and discharge of breast milk."

34
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,998
What the hell?

35
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,500
Gross.

36
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,512
EPISODE 2

37
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,013
Please take your time looking around.

38
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,717
Thank you.

39
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,354
Wow, so many people are here.

40
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,774
Congrats.

41
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,023
I worked myself to the bone
for a year for this.

42
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:13,146
I gave up my personal life,
so if it doesn't pay off, I'm screwed.

43
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,154
I hear you.

44
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,953
-Hello. My surname is Seto.
-Welcome.

45
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,121
Let me take that.

46
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,986
Take your time.

47
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:22,489
Smells great.

48
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,131
Eri?

49
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,798
Aki, you're here!

50
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,759
Is this your baby?

51
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,843
This is Waka.

52
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,430
My doppelgänger, right? It's uncanny.

53
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,637
-She's almost one year old.
-One?

54
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:52,146
I remember you used to say
you didn't want kids.

55
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,112
What?

56
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,528
You said even if you became
editor-in-chief,

57
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,240
you'd never have a kid
and go on maternity.

58
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,821
I guess I used to say that, huh?

59
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,245
But when I was approaching 40,

60
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,829
I thought it might be
my last chance to have a kid.

61
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,460
I knew I had to take the plunge
and do something new.

62
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,086
Eri?

63
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,434
-Do you have a minute?
-Oh, sorry.

64
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,800
Let's talk properly later.

65
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:33,056
Hey. Let's get drinks when this is over.

66
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,937
-What?
-I'm craving <i>shochu</i> and stingray fins.

67
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,315
You're on.

68
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:25,664
We wanted to create a system together

69
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,492
to address the causes of our fatigue.

70
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,418
VisuallyWorks is the result of that.

71
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,328
Right?

72
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,536
How great would it be
to have a platform

73
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,626
that analyzes and visualizes databases
in a clear fashion?

74
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,300
You're tired, in pain, worn out,
can't be bothered.

75
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,143
Take those negative feelings…

76
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,098
<i>So, about the article…</i>

77
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,599
-Could you finish it this week?
-What?

78
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,520
-You mean in three days?
-Yes.

79
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:55,271
I thought we had agreed on a week.

80
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,938
I'm juggling other work too.
It's too soon.

81
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,027
But you have three days to do it.

82
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,242
You told us we'd have an article out
before the launch.

83
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,704
That was before
the interviews got delayed.

84
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,963
If you can't do it,
we'll get someone else.

85
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,919
Can we make a clear decision on that?

86
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,879
Fine, I get it.

87
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:24,836
Thank you.

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,600
-Bye.
-See you.

89
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:35,694
So, you're not going ahead this time?

90
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,020
That's right.

91
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,685
I'd like an abortion as soon as possible.

92
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:41,114
When could we do it?

93
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:45,453
We'll do some checks before the procedure

94
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,870
so the earliest would be next Thursday.

95
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,080
Next Thursday…

96
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,579
Yes, let's do it.

97
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,661
-I'll book you in.
-Great.

98
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,883
This contains warnings and details
about what to bring to the clinic.

99
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,297
-Please read it thoroughly at home.
-Okay.

100
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:11,386
Please also fill this in
and bring it along

101
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,812
to the pre-examination.

102
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:15,104
"Abortion consent form"?

103
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,857
The other party needs to sign here.

104
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,435
The "other party"?

105
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,163
What if…

106
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,445
I don't know who they are?

107
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,457
If you don't know who it is…

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well, you're now ten weeks pregnant,

109
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:48,508
so it's probably someone
you were with around this period.

110
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,322
AKI

111
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:08,951
<i>…You're tired, in pain,</i>
<i>worn out, can't be bothered.</i>

112
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,030
<i>Take those negative feelings</i>
<i>and share them with us…</i>

113
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,116
Ms. Seto?

114
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,658
Ms. Aki Seto?

115
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,039
Ms. Aki Seto?

116
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,884
-Please come into the consultation room.
-Yes.

117
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,469
-Apologies.
-Thanks for waiting.

118
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,903
If your periods are really that tough,

119
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,943
maybe you could try going on the pill.

120
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,454
Okay.

121
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,782
I get such bad cramps.

122
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,367
Sometimes I can't even stand up.

123
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,832
It stops me from working.

124
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,206
I'll prescribe you a month's worth.
Give it a try.

125
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,041
Get in touch immediately
if it doesn't feel right.

126
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:08,087
There are loads of types,
so you can try out different ones.

127
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,012
It'll make your periods much easier.

128
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,337
It will?

129
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,392
Also, not to rush into things,

130
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,391
but surgery is another option.

131
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,725
Uterine fibroids can still grow back
even if they're removed,

132
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,310
so it's not a sure bet.

133
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,395
I'm not sure about surgery…

134
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,822
I'd have to be hospitalized
for about a week, right?

135
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,283
-Yes.
-I can't take that much time off work.

136
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,405
But if it gets worse,
it could make you infertile.

137
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,160
So if you think
you might want children later…

138
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,293
Could I have the pills for now?

139
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,549
I don't even have time to go to hospital

140
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,628
so having a kid just isn't realistic.

141
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,970
I don't have a partner, anyway.

142
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,513
Okay. Well, here's the prescription.

143
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,260
Right.

144
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,938
KENTARO HIYAMA: YOU FREE TONIGHT?

145
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,148
Not a chance.

146
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,618
ABORTION CONSENT FORM

147
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,210
AKI: CAN'T. I'M BUSY.

148
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,108
DEALING WITH MORNING SICKNESS

149
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,115
PRE-MAMA LAND HOMEPAGE

150
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,542
What's with this lame design?

151
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,251
"The cause of morning sickness is unclear.

152
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,625
No specific medical cure exists."

153
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,295
Seriously?

154
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,219
This is a joke.

155
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,430
<i>Hello, Itofuji here.</i>

156
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,971
<i>Today we'll be doing</i>

157
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,466
<i>Welcome to</i> Mama Q!

158
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,557
<i>We received</i>

159
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,274
<i>Here's one of them.</i>

00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,824
<i>"Does pregnancy make nipples darker?"</i>

161
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,029
Darker nipples?

162
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,857
<i>People say so, don't they? Is it true?</i>

163
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,145
<i>Well,</i>

164

<i>causing body hair to thicken…</i>

166
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,541
Hiyama.

167
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,620
Are you free today?

168
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,920
-Yes.
-Right.

169
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,958
See you later then.

170
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,303
Yes.

171
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,259
What's going on lately? You're slipping.

172
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,977
I've taken a bit of a hit
to my health. I'm sorry.

173
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,980
Maintaining your health
is part of your job too.

174
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,698
Find a wife and have her look after you.

175
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,776
Yes.

176
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,615
Without a wife at home
looking after things,

177
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,001
a man can't go out
and do proper work, can he?

178
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:27,999
Right, boss.

179
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,130
Look, here's what I want to say.

180
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,466
I put you in charge, not Tanabe.

181
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,852
Don't embarrass me.

182
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,809
I'm heading out.

183
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,027
Huh? What is it?

184
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,074
Are you drunk?

185
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:02,817
I'm not drunk.

186
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,331
You can't just turn up whenever!

187
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,869
I've got a deadline today, you know.

188
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,629
I'm not your girlfriend, Kentaro.

189
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,130
I feel awful.

190
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:18,917
You okay?

191
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:22,932
You feel ill?

192
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,811
I might have something
to settle your stomach…

193
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,979
I'm pregnant.

194
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,136
What? Who's pregnant?

195
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,476
<i>I'm</i> pregnant!

196
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,105
Me!

197
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,235
What?

198
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,371
What do you mean?

199
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,907
You mean, a cisgender male pregnancy?

200
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,212
Yep.

201
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,881
I thought I'd let you know.

202
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,383
Hold on.

203
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,553
Is it my kid? You see other girls, surely.

204
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,345
Based on the number of weeks,
I'm sure it's yours.

205
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,365
What should we do?

206
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,621
I'm not keeping it.

207
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:33,461
Oh, right.

208
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:37,747
Of course.

209
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,759
Write your name here.

210
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,478
"Abortion…"

211
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,823
Once this is filled in,
they book the procedure--

212
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,489
Oh, boy. Are you okay?

213
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,570
-Wait, oh!
-Ouch!

214
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,329
Take this.

215
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,452
Hold on. Stay there.

216
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,326
Let's get a towel…

217
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,167
You need a drink? Water?

218
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,165
Yeah, water…

219
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,546
Water. Don't you want it hot?

220
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,224
-Hot.
-Hot water, right.

221
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,895
-Any more?
-Uh…

222
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,821
-Isn't that crazy?
-Shh!

223
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,820
-Quiet!
-See you.

224
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,571
-Come here.
-Oh!

225
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,740
Don't tell anyone!

226
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,953
So some men really can get pregnant!

227
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,044
Keep it down.

228
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,075
Please, you can't tell anyone.

229
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,964
You always hear about it
on the news, right?

230
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,421
-Yeah, but I've never met one.
-Right.

231
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,633
Even if a man's belly sticks out,
I'd never think he could be pregnant.

232
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,554
Right.

233
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,472
Most of them have abortions, too.

234
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,591
-They do?
-Yeah.

235
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,224
When he told me he was pregnant,

236
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,558
I unintentionally asked
if it's really mine.

237
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,234
It's usually the man asking that.

238
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,360
But you know,

239
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,065
it's a pretty great time to be alive

240
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,112
where cisgender men can give birth.

241
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,316
-What?
-No?

242
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,831
I mean, being pregnant is tough.

243
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,500
Nausea and headaches for months.

244
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,540
People nagging you constantly
until it's born,

245
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,125
like, "Don't eat this,
move that, go for a walk."

246
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,761
You can't drink or eat raw stuff.

247
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,379
And to top it all off,

248
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,005
the hellish pain of labor
is waiting for you at the end.

249
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,062
If a man did all that for me,

250
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,269
I'd be over the moon.

251
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,267
Hey.

252
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,938
I know you're not interested in marriage.
But what about kids?

253
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,198
Don't you want him to have the baby?

254
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,408
What? I've never thought about it.

255
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,290
Okay, well.

256
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,254
Maybe think about it before deciding.

257
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,755
Because no matter who gives birth,

258
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,512
pregnancy is a freaking miracle.

259
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,711
Sorry I'm late.

260
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,258
No, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I was in such a state.

261
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,140
It's not your fault. You're pregnant.

262
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,427
Hello, here's some water.

263
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,098
-I'll bring a menu.
-Thanks.

264
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,146
I'll be right back.

265
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,411
All I can eat right now is sweet stuff.

266
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,870
I've lost two kilos this week.

267
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,077
Oh, yeah.

268
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,794
I got a new copy.

269
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,125
Go ahead.

270
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,343
ABORTION CONSENT FORM

271
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:54,263
Here.

272
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,521
But, you know…

273
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:12,607
think about this situation.

274
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,695
It's really a blessing.

275
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,530
For people who want kids, sure.

276
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,445
No, I mean for a man to get pregnant.

277
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,674
If you were willing to give birth,

278
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:30,999
I could have a kid
without having to give birth myself.

279
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:37,683
Plus, you're an ad man.

280
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,350
Being a pregnant man
could work to your advantage

281
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,808
and lead to new job opportunities.

282
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,484
When I think of it like that,

283
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,106
I start thinking that perhaps

284
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,820
this is actually a huge stroke of luck.

285
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:56,993
Look, Aki.

286
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,914
I'm actually pregnant.

287
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,790
-I get it.
-You don't.

288
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,959
I feel queasy all day.
My boss is watching me.

289
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,209
It's already destroying my life.
Don't joke with me.

290
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,844
Sorry.

291
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,683
I agree that we won't have the baby.

292
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,639
It's not just about agreeing.

293
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,009
Don't make it sound so easy.

294
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,604
I have to harm my body for an abortion.

295
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,058
Sure, but still.

296
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,284
You sound just like one of those guys.

297
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,243
Men who get girls pregnant
then say, "Oh, I understand,"

298
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,834
and sign the form
like it's none of their business.

299
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:50,921
But I'm the one who bears the risk
whether it's childbirth or an abortion.

300
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,878
Hurry up and sign it.

301
00:20:59,091 --> 00:20:59,931
Yes.

302
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,360
Stamp it, too.

303
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,768
-Hello there.
-Hey.

304
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,479
We've got a UNIVE meeting at 3:00 p.m.

305
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,653
Is room A3 free?

306
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,901
The monitors are hard to see
in the usual room.

307
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,151
The meeting's already started.

308
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,214
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

309
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,633
See you.

310
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,921
Sorry, I forgot to check
for any schedule changes.

311
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,676
It's fine. You're not feeling well.

312
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,801
-It was short notice.
-I'm sorry.

313
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,677
Given the circumstances,

314
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,345
I'd like to hand this project over

315
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,234
to Tanabe to manage.

316
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:38,151
What? But this plan was my idea.

317
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,441
The plan is a team effort.

318
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,906
You shouldn't have to
keep shouldering it all for the company.

319
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,618
-No, but--
-Hiyama.

320
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,698
Accept help when you're having trouble.

321
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,196
I'll work to the best of my abilities.

322
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,156
Wait, how do we tell the client?

323
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,996
This is a joint decision.

324
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,921
You turn up at the office poorly dressed.

325
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:02,462
Your mind's elsewhere,
you can't communicate properly.

326
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:06,763
I mean, where were you today?

327
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,933
We couldn't get a hold of you.

328
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,016
Seeing you like this lately,

329
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,349
we decided it would be best for the team.

330
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,312
Alright?

331
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,266
-Take care of it, Tanabe.
-Yes.

332
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,817
Right. Please tidy things up here.

333
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,279
Then read the minutes

334
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,573
and prepare the necessary materials
for next time.

335
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,286
Koga, you can leave.

336
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:52,347
KENTARO HIYAMA
DUE IN 206 DAYS

337
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,766
<i>Dropped down the ranks, huh?</i>

338
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,774
<i>I'd like to do the procedure ASAP.</i>

339
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,726
Are you pregnant?

340
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,105
-Boobs.
-I know!

341
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,491
<i>It's not as easy as you think.</i>

342
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,359
<i>What do you think, Mr. Hiyama?</i>

343
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,424
