1
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,082
My beard's grown so thick.

2
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,812
EPISODE 3

3
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:05,322
BABY ON BOARD

4
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,412
Please have a seat.

5
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:15,621
Thank you very much.

6
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,580
No worries.

7
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,549
Hiyama, I think Tanabe wants you
to sort the thing in his email

8
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,058
before this afternoon.

9
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,727
-Where is everyone?
-In the Seifudo meeting.

10
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,770
I see.

11
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,651
Wait, he wants all this done this morning?

12
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,235
Yeah, I think so.

13
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,452
What's that?

14
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:57,526
Freebie samples.

15
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,407
You told me to order them
in the meeting last week.

16
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,285
We're moving them
to an empty meeting room to clear space.

17
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,793
Give us a hand, Hiyama.

18
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,285
I have things to do now.

19
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,917
So do we. Right?

20
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:18,854
-Come on, swiftly does it.
-Alright.

21
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,144
These are heavy.

22
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,937
Well, it's soap.

23
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,731
You're the one
who wanted to use soap, Hiyama.

24
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,987
Think about
how we have to bag them all up, too.

25
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,410
You can say that again.

26
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,616
They're actually pretty cute.

27
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,833
They are!

28
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,051
Great job as always, Tanabe.

29
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,635
-It was all your doing, Osugi.
-Not at all.

30
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,851
I'll get the green light from sales
and show it to the client today.

31
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,562
-Thanks.
-Sure.

32
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,942
Sort the agenda and send it over.

33
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,151
Yes, will do.

34
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,318
What are you doing, Hiyama?

35
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,989
Are you okay? You're sweating loads.

36
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:19,663
Yeah.

37
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,991
You finished
the stuff I emailed you, right?

38
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,084
-I will.
-You still haven't done it?

39
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,753
Please do it soon.

40
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,498
I'll get in trouble if it's late.

41
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,502
I can handle this. You go ahead.

42
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,884
-Thanks.
-Alright.

43
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,220
Yes. I'd like to do the procedure ASAP.

44
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,139
The consent form is ready.

45
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,322
Next week? Yes, let's book that.

46
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:58,702
Yes.

47
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,072
One week's paid leave?

48
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:05,076
I'm fully aware
that it's an unreasonable request

49
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,211
at such a critical time as this, but…

50
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,629
my mother is undergoing surgery,
and since she raised me single-handedly--

51
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,669
Sure, why not?

52
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,673
Sorry?

53
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,674
You're not handling anything crucial now.

54
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,512
Someone else can cover for you.

55
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:26,056
BOOKED THE ABORTION.
BEING ADMITTED NEXT THURSDAY.

56
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,613
OKAY. SHOULD I COME WITH YOU?

57
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,830
Sorry to keep you waiting, Seto.

58
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,199
No worries.
Here are the materials I borrowed.

59
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,498
-Thank you.
-Thanks for bringing them.

60
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,254
One more thing.

61
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:58,091
It's about the plan for the online exhibit
I've been proposing.

62
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,629
I gathered some ideas together.

63
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,847
About that… I'm really sorry.

64
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:05,965
I don't think we can do it.

65
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:07,886
What?

66
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,774
You know Nishi, the writer?

67
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,688
We've just been working
on a similar project

68
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,190
and they overlap.

69
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,322
But wait, the other day,

70
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:21,074
you said there was interest
because I had a good angle.

71
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,164
It's just bad timing.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,540
If you're interested,
you could help with Nishi's idea.

73
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:32,789
No, I wanted to see my own plan through.

74
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,888
Sorry about that.

75
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,930
-I wanna play!
-Yes, at home.

76
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,398
-I wanna play more!
-At home. Let's go.

77
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,476
Let's play at home.

78
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,281
I wanna keep playing!

79
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:24,926
MAKE SURE YOU'RE THERE, BIG SIS! -NARUMI

80
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,231
This is the consent form.

81
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,979
Please read and sign it
and take it away with you.

82
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,613
That's what happens post-surgery
until you're discharged.

83
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,240
We're past 12 weeks for this abortion,

84
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,608
so it'll be treated as a stillbirth.

85
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,025
Please report
the stillbirth to the city office

86
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,115
and get permission for the fetus's burial.

87
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,660
-Burial?
-Yes.

88
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,709
Excuse me.

89
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,215
-Yes?
-Um…

90
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,972
are you pregnant, by chance?

91
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,267
What?

92
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,650
Oh…

93
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,936
Yep.

94
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,355
-My body hair's grown like crazy.
-Yeah.

95
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,615
My beard keeps growing
no matter how much I shave it,

96
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,659
so I just gave up.

97
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,042
You gave up?

98
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,829
Rather than body hair, what gets me is

99
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,751
-the boobs.
-I know!

100
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,463
Oozing from your nipples, right?

101
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,463
-Yes, and--
-Two beers for table two.

102
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,165
Coming right up.

103
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,715
-Sorry.
-No…

104
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:51,512
There's a strange sense of camaraderie
being in the same week of pregnancy.

105
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,426
Sure is.

106
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,064
By the way,

107
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,020
have you bought maternity wear yet?

108
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,348
No.

109
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,266
I looked up some plus-size makers

110
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,935
and picked out some stuff.

111
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,404
Like this for instance.

112
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,074
Looks so cool.

113
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,282
-Well, cute, maybe--
-Listen.

114
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,325
Miyaji, I…

115
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,407
-Actually, I…
-Go on.

116
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,842
I'm not keeping it.

117
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,246
What?

118
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,258
I'm not even married.

119
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,545
It's affecting my work too much.

120
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,469
How do I say this?

121
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,767
Right, I understand.

122
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,644
Sorry, I should've said so earlier.

123
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,436
No, I got ahead of myself.

124
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,651
Let me apologize.

125
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,771
No, I'm sorry.

126
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,112
Here's your bowl of <i>edamame </i>beans.

127
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,904
A whisky highball and one plum wine.

128
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,857
Whisky highball and plum wine, right?

129
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,328
-Yes please.
-I'll bring them to you.

130
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,117
Whisky highball and plum wine, please.

131
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,045
I do understand, though.

132
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,473
I was sure
I'd get rid of it at first, too.

133
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,974
What? Really?

134
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,306
Yeah, I mean…

135
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,401
To be honest, the idea of men
having babies grossed me out.

136
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,318
I thought, "Why me?"
I couldn't believe it.

137
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,109
-Right?
-Yeah.

138
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,203
But gradually I started to think
it might be better to keep it.

139
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,751
My wife got pregnant
straight away the first time,

140
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:44,126
but we had such a hard time
second time round.

141
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,628
I'm sorry, Hiyama.

142
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,006
How can you get drunk
on non-alcoholic beer?

143
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,393
I dunno, it's the atmosphere.

144
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,721
-Careful.
-Yeah.

145
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,346
There! That's my house.

146
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,564
-Miyaji!
-I'm back.

147
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,150
Oh, dear. What happened?

148
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,820
-This is Noriko.
-Okay.

149
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,112
-This is Hiyama.
-Hello, I'm Hiyama.

150
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,829
I'm so sorry about this.

151
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,660
-Thanks for bringing him back.
-Of course.

152
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,253
He didn't drink a drop of alcohol,
so no need to worry.

153
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,416
I reckon he was over the moon.

154
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,764
Finding another expecting father.

155
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,800
I see.

156
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:38,802
He's not smiled like this for ages.

157
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,562
Really?

158
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,890
Oh, thanks for the tea.

159
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,942
He shut himself away in shock for a while

160
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,191
after he found out about the pregnancy.

161
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,686
He's back working in the shop now,

162
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,819
but he seems stressed out.

163
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,041
Whoa.

164
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,214
We fight all the time.

165
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,670
It's triple the trouble
of when I was pregnant.

166
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,011
Hey, when's your baby coming?

167
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,965
What?

168
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,051
Let's see…

169
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,314
Dad's baby is being born in September.

170
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,769
It's meant to be September 8.

171
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,479
It is?

172
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,522
Hey, Dad!

173
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,725
Oh, Takuya.

174
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,975
September, right?

175
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,150
Dad! Get up!

176
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,605
-Have you done your homework?
-Get up!

177
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,793
Phew! Halfway there.

178
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,039
That's right.

179
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,708
We should outsource work like this.
Anyone can do it.

180
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,961
Anyone can do it, yes.
Surely that's why we're doing it.

181
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:52,884
Right?

182
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:56,876
Thanks.

183
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,142
Sorry, Matsuno.

184
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,679
We've got a UNIVE meeting at 2:00 p.m.

185
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,933
so we need to leave soon.

186
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,434
-Oh?
-Excuse us.

187
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,267
-Alright, see you later.
-Sure.

188
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,021
Wait, hold on.

189
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,944
Tanabe's handling it now, isn't he?

190
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,694
What are you two going to do there?

191
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,356
Even underlings have work to do.

192
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,526
"Underlings"?

193
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,949
Hiyama dropped a few ranks, huh?

194
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,697
I meant me. I'm the underling!

195
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,696
I know, I know.

196
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,377
The client's marketing folk
are joining today too, right?

197
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:37,133
Oh, shoot! We don't have enough handouts.

198
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,676
Hey, Hiyama?

199
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,300
Can you quickly go print some?

200
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,469
-I'll go ahead.
-But…

201
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,805
Look, us two can't be late.

202
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,518
Fine.

203
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,109
Thanks!

204
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,284
I reckon we could even make
the backgrounds the same.

205
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,945
By also using models
of various sexual identities

206
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:09,406
and models with prosthetic limbs,

207
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,917
as well as famous actresses

208
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,418
and influencers
who champion self-expression,

209
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,171
we aim to show
a diverse range of professions

210
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,263
and these five types of models--

211
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,469
Can I say something?

212
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,063
It's become a little… ordinary.

213
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,469
Sorry?

214
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,016
Last time, we said we wanted a freshness

215
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,980
that suited the current era.

216
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,401
But this feels less alive.

217
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,269
Of course, we agree.

218
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,943
Next up is our proposal with that in mind.

219
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,276
-Go on, Hiyama.
-Okay.

220
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,202
This version has pregnant women
who don't abandon their careers.

221
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,035
Keeping a work-life balance--

222
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,290
Hasn't this been done?

223
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,171
What do you think?

224
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,418
Seen it all before.

225
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,712
Our apologies.

226
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,796
From our standpoint,

227
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:03,381
we're making doubly sure

228
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,297
not to damage your brand image.

229
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,886
I'll say this again.

230
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,970
We're rebranding.

231
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,557
Impact is key.

232
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,139
Frankly, I'm concerned this material

233
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,688
will raise doubts within our company
about working with you.

234
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,195
What do you think, Hiyama?

235
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:29,986
When you first proposed this plan,

236
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,787
we sensed a great possibility in you.

237
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,173
You've not said a word yet.

238
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,631
<i>Mr. Hiyama, you're pregnant.</i>

239
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,513
<i>Like, a  male pregnancy?</i>

240
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:45,842
<i>It's positive?</i>

241
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,263
<i>You can't communicate properly.</i>

242
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,425
<i>Hey, when's your baby coming?</i>

243
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,474
Do it soon.

244
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,307
You're not handling anything crucial.

245
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,602
Dropped a few ranks, huh?

246
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,765
<i>What happened to your shirt?</i>

247
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,613
<i>Don't waste your life</i>
<i>worrying about what other people think.</i>

248
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,769
<i>Get rid of it…</i>

249
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,397
Being a pregnant man
could work to your advantage

250
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,824
and lead to new job opportunities.

251
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,370
Let's stick with pregnancy.

252
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,905
But what about male pregnancy?

253
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,424
It's become a hot topic lately,

254
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,712
but it hasn't yet appeared
in any advertising.

255
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:26,756
Wouldn't it get people talking
if we included a pregnant male model?

256
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,143
It's interesting, but is it realistic?

257
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,060
It's not possible.
No one would do it anyway.

258
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,306
I'll do it.

259
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,687
What?

260
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,895
You? What do you mean?

261
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,359
Actually, I…

262
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,776
I'm pregnant.

263
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,669
I'm currently in my 11th week.

264
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,245
I've been going to a clinic, too.

265
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,794
Seriously?

266
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,047
Here's an ultrasound.

267
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,431
What the…

268
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,433
Seriously? You're pregnant, Hiyama?

269
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,522
I'm battling with morning sickness
and my body is changing.

270
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,191
As a pregnant man,
I'm part of an underrepresented group.

271
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,359
If I were a model
and talked about the concept of this ad,

272
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,400
it could create a big movement.

273
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,742
It's certainly unique.

274
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,572
Stunning. No one can copy it either.

275
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,238
Right, we'll follow Hiyama's idea,

276
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,707
redo the plan and resubmit it
to you straight away.

277
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,789
Yes, please do.

278
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,970
What a surprise! Never expected it of you.

279
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,683
Look, what I said just now
about giving birth…

280
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,387
I'm not sure I can actually do it.

281
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,345
You'll be fine.

282
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,016
-See you.
-Bye.

283
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:06,605
Women get pregnant
and give birth all the time.

284
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,446
You'll nail it.

285
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,777
-Tanabe, hold on.
-Okay.

286
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,785
What? So…

287
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,962
you're going to keep it?

288
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,421
Yeah, that's right.

289
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:31,180
But don't worry. I'll raise it alone.

290
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,972
I won't trouble you, Aki.

291
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,269
In that case…

292
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,846
I'd like to raise the kid, too.

293
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:43,806
What?

294
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,443
Well, I've always been focused on work,

295
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:51,204
but lately I'm wondering
if it's about time.

296
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,318
Wait, you mean

297
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,950
we'll get married?

298
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:00,331
Let's think about that later.

299
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,912
-But--
-Thanks for waiting.

300
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,958
Here are two appetizers.

301
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,130
A fresh fish carpaccio

302
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:11,262
and a salad with cured ham
and cottage cheese.

303
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:12,587
Thanks.

304
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,227
-For now, let's have a toast.
-Yeah.

305
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,518
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

306
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,146
Wish I could have a drink.

307
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,074
Yeah.

308
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,282
Let's try this.

309
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,322
-Wait.
-Huh?

310
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,525
Is cured ham okay when pregnant?

311
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,775
It's fine, surely.

312
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,236
-No, wait.
-Huh?

313
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:44,406
"Foods to avoid while pregnant…"

314
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,785
Yeah, you can't eat cured ham.

315
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,086
-No way.
-Yeah.

316
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,627
Also, unprocessed cheese

317
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,255
and raw fish.

318
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,392
-So I can't have any of this.
-Right.

319
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,310
-That's a shame.
-Man…

320
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,480
Look after your body from now on, okay?

321
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,019
Do moderate exercise.

322
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,859
Have a balanced diet.

323
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,485
Got it.

324
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,951
No more instant noodles.

325
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,214
I know.

326
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,593
-I'll contact you soon.
-Okay.

327
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,505
See you.

328
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,354
<i>Sorry about the other day.</i>

329
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:47,135
I was pretty tipsy
and got ahead of myself.

330
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,347
<i>No, it's alright.</i>

331
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,648
<i>Actually, Miyaji…</i>

332
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,032
Yeah?

333
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,859
I'm thinking of keeping the baby.

334
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,490
<i>What, really?</i>

335
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,453
Yes.

336
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,414
Man, that makes me so happy!

337
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,036
I'm so glad.

338
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,708
<i>It's so reassuring</i>
<i>to be going through the same thing.</i>

339
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,670
Thanks for saying that.

340
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:17,715
<i>Thanks for telling me such great news.</i>

341
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,643
<i>How about a drink sometime?</i>

342
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:23,555
Yeah, let's do that. A soft drink, okay?

343
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:25,219
<i>Alright. See you soon.</i>

344
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,096
Okay, see you.

345
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,159
Hello, Ma? It's me.

346
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,996
When did you find out?

347
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,998
<i>Around two weeks ago.</i>

348
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,248
<i>I said nothing</i>
<i>because I'd planned to get rid of it.</i>

349
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,917
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

350
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,263
What?

351
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,838
Being pregnant and giving birth

352
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,677
is not as easy as you think.

353
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,183
Are you telling me not to do it?

354
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,267
Well, I mean…

355
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,269
The birth is just the start.

356
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,315
<i>If you're raising a kid,</i>

357
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,740
<i>you won't be able</i>
<i>to work like you do now.</i>

358
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,149
Listen, it'll be fine.

359
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,909
Loads of people nowadays give birth

360
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,990
then go back and work their butts off.

361
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,285
But they're <i>women.</i>

362
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,619
It doesn't matter
if you're a man or a woman!

363
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,955
It absolutely does matter!

364
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,210
Ma, I told my company
and things are already in place.

365
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:40,384
<i>You can still pull out of that stuff.</i>

366
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,336
-Sorry, Ma.
<i>-Huh?</i>

367
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,264
I've made my decision.

368
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,474
<i>Hello? Hello--</i>

369
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,484
Even my own son…

370
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,565
Hiyama is here.

371
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,494
Please go ahead.

372
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,331
-Hello there.
-Go ahead, Hiyama.

373
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,630
Take his gown, please.

374
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,814
Excuse me.

375
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,687
Let's go.

376
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,237
Right, let's do some tests.

377
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,864
Okay, we'll do the tests.

378
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,036
Let us see your belly a bit more.

379
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,699
Yeah, that's it.

380
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,497
Yeah, good.

381
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:59,169
Turn your body sideways
to show your belly in profile.

382
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,000
Yep, that's it.

383
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,625
Once more with your hands down.

384
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,506
Good facial expression, too.

385
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,803
Yeah.

386
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,310
Okay, keep going.

387
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,932
Drop your hand a bit.

388
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,137
That's right. Good.

389
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,541
Hey, check this out.

390
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,445
Look how big his belly is!

391
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,287
Whoa, for real?

392
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,832
Wait, wait.

393
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,086
I've never seen it before.

394
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,375
I saw it on TV before!

395
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,349
KENTARO HIYAMA

396
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,306
<i>Hiyama, you're totally trending!</i>

397
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,766
<i>Let's make a space where we can mingle.</i>

398
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,317
I'm the mother of the kid in his belly.

399
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,361
Some things can't be overcome
by applying logic alone!

00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,460
