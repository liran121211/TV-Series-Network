00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,603
<i>I had no idea.</i>

2
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,109
<i>I didn't know being pregnant</i>
<i>would be so tough.</i>

3
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,615
<i>So difficult.</i>

4
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,252
<i>As a man, I'd never even imagined</i>

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,210
<i>how it would change the rhythm of my life.</i>

6
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:44,587
Congratulations!

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,720
<i>Unexpected things happen in life.</i>

8
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,595
<i>When you're faced with that moment,</i>

9
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,848
<i>what would you do?</i>

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:05,015
EPISODE 1

11
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,085
<i>The best life hacks?</i>

12
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,014
<i>Prediction and preparation.</i>

13
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,755
Here's your change and receipt.

14
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,426
Good morning, Mr. Hiyama.

15
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,015
-Morning. Drip coffee, please.
-Sure.

16
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,351
<i>Take women, for example.</i>

17
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,475
One drip coffee!

18
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,981
Hey, I had fun the other day.

19
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:49,148
-You'll ask me out again, right?
-Of course.

20
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,074
<i>As long as…</i>

21
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:50,991
Let me pay.

22
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,199
Yes, sorry.

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,029
<i>…you don't drop the ball,</i>
<i>things will go as you intend.</i>

24
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,236
<i>Same with work.</i>

25
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,958
<i>It all comes down</i>
<i>to prediction and preparation.</i>

26
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,289
-Morning!
-Morning.

27
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,959
<i>There is nothing difficult about it.</i>

28
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,418
She looks fantastic.

29
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,665
We really found a great girl for it.

30
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,177
Yeah, you said it.

31
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,635
It's surprisingly hard
to find an athlete like her.

32
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,848
We could even make a photo book.

33
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,221
-True!
-Good idea.

34
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,437
We'll take this to the client
for final checks.

35
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,439
-Perfect, Hiyama.
-Thank you.

36
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,939
-This will get attention.
-Right.

37
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,324
I mean, the girl's got big tits
and a great body.

38
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,162
-Hiyama, you filthy sod.
-That wasn't my intention.

39
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,818
You'll get in trouble
talking like that nowadays, Tanabe.

40
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,367
I'd never say it in public.

41
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,330
Frankly, what's important is results.

42
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,621
-That's right.
-I guess.

43
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:45,374
Men are attracted
to female athletes' bodies.

44
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,666
It's just a fact.

45
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,592
-Right?
-That's just you.

46
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:49,958
Speak for yourself.

47
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,964
Yeah, don't speak for all of us.

48
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,546
Give me a break, boss.

49
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,431
Tanabe, look at Miss Koga.
She's not laughing at all.

50
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,505
Oh, poor Koga.

51
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,814
Don't report me, okay?

52
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,219
I may have to disappoint you.

53
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,307
-Yikes!
-Report him.

54
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,312
Be honest. You'd be drawn to an ad
with a hot naked guy, too.

55
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,225
You're just digging yourself deeper.

56
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,024
-See, this is what I mean.
-Report him.

57
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,647
Alright, let's go ahead with this one.

58
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,065
-Okay.
-Thanks.

59
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,953
Thanks, everyone.

60
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,910
All right.

61
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,072
-Hiyama.
-Yes?

62
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:20,988
-Tanabe.
-Yes?

63
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:22,115
Sawabe, you too.

64
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,290
You free for dinner tonight?

65
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,495
I'd like to discuss plans
for something else.

66
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,537
Is it about UNIVE?

67
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,547
Yes, and the in-house contest as well.

68
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,593
Try to make some time tonight.

69
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,013
-Understood.
-Right, thanks.

70
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,933
Thank you.

71
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:47,726
NATSUMI: SORRY FOR TALKING TO YOU
THIS MORNING!

72
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,811
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT
WHETHER YOU'RE THINKING OF ME.

73
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,536
AKI: THANKS

74
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:17,052
IT'LL BE LATE, BUT CAN I SEE YOU TONIGHT?

75
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,141
The client is chomping at the bit
for new branding.

76
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,600
Whether we win this deal or not
will make a difference.

77
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:25,521
You're right.

78
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,428
We can't lose,
for the sake of the whole company.

79
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,608
Exactly.
UNIVE is Japan's leading apparel company.

80
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,526
We need to power through,
whatever it takes.

81
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,202
Boss, excuse me.

82
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,949
I'm actually on child duty today
so I need to leave soon.

83
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,122
Oh, you do?

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,160
Forgive me. I appreciate the invitation.

85
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,794
What the hell?
The boss is giving us an opportunity.

86
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,791
It's fine.

87
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,882
Mr. Osugi isn't a man
who sweats over small matters.

88
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,799
Yeah, get home to your kid.

89
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,216
Yes, and please invite me again.
Thank you for tonight.

90
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,679
-See you.
-Good night.

91
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,468
-Night.
-Good night.

92
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,973
-Take care.
-Thanks, good night.

93
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,144
What a great dad!

94
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,642
Can you believe that?

95
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:13,226
Don't say that. Raising kids is tough.

96
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,400
Men shouldn't be
responsible for childcare.

97
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,823
It's just a matter of
controlling the household, right?

98
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,822
A front-line fighter
needs to get in the ring!

99
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,776
Come on, everyone's different.

100
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,948
Boss, let's get back to business.

101
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,287
Right, that's what's important.

102
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,210
Naturally, one of you two

103
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,962
will take the lead
at our next presentation meeting.

104
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,757
Make it work. I'm counting on you.

105
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,223
-Leave it to us.
-Yes.

106
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,932
-Thanks for tonight.
-Good night.

107
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,981
You're a crafty one, Hiyama.

108
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,152
What do you mean?

109
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,610
You play it cool,
but you're totally aiming for the top.

110
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,822
You know exactly how to handle our boss.

111
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,446
It's only natural.

112
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,043
I won't let you win this time.

113
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,123
It's time for you to step aside.

114
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,592
Okay, good night.

115
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:33,392
AKI: YEAH, FINE.
HIYAMA: I'M ON MY WAY NOW.

116
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,864
MOM: IT'S NEARLY YOUR BIRTHDAY!
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

117
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,653
STAY HEALTHY.
ALL I WANT NOW IS A GRANDKID!

118
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,780
Please, have a seat.

119
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,409
That's very kind, thanks.

120
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,000
Are you okay?

121
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,956
I'm fine.

122
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,841
Sorry.

123
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,223
BABY ON BOARD

124
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,520
Been a while.

125
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,523
When you show up,
you're always late.

126
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,524
Sorry. I just got off work.

127
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:22,896
Get in here.

128
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,531
Thank you kindly.

129
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,122
You're so self-centered.

130
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,952
I'm in the middle of something.

131
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,706
Look, I'm sorry.
I wanted to ask you something about work.

132
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,420
-Work?
-Yeah.

133
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,054
Alright.

134
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,848
-Here.
-Thanks.

135
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,229
NATSUMI: WHY WON'T YOU REPLY?

136
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,441
Jeez, so needy.

137
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,480
ARE YOU AWAKE?

138
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,823
Why do younger girls
need everything spelled out?

139
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:03,939
Don't they get it?

140
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,031
-What's that?
-Nothing.

141
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,623
I prefer grown-up women, after all.

142
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,451
-Like you, Aki.
-What are you on about?

143
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,115
Come on.

144
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,368
It's true.

145
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,710
We're a good match, no?

146
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,384
How?

147
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,592
You know.

148
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,007
We're good together.

149
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,721
Ah, okay.

150
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,813
We're not bad.

151
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,849
Right? Come here.

152
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,935
-We're good at kissing.
-Not just kissing.

153
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,266
Here.

154
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,728
-What are you doing?
-I win!

155
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,105
Alright.

156
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,785
Bedtime for me, too.

157
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,502
What was that
about being good together?

158
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,291
-Good together?
-Not just kissing, right?

159
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,048
Something like this.

160
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,377
Like this, right?

161
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,295
<i>Currently, around 40 cases</i>
<i>are reported annually in Japan</i>

162
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,635
<i>of cisgender male pregnancies.</i>

163
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,425
<i>At our hospital,</i>

164
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,345
<i>around one case is reported per month.</i>

165
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,274
<i>The first male pregnancy</i>

166
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,573
<i>was reported in the United States</i>
<i>around 50 years ago.</i>

ALEX POWELL: WORLD'S FIRST
REPORTED PREGNANT MAN

168
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,742
<i>His pregnancy made headlines</i>
<i>because he was not transgender.</i>

169
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,070
<i>Shortly thereafter,</i>

170
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,124
<i>across the globe,</i>
<i>reports of male pregnancy…</i>

171
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,118
I can't even imagine it.

172
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,157
What?

173
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,961
A pregnant man.

174
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,167
Creeps me out a bit, to be honest.

175
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,340
But there's no one like that around you.

176
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,260
-Have you ever met someone like that?
-Never.

177
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,643
Anyway, having kids is pretty bold.

178
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,389
Doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman,

179
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,226
it just gets in the way of work.

180
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,515
I wonder…

181
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,647
-You writing something?
-Yeah.

182
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,406
I've got two deadlines
by tomorrow morning.

183
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,330
You're such an in-demand writer.

184
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,159
I'm just convenient for them.

185
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,208
It's pointless
unless I get commissioned by name.

186
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,041
I wish the youngsters
at my work could hear you.

187
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,799
There was a guy today
who went home early to look after his kid.

188
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,761
Sounds like a good thing
to be called a "doting father,"

189
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,426
but actually it means
he can't do important work.

190
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,475
Yeah.

191
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,805
I'm not averse to having children myself,

192
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:51,395
but I couldn't do my job well
while raising a kid.

193
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,541
Are you okay?

194
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,696
Maybe I drank too much.

195
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,621
Mind if I take a nap?

196
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,957
Go ahead. I'm still writing.

197
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,383
Sorry.

198
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,467
That's the gist of my plan.

199
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,642
Thank you for listening.

200
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,184
Thank you.

201
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,690
-Good job.
-Thanks.

202
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,108
-You're up.
-Thanks.

203
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,331
Allow us to present our next proposal.

204
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,084
-Go on, Hiyama.
-Yes.

205
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,656
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello.

206
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,326
"Your own fashion."

207
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,252
My first thought about this

208
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,499
was what "your own" self means.

209
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,722
Although it previously seemed
too socially loaded,

210
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,512
this concept of "your own" self

211
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,715
is being reimagined across the globe

212
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,886
and we're entering an era
that celebrates individual diversity.

213
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,055
What's important going forward

214
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,524
is displaying our identities.

215
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,526
I see. Interesting idea.

216
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,108
But the risk of a flame war
is immeasurable.

217
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,365
Being bold is fine, but we'll be
the ones taking responsibility.

218
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,119
Yes, and to address that issue,

219
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,458
the project will set up funds
to support people of diverse identities,

220
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:32,129
at the same time demonstrating
how progressive the brand is.

221
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,460
This is a leading company,
which is exactly why

222
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,843
it should rally behind the slogan,
"Pride for All People."

223
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,971
These people are not just spectacles.

224
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,889
It's about living "your own" life.

225
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,193
There are no boundaries to that.

226
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,862
Let's go ahead with refining this one.

227
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,902
It seems like an exciting plan.

228
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,316
Thank you.

229
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,946
Does everyone have a drink?

230
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,748
Everyone ready?

231
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,501
Let's raise a toast

232
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,634
to celebrate Hiyama being selected

233
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,512
as Creative of the Year!

234
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,969
Cheers, everyone!

235
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,849
-Thank you.
-There's no stopping you!

236
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,599
I've still got a long way to go.

237
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,060
I just can't stand it.

238
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,270
He walked off with another deal today.

239
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,771
Poor Tanabe,
having to look up to Hiyama!

240
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,563
-He's a pain in the butt.
-Watch what you're saying!

241
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,903
-My little junior.
-Mayumi.

242
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,153
Don't you regret letting him go?

243
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,646
A little bit.

244
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,566
I never thought he'd be this successful.

245
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,828
You mean you didn't think I had talent?

246
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,081
That's not what I meant.

247
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:53,753
Okay, how about we get back together?

248
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,043
So calculating!

249
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,626
What will it be?

250
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,011
-Is it a yes?
-Absolutely not.

251
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:00,969
Oh?

252
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,088
Say what?

253
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,795
Could it be…

254
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,046
Is it?

255
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,637
It's a surprise cake!

256
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,685
Yeah, come on!

257
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,490
Give it up!

258
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,412
Yeah, Hiyama!

259
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,445
HAPPY BIRTHDAY HIYAMA

260
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,748
Congrats!

261
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,421
You can do it!

262
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,249
Alright, eat up.

263
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,219
Is it good?

264
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:49,892
You're not coming home again tonight?

265
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,272
Sorry, baby. It's work.

266
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,312
Look at this.

267
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,353
NATIONAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
ESSAY CONTEST

268
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,477
What's this?

269
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,105
I won an award at school
and got published in a newspaper.

270
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,480
Wow!

271
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:07,112
Make sure you find a proper job, okay?

272
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,027
Okay.

273
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,832
What a good kid.

274
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,368
Alright. Mom's gotta go.

275
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,687
-Kentaro?
-Huh?

276
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,520
-Are you listening?
-What?

277
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,574
Come on!

278
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,979
We want to go on a trip together
to celebrate.

279
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,528
A trip? Great idea.

280
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,361
-How about glamping?
-Nice.

281
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,316
Yay!

282
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,164
Would you like to join?

283
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
-Can I?
-Of course.

284
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,406
-Right?
-Yeah, come along!

285
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,495
-Really?
-Please.

286
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,959
Okay, I'll keep my schedule open.

287
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,960
It's decided.

288
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:00,955
Wow.

289
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,713
-I'm going to the bathroom.
-Sure.

290
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,915
-I've never been glamping before.
-Seriously?

291
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,966
-Leaving already, Aki?
-Yeah.

292
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,101
I need to write when I get home.

293
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,967
Stay for another drink.
There are people I want you to meet.

294
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,694
No, I'm okay.

295
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,688
Everyone's so fired up tonight.

296
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,232
It's a bit much for me.

297
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,244
You're already here. Just a bit longer.

298
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,488
I'm good, really.

299
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,284
Congrats on the award.

300
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,740
See you.

301
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,647
-Good night.
-Same to you.

302
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,665
-Hello.
<i>-Kentaro?</i>

303
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,996
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

304
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,380
Thanks, Ma.

305
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,093
<i>You're already 37 now.</i>

306
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,926
<i>I'm so happy you're in good health.</i>

307
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,135
How's work?

308
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,064
Same as before?

309
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,640
-Good night.
-Oh, night.

310
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,689
Look, Ma.

311
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,568
I'm earning a proper wage now.
You can quit driving taxis.

312
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,820
<i>I'll send any money you need.</i>

313
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,652
What are you talking about?

314
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,908
No way. I won't be a burden to my son.

315
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:57,912
Why not?

316
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,330
<i>Well, you never know what might happen.</i>

317
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,344
Anyway, you're doing so well now.

318
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,838
I don't want to hold you back.

319
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,010
What about my pride?

320
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,929
Don't waste your life
worrying about what other people think.

321
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,680
Look, I do it because I enjoy it.

322
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,677
<i>Sorry, Ma. I've still got work to do.</i>

323
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,559
You do? Okay, I'll let you go.

324
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,476
<i>Happy birthday again.</i>

325
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,478
Thanks. Good night.

326
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,647
<i>Good night.</i>

327
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,161
As you can see on the schedule,

328
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,872
we need to hurry and choose models

329
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,872
based on the key visuals
we showed UNIVE the other day.

330
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:46,125
Let me discuss the ideas
and backgrounds for the models later.

331
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,594
This is sensitive material,
so let's proceed carefully.

332
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:50,917
Okay.

333
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,222
Next, uh…

334
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,310
The event…

335
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,024
-Hiyama?
-Are you okay?

336
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,980
-Our campaign…
-How about some water?

337
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,896
Are you alright?

338
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:08,559
Hiyama?

339
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,517
-Sorry.
-You're sweating like mad.

340
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,067
-I'm sorry.
-Hiyama?

341
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,031
Excuse me.

342
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:14,991
Hiyama?

343
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,541
What's going on?

344
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,175
Hiyama?

345
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,635
Mr. Hiyama, right?

346
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,386
We need to examine you further.

347
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:49,056
Could you read this and fill in the form?

348
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,476
I just filled in a medical sheet.

349
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:56,565
Yes, but we need you
to provide this separately.

350
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,953
-Separately?
-Yes.

351
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,196
Thanks for understanding.

352
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,553
This is quite far.

353
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,337
-We're almost there.
-Okay.

354
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,726
Please go in.

355
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,516
Thanks.

356
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,900
It's the room on the far right.

357
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,661
Here we go.

358
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,580
I'll cover your belly, too.

359
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,786
Um, so…

360
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,495
Please wait until the doctor comes.

361
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,375
He's ready, Doctor.

362
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,183
Huh?

363
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,597
Let me take a look at your stomach.

364
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,233
This will feel a little cool.

365
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,203
This thing checks for cancer, right?

366
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,039
Wait. Am I…

367
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,093
Yes. No doubt about it.

368
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,343
-What?
-Nine or ten weeks.

369
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:44,851
"Nine"?

370
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,928
Mr. Hiyama, please take a look.

371
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,602
It's actually almost two centimeters big.

372
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,189
This is the baby.

373
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,114
Baby?

374
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,607
What?

375
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,405
Please stay calm and listen.

376
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,239
Mr. Hiyama, you are pregnant.

377
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,504
Pregnant?

378
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,620
Me?

379
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,166
I get it. When men say "pregnant,"
it usually means someone else.

380
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,381
-What?
-Take your time to process it.

381
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:22,472
Hold on. No way. Me, pregnant?

382
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,549
-Mr. Hiyama, let me explain some details.
-"Pregnant"?

383
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,095
No, there's no need.

384
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,809
It's some kind of mistake.

385
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,719
-Mr. Hiyama.
-It's fine. Thank you.

386
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,427
-Mr. Hiyama!
-Excuse me.

387
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,482
PHARMACY

388
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,194
-No way!
-I know, right?

389
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,565
Yeah, it's wild.

390
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,275
-Hey…
-What?

391
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,699
Wait, isn't that…

392
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,531
Why does he have that?

393
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,366
-That's crazy.
-Don't stare!

394
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,963
FASTCHECK PREGNANCY TEST

395
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,672
Positive?

396
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,734
You're kidding me!

397
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,111
RESULT

398
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,034
-Yes?
<i>-Hiyama, you finally picked up.</i>

399
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,032
<i>I told you to call</i>
<i>as soon as you left the hospital.</i>

400
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,490
I'm sorry.

401
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,407
<i>Now that UNIVE has accepted the plan,</i>

402
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,246
<i>there's no one who can replace you.</i>

403
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,211
I'm fine.

404
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,286
<i>You're fine health-wise?</i>

405
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,666
Yes, I'm fine.

406
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,262
<i>But you're panting. Are you okay?</i>

407
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,920
No, I'm not panting.

408
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,387
-I'm totally fine.
<i>-You're panting.</i>

409
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,178
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

KENTARO HIYAMA
DUE IN 212 DAYS

411
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,346
I got pregnant.

412
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,768
Abortion consent form?

413
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,066
Hiyama.

414
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,779
I remember that time too.

415
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,649
I agree about not having the baby.

416
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,355
It's me who has to bear the risk.

417
