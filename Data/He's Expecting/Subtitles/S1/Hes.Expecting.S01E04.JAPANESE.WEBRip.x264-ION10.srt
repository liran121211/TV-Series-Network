1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,510
What's that?

2
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,011
Haven't you heard?

3
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:13,263
How cool.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,596
Very fresh.

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,721
Seriously.

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,885
I can picture it.

7
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,268
It has a gender-neutral feel.

8
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,813
It's massive!

9
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:22,806
Amazing.

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,646

17

EPISODE 4

22
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,938
I was driving on the highway,
and bam! You're on a billboard!

23
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,448
I almost crashed my car.

24
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,816
Social media's going crazy!

25
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,828
Hiyama, you're totally trending!

26
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,541
It just so happened.

27
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:23,118
Man, putting your whole body out there
to carve out a new era.

28
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,128
But still…

29
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,554
Isn't his body slightly too "out there"?

30
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:32,511
I had to choose between ending up
as an ordinary office worker

31
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,012
or exposing myself to boost my worth.

32
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,806
I just chose the latter.

33
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,064
Nice one, Kentaro!

34
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,352
Thanks for waiting.
Here's your rare steak.

35
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,396
I want to talk about life stuff today.

36
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,110
-Which would you lot pick?
-The latter!

37
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,073
Well, I wouldn't be here.

38
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,989
-You can't ask that.
-I can't say.

39
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,117
Rina?

40
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:00,749
Hiyama?

41
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,039
It's been a while.

42
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,748
You're actually pregnant.

43
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,384
Well, yeah.

44
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:14,303
We won't be able to see each other anymore
since you'll be busy with childcare.

45
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,465
But I'll be back to normal by next spring.

46
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,894
I'll get a babysitter.

47
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,312
I didn't mean that.

48
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,390
I could just about stomach
my lover being a dad,

49
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,886
but absolutely not a mother.

50
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:27,977
See you.

51
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,580
Cheers!

52
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,125
Yeah! Boy Meets Girl!

53
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,630
FLOWER SHOP MIYAJI

54
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,052
Miyaji.

55
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,524
Oh, Hiyama?

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,269
-Hello.
-Hi.

57
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:10,106
I'm at a baby shower one day,
some celebration the next.

58
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,820
Parties every day.

59
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,742
Honestly, I'm tired of it.

60
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,368
I understand.

61
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,785
Friendships change, right?

62
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,210
In my case,

63
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:29,788
these aren't people I'd call friends.

64
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:35,756
Actually, maybe I never had
a single friend

65
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,604
that I could talk to like this
without putting up a front.

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,810
-Sorry for talking about this.
-Not at all.

67
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,860
Take this if you like.

68
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,321
Are you sure?

69
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:56,776
-Thanks.
-Sure.

70
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,910
It's pretty.

71
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,834
Listen, for me,

72
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,000
if it weren't for you,

73
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:09,169
I might still be hiding away
with no one to talk to.

74
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,958
We're lucky chaps.

75
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,471
Could we offer a service like that?

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,770
A sort of online platform for pregnant men

77
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,389
to share information and such.

78
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,153
We could create a space
where we can mingle.

79
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,364
-What do you think?
-I like it.

80
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,106
I mean,

81
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:42,124
we have concerns that aren't
worth going to see a doctor about, right?

82
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,028
Sure.

83
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,584
Like when my belly gets even bigger,

84
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,504
-how am I gonna pee?
-So true!

85
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,035
I've worried about that, too.

86
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,967
-It's a good idea.
-Yes.

87
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:09,805
Hello?

88
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,393
<i>Is that you, sis?</i>

89
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,020
What is it? I'm working.
I can't talk much.

90
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:19,106
Are you actually going to come
to my wedding at the end of the month?

91
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,783
You're the only one
who hasn't replied to my invite yet.

92
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,663
I'll be there, probably.

93
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,031
<i>"Probably"?</i>

94
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,077
I know you don't get along with Dad,

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,121
but come to your
sister's wedding at least.

96
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,464
<i>Alright, alright.</i>

97
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,167
I've got something
I need to tell you, too.

98
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,756
What is it? New boyfriend?

99
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,128
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

100
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,102
-Welcome.
-Sorry I'm late.

101
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,221
-Why, you little…
-Sorry!

102
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,188
-Long time no see.
-Been a while.

103
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,808
What do you want? I already ordered.

104
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,305
I'm leaving in 30 minutes.

105
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,646
What? Already?

106
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,441
I'm going to Singapore
for a month from next week.

107
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,815
I wish we'd had a drink
together with everyone.

108
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,653
-I'll be back soon.
-Excuse me.

109
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,988
-Some water.
-Thanks.

110
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:06,663
-Here's today's pasta dish.
-Thanks.

111
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,371
-I'll have the same.
-Of course.

112
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,871
-I'll take this.
-Thanks.

113
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,495
So, how about you? How's work?

114
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,125
Me? Same as usual, really.

115
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,218
-It's going peacefully.
-Peacefully?

116
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,836
-What?
-Well…

117
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,676
you used to be
the keenest fighter of us all.

118
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,516
Well, actually,

119
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,887
I'm cooking up a big project, too.

120
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,557
What is it? Give me the elevator pitch.

121
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,571
You know Kentaro Hiyama,
the guy on TV all the time?

122
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,491
Yeah.

123
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,775
I'm the mother of that kid in his belly.

124
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,373
-Seriously?
-Yep.

125
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,331
What the hell?

126
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,789
-You interested now?
-Yes!

127
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,121
From what he says,

128
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,576
pregnant men still
aren't properly recognized,

129
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,417
so maybe if I wrote a series

130
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,052
to help people understand it a little--

131
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,260
Stop right there.

132
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,295
Who wants to read
something preachy like that?

133
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,724
You've got a great scoop.

134
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,967
Write about being
a pregnant man's partner.

135
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,176
No way. I'm not selling out
my life like that.

136
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,097
Sure.

137
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,345
I'm not saying you should bare everything.

138
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,895
But the old Seto used to win
no matter what.

139
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,317
Are you really satisfied
with living peacefully?

140
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,202
Excuse me. Here's your salad.

141
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,333
<i>The world is keenly watching this man.</i>

142
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:39,825
See you later.

143
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,747
<i>Neither a showbiz celeb nor a model,</i>

144
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,927
<i>Hiyama is an advertising agent</i>

150
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,610
Sorry.

151
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,324
Bye.

152
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,072
Kentaro?

153
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:11,872
Oh?

154
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,873
Why didn't you use a pseudonym?

155
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,581
It's such a bother for your relatives.

156
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,214
There's only me and you.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,090
Dad's dead and we're not
in touch with his side of the family.

158
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,916
I suppose so.

159
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,340
You hungry?

160
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,718
-Oh, thanks.
-Here.

161
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,771
-Thanks.
-Sure.

162
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,031
Kentaro,

163
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,395
were you going to eat
all this by yourself?

164
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,874
It's true that you get a wild appetite
when pregnant, huh?

165
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,868
I've been holding back because I had
a checkup yesterday, so it's fine.

166
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,495
You're not allowed to get fat
when pregnant now, huh?

167
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,173
That's tough.

168
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,549
By the way,

169
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,461
what was Dad like?

170
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,878
What?

171
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,467
Why?

172
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,388
He was a great person.

173
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,813
So vague.

174
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,307
Why would you ask that?

175
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,612
I'm wondering what fathers
talk about with their kids

176
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,527
since mine will be out in a few months.

177
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,373
The media can’t get enough
of Kentaro Hiyama

178
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,290
who suddenly garnered attention

179
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,409
after appearing as a pregnant male model

180
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,707
in a UNIVE marketing campaign
starting this month.

181
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,963
Hiyama, your popularity is soaring

182
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,915
and you recently set up an online platform

183
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,427
which already has so many members.

184
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,759
Yes, I'm so grateful.

185
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,005
Currently we have over 10,000 members.

186
00:09:58,097 --> 00:09:58,967
Ten thousand!

187
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,136
-Amazing.
-Yeah.

188
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,104
Incredible. It's free, too?

189
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,944
-It's free of charge.
-Free!

190
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,690
My aim is to create a space to support
other pregnant men and their families

191
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,154
which is why it's free of charge.

192
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,775
-I see. Very admirable.
-No, no.

193
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,663
WHY DO MATERNITY PRODUCTS

194
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,530
HAVE SUCH CHILDISH DESIGNS?

195
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,748
THE ONE WHO'S PREGNANT IS AN ADULT!

196
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,655
MAMI LIKED YOUR POST.

197
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,417
LIKO SHARED YOUR POST.

198
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,376
You're making waves
just by stating the obvious.

199
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,087
Who knew it was so easy
to get women on your side?

200
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,302
It shows how much women have been ignored.

201
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,932
If men say it, everyone listens.

202
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,644
Pregnancy turns you
into a feminist too, huh?

203
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,976
Tao Tsuchiya is here.

204
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,153
-Hello.
-Welcome.

205
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,359
Is that Mr. Hiyama?

206
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,494
Yes.

207
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,157
I always read your posts.

208
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,948
Really?

209
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,954
My agent, who I've always worked with,

210
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,247
-recently gave birth.
-I see.

211
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,461
I hear you've provided great comfort.

212
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,631
Wow, really?

213
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,130
I'm glad to be of help.

214
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,512
Good luck. I'm rooting for you.

215
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,129
Thank you.

216
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,546
-Ms. Tsuchiya, it's time.
-Okay.

217
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,755
-Keep up the good work.
-Thanks.

218
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,385
-See you.
-Hello.

219
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,022
-Hello.
-Go ahead.

220
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,727
-Hello.
-Hello, welcome.

221
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,268
This is the head.

222
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,027
This is the left arm.

223
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,357
So it's like this.

224
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,235
Have you felt any movement yet?

225
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,872
No, not yet.

226
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,196
Okay.

227
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,373
Is that not a good thing?

228
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,332
No, no.

229
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,207
A pregnant man has more muscle mass,

230
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,540
so he'll start to feel the baby moving
later than a woman would.

231
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,249
Oh, right.

232
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,217
Do you want to know the baby's sex?

233
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,009
-What should we do?
-Huh?

234
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,047
Let's find out.

235
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:02,968
What? But…

236
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,715
Don't you want to know?

237
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:05,637
Right.

238
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,805
Then I'll tell you, okay?

239
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,977
Most likely

240
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:12,859
it's a boy.

241
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,436
A boy?

242
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,987
Did you want a girl?

243
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:21,449
No, I just felt like it was a girl.

244
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,532
How?

245
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,986
-Which did you think?
-Boy.

246
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,077
Great instinct.

247
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,042
I just thought so, for some reason.

248
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,960
I'm beat.

249
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,625
Is it okay to move like this
while pregnant?

250
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:42,598
The doctor said to exercise.

251
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,755
I might get a taxi home.

252
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,653
That's not fair! You're calling a taxi?

253
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,070
Someone messaged the platform.

254
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:02,198
"Hello, I'm also a pregnant man."

255
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,658
"I don't know anyone I can talk to

256
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,703
so I feel anxious every day."

257
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,907
"Could we meet up somewhere?"

258
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,037
Is it a prank?

259
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,592
Could be a real pregnant dude.

260
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,796
The account was made ten years ago.

261
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:21,216
Their user pic is Robert Downey Jr.

262
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,430
So it is!

263
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,559
Why don't we arrange
an offline meetup for the platform users?

264
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,555
An offline meetup?

265
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,271
-It's probably similar.
-Yeah, true.

266
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,279
What do you do?

267
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,334
I wish there were
"Baby On Board" tags for men.

268
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,198
Yeah, there's the color too.

269
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,786
They're too cutesy.

270
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,999
-We need more…
-Hello.

271
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,002
Hello.

272
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,915
-Hello.
-Hi there.

273
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,003
Wow, you're big.

274
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,586
So many people came.

275
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,758
Where have they been hiding?

276
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,269
Um…

277
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,765
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi there.

278
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,568
It's me, Robert Downey Jr.

279
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,318
-Oh!
-Right.

280
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,033
I told my girlfriend I was pregnant,

281
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,664
but she said she wants
to get back with her ex.

282
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,460
Cruel, right? She was even
seeing us both for a while.

283
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,169
That's pretty cruel.

284
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,999
Unbelievable.

285
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,964
I badgered her about the baby,

286
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,045
but she insisted on splitting up.

287
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,973
So you're giving birth as a single parent?

288
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:50,062
I've always wanted a family.

289
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,765
So, even though I'm a bit worried,

290
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,112
meeting fellow comrades like this
has given me courage.

291
00:14:59,106 --> 00:14:59,936
Same here.

292
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:06,027
Have you thought about nurseries
or where you'll raise your kid?

293
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,073
Not particularly.

294
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,656
So you haven't started hunting
for a nursery spot yet.

295
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,329
The process differs
depending on what area you live in.

296
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,409
You're talking about day care?

297
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,537
Yes, that's right.

298
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,094
You won't get a good place in Tokyo
unless you start soon.

299
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,419
Lots of moms have to quit work
when that happens.

300
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,844
Oh, I see.

301
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,343
That's amazing.

302
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,931
It's your second pregnancy?

303
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,310
We're both in our 19th week now.

304
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,479
So you'll be feeling the baby move soon.

305
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,439
I've already felt it for a while now.

306
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,310
I still haven't.

307
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,067
I mean, maybe I just haven't noticed it.

308
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,570
At first, it's just
a little bubbling sensation.

309
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,074
Maybe you wouldn't notice.

310
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,655
-Bubbling?
-Yeah.

311
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,987
Whereabouts? Lower down?

312
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,247
At first it was around here, lower down.

313
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,580
-Lower down?
-Yeah.

314
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,882
I feel like it wasn't there.

315
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,130
Where was it then?

316
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:05,711
It's hard to put it into words.

317
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,048
Come on, tell us.

318
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,132
I can't. I don't know how.

319
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,554
I clearly felt mine.

320
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,057
FLOWER SHOP MIYAJI

321
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,308
They were all pregnant men
but all so different.

322
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,311
Sure were.

323
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,272
We were the hosts,

324
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,272
but we were the ones getting advice.

325
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,324
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

326
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:28,648
Hey, are you on TV?

327
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,607
A bit.

328
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,491
So that means it's not weird

329
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:35,294
that Dad's got a baby in his belly, right?

330
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,409
It's not weird.

331
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,246
I knew it. Yay!

332
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,791
Takuya, you're heavy!

333
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,336
Go to him.

334
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,300
Hush, calm down!

335
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,800
You don't need to get so upset.

336
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,932
Come here, Takuya.

337
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,716
Come on.

338
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:55,012
Don't run about in front of our guest.

339
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,021
Huh?

340
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,727
I think I felt the baby move.

341
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,151
What? A bubbling sensation?

342
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,162
Yeah, like bubbling up.

343
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,948
That's definitely the baby!

344
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,032
-Right?
-Yeah.

345
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,656
-I felt it.
-You did.

346
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,833
-Yep.
-Amazing.

347
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,865
So this is it.

348
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,875
Humbled, we must tell the gods

349
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:30,218
that Aki Seto,

350
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,139
grace be to the gods
of creation and fertility,

351
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,770
now carries a child,

352
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,678
thus we beseech you to bring her
quiet and peaceful days…

353
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,058
But <i>I'm</i> carrying the kid.

354
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,776
Please accept these gifts.

355
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,152
-May the baby be healthy.
-Um…

356
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,195
I'm the one giving birth.

357
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,492
-Oh, of course.
-Yeah.

358
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,115
To the expecting father…

359
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,792
I mean, mother…

360
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,501
I wish you a healthy child.

361
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,214
The priest totally did that on purpose.

362
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,882
Sure won't be the last time
that kind of thing happens.

363
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,638
"That kind of thing"?

364
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,346
I mean

365
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,980
not only are you a pregnant man

366
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,023
but we'll be raising a kid
out of wedlock.

367
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,897
Yeah, about that.

368
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,819
Are we really not getting married?

369
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,160
Normally people get married properly

370
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,660
then raise children.

371
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,580
You're really talking
about what's "normal"?

372
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,287
We've done everything under our own names.

373
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,550
Then suddenly we have to choose
one or the other.

374
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,631
The idea of changing my name…

375
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,303
I don't really get it.

376
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,596
It's not just my own problem.

377
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,890
It's about the world
this kid will be living in, too.

378
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,386
Sure, I get that.

379
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,856
But why?

380
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,322
How can you ask that?

381
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:16,031
Surely you just experienced
what it's like when roles get reversed

382
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,243
between men and women.

383
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,122
-That's not what I meant.
-Oh?

384
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,449
I meant, where did that idea come from?

385
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:25,908
Why…

386
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,206
Yes?

387
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,799
Noriko? Yes.

388
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:37,932
What?

389
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,143
What?

390
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,517
Noriko.

391
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,605
Hiyama.

392
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,361
How's Miyaji?

393
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,115
<i>The doctor said</i>

394
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,883
there was a cytomegalovirus infection

395
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,208
which caused the contractions to start.

396
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,179
But…

397
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,553
at only 20 weeks old,

398
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,851
the baby couldn't survive
outside the womb, so…

399
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,442
So…

400
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:38,275
I would never say this to my husband…

401
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,914
but now that the baby won't be born,

402
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,372
a part of me feels relieved.

403
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,673
What?

404
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,763
Takuya is being bullied at school.

405
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,512
Kids say it's gross
that his dad's pregnant.

406
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,183
People have also treated me coldly.

407
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,193
This…

408
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,073
I know it's wrong.

409
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,868
I'm still so sad.

410
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,540
But somehow,

411
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,671
I also feel relieved.

412
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,466
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,324
Isn't it wrong to be bullied

414
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,612
because your dad's pregnant?

415
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,822
I feel so sorry for Takuya.

416
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:12,905
Noriko…

417
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,915
If she knew her son was being bullied,

418
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,797
wasn't there something she could do?

419
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,881
It's not her fault.

420
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,432
-She's suffered too.
-I know, but…

421
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,180
A child being bullied…

422
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,309
That could happen to our child, too.

423
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,980
You keep talking about your own situation.

424
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,437
Miyaji's baby dies,

425
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,324
but you're worrying about your own kid?

426
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,491
It's not like that.

427
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,857
I'm just saying

428
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,527
our choices could end up

429
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,906
interfering with our kid's life.

430
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,163
Sure, family can be a burden sometimes,

431
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:53,995
but we help each other out, too.

432
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,828
A parent protects their child
if something happens.

433
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,998
That's what I've always done with my mom.

434
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:05,129
Some things can't be handled
through logic alone, Aki.

435
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,721
Familial love, bonding…

436
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,386
Those things all sound good,

437
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,644
but they aren't necessarily
always helpful.

438
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,061
You and I…

439
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,775
Aren't our ideas of family too different?

440
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:27,735
What?

441
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:34,905
Maybe I can't raise
this kid with you, Aki.

442
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,345
KENTARO HIYAMA
DUE IN 137 DAYS

443
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,192
<i>What's wrong?</i>

444
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,442
Nothing. Here.

445
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,233
Stop being a disgrace.

446
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,606
Bloody mutants.

447
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,362
I won't be a disgrace.

448
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,459
