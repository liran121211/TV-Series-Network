1
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:17,851
<i>You and I…</i>

2
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:21,154
Aren't our ideas of family too different?

3
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,913
<i>You're still not here?</i>

4
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,043
It's fine. I think I'll make it.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,120
The wedding day is scheduled
in ten-minute slots.

6
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,116
Don't mess it up.

7
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:43,377
I said I'm sorry.

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,920
<i>This is why I told you</i>
<i>to stay over here last night.</i>

9
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,415
No way. Spare me that, at least.

10
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,136
Hurry up!

11
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,772
-The whole family's waiting.
-I know, I know.

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,020
Why do you always cut it so close?

13
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,652
Your dad's all worked up
about you not being here yet.

14
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,270
I won't go near him so it's fine.

15
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:06,226
-Aki.
-What?

16
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,936
-No fights today, okay?
-Right.

17
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,487
Let him win, just for today.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,610
-I got it.
-Okay.

19
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,202
-Aki's here, dear.
-Long time no see.

20
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:20,247
Oh.

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,620
Hello. I made it.

22
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:23,633
You're late.

23
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,344
Our two families are meeting
and my eldest daughter is missing.

24
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,511
What will the other parents think?
Stop embarrassing me.

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,641
Can't you just settle down?

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,930
Your younger sister beat you to marriage.

27
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,222
You should be embarrassed.

28
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,766
Are you still single, Aki?

29
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,729
Yeah.

30
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,694
Better hurry up.

31
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,979
Plenty of men in Tokyo, surely?

32
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,563
Plenty of women too, you know.

33
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,818
Make sure you get chosen.

34
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,239
Fat chance of that happening.

35
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,568
No one would choose this selfish brat.

36
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,236
It's not a matter of being chosen--

37
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:57,584
Don't quibble!

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,489
Come now, you two. Aki!

39
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,867
If she's of childbearing age,

40
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,166
surely someone will still have her.

41
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:09,047
You want kids too, don't you?

42
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,224
Sure, but…

43
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:13,968
-Without a partner--
-Hey!

44
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,430
What about that family's son
who got divorced recently?

45
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,272
Where does he work again?

46
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,058
-Yamaguchi Supermarket.
-Yes!

47
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,189
Couldn't we fix something?

48
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,105
EPISODE 5

49
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,697
ARE YOU OKAY, MIYAJI?
FOCUS ON YOUR HEALTH FOR NOW.

50
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,334
I'LL MANAGE THE PLATFORM.

51
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,515
SYMPTOMS TO PAY ATTENTION TO

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,855
BEWARE IF FETAL MOVEMENTS STOP

53
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,900
Really?

54
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,282
We can't identify the source of the pain,

55
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,541
but if I had to say,
we may expect a premature birth.

56
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,924
Since it's a male pregnancy
the baby won't come out early,

57
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,294
but surgery may be necessary.

58
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,423
Surgery?

59
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,797
Will I be okay on my own?

60
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,894
On your own?

61
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,184
I mean, after what happened to Miyaji,

62
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,813
I'm a little anxious.

63
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,845
It's a shame what happened to Miyaji.

64
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,981
But you know, Hiyama.

65
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,153
No pregnancy comes without risks.

66
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,606
You're birthing life, you see.

67
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,363
You're right.

68
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,088
The second round of our UNIVE campaign
went live today,

69
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,379
running simultaneously in magazines,
online, on billboards and such.

70
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,264
I saw a billboard
on the way to work this morning.

71
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,842
Hiyama's the only model now.

72
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,388
You're killing it!

73
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,851
Using this as momentum,

74
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,101
I'd like to give an overview
of future plans we’ve decided upon,

75
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,734
with Hiyama as
our company's main ambassador.

76
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:35,982
As you can see, we have plans set up
until the baby turns three.

77
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,737
A baby shower, a birth documentary,
workshops with other dads--

78
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,201
Wait, a birth documentary?

79
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,830
Pregnant men give birth by c-section
so you can't film it closely.

80
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:49,621
Rather than the actual birth itself,

81
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,246
we'll cover the family
pre- and post-birth,

82
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,173
and what it's like to live with the baby.

83
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,713
This is the first I've heard of it.

84
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:02,177
You can't make these plans
without asking me first.

85
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,721
Don't just decide without me.

86
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,264
Isn't it a bit late for that?

87
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,144
By having a long-term plan
from birth onward,

88
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,897
we'll get the entire nation
to watch the baby grow.

89
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,150
Yes, but this is quite--

90
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,361
You said you'd do anything.

91
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,032
That's why we're doing it.

92
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,530
You work in advertising, too.
Surely you get it.

93
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,950
We're on a tight schedule. Let's move on.

94
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,075
Right.

95
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,291
Okay, next.

96
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,544
They must be joking!

97
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,669
Saying what they like
because it's not their problem.

98
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,220
-What are you doing?
-Searching for something sweet.

99
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,547
You're scowling.

100
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:46,926
Indeed I am!

101
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,353
"Indeed"?

102
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,394
I don't know if it'll help, but here.

103
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,357
It's <i>fugashi </i>cake.

104
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,606
Thank you.

105
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,407
-Matsuno.
-Yes?

106
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,664
Thanks for everything.

107
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,959
<i>What? You're quitting?</i>

108
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,543
We just launched the second round today.

109
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,838
You do know how much trouble it'll cause

110
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,762
if we take down UNIVE's ads now, right?

111
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,930
Sorry, I've reached my limit.

112
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,970
I shouldn't have spoken like that
in this morning's meeting.

113
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,604
But don't quit suddenly because of that.

114
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,654
It's not just because of this morning.

115
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,855
I've thought it over. Here.

116
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,110
RESIGNATION LETTER

117
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,941
Wait, hold on.

118
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,363
Honestly, what's wrong with you?

119
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,985
Nothing. Here.

120
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,029
Put that away.

121
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,116
-Look…
-Message received.

122
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,371
Please take it.

123
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,542
-Give me some time, okay?
-No.

124
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,751
Thank you so much.

125
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,328
See you.

126
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,668
Friends from high school?

127
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,252
Yeah, we were good pals.

128
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,415
Nice to see you as always.

129
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,717
Thanks for today.

130
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,012
Thank you.

131
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:11,805
Brings back memories!

132
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,769
See you soon.

133
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,519
Is everything okay?

134
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,900
Maybe it's the pregnancy.
He seems unstable, in any case.

135
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
-Even the CEO is here.
-Hiyama.

136
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,943
You are essentially
the face of our company now.

137
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,781
Even if that's the case…

138
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,405
We'd suffer a great loss if you left us.

139
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,332
Hiyama.

140
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,500
Our CEO is always looking out for you.

141
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,082
You're hope for other pregnant men.

142
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,300
Think of your contribution
to society, okay?

143
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:49,891
Boss.

144
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,643
You really think that highly of me?

145
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,190
Of course I do.

146
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,440
Pioneers must struggle in any era.

147
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:03,984
Right?

148
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,277
Something's definitely up.

149
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,825
Are you okay?

150
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,579
I'm fine.

151
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,746
I'm fine,

152
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,130
it's just that
so much is happening at once

153
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,299
and I just can't control myself.

154
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,798
-Hiyama!
-Don't worry!

155
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,466
We'll control it together, okay?

156
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,391
That's what our company's for.

157
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,890
Yeah, you're right.

158
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,483
You're all here for me, right?

159
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,809
Yes! So you get it?

160
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,400
I understand.

161
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,896
I'll continue.

162
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,488
-Thank you!
-I'll continue.

163
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,780
I'm so glad to hear it!

164
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,203
Thank you, I'm so grateful.

165
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,291
Boss…

166
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,514
Wait, are you going out?

167
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,434
Yeah. To a reunion party.

168
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,635
No idea how many people
will be there though.

169
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,313
At least have dinner with us today.

170
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,185
Your dad's waiting in the living room.

171
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,111
There's a lot to talk about.

172
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,069
Sorry, I already said I'd go.

173
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,487
What's there to talk about?

174
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,146
Well…

175
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,912
I'm worried
you're pushing yourself too hard.

176
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,290
You can easily find work here.

177
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,867
Don't be so stubborn.

178
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,667
I'm not being stubborn.

179
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,422
I'm living my life doing work I love.

180
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:56,474
But we've all given up
on what we first wanted to do.

181
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,023
I had things I wanted to do
when I was younger

182
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,310
but I held back after you were born.

183
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,397
That's not the case for everyone.

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,690
It's standard for most people.

185
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:13,491
In the end, it's very difficult

186
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:16,155
for a woman to live as she likes.

187
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,945
Do as your father says
and get married soon--

188
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,538
Something's wrong with that thinking!

189
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,464
If there's something you want to do,
you should do it.

190
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,552
You can leave him, you know.

191
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,642
Sorry, but it seems like
you just do whatever he says.

192
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,929
Why don't you
care about yourself a bit more?

193
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,532
How old are you now?

194
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,530
I'm 35.

195
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,409
It's time to plant your feet
in the ground.

196
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,961
Stop living a life of disgrace.

197
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,897
Welcome!

198
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,150
Look!

199
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,067
It's Aki!

200
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,107
Long time no see!

201
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,696
How are you doing? It's been ages!

202
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,281
-You live in Tokyo, right?
-Yeah.

203
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,446
-Wow.
-Remember me?

204
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,035
Of course. Yuko, right?

205
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,249
-Long time!
-Didn't remember me, huh?

206
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,554
Excuse me! A beer, please.

207
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,126
You're so hyped up!

208
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,216
No, no.

209
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,010
-Brings back memories.
-Sure does!

210
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,644
You seen this?

211
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,011
-Yeah.
-You have?

212
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,767
-You know it?
-Yes!

213
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,979
-And?
-Huh…

214
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,095
-Really going for it, huh?
-No, not that bit.

215
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,187
So cute.

216
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,312
Super cute.

217
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,438
He's a handsome boy.

218
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,361
Yeah, he doesn't look like you.

219
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,994
How many kids do you have?

220
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,490
Me? Three daughters.

221
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,412
I'd like a daughter.

222
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,290
Sure, but three is tiring.

223
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,999
Don't you have a boyfriend, Aki?

224
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,580
Well, I suppose I do, but…

225
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,745
Marriage isn't on the cards.

226
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,625
What do you mean?
You don't think you'll marry?

227
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,473
Wow, Tokyo's another planet.

228
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,378
I guess so.

229
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,086
Aki lives for her work, see.

230
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,303
What kind of work do you do?

231
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,394
I'm a freelance writer.

232
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:49,136
I write about company projects online

233
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,443
and do posts for their social media.

234
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,980
That's amazing.

235
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:55,944
It's not amazing at all.

236
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,279
-Hey…
-Who's this old guy?

237
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,780
Men having babies?

238
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,363
-The guy on the news?
-Yeah.

239
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,908
They're mutants!

240
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,292
-Normally…
-You're drunk!

241
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,288
It's a woman's job to give birth.

242
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,410
Right, sure.

243
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,577
So, if a man gets pregnant…

244
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,043
-Right?
-So gross.

245
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,127
I'm not sure if it's gross,

246
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,223
but if my husband got pregnant,

247
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,508
I wouldn't be brave enough
to let him give birth.

248
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,972
-Right?
-Definitely.

249
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,062
I'd worry whether the baby would be okay.

250
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,428
It's actually scary.

251
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,595
Men who get pregnant
might have some genetic problem.

252
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,524
-What?
-Yeah.

253
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,612
It's been proven that medically speaking,

254
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,358
any man could become pregnant.

255
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,611
Really?

256
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,942
-So…
-You knew?

257
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:44,107
So, a man's baby probably wouldn't be
any different to a woman's.

258
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,778
But still!

259
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,697
I don't think it's very manly.

260
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,997
-Just speaking plainly.
-Sure.

261
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,251
I just think it's gross!

262
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,341
Too right.

263
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,418
His partner's still a woman.

264
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,094
I'd feel sorry for her.

265
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,092
True, if your man got pregnant,

266
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,175
-you could never tell people.
-Right.

267
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,971
You'd have to hide it forever.

268
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,104
It's just tragic.

269
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,010
Right?

270
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,678
What's tragic?

271
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:15,346
It's sad that she can't
fulfill her role as a woman.

272
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,307
-Yeah.
-Right.

273
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,477
"Role" as a woman?

274
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,319
Because of prejudice like that,

275
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:25,202
real pregnant men can't talk to anyone.

276
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,949
They get abandoned by their partners

277
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,240
and give up on their babies.

278
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,157
But if I got pregnant,

279
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:37,127
I'd be too shaken up
to happily announce it.

280
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,752
I'd find it too scary, for sure.

281
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:45,088
It's scary for women, too.

282
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,893
-True.
-Yeah.

283
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,637
What does it even mean
to be "manly" like you said?

284
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,774
Aki, are you okay? What's wrong?

285
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,689
Nothing.

286
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,769
You okay?

287
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,532
-Have you eaten something?
-Yeah.

288
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,489
Maybe I'll have another.

289
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,803
-Welcome back.
-Hello.

290
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,178
How was the reunion?

291
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,309
Find any good single men?

292
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,225
Why are you just standing there?

293
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,438
Have a seat.

294
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,155
What on earth is it?

295
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,375
I need to tell you something, Dad.

296
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:09,092
I have a boyfriend in Tokyo.

297
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,812
He and I

298
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,309
are having a baby.

299
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,231
Really?

300
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,443
Why didn't you tell us
something that important?

301
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,532
And?

302
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,737
Say it clearly.

303
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,454
If you're pregnant,

304
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,332
there's lots to discuss and get on with.

305
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,370
It's not me.

306
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,458
I'm not pregnant.

307
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,422
What?

308
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,666
He's pregnant.

309
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,100
It's a male pregnancy.

310
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,475
That can't be true.

311
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,481
He's been on the news.

312
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,652
Kentaro Hiyama.

313
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,203
You know him, right?

314
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,329
He's my boyfriend.

315
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:22,617
I'm the mother of his child.

316
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,880
No proper man would get pregnant!

317
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,304
I can never understand
people who say stuff like that.

318
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,310
If that's going to be your attitude,

319
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,309
I'll keep living in Tokyo.

320
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,269
I'll keep working

321
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,988
and become a mother there.

322
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,781
I won't bother you.

323
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,948
My life won't be a disgrace.

324
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,530
Hello?

325
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,569
<i>It's me.</i>

326
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,332
<i>Are you free to talk?</i>

327
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,043
Yeah.

328
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,289
<i>I'm heading back to Tokyo now,</i>

329
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,922
<i>but I called because</i>
<i>there's something I want to say.</i>

330
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,380
Where are you now?

331
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,512
The station in my hometown.

332
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,642
I'm on the platform waiting for the train.

333
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,428
<i>What did you want to say?</i>

334
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,015
It's about what you said the other day.

335
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:13,818
That you can't raise a kid with me.

336
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,025
<i>Yeah.</i>

337
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,279
<i>I did say that.</i>

338
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,960
No matter what you say,

339
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,828
I'd raise that kid properly, too.

340
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,462
<i>We have a strange relationship.</i>

341
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,262
<i>It's not like we were ever dating.</i>

342
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,471
That's right.

343
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:44,182
But I don't think it matters.

344
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,895
We can create
our own new kind of relationship

345
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,112
and raise our kid together.

346
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:59,868
<i>We don't need to be trapped</i>
<i>by fixed ideas or values.</i>

347
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:04,577
<i>There are all these roles and expectations</i>
<i>but really, everyone's different.</i>

348
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:07,577
What are you talking about?

349
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:12,205
I don't think prejudice is going anywhere.

350
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,174
But if it's with you,

351
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,549
I think we can create
a new way of doing things.

352
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,479
You do?

353
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,023
Got it.

354
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,067
<i>My train's here.</i>

355
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,025
<i>Sorry, I have to go.</i>

356
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,695
What's up with her?

357
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,458
Thanks for coming to pick me up.

358
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,668
I couldn't sit still
after hearing your voice.

359
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,630
Sorry for making you worry.

360
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,465
I've had some time to think since.

361
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,798
Listen, at one point,

362
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,348
I did say I couldn't raise a kid with you.

363
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,483
But honestly,
I've been a bundle of nerves since then.

364
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,187
I guess, after all,

365
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,484
it's tough going it alone.

366
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,864
That's clear from seeing
my own mother, too.

367
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,664
So I'm grateful for what you said
on the phone.

368
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,370
Thank you.

369
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:27,202
I was trying to sort out my own feelings,

370
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,620
so I just blurted it out.

371
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,792
Aki, after you hung up the phone,

372
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,626
<i>I felt the baby move</i>
<i>for the first time in so long.</i>

373
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,931
<i>I think this kid</i>

374
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,599
<i>also knows you as the mother,</i>

375
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,473
<i>and needs your love.</i>

376
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,890
That's why I think…

377
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,814
always being together is better.

378
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:00,816
Let's…

379
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,201
get married.

380
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,575
I never had a father.

381
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,584
But because of that,
I'll be a good husband and a good dad.

382
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,211
And a mother, I guess.

383
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,997
Father? Mother?

384
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,585
-Listen, Kentaro.
-Yeah?

385
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,340
Just to be clear.

386
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,090
I decided we'd raise this kid together.

387
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,177
Right.

388
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:29,141
But I think marriage is a different issue.

389
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,222
What? Hold on.

390
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:36,484
Are we going to raise the kid together?

391
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,773
-Yes, of course.
-Right? Okay.

392
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:43,947
What I want is to continue talking
about how we'll balance that.

393
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,617
We can consider marriage another time.

394
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,660
Oh, I see. That's what you meant.

395
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,325
I understand, I think.

396
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,424
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

397
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,542
-Take care.
-Okay.

398
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,092
So…

399
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,882
Let's have a fresh start tomorrow.

400
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,927
Let's keep talking and making decisions.

401
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,012
Yeah. Thanks.

402
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,017
Been a while, Kentaro.

403
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,230
Who are you?

404
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,237
What?

405
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:25,821
I'm your dad.

406
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,454
What?

407
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,655
Oh, right.

408
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,659
Well…

409
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,037
I'm also your mom.

410
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,381
Nice to meet you.

411
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,894
She's a cutie.

412
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,349
KENTARO HIYAMA
DUE IN 131 DAYS

413
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,846
<i>Is he okay in your house?</i>

414
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,937
I've been waiting to meet you for so long.

415
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,692
You're throwing it all away for him?

416
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,484
Why do men chase their dreams,

417
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,238
while women play supporting roles?

418
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,359
Dad.

419
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,512
