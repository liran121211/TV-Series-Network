A large crane operator doing work in Trenton loses control, colliding into a building and parking garage. The team joins firefighters, law enforcement, physicians, EMTs and rescue personnel to scour the wreckage for survivors. House hears noises coming from the parking garage but he cannot convince firefighters to make more than a cursory investigation. House stubbornly crawls into the wreckage to investigate the noises; a hand grabs his cane, \"Carrie\" style. He finds a woman in her mid-30s alive, but trapped with a leg pinned under the wreckage. She does not want to be rescued if it means amputation; because of his leg, House both understands and advocates for her. But, as time passes, priorities change; and House is forced to re-evaluate his beliefs.\u2014LA-Lawyer"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1503406", "rating": 9.5, "votes": 6215, "number_of_episodes": 176}
