With no definitive explanation for Benjamin's loss of consciousness and unresponsiveness to treatment, House pushes just the right buttons to recruit former prison doctor Jessica Adams to volunteer her time and expertise to the case. Benjamin then makes a bold but life-threatening offer that could save another life, and the team must diagnose his disorder before he puts his own life on the line. Meanwhile, Adams and Park test each other's outlook on generosity and gratitude, and Thirteen's guilt conflicts with her pursuit of personal happiness.\u2014Fox Publicity"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2016511", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 2677, "number_of_episodes": 176}
