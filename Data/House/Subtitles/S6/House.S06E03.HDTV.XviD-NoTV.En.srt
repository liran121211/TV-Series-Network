As always, i appreciate
your caution, joseph,

8
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:23,883
But, as always, you have
far too much of it.

9
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:48,017
Stay down, sir.

10
00:00:53,284 --> 00:00:54,384
Get on the ground.

11
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:58,517

a couple of weeks.

What happened to them?

30
00:02:14,017 --> 00:02:15,117
He quit,

You two are both competent,

00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,150
You really do know
how to woo.

35
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:24,484
I need you.

36
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:26,817
It would be interesting.

37
00:02:26,883 --> 00:02:27,850
We could work together.

38
00:02:27,917 --> 00:02:29,917
Did you see
who the patient is?

39
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:31,984
That's one of the reasons
it'll be interesting.

40
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,284
Dibala is one

41
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,050
Of the most repressive dictators
in the world.

42
00:02:35,117 --> 00:02:37,117
You had no problem treating
a guy on death row.

43
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,184
Who was still in prison
after we patched him up.

44
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,551
We fix dibala,
he gets on a plane

And executes half his country.

46
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:43,684
He's been repressing
an ethnic rebellion

47
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,883
In the south,
the sitibi people.

48
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,050
It's getting worse.

49
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:51,317
Dibala is a guest
of the u.s. government.

00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:53,050

I'm asking you

53
00:02:59,284 --> 00:03:02,251
Utterly incomprehensible.

54
00:03:02,317 --> 00:03:03,351
And, of course, i'm talking

55
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:05,251
About you firing
your girlfriend.

56
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:06,417
We weren't getting along
with her working under me.

57
00:03:06,484 --> 00:03:07,451
This'll help.

58
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,017
Cameron and i work together.

59
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:10,150
But you weren't
her boss.

60
00:03:10,217 --> 00:03:11,984
And you stopped
working together.

61
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,984
Why don't you just tell her
you were wrong?

62
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,484
'cause i wasn't.

63
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,917
I know how this looks.

64
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:19,150
I know
it might break us up.

65
00:03:19,217 --> 00:03:21,050
But that's better
than definitely breaking us up,

66
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,950
Which is what would
have happened otherwise.

67
00:03:25,017 --> 00:03:27,317
Hemorrhagic ulcers

68
00:03:31,384 --> 00:03:32,917
Oh, my god,

00:03:32,984 --> 00:03:35,217
It's three years ago.

70
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:36,750
Does that mean
i'm still crazy?

71
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:39,317
You're back?
you look good.

72
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,150
We're just helping out

73
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:43,783

<i>my condolences.</i>

00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:48,651
Although it's not like she's
the hottest woman in the world.

77
00:03:48,718 --> 00:03:50,451
We haven't broken up.

78
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,284
Are you back?
sort of.

79
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:53,451
Did you get your license back?

80
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:54,618
Not for a month
or so.

81
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,984
So you'll be in charge.

82
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,517
I'm just gonna pitch in
a little.

Acid reflux?

90
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,417
No history of asthma

But i guess i do have
a higher duty to the patient.

00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:29,750
If you have something to say,
say it.

98
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,084
You're rushing
to a diagnosis

99
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,618
Because you're rushing out
of this room

100
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:33,618
Because you're rightly upset
with me.

101
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:35,150
Although i wasn't the one

102
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:36,883
Who made that asinine decision.

103
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,351
Do you have anything medical
to say?

104
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,651
Poison fits better

105
00:04:40,718 --> 00:04:41,883
Because of the vomiting.

106
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,584
Bug bite might not be
a bite.

107
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,718
It might be the start
of chloracne.

108
00:04:45,783 --> 00:04:48,150
Assassination attempt
through dioxin poisoning.

109
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:49,184

111
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:58,351
Start him on olestra.

112
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:02,783
You couldn't have just said
dioxin up front?

113
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,618
I was hoping you'd get there
on your own.

114
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:15,484
So i guess we should talk
to cuddy.

115
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:17,317
It is dioxin?

116
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:20,017
No.

117
00:05:20,084 --> 00:05:21,351
It's our best guess.

118
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:23,950
<i>the olestra here binds
to the poison</i>

119
00:05:24,017 --> 00:05:25,551
And flushes it
out of your system.

120
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:27,017
Where are you from,
doctor?

121
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:28,017
I'm australian.

122
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:30,618
Do i hear a bit
of the british?

123
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:32,551
Most people don't notice it.

124
00:05:32,618 --> 00:05:35,117
Yeah, i kicked
around there for a while.

125
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:36,484
You went
to medical school there?

126
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:38,850
Actually a year
of seminary.

127
00:05:38,917 --> 00:05:40,584
<i>and you left.
uh-huh.</i>

128
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:46,050
There was a catholic mission
near my childhood village.

129
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:47,284
I liked the priests.

130
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,684
They were good people.

131
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,150
<i>but when
my two younger sisters</i>

132
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,184
Were dying
from consumption,

133
00:05:54,251 --> 00:05:56,618
It wasn't more priests
we wanted.

134
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:03,417
I fired my girlfriend

135
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:04,984
Because he said he was gone
for good.

136
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:08,917
I need this
in my life.

137
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:10,351
A week ago, it was
the last thing you needed.

138
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:11,817
It's a process.

139
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:12,817
I'm learning.

140
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:14,684
And screwing me over
as you go.

141
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,150
Yeah, that's why i did it.

142
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:19,584
Sorry.

143
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:21,850
If you want,
i'll explain it to thirteen.

144
00:06:21,917 --> 00:06:22,850
He's not ready.

145
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,917
He doesn't have
his license.

146
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,883
Then he can't practice.

147
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,984
But we'd be idiots
not to listen to him.

148
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,984
<i>you're in charge,</i>

149
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,783
<i>he sits in
on all the differentials.</i>

150
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,451
Until you get
your license back,

151
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:36,251
This is all unofficial.

152
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:38,251
No procedures,
no patient contact.

153
00:06:38,317 --> 00:06:41,783
Think i can probably deal
with that last one.

154
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:44,351
[knock at door]

155
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:50,817
The only reason
i let you go

156
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:51,817
Is because our relationship
wouldn't work

157
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:54,651
If i was in charge.

158
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:58,117
But i won't be
in charge soon, so...

159
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:59,984
I came to offer you
your old job back.

160
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:04,783
I know.
i look bad.

161
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,017
But circumstances
have changed.

162
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,883
I don't want the job.

163
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,351
Why not?

164
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,217
Because there's a much simpler
explanation for you firing me.

165
00:07:12,284 --> 00:07:14,317
You wanted to break up with me,
but you were too weak

166
00:07:14,384 --> 00:07:16,050
To do it yourself.

167
00:07:16,117 --> 00:07:17,551
Then why would i try
to hire you back?

168
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:21,718
Can we please get
some dinner tonight?

169
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:23,618
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:30,517
Uh, you're a follow-up?

171
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:33,950
You must not treat him.

172
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:41,551
Dibala killed my wife.

173
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:43,251
She was a trade unionist.

174
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:45,184
He took her

175
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:47,017
From our home

176
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:47,984
While i was at work.

177
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,750
Who took her?

178
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,850
Dibala's youth labor league.

179
00:07:51,917 --> 00:07:54,883
He pretends it's to get
young people off the street.

180
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,883
But he takes teenage boys
from the provinces

181
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:00,451
And feeds them drugs
and alcohol

182
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:05,150
And teaches them
how to torture.

183
00:08:05,217 --> 00:08:08,783
They dumped her body in my yard
two weeks later.

184
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,251
They raped her.

185
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:15,618
<i>they carved inyenzi, cockroach,
onto her stomach</i>

186
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,251
Because she's sitibi.

187
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:20,451
I'm very sorry, but i can't
discuss other patients.

188
00:08:20,517 --> 00:08:21,917
You should talk
to a lawyer,

189
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,050
Talk to the u.n...

190
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:24,050
So they can sit and watch,

191
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,217
Like they did in rwanda?

192
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:30,050
There are 2 million sitibi.

193
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:32,451
<i>he's planning
to massacre them all.</i>

194
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:36,618
His radio stations are talking
about a final war

195
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:37,950
To exterminate
the cockroaches.

196
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:43,584
He can't recover.

197
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,017
I'm sorry.

198
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,351
How was your first day
of school?

199
00:08:56,418 --> 00:08:58,051
Didn't pee once
in the sandbox.

200
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,750
How was it
with cuddy?

201
00:08:59,817 --> 00:09:02,217
What did you think
i was talking about?

202
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:05,151
Hmm.
you didn't use garlic.

203
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:07,784
You didn't use it
last night either.

204
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,017
We always use garlic
on chicken florentine.

205
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:11,318
It tastes fine
this way.

206
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,284
You seem to be losing
your sense of smell.

207
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,750
I think you're losing
your sense of mind.

208
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,351
I can check right now
if you pull my finger.

209
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:21,550
No, it's the--

210
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:26,750
<i>are you inventing
some big medical mystery here?</i>

211
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,318
Because if you're imagining
things again...

212
00:09:28,384 --> 00:09:31,017
You weren't wearing shoes
last night either.

213
00:09:31,084 --> 00:09:33,184
[sighs]

214
00:09:33,251 --> 00:09:36,284
Yes, shoes, garlic--

215
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:38,117
I am vampire, sookie.

216
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:43,717

217
00:09:43,784 --> 00:09:46,617
[responsive banging]

218
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:50,017
I told you to get
that echo fixed.

219
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,550
My downstairs neighbor,
after you moved in,

220
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:54,117
Started complaining
about the extra noise

221
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:55,617
And the cooking smells.

222
00:09:55,684 --> 00:09:56,817
What's his name?

223
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:59,184
I don't want you
making things worse.

224
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:00,617
He's on the condo board,

225
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:02,318
And i'm trying to get
the back garden renovated.

226
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,084
The white coats taught me
a whole bunch

227
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,617
Of fun coping
and relating skills.

228
00:10:05,684 --> 00:10:08,051
He's not only a total jerk,

229
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:10,017
He's a decorated war hero

230
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:12,184
Who lost an arm
in vietnam.

231
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:14,384
I mean, there's no winning
with this guy.

232
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:17,217
Coping skill number one...
[cell phone rings]

233
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,084
Complete avoidance.

234
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,784
You happy?

235
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,917
Booty call?

236
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:24,684
Give me 20 minutes
to not shower.

237
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,251
Patient's having
a heart attack.

238
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:27,418
Mask at 15 liters.

239
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:28,884
<i>just thought you'd like
to know.</i>

240
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:39,584
Lassa fever.

241
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,584
You were mad
that i withheld it last time,

242
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,984
So i'm saying it
right up front.

243
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,151
He's already stabilized,

244
00:10:46,217 --> 00:10:47,251
So 40 ccs

245
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:48,683
Of ribavirin,

246
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,217
<i>and we're home
in time for ellen.</i>

247
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:52,750
I checked. there's no lassa
in dibala's country.

248
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,551
Oh.
the rash is gone.

249
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,618
It rules out
your dioxin theory.

250
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:58,618
He's running a slight fever,
which we can add

251
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,050
To the heart,
plus the lung ulcers.

252
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,284
<i>(chase)
ebola? marburg?</i>

253
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:03,151
Too long
an incubation period.

254
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:06,017
Yes?
don't people sometimes travel?

255
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:07,850
To places that have,
you know, a fever

256
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,451
That originated
in the nigerian town of lassa?

257
00:11:10,518 --> 00:11:12,750
He's been to three other
countries in the last two years:

258
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:14,750
Here, zimbabwe, and
sharm el-sheikh, egypt.

259
00:11:14,817 --> 00:11:16,251
No lassa there either.

260
00:11:16,317 --> 00:11:17,551
Oh.

261
00:11:17,618 --> 00:11:18,584
Again.

262
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,017
Trypanosomiasis?

263
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:22,184
No sleep disturbances.

264
00:11:22,251 --> 00:11:23,417
But fits best
with the symptoms.

265
00:11:23,484 --> 00:11:24,518
And it's geographically
the most--

266
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:25,551
What?

267
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,984
The egypt visit

268
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,484
Was for the african union
meeting,

269
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:30,017
Where i'm guessing he was
meeting people

270
00:11:30,084 --> 00:11:31,217
From africa.

271
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:33,317
Which includes liberia,

272
00:11:33,384 --> 00:11:34,683
Which sent some members
of their foreign ministry,

273
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,750
Which has itself
just been hit by an outbreak

274
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:37,817
Of jock itch.

275
00:11:37,884 --> 00:11:40,084
No, wait.
not jock itch.

276
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:41,217
Lassa fever.

277
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:45,117
I'll start the ribavirin.

278
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:48,084
I did say it up front.

279
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:52,484
It's great to have the old team
back together again, huh?

280

<i>(ntila)

281
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,650

284

Leave him alone.

285

These people know
what they are doing.

286
00:12:09,551 --> 00:12:10,917
Are you married,
doctor?

287
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:12,551
No.

288
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:15,284
<i>you have a girlfriend.</i>

289
00:12:15,351 --> 00:12:16,484
Yes.

290
00:12:16,551 --> 00:12:19,584
Judging
by your tentative answer

291
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,850
And the complicated expression
on her face,

292
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:26,717
I believe that is she,
standing in the hallway.

293
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,783
I got a call
from douglas' department

294
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,451
At princeton general.

295
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:37,618
They want me
to interview with them.

296
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:38,950
Which is weird,
because when i called

297
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,817
Last week, they said
they had nothing available.

298
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:42,650
So i never sent in my resume.

299
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,984
Douglas owes me a favor.

300
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,750
Most people send chocolates.

301
00:12:46,817 --> 00:12:48,917
I'd stand outside your apartment
all night

302
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:50,184
Holding up a boom box,
except you told me

303
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:52,251
You hate '80s music.

304
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:02,950
I'm free tomorrow night.

306
00:13:25,184 --> 00:13:27,584
I was wondering
what that noise was.

307
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,950
It's the damn cane.

308
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,484
And i'm greg.

309
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:31,717
And i can't sleep

310
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:34,683
With you banging around
with that thing.

311
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,151
You're not actually saying

312
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,683
That i have too loud
a cane?

313
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,783
Is that hard
for you to understand?

314
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,683
Only in the sense that it has
a rubber tip on the end

315
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,084
And not a tap shoe.

316
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:45,984
Now you're getting cute
with me.

317
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,184
Okay, we started badly.

318
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:51,683
I apologize
for the noise,

319
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,817
And we will try to figure out
a way to be quieter--

320
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:56,251
And a thousand other things
i don't give a crap about.

321
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:57,917
Now you keep it down,

322
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,650
Or we're gonna have trouble.

00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:59,017
[shouts]
you all right?

361
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:00,618
Who is that man?

362
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:08,619
He shot him?

363
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
No.

364
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:16,918
<i>(chase)
you need a lawyer.</i>

365
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:19,651
You can get
a court-appointed.

366
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:20,851
They can help you.

367
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:23,284
I can't be helped.

368
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:27,184
You did a stupid,
terrible thing.

369
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,217
But given the circumstances
with your wife,

370
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:34,417
You could get
a reduced sentence.

371
00:16:34,484 --> 00:16:37,083
She wasn't my wife.

372
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,317
Then who was she?

373
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:43,950
They never told us
her name.

374
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:51,484
What his men made us do

375
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:54,818
To that woman...

376
00:16:54,884 --> 00:16:57,017
He is now going to do

377
00:16:57,083 --> 00:17:01,717
To all the sitibi.

378
00:17:03,918 --> 00:17:04,784
(cameron)
you could have gotten killed.

379
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:06,284
He wasn't going
to hurt me.

380
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,150
He fired a gun
in the hospital.

381
00:17:10,217 --> 00:17:12,017
Come here.

382
00:17:17,617 --> 00:17:19,484
Maybe next time
don't yell out that warning.

383
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:26,551
The bloody eye was
from an enlarged lymph node

384
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:27,717
Blocking the retinal vein.

385
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:29,584
We restored circulation,

386
00:17:29,651 --> 00:17:30,818
But it means we've got
to add lymph involvement

387
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,684
To the heart, lungs,
and rising fever.

388
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:36,851
I'm just gonna sit here
quietly.

389
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:39,050
Why?

390
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:40,918
I feel like i've been
inadvertently undermining

391
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:43,651
Your authority,
so i'm just gonna observe.

392
00:17:43,717 --> 00:17:46,983
Not gonna say a word.

393
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,384
The heart could point
to sarcoidosis.

394
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:50,317
[clears throat loudly]

395
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:58,617
I'm thinking
the x-rays indicate

396
00:17:58,684 --> 00:18:01,217
A lack of hilar adenopathy,

397
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:02,217
Which rules it out.

398
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,317
Staph aureus?

399
00:18:07,184 --> 00:18:08,651
<i>(chase)
no.</i>

400
00:18:08,717 --> 00:18:12,751
Because...

401
00:18:12,818 --> 00:18:14,217
He...

402
00:18:14,284 --> 00:18:17,150
Smokes?

403
00:18:17,217 --> 00:18:18,851
He's miming a thermometer.

404
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,050
He says the fever's
not high enough.

405
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:23,751
So some other infection.

406
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:24,617
<i>(foreman)
he's wrong.</i>

407
00:18:24,684 --> 00:18:25,751
The fever could be misleading us

408
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:28,451
Into thinking infection.

409
00:18:28,517 --> 00:18:29,884
Talk.

410
00:18:34,417 --> 00:18:35,983
It could all fit
with lymphoma.

411
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,250
Um, i need you to spread
your legs so i can do an h.

412
00:18:45,317 --> 00:18:47,684
Can't be lymphoma.

413
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,184
Ldh is normal.

414
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,950
He's got good liver function.

415
00:18:52,017 --> 00:18:53,950
It's masking
the elevated levels.

416
00:18:54,017 --> 00:18:58,451
Biopsy the lymph node.
check it out.

417
00:18:58,517 --> 00:19:00,117
Makes sense.

418
00:19:00,184 --> 00:19:02,918
I guess you don't need me.

419
00:19:04,784 --> 00:19:06,317
Oh, by the way,

420
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:08,083
You might want
to close the blinds.

421
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,250
A little bright in here.

422
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,017
It's just a wild coincidence
that he thought

423
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,184
You were a rude jerk.

424
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,884
Come on. give me
the benefit of the doubt.

425
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:25,551
You said he's a jerk.
i barely talked.

426
00:19:25,617 --> 00:19:26,983
You talked!

427
00:19:29,584 --> 00:19:32,551
All i wanted was to sip
morning espresso

428
00:19:32,617 --> 00:19:34,150
Next to a peaceful,
burbling fountain.

429
00:19:34,217 --> 00:19:37,451
You could be sipping courvoisier

430
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:39,150
Next to a replica
of the playboy grotto

431
00:19:39,217 --> 00:19:41,184
If you tell him
what you got on him.

432
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,651
I don't have anything
on him.

433
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,050
I don't want anything
on him.

434
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:46,250
The closest he's been
to vietnam?

435
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:49,784
Ordering the mee krob
at that place on the corner.

436
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:51,350
Mee krob
is from thailand.

437
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:52,717
Exactly.

438
00:19:52,784 --> 00:19:53,751
What did you do?

439
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,184
Why do you think he's faking?

440
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,050
I saw his mail.
your broke in?

441
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:58,950
No.
he was holding it.

442
00:19:59,017 --> 00:20:00,551
<i>private medical insurance.</i>

443
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,184
Not from the v.a.

444
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,584
Plus, he's got
to be early 50s.

445
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:06,684
He's too young
to be a vet.

446
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:07,784
So i looked further.

447
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:08,751
You did break in.

448
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:10,717
Online.

449
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:12,784
There's no reference to him
in any of the vet records.

450
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:14,751
Why would he fake
being a veteran?

451
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:16,717
Just look
how you're acting.

452
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:19,751
People have been tiptoeing
around this jerk for years.

453
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:23,050
Normally, we'd all tell
the amputee to go screw himself.

454
00:20:23,117 --> 00:20:24,584
Victims get pity,
heroes get adulation.

455
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:25,684
It's way better.

456
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:26,950
Thank you for trying
to help me out

457
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:27,950
With my neighbor.

458
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:28,918
Now forget the vietnam stuff.

459
00:20:28,983 --> 00:20:30,651
I could prove this.

460
00:20:30,717 --> 00:20:32,417
But you won't
because you'll be too busy

461
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:33,751
Writing him a letter
of apology

462
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:35,451
And dropping it
at his door

463
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,217
Without knocking
at his door.

464
00:20:38,284 --> 00:20:39,350
I dil ass.

465
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:40,551
Which is the point.

466
00:20:40,617 --> 00:20:43,250
It's easy to be nice
to people you like.

467
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:44,918
But being nice
to people you hate,

468
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:46,117
That's a skill.

469
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:47,983
Do it.

470
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,350
Thank you
for saving my life.

471
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,184
The man
that tried to kill you,

472
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,384
<i>he said that you were
preparing a massacre.</i>

473
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,384
The sitibi are my countrymen.

474
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:10,517
I am fighting
a guerilla war.

475
00:21:10,584 --> 00:21:12,983
In a way that's
being called genocide.

476
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,651
20 years ago,

477
00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:18,918
These same sitibi rebels
took over the south,

478
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:21,983
They massacred
tens of thousands,

479
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,117
And they would happily do it
again.

480
00:21:24,184 --> 00:21:27,217
I'm trying
to impose order.

481
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:30,751
I'm trying to prevent
a genocide.

482
00:21:30,818 --> 00:21:32,017
Genocide.

483
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:35,384
<i>my own son,</i>

484
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:36,651
My youngest,

485
00:21:36,717 --> 00:21:38,684
He is a student here.

486
00:21:38,751 --> 00:21:40,918
He hasn't spoken
to me in years

487
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:44,250
Because of what he read
in your newspapers.

488
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:46,484
But what he read
is not true.

489
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:48,451
What about
your youth labor league?

490
00:21:51,117 --> 00:21:54,350
[sighs]

491
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:59,983
There i was at fault.

492
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,451
I hired men, who,
in their zeal,

493
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:05,384
Stepped over the line,

494
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,983
And there were abuses.

495
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:13,784
But that will not happen again.

496
00:22:58,818 --> 00:23:01,117
Hello?

497
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:34,417
How's it going?

498
00:23:34,484 --> 00:23:36,184
Normal-looking nucleus.

499
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,818
How's it going
with you?

500
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:39,484
<i>it worried me
when you joked</i>

501
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:40,918
About letting
that man shoot dibala.

502
00:23:40,983 --> 00:23:43,784
I wasn't joking.

503
00:23:43,851 --> 00:23:45,417
You can't want
to kill anyone,

504
00:23:45,484 --> 00:23:46,851
Especially not
your own patient.

505
00:23:46,918 --> 00:23:48,818
It's only natural
to feel he should--

506
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:50,417
No, it's completely unnatural.

507
00:23:50,484 --> 00:23:52,417
Only psychopaths can kill
other people

508
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:53,717
<i>without having some sort
of breakdown.</i>

509
00:23:53,784 --> 00:23:55,083
Not when it's justified.
look at soldiers.

510
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,818
Even when it's justified.

511
00:23:56,884 --> 00:23:58,884
Am i trying
to kill our patient?

512
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,384
Of course not.

513
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:02,250
But if he died, am i supposed
to just pretend

514
00:24:02,317 --> 00:24:03,451
That wouldn't be good
for the world?

515
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:06,983
The cells
are neatly differentiated.

516
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,050
This isn't lymphoma.

517
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,517
<i>(house)
thought i had detected</i>

518
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:16,083
The sickly sweet smell
of maple syrup

519
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,284
And socialized medicine.

520
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,884
It smells like...

521
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,150
Victory.

522
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:24,584
That big flag
in your place

523
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:27,317
Prompted me to chat
with your housekeeper.

524
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,417
Turns out you're a citizen
of the great white north.

525
00:24:29,484 --> 00:24:31,017
You broke
into my apartment?

526
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,551
Technically, no.

527
00:24:32,617 --> 00:24:34,784
Well, technically, yeah,

528
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:36,050
But two steps.

529
00:24:36,117 --> 00:24:37,717
Hardly--
you're going to jail.

530
00:24:37,784 --> 00:24:39,117
Speaking of,

531
00:24:39,184 --> 00:24:40,017
You know what can get you
six months

532
00:24:40,083 --> 00:24:42,918
And a $100,000 fine?

533
00:24:42,983 --> 00:24:45,284
Falsely claiming that you won
a medal in vietnam.

534
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,083
You think i'm faking?

535
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,250
Canada did not send troops
to fight in vietnam, you idiot.

536
00:24:53,217 --> 00:24:57,884
They sent troops to reinforce
the '73 peace accords,

537
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,651
Which is where i tried
to free a 12-year-old boy

538
00:25:00,717 --> 00:25:02,551
Who stepped
on a land mine.

539
00:25:02,617 --> 00:25:05,417
36 years later, every second,
i feel the pain in my hand

540
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:07,217
Like i'm still grabbing
that boy's arm,

541
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:08,884
Even though my arm
isn't there.

542
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,451
So, no,
i'm not faking.

543
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:19,017
Oh.

544
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:20,684
On a related note,

545
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:22,685
Go maple leafs.

546
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:32,417
Did you get
the biopsy results?

547
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:34,051
Is it lymphoma?

548
00:25:34,052 --> 00:25:34,952
No.

549
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,684
So we have to move on.

550
00:25:36,751 --> 00:25:39,784
Infection,
perhaps autoimmune.

551
00:25:39,851 --> 00:25:41,051
Did you get the biopsy results?

552
00:25:41,118 --> 00:25:43,751
Yes, i just told you.

553
00:25:43,817 --> 00:25:46,118
Is it lymphoma?

554
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:51,684
Cameron and chase?

555
00:25:51,751 --> 00:25:53,717
They both really like
diagnostics,

556
00:25:53,784 --> 00:25:56,751
And i think they both really
like watching house torture me.

557
00:25:56,817 --> 00:25:59,317
Anyway, thank you
for understanding

558
00:25:59,383 --> 00:26:02,283
About the job.

559
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,383
I had two really
crappy alternatives.

560
00:26:08,084 --> 00:26:09,051
There was a third.

561
00:26:09,118 --> 00:26:10,350
What's that?

562
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:12,784
You could have stepped aside.

563
00:26:12,851 --> 00:26:15,817
We both would have lost
our jobs.

564
00:26:15,884 --> 00:26:18,484
You could have asked cameron
or chase to take your place.

565
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,751
They wouldn't have wanted to.

566
00:26:19,817 --> 00:26:21,817
You just said they both
really like diagnostics.

567
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,250
You want to go back
in time?

568
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:28,450
I want to make this work.

569
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:30,118
I want to understand you.

570
00:26:30,184 --> 00:26:34,717
I mean, you know
how you made me feel.

571
00:26:34,784 --> 00:26:36,250
If you could do it again...

572
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,118
I made
the right decision.

573
00:26:53,851 --> 00:26:57,417
I need your confidential
medical opinion.

574
00:26:57,484 --> 00:27:00,550
Is the president capable
of thinking clearly?

575
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:04,283
Obviously not,
right now.

576
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,118
Will he ever be?

577
00:27:06,184 --> 00:27:10,417
I think...

578
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:14,917
Neurons don't grow back,
and he's already in his decline.

579
00:27:14,984 --> 00:27:16,184
Anything he tells you,
any command he gives,

580
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,218
How will you ever know

581
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:18,684
It's not just the delusions

582
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:21,584
Of a sick, mad,
dying old man?

583
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,250
He just started
spiking a fever.

584
00:27:37,184 --> 00:27:39,450
It's scleroderma.

585
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:42,550
You don't have
some clever way

586
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:43,283
Of telling me
this time?

587
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,250
Patient's dying.

588
00:27:45,317 --> 00:27:46,283
I'm done with clever.

589
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,984
Look at his skin.

590
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:50,017
It's tight
for a 75-year-old.

591
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:51,283
Based on his admission photo?

592
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,717
Bit subjective.

593
00:27:52,784 --> 00:27:54,417
Fever points
to infection.

594
00:27:54,484 --> 00:27:55,784
And now he's got nodules
on his fingers.

595
00:27:55,851 --> 00:27:56,751
That's blastomycosis.

596
00:27:56,817 --> 00:27:58,417
Nodules?

597
00:27:58,484 --> 00:28:00,684
And you're calling tight skin
subjective?

598
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:02,051
<i>(chase)
i'm with foreman.</i>

599
00:28:02,118 --> 00:28:03,851
We would have seen
fungus balls on the head ct.

600
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:05,350
Fungal lesions
can be missed.

601
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,617
<i>(cameron)
we could settle this
with a test.</i>

602
00:28:08,684 --> 00:28:09,951
Point to,
not prove.

603
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:11,051
And his fever's too high.

604
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:12,283
We have to treat him now.

605
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,450
We treat wrong,

606
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:15,283
We could send this disease
into overdrive.

607
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,584
You're with me
on the scleroderma.

608
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,884
I guess.

609
00:28:17,951 --> 00:28:19,184
I just don't care enough
about the patient

610
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,317
To waste my time trying to
convince anyone.

611
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:21,751
We get it.
you don't like the guy,

612
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:22,517
You didn't want
to work on this case.

613
00:28:22,584 --> 00:28:24,584
And yet you're still here.

614
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,851
Why don't you take a stand?

615
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,151
Either do something about it
or shut up.

616
00:28:27,218 --> 00:28:29,617
Treat him for blasto
if you want.

617
00:28:30,851 --> 00:28:33,084
I'll get cuddy.
i can convince her--

618
00:28:33,151 --> 00:28:34,350
(foreman)
this isn't a democracy.

619
00:28:34,417 --> 00:28:35,817
I don't care
who you get.

620
00:28:35,884 --> 00:28:38,684
At least for right now,
this is my department.

621
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,317
We're treating him
for blasto.

622
00:28:40,383 --> 00:28:41,784
Start him
on amphotericin b.

623
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,350
If you inject my i.v.
with an air bubble...

624
00:28:54,417 --> 00:28:55,951
What are you doing?

625
00:28:56,017 --> 00:28:57,550
I will have
another heart attack.

626
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:58,550
No one will know.

627
00:28:58,617 --> 00:29:00,218
Let her go.

628
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:01,218
<i>you tell my colonel</i>

629
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:03,051
I'm a sick, dying old man

630
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:04,051
Who can't be trusted.

631
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,817
I didn't say...

632
00:29:05,884 --> 00:29:07,851
You were trying to put
a gun in his hand

633
00:29:07,917 --> 00:29:09,617
And point it
at my head.

634
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:11,951
The gun is now
in your hand.

635
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,851
That is a practical difference,
not a moral one.

636
00:29:14,917 --> 00:29:16,817
If you want me dead,
then pull the trigger.

637
00:29:19,084 --> 00:29:22,717
It is not so easy when you have
to do it yourself.

638
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,383
Allison.

639
00:29:49,317 --> 00:29:53,550
I guess
i didn't want you dead.

640
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:58,984
You touch my wife again,

641
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:01,283
I'll kick your ass out
into the street.

642
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,383
I don't care
who you are.

643
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:04,751
I did her a favor.

644
00:30:04,817 --> 00:30:06,684
I showed her
her true character.

645
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:09,484
She's a better person
than you are.

646
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,450
She is too weak to act
on her beliefs.

647
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:13,851
But that is not her fault.

648
00:30:13,917 --> 00:30:15,884
Most everyone is.

649
00:30:15,951 --> 00:30:18,250
Even my own advisors.

650
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,917
My own colonel.

651
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:24,383
All they do is negotiate
and debate

652
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:27,017
And sign treaties.

653
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:28,650
They are appeasers.

654
00:30:28,717 --> 00:30:31,250
And all the while,
we are beset by assassins

655
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:33,283
And traitors,
the scum--

656
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,517
Cockroaches?

657
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:39,383
What are you going
to do about them?

658
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:42,584
What is an enemy
to you?

659
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,951
Some younger physician
who covets your office?

660
00:30:47,017 --> 00:30:52,484
In my world, there are dangers
and bloodshed and death.

661
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,784
And that makes you a man.

662
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:57,283
And men make choices.

663
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,017
And your choice
is to send bands

664
00:31:00,084 --> 00:31:02,317
Of drunk, crazed children

665
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:03,984
To massacre
an entire people?

666
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:07,417
Don't ask me questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

667
00:31:07,484 --> 00:31:08,450
<i>i saved your life.</i>

668
00:31:08,517 --> 00:31:10,184
I deserve to know

669
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,450
What you're planning--

670
00:31:11,517 --> 00:31:13,151
Whatever it takes
to protect my country.

671
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:26,018
You broke
into his apartment?

672
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,550
I didn't break in.

673
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,250
I wish i believed you.

674
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:32,917
I can fix this.

675
00:31:32,984 --> 00:31:34,018
I already did.

676
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:36,951
He was going
to press charges.

677
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:38,951
<i>but...</i>

678
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:40,118
I promised him
you'd leave.

679
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:44,417
You're kicking me out?

680
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:47,517
I'll explain it
to your psychiatrist,

681
00:31:47,584 --> 00:31:49,651
But...yeah.

682
00:31:49,717 --> 00:31:53,617
You got to go somewhere else.

683
00:31:53,684 --> 00:31:54,784
<i>house, i know</i>

684
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:55,884
When things go wrong,

685
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:57,183
Usually you just double down

686
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,350
And get more involved,

687
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,084
But here you could go to jail.

688
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,150
<i>and i truly believe</i>

689
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:05,317
That you've changed enough

690
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:06,684
To know this is the right thing.

691
00:32:13,084 --> 00:32:15,250
We need a blood sample.

692
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:18,051
We got to do the anticentromere
antibody test.

693
00:32:18,118 --> 00:32:20,417
It'll show house is right.
it's scleroderma.

694
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:26,183
Why are you doing this now?

695
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,250
And you're right.

696
00:32:28,317 --> 00:32:30,118
I have to take a side.

697
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,717
So i'm going to do what i can
to keep him alive.

698
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:37,884
I'll get you the blood.

699
00:32:37,951 --> 00:32:39,450
<i>positive</i>

700
00:32:39,517 --> 00:32:41,018
For anticentromere antibodies.

701
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,651
Better get him
off the antifungals

702
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:44,118
And onto steroids
immediately.

703
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:45,484
I told you before,

704
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,617
This only points
to scleroderma.

705
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:47,651
It doesn't prove it.

706
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,317
You're just gonna ignore
the test?

707
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,550
Blasto still fits best.

708
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:52,851
I know
it's not conclusive,

709
00:32:52,917 --> 00:32:53,917
But when you put it
with all the other evidence--

710
00:32:53,984 --> 00:32:55,784
I've made
my decision.

711
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:05,118
Have you told thirteen
you were wrong to fire her?

712
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,150
What does that have to do
with anything?

713
00:33:07,217 --> 00:33:10,051
I've worked with you
long enough to know

714
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:11,484
You're reasonable.

715
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,317
You can usually admit
when you're wrong.

716
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:16,584
But there's some deep part
of you,

717
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:18,018
That when you find you're wrong

718
00:33:18,084 --> 00:33:20,584
About the most important
