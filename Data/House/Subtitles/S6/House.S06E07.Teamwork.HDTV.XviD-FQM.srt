1
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,665
This bagel's as hard
as a hockey puck.

2
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:09,733
Then don't eat it.

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,934
Used to be a full
breakfast service.

4
00:00:11,002 --> 00:00:12,369
They're trying
to starve us.

5
00:00:12,437 --> 00:00:14,171
You're worried
about the food?

6
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,473
No, I'm worried about
what the food represents.

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:18,041
I got seven scenes
to shoot today

8
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:19,810
on half of what
we used to spend.

9
00:00:19,877 --> 00:00:20,977
We're going
through a recession.

10
00:00:21,045 --> 00:00:22,112
It is what it is.

11
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,714
But nobody's
gonna bail us out.

12
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,017
Free content everywhere,
DVD sales in the toilet.

13
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,719
Now the back office
bean counters

14
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,353
are vetoing
half my ideas.

15
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:33,657
So we begin to make it
about the performances.

16
00:00:34,025 --> 00:00:34,791
You okay?

17
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,426
A bit of a headache.

18
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,661
If you need
an ibuprofen--

19
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:39,296
I need you to put your
game face on, all right?

20
00:00:39,363 --> 00:00:41,665
Screw the bagels, screw
the sets, screw the wardrobe.

21
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,734
Do you have any idea
how lucky we are?

22
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,235
We get to do
something we like,

23
00:00:45,303 --> 00:00:48,672
we get to touch people's lives
and we get paid for it?

24
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,507
Let's make a movie!

25
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:51,875
Hey, baby.

26
00:00:57,849 --> 00:01:00,550
Roll camera!

27
00:01:00,918 --> 00:01:03,353
And...

28
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:06,289
Action.

29
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:11,061
Argh...

30
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,896
<i>What's wrong?</i>

31
00:01:12,964 --> 00:01:13,930
Ah...

32
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,098
My eyes...

33
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:18,301
They feel like
they're exploding.

34
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,837
All right, turn off
the damn lights.

35
00:01:20,905 --> 00:01:24,141
Get an ambulance.
Now!

37
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,879
We're gonna be
late for work.

38
00:02:02,946 --> 00:02:06,685
Then we'll be late.

39
00:02:08,552 --> 00:02:11,388
You took a patient's life.
You lied about it for weeks.

40
00:02:11,455 --> 00:02:13,523
<i>You broke who knows
how many laws and oaths</i>

41
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,591
<i>to cover it up,</i>

42
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:19,229
but I can live with it.

43
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:25,368
We can get through it
together.

44
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,138
You have no idea what
I've been living with,

45
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:30,606
and what it means
to hear you say that.

46
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:36,446
But we need to get away
from Princeton-Plainsboro.

47
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:39,982
You can barely walk by the rooms
where Dibala was treated.

48
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:43,986
<i>Why should we live with that
hanging over our heads?</i>

49
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:48,524
If there was ever a time
to turn the page...

50
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,966
Three-month-old with fever,
incessant drooling,

51
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,234
and chronic
muscle weakness.

52
00:02:57,301 --> 00:02:58,569
Or...

53
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:02,572
Porn actor Hank Hardwick,
born Henry Lefkowitz,

54
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,274
totally clean workup,

55
00:03:04,342 --> 00:03:06,243
collapsed on the job
with extreme photophobia.

56
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,544
Or...

57
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:08,512
<i>An infant as limp
as a rag doll.</i>

58
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,047
Yeah. Let's wait till
Chase and Cameron get here.

59
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,983
I have a feeling they'll have
the good sense to side with me.

60
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,117
Doesn't matter
who they side with,

61
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:15,218
I'm still in charge.

62
00:03:15,286 --> 00:03:17,687
We're taking the limp
three-month-old.

63
00:03:17,955 --> 00:03:18,789
Oh, good!

64
00:03:18,857 --> 00:03:22,959
You paged the limpness
specialist.

65
00:03:26,797 --> 00:03:30,600
This envelope is oddly
medical license-shaped.

66
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:33,703
Congratulations.

67
00:03:37,108 --> 00:03:38,675
<i>House is back
in charge.</i>

68
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:40,877
We get to treat
a porn star.

69
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:42,012
Congratulations.

70
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,880
Perfect timing for us.

71
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:45,282
We're leaving the team

72
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:48,451
<i>and the hospital,
effective immediately.</i>

73
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:51,354
That's kind of sudden.

74
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:52,956
Unless you've been circulating
your resumes for a while.

75
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:55,225
We're just starting
to think about new jobs,

76
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:56,693
where we want to live.

77
00:03:56,761 --> 00:03:58,595
Moving too... 
Interesting.

78
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:00,897
Are you sure about this?

79
00:04:02,065 --> 00:04:03,967
Yes.

80
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,002
Uh...
We'll miss you.

81
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,004
We'll miss
all of you too.

82
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:10,173
<i>We'll start clearing
out our things.</i>

83
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:17,747
<i>Run an S.T.D. panel
and a tox screen.</i>

84
00:04:18,014 --> 00:04:20,183
<i>Send a C-reactive protein
to look for inflammation</i>

85
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:22,252
and an A.N.A. to screen
for autoimmune.

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,287
The rest of you
take a history

87
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,489
and do an L.P to rule out
viral encephalitis.

88
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:30,160
Oh, it's just you!

89
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:34,898
Here's hoping you're
good at multitasking.

90
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:38,669
I get tested for S.T.D.s regularly,
so does everyone I work with.

91
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,904
Since I'm guessing you don't
take their word for it.

92
00:04:41,472 --> 00:04:44,574
All right, I'm gonna need you to
lie on your side

93
00:04:44,642 --> 00:04:47,078
<i>and put your knees
to your chest.</i>

94
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:49,446
Any history of alcohol
or substance abuse?

95
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:51,147
My wife used to
smoke a little pot,

96
00:04:51,215 --> 00:04:53,516
but I never
touched the stuff.

97
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,085
You're married.

98
00:04:55,152 --> 00:04:57,320
Happily,
for two years now.

99
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:58,722
Is she happy you do porn?

100
00:04:59,689 --> 00:05:01,992
Very, since she
does it too.

101
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:03,426
Hmm.

102
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:05,928
You ever get jealous
when your wife's working?

103
00:05:06,396 --> 00:05:07,897
It's a job.

104
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:09,532
Once you start
letting your work life

105
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,334
<i>rule your home life,</i>

106
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:12,469
<i>especially if you're
in the same line of work,</i>

107
00:05:12,536 --> 00:05:14,204
your relationship's
gonna be short.

108
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,005
<i>You're gonna feel
a little pressure.</i>

109
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:18,074
Any history
of sexual abuse?

110
00:05:18,142 --> 00:05:19,442
I defy the cliche.

111
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,312
Have you ever suffered
depression or psychosis?

112
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Let me save you
some time.

113
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,348
There's not a blotch
on my medical record.

114
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:26,449
<i>Look...</i>

115
00:05:26,517 --> 00:05:28,418
I know most of
the people in my field

116
00:05:28,486 --> 00:05:30,687
are drug addicts
with daddy issues,

117
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,922
but I'm a nice,
Jewish boy from the 'burbs.

118
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,990
I wasn't driven to this.

119
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:37,627
I chose it.
I believe in it.

120
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,329
I actually
think it's--oh!

121
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:41,798
My arms are killing me!

122
00:05:41,866 --> 00:05:43,933
Looks like tetany.
Your muscles are contracting.

123
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,268
Need some
meperidine in here.

124
00:05:45,336 --> 00:05:47,337
Oh, god!

125
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:52,008
Jew with megalophallus,
photophobia, and muscle spasm.

126
00:05:52,076 --> 00:05:56,413
You tell me which
is the most unusual.

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,681
<i>Four candidates,
three slots on the team.</i>

128
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:01,484
Need to know if you've still
got your diagnostic chops.

129
00:06:01,552 --> 00:06:03,853
I leave this office
by 6:00 every day,

130
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,422
I have my weekends again,

131
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,589
<i>I recognize
my wife again.</i>

132
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,525
Yeah, I agree.
Does sound pretty dull.

133
00:06:08,592 --> 00:06:09,526
No wonder you want
to work for me.

134
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:11,294
<i>Tox screen was clean.</i>

135
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:15,565
We ruled out
viral encephalitis.

136
00:06:18,535 --> 00:06:22,138
The only obstacle to you
coming back is your wife.

137
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:27,944
Which has never been that much
of an obstacle to you.

138
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:32,916
Maybe you're right.

139
00:06:34,283 --> 00:06:37,353
The only link between eye
and muscle is the brain.

140
00:06:37,721 --> 00:06:42,826
Tumor, seizure...

141
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:45,962
Taub seems to think
the link has to be the brain,

142
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,164
but eye and muscle are
governed by different parts

143
00:06:48,232 --> 00:06:50,066
of the patient's
second-favorite organ.

144
00:06:50,734 --> 00:06:53,269
Which means it's...

145
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:55,805
Thailand was wonderful.
Thanks for asking.

146
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,675
Of course! Yes!
It has to be multifocal.

147
00:06:58,743 --> 00:06:59,510
I have an interview

148
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:01,277
with a community health clinic
in two hours.

149
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:02,745
Back-up plan's fine.

150
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,514
Taub's swinging
for the fences.

151
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:05,782
I suggest you don't
divide your attention.

152
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:06,783
Good point.

153
00:07:06,851 --> 00:07:09,686
I won't divide
my attention, then.

154
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,554
<i>Taub thinks it's
a brain issue,</i>

155
00:07:11,622 --> 00:07:13,189
<i>Thirteen thinks
it's multifocal.</i>

156
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:14,591
And neither of them
wants to work here.

157
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:16,292
Don't take
their word for it.

158
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,795
Taub's problem is his wife,
Thirteen's problem is you.

159
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:21,798
Chase and Cameron's problem
is the dead African dictator.

160
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:25,034
None of them has
a problem with the work.

161
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:26,536
Cerebral vasculitis
would explain

162
00:07:26,604 --> 00:07:28,138
both the eye
and arm findings.

163
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:31,274
Steroids to treat,
brain angiogram to confirm,

164
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:32,976
E.M.G. and nerve biopsy
while you're at it.

165
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:35,646
I'll be at lunch.

166
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:37,580
I'd hire all four,

167
00:07:37,648 --> 00:07:40,817
but a five-person team
seems unwieldy.

168
00:07:40,885 --> 00:07:41,985
Who would you turn down?

169
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,588
I'll have whatever
he's buying.

170
00:07:45,656 --> 00:07:48,625
Two cheeseburgers
and two large fries.

171
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:50,226
There are a thousand people
in the world

172
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:51,794
who want to be
on your staff,

173
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:53,563
but you're going after
the four who don't.

174
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:55,665
They don't because
their lives

175
00:07:56,033 --> 00:07:58,067
are irrelevantly
and annoyingly complicated,

176
00:07:58,535 --> 00:07:59,335
which makes
them confused,

177
00:07:59,403 --> 00:08:01,371
which makes them
make poor decisions.

178
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:02,939
And your life is simple?

179
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:04,574
You went all the way up
to the medical conference

180
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,142
to cozy up to Cuddy.

181
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,044
Instead she's dating
one of two people in the world

182
00:08:08,412 --> 00:08:09,479
you think of as a friend.

183
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:11,481
There's no way that's
not devastating.

184
00:08:11,549 --> 00:08:13,583
So I had an
attraction of sorts.

185
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:16,352
Yeah, the sort in which
your imaginary tryst

186
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,755
landed you
in a mental hospital.

187
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:19,989
And I got help.

188
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:23,092
And she got Lucas,
who bought me a ginger ale.

189
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,928
It's all fine.

190
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:26,329
Which won't be true
of my department

191
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:29,899
unless I can figure out
which doctor I'm not hiring.

192
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,935
I suppose throwing
yourself into your work

193
00:08:32,002 --> 00:08:34,721
isn't the worst thing
you could do.

194
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:39,259
What is the worst thing
I could do?

195
00:08:39,327 --> 00:08:41,060
House thinks it's
cerebral vasculitis.

196
00:08:41,128 --> 00:08:42,595
If you could just
do the brain angio

197
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:43,563
while I finish up
the blood work--

198
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:44,931
we're out the door.

199
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,766
He's got me running every test
and treatment by myself.

200
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,701
Which is why you should
be out the door too.

201
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,972
This is completely unreasonable,
even for House.

202
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,408
You owe me this.

203
00:09:00,814 --> 00:09:02,282
Thank you.

204
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,751
You really believe this is
cerebral vasculitis?

205
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:07,153
Could be.

206
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,956
House wants to thread
a catheter through his brain,

207
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:10,990
which could cause
a vasospasm,

208
00:09:11,058 --> 00:09:12,325
give steroids,

209
00:09:12,393 --> 00:09:13,493
which could spread infection
all over the place,

210
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,460
because it could be.

211
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,496
Sounds like House.

212
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:18,765
It could also be a severe
Vitamin D deficiency.

213
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:21,935
He eats a restricted diet,
works long hours indoors,

214
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:25,705
became hypocalcemic,
got tetany and photophobia.

215
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,973
Are you saying
I shouldn't do the angio?

216
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,708
House ordered it,
Foreman wants it,

217
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,609
of course
we should do it.

218
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:30,977
I'm just saying
we're right to leave.

219
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:32,812
You sure?

220
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,315
Because right now I'll basically
do anything you ask me.

221
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,550
I'm not interested
in guilting you.

222
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:41,120
We're moving on.

223
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:44,424
Right after I take the patient
to the phototherapy suite,

224
00:09:44,491 --> 00:09:45,758
blast him
in ultraviolet light,

225
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:49,762
and IV vitamins for his
severe Vitamin D deficiency.

226
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,033
So do you guys
actually work together?

227
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:56,135
We did at first,

228
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:58,504
but now we like to keep
our films produced separate.

229
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:01,407
So do you, uh,
watch her work?

230
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,209
We're both busy
with our own stuff.

231
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:05,411
<i>Think what you want,</i>

232
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:07,180
but we're proud
of what we do.

233
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:09,582
Divorcing sex from
all emotional content?

234
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,151
Emotion is emotional.
Sex is mechanical.

235
00:10:12,219 --> 00:10:14,687
There doesn't really
need to be any overlap.

236
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:15,989
Certainly not
in your world.

237
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,992
We've helped
a lot of couples

238
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:21,361
by taking sex out
of some deep, dark dungeon.

239
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:22,829
<i>Do what you want</i>

240
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,465
without some big,
moral comeuppance.

241
00:10:25,532 --> 00:10:29,135
You think you can escape
the consequences, but you can't.

242
00:10:29,903 --> 00:10:31,904
You don't get to make
your own rules or morals.

243
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:33,909
Well, you're here to treat him,

244
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,210
not lecture us about our...

245
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:36,911
Hank!

246
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:38,778
Are you all right?

247
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,815
<i>Are you okay?
Just a nosebleed.</i>

248
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:47,588
Inside his leg?

249
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:49,522
Petechial hemorrhages.

250
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,358
We were wrong.
So was Foreman.

251
00:10:55,044 --> 00:10:56,145
<i>Patient's blood
won't clot.</i>

252
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:57,312
We're back to square one.

253
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,413
And you're back
in my office.

254
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:00,649
So much for playing
hard to get.

255
00:11:00,717 --> 00:11:02,117
We're just here
to help Foreman.

256
00:11:03,686 --> 00:11:04,353
Is that--

257
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,489
He's not without talent.

258
00:11:06,556 --> 00:11:08,524
U.V. rays made the patient's
capillaries more fragile,

259
00:11:08,991 --> 00:11:09,958
hastening
the onset of D.I.C.

260
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:11,093
Sounds like sepsis--

261
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:12,694
but isn't.
No sign of shock.

262
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:14,930
No drop in
blood pressure.
Can we turn that off?

263
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,232
Right, 'cause Cameron
thinks pornography is evil.

264
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,868
I don't care what he does.
I don't care what you watch.

265
00:11:20,336 --> 00:11:21,737
<i>I just think it's annoying
that he pretends</i>

266
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,972
it's some beautiful life
we should all be aspiring to.

267
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:26,675
Left shift points
to bacteremia.

268
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:28,377
No fever.

269
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:30,512
<i>Plus it wouldn't explain his
spasmodic muscle contractions.</i>

270
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,782
The ball and chain
smacked you down.

271
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,917
<i>But, widespread
petechial rash,</i>

272
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:38,587
nervous system
involvement.

273
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:40,522
It's... some kind
of blood infection.

274
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,457
Meningococcemia.

275
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,661
Start the patient
on Heparin for the D.I.C.

276
00:11:45,729 --> 00:11:48,130
<i>Broad-spectrum antibiotics
for the meningococcemia.</i>

277
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:51,867
Dr. Cameron.

278
00:11:53,135 --> 00:11:56,838
Chase is relaxed, at ease,
in lockstep with you again.

279
00:11:57,106 --> 00:11:59,374
I guess he finally told you
that he "iced" Idi Amin Jr.

280
00:12:00,242 --> 00:12:00,976
<i>Does that mean
he can break</i>

281
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:02,978
<i>the other nine
commandments too?</i>

282
00:12:03,046 --> 00:12:04,547
Taking the lord's
name in vain, sure,

283
00:12:04,614 --> 00:12:06,381
but coveting
thy neighbor's wife?

284
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:07,982
Is she hot?

285
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,518
I've forgiven him.

286
00:12:10,986 --> 00:12:12,220
Not for murder.
Not you.

287
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:14,723
<i>Doesn't matter
how evil Dibala was.</i>

288
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,158
By every
conscience-hugging,

289
00:12:16,626 --> 00:12:18,193
Mother Teresa-loving
bone in your body,

290
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:20,329
you should be leaving him,
not leaving with him.

291
00:12:20,396 --> 00:12:22,931
I thought your position
was our leaving is a ruse.

292
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:23,966
We're not talking
about my position.

293
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,400
We're talking about yours,
which doesn't add up.

294
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,769
Here's what
doesn't add up.

295
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,137
If you were serious
about staffing your team,

296
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,372
you would know exactly
which three fellows you wanted.

297
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:32,507
<i>You plowed ahead
with this case,</i>

298
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,175
<i>even though you hadn't
hired new fellows</i>

299
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:36,345
because you knew Foreman
would ask Chase and me to help.

300
00:12:36,912 --> 00:12:39,147
Giving you more time
to blow up our marriage.

301
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:40,716
I don't want that.

302
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:42,384
But we'd be foolish
not to plan ahead.

303
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:47,690
<i>A: My firing Chase was the only
reason you left two years ago,</i>

304
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:50,392
B: When the full horror
of his homicide hits you,

305
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,860
your marriage
will blow up.

306
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:53,629
And Z...

307
00:12:53,996 --> 00:12:57,466
The only obstacle to you
working here will be gone.

308
00:12:58,634 --> 00:13:02,838
Or maybe I skipped
a couple of letters.

309
00:13:04,974 --> 00:13:07,476
Meningococcemia's
spread person-to-person.

310
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:08,811
Something you
ought to think about

311
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:10,946
next time you
show up for work.

312
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:13,982
It's okay.
Your wife's not here.

313
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,084
I'm just
telling you what--

314
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:18,787
you have to lecture me
when she's around, I get it.

315
00:13:19,155 --> 00:13:21,089
But I can tell from all
the questions you ask

316
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:22,691
that you're more like me
than you admit.

317
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:25,027
I'm a guy.

318
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,729
I look around every once
in a while, but I love my wife.

319
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,231
I love the fact
that she's the only one

320
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:31,065
that I'm intimate with.

321
00:13:30,833 --> 00:13:32,668
And no part of you
wants to just

322
00:13:33,036 --> 00:13:35,504
toss this rule book
everyone's forced on you?

323
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:38,674
No part of you wants a life
of actual commitment?

324
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:42,144
Is my relationship
perfect? No.

325
00:13:42,812 --> 00:13:45,947
Am I ever horny when my wife
has just had sex for nine hours?

326
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:48,250
Yes.

327
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,385
But we are committed
to each other,

328
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:51,220
in every way
that matters.

329
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,021
In other words
you're committed,

330
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:55,123
except when you're
not committed.

331
00:13:55,491 --> 00:13:57,326
Doesn't work so well
if you have a conscience.

332
00:13:57,993 --> 00:13:59,528
Conscience.

333
00:13:59,996 --> 00:14:00,896
You mean that thing
that kicks in

334
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:02,831
when there's no logical
reason to behave

335
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:05,067
the way people
want you to?

336
00:14:07,436 --> 00:14:08,503
<i>What?</i>

337
00:14:08,671 --> 00:14:10,472
You have a fever.

338
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,543
Means the antibiotics
aren't working.

339
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:17,512
Mr. Takayama.

340
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,681
Yes!

341
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:21,850
I'm really happy with what
the last guy did with my eyes.

342
00:14:22,418 --> 00:14:24,086
<i>But why would
broad-spectrum antibiotics</i>

343
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:26,955
fail to work on
meningococcemia?

344
00:14:27,023 --> 00:14:28,423
If you'll excuse me,
I've got a real patient.

345
00:14:28,891 --> 00:14:31,893
Mister...

346
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,694
Hitler.

347
00:14:32,761 --> 00:14:33,562
Really.

348
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,964
Had to do something to amuse
myself while your receptionist

349
00:14:36,032 --> 00:14:37,232
<i>fought with
her boyfriend.
Who's next?</i>

350
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,168
A guy who needs

351
00:14:39,235 --> 00:14:41,370
two decades' worth of corn chips
hoovered out of his neck,

352
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:43,705
<i>or a guy who can't
stand daylight,</i>

353
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,007
and whose blood
won't clot.

354
00:14:45,774 --> 00:14:46,675
You do the triage.

355
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:48,176
Who's the jerk?

356
00:14:48,244 --> 00:14:50,212
Someone with zero chance
of hiring me back.

357
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
I told you.

358
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:54,416
I'm content at home
and at work.

359
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,518
But you're not
content with content.

360
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,186
<i>That's why you got sucked
into those stock scams,</i>

361
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:00,122
why you cheated
on the wife you love.

362
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:03,091
At bridge.

363
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,328
My wife and I play
a lot of bridge.

364
00:15:06,396 --> 00:15:07,596
Why you worked on a case
last time I was here.

365
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:08,363
I gave you a theory.

366
00:15:08,431 --> 00:15:09,598
Just like I'd help
a guy who needs

367
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,400
a Heimlich
in a restaurant.

368
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:13,602
<i>And then I shut
the door behind you.</i>

369
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,570
But you'd knock over three other
doctors to give it to him.

370
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:16,705
Metaphorically speaking,

371
00:15:16,772 --> 00:15:17,506
you're a Heimlich addict.

372
00:15:17,573 --> 00:15:18,774
And you're an
addiction addict.

373
00:15:18,841 --> 00:15:20,442
Right now your drug
of choice is your old team,

374
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,177
and like any addict
you're trying to solve

375
00:15:22,245 --> 00:15:23,378
some other problem
and it's not gonna work.

376
00:15:23,446 --> 00:15:25,113
If you'll excuse me,
I have a--

377
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:27,883
you have a tight schedule
of nose jobs and tummy tucks.

378
00:15:27,951 --> 00:15:29,284
Yes. I do nose jobs.

379
00:15:29,352 --> 00:15:30,786
Just like the guy who
came here after a car crash,

380
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:36,792
couldn't even
breathe... through... his...

381
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:40,528
Antibiotics wouldn't
work if his sinuses

382
00:15:40,796 --> 00:15:41,630
were infected
and clogged

383
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:43,698
if there was
a pocket of bacteria

384
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:45,767
his blood vessels
couldn't reach.

385
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,537
You surgically drain his
sinuses, the drugs will work.

386
00:15:50,504 --> 00:15:52,240
Nice.

387
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:53,675
Tell me that
didn't feel good.

388
00:15:55,443 --> 00:15:57,746
See you tomorrow!

389
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:01,283
Not coming back.

390
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:11,362
Looks like quite a trip.

391
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,963
It was.

392
00:16:16,631 --> 00:16:17,899
House send you
to talk to me?

393
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:18,967
No.

394
00:16:19,234 --> 00:16:20,602
Then there's nothing
to talk about.

395
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,105
I don't want
to work for him.

396
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,675
You're a great doctor.

397
00:16:26,743 --> 00:16:29,311
House is right
to want you in the mix.

398
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,146
Are you saying this because
you still have feelings for me

399
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:32,547
and you want me
to come back?

400
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:34,982
I'm saying that
shouldn't be an issue.

401
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,518
Do you have feelings
for me or not?

402
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:39,454
I don't want our work life

403
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,556
to have anything to do
with our personal life.

404
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:42,924
You couldn't
keep them separate.

405
00:16:43,592 --> 00:16:47,029
And that's why
our personal life doesn't exist.

406
00:16:47,096 --> 00:16:48,830
None of that has to--

407
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:51,199
I can't work with you.

408
00:16:52,967 --> 00:16:54,837
Actually, you can.

409
00:16:55,604 --> 00:16:58,106
I was the one
who had the problem.

410
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:02,146
I don't anymore.

411
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,918
<i>I owe you an apology.</i>

412
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:12,787
I was wr-rr-r...

413
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:14,689
I was wrr-r-rr...

414
00:17:15,057 --> 00:17:16,925
What were you
wrong about?

415
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:21,663
You spent weeks elaborately
concealing the fact that you...

416
00:17:21,731 --> 00:17:23,598
Crashed daddy's car.

417
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,600
<i>and then you
just confessed.</i>

418
00:17:25,668 --> 00:17:29,304
<i>seemed idiotic.
Certain to end in disaster.</i>

419
00:17:29,372 --> 00:17:31,606
<i>instead you're riding off
into the sunset together.</i>

420
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:33,075
Any theories on why?

421
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:34,509
<i>I assume you've already</i>

422
00:17:34,777 --> 00:17:36,044
dismissed the
"she loves me" theory?

423
00:17:36,612 --> 00:17:38,547
Well, it's possible.

424
00:17:38,814 --> 00:17:40,549
It would require
the presupposition

425
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:41,950
that everything she's done
for the last six years

426
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,985
has been completely inconsistent
with her character,

427
00:17:44,153 --> 00:17:45,587
but yeah, it's possible.

428
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:46,855
<i>And as we've
already established,</i>

429
00:17:46,923 --> 00:17:49,091
it's also possible
that you're wrong.

430
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:51,526
Or there's
another explanation.

431
00:17:51,594 --> 00:17:54,029
Since you don't have one,
I'm gonna keep looking for you.

432
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:02,838
Let him drain, then pack it with
anesthetics and sterile gauze.

433
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:06,441
Do you have any idea
what's going on with House?

434
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:09,277
Uh, he's trying to get
his old fellas back?

435
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,313
It's called stalking.

436
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,915
I am way too busy to play
officer of the court.

437
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,486
That's a shame, since you're
the one who triggered this.

438
00:18:18,253 --> 00:18:20,322
What do you see
in Lucas anyway?

439
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:21,690
I don't see that it's
any of your business.

440
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:23,758
Did you think House
wouldn't find out?

441
00:18:23,826 --> 00:18:25,560
You could've at least told me
so I wouldn't have coached him

442
00:18:25,628 --> 00:18:27,396
on how to prove
his worthiness to you.

443
00:18:27,464 --> 00:18:28,597
I know you're
upset with me

444
00:18:28,665 --> 00:18:31,233
because I didn't choose
to date your best friend.

445
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,069
But I'm living my life.

446
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:36,238
And for the first time
I'm not gonna change that

447
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:42,110
because of how it might
affect him or you.

448
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:50,218
I feel like crap.

449
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:53,188
Yeah, look, our relationship
is gonna be about House,

450
00:18:53,656 --> 00:18:56,024
or it's gonna
be about us.

451
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:57,359
I vote for it
being about us.

452
00:18:57,426 --> 00:19:00,195
Well, House is gonna
make it about him for us.

453
00:19:00,263 --> 00:19:02,264
This is very insulting.

454
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:03,765
You're apparently
shocked by this,

455
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,267
which means that you
thought that there

456
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:07,235
was some way
that we could date,

457
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:09,804
get married,
have two kids, a dog,

458
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:12,140
retire to Florida,
all without House finding out.

459
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:16,011
Or... you thought that
we wouldn't date all that long.

460
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:18,446
First means
you're delusional.

461
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:20,048
The second means
I'm delusional.

462
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:21,783
Technically
it could also mean

463
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,351
you thought House
had matured,

464
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:25,219
but then we're back
to your being--

465
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:27,622
Shut up.

466
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:30,191
You're right.
I'm sorry.

467
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,460
I'm also flattered.

468
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:34,863
Yeah, 'cause you acted all cool
and everything with Wilson,

469
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:38,199
but you feel comfortable enough
with me that you can freak out.

470
00:19:38,267 --> 00:19:41,436
That's cool.

471
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:47,975
<i>His sinuses are clear.</i>

472
00:19:48,243 --> 00:19:51,312
Antibiotics should
work this time.

473
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,582
Why did you forgive me?

474
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,853
I mean, I'm--I'm glad.
I'm grateful, but I'm confused.

475
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:00,054
You've been harder
on the patient

476
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:01,322
than you've been on me.

477
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:03,791
Well, the difference
between you and the patient

478
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:05,793
is that you feel shame.

479
00:20:06,461 --> 00:20:07,662
Guilt.

480
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:09,897
That's how I know
we're gonna get through this.

481
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:17,338
Oh... my stomach.

482
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:18,606
<i>Oh... it really hurts.</i>

483
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:22,741
His liver is failing.

484
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,983
His liver's failing
and his abdomen

485
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,584
keeps filling
with fluid, so--

486
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:29,919
it's not meningococcemia.

487
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:33,388
No matter how much you finish
each other's sentences,

488
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:36,325
don't count on being
a diagnostic package deal.

489
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:37,860
Patient's liver's
not working.

490
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,995
We don't have time
for your little team-stakes.

491
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:43,432
Sometimes you're
just wr-rr-r-wrong.

492
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,268
<i>Something genetic,</i>

493
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:47,369
Something in his
family history we overlooked?

494
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:48,637
History and genetics
are spotless.

495
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,338
Plus every time he had
a bad cough as a kid

496
00:20:50,406 --> 00:20:51,006
he went to a doctor.

497
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:53,075
Klatskin tumor obstructing
his bile ducts?

498
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:54,843
No jaundice.
Wouldn't have ocular effects.

499
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:57,346
<i>but if it's inflammation
inside the bile channels,</i>

500
00:20:57,413 --> 00:20:58,681
sclerosing cholangitis.

501
00:20:58,748 --> 00:20:59,749
<i>could've stopped
him from producing</i>

502
00:20:59,816 --> 00:21:01,650
clotting proteins,
damaged his blood cells,

503
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,018
<i>causing small strokes.
Enough!</i>

504
00:21:03,086 --> 00:21:04,353
Enough!

505
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,690
Stop pummeling
Thirteen and Taub.

506
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:10,492
It fits.

507
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,328
Prep the patient
for an E.R.C.P.

508
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,429
See if there's any hope
of opening

509
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:14,531
his blocked
bile channels.

510
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:18,767
And tell him to start looking
for a liver donor.

511
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:21,270
Dr. Chase.

512
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:23,839
Your turn.

513
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,841
So what'd she say?

514
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:29,845
She forgave me
because... I feel guilty.

515
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:31,580
That works too.

516
00:21:31,648 --> 00:21:34,583
And now you expect me to ask you
what the "too" refers to.

517
00:21:34,651 --> 00:21:36,952
Only if you're
interested.

518
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,790
Only if you have doubts
about her answer.

519
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,560
She thinks that you don't have
anything to feel guilty about,

520
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:46,161
because you didn't
kill anybody.

521
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:48,730
I did.

522
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:50,866
She blames me
for Dibala's murder, not you.

523
00:21:51,334 --> 00:21:53,202
You were barely involved
in that case. She knows that.

524
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:55,904
Yeah but I created
the big, bad, evil climate

525
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:57,105
that allowed it to happen.

526
00:21:58,073 --> 00:21:58,974
You're wrong.

527
00:21:59,842 --> 00:22:01,109
Powerful
counter-argument.

528
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:02,244
Why are you doing this?

529
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,079
Why are you trying
to screw things up?

530
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:07,349
You got the tense wrong.

531
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:08,784
Things are already
screwed up.

532
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,952
Which is why you don't just
want to work for me,

533
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,354
you need to.

534
00:22:12,422 --> 00:22:14,289
Cameron thinks you're
my personal sock puppet.

535
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:18,093
If you don't stay, it's gonna be
hard to prove you're not.

536
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:19,728
I have to go.

537
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:36,478
Last week, my cane could
only do ten minutes.

538
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,849
What are you doing here?

539
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:44,388
Waiting for you to take a nap
so I can surge into the lead.

540
00:22:48,456 --> 00:22:50,894
What's the best way
to restore the liver in someone

541
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,595
<i>with sclerosing
cholangitis?</i>

542
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,829
Not getting
drawn into this.

543
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:55,163
You already are.

544
00:22:55,231 --> 00:22:56,665
Because you crashed
my workout?

545
00:22:56,733 --> 00:22:57,766
You're doing
core training.

546
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,101
Which improves balance,

547
00:22:59,168 --> 00:23:01,470
which staves off
the most debilitating

548
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:03,205
symptoms of Huntington's.

549
00:23:03,273 --> 00:23:05,608
<i>You've ended your
self-destructive streak.</i>

550
00:23:05,776 --> 00:23:07,843
Want to do
something significant,

551
00:23:07,911 --> 00:23:09,278
something that'll
last longer

552
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,713
than the few years
you have left.

553
00:23:12,381 --> 00:23:14,183
My team is your
first-best choice.

554
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:16,685
And my first choice is
the community health clinic

555
00:23:16,753 --> 00:23:19,120
I interviewed
with yesterday.

556
00:23:19,588 --> 00:23:20,856
Absolutely,
you should do that.

557
00:23:20,924 --> 00:23:23,091
<i>three hours a week.
Every doctor should.</i>

558
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:24,493
<i>'cause every doctor can.</i>

559
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,495
But you don't want
to be every doctor.

560
00:23:27,162 --> 00:23:28,530
<i>Plus, on my team,</i>

561
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:30,799
you get to screw
with Foreman.

562
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,434
Every way but literally.

563
00:23:32,502 --> 00:23:34,903
Why are you
doing it this way?

564
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:37,139
You're pretending to assume
we're all coming back

565
00:23:37,206 --> 00:23:38,573
without actually
asking us.

566
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:39,741
Why?

567
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:40,943
See, this is why
you'd be miserable

568
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,980
wiping noses in a clinic.

569
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,016
You can't ask because
you can't face the rejection.

570
00:23:48,484 --> 00:23:49,751
Why not?
What's going on?

571
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,219
Are you asking me
to ask you?

572
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:55,223
I'm saying you shouldn't,
for your sake as well as mine.

573
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:59,628
<i>We don't know how much
the sclerosing cholangitis</i>

574
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:01,229
has damaged your liver.

575
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:04,399
It might be in a year,
it might be in ten.

576
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:07,736
But the odds are you're
gonna need a new one.

577
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,205
And you should know,

578
00:24:10,273 --> 00:24:13,542
while no transplant committee
will say this openly,

579
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:14,910
<i>they'll never
grant an organ</i>

580
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:19,114
<i>to someone working
in your profession.</i>

581
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:20,983
You're saying
I have to change jobs?

582
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,020
You're medically
advising me to change jobs.

583
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,822
Hank, if you're
too sick--

584
00:24:26,889 --> 00:24:28,557
she wants me to have some kind
of religious conversion.

585
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:30,292
She's practically
salivating over it.

586
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,160
I'm just being
candid about--

587
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:33,929
so you don't
think I'm scum.

588
00:24:34,397 --> 00:24:35,764
<i>Just some committee
thinks I'm scum.</i>

589
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:37,667
That your
lifestyle has risks.

590
00:24:37,734 --> 00:24:41,136
You work around more sick people
and germs and blood than I do.

591
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:43,305
<i>I'm not gonna live
my life afraid</i>

592
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:44,973
like my parents did.

593
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:46,908
Barely letting me
play outside

594
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:49,478
and god forbid
that I get a scratch.

595
00:24:50,545 --> 00:24:51,680
I'll talk to him.

596
00:24:51,748 --> 00:24:53,515
He'll calm down and realize
that this is the only--

597
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:54,383
<i>No.</i>

598
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:54,984
No, I won't.

599
00:24:55,052 --> 00:24:57,386
Why does everyone want to
dictate the way I live my life?

600
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,355
Because the way we're living
is gonna kill you.

601
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:08,463
<i>passing
the pancreatic duct...</i>

602
00:25:08,931 --> 00:25:09,931
Don't listen to House.

603
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:11,967
You have no idea
what he said.

604
00:25:12,035 --> 00:25:13,635
<i>I know that House
is manipulative.</i>

605
00:25:13,703 --> 00:25:15,937
I know that you're in
a vulnerable state right now,

606
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:17,406
and I know that Cameron
wants your marriage to work.

607
00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:19,741
<i>So do you.</i>

608
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:21,344
So don't listen to House.

609
00:25:21,612 --> 00:25:23,945
House doesn't
make my decisions.

610
00:25:24,913 --> 00:25:27,516
<i>We're in the
common bile duct.</i>

611
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:30,452
What's that mass?
Gallstone?

612
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,924
Can we magnify
times five?

613
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,760
That's not a Gallstone.

614
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,996
His liver's completely
filled with worms.

615
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:45,414
<i>You have strongyloides,
also known as threadworms.</i>

616
00:25:45,482 --> 00:25:46,849
They disseminated
all over your body,

617
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,183
causing all
your symptoms.

618
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:49,985
How'd I get a parasite?

619
00:25:49,986 --> 00:25:53,722
Most likely through sexual
activity, but we can't be sure.

620
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,724
And what's the treatment?

621
00:25:56,192 --> 00:25:57,493
Two mebendazole pills.

622
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:00,462
That's it?

623
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,131
You'll be fine.
Your liver too.

624
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,236
<i>Go back to your lives.</i>

625
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:14,376
You know this is
the doctor's lounge.

626
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:15,744
I know.

627
00:26:15,812 --> 00:26:18,113
It seemed like the place
to read doctors' notes.

628
00:26:18,781 --> 00:26:22,818
You are good at it,
by the way.

629
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:25,587
Why are you
reading my charts?

630
00:26:25,655 --> 00:26:28,590
Because I'm worried
about my girlfriend.

631
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:29,958
<i>Your girlfriend...</i>

632
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:31,693
Is a male porn star?

633
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,262
Oh, no, I'm dating
Lisa Cuddy.

634
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:34,496
Seriously?

635
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:35,664
Cool, huh?

636
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:36,765
And if House doesn't
have his team,

637
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,867
that'll make her miserable,
which will make me miserable.

638
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:40,769
Which brings us
to the fact that

639
00:26:40,837 --> 00:26:43,272
you have elevated noting
to an art form.

640
00:26:44,239 --> 00:26:45,407
I see the connection.

641
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:46,742
Most doctors
write "9:00 a.m."

642
00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:48,644
if they scrub in at 9:00
or anything near it.

643
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:49,612
You write 9:03,

644
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,547
and you make little notations
when procedures are delayed.

645
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:54,383
You're easily impressed.

646
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,152
Well, yeah.

647
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,322
I was, till I saw that you had
virtually stopped writing them

648
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,024
about four weeks ago.

649
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:03,492
Been busy.
Got a backlog.

650
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,360
Yeah...

651
00:27:04,428 --> 00:27:06,062
People with
your level of precision

652
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:10,232
don't really just
"get" backlogs.

653
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,768
No one knows why
you're leaving P.P.T.H.

654
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,337
Because it's personal.

655
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:16,205
Well, if something
happened,

656
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:18,507
I mean,
if you're leaving

657
00:27:18,574 --> 00:27:19,775
to get away from
something that you did,

658
00:27:19,842 --> 00:27:22,378
<i>or she did,
or both of you did.</i>

659
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:24,012
<i>I mean, emotionally maybe
you want to run away,</i>

660
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
<i>but in my experience,</i>

661
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:30,285
if you're staring at a pit bull
in some guy's back yard,

662
00:27:30,353 --> 00:27:32,621
you're better off
staying right where you are.

663
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:34,690
Face the problem.

664
00:27:34,757 --> 00:27:40,696
That way it can't
bite you in the ass.

665
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:44,433
Thanks for
the folksy wisdom.

666
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,703
Hey, you got any, uh, dirt
on any of the other three?

667
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,072
It'd really help me out.

668
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:57,446
I thought you said those
two pills was all he needed!

669
00:27:57,513 --> 00:27:58,147
Lungs are filling
with fluid.

670
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:02,217
Suction him
and get him on oxygen.

671
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:08,023
Patient's lungs are
severely compromised.

672
00:28:08,091 --> 00:28:09,758
Liver's still failing.

673
00:28:09,826 --> 00:28:11,526
Worms could easily
have been a coincidence.

674
00:28:11,594 --> 00:28:13,462
Almost be surprising
if he didn't have 'em.

675
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,397
<i>Which means it could be
a hematological problem</i>

676
00:28:15,465 --> 00:28:17,132
<i>plus cardiomyopathy.</i>

677
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,068
No, neck veins are flat,
precordial exam was normal.

678
00:28:20,436 --> 00:28:22,137
What if it's lymphoma?

679
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:25,273
<i>Peritoneal carcinomatosis
explains the liver failure.</i>

680
00:28:25,341 --> 00:28:29,344
Paraneoplastic syndrome
explains everything else.

681
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:31,980
Lymphoma it is.

682
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:33,916
Prep him for chemo.

683
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:40,555
Fax Taub and Thirteen
the latest update on the case.

684
00:28:40,623 --> 00:28:41,923
Seriously?

685
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:44,794
They have as much right
to know as anyone on the team.

686
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:47,229
You either like
the diagnosis or you don't.

687
00:28:47,296 --> 00:28:48,898
<i>If you don't,
we need to keep talking.</i>

688
00:28:48,966 --> 00:28:51,299
If you do,
you need to shut up.

689
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:55,203
What we don't need
is this stupid game.

690
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:03,846
You're mad at House,
but you're not mad at me.

691
00:29:03,913 --> 00:29:06,481
Do you want me
to be mad at you?

692
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,517
You blame House.
Not me.

693
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:10,352
I am mad at House
because he's an ass.

694
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,855
And I am mad at you,
but I don't want to leave you.

695
00:29:13,923 --> 00:29:15,891
What I did may be
the worst thing I ever did.

696
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:17,659
It may be the best.

697
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:20,495
I'm either a murderer or a guy
who stopped a mass murderer,

698
00:29:20,563 --> 00:29:23,365
but I did it. Me.

699
00:29:23,433 --> 00:29:25,967
And even if it destroys me,
I'd do it again today.

700
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:28,137
You don't mean that.
This isn't you.

701
00:29:28,205 --> 00:29:30,038
I'm not running away
from what I did

702
00:29:30,106 --> 00:29:35,444
because you want to
pretend I never did it.

703
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:39,681
If that's how you feel...

704
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:42,584
Okay.

705
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,310
My strategy's not
completely working.

706
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:49,680
All four of them want
to work for me,

707
00:29:51,148 --> 00:29:52,415
but all four of them
have reasons

708
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:53,983
why they don't
want to work for me.

709
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,985
How do I get them
to take one from Column A

710
00:29:57,053 --> 00:29:59,121
and none from Column B?

711
00:30:03,925 --> 00:30:05,527
Right.

712
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,728
Right, by not
saying anything,

713
00:30:06,796 --> 00:30:08,597
you're saying that
the answer is inside me.

714
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:10,966
The answer has nothing
to do with the question.

715
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:12,769
Then it's not
technically the answer.

716
00:30:12,836 --> 00:30:14,170
<i>Why do you need
three of these doctors?</i>

717
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,439
Because I know
they're good.

718
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:19,742
Other doctors fall into
the "might be good" category.

719
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,444
It has nothing to do
with them being good.

720
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:23,312
You think they're
idiots half the time,

721
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,546
but they're comfortable.

722
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:25,648
<i>You feel
abandoned by Cuddy,</i>

723
00:30:25,716 --> 00:30:28,384
<i>so you're reaching out
to people you know for comfort.</i>

724
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:30,620
Oh, my god, you're right.

725
00:30:31,187 --> 00:30:33,456
I don't need
doctors at all.

726
00:30:33,523 --> 00:30:36,192
I just need
a good friend.

727
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:37,726
Cuddy's right.

728
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,561
<i>Maybe, just maybe,</i>

729
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,830
if I don't play along,
you'll realize

730
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:43,966
you can't solve a deeper problem
with a surface solution.

731
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:49,571
Would've been more profound
if you hadn't said anything.

732
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:52,141
You okay?

733
00:30:52,608 --> 00:30:54,175
Getting through it.

734
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,545
Be a lot easier once
you two are away from here.

735
00:30:56,612 --> 00:30:58,046
Yeah.

736
00:31:01,851 --> 00:31:03,686
He's peeing blood.

737
00:31:03,754 --> 00:31:05,987
<i>BP's rising.
Heart rate's up to 250.</i>

738
00:31:06,055 --> 00:31:07,889
He's going into
cardiac arrest.

739
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,560
Charging.

740
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:12,694
Clear.

741
00:31:12,762 --> 00:31:13,895
He's bleeding out.

742
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:15,030
His body's
completely giving out.

743
00:31:15,198 --> 00:31:17,899
Charging. Clear.

744
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:19,935
<i>We've got him
stabilized,</i>

745
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:22,237
but no red cells,
no white cells,

746
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:23,805
practically
no platelets either.

747
00:31:23,873 --> 00:31:26,075
Mebendazole can cause adverse
effects, but nothing like this.

748
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:30,979
He's been off 'em
since yesterday, anyway.

749
00:31:31,047 --> 00:31:34,616
Long passes,
wild guesses, anything.

750
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,084
<i>Hypopituitarism.</i>

751
00:31:36,152 --> 00:31:37,820
Could cause multi-organ
failure if--

752
00:31:37,888 --> 00:31:40,322
if his thyroid hormone
wasn't completely normal.

753
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:41,190
Renal cell carcinoma.

754
00:31:41,158 --> 00:31:43,226
Renal ultrasound
was clean.

755
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:45,695
I'd say
aleukemic leukemia.

756
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:47,429
<i>Marrow's not making
enough normal cells--</i>

757
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:49,064
Ablate the patient's
bone marrow.

758
00:31:49,131 --> 00:31:52,233
Find him a donor match.

759
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:54,202
You want to nuke
the patient's marrow?

760
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,871
<i>He had no evidence
of being anemic</i>

761
00:31:55,938 --> 00:31:57,506
<i>or immune-compromised
when he was admitted.</i>

762
00:31:57,573 --> 00:31:58,407
Perfect white count
as well.

763
00:31:58,475 --> 00:32:00,009
<i>Ablation could
kill him</i>

764
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:01,944
or leave him defenseless
against an infection that could.

765
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:07,449
Well, then come up
with something better.

766
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,489
He may as well die
while we're treating him.

767
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,958
Okay with you if I bring
the other candidates

768
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,627
into the loop now?

769
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,466
The risks are, uh,
they're really minimal.

770
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:28,770
We'll do a series
of painless injections, and--

771
00:32:28,838 --> 00:32:33,542
Excuse me.

772
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,810
The whole thing can be
done as an outpatient.

773
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:54,563
You're leaving
at 11:00 a.m.?

774
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:57,666
Trust me,
case is almost over.

775
00:32:57,734 --> 00:33:00,569
Foreman told me you're
ablating the patient's marrow,

776
00:33:00,637 --> 00:33:03,572
on a non-theory that
Foreman himself withdrew.

777
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,509
You're gonna
kill the patient.

778
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:12,881
Is this about
me and Lucas?

779
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,050
I want alternatives
for the patient.

780
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,854
So do I.

781
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:28,163
I want to be on the team.

782
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,639
You think that's gonna
save your marriage?

783
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:45,747
I don't know.

784
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,718
Four candidates,
three spots.

785
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:51,987
I got a tough decision
ahead of me.

786
00:34:15,246 --> 00:34:17,114
<i>Hi, Remy,
this is Dr. Turner</i>

787
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:19,450
<i>from the Pennsauken
Free Clinic.</i>

788
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:23,386
<i>We all loved meeting you,
and, well, the job's yours.</i>

789
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:26,923
<i>Call me back.
Let's pick a start date.</i>

790
00:34:41,405 --> 00:34:43,240
I want it
to look natural.

791
00:34:43,307 --> 00:34:45,275
I mean, much younger,
but natural.

792
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:47,477
Can you get rid of
the crow's feet altogether?

793
00:34:47,645 --> 00:34:49,312
Or is it better
to leave a trace of them?

794
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,915
I don't look old enough
to have them anyway, do I?

795
00:34:52,482 --> 00:34:53,316
Absolutely.

796
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:55,284
I do look old enough?

797
00:34:55,352 --> 00:34:58,922
No. What?
I'm sorry.

798
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:03,192
Hang on a second.

799
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,166
Why are you here?

800
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,668
'cause I think
we're wrong.

801
00:35:11,735 --> 00:35:14,571
Which means something's
gonna go wrong.

802
00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:17,473
Or right.

803
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:19,409
Takayama here.

804
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:23,547
It's me and Thirteen.
Stop the ablation.

805
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,183
Because?

806
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,250
<i>Those threadworms.</i>

807
00:35:27,318 --> 00:35:28,451
Why would his body
have gone to hell

808
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:30,153
just hours after
they were gone?

809
00:35:30,221 --> 00:35:31,288
<i>The worms weren't
hurting him.</i>

810
00:35:31,356 --> 00:35:34,023
They were helping him.
He has extraintestinal crohn's.

811
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:36,693
<i>He got it from being
raised in a too clean,</i>

812
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:38,995
<i>too overprotective
of an environment.</i>

813
00:35:39,063 --> 00:35:40,164
<i>It's the hygiene
hypothesis.</i>

814
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:42,332
<i>Why there's so much autoimmune
disease in the developed world,</i>

815
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,667
and almost none
in the developing world.

816
00:35:44,735 --> 00:35:46,035
<i>The worms were keeping
the crohn's in check,</i>

817
00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:47,404
<i>teaching his
immune system</i>

818
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:50,473
what it should've learned
from eating dirt growing up.

819
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,408
Once you killed them,
it started killing him.

820
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:56,246
So his life of filth
wasn't the problem.

821
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:59,282
Clean living was.

822
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,217
Let's start him
on methylprednisolone.

823
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:03,786
And some helminths.

824
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:05,455
Worms.

825
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:08,258
Cool, huh?

826
00:36:09,025 --> 00:36:10,560
Best out of three?

827
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,467
<i>Have you been a bad boy?</i>

828
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:29,612
I want to be on the team.

829
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,248
Good news for your wife.

830
00:36:33,116 --> 00:36:35,386
Thanks for the sarcasm.

831
00:36:35,453 --> 00:36:38,521
I reorganized my life
to spend more time with her,

832
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:41,858
but apparently I don't love her
as much as I thought.

833
00:36:41,926 --> 00:36:43,593
Or you love her more.

834
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,063
<i>This job gives you
the thrill</i>

835
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,766
you used to find
through philandering.

836
00:36:50,034 --> 00:36:51,935
Better to cheat
with a beaker and an M.R.I.

837
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:57,607
than one of your platinum-blonde
plastic surgery patients.

838
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:01,511
I'll let you know.

839
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:22,632
I told House I want
to work for him again.

840
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,368
Stay on the team.

841
00:37:25,736 --> 00:37:27,136
You were always more
into it than I was,

842
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,573
more interested
in diagnostics.

843
00:37:30,841 --> 00:37:35,945
Unless House was right
about why you want out.

844
00:37:44,087 --> 00:37:48,357
Four for four.

845
00:37:52,963 --> 00:37:56,065
I was in love with you.

846
00:37:56,133 --> 00:37:58,434
I was an idiot.

847
00:37:58,502 --> 00:38:00,870
Tried to be like you,
tried to understand you

848
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:05,207
because I thought
I could heal you.

849
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:09,578
You almost killed
that patient.

850
00:38:09,646 --> 00:38:11,647
If almost not saving
his life means--

851
00:38:11,715 --> 00:38:13,883
you knew the diagnosis
a long time ago.

852
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:16,452
You risked another patient's
life to bait your old team.

853
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,653
Another one?

854
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,989
You did kill Dibala.

855
00:38:20,457 --> 00:38:23,893
By playing god and
teaching us to do the same.

856
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:25,494
I taught you to think
for yourselves.

857
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:26,829
You don't even think
of them as people.

858
00:38:26,897 --> 00:38:29,666
They're just lab rats
for your little puzzles.

859
00:38:29,734 --> 00:38:30,767
As you celebrate
their humanity,

860
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:33,202
I'd rather solve those little
puzzles and save their lives.

861
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,171
Motives do matter.

862
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:36,406
Lives can't come second.

863
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:38,975
The patient is alive.
That's what matters.

864
00:38:39,042 --> 00:38:40,609
Not to you.

865
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:44,413
All you care about is that Taub
and Thirteen fell for your game.

866
00:38:44,481 --> 00:38:47,416
You'll poison them
just like you poisoned Chase.

867
00:38:48,584 --> 00:38:52,154
Your husband killed a patient
and you're breaking up with me.

868
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:58,294
You ruined him.

869
00:38:58,762 --> 00:39:02,665
So he can't even
see right from wrong.

870
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:08,471
Can't even see the sanctity
of a human life anymore.

871
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:13,442
I loved you.

872
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,612
And I loved Chase.

873
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,216
I'm sorry for you both.

874
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:21,250
For what you've become.

875
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:24,854
Because...

876
00:39:24,922 --> 00:39:28,557
There's no way back
for either of you.

877
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:33,222
Any idea
where I can get

878
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:37,860
a great, big
"Mission Accomplished" banner?

879
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:40,563
<i>Got my sanity back,</i>

880
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,301
my license back,
and now...

881
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:47,269
You're kidding.
All of them?

882
00:40:47,337 --> 00:40:49,238
Three out of four.

883
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:51,107
Which is almost as good
as four out of five.

884
00:40:51,174 --> 00:40:52,541
Who was the--

885
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:53,876
Cameron.

886
00:40:54,044 --> 00:40:55,044
Wow.

887
00:40:55,412 --> 00:40:56,946
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

888
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:59,782
<i>I mean, really.
I can't...</i>

889
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:04,253
Believe it.

890
00:41:04,321 --> 00:41:07,723
You were right, House.
Good for you.

891
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:11,827
Yeah, it is.

892
00:41:11,895 --> 00:41:15,231
She's broken up with Chase,
and she's leaving the hospital.

893
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:19,168
Still, three out
of four ain't bad.
