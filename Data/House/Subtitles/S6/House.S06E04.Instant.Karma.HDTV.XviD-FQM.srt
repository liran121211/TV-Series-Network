00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:25,386
Marina: <i>Mr Randall?</i>

2
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:27,922
They're here.

3
00:00:44,573 --> 00:00:47,041
Pete: <i>$52 million includes over $6 million...</i>

4
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:49,443
already issued pursuant to 
the over-allotment option.

5
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,678
When can we close?

6
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:52,580
It would be subject to regulatory approval...

7
00:00:52,647 --> 00:00:54,648
<i>in both Toronto and...</i>

8
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:58,052
I didn't say, "how," Oliver.
I said, "when."

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,220
What?

10
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:00,588
You sure this is a direction?

11
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:02,089
You want to go, Roy?

12
00:01:02,157 --> 00:01:03,624
This would move us from energy service into...

13
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:05,926
You don't think oil's going up?

14
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,495
Of course it's gonna go up.

15
00:01:07,562 --> 00:01:08,796
The question is when.

16
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,364
The question is always when,
and if we wait...

17
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:12,333
until the deal makes sense
to everyone else...

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,735
we're gonna be waiting in line 
behind everyone else.

19
00:01:14,803 --> 00:01:16,504
All I'm saying is...

20
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:20,007
The same cover-your-ass crap
you always say.

21
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:20,941
We're gonna have to wrap this up.

22
00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:22,042
I got to go.

23
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,744
<i>Where are you going?
- Upstairs.</i>

24
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:25,446
Get the regulators on it.

25
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:26,580
<i>I want to close by the end of the month.
Come on, Roy.</i>

26
00:01:26,648 --> 00:01:28,949
There are ten other items on the agenda.

27
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:30,317
Which will have to wait until next week.

28
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:31,585
You can't drag us all out of the office...

29
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:33,988
get halfway through, and then 
just kick us out.

30
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:35,256
Yeah, I can.

31
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,152
Dr Johnson: <i>The antibiotic treatment had no effect.</i>

32
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,555
Both the fever and the pain are getting worse.

33
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:10,157
Which means it's not
Clostridium difficile.

34
00:02:10,225 --> 00:02:13,127
But you said that was the only
diagnosis that made sense.

35
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:15,095
It was.

36
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:17,498
We need to get him to a hospital.

37
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:21,468
Jack: <i>Dad?</i>

38
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:24,905
I don't want to go.

39
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:28,309
I know, buddy.

40
00:02:28,376 --> 00:02:30,411
<i>But we may need to.</i>

41
00:02:30,478 --> 00:02:31,845
Am I gonna die?

42
00:02:31,913 --> 00:02:37,484
No, of course not.

43
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:39,153
How do you know?

44
00:02:39,221 --> 00:02:44,225
Well, I just do.

45
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,693
And I'm always right, aren't I?

46
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,597
Yeah.

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,900
I want House.

50
00:03:26,968 --> 00:03:29,203
I understand, but I told you...

51
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:30,571
Dr House isn't available.

52
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,972
Dr...
- <i>Call him.</i>

53
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,541
Tell him I'll have a private jet.

54
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:36,243
Pick him up from whatever island.

55
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,578
<i>He isn't on vacation.</i>

56
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:39,380
Dr Foreman's one of our best doctors.

57
00:03:39,447 --> 00:03:40,814
Is House in jail?

58
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:42,283
No.

59
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,052
Foreman is currently working
with two of House's...

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,520
<i>most veteran associates.
- Rehab?</i>

61
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,522
No.

62
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,292
Mr Randall, your son will be in good hands.

63
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:55,763
My son, has already been in good hands...

64
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,598
and he's still dying.

65
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,267
<i>I'm through dealing with good.</i>

66
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:04,104
I want the best and everyone
I've asked says that's House.

67
00:04:04,172 --> 00:04:07,474
<i>So unless he's dead, comatose...</i>

68
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:12,146
or insane, I want him treating my son today.

69
00:04:18,186 --> 00:04:21,455
You could have said no
in good conscience.

70
00:04:21,523 --> 00:04:22,890
Cuddy: <i>The kid'll still be Foreman's patient...</i>

71
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:25,326
But his dad wants you making the decisions.

72
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:27,394
Then he's not my patient.

73
00:04:27,462 --> 00:04:29,029
You want to give me none
of the responsibility...

74
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:30,431
and all of the liability?

75
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:33,634
Which means I get...

76
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,502
Oh, cool.

77
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,505
Don't let him do anything crazy.

78
00:04:38,573 --> 00:04:40,941
When is he getting his license back...

79
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,509
so we can stop playing this game?

80
00:04:42,577 --> 00:04:46,080
Maybe never.
This game is fun.

81
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:48,282
You also need to prepare 
President Dibala's case...

82
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,852
for this week's morbidity and mortality conference.

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,888
Oh, unfortunately I'm overdue
a mani-pedi appointment.

84
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:55,889
<i>Not you.</i>

85
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:57,157
Foreman's department.

86
00:04:57,225 --> 00:04:58,559
Oh, right.

87
00:04:58,626 --> 00:04:59,960
Well, he's got all the time in the world.

88
00:05:00,028 --> 00:05:02,429
We made the wrong call.
He died.

89
00:05:02,497 --> 00:05:03,997
There's nothing to present.

90
00:05:04,065 --> 00:05:06,633
It obviously garnered a lot of curiosity.

91
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:08,035
And we don't have more
important things to do...

92
00:05:08,103 --> 00:05:10,437
than satisfy everyone's idle curiosity?

93
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:12,473
It's not idle.

94
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,476
The question of how we deal
with two possible diagnoses...

95
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:17,010
whose treatments are contraindicated...

96
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:19,880
is worth discussing.

97
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:23,484
Abdominal pain increasing
in severity and frequency...

98
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:24,985
<i>fever, dehydration...</i>

99
00:05:25,053 --> 00:05:27,087
diarrhoea, weight loss.

100
00:05:27,155 --> 00:05:28,689
Mom died from kidney failure caused...

101
00:05:28,757 --> 00:05:30,691
by Type I Diabetes, which has been ruled out.

102
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,959
House: <i>17 doctors.</i>

103
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:33,894
<i>Everything's been ruled out.</i>

104
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:36,163
Which means we have to re-rule out.

105
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:37,631
Get a new history and physical.

106
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:43,003
Unless that's crazy, boss.

107
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:44,271
Cameron: You been out of the country...

108
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,273
or on any recent camping trips?

109
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:47,875
No camping.

110
00:05:47,942 --> 00:05:49,710
But we were in Montreal back in January.

111
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:52,513
We went to see the NHL All-Star
game for my birthday.

112
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,615
Awesome.

113
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:56,316
Where's Dr House?

114
00:05:56,384 --> 00:05:58,051
In his office.

115
00:05:58,119 --> 00:06:00,487
He's really more of a decider than a doer.

116
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:02,389
<i>He's decided we should
start over.</i>

117
00:06:02,457 --> 00:06:05,659
Never know what previous doctors
may have missed.

118
00:06:08,496 --> 00:06:10,831
Like this.

119
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:12,733
Does that hurt more when I push there?

120
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,401
Not really.

121
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:16,370
What is it?

122
00:06:16,438 --> 00:06:19,072
I'm not sure.

123
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,175
Just keep it clean, simple.

124
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,910
We did a test that called into question...

125
00:06:22,977 --> 00:06:25,245
our initial diagnosis, so we 
changed our mind.

126
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:27,347
And if they ask how the test was done?

127
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:30,150
Why would they do that?
It's a routine lab test.

128
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:33,253
Routine lab tests don't involve blood you stole...

129
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,521
from a corpse to trick me...

130
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:36,023
into giving the guy the wrong treatment.

131
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,691
Yes, and if you brought that up...

132
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,960
it'd certainly make for a lively 
debate about the morality...

133
00:06:40,028 --> 00:06:41,728
<i>of murdering murderers.</i>

134
00:06:41,796 --> 00:06:43,430
But since you burned the only
evidence of that...

135
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:45,332
To cover for you, not me.

136
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,900
<i>You're protected.</i>

137
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:48,535
The decision was a coin flip.

138
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:51,972
There was no right or wrong answer.

139
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,741
The body's underground,
8,000 miles away.

140
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:56,677
Nobody can prove anything.

141
00:06:56,744 --> 00:06:58,712
That room will be filled, not 
because of the coin flip,...

142
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,547
not because of the patient...

143
00:07:00,615 --> 00:07:02,749
but because House's department screwed up.

144
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:05,419
They're gonna be like sharks in 
a chum-filled swimming pool...

145
00:07:05,487 --> 00:07:07,120
and there's no way I'm jumping in...

146
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:09,990
unless I'm in a steel cage.

147
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:11,558
So what do you want?

148
00:07:11,626 --> 00:07:14,561
I want to know you have everything covered.

149
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:17,764
House: <i>Got what covered?</i>

150
00:07:17,832 --> 00:07:20,067
We're just reviewing the Dibala’s case.

151
00:07:20,134 --> 00:07:22,102
Making sure we didn't miss anything.

152
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,971
We didn't.

153
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:27,474
Except of course the thing that killed him.

154
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,343
Cameron: <i>He's constipated.</i>

155
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,811
Physical revealed a mass in his abdomen...

156
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:32,012
so, I repeated the x-ray.

157
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,614
Old one was clean.

158
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,449
New one shows that his colon's
almost completely impacted.

159
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:38,519
Obstruction would explain the pain.

160
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,587
Think they just screwed up 
the old x-ray?

161
00:07:40,655 --> 00:07:42,489
Nope.

162
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,494
Hirschsprung's?

163
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:49,796
It's a congenital disorder of the nerves 
in the colon.

164
00:07:49,864 --> 00:07:51,732
Very rare in a child your son's age.

165
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,400
Most doctors would never think of it.

166
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:54,635
And you came up with this?

167
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:56,470
It's House's idea.

168
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:58,105
We need a barium enema 
and biopsy to confirm.

169
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,640
Let me guess.

170
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,875
It tastes really bad,...

171
00:08:01,943 --> 00:08:06,046
but it's gonna make me feel
a lot better.

172
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:08,916
Actually, you're not gonna taste it.

173
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:13,520
[<i>Fanfarlo's Fire Escape</i>]

174
00:08:20,128 --> 00:08:23,830
You should try searching for 
‘Misty May digs for gold.’

175
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,465
Make sure you put it in quotes.

176
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:28,101
I'm making travel plans.

177
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:30,571
<i>Just need to get away.</i>

178
00:08:30,638 --> 00:08:32,506
Have some time to myself.

179
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:35,475

00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:51,376
in the Bahamas you want
to get from it all.

359
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:52,510
The Bahamas?

360
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,312
[<i>Sighs</i>]
Costa Rica?

361
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,214
I told you Thailand.

362
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:58,550
I assumed you were lying.

363
00:15:58,617 --> 00:16:01,486
Because it would have been idiotic 
of you to tell me truth.

364
00:16:01,554 --> 00:16:05,223
Yet, another reason I have 
no use for you.

365
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,761
Foreman: <i>We've got a problem.</i>

366
00:16:09,828 --> 00:16:12,197
When Cameron sent Dibala's  
blood to the lab...

367
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,966
she specifically asked for the anticentromere 
antibodies test.

368
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,834
So?

369
00:16:16,902 --> 00:16:17,969
The printout they sent you included...

370
00:16:18,037 --> 00:16:19,871
just the anticentromere antibodies...

371
00:16:19,939 --> 00:16:22,006
but the lab also did a full blood panel.

372
00:16:22,074 --> 00:16:23,975
So, I'm not an idiot.

373
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:26,144
I obviously made sure the cadaver 
I got the sample from...

374
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:27,478
had the same blood type.

375
00:16:27,546 --> 00:16:29,581
You apparently didn't check his cholesterol.

376
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:32,917
How far off?

377
00:16:32,985 --> 00:16:34,252
20%.

378
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:53,059
Chase: 
<i>Dibala didn't die of high cholesterol.</i>

379
00:16:53,127 --> 00:16:55,795
Why would anyone even bother
to compare the two reports?

380
00:16:55,863 --> 00:16:56,963
The same reason I did.

381
00:16:57,031 --> 00:16:57,964
Because they're looking for anything...

382
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,232
we might have screwed up.

383
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,034
We could claim the blood analyzer broke.

384
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:02,435
We can't.

385
00:17:02,503 --> 00:17:04,003
Cameron documented that
it was perfectly calibrated...

386
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,238
when she did the test.

387
00:17:05,306 --> 00:17:06,773
So the numbers are off, it's weird.

388
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:08,107
Who cares?

389
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:09,309
If it comes up, just act surprised...

390
00:17:09,376 --> 00:17:11,010
like it's some irrelevant curiosity.

391
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:12,979
I can't do this.

392
00:17:13,047 --> 00:17:16,549
I can't go in there and stack lie upon lie.

393
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:20,186
You've got to figure out
a way to explain this.

394
00:17:20,254 --> 00:17:21,321
Hey.
- Hey.

395
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:22,555
Missed you this morning.

396
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:24,090
Yeah, sorry.

397
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:26,192
I needed to get in early.
I didn't want to wake you.

398
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,427
I thought you did want to wake me.

399
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:28,361
At least that's what 
you said last night.

400
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:29,329
I'm out of here.
- <i>No, no.</i>

401
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,497
I have the biopsy results.

402
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:32,098
It's not cancer.

403
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,606
How can so much be wrong
with nothing being wrong?

404
00:17:39,673 --> 00:17:42,108
Since when has cancer been
considered nothing?

405
00:17:42,176 --> 00:17:43,576
I just said it's not cancer.

406
00:17:43,644 --> 00:17:44,944
The cell morphologies were all normal.

407
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:47,580
And so are the most recent CT scans.

408
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:50,316
On the other hand, andenocarcinoma 
of the stomach...

409
00:17:50,384 --> 00:17:52,785
would cause pain, constipation...

410
00:17:52,853 --> 00:17:54,587
<i>nutritional deficiencies...</i>

411
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:56,022
that could cause seizures.

412
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,391
And wouldn't show on a CT.

413
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,827
You're right about the cancer.

414
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:04,063
Just wrong about the place.

415
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:07,267
Continue to say nothing if you agree.

416
00:18:08,903 --> 00:18:10,537
Go scope him.

417
00:18:10,604 --> 00:18:11,704
<i>Get another set of biopsies.</i>

418
00:18:18,612 --> 00:18:21,014
I'd get cancelling her ticket...

419
00:18:21,081 --> 00:18:22,782

420
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,051

421

What are you talking about?

422
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,288
Or showed up at all.

423
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:30,523
But how does just ruining her plans...

424
00:18:30,591 --> 00:18:33,059
get her to agree to yours?

425
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:35,028
You talking about Thirteen?

426
00:18:35,095 --> 00:18:37,030
Where's she going?

427
00:18:37,097 --> 00:18:39,065
Well, nowhere this week, thanks to you.

428
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:40,133
I didn't stop her.

429
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,068
I'm not gonna stop her.

430
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:47,340
I've already done all I could.

431
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:50,310
Now, all I can do is move on.

435
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:00,453
you're even more rational than I...

436
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:03,823
well, not more.

437
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:07,627
Then again, more sane.

<i>I told you there's nothing wrong.</i>

440
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:15,835
There's obviously something wrong.

441
00:19:15,903 --> 00:19:17,870
And, I'm not even saying we need
to talk about it right now.

442
00:19:17,938 --> 00:19:19,973
I just don't see why 
you have to deny it.

443
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,808
I'm not.

444
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:24,344
Now, you're denying you're denying.

445
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:26,379
No, I'm denying that there's
anything to deny.

his early blood panels...

450
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:40,593
don't match a later panel.

451
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,762
That's weird.

452
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:45,398
Yeah.

453
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:51,571
It's no big deal.

454

Cholesterol didn't have anything 
to do with his death...

But, you know, after being 
let go from Mercy...

456
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:59,078
and then that thing with 
Thirteen's drug trial...

457
00:19:59,146 --> 00:20:00,713
Foreman's paranoid about people 
questioning the way...

458
00:20:00,781 --> 00:20:01,681
he handled the case.

459
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:03,182
That's ridiculous.

460
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,450
If anything, Foreman should be feeling secure.

461
00:20:04,518 --> 00:20:05,785
He's the one who had
the right diagnosis.

462
00:20:05,853 --> 00:20:07,053
We're the ones who
talked him out of it.

463
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:08,454
I know.

464
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:10,356
Don't tell him I told you.

465
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:11,991
He doesn't want to show
any signs of weakness...

466
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,226
Especially now that House is claiming...

467
00:20:13,293 --> 00:20:14,761
he wants him to stay in charge.

468
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:17,397
All right.

469
00:20:17,464 --> 00:20:18,765
So it's still cancer?

470
00:20:18,832 --> 00:20:20,133
It's just somewhere else?

471
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,467
That's what we're looking for...

472
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:23,369
but it would explain all the symptoms...

473
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:25,405
<i>and all the normal test and imaging studies.</i>

00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:32,011
It's my fault.

477
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,081
Adenocarcinomas aren't caused by diet...

481
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:47,060
By the time I was 30, it was worth over a billion.

It's karma.

492

and he's still accumulating subdural

We already ruled out infection.

Only because he was treated 
for it and got worse.

00:22:19,979 --> 00:22:21,480

529
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,299
The seizures would just look like pain...

530

<i>until it spread to his motor cortex.</i>

531
00:22:42,668 --> 00:22:43,969
It wouldn't explain the fevers.

Protein malnutrition can cause fevers...

533

if it was my idea...

537
00:22:56,182 --> 00:22:57,916
but it's the best we got.

538
00:22:57,984 --> 00:23:00,018
Start him on gabapentin.

539
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:01,753
Hook him up to an intracranial EEG...

540
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:04,289
for continuous monitoring.

541
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,700
I gave him statins.

542
00:23:15,768 --> 00:23:17,235
What?

543
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:18,537
If they ask about the cholesterol...

544
00:23:18,604 --> 00:23:19,771
Just say I prescribed a statin.

545
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,039
and forgot to put it in the chart.

546
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:22,374
You want to solve a problem in the records...

547
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,543
by creating another problem
in the records?

548
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,844
It's not a problem with the records.

549
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:27,479
It's a problem with my record keeping.

550
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:29,514
There's no way anyone
can prove me wrong.

551
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:32,184
How'd you get access to the statins?

552
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:33,618
You gonna get someone in the pharmacy...

553
00:23:33,686 --> 00:23:36,121
to confess to yet another record-keeping problem?

554
00:23:36,189 --> 00:23:38,590
I saw an open cart. Just took it.

555
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:40,592
Why would you steal a drug...

556
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,893
you could just as easily ask for?

557
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:45,497
'Cause I'm trying to get you off the hook.

558
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:47,666
A story that raises more questions 
than it answers...

559
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:50,235
only puts the hook deeper
down my throat.

560
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,537
It's all right. I'll handle it.

561
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:53,939
How?

562
00:23:54,006 --> 00:23:56,274
By telling the truth.

563
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:57,742
The truth is I don't have the time...

564
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,810
I'm not in the mood, and 
I don't see the point.

565
00:23:58,878 --> 00:24:00,579
You don't want to do the M&M...

566
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:02,647
because you're not in the mood?

567
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:04,116
This kid is dying and I've got House...

568
00:24:04,183 --> 00:24:06,184
trying to push all his responsibilities 
onto me.

569
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:07,552
They're not his responsibilities.

570
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,154
They're yours.

571
00:24:09,222 --> 00:24:10,355
You're the one who wanted
to be in charge.

572
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:11,256
I wanted to be in charge...

573
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,390
Not a figurehead.

574
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:14,626
Then do the M&M.
It's all yours.

575
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:16,495
You want me to get flogged?
For what?

576
00:24:16,562 --> 00:24:18,096
So, you can have an academic debate...

577
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:20,265
about a diagnostic dilemma no one's 
ever gonna face again?

578
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:24,769
What the hell's going on here?

579
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:27,005
I just don't want to do the M&M.

580
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:34,446
Did it work? 
- Not even close.

581
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:51,630
Everything okay?

582
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:54,432
Just waiting for whatever
is about to go wrong.

583
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,068
Thirteen called.

584
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:58,003
She have a theory that 
makes more sense...

585
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,905
than abdominal epilepsy?

586
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:01,640
She said someone hacked
into her e-mail account...

587
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:04,676
and cancelled an airline reservation.

588
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:05,977
I'm guessing Foreman.

589
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:08,346
Really?

590
00:25:08,414 --> 00:25:09,881
You're accusing Foreman, not me?

591
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:12,751
Cool.

592
00:25:12,818 --> 00:25:15,253
You really want Foreman to 
stay in charge of the team?

593
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:17,589
Makes sense.

594
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:20,325
He loves power, and I love puzzles.

595
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,761
You love power and puzzles.

596
00:25:22,828 --> 00:25:25,864
True.

597
00:25:25,932 --> 00:25:28,366
When I had them both.

598
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,140
It wasn't Foreman.

599
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,775
How do you know?

600
00:25:36,842 --> 00:25:40,345
He said he's moved on.

601
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,947
<i>And you believe him?</i>

602
00:25:42,014 --> 00:25:43,882
I believe that he believes it.

603
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,786
[<i>Pager beeps</i>]

604
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:52,524
Looks like it's time for me
to get off the bench.

605
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:02,167
What's up?

606
00:26:02,235 --> 00:26:04,035
Are you Dr House?

607
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:05,704
I understand you're a big fan.

608
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:09,140
I'll have my guy send over
a signed glossy.

609
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:11,176
Continuous EEG shows no interictal spikes.

610
00:26:11,244 --> 00:26:12,811
It's not abdominal epilepsy.

611
00:26:12,878 --> 00:26:14,613
You paged me to tell me what it's not?

612
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,614
I paged you to show you this.

613
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:22,120
That I did not expect.

614
00:26:22,188 --> 00:26:24,022
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

615
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,257
Darn it.

616
00:26:25,324 --> 00:26:28,093
I knew I should have stayed outside.

617
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,394
<i>Fantasy's always much better 
than the reality.</i>

618
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,662
You think this is a joke?

619
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,897
<i>That's my son; he's dying...</i>

620
00:26:32,965 --> 00:26:35,834
and not one of you seem to have
the slightest clue why.

621
00:26:35,901 --> 00:26:37,769
I know.

622
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:39,504
That's why it's so interesting.

623
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:44,474
<i>Fever, stomach pain, seizures...</i>

624
00:26:44,542 --> 00:26:46,243
peritoneal and subdural fluid collection...

625
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:48,412
and now spots.

626
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:50,213
Could be an allergic reaction 
to one of his meds.

627
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:51,648
That suddenly developed eight hours...

628
00:26:51,716 --> 00:26:53,183
after he started the meds?

629
00:26:53,251 --> 00:26:55,352
If it's not cancer infection,
it has to be autoimmune.

630
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,087
<i>Systemic lupus complicated...</i>

631
00:26:57,155 --> 00:26:59,723
by a CNS vasculitis would explain 
the rash, fever...

632
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,058
<i>ascites...</i>

633
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,592
CNS vasculitis would cause a stiff neck...

634
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,361
along with a headache.

635
00:27:04,429 --> 00:27:07,664
And would've showed up on 
the dural biopsy.

636
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:09,232
What about polyarteritis nodosa?

637
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,767
It can occur in kids.

638
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:13,203
Except you can't have arteritis
without inflammation.

639
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:15,138
Okay, you come up with 
something better.

640
00:27:18,142 --> 00:27:19,543
Go on.

641
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,912
There was some inflammation
in the skin biopsy...

642
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:24,815
plus he's got elevated
diastolic pressure.

643
00:27:24,882 --> 00:27:27,217
It's barely elevated, which you'd expect...

644
00:27:27,285 --> 00:27:28,986
given the number of procedures 
he's undergone.

645
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:31,254
Well, barely is more
than not barely.

646
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:37,794
Not my decision.

647
00:27:37,862 --> 00:27:40,364
But if it was, I'd say start 
him on prednisone...

648
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:42,199
and get a testicular biopsy.

649
00:27:42,266 --> 00:27:43,633
If he's gonna have any 
real inflammation...

650
00:27:43,701 --> 00:27:45,035
it'll be down there.

651
00:27:45,103 --> 00:27:47,037
Cameron and I will do it.
- <i>Why?</i>

652
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:48,405
It was Chase's idea.

653
00:27:48,473 --> 00:27:50,073
<i>Kid's father is not gonna be happy...</i>

654
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:51,608
<i>about a fourth set of biopsies...</i>

655
00:27:51,676 --> 00:27:53,310
and you've got a better rapport.

656
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:55,779
What's really going on here?

657
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:58,048
You need Chase to help you
over-prep for the M&M?

658
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:00,650
Yes.

659
00:28:00,718 --> 00:28:03,086
Then say so. Don't be a child.

660
00:28:03,154 --> 00:28:08,525
Is it on his penis?

661
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:09,659
Kid's rash?

662
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:11,395
Yeah, why?

663
00:28:11,462 --> 00:28:15,298
Means it's most likely affecting
the small blood vessels.

664
00:28:15,366 --> 00:28:19,169
That's why we didn't see any
inflammation on the biopsies.

665
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:21,705
It's not polyarteritis.

666
00:28:21,773 --> 00:28:23,440
It's Degos disease.

667
00:28:30,314 --> 00:28:31,848
I'll do it.

668
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:48,432
Your son has Degos disease.

669
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:50,834
Causes microblood vessels...

670
00:28:50,902 --> 00:28:54,037
<i>in the brain, skin, GI tract...</i>

671
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:56,440
<i>to break down, clot off.</i>

672
00:28:56,507 --> 00:28:59,676
It sometimes manifests early on...

673
00:28:59,744 --> 00:29:02,679
<i>with atrophic papules on the penis.</i>

674
00:29:02,747 --> 00:29:05,148
In your son's case, we don't know why,...

675
00:29:05,216 --> 00:29:07,784
but they came much later.

676
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:10,987
What's the treatment?

677
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,525
There isn't one.

678
00:29:15,593 --> 00:29:17,661
It's incurable.

679
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:27,136
You're wrong.

680
00:29:27,204 --> 00:29:28,871
You've already been wrong a bunch of times.

681
00:29:28,939 --> 00:29:32,141
We've rechecked the biopsies.

682
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:33,676
It's definitely Degos.

683
00:29:37,982 --> 00:29:39,182
I'm sorry.

684
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:41,084
I wish there was something we could do.

685
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,994
How long?

686
00:29:51,061 --> 00:29:54,497
<i>Not much longer.</i>

687
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:56,332
What does that mean?

688
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,469
Day at the most.

689
00:30:43,881 --> 00:30:45,114
All right, great.

690
00:30:45,182 --> 00:30:46,683
We need to talk.

691
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,419
Unless it's life or death,
it's gonna have to wait.

692
00:30:49,486 --> 00:30:50,520
It's about Dibala.

693
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:52,121
Well, let me rephrase.

694
00:30:52,189 --> 00:30:53,389
Unless it's a current life...

695
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:56,192
Foreman can't present the 
case at the M&M.

696
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,094
I know you guys are busy,
but he's just...

697
00:30:58,162 --> 00:30:59,662
gonna have to suck it up
and make the time.

698
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,264
It's not the time.

699
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:02,298
Then what is it?

700
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:05,902
The anticentromere antibodies test.

701
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:07,904
The test that caused us
to change the treatment...

702
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:11,140
from blastomycosis to scleroderma...

703
00:31:11,208 --> 00:31:12,909
It wasn't.

704
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:15,845
Wasn't what?

705
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:17,447
Diane: <i>Dr Cuddy?</i>

706
00:31:17,514 --> 00:31:19,248
They need you in the pediatric ICU.

707
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:20,249
Who's they?

708
00:31:20,317 --> 00:31:21,250
I don't know.

709
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:22,652
<i>But, I think they're lawyers.</i>

710
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,258
If you guys screwed something
up, just come clean.

711
00:31:29,326 --> 00:31:31,127
It's not gonna be that bad.

712
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,698
Ken:
<i>With all due respect...</i>

713
00:31:35,766 --> 00:31:37,200
