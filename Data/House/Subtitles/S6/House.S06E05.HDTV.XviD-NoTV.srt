1
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,372
Left! Left! He's going left!

2
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:14,701
I'm gonna have a heart attack.

3
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,269
Nowhere to go, buddy.

4
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,589
What was that?
What are we chasing?

5
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:00,840
Go that way.

6
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,261
Nowhere to go. Give it up.

7
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,769
Come on, this way.

8
00:01:26,894 --> 00:01:28,344
Let's go, let's go.

9
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,891
Up, Donny. He's going for the roof.
He's going up, go.

10
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,554
Damn it.

11
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:38,764
Just go, go!

12
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,611
It's too far!

Synchro: Benj, ShalimarFox, Arrow

16
00:03:05,131 --> 00:03:06,474
I can rest at home.

17
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:08,682
We can't release you
for at least two days.

18
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:10,940
You have two broken bones,
a severe concussion,

19
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,358
Collapsed lung.

20
00:03:12,805 --> 00:03:14,652
But you didn't find
anything life-threatening.

21
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:16,569
You fell 30 feet.
You should have died.

22
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,489
- That was the point.
- Shut up.

23
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,592
- You have suicidal thoughts?
- Not once. Never.

24
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,302
He doesn't want to kill himself.
He thinks he's gonna die soon,

25
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:26,330
so it doesn't matter...
Now you shut up.

26
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,458
I'm the one you're not covering
when you pull your crazy stunts.

27
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,752
- Why do you think that?
- My dad,

28
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,892
grandfather, and great-grandfather

29
00:03:34,017 --> 00:03:36,423
dropped dead of heart problems
right after they turned 40.

30
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,133
Look who turns 40 next week.

31
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,305
- I can refer you to a cardiologist...
- I've been there, all of them.

32
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,708
I spent my early 30s
going from one doctor to another.

33
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:45,458
All says my heart's fine.

34
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,393
- They're wrong?
- I know it.

35
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,896
But what can I do? At a certain point,
you got to live your life.

36
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,335
By live your life,
you mean risk your life.

37
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,186
If there is something wrong,

38
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,152
I know a doctor who will find it.

39
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:04,827
Oh, God!
I'll be back in ten.

40
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,666
I'm picking lint out
of my belly button.

41
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:11,000
This is ridiculous.
I'm converting the study into a bedroom.

42
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,544
Six weeks.

43
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,337
Longer than I thought
it would take...

44
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,251
for you to notice
that I'm sleeping in your living room,

45
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,176
- and offer other options.
- I didn't expect you this long.

46
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,859
True, but that's not
why you didn't extend the invitation.

47
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:25,983
Do you really need
to deconstruct this?

48
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,309
You didn't want me to sleep
where you and Amber slept.

49
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:29,953
- You do.
- After she died,

50
00:04:30,078 --> 00:04:33,074
you converted the study to a bedroom
and the bedroom to a study...

51
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,608
Except it's not a study,
it's a shrine.

52
00:04:36,748 --> 00:04:38,348
Can I tell you something?

53
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,363
I wasn't picking lint out
of my belly button.

54
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:43,527
I am not ready to transition

55
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,386
from my dead girlfriend's shrine

56
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:47,286
to your... morning glory.

57
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,955
I'll have a mattress delivered for you
in the tabernacle.

58
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:52,826
I just need it Tuesdays
for animal sacrifices.

59
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,427
Oh, man!

60
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,740
Patient's a genetic time bomb.

61
00:05:01,678 --> 00:05:03,469
There's no fuse.
He's not a bomb.

62
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:05,476
Right now he's not a patient either.

63
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:08,098
We ignore
three generations of cardiac problems?

64
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:11,028
I'm not ignoring it.
I'm labeling it a coincidence.

65
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:12,918
You hate coincidence.

66
00:05:13,244 --> 00:05:15,940
We reconciled.
It was a whole thing. Big country.

67
00:05:16,109 --> 00:05:17,691
It's probable that someone

68
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,487
has 3 generations that died around 40
with nongenetic heart issues.

69
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:24,010
- Dice have no memory.
- Genes do.

70
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:27,394
If we ran tests on every nonsymptomatic
statistical anomaly...

71
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:29,995
The guy goes every day assuming
his life will end at age 40.

72
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:31,705
Never got married, no kids,

73
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,375
because he didn't want to die on them
like his dad died on him.

74
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,919
You want to take this case 'cause
he's yet another lonely, sad puppy.

75
00:05:38,044 --> 00:05:40,410
- You should have been a vet.
- It's a legitimate case.

76
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,917
Differential diagnosis
for genetic heart conditions.

77
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:45,427
That sold you?

78
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,304
- Marfan syndrome, brugada.
- And you?

79
00:05:47,473 --> 00:05:49,019
Emilio hypercholesterolemia.

80
00:05:49,144 --> 00:05:51,392
He's agreeing with you
'cause he wants to have sex.

81
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,899
And by the way, I agree with you too,
especially in those pants.

82
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,690
We're not wasting our time.

83
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,192
And last week, Chase said
that I was the <i>de facto</i> boss.

84
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,652
Hospitals don't recognize
<i>de facto</i> medical licenses.

85
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:04,738
Let's start with genetic tests.
Get an EKG, cardiac cath...

86
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,032
And an echo to check
the integrity of his heart.

87
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,549
I'll start on blood samples.

88
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,943
- I forgot my watch.
- Could have sworn I saw you put it.

89
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:31,352
Must be in the locker room.
I'll be right back.

90
00:06:36,953 --> 00:06:40,013
- I need to knowyour plans.
- First we take Berlin.

91
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:42,693
And then we circle around behind Poland
and yell, "surprise!"

92
00:06:42,923 --> 00:06:44,611
With regards to your employment.

93
00:06:45,278 --> 00:06:47,140
I like things the way they are.

94
00:06:47,265 --> 00:06:49,140
I get just enough puzzle to solve

95
00:06:49,265 --> 00:06:52,369
without the scornful visits
from you... until now.

96
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,292
Pretend time's been going on
long enough.

97
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,581
I don't have a license.
All I can do is pretend.

98
00:06:56,706 --> 00:06:59,501
And I'm gonna have payroll send you over
some pretend checks starting tomorrow.

99
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:03,145
You need to complete 120 hours
of rounds to re-qualify.

100
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:06,967
I don't.

101
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:10,262
I'm not saying you don't win.
I'm just saying do you really need

102
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,532
to punish me by making me carry
a clipboard for your lackey of the week?

103
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:16,892
It's a state requirement.
I must certify that you've completed...

104
00:07:17,017 --> 00:07:17,869
Exactly.

105
00:07:17,994 --> 00:07:20,056
The requirement sets out
what you have to do...

106
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:22,900
Certify, which you can do
with one hand tied behind your back.

107
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,568
If you want to tie my hands...

108
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,279
Dr. Singh supervises
rounds on Thursdays,

109
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:28,872
starts at 7:00.

110
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:36,963
Nothing.

111
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:38,499
So what now?

112
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,335
- Send him home.
- To continue believing he's gonna die?

113
00:07:41,621 --> 00:07:43,545
When he turns 70, he'll believe us.

114
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,839
There are other things we can check.

115
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:48,234
Skeleton of great-Grandfather's
in decent shape.

116
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:50,904
Subsurface genetic material
from grandpa's fine,

117
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:52,780
leaving one bowl of purified dad.

118
00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:55,848
You do the dad.
I take it he had a sealed casket.

119
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,753
The watch story was crap, right?

120
00:08:00,281 --> 00:08:01,320
I forgot it.

121
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:02,969
It's no big deal.

122
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:05,745
You were avoiding the ICU
where Dibala died.

123
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:10,041
I'll sequence the gene
for the cardiac sodium channel.

124
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:13,575
I felt like I was gonna have
a panic attack.

125
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,912
I've crossed some line...

126
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:22,126
And I'm having trouble
getting back to the other side.

127
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:25,975
I can move the patient
to another room.

128
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,757
- Cameron will ask questions.
- You should tell her.

129
00:08:29,352 --> 00:08:30,585
She's your wife.

130
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,591
How'd you get a court order
to dig them up so fast?

131
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:40,394
We just needed the guy's consent.

132
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,770
- Anything?
- Not yet.

133
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,211
But you're just in time
to do the dad.

134
00:08:49,105 --> 00:08:51,543
- Doctor House?
- He'll be back in the morning.

135
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,419
I read in the paper
you're treating a police officer.

136
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:57,161
- Donny Compson?
- 2nd floor. A nurse will help you.

137
00:08:57,866 --> 00:08:59,419
I don't want to see him.

138
00:08:59,544 --> 00:09:01,863
Donny and I used to go out
a long time ago.

139
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,672
We doesn't want to see each other.

140
00:09:03,797 --> 00:09:05,846
So did you come to see me
for personal advice?

141
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:07,587
You're looking
for genetic conditions,

142
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:10,360
which makes sense, with what happened
to his dad and grandpa.

143
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,628
Unless you were his girlfriend
and his sister,

144
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,887
- you got nothing to worry about.
- Not about me.

145
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:17,833
Donny doesn't know this,
but he has a son.

146
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,909
Dial extension 742.

147
00:09:24,034 --> 00:09:26,106
Tell Dr. Foreman
you got some cool information.

148
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,317
Good night.

149
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:25,393
You okay?

150
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,300
Yeah, fine.

151
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,978
Couldn't find
any consistent genetic mutations

152
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:03,620
across 15 areas
between Donny's ancestors,

153
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,587
- possibly indicating there isn't one.
- But the son gives us a new data point.

154
00:11:06,712 --> 00:11:07,833
And undegraded DNA.

155
00:11:08,002 --> 00:11:09,369
- He didn't want kids.
- Yes.

156
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:11,792
- Where's House?
- "Dear bleeding hearts,

157
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:14,591
"Since your patient's med history
is a coincidence,

158
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,843
"And he isn't...

159
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,158
"sick, I've gone back to school.

160
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:23,113
- "Back in 120 hours."
- Charming. I'll get a blood sample.

161
00:11:23,238 --> 00:11:25,350
If we're looking for something
as subtle as a mutation,

162
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,594
It makes sense to get
the DNA the most pure.

163
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:29,980
You'll ask her
to consent to a bone marrow biopsy?

164
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,566
She wants to know
just as badly as we do.

165
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,659
Right.

166
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:36,001
Spike a ten-year-old's hip
because grandpa was sick.

167
00:11:36,126 --> 00:11:38,484
If she's right...
We save two people.

168
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,950
I don't want to.

169
00:11:46,837 --> 00:11:48,457
Can we speak outside?

170
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,854
You need to tell him.

171
00:11:59,945 --> 00:12:00,844
I can't.

172
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,231
His father is down that hallway
through those double doors.

173
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:06,053
I've been lying to him his whole life.
What's he gonna think of me?

174
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:07,970
You're trying to protect him.

175
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,859
Donny never wanted kids.

176
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:14,409
- He certainly doesn't want to meet him.
- If Donny does die,

177
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,490
this could be Michael's only chance
to meet his father.

178
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:32,924
After administration of immunoglobulin,
patient had no further pain,

179
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:35,670
and overnight liver function tests
are now normal.

180
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,513
Patient's ready to be released.

181
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:39,931
- Stats are dropping.
- Dr. Singh?

182
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,268
She's choking.

183
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,875
- On your fingers.
- She can't breathe.

184
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:47,752
Please take your finger
off the test button.

185
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,561
I see.
Sorry about that.

186
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:55,003
- I could've slit her throat.
- We're all here to learn.

187
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,776
- Dr. Cuddy warned me.
- She tell you how to stop me?

188
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:01,405
Look, I'm asking you
as an adult to please stop.

189
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,825
That obviously didn't come from her.
But fair enough.

190
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,780
Excellent presentation, Nona.

191
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,759
Now I've done it.

192
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,941
There's urine everywhere!

193
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,869
Gosh. The great thing
about the teacher-student relationship

194
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,297
is the teacher can often learn more
from the student.

195
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:23,529
Have you learned anything yet?

196
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:29,766
You have a son.

197
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:33,311
I was pregnant when we broke up.

198
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,189
I'm sorry I never told you, but I knew
how you felt about kids.

199
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,088
You had no right.

200
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:40,213
Maybe.

201
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:42,439
It's a little late for that.

202
00:13:47,025 --> 00:13:48,091
He's here.

203
00:13:48,216 --> 00:13:50,328
- He wants to meet you.
- I don't want.

204
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:52,455
I've never asked you for a dime.

205
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,250
He's here to help find
whatever's wrong with your heart.

206
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:56,769
I didn't ask him.

207
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:59,347
- I didn't want him.
- Just say hi to him.

208
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:17,392
I'm Michael.

209
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:22,276
I'm your...

210
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,246
Yeah, your mother told me.

211
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:27,699
When you get better,

212
00:14:28,881 --> 00:14:30,781
maybe we could do something.

213
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,170
See a movie?

214
00:14:40,388 --> 00:14:41,922
My dad died when I was your age.

215
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:44,596
It was the most painful thing
I ever went through.

216
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:47,969
Trust me, as much as I'm sure
this hurts right now, It's better.

217
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:52,057
Please take him out of here.

218
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,944
Chromosomes
for 28 cardiovascular conditions

219
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,820
are normally numbered in structure.

220
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,948
No translocations,
deletions, or inversions.

221
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,326
I didn't notice
that the kid's D-A-D-D-Y chromosome

222
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,937
has been severely damaged

223
00:15:13,062 --> 00:15:14,895
by someone's
bleeding heart chromosome.

224
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,101
It was the only way
to do the biopsy.

225
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,718
There are plenty of lies
that would've worked just as well,

226
00:15:19,843 --> 00:15:21,900
- Without the therapy.
- Don't you have school?

227
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:22,963
Recess.

228
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:25,233
Where does that leave us?

229
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,190
Sorry. What?

230
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:32,264
I was saying, "do you think these shoes
work in this color?"

231
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:35,036
- Send him home.
- He won't think he's healthy.

232
00:15:35,161 --> 00:15:37,018
You're not very good at your job.

233
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,980
- You don't deserve candy.
- He's been preparing his whole life

234
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:42,819
to die at 40.
Dozens of doctors told him he's fine.

235
00:15:42,944 --> 00:15:46,944
- You think you can change his thinking?
- I do. Chase, walk with me.

236
00:15:49,138 --> 00:15:51,188
Great contributions back there.

237
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,617
There's no case.
I had nothing to add.

238
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,871
You had nothing to add
because you were distracted.

239
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,665
A little devil on your shoulder

240
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,501
told you to kill a guy,
and the little angel won't shut up,

241
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,114
telling you you're gonna burn
in a lake of fire.

242
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,214
- I'm fine.
- You shouldn't be.

243
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,100
Talk to someone.

244
00:16:09,647 --> 00:16:11,747
Docs fixed me up in seven weeks.

245
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:15,348
You're ten minutes, tops.

246
00:16:17,094 --> 00:16:18,094
Thanks.

247
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,771
Glad we had this little moment.
Come on.

248
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,716
I'm Dr. House.

249
00:16:25,841 --> 00:16:29,070
- You couldn't find anything, could you?
- You have Ortoli syndrome.

250
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:30,831
Dr. Chase?

251
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,241
- You sure?
- Tests don't lie.

252
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:41,687
It's a very rare disorder

253
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,960
that short-circuits the adrenals,

254
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,996
which short-circuits the heart.

255
00:16:46,517 --> 00:16:49,071
Who cares about medical Mumbo Jumbo?
Tell him the treatment.

256
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:50,091
It's...

257
00:16:51,057 --> 00:16:52,218
It's complicated.

258
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:54,867
Doctors always make everything
sound complicated.

259
00:16:54,992 --> 00:16:56,242
It's Nabasynth.

260
00:16:57,006 --> 00:16:58,556
- What?
- Nabasynth.

261
00:17:00,612 --> 00:17:03,647
So all we have to do now
is write a prescription

262
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,874
and have him pick up the pills.

263
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:14,901
That's it?

264
00:17:16,385 --> 00:17:18,286
I take some pills, and I'll be okay?

265
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:21,666
The real tragedy here
is that the Tiburon swab technology

266
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,334
didn't exist to detect Ortoli
back in your dad's day.

267
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:29,404
He could've lived.

268
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:35,749
Thank you.

269
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,686
If you sign these discharge papers,

270
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:46,147
I'll get you a bottle of meds.
Take one twice a day for a week,

271
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,465
you'll live a long, healthy life.

272
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:26,896
Answer the door, House,
it's got to be for you.

273
00:18:27,492 --> 00:18:29,858
- Are you watching TV?
- It's the door!

274
00:18:34,852 --> 00:18:37,031
Were you on the phone?
Were you talking?

275
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,324
No, I'm alone.

276
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,577
You okay?

277
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:45,707
Why are you here?

278
00:18:46,783 --> 00:18:49,406
Donny collapsed four hours
after we discharged him.

279
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:50,531
He's dead.

280
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:55,979


281
00:18:56,891 --> 00:18:59,554
His apartment manager found him
in the laundry room.

282
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:01,472
Said he wasn't breathing.

283
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:03,975
He called the EMTs
but it was too late.

284
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,103
I sent the guy home with mints.

285
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,023
Whatever it is, we all missed it.

286
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:13,297
I missed the fact
that there was something to miss.

287
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,379
What is wrong with me?

288
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:18,587
You had good reason.

289
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:22,535
Patient presented with no symptoms,
and all his tests came back negative.

290
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:25,497
What's the official COD?

291
00:19:26,603 --> 00:19:28,541
Autopsy hasn't been performed yet.

292
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,686
EMTs brought him to General

293
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:35,173
but I requested they ship him back
to our morgue for the postmortem.

294
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:38,690
Good.

295
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,089
Hon. Wake up.

296
00:19:47,957 --> 00:19:49,395
Why are you dressed?

297
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:50,929
You can't sleep?

298
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:53,654
I want to go tell Cheryl
that Donny died.

299
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,987
- It's 4:00 in the morning.
- They're nearly two hours away.

300
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,072
By the time I get there,
she'll be awake.

301
00:20:00,197 --> 00:20:01,407
Come back to bed.

302
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,480
Call her in a few hours.

303
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:07,553
It's the sort of thing
she needs to hear face-to-face.

304
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:15,713
Is everything okay?

305
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:17,882
Everything's fine.

306
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,914
Why?

307
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,809
Last week, I understood
that you were stressed out

308
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,705
about the Dibala m and m,
and I gave you your space.

309
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,730
But that's over now,
and you're still acting...

310
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:31,896
I'm worried about you.

311
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:34,742
Don't be.

312
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,277
I'm fine.

313
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:38,521
Really.

314
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:40,864
You'd tell me if you weren't?

315
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:44,162
Promise?

316
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:56,373
I love you.

317
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:58,734
I love you too.

318
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:08,516
Donny Compson.

319
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,684
Age 39.

320
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:32,790
Can we cut to the money shot?

321
00:21:33,304 --> 00:21:35,835
It's his heart,
so let's look at his heart.

322
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:37,455
Nice Y-incision.

323
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,090
You can't perform an autopsy
without a license.

324
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:42,476
Really?

325
00:21:43,211 --> 00:21:46,802
There's anything I could screw up
that we haven't already screwed up.

326
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:57,453
Opening postmortem incision,
beginning at the midline of the sternum.

327
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:09,994
That's odd.

328
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,279
It almost looks like he's bleeding.

329
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,305
I think the autopsy
is gonna wait a little bit.

330
00:22:31,305 --> 00:22:32,119


331
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,973
He was briefly conscious, his systolic
dipped below 60, and he was out.

332
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,232
Differential diagnosis
for resurrection.

333
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,942
- Go.
- He wasn't dead.

334
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,944
His heart slowed enough
that the EMTs...

335
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:46,093
The fact that he's not dead
means we did nothing wrong.

336
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:49,450
There's several documented cases
where tetrodotoxin ingestion

337
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,082
- caused apparent death.
- It's something he already had.

338
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:53,679
And his dad, and his grandpa.

339
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:56,783
Extreme bradycardia
could be caused by sick sinus syndrome.

340
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,847
- Sinoatrial block.
- What if it's not his heart?

341
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:02,956
Let's work
from the tenuous assumption

342
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,758
that we're not idiots who've spent days
examining a heart

343
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,468
up, down, sideways,

344
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,512
declaring it healthy a few hours
before it basically shut down.

345
00:23:10,637 --> 00:23:13,772
So we need to think about causes
in places you didn't look.

346
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,609
Could be metabolic.

347
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:20,197
You okay?

348
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:28,281
What about a genetic predisposition
to an autoimmune disease?

349
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,136
Isolated anti-ro antibody
could cause complete heart block.

350
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:33,161
Could also be passed
through four generations.

351
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,822
Autoimmune it is.
Start him on steroids.

352
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:44,236
How you feeling?

353
00:23:45,487 --> 00:23:46,716
My head is killing me.

354
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:50,564
You just came through
a severe trauma.

355
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:52,631
What do you remember?

356
00:23:56,597 --> 00:23:59,347
I was changing my laundry
over to the dryer.

357
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:03,206
That's it?
You were declared dead.

358
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:05,234
You made it all the way to autopsy.

359
00:24:06,725 --> 00:24:07,653
My jaw aches.

360
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,607
And obviously
I don't have Ortoli syndrome.

361
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,343
It's hard to get too excited
about coming back from the dead

362
00:24:16,468 --> 00:24:18,182
when anything I do,
anything you give me,

363
00:24:18,307 --> 00:24:20,057
it all ends the same way.

364
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,393
Outer and middle ear respond well.
Hearing thresholds are normal.

365
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,729
- Eardrum is perfectly healthy.
- What if I...

366
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:44,816
If I sometimes hear whispering?

367
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,070
Then you're probably hearing
someone whispering.

368
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:51,280
I had some dental work done
in the Philippines when I was a kid.

369
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,784
Adjoining metal fillings could corrode
and pick up AM radio signals.

370
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,046
Open your mouth.

371
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,963
Your fillings don't touch.

372
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:03,918
There's no reason for me
to be hearing things.

373
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,003
You're hearing sounds as you should.

374
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,798
If you're hearing sounds you shouldn't,
that would be psychosis.

375
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,384
Talk to someone who does brain.
I only do ears.

376
00:25:21,117 --> 00:25:22,004
<i>Bravo!</i>

377
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,900
It's amazing how you did 120 hours
in one day.

378
00:25:26,717 --> 00:25:29,167
I wasn't on my best behavior,
I admit.

379
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:30,567
Allow me.

380
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,615
I'm gonna supervise
your practicum requirement.

381
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,285
- That won't be necessary.
- Wanna annoy another doctor?

382
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,310
- Eventually...
- It's not necessary,

383
00:25:39,435 --> 00:25:41,725
because I'm not ready
to be a doctor again.

384
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:45,745
I'm sorry.

385
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,064
- Are you sleeping out here?
- Just dozed off in front of the TV.

386
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:11,861
- With bedding?
- Maybe!

387
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,781
I can't sleep in there.
The heater's screwed up.

388
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:19,713
If you need to talk,
if you need more help...

389
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,162
I'm just tired.

390
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,456
I'm right here.

391
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:24,639
Great.

392
00:26:24,764 --> 00:26:26,918
Can you be right here
somewhere else?

393
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,700
My jaw still hurts.

394
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:37,970
My tooth, actually, a lot.

395
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,014
Sorry, you're maxed out
on your pain meds.

396
00:26:40,302 --> 00:26:41,452
Try to sleep.

397
00:27:03,883 --> 00:27:04,747


398
00:27:05,303 --> 00:27:07,355
Dentist looked at the tooth
the guy pulled out.

399
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,324
There was nothing wrong.

400
00:27:09,449 --> 00:27:12,021
So aside from him being an idiot,
what else have we learned?

401
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:14,663
The pain is real.
It's coming from somewhere.

402
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:16,418
What about bone cancer?

403
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:18,681
You can't connect bone cancer
to the heart.

404
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:20,677
House figure
this can wait till the morning?

405
00:27:20,802 --> 00:27:23,202
He told Cuddy
he's not ready to work.

406
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:24,422
He quit?

407
00:27:24,822 --> 00:27:26,560
- Apparently.
- It's a power play.

408
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,144
He'll be back tomorrow.

409
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:30,797
Bone cancer could trigger
a paraneoplastic syndrome,

410
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:34,595
- which shuts down the heart.
- Primary bone cancer isn't hereditary.

411
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,672
Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
It's hereditary

412
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:38,656
and increases risk
of having bone cancer.

413
00:27:42,242 --> 00:27:45,621
- You have another theory?
- My theory is it's not bone cancer.

414
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,666
Gamma survey
would locate the tumors.

415
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:07,036
I had pea soup today.

416
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:10,498
You'd love my breath right now.

417
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:13,516
I didn't get a chance
to run tonight, House...

418
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:15,683
is having issues.

419
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,789
I missed you a lot today.

420
00:29:21,438 --> 00:29:23,038
All I want to do is...

421
00:29:26,428 --> 00:29:27,428
You know.

422
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:35,132
No cancers
on the lateral cuneiform bone.

423
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,255
Navicular's also clean.

424
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:39,462
Chase is lying to me.

425
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,018
And I know you know.

426
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,199
- Tell me what's going on.
- I'm gonna tell you what I told him...

427
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:47,289
Talk to your spouse.

428
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,001
No breakfast?

429
00:29:56,872 --> 00:29:57,851
Not today.

430
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:00,384
I'm hallucinating.

431
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:05,037
What happened?

432
00:30:05,162 --> 00:30:07,100
It's nothing visual this time.

433
00:30:08,198 --> 00:30:09,517
I hear whispering.

434
00:30:10,265 --> 00:30:12,101
Is that why you've been
acting so weird?

435
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:14,061
- Why you quit?
- I'm losing it.

436
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,789
There's a rational explanation.

437
00:30:16,914 --> 00:30:19,567
- The wind? A neighbor's TV?
- I checked everything.

438
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,824
What's scary
is that I hear whispering

439
00:30:21,949 --> 00:30:23,499
while not on vicodin.

440
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,474
I'm gonna check myself
back into Mayfield.

441
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,796
You don't think there might be
a logical explanation?

442
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:43,507
- Something I missed?
- You're the smartest guy I know.

443
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,551
If you haven't thought of it,
it doesn't exist.

444
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:49,346
I'll drive you over.
I just need to make some tea first.

445
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:54,406
You know.

446
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:57,435
That you're an ass?

447
00:30:58,185 --> 00:31:00,107
You overheard me
talking to my dead girlfriend

448
00:31:00,346 --> 00:31:03,319
and thought to yourself,
"What kind of fun can I have with this?"

449
00:31:03,721 --> 00:31:06,113
Why are you talking to her?
You run out of living people?

450
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,076
- You can talk to me. I'm right here.
- I miss her.

451
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,855
Talking to her makes me feel better.
You don't.

452
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,854
Patient Lauren Maybaum, 27,

453
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:20,544
presented two days ago
with severe abdominal pain.

454
00:31:21,199 --> 00:31:22,300
Sorry I'm late.

455
00:31:22,518 --> 00:31:24,715
- Yesterday you said you weren't ready.
- I wasn't.

456
00:31:25,111 --> 00:31:26,707
- Today I am.
- And tomorrow

457
00:31:26,832 --> 00:31:28,761
is it possible
to get a five-day forecast?

458
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,138
I'm feeling much better.
Thank you for not asking.

459
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:34,347
Either you did have a problem...
which I can't ignore.

460
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:37,238
Or you were jerking me around,
which I can't ignore.

461
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,212
You are a woman.
You can do anything.

462
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:41,774
For example,
I can talk to you outside.

463
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:47,788
Are you sure you're only one woman?

464
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:54,241
This is the part where you play
the employee, and I play the boss.

465
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:56,476
I can see your nipples.
Your turn.

466
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:58,931
No wonder she hates him.

467
00:32:00,035 --> 00:32:02,356
That's not hate.
It's foreplay.

468
00:32:06,755 --> 00:32:08,300
Gamma survey revealed no tumors.

469
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:10,475
So it's not bone cancer.

470
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:12,233
Where's Chase?

471
00:32:12,718 --> 00:32:13,768
Don't know.

472
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:16,183
Two mysteries, cool.

473
00:32:17,222 --> 00:32:18,172
Theories?

474
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:22,690
Did I come in too soon?

475
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,698
Okay, I'm gonna take another lap.

476
00:32:24,823 --> 00:32:27,027
And I want three new ideas
by the time I come back.

477
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,248
One of them's got to be not stupid.

478
00:32:33,522 --> 00:32:35,072
Where there's pain...

479
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,850
there's nerves.

480
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:41,137
Hereditary sensory
autonomic neuropathy, type one.

481
00:32:41,262 --> 00:32:44,712
Miscommunication in the brain stem
mistakes nerve pain for tooth pain.

482
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,798
- It would explain the bradycardia.
- And I like the word "hereditary".

483
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:49,373
Carbamazepine fixes him.

484
00:32:49,498 --> 00:32:51,427
I'll get him started
on the medication.

485
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,167
Chase specifically asked
if he could do it.

486
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,750
Sleep at home.

487
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,732
So I didn't do the gamma survey.

488
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,300
Is it bone cancer?

489
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,127
Congratulate me
for not wasting your time.

490
00:33:09,252 --> 00:33:10,654
Are you getting some help?

491
00:33:10,893 --> 00:33:13,412
Or is this the way things
are gonna be from now on?

492
00:33:13,537 --> 00:33:16,187
What's pathetic is
you haven't gotten help

493
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:18,954
because you want to feel bad.

494
00:33:19,408 --> 00:33:20,748
You want to suffer,

495
00:33:20,986 --> 00:33:23,334
'cause if you feel guilty,
then you're not a psychopath.

496
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,836
Patient needs some Carbamazepine.

497
00:33:26,108 --> 00:33:28,787
Now, I don't care
how much that room scares you,

498
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:31,087
you're doing your job.

499
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:48,416
How long before you cross
this one off the list?

500
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:51,904
A couple of hours.

501
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:57,493
You ever shoot anyone?

502
00:33:58,363 --> 00:33:59,203
Twice.

503
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:02,003
You ever kill anyone?

504
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:06,126
I know a few guys who did, though.

505
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,019
Did they ever get over it?

506
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:10,706
A captain I know compares it
to taking out the trash,

507
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:12,115
like it's nothing.

508
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:16,795
Other hand, I got an ex-partner
who nearly drank himself into oblivion.

509
00:34:17,954 --> 00:34:18,972
Did he get help?

510
00:34:21,298 --> 00:34:22,648
Help didn't help.

511
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:29,785
God!

512
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,568
What is it?

513
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:34,036
I went to the bathroom.

514
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:40,202
Patient's lost bowel control.

515
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:43,747
Means we were wrong about h-san,
and it means he's getting worse fast.

516
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:47,084
Wouldn't want to be the duty nurse
assigned to his floor. Get it?

517
00:34:47,617 --> 00:34:48,585
"Doody" nurse?

518
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,393
Fine.
Do the doctor thing.

519
00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:53,781
- An autoimmune disorder could...
- We put him on steroids.

520
00:34:53,906 --> 00:34:56,358
- He didn't respond. It's not that.
- Could be Wilson's disease.

521
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:58,095

That would've hit the liver.

522
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,390
It is possible the liver's so far gone,
the labs look normal.

523
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,167
It's worth a shot.

524
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:06,061
Go treat with Penicillamine.

525
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,836
When he doesn't get better,
come back quickly,

526
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:11,799
so we can get one more shot at it.

527
00:35:16,595 --> 00:35:18,945
Bless me, father, for I have sinned.

528
00:35:24,845 --> 00:35:26,080
Take your time.

529
00:35:28,616 --> 00:35:30,793
How long has it been
since your last confession?

530
00:35:30,918 --> 00:35:32,168
I killed a man.

531
00:35:35,314 --> 00:35:37,287
But it was the right thing to do.

532
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:42,389
Who lives or dies
is not your decision to make.

533
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:46,143
Sometimes in the operating room
it feels like it.

534
00:35:47,077 --> 00:35:48,227
I'm a doctor.

535
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:51,606
Then you should know
more than anybody

536
00:35:52,099 --> 00:35:54,249
that every human life is sacred.

537
00:35:55,468 --> 00:35:56,219
Why?

538
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:59,372
Tell me what's sacred
about a dictator

539
00:35:59,497 --> 00:36:02,501
that kills hundreds
of thousands of his own people.

540
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:05,550
What is sacred about a doctor
who kills a patient?

541
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,819
Is it the slippery slope
you're worried about?

542
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:15,518
Afraid that forgiving me for killing

543
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:18,331
the worst person on Earth
sets a bad precedent?

544
00:36:19,308 --> 00:36:20,408
I promise...

545
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:22,826
I won't tell anyone.

546
00:36:29,567 --> 00:36:30,867
Just forgive me.

547
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,303
Saying ten hail Mary
isn't gonna do you any good.

548
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:38,272
Then what do I have to do?

549
00:36:39,354 --> 00:36:42,005
What does God need me to do?

550
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:44,120
You can't have absolution

551
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,595
without first taking responsibility.

552
00:36:46,927 --> 00:36:49,138
You have to turn yourself
into the police.

553
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:50,113
What...

554
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:53,068
And go to jail
for the rest of my life?

555
00:36:53,193 --> 00:36:54,723
What's just about that?

556
00:36:57,746 --> 00:36:59,657
I did the right thing.

557
00:37:00,771 --> 00:37:02,674
There has to be another way.

558
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:05,799
You want absolution,
I've told you how to get it.

559
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:30,875
Send this
into the state licensing board.

560
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,983
I've signed off on all your hours.

561
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:36,211
- Why?
- Because it's easier this way.

562
00:37:36,986 --> 00:37:38,338
You're uncomfortable.

563
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,717
Going by the book was pointless.
You were gonna learn nothing.

564
00:37:43,842 --> 00:37:46,096
Good, I thought it was
because of the sexual tension.

565
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,098
- There was no sexual tension.
- There was.

566
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:51,768
And... it made me feel funny, so...

567
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:53,145
Here.

568
00:37:57,258 --> 00:37:58,508
That's too bad.

569
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:02,026
I was kind of getting
into the whole hot-for-teacher thing.

570
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:04,615
You sure you're okay?

571
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:07,284
Yeah.
False alarm.

572
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:11,670
What about us?

573
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:13,665
We're good...

574
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:16,960
just like this. You press my buttons,
I press yours.

575
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,178
You mean...

576
00:38:32,815 --> 00:38:34,615
You do make me feel funny.

577
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,987
You're not gonna die.

578
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,396
I've accepted it.

579
00:38:46,521 --> 00:38:47,521
It's okay.

580
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:51,468
In addition to high arches

581
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:53,872
and some crystal bowl
in the shape of a tuna,

582
00:38:54,142 --> 00:38:57,359
you also inherited
a self-destruct button.

583
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,840
It forms in the brain stem.

584
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,249
Technically, it's an aneurysm.
Presses on the nerves,

585
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,385
that control everything
from tooth pain to heart rate.

586
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:09,262
As you get older, it gets bigger,
until finally...

587
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:12,797
the button which I'll call
intracranial berry aneurysm,

588
00:39:12,922 --> 00:39:15,124
'cause I had a friend
in high school with that name...

589
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:17,313
stops the signal
from your brain to your heart.

590
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,757
And bam!

591
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:22,316
How do I know
you're not still lying?

592
00:39:22,441 --> 00:39:24,340
Saying I'm healthy
to make me feel better?

593
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,276
It does sound that way, doesn't it?

594
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:28,240
But this time, no sugar pills.

595
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,159
I'm gonna cut into your brain
to make you think that I'm fixing it.

596
00:39:31,772 --> 00:39:33,985
And if our fake tests confirm it,

597
00:39:34,202 --> 00:39:36,263
I'm gonna be cutting
into your son's brain too,

598
00:39:36,388 --> 00:39:37,916
'cause I'm just that committed.

599
00:39:38,714 --> 00:39:40,043
Michael's gonna be okay?

600
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:44,286
Unless he walks out of here
and gets run over by a bus,

601
00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:47,031
in which case, I will reconsider
your fate argument.

602
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:50,512
You want to give him a call?

603
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,149
Visiting hours
don't apply to my patients.

604
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:56,162
In a bit.

605
00:39:59,183 --> 00:40:00,784
That's what I thought.

606
00:40:01,485 --> 00:40:04,389
The "saving the kid
from pain" stuff was crap.

607
00:40:04,514 --> 00:40:06,833
You don't want anything in your life
that won't let you do

608
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:09,239
whatever whenever the hell
you want to do it.

609
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,370
You've had it easy.

610
00:40:11,964 --> 00:40:13,564
Sorry to screw you up.

611
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,634
Maybe when we get out of here...

612
00:40:55,815 --> 00:40:57,434
What kind of movies you like?

613
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,910
He's been missing for eight hours.
Robert Chase.

614
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,974
Never mind, he walked in, sorry.

615
00:41:18,574 --> 00:41:20,099
You could've called me.

616
00:41:20,571 --> 00:41:22,771
- I forgot.
- To call me? It's 2:00 in the morning.

617
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,189
Where were you?

618
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,007
You're drunk.

619
00:41:26,132 --> 00:41:27,192
All right, I...

620
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:31,073
I needed to get wasted.
I did.

621
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:33,782
And now I'm better.

622
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:37,119
- What aren't you telling me?
- Nothing.

623
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,780
Hi, Dad.

624
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:31,049
Like I've been...

625
00:42:32,581 --> 00:42:34,431
focusing on the wrong thing...

626
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,446
on the worst of good times.

627
00:42:46,036 --> 00:42:47,286
This is stupid.

628
00:42:49,892 --> 00:42:50,892
You see...

629
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,003
he really is getting better.

630
00:42:54,499 --> 00:42:56,952
