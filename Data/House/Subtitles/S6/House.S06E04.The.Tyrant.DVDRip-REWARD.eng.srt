1
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:06,902
We will anger the Americans
slipping out like this.

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,933
If your son
was a student

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,410
at one of the greatest
universities in the world...

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:14,572
So make him
come to you.

5
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:16,678
We are protected
near the UN.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,149
But once we cross
42nd Street...

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:21,381
As always, I appreciate
your caution, Joseph.

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:24,514
But as always, you
have far too much of it.

9
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,805
Stay down, sir.

10
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,253
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

11
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,084
I'm just
serving process!

12
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,356
Your boss is being sued
under Title 18

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,126
of the United States Code,
section 1350,

14
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:10,829
for genocide, crimes against
humanity, and torture.

15
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:19,305
Mr. President, this is
only a civil lawsuit.

16
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,971
We can ignore it.

17
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,545
Mr. President.

18
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,085
You want us
to work for Foreman?

19
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,717
Not permanently.

20
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:08,988
He is setting up
interviews

21
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,359
to replace Taub
and Thirteen,

22
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,897
but it might take
a couple of weeks.

23
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,399
Well, what happened
to them?

24
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,492
He quit, and I had to let her go.

25
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,469
You actually fired
your girlfriend?

26
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,630
Yes.

27
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:20,866
You two are
both competent,

28
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,066
and I know I can
work with you.

29
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,201
You really do know
how to woo.

30
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:26,074
I need you.

31
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,545
It would be interesting.

32
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,774
And we could
work together.

33
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,577
Did you see who
the patient is?

34
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,709
That's one of the reasons
it'll be interesting.

35
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:35,652
Dibala is one of the most
repressive dictators in the world.

36
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,747
You had no problem
treating a guy on death row.

37
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,621
Who was still in prison
after we patched him up.

38
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,023
We fix Dibala,
he gets on a plane

39
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,391
and executes
half his country.

40
00:02:42,462 --> 00:02:44,692
He's been repressing an
ethnic rebellion in the south,

41
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,857
the Sitibi people.

42
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,724
It's getting worse.

43
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:51,235
Dibala is a guest
of the US government,

44
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:53,499
and he's been invited
to speak at the UN.

45
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,040
I'm not asking
you to love him,

46
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,406
I'm asking you
to do your job.

47
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,338
Utterly incomprehensible.

48
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,584
And, of course, I'm talking
about you firing your girlfriend.

49
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,643
We weren't getting along
with her working under me.

50
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,620
This'll help. Cameron
and I worked together.

51
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,883
But you weren't
her boss,

52
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:12,618
and you stopped
working together.

53
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,455
Why don't you just tell her
you were wrong and...

54
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,256
Because I wasn't.

55
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,887
I know how
this looks.

56
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,761
I know it might
break us up.

57
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,561
But that's better than
definitely breaking us up,

58
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,432
which is what would've
happened otherwise.

59
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,200
Hemorrhagic
ulcers in the lungs.

60
00:03:31,744 --> 00:03:34,907
Oh, my God,
it's three years ago.

61
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,607
Does that mean
I'm still crazy?

62
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:38,673
You're back?

63
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,116
You look good.

64
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,086
We're just helping
out because... I know.

65
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,520
I just ran
into Thirteen

66
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,490
while she was
clearing out her locker.

67
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,923
My condolences.

68
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,120
Although it's not like she's
the hottest woman in the world.

69
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:52,130
We haven't broken up.
Are you back?

70
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,063
Sort of. You get your license back?

71
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:55,464
Not for a month or so.

72
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,164
So you'll be in charge, I'm
just gonna pitch in a little.

73
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:03,137
Dibala thinks it was
an assassination attempt.

74
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,040
Polonium, like the
Russian guy in London.

75
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,444
FBI checked the service of
process forms and his hotel room.

76
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,141
No radioactivity trails.

77
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,308
Acid reflux?

78
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,511
No history of
asthma or heartburn.

79
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,019
He has a bug bite
on his hands.

80
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,282
Malaria's endemic
in his country.

81
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,983
Let's start him
on Coartem.

82
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,397
I don't want to step
on any toes,

83
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,697
but I guess I do have a
higher duty to the patient.

84
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,395
If you have something
to say, say it.

85
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,835
You're rushing
to a diagnosis

86
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:32,996
because you're
rushing out of this room

87
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,630
because you're
rightly upset with me.

88
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,971
Although I wasn't the one who
made that asinine decision to...

89
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:39,568
Do you have anything
medical to say?

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,544
Poison fits better
because of the vomiting.

91
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,207
Bug bite might
not be a bite,

92
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,876
it might be
the start of chloracne.

93
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,819
Assassination attempt
through dioxin poisoning.

94
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,288
It's hard to detect.
Fits.

95
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,793
Start him on olestra.

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,265
You couldn't have just
said dioxin up front?

97
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,101
I was hoping you'd
get there on your own.

98
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,603
So, I guess we
should talk to Cuddy.

99
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,344
You are sure
it is dioxin?

100
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,246
Nope.

101
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,721
It's our best guess. The
olestra here binds to the poison,

102
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,418
flushes it out
of your system.

103
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,720
Where are you from,
doctor?

104
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:29,193
I'm Australian.

105
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,287
Do I hear a bit
of British?

106
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:33,127
Most people
don't notice it.

107
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,167
Yeah, I kicked
around there for a while.

108
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:37,031
You went to
medical school there?

109
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,866
Actually,
a year of seminary.

110
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,168
And you left.
Uh-huh.

111
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,406
There was a Catholic mission
near my childhood village.

112
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,176
I liked the priests.
They were good people.

113
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,652
But when my two younger sisters
were dying from consumption,

114
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:57,155
it wasn't more priests
we wanted.

115
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,760
I fired my girlfriend because
he said he was gone for good.

116
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,427
I need this in my life.

117
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,493
A week ago, it was the
last thing you needed.

118
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,562
It's a process.
I'm learning.

119
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:15,072
And screwing me over
as you go.

120
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,371
Yeah,
that's why I did it.

121
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,210
Sorry.

122
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,440
If you want, I'll
explain it to Thirteen.

123
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:25,609
He's not ready.
He doesn't have his license.

124
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:30,486
Then he can't practice. But we'd
be idiots not to listen to him.

125
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,582
You're in charge. He sits
in on all the differentials.

126
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,651
Until you get your license
back, this is all unofficial.

127
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,163
No procedures,
no patient contact.

128
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,092
I think I can probably deal
with that last one.

129
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,665
The only reason
I let you go

130
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,438
is because our relationship
wouldn't work

131
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,537
if I was in charge.

132
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,846
But I won't be
in charge soon

133
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,510
so I came to offer
your old job back.

134
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:07,092
I know I look bad, but
circumstances have changed.

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,320
I don't want the job.

136
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,418
Why not?

137
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:12,953
Because there's a much simpler
explanation for you firing me.

138
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,090
You wanted to
break up with me,

139
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,328
but you were too weak
to do it yourself.

140
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:19,269
Then why would I try
to hire you back?

141
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,307
Can we please get
some dinner tonight?

142
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,467
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,570
Uh...

144
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,107
You're a follow-up?

145
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:34,483
You must not treat him.

146
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:40,091
Dibala killed my wife.

147
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,752
She was a trade unionist.

148
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,923
They took her from our
home while I was at work.

149
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,025
Who took her?

150
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:52,468
Dibala's Youth
Labor League.

151
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,200
He pretends it's to get
young people off the street,

152
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,835
but he takes teenage boys
from the provinces

153
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,903
and feeds them
drugs and alcohol

154
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,642
and teaches them
how to torture.

155
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,479
They dumped her body in
my yard two weeks later.

156
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,920
They raped her.

157
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,918
<i>They carved "inyenzi",
cockroach,</i>

158
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,963
onto her stomach
because she's Sitibi.

159
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,760
I'm very sorry, but I can't
discuss other patients.

160
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,358
You should talk to a
lawyer, talk to the UN...

161
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:26,633
So they can sit and watch
like they did in Rwanda?

162
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,673
There are
two million Sitibi.

163
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:33,268
He is planning to
massacre them all.

164
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,974
His radio stations
are talking about

165
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:38,778
a final war to
exterminate the cockroaches.

166
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,517
He can't recover.

167
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,926
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:55,932
How was your
first day of school?

169
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,204
Didn't pee once
in the sandbox.

170
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,466
How was it with Cuddy?

171
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,701
What did you think
I was talking about?

172
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,799
Hmm.

173
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:08,006
You didn't use garlic. You
didn't use it last night either.

174
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,810
We always use garlic
on Chicken Florentine.

175
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,077
It tastes fine
this way.

176
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,880
You seem to be losing
your sense of smell.

177
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,649
I think you're losing
your sense of mind.

178
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,191
I can check right now
if you pull my finger.

179
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,850
No, it's the...

180
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,462
Are you inventing some
big medical mystery here?

181
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,967
Because if you're
imagining things again...

182
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,197
You weren't wearing shoes
last night either.

183
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:39,008
Yes, shoes, garlic,
I am vampire, Sookie.

184
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,916
I told you to get
that echo fixed.

185
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,686
My downstairs neighbor,
after you moved in,

186
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,785
started complaining about the
extra noise and the cooking smells.

187
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:57,954
What's his name?

188
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,021
I don't want you
making things worse.

189
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,191
He's on the condo board,

190
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,132
and I'm trying to get
the back garden renovated.

191
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:04,760
The white coats
taught me a whole bunch

192
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:07,499
of fun coping
and relating skills.

193
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:08,801
He's not only
a total jerk,

194
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:12,833
he's a decorated war hero
who lost an arm in Vietnam.

195
00:10:12,912 --> 00:10:15,745
I mean, there's no
winning with this guy.

196
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,784
Coping skill number one,
complete avoidance.

197
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:20,943
You happy?

198
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,488
Booty call? Give me 20
minutes to not shower.

199
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:26,747
Patient's having
a heart attack.

200
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:27,815
Mask and 15 liters.

201
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:29,053
Just thought
you'd like to know.

202
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:32,422
Streptokinase. Heparin.

203
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,337
Lassa fever.

204
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,440
You were mad that
I withheld it last time,

205
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,978
so I'm saying it
right up front.

206
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,379
He's already stabilized,
so 40ccs of ribavirin,

207
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,973
<i>and we're home
in time for Ellen.</i>

208
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,815
I checked. There's no
Lassa in Dibala's country.

209
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:56,479
Oh.
The rash is gone.

210
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,523
It rules out
your dioxin theory.

211
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,717
He's running
a slight fever,

212
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:02,056
which we can add to the
heart, plus the lung ulcers.

213
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,356
Ebola? Marburg?

214
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:04,896
Too long
an incubation period and...

215
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,192
Yes?

216
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,325
Don't people sometimes travel
to places that have, you know,

217
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:12,337
a fever that originated in
the Nigerian town of Lassa?

218
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,873
He's been to three other
countries in the last two years.

219
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,398
Here, Zimbabwe and Sharm el-Sheikh,
Egypt. No Lassa there either.

220
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:20,741
Oh. Again.

221
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,075
Trypanosomiasis?

222
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,345
No sleep disturbances, but
it fits best with his symptoms

223
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,545
and it's geographically
the most... What?

224
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,111
The Egypt visit was for
the African Union meeting,

225
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,215
where I'm guessing he was
"meeting" people from "Africa",

226
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,623
which includes Liberia,

227
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,423
which sent some members
of their foreign ministry

228
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,726
which has itself just been hit
by an outbreak of jock itch.

229
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,257
No, wait, not jock itch.
Lassa fever.

230
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,665
I'll start the ribavirin.

231
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,366
I did say it up front.

232
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,469
It's great to have the old
team back together again, huh?

233
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,451
Yesterday,
it's poisoning,

234
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:01,816
today, Lassa fever.

235
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,979
Maybe a specialist...

236
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,115
Joseph, leave him alone.

237
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,754
These people know
what they are doing.

238
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,289
Are you married, doctor?

239
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,457
No.

240
00:12:14,533 --> 00:12:15,864
You have a girlfriend?

241
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,559
Yes.

242
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:21,470
Judging by your
tentative answer

243
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,976
and the complicated
expression on her face,

244
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:28,343
I believe that is she
standing in the hallway.

245
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,312
I got a call from Douglas'
department at Princeton General.

246
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,584
They want me to
interview with them.

247
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:41,455
Which is weird because
when I called last week,

248
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:42,824
they said they had
nothing available,

249
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,557
so I never sent in
my resume.

250
00:12:45,631 --> 00:12:47,496
Douglas owes me a favor.

251
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,033
Most people
send chocolates.

252
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,729
And I'd stand outside your apartment
all night holding up a boom box

253
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,500
except you told me
you hate '80s music.

254
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:03,409
So about dinner,
I'm free tomorrow night.

255
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:31,337
I was wondering what that
noise was. It's the damn cane.

256
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,536
And I'm Greg.

257
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,341
And I can't sleep with you
banging around with that thing.

258
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,916
You're not actually saying
that I have too loud a cane?

259
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,545
Is that hard for you
to understand?

260
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,521
Well, only in the sense
that it has a rubber tip

261
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,023
on the end,
not a tap shoe.

262
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:48,616
Now you're
getting cute with me.

263
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:53,461
Okay, we started badly.
I apologize for the noise

264
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,557
and we will try to figure
out a way to be quieter.

265
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,194
And a thousand other things
I don't give a crap about.

266
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,831
Now you keep it down or
we're going to have trouble.

267
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,740
Wow.

268
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,179
You paged me?

269
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:19,520
This is Ama. She is from our
country, but she lives here now.

270
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:21,389
We'd like you
to use her blood.

271
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,688
For what?

272
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:27,061
She recovered from Lassa
fever two years ago.

273
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,929
Our Health Minister
has advised us

274
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:32,459
that plasma from one
who has the antibodies

275
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,597
is much more effective
than ribavirin.

276
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:37,233
This is
a signed consent form.

277
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,937
Will you take
her blood, please?

278
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,106
No.

279
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,212
I want to do this.

280
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,118
You understand that we
will be using your blood

281
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,088
to cure
President Dibala.

282
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:52,680
I know.

283
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,419
Are you from
the Sitibi people?

284
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,653
I am Sitibi.

285
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,956
Did they threaten you
in some way?

286
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,155
Your family members
back home?

287
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,393
Please let me
give the blood. Please.

288
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,967
Do it.

289
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,335
She's being coerced.

290
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,237
If she is,

291
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,299
I'd rather have a needle
prick on my conscience

292
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,937
than the death of
her family members.

293
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:43,537
Hey!
Don't let him in there!

294
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,446
That's enough,
we got him.

295
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:56,613
Hey.

296
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,014
You all right?

297
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,890
Who is that man?

298
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,196
He shot him?

299
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,328
No.

300
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,043
You need a lawyer.

301
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,876
You can get
a court-appointed.

302
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,108
I can help you.

303
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,242
I can't be helped.

304
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,654
You did a stupid,
terrible thing.

305
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,822
But given the circumstances
with your wife,

306
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,655
you could get
a reduced sentence.

307
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,487
She wasn't my wife.

308
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,962
Well, who was she?

309
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:46,698
They never
told us her name.

310
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:56,040
What his men made us do
to that woman,

311
00:16:57,716 --> 00:17:03,882
he is now going to do
to all the Sitibi.

312
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,250
You could have
gotten killed.

313
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,351
He wasn't
going to hurt me.

314
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,726
He fired a gun
in the hospital.

315
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:14,662
Come here.

316
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,364
Maybe next time, don't
yell out that warning.

317
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:30,938
The bloody eye was from an enlarged
lymph node blocking the retinal vein.

318
00:17:31,016 --> 00:17:32,415
We restored
circulation,

319
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,179
but it means we've got
to add lymph involvement

320
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,051
to the heart and lungs,
and rising fever.

321
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,316
I'm just going to
sit here quietly.

322
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,021
Why?

323
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,858
I feel like I've been inadvertently
undermining your authority.

324
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,297
So I'm just gonna observe.
I'm not gonna say a word.

325
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:52,795
The heart could point
to sarcoidosis.

326
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:04,206
I'm thinking the X-rays indicate
a lack of hilar adenopathy,

327
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,648
which rules it out.

328
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:09,153
Staph aureus?

329
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,147
No.

330
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:18,189
Because he smokes?

331
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,763
He's miming
a thermometer.

332
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,462
He says the fever's
not high enough.

333
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,530
So some other infection.

334
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,697
He's wrong.

335
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,264
The fever could be misleading
us into thinking infection.

336
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,571
Talk.

337
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,281
It could all fit
with lymphoma.

338
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:49,323
I need you to spread your
legs so I can do an "H".

339
00:18:49,394 --> 00:18:53,763
Can't be lymphoma.
LDH is normal.

340
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:54,958
He's got good
liver function,

341
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,160
it's masking
the elevated levels.

342
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,761
Biopsy the lymph node.
Check it out.

343
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,102
Makes sense.
Guess you don't need me.

344
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,771
Oh. By the way, you might
want to close the blinds.

345
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,340
It's really bright
in here.

346
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,719
It's just
a wild coincidence

347
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,456
that he thought
you were a rude jerk.

348
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:26,862
Come on, give me
the benefit of the doubt.

349
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:28,832
You said he's a jerk.
I barely talked.

350
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,266
You talked!

351
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:35,368
All I wanted was to
sip morning espresso

352
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,271
next to a peaceful,
burbling fountain.

353
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,106
You could be
sipping Courvoisier

354
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,272
next to a replica
of the Playboy grotto

355
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,178
if you tell him
what you got on him.

356
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,944
I don't have
anything on him.

357
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,212
I don't want
anything on him.

358
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,686
Closest he's been
to Vietnam,

359
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,952
ordering the Mee Krob
at that place on the corner.

360
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,424
Mee Krob is
from Thailand.

361
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:55,551
Exactly.

362
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:57,891
What did you do? Why do
you think he's faking?

363
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:59,157
I saw his mail.

364
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,289
You broke in?

365
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:05,496
No. He was holding it. Private
medical insurance, not from the VA.

366
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,738
Plus he's gotta
be early 50s.

367
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:11,037
He's too young to be a
vet. So, I looked further.

368
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,098
You did break in.

369
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,269
Online.

370
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,209
There's no reference to him
in any of the vet records.

371
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,646
Why would he fake
being a veteran?

372
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,980
Well, just look
how you're acting.

373
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,078
People have been tiptoeing
around this jerk for years.

374
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,783
Normally, we'd all tell the
amputee to go screw himself.

375
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,849
Victims get pity. Heroes get
adulation. It's way better.

376
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,986
Thank you for trying to
help me out with my neighbor.

377
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,325
Now forget
the Vietnam stuff.

378
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,489
I could prove this.

379
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,328
But you won't because
you'll be too busy

380
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,890
writing him
a letter of apology

381
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:40,302
and dropping it at his door,
without knocking at his door.

382
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,932
I didn't do anything.
That guy's a total ass.

383
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:46,239
Which is the point. It's easy
to be nice to people you like,

384
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:50,304
but being nice to people you
hate, that's a skill. Do it.

385
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,782
Thank you
for saving my life.

386
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,683
The man that
tried to kill you,

387
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,057
he said that you were
preparing a massacre.

388
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,234
The Sitibi are
my countrymen.

389
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:13,430
I am fighting
a guerrilla war.

390
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:15,996
In a way that's
being called genocide.

391
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:22,278
Twenty years ago, these same
Sitibi rebels took over the south.

392
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:24,781
They massacred
tens of thousands,

393
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,613
and they would
happily do it again.

394
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,620
I'm trying to impose order.

395
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,817
I'm trying to prevent
a genocide. Genocide.

396
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:42,022
My own son, my youngest,
he is a student here.

397
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,829
He hasn't
spoken to me in years

398
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:46,700
because of what he read
in your newspapers.

399
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,900
But what he read
is not true.

400
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,443
What about your
Youth Labor League?

401
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,176
There, I was at fault.

402
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:07,450
I hired men who, in their
zeal, stepped over the line,

403
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,523
and there were abuses.

404
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:15,462
But that will
not happen again.

405
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,542
Hello?

406
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:37,541
How's it going?

407
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,550
Normal-looking nucleus.

408
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,483
How's it going
with you?

409
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,611
It worried me
when you joked

410
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:44,086
about letting that man
shoot Dibala.

411
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,817
I wasn't joking.

412
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,792
You can't want
to kill anyone,

413
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,884
especially not
your own patient.

414
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,485
It's only natural
to feel...

415
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:53,155
No, it's completely
unnatural.

416
00:23:53,231 --> 00:23:54,823
Only psychopaths
can kill other people

417
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,458
without having some
sort of breakdown.

418
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:58,366
Not when it's justified.
Look at soldiers.

419
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,871
Even when
it's justified.

420
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,499
Am I trying to kill our
patient? Of course not.

421
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,202
But if he died, am I
supposed to just pretend

422
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:08,007
that wouldn't be good
for the world?

423
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,682
The cells are neatly
differentiated. This isn't lymphoma.

424
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,156
I thought I had detected the
sickly sweet smell of maple syrup

425
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,623
and socialized medicine.

426
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,785
It smells like victory.

427
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,300
That big flag in your place prompted
me to chat with your housekeeper.

428
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:33,098
Turns out you're a citizen
of the Great White North.

429
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:34,570
You broke into
my apartment?

430
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:37,972
Technically, no.
Well, technically, yeah,

431
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,567
but two steps,
hardly...

432
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,668
You're going to jail.

433
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:42,542
Speaking of, you know what can get you

434
00:24:42,614 --> 00:24:45,549
six months and
a $100,000 fine?

435
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:49,080
Falsely claiming that you
won a medal in Vietnam.

436
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,246
You think I'm faking?

437
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,985
Canada did not send troops to
fight in Vietnam, you idiot.

438
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,389
They sent troops to reinforce
the '73 Peace Accords,

439
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,628
which is where I tried
to free a 12-year-old boy

440
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,636
who stepped
on a land mine.

441
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,366
Thirty-six years later, every
second I feel pain in my hand

442
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,101
like I'm still grabbing
that boy's arm

443
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,735
even though
my arm isn't there.

444
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:15,678
So, no, I'm not faking.

445
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,408
Oh.

446
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,781
On a related note,
go Maple Leafs.

447
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:37,301
Did you get
the biopsy results?

448
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,495
Is it lymphoma?

449
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:39,661
No.

450
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,603
So we have to move on.

451
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,573
Infection,
perhaps autoimmune...

452
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:46,702
Did you get
the biopsy results?

453
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,678
Yes, I just told you.

454
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,374
Is it lymphoma?

455
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,450
Cameron and Chase?

456
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,352
They both really
like diagnostics,

457
00:25:58,423 --> 00:26:02,086
and I think they both really
like watching House torture me.

458
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,493
Anyway, thank you for
understanding about the job.

459
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,901
I had two really
crappy alternatives.

460
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,199
There was a third.

461
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:15,466
What's that?

462
00:26:16,174 --> 00:26:18,404
You could have
stepped aside.

463
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,976
We both would
have lost our jobs.

464
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,139
You could have asked Cameron
or Chase to take your place.

465
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,442
They wouldn't
have wanted to.

466
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,644
You just said they both
really like diagnostics.

467
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,419
You want to
go back in time?

468
00:26:30,488 --> 00:26:32,479
I want to
make this work.

469
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,585
I want to understand you. I mean,
you know how you made me feel.

470
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,490
If you could
do it again...

471
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:45,393
I made the right decision.

472
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:01,875
I need your confidential
medical opinion.

473
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,786
Is the President capable
of thinking clearly?

474
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,558
Obviously not right now.

475
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,721
Will he ever be?

476
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,963
I think...

477
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,728
Neurons don't grow back, and
he's already in his decline.

478
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,163
Anything he tells you, any command
he gives, how will you ever know

479
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,199
it's not just the delusions
of a sick, mad, dying, old man?

480
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,921
<i>He just started
spiking a fever.</i>

481
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,456
It's scleroderma.

482
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:48,889
You don't have some clever
way of telling me this time?

483
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:51,527
Patient's dying.
I'm done with clever.

484
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,470
Look at his skin. It's
tight for a 75-year-old.

485
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,736
Based on his admission
photo? Bit subjective.

486
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,333
Fever points
to infection.

487
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:01,902
And now he's got nodules on his
fingers. That's blastomycosis.

488
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,711
Nodules? You're calling
tight skin subjective?

489
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:06,808
I'm with Foreman.

490
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:08,546
We would have seen fungus
balls on the head CT.

491
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,053
Fungal lesions
can be missed.

492
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,179
We could
settle this with a test.

493
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,417
Anticentromere antibodies
would point to scleroderma.

494
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,722
Point to, not prove. And his fever's
too high. We have to treat him now.

495
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:20,231
If we treat wrong, we could
send this disease into overdrive.

496
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,788
You're with me on
the scleroderma?

497
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,766
I guess. I just don't care
enough about the patient

498
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,564
to waste my time trying to
convince anyone. We get it.

499
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,764
You don't like the guy, you
don't want to work on this case.

500
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,204
And yet
you're still here.

501
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,332
Why don't you
take a stand?

502
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,171
Either do something
about it or shut up.

503
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,643
Treat him for blasto
if you want.

504
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,745
I'll get Cuddy.
I can convince her to...

505
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,340
This isn't a democracy.

506
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,850
I don't care who you get.

507
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:43,615
At least for right now,
this is my department.

508
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:44,882
We're treating
him for blasto.

509
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:47,424
Start him
on amphotericin B.

510
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,636
Inject my IV
with an air bubble.

511
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:00,796
What are you doing?

512
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,362
I will have
another heart attack.

513
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,429
No one will know.

514
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:04,770
Let her go.

515
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:09,610
You tell my colonel I'm a sick,
dying old man who can't be trusted.

516
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:10,705
I didn't say...

517
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,647
You were trying to
put a gun in his hand

518
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:16,483
and point it at my head.
The gun is now in your hand.

519
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:19,990
That is a practical
difference, not a moral one.

520
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,856
If you want me dead,
then pull the trigger.

521
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:26,893
It is not so easy when
you have to do it yourself.

522
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,875
Allison.

523
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,323
I guess I didn't
want you dead.

524
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:04,399
If you touch
my wife again,

525
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,198
I'll kick your ass
out onto the street.

526
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:07,499
I don't care
who you are.

527
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:11,770
I did her a favor. I showed
her her true character.

528
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,242
She's a better person
than you are.

529
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:17,008
She is too weak to
act on her beliefs.

530
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:21,173
But that is not her fault.
Almost everyone is.

531
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:24,688
Even my own advisers,
my own colonel.

532
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:31,726
All they do is negotiate
and debate and sign treaties.

533
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,423
They are appeasers.

534
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:38,128
All the while, we are beset by
assassins and traitors, the scum...

535
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,693
Cockroaches?

536
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,574
What are you gonna
do about them?

537
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,633
What is an enemy to you?

538
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:51,711
Some younger physician
who covets your office?

539
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:57,278
In my world, there are dangers
and bloodshed and death,

540
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:02,486
and that makes you a man.
And men make choices.

541
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,190
And your choice is to send
bands of drunk, crazed children

542
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,028
to massacre
an entire people?

543
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,933
Don't ask me questions you
don't want to know the answer to.

544
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:16,167
I saved your life. I deserve to
know what you're planning to do.

545
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:19,699
Whatever it takes to
protect my country.

546
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,685
You broke
into his apartment?

547
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,486
I didn't break in.

548
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,823
I wish I believed you.

549
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,523
I can fix this.

550
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,189
I already did.

551
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,667
He was gonna
press charges,

552
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,364
but I promised him
you'd leave.

553
00:31:49,874 --> 00:31:51,933
You're kicking me out?

554
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,001
I'll explain it
to your psychiatrist,

555
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,775
but, yeah, you gotta
go somewhere else.

556
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,377
House, I know
when things go wrong,

557
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,648
usually you just double down
and get more involved.

558
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:08,055
But here,
you could go to jail.

559
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,822
And I truly believe

560
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,363
that you've changed enough to
know this is the right thing.

561
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:21,900
We need
a blood sample.

562
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:24,533
We gotta do the
anticentromere antibody test.

563
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,407
It'll show House is right.
It's scleroderma.

564
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,571
Why are you
doing this now?

565
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:32,643
Because I didn't
want to kill him.

566
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:35,880
And you're right.
I have to take a side.

567
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,689
So I'm gonna do what I
can to keep him alive.

568
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,192
I'll get you the blood.

569
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,457
Positive for
anticentromere antibodies.

570
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:48,999
We gotta get him
off the anti-fungals

571
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,500
and onto steroids
immediately.

572
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:51,899
I told you before.

573
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,495
This only points to
scleroderma. It doesn't prove it.

574
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:56,130
You're just gonna
ignore the test?

575
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:58,300
Blasto still fits best.

576
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,968
I know it's not conclusive,
but when you put it

577
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,068
with all
the other evidence...

578
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,511
I've made my decision.

579
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,554
Have you told Thirteen
you were wrong to fire her?

580
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,319
What does that have
to do with anything?

581
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,827
I've worked with you long
enough to know you're reasonable.

582
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:21,023
You can usually admit
when you're wrong.

583
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,158
But there's some
deep part of you

584
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,496
that when you find
you're wrong about

585
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,333
the most important
decisions you've made,

586
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:30,135
you get insecure
and you just retrench.

587
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,438
If you wanna mess up your
relationship that's your right,

588
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,138
but you mess this up,
our patient dies.

589
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,187
Switch him to steroids.

590
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:54,698
Hi, honey.

591
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,093
How was your day?

592
00:34:04,008 --> 00:34:05,270
Morning.

593
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,440
First of all, my bad.

594
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:14,548
I've gone through this whole thing
recently. I don't want to bore you.

595
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,453
Short version, I'm really
trying to do work on some stuff.

596
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,515
This is a definite setback.

597
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,321
Although, in fairness, you
really did make it tough.

598
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,328
Phantom pain in
your missing arm,

599
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,300
the five different kinds of
painkiller in your medicine cabinet,

600
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:40,310
that's what this magic box of
neurological trickery is for.

601
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:46,615
This'll be a lot easier if you do what
the crazy guy who tied you up says.

602
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:55,017
Put your hand in there.
Put your hand in there.

603
00:34:58,496 --> 00:34:59,827
Now look.

604
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,188
Mirror magic.

605
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,426
Your arm is back.

606
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,397
Now clench both your
fists at the same time.

607
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,998
Clench. Real hard.

608
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:18,981
If you believe in God,

609
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,479
pray that
this is gonna work.

610
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,546
You might also want to ask
him why he blew off your arm.

611
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:29,453
Ready?

612
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,462
Now let go.

613
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,741
Oh, my God.

614
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,278
You relaxed it.

615
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:53,784
For 36 years I've been in
pain, and it's finally gone.

616
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,948
Oh, my God.

617
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:04,827
Thank you.

618
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:08,697
O2 sat's down to 88.

619
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:12,258
Going through the main stem
bronchus into the right upper lobe.

620
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,928
Get them out of here!
No!

621
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,029
It's okay.

622
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,403
Bleeder.

623
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,873
Cauterizing.

624
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,834
Got it?
Yeah.

625
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,974
Get the paddles.

626
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,076
I'm going back in.

627
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,142
What is happening?

628
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:31,916
He's bleeding into his lungs. Charging.

629
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,786
Another bleeder.
I can get it.

630
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,224
Hold on.
There's a third.

631
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,193
God, there's a dozen.

632
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,496
Shock him.

633
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:43,727
Clear.

634
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,768
Charging. Clear.

635
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,084
You want to
curl up and cry,

636
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,491
the lounge chair's
a little more comfy.

637
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:46,359
I switched his meds.

638
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,156
I thought I was wrong, so I
took him off the antifungals,

639
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:52,566
put him on steroids
like you said.

640
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:54,935
You know what
that means.

641
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:59,272
I was too late or I was
right in the first place.

642
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,374
So, either you
killed him

643
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:08,247
by not having confidence
in your opinion

644
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,055
or you killed him by being
too attached to your opinion.

645
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,116
If you're anything like me,
and by the way, you are,

646
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,787
you need to know which.

647
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:21,457
He's under lock and key
in the morgue.

648
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,501
His government wants their
own doctors to do the autopsy.

649
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,401
They're taking his body
out tomorrow.

650
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,632
There's a reason
I hired you.

651
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,936
You used to know what
to do with a locked door.

652
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,685
I went down to the morgue
to rerun the antibodies test.

653
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,122
You ran it twice.

654
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,422
Turns out,
I couldn't get in.

655
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,620
They had
an armed guard.

656
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,288
But I saw this.

657
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,030
It's a sign-in sheet
from the morgue.

658
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:05,100
Your signature,
9:45 this morning.

659
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,201
That's right before
you guys ran the test.

660
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,071
What were you
doing there?

661
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,944
Follow-up on
a clinic case.

662
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,314
What case?

663
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,409
You think this is
really important?

664
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:16,919
One of the patients
in the morgue

665
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:19,888
was a 70-year-old woman
who had scleroderma.

666
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:24,491
You and Cameron, if you
took that woman's blood,

667
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:26,393
you could have
messed up the test results

668
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,695
so we treated Dibala
for the wrong disease.

669
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,460
Cameron had nothing
to do with it.

670
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,199
You son of a bitch!

671
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,764
He was going to
kill the Sitibi,

672
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:41,101
every last one of them.

673
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,339
I don't care what
he was gonna do.

674
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:46,577
He came to us and put
his life in our hands.

675
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,743
All the good we've done,

676
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:54,118
every life we've saved,
it would have meant nothing

677
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,991
if we just sent him off to kill
hundreds of thousands of people.

678
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,654
Look at the news.

679
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,059
The moderates
are taking over.

680
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,465
There's hope
for peace talks.

681
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,704
You tell the world
that I faked this test,

682
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,506
Dibala becomes a martyr.
The massacres begin.

683
00:40:13,878 --> 00:40:16,870
I cover this up,
I become your accomplice.

684
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,576
You think you can
guilt me into that?

685
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,583
If the cops are
going to come for me,

686
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,584
please warn me

687
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,263
so that I can
tell my wife first.

688
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,437
Chase,

689
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,007
you really think you can
kill another human being

690
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:50,672
without any consequences
to yourself?

691
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,381
No.

692
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,889
My neighbor called.

693
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,798
He sounded happy.

694
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,265
That's nice.

695
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,899
Even nicer, he's approving
the garden expansion.

696
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,335
Huh.

697
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:22,004
And even more nicer,

698
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:24,513
he's not going
to press charges,

699
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:26,277
even if you
don't move out.

700
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,619
What did you do to him?

701
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:31,819
I was nice.

702
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:37,183
You really want
to know?

703
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:43,466
I think I want to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

704
00:41:46,737 --> 00:41:49,205
<i>Alligators' main
prey is smaller animals</i>

705
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,969
<i>that they can kill and
eat with a single bite.</i>

706
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:53,573
Oh!

707
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,373
Oh!
