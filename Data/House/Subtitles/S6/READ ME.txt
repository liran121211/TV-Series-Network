Credit for the subs goes to aMvEL.
He ripped the subs from the Subpack and removed HI.


I fixed 3 lines errors. Xenzai[NEF] 


*******************************************************

To fix 3 lines is easy to do with Subtitle Workshop.(Freeware)
Google is your friend.... ;-)

Install the program > Start up the program.

File > Load Subtitle > find the subtitle you want to fix >
Tools > Information and errors > Information and errors > Fix errors > OK.
PS The fix can create other problem with the subtitle.
ALWAYS USE A COPY OF THE SUBTITLE YOU WANT TO FIX.
