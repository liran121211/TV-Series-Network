1
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,778
Hey.
Slow down, sister.

2
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,479
Actually,
I need to speed up.

3
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,748
Rachel woke up
early with a fever

4
00:02:02,822 --> 00:02:06,280
and she's been
terrorizing me all morning.

5
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:07,619
I'm already late.

6
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,992
Sorry, the stakeout went
longer than I thought.

7
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,256
Have you ever
been to a rave?

8
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,355
Goodbye.

9
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,797
You're already late,
and Rachel's sick.

10
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:17,701
Neither of which can be solved
by you leaving right this second.

11
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,364
The entire hospital's depending
on a proposal I have yet to finish

12
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,838
and need to
present at 8:30.

13
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,034
It's 7:30.

14
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,201
It's 7:37.

15
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:25,972
I'll have you on
the road in 10 minutes.

16
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:30,812
Come on, you don't wanna get into your
meeting all tight and stressed out, do you?

17
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,696
It's yours.

18
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,697
It's House.
Ignore it.

19
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,289
It says,
"Emergency page. "

20
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:49,733
I said ignore it.

21
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:50,996
Sweet.

22
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,306
I'm sorry, it's hard to pace yourself

23
00:03:03,383 --> 00:03:05,476
when you've been thinking
about it for 10 hours straight.

24
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,679
That's great,

25
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:11,190
now I'm late, stressed
out and frustrated.

26
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,423
So, if you give me
a minute, I can...

27
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,552
It'll wait.

28
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,699
You can do it.

29
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,499
Do what?

30
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,245
I thought you were
coming in at 7:30.

31
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,782
Rachel woke
up with a fever,

32
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:14,445
and then I just couldn't
get here any sooner.

33
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,112
There's a problem
in the pharmacy.

34
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,884
Hey, boss lady!

35
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,082
You don't answer
emergency pages anymore?

36
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,820
Tell them all I'll be
by as soon as I can.

37
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,261
And tell him I assumed it was
either about the wolf again

38
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:28,630
or the procedure I refused
to approve yesterday.

39
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,499
Turned out it wasn't
a resistant staph,

40
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,266
but I still say if it had been,
infecting him with malaria...

41
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,570
Seriously, House,
I don't have time for this.

42
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,611
You're lying. I have a
meeting in 20 minutes.

43
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,077
Not talking about
your meeting.

44
00:04:40,146 --> 00:04:41,340
I'm talking about
the phone call.

45
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,280
I didn't ask what you were
talking about because I don't care.

46
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,619
I was with your boytoy on
the stakeout last night.

47
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,456
You were with Lucas?

48
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,585
He needed someone who could diagnose a
soft tissue injury from across the street.

49
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,994
Apparently he doesn't
know any good doctors.

50
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:01,123
Or the ones he does know actually
have lives outside of work.

51
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,795
Things got a little slow,
so we made some wagers.

52
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,833
One being whether I could get
you to stop the miscegenation

53
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,509
with an emergency page.

54
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,772
What made
you think we'd...

55
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,507
He said you guys
do it every morning.

56
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,980
Everybody lies,
remember?

57
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,074
So you weren't actually...

58
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,311
Goodbye, House.

59
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:22,786
I'm gonna need a definitive answer
before any money changes hands.

60
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,449
Sorry to interrupt, but the
GRC called about the budgets,

61
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,961
the pharmacy is still waiting, and
your 8:30 just arrived on campus.

62
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,893
He should be here
in 10 minutes.

63
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,898
Figures this would be the
one day he comes early.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,467
Can you proofread
this for me?

65
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,900
When are you gonna
find your own assistant?

66
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,995
Not today. Thank you.
I'll be back in five.

67
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,869
Dr. Cuddy.

68
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,877
I know we're usually
fine with two CS reps,

69
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:48,378
but I want a few extra
hands today, just in case.

70
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,210
And have IT
recheck the network.

71
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:51,442
I don't want
to hear later that

72
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,645
the new lines can only dial
out or the computer crashed.

73
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,188
What's going on?
Hopefully, nothing.

74
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,418
Just make sure you're ready
if people start calling.

75
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,988
You wanted to see me?

76
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,222
Hey, Dr. Cuddy, yeah.

77
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,662
I wanted to let you know there's
a problem with one of the orders

78
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,166
that came in last night.

79
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,496
Which is?

80
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,727
They sent double the
amount of meds we ordered.

81
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:12,862
Did you call
and ask why?

82
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,338
Yeah. They insist
it's not a mistake.

83
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,772
So fax them
the original PO.

84
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:20,242
Yeah, that's what I was planning
on doing, but I can't find it.

85
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:22,211
Actually, I can't
find any of them.

86
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,375
Oscar, I don't have time to
straighten out your paperwork.

87
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,078
Where's Stan?
He doesn't get in till 9:00.

88
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,847
And it's actually
not my paperwork,

89
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,752
it's Gail's paperwork,
and she's out sick today.

90
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,519
So put it on her desk and let her
figure it out when she comes back.

91
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:34,992
All right, but it's not my problem if...

92
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,859
Oscar, not today,
okay?

93
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,262
Was it the whole shipment
or just one med?

94
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,529
It's just one.

95
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,592
Vicodin?

96
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,831
No, 25-milligram
ephedrine tablets.

97
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,641
What?
Call Gail.

98
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,736
Tell her I want to see
her in my office ASAP.

99
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:56,042
But she's sick.

100
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:58,140
This place is full of sick
people, just get her in here.

101
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,549
Dr. Cuddy, your 8:30 is
waiting in your office.

102
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,746
Now.

103
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,989
I gotta make
a quick trip upstairs.

104
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,219
Can you get the guy in my office a
cup of coffee? I'll be right back.

105
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,660
I've gotten you
coffee before.

106
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,759
What's wrong?

107
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,325
<i>It's freezing in here. I
can hardly feel my fingers.</i>

108
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,769
Please tell me you
didn't send a 911 page

109
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,466
<i>to tell me the
heater's broken.</i>

110
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,666
It's not broken.

111
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:26,836
House bribed the physical plant
to turn on the AC so I'd hurry up.

112
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:27,935
<i>So hurry up.</i>

113
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,914
This man's abdomen
is wide open.

114
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,745
<i>His core temp
is down to 95!</i>

115
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,615
Fine,
I will deal with it.

116
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,677
You better,
or I'm gonna file...

117
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:39,524
I don't care what he told
you. Turn it back up, now.

118
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:43,161
Thought you had
an important meeting.

119
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,526
You're an idiot.

120
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,827
What are you gonna do the next time one
of your patients needs a liver transplant?

121
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,927
Go talk to Wilson about something
completely unrelated and see what happens.

122
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:54,268
Mystery infection guy
is now covered in boils

123
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,036
and has an abscess big
enough to put your fist in.

124
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,509
<i>He needs to get into
an OR tout de suite.</i>

125
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,409
Hourani will
be done soon.

126
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,641
Good.

127
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,706
I'll have some hot
chocolate waiting.

128
00:08:06,452 --> 00:08:09,148
Marina. Hey,
how is she doing?

129
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,120
She vomited?

130
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:15,490
Give her some more ibuprofen and
put her in the bath for a bit.

131
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,452
And call me in a half
hour if it doesn't go down.

132
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:19,224
Sorry, Marina,
I have another call.

133
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,994
Just call me in
a half hour either way.

134
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:23,963
Hey, what's up?

135
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,466
Tell him
I'm halfway there.

136
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,074
He's the one who insisted
on the early meeting.

137
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,535
All right,
I'm coming.

138
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,051
Morning, Eli.
Sorry about the wait.

139
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,385
That's all right.

140
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,756
I hear you've
got a sick kid.

141
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,986
Yeah, I know
what that's like.

142
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,655
Or, I should say,
my wife does.

143
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:55,866
So, you guys ready to give some
ground so we can make this deal?

144
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:57,399
Why would we do that?

145
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,165
We've been going at
this for eight months.

146
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,865
As soon as you decide to get reasonable.

147
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,067
I'm the one
that's unreasonable?

148
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,609
You've taken weeks to respond
to every proposal I've presented.

149
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,010
AtlanticNet Insurance is the largest
healthcare provider in New Jersey,

150
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,572
and you're not the only
hospital whose contracts are up.

151
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,276
So is your team ready to
come back to the table?

152
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,684
Yeah.
We're not going to.

153
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,179
This is our final offer.

154
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,849
We're willing to go with
a capitated structure,

155
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,826
but we need at
least a 12% increase

156
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,590
in reimbursements
across the board.

157
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,098
Well, good news is I can
give you a quick response.

158
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,259
Not a chance.

159
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:33,065
But as always,
nice talking to you.

160
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,731
Say hi to your
sister for me.

161
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:43,172
If you don't accept the offer,
we're gonna terminate the contract.

162
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:46,713
Gonna be hard
to keep this place open

163
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,755
if all your patients
have to pay cash.

164
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:52,814
Princeton-Plainsboro is the smallest
hospital in our entire network.

165
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,722
We're also the best.
It doesn't matter.

166
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,921
We are responsible for
covering 13 million people.

167
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,896
We don't have enough cash
to buy them all Maseratis.

168
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:02,731
I know what you pay Bergen, Newark
Beth Israel, Robert Wood Johnson...

169
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,429
It's because
they have leverage.

170
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,495
You can be expensive or small,
but you can't be both.

171
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,973
I've engaged JoneslCurtin
to handle the PR

172
00:10:10,076 --> 00:10:13,807
and I'm prepared to make the
announcement at 3:00 p. m. Today.

173
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,649
First lesson every good poker
player learns is don't get emotional.

174
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,412
You don't have the cards.

175
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,510
And the sooner
you realize that,

176
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,647
the sooner a reasonable
contract will get signed.

177
00:10:26,192 --> 00:10:29,355
You have until 3:00 p. m.
To change your mind.

178
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:34,532
I always did like your style.
Gonna be sad to see you go.

179
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,518
They're waiting for you
in the conference room.

180
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,920
Thanks.

181
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,256
Take this up
to the call center

182
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,320
and tell Claudia to
give one to each CS rep

183
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:07,559
and to start going over the
answers to each question.

184
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,725
Okay.

185
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,860
And under no circumstances is any
of this info to go outside that room.

186
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,770
The scripts are numbered, and I want a
list of every person she gives one to.

187
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:17,138
Got it.
Anything else?

188
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:18,335
No.

189
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,804
If you really wanted
to make a deal,

190
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,110
you should've
ditched the push-up

191
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:25,877
and gone
with the demi.

192
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:28,078
Nothing makes a guy wanna
close like highbeams.

193
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,245
What have you heard?

194
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,846
Your meeting with the weasel
lasted less than five minutes,

195
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:35,883
which means you either agreed to a
completely sensible 30-day extension

196
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:40,455
or one of you issued a
completely ridiculous ultimatum.

197
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,227
Oh, goody,
you or him?

198
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:46,362
Me.

199
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,532
Way to go, boss.
You said it was ridiculous.

200
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,973
Ridiculous to make,
fun to watch.

201
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,034
As long as it's
not just a bluff.

202
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,272
Please tell me
it's not a bluff.

203
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:57,315
It's not a bluff,
and it's not ridiculous.

204
00:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,044
Just because
we're not some huge...

205
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,118
Mr. Pluta started hallucinating
before we could put him under.

206
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,213
His BP's plummeting, he
has an elevated heart rate.

207
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,054
Looks like
congestive heart failure.

208
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:08,286
Interesting.

209
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:09,889
I don't care
how interesting it is,

210
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:12,760
you are not infecting him with malaria.

211
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,062
Since when is malaria
a cure for heart failure?

212
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:19,935
It's not. It's not congestive heart
failure, it's gotta be one of the...

213
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,077
I just got off
the phone with Hourani.

214
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,077
I'm sorry, Dave,
I don't really have time...

215
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,343
You think I had time to
listen to him go for 20 minutes

216
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,884
about the damn
temperature in the OR?

217
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,078
I took care of it.

218
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,781
It's not an "it," it's a "him"
you need to take care of.

219
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,290
You've got the entire staff
catering to House's every whim,

220
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,156
and I can't get approval to hire
a replacement for the surgeon

221
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,956
he stole from
my department.

222
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:46,657
A doctor I only took on in the first
place because of pressure from you.

223
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,862
So you didn't want Chase, but now
you're pissed you can't have him?

224
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,130
You want to convene
a search committee

225
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:53,865
and start looking for
a new chief of surgery?

226
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,099
No, Dave.

227
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,641
Then you better stop
spending all your time

228
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,304
putting out his fires
and start doing your damn job.

229
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,784
There a problem
with Dr. Thomas?

230
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,347
No, just refereeing
a dispute about the OR.

231
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:19,130
So, we don't yet have a
contract with AtlanticNet.

232
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,999
We gave you an extra week. And you
assured us you'd have a deal by today.

233
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:27,004
We could have a deal, just
not the deal we deserve.

234
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,370
So, what do you want,
approval for an extension?

235
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,999
We've been at this
for eight months,

236
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,374
an extension isn't
going to change anything.

237
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,537
So what's your plan?

238
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,875
I presented
a final offer.

239
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,779
I told them that we would
agree to a capitated structure

240
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,014
if they increase
reimbursements by 12%.

241
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,386
A final offer.
What does that mean?

242
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,119
If they don't accept it by
3:00, we're gonna terminate.

243
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,955
Are you out
of your mind?

244
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,055
If we don't accept
AtlanticNet Insurance

245
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,191
we'll lose 80%
of our patients.

246
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,529
We'd be lucky
to last three months.

247
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:59,729
We're not asking for
anything they can't afford.

248
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,637
Their last offer
was a 4% increase,

249
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,005
and you're demanding 12?

250
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,476
They're paying even
more at some places.

251
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,206
Units that have lower ratings than ours.

252
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,145
In a perfect world that
would definitely matter.

253
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:12,047
Sanford, they're all about growth,

254
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:15,848
and they know they don't get new customers
by marketing themselves as the biggest.

255
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,684
They do it by claiming
they're the best,

256
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,987
and they can't do that if
their patients can't come to us.

257
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,195
What was Morgan's reaction
when you told him?

258
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:29,200
He didn't give in.
But he will.

259
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,603
I told him I'd make the
announcement at 3:00.

260
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,935
He'll call back
before then.

261
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,067
They need us.

262
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,804
No, we need them.

263
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,676
We need each other.

264
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,583
The negotiation is
your responsibility,

265
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,586
so we can't stop you if
this is what you want to do.

266
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,954
But just so we're clear, if we don't
have a contract with AtlanticNet,

267
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,653
you're not gonna
have a contract with us.

268
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,601
Guess who didn't show
up for clinic duty.

269
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,468
Don't tell me,

270
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,473
the guy with all the boils
needs a liver transplant.

271
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:44,166
No, his doctor
needs a nap.

272
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,505
You want me to try
to find him?

273
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,045
You really need him?
I need someone.

274
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,640
I have cancer.

275
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,116
Why do you think
you have cancer?

276
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:56,518
I don't think I have cancer,
I know I have cancer.

277
00:15:56,855 --> 00:16:00,951
I had surgery to remove a malignant
polyp in my colon six months ago,

278
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:03,119
and now it's spread to
my liver and lymph nodes.

279
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,595
So you're under
the care of an oncologist?

280
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,689
Yeah, but he won't give me
the prescription I need.

281
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,427
You need more
pain killers?

282
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,662
No, I need breast milk.

283
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,566
Human breast milk?

284
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,973
Yes, it has cancer-fighting qualities.

285
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,342
Well, in newborns it's been
shown to reduce future risk...

286
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,383
No. In adults with cancer,
too. I've read studies.

287
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,118
Look, I even know a
place where I can buy it.

288
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:36,685
I just need a prescription so I can
get reimbursed by my insurance company.

289
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:40,993
They said they'd reimburse the cost
of breast milk as a cancer treatment?

290
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,931
They reimburse
prescriptions.

291
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,128
So, if you write
me a prescription,

292
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:45,534
then they have
no choice but to pay.

293
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:48,538
Well, actually,
they have a choice.

294
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,370
What are you, some type of
shill for the insurance company?

295
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,173
No. I've been paying
premiums for 30 years

296
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,715
and I've never been sick a day
in my life till this happened.

297
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,274
Now I can't work.
I got no money,

298
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,152
and you want to help
them screw me over.

299
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,280
I'm not screwing
you over.

300
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,948
Well, then give me the
script. It won't help you.

301
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,356
Will it hurt me?
No, but...

302
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,020
Okay, so it won't harm me
and it won't harm you,

303
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,223
but it's this insurance company...
This is not about insurance.

304
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,630
Then give me
the damn script!

305
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,398
I'm sick.

306
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,204
I need help.

307
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,308
I need something.

308
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:32,315
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:38,918
Bitch.

310
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,095
Anyone call?

311
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,294
Yeah.

312
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,067
The ER. They said the vascular who's
on call doesn't have privileges.

313
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:56,766
Then why is he on call?

314
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,502
Dowd's at a conference
and got him to fill in.

315
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:02,274
Be nice if he got somebody who could
actually work here. Call Ereshefsky.

316
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,281
Ereshefsky?
She's not gonna do it.

317
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:05,407
She owes me a favor.

318
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,781
She's still not
gonna do it.

319
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:09,512
All right.

320
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,085
Oh, and there's a guy in your
office. I think he's a lawyer.

321
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,283
Why is he
in my office?

322
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,019
Said he didn't want to sit
around a bunch of sick people.

323
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,221
I tried to stop him.

324
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,732
Hi. I'm Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

325
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:24,962
Ronald Westbrook.

326
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,935
I appreciate your taking
the time to meet with me.

327
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,098
Hard to avoid, since
you're already in my office.

328
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,642
Sorry about that, I just
got over a wicked cold.

329
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,210
I didn't want to...
How can I help you?

330
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,473
I represent
Martin Acevedo.

331
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,607
He's filed a suit against
PPH and Dr. Robert Chase

332
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,981
for performing surgery
without consent.

333
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:44,647
Yes, I saw that. I also
saw the consent forms.

334
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:45,814
They were all signed.

335
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,290
Yes, but my client
was assured

336
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,054
that the procedure would
just be a few minor sutures.

337
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,893
Wait, your client
accidentally cut his thumb off

338
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,432
with a table saw, right?
Yes.

339
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,195
And Dr. Chase
reattached it?

340
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:57,462
Yes.

341
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,703
You're saying he didn't
want it reattached?

342
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:02,638
No, he most
certainly did not.

343
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:06,509
His insurance only covered
60% of inpatient expenses,

344
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,512
so he would only agree
to the cheapest option.

345
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:09,638
So what did you tell him?

346
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:12,740
I said I'd sew up the
skin over the exposed bone.

347
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,012
Then I put him under,

348
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:17,249
got his thumb from the
paramedics and reattached it.

349
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,847
What's he gonna do?

350
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:21,415
Tell a judge that I harmed him
by reattaching a vital digit?

351
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,486
Both he and the insurance company are
suing to get out of paying the bill.

352
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,087
It's over $80,000.

353
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,565
It was his thumb.

354
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:32,668
I couldn't just let him toss it
in the trash to save a few bucks.

355
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,237
The pharm tech who called in sick is
here. She's waiting in your office.

356
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,678
He barely even
looks at me anymore.

357
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,479
We haven't had
sex in months.

358
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:49,513
You don't need
pills to lose weight.

359
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,352
There are healthier ways,
legal ways.

360
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,325
You don't understand
how hard it is.

361
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:59,495
Ever since our second child,
no matter what I do...

362
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,762
I just wanted to lose 10 more
pounds, and then I was gonna stop.

363
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,596
I'm sorry.

364
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,762
Forging pharmaceutical
orders, stealing...

365
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,137
Don't fire me, Dr. Cuddy.

366
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,871
Please, I'm begging you.

367
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:17,312
If Sam finds out, he'll divorce
me for sure. And my kids...

368
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:22,481
I will never do it again, I swear.
Just give me a second chance.

369
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,517
I won't report
the theft to the DEA.

370
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,183
But I have to fire you.

371
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:38,466
Just take a few minutes
to compose yourself,

372
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,802
then go down to HR, and they'll
give you your last check.

373
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,501
I've been a perfect
employee for seven years.

374
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:47,238
I know, but this
is too big.

375
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,545
I'm sorry.

376
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:14,770
How's it going?

377
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,535
I've got three hours to save
this place from bankruptcy,

378
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,304
I just fired one of
my best employees,

379
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:22,869
and the woman taking care of my
sick child isn't returning my calls.

380
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,974
Rachel's gonna be fine, I'm sure
whoever he or she is deserved it,

381
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:29,110
and we're not going
bankrupt. Are we?

382
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,283
Don't worry. The board will fire
me before they allow that to happen.

383
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,291
They'd never fire you.

384
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,624
I just told AtlanticNet Insurance I'd
terminate unless they give us a 12% bump.

385
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,665
They might fire you.

386
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,163
Marina, hey, it's me.

387
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,499
I haven't heard back from you.
Can you call me as soon as you can?

388
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:47,970
Thank you.

389
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:50,173
You try Lucas?

390
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:52,608
He's either sleeping
or avoiding me.

391
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:53,804
You in a fight?

392
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,244
Not yet, but
we're gonna be.

393
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:06,820
What do you think I should
do about AtlanticNet?

394
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:10,622
You're asking a guy who paid full
sticker price for his last car.

395
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,357
You ask House?

396
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,960
He is a master manipulator
who always gets what he wants.

397
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:18,127
This situation is out of
control enough already.

398
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,468
House is the last person
I want to get involved.

399
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:32,876
Get out of my chair,
and the answer's no.

400
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:36,715
Have you noticed how many porn
sites have "mom" in the domain name?

401
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,950
Hot moms, hungry moms, mature moms.

402
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,556
That ought to make you feel pretty good.

403
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:47,893
What do you want?

404
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,059
Looks like boils, altered
mental status and heart failure

405
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,796
was caused by renal
cell carcinoma.

406
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,999
I need your signature to
start treating it with malaria.

407
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,371
Don't worry. I'm giving him chemo, too.

408
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,307
What is your sudden
obsession with malaria?

409
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,040
Just trying to play
my part, cutting costs.

410
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:05,241
Malaria is the simplest, cheapest
method of delivering hyperthermia.

411
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,183
Right, the only money
you care about...

412
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:12,214
You bet someone you could use
malaria as a diagnostic tool?

413
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,753
That doesn't
sound like me.

414
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,349
Forget it.

415
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,860
Okay, let me see if
I've got this straight,

416
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,897
a bet that puts one patient
at minor risk is juvenile...

417
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,556
And irresponsible
and dangerous.

418
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,727
But going all-in
against AtlanticNet...

419
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:26,594
Is not a bet.

420
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,504
That is a carefully considered
negotiating position.

421
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,434
I'm gonna put
this in your in-box.

422
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:34,843
I just hope
it doesn't get lost

423
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:39,009
underneath all the other stuff
you're carefully considering.

424
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,414
Can you take a look
at these per diem schedules,

425
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:48,390
let me know if you see
any conflicts? Got it.

426
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:51,190
Oh, and Ereshefsky
actually did come in.

427
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,231
You catch her leaving a
sponge in a guy or something?

428
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,198
Wasn't a medical mistake.
What was it?

429
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,894
Can't tell you now.
She came in.

430
00:23:56,968 --> 00:24:00,734
Hey, Stan, have you audited
the ephedrine orders, yet?

431
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:02,637
Why? You told me she confessed. Stan!

432
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:03,799
All right, yeah,
I'll take care of it.

433
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,900
Today.

434
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,506
You know he's
cussing you out now.

435
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:08,876
I don't care, as long as he does it.

436
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,107
What a bitch.

437
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,308
What are you
doing here?

438
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,281
Sounded like you were gonna
be too busy for lunch, so...

439
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,750
My specialty.
Spinach lasagna.

440
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,310
Sure you didn't come
looking for more people

441
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,754
you could brag about
our sex life to?

442
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,121
Okay, sorry.

443
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,559
From now on I've got nothing but
bad things to say about our sex life.

444
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,425
Or nothing to say.

445
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,988
And what's going on with Marina?
She hasn't called me back.

446
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:31,296
She was gonna call, I told her I'd
let you know everything was okay.

447
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,836
So her fever broke?

448
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,498
What exactly does that
mean, when a fever breaks?

449
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,269
Lucas, I'm very busy, does
she have a fever or not?

450
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,310
That was gonna
be your lunch?

451
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,573
And you didn't have
breakfast either.

452
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,239
No, she doesn't
have a fever,

453
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,784
and the rash was just
like a little diaper rash.

454
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:47,943
What rash?
She has a rash?

455
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:49,782
A little one.

456
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:53,149
Lisa, don't worry,
I'm telling you.

457
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,259
Come on.

458
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:01,321
Oh, God. I must have grabbed
Marina's cell by mistake.

459
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:09,637
And I turned the ringer off on
the home phone so I could sleep.

460
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,069
What are you
doing to me?

461
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,337
I take it your
deal's not done.

462
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:14,935
Not yet.

463
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,312
How about I take a quick look into the
guy who's in charge of the negotiations,

464
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,407
or better yet, the CEO.

465
00:25:20,485 --> 00:25:23,045
If I get some dirt, you
can use it as leverage.

466
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,021
There's no time.

467
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,691
How do you even
find these guys?

468
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:35,932
You should've
seen the guy's face.

469
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:39,129
I thought he was gonna have a damn
coronary right there in the tee box.

470
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,672
Excuse me,
you're Keith Tannenbaum,

471
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,833
CEO of AtlanticNet
Insurance, right?

472
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:45,500
That's me.
How can I help you?

473
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,305
Well, actually, I think
we can help each other.

474
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:51,338
I am Dr. Lisa Cuddy, Dean of
Medicine at Princeton-Plainsboro.

475
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,848
Oh, yeah.
Well, how are you?

476
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,352
Well, I'm a
little unhappy.

477
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:58,013
You're aware that our contract
with your company is up this week.

478
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,387
Yes, and we have a negotiating
team that's working all that out.

479
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:03,518
Princeton-Plainsboro has the
highest rated ER in the state,

480
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:05,289
the most advanced ICU,

481
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:09,356
and the most innovative diagnostic
medicine department in the entire country.

482
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,458
Good to know. Now if you
don't mind, I'd like to...

483
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:14,061
While AtlanticNet Insurance
has a marketing budget

484
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:17,664
that is more than our pediatric
ICU's and transplant unit's combined.

485
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:20,142
Your PGA sponsorship could
pay for our walk-in clinic,

486
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:22,236
and the money you spend to
fuel your two private jets

487
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,874
could fund our air ambulance
service for the next three years.

488
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:27,008
Your point being?

489
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,677
Your growth may be good
for your bottom line,

490
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,744
but ours allows us
to save lives.

491
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:34,052
And I would rather not have
to announce to the press

492
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,391
how selective your company appears
to be when it comes to cutting costs.

493
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,336
Morgan was right.
You are one tough gal.

494
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,007
You can portray me as a rich
bastard in the press all you want,

495
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,046
just as long
as I stay rich.

496
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,717
Stan is looking for you.
I'm busy.

497
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,694
He said it's urgent.

498
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,895
I don't understand how it's even
possible. I've checked it twice.

499
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,028
How much?

500
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,197
Ten cases.

501
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,099
Ten cases?

502
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,698
Going back three years.

503
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,405
What the hell have
you been doing, Stan?

504
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,309
You're supposed to be
managing this place.

505
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,812
All the paperwork
I signed was correct.

506
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,042
She must have altered
the orders afterwards.

507
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:35,109
Didn't you ever cross check
it with the bills that came in?

508
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,448
I delegated it.

509
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,320
To whom?

510
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:40,853
To Gail.

511
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:43,223
Well, she seemed perfectly
trustworthy, how was I supposed to know?

512
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,091
By doing your job!
Sorry.

513
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,154
Have you notified the DEA?
The DEA?

514
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:48,960
Jeez, Stan, hello!

515
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,230
You don't steal $50,000 worth of
pills because you want to lose weight.

516
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:55,761
She's supplying a meth lab.
Just get her back in here.

517
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,603
All right.
Now.

518
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,478
Well, you ever
want a job, trust me.

519
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,347
He'll double whatever
you're making here.

520
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,942
I take it he liked
my proposal.

521
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,478
Enough to tell me to get
my ass back over here today.

522
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,753
Here. He's willing
to go to 8%.

523
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,587
Eight?
We were at four.

524
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,658
Your board's gonna think
you walk on water.

525
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,866
I want 12.

526
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:29,502
You're not gonna get 12.
There's just no way.

527
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,871
8% barely covers
our cost inflation.

528
00:28:31,976 --> 00:28:34,968
The capitated structure should
allow you to hold down inflation.

529
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,809
And shifts all
your risk onto us,

530
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,280
which is why
we deserve 12.

531
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:39,373
Lisa, come on.

532
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,976
The guy who mows my lawn makes
more than my kid's teacher.

533
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:44,317
Hell, the two guys whose lunch
you interrupted could get fired,

534
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,291
their severance would be more than most
of their employees make in a lifetime.

535
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,624
It doesn't have anything
to do with what you deserve.

536
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,388
This is it.

537
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,499
Take it or leave it.

538
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,465
What are you doing?
Hey.

539
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,399
Know any good
transplant surgeons?

540
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:34,165
Turns out his kidneys aren't
the only thing failing.

541
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,433
And I know what
you're thinking,

542
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,338
but malaria wouldn't
destroy his liver that fast,

543
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:40,843
especially since
we never infected him.

544
00:29:40,912 --> 00:29:42,504
I thought you said...
Apparently Foreman now thinks

545
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,445
that he has the authority
to overrule my orders

546
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,744
just because
the FDA wouldn't approve.

547
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:48,216
Don't worry,
I'll deal with him.

548
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,720
If you could just
talk to Hourani...

549
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:55,222
What would you do?

550
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,053
If you paged me
during sex?

551
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,791
About the contract
with AtlanticNet?

552
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:05,464
I got them to come up to 8%,
but we should get at least 12.

553
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,133
It's all numbers, do the
math, and nothing else.

554
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,309
It's not about my pride,
it's about the principle.

555
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:15,072
They're trying to screw us
over because we're small.

556
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,204
That's what they're
supposed to do.

557
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,078
They should be pressuring
other hospitals

558
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,643
to be more like us, not trying to
make us more like them. It's stupid.

559
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,216
And putting your
job on the line

560
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,190
in an effort to stamp
out stupidity isn't?

561
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:29,756
You would.

562
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,824
Probably.

563
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:35,161
But then I also wanted to try to cure
cancer by infecting a guy with malaria

564
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,633
to win a $50 bet. You
really want to be like me?

565
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,788
As you know,
for the past eight months,

566
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:11,391
we've been trying to renegotiate our
contract with AtlanticNet Insurance.

567
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:14,734
It's been a difficult process,
but I wanted to let you all know

568
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:18,333
before we made the formal announcement,
that, as of 5:00 p. m. Today,

569
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,310
our contract with AtlanticNet
will be terminated.

570
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:22,939
We've doubled the number

571
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:25,983
of customer service
representatives in our call center,

572
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:29,986
current patients will still be allowed
to remain in our care for 30 days,

573
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,580
but starting tomorrow we will
no longer be accepting patients

574
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,183
with AtlanticNet
health insurance.

575
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,019
Dr. Cuddy!

576
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,431
Why weren't we told about this sooner?

577
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,808
Come on, Marina,
pick up the phone.

578
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:54,943
I'm busy.

579
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,742
We found a liver match.

580
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,011
All right.

581
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,178
Get him prepped. I'll straighten
things out with Hourani.

582
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,688
Hourani's not the problem. House is.

583
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,554
Now he wants Chase
to do the surgery.

584
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,388
To prove to Hourani
he doesn't need him?

585
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:12,520
To prove to Thomas that Chase
was his department's best surgeon.

586
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,655
And what does Chase want to do?
Chase wants to do the surgery.

587
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:15,824
And you don't want
him to do it because?

588
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,992
I don't care
who does it.

589
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,092
So what's the problem?

590
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:19,295
In order to get our
patient into the OR,

591
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,803
we have to get him
on the surgery schedule.

592
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,840
In order to do that we need
someone to put him there

593
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,137
who neither House
nor Thomas can overrule.

594
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,553
What?

595
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,322
Would you rather
I go back on Vicodin?

596
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:45,760
She's not massaging
your leg.

597
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,321
She will eventually.

598
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,363
Why am I the only person here who
cares what happens to this hospital?

599
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:55,429
Get off your ass and get
your department under control,

600
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,508
at least for the
next few days.

601
00:32:57,575 --> 00:32:59,236
It's gonna take longer
than a few days

602
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:01,540
for a company
the size of AtlanticNet

603
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:04,775
to start feeling the squeeze
of your PR campaign.

604
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:05,906
If they ever do.

605
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,144
And you know this how?

606
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:10,187
From all the time you spent researching
them and their other contracts,

607
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,687
the way they handle
their press relations?

608
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:13,747
I know they have
a NASCAR team.

609
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,385
Despite what you may have learned
at Hebrew school or from Jimmy Cliff,

610
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:21,592
sometimes the bigger they are,
the harder they kick your ass.

611
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,101
I'm not trying
to be greedy.

612
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:35,407
But he's also not interested in being
forced into a medical bankruptcy.

613
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,779
Mr. Acevedo, I'm sorry you're
having financial difficulties,

614
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,317
but because of us
you still have a thumb.

615
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,751
I assume that's something
a carpenter might need.

616
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:48,622
And I assume you didn't ask for this
meeting so you could lecture my client.

617
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,250
You have insurance,

618
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:54,594
but by filing the suit you've caused
us to get paid nothing by them either.

619
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:55,723
That's not our problem.

620
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,427
Actually, it is,
since he's responsible

621
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:59,629
for any expense
we're not reimbursed.

622
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,831
But if you drop this suit
and make it clear

623
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,998
that Dr. Chase was acting
in your best interest

624
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:07,009
when he reattached your thumb, then
we'll be able to resubmit the claim.

625
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,602
And you'll cover his
deductible, attorney's fees,

626
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,409
and 50 grand for
pain and suffering.

627
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,815
Actually I was thinking more like
we'd cover half his deductible,

628
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:17,945
which means you'd
only owe $16,000.

629
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,180
You want him to pay you?
Yes!

630
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,191
Do you have any idea
how much it costs,

631
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:26,093
how many years it takes to
train someone in microsurgery?

632
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:28,325
We gave you back your life.

633
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,864
You can still work, you can button
your own shirt, hold a fork...

634
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,766
Martin, let's go.

635
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,633
I'm sorry, I know I should
pay, but I just can't.

636
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,041
I still cannot work, I'm
already under water on my house,

637
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,548
and I have two kids
with braces.

638
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:49,378
You think you'd be in
better shape without a thumb?

639
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:54,686
Right now, financially?
Yeah, I would be.

640
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,893
Well, so would we,
but when you came in,

641
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,829
we didn't think about that,
we just took care of you.

642
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,367
Made sure we did whatever
you needed to get well.

643
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,527
Yeah, right.

644
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,833
All you doctors care
about is healing.

645
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,339
That's why there are all those BMWs
and Porsches in the parking lot.

646
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:11,466
Damn it.

647
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,907
Come on,
we're out of here.

648
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,238
We'll see you in court.

649
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:16,143
You're right,
you will.

650
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,242
You still have
a thumb because of us,

651
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,250
and like everyone else in this
world, we don't work for free.

652
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,686
We earn this money, and if we have
to take your house to get it, we will.

653
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,721
What's going on?

654
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,890
I think
they're fighting.

655
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,257
Out of my way.
Now! Out of the way!

656
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:42,737
What the hell
is going on?

657
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,605
I told them to use
their words, but...

658
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,855
That pharm tech is back.
She's in your office.

659
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,186
You, there.
You, over there.

660
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:04,024
I don't want to hear a word out of
either one of you until I get back.

661
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,092
You lied.

662
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,760
So? What are you
gonna do about it?

663
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:15,300
Well, for one,
notify the DEA.

664
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,533
Good, I'm sure they'll
be very interested to hear

665
00:36:17,608 --> 00:36:20,406
how Dr. House forced me
to help him steal the meds

666
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:24,539
and the administrator who he's having
sex with has been helping him cover it up.

667
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:27,474
You really think you can
lie your way out of this?

668
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,485
Yeah, I do.

669
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:32,249
Anything else you
want to know, bitch?

670
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,622
The hospital board's chairman
wants to speak to you.

671
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,257
Tell him I'm busy.
I did, but he...

672
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,269
Then tell him I quit.

673
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,875
You owe Lucas the money.

674
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,477
We were having sex
when you called.

675
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:41,214
The breast milk guy finally found a
doctor who'd give him what he wanted.

676
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:44,385
If it works, that's way
better than malaria.

677
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,995
It's worth a shot.

678
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,161
Great.

679
00:37:54,672 --> 00:37:56,731
I thought they
were the ones bluffing.

680
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,242
No way they'd
let us terminate.

681
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:08,344
They're not gonna fire you,
and you're not gonna quit.

682
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,088
Why not?

683
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,017
Because you're an idiot.

684
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:20,527
This place needs you,
and that matters to you.

685
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:30,730
What do you think
of that pharm tech, Gail?

686
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,105
She's a sociopath.

687
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,438
You knew she was
stealing meds?

688
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:37,537
No. But have you seen the
way she opens the mail?

689
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,046
Why didn't you
ever tell me?

690
00:38:41,118 --> 00:38:43,211
Figured it might
come in handy one day.

691
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,332
Gail, I like you.
I always have.

692
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,437
And I know you must've gotten
sucked up into a situation

693
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,063
you weren't able to control.

694
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,200
Really? Is that what
happened with you and House?

695
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:10,011
I'm not gonna back down just
because you threaten to smear me.

696
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,244
Now, if you agree
to tell the truth,

697
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:16,013
there are things
I can do to help.

698
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,513
Think about your
husband, your kids.

699
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,821
I know you're a good
person, deep down inside.

700
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:28,464
You can't completely hide everything
about yourself in seven years.

701
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,865
You're an idiot.

702
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:38,172
I started stealing from here
six months after you hired me.

703
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:42,434
You still don't even know the
half of it, and you never will.

704
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:45,482
You wouldn't have even found out
about this if I hadn't gotten sick.

705
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,609
And you aren't as tough
as you think you are.

706
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:52,053
There's no way you'd let
this job get taken away.

707
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:56,492
And if I go down,
you're going down.

708
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:16,273
Hey, can you tell Stan to give this
to the DEA agent when he comes by?

709
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,639
A flower?

710
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:18,841
Yeah,
Lucas gave it to me.

711
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,780
Thought it might come
in handy one day.

712
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:24,719
<i>I started stealing from here
six months after you hired me.</i>

713
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:26,790
Nice.

714
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:29,121
Least I came out
on top once today.

715
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:30,592
Where you going?

716
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:33,152
To hand the board
my resignation.

717
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:37,230
Hopefully whoever they hire to
replace me can still get the 8%.

718
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:45,873
Marina, I've been trying to
get in touch with you all day.

719
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,309
It's all right. I
understand. How is Rachel?

720
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,844
And the rash?

721
00:40:54,852 --> 00:40:57,150
Great. I'll be home early.

722
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,321
Perfect.

723
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:04,517
You bitch.

724
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,923
I didn't think
you'd actually do it.

725
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,194
I told you I would.

726
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:14,233
Call the dogs off.

727
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:19,108
You got your 12.

728
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:22,075
Congratulations.

729
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,783
Yes!

730
00:41:32,556 --> 00:41:33,750
Yes!

731
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,612
You gonna get that?
