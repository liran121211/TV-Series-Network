1
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,084
Who is it?

2
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:30,186
It's Tom.

3
00:00:31,598 --> 00:00:33,793
Tom, your husband?

4
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,191
What's he doing here?

5
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,969
Uh, what's going on?

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,274
I'm sorry. I know I'm
not supposed to be here.

7
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,248
But Evelyn's school
contract is due tomorrow.

8
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,807
I knew I was forgetting
something. Let me find a pen.

9
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:59,082
Hey.

10
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,751
Not quite sure what
Emily Post recommends

11
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,818
in this situation,
but I'm Tom.

12
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:05,091
Damien. Hi.

13
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:08,467
Sorry to intrude, I just... I wasn't
quite sure when she'd be coming home.

14
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,628
No problem.

15
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:12,534
Thank you so much
for catching this.

16
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:13,867
Yeah.

17
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,273
I'll get out of your way.
It was good to meet you,

18
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,833
and I'll see you
later, hon.

19
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,106
Bye.

20
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,915
So, he seems
like a nice guy.

21
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,818
Ooh.

22
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,989
Jules, you okay?

23
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:38,155
No, my stomach...

24
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,630
Here, lie down.

25
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,160
Ow!

26
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,636
Try to...

27
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:47,195
Get Tom.
Okay.

28
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:48,998
Ow!

29
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,133
Tom!

30
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:27,404
You know what
would be perfect?

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,469
Hmm.

32
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,448
French Toast Tower.

33
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,213
You still go to Mickey's?
What's your cholesterol?

34
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,686
It's my one vice.
I'm keeping it.

35
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,724
As much as I would love
to clog my arteries,

36
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:44,093
I have a 10:00 CT, and I still
have to race home, get changed.

37
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:48,900
Maybe you could keep
some clothes here.

38
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:52,061
Maybe I could.

39
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:56,867
He's just trying to
get into your skirts,

40
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,275
and I don't mean
metaphorically.

41
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:01,973
Well, he's got
the legs for it.

42
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,981
So, I will
see you tonight?

43
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,384
Yeah.

44
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,750
Bye, House.

45
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,090
Have a nice day.

46
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,892
"Have a nice day"?
How civilized.

47
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,165
I said I'd
stay out of it.

48
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,039
What?
Nothing.

49
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,442
Clearly something.

50
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,605
Nope.

51
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:36,239
House, on a list
of your attributes,

52
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,251
there's nothing that
even rhymes with "coy. "

53
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,415
Okay, I may have seen
something in the fridge.

54
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,582
Like the end of
your relationship.

55
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:50,092
She put the milk in the
door and not on the shelf.

56
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,528
It's not a big deal.

57
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,429
You hate that she did that,
but you didn't say anything.

58
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,693
You're trying to
get us to fight.

59
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,931
No, I'm trying to help. If
you got an issue, let her know.

60
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:02,441
I should've known that you
weren't done sabotaging this.

61
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:05,272
Fine.
Stew in your irritation.

62
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,007
Sure, last time it bubbled
over into resentment and rage,

63
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,810
leading ultimately
to a painful divorce

64
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:13,249
that neither of you have
ever really recovered from,

65
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,186
but I'm sure this time,
it'll be great.

66
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,758
Interesting case,
35-year-old woman

67
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,133
with fever and
abdominal pain.

68
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,468
ER ruled out all
the usual suspects.

69
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,530
Stop before you
interest me to death.

70
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,701
And she's in
an open marriage.

71
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,869
That's not interesting.
It's just weird.

72
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,039
Know what's weirder?

73
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,084
That other humans are
monogamous in the first place.

74
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,610
No other species on the
planet mates for life,

75
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,120
and if you're
gonna bring up swans,

76
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,553
they cheat like
everybody else.

77
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,557
They just have better
PR than rabbits.

78
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,492
Animals also eat their young
and kill their rivals.

79
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,392
That make it weird
that most of us don't?

80
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,226
Says the guy
whose opposable thumbs

81
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,893
have been all over how many
women who aren't his wife?

82
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,300
A functional open marriage
is like a unicorn.

83
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,928
It's a mythical creature
that doesn't exist.

84
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:07,404
Someone always
ends up unhappy.

85
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,773
Our patient's unhappy because she's
suffering from an intestinal blockage.

86
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,972
Boring. Now, I'm gonna have to
find a reason to rule it out.

87
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,811
What about
herpes colitis?

88
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,010
She picks up the infection
from one of her partners.

89
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,143
It takes root
in her colon.

90
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,243
STD panel was clean.

91
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,312
Chances are this couple was
unhappy in the first place.

92
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:26,449
This is their attempt to
save something that never...

93
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:31,989
Go on.

94
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:35,193
Herpes might not register if she
was exposed in the last six weeks.

95
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,704
But it would show up
on a barium enema.

96
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,298
Wait.
You're going to do it?

97
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:47,938
Gotta see if our patient is a
unicorn or just a slutty horse.

98
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,450
Think how much fun
Taub could be having.

99
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,918
Barium coats the inner
lining of your colon,

100
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:58,013
lets us get a good
look at it on the X-ray.

101
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,490
I can get somebody else
to pick up Evelyn.

102
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,322
I feel like I'm
abandoning you.

103
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,986
I'm on painkillers.

104
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,359
I'd rather this not be
what you think of

105
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,763
every time you
look at my butt.

106
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,764
Okay,
roll onto your side.

107
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,904
It's fill 'er up time.

108
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,179
So, is Evelyn
his new squeeze?

109
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,516
She's our daughter.

110
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,922
<i>Must be interesting, growing up
in a production of Oh! Calcutta!</i>

111
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:34,755
She's six.

112
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,523
She knows as much about our sex
life as any other kid her age.

113
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,865
You can explain
that she's the reason

114
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,127
the two of you
stayed married.

115
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,226
You've been in the room
five minutes.

116
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,328
You got us
all figured out.

117
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,431
Of course, you left out the
part where we love each other,

118
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:50,476
and we wanna
grow old together.

119
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:51,976
But you just don't
wanna be young together.

120
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,944
Look, when you
think about it,

121
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,878
tons of couples
do what we do.

122
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,108
It's just that
with most of them,

123
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,845
one spouse doesn't
know about it.

124
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,216
We decided
things work better

125
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,222
when people tell
each other the truth.

126
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,483
Tank's full.

127
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,223
I'll page
the radiology elves.

128
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,769
I'm not saying I hate it. It
just doesn't go with your eyes.

129
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:19,862
You hate it.

130
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,201
Little bit.

131
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,539
Any more heartless critiques
of my general appearance?

132
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,009
Nope. All done.

133
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,277
So, is she
as bendy as she looks?

134
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:34,676
Maya and I
are just friends.

135
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,244
No, you and I
are friends.

136
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,381
And you don't have coffee
with me three times a week.

137
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,483
She's an
interesting person.

138
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,551
She grew up in Ohio.
She has three brothers.

139
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,392
Fascinating. Last week that
Cambodian lab tech was telling us

140
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,330
how he survived
the Killing Fields,

141
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,197
and you left to
go get a donut.

142
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,826
So we flirt.
It's fun.

143
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,131
It's dangerous.

144
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,036
That woman would
totally do you.

145
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,869
You think?

146
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,102
Nothing is gonna happen.

147
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,041
All I'm saying is, if
you want to be on a diet,

148
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:03,070
you might want to stop hanging
out by the dessert cart.

149
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,315
X
- ray was clean. She doesn't have herpes colitis.

150
00:08:07,386 --> 00:08:08,648
Or abdominal pain.

151
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,552
It stopped hurting
during the X-ray,

152
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,716
which means it was just an
intestinal blockage that passed.

153
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,816
We should
discharge her.

154
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,294
Absolutely, there's no need
to find any underlying cause.

155
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,923
These things
never happen twice.

156
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,126
Take her digestive system
for a test drive.

157
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,964
Give her
a radio-opaque milkshake.

158
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,628
X- ray every 15 minutes
to see if it makes

159
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,969
any unscheduled stops
on the way through.

160
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,200
We'll be here all night.

161
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,505
No, Taub will
be here all night.

162
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:35,069
Go talk to the unicorn, then
tell me you don't believe.

163
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:37,581
I did an abdominal CT
on a kid today,

164
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:41,450
and found a six-inch bezoar
made entirely of gum.

165
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,514
I mean, who gives a three-year-old
an endless supply of gum...

166
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,154
You okay?

167
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,254
Yeah.

168
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,734
I mean, there was hair in it
and maybe a piece of paper.

169
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,171
<i>So, how long have
you been married?</i>

170
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:08,805
<i>One of the few drawbacks
of having an open marriage.</i>

171
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,679
<i>Nobody ever asks me about
current events or the weather.</i>

172
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,342
<i>The Yankees look
good this season.</i>

173
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,551
<i>Seven years.</i>

174
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:24,426
<i>And how long have you,
you know...</i>

175
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,263
<i>After three years,
we realized</i>

176
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,200
<i>that traditional marriage
was making us both miserable.</i>

177
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,997
<i>Most people get divorced
at that point.</i>

178
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,097
Yeah, we didn't want
to get divorced.

179
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,402
We still loved
each other.

180
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,967
<i>We just realized that
expecting one person</i>

181
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,640
<i>to fulfill all of your
needs forever is unrealistic.</i>

182
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,207
<i>There are happy monogamous
couples out there.</i>

183
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,845
Sure, one or two have
the perfect marriage.

184
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:52,357
Everybody else has figured
out how to settle for less.

185
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:56,725
I don't want to settle and
end up resenting my husband.

186
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:59,924
I'd rather get the 10% he
doesn't give me somewhere else

187
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:05,130
so that I can really appreciate
him for the 90% he does.

188
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,835
I think something's wrong.

189
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,401
<i>With your stomach?
My heart is racing.</i>

190
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,555
Try to take deep breaths. I'm
gonna try to slow your heart down.

191
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,221
Is this because
of the blockage?

192
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,623
No. It's not working.

193
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,955
Need a crash cart
in here!

194
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:40,902
I need a list of all your sexual
partners from the last six months.

195
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,065
Why?

196
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,369
Your wife had
an arrhythmia.

197
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:45,603
The progression of
symptoms from bowel to heart

198
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,612
makes a parasitic
infection most likely.

199
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,614
Since Julia hasn't been
out of the country...

200
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,808
The only place that
I've been recently

201
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,475
is a business trip
to Nebraska.

202
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:54,542
But either of you could
have picked up a bug

203
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,178
from one
of your partners.

204
00:10:58,357 --> 00:11:01,588
It's kind of complicated.

205
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:05,062
How many partners are we
talking about? Ballpark.

206
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,788
None.

207
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,232
None?

208
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,237
We have a great sex life.
I don't need anyone else.

209
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,205
So why not
just tell her that

210
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:16,639
and close this
whole thing up?

211
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:17,835
You married?

212
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,208
I was.

213
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,804
Did you ever agree to go see
a chick flick with your wife

214
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,747
or pretend to
enjoy classical music?

215
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,776
Stravinsky never groped my
wife in a Midtown hotel room.

216
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,084
She needs this.

217
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,786
I don't, but I don't want
her to feel bad about that.

218
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,262
He's lying.

219
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,696
Guy's got
a license to drill.

220
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:42,666
Why would he lie
about not using it?

221
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,827
That's not the lie.

222
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,701
The lie is that he gives
a crap how his wife feels.

223
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,763
If they're both screwing
around, that's one thing.

224
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,900
But she has a piece on
the side, and he doesn't?

225
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,409
The only way he'd
be okay with that

226
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,537
is if he's betraying her
in some other way.

227
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,410
Then in his mind,
it makes them even.

228
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,848
My unicorn isn't a unicorn.

229
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:01,250
It's a donkey with a
plunger stuck to its face.

230
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,288
Right, even a guy
who's not cheating

231
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:05,289
is doing it for
underhanded reasons.

232
00:12:05,357 --> 00:12:06,949
No, no, no,
he's not being cynical.

233
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:09,824
He's assuming the husband is
doing something to even the score.

234
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,523
Which means he thinks
there is a score.

235
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,623
Which means,
cheating swans aside,

236
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,691
House believes
in monogamy.

237
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,703
He's being romantic.

238
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:22,332
What I believe is that men are
genetically engineered to be jealous.

239
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:25,275
Doesn't matter if I think there's
a score. I guarantee you he does.

240
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,811
Any of the wife's
partners pan out?

241
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,114
She's been with two people other
than Tom in the last six months.

242
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:32,241
Neither of them have been
outside the Tri-State area.

243
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,546
So we're back
to the husband.

244
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:34,677
You just said you
believed he wasn't...

245
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,779
He's doing something
behind her back.

246
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,654
What better cover than a
business trip to Nebraska?

247
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:41,693
Like that's
really a place.

248
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,393
Let's find his travel
records and get back to work.

249
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:50,399
You seem pretty mellow
about this couple's deal.

250
00:12:50,469 --> 00:12:53,131
Thought you'd be first
in line to shake a finger.

251
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:56,174
They're still married.
I'm not.

252
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,233
Not that I could
ever do it.

253
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,211
I was jealous of House, and
Cameron never touched him.

254
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,976
Not counting the emotional fondling.

255
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:08,745
When my mom was dying,
my dad had an affair.

256
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,748
He told you this?

257
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:14,122
I'd seen them
get out of his car.

258
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:15,820
Two years after Mom died,
they got married.

259
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,627
Must've sucked.

260
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,596
At the time, yeah,

261
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:23,192
but looking back,
it makes sense.

262
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:24,497
My mom never
knew about it,

263
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:26,936
and he needed someone
to make him feel less alone.

264
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,600
He took care of my mom,
day in and day out,

265
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,404
for two and a half years
before she died.

266
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,709
He was devoted to her. Loving
someone else didn't change that.

267
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,113
So loving two people
at once is fine

268
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,617
as long as
one of them is dying?

269
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,676
Whoever's taking care
of me when I get sick,

270
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:45,349
I hope they've got someone
else to take care of them.

271
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:49,485
Tom was
telling the truth.

272
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:51,689
He really did go
to Nebraska.

273
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,460
Plane ticket and
restaurant receipts.

274
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,364
Forget Nebraska.

275
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:01,362
Maybe they just bought
their parasites at the mall.

276
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,371
You know, we should really
throw away that loofah.

277
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,275
They're imported. Sometimes
they're not sterilized.

278
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,507
We think our patient got
amoebiasis from hers.

279
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,573
She going to be okay?

280
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,277
We're treating now.
She should be fine.

281
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,115
It's actually
kind of bizarre.

282
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,489
She and her husband
have an open marriage.

283
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,263
They sleep
with other people?

284
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,563
Well, she does. Her husband's
totally fine with it.

285
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:30,659
That's crazy, right?

286
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,505
And you're bringing
this up because...

287
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,648
I thought
it was interesting.

288
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,911
More interesting than
your other cases, I guess.

289
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,780
You talk about your colleagues.
You rant about House.

290
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:53,518
You don't usually
mention your patients.

291
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,664
Is open marriage
something you want?

292
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,996
No. I mean...

293
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,136
I know you'd never...

294
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,043
All this time and
energy you spent

295
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,547
convincing me
you weren't cheating.

296
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:17,741
And there's
somebody else.

297
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:21,013
I'm not... Would you
like some more water, sir?

298
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,728
Okay.

299
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,526
There's a woman at work. People
say she's attracted to me.

300
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,073
But nothing's happened.
Nothing's going to happen.

301
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:43,631
I'm not having an affair.

302
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,199
But you want to.

303
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:49,236
No, honey,
I'm trying to be honest.

304
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,375
I don't want to make
the same mistakes.

305
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,248
Be honest then.

306
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,811
Are you attracted to her?

307
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:06,730
Look, she's attractive.
There's an attraction.

308
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,529
Aren't there men who
make you feel that way?

309
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:10,863
Of course, there are.

310
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:15,100
But it never occurs to me to
act on it, because I'm married.

311
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,367
To you.

312
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,607
And that's enough for me.

313
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,806
Aren't I enough for you?

314
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,644
Of course, you are.

315
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,088
Our patient's lost
all movement in her legs.

316
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,582
There are other doctors,
Chris. We're talking.

317
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:39,529
I'm sorry.
The woman's paralyzed.

318
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,460
I'll get a cab.

319
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,908
Tests show
no spinal cord injury,

320
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,009
no cerebral lesions,
no hemorrhage.

321
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,384
We finally got a stool
sample. The loofah's innocent.

322
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,117
No sign of amoebas
or any other parasite.

323
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:10,059
So paralysis, arrhythmia,
intermittent abdominal pain.

324
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,263
And he nicked
himself shaving.

325
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:19,432
Sorry, that was Taub. But
it was easier to solve.

326
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,666
Means he used the crappy
razor in his locker,

327
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,037
which means
he slept here.

328
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,166
Thanks to you.

329
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:29,574
I brought up open marriage
with Rachel.

330
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:30,808
It was a disaster.

331
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,654
On the medical front, we've
knocked out sex and foreign travel.

332
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,748
Could be
an electrolyte imbalance.

333
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,452
So the only time
you're not interested

334
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,755
in my marriage is
after you blow it up?

335
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,626
You were the moron who took
marital advice from Tila Tequila.

336
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:47,221
You pushed me
into this.

337
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,800
Figured it would either blow up
your marriage or make it more honest.

338
00:17:49,868 --> 00:17:51,335
Either way, you win.

339
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,268
What about sex?

340
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,396
I'm talking
about the patient.

341
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,497
Is that cool
with everybody?

342
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,666
We ruled out sex.

343
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,972
We ruled out sex
with other people.

344
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,774
Tom said he and Julia have been
doing it three or four times a week.

345
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:03,678
And she's got
boys on the side.

346
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,185
Increased libido can be a symptom
of adrenocortical carcinoma,

347
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,152
which also explains
her other symptoms.

348
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,486
A woman who likes sex
must be sick?

349
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,025
Just because
everybody in this room

350
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:17,859
wishes that all women were horny
all the time doesn't make it so.

351
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,895
Get an MRI of
her adrenal glands.

352
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:30,703
Hi.

353
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:33,643
Okay if I take
the sports page?

354
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,077
Sure.

355
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,720
Would you mind
using a coaster?

356
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,620
Oh. Sure. Sorry.

357
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:47,784
It's okay.

358
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,797
Also, it'd be great
if you'd replace

359
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:57,495
the toilet paper
when you finish a roll.

360
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,161
And when you load
the dishwasher,

361
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,604
you can't put a big,
flat bowl on the bottom.

362
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,165
It traps the water so
nothing on the top gets clean.

363
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:07,576
And please don't throw banana
peels in the bedroom trash...

364
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:11,013
I haven't done
any of those things.

365
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,710
You're probably
not even aware...

366
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:13,944
I hate bananas.

367
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,026
Oh, my God.
It was House.

368
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,292
I'm sorry. He's been
trying to get us to fight.

369
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,595
Why would he think that
stuff would make us fight?

370
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,603
Because of the milk.
You put it in the door.

371
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,538
The body of the refrigerator
is the coldest part.

372
00:19:35,607 --> 00:19:36,835
The temperature in
the door fluctuates,

373
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:37,933
which decreases
shelf life...

374
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,946
Wow. When did
you get all OCD?

375
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,414
I just want clean dishes
and unspoiled milk

376
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,609
so we can all
stay healthy.

377
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,409
Oh. It's about health?

378
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,981
What about the coaster? Does that
replenish my B12 or something?

379
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,184
Can we just drop it?

380
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,317
Sure.

381
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:05,402
You have this
list of annoyances

382
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,700
the entire time
we were married?

383
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,741
Get better, Mommy.

384
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,644
I love you, rabbit.

385
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,982
Julia, you have a guest.

386
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:24,751
Hi.
This isn't a good time.

387
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:28,989
Dr. Hadley, did you say there
was a video game in the playroom?

388
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,928
Maybe you can teach me
how to play one of them?

389
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,328
See you in Radiology.

390
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,364
Get out of
my wife's room.

391
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,339
Your relationship with her
stays out of our space.

392
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,635
I was worried about her.

393
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,109
Tom's right.
You should go.

394
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,380
So it's fine
if we have sex,

395
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,972
but if I drop by
to see if you're okay...

396
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,381
This is our family.

397
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,222
Sorry.

398
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,166
I spent two years
of residency

399
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,293
wearing shirts that
were a size too small.

400
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,168
How hard is it to ask me
not to put them in the dryer?

401
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:16,537
And I only did your laundry
because you were never home.

402
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,700
I didn't ask you to.

403
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,243
Of course you didn't.
You just got annoyed

404
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,040
whenever you didn't
have clean underwear.

405
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,205
I never said
I was annoyed.

406
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,909
That's the point.
You didn't say anything.

407
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,974
So I'm getting a lecture
on communication

408
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:30,215
from someone who had her lawyer
inform me our marriage was over.

409
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,825
Asking for an open marriage.
You got stones.

410
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:41,332
Conversation sort of got away
from me. It was a train wreck.

411
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,765
I think it's good
you brought it up.

412
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,098
I read a study that found
men who have multiple copies

413
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,501
of a certain
vasopressin receptor

414
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,096
are twice as likely
to be unfaithful.

415
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:51,301
Maybe you're just
one of those guys.

416
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,403
So my cheating is biologically
predetermined. Fantastic.

417
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,914
Multiply times five. We need
a better look at the medulla.

418
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,143
I thought
you'd be relieved.

419
00:21:59,217 --> 00:22:01,014
This gets you off the
hook. It's just genetics.

420
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,520
I'm 5'6" and have
a receding hairline.

421
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,988
I hate genetics.
Medulla's clean.

422
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,719
I don't see you wearing
lifts or hair plugs.

423
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,852
That's because being short
and bald doesn't hurt anybody.

424
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,624
The only thing hurtful about
your other genetic predisposition

425
00:22:12,698 --> 00:22:14,222
is that you keep
denying it.

426
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,597
It's not good
for you or Rachel.

427
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,532
There's nothing there.
It's not adrenal cancer.

428
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,163
And maybe you're
right about me,

429
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,468
but I'm not going
to stop trying.

430
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:24,702
Rachel's worth it.

431
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:28,735
Look up there. The lung. What is that?

432
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,578
You served me
with divorce papers

433
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,709
in the middle of a medical
conference in New Orleans!

434
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,650
I threw a bottle
into an antique mirror.

435
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:38,417
You exhibited an emotion. I
wish I'd known you were capable.

436
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:39,548
I loved you.

437
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,785
I thought I was gonna be following
you to Baltimore, remember?

438
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,226
I called about apartments.
I set up interviews.

439
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,957
How could you think that we
still had a real marriage?

440
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,828
We hadn't had
a conversation in months.

441
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,992
Maybe because I was working
two jobs to support us.

442
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,195
No! No, it's because
when you were home,

443
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,760
it was like talking
to a block of ice.

444
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,636
You were obviously
so pissed off at me...

445
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,505
I was killing myself so that you
could take that non-paying internship.

446
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,635
That you said
that I should take.

447
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:00,735
I was trying to
be supportive!

448
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,801
Why do I have to
be the bad guy?

449
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,348
Expressing yourself does
not make you the bad guy.

450
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,510
Okay, then, you were
being a selfish bitch.

451
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,451
<i>VIQ scan confirmed the spot
on Julia's lung was a clot.</i>

452
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:15,289
Think there's a chance
the husband's a plushie?

453
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,761
If he has a secret, I highly doubt
it's more relevant than the clot.

454
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,320
Clotting disorder
would explain everything.

455
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,865
Question is, which one?

456
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:25,994
Do you read any of
your departmental memos?

457
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,005
Only the ones
labeled NSFW.

458
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,804
Accounting notified you two days
ago about your patient's insurance.

459
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,902
Sorry. That's NNSFW.

460
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:38,040
Here. He doesn't have any.
Try not to bankrupt them.

461
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:41,677
I'm long past the number of
procedures that'll bankrupt them.

462
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,187
Julia's got insurance. I saw
the policy number on the forms.

463
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,281
The policy lapsed
due to non-payment.

464
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,825
I already made
three calls about this.

465
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,020
She should have
been aware of that.

466
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,095
No, that's just
a mistake.

467
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:58,932
Of course we have
health insurance.

468
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:03,465
We're actually a little
behind on the premiums.

469
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,106
But I pulled money out of my
retirement account to cover it.

470
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:08,612
They said that we'll be fine in a few...

471
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,706
Why the retirement account?

472
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:16,680
We'll just give you
a few minutes to...

473
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:19,155
By "we,"
she means "she. "

474
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:24,027
I lost all of
our savings.

475
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,364
Sounds like
a secret to me.

476
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,232
I started her on heparin
to prevent further clots,

477
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,037
but we still don't know
what's going on.

478
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:40,270
Of course the husband's
secret was money.

479
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,336
If it's not sex,
it's always money.

480
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:44,882
Unless it's sex
for money.

481
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,008
How did he lose it
anyway?

482
00:24:46,084 --> 00:24:48,245
It's not medically relevant.
You're not going to care.

483
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,254
Wilson's been teaching me
how to care. Try me.

484
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,689
He builds wind turbines and leases
them out to local power companies...

485
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,225
You're right.
I don't care.

486
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:59,354
Clotting disorder. DIC, Factor V
Leiden, Antiphospholipid syndrome.

487
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,023
Vitamin K deficiency
also fits,

488
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,192
causes thrombophilia and is
consistent with abdominal pain.

489
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,903
Congratulations, House.
Sam ended it.

490
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,228
What happened?

491
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,670
Go test
our patient's blood.

492
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,039
It can wait
five minutes.

493
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,374
For everything
we discussed.

494
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:22,377
I'm sorry.

495
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,447
Well, at least you're actually taking
responsibility for once in your life.

496
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,961
I'm sorry that she left,
but it's not my fault.

497
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,461
I didn't even want
to get involved.

498
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,622
You dragged it
out of me.

499
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,631
What about the dishwasher
and the banana?

500
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,670
Yeah, she left
because of the banana.

501
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,704
I just wanted you to stand up for
yourself, tell her what you want.

502
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:47,438
If doing that causes her to
walk out for the second time,

503
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,605
well, then your relationship
wasn't going to last anyway.

504
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,205
Or you could've
stayed out of it.

505
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,409
I could've kept
my mouth shut,

506
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,213
been annoyed sometimes,
but I'd be happy,

507
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,754
because I'd
still be with her.

508
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,187
Now all I have
is cold milk.

509
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,728
As long as you're free,
you want to grab some dinner?

510
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:10,563
Did Tom go home
for the night?

511
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:14,366
For starters. I told him to
leave. I don't want him here.

512
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,738
Money is
a complicated subject.

513
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,471
Yeah, it's not the money.

514
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:22,638
I mean,
the money is bad, but...

515
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,583
When we first
opened our marriage,

516
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:32,248
I got involved with a guy
who lied about being single.

517
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:34,792
And one day,
his wife calls me.

518
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:39,728
She's crying, and screaming,
and totally out of control.

519
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,695
And I felt

520
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:45,730
superior.

521
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,001
I thought, "I don't ever have
to worry about feeling this way,

522
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,703
"because Tom and I are
honest with each other. "

523
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,847
Well, here I am.

524
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,678
Hi.

525
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,622
Sorry I didn't make it
home last night.

526
00:27:10,695 --> 00:27:14,722
I needed to
run some tests.

527
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,634
You know what the worst part
was when you had your affair?

528
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,501
It wasn't the sex.

529
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:24,564
It was the lies.

530
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:32,442
Realizing that the narrative
of my life was totally wrong.

531
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,610
You weren't
stuck in surgery.

532
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,677
You weren't
out of town.

533
00:27:37,255 --> 00:27:40,224
I don't wanna go
through that again.

534
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:42,724
I told you,
nothing's going...

535
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,125
Thursday nights.

536
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,565
You have to be home
by midnight.

537
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:54,037
You don't bring her here, you
don't talk to her about me,

538
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:57,802
and I don't want to meet
her ever in any context.

539
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:08,643
Are you giving me permission
to sleep with other women?

540
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,416
It's what you want,
isn't it?

541
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,116
I want you.

542
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:16,892
No, you want
more than me.

543
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:19,156
You want that thrill.

544
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,436
But I love you, and I really
believe that you love me.

545
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:30,030
And we have
a good life together.

546
00:28:30,108 --> 00:28:34,511
And at this point,
either I walk away,

547
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:37,343
or I try to accept
who you really are.

548
00:28:39,751 --> 00:28:41,810
Tomorrow's Thursday.

549
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,285
Yes, it is.

550
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,819
All our tests
came back negative.

551
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,693
It's not
a clotting disorder.

552
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:57,098
Which means we need to
come up with a better idea.

553
00:28:57,168 --> 00:29:01,070
So what causes problems in
the stomach, heart, nerves...

554
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:04,504
Oh, my God.

555
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:07,972
You know what it is?

556
00:29:13,284 --> 00:29:17,414
Taub's wife gave the green
light for an open marriage.

557
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,788
He's wearing cologne
but not the stink of shame.

558
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,451
You've got a date?

559
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:27,294
I am going out with Maya
tonight with Rachel's blessing.

560
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,364
<i>Mazel tov?</i>

561
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,066
Maybe the problem
isn't her blood.

562
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,834
Maybe it's the vessels
carrying the blood.

563
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,670
No sign of schistocytes
or hemolysis.

564
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:40,438
So you're actually going
to sleep with another woman,

565
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,774
then go home
to your wife?

566
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:44,838
Thank God someone's keeping us
focused on what's really important.

567
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:47,111
Taub was going to do
all of that anyway.

568
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:48,777
Pulmonary
arterial hypertension?

569
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:52,345
Imaging showed normal diameter
in her pulmonary artery.

570
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:57,520
Here's a thought. Taub's wife
is now totally on the market.

571
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,062
Mind hitting me
with her digits?

572
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,865
She would love that,
but duty calls.

573
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:12,838
What's the matter?

574
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:14,139
My stomach.

575
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:15,372
Same pain as before?

576
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,141
Yeah. Worse.

577
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,409
Get the portable
ultrasound in here.

578
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,508
We need to get
a look at her belly.

579
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:21,984
Help me.

580
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,756
Pain, pain went away,
came back another day.

581
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,655
Question is,
what brought it back?

582
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:36,723
Physical exam was unrevealing.
Ultrasound was clean.

583
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:37,825
So afterwards,
you gonna shower

584
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:39,130
at your girlfriend's
or at home?

585
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,069
Patient. Abdominal pain.

586
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,404
Yeah, he's right. Let's get
this wrapped up before 6:00.

587
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,875
Taub turns back into a
faithful pumpkin at midnight.

588
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:50,073
The patient was out with her
boy-toy before she came in.

589
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,945
Maybe the pain was triggered
by sexual excitement.

590
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,712
Because lying alone
in a hospital bed,

591
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:56,879
contemplating
bankruptcy? Hot.

592
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,116
My point was that
arousal is a function

593
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,817
of the parasympathetic
nervous system.

594
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:02,325
If that's where
the problem is,

595
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,224
the pain could be triggered
by crying, which seems...

596
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,855
PNS also controls digestion,
which she's been doing

597
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:09,024
without screaming her head
off since she's been here.

598
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,762
What if what matters isn't when the
pain started, but when it stopped?

599
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,236
It was during an X-ray.
You think that cured her?

600
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,206
No, but House prepped her for
the X-ray with a barium enema.

601
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:19,072
That wouldn't treat
anything except...

602
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,038
Go.

603
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:26,208
You're in pain because part of
your intestine folded in on itself.

604
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:27,444
It's called
an intussusception.

605
00:31:27,518 --> 00:31:29,042
It's cutting off blood flow.
We need to fix it

606
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,917
before your bowel
gets necrotic and dies.

607
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,456
Once you do that,
will I get better?

608
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:33,547
When this happens
in adults,

609
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:35,115
it's usually a sign
of abdominal cancer.

610
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:37,889
We'll fix the overlap, and then
search your intestine for tumors.

611
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,491
Foam?

612
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,631
I have a bad feeling
about this.

613
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,437
A friend can't
spontaneously buy

614
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,503
an overpriced Italian espresso
machine for another friend?

615
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,480
What did you do?

616
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:00,210
Nothing,
that's the beauty.

617
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:03,119
I genuinely tried
to help Wilson.

618
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:04,381
I told him to
stand up for himself,

619
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,116
which you know is
legitimate advice.

620
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,215
And his relationship
blew up.

621
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:09,988
Is he okay?
He'll be fine.

622
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:12,120
Point is,
I realized something.

623
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,996
I do nice things, nice things
happen to me. Karma works.

624
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,365
So you're
paying it forward?

625
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:24,835
If this should somehow lead
to Lucas dying or oral sex,

626
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,876
so be it.

627
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,684
You think I should
wear a tie tonight?

628
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:39,882
This isn't weird at all.

629
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:45,190
I mean, where's Rachel eating tonight?

630
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,423
Home.

631
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:50,790
What if she's
going out, too?

632
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,665
She's allowed to, right?

633
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,638
Of course,
it's only fair.

634
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:56,731
But I don't think
she will.

635
00:32:57,408 --> 00:33:00,172
Your wife only
eats dinner at home?

636
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:05,512
If she did go out,
that'd be tough.

637
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,952
But I think
I can handle it.

638
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,350
Don't do it
unless you're sure.

639
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,945
I know I'd rather be
jealous than a liar.

640
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,425
Got something here.
Kelly clamp and scalpel.

641
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,394
<i>Biopsy showed
non-specific inflammation,</i>

642
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,055
which suggests IBD.

643
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,190
Only that doesn't explain
the cardiac problems.

644
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:24,257
Or her declining
kidney function.

645
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,667
We ran panels
during surgery.

646
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,299
Actually,
IBD does make sense,

647
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,037
'cause it can trigger
ankylosing spondylitis,

648
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,443
which would explain the
heart and the kidneys.

649
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,812
Start her on sulfasalazine
and TNF-inhibitors.

650
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:41,215
And Taub,
I'm not gonna see you

651
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,411
before you head off
for Gomorrah.

652
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,986
Just remember,
if you get disoriented,

653
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,953
Breathe through your nose
and look for the horizon.

654
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:06,607
I can't.

655
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,770
I really thought
I could do this.

656
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:15,180
Logically,
it makes perfect sense.

657
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:19,879
But all afternoon,

658
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:26,457
all I kept thinking about
was the two of you together,

659
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,997
and you touching her...

660
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,834
Nothing's happened.
It's okay.

661
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:35,803
I'm sorry.

662
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:37,968
'Cause I really wanted...

663
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,634
No.

664
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:45,881
I've been an idiot. I don't need
anything else. I just need you.

665
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:47,542
You mean that?

666
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,014
I do.

667
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,191
I love you, Rachel.

668
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,557
I love you, too.

669
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,559
Let's go home.

670
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,892
Is that okay?

671
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,134
There are other doctors.

672
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,376
The treatment's
not working.

673
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,811
Her left kidney
failed last night.

674
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,041
The other one's
right behind it.

675
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,346
It's not
ankylosing spondylitis.

676
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,080
Kidney biopsy showed
she had IgA nephropathy,

677
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:26,988
which could be caused by or associated
with any of these conditions.

678
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,322
We've gone from too
few ideas to too many,

679
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:31,588
and our patient is
running out of time.

680
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,695
Why the lack
of afterglow?

681
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:36,858
Physio girl not as freaky
as you'd hoped?

682
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,161
I went home with my wife.

683
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,932
After all that?
You chickened out.

684
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,671
I can't hurt
Rachel like that.

685
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,372
Sickle cell anemia would've
shown on blood tests.

686
00:35:49,447 --> 00:35:52,814
No flattened intestinal
villi rules out celiac...

687
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,410
Seriously?

688
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,820
Our patient is dying, and we
can't move past my sex life?

689
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,688
Seriously?
You think it'd kill her

690
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:03,750
if we spent 15 seconds
mocking you?

691
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:05,861
Time's up.

692
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,832
Normal liver enzymes
rules out Hep B and cirrhosis.

693
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:13,029
Alport and Anti-GBM antibody
are both untreatable,

694
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:15,231
so if she has them,
we can't help her.

695
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,399
And it can't be
Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

696
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,569
No inciting respiratory
infection and no rash.

697
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:21,839
I don't care
what it's not.

698
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,039
I wanna know
what it could be.

699
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:26,208
Well, everything
left on the list.

700
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,445
The list was
not created equal.

701
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,850
Neither was man,
by the way.

702
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:33,186
Hemochromatosis is a possibility.
Excess iron builds up,

703
00:36:33,257 --> 00:36:34,417
causes problems
throughout the body.

704
00:36:34,492 --> 00:36:37,586
Weil's Syndrome also affects
multiple organ systems.

705
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,186
And it wouldn't
have been treated

706
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:41,163
by the antibiotic
the ER gave her.

707
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:43,700
Sarcoidosis
makes sense, too.

708
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:46,794
Good.
Treat for those three.

709
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,542
I think
you should call Tom.

710
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,613
Am I going to die?

711
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:00,311
I don't know.

712
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:02,883
If he walked in here
right now,

713
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,855
I'd look at his face, and
all I would think is "liar. "

714
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:08,187
Don't you think
that's kind of unfair?

715
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:09,749
You say honesty
is all-important,

716
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,192
but you conveniently
ignore the truth

717
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:13,730
that some truths
hurt people.

718
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,392
Tom lied to protect you.

719
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:18,230
He was covering his ass.

720
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,668
I'm not talking
about the money.

721
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:26,868
Tom hasn't slept with
anyone else in over a year.

722
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,874
He told you that?

723
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,712
So my entire marriage
is a sham.

724
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,253
No.

725
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:40,688
Your husband,
who only wants you,

726
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,521
lied so that
you could be happy.

727
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:46,029
That seems
pretty real to me.

728
00:37:50,835 --> 00:37:51,824
Yeah?

729
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,470
Hey.
Hey.

730
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,909
Listen, I'm sorry.

731
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:11,181
Me, too.
I shouldn't have said...

732
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:14,224
No. You were right.
I was selfish back then.

733
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:19,060
I'm trying to change.

734
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,997
And I don't know if
it's House or what,

735
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:24,766
but you're different, too.

736
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,561
I'm trying.

737
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:35,135
I always thought that
I was keeping the peace.

738
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,203
But I was just
resenting you

739
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:39,545
and giving you
a reason to leave.

740
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:49,190
I wish we had this fight
10 years ago.

741
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,431
Is it okay if we don't
give House the credit?

742
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,092
I recommend it.

743
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:11,009
0- for-3, her kidney
function is still declining.

744
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,277
We're going to need
to start dialysis.

745
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,182
Glad
the husband's back.

746
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,186
After missing
so many little deaths,

747
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:19,119
he should be here
for the big one.

748
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,521
Top six, anyone?

749
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:22,354
Polyarteritis Nodosa?

750
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:25,725
We would've seen some
improvement on prednisone.

751
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,591
Guy's wife is dying.
He stops to buy flowers.

752
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:33,466
They're from his garden.
Mercury poisoning fits.

753
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,368
Those are lilacs.

754
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,678
My mom used
to grow lilacs.

755
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:43,577
My dad made her
get rid of them

756
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,979
'cause there were
too many bees.

757
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,043
We ruled out HSP because there was
no inciting respiratory infection.

758
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,318
But in rare cases, it can also
be triggered by a bee sting.

759
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,292
We also ruled it out
because there's no rash.

760
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,260
Maybe we just
didn't see it.

761
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:07,433
Have you been stung
by a bee recently?

762
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,530
About a month ago.

763
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,942
What's going on?

764
00:40:13,644 --> 00:40:17,512
I think your wife has
Henoch-Schonlein purpura,

765
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,675
systemic vasculitis
that can cause lesions

766
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,412
and inflammation
throughout the body.

767
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,113
It's pretty awful,

768
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:28,625
which explains why it was named
after a German. Actually, two Germans.

769
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,991
Lesions can pop up
in the heart,

770
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:32,790
sometimes
in the kidneys.

771
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:37,391
But always on the skin. Means
you'd have a rash somewhere.

772
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,662
I don't.

773
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,896
Not that you know of.

774
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,469
Okay, I'm going to have to check
your holes. I'll start with the mouth.

775
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,512
If there's nothing there, then
things might have to get kinky.

776
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:49,978
Say "ah. "

777
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:51,105
Ah.

778
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,176
I was kind of
hoping for kinky.

779
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,810
Is that good or bad?

780
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,323
We'll treat her with high-dose
IVIg and cyclophosphamide.

781
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,858
You should be fine.

782
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,085
I'm going to be okay.

783
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,265
I love you.

784
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:12,598
That is adorable.

785
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,071
Other than you still wanting
to have sex with other dudes

786
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,437
and him bankrupting
your family,

787
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:20,773
I think you kids are
pretty much home free.

788
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,482
And...

789
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:32,280
You two made up?

790
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,187
No.

791
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,453
You can
thank me later.

792
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,017
I'm all in.

793
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,130
All right.

794
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,525
Fold.
Jesus.

795
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:52,974
Nervous?

796
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:56,501
I'm getting there. I'm
getting some nervousness.

797
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,437
You need a hand?

798
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,547
Thanks.

799
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,922
Sorry about canceling
the other night.

800
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,592
Me, too.

801
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:05,445
You wanna
go somewhere?
