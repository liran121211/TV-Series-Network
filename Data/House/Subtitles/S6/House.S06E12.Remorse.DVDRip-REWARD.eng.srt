1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,168
How am I supposed to walk into
that meeting with no presentation?

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,568
How the hell did
you screw this up?

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:06,696
It wasn't me.

4
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:08,764
She's lying.
No. We agreed...

5
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,332
Her team had
all the financials.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,002
And we were swamped
modeling them,

7
00:00:12,078 --> 00:00:14,444
that's why we agreed that
you would do the slides.

8
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:15,606
Well, one of you
screwed up.

9
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,343
So please try
to figure it out,

10
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,509
'cause when
the client dumps me,

11
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:20,018
I need to know
who to fire.

12
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:23,078
I confirmed in the e-mail.
Hold on. Here.

13
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,326
She did tell you
about it, Russ.

14
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,700
I never got this.

15
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,802
Russ, are you okay?

16
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:43,909
Are you drunk?

17
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,535
I'm not drunk.

18
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,415
I'm not drunk. I'm...

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,218
I had no idea
he was drinking again.

20
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,394
Well, you should have.

21
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,222
Give me five minutes, I'll
go to the business center

22
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:05,924
and print the graphs directly
from the spreadsheets.

23
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,627
Run. And bring me
some paper towels.

24
00:01:12,705 --> 00:01:13,865
What?

25
00:01:15,475 --> 00:01:16,999
Oh, it hurts.

26
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,442
Don't tell me
you were drinking, too.

27
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,910
No.

28
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,414
My ears. Oh, my God.

29
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,648
Twenty-seven-year-old female, intense
intermittent ear pain, saw six doctors...

30
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:03,621
Tell her to stop
lurking in the front row.

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,157
If she wants to
hit on musicians,

32
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,989
that's what tour buses
are for. Next.

33
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,858
If I ask why we're
in Wilson's office,

34
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:12,090
is there any chance
I'll get a straight answer?

35
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,598
Try it, try it.

36
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,394
Fourteen-year-old boy, joint
pain and excess hair growth.

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,496
Tell him to masturbate no
more than three times daily.

38
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,404
With meals. Next.

39
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:26,536
Did I mention that the
27-year-old female is really hot?

40
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,877
And her husband
is really not.

41
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:30,643
Wild guess. He's rich.

42
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:35,211
Not unless social workers have begun
pulling in the big money recently.

43
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,787
Give me.

44
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,290
You're taking the case
because she's hot?

45
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,691
No, that would be
an accident of genetics.

46
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,355
It's because she's hot
and her husband is ugly.

47
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,126
That's a fascinating window into
the mysteries of human psychology.

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,031
Also, she's "really" hot.

49
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,662
Or she, you know,
loves her husband.

50
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:52,762
She loves something
about him.

51
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,364
Vitamin deficiency. She changed
her diet a few months ago.

52
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,569
To a healthier diet.
Raw foods, lots of nuts.

53
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,803
It's not the ear,
it's the heart.

54
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,182
Her protein was cheese,
which can raise cholesterol.

55
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:08,311
Hers was already elevated,
gave her arterial blockages.

56
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,415
Cardiac arrhythmia presenting
as ear pain. Very rare. Cool.

57
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,620
So Beauty and the Beast.
Who wants to go see?

58
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:39,408
Let's see. Dr. Taub,
Foreman, Chase and Hadley.

59
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,713
Four for four.

60
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,379
Wow, I can't believe
I get all these doctors.

61
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,854
And such
good-looking ones, too.

62
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:46,391
Yeah, it's almost like we
don't all need to be here.

63
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,792
Your case presented a very
interesting diagnostic challenge.

64
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:50,954
Oh.

65
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,797
You can't sleep
in your own office?

66
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,000
Or bedroom,
for that matter?

67
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,840
Got to avoid my
natural habitat.

68
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:10,042
Some idiot I went to med school
with keeps leaving messages,

69
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,583
wants to drop by
for lunch.

70
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,209
So tell him "no. "

71
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,344
It's complicated.

72
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,388
It's too complicated for you
to tell someone

73
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,651
you don't like
to screw off?

74
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,818
That's practically
your hobby.

75
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:25,694
A few months ago, he was
sort of part of my therapy.

76
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,836
My shrink told me write a letter
of apology to someone I hurt.

77
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,935
And how did you hurt him?

78
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,270
We were in a seminar
on flatworm genetics.

79
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:37,172
I switched my final paper
with his.

80
00:04:37,243 --> 00:04:39,143
You plagiarized?
Doesn't sound like you.

81
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,509
I was testing a theory.

82
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,515
I thought that our professor
was biased against me.

83
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,380
I assumed he'd get a
high grade with my paper,

84
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,011
and I'd get
a low grade with his.

85
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,716
Interestingly, I was wrong. I got an A.

86
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,088
So you're in this
mental hospital,

87
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,059
delving into
your subconscious,

88
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,221
and this is who you choose
to apologize to?

89
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,390
Yep. Lorenzo Wibberly.

90
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,160
Of all the people in
the world you've hurt...

91
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,533
Not everyone has a name that's so
easy to find in the White Pages.

92
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:06,469
I'm in there.
And so is Cuddy.

93
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,269
Yeah. Yet I picked him.
It's funny, isn't it?

94
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,468
Yes, it's hilarious.

95
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,774
Great to see what a
success your therapy was.

96
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,208
We said we'd never
to go to sleep angry!

97
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,783
We did find an arrhythmia, but it's
not from your arteries, they're clean.

98
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,014
Will the pain
come back?

99
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,057
We'll start her on cardiac
meds, that should help.

100
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:27,854
But we still need to figure out
what's causing the arrhythmia.

101
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,417
Hey, Valerie.

102
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,690
Russ.

103
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,230
It's so nice of you
to stop by.

104
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,964
I got lots of
free time now.

105
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:38,901
You don't blame me,
do you?

106
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,836
You were drunk
in front of Norris.

107
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,968
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm drunk now.

108
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,846
Then, it was like someone
poisoned me or something.

109
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:55,452
Maybe you should
come back later.

110
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,281
Okay.

111
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,252
I just wanna
say goodbye.

112
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,024
Okay, Russ.
Thank you for coming by.

113
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:10,894
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing?

114
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:13,600
You poor
son of a bitch.

115
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,470
She doesn't love you any
more than she loved me.

116
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,304
Okay, you need
to leave right now.

117
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,470
You're pretending you had
an affair with my wife?

118
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,742
Yeah, we're all pretending.
You got nothing to worry about.

119
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,784
Tell them where you were
six months ago, Russ.

120
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:31,588
I had a breakdown. I had some
paranoid tendencies, as they say.

121
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:35,218
But it turns out, I had
a right to be paranoid.

122
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,818
You need help.

123
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,123
Get him out of here.

124
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,826
Okay. Okay.

125
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,408
Oh, my God.

126
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,877
Are you okay?
You okay?

127
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,210
Yeah, I'm okay.

128
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,810
We'll keep an eye out. He's not
getting back in the hospital.

129
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,548
He's making all that up.
You know that, right?

130
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,318
Yeah, of course.

131
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:13,223
<i>Where are you?</i>

132
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,561
Undisclosed location.

133
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:15,658
<i>Who are you
hiding from?</i>

134
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,724
Wilson.

135
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,502
<i>And the lunch date
that Wilson is,</i>

136
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,732
<i>no doubt, right now,
trying to sic on me.</i>

137
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:23,799
<i>But in the great game of
chess that is our relationship,</i>

138
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,777
Wilson sees only one
move ahead, I see dozens.

139
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,505
<i>That is why he will
never mate me.</i>

140
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,082
That's a chess term.

141
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:36,053
<i>That's great. A co-worker
confronted our patient.</i>

142
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,683
<i>Altered mental status. Basically
accused her of poisoning him.</i>

143
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,781
We think
he was projecting.

144
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,350
<i>So he's poisoning her.</i>

145
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:43,554
What could
he get his hands on

146
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,563
to cause supraventricular tachycardia?

147
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,528
Does he have dry skin,
thin eyebrows?

148
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,795
If you're sharing an amazed
look, please do it louder.

149
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,636
He might have.
How did you know that?

150
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,608
<i>He has hypothyroidism,</i>

151
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:58,871
<i>he dumped his meds
in her coffee,</i>

152
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,640
that would make her heart
go boom, in a bad way.

153
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,772
<i>We'll treat
with beta blockers.</i>

154
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:04,612
I'm sorry,
but I totally disagree.

155
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,412
<i>With what?
With everything.</i>

156
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,646
Why are we assuming he's lying
and she's telling the truth?

157
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,451
Because she's a successful,
happily married consultant,

158
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:12,855
and he's a crazy,
drunk weirdo

159
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,187
who we just tossed
out of the hospital.

160
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:15,451
And she's hot.

161
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:17,086
<i>Maybe she picked him
because he's vulnerable.</i>

162
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,595
There's something off
about her, I can feel it.

163
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,893
If you had
any evidence...

164
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,265
Why didn't she tell us a
co-worker puked on her shoes

165
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,428
right before
she collapsed?

166
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,631
Because it's medically irrelevant.
He was drunk, she was sick.

167
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,798
<i>You don't think
it's suspicious</i>

168
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:29,136
<i>she didn't mention
it to her husband?</i>

169
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,371
Yeah, Foreman, why did
you break up with Thirteen?

170
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,176
Oh, no, wait, the non-subtextual
thing she was saying, why that?

171
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,443
This is about the case,

172
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,577
not some imaginary issue that
you think Foreman and I have.

173
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,315
Great. Start her
on beta blockers.

174
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,518
You'll do it?

175
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,427
I don't think
he was talking to me.

176
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,557
Well, I am.

177
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,499
I'm the only one who
thinks you're wrong.

178
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,732
Maybe that's why
I'm asking you to do it.

179
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,284
Greg? Lorenzo Wibberly.

180
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,723
Dr. Wilson said you'd
be here. How you been?

181
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,130
Check and mate.

182
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:35,701
Look,

183
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:39,707
I'm sorry this is
awkward or whatever.

184
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,905
I just thought it was nice
of you to write that letter,

185
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:45,542
and I wanted to tell you that
you don't have to feel bad.

186
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:47,547
Thanks.

187
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,985
So, where you
working these days?

188
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:55,721
You got your own practice
or you at a hospital?

189
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,959
I thought you knew. Dani's,
the organic supermarket chain.

190
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,966
As an in-house doctor?

191
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,231
I actually never
got licensed.

192
00:10:06,305 --> 00:10:07,966
I didn't graduate
med school.

193
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,406
I planned on going back,
and then my father got sick

194
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,934
and I had to take care of
him, and I had some bad luck.

195
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,447
Why didn't you graduate?

196
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:17,573
I was one credit short.

197
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:21,108
And I was sort of already
on academic probation, so...

198
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,288
Which credit?

199
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:25,585
I got a...

200
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:32,363
He failed me on that paper you
switched. I thought you knew.

201
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,263
So I'm guessing you're the
CEO of this supermarket chain.

202
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,631
I bag groceries.

203
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:43,940
Life works out
weird sometimes.

204
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,639
We were going to do it in Santa
Barbara because of his parents,

205
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:53,241
<i>but then I found this beautiful
hotel in Montauk and...</i>

206
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,213
You're testing her
for a brain tumor?

207
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,154
That's what I told her.
You can chastise me

208
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,658
after you look
at the monitor.

209
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,886
Look what's lighting up.

210
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,327
Lateral frontal cortex,
Broca's area. So what?

211
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,625
I told her
it was customary

212
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,893
to talk during MRIs,
to relax.

213
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,869
I spent the last 30 minutes asking her
about everything in life that she loves,

214
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,236
then hates, then feels
any emotion about at all.

215
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,138
There's nothing in the
paralimbic system, amygdala.

216
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,143
Because she's using the
language part of her brain

217
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,678
and bypassing
the emotional.

218
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,374
She can understand
love and pain and empathy,

219
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,314
but she can't
feel them at all.

220
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,050
She's a psychopath.

221
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,859
Why do you want to
meet her so badly?

222
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,955
Psychopaths always
fascinate me.

223
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,863
I think it's their
cultural literacy

224
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:45,165
and strong family values.
Or is that Jews?

225
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,205
We're not gonna be able to
get an honest read on her

226
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,241
unless we figure out a way to
get the husband out of there.

227
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,538
Hmm. I got an idea.

228
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,102
Can you get out of here?

229
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,146
Thanks.

230
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,386
It was the "thanks"
that did it.

231
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:08,352
Hi, I'm Dr. House. How long
have you been a psychopath?

232
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,021
Are you kidding?
He's not.

233
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:15,693
Are you saying I'm like
Ted Bundy or something?

234
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,736
Psychopathy can
get a bad rap.

235
00:12:17,803 --> 00:12:19,703
Doesn't necessarily
mean you're violent.

236
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,501
Just that you're completely
without conscience,

237
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,905
you lack
any normal emotion,

238
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,465
you manipulate
everyone around you,

239
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,341
you're promiscuous,
you lie pathologically.

240
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,540
Any of this
ringing bells?

241
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,378
Is that why you were asking
me all those weird questions?

242
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,884
Yeah. Well, you have
Darwin to thank for that.

243
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,887
She got the creeps
around you.

244
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:39,083
Which, oddly, is an actual medical
phenomenon around psychopaths,

245
00:12:39,158 --> 00:12:41,092
probably an evolved
response to predators.

246
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,324
I'm sorry. You're really freaking
me out. I have no idea what...

247
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:48,093
Relax. We have a duty
of confidentiality.

248
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,158
And you have an
undiagnosed heart problem

249
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,863
that could kill you
at any moment.

250
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,337
We believe that
your mental abnormality

251
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:55,896
is related to
your physical one.

252
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:58,671
So if you want to
keep on "predating"...

253
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,912
What do you want
to know?

254
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,623
Your co-worker's story
was true. You poisoned him.

255
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:24,226
No. I gave him a little
Valium and an emetic.

256
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,566
You sure you understand
what the word "no" means?

257
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,106
I've had them both before,
why can't he?

258
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,505
So you were just
helping him out?

259
00:13:29,575 --> 00:13:33,341
I assume he was cool with the
whole seducing and firing part, too.

260
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,243
Russ knew what
he was getting into.

261
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,373
He got sex every
Thursday night,

262
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,474
and I got to take credit
for his best ideas.

263
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,486
And what are you getting
out of your marriage?

264
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,351
Same thing you get
out of your job.

265
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:47,859
Bill has a trust fund, and I have
a prenup his parents made me sign.

266
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:51,492
Told you he was rich.
She's not that weird.

267
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,532
I'm not so different
than anybody else.

268
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:58,093
Everyone I've ever known, my family,
my classmates, the people I work with,

269
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,660
they're all out
for themselves.

270
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,797
Difference is,
I can admit it to myself.

271
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:03,398
She kind of reminds me
of someone I know.

272
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:04,908
Tell me about it.

273
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:08,242
Some of my co-workers will insult
people right to their faces.

274
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,646
How long have
you been this way?

275
00:14:12,718 --> 00:14:14,242
Just how I am.

276
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,987
Are you gonna cure
my heart problems now?

277
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:23,252
So, psychopathy plus
cardiac arrhythmia. Go.

278
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,921
I thought you were bluffing
to get information.

279
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:26,692
You really think
they're connected?

280
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:28,460
Two rare conditions
in one patient,

281
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,024
it's a fair
assumption they are.

282
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,967
Psychopathy is
generally just genetic,

283
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,197
nothing you can
do about it.

284
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,866
Something that hits 30 years after
birth isn't going to be connected.

285
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:38,102
There are diseases that
could lie dormant that long,

286
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,735
hit her heart,
warp her brain.

287
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,439
Maybe a handful
of diseases.

288
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,538
It'll be super awesome
when we find it.

289
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:47,416
Tertiary syphilis can cause
pseudopsychopathic syndrome and cardiomyopathy.

290
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:49,386
Fits best.
Start her on penicillin,

291
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,479
rule out Wilson's
and Hashimoto's.

292
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,751
There's your handful.
Wasn't so hard, was it?

293
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,863
You gotta do something
about Thirteen.

294
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:07,633
She flouted both
my authority and yours.

295
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:10,106
Yes. And she got it right
and you got it wrong.

296
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:11,870
Which just aggravates
the problem.

297
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,107
She'll do it again. Next time,
it won't work out so well.

298
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,514
You got to punish her.

299
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,211
You're her boss,

300
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:22,880
in some vague, never to
be usefully defined way.

301
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,149
You punish her.

302
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,248
I'm also her ex,
which, as you know,

303
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,986
makes it
a little complicated.

304
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,789
The fact that
you also fired her

305
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,092
takes it from a little
complicated to a little moronic.

306
00:15:32,164 --> 00:15:33,188
It was the only way I...

307
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,926
It wasn't because you
were too in love with her,

308
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,161
it was because you were too
in love with your career.

309
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:40,228
We're almost at my floor, so I'll
summarize. Your problem, not mine.

310
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,603
You cut up my only
copy of that photo.

311
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,081
That rare daguerreotype?

312
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,742
You can charge me
for the effort it takes

313
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:54,376
to search your hard drive
for a new copy.

314
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,287
Not the one of me and
Lucas, the one from Ecuador.

315
00:15:58,357 --> 00:16:01,849
Right, I'd forgotten about your
deep emotional attachment to lemurs.

316
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:03,326
To my dad.

317
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,524
You got his tail.

318
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:10,000
He was holding the camera. That was
the last trip we ever took together.

319
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,503
And I don't have
a digital copy.

320
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,666
Well, I could stand here
all day apologizing,

321
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:22,111
but I'd rather expiate my
sins with good, clean work.

322
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:25,616
You ignoring my texts?

323
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,382
The crazy ones you sent, trying
to get me to make you feel better

324
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,255
about destroying your classmate's
life? No, I never got those.

325
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:46,333
Wibberly's got
some agenda.

326
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,498
Probably trying to guilt me
into getting him a better job.

327
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,667
How pissed was he?
Not at all.

328
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,439
That's how I know
he's got an agenda.

329
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,413
If you feel guilty, you
should do something to help.

330
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,321
You are responsible.

331
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:14,689
Thanks.

332
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,133
What?
All I'm responsible for

333
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,042
is the foreseeable consequences
of switching papers.

334
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:30,707
A bad grade or a sleepless
night. Worst case, a retest.

335
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,717
There was no way to know
that one seminar paper

336
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,844
was gonna destroy
this idiot's life.

337
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,512
If there's any karma
in all this,

338
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:38,920
he's probably happier
than you are.

339
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,123
Good point. If he is
happier, there's no harm done.

340
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,458
I'll go find out.

341
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,863
That is absolutely
not what I said.

342
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:50,424
Always with the modesty,
this one.

343
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,626
You want
something to eat?

344
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:21,859
I'm cool.

345
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,035
How's work?

346
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,700
You happy with it?

347
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,602
You know, it's a job.

348
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,905
I don't need to take any
work home with me at least.

349
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,747
Free time. Wouldn't have any
of that if you were a doctor.

350
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,718
Yeah. True.

351
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:46,154
You like chili?
I could reheat some.

352
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,956
Is that your yard?
That's nice.

353
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:56,457
Yeah. That sugar maple,
100, 150 years old.

354
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,827
The most beautiful
leaves in the fall.

355
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,134
Sit underneath
on the bench,

356
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,208
it's like paradise.

357
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,335
I don't have a yard,
myself.

358
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:09,407
You got
a good thing going.

359
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,846
I know.

360
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:13,179
So, what are
the boxes for?

361
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:18,451
I'm moving.

362
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,650
From paradise?

363
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,192
Well, with my dad's
medical bills,

364
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,625
and me being one
of those idiots

365
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:25,458
that got an adjustable
mortgage, so...

366
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,431
You're losing your home.

367
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,828
Hey, could be worse, right?

368
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,764
How?

369
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:37,306
Even if the tests are positive,
you don't have to worry.

370
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,571
You're testing for syphilis,
not a cold.

371
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,703
Honey...

372
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,610
At this stage, it's
probably not communicable.

373
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,012
You think I'm worried
about myself?

374
00:19:44,082 --> 00:19:45,379
I just want my wife
to get better.

375
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,917
She might have
caught it at birth,

376
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,885
so it doesn't prove
she was cheating.

377
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:50,046
If you were worried
about that.

378
00:19:50,122 --> 00:19:51,180
Of course not.

379
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,382
How many weeks
am I gonna have to...

380
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,549
You okay?

381
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:56,093
Why is she coughing?
I don't know.

382
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,924
You want some water?

383
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,258
Are you threatened by me?

384
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:07,928
Not at all.

385
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,268
Well, you should be.

386
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,672
You let him know
what I told you,

387
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,403
I will not only have
your license pulled,

388
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,310
I will sue you for everything
I lose in the divorce.

389
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,974
So the fun you get out of making
those snotty little comments,

390
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,018
is it worth $90 million?

391
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,280
Oh, wait.
Will you hold that look?

392
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,187
I'm really bad at showing
emotions. How's this?

393
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,117
Thanks, baby.

394
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,589
Can I have your arm,
please?

395
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,567
My arm! You broke it!

396
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,143
I don't know what
happened. Neither do I.

397
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,580
But I know what
happened after.

398
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,086
She called Cuddy and demanded
I kick you off the case.

399
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,585
I backed you up
because I trust you,

400
00:20:57,656 --> 00:20:59,988
but you're gonna have to
earn that trust now.

401
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,491
Thanks.

402
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,221
Actually,
he backed you up

403
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,264
because of the new BUN
creatinine numbers.

404
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,390
Brittle bones were
from kidney failure.

405
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,129
There is that.
So heart and kidneys.

406
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,261
And brain.

407
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,668
Nope. The psychopathy
is not a symptom.

408
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,797
It was yesterday.

409
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:17,103
In the meantime, kidney
failure ruled out syphilis,

410
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:19,143
and testing ruled out the
other ideas that would have fit.

411
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,338
Protein levels,
kidneys, arrhythmia.

412
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,405
Could be paraneoplastic.
I'd say lymphoma.

413
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,677
Get her to radiotherapy.

414
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,345
We can't start radiation without
immunoassays in her urine.

415
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,287
Great. So, you cast a spell
and magically fix her kidneys,

416
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:32,482
she can give us
some urine to test.

417
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,956
We have some left
from admission.

418
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:35,584
Not enough for a
completely accurate reading.

419
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,390
Then how about
partially accurate?

420
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,363
Those of you who haven't
slept together, you can go.

421
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,525
Everyone else,
stay behind.

422
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,636
Oh, sorry,
that was our secret. Right.

423
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:59,979
Go have sex.
No, thanks.

424
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:02,919
Fine, I'll cover the Viagra and the
lubricants, just get me a receipt.

425
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,649
We have zero feelings for each other.

426
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:05,985
That's too bad,

427
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,424
'cause things worked
much better when you did.

428
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,551
Would it help
if I slept with her?

429
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:10,856
We were getting
to a diagnosis.

430
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,920
No, we were already
at the diagnosis.

431
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:14,363
You were creating
a fake argument

432
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:15,764
about an irrelevant
treatment issue

433
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,495
'cause you can't stand
to be around each other.

434
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,333
So have sex, fight,
or quit, I don't care.

435
00:22:20,405 --> 00:22:22,805
Whatever you're
doing now isn't working.

436
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:33,644
You okay?

437
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,845
Yeah.

438
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:41,158
Look, I get that you gotta
act fast, but radiation?

439
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,853
You definitely ruled out
everything else?

440
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,021
I'm sorry, but...

441
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,326
We could still check
for environmental toxins.

442
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,699
Where does she spend
most of her time?

443
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,795
Mostly at work, at home.

444
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,170
Hobbies? Recurring
activities outside the home?

445
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,936
No. Not really.

446
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:01,172
She took a landscaping
class at the Y.

447
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,508
When did it meet?

448
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:04,947
Every Thursday night
this summer.

449
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,679
You dig in soil, you can
be exposed to pesticides,

450
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,450
heavy metals,
lots of bad things.

451
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,650
Can you find out all about
her landscaping class,

452
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,556
where it was,
details like that?

453
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,424
Yeah. I'll do it now.

454
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:29,672
<i>So when you watch Star Wars,
which side do you root for?</i>

455
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:35,312
<i>Dr. House,
what are you doing?</i>

456
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,644
<i>Just checking in
on your radiotherapy.</i>

457
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:42,252
From what I hear,
you never visit patients.

458
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:45,622
And now you've come
to chat with me twice.

459
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,750
<i>I wanna know how you like
being a management consultant.</i>

460
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:50,624
<i>I'm thinking of
getting into it.</i>

461
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:52,788
<i>That or psychopathy, maybe.</i>

462
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,592
Which pays better?

463
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:57,830
<i>I think you're already
into one of them.</i>

464
00:23:57,903 --> 00:23:59,700
Dr. Hadley made
a joke yesterday.

465
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,671
She said
I sound like you.

466
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:05,969
<i>You sure you understand
what "joke" means?</i>

467
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,274
So you're not just
out for yourself?

468
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:11,645
For example, you would never
interrupt a sick woman's treatment

469
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,617
just because of some
personal obsession?

470
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:17,385
Of course
I'm self-interested.

471
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,617
We all are,
we're born that way.

472
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:23,122
The rest of us are
born with consciences.

473
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:26,528
Which is something you
just sound ecstatic about.

474
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,229
I'm not saying it's logical,
I'm just saying it's human.

475
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,761
So if you know your conscience
is just an animal instinct,

476
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,001
you don't need
to follow it.

477
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,835
I think you realize that.

478
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,504
That's why
you're talking to me.

479
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,999
You lied about
your landscaping class.

480
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,267
Dr. Hadley thought the soils
might be poisoned.

481
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,432
You told him that?

482
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,497
I just thought...

483
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:13,009
Russ said you were
having an affair.

484
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,514
Was that your cover? Every
Thursday night, you'd...

485
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:20,307
I'm so sorry.

486
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,909
Oh, God.

487
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,455
It's not
what you think.

488
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,320
Do you remember
that telecom case

489
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,120
I said that we didn't
get last year?

490
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,525
In fact, we did.
And I was swamped.

491
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,825
Every Friday morning, we had
a conference call with London,

492
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,263
so the night before
I would...

493
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:37,995
That's your excuse? You expect me to
believe that you were at the office?

494
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:40,162
What's the biggest argument
we've ever had?

495
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,763
You said I spend too
much time away from home,

496
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,570
that I don't need a job, that
you would take care of me.

497
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:47,544
Yeah. That's all true.

498
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,409
You yelled at me.

499
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:53,144
You made me feel like you
didn't value anything that I did.

500
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,412
I need this job

501
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:57,319
to feel like I'm accomplishing
something on my own.

502
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,683
That's why I lied to you.

503
00:25:59,758 --> 00:26:01,623
If I call your office
tomorrow and I check...

504
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,786
Call my office,
call my secretary,

505
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,023
call my clients,
interrupt their dinner,

506
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:07,257
wake them up,
I don't care.

507
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:09,391
I just want you
to know the truth.

508
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,367
You know I love you.

509
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:17,172
Come here.

510
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:19,504
Please.

511
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,817
It's okay.

512
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:39,621
Fire her.

513
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,360
What for? You seem to have lied
your way out of any trouble.

514
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,265
Until Bill checks up
on my cover,

515
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,361
and I have to create a whole
new one to cover that one up.

516
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,133
I've done it before,
but it's a pain,

517
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,401
and I would like Dr.
Hadley to share that pain.

518
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,840
She didn't reveal
any confidences,

519
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,400
and she had
a valid medical reason

520
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:54,911
to ask about your
landscaping class.

521
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,845
We can see what
a jury says about that.

522
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,746
And admit to your
husband the truth?

523
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,614
You're not going
to sue us.

524
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,245
We will remove Dr. Hadley
from all patient contact.

525
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,310
What?

526
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,722
But it's for Dr. Hadley's
benefit, not yours.

527
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,784
We have no obligation
to inflict you on her.

528
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,090
Fine.

529
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,759
But just so you know, this
is not for your benefit.

530
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,099
Dr. Cuddy is furious that
you put her hospital at risk.

531
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,330
She just knows
it's a bad idea

532
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:22,771
to admit it
in front of me.

533
00:27:23,408 --> 00:27:24,898
Think what you want.

534
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,705
By the way,
your orderly's outside.

535
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:29,440
But I'd wait about
another 10 minutes

536
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:30,742
if you really want
your husband to think

537
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,409
you're having
radiation treatments.

538
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,319
Dr. Hadley?

539
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,382
Are you, by chance,
gonna cry?

540
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,989
'Cause that's the one
I just can't do.

541
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,010
Hello?
This is Dr. Hadley.

542
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,446
What?

543
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,256
You called
the medical board?

544
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,385
What is she talking about?

545
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:19,089
"Accusations
of sexual harassment. "

546
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,358
You don't think
I know it's you?

547
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,490
Thirteen, come on.

548
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:24,262
You already got me fired from
the case, what else do you want?

549
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,395
Dr. Hadley,
get out here now.

550
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,273
You're acting
like an idiot.

551
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,249
She's trying to make me
lose my license!

552
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,979
She'll fail, unless you're stupid enough

553
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,179
to go in there
and scream at her.

554
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:45,381
Sexual harassment accusations
are incredibly serious.

555
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,721
If she made them anonymously,
the case goes away.

556
00:28:47,792 --> 00:28:51,159
If she used her name, we all
back you up, it goes away.

557
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,696
You're completely
overreacting.

558
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:54,891
You'd be pissed off, too,
if you were me.

559
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:55,990
Or maybe not,
I don't know.

560
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,591
You're just about as
emotional as she is.

561
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,136
I'm doing you a favor.
I know.

562
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:03,265
And even when you try to do
something nice, you sound like a jerk.

563
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,908
I'm sorry.

564
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:08,976
For what?

565
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,143
For firing you.

566
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,045
Don't do that. That's
not what this is about.

567
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,383
Then I'll apologize anyway.

568
00:29:16,454 --> 00:29:18,752
I did it for me,
not for you.

569
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,089
I realized that
right after I fired you,

570
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,896
but I couldn't admit it.

571
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:31,558
I screwed everything up. I hope
that we can still work together.

572
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:39,841
Something's wrong
with her liver.

573
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:42,038
Blood flow's backing up,
spilling into her esophagus.

574
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,910
From the cancer?
This isn't lymphoma.

575
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,006
We don't know
what it is.

576
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,141
We can wrap bands
around the veins,

577
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:47,844
but the bleed is so bad,
that might not work.

578
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,546
We want to try something
called the TIPS,

579
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,987
a shunt that makes the
blood bypass the liver.

580
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,148
That'll save her?

581
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,816
It should help preserve
her liver and heart.

582
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:57,589
But the liver cleans out
toxins, so bypass it too long,

583
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:59,152
she'll get brain damage,
eventually die.

584
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,460
But that's still probably less
dangerous than bleeding out now.

585
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:02,864
Probably?

586
00:30:04,402 --> 00:30:06,666
Valerie usually
makes the decisions...

587
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,103
You gotta step up now.

588
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:12,734
Was she cheating on me?
I can't discuss...

589
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,076
Just tell me she wasn't
lying. Just tell me that.

590
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,483
I'm supposed to
make this decision?

591
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,683
I don't even know
who she is any more.

592
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:29,386
Either way, you gotta do it right now.

593
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,460
Do whatever
you think is right.

594
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,743
I'd give her a day,
two days at the most.

595
00:30:48,813 --> 00:30:52,374
Great. You be the clock,
everyone else will be the doctors.

596
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,747
Heart, kidneys,
now liver.

597
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:54,842
Amyloidosis.

598
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:58,082
No speckles on the MRI.
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?

599
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,282
Too much kidney failure.

600
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,621
Primary hepatic fibrosis.

601
00:31:03,394 --> 00:31:06,329
It's our best guess.
Start her on steroids.

602
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,490
Even if we're right, the
liver's probably too scarred.

603
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:09,590
We got to list her
for a new one.

604
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,032
With an unconfirmed
diagnosis?

605
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:12,569
Not gonna happen. How
about a family member?

606
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,104
I don't think the husband's
the right blood type.

607
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:16,470
Even if he was, he's not
going to give his liver now.

608
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:17,735
He left her, I assume?

609
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:18,969
Not yet.

610
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,236
He says he won't abandon
her while she's sick.

611
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:24,110
She have any other
family members?

612
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,013
No one's going to risk
their life to save hers.

613
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:28,712
Man, one false accusation
from a psychopath,

614
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,754
and you turn out
to be a real bummer.

615
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,985
I'm gonna go see if
Wilson has any liver left.

616
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:47,965
What are you doing?

617
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:51,566
Paying Wibberly's mortgage
for a few months.

618
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,476
Congratulations on another
successful round of hectoring.

619
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:57,514
Wait a minute. Is that
actually a check for him?

620
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,983
No, it's a giant novelty
item for winning the lottery,

621
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:03,179
you're just standing
really far away.

622
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:07,020
Of all the people to go the
extra mile for, why this guy?

623
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,754
I don't know, he just kind of
smells good and makes me laugh.

624
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:14,025
Why not Cuddy? You never apologized
after you defaced her photo.

625
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,794
Maybe because I recognize that
sending someone to the poorhouse

626
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,393
is a little more serious
than editing a snapshot.

627
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,132
No, it's because Cuddy
actually means something to you,

628
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,333
which makes it much harder to apologize.

629
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,440
If it'll make you shut up, I will
tell her I'm sorry about the photo.

630
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,880
Forget the photo. House,
she was in love with you.

631
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,043
And all she got
in return was abuse.

632
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,586
For years, you toyed
with her emotions.

633
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,814
She wasn't
in love with me.

634
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:41,086
The fact that you still can't
admit it just proves my point.

635
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,957
What do you want? Helping
the guy was your idea.

636
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,087
No, help the guy,
whatever.

637
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,930
I'm just pointing out that it's
much easier to soothe your guilt

638
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,730
by throwing money
at a stranger

639
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,466
than by making amends to a
person you actually care about.

640
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,906
You had me
at "much easier. "

641
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,638
I'm going to pretend
to go to work now.

642
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,877
Ping.

643
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,934
Sarah?

644
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,233
I'm Dr. Hadley.
I'm sorry to bother you,

645
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,005
but I was told that
you're Valerie's sister.

646
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,102
Mmm.

647
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,012
I was just surprised
you came to visit.

648
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,047
So is the rest
of my family.

649
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,884
I was even more surprised
you got tested as a donor.

650
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,048
Wrong blood type.

651
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:50,026
But why? I mean,
you know what she's like.

652
00:33:50,094 --> 00:33:51,994
She's not that bad.

653
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:53,587
Yes. She is.

654
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,026
Our dad was a mean drunk.

655
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,572
I was the older sister.

656
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,599
I was supposed to stand up for
her, not the other way around.

657
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,805
She protected you
when you were kids?

658
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,373
Yeah. And then all of a
sudden, all of his crap

659
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:18,654
and all his abuse,
it just changed her.

660
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:20,852
It made her cold.

661
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,618
When?

662
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:30,726
We were wrong. Psychopathy is a symptom.

663
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,032
I spoke to her sister. She
wasn't always like this.

664
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:36,039
She changed, and right
around adolescence.

665
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:44,446
So, liver, heart, brain lie
dormant, and it starts at puberty.

666
00:34:51,155 --> 00:34:56,115
The raw food diet made it go
fulminant. Nuts are high in copper.

667
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:58,657
It's Wilson's disease.

668
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:01,664
We ruled that out.
No Keyser-Fleischer rings.

669
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:07,260
There is one other sign. I know
there are lipstick lesbians.

670
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,796
Are there
nail-polish-remover bisexuals?

671
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,870
She's not
supposed to be here.

672
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,141
As a doctor.

673
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:20,707
You didn't say anything about her
capacity as a beautician's assistant.

674
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:37,500
Her fingernail's blue?

675
00:35:37,568 --> 00:35:38,728
Yep.

676
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,794
Start her on chelation.

677
00:35:41,672 --> 00:35:42,969
What just happened?

678
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,268
You're gonna get better.

679
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:47,243
Your body has an inability
to process copper.

680
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,905
It caused all
of your problems.

681
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,608
Even what's wrong
with your brain.

682
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,048
That's going
to change, too?

683
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:57,315
It's probably rewired her
neurons permanently by now.

684
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,151
But it's possible?

685
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,985
Maybe.

686
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,822
I have to go get
the chelation equipment.

687
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,796
Bill, I need you
to sign some forms.

688
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,436
You don't see
what she's doing?

689
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,101
She's laying the groundwork
to get her treatment,

690
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,907
wake up a completely
different person

691
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:25,938
so that you and all of
your money stay with her.

692
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,882
It's a lie.

693
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:29,180
You said
there was a chance.

694
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,051
Okay, there's
a teeny chance.

695
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:36,116
But even if it cures her, it's
not going to make her love you.

696
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:41,427
I was happy before.

697
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:47,497
I know, and I'm sorry,
but it wasn't real.

698
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,235
It felt real.

699
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,237
I don't know...

700
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,976
Maybe that can be enough.

701
00:37:12,296 --> 00:37:14,662
You're really
doing this for me?

702
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:18,234
Tax shelter.

703
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,005
I'll take some
of that chili now.

704
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,745
I can't accept this.

705
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,611
Fine, forget the chili.

706
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:34,041
Bye, Wibberly.

707
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,919
I got an A plus
with your paper.

708
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:44,158
I was an orthopedic surgeon
for 10 years at New York Mercy.

709
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:45,991
I had a gambling problem.

710
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,032
I tried to cover it by
overbilling some Medicare patients.

711
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,194
Lost my license.
That's why I'm here.

712
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,033
Not because of you.

713
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,164
Why are you
telling me this now?

714
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:00,438
Because I thought
you'd be the same bastard

715
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,207
you were
in med school, but...

716
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,383
Keep it.

717
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,553
No. I can get
another place.

718
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:21,223
Just take it.
I screwed you over.

719
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,732
You got me an A plus.

720
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,233
Take it.
No.

721
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,999
Do I have to shove it down your
throat? Take the damn check!

722
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:55,761
Your vitals are up.

723
00:38:58,803 --> 00:38:59,861
Treatment's working.

724
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:01,461
I'm not sure we can
fix your liver,

725
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,804
but we can definitely
list you for a new one.

726
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,668
When you're better, we're
gonna take a long vacation.

727
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,577
You want to go to Vietnam,
one of the beaches?

728
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:14,584
We're gonna get a hut, just you
and me, nothing to worry about.

729
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,317
You're pathetic.

730
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:24,986
What?

731
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:29,658
I mean, when you had a
suspicion, fine, but you know now.

732
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,702
How can you
be this pitiful?

733
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,504
You don't mean this.
You're sick.

734
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:36,801
I'm not sick.

735
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,135
I almost died,
and I still might.

736
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,270
And who knows, maybe
it's focusing my mind

737
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,780
because the idea of spending
the rest of my life with you...

738
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,214
Valerie...

739
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,468
Why'd you do that?

740
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:06,833
Because he's pathetic.

741
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,167
He hasn't changed.

742
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:19,042
But you have. The treatment
actually worked on your brain.

743
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,276
If you were still
a psychopath,

744
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:22,114
you would have just
kept draining him dry.

745
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,210
What do you want?

746
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:25,278
You're feeling something.

747
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,484
What is it?
What do you feel?

748
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:34,954
I don't know.

749
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,166
It hurts.

750
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,408
It will.

751
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,659
Heard about the diagnosis.
Nice job.

752
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:11,929
Thanks. Why are you
here so late?

753
00:41:12,002 --> 00:41:16,496
Discharge summary. Taub's
handwriting isn't helping much.

754
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,098
Apparently on the
third day of admission,

755
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,008
the patient underwent
"rabbit thumping. "

756
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,308
"Radiotherapy. "

757
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,811
Ah.

758
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,556
"Third day after admission,

759
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,319
"patient underwent
radiotherapy

760
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:39,055
"including external
beam radiation

761
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,763
"to treat
B- cell lymphomas.

762
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,329
"First treatment was

763
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:54,200
"full-mantle therapy... "
