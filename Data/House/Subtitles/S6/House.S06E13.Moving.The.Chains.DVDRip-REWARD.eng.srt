1
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,486
Good explosion! Drive
it, drive it, drive it!

2
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:26,650
You watching 77?

3
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:27,818
I'm watching everybody.

4
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,761
You don't need to watch
everybody, you need to watch 77.

5
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,693
You his agent?

6
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,199
Just an objective mom.

7
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,426
His explosion
is impressive.

8
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,562
It's not just burst,
he can pull, too.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,502
You know, the only reason
he went to a double A school,

10
00:00:40,573 --> 00:00:43,701
he was a bit of a late
bloomer, but he's a big man now.

11
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,267
You should be his agent.

12
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,869
Nice pancake,
Seven Seven.

13
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,738
You're moving up
those draft boards.

14
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:50,874
Thank you, sir.

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,884
01, 01, ready?
Break!

16
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,349
Set!

17
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,883
Blue 90. Hike.

18
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,420
Good job!
Second level, nice!

19
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,964
Get off my quarterback!

20
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:16,806
Play's over!
The play is over!

21
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,420
Save the aggression for
between the whistles!

22
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,511
Daryl!

23
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,953
All right,
back to work!

24
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,754
Daryl!

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,955
Daryl, stop!

26
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:38,881
What are you doing?

27
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,859
Canoeing, but I seem
to be taking on water.

28
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,623
This is not okay.
Use your own bathroom.

29
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,029
No canoe in my bathroom.

30
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,960
My leg hurts, soaking
makes it feel better.

31
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:54,233
You were the one who
had to have this condo.

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,035
Maybe next time you
should consider amenities,

33
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,839
like two full baths, instead of
just the joy of outbidding Cuddy.

34
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,905
The guy who signs the loan
gets to pick the bedrooms.

35
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,745
Stay out of mine.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,611
Well, then you
owe me 35 bucks

37
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:10,019
for the grab rail
I installed.

38
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,022
Hit the kill screen,
boss is here.

39
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,533
It's not porn,
it's our new patient.

40
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,899
Bummer.

41
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,528
Twenty-two-year-old male,
6'7", 310 pounds.

42
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:29,199
Clearly has
brain involvement.

43
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,335
The guy has no recollection
of this entire incident.

44
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:34,312
Football player.

45
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,780
Those are the ones that get
hit in the head a lot, right?

46
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,975
ER CTed him.

47
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,383
No concussion, no stroke,
no cortical degeneration.

48
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,684
And he had a full psych
evaluation. He's not crazy.

49
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,223
So it's roid rage.

50
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,724
You don't think they grow
them that big naturally?

51
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:48,784
ER also tested for steroids,
he's clean.

52
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,363
Only proving that our guy got
his hands on the good stuff.

53
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,956
The negative test at least
means steroids is less likely.

54
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,227
We should discuss
other possibilities.

55
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,393
Why?

56
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,869
He injects his sore ankles
with lidocaine every game,

57
00:03:58,938 --> 00:04:00,565
you think he's above
injecting steroids?

58
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,040
Repeated head trauma could
damage the base of the brain,

59
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,135
leading to a pituitary
adenoma, which leaks GnRH.

60
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,578
Pituitary damage wouldn't
be visible on a CT scan.

61
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:11,139
Could cause the excess hormones
that could cause the rage

62
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,549
and would elude
the ER's steroid test.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,454
Fine. Bilateral venous sampling
to find the elevated GnRH,

64
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,991
MRI to find
the pituitary damage.

65
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,254
Unless, of course, there
is no pituitary damage,

66
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:25,957
in which case, our guy got
his hands on the good stuff.

67
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,735
Foreman. Let the peasants
handle the peasantry.

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,473
Your brother needs to get
picked up this afternoon.

69
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:38,837
From prison.

70
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,974
Your older brother, in case
your confusion is related...

71
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,447
How do you know
about that?

72
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:45,848
He left a message.

73
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,648
He said he couldn't get you
on your cell or at home.

74
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,746
I get it, you're busy,
you'll pick him up

75
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,450
the next time he
comes out of prison.

76
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,992
Is that all?

77
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:59,129
You're officially unbusy.
Family is family.

78
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,460
Take the rest of the day,
go see your brother.

79
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,332
I have work to do.

80
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,705
Do you feel any pain
that's deep and persistent?

81
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,211
Not just muscles
or joints.

82
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,372
Everything hurts all the
time. That's football.

83
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,506
It might not be
just football.

84
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,608
We're going to test for
damage to your pituitary.

85
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,416
If there is, it could
create excess hormones,

86
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,648
which could be
causing your pain.

87
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,486
It would also explain
your rage attack.

88
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:26,889
And if my pituitary
is damaged,

89
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,221
how long would
it take to treat?

90
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,522
I don't want to get
ahead of ourselves

91
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:30,994
and start promising deadlines.

92
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,030
I'm sorry, Doctor,

93
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,191
but he's playing
in front of pro scouts,

94
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,293
coaches and GMs
this Saturday.

95
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,737
This is the job interview
for the rest of his life.

96
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,398
If we do find
something wrong,

97
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,135
we can go in
through the nose

98
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,838
and repair the damage,
nothing too invasive.

99
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,881
You'll need a couple
of days of recovery,

100
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,916
and then we can have
you back by game time.

101
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,516
Thank you, Doctor.

102
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,989
There's nothing wrong
with your eyes.

103
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:03,862
Well, then, your gizmo's
broken. I'm seeing spots.

104
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,765
Or you enlisted, you got the cool
haircut and the awesome pants,

105
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,266
then you realized
that your plane ticket

106
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:11,735
to the Middle East
was coach,

107
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:13,772
and you decided to
rethink your promise.

108
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,173
No. I've already
been there.

109
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,002
Three deployments. Now
they want me to go again.

110
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,707
But my wife's pregnant.

111
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,841
So our Homeland
should be unsafe

112
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,942
because your Private
was unsafe?

113
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:30,751
Look, my wife and I
planned this perfect.

114
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:32,882
My enlistment was supposed
to be over last week,

115
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,291
so we got pregnant
six months ago.

116
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,386
Now they tell me
I'm getting stop-lossed.

117
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,521
Army speak for
they don't care

118
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,089
about the fact that I've
finished my contract.

119
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,293
I don't care about the
fact that they don't care.

120
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,863
Hey, come on, I waited an extra
hour just to make sure I got you.

121
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,571
Why?

122
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,269
I saw you limping out there.

123
00:06:52,612 --> 00:06:53,806
Vietnam?

124
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,069
Viet...

125
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,776
How old do you
think I am?

126
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,510
I don't know.
Vietnam age?

127
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,315
Well, back in my day

128
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,180
the real dodgers had the
stones to run off to Canada

129
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,623
or shoot themselves
in the foot.

130
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,718
They didn't come to free clinics
whining for doctors' notes.

131
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,726
Go hug your wife, tell
her to get a babysitter,

132
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:16,633
and you'll be back in time to
video the kid's first steps.

133
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,395
Yeah, I don't need
to see the scan.

134
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:24,068
I can tell from your little puppy
dog eyes that his pituitary's fine.

135
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:26,168
Are you gonna say it,
or should I?

136
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,769
You were right
about the steroids.

137
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,178
You're a genius.

138
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,772
Next time,
with feeling.

139
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,545
Put the cheater on
a somatostatin analogue

140
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,676
to clear it out
of his system,

141
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:36,586
send him back to
his football game.

142
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,021
I've never done steroids.

143
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,994
Well, somehow your
GnRH got elevated.

144
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,620
This will help
get it back down.

145
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:46,756
Mom, I swear!

146
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,391
Who's gonna
draft you, Daryl?

147
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,867
You're stupid enough
to try that stuff,

148
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,834
especially the week you
know you're getting tested?

149
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,337
You guys must have
mixed up your labs

150
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,135
or got somebody
else's blood,

151
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,266
because I never...

152
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,902
Okay, what is that?

153
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,538
Tachycardia.
Lay back down, Daryl.

154
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,047
Why's my heart
beating like this?

155
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,516
It's not steroids.

156
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,782
I need some adenosine, and
get that crash cart over here.

157
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,824
House, next time...

158
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,556
Marcus.

159
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,327
Oh, right.
You two know each other.

160
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,834
What are you doing here?

161
00:08:24,904 --> 00:08:25,996
Interviewing.

162
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,263
Oh.

163
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,140
Who are we kidding? Interview's
over, you got the job.

164
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,375
What job?

165
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:34,708
My new assistant.

166
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,345
Part of his parole,
he needs a job.

167
00:08:37,416 --> 00:08:39,543
Just trying
to do my part.

168
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:41,817
You were wrong
about the steroids.

169
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,583
Patient had a paroxysmal tachycardia.

170
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,589
We cardioverted him
back to sinus rhythm.

171
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,989
We're going to get a EKG
and a sestamibi scan.

172
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,359
Marcus,
let's talk outside.

173
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,595
Family is family.

174
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,397
Hey, good to
see you, too.

175
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,571
Did you have
a hard stretch?

176
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:05,941
Not bad, I hardly got raped at all.

177
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,444
You can't work here.

178
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,109
But your boss
says I can.

179
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,376
I'm not playing.

180
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,351
Lighten up.
I mean, this could be fun.

181
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,386
I get to see your world. You
get me access to the pharmacy.

182
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:23,789
I am playing. Come
on, man. You look good.

183
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,360
I'd already know that, if you came
to visit every once in a while,

184
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:28,696
but whatever, I get it.
It's cool.

185
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,464
You don't wanna see me,
you don't wanna pick me up.

186
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,198
It's all justified.

187
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,634
I'll just have to
win you back over.

188
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:40,701
Let me explain something. This
man who's offering you the job?

189
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,008
He's not
a philanthropist.

190
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,275
He seems more
helpful than you.

191
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:46,078
He doesn't want
to help you,

192
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,245
he only wants to use you
to screw with me.

193
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:51,555
You know how you
can screw with him?

194
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:54,821
Act like your brother getting
a job doesn't screw with you.

195
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,829
Trust me, it'll be better for
both of us if you go back in there

196
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,489
and tell him you can't take the job.

197
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,559
I'm not a person who has the
luxury of turning down jobs.

198
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,070
Well, figure
something out

199
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,238
because you cannot
work here.

200
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,283
House!

201
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,486
Okay...

202
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:34,664
We spent all night, used
all the fancy machines.

203
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,530
Patient's heart
looks fine.

204
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,866
Well, if it was fine,
it wouldn't go aflutter

205
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,769
just because you
walked into the room.

206
00:10:40,873 --> 00:10:42,773
Light whip,
two extra shots.

207
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,104
Thank you, sir.

208
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:46,872
Judging by the look
on your face,

209
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,674
I assume you're upset
that big bro

210
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,114
didn't take your advice
and skip town.

211
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,481
You told him about
our conversation?

212
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,780
He bought me breakfast.

213
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:58,955
It was fun. Put lunch in
the books, just you and me.

214
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,952
Our patient
could have a PFO.

215
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:05,293
Well, naturally you jump
right to a urinary issue.

216
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:07,195
PFO's not urinary,
it's a heart issue.

217
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,200
It is? Oh.

218
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,293
Well, naturally you think
it's not a urinary issue

219
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,360
because you're
so embarrassed

220
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,997
about your own
past urinary issues,

221
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,972
you don't dare
broach the subject.

222
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,111
Oh, come on.

223
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,647
You spending the night
over at Bobby Samson's?

224
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,419
I did not wet the bed,
I spilled a drink.

225
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:34,048
We're not buying it, Eric.
We never bought it.

226
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,423
Why are you telling him
these things?

227
00:11:35,494 --> 00:11:39,089
What's the big deal?
It was 25 years ago.

228
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,598
Oxygenated and
de-oxygenated blood mix,

229
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,033
the rough flow causes a clot,
explains the heart and head.

230
00:11:44,103 --> 00:11:47,800
Like that power forward from
Loyola Marymount when he...

231
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,932
Hank Gathers? That's
not what happened to him.

232
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,909
Whoa,
let your brother speak.

233
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,309
What happened
to Hank Gathers?

234
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,537
Conference tournament.

235
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,139
Alley-oop dunk,
jams it home,

236
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,082
then he runs up
the court and splat.

237
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,279
He dropped dead of a heart
thing right there on the court.

238
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,117
I remember that.
On autopsy they found

239
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,215
he had a hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

240
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,159
Rage and tachycardia
are warning signs.

241
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,489
Seriously?

242
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,997
Because my brother remembers
a basketball game?

243
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,429
Hey, I don't care
where an idea comes from,

244
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,026
as long as it makes sense
and embarrasses someone.

245
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:21,966
Are you out
of your mind?

246
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,941
As a former
psychiatric patient,

247
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,636
I take offense at
that terminology.

248
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,975
All I did was
ban you from my tub.

249
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,843
Whatever happened
to proportional response?

250
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:31,974
Whatever happened
to coherent conversation?

251
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:37,317
That thing broke tiles, gashed
the walls, and pooped everywhere.

252
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,915
Expect a bill for repairs.
And payback.

253
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,157
What was that?

254
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,530
I have no idea.

255
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:53,095
Everybody else thinks hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy makes sense?

256
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,937
Good, stick the patient on a treadmill.

257
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,475
Stress his heart
until it stops.

258
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,103
You want to induce
cardiac arrest?

259
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,310
The only real treatment is for the
patient never to stress his heart again,

260
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,476
which means we have to tell him to
retire at the ripe old age of 21.

261
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:09,817
Stopping his heart speaks
louder than words. Go.

262
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,028
Maybe it's a good thing. He gave
your brother a job, responsibility.

263
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,065
I'm not arguing that
he shouldn't have a job,

264
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,862
I just don't want him
having one here.

265
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,960
I understand that House
did this to annoy you,

266
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,198
but why is
he succeeding?

267
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:33,068
You know what
my brother did

268
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,170
the last time
he got out of prison?

269
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:38,478
He stole money from my
parents to buy drugs.

270
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:42,645
He robbed a liquor store, then he
moved on to jacking luxury cars...

271
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,915
Last time.

272
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,251
Every time.

273
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,327
I've known my brother
for over 30 years.

274
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,056
You haven't even
known him a day.

275
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,098
I'm sorry.

276
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,596
The exterminator
charged 250

277
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,901
to get the opossum
out of there,

278
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,909
and the contractor estimates
1,500 to fix the bathroom.

279
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,879
And why are you
jerking Foreman around?

280
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:12,581
Because it's fun.

281
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,679
Maybe you should give
those bills to the guy

282
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,415
who left his own
bathroom window open.

283
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:20,583
Your motives always run
deeper than simple fun.

284
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,923
I want to learn more
about one of my employees

285
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,986
so that I can
manipulate him

286
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:29,056
and destroy him if and when I
choose. Information is power.

287
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,158
Not buying it.

288
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,225
Okay.

289
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:33,601
Why don't you tell me
my real evil plan?

290
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,435
I don't think
there is an evil plan.

291
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,670
You regret not having a
relationship with your own family,

292
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:41,268
and you don't want to see
Foreman go down that same path.

293
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:45,545
I think you're
actually being nice.

294
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,915
Oh, shut up.

295
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,449
You can't accuse me
of an opossum attack

296
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:53,491
and underhanded kindness
in the same visit.

297
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,650
Then I'll come back.

298
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,092
Treadmill test
was a bust.

299
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,662
The guy's in
unbelievable shape,

300
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,963
we couldn't get his
heart rate above 150.

301
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,833
Your boss is secretly
a very nice man.

302
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:10,772
I know.

303
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,042
If we can't
recreate the cardiac event,

304
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,843
we can't prove
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

305
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:23,216
Either we find
a bigger treadmill, or...

306
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,622
Did I miss the memo
about you being released?

307
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,722
I'm feeling fine.
I can't keep laying here

308
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,323
in this bed,
missing practices.

309
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:37,699
All excellent points.
Give me your arm.

310
00:15:37,803 --> 00:15:39,236
What's in the shot?

311
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,465
It's a vasodilator.

312
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,073
Since we can't exercise your
son's heart on the treadmill,

313
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,575
we're gonna have
to do it chemically.

314
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,214
What's wrong?

315
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,581
You're turning white.

316
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,244
What does that mean?

317
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:58,721
It means he doesn't need football
to get a good job anymore.

318
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,496
Raynaud's Phenomenon.

319
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:10,228
Vasospasms cut off the
blood supply to his fingers,

320
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:12,634
could be early onset
rheumatoid arthritis.

321
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,229
His rheumatoid
factor is negative.

322
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,773
Arterial plaque
throwing clots

323
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:17,866
would explain the fingers,
head, heart.

324
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,342
You really think
a guy with stenosis

325
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:21,675
could've aced
that treadmill test?

326
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,917
You're kidding me.
You got him a desk?

327
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,583
And a nameplate. Man's got to
have a place he can call his own.

328
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,952
What about
Takayasu's arteritis?

329
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,493
Lymphoma's a better fit.

330
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,687
We should remove
his spleen.

331
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,525
Bold move to skip
straight to surgery.

332
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,758
His big game's coming up,
we don't have time to biopsy,

333
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,835
wait for the pathology report,
and resect.

334
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,666
Right. We should remove his
spleen without confirmation

335
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,206
so he won't miss
the big game.

336
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,170
Hang an ethanol drip.

337
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:53,370
That won't treat for either
lymphoma or Takayasu's.

338
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,208
If it's lymphoma, the
ethanol will make him itchy,

339
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,770
and Foreman can
remove his spleen.

340
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,816
If it's Takayasu's,
he'll lose his radial pulse,

341
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,682
and Chase can
start him on steroids.

342
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:05,883
Marcus!

343
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,297
What are you
doing here?

344
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,931
My new assignment is to
shadow you into enemy territory

345
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,737
and document your every
word to the patient.

346
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,779
Just don't say
anything stupid.

347
00:17:27,846 --> 00:17:30,644
You're not an idiot.
Don't do this.

348
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,349
Come on, man.
I'm a new person now.

349
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,388
No more drugs,
no more lying.

350
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,116
And if I can't
get my own family

351
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,782
to give me an opportunity
to prove that,

352
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,416
then what's the point?

353
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:43,393
Mom and Dad
gave you a chance.

354
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,692
And a second.
And a third.

355
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,459
I'm not about to
give you a 54th.

356
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,981
Why isn't your minion
fetching your lunch?

357
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,988
He's busy spying on
his little brother.

358
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:14,983
What?

359
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,960
That's very demeaning.

360
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,523
You obviously have a theory as
to why demeaning is not demeaning.

361
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,034
You're escalating to prove I
was wrong about you being nice.

362
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,401
Which you would only do
if I was right.

363
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:29,304
Do you even listen
to yourself?

364
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,036
Twenty-three-year-old just came
in to the ER, asked for you.

365
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,509
What's her cup size?

366
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,843
I don't think his cup size
is relevant to his condition.

367
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,850
He accidentally
shot himself in the foot.

368
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,212
Oh, for...

369
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,220
Seriously?

370
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,123
I give you a choice
between moving to Canada

371
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,491
and shooting yourself
in the foot,

372
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,120
and you choose
the bullet?

373
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,494
I didn't want
to be a fugitive.

374
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:55,396
You think this is
gonna get you discharged?

375
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,900
We'll patch it up and
send you right back.

376
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,061
Well, don't patch it up.

377
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,066
Look, you got screwed over

378
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,077
by your own government
and that sucks.

379
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,440
But all you're going
to get out of this

380
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:10,073
is a five-day vacation
and a band-aid.

381
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,312
When I signed up,
I was just a guy.

382
00:19:13,385 --> 00:19:15,080
Now I'm about
to be a dad.

383
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,682
I go back over,
there's a chance

384
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,724
my kid grows up
without a father.

385
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:26,130
You got a girl pregnant.
You're still just a guy.

386
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,240
How much longer
we have to wait?

387
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,710
We have to keep going until
you start feeling something.

388
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,043
Might help if you told me
what I'm supposed to feel.

389
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,242
I do that, that's all
you'll be thinking about.

390
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,285
Then you'll be telling me
that's what you're feeling.

391
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,751
Power of suggestion.

392
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,983
The other black dude who was in
here earlier, he your brother?

393
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,489
What gave it away?

394
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,151
The way you looked at him.

395
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,694
I have two older brothers, and
we always want to kill each other.

396
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,104
Something wrong?

397
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,834
Not really.
Just feels itchy.

398
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,074
Is that what you
were waiting for?

399
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,079
Means lymphoma's
most likely.

400
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:16,739
But that's
actually good news.

401
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,112
How can that
be good news?

402
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:19,514
Because it's treatable,

403
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,951
we can remove your spleen
tonight laparoscopically.

404
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,647
Will I be up and
around by Saturday?

405
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:26,155
We can get to the
radiation in the off-season.

406
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:33,324
Hey, Ma. Wake up.
Ma, wake up. I'm itchy.

407
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,628
Means I can play.

408
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,351
What are you
doing in the dark?

409
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,056
Lying in wait.

410
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,500
Jeez, what happened
to your face?

411
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,264
Right, play innocent.

412
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,338
Like you weren't
looking for revenge

413
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,635
for the prank
that I didn't pull.

414
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:52,541
It's karmic justice,
but I didn't do it.

415
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:55,205
Of course you realize,
this means war.

416
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,583
Isolating
the gastroepiploic artery.

417
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,722
Nearly there.

418
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,093
Foreman, come and
take a look at this.

419
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,464
Liver's inflamed.

420
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,862
So the itching wasn't
caused by his spleen.

421
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,237
It's not lymphoma.

422
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,080
What happened
to your face?

423
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,745
Wilson annexed
the Sudetenland.

424
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,079
No abnormal
T- cells or B-cells,

425
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,714
it's definitely
not lymphoma.

426
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:43,624
Liver biopsy only revealed
non-specific inflammation.

427
00:22:43,729 --> 00:22:45,219
Kind of like the time

428
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,891
you took your mom's birth
control pills on a dare

429
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,934
and ended up with
swollen nipples.

430
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,593
That never happened.
Right.

431
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,071
And your nickname all the way up
through high school wasn't Erica.

432
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,573
It wasn't.

433
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:59,941
Okay, I may have
made that one up.

434
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,343
With the understanding that my
brother still had his sense of humor

435
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:03,675
and would figure
out to play along.

436
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,875
Polymyositis would
explain the head,

437
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,646
liver, heart,
even the white fingers.

438
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:11,314
Would also be accompanied by a
significant decrease in muscle power.

439
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:14,221
Marcus, chance to
redeem yourself.

440
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,317
Does our patient
look strong to you?

441
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:22,165
Sorry, Eric. Big brother
disagrees with your diagnosis.

442
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,359
Felty syndrome?

443
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,767
You said the liver was
inflamed, not the spleen.

444
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,635
Can you believe they let
this guy perform surgery?

445
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:29,731
What are you doing?

446
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,036
Requesting permission
to share my idea

447
00:23:31,143 --> 00:23:33,270
without being belittled in
front of your new assistant.

448
00:23:33,345 --> 00:23:35,711
Permission denied.
Continue.

449
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,506
Our patient has cartilage
damage in both ankles,

450
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,177
he gets lidocaine shots before
every game to mask the pain.

451
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:44,312
Team doctor uses the same
needle twice by accident?

452
00:23:44,389 --> 00:23:45,447
Viral hepatitis.

453
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,719
Do you think he's an idiot, Marcus?

454
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,317
I don't think
he's an idiot.

455
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,453
Okay.
Go test his blood.

456
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,358
Come on. We have
a lunch scheduled.

457
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:02,405
So you jerked me around.

458
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:07,534
Your allegiance lies with your
brother. I get it. Admirable.

459
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:10,839
But here's the problem. I
hired you to tell me the truth.

460
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,510
If you don't do that,
you no longer have a job.

461
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:15,416
I don't know what secret
you're looking to uncover,

462
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,511
but my brother
is a decent guy.

463
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,057
He was arrested
for grand theft auto.

464
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,126
You're gonna
be disappointed.

465
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,354
Try me.

466
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,295
He tell you
I was with him?

467
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:27,524
Was it your idea?

468
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,588
We did everything
together,

469
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,725
I don't know
whose idea it was.

470
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:31,826
I was 16,
he was only 14.

471
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,371
Little punk couldn't even
see over the steering wheel,

472
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,929
but he was quicker
with a flathead screwdriver

473
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:39,272
than most people
with a key.

474
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,942
Sorry to interrupt my character
assassination with boring medical stuff,

475
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,541
but when we drew
the patient's blood

476
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,678
it clotted right there
in the vacutainer.

477
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:53,383
So the problem is not in his
blood, it's the blood itself.

478
00:24:53,458 --> 00:24:55,426
He's been working out in
the cold, doing two-a-days,

479
00:24:55,527 --> 00:24:57,586
it's got to be
cryoglobulinemia.

480
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:01,223
I usually love breaking bad
news, but in this case...

481
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,101
Start the patient
on warfarin.

482
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:07,605
I am so sorry about that.
You were saying?

483
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,503
We drove for
about 10 minutes

484
00:25:11,576 --> 00:25:14,340
before we got caught
and that was it.

485
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:15,811
When mom came
down to the station,

486
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,941
she didn't say a word
the whole ride home.

487
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,783
She came to the driveway,
turned off the car.

488
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,254
We're sitting in there
in silence.

489
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,483
And then,
without turning around,

490
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,584
she said,
"I'll pray for you. "

491
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:33,662
Then she got
out of the car.

492
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,829
Wow. You got off easy.

493
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:41,929
Easy for you, easy for
me. Not easy for Eric.

494
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,368
His life mission became to never
disappoint our mother like that again.

495
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:49,345
Because he is
a good guy.

496
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,048
Thought he would tell
that story at the eulogy,

497
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,518
but I heard
he didn't give one.

498
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,155
Your mother's dead?

499
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,893
If he didn't tell you,
I'm sure he had a reason.

500
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:11,492
Look, you can mock him all
you want about peeing the bed,

501
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:17,031
but please don't
bring up our mother.

502
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:24,877
Your blood contains an abnormally
high volume of certain proteins,

503
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,245
called cryoglobulins.

504
00:26:26,518 --> 00:26:29,009
They become thick
when it gets cold outside.

505
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,352
It's like a car trying to run
after the oil's turned to sludge.

506
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,654
We think that's what's been
causing all your problems.

507
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,923
So I just need a quick oil
change and I'm good to go.

508
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:40,088
This oil change
isn't so quick.

509
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,758
We have to put you on blood
thinners and other medications.

510
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:44,892
The process will take
two to three weeks,

511
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:47,699
but after that, you should be
able to play without a problem.

512
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,330
After that,
it's not gonna matter.

513
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:51,705
Doctor, if Daryl doesn't
play in front of the scouts

514
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,676
on Saturday,
he won't get drafted.

515
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,474
Can't you wait
until after the game?

516
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,038
If we wait
and let him play,

517
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,449
there's a good chance
he dies right on the field.

518
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,692
I had an epiphany.

519
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,703
Usually that precedes you
walking away with purpose, so...

520
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:22,567
Flathead screwdriver.

521
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,541
And then I say...

522
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:27,504
It's not a game,
it's proof

523
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:29,410
that you didn't rig the
grab rail and make me fall.

524
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,812
I already have
proof of that.

525
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,782
The fact that
I didn't do it.

526
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:34,044
I can't go on that.

527
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,313
But I can go
on the fact

528
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,753
that I had to borrow a
flathead screwdriver from Nora

529
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,086
to install the thing because
we only had a Phillips head.

530
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,092
Then, of course, I
returned it late that night

531
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,822
in a completely successful
effort to see her braless.

532
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:46,453
Whoa! Wait. Wait a
minute. Wait a minute.

533
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:50,091
Which means that you didn't have
the tool to sabotage the grab rail.

534
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,796
Braless? Under, like,
a sweater? Or, like, a...

535
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,806
Now I also have proof that I'm
not responsible for the opossum

536
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:59,433
because I'm absolving you of
responsibility instead of escalating,

537
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,069
which you know is
not in my nature.

538
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:05,674
So someone is breaking into
our place just to screw with us?

539
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,584
The opossum
was meant for me.

540
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,653
I'm so tired. It was exciting
until about 2:00 a. m.

541
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,389
Now it's just torture.

542
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,093
Did you even go
to college?

543
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,137
This is the escalation,
isn't it?

544
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,467
Keeping me up
all night.

545
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,475
Nothing happens, then you keep
me up all night again tomorrow.

546
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,067
This is your retaliation.

547
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:35,476
You see,
that's just illogical,

548
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,105
'cause I'm
staying up, too.

549
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,480
Maybe you napped all day.

550
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,917
I gave you empirical proof
that I did not prank you.

551
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,581
No. No, you did not. You
created empirical proof

552
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,123
that I didn't
prank you,

553
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:50,252
selling me on the notion
that you didn't prank me.

554
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:52,795
Maybe you self-pranked.

555
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,161
I don't masterprank.

556
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,925
Is that cut on
your cheek even real?

557
00:28:57,035 --> 00:29:01,836
See? This is exactly what our
nemesis wants. Divide and conquer.

558
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,203
Can't you see that?

559
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,004
Okay.
I'm going to bed.

560
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,206
I'm telling you,
if we sleep now,

561
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,904
we're going to wake up
next to severed horse heads.

562
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,414
Or worse, the rest of it.

563
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,820
Oh!

564
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,784
House!

565
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,554
The flatscreen!

566
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,978
You would never
sacrifice the flatscreen.

567
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,710
Oh, this guy's good.

568
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:54,891
Is there a reason
for this?

569
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:03,394
<i>There is a reason
for everything, mes amis.</i>

570
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:09,232
I am troubled to report that
we have a criminal in our midst.

571
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,602
Guilty of what,
exactly?

572
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:15,303
Last night the fire sprinklers
flooded our apartment.

573
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:19,213
And before that, I found
an opossum in my bathtub.

574
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,720
You each had motive,
you each had opportunity.

575
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,290
This is the emergency
you paged me about?

576
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,450
<i>Not so fast,
Mademoiselle Cuddy.</i>

577
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,496
No one leaves here
until they can account

578
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,658
for their whereabouts
the evening last.

579
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,960
Bye.

580
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,666
Okay. No one who
is employed by me

581
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:41,966
leaves here until
they account

582
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,735
for their whereabouts
the evening last.

583
00:30:43,808 --> 00:30:46,038
What about you,
Professor Chase?

584
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,304
Why would I?

585
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:49,512
Because you
hold me responsible

586
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,105
for breaking up
your marriage.

587
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,774
I was here all night
with Thirteen

588
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:56,116
monitoring our patient's
IV blood thinners.

589
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,686
Can either of you
prove that?

590
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,780
The patient's alive
and improving.

591
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,052
Is that proof enough?

592
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,251
For now.

593
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,826
What about you,
Colonel Taub?

594
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:07,160
I was out to dinner
with my wife.

595
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,631
Really? Your wife?

596
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,532
Yes, really.

597
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,297
Good enough. 'Cause I
had you pegged all along.

598
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,472
You certainly had all
the motive in the world.

599
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,637
First of all,
I'm not interested.

600
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:24,648
Second, I don't even know
where you guys live.

601
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,685
Yesterday, I confirmed
that you are a liar.

602
00:31:27,785 --> 00:31:29,082
What are you
talking about?

603
00:31:29,153 --> 00:31:31,781
Well, at least
a liar by omission.

604
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:32,948
House!

605
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,785
Don't.

606
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,622
Get this, class.
Foreman's mom died.

607
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,900
He ever tell any of you?

608
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:49,201
House, I think you're
getting off topic here.

609
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,140
Is he serious?
Did your mom pass away?

610
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,312
About three months ago.

611
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,677
I'm so sorry.

612
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,079
Why didn't you
tell anybody?

613
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,706
And to top it off,

614
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,252
he refused to say anything
nice about her at the funeral.

615
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,981
I didn't talk because
it isn't anyone's business.

616
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:09,015
Stop. You don't have to
explain yourself to this guy.

617
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,452
You want to hit me,
don't you?

618
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:12,428
Marcus, don't.

619
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,232
I quit.

620
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,273
You should stop him.
He needs this job.

621
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,437
Our patient
needs a fresh IV.

622
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,117
I don't need two
to three weeks.

623
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,183
See?
Got my color back.

624
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,053
It means you're getting
better, but it doesn't...

625
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:48,587
Means I am better. My coach
had the team doctor come by.

626
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:49,758
He cleared me to play.

627
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:53,428
Did your team doctor realize
you're on blood thinners?

628
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,129
I'm off them now.

629
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,266
You're still sick.

630
00:32:58,376 --> 00:32:59,934
You're not ready
to go off your meds.

631
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:01,909
Daryl, listen to him.
It is not worth the risk...

632
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,141
I'll come back
on Sunday, Mom.

633
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:05,806
You guys can give me
all the meds I need then.

634
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:08,477
The treatment
doesn't work that way.

635
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,157
Please, go with him.

636
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,004
The antibiotics
aren't working.

637
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,006
We're going to switch you
to different ones,

638
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,933
but you're going
to lose your toe.

639
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,279
Outstanding, soldier!

640
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,447
As a general rule, before you
celebrate, do a little research.

641
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,214
The Army's Medical
Evaluation Board

642
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,283
is perfectly fine with
nine-toed infantrymen,

643
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,852
as long as they
can walk and run.

644
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:54,826
So I lost a toe
for nothing?

645
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:56,093
Afraid so.

646
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,135
Unless you want me to keep
you on the old antibiotics.

647
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,534
We can let
the infection spread,

648
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,165
then we can amputate
more than just a toe.

649
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,248
Why are you risking
your life for this?

650
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,715
Your mom doesn't
want you to.

651
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,780
My mom sacrificed
everything for me.

652
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,319
Her telling me
not to come here

653
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,357
is just another
example of that.

654
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,153
I do good out there,

655
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,990
I could take care of her
for the rest of her life.

656
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,662
Who am I if I don't sacrifice
for her? That's family.

657
00:34:54,225 --> 00:34:56,989
You okay?

658
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,358
Everything's blurry.

659
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:05,391
I can't see.

660
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:12,605
Take me back
to the hospital.

661
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,450
The blindness means
we were wrong about...

662
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,215
<i>Actually,
I'm responsible for that.</i>

663
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:28,585
I spiked his water bottle with
nitrates. Dropped his blood pressure,

664
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,718
robbed oxygen rich blood from
his brain, making him blind.

665
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:33,387
I figured a temporarily blind patient

666
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,227
is better than
a permanently dead one.

667
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,493
His vision was
already coming back

668
00:35:36,567 --> 00:35:38,034
by the time I dropped
him off at the hospital.

669
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:43,431
Well played. If only we could
combine your medical chicanery

670
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,442
with your brother's
ability to fetch me mochas,

671
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,205
you'd be
the perfect Foreman.

672
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,267
Where are you?

673
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:49,438
I'm busy.

674
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,008
Great, so we don't
have a new symptom.

675
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:56,143
Means we should just stick
him back on his blood thinners,

676
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,744
and he should be okay to
leave in a couple weeks.

677
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,983
Actually, we do
have a new symptom.

678
00:36:00,124 --> 00:36:03,616
Any of you take a look
at his readmittance chart?

679
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,454
Between the time
he checked in

680
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,588
and the time
he re-checked in,

681
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,155
our patient lost
a single pound.

682
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,535
Patient like that would
usually shed over 10 pounds.

683
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:15,629
The obvious answer
would be steroids,

684
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,674
but since we've
already ruled them out...

685
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:21,869
So he's not injecting, but he
could be getting them naturally.

686
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,810
Paraneoplastic syndrome,

687
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:26,441
the body produces antibodies
which battle cancer,

688
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,178
which could also act
like growth hormone.

689
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:32,313
We've eliminated lymphoma. What
other cancers mimic growth hormone?

690
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,324
Lung, pancreatic,
renal, breast...

691
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,883
It was a rhetorical question,
I don't really care.

692
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,552
Go test him
for all of them.

693
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,540
What are you doing here?

694
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,168
You need a job.

695
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,144
Maybe I can
talk to House,

696
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,809
see if I can get
your job back.

697
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,017
As soon as he knows you're
okay with me being there,

698
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,387
he won't want me back.

699
00:37:07,658 --> 00:37:10,923
Maybe I can help you
figure out something else.

700
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,931
I promise
I won't let you down.

701
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,763
Don't do that.

702
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:23,404
Let's just see
how it goes.

703
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:30,438
So do they mandate you to
stay here at the halfway house,

704
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:35,582
or can you come stay
with family?

705
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,728
It's Foreman.

706
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,996
Well, it should stop
now that Marcus left.

707
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,833
Well, that's
the whole point.

708
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,910
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was my leg sticking out?

709
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,447
I'm so distracted lately, trying
to think of something funnier

710
00:38:04,548 --> 00:38:05,913
than fire sprinklers
going off

711
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,952
in the middle of the night.
Any ideas?

712
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:15,222
Whoa. Easy there, tiger. I know
where you live. You know how I know?

713
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,193
'Cause my girlfriend
and I,

714
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:19,627
we tried to buy
that very same condo.

715
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,822
Why don't you
leave me out of this?

716
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:22,525
Wilson was the one
who bought the place.

717
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,867
And you're living there. You
deserve to suffer equally.

718
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,563
Actually, I've suffered more
now that you just tripped me.

719
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,233
Hey, hey. I'm...

720
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,074
His suffering will equal out
because he actually feels remorse.

721
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,977
Why would you
out yourself?

722
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,448
You can't even imagine
the retribution.

723
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,816
There won't be any. I'm ceasing
all offensive operations.

724
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:47,152
I've both made my point and
established my superiority.

725
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:50,386
And if you even get to the
planning stages of retaliation,

726
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:53,726
I will tell Cuddy that she
lost her dream place to you two.

727
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,425
See, she's under
this odd impression

728
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,161
that you guys
are her friends.

729
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,314
There's no cancer.

730
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,718
We scanned him
head to toe,

731
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,279
we checked blood smears
for leukemia,

732
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,849
we even ultrasounded his chest
looking for breast cancer.

733
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,757
Maybe I was wrong
about the weight loss.

734
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,263
You weren't wrong. We found
blood in his catheter bag.

735
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:28,559
His kidneys are failing.

736
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:29,792
So it has to be cancer.

737
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,960
Paraneoplastic syndrome
is the only thing

738
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,095
that can link kidney,
heart and liver,

739
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:35,195
even the rage.

740
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:36,637
Then why can't
we find it?

741
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,642
We've looked everywhere
inside this guy.

742
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:42,142
What if it's not inside?

743
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,626
You know why
you're black?

744
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,222
'Cause God loves me
more than he loves you.

745
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:06,201
Hmm. What I was going for was
melanin. You got lots of it.

746
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,804
Makes your skin dark,

747
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:10,466
protects you from
the sun's harmful UV rays.

748
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,667
What are you doing?

749
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,209
Unfortunately,
it also prevents

750
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,142
even those with advanced
medical degrees

751
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:19,308
from considering melanoma
as a diagnosis. Other hand.

752
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,309
On the rare occasion that
black people do get skin cancer,

753
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,617
they usually get it
on their white parts,

754
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,249
like the palms and
soles of the feet.

755
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,420
But your hands and feet are
so smashed up from football

756
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,128
that my team would
likely have written off

757
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,360
any skin blemish
as a bruise.

758
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,935
But now that I know that melanoma
is the only thing that fits...

759
00:40:43,874 --> 00:40:46,365
Come take
a look at this, Mom.

760
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,344
There's the thorn in the panther's
paw. Paraneoplastic syndrome.

761
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,518
Your body forms antibodies
to fight the tumor.

762
00:40:57,588 --> 00:41:01,456
<i>Those tiny little proteins travel
through your blood and wreak havoc.</i>

763
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,926
We remove the cancerous mole,
everything should be fine.

764
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,896
I'll tell Dr. Chase
to schedule the surgery.

765
00:41:08,265 --> 00:41:12,167
Why bother?
I missed my shot.

766
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,033
What kind of life
am I gonna lead now?

767
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:16,799
Did you study really,
really hard?

768
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,536
Then the same crappy life

769
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:23,944
that the rest of the guys you'll be
graduating with are going to lead,

770
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,107
minus the student loans.

771
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:32,915
Hey, you ready?

772
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,082
Almost.

773
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,394
And done.

774
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,155
I heard House and Wilson are
getting pranked by someone.

775
00:41:42,266 --> 00:41:44,325
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

776
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,561
No.

777
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,767
And why should
I believe you?

778
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,999
You said I had
a trusting face.

779
00:41:50,407 --> 00:41:53,638
I still don't understand why you
wouldn't let me retaliate, though.

780
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,234
They stole your dream.

781
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,076
Well, that's overstating it.
It's just a condo.

782
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:01,675
It's not because you feel
guilty about hurting House?

783
00:42:01,785 --> 00:42:03,719
Or guilty for
being with me?

784
00:42:03,787 --> 00:42:05,345
We'll buy another one.

785
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,287
I just don't see the need
to make a war out of it.

786
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,757
Well, I think
you're rationalizing,

787
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:10,191
which a less confident man
than myself

788
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:13,320
might take as a sign that
you're second guessing...

789
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,594
Okay. You know what?
Forget that last part.

790
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:20,868
I heard Foreman
and his brother

791
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,031
are trying to
work things out.

792
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,164
That's nice for them.

793
00:42:24,241 --> 00:42:26,334
It's nice of you.

794
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,878
You didn't provoke Marcus to
quit so the pranks would stop.

795
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,449
You were becoming the common
enemy they could bond over.

796
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:37,817
You are the diabolical,
yet benevolent puppetmaster.

797
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:42,118
I provoked Marcus to quit because
he was no longer useful to me.

798
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:44,285
I hired him to get
information, I got information.

799
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,623
Uh-huh.

800
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,687
And how are we going
to get back at Lucas?

801
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,163
We're not.

802
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,532
I win.
