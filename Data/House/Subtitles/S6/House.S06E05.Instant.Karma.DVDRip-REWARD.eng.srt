1
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:28,260
Mr. Randall?
They're here.

2
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,573
Fifty-two million
includes over six million

3
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,115
already issued pursuant to
the over-allotment option.

4
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,514
When can we close?

5
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:55,076
It would be subject to regulatory
approval in both Toronto...

6
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,817
I didn't say how,
Oliver, I said when.

7
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,818
What?

8
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:02,794
You sure this is a direction
you want to go, Roy?

9
00:01:02,862 --> 00:01:05,422
This would move us from
energy service into energy...

10
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:06,897
You don't think
oil's going up?

11
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,059
Of course it's gonna go up.
The question is when.

12
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:10,295
The question
is always when.

13
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,838
And if we wait until the deal
makes sense to everyone else,

14
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,875
we're gonna be waiting in
line behind everyone else.

15
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,000
All I'm saying is...

16
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,978
The same cover-your-ass crap
you always say.

17
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,877
We're gonna have to
wrap this up. I gotta go.

18
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:24,416
Where are you going?
Upstairs.

19
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,611
Get the regulators on it. I want
to close by the end of the month.

20
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,711
Come on, Roy. There are 10
other items on the agenda.

21
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:30,119
Which'll have to wait
until next week.

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,090
You can't drag us
all out of the office,

23
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,558
get halfway through,
and then just kick us out.

24
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,026
Yeah, I can.

25
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:05,524
The antibiotic
treatment had no effect.

26
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:07,958
Both the fever and the
pain are getting worse,

27
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,019
which means it's not
Clostridium difficile.

28
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:14,192
But you said that was the
only diagnosis that made sense.

29
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:17,930
It was. We need to
get him to a hospital.

30
00:02:18,004 --> 00:02:19,164
Dad.

31
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,839
I don't want to go.

32
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:30,348
I know, buddy.
But we may need to.

33
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,442
Am I gonna die?

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,353
No. Of course not.

35
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:39,749
How do you know?

36
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,820
Well, I just do.

37
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,297
And I'm always right,
aren't I?

38
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,062
Yeah.

39
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:28,064
I want House.

40
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,577
I understand, but I told you
Dr. House isn't available.

41
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:32,736
Dr...
Call him.

42
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,908
Tell him I'll have a private jet
pick him up from whatever island...

43
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,975
He isn't on vacation. Dr. Foreman
is one of our best doctors.

44
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,543
Is House in jail?

45
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:46,115
No. Foreman is currently working with
two of House's most veteran associates.

46
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,454
Rehab?

47
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:48,687
No.

48
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,796
Mr. Randall, your son
will be in good hands.

49
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,331
My son

50
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,401
has already been in good
hands, and he's still dying.

51
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:00,562
I'm through
dealing with good.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,838
I want the best, and everyone
I've asked says that's House.

53
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:09,007
So unless he's dead,
comatose, or insane,

54
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:13,280
I want him treating
my son today.

55
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,990
You could have said no
in good conscience.

56
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,029
The kid'll still be
Foreman's patient,

57
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,588
but his dad wants you
making the decisions.

58
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,031
Then he's not my patient.

59
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,764
You want to give me none of the
responsibility and all of the liability?

60
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:33,703
Which means I get...

61
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,871
Oh, cool.

62
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:40,171
Don't let him do
anything crazy.

63
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,374
When is he getting his license back
so we can stop playing this game?

64
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,781
Maybe never.
This game is fun.

65
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,849
You also need to prepare
President Dibala's case

66
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:51,947
for this week's Morbidity
and Mortality conference.

67
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,890
Oh, unfortunately, I'm overdue
on a mani-pedi appointment.

68
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,362
Not you,
Foreman's department.

69
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,264
Oh, right. Well, he's got
all the time in the world.

70
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,770
We made the wrong call, he
died, there's nothing to present.

71
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,805
It obviously garnered
a lot of curiosity.

72
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,568
And we don't have more
important things to do

73
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,166
than satisfy everyone's
idle curiosity?

74
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,711
It's not idle.

75
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,942
The question of how we deal
with two possible diagnoses

76
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:19,576
whose treatments are
contraindicated is worth discussing.

77
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:24,455
Abdominal pain increasing
in severity and frequency,

78
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,493
fever, dehydration,
diarrhea, weight loss.

79
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,085
Mom died from kidney failure
caused by type 1 diabetes,

80
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,187
which has been ruled out.

81
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:33,129
Seventeen doctors.

82
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,828
Everything's been ruled out,
which means we have to re-rule out.

83
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:41,397
Get a new history and physical.
Unless that's crazy, boss.

84
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,741
Been out of the country or
on any recent camping trips?

85
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,340
No camping. But we were in
Montreal back in January.

86
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:53,112
We went to see the NHL
All-Star Game for my birthday.

87
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,483
Awesome.

88
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,353
Where's Dr. House?

89
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,947
In his office.

90
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,721
He's really more of
a decider than a doer.

91
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,785
He's decided we
should start over.

92
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,196
You never know what previous
doctors may have missed.

93
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,233
Like this.

94
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,930
Does that hurt more
when I push there?

95
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,303
Not really.

96
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,842
What is it?

97
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:19,369
I'm not sure.

98
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,806
Just keep it clean,
simple.

99
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,577
We did a test that called into
question our initial diagnosis,

100
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,083
so we changed our mind.

101
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,620
And if they ask how
the test was done?

102
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,849
Why would they do that?
It's a routine lab test.

103
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:34,381
Routine lab tests don't involve
blood you stole from a corpse

104
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,519
to trick me into giving
the guy the wrong treatment.

105
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:38,120
Yes, and if you
brought that up,

106
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,721
it'd certainly make
for a lively debate

107
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,131
about the morality
of murdering murderers.

108
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,066
But since you burned the
only evidence of that...

109
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,037
To cover for you,
not me.

110
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,972
You're protected. The
decision was a coin flip.

111
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,532
There was no right
or wrong answer.

112
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:56,571
The body's underground, 8,000 miles
away. Nobody can prove anything.

113
00:06:56,649 --> 00:06:59,277
That room will be filled,
not because of a coin flip,

114
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,118
not because of the patient, but
because House's department screwed up.

115
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:06,124
They're gonna be like sharks
in a chum-filled swimming pool,

116
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:10,151
and there's no way I'm jumping
in unless I'm in a steel cage.

117
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,224
So what do you want?

118
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,028
I want to know you
have everything covered.

119
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:16,728
Got what covered?

120
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,402
We're just reviewing
the Dibala case.

121
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:23,033
Making sure we
didn't miss anything.

122
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,636
We didn't. Except, of course,
the thing that killed him.

123
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:29,910
He's constipated.

124
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,746
Physical revealed a mass in his
abdomen, so I repeated the X-ray.

125
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,380
Old one was clean, new one shows that
his colon is almost completely impacted.

126
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,289
Obstruction would
explain the pain.

127
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,020
You think they just
screwed up the old X-ray?

128
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,254
Nope.

129
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:47,588
Hirschsprung's?

130
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,500
It's a congenital disorder
of the nerves in the colon.

131
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,333
Very rare in a child
your son's age.

132
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,997
Most doctors would
never think of it.

133
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,335
And you came up
with this?

134
00:07:55,408 --> 00:07:56,432
It's House's idea.

135
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,670
We need a barium enema
and biopsy to confirm.

136
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:02,339
Let me guess,
it tastes really bad,

137
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,315
but it's gonna make
me feel a lot better.

138
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,177
Actually, you're not
gonna taste it.

139
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,329
You should try searching for
"Misty May digs for gold. "

140
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,902
Make sure you
put it in quotes.

141
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,333
I'm making travel plans.

142
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,866
I just need to get away,
have some time to myself.

143
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,476
You getting the hint?

144
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:38,406
So that's it?

145
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,652
You're done with your little
experiment with Foreman?

146
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:45,520
It wasn't an experiment,
it was a relationship.

147
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,718
You may wanna look
into the difference.

148
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,694
I'm glad you're
better, House.

149
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:56,861
I actually liked working for
you, but I'm not coming back.

150
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,096
Good.

151
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,331
Because if you came back,

152
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,738
Foreman would try
and save the relationship,

153
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:05,140
and he'd give up
being the boss.

154
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:08,637
Are you here to try to save
my relationship with Foreman?

155
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,343
God, no. I'm trying to save
my relationship with Foreman.

156
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:16,912
Right now, I'm Kobe, playing the
game I love, however the hell I want,

157
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:20,922
and Phil Jackson has to listen
to everyone else bitch about it.

158
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,392
Enjoy Cabo.

159
00:09:26,098 --> 00:09:27,963
I'm going to Thailand.

160
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:30,462
Really?

161
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,695
Interesting.

162
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,262
Goodbye, House.

163
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:37,069
Goodbye, Thirteen.

164
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,839
Last week,
yesterday, today.

165
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,973
I can't believe it.

166
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,816
He's pain-free for the first
time in months, he's even hungry.

167
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,252
I'm starving.

168
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,789
We're still waiting
for the biopsy results,

169
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:52,289
but obviously
it's a good sign.

170
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,723
You're gonna
want to take it slow.

171
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,126
Don't try to regain all
the lost weight in one meal.

172
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:00,123
What's wrong?

173
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,293
The abdomen feels
normal, but looks bigger.

174
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:08,637
Jack, are you feeling...
Jack? Hey, Jack, you okay?

175
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,642
Right eye is fixed.
Lateral rectus palsy.

176
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:17,311
He's seizing. Need five
milligrams of diazepam.

177
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:19,116
What's happening?

178
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,709
Hold down his head
and turn off the lights.

179
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,083
I need to see his optic disk.

180
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:24,122
Heart rate's elevated.
Come on, hold his head.

181
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,885
I'm trying.
Wait. Where's House?

182
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,186
Mr. Randall, we need
you to step back.

183
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,750
His optic disks are swollen. He's
got intracranial hypertension.

184
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:31,456
Furosemide,
20 milligrams, IV.

185
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,588
If we could intubate him...

186
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:35,463
Need five more
milligrams of diazepam.

187
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,503
DC the monitors. Push 500
milligrams of phenytoin.

188
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,562
You can't push that much.
We gotta relieve the pressure,

189
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,698
or his brain can herniate.

190
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,207
Oh, my God.

191
00:10:45,077 --> 00:10:47,477
Fifty milligrams
of phenytoin in.

192
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,748
Page Chase. Tell him
to meet us in the OR.

193
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,575
We need your consent.

194
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,949
What's happening to him?

195
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,453
The pressure in
his skull's too high.

196
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,614
If we don't reduce it, it could
irrevocably damage his brain.

197
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,351
But he was just talking.
He was smiling.

198
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,687
We need to drill
burr holes.

199
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,954
Drill into his head?

200
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,893
Phenytoin's not working.
Paralyze him.

201
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,225
Three milligrams
of pancuronium.

202
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,628
Then intubate
and hyperventilate.

203
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,192
Where's House?

204
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,634
House isn't here.
Do we have your consent?

205
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,373
Do we have your consent?
Ready? One, two, three.

206
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,674
Injecting three milligrams
of pancuronium.

207
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:31,113
Look at the monitors. He's still
seizing. We need to do this now.

208
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,251
Go!

209
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:52,136
Electrical seizure
activity's stopped.

210
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,872
Intracranial pressure's
declining. Come on, keep going.

211
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,941
Pressure's down to eight.

212
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:02,651
I'll go tell the dad.

213
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,957
What happened?

214
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,321
I have no idea.

215
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,562
He hasn't had
any more seizures,

216
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:17,227
and cytological examination of the
subdural fluid showed no abnormalities.

217
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,534
Don't usually see brain
damage after a rectal biopsy.

218
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,073
He was fine
after the procedure.

219
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,041
No headaches,
no mental status change.

220
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,304
It wasn't anything we did.

221
00:12:25,377 --> 00:12:26,639
It's not just his brain.

222
00:12:26,712 --> 00:12:30,409
He's continuing to build up fluid in
his abdominal cavity as well as the dura.

223
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,383
We've inserted shunts
to drain it.

224
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,578
It's got to be some sort
of systemic infection.

225
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:38,714
Not after spending the last week
getting pumped full of IV antibiotics.

226
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,760
You notice anything odd about
the shape of the fluid collection?

227
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,089
Oh, God.

228
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:45,962
Virgin Mary!

229
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,131
The edge should be
tapered, lens-shaped.

230
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:59,437
Unless the dural layer was
already separated from the brain

231
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,003
when the fluid
started to build up.

232
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,616
Get a dural biopsy
to confirm brain cancer.

233
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,253
Nice catch.

234
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,486
Bangkok. Flight 799.

235
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,727
Wow, Bangkok. That
sounds awesome. How long?

236
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,289
Not sure yet.

237
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:27,500
Luckily, I have a friend who's staying
at my place taking care of my dog.

238
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:31,065
He's really big, so he
needs a lot of exercise.

239
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,544
Remy Hadley.
H- A-D-L-E-Y.

240
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,808
What, you think
I'm gonna rob the place?

241
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:38,406
No. Of course not.

242
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,085
In case you haven't
noticed, I have a job.

243
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,586
Look, I'm sorry,
I don't know you.

244
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,419
You're either honest or dishonest,
I figured the safer choice is to...

245
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,550
Is to treat a stranger
like an ass.

246
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,322
Nice way to live
your life. Bitch.

247
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,555
I said I'm sorry.

248
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:56,226
Oh! Hello. I was wondering if there
are any Business Class seats open

249
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,032
that I could use
my miles to upgrade to.

250
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,696
I don't know you,

251
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:04,038
but I assumed I could trust
you, welcomed you into my car.

252
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,940
Okay, you're a saint.

253
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,940
That's impossible, I confirmed
my reservation last night.

254
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,607
So re-book it.

255
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,113
Well, obviously, it was a
mistake on your end, not mine.

256
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,157
No. I'm on my way
to the airport right now.

257
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,557
They didn't believe you, huh?

258
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,094
Brain cancer?

259
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,037
We should know
for sure by the morning.

260
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:39,467
Our luck just keeps
getting worse, huh?

261
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,274
Treatment options are
getting better every day.

262
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:44,145
There's no visible mass, so even
if the biopsy comes back positive,

263
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,376
we've caught it early.

264
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,612
Oh, so, you're telling me
this is good news?

265
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm saying we will do
whatever we can.

266
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,184
Right.

267
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,725
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,091
I gotta go. Foreman needs
more help with the M&M prep.

269
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:06,171
Okay. I'll come up and help
after I finish the biopsy.

270
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,798
We can handle it.
I'll see you at home later.

271
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,466
If you're here,
I might as well be.

272
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:12,601
Go home.
Get some rest.

273
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,545
'Cause I'm gonna be waking
you up as soon as I get home.

274
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,518
Stay out of my life.

275
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,884
Okay.

276
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,620
I know you canceled
my reservation.

277
00:15:28,694 --> 00:15:31,959
You obviously saw me log in when you
were spying on me in the coffee shop.

278
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:33,396
I was talking to you.

279
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,296
I was spying on the MILF
in the running shorts.

280
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,732
I'm not coming back
on the team.

281
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:37,928
I don't want you
back on the team.

282
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:41,666
I cannot work for, with,
or around Foreman.

283
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,470
Which is why I don't
want you back on the team.

284
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:46,738
Now that you're out of the
picture, he's better than ever,

285
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,643
which is gonna make me
less miserable than ever,

286
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,375
which is why neither
of us gives a damn

287
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,680
how, when, or on what island in the
Bahamas you wanna get away from it all.

288
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,219
The Bahamas?

289
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,249
Costa Rica?

290
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,915
I told you, Thailand.

291
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,118
I assumed
you were lying

292
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,253
because it would have been idiotic
of you to tell me the truth.

293
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,060
Yet another reason
I have no use for you.

294
00:16:10,936 --> 00:16:12,494
We've got a problem.

295
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:14,505
When Cameron sent
Dibala's blood to the lab,

296
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,474
she specifically asked for the
anticentromere antibodies test.

297
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:18,737
So?

298
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,212
The printout they sent you included
just the anticentromere antibodies,

299
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:24,613
but the lab also did
a full blood panel.

300
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,617
So? I'm not an idiot.

301
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,813
I obviously made sure the cadaver I got
the sample from had the same blood type.

302
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,857
You apparently didn't
check his cholesterol.

303
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,483
How far off?

304
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,585
Twenty percent.

305
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,414
Dibala didn't die
of high cholesterol.

306
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:59,451
Why would anyone even bother
to compare the two reports?

307
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,076
The same reason I did.

308
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,212
Because they're looking for
anything we might've screwed up.

309
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,880
We could claim the blood analyzer broke.

310
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,049
We can't.

311
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,094
Cameron documented that it was perfectly
calibrated when she did the test.

312
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,857
So the numbers are off.
It's weird, who cares?

313
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,363
If it comes up,
just act surprised,

314
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,297
like it's some
irrelevant curiosity.

315
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,360
I can't do this. I can't go in
there and stack lie upon lie.

316
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:23,137
You've got to figure out
a way to explain this.

317
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,575
Hey.
Hey.

318
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,802
Missed you this morning.
Yeah, sorry.

319
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,438
I needed to get in early.
I didn't want to wake you.

320
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:30,812
I thought you did
want to wake me.

321
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,646
At least that's what you said
last night. I'm out of here.

322
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,051
No, no. I got the biopsy
results. It's not cancer.

323
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:43,489
How can so much be wrong
with nothing being wrong?

324
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,030
Since when is cancer
being considered nothing?

325
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,965
I just said it's not cancer. The
cell morphologies were all normal.

326
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,729
And so are the most
recent CT scans.

327
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:52,202
On the other hand,

328
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:55,297
adenocarcinoma of the
stomach would cause pain,

329
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:59,538
constipation, and nutritional
deficiencies that could cause seizures.

330
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,704
And wouldn't show on a CT.

331
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,146
You were right about the cancer,
just wrong about the place.

332
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:12,149
Continue to say
nothing if you agree.

333
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,592
Go scope him, get
another set of biopsies.

334
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,726
I get canceling
her ticket,

335
00:18:25,804 --> 00:18:29,001
if you then showed up with
two more to somewhere better.

336
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,132
What are you talking about?

337
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,074
Or showed up at all.

338
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:36,080
But how does just ruining her
plans get her to agree to yours?

339
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,083
You talking about Thirteen?

340
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:41,449
Where's she going?

341
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,044
Nowhere this week,
thanks to you.

342
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,920
I didn't stop her.
I'm not gonna stop her.

343
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:53,125
I've already done all I could.
Now all I can do is move on.

344
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:59,893
I think I actually
believe you.

345
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,339
If you're telling the truth,

346
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,534
you're even more
rational than I...

347
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,168
Well, not more.

348
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:09,947
Then again, more sane.

349
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,143
You're gonna be
a good boss, boss.

350
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,113
I told you,
there's nothing wrong.

351
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,555
There's obviously
something wrong,

352
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,559
and I'm not even saying we
need to talk about it right now.

353
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,118
I just don't see
why you have to deny it.

354
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:25,629
I'm not.

355
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,961
Now you're denying
you're denying.

356
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:30,365
No. I'm denying that
there's anything to deny.

357
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,029
Robert, you can't do this.
You can't hide things from me.

358
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:40,111
There's a problem
with the Dibala M&M.

359
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:45,307
The HDL numbers on one of his early
blood panels don't match a later panel.

360
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:46,681
That's weird.

361
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,613
Yeah.

362
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,854
It's no big deal.

363
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,922
Cholesterol didn't have
anything to do with his death,

364
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,430
but after being
let go from Mercy,

365
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:02,899
and then that thing
with Thirteen's drug trial,

366
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,562
Foreman's paranoid about people
questioning the way he handled the case.

367
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:08,003
Well, that's ridiculous. If anything,
Foreman should be feeling secure.

368
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,541
He's the one who had the right
diagnosis, we talked him out of it.

369
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,407
I know. Don't tell him I told you.

370
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,671
He doesn't want to show
any signs of weakness,

371
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,649
especially now that House is claiming
he wants him to stay in charge.

372
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,878
All right.

373
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:24,047
So it's still cancer.
It's just somewhere else.

374
00:20:24,122 --> 00:20:25,180
That's what
we're looking for,

375
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,350
but it would explain
all the symptoms

376
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,656
and all the normal tests
and imaging studies.

377
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,322
Got biopsies of the
mucosa and the submucosa.

378
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,388
I'm moving
towards the pylorus.

379
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,524
It's my fault.

380
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:41,229
Adenocarcinomas aren't caused
by diet or environmental factors.

381
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:47,344
I inherited a $10 million
pipeline business when I was 24.

382
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:51,344
By the time I was 30,
it was worth over a billion.

383
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,119
Since then, I have been
involved in over 50 deals

384
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:58,213
that make that first one
look like a loser.

385
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,224
Everything I do, everything
I touch, turns to gold,

386
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,492
except my family.

387
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,269
First, my wife
and now my son.

388
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,073
This is my fault.

389
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,816
It's karma.

390
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,245
That's obviously not true.

391
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,016
He's seizing again.

392
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:35,389
Get the scope out.

393
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,394
We need five
milligrams diazepam.

394
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,827
How's the ICP?

395
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,421
It's eight.

396
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,296
But the shunt's
open and clear.

397
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,335
This isn't
intracranial pressure.

398
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:46,462
Then what the hell is it?

399
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:57,279
Seizure's stopped, but he
hasn't regained consciousness.

400
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,648
No sign of any masses in his
stomach or esophageal lining.

401
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,915
And he's still accumulating
subdural and peritoneal fluid.

402
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,857
And every time we look to see where
it's coming from, he starts seizing.

403
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:09,723
You think
we're setting this off?

404
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,921
I think something is.

405
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:14,693
One of his stomach biopsies shows
an arteriole partially occluded.

406
00:22:14,766 --> 00:22:16,461
But with no abnormality
in the other layers,

407
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,060
and no evidence of a cellular
inflammatory reaction.

408
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,297
It's definitely not cancer.

409
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,237
Then it has to be
some sort of infection.

410
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:23,899
We already ruled
out infection.

411
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,637
Only because he was treated
for it and got worse.

412
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:27,804
Seems like a sound reason.

413
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,245
Unless it's a
drug-resistant strain.

414
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,647
Drug-resistant strain
of what?

415
00:22:32,718 --> 00:22:35,084
Bacterial cultures,
viral serologies,

416
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,484
ANA and ANCA
were all negative.

417
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,921
Everything's negative.
We obviously missed something.

418
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,016
Maybe the seizures aren't a
new symptom, they're an old one.

419
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:43,789
No doctor noticed
a thrashing kid?

420
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,489
Abdominal epilepsy.

421
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,965
The seizures would just look like pain
until it spread to his motor cortex.

422
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,262
Wouldn't explain
the fevers.

423
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,326
Protein malnutrition
can cause fevers.

424
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,601
And nothing causes malnutrition
like excruciating stomach pain

425
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:58,199
that gets worse
every time you eat.

426
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,645
I'd be a lot more certain if it was
my idea, but it's the best we got.

427
00:23:05,016 --> 00:23:06,415
Start him on gabapentin,

428
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,285
hook him up to an intracranial
EEG for continuous monitoring.

429
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,293
I gave him statins.

430
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,459
What?

431
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,003
If they ask about the cholesterol,
just say I prescribed a statin

432
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,129
and forgot to put it
in the chart.

433
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:28,695
You want to solve
a problem in the records

434
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,969
by creating another
problem in the records?

435
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:32,100
There's no problem
with the records,

436
00:23:32,177 --> 00:23:33,906
there's a problem
with my recordkeeping.

437
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,844
There's no way anyone
can prove me wrong.

438
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,382
How did you get
access to the statins?

439
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,475
You gonna get someone
in the pharmacy to confess

440
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,020
to yet another
recordkeeping problem?

441
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,648
I saw an open cart.
I just took it.

442
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,318
Why would you steal a drug
you can just as easily ask for?

443
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:51,385
'Cause I'm trying
to get you off the hook.

444
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,088
A story that raises more
questions than it answers

445
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:57,033
only puts the hook
deeper down my throat.

446
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,763
It's all right.
I'll handle it.

447
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,228
How?

448
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,339
By telling the truth.

449
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,034
The truth is,
I don't have the time,

450
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,077
I'm not in the mood,
and I don't see the point.

451
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,612
You don't want to do the M&M
because you're not in the mood?

452
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,669
This kid is dying,

453
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,342
and I've got House trying to push
all his responsibilities onto me.

454
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,011
They're not his
responsibilities, they're yours.

455
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,348
You're the one who
wanted to be in charge.

456
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,855
I wanted to be in
charge, not a figurehead.

457
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,915
Then do the M&M,
it's all yours.

458
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,892
You want me to get
flogged? For what?

459
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,428
So you can have
an academic debate

460
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:28,159
about a diagnostic dilemma no
one's ever gonna face again?

461
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,729
What the hell's
going on here?

462
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,067
I just don't want
to do the M&M.

463
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,466
Did it work?

464
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,704
Not even close.

465
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,992
Everything okay?

466
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:01,430
Just waiting for whatever
is about to go wrong.

467
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,660
Thirteen called.

468
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:05,726
She have a theory that makes more
sense than abdominal epilepsy?

469
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:08,329
She said someone hacked
into her e-mail account

470
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:11,068
and canceled her
airline reservation.

471
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:12,473
I'm guessing Foreman.

472
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:13,568
Really?

473
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:17,175
You're accusing Foreman,
not me. Cool.

474
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,977
You really want Foreman to
stay in charge of the team?

475
00:25:22,053 --> 00:25:23,645
Makes sense.

476
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,384
He loves power,
I love puzzles.

477
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,485
You love power
and puzzles.

478
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,287
True.

479
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:34,757
And when I had them both...

480
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:41,666
It wasn't Foreman.

481
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,765
How do you know?

482
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,207
He said he's moved on.

483
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,177
And you believe him?

484
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,305
I believe that
he believes him.

485
00:25:56,755 --> 00:26:00,054
Looks like it's time for
me to get off the bench.

486
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,130
What's up?

487
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:10,528
Are you Dr. House?

488
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,331
I understand
you're a big fan.

489
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,565
I'll have my guy send
over a signed glossy.

490
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,666
Continuous EEG shows no interictal
spikes. It's not abdominal epilepsy.

491
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,335
You paged me to tell me what it's not?

492
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,040
I paged you
to show you this.

493
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,742
That, I did not expect.

494
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,186
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

495
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,884
Darn it. I knew
I should've stayed outside.

496
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:35,722
The fantasy is always much
better than the reality.

497
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,785
You think this is a joke?
That's my son.

498
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:42,390
He's dying, and not one of you
seem to have the slightest clue why.

499
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,630
I know. That's why
it's so interesting.

500
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:52,268
Fever, stomach pain, seizures,

501
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:56,212
peritoneal and subdural fluid
collection and now spots.

502
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,306
Could be an allergic
reaction to one of his meds.

503
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,216
That suddenly developed eight
hours after he started the meds?

504
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,584
If it's not cancer or infection,
it has to be autoimmune.

505
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:06,123
Systemic lupus complicated
by a CNS vasculitis

506
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,887
would explain the rash,
fever, ascites...

507
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,793
CNS vasculitis would cause a
stiff neck along with the headache.

508
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,661
And would've showed up
on the dural biopsy.

509
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,825
What about polyarteritis
nodosa? It can occur in kids.

510
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,633
Except you can't have
arteritis without inflammation.

511
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:24,436
Okay, you come up
with something better.

512
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,003
Go on.

513
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,979
There was some inflammation
in the skin biopsy.

514
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:32,983
Plus he's got elevated
diastolic pressure.

515
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:34,518
It's barely elevated,

516
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,020
which you'd expect given the
number of procedures he's undergone.

517
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,750
Well, barely is more
than not barely.

518
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:45,056
Not my decision.

519
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,563
But if it was, I'd say
start him on prednisone

520
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:50,601
and get a testicular biopsy.

521
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,335
If he's gonna have any real
inflammation, it'll be down there.

522
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:54,497
Cameron and I will do it.

523
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,665
Why? It was Chase's idea.

524
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:59,437
Kid's father is not gonna be happy
about a fourth set of biopsies,

525
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,979
and you've got
a better rapport.

526
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,345
What's really
going on here?

527
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,013
You need Chase to help
you over-prep for the M&M?

528
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,211
Yes.

529
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,486
Then say so,
don't be a child.

530
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,387
Is it on his penis?

531
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,323
The kid's rash?

532
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,795
Yeah, why?

533
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,231
Means it's most likely affecting
the small blood vessels.

534
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:27,032
That's why we didn't see any
inflammation on the biopsies.

535
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,541
It's not polyarteritis,
it's Degos disease.

536
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:40,250
I'll do it.

537
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,660
Your son has Degos disease.

538
00:28:57,602 --> 00:29:00,002
It causes micro-blood
vessels in the brain,

539
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,837
skin, and GI tract to
break down, clot off.

540
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:11,481
It sometimes manifests early on
with atrophic papules on the penis.

541
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:16,009
In your son's case, we don't know
why, but they came much later.

542
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,952
What's the treatment?

543
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:23,885
There isn't one.

544
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,919
It's incurable.

545
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:33,827
You're wrong.

546
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,998
You've already been
wrong a bunch of times.

547
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,709
We rechecked the biopsies.
It's definitely Degos.

548
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,618
I'm sorry. I wish there
was something we could do.

549
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:57,592
How long?

550
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,524
Not much longer.

551
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,598
What does that mean?

552
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:07,432
A day at the most.

553
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:53,512
All right. Great.

554
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,212
We need to talk.

555
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,151
Unless it's life or death,
it's gonna have to wait.

556
00:30:57,222 --> 00:30:58,985
It's about Dibala.

557
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,888
Let me rephrase,
unless it's a current...

558
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,621
Foreman can't present
the case at the M&M.

559
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:08,058
I know you guys are busy, but he's just
gonna have to suck it up and make the time.

560
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,121
It's not the time.

561
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,690
Then what is it?

562
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,566
The anticentromere
antibodies test,

563
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,538
the test that caused us
to change the treatment

564
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:20,840
from blastomycosis
to scleroderma, it wasn't...

565
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:23,173
It wasn't what?

566
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:27,117
Dr. Cuddy, they need
you in the Pediatric ICU.

567
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,675
Who's they?
I don't know,

568
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:31,016
but I think
they're lawyers.

569
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,551
If you guys screwed
something up, just come clean.

570
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:39,790
It's not gonna be that bad.

571
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,160
With all due respect, you
don't know what's at stake here.

572
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,067
What's going on?
You need to stop him.

573
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,230
He's about to
ruin his life.

574
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:49,739
Like you give a damn
about my life.

575
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:51,001
Roy, he's right.

576
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,135
You're borrowing money to buy options
that are already out of the money.

577
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,043
Even you won't be able
to cover the losses.

578
00:31:56,114 --> 00:31:59,515
Your house, cars, bank
accounts, you'll lose everything.

579
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,245
That's the point.

580
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:06,813
The billionaire thinks that the gods
will treat him better if he's broke.

581
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,153
I suggested
he give it to me...

582
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,524
There has got to be
some sort of balance.

583
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:13,758
You can't have all the good fortune
in just one area of your life.

584
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,732
That's not how the
world's supposed to work.

585
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:18,268
Who said the world
was supposed to work?

586
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,826
Don't just wipe
everything out.

587
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:21,872
Put your assets
in a trust,

588
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,464
give it to a charity...
I can't get anything back.

589
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,771
He's insane.
He's irrational,

590
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,971
so are most people. Unfortunately,
it doesn't make them insane.

591
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:32,813
If he signs that paper, he's not
only gonna destroy his own life,

592
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:36,285
but the lives of thousands of people who
rely on this company to make a living.

593
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:38,117
If he is insane,
we will sue this hospital...

594
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:40,089
Mr. Randall,

595
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,496
I know you're upset, but you shouldn't
make a decision like this right now.

596
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,258
Give it some time.

597
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:50,296
My son doesn't
have any time.

598
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,769
Your son's dying from an
incurable disease, not bad karma.

599
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:56,773
No. He's not dying.

600
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,900
It's not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna let it.

601
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,104
Roy.

602
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,511
Please.

603
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:10,550
I'm sorry.
I can't let him die.

604
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,688
People don't get
what they deserve.

605
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:17,353
They just get what they get, and there's
nothing any of us can do about it.

606
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:29,906
Deliver it, or I'll make sure
you end up the ones with nothing.

607
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,551
Call a code.
He's flat-lining.

608
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,200
Thanks.

609
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:04,866
You're welcome.
For what?

610
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:08,770
For thinking I was worth
breaking the law to keep around.

611
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,579
That's just the way I am.

612
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:12,411
But still don't know
what you're talking about.

613
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:17,216
Cuddy had IT trace all the IP addresses
who've logged into my e-mail account.

614
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:20,621
There were two.
Mine and yours.

615
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,725
Obviously House decided he needs
you more than he's willing to...

616
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,354
I already asked House.

617
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:28,662
And he'd certainly
never lie.

618
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,169
No, he'd lie.
Except he wants me gone.

619
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:36,104
And he'd do a lot better job
of lying than you just did.

620
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,665
Really? It was that bad?

621
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,404
No, actually.

622
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:47,474
But it doesn't matter any more.
Why? Because of House or Foreman?

623
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:52,516
You're good for both of them,
but Foreman's not my best friend.

624
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,353
House will be fine.

625
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,024
Maybe.

626
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:58,392
But with you on the
team, he'd be better.

627
00:34:58,463 --> 00:35:03,127
He needs someone
who doesn't need him.

628
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:07,763
You're the only one he's never really been
able to suck into his crazy House vortex.

629
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,706
Keeps him grounded,
his ego in check.

630
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,242
Why didn't you
just come to me?

631
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:20,481
I figured you'd only stay if House
asked. And I knew he would, eventually.

632
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,555
Bye, Wilson.

633
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,691
This is a great job.

634
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,488
Maybe even better, now that
House is at least trying

635
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,033
to have real relationships
with people.

636
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,326
I said trying.

637
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:41,062
It doesn't matter.

638
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,403
The job you love
doesn't matter?

639
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,633
Don't throw it all away just
because of a bad breakup.

640
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:52,147
Bye, Wilson.

641
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,555
I just confessed.

642
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,632
I told Thirteen I was the one
who canceled the plane ticket.

643
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:09,723
Why?

644
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,064
You mean why did I confess,
or why did I do it?

645
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:15,367
I know you didn't do it,
so I guess the first.

646
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:20,342
You want her to stay because you want
her back, or because Foreman does?

647
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,643
Why would I care
what Foreman wants?

648
00:36:22,713 --> 00:36:25,477
Because you're not as big
a jerk as everyone thinks.

649
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,574
Yes, I am.

650
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:27,982
No, you're not.

651
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:32,454
I just made a $10,000 short sale
on a stock I know is gonna crash

652
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:36,152
because of what I saw a grief-stricken
dad do on his son's deathbed.

653
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,524
No, you didn't.

654
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:38,619
Yes, I did.

655
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,422
You are a jerk.

656
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,391
She's making a mistake.

657
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:45,799
So you did it for her?

658
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,360
She's a good doctor.

659
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,338
So you did it for you?

660
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,375
I'm not the one
in charge any more.

661
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,467
So you did it for Foreman?

662
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:57,241
She's a smoking-hot,
newly-single bisexual.

663
00:36:57,315 --> 00:37:00,079
Why don't you just admit that
you like having her around?

664
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:01,812
She's good for you.
You need her.

665
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,481
Because I was born with a
heart three sizes too small.

666
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,251
No, you weren't.
Yes, I...

667
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,650
What?

668
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,678
He still alive?

669
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,906
Yeah.

670
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:33,914
Good. Start him on heparin
and IV immunoglobulin.

671
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,577
For Degos?
The cardiac arrest

672
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,349
wasn't just an "everything goes
to hell in a hand basket" arrest.

673
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:40,913
It was a coronary event.
Coronaries are large vessels.

674
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,653
Means it can't be Degos.

675
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,819
But the biopsies
confirmed...

676
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,589
Obstructed
blood vessels.

677
00:37:45,663 --> 00:37:48,188
They can't be obstructed
because of Degos.

678
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,235
Means it's primary
antiphospholipid syndrome.

679
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:55,102
Are you sure?
Nope.

680
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,875
But I will be if he responds to
the heparin and immunoglobulin.

681
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,841
By the way,

682
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:09,010
someone screwed
over your girlfriend,

683
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:12,544
and she ran to me, Cuddy,
and Wilson, everyone but you.

684
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,388
She's not over you.

685
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,493
Or she is.

686
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,459
Where did you find it?

687
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,585
Find what?

688
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,526
Niacin-bound
chromium supplements.

689
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:58,396
It was right on top of the
file. You don't know about it?

690
00:38:58,469 --> 00:39:00,460
No, been here all night.

691
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,398
One of Dibala's previous docs
was prescribing ultra-high doses

692
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,137
of niacin-bound
chromium to boost his HDL.

693
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,405
So?

694
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,470
So, it gives us
something to point to.

695
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,346
We can explain the wide
variation between the HDL numbers.

696
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,079
We're safe. We're covered.

697
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,146
You really didn't
request the info?

698
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,549
No.

699
00:39:22,626 --> 00:39:24,958
And obviously
you didn't either,

700
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,021
which means...

701
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,534
It worked.

702
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:06,865
The medicine worked.

703
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,437
It worked.

704
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,686
How did you find it?

705
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,223
Fat, old, black guy.

706
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:35,421
I knew he had to be taking
something for his cholesterol.

707
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,989
And what now?

708
00:40:37,868 --> 00:40:39,733
I'm not the boss.

709
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,567
You don't think
I should be fired?

710
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:42,799
Why?

711
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:46,536
I doubt we'll ever be treating
a genocidal dictator again.

712
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,738
Better a murder
than a misdiagnosis.

713
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,848
Whether you want to be
in charge or not,

714
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,986
you are.

715
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,890
And you always will be.

716
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:22,711
75-year-old African man
presented to our hospital

717
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,578
following a rapid
onset of hemoptysis.

718
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,742
He had been fine
prior to onset.

719
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,015
No chest pain, fever,
coughing or chills.

720
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:34,724
He does note a
nine-hour plane flight...
