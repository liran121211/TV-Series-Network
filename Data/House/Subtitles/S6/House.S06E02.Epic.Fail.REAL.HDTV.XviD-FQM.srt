1
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:26,698
<i>I guess everybody else is dead...</i>

2
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:29,721
<i>which means
we're totally outnumbered.</i>

3
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:32,382
<i>We got to make up
for that in pure firepower.</i>

4
00:00:32,507 --> 00:00:34,592
<i>You want to raid
the feeding area, don't you?</i>

5
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:38,296
<i>Two boxes of grenades in there.
It's our only chance at getting out.</i>

6
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,305
<i>Vince, that place is a death trap.</i>

7
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:45,425
<i>Lucky for you,
I've got the mega-blaster.</i>

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,454
<i>Lee, you go right.
Roy, straight down the middle.</i>

9
00:00:49,634 --> 00:00:51,015
<i>I'll cover you both.</i>

10
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:08,380
<i>Where's that cover fire?</i>

11
00:01:09,901 --> 00:01:12,004
<i>Mega-blaster, dude.
Mega-blaster!</i>

12
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,879
<i>Got it.</i>

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,706
<i>Vince, where are you?</i>

14
00:01:23,202 --> 00:01:24,916
<i>I can't get them off of me!</i>

15
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:30,214
<i>Vince, you d-bag, where are you?</i>

16
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,860
<i>Damn it. Damn it.</i>

17
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:36,467
Damn it, Vince.

18
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:40,964
That blood look funny to you?

19
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:43,766
Still working on it.
The code's a little janky.

20
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:47,294
Hey, boss, you just like watching us
get our asses shredded?

21
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:51,297
Yeah, not that you're not hilarious,
but we hit the shelves in three months.

22
00:01:57,488 --> 00:01:58,884
Vince, what's wrong?

23
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:02,027
My hands.

24
00:02:02,803 --> 00:02:04,103
They're on fire.

25
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,290
Your NCV test was normal.
Rules out carpal tunnel.

26
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:49,059
No evidence of trauma.
Your blood work looks normal.

27
00:02:49,184 --> 00:02:51,123
- Then what is it?
- I don't know.

28
00:02:51,248 --> 00:02:53,839
- I'll transfer you to a neurologist.
- A neurologist?

29
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,926
Don't you have some famous
diagnostics guy? What's he doing?

30
00:02:57,874 --> 00:02:58,874
I quit.

31
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:08,354
You can't quit.

32
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,689
You're confusing me
with Jake Gyllenhaal.

33
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,376
- House, are you okay?
- Yeah,

34
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:14,026
and I want to stay that way.

35
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:17,732
Talked it over with my therapist. I need
to change my environment, my habits.

36
00:03:17,857 --> 00:03:19,653
But he cleared you
to get your license back.

37
00:03:19,778 --> 00:03:22,117
Which will help immensely
with my new job in research.

38
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,696
I've sent out some resumes.

39
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:26,007
Research means no patients,
less pressure.

40
00:03:26,132 --> 00:03:27,375
You just got out.

41
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,500
Have you had enough time
to think this through?

42
00:03:32,882 --> 00:03:33,882
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,392
I know this will affect
both of you...

44
00:03:37,821 --> 00:03:39,071
and Thirteen...

45
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:41,245
and the one with the nose.

46
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,776
I just can't risk coming back here.

47
00:04:01,663 --> 00:04:02,741
That was surprising.

48
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,775
I want to run the department.

49
00:04:13,397 --> 00:04:15,765
You consider waiting
until House clears the lobby

50
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,516
before you start angling
for his job?

51
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:20,470
He's not dead or sentimental
and somebody needs to do it.

52
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:21,594
Not necessarily.

53
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,831
Departments of diagnostic
medicine don't exist.

54
00:04:24,956 --> 00:04:27,547
The only reason we have one
is because of House.

55
00:04:27,672 --> 00:04:30,519
You reassigned us,
kept us on payroll for three months.

56
00:04:30,838 --> 00:04:33,147
- You might as well give me a chance.
- You're a great doctor.

57
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,857
I want you to stay on in neuro.

58
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:36,054
But House...

59
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:39,146
- was a genius.
- House was an egotistical,

60
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,113
pill-popping lawsuit magnet...

61
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:43,699
and a genius.

62
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,159
And I worked with him
longer than anybody else.

63
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,850
I can do this.

64
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,518
You get one shot.

65
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,276
What's House gonna do?

66
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,134
No idea, but he's gone.

67
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,709
So how about we focus
on the medicine?

68
00:05:06,384 --> 00:05:07,097
What?

69
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:09,600
You're the boss.
It's kind of sexy.

70
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:11,999
Here I thought
it was just the pants.

71
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,896
Diabetic neuropathy?

72
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,524
HBA1C looks fine.

73
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:19,944
- Could be hypothyroidism.
- No fatigue or weight gain.

74
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:23,095
- Complex regional pain syndrome?
- That's a good idea.

75
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,823
Let's run with it.
Look at that.

76
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,533
- No House, the job still gets done.
- And yet something's missing.

77
00:05:27,658 --> 00:05:29,909
I'm short. He's black.
You're gay-ish.

78
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,534
- That's it.
- Treat for CRPS.

79
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:34,960
Prep the patient
for spinal stimulation.

80
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:41,204
- I don't buy it.
- CRPS isn't that well understood...

81
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,037
I think it's mercury poisoning.
I eat a ton of sushi.

82
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:47,478
You're currently getting mixed reviews
in <i>Speed-the-Plow</i> on Broadway.

83
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:49,246
Google it.

84
00:05:49,371 --> 00:05:52,046
It's pretty hard to consume enough fish
to give yourself mercury poisoning,

85
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:54,090
and it doesn't usually present
solely with pain.

86
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:57,103
But it can.
Check out <i>The Atlantic Medical Journal</i>.

87
00:05:57,228 --> 00:05:58,857
This guy came in with burning pain

88
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,164
caused by...

89
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:03,487
"erythromelalgia"
caused by mercury poisoning.

90
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,916
- Who needs doctors with the Internet?
- No offense, but doctors make mistakes.

91
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,784
Medical errors are up 30% this year.

92
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,743
You should check the rate
of patient error.

93
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:13,642
There's a ton
of information out there.

94
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,832
Why wouldn't I educate myself,
be my own advocate?

95
00:06:16,394 --> 00:06:18,127
CRPS came up in my search too.

96
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,045
But I've never had
any skin discoloration,

97
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,088
and my pain is sporadic
and not constant.

98
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:25,718
It's got to be worth
one lousy blood test.

99
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:03,964
You know how House feels
about people touching his ball.

100
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,258
Chase refuses to tell me.

101
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,886
Right.
My husband's gay. Witty.

102
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:11,449
I hear you're taking over for House.

103
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:12,824
You're gonna be great.

104
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:13,974
Congratulations.

105
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:18,186
- Not permanent.
- Yet. Taub and Thirteen cool with it?

106
00:07:19,076 --> 00:07:21,065
He's older than you.
She's seen you naked.

107
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:23,431
Not like we haven't been
working together for 2 years now.

108
00:07:23,556 --> 00:07:26,361
Working with is different
than working for.

109
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,864
You saw House.

110
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:31,075
- How was he?
- He was...

111
00:07:32,382 --> 00:07:33,202
good.

112
00:07:33,366 --> 00:07:35,268
He was honest, took responsibility.

113
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:37,423
It was kind of weird.

114
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,625
Is Thirteen around?

115
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:42,041
I need her to sign off
on her E.R. transfer.

116
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,443
She and Taub are doing
a spinal stimulation.

117
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:45,547
No, they're not.

118
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:48,161
I just dropped a patient
in the cath suite,

119
00:07:48,286 --> 00:07:50,253
and your guys were not in there.

120
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:58,584
Usually spinal stimulation
is done with the patient in the room.

121
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,833
He asked us to test his blood
for mercury.

122
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,773
It's unlikely, but not impossible.

123
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,608
- We disagreed.
- Testing doesn't hurt.

124
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:06,835
It only takes 20 minutes.
I figured it didn't matter.

125
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,363
I'm thinking
I should decide when it matters.

126
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,573
If you're done
marking your territory...

127
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,077
Test results.
Surprise, surprise.

128
00:08:15,672 --> 00:08:17,287
Marcus Webly was wrong.

129
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:19,627
I'll handle this.

130
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:26,046
You expected
not to have mixed feelings?

131
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:29,874
I know it's the right call.

132
00:08:31,457 --> 00:08:34,096
Just don't know what to do
with my time. And my leg...

133
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:36,405
Pain's flared up
since I left Mayfield.

134
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,909
Ibuprofen's barely putting
a dent in it.

135
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,728
- You need a hobby.
- Right.

136
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:45,156
Doctors treat chronic pain
with collections of Hummel figurines.

137
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:47,234
No, I didn't say
you need a lame hobby.

138
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,777
You need something
to keep you engaged,

139
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:53,033
- connected to other people.
- You already made me get a roommate.

140
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,659
Wilson's got one bedroom.
We can't get any more connected

141
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:57,100
without unzipping.

142
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:00,497
So what does Wilson like to do?

143
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:07,661
Vince, I'm Dr. Foreman,
head of diagnostics.

144
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:09,977
So you must be
the genius' replacement.

145
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:12,532
I prefer to think of myself
as genius 2.0.

146
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,344
Your tests ruled out poisoning.

147
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:16,138
- What was my mercury level?
- 2.8.

148
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,182
- That means for every deciliter...
- I know.

149
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:19,855
I also know it's above normal.

150
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,393
I want mercury chelation.

151
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:24,771
Your level isn't elevated enough
to produce your symptoms.

152
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,399
You can't know until we de-elevate it
and see if my pain improves.

153
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,963
It's a judgment call.

154
00:09:29,254 --> 00:09:31,069
Based on ten years
of medical training?

155
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:34,294
I think you have CRPS.
I want to try spinal stimulation.

156
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:36,701
So, basically, you want
to shove a needle in my spine

157
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,676
based on a glorified hunch.

158
00:09:39,486 --> 00:09:41,315
I'll stick with the chelation.

159
00:09:43,395 --> 00:09:46,251
If you don't want to get better,
I think we're done.

160
00:09:47,113 --> 00:09:48,813
What do you mean "done"?

161
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:51,340
You're not interested
in my medical opinion.

162
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,008
I'll move on to my next patient.

163
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,846
You'll move on to a doctor
willing to run all the unnecessary tests

164
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,314
and procedures you want.

165
00:09:57,865 --> 00:09:59,640
Or you can stick around
and be cured.

166
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,338
Makes no difference to me.

167
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:07,646
I'm glad you changed your mind.

168
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,316
Don't know.

169
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,684
Dr. Foreman basically
strong-armed me,

170
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,240
which is impressive.

171
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,406
Stimulating at 100 hertz.

172
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:19,824
Guess you found him a little more
persuasive than two of us...

173
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:21,654
probably the pants.

174
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,679
He reminds me of me.

175
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:27,626
- Is it supposed to hurt?
- Not if we're in correctly.

176
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,555
Is it your hands?
Your back?

177
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,945
No, my chest.

178
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:33,629
Can't breathe.

179
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:35,759
Heart rate's 140, climbing.

180
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,713
You need to hold still.

181
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:39,544
What did you... do?

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,391
Deep breaths.

183
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,230
His lungs are filling with fluid.

184
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:51,208
Analysis of the fluid
from Vince's lungs

185
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,378
shows the lung problem
is really a heart problem.

186
00:10:53,503 --> 00:10:55,440
He's got a thickened left ventricle.

187
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:57,128
When his heart sped up,

188
00:10:57,253 --> 00:11:00,585
it jacked up the pressure in his lungs,
causing pulmonary edema.

189
00:11:00,878 --> 00:11:03,234
Good thing I talked the patient
into spinal stimulation.

190
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,129
It did lead us
to discovering a new symptom

191
00:11:05,254 --> 00:11:06,830
and proved he wasn't poisoning.

192
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:10,210
We lucked into that discovery,
and we were wrong about CRPS.

193
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:14,172
Ventricular thickening plus neuropathy
could equal lyme disease.

194
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,632
Not without joint pain.

195
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,217
When is his new game coming out?

196
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,594
- Couple months.
- He's probably working nonstop.

197
00:11:19,883 --> 00:11:21,638
Might be using more than coffee.

198
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,348
Cocaine use explains the symptoms.

199
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,559
So we search his office for drugs.

200
00:11:27,008 --> 00:11:28,508
We're gonna ask him.

201
00:11:32,898 --> 00:11:35,582
In a lot of ways,
cooking is like music.

202
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,137
Different elements combine
to make a symphony.

203
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:43,657
Difference is that Beethoven's <i>5th</i>
isn't gonna be poop tomorrow.

204
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,455
What was my one condition
for allowing you

205
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:47,780
to tag along?

206
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:49,332
Try not to be a jerk.

207
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:50,595
I'm trying.

208
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,991
I'm just failing.

209
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:55,018
Roll your meatballs
and keep an open mind.

210
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:02,262
How hard are you trying not
to make a ball joke right now?

211
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,513
They're smoking.

212
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:06,127
Your balls.

213
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,980
- They're browning way too fast.
- Blue, you got to watch out for.

214
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,148
Enough.

215
00:12:14,031 --> 00:12:16,359
My God, they're...
They're still raw inside.

216
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:18,571
They're cooked through,
the outside will be burned.

217
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,634
There's a medicated powder for that.

218
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:24,631
Although...

219
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,367
vinegar could work.

220
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:29,790
My o-chem prof talked about how,

221
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,023
theoretically, you shouldn't trust
the results of a hemoglobin A1C test

222
00:12:33,148 --> 00:12:34,878
on a chronically acidotic patient.

223
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:37,775
The acid in the blood
slows the reaction

224
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,591
between the hemoglobin protein
and blood sugar.

225
00:12:40,903 --> 00:12:42,837
Browning meat
is the same chemical process,

226
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:45,514
which means, it should also
be slowed by acid.

227
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,109
That actually makes sense.

228
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,874
You might've...

229
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,338
saved my balls.

230
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:53,969
That's the spirit.

231
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:57,984
Obviously, the procedure
didn't go as planned.

232
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:00,779
The heart problem was unforeseeable,
but I still feel responsible.

233
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:02,216
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,416
How long you guys been doing it?

235
00:13:07,033 --> 00:13:09,470
I think it's best
if we kept things professional.

236
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:12,219
Tough to do now that I've seen you rock
a leopard-print bikini.

237
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:13,898
Congrats, by the way.
Up top.

238
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,260
You hacked my profile?

239
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:19,214
Your treatment nearly gave me
a heart attack.

240
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,883
Figured I'd check if you had
the credentials to go with the <i>cojones</i>.

241
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,303
One search led to another. Is there
a shot of just her? Screen saver.

242
00:13:25,677 --> 00:13:27,986
We need to know
if you've been using cocaine.

243
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,725
Dude, you just block everybody,
or do you really only have 3 friends?

244
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,562
We need you to be straight with us.
We need to be able to trust you.

245
00:13:35,443 --> 00:13:37,527
I cleaned up my act 12 years ago...

246
00:13:38,755 --> 00:13:40,724
after my college roommate O.D.'d.

247
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:53,752
Search his office.

248
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:56,573
- You think he was lying?
- No. But I'm not sure.

249
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:59,288
It was worth asking. If he'd have
said yes, it would've saved us a trip.

250
00:13:59,413 --> 00:14:00,613
But he didn't.

251
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:04,202
You have to forget about him.

252
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:06,027
- The patient?
- House.

253
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:08,483
First, you try acting like him.
That doesn't work.

254
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,048
So then you try the opposite.

255
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:12,904
Now you're mad because you have
to use his move.

256
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:15,717
I feel like Tom Brady's backup.

257
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:18,392
Tom Brady's backup
now makes $10 million.

258
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:19,767
Stop comparing.

259
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:22,216
You can do this by being you.

260
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:25,801
We should still check out
his office, talk to his coworkers.

261
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:27,144
I'll get Taub.

262
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,326
And...

263
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:30,335
thanks.

264
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,334
- And dinner tonight at 7:00.
- Can we make it 8:00?

265
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:36,124
Already made a reservation for 7:00.

266
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:44,722
I'm making gnocchi.

267
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:51,503
I didn't mean to intrude.
I just...

268
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:53,726
Cecile's in my cooking class.

269
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,261
She doesn't speak English.

270
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,218


271
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,050


272
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:06,029
If you bake the potatoes instead
of boiling them, it's less moisture,

273
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:08,277
fewer gluten bonds, lighter gnocchi.

274
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:09,574
You seem good.

275
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:10,802
Feeling better.

276
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,721


277
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:14,879


278
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,499


279
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,655
House, I need to talk to you
about your leaving the hospital.

280
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:23,297
I do love a good groveling,
but my decision is final.

281
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,489
That's fine

282
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:26,532
as long
as I'm not the reason for it.

283
00:15:26,657 --> 00:15:28,825
I know that sounds
completely narcissistic, but...

284
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:32,429
But it's not.

285
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:34,266
We flirted. We kissed.

286
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:35,596
I fondled.

287
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,718
I hallucinated a night with you
and yelled it from a hospital balcony.

288
00:15:40,312 --> 00:15:41,605
You're not a narcissist.

289
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:43,525
So what am I?

290
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,627
Not the reason I'm leaving.

291
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,161
I'm gonna miss you.

292
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,707
Lady, either kiss him or leave.

293
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,438
We got work to do.

294
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:04,337
- You just couldn't keep your trap shut.
- Make the damn gnocchi.

295
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,839
<i>I guess you're not in a hurry
to get back to the office.</i>

296
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:18,018
<i>And you are?</i>

297
00:16:24,099 --> 00:16:26,499
I'm not trying
to avoid my boyfriend.

298
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,159
<i>I'm a lizard.
Not an idiot.</i>

299
00:16:29,973 --> 00:16:32,034
You've been in a crappy mood
since we got in the car.

300
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,285
And you're completely okay
with being ordered around

301
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,380
by someone who 24 hours ago
was basically your equal?

302
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:40,248
Unlike you,
I didn't expect anything different.

303
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:43,168
The work part, I can get used to.

304
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:45,211
He didn't ask me to go to dinner.

305
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,075
<i>He told me we were going.</i>

306
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:51,870
- He's never done that before.
- So even the score.

307
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,261
Go home tonight,

308
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,246
<i>put on some heels, and break him
like a pony. You'll feel much better.</i>

309
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:58,708
What?

310
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,144
That's one...

311
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:03,759
<i>big-ass bird.</i>

312
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:13,762
<i>It's kind of amazing.</i>

313
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,076
The way the wings move,
it's so real.

314
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,544
<i>Get them off me!</i>

315
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,107
I know what's wrong with the patient.
I'm going to call Foreman.

316
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:25,735
Little help.

317
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:30,330
Your partner said you studied birds
to improve the game animation.

318
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:32,581
- Did you touch them?
- Can't dissect without touching.

319
00:17:32,706 --> 00:17:35,553
- The way to understand the anatomy.
- A good way to contract an infection

320
00:17:35,678 --> 00:17:36,893
called psittacosis.

321
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:39,516
We spoke to Dr. Foreman.
He wants to start you on antibiotics.

322
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:42,291
Does that infection
cause problems in the...

323
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,812
joystick area?

324
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,129
- I'm kind of stuck in play mode.
- Yes, we get it.

325
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:49,234
- She's very, very pretty.
- It's not her.

326
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,890
I mean, it was...

327
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:53,363
when she was here
with her boyfriend 3 hours ago.

328
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,241
You've had an erection
for three hours?

329
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,537
At first, it was embarrassing,
but now it's starting to hurt.

330
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,346
- Will the antibiotics help?
- I'm afraid not.

331
00:18:03,471 --> 00:18:05,063
This isn't psittacosis. 

332
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:10,505
His erection persisted
even with medication.

333
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:13,134
We had to put in a surgical shunt
just to drain the blood.

334
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,260
You missed dinner.
And a shunt

335
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,678
- doesn't require both of you.
- I'm dedicated.

336
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:20,294
So the holy trinity:
heart, hands, hose.

337
00:18:20,419 --> 00:18:23,678
- Could be Guillain-Barre.
- Not with normal nerve conduction.

338
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:25,353
Thrombocytosis.

339
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:27,234
His platelet count isn't that high.

340
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,138
Brain tumor makes more sense.

341
00:18:31,047 --> 00:18:33,297
I'm sorry.
I just realized...

342
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:35,282
joint pain and joint pain.

343
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,159
Honest, I wasn't laughing
because of the obvious tension

344
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,737
between the two of you.

345
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,126
Erection points to a circulatory
problem. I'm with Foreman.

346
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:47,041
It is possible
for a brain tumor to cause...

347
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,924
We're going with thrombocytosis.

348
00:18:54,793 --> 00:18:56,555
You're mad I didn't ask you
to dinner?

349
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,116
- How long have we been dating?
- It felt like an order.

350
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,367
- Your tone of voice was...
- My tone?

351
00:19:01,492 --> 00:19:03,680
I'm under pressure now.
How about giving me a break?

352
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:05,396
This is tough for both of us,

353
00:19:05,521 --> 00:19:07,414
except I haven't just gotten
a promotion.

354
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:09,181
So now you're jealous.

355
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:10,995
No. I'm just saying don't complain

356
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,526
about the burdens of command
to your employees.

357
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:15,877
I was complaining to my girlfriend.

358
00:19:17,155 --> 00:19:18,490
Who are those guys?

359
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:20,622
I have no idea.

360
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:27,655
Meet the competition.

361
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,709
Steve Paulson.
Neurology, st. Mark's.

362
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:32,219
- Nice to meet you.
- You called another doctor?

363
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:34,798
Lots of other doctors.
Posted my symptoms on the internet.

364
00:19:35,312 --> 00:19:37,500
You guys are 0 for 2.
I thought I'd look for some backup.

365
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,177
I can cure all your symptoms
with my papaya toxin cleanse.

366
00:19:40,302 --> 00:19:42,200
Month's supply, $395.

367
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,056
That guy's an idiot.
Doesn't mean they all are.

368
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,545
Neither one of you have
privileges at this hospital.

369
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,728
Please leave...

370
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,397
Now.

371
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,691
Dr. Foreman,
sorry for the intrusion,

372
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,361
but, I noticed
you haven't done a head MRI yet.

373
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,822
- He doesn't need one.
- I'm sure he's got a brain tumor.

374
00:19:59,255 --> 00:20:02,146
We considered that and concluded
Thrombocytosis is more likely.

375
00:20:02,271 --> 00:20:03,993
I'm starting him on Hydroxyurea.

376
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,246
His platelets don't seem
anywhere near high enough.

377
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:09,624
- If you took an image, I'm sure you...
- There are no signs of increased ICP.

378
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,838
- I'm not delaying treatment.
- We need a tiebreaker.

379
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:13,963
Dr. Hadley, what do you think?

380
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:17,549
I think both theories have merit.

381
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,302
So brain tumor, otherwise
you'd back your boss/boyfriend.

382
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:23,436
I want an MRI.

383
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,210
Fine.
I'll set it up.

384
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:37,972
Great. You're up.

385
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:39,397
I need a taster.

386
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:42,073
Ragout with pork sausage,

387
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,791
beef thigh, no cream.

388
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:48,936
It's a little early.

389
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,971
- Did you even go to bed last night?
- Bed is for sissies,

390
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,085
unless you're having sex,
in which case...

391
00:21:02,452 --> 00:21:04,137
No, bed is still for sissies.

392
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:06,905
Doesn't this seem
a little bit obsessive?

393
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,100
Should've been here
when I was butchering the ox.

394
00:21:09,472 --> 00:21:12,312
What do you expect? I'm an addict.
I turn everything up to eleven.

395
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,532
I thought you were trying
to tone that down.

396
00:21:14,657 --> 00:21:17,129
I was trying to find something
I could set at 11

397
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:20,312
without blowing out my eardrums.
Star anise with caramelized onions.

398
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,989
The sulfur compounds
bring out the meat flavor.

399
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:28,687
I couldn't sleep because of my leg.

400
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,749
It was either make ragout or go out
on the street looking to score.

401
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:38,588
Good choice.

402
00:21:39,095 --> 00:21:41,382
So, so good.

403
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,998
- He asked me a question, I answered.
- You told me to make my own decisions.

404
00:21:53,123 --> 00:21:55,939
- I do, and you stab me in the back.
- I didn't say what I really thought.

405
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,267
I hedged, and I don't like
that I hedged.

406
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:01,194
- If I have a legitimate opinion...
- Express it in private.

407
00:22:01,535 --> 00:22:03,797
In public, the team opinion
is your opinion.

408
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,115
Except the team opinion
is <i>your</i> opinion.

409
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:08,701
- That's my job.
- And what's mine,

410
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:11,175
to lie when I'm asked
a direct question?

411
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:16,167
You would've done it for House.
Maybe you just don't want me to succeed.

412
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:20,087
Maybe you just want to kick me again
for not asking you to dinner.

413
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:23,287
At least when House
was being an unbelievable jerk,

414
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:25,228
I could talk
to my boyfriend about it.

415
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:27,553
I may be a jerk, but you're wrong.

416
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:29,136
MRI is clean.

417
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:32,225
Treat him for trombocytosis.

418
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:39,658
You're early.

419
00:22:41,075 --> 00:22:42,167
For what?

420
00:22:42,464 --> 00:22:45,312
I knew you'd show up here
complaining about Foreman.

421
00:22:45,608 --> 00:22:48,202
Thought you'd hold out
for another week at least.

422
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:50,717
I showed up to ask
if you've seen thrombocytosis

423
00:22:50,842 --> 00:22:54,187
- with a platelet count, under...
- I went crazy, not stupid.

424
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:58,209
I leave, Foreman embraces
his inner mugabe.

425
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:02,255
- What's that?
- Embryonali... unhatched chicken egg.

426
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:06,634
I'm gonna suck out some of the yolk
and replace it with ragout.

427
00:23:07,023 --> 00:23:10,930
You can tell the other lepers
that their absence has been noted.

428
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:13,768
- Cameron didn't come by?
- Daddy's little co-dependent

429
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,193
is all grown up.

430
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:19,464
Making room for daddy's hot bisexual
with boyfriend problems.

431
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:21,748
It's not a problem.
It's...

432
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,486
OK, it's a problem.

433
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:28,464
I mean, I get it.
The patient's a nightmare.

434
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:32,076
He posted his case online.
It... you know Foreman.

435
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,619
You know the situation.

436
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:37,343
- How can I get him to tone it down?
- Stop being a coward for one thing.

437
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:40,074
- He's afraid of failure.
- At a job that no one before me

438
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:43,182
has ever done.
His fears are justified.

439
00:23:43,503 --> 00:23:46,461
You're afraid of giving him control
over you, which might work at home.

440
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:50,200
It makes it almost impossible for him
to do his job. Pass me those crackers.

441
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,281
You're saying this is all my fault?

442
00:23:54,406 --> 00:23:55,556
I'm saying...

443
00:23:56,891 --> 00:23:59,687
that you would be happier if you learned
when it's OK to give in.

444
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:04,981
- What?
- You just suggested that I give in

445
00:24:05,106 --> 00:24:06,756
so that I can be happy.

446
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:09,084
What did they do to you in there?

447
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:10,349
Taste this.

448
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,377
Good.

449
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:29,452
This might be the best thing
I've ever eaten.

450
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,513
And, yes, I'm including
what you're thinking of now.

451
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,006
You are an amazing cook!

452
00:24:37,614 --> 00:24:38,614
I know.

453
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,523
And yet, my leg hurts.

454
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:48,018
- Fire her.
- I'm not gonna fire her.

455
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,486
- Then stop being such a wuss.
- I'm not being a wuss.

456
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:52,600
Challenging you is part of her job.

457
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,586
But when she does it,
you take it personally.

458
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:56,961
So you're saying this is my fault?

459
00:24:57,256 --> 00:24:59,618
I was trying to bury it
a little, but, yeah.

460
00:24:59,743 --> 00:25:02,428
You got to eliminate
either the challenge or the reaction.

461
00:25:02,553 --> 00:25:04,961
Or we could stick
with my original plan.

462
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,436
We get drunk
and talk about how girls are lame.

463
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:11,964
This problem will go away
on its own.

464
00:25:20,932 --> 00:25:22,732
It's 8:00 in the morning.

465
00:25:22,857 --> 00:25:24,207
Coffee ice cream.

466
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:27,768
No frittata?
No bombolini?

467
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,803
Started thinking
about what you said, about me obsessing.

468
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,950
Started obsessing about obsessing.

469
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,658
- Decided to take a day off.
- You were enjoying cooking.

470
00:25:37,124 --> 00:25:39,325
How like a man to think that I enjoy

471
00:25:39,542 --> 00:25:42,540
slaving over a hot stove all day
while you're off banging secretaries.

472
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,967
You said it was keeping
your mind off the pain.

473
00:25:45,092 --> 00:25:48,107
That was before I discovered
the biggest loser marathon on cable.

474
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,994
I like to pretend
they can see me eating.

475
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:53,926
And your leg?

476
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:55,553
It's fine.

477
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:01,642
My leg's killing me.

478
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,483
Cooking helped for a while.

479
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:05,938
I guess I got bored.

480
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,449
My leg started hurting again.

481
00:26:07,574 --> 00:26:09,525
Then I got worried,
and that made the pain worse.

482
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:13,409
- What are you worried about?
- That nothing's gonna help.

483
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,305
That I end up
in the very dark place.

484
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:20,192
I'm fine...

485
00:26:21,842 --> 00:26:23,540
- just not happy.
- I didn't let you out

486
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,684
because you were happy.
But, because I believe

487
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:27,673
you had the skills
to cope with that.

488
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:29,712
You tried one thing.
It didn't work.

489
00:26:29,837 --> 00:26:30,887
So move on.

490
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:34,634
- Write. Play chess.
- What if nothing works?

491
00:26:34,948 --> 00:26:37,469
What if nothing gives me more
than a few days before my brain

492
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:39,129
starts looking for the next fix,

493
00:26:39,254 --> 00:26:41,933
before my leg feels like
someone's shoving nails into it?

494
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,458
What do I do then?

495
00:26:44,223 --> 00:26:47,123
If nothing in the world
can hold your interest,

496
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:50,489
We'll deal with that
when we get to it.

497
00:26:50,614 --> 00:26:53,814
But you have to trust me,
and you have to be patient.

498
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:01,125
I brought you a doughnut.

499
00:27:02,198 --> 00:27:03,848
The florist was closed.

500
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:07,439
I'll get a vase and put it in water.

501
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,016
You know I'm sorry, right?

502
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,640
I'm sorry too.

503
00:27:18,248 --> 00:27:19,498
Do you think...

504
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,507
we could start over?

505
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:25,685
That's a fantastic idea.

506
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:33,823
We're gonna be late.
Your boss won't mind.

507
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:40,419
No way.

508
00:27:43,817 --> 00:27:46,622
His lymph nodes blew up.
He's been treated for thrombocytosis,

509
00:27:46,747 --> 00:27:48,190
but there's been no change.

510
00:27:48,315 --> 00:27:50,584
I was wrong.
God, you are a genius.

511
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,250
- I'm adding this to my list.
- That didn't work last time.

512
00:27:53,375 --> 00:27:55,126
Because I didn't think big enough.

513
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,281
Now, I'm offering
a 25 000 dollars reward.

514
00:28:48,178 --> 00:28:50,036
Steroids reduced
his facial swelling.

515
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:52,328
Swollen lymph nodes
rule out thrombocytosis.

516
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:54,480
How did so many people
get my personal email?

517
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:56,442
Internet is a magical place.

518
00:28:57,568 --> 00:29:00,568
Lymph enlargement
makes me think polyarteritis...

519
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,070
You were saying?

520
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,619
No point in treating the symptom
and not the disease.

521
00:29:08,568 --> 00:29:11,312
Your stunt generated quite
a few responses. Let's take a look.

522
00:29:11,437 --> 00:29:13,566
- I'm way ahead of you.
- Paraneoplastic syndrome

523
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:15,960
- secondary to spinal tumor.
- No. No hypercalcemia.

524
00:29:16,085 --> 00:29:17,713
No muscle spasms or incontinence.

525
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:20,169
You are possessed
by the biblical demon "legion".

526
00:29:20,294 --> 00:29:22,051
No jumping off a cliff
in a herd of pigs.

527
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,053
Otherwise it did fit.
Graves' disease.

528
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,763
Thyroid levels are normal.

529
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,966
You want us to spend
the next few days shooting down

530
00:29:28,091 --> 00:29:30,601
every theory, or can we do our jobs
and come up with one that works?

531
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,895
I want you to test me
for amyloidosis.

532
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:36,315
- That your professional opinion?
- It's the wisdom of crowds.

533
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,450
Studies show the collective
decision of a group

534
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:41,018
can be more accurate
than any individual's decision.

535
00:29:41,143 --> 00:29:43,772
I went through my emails.
Amyloidosis got the most votes.

536
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:47,326
If you had amyloidosis, there'd be
speckling on your cardiac ultrasound.

537
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,844
In 100% of cases?

538
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:53,165
Fine.
I'll make you a deal.

539
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:55,507
We'll do a kidney biopsy
to test for amyloidosis.

540
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:58,372
When it comes back negative,
you pull your case off of the internet

541
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,014
and retract the reward.

542
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:02,800
It's either that,
or I don't test you at all.

543
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:05,010
Deal.

544
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:18,211
If you wanted a quickie,
you should've called ahead.

545
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:19,386
I'm a mess.

546
00:30:20,683 --> 00:30:22,069
Came home for lunch.

547
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,697
You have lunch with Cuddy
on Tuesdays.

548
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,015
She was busy.

549
00:30:26,473 --> 00:30:28,409
And you are checking up on me.

550
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,918
You know, you can talk to me.
Is that <i>my</i> laundry?

551
00:30:34,043 --> 00:30:36,041
You were running out of socks
for me to borrow.

552
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,669
You got plenty of underwear, though.

553
00:30:40,835 --> 00:30:41,835
I'm fine.

554
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:45,257
- You said that this morning.
- And consistency proves what?

555
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:49,638
Really. I'm good.
I'll put these in your room.

556
00:30:51,422 --> 00:30:53,199
<i>You always hurt</i>

557
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,249
<i>the one you love</i>

558
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,811
Biopsy showed deposits
in the renal endothelium

559
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:07,682
consistent with amyloidosis.

560
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,534
Internet was right.

561
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,209
- Start him on dexamethasone.
- Already done.

562
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,498
This may not be
the best time for this...

563
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:17,561
but I quit.

564
00:31:18,922 --> 00:31:21,670
I got an offer to join
a friend's surgical practice.

565
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,608
You don't generally get an offer
unless you're looking for one.

566
00:31:25,856 --> 00:31:28,810
I put out some feelers when I found out
House wasn't coming back.

567
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:32,097
I lobbied to keep the department open
so you could keep your job.

568
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:36,391
Yes. That was incredibly
altruistic of you.

569
00:31:39,933 --> 00:31:41,533
It's nothing personal.

570
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,558
Actually, I think
you're doing pretty well.

571
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,364
But I came here to work with House.

572
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:57,763
He's a jerk.

573
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:00,132
We'll be fine without him.

574
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:03,345
Do you know how many resumes
we get every day without even asking?

575
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:06,376
Might be a few less
after Cuddy shuts us down.

576
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:09,471
The case got solved
under your watch.

577
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:12,239
Does it really matter
how it happened?

578
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,017
It matters.

579
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,270
What if I'm just not ready
for this job?

580
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,110
Okay, you're sad.

581
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:30,698
I could tell you the story about me
and my roommate at Sarah Lawrence.

582
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,550
Her name was Lindsey,

583
00:32:38,885 --> 00:32:41,759
and she was a cheerleader from Iowa.

584
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,131
I broke my toilet this morning.

585
00:32:49,931 --> 00:32:52,059
- I'll get my tools.
- I blocked the intake valve

586
00:32:52,184 --> 00:32:54,458
so I could collect
some of House's urine.

587
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,792
Cuddy, he was barely limping.

588
00:32:56,988 --> 00:32:59,550
- What did the lab say?
- The urine was clean for vicodin.

589
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:02,725
It did, however,
contain strange epithelial cells.

590
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:06,532
Further analysis showed
they were from a labrador retriever.

591
00:33:08,813 --> 00:33:09,813
Damn.

592
00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:12,709
He's using.

593
00:34:50,344 --> 00:34:52,866
Vince, relax.
It's Dr. Foreman.

594
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:20,242
Kill it!

595
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:21,957
Kill it! No!

596
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,038
I don't have my blaster!

597
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,419
He's hallucinating,
he's burning up.

598
00:35:30,587 --> 00:35:32,418
Amyloidosis wouldn't do this.

599
00:35:36,041 --> 00:35:37,509
Antipyretics didn't work.

600
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:40,071
Hopefully the cold tub
will get his temp down.

601
00:35:41,653 --> 00:35:43,887
Maybe we should see
if anyone's sent in other ideas.

602
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:46,599
- Maybe the reward money attract...
- I'm not letting anyone else

603
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:49,630
jerk us around.
The masses were wrong about amyloidosis.

604
00:35:49,755 --> 00:35:51,303
They don't know about the fever.

605
00:35:51,428 --> 00:35:53,525
I'm going with light-chain
deposition disorder.

606
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:55,652
You okay with that?

607
00:36:06,337 --> 00:36:08,924
We think you have a disease
called LCDD.

608
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,900
It causes protein
to build up in your organs.

609
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,025
You think?

610
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:16,882
We can't definitely confirm
the diagnosis.

611
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,593
And our only chance of beating this

612
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:21,970
would be to start you
on high-dose chemotherapy.

613
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:23,600
But I do have to warn you

614
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,144
that in your condition,
it might kill you.

615
00:36:29,553 --> 00:36:31,647
Do you want me to get you
some more information?

616
00:36:33,688 --> 00:36:35,038
You're my doctor.

617
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,910
I trust you.

618
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,839
No, you don't.

619
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,442
You're scared, and you don't want
to make this decision.

620
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,753
My career is riding on this case...

621
00:36:55,643 --> 00:36:57,931
Nowhere near as important
as your life.

622
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,135
But I think the best shot
for both of us

623
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,950
is to treat for LCDD.

624
00:37:10,287 --> 00:37:13,162
All right, let's get you
out of this tub and into chemo.

625
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,946
We know you're back on vicodin.

626
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,073
The only thing you know
is that I'm a genius

627
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,281
who got a dog to pee in your toilet.

628
00:37:25,406 --> 00:37:28,345
You don't know how I did it
or, more interestingly,

629
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,413
where I peed.

630
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,540
You've spent
the last three months...

631
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:34,207
<i>Et tu, butte?</i>
You got no reason to be here.

632
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,964
- He's the one I was jerking around.
- Why is your leg better?

633
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,622
It hurts.
Please go away now.

634
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,425
If you think I'm using,

635
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,843
how about asking me
before taking a wrench to your plumbing?

636
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:47,055
You're an addict. You can't be surprised
if we can't take you at your word.

637
00:37:48,227 --> 00:37:49,975
Fine.
Let's get you some proof.

638
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:53,488
Hide your eyes, ladies.

639
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:56,607
You too.

640
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,740
My godson made me that mug.

641
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,907
If the lab says
that this is retriever too,

642
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,788
please let me know right away.
It'd explain my overwhelming desire

643
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:10,013
to wipe my butt on your carpet.

644
00:38:13,337 --> 00:38:15,584
Thank you for dragging me into this.

645
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,897
Stop the chemo.

646
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:38,692
He's got Fabry's disease.
He was in the tub for an hour.

647
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,884
His fingers should've pruned,
but they didn't.

648
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,759
Already stopped chemo
and confirmed Fabry's.

649
00:38:44,645 --> 00:38:47,741
I'm glad you both agree, but could
somebody loop me in here?

650
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:50,806
We assumed the deposits
in your kidneys were proteins,

651
00:38:50,931 --> 00:38:52,300
but they were fats.

652
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:55,481
Fabry's makes them build up
in your organs, choke your nerves,

653
00:38:55,606 --> 00:38:58,086
keep your fingers
from pruning in water.

654
00:38:58,411 --> 00:39:01,004
- It's chronic but manageable.
- How'd you figure it out?

655
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:07,928
Iodine mumps.

656
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,430
His lymph nodes swelled up
after the head C.T.

657
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,734
We thought it was a new symptom,
but it wasn't.

658
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:14,559
It was a reaction to the contrast.

659
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:16,730
Iodine mumps takes lymph nodes
off the table.

660
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,455
Remove that symptom...

661
00:39:20,054 --> 00:39:21,608
And that just came to you?

662
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,130
I looked through
the online responses again.

663
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:28,234
Someone posted it this morning.

664
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:45,995
Heard Cuddy made it official.
Department's yours. Congrats.

665
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,139
I'm sorry.

666
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:55,290
I went behind your back.

667
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,060
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how mad are you?

668
00:39:59,589 --> 00:40:00,485
7.

669
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:03,495
And that's stupid.

670
00:40:04,657 --> 00:40:05,944
You did the right thing.

671
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:09,124
- It's my fault you thought that.
- I should've stood up to you.

672
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:11,533
But you didn't 'cause
you didn't want to fight again.

673
00:40:15,094 --> 00:40:17,756
It's our first case.
It'll take time to adjust.

674
00:40:22,245 --> 00:40:25,797
What if by the time we get adjusted,
we don't like each other anymore?

675
00:40:26,796 --> 00:40:29,092
- That's not gonna happen.
- You sure?

676
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,137
'Cause ever since I took this job,
we've been making each other miserable.

677
00:40:37,878 --> 00:40:40,424
I really don't think
this is gonna work.

678
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:48,521
You're breaking up with me?

679
00:40:49,145 --> 00:40:52,264
The other night when I thought
I was done, you were there.

680
00:40:53,691 --> 00:40:54,741
I need you.

681
00:40:57,387 --> 00:40:59,137
I don't want to lose you.

682
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:02,614
Why are you...?

683
00:41:10,945 --> 00:41:12,295
You're firing me.

684
00:41:18,096 --> 00:41:19,096
I'm sorry.

685
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:25,319
I slipped.

686
00:41:27,406 --> 00:41:28,756
You took vicodin?

687
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,495
$25,000.

688
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:42,290
I solved my old team's case.

689
00:41:43,415 --> 00:41:45,400
I was about to take the pills.
I went online.

690
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:47,754
I found people posting
medical problems,

691
00:41:48,313 --> 00:41:49,313
and...

692
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:52,473
my leg stopped hurting.

693
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:02,519
I'm supposed to be changing my life.

694
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,063
- This is not a change.
- Well, maybe I was wrong.

695
00:42:06,077 --> 00:42:08,330
Says the guy making sand castles
in my brain.

696
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:10,026
We need to keep you from using.

697
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,285
Taking your job away,
the medical puzzles,

698
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,780
nearly drove you back to it.

699
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,149
Maybe diagnostic medicine

700
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,752
is the key to keeping you clean.

701
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:24,499
So you're okay with me
going online, solving cases?

702
00:42:26,881 --> 00:42:28,920
You can't sit all day
in a room by yourself.

703
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,088
Isolation, fosters depression.

704
00:42:31,669 --> 00:42:33,425
The hospital is part of my old life.

705
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:35,737
If I go back, I might become...

706
00:42:37,193 --> 00:42:40,432
- who I was before, pills and all.
- That's a possibility.

707
00:42:41,332 --> 00:42:42,582
But could be...

708
00:42:43,626 --> 00:42:46,722
The only thing worse for you
than going back to diagnostic medicine

709
00:42:48,614 --> 00:42:49,733
is not going back.

710
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:02,640
Guess we're gonna find out.
