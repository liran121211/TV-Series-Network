1
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:15,803
Hey.

2
00:00:16,816 --> 00:00:18,044
Hi!

3
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,542
Car's full of gas.

4
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:23,384
You sure?

5
00:00:24,157 --> 00:00:25,419
And if I'm not?

6
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:28,222
You'll be paying me back
for those damn invitations.

7
00:00:28,294 --> 00:00:29,454
Oh. Well, then never mind.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,989
Ted is a wonderful man, Dad.

9
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:35,227
He's the second
greatest guy I ever met.

10
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:40,230
Guess that's us.

11
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,364
Mmm-hmm.

12
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:14,903
Into this holy estate, these two
persons present now come to be joined.

13
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:17,499
And so, if any person
may show just cause

14
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,204
why they may not
be joined together,

15
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,873
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

16
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:24,911
That's what
I like to hear.

17
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,320
Do you,
Theodore Philip Taylor,

18
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,915
take Nicole Margaret Murray
to be your wife,

19
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,585
and promise before God
and these witnesses

20
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,652
to be her loving
and faithful husband,

21
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:42,258
in plenty and in want, in joy and
in sorrow, in sickness and in health,

22
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,701
so long as you
both shall live?

23
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:53,845
This isn't funny, Ted. Ted?

24
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,847
Are you all right?
Teddy?

25
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,852
Teddy! Ted.

26
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:56,302
Hey.

27
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:00,176
What time is it?

28
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,679
Happy time.

29
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,049
I'm still asleep.

30
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,917
Just think of this
as a dream.

31
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,255
What about House?

32
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,918
I said a dream,
not a nightmare.

33
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:16,359
He's in the next room.

34
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:17,862
Sound asleep.

35
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,153
Esteban,
hope you're getting ready.

36
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,221
Hmm.

37
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,964
I met the neighbors.

38
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,167
Sir, do you know
this man?

39
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,077
I don't need a temporary.
I need a permanent.

40
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,080
Yesterday.

41
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,520
Please do.

42
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,020
Good morning.
Hardly.

43
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,957
One of my PAs
quit an hour ago,

44
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:23,860
and I have to reshuffle
next month's schedule.

45
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,195
That's nothing. I woke up in
the wrong bed this morning.

46
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,462
Any bed you're in
is the wrong one.

47
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:34,195
That's not what your
mama said. Oh, snap.

48
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,010
I'll be going now.
To human resources.

49
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,172
He started it.

50
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:44,406
I was in
the neighbors' kid's bed.

51
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:47,543
Luckily, Esteban still
likes sleeping with Mommy.

52
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,951
How drunk were you?

53
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,819
About yay drunk.

54
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,693
Are you okay? You shouldn't be
drinking at all, much less...

55
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,730
You sound just
like Esteban's mom.

56
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,094
I need you
in the clinic.

57
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,360
Sorry, I'm busy.

58
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:04,198
Tell me you have a case.
You know, even if you don't.

59
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,328
I have a case.

60
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,896
Sounds interesting.
I'll take it.

61
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,568
I owe you one. Now tell
me you don't have a case.

62
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,110
I really do have a case.

63
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:13,577
We're even.

64
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:17,482
You guys know
how to honeymoon.

65
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,450
This is Dr. House.

66
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,678
Aphasia and syncope.

67
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:21,845
He can't speak.

68
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,912
"Aphasia" is Greek
for "loss of voice. "

69
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,050
We've ruled out infection,
vocal cord damage and stroke.

70
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:30,254
A lot of guys syncope
at the altar.

71
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,854
It's Greek for
"having the vapors. "

72
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,523
We ruled out all the
common causes of fainting,

73
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,762
low blood pressure,
hypoglycemia, dehydration.

74
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,266
Don't say "ah. "

75
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,036
Do you know
what it is?

76
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:49,013
Roll on your side
and lift up your gown.

77
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:51,209
There's one thing
they didn't test for.

78
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,276
A test for what?

79
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,351
Faking.

80
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,513
Ow!

81
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,183
Test was positive.

82
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,691
I can talk.

83
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,424
I wasn't faking. My voice
just came back right now.

84
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:08,960
Hey, I'm not the one
you have to convince.

85
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,627
I know he wasn't faking.

86
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,228
Boy, if she's buying that,
she might just be a keeper.

87
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,773
What about
the syncope?

88
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,274
Well, that...

89
00:06:18,177 --> 00:06:20,145
She buying this, too?

90
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,613
Why would he
fake anything?

91
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:25,242
<i>Kryo podia.
It's Greek for "duh. "</i>

92
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,554
So, you get to keep
the engagement ring.

93
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,717
I don't think
he was faking.

94
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,422
That's because you're
more gullible than I am.

95
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,055
For instance,
I don't believe

96
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,963
that you called off
your open marriage.

97
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,466
I believe your wife
called it off,

98
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,366
and you called off telling her
that you weren't calling it off.

99
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:48,132
Guy doesn't throw a
golden ticket in the trash.

100
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,334
Same way a guy doesn't give
up a lucrative medical practice

101
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,775
to come work for you?

102
00:06:51,844 --> 00:06:53,903
That's exactly
why you dabble.

103
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,313
You're compensating for your
professional conquests with sexual ones.

104
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:58,680
I'm not
that predictable.

105
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,685
For example, you're
probably not expecting me

106
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,618
to ask you out
for dinner tonight.

107
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:04,121
No, thanks.

108
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,214
You won't even
consider it?

109
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,315
I did, just very quickly.

110
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,893
Truth is, since I called this thing off,

111
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,520
my wife has been
very grateful,

112
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,428
and I could do
with a down night.

113
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,491
If I go out with the boss,
nobody can blame me.

114
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:18,332
Okay.

115
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:19,871
If you bring your wife.

116
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,167
No, that's the point.
I need a little...

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,332
You're lying.

118
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:23,705
I'm not lying!

119
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,038
Then I'm not going.

120
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,348
Okay. Fontina at 8:30.

121
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,614
You believe me, right?

122
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,817
Of course,
I believe you.

123
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,325
Then let's do it.

124
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:43,919
We'll tell the cab to take us
to AC right now and get it done.

125
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:46,794
You're serious? You just walked
out of the emergency room.

126
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,630
Exactly, I walked out.
I feel great.

127
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:53,531
Well, we do have
the clothes for it.

128
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,044
Ted? What's wrong?

129
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,505
Are you...
What's wrong?

130
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,049
Oh, my God.
Can somebody help us?

131
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:07,574
Please! Please, hurry.
Just breathe. Oh, my God.

132
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,214
There's gotta be a better
way to call off a wedding.

133
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,553
A tweet, for example.

134
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,423
Pleural effusion.

135
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,224
You think his lung
is faking it?

136
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,894
There's at least 200 cc's
of fluid in there.

137
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,561
Okay, let's say all
his symptoms are real.

138
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,194
Explain how one of them
suddenly went away

139
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,739
without using the words
"virgin" or "Mary. "

140
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,367
If the pleural effusion's
caused by something systemic,

141
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,274
it could explain
his other two symptoms.

142
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,778
So whether
you believe him or not,

143
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,371
all we have to figure out
is what caused the PE.

144
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,907
ER ruled out infection. Eosinophil
count ruled out parasites.

145
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,546
And medication he's
not telling us about.

146
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:45,147
You really don't trust this guy, do you?

147
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,454
I don't even
trust the ER.

148
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,256
Let's rule out
infections ourselves.

149
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,297
Tap his lung, send cultures,
run cytology for cancer,

150
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,128
and check his blood
pressure. We already...

151
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,760
This time, talk about
nuptials while you do it.

152
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,235
Check his home
for everything else.

153
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,363
He just moved in with his
fiancée three months ago.

154
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,408
Toxic exposure could take
longer than that to manifest.

155
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,705
You check
his love nest.

156
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:08,110
You two check his swinging bachelor pad.

157
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,909
That somebody else
now lives in?

158
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,449
I assume so.

159
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,849
Not the glass!

160
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,186
Place looks like 1960s?

161
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,427
Could have lead paint.

162
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,969
You think
a 27-year-old has pica?

163
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,973
If it gets us out of here
before the owner comes back, yes.

164
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,742
What did you tell
that cute physio?

165
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,643
That I changed my mind.

166
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:43,477
No, you didn't.

167
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,948
You're more nervous
than usual.

168
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:49,454
Because this B&E
has actual B.

169
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,683
What...

170
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,021
That's a suspended ceiling.

171
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,361
What are you doing?

172
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,989
I want to see
what's above it.

173
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:01,658
More ceiling.

174
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:07,998
Made of
40-year-old acoustic tile.

175
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,668
Asbestosis, I like it.
I'll be in the car.

176
00:10:11,577 --> 00:10:13,670
What the hell?

177
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,011
It's okay. We're doctors.
Nobody was home, so we...

178
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,482
Well, I'm calling
the police.

179
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,349
Do you know Ted Taylor?
He used to live here.

180
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:22,812
Yeah, what about him?

181
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:24,856
He's our patient
at Princeton-Plainsboro.

182
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,948
Is he okay?

183
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:28,152
We think he may have asbestosis
from your ceiling tiles.

184
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,162
They're not asbestos. I had
them checked when I moved in.

185
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,288
How sick is he?

186
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,423
Is he a friend
of yours?

187
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,023
He was.

188
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:38,264
Actually, he was my
boyfriend for three years.

189
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,037
I'm not gay.
Really?

190
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,910
'Cause it would certainly
explain the cold feet.

191
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,005
Oh, and the boyfriend.

192
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,913
So you're bisexual?

193
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,576
No, I'm straight.

194
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,053
Cotter, the guy you met,
he's gay.

195
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,147
He had a crush on me.
I left.

196
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,282
After three years?

197
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,484
It's possible.

198
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,857
Doesn't mean you're gay just because
the guy you're sleeping with is.

199
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,293
We weren't
sleeping together...

200
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,660
What's this got to
do with anything?

201
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:07,631
Lung tap turned up
mononucleosis.

202
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,531
ER doesn't
routinely test for it.

203
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:12,400
It explains the PE and can
be virtually asymptomatic.

204
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:15,065
We got to wondering, how
does a 27-year-old get mono?

205
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,371
You're a little old
for the kissing disease

206
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,502
unless your immune system
is compromised.

207
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,136
If there's been
any unprotected sex,

208
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,544
we'll need
to test for HIV.

209
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,583
There's been
no sex of any kind.

210
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,776
Okay.

211
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:30,288
I'll go test your fiancée
for HIV. She the curious sort?

212
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,146
Wait.

213
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:38,887
There may have been some
contact. But I'm not gay.

214
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:42,764
Sodomy, one of the top 10 most
common household accidents.

215
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,531
I did a lot of stupid things,
but I turned my life around.

216
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:46,969
I'm as straight
as any of you.

217
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,298
You don't have
to believe me.

218
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,605
I'm just saying

219
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:55,579
you can test me as long
as you don't tell Nicole.

220
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:58,212
What business is it
of hers?

221
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,345
I don't see anything wrong with
him marrying a straight woman.

222
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,684
How about it'll make
them both miserable?

223
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,451
Just like most
straight marriages.

224
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,790
He's got the right to life, liberty
and unhappiness like the rest of us.

225
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:11,591
Absolutely no reason
to look at me.

226
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,961
I'm not saying
it's a great choice.

227
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,590
Just saying
it's his choice.

228
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,726
But it has to be hers as
well, which it can't be

229
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:18,463
as long as she
doesn't know he's gay.

230
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:19,731
Which is how
it's gonna stay

231
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,136
since we have
no right to tell her.

232
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,674
Like you've never
bent the rules.

233
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,506
You date guys.
You date girls.

234
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,671
I assume, at some point,
you're gonna make a choice.

235
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,510
I don't lie
about who I am.

236
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,015
Patients lying never
bothered you before.

237
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,813
Patients weren't lying about
their sexual orientation before.

238
00:12:33,886 --> 00:12:36,286
So you're only judgmental
when it gets personal?

239
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,414
Does it bother me
that people hurt others

240
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,049
because they're too weak
to face the truth?

241
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,753
Yeah. Sorry about that.

242
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,352
Tell me she's
not looking at me.

243
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,128
He's negative?
Yep.

244
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,332
Looks like being gay
didn't make him sick.

245
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:59,143
So maybe being
straight did.

246
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,839
Test was negative,
no HIV.

247
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,109
Told you.

248
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:08,178
What you didn't tell us is how
you turned your life around.

249
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:10,051
That can be pretty hard.
It was.

250
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,056
Downright impossible
on your own.

251
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,887
I talked to some people.

252
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,824
It was more than
just talk, wasn't it?

253
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,498
I know this is
personal stuff.

254
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,001
I'm here to help you,
not out you.

255
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,199
I had therapy.

256
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,005
Conversion therapy.

257
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,205
Went to a camp for three weeks
of intensive rehabilitation.

258
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,876
They injected him with emetics
while he watched gay porn.

259
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,043
Apomorphine?

260
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:43,452
Or lithium chloride, or
cyclophosphamide. He doesn't know.

261
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:46,116
And when that didn't work, they
shot him up with male hormones.

262
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,353
A chemical assault like that
could explain the PE.

263
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:50,691
And the ECT
explains the rest.

264
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,561
They gave him electroconvulsive
therapy to make him straight?

265
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,623
To zap the fabulous
right out of him.

266
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,168
Neural damage accounts
for the aphasia.

267
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,295
ECT doesn't cause
neural damage.

268
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:04,035
Unless it was done at Dr.
Liberace's He-man Quackery Camp.

269
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:08,512
Run an EEG. See if they straightened
him or just scrambled him.

270
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,425
Sorry, I completely forgot.

271
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:26,021
My wife just started a
ceramics class Tuesdays at 8:00.

272
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,759
It's a half-hour
drive from here.

273
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,391
She won't be back
till 10:30.

274
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,630
She's taking it with
her girlfriend, Marly.

275
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,005
She hopes to make
a tea service.

276
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:40,375
You want to call her?

277
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,708
No need.

278
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,975
I already texted her.

279
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:46,017
And here she is now.

280
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:51,548
I think you're still
seeing the physio.

281
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:54,454
You got a backup suit
in your car.

282
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,687
Don't wanna be
bringing home da stank.

283
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,594
Okay, yes. You're right.
About everything.

284
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,359
But please, House,
don't tell her.

285
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:01,456
Hi, Rachel.

286
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,501
Hi, Dr. House. I didn't
know you'd be here.

287
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,367
Hi, honey.
Got your text, obviously.

288
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,498
I'm just leaving.
I got a ceramics class.

289
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,040
Really?
I love it.

290
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,636
Even managed to talk Chris
into signing up for one.

291
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,681
Of course, he's in
the beginners' class.

292
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,444
You're in
a ceramics class?

293
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:19,779
Friday nights, right?

294
00:15:20,719 --> 00:15:23,279
Friday nights.
Sounded like fun.

295
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,380
You should join Chris's.

296
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,016
You know, I should.

297
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,561
Well, gotta go.

298
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:32,620
Making a tea service.

299
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,701
Hi. I must've fallen
asleep in the lounge.

300
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,802
What are they doing?
An EEG.

301
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,779
What's it for?

302
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:50,246
We're looking for
neurological damage

303
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,681
that could've
caused his symptoms.

304
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,615
Damage from what?

305
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,017
A head trauma.

306
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,884
He had an accident?

307
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,016
It wasn't an accident.
It was before he met you.

308
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:02,492
What happened?
Was he hospitalized?

309
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,096
You should
ask him about it.

310
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,857
They have the results.

311
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,904
Everything
looks normal.

312
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,070
Look at this.

313
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:22,578
Beta waves are spiking.

314
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,774
What's that mean?

315
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:24,907
I'm not sure.

316
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,145
He's coding!
Crash cart!

317
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,380
What's happening to him?

318
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,581
He's having
a heart attack.

319
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,520
Charging. Clear.

320
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,424
EKG showed
no abnormalities.

321
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,933
So what caused
the arrest?

322
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,129
Four ways
to stop a heart.

323
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:49,004
Electrical problems, restricted blood
flow, blood where it shouldn't be.

324
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:50,735
Shocks, blocks
or bleeds.

325
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,140
I think that's
three things.

326
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,735
And cheating.

327
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,613
No, sorry, that's
how you break a heart.

328
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:02,980
I found a ceramics class in Trenton
on Friday nights that was full,

329
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:05,751
so my wife
couldn't join me.

330
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,521
EP study
ruled out shocks.

331
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,792
Now you just have to find
some Pottery by Taub.

332
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,423
The lamer it looks,
the better.

333
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,798
So we'll do an angio to see
if it's blocks or bleeds.

334
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,893
You should be a doctor.

335
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,006
I'm going to check out
this new lesbian bar tonight.

336
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:31,743
Your life is awesome.

337
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:32,943
You wanna come?

338
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,864
I was telling a 33-year-old
woman that she has breast cancer.

339
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,730
No, you weren't.

340
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,360
How do you know?
Because if you were,

341
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:53,132
you'd need to see
the pain in her eyes

342
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,797
so she can see
the concern in yours.

343
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:58,036
Why are you setting me up
on dates with my team?

344
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,509
Taub asking me out
was quirky,

345
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,603
but Thirteen doing it
is a barking cat.

346
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,840
I'm doing it
to help you.

347
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,407
By setting me up with a
hottie that I can't sleep with?

348
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,474
And Thirteen?

349
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,418
I've been spending
more time with Sam.

350
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:10,648
I know it's been
hard on you.

351
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:11,950
I figured if you
had some company...

352
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,184
I don't need your help.

353
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,193
Then consider it helping
our neighbor's four-year-old.

354
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,195
I gave him a dollar.

355
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,287
How much did you
have to pay?

356
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,353
Nothing.

357
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,195
I just told them
you might be feeling down,

358
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,031
and it was in their
self-interest to keep you company.

359
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,598
A hundred bucks.
Foreman held out for 200.

360
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,870
House,
I'm worried about you.

361
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,674
You could've ended up
in jail or worse.

362
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,873
Racking you with guilt.

363
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,543
So I do something really
stupid, and you reward me.

364
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,315
Read any parenting manual. That's
not helping me. That's helping you.

365
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,887
Fine, I did it for me, for my
relationship, out of pure self-interest.

366
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,190
Okay.

367
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,457
You'll do it?

368
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,624
For you.

369
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:57,791
Thank you.

370
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,895
It's not gonna work,
though.

371
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,999
Maybe. But how bad can a
night out at a lesbian bar be?

372
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,348
Hey.

373
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,943
How are you doing?

374
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,989
Heart attack at 27.

375
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,120
They said you had
a head trauma?

376
00:19:24,963 --> 00:19:29,525
I fell off a stepladder and hit
my head. It was a stupid accident.

377
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,632
An accident.

378
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,603
We need to prep you
for your angio.

379
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,165
Valium will
help you relax.

380
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,542
We're gonna run a line
through your femoral artery.

381
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,709
Ted? He's having another heart attack?

382
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,773
I don't think so. His
heart rate seems normal.

383
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:49,445
Mmm.

384
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,250
Are you okay?

385
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,086
You weren't discussing
wedding plans, were you?

386
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,989
No. I guess I just...

387
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:01,327
Fainted.

388
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,769
POTS. Postural Orthostatic
Tachycardia Syndrome.

389
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,236
BP plummets
when he's upright,

390
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:09,206
reverts to normal
when he's lying down.

391
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,469
He was lying down both times
we took his blood pressure.

392
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,841
Protracted hypotension could
have induced his heart attack.

393
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,038
Also explains
his syncope.

394
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,171
And his aphasia.

395
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,978
He was upright, then you laid
him down on the bed to test him.

396
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,882
BP reverted to normal,
voice came back.

397
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,614
Jabbing him with the needle
had nothing to do with it.

398
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,816
POTS can be brought on by viral or
bacterial infection such as mono.

399
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,724
So load him up
with fludrocortisone.

400
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,456
You didn't read your ceramics
course description, did you?

401
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,498
Yeah. You did?

402
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,827
As I'm sure
your wife did.

403
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,368
So we all know they're
doing a Fourth of July theme.

404
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:40,462
She'll be expecting
something star-spangled.

405
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:45,637
Nicole?

406
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,837
Yes.

407
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,547
Cotter Macklin.
I'm an old friend of Ted's.

408
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,776
Hi.

409
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:54,850
How's he doing?

410
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,047
He had a heart attack.

411
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,756
Oh, my God.

412
00:21:02,894 --> 00:21:07,422
They have him on some new
meds, really knocked him out.

413
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,490
Well, how are you
holding up?

414
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,196
I'm okay. Thanks.

415
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,066
I brought this for him.

416
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,337
That's his favorite thing
in the whole world.

417
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,477
I know.

418
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,679
You weren't at the wedding, were you?

419
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,522
No, I wasn't invited.
Ted and I had a falling out.

420
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,524
How did you
know each other?

421
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:42,066
We met senior year
of college.

422
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,295
Yeah, we shared a house
for a while.

423
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,836
You were roommates.

424
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,303
For three years.

425
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,221
I'm sorry.
I just miss him.

426
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,724
I think you should leave.

427
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,122
I shouldn't have done that. Now.

428
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,390
Please?

429
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,565
I hope he gets better.

430
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,519
Hey.
How are you feeling?

431
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,821
Mmm. Don't know yet.

432
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:47,023
Your numbers look good. We're
gonna keep you on these meds.

433
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,076
You had a visitor
while you were asleep.

434
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,485
Oh, yeah? Who?

435
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,688
Cotter. Who is he?

436
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,420
I shared a house
with him after college.

437
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:19,362
I don't know why
he would show up.

438
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,530
That's it?
Yeah.

439
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,293
Why? What did he say?

440
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,108
I need to hear it
from you, Ted.

441
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,134
One night, I got really
drunk and I went to bed.

442
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,464
And he came
into my room,

443
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,470
and one thing
led to another.

444
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,778
The whole thing
was a mistake.

445
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:14,715
Are you saying
you had sex with him?

446
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,684
I was drunk
and confused...

447
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,881
You're gay?

448
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,981
No.

449
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,129
I thought I was.

450
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:31,094
I even made up my mind
to tell my family.

451
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,962
I stood in front of the bathroom
mirror, psyching myself up.

452
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,165
But all I could see
was disgust.

453
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,176
And that's
when I realized

454
00:24:42,047 --> 00:24:47,178
I didn't hate the thought of admitting
I was gay because I was ashamed.

455
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:50,982
I hated the thought
because I wasn't gay.

456
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:54,381
And that was the day
I went to get help.

457
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,228
So you're not gay?

458
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,222
They cured me, Nicole.

459
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,460
That's what all
the head trauma is about.

460
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:08,472
I'm sorry I didn't tell you,
but it's all in the past now.

461
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,903
It doesn't
matter anymore.

462
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:18,771
What is it?

463
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,320
Oh, my head!

464
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,056
He's got
severe headaches.

465
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,491
So do I.

466
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,593
Should I call or raise
with a double gutshot draw?

467
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,861
Nope.
What about infection?

468
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:39,995
That's what
we're thinking.

469
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,938
Cerebral infection would explain
the headaches, could've caused POTS.

470
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,565
If it's fungal, could've
spread to the heart.

471
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,941
I was talking about you.

472
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:49,242
Has the little gent
been wearing a tent?

473
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:52,911
Remind me why that has
anything to do with you.

474
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,248
A distracted person makes
a distracted professional.

475
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:58,015
And destroying my marriage
will help me focus.

476
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,522
Probably.

477
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,352
Do a spinal tap,
run the CSF.

478
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,053
Still talking about you!

479
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,395
But you can do it on the
patient, too, if you want.

480
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,246
What about her?

481
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,480
The bartender?

482
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,489
She's the only one
who's not here for fun.

483
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,149
Trust me,
she's not straight.

484
00:26:34,225 --> 00:26:36,318
If your gaydar
is so great,

485
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,794
how come you didn't know about the
patient till you met his boyfriend?

486
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:40,660
Guy walked in
with his bride,

487
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,223
it took me awhile
to rotate my dish.

488
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,627
It's unbelievable
what he's doing to her.

489
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,899
You don't think
he loves her?

490
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:51,101
He may love her, but he needs
to have sex with other men.

491
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:54,737
Taub loves his wife, he needs
to have sex with other women.

492
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:58,112
Yeah, it sucks what he's doing to
her, too, but it's hardly the same.

493
00:26:58,183 --> 00:26:59,309
To be faithful
to his wife,

494
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,249
our patient has to
deny his identity.

495
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,547
Taub just needs to...

496
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,384
Has to resist
the biological imperative.

497
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,515
It is easier to
say no to dessert

498
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:07,819
than to pretend
you don't eat.

499
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,951
Says someone who's obviously
never been on a diet.

500
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,655
My life's a breeze.

501
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:18,429
You're successful, smart, and
you attract everything that moves.

502
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,561
If you wanna focus
on the fact

503
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,833
that you're not gonna see
50, that's your choice.

504
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,840
You know what?
I agree with you.

505
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:26,741
My self-pity's optional.
What about yours?

506
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,943
Yeah.

507
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,079
CSF was negative
for infection,

508
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,178
and his headaches
are worse.

509
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,653
We were just
talking about you.

510
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,190
Please don't.

511
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,156
It's not POTS,
we're back to square one.

512
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,956
Not quite.

513
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,962
You did a spinal tap and
the headaches got worse.

514
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,403
We're maxing him out
on morphine.

515
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:58,306
He sprung a leak. He's
losing CSF from the tap site.

516
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,866
We made his headaches
worse?

517
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,809
<i>Just you, actually.</i>

518
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,210
That still wouldn't explain why he
got the headaches in the first place.

519
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:09,013
Low pressure in his brain caused
the POTS, not the other way around.

520
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:12,056
Patch the leak, top him
up with artificial CSF.

521
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,967
There.
That should stop the leak.

522
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,560
You should be feeling
some relief soon.

523
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:32,901
I spoke to my parents.

524
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,676
How are they doing?

525
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,078
They're still worried.

526
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:39,412
Well, tell them
not to be.

527
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,585
Everything's
going to be okay.

528
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:47,756
Ted?

529
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:48,848
What's happening?

530
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:49,985
He's stroking.

531
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,890
Both eyes
are responsive.

532
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,123
Tell me your full name.

533
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,257
Theodore Philip Taylor.

534
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,391
This isn't a stroke.
Then what is it?

535
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,037
What's happening to me?

536
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,708
It's really not POTS, we're
really back to square one.

537
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,679
So what's masquerading
as a stroke?

538
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,417
Voted the worst Halloween
costume, by the way.

539
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,787
MRI showed no problems with
blood flow to the brain,

540
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:22,087
rules out TIA.

541
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,820
Sarcoidosis?

542
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:26,090
Chest X-rays showed
no hilar masses.

543
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,122
Any luck with
the pottery?

544
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,359
Wasn't easy.

545
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,597
Bought a suitably cruddy set of
fife and drum napkin rings online.

546
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:33,762
Scleroderma?

547
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,204
Skin's fine,
ANA was negative.

548
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,798
So what'd that set you back? Too much.

549
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:40,309
I got into a bidding war
with some lunatic.

550
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:41,435
Histoplasmosis.

551
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,912
EIA was clear.

552
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,081
But, hey, could've gone
a lot higher than $215.

553
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,950
You're KissMyAsthma99?

554
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,615
What about MELAS?

555
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:54,487
Mitochondrial
encephalomyopathy,

556
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,493
lactic acidosis and
stroke-like episodes.

557
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,061
NILLAS.

558
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:04,133
No, idiot, lactate levels are
stable. We're missing something.

559
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:05,600
We've run every test
that makes sense,

560
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,932
asked every question
we can think of,

561
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:08,563
gone over his history
a dozen times.

562
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,267
We know how much
we can trust his history.

563
00:30:10,341 --> 00:30:12,969
If history's written
by the victor,

564
00:30:13,044 --> 00:30:15,069
how do we find out
what really happened?

565
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,137
Talk to the loser.
Call the boyfriend.

566
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:18,408
Let's get them all
in the same room.

567
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,815
Or we could question them
separately and not torture them.

568
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,047
Or we could get them all in
the same room and get the truth.

569
00:30:28,893 --> 00:30:29,985
Oh.

570
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:33,095
Drinks are on me
and Foreman tonight.

571
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,529
Can't. Pap smear.

572
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,656
We don't want
to do it either,

573
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,927
but Wilson
already paid us.

574
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,161
It's going to suck.

575
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,328
I know.

576
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,868
Where and when?

577
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,337
Any incidents
of dizziness?

578
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,312
Seizures?

579
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,410
Blackouts?

580
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:53,113
Other than
our wedding day.

581
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,543
Don't you think I would've
told you if there were?

582
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,018
My sister's birthday.

583
00:30:57,088 --> 00:30:58,316
I was drunk.

584
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,082
You had one martini.

585
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:01,216
On an empty stomach.

586
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,953
Look, he was just
sitting on the couch,

587
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,461
and then he fell over
and that was it.

588
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,465
Once I slept it off,
I was fine.

589
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,160
Well, I stayed up
that night,

590
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,465
checking on him
every 15 minutes.

591
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,004
What about sex?

592
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:18,468
Yes, I have sex with my
girlfriend because I'm not gay.

593
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:20,069
We have sex.

594
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:21,168
Thank you.

595
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:23,880
No problems?

596
00:31:26,017 --> 00:31:29,009
Well, there have
been some issues.

597
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,520
Nic...

598
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:31,646
Erectile dysfunction?

599
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,419
Every guy has it sometimes.

600
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,864
We never had
that problem.

601
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,367
Gee, that must be because
Ted doesn't like girls.

602
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,628
Or because
it's vascular.

603
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,601
I know we did an MRA, but arterial
disease causing acute ischemia

604
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,574
could explain the heart, neuro
symptoms, maybe even POTS.

605
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,841
Might I suggest
a diagnostic test?

606
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:02,244
A penile plethysmograph measures
changes in blood flow in your penis,

607
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:05,015
tells us if there's
a circulatory problem.

608
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,115
You just need to be
in the right state.

609
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,216
What's your pleasure?

610
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:13,856
I feel terrible, I don't
think anything's gonna work.

611
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,365
Then we'll have
to give you a shot.

612
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,731
Where you don't
want to get one.

613
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,435
Shot it is.

614
00:32:24,709 --> 00:32:27,109
<i>He kept dreaming</i>

615
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,543
<i>Dreaming</i>

616
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,446
<i>That someday
he'd be a star</i>

617
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,880
<i>Superstar,
but he didn't get far</i>

618
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:38,052
<i>But he sure found
out the hard way</i>

619
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,920
<i>That dreams don't
always come true</i>

620
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:42,016
<i>Dreams don't
always come true</i>

621
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,117
<i>Oh, no</i>

622
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,592
<i>No
No</i>

623
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:47,130
<i>He's leaving</i>

624
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:48,529
<i>Leaving</i>

625
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,432
<i>On that midnight
train to Georgia</i>

626
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,027
<i>Leaving on
a midnight train</i>

627
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,766
<i>Yeah, said he's
going back to find</i>

628
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,606
<i>Going back to find</i>

629
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:02,441
<i>A simpler place and time</i>

630
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,071
<i>Whenever
he takes that ride</i>

631
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,616
<i>Guess who's gonna
be right by his side</i>

632
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,615
<i>I'm gonna be with him</i>

633
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,620
<i>I know you will</i>

634
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:13,316
<i>On a midnight
train to Georgia</i>

635
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,485
<i>Leaving on a midnight train to Georgia</i>

636
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:20,193
<i>I'd rather live
in his world</i>

637
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:21,288
<i>Live in his world</i>

638
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,994
<i>Than live
without him in mine</i>

639
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,491
<i>World
His world</i>

640
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,003
<i>His tears
My world</i>

641
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:29,039
<i>His and hers alone</i>

642
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:32,304
<i>I've got to go, I've
got to go, I've got to go</i>

643
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:35,141
<i>His and hers alone</i>

644
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:40,139
Nobody wants
to follow that.

645
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,118
The night just keeps
getting better.

646
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,244
To Wilson.

647
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:45,118
Wilson.
Wilson.

648
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,719
Everything looks fine.

649
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:49,054
You sure?

650
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,727
Medically,
that's good news.

651
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,459
You feeling feverish
or sweating?

652
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:59,196
No, I feel lousy, but I
don't know why I'm sweating.

653
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,365
What is it?

654
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,841
You're not sweating.

655
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,146
You're lactating.

656
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,684
If he can't tell
his fiancée he's gay,

657
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:19,484
how's he going to
tell her he's pregnant?

658
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,490
His therapists loaded
him with hormones.

659
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,625
Male hormones don't
make you lactate.

660
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,528
Except they can
screw up your thyroid.

661
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,793
That was over
three months ago,

662
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,425
we just started
milking him last night.

663
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,438
So something else screwed up his
thyroid. Graves', Hashimoto's...

664
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,838
No. TSH was normal.

665
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:44,447
Pituitary tumor. Could also
explain his libido and heart issues.

666
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:48,777
And if the tumor's big enough,
his headaches and syncope.

667
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,087
Except we cleared him
for cancer.

668
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,627
Didn't say "cancer,"
prolactinomas can be benign.

669
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,932
Check his prolactin level
and MRI his pituitary.

670
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,780
Sounds like you
had fun last night.

671
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,351
You believe Chase?

672
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,250
I believe Foreman.

673
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,484
And they had fun with you.
What happened?

674
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,620
I realized that they
could be my friends.

675
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:38,532
You're serious.

676
00:35:38,603 --> 00:35:39,968
And then I sobered up.

677
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,538
You weren't that drunk.

678
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,598
You managed to find your way into
your own little bed last night.

679
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,473
I think I sleep better
in rocket-ship sheets.

680
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:49,569
No. You want to
blame this on the booze,

681
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,808
but that's easy.
Change is hard.

682
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,543
And wisdom is knowing
the difference

683
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:56,280
between what
you can change...

684
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,092
And what
you were born with.

685
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:07,359
And cowardice is labeling what
you don't wanna change as innate.

686
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:09,956
I was winning
this argument.

687
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,231
Pituitary MRI...

688
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,534
Was normal.

689
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,535
How are the headaches?

690
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:22,840
Terrible.

691
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,076
Give me your head.

692
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:26,275
What the hell?

693
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,510
I know, it's the
first time you heard

694
00:36:27,585 --> 00:36:29,485
that sentence with
a possessive pronoun.

695
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,462
Oh, wow, that's better.

696
00:36:47,405 --> 00:36:48,429
Okay. Enough.

697
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:49,939
How cool is that?

698
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:52,599
You have
a Chiari Malformation,

699
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,544
a narrowing in the base of your
skull that can cut off CSF flow.

700
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:59,412
But it wasn't a problem until
the ECT at Breeder Boot Camp

701
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:02,509
caused your brain to swell
just enough to plug the opening.

702
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,953
And when your brain pressed
up against your pituitary,

703
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,889
it signed you up
for La Leche League.

704
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,919
You still won't be pitching
a tent for your lady,

705
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:13,519
but that's just because,
you know, she's a lady.

706
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,691
Its orthostatic effect
was mimicking POTS.

707
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:18,291
It also does an uncanny
Christopher Walken.

708
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,565
Unfortunately, if you treat
it like POTS, it gets worse.

709
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:24,574
So, as far
as that goes, oops.

710
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,070
Proper treatment is surgery.
We'll get you in right away.

711
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:29,442
So, how did
I get this thing?

712
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:30,707
Overbearing mother.

713
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:34,349
Kidding, CM's congenital.

714
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,251
Like so many other things,
you were born that way.

715
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,133
Thought you might
be running low, so...

716
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,299
Thanks.

717
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,879
I'm not coming back.

718
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,146
Ted, this is a mistake.

719
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,050
I know you're hurting,
and I'm sorry...

720
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,749
I'm talking
about hurting her.

721
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,017
I love her.

722
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,517
Ted...

723
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,563
Thank you
for your support.

724
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:24,492
We both really
appreciate it.

725
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,860
Good luck.

726
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:52,854
Hey.

727
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,165
You know what
I've been thinking?

728
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,465
It's your birthday
in three weeks.

729
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,135
What do you say we re-book the
church and make it a doubleheader?

730
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,540
I don't know, Ted.

731
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:14,847
Less than a week ago, we were
standing at the altar perfectly happy.

732
00:39:14,919 --> 00:39:16,910
Nothing's changed.

733
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,079
Really?

734
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,020
I still love you.

735
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:23,416
Do you still love me?

736
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,156
Yes, but...

737
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:29,859
Then that's all
that matters.

738
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,098
But I think that
you still love him.

739
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:42,874
I'm not gay, Nicole.
I promise you.

740
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:47,378
How can you
promise me that?

741
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:51,182
Because I believe that we get
to choose how we live our lives.

742
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:53,382
And I've made my choice.

743
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,790
So now,
I have to make mine.

744
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,730
I'm so sorry.

745
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,890
Nic...

746
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:03,024
I'm sorry.

747
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,433
Nic!

748
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,562
No. No.

749
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:14,069
I'm not saying goodbye.

750
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,373
Yeah.

751
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:22,249
I want to marry you!
I have to marry you!

752
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,011
Nic.

753
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,927
It's Friday night.

754
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,998
I called it off.

755
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,696
For real this time.

756
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,671
Frees you up
for the next one.

757
00:40:43,674 --> 00:40:45,107
One day at a time.

758
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,337
Napkin rings.

759
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,774
My way of saying thanks.

760
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,375
For trying to
wreck your marriage?

761
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,318
For trying to save it.

762
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,413
And I get napkin rings.

763
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:01,958
Expensive ones.

764
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,439
I hired a replacement
for my PA.

765
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:23,006
She seems great.

766
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:25,973
Good work.

767
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,415
You, too.

768
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,851
Your patient's
going home tomorrow.

769
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,820
He doesn't have a home.

770
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,159
You want to
grab a bite to eat?

771
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:41,596
So Wilson got to you, too.

772
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,031
No, this is just me.

773
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,125
Lucas?

774
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,294
Working late.

775
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,302
I'm buying.

776
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,575
Not that hungry.

777
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,445
Okay.

778
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,982
I just want us
to be friends.

779
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,794
Funny.

780
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,799
That's the last thing
I want us to be.
