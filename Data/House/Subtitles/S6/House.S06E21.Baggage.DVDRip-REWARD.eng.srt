1
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,051
Okay, therafy me.

2
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:34,961
You're late.

3
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,195
You're fat.

4
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:40,199
It's unusual.

5
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:44,710
You know how far the parking
lot is? My leg's been hurting.

6
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:47,212
Anything been on your mind
lately? Any particular stress?

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,908
Nope. Probably
just gonna rain.

8
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,007
Hmm.

9
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:54,451
You like the new Monet
reproduction in the waiting room?

10
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,351
<i>The Water Lilies?</i>

11
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,619
I was late. I wasn't
focusing on the decor,

12
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:03,890
but it sounds appropriately
bland and calming.

13
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,261
Stress can also make
you absent-minded.

14
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,232
I'm not stressed.

15
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:12,269
Beyond the stress induced by
you telling me how stressed I am.

16
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,031
Just an ordinary week.

17
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,937
Okay.

18
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:22,741
Tell me about it.

19
00:01:26,786 --> 00:01:28,447
<i>I had a patient...</i>

20
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,920
House?

21
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:33,458
Good, I have
a case for you.

22
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:35,050
Beer?

23
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,288
Amnesia.

24
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:39,097
She was found jogging in
the street, disoriented.

25
00:01:39,165 --> 00:01:41,224
She almost got hit
by a truck.

26
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,496
The MRI showed
no abnormalities.

27
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,095
No ID on her, just her jogging
clothes and her heart rate monitor.

28
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,437
We know absolutely
nothing about her.

29
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,204
We know
she has money.

30
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,178
Blaze Outriggers,
400 bucks a pair.

31
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,348
People who have money
don't just disappear.

32
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:59,078
Sooner or later, someone is
gonna show up looking for her.

33
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,278
Can I have
something to eat?

34
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,878
She just ate
15 minutes ago.

35
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,048
She keeps forgetting.

36
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,423
You don't eat because you
remember it's time to eat,

37
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,688
you eat because
you're hungry.

38
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,888
Her metabolism
is in high gear.

39
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,592
She is an extreme
long-distance runner who...

40
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,691
<i>Why were you in the ER?</i>

41
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,629
That's your question?

42
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:22,131
You're a psychotherapist, you're
hearing about a great amnesia case,

43
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:23,903
and all you're
asking me is geography?

44
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,842
Just curious.

45
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,040
I was avoiding Wilson.

46
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,214
It's not something you couldn't
have seen eight miles away.

47
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,755
<i>Wilson's a processor.</i>

48
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:43,694
<i>I knew there were some things
that he'd want to process with me.</i>

49
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,162
<i>At length.</i>

50
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:46,926
Sam's moving in.

51
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,665
If it's before Friday, your
assistant wins the pool.

52
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:54,173
I was just wondering
what your plans were.

53
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,209
Tonight?
In life.

54
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,708
Sam likes you...

55
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,111
But she wants me
to move out.

56
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,444
No.

57
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,876
I want you to move out.

58
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:10,612
I didn't know things with
Sam would happen so quickly.

59
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,386
I didn't... I don't want
to make a mistake here.

60
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,585
I've made a lot
of mistakes.

61
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,253
By moving too quickly.

62
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,795
Given your usual
rate of commitment,

63
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,059
I'm surprised you're
not already re-divorced.

64
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,932
I could help you
find a place.

65
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,061
What's wrong
with my old place?

66
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:30,007
Nothing. I just thought you
might want to find somewhere new.

67
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:31,566
Somewhere...

68
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,776
Where I didn't abuse
drugs and hallucinate?

69
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,476
Yes.

70
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,308
I'm fine.

71
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,374
<i>You're fine?</i>

72
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,651
Your best friend is tossing
you out, and you're fine?

73
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,287
Why wouldn't I be?

74
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:29,632
You're not feeling a
little betrayed and angry?

75
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:32,668
Wilson bought
a two-bedroom condo

76
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,263
specifically so that you
could move in with him.

77
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,205
It wasn't
that long ago.

78
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,276
You don't feel
a little jerked around?

79
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:43,609
He couldn't foresee Sam
coming back into his life.

80
00:04:43,683 --> 00:04:46,015
That's a very rational
defense of your friend,

81
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,383
and I'm not buying it.

82
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,614
Based on what?

83
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,987
Based on the fact
that you were late,

84
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:54,151
and you didn't notice the
pictures in the outer office.

85
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,387
Those aren't symptoms.

86
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,553
They are to me.

87
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:59,757
And here's another one,
you took the case. Hmm.

88
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:02,460
No negotiating.
No bargaining.

89
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,833
No clinic hours
changed hands.

90
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:06,371
Were you looking for
something to distract you

91
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,134
from the fact that your best
friend just threw you out?

92
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:10,403
The case was interesting.

93
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,502
It's not organic,
it's not mysterious.

94
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,742
Most likely some psychologically
traumatic event occurred

95
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,216
that made the patient's brain
choose to forget everything.

96
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,378
Or not.

97
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,350
Here.

98
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,057
Loss of differentiation
between gray and white matter.

99
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,388
It's subtle.

100
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,019
But it's in the area
that controls memory.

101
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,030
Not likely
it's a coincidence.

102
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,032
Bacterial infection?

103
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,497
Do I need
to know this?

104
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,898
Fine, I'll give you
the CliffNotes version.

105
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,132
Chase, MS.
Taub, physical trauma.

106
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,868
I could tell you
why we ruled them out.

107
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,307
Or not.

108
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,710
It's probably a toxin, and we need
to find it before it kills her.

109
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,009
We should
search her house.

110
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,277
Good luck with that.

111
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,819
Her heart rate monitor
has a serial number.

112
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,515
The distributor can match the
number to the store that sold it.

113
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,852
She's a serious athlete.

114
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,552
She might have been there
often enough to be remembered.

115
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:02,085
Brilliant.

116
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,788
Did he really say that?

117
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,989
Subtextually.

118
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,120
Long shot.

119
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,793
Even if the store clerk
does know who she is,

120
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,392
the store's probably
close to where she lives.

121
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,370
Just seeing those surroundings
might spark a memory.

122
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:13,803
You want us to
take her there?

123
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,170
No.

124
00:06:15,675 --> 00:06:17,165
I'll take her.

125
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,038
Really?

126
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,712
It's unusual for you to spend
time with a patient, isn't it?

127
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,682
Patients are boring,
as people.

128
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,309
This one, I'm sure,
was no exception,

129
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,220
but her situation
was interesting.

130
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:32,621
Besides, I was
still avoiding Wilson,

131
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,956
and no better way to avoid
than leaving the hospital.

132
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:38,326
Maybe. Or were you
avoiding going home?

133
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,232
There's a reason
they tell addicts

134
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,698
to stay away
from old geography.

135
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,293
I wasn't avoiding going home.
I'd already gone home,

136
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,206
<i>before I came in
to work that day.</i>

137
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,173
<i>I went straight
there from Wilson's.</i>

138
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,505
Hey! Take it easy.
You're gonna kill me.

139
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,105
God, why don't
people knock...

140
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,641
House, it's you! Where
you been? Hold up a second.

141
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,317
Alvie?

142
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:05,351
Juan Alvarez? You let
him stay at your place?

143
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,548
Not exactly.

144
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,191
I was beginning to wonder if
you were ever gonna show up.

145
00:07:18,004 --> 00:07:19,096
Why are you here?

146
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,697
When I left Mayfield, I went
back to the old neighborhood.

147
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,867
You know, you shouldn't leave
the bathroom window unlocked.

148
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,878
Yeah, thanks for the safety
lesson. Why are you here?

149
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,413
Like I said, when I went
back to the neighborhood,

150
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,142
I found out Immigration
was looking for me.

151
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:32,844
So I decided to visit
my old buddy House.

152
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:35,683
And turn his apartment into
a giant prison jumpsuit.

153
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,052
Juan Alvarez is
no freeloader.

154
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,715
I do my part,
earn my keep.

155
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,123
The first week, I made you
dinner, but you never showed up.

156
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,923
The second week,
I organized your stuff.

157
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,119
My stuff?

158
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,290
But still,
you never showed up.

159
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,799
So this week, since I'm a real good
painter, I decided to feng shui...

160
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,098
Coffee table.
Where'd you put it?

161
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,038
In the bedroom?

162
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,735
The paint's not cheap,
House. It's a custom color.

163
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,573
It's a mix of titanium yellow and ochre.

164
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,873
Ochre. I don't even
like that stuff.

165
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,414
It's like a fruit,
it's got hair on it,

166
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,506
but they say
it's a vegetable...

167
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,246
You sold my table to pay
for paint that I don't want?

168
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,118
I had to sell some
other things, too.

169
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:17,419
Get out.

170
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,089
No, papa, just give
the color a chance.

171
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,531
Look, I'm going
to work now.

172
00:08:21,601 --> 00:08:23,330
And when I come back,
the walls will be

173
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,427
a less exciting color,
and you will be gone.

174
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:33,336
So Wilson threw you out, and you
threw Alvie out. Just another week?

175
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,141
But unlike me,
Alvie didn't leave.

176
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,011
I took my motorcycle
to work that day.

177
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,347
When I went home
to get my car,

178
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,784
he was painting
the ceiling magenta.

179
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:44,852
So I brought him with me
to protect the apartment.

180
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,583
Why?

181
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,422
To protect the apartment.

182
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:50,822
Whoa, déjà vu.

183
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,228
Tossing him out, or
sending him to the movies,

184
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:55,233
or locking him
in the bathroom

185
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,735
would also minimize
Alvie's destructive force.

186
00:08:57,803 --> 00:09:01,637
But you chose his company
deliberately. Why?

187
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,766
Obviously, because
he's a Wilson substitute.

188
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,640
You can barely tell the
difference between them,

189
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,440
especially when Wilson
raps about the 'hood.

190
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,276
I'm not suggesting
Alvie's a substitute,

191
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,316
but he would make
a great distraction.

192
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,544
From what?

193
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,347
That's what I'm
trying to find out.

194
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,353
Go on.

195
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,196
Maybe the heart rate
monitor was a gift.

196
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:26,629
That's why no one
recognized her.

197
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:28,428
Shut up, Alvie.

198
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,699
Anything familiar?
Church? Grocery store?

199
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,834
Sorry.

200
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,101
It's okay, Miss X.

201
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,039
Maybe she's never been
to this town before.

202
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,305
Bought the heart rate monitor
on the store's website.

203
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,506
You know that Puerto Ricans
are US citizens, right?

204
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,243
Instead of working the case,
why don't you contemplate

205
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,911
the inanity of an American with
American immigration issues?

206
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,079
I had a birth certificate.
I lost it.

207
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,089
So get a new one.
I tried that, House.

208
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,057
But the town hall had
burned down when I was a kid,

209
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,490
destroyed the records.

210
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,720
There's only one copy?

211
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,423
They tried to make me fill
out a whole bunch of forms

212
00:09:58,497 --> 00:09:59,555
before they'd
give it to me.

213
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:02,567
I decided it'd be quicker
and easier to do it myself.

214
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:03,659
How'd that go?

215
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:04,896
They figured out
it was forged,

216
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,098
and now, for some reason, they
don't believe anything I say.

217
00:10:07,173 --> 00:10:09,573
They actually think I'm lying
about being Puerto Rican.

218
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,475
Told me I had to go to a
special hearing to prove it.

219
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:15,036
What if nothing
ever looks familiar?

220
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,919
Then someone will show
up, a spouse, a friend,

221
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,284
to tell you who
you really are

222
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,754
and what you
should be feeling.

223
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:25,120
They always do.

224
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,452
I don't know who that
is, but I miss him.

225
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,030
What did they say
at the hearing?

226
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,592
I didn't go.
I lied once.

227
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,864
Your mother's
Puerto Rican,

228
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,098
therefore you are
Puerto Rican.

229
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,662
All you gotta do is prove
your mom is your mom.

230
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:42,901
Find some
documentation...

231
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,443
People like that don't
listen to people like me.

232
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,103
Donuts. Hey, House,
let's get donuts!

233
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,168
Alvie, the hearing...

234
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,339
Everyone loves donuts.

235
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:52,213
Glazed, crullers, elephant
ears, even donut holes.

236
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,478
Much better than
the sporting goods store.

237
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,179
I bet Mrs. X went there
all the time.

238
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:56,778
We're not here...

239
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,287
<i>And then I realized...</i>

240
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,320
You make a good point.

241
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,986
Really?
I was making that up.

242
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,020
Dozen glazed,
dozen jelly-filled?

243
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,724
You want
the usual, right?

244
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:11,968
Your old friend,
the fried carbohydrate.

245
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,505
She needed the calorically dense food

246
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:14,596
to support
the running habit.

247
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,505
Do you know her name?

248
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:21,837
Sandy or Shelley,
I don't know.

249
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,814
The guy she's with
called her that once.

250
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,109
I just work here.

251
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,811
Do you know
where they live?

252
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,616
He left a business card
in our free donut jar.

253
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,214
It's up on
the Wall of Winners.

254
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:41,457
Sidney.

255
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,070
God, I was
so worried about you.

256
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,006
What happened?

257
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,120
The police said it was
too soon to do anything,

258
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,622
so I started calling
hospitals on my own.

259
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,851
Princeton-Plainsboro
wasn't even on my list.

260
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:09,258
You really think something around
here could have made her sick?

261
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:12,320
Here, work, anywhere she
could have been exposed.

262
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,662
Why wasn't Princeton-Plainsboro
on your list?

263
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:18,397
Well, I mean, it's a long
way to run, even for her.

264
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:21,839
What is it I do
besides run?

265
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,941
You're a lawyer. Civil
rights, class-action suits.

266
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,780
It's a stressful job, running's
the way you deal with it.

267
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,720
That doesn't
sound like me.

268
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,949
Do you have any idea
what would sound like you?

269
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:39,955
Good point.

270
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,017
<i>So what were you
thinking during all this?</i>

271
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,655
<i>That it was a strange position to be in.</i>

272
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,856
<i>At that moment,
she was more comfortable</i>

273
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,867
<i>with me than
with her husband.</i>

274
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:52,062
<i>And he was
picking up on it.</i>

275
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:54,562
What about you?

276
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:56,369
What about me how?

277
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:01,308
There was a sort of artificial
intimacy between you.

278
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:03,173
She had been
dependent on you.

279
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,911
Did you find that
attractive on some level?

280
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,680
Disturbing?

281
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,982
Those are
my two choices?

282
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,253
None of the above.

283
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,659
She was just a patient.
She was interesting.

284
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,263
So we're really married.

285
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,836
For four years.

286
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,330
Miss X, you lead
a lemon-fresh life.

287
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:29,397
I found three different
cleansers under the sink.

288
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,874
Cleaned out
the medicine cabinets, too.

289
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,571
You know, she just won a
settlement for some families

290
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,342
whose housing development was
built on an old methane field.

291
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,983
A toxic exposure to
methane could explain this.

292
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,384
I surf?

293
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,750
You stopped
before we met.

294
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,586
You've been too busy.

295
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,690
And we're married?

296
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:50,954
Yes.

297
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,554
All right,
it's nothing personal.

298
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,791
I bet she didn't think
you were her type

299
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:55,925
back when you
first met either.

300
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,628
We'll take her
back to the hospital,

301
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,365
test her blood and
urine, start treatment.

302
00:14:01,974 --> 00:14:03,874
Are you okay?
I'm all right.

303
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,668
What happened?

304
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,338
I don't know. My foot
suddenly went numb.

305
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:09,946
Her pants are wet.

306
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,012
Urinary incontinence.

307
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:18,483
She's having complex partial
seizures. This isn't methane.

308
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,655
And you can
leave the bucket.

309
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:21,715
We need to get her...

310
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:22,783
<i>Seizures?</i>

311
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,794
This is the second
diagnosis you've come up with

312
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,560
that has a personal
resonance for you.

313
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,896
I'm choosing my diagnoses
based on personal issues?

314
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,204
You think she fell down the
stairs and peed her pants

315
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,398
'cause Wilson
dumped her, too?

316
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,135
You're choosing to tell me about
this case. So let's look at it.

317
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,871
First, you were fixated on a
harmful toxin from her past,

318
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:40,969
possibly because
you're worried

319
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,172
about a harmful
toxin from your...

320
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,046
Chase had the toxin idea. Maybe
he's obsessed with my past.

321
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:46,709
And now you're talking
about a seizure disorder...

322
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:48,184
Which is also
not a toxin.

323
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:52,213
But which is most likely caused
by an old injury to the brain.

324
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:55,351
Why do you see your past
as such a threat?

325
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,858
Not only am I
unthreatened by it,

326
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,022
I was trying
to get it back.

327
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,029
There's a ding mark.

328
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,734
It's a piece of junk. It
was dinged when it came in.

329
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,601
Sure. The cup marks,
the scuffs,

330
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:08,901
and the paint,
and those three chips.

331
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:10,305
This fourth one is new.

332
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,345
I run a pawn shop, not a storage
company. Do you want it or not?

333
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,074
That should be it.

334
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,483
You said you pawned five
books. There's only four.

335
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,315
That's all there is.

336
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,016
<i>Where's Approach to
the Acute Abdomen?</i>

337
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:29,452
Sold it.

338
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,423
To?
I can't tell you.

339
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,261
It's the law,
and it should be.

340
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,734
Crazy bastards like you
try to hunt down their stuff.

341
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:41,532
How much for the pile?

342
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:46,071
$500.

343
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,372
You said it was junk.

344
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,143
No, no. It's your junk, you want it.

345
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,013
$500.
Take it or leave it.

346
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,224
Why is it so important that
you get your stuff back?

347
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,432
Unlike
the rest of humanity,

348
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,093
who's okay when their
belongings are taken?

349
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,136
Everyone wants their stuff.
That's why it's their stuff.

350
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,365
Everyone doesn't pay five
times what it's worth.

351
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,603
I like my stuff. I hate
it when Wilson moves...

352
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:18,734
Oh.

353
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,472
This is not
about Wilson!

354
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:33,718
Say it.

355
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,726
I wasn't gonna
say anything.

356
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,770
Thirty-one, thirty-one!
Hike!

357
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:58,741
First down!

358
00:16:58,817 --> 00:16:59,943
One more,
you get a touchdown.

359
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,179
Whoo!

360
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,449
Hike!

361
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,396
House, you can't run
for the touchdown.

362
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,966
And hike!

363
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,094
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Wait.</i>

364
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,503
You seriously thought you're gonna
tell me that Wilson showed up,

365
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,700
but not tell me
what he said?

366
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,300
Because I thought
you were a smart guy

367
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,311
who didn't need the
obvious spelled out to him.

368
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,679
Wilson noticed that I didn't
come to my office all day.

369
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,909
He came to find me.

370
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,919
Wanted to make sure I'm
okay. Boring, boring, boring.

371
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,918
But you thought it was important
to tell me about Nerf football?

372
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,491
Sorry, your story.
Continue.

373
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,325
House! House! Stop!
Stop, stop, stop.

374
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:50,026
You okay?

375
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,228
Yeah.

376
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:57,272
It was my mother's. She died when
I was four. It's all I have left.

377
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,101
That's very sad, Alvie.

378
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,010
Listen, I set up
an immigration hearing.

379
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,174
No, House. I'm gonna
end up in jail.

380
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,218
<i>Or worse, the Dominican or
someplace, qué sé yo qué. No.</i>

381
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,514
<i>That is interesting.</i>

382
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,613
You present yourself
as not giving a damn

383
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,918
about other
people's emotions,

384
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,516
but your actions
indicate otherwise.

385
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,620
You dismiss Alvie's story
about his mother,

386
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,460
but you cared enough
to schedule a hearing.

387
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:23,057
I cared
for eight seconds.

388
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,330
Then I got distracted.

389
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,800
Yeah.

390
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,139
<i>We've kept the patient up
for 12 hours now.</i>

391
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,874
<i>No hint of seizure-like activity.
We should shut this down.</i>

392
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,143
Try a strobe light,
add more stress.

393
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:39,878
<i>I think there's
plenty of stress in here.</i>

394
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,512
Don't we ever do
anything but work?

395
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,045
You run.

396
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,454
That's just
more work!

397
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:49,460
What about fun? God, how
can we be this boring?

398
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,428
Apparently,
without her memory,

399
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,260
the patient's
personality has returned

400
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:56,768
to what you might call
its natural state.

401
00:18:56,835 --> 00:19:00,498
Seems she had a wake-up call
while she was at college.

402
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,935
Her brother died
in a car accident.

403
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,705
She decided to make her life mean
something, went to law school.

404
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,342
Now that's all gone.

405
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:12,984
The thing that caused
the change is gone,

406
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,451
so the change itself
is gone.

407
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,718
Yeah. I knew the psychological aspects

408
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,451
of this case
would interest you.

409
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,359
Bet you got a theory
already. What is it?

410
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:24,622
It's not relevant.

411
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,795
What is it?

412
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,664
Why do you care
about my theory?

413
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:34,637
I think
he just bores her.

414
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,673
I think she's at an earlier
stage of development,

415
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:41,839
she's looking at her grownup
future, and it puts her to sleep.

416
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:45,475
If he just bored her,
she'd hide it to be polite.

417
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:47,651
Their problem
is synchronicity.

418
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,279
Just like you and me, House,
they're not on the same page.

419
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,882
He talks to her like someone
he shares history with.

420
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:54,948
But from
her point of view,

421
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,427
he's a stranger
forcing intimacy on her.

422
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,226
Of course she doesn't
like him. He's not helping.

423
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:03,462
He can feel he's
losing his wife,

424
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,797
and it makes him
come on stronger.

425
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,468
He almost did
lose his wife.

426
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,097
The breathing problem was caused
by fluid overload in the lungs.

427
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,606
Diabetes insipidus.

428
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:45,040
And the DI came from
damage to the hypothalamus.

429
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,611
Hypothalamus here, that's
the DI and incontinence,

430
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,806
they mingle here,
that's the global amnesia,

431
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:51,576
and the motor cortex,
that's the foot paralysis.

432
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,776
What do they all
have in common?

433
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,614
<i>Okay, now you're just
doing this to mess with me.</i>

434
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,255
What possible relevance does this
differential have to your problems?

435
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:02,526
It ends with a diagnosis
of Spongiform Encephalitis.

436
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,462
I convinced the team to cut
out part of this woman's brain.

437
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:07,293
That's not interesting to you? No.

438
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:10,091
Not even if
it's the amygdala?

439
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:12,193
She'll lose all her
long-term memories.

440
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,397
Well, this is
where you tell me

441
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,939
that being cavalier with
someone else's past

442
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,271
has nothing to do with
avoiding your own past.

443
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:21,210
The case is irrelevant, you
just found it interesting.

444
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,841
Aren't therapists
supposed to be nurturing?

445
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:28,178
Nowhere is that
in the manual.

446
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:32,318
Look, you've been
in therapy for a year.

447
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:33,688
You know when I ask you
to talk about anything,

448
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,624
I mean anything
that affects you.

449
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:39,694
What upset you, what made you
mad, or relieved, or joyful.

450
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:43,394
You want me to believe that
this case means nothing?

451
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:46,597
Then

452
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,439
why should I
listen to it?

453
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,058
Are you charging me
for this time?

454
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:15,224
Yes.

455
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,632
This is ridiculous.

456
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:24,876
What's that?
On the back of your arm?

457
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:29,906
It's just a bruise.
I fell.

458
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,213
You remember falling?

459
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,577
No. I was drunk.

460
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,152
Hence the balance issues.

461
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:41,886
It looks like you fell on
the tip of someone's boot.

462
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,461
I said something that
someone objected to.

463
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,268
Well, if you don't remember, then how...

464
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,671
It's usually the way it is
when someone hits me.

465
00:22:56,908 --> 00:22:59,240
People who kick when
you're down are jerks,

466
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:01,609
but they're generally
not irrational jerks.

467
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,114
You got drunk enough to get into
a bar fight and not remember,

468
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:07,379
and you've been insisting
that everything's fine?

469
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,648
Why go out and
get blind drunk?

470
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,246
Were you looking
for a fight?

471
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:15,256
I don't know.

472
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,122
What have
you screwed up?

473
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,292
What?

474
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,461
You say that when you've
been hit in the past,

475
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,370
it's because you've provoked
it with something that you said.

476
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,465
Which means you're
well aware of the risks.

477
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,510
So, on some level,
you were in that bar

478
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,943
looking for someone
to hurt you.

479
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:39,377
Logically, people punish
themselves for something they did,

480
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,578
or something
they didn't do.

481
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:46,219
So, what did
you screw up?

482
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,956
I don't know.

483
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,879
Okay, there may be
a problem.

484
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,219
All right.

485
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,992
Let's talk
about Wilson.

486
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:26,230
I told him your book was
contaminated with anthrax spores.

487
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,461
Then I gave him $300.
The address of the buyer.

488
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:34,062
Maybe I was hasty
in asking you to move out.

489
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,833
Why don't you stay with me
and Sam for a little while?

490
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,603
There's no need
to hurry things.

491
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:41,274
What prompted this?

492
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,714
Look, the whole idea was that after
Mayfield, you wouldn't be on your own.

493
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,377
I can touch base with
you a lot more easily

494
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:49,852
if you're staying
with me than...

495
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:51,354
For God's sake, Wilson.

496
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:55,115
You really span the chasm
from wishy to washy.

497
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:58,788
If you're gonna be an ass,
be an ass. Stick with it.

498
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,027
Why were you being
so hard on the guy,

499
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,464
when he was
being conciliatory?

500
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:07,801
Come on, Cuddy played on his
guilt. She put him up to this.

501
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,397
How do you know that?

502
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:11,704
How do you know this wasn't
entirely his own idea?

503
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,540
Two reasons.
First, he wants to create

504
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,547
the perfect environment
to be with Sam.

505
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,373
He's been thinking about
asking me to leave for a while.

506
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,943
Finally, he does it, and immediately
turns around and changes his mind?

507
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,318
No. He talked
to somebody.

508
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,521
Maybe it was Sam.

509
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,852
<i>Yeah,
that's a possibility.</i>

510
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:34,664
I want this to be the last
serious relationship I ever have.

511
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,257
I want this
to be the one.

512
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:37,426
Me, too.

513
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,738
Where's House? It's not
as meaningful without him.

514
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,768
Okay, not Sam.

515
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,778
That still doesn't
answer why Cuddy.

516
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:52,544
Because they've
been talking about me.

517
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,212
She called me to
check on the patient,

518
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,448
which she never does
without a reason.

519
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,217
I asked why,
and she said...

520
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,623
She's a barracuda
attorney, House.

521
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:03,854
These are the kind of
patients we like to keep happy.

522
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,487
Right now,
the patient's lucky

523
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,555
if she can spell
"jurisprudence. "

524
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,760
Yeah, but when she
gets that memory back,

525
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,200
which we're trying
to make happen,

526
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:16,070
she'll be able to spell "lawsuit.
" I'm just touching base.

527
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:22,270
"Touching base. " Wilson
used exactly the same phrase.

528
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,814
Colluding about me is
their favorite pastime.

529
00:26:26,117 --> 00:26:28,176
Okay, you think
they talked.

530
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,285
How do you think
that conversation went?

531
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:38,930
I'm worried
about House.

532
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:44,096
Me, too.
Couldn't you have waited?

533
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:48,471
It's way too early for him to be on
his own, back in the old apartment.

534
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,973
What makes you think
he can handle it?

535
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,565
I offered to find
him a new place.

536
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,008
You have to let him
back into your condo.

537
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,943
Sam and I just got
him out of the condo.

538
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:57,982
You know what House is like,
he's self-destructive.

539
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,311
Without
constant supervision,

540
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,852
he's gonna slide
back into drugs.

541
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,821
If you're not watching him, I've got to.

542
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,015
Yeah.

543
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,192
So they don't
trust you.

544
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,785
They assume you'll fail.

545
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:14,127
Are these
their fears or yours?

546
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:19,796
Let's turn on
the lights. Hmm?

547
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:23,196
In your brain.

548
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:26,139
Maybe they did
talk about you,

549
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,739
but how do you know it
didn't happen like this?

550
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,809
I'm worried
about House.

551
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:33,942
Why?

552
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:35,782
It's the first time he'll
be on his own since Mayfield.

553
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,385
No, you're being
over-protective.

554
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,582
House doesn't need to be
wrapped in cotton wool.

555
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,650
But you know that, or you wouldn't
have asked him to move out.

556
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,525
Okay. I guess this
is really about me.

557
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,963
It's just I feel
like a jerk.

558
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,898
Sure, Sam and I are gonna
wanna be on our own eventually,

559
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,663
but I kind of
sprang this on him.

560
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,331
The right way would've
been to just tell him

561
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:57,432
to take as long
as he needed,

562
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,409
that there's no hurry.

563
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:02,972
So it's not what you did,
but how you did it?

564
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,677
That matters in a friendship.
I need to fix this.

565
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,483
Why don't you talk to him
about moving back in?

566
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,655
Just touch base.

567
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,650
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

568
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,787
Wait a minute.
Taub's not here.

569
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,921
Yeah, he is.

570
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,693
We're having a consent
issue with the patient.

571
00:28:21,766 --> 00:28:24,496
What's Taub doing in
my imaginary version

572
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,593
of a scene with
Wilson and Cuddy?

573
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,332
Your version needed to be
ended. Because it's crap.

574
00:28:28,406 --> 00:28:30,465
It's all sweetness
and light and faith

575
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,702
that I'm gonna choose
the right path.

576
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,144
Yeah, that sounds
like Wilson.

577
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,511
I have as much evidence for
mine as you do for yours.

578
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:43,383
I know Wilson's
your friend,

579
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:46,618
so he could be wondering
if he did right by you.

580
00:28:46,691 --> 00:28:47,851
And I know he wouldn't
have asked you

581
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,018
to move out in
the first place

582
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,358
unless he was convinced you
could handle life on your own.

583
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,364
And I know that he and Cuddy
have gone behind my back before

584
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:57,424
to strategize about
"the House problem. "

585
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,697
So there's truth
in both versions.

586
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,534
But you choose to
focus on the parts

587
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,074
that make you
uncomfortable. So...

588
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:15,579
Why are you and
Wilson friends?

589
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,315
Do you think this friendship
is the best you can do?

590
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,927
Wilson is not
a consolation prize.

591
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,522
There,
you're defending him.

592
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,500
And a minute ago, he was
skulking around in the background

593
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,196
like some sort of
manipulative lago.

594
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:35,968
He's my friend.

595
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,333
So what do you
value in him?

596
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:47,648
I can say whatever I want to
him, and he'll never leave.

597
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,550
He's sort of leaving.

598
00:29:49,754 --> 00:29:52,348
At least, he won't
be around as much.

599
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,985
Because he's
putting Sam first.

600
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,390
For now.

601
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,495
After the divorce, he'll
probably ask me to move in again.

602
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,091
I take the long view.

603
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,266
You say that to Wilson?

604
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:08,327
Are you kidding?

605
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,739
That's the kind of remark
that leads people to hit you.

606
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,046
Maybe you've been right
from the beginning.

607
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,715
Maybe this isn't
about Wilson.

608
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:24,111
You say that now that I
finally agree with you?

609
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,248
Do you just argue the
opposite of whatever I say?

610
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,122
I don't mean the Wilson
thing doesn't bother you.

611
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:30,752
But it sounds like
he's the closest

612
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,558
you could come to
a safe relationship.

613
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,258
You'd have to do something
major to screw it up.

614
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:38,899
What else have you been
involved in this week?

615
00:30:40,638 --> 00:30:42,469
What would you want to
punish yourself for?

616
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,334
I told you
I don't know.

617
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,480
Okay, let's approach it
from a different angle.

618
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:57,513
Have you gotten any other people
angry at you over anything?

619
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:02,217
Well, yeah. That's why I
called it an ordinary week.

620
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,794
Okay. Tell me about it.

621
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,929
You'd be losing
a part of your brain.

622
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,237
It is my brain. Why is it
not my right to consent?

623
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,236
I'm sorry, but I'll take this to
court, if necessary, all right?

624
00:31:22,313 --> 00:31:25,077
Sidney's in no position to make
decisions about herself right now.

625
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:26,514
She doesn't even
know who she is.

626
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:29,451
I read your consent form and I
understood it. I want the surgery.

627
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,680
Why wouldn't she?

628
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,815
Of course she's willing to risk
losing her memories permanently,

629
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,986
she has no idea how
important those memories are.

630
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,858
Does she even know
what "risk" is?

631
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,454
She's never
lost anything!

632
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,364
Without the surgery,
she'll lose everything.

633
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:45,368
The prion infection
will continue to advance

634
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,630
and destroy
her whole brain.

635
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,934
There has to
be another way.

636
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,100
Please.

637
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,339
I'm speaking
for my wife,

638
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,237
the wife I lived with
for four years,

639
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,113
who isn't here and
can't defend herself.

640
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:02,947
Dr. House,
are you listening?

641
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:07,387
Well, you can stop arguing
'cause it doesn't matter anymore.

642
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,292
Look at the variability
in the heart rate.

643
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,659
The SE's spread
into the brainstem.

644
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,456
Wherever it is,
you can still cut it out.

645
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:20,527
No. We can't
cut the brainstem.

646
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:21,970
This thing's
moving too quickly.

647
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,372
Surgery is
no longer an option.

648
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,434
Which, I guess, means
you've won. Congratulations.

649
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,947
Put in a pacer, and start
her on chemo and radiation.

650
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,142
It won't cure her, but
it'll buy a couple weeks,

651
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,617
so she can find out who
she is before she dies.

652
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,113
<i>That was pretty rough.</i>

653
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,426
<i>Do you always break the news
to your patients that way?</i>

654
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,254
Or were you
shorthanding it for me?

655
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,355
Husband was
being an idiot.

656
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,899
Well, he was
asking for it.

657
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,502
But to punish him, you had
to punish the wife, too.

658
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:55,729
Why did he make you
so angry?

659
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,742
Because he didn't want
to cooperate with you?

660
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,877
He'd rather risk his wife's
life than their marriage.

661
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,573
People's brains stop
working when they think

662
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,174
they're gonna lose
someone they love.

663
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,313
Your leg hurting?

664
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:15,419
It's all right.

665
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,453
Okay.

666
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,559
Anyone else
you pissed off?

667
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,764
Fifty bucks
for the book.

668
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,001
Forget it.

669
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,141
You paid $25.
That's 100% return.

670
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,304
That's what I paid.

671
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,144
But it's a rare surgical
text, nearly 100 years old,

672
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:42,585
plates in mint condition. That
book's worth several thousand dollars.

673
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,848
$2,000.
I'll write you a check.

674
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:45,980
Nice try.

675
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,423
Face it. I had
the wit to recognize

676
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,358
something valuable
when I saw it.

677
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:55,730
In the great Darwinian race, I get
my just reward, you become roadkill.

678
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,439
Yo, House, you wanna
stop by the library?

679
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:11,709
'Cause I got
a book to return.

680
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,410
<i>Old professor
tried to hoard/hog</i>

681
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,046
<i>You can't stop Alvie
with no guard-ass dog</i>

682
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:19,214
Anyone see you?

683
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,985
Yeah, Prof saw me
walking down the driveway.

684
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,788
He said the roses
need more fertilizer.

685
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,559
I didn't know there was a section
of the brain just for hope.

686
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,298
It's very, very tiny.

687
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,636
We used fluoroscopy to guide pacemaker
placement in the patient's heart.

688
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:38,868
Hello.

689
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:43,538
Hello. Rapidly progressive
dilated cardiomyopathy.

690
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,104
This isn't SE,
and whatever it is,

691
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:46,275
it's not just
in her brain,

692
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:47,840
it's attacking
her whole body.

693
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,514
You work for House? I guess
we're teammates. Isn't that cool?

694
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,550
Hello.

695
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:55,917
Juan Alvarez?

696
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,017
What the hell?

697
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,723
We're taking you into
custody. Deportation order.

698
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:02,288
I'm a citizen. You're
disrespecting Puerto Rico.

699
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:05,267
If you're a citizen, why
did you miss your hearing?

700
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,602
You called them?

701
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,838
What's going on?

702
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,982
We're trying to
stabilize her heart.

703
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,550
She's still tachy
and hypotensive.

704
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,763
Brain, heart,
and rapidly progressing.

705
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:36,793
<i>Endocarditis. Slow-moving
infection in her heart</i>

706
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:38,426
<i>throws clots
to her brain.</i>

707
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,836
I'm not talking to you.

708
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,097
How could you
turn me in?

709
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,109
<i>Her extreme exercise
suppresses her immune system,</i>

710
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:47,769
allows the infection
to smoulder.

711
00:35:47,845 --> 00:35:51,076
<i>Or allows an old infection
to re-activate. TB.</i>

712
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,250
Start her on
a multi-drug regimen.

713
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,583
I don't like you, House.
I hate you.

714
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,919
<i>Even IV antibiotics
will take time to work.</i>

715
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:03,558
A gentle reminder, the use
of cell phones is prohibited.

716
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,392
Give her the first dose directly
into the lungs in the OR.

717
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,523
Before the less-gentle
arrest for contempt.

718
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,590
Put her in an isolation
room with UV light.

719
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,796
And get yourselves tested.
You've all been exposed.

720
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:18,574
Docket number 4378.

721
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:26,614
You are?

722
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,549
I'm Mr. Alvarez's
doctor.

723
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,021
Your Honor,
DNA evidence proving

724
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,859
the matriarchal lineage
of Juan Alvarez.

725
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:46,093
My mother's DNA was
still on that cross?

726
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,364
It could be.

727
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,740
You faked it?

728
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,778
It wasn't just me.
You lied to them, too.

729
00:36:56,847 --> 00:36:59,577
But I'm better at it
than you are.

730
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,552
<i>I'm gonna re-paint
your whole apartment now</i>

731
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,554
<i>Make the drapes
match the carpet now</i>

732
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,488
Lungs sound wet.
O2 sats are dropping.

733
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,427
We may need to tube her.
Grab some IV furosemide.

734
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,692
Wait. Wait.

735
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:18,792
She's crashing.

736
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,029
We need to
get her on a vent.

737
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,174
There's something
on her ankle.

738
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,182
A tattoo.

739
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:40,448
"Eddie would go. "
It's a surfing phrase.

740
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,253
Must be from
her earlier life.

741
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,118
She tried to
get it removed.

742
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:47,027
But they only took off
the top layers of skin.

743
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,793
The ink is still in
the deeper layers.

744
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,724
It set off
an allergic reaction.

745
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:53,770
She was fine until she started
the long-distance running.

746
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,306
The ultra-marathoning
modified her immune system

747
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,739
and set off
the allergic reaction.

748
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,677
We did a full-thickness skin
graft and she'll be okay.

749
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:09,114
So, you were right in
the end. It was her past.

750
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,346
Did she get
her memory back?

751
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:14,752
Not yet.

752
00:38:15,926 --> 00:38:17,052
Will she?

753
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:19,051
No way to know.

754
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,064
I think roses
are my favorite.

755
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,863
But I guess I told
you that at some point.

756
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,562
I don't remember.

757
00:38:29,273 --> 00:38:31,707
He's treating her
as though they've just met.

758
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,875
He's courting her.
Whose idea was that?

759
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,308
He was doing the opposite
of everything he should,

760
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,476
suddenly he's changed.

761
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:42,712
Taub thought
it might...

762
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,550
That was your idea.

763
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:48,122
And you asked me what I thought
was going on between them.

764
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,285
It's their relationship
that's on your mind.

765
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,420
That's why you've been
thinking about this case.

766
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,986
Relationships.

767
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,659
Lost one with Wilson,
gained one with Alvie...

768
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:58,292
<i>Not exactly.</i>

769
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:01,898
Alvie!

770
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:22,418
You gonna tell me
what the note said?

771
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:31,295
Alvie was very grateful that
I'd gotten him out of trouble.

772
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,469
It allowed him to go stay
with his cousin in Phoenix

773
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,098
without worrying about
Immigration looking for him there.

774
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,510
You didn't think he
was gonna stay forever?

775
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:41,636
No.

776
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:45,110
What happened next?

777
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,586
<i>Nothing happened next.</i>

778
00:40:20,117 --> 00:40:21,778
That's all I got.

779
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,947
Relationships.

780
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,520
Bergman. What do
you want me to say?

781
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,621
I don't know, you're the
one who set the theme.

782
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,157
Something
about relationships

783
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,963
made you go out
and provoke a fight.

784
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,765
Wilson and Sam
have a relationship.

785
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:45,435
You're not thrilled
about it.

786
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:46,771
They're happy.

787
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,874
Why should I screw that
up? Everyone's happy.

788
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:55,047
Everyone's
moving in together.

789
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,279
Wilson and Sam, Cuddy and
Lucas, even Alvie and his...

790
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,654
Cuddy and Lucas are
moving in together?

791
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,717
You didn't mention that.

792
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,853
They've talked about
moving in together before.

793
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,898
It's not big news.

794
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,196
Cuddy.

795
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,870
Cuddy.

796
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,307
<i>Approach to
the Acute Abdomen.</i>

797
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,859
Written by
Ernest T. Cuddy, M.D.

798
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,326
Any relation
to your Cuddy?

799
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,231
Her great-grandfather.

800
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,566
I've had it for years.

801
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:49,003
Always meant to give it to
her for a special occasion.

802
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,807
Like her housewarming?

803
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,170
It's just a gift.

804
00:41:54,578 --> 00:41:57,308
A woman you care about has taken
one step further away from you

805
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:59,474
and closer
to someone else.

806
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,074
I think I can
safely say, yes,

807
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,278
it's significant
if you don't mention it.

808
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,118
You were willing to punish
the husband of your patient

809
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,522
because you identified
with him.

810
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,419
He was also losing
someone he loved.

811
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:13,861
I'm not gonna go out
and get hammered

812
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,957
because a woman I'm not even
with is moving in with someone.

813
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,797
That'd be pathetic.

814
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:23,166
To hell with this.

815
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,470
When I first
came to you,

816
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,074
I told you that
I wanted to be happy.

817
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:35,482
I followed your advice, and
instead I'm just miserable.

818
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,313
How is this
working for me?

819
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,882
It takes time.

820
00:42:40,958 --> 00:42:43,483
For a year, I've done
everything you've asked,

821
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,688
and everybody else
is happy.

822
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,393
I run my treadmill, you
just sit there and watch.

823
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:52,534
You're a faith healer.

824
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,667
You take advantage of
people who want to believe.

825
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,410
But there's nothing
in your bag of tricks.

826
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:05,842
House!

827
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,818
Whatever the answer is,
you don't have it.
